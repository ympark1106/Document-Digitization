If a pipeline is rejected because of a failed air test, as part of the rectification work, a water test as described in subClause 3 of this Clause may be carried out as an alternative acceptability test. Before testing, the ends of the pipeline to be tested, including those of short branches, shall be plugged and sealed.
 2 For the pipeline air test, air shall be pumped in by suitable means until a stable pressure of 100 mm head of water is indicated in a U-tube connected to the system. The air pressure shall not fall to less than 75 mm head of water during a period of 5 minutes without further pumping, after an initial period to allow stabilization. Drains with traps shall be tested to 50 mm head of water and the permissible loss shall then be no more than 13 mm head of water in 5 minutes without further pumping after the initial stabilising period.
 3 For the pipeline water test, the pipes shall be filled with water under a head of not less than 1.2 m above the
 
 crown of the pipe at the high end and not more than 6 m above the pipe at the low end. Steeply graded pipelines shall be tested in sections so that the above maximum is not exceeded. The test shall commence not less than two hours after filling the test section at which time the level of water at the vertical feed pipe shall be made up to produce the required 1.2 m minimum test head. The loss of water over a 30 minute period shall be measured by adding water at regular 10 minute intervals to restore the original water level and recording the amounts so added. The drain will have passed the test if the volume of water added does not exceed one litre per hour per linear metre of drain per metre of nominal internal diameter.
 4 (05/01) All pipelines less than 350 mm diameter, excluding service ducts shall be checked by drawing through each completed length of pipe a spherical mandrel of a diameter 10% less than the nominal bore of the pipes being tested.
 5 (11/04) During the progress of the Works all existing chambers, gullies and rodding eyes shall be kept clean and free from obstruction. On completion of the whole of the Works, all chambers, gullies and drains including verge/surface water drains and filter drains but excluding all fin and narrow filter drains shall be flushed from end to end with water and left free from obstructions. Catchpit chambers shall be left clean and free from silt.
 Unless otherwise required in Appendix 90/1 (MCHW 5.9.3) all carrier, foul and filter drains but excluding all fin and narrow filter drains shall be surveyed by Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) in accordance with the relevant requirements of Series 9000 (MCHW 5.9, Parts 1 to 5). Further guidance is provded in sub-Clauses NG 509.4 and NG 509.5.
 6 The pipes and filter material of filter drains shall at all times be left clean and free from silt and obstruction.
 7 Where described in Appendix 1/5, samples of one or more partly watertight joints for pipelines up to and including 900 mm diameter shall be tested with a head of water kept level with the crown of the pipe. The joint will not be accepted if the flow through the joint in litres per minute exceeds 20 times the square of the nominal internal diameter of the pipe in metres.
 8 Permeability tests shall be as described in Appendix 5/1.
 9 (05/01) Service ducts shall be checked by drawing a wooden mandrel, as shown on HCD Drawing Number I2, through as the ducts are laid but where a set has to be given to the line of ducts the wooden mandrel shall be replaced by an iron mandrel 250 mm long but of the same diameter as the wooden version.

 (v) automatic and continuous water recycling;
 (vi) silt, sand and rubble to be de-watered prior to discharge at licensed tip.
 10 The Contractor shall ensure that no damage occurs to the manhole chamber or pipeline during insertion of the jetting equipment.
 11 (05/05) The jetting head shall be propelled through or over the blockage and then the hose pulled backwards enabling the force of the jet to break up the blockage material. The minimum force necessary to penetrate the blockage shall be used but the pump pressures should not exceed those stated in Table 5/12.
 12 The hose shall be rewound at a rate of between 100 mm and 200 mm per second.
 13 There is a possibility that damage may occur to certain pipe materials should the jetting head remain stationary thus the Contractor must ensure that the jetting head never remains stationary for more than 60 seconds.
 14 Perforated pipes and porous concrete pipes commonly occur in piped highway drainage systems. Where their presence is discovered during the course of the works, the Overseeing Organisation shall be notified immediately and the cleaning operation suspended for that section of the works.
 
 17 If necessary the jetting head shall be changed for one that can deliver the highest volume of water at low pressure. The water pressure shall be sufficient to agitate the silt.
 18 The nozzle shall be drawn back to the point of entry at a rate of between 100 mm and 200 mm per second.
 Silt Removal
 19 Suitable measures such as stanks or stoppers shall be positioned downstream of the drainage system to be cleaned to minimise the risk of sediment causing contamination of watercourses or soakaways.
 20 Wherever practical the Contractor shall use equipment to carry debris over a greater depth than one atmosphere and with a capability to suck liquid.
 21 All arisings from the cleaning process shall be disposed of in an environmentally sensitive manner in accordance with current legislation.
 Health and Safety
 22 The use of high pressure water can result in serious internal injuries that may not be apparent at the skin surface.
 23 The Contractor shall ensure that all hoses are free from damage and that the equipment is in full working order.
 24 Where overhead electric cables are present, there is a potential danger from accidental strike by a jet of water.
 
 Cleaning of Linear Drainage Systems
 15 Where possible the Contractor shall clear blockages in linear drainage channels and combined kerb drainage units by rodding.
 16 Where silt removal is necessitated, the use of pressure jetting will result in the loss of pressure through the grating, slot or drainage holes together with the escape of silt and debris, unless the apertures can be temporarily covered. The application of pressure shall be regulated such that there is only sufficient to drive the jetting head across the silt to access remote from the point of entry.

 602 (02/16) General Requirements
 1 (02/16) The Contractor shall employ only plant and working methods which are suited to the materials to be handled and traversed. He shall be responsible for maintaining the nature of the acceptable material so that when it is placed and compacted it remains acceptable in accordance with the contract. Acceptability shall be determined in accordance with Table 6/1 and any special contract specific requirements in Appendix 6/1.
 2 (02/16) Haulage of material to embankments or other areas of fill shall proceed only when sufficient spreading and compaction plant is operating at the place of deposition to ensure compliance with Clause 612.
 3 (02/16) No excavated acceptable material or unacceptable material required to be processed, other than surplus to the requirements of the contract, shall be removed from the site unless indicated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 6/1. Material which is unacceptable only by reason of being frozen shall be retained on site when in that condition. Where the Contractor is permitted to remove acceptable material, or unacceptable material required to be processed, from the site to suit his operational procedure, then he shall make good any consequent deficit of material arising therefrom. Environmental requirements for processing of Class U1B material, in terms of limiting values of contaminants or other requirements, shall be set out in contract specific Appendix 6/1 in the earthworks Class for which the processed material is to be used.
 4 (02/16) If any acceptable material or unacceptable material required to be processed is, where permitted by contract specific Appendix 6/1, used by the Contractor for purposes other than for general fill, sufficient acceptable fill material to occupy, after full compaction, a volume corresponding to that which the excavated material occupied shall be provided by the Contractor.
 5 (02/16) Acceptable material (other than Class 5A or any Class 5B material replacing Class 5A material in accordance with sub-Clause 3 of this Clause) surplus to the total requirements of the permanent works and all unacceptable material Class U1A not required to be processed shall, unless indicated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 6/1, be run to spoil in tips provided by the Contractor. In the case of unacceptable material, Class U1B and Class U2, the Contractor shall comply with any specific requirements for disposal described in contract specific Appendix 6/2.
 6 (02/16) Where the excavation reveals a combination of acceptable and unacceptable materials the Contractor shall, unless indicated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 6/3, carry out the excavation in such a manner that the acceptable materials are excavated separately for use in the permanent works without contamination by the unacceptable materials. Unless otherwise described in the contract classes of fill material required to be deposited separately shall be excavated separately without contamination by other Classes of material.
 7 (02/16) The Contractor shall make his own arrangements for stockpiling of acceptable material, and unacceptable material to be processed, and for the provision of sites for the purpose.
 8 (02/16) The Contractor shall ensure that he does not adversely affect the stability of excavations or fills by his methods of stockpiling materials, use of plant or siting of temporary buildings or structures.
 9 (02/16) Existing topsoil material shall, except where it is to be left in place in the locations described in contract specific Appendix 6/8, be stripped to depths as described in contract specific Appendix 6/8 for Class 5A material from all areas of cutting and from all areas to be covered by embankment or by other areas of fill. Where stated in contract specific Appendix 6/8 existing topsoil shall be stripped as turf in accordance with subClause 3005.13.

Unless otherwise stated in contract specific Appendix 6/8, topsoil shall not be stockpiled for more than two years. Topsoil shall not be unnecessarily trafficked either before stripping or when in a stockpile. Stockpiles shall not be surcharged or otherwise loaded and multiple handling shall be kept to a minimum.
 11 (02/16) All Class 5A topsoil arising from the site, or any Class 5B material replacing Class 5A material in accordance with sub-Clause 3 of this Clause, in excess of the requirements for topsoiling, shall be subject to the requirements described in contract specific Appendix 6/8.
 12 (02/16) Excavations for foundations and trenches shall be adequately supported at all times, and except where otherwise described in contract specific Appendix 6/3, shall not be battered. Where excavations are permitted to be battered they shall be benched as described in contract specific Appendix 6/3 prior to backfilling and compaction. The additional work and materials shall be provided by the Contractor. Sheeting and other excavation supports shall be removed as filling proceeds except where they are required in contract specific Appendix 6/3 to be left in position.
 13 (02/16) Excavations requiring backfilling shall remain open only for the minimum period necessary.
 14 (02/16) Excavations requiring backfilling in existing paved or other surfaces, including those paved areas to be reconstructed or repaired, shall be carried out and reinstated in compliance with Clause 706.

 constructional plant and other vehicular traffic uniformly over them. Damage by constructional plant and other vehicular traffic shall be made good by the Contractor with material having the same characteristics and strength as the material had before it was damaged.
 5 (02/16) Embankments and other areas of unsupported fills shall not be constructed with steeper side slopes, or to greater widths than those described in contract specific Appendix 6/3, except to permit adequate compaction at the edges before trimming back, or to obtain the final profile following any settlement of the fill and the underlying material. However any oversteepening or increase in width shall not exceed any limits described in contract specific Appendix 6/3 and shall remain only for the minimum periods necessary consistent with the safety of the permanent works.
 6 (02/16) Staged construction of fills and any controlled rates of filling, shall be carried out, in accordance with any requirements described in contract specific Appendix 6/3 including installation of instrumentation and its monitoring, in compliance with Clause 629.
 7 (02/16) Where required in contract specific Appendix 6/3 the Contractor shall surcharge embankments or other areas of fill, as described therein for the periods stated. If settlement of surcharged fill results in any surcharging material, which is unacceptable for use in the fill being surcharged, lying below the formation or, where there is a capping, the subformation, the Contractor shall remove this unacceptable material and dispose of it in accordance with Clause 602. He shall then bring the resultant level up to formation or sub-formation, as appropriate, with acceptable material.
 8 (02/16) Where pipes in embankments or in other areas of fill are permitted in contract specific Appendix 5/1 to be constructed other than in a trench, the fill shall be brought up to and over them equally on both sides. The fill shall be deposited in even layers and shall not be heaped above the pipe. Spreading and compaction shall be carried out evenly without dislodging, distorting or damaging the pipe. Power rammers are not to be used within 300 mm of any part of the pipe or joint.
 9 (02/16) The last 600 mm depth of fill up to sub-formation level, or formation level as appropriate, shall, unless otherwise required in the Contract, be carried out for the full width of embankments, or between the outer extremities of the verges in other areas of fill, in a continuous operation. The Contractor shall then continue without delay to carry out either (i) or (ii) below:
 (i) form the sub-formation or formation, all in accordance with Clauses 613 and 616, following immediately either by:
 (a) the construction of the full thickness of capping or sub-base as appropriate; or
 (b)if permitted in contract specific Appendix 6/3, the construction of a lesser thickness of capping or sub-base as described therein laid as a weather protection layer;
 (ii) place an additional 300 mm minimum compacted thickness of material above sub-formation level or formation level as appropriate for the full width of the filling to form a weather protection. This weather protection shall be composed of the same material as the sub-formation or formation and compacted in compliance with Table 6/1. The material shall be provided from the Contractor's own resources and the protection layer shall be constructed in a continuous operation. For stabilised capping, the protective layer shall consist of unstabilised material.
 10 (02/16) During construction of embankments and other fills, exposed sides of Classes 2E and 7B pulverised-fuel ash material shall be protected against scour and erosion from any source.

 612 (02/16) Compaction of Fills
 (02/16) General
 1 (02/16) Except for dynamic compaction, which shall comply with Clause 630, and unless otherwise described in contract specific Appendix 6/3, the Contractor shall carry out compaction in compliance with this Clause, as soon as practicable after deposition, on all those Classes of fill in Table 6/1 which require to be compacted.
 2 (02/16) Compaction shall be either method or end-product as required for the Class of fill in Table 6/1, using plant appropriate to the Class of fill and the site conditions.
 3 (02/16) The Contractor shall obtain permission from the Overseeing Organisation before carrying out compaction outside normal working hours.
 (02/16) Method Compaction
 4 (02/16) Where method compaction is required to be adopted it shall comply with sub-Clauses 5 to 10 of this Clause.
 5 (02/16) Except as stated in sub-Clause 6 of this Clause, method compaction shall be undertaken using the plant and methods in Table 6/4 appropriate to the compaction requirements as listed in Table 6/1 for the Class of material being compacted.
 6 (02/16) Plant and methods not included in Table 6/4 shall only be used providing the Contractor demonstrates at site trials that a state of compaction is achieved by the alternative method equivalent to that obtained using the specified method.
 7 (02/16) Earthmoving plant shall not be accepted as compaction equipment nor shall the use of a lighter category of plant to provide any preliminary compaction to assist the use of heavier plant be taken into account when assessing the amount of compaction required for any layer.
 8 (02/16) If more than one Class of material is being used in such a way that it is not practicable to define the areas in which each Class occurs, the Contractor shall compact with plant operating as if only the material which requires the greater compactive effort is being compacted.
 9 (02/16) The Contractor or Overseeing Organisation may carry out field dry density tests as described in sub-Clause 15 of this Clause on material compacted to method requirements at a frequency defined in contract specific Appendix 6/3. If the results of field tests show densities which indicate the state of compaction to be inadequate, then if this is due to failure of the Contractor to comply with the requirements of the contract, the Contractor shall carry out such further work as is required to comply with the contract.
 10 (02/16) For the purposes of Table 6/4 the following shall apply:
 (i) The minimum number of passes N is the minimum number of times that each point on the surface of the layer being compacted shall be traversed by the item of compaction plant in its operating mode, or struck by power rammers or falling weight compactors. D is the maximum depth of the compacted layer.
 (ii) In column headed N # the number of passes shown is to be doubled for material Classes 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D when such materials occur within 600 mm of sub-formation (if capping is required) or formation. Such extra compaction shall, unless otherwise described in contract specific Appendix 6/3, either be carried out for the full width of the embankment or, in other areas of fill which are to receive a pavement, between the outer extremities of the verges.
 (iii) The compaction plant in Table 6/4 is categorised in terms of static mass. The mass per metre width of roll is the total mass on the roll divided by the total roll width. Where a smooth wheeled roller has more than one axle the category of the machine shall be determined on the basis of the axle giving the highest value of mass per metre width.
 (iv) A grid roller is a machine with a compacting roll or rolls constructed of heavy steel mesh of square pattern.

 (v) A deadweight tamping roller is a machine with a roll or rolls from which `feet' project and where the projected end area of each `foot' exceeds 0.01 m and the sum of the areas of the feet exceeds 15% of the area of the cylinder swept by the ends of the feet. The requirements for tamping rollers apply to machines that have 2 rolls in tandem. If only one tamping roll traverses each point on the surface of the layer on any one pass of the machine, the minimum number of passes shall be twice the number given in Table 6/4 plus any further doubling required to satisfy (ii) above.
 (vi) For pneumatic-tyred rollers the mass per wheel is the total mass of the roller divided by the number of wheels. In assessing the number of passes of pneumatic-tyred rollers the effective width shall be the sum of the widths of the individual wheel tracks together with the sum of the spacings between the wheel tracks provided that each spacing does not exceed 230 mm. Where the spacings exceed 230 mm the effective width shall be the sum of the widths of the individual wheel tracks only.
 (vii) A vibratory tamping roller, which may be self-propelled or towed, is a machine having a means of applying mechanical vibration to one or more rolls. The roll or rolls have projecting feet where the height of each foot exceeds 10% of the radius of the roll drum, the projected end area of each foot exceeds 0.1% of the roll drum surface area, and the sum of the areas of the feet exceeds 10% of the area of the cylinder swept by the ends of the feet.
 The requirements for the operation of vibratory tamping rollers shall be the same as those stated for vibratory rollers in sub-Clause (viii) except that vibratory tamping rollers operating without vibration will be classified as deadweight tamping rollers.
 (viii) Vibratory rollers are self-propelled or towed smooth-wheeled rollers having means of applying mechanical vibration to one or more rolls except that vibratory rollers employed for Method 5 compaction shall be single roll types.
 Vibratory rollers operating without vibration will be classified as smooth-wheeled rollers.
 The requirements for vibratory rollers are based on the use of the lowest gear on a self-propelled machine with mechanical transmission and a speed of 1.5 to 2.5 km/h for a towed machine, or a selfpropelled machine with hydrostatic transmission. If higher gears or speeds are used an increased number of passes shall be provided in proportion to the increase in speed of travel.
 Where the mechanical vibration is applied to two rolls in tandem, the minimum number of passes shall be half the number given in Table 6/4 for the appropriate mass per metre width of one vibrating roll but if one roll differs in mass per metre width from the other the number of passes shall be calculated as for the roll with the smallest value. Alternatively the minimum number of passes may be determined by treating the machine as having a single vibrating roll with a mass per metre width equal to that of the roll with the higher value.
 Vibratory rollers shall be operated with their vibratory mechanism operating only at the frequency of vibration recommended by the manufacturers. Where more than one amplitude setting is available and/ or a range of frequencies is recommended, the machine shall be operated at the maximum amplitude setting and at the maximum recommended frequency for that setting.
 Vibratory rollers shall be equipped or provided with devices indicating the frequency at which the mechanism is operating and the speed of travel. Both devices shall be capable of being read by an inspector alongside the machine.
 (ix) Vibrating-plate compactors are machines having a base-plate to which is attached a source of vibration consisting of one or two eccentrically weighted shafts and:
 (a) the mass per square metre of the base-plate of a vibrating-plate compactor is calculated by dividing the total mass of the machine in its working condition by its area in contact with compacted material;
 (b) vibrating-plate compactors shall be operated at the frequency of vibration recommended by the manufacturers. They shall normally be operated at travelling speeds of less than 1 km/h but if higher speeds are necessary the number of passes shall be increased in proportion to the increase in speed of travel.

 (x) Vibro-tampers are machines in which an engine-driven reciprocating mechanism acts on a spring system through which oscillations are set up in a base-plate.
 (xi) Power rammers are machines which are actuated by explosions in an internal combustion cylinder, each explosion being controlled manually by the operator.
 (xii) Dropping weight compactors are machines in which a dead weight is dropped from a controlled height using a hoist mechanism and they include self-propelled machines with mechanical traversing mechanisms capable of compacting soil in trenches and close to structures.
 (xiii) In the case of power rammers and dropping-weight compactors one pass will be considered as made when the compacting shoe has made one strike on the area in question.
 (xiv) For items marked * in the Method 3 column of Table 6/4 the roller shall be towed by track-laying tractors. Self-propelled rollers are unsuitable.
 (xv) Where combinations of different types or categories of plant are used, the following shall apply:
 (a) the depth of layer shall be that for the type of plant requiring the least depth of layer; and
 (b) the number of passes shall be that for the type of plant requiring the greatest number of passes.
 (02/16) End-product Compaction
 11 (02/16) Where end-product compaction is required it shall comply with sub-Clauses 12 to 15 of this Clause.
 12 (02/16) The Contractor shall at least 7 days before commencement of end-product compaction make available the following to the Overseeing Organisation:
 (i) the values of maximum dry density and the optimum moisture content obtained in accordance with BS 1377: Part 4 using the 2.5 kg rammer method or vibrating hammer method as appropriate for each of the fills he intends to use which meet the requirements of the permitted Class or Classes (where within any Class of material the fill contains material having different maximum dry densities and optimum moisture contents the Class shall be further sub-divided, by extending the identification system, in order to monitor the compacted density);
 (ii) a graph of density plotted against moisture content from which each of the values in (i) above of maximum dry density and optimum moisture content were determined and, for Class 7A material, a plot of the 5% air voids curve for each sub-division.
 13 (02/16) Once the information contained in sub-Clause 12 of this Clause has been made available to the Overseeing Organisation it shall form the basis for compaction.
 14 (02/16) Fill compacted to end-product requirements shall have a field dry density, measured in accordance with sub-Clause 15 of this Clause, equal to or greater than the percentage given in Table 6/1 of the maximum dry density for the relevant Class of fill previously made available to the Overseeing Organisation in accordance with subClause 12 of this Clause.
 15 (02/16) The field dry density referred to in sub-Clause 14 of this Clause shall be measured in accordance with BS 1377: Part 9, except that nuclear methods shall only be used where required or permitted in contract specific Appendix 6/3. Where nuclear methods are used, the gauge shall be calibrated in accordance with BS 1377: Part 9.

Each element shall be formed of one or more layers of the same capping material, each of compacted thickness complying with Clause 612. Class 9D or 9E stabilised capping material shall not be placed or constructed above Class 6F granular capping material or Class 6S granular filter layer material.
 4 (02/16) Where required in contract specific Appendix 6/7, before commencing the construction of capping in the permanent works, the Contractor shall demonstrate the methods, equipment and materials he proposes to use by constructing an area, or areas as appropriate, of capping on a typical prepared sub-formation to the same thickness as required in the permanent works. The area of each capping construction demonstration shall be not less than 700 m.
 5 (02/16) The materials placed during the demonstration may form part of the permanent works, provided they meet the requirements of the contract, or be carried out elsewhere on the site where this is detailed in contract specific Appendix 6/7. After completion of each demonstration area the Contractor shall within a period of not greater than 5 days and before commencing the main construction of the appropriate capping in the permanent works, carry out tests on each demonstration area and provide the Overseeing Organisation with records substantiating compliance with the stipulated criteria of contract specific Appendix 6/7. Where required by contract specific Appendix 6/7 the Contractor shall provide sheeting, to protect the demonstration area.
 6 (02/16) The demonstration area shall, if it does not meet the requirements for the permanent works or is located elsewhere on site, be removed and the area reinstated in accordance with contract specific Appendix 6/7.
 7 (02/16) The methods and materials used in the accepted demonstration shall not be changed during the course of the works without the construction of a further demonstration where such demonstrations are required by contract specific Appendix 6/7.
 8 (02/16) Unless otherwise stated in contract specific Appendix 6/7, the sub-formation shall have the same longitudinal gradient, crossfall and surface level tolerances as the formation.
 9 (02/16) The Contractor shall limit any unprotected area of sub-formation, which is to receive capping to suit the output of the plant in use and the rate of deposition of capping.

The field dry density and moisture content shall be determined at the position of each plate loading test in accordance with Clause 612 and BS 1377: Part 2 or equivalent, respectively.
 3 (02/16) When using the plate loading test to determine M* of the material existing on site a smooth surface shall be prepared by careful hand excavation and the plate bedded onto the soil using either sand or quick setting gypsum plaster depending on whether the soil is granular or cohesive.
 4 (02/16) The loading test shall be carried out under a series of maintained loads. The maximum load shall be such that the average pressure applied to the plate is in excess of 350 kN/m. The elastic modulus Es shall be determined as the secant modulus between average pressures applied to the plate of 150 and 350 kN/m in the first load cycle. A value of Poisson's ratio of 0.3 shall be assumed. A second load cycle testing shall also be conducted and the results of this test compared with the first load cycle to check that the plate was seated satisfactorily during the first load cycle. If the results of the first load cycle suggest that the plate was not seated satisfactorily, then the procedure shall be repeated at a new location. Second load cycle results shall not be used to demonstrate the adequacy of the material being tested.

 5 (02/16) The constrained soil modulus M* shall be determined from the elastic modulus Es using the equation:
 
 
 
 (1  v)Es
 
 M* =
 
  (N/mm2)
 
 
 
 (1 + v)(1  2v)
 
 where v = Poisson's ratio to be taken as 0.3
 
 and Es = Elastic modulus of the soil (N/mm2)
 
 (02/16) Standard Penetration resistance Tests
 
 6 (02/16) The constrained soil modulus M* of non-cohesive materials existing on site shall be determined from the relationship:
 
  M* =
 
 
 0.39N1.4  (N/mm2)
 m
 
 Where N = uncorrected SPT value and m = 1.3
 
 (02/16) One-dimensional Consolidation Tests
 
 7 (02/16) The constrained soil modulus M* of undrained cohesive materials existing on site shall be determined from the formula:
 
 
 
 1
 
 M* =
 
  (N/mm2)
 
 
 
 mv
 
 where mv (mm2/N) is the coefficient of volume compressibility
 
 The value of mv to be used in the formula is that calculated from the test results for the loading increment in the consolidation test corresponding to the in situ effective overburden pressure at the level of the crown of the
 structure.
 
 (02/16) Number of Tests
 
 8 (02/16) Three tests for M* shall be carried out on the soil occurring on each side of the structure, one of which is to be at the level of the maximum span, unless otherwise described in contract specific Appendix 6/1.
 
 643 (02/16) Lime and Cement Stabilisation to Form Capping
 1 (02/16) Where capping is to consist of, either wholly or in part, lime and cement stabilised material Class 9E or 9F, this Clause shall apply to the construction of those parts which are stabilised with lime and cement.
 2 (02/16) Material to be stabilised with lime and cement shall be Class 6R or 7I material all complying with Clause 601 and Table 6/1.
 3 (02/16) The form of lime used for lime and cement stabilisation shall be as required in contract specific Appendix 6/7, the lime shall conform to BS EN 459-1 and meet the performance requirements stated in contract specific Appendix 6/7.

 6 (02/16) Classes 6R and 7I material to be stabilised shall have added to it, at any point, the percentage of its dry weight of lime and cement as determined on the demonstration area, to meet the required bearing ratio in contract specific Appendix 6/1, subject to a minimum of 1% by weight of `available lime' and 2% cement as a percentage of the dry weight of the 6R and 7I materials.
 7 (02/16) The Contractor shall not carry out lime and cement stabilisation when the shade temperature is below 3C unless on a rising thermometer above 0C. Lime and cement stabilisation shall not be carried out during periods of rain or when rain is imminent. When cement is spread on material likely to cause premature hydration, processing in accordance with sub-Clause 16 of this Clause shall follow immediately.
 8 (02/16) Lime of quantity complying with sub-Clause 6 of this Clause shall be uniformly spread by an approved spreading machine on top of the layer to be stabilised. Using a collecting tray and balance the Contractor shall check the rate of spread by weight, once for every 500 m2 of lime spread or a different rate of testing for the rate of spread as described in contract specific Appendix 6/7. At the same time the Contractor shall collect samples of lime deposited on the tray and test them for available lime content in accordance with Clause 641.
 9 (02/16) Unless indicated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 6/7, the material shall be stabilised in a single layer if its compacted thickness is 250 mm or less. If its compacted thickness is greater, the material shall be stabilised in layers not less than 130 mm and not more than 250 mm thick, including any cutting-in required by sub-Clause 13 of this Clause.
 10 (02/16) Unless indicated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 6/7, the material forming the layer to be stabilised shall be processed by pulverising and mixing in the lime by means of sufficient number of passes of an approved mobile stabilising machine until 95% of the Class 9E or 95% of the silt and clay fraction of Class 9F processed material passes a BS 28 mm sieve after dry sieving and the pulverisation complies with Table 6/1.
 11 (02/16) During processing sufficient water shall be available in the material to slake the quicklime (if used) and to enable satisfactory mixing and compaction to be achieved. Any added water shall be through an integral spraybar on the stabilising machine. Any added water shall have a sulfate content not exceeding 1400 mg/l as SO4 when tested in accordance with BS EN 1774-1 clause 10.
 12 (02/16) The layer shall receive at least two passes of the stabilising machine to pulverise and mix the lime and soil, after which the processing shall be interrupted by a period of not less than 24 hours and not greater than 72 hours to enable the lime to react with the soil. Before this period commences the surface of the layer shall be sealed with one pass of a smooth wheeled roller having a mass per metre width of roll of not less than 2700 kg or a pneumatic tyred roller of not less than 1000 kg per wheel. At the end of this period the layer shall receive one further pass of the stabilising machine or more if required to enable the material to comply with sub-Clauses 10 of this Clause.
 13 (02/16) The stabilising machine shall be equipped with a device for controlling the depth of processing which shall be maintained at the correct setting at all times. An overlap of 150 mm shall be made between adjacent passes of the stabilising machine. Where a subsequent layer of material is placed on a layer previously stabilised the tines or blades of the stabilising machine shall be set so that they cut into the previously stabilised layer below by at least 20 mm.
 14 (02/16) The appropriate quantity of cement shall be uniformly spread, by a suitable spreading machine, on top of the layer previously processed with lime. Using a collecting tray and balance the Contractor shall check the rate of spread of the machine once for every 500 m2 of cement spread.
 15 (02/16) Unless indicated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 6/7, the material previously mixed with lime shall be stabilised with cement in a single layer or in layers of the same compacted thickness as for the lime mixed material layers, including any cutting-in required by sub-Clause 13 of this Clause.
 16 (02/16) Unless indicated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 6/7, the material forming the layer to be stabilised shall be processed by pulverising and mixing in the cement by means of a sufficient number of passes of an approved mobile stabilising machine until 95% of the silt and clay fraction is reduced to particles or lumps passing a BS 28 mm sieve after dry sieving and the pulverisation complies with Table 6/1.

 17 (02/16) During processing, sufficient water shall be available in the material to hydrate the cement and enable satisfactory mixing and compaction to be achieved. Any added water shall be through an integral spray-bar on the stabilising machine. Any added water shall have a sulfate content not exceeding 1400 mg/l as SO4 when tested in accordance with BS EN 1774-1 clause 10.
 18 (02/16) The stabilising machine shall be equipped with a device for controlling the depth of processing which shall be maintained at the correct setting at all times. An overlap of 150 mm shall be made between adjacent passes of the stabilising machine. Where a subsequent layer of material is placed on a layer previously stabilised the tines or blades of the stabilising machine shall be set so that they cut into the previously stabilised layer below by at least 20 mm.
 19 (02/16) Each layer of Class 9E or 9F processed material shall be compacted as soon as possible after the final pass of the stabilising machine. Compaction shall be completed within 2 hours following the mixing of the cement into the material to be stabilised. Immediately before compaction Class 9E processed material shall have a Moisture Condition Value (MCV) of not greater than 12 nor less than the figure stated in contract specific Appendix 6/1 both as determined in accordance with Clause 632. Water shall be added if necessary in a uniform manner to enable this MCV requirement to be met. Any added water shall have a sulfate content not exceeding 1400 mg/l as SO4 when tested in accordance with BS EN 1774-1 clause 10.
 20 (02/16) The compaction of each layer of Class 9E or 9F material shall comply with Clause 612, Table 6/4 Method 7, except that if layers of Class 9E or 9F greater than 250 mm thickness are to be constructed, the number of passes of the compaction plant shall be determined from the results of a demonstration area as detailed in contract specific Appendix 6/7.
 21 (02/16) Class 9E and 9F materials shall be cured in accordance with Clause 1035. During periods when the air temperature is forecast to drop below 3C or when ground frost is forecast Class 9E and 9F material shall be protected, to prevent freezing, for a period of 7 days from the time of completion of compaction. Such protection shall be sealed to prevent the ingress of moisture.
 22 (02/16) Class 9E and 9F materials shall not have other material deposited or compacted above them until such time as the required bearing ratio in contract specific Appendix 6/1 has been achieved. The relaxation allowed in sub-Clause 617.2 shall not apply before this time.
 
 644 (02/16) Determination of Sulfate Content
 1 (02/16) Where required in Table 6/1 or contract specific Appendix 6/1, the effects of water-soluble sulfate, oxidisable sulfides and total potential sulfate shall be assessed in accordance with BS EN 1744-1 clauses 10, 11 and 13.
 2 (02/16) Test results and limiting values for sulfate shall be given as SO4.
 3 (02/16) At least five samples of each material shall be tested for WS, OS and TPS. The mean of the highest two values shall be used for comparison with the limiting values.

 NOTES:
 
 1 (02/16) A method of calculating the Microbial Activity Index may be obtained by reference to TRRL Contractor Report 54 `Soil Corrosivity Assessment'.
 2 (02/16) The corrosion potential of frictional fill shall be assessed from resistivity, pH, chloride, water soluble sulfate and oxidisable sulfides tests. For cohesive soil it will be necessary to test additionally for organic content. Should either organic content or sulfate be in excess of the specified levels, then tests shall also be included for Redox Potential and Microbial Activity Index.
 3 (02/16) The water soluble sulfate content and oxidisable sulfides content shall be determined in accordance with the methods described in BS EN 1744-1 clause 10, 11 and 13.
 
 4 (02/16) Methods of test (except for Microbial Activity Index, water soluble sulfate content and oxidisable sulfides content) are given in BS 1377: Part 3.

 ROAD PAVEMENTS  GENERAL
 
 700 (02/16) General
 1 (02/16) This Series is part of the Specification for Highway Works. Whilst this Series is particularly relevant to the subject matter in its title it must be read in conjunction with the general requirements in Series 000 and 100 and with all other Series relevant to the specification for the particular works to be undertaken.
 
 701 (02/16) Pavement Construction
 1 (02/16) Road pavements shall be constructed from one of the permitted options described in contract specific Appendix 7/1 and in compliance with this Series and the appropriate Clauses of Series 800, 900 and 1000.
 2 (02/16) The Contractor shall, in his choice of permitted materials for subbases and bases, have regard to the nature of those materials and of the subgrade or any capping and the need to protect them from deterioration due to the ingress of water, the adverse effects of weather and the use of constructional plant. The Contractor shall programme the laying and compaction of the subbase and the subsequent pavement courses and take such other steps as may be considered necessary, to afford protection to the base, subbase and subgrade.
 
 #702 (02/16) Horizontal Alignments, Surface Levels and Surface Regularity of Pavement Courses Horizontal Alignments
 1 (02/16) Horizontal alignments shall be determined from one edge of the pavement surface as described in contract specific Appendix 1/12. The edge of the pavement as constructed and all other parallel alignments shall be correct within a tolerance of 25 mm therefrom, except for kerbs and channel blocks which shall be laid with a smooth alignment within a tolerance of 13 mm. Longitudinal road markings lateral tolerance shall be in accordance with sub-Clause 1212.20.
 (02/16) Surface Levels of Pavement Courses
 2 The design levels of pavement courses shall be calculated from the vertical profile, crossfalls and the pavement course thicknesses described in contract specific Appendix 7/1. The level of any point on the constructed surface of the pavement courses shall be the design level subject to the appropriate tolerances stated in Table 7/1.
 TABLE 7/1: (02/16) Tolerances in Surface Levels of Pavement Courses
 
 Road surfaces -- general -- adjacent to a surface water channel* Binder course * Base * Subbase under concrete pavement surface slabs laid full thickness in one operation by machines with surface compaction Subbases other than above

  10 mm + 10  30 mm
 
 * Where a surface water channel is laid before the adjacent road pavement layer the top of that layer, measured from the top of the adjacent edge of the surface water channel, shall be to the tolerances given in Table 7/1.
 
 3 (02/16) Notwithstanding the tolerances permitted in surface levels of pavement courses, the cumulative tolerance shall not result in a reduction in thickness of the pavement, excluding the subbase, by more than 15 mm from the specified thickness nor a reduction in the thickness of the bituminous surface course by more than 5 mm from that specified.
 
 Amendment  February 2016

 Volume 1 Specification for Highway Works
 
 Series 700 Road Pavements  General
 
 4 (02/16) For checking compliance with sub-Clause 2 of this Clause, measurements of the surface levels of all courses will be taken on a grid of points located as described in contract specific Appendix 7/1. In any length of pavement, compliance shall be deemed to be met for all surfaces, other than the final road surface, when not more than one of ten consecutive measurements taken longitudinally or one in any transverse line, exceeds the tolerances permitted in Table 7/1, provided that this one measurement shall not exceed by more than 5 mm the tolerance for the course concerned. For the final road surface the tolerance given in Table 7/1 shall apply to any point on that surface.
 
 (02/16) Surface Regularity
 
 5 (02/16) The longitudinal regularity of the surfaces of surface courses, binder courses and concrete slabs shall be such that the number of surface irregularities is within the relevant limits stated in Table 7/2.
 
 An irregularity is a variation of not less than 4 mm or not less 7 mm of the profile of the road surface as measured by the rolling straight-edge set at 4 mm or 7 mm as appropriate, or equivalent apparatus capable of measuring irregularities within the same magnitudes over a 3 m length. No irregularity exceeding 10 mm shall be permitted.
 
 6 (02/16) Prior to checking any final road surface, binder course or top surface of base in pavements without binder course for level, regularity or macrotexture depth, it shall be cleaned of loose or extraneous materials. These operations shall be carried out without damaging the surface of the pavement, as soon as possible and within 3 days of construction of the pavement.
 
 7 (02/16) Compliance with Table 7/2 shall be checked by the rolling straight-edge along any line or lines parallel to the edge of pavement on sections of 300 m at regular intervals as stated in contract specific Appendix 7/1, whether or not it is constructed in shorter lengths. Sections shorter than 300 m forming part of a longer pavement shall be assessed using the number of irregularities for a 300 m length pro-rata to the nearest whole number.
 
 Where the total length of pavement is less than 300 m, the measurements shall be taken on 75 m lengths.
 
 8 (02/16) Pavements shall be measured transversely for irregularities at regular intervals as stated in contract specific Appendix 7/1, by a 3 m long straight-edge in accordance with BS 8420 placed at right angles to the centre line of the road. The maximum allowable difference between the pavement surface and the straight-edge shall be 3 mm.
 
 9 (02/16) A straight-edge 3 metres long, shall be used to check longitudinal surface regularity in the following cases:
 
 (i) for lengths of less than 75 m of surface course, binder course and concrete slabs;
 
 (ii) where use of the rolling straight-edge or equivalent apparatus is impracticable;
 
 (iii) for all lengths of subbase under concrete pavement slabs laid full thickness in one operation by machine with surface compaction.
 
 The maximum allowable difference between the surface and the underside of the straight-edge, when placed parallel with, or at right angles to, the centre line of the road shall be:

 (02/16) Rectification
 
 10 (02/16) Where any pavement area does not comply with the specification for regularity, surface tolerance, thickness, macrotexture depth, material properties or compaction, the full extent of the area which does not comply with the specification shall be made good and the surface of the pavement course shall be rectified in the manner described below:
 (i) Unbound and hydraulically bound materials
 The top 75 mm shall be scarified, reshaped with material added or removed as necessary, and recompacted. The area treated shall be not less than 20 m long and 2 m wide. For hydraulically bound materials, all rectification shall be completed within 48 hours of the binder being added to the material.
 (ii) Cement bound subbases and bases
 The method of correction will depend on the period which has elapsed between detection of the error and the time of mixing of the material. If this is less than 4 hours, the surface shall be scarified to a depth of not less than 50 mm, surplus material removed or freshly mixed material added as necessary, and re-compacted in accordance with the specification. If the period is 4 hours or more the full depth of the layer shall be removed from the pavement and replaced with material in accordance with the specification. In either case the area treated shall be at least 5 m long and the full width of the paving laid in one operation. If the Contractor proposes rectification within 7 days of laying he shall comply with Clause 1048. Alternatively, for subbases under concrete pavements the Contractor may make up low areas to a level within the tolerances of this Clause with a 1:4 cement and sand mortar or with an AC4 fine surface course complying with Clause 914.
 (iii) Bituminous bases
 With coated macadam or asphalt bases, the full depth of the top layer as laid shall be removed and be replaced with fresh material laid and compacted in accordance with the specification. Any area so treated shall be at least 5 m long and the full width of the paving laid in one operation. Alternatively for low areas in bituminous bases, the Contractor may make up the level with additional binder course material.
 (iv) Surface courses and binder courses
 These shall have the full depth of the course removed and replaced with fresh material laid and compacted in accordance with the specification.
 The area rectified shall be the full width of the paving laid in one operation, and at least 5 m long if binder course, or 15 m if surface course.
 Where the number of surface irregularities exceeds the limits in Table 7/2, the area to be rectified shall be 300 m or 75 m long as appropriate and the full width of the lanes affected, or such lesser length as necessary to make the number of surface irregularities conform with the limits and shall be the full width of the lanes affected.

 Checking of the surface course for compliance with this Clause shall be carried out as soon as possible after completion of the surfacing and remedial works completed before the road is opened to traffic.
 Where the macrotexture depth requirement is not met for:
 (a) a section 1000 m in lane length; or
 (b) the full lane length of a section less than 1000 m long as the balance of a complete scheme; or
 (c) the full lane length of a scheme less than 1000 m long;
 then sufficient 50 m lengths shall be replaced, starting with that length having the least macrotexture depth, until the average requirement for the section length is complied with.
 A minimum length of 50 m and the full lane width shall be removed and replaced either:
 (a) to the full depth of the surface course; or
 (b) to a depth of 20 mm when replaced by the repave method process in compliance with Clause 926.
 Areas to be removed shall be delineated both longitudinally and transversely by saw cutting prior to the material being removed. Joints shall be formed either by coating the exposed sawn face with hot bitumen or heating by a suitable heater. The heater shall raise the temperature of the full depth of the course immediately before laying the new material to a figure within the range of minimum rolling temperature and maximum temperature at any stage specified for the material and for a width of not less than 75 mm.
 (v) Concrete slabs
 Concrete slabs shall be rectified by planing, grinding or bump cutting. Large depressions, which cannot be dealt with in this way, shall be rectified by cutting out the surface and replacing by a thin bonded surface repair complying with Clause 1032.
 Retexturing of hardened concrete shall be carried out by sawing grooves in accordance with the specification. Texturing of replaced surfaces shall be by brushing in accordance with the specification. Where the slab cannot be rectified as above, the full depth of slab shall be removed and replaced with a slab constructed in compliance with Clause 1033 to the extent required to obtain compliance with the specification. Remedial works involving the placing of fresh concrete shall be completed in sufficient time for the concrete strength to have developed as required in Clause 1048, before that section of pavement is opened to traffic.

 (02/16) Excavations
 3 (02/16) Excavations in existing pavements and other paved areas, except those described in sub-Clause 4 of this Clause, including surfacing, base and subbase, shall be cut to neat lines to dimensions at least 75 mm greater on each side than the dimensions of any further excavation below formation level. Excavations in capping shall be taken at least 75 mm outside the dimensions of any excavation below. Road surfacing of bituminous material shall be cut back by sawing or planing to a further 75 mm on each side. Planing shall be carried out in accordance with Clause 709. Concrete surfacing and concrete bases, except CBM, shall be cut back by sawing by at least 300 mm on each side to the level of any reinforcement in reinforced slabs and to the full depth of the slab in unreinforced slabs.
 If excavations are required to inspect the condition of lower layers, each layer shall be excavated separately and cleaned of debris to permit inspection.
 4 (02/16) Concrete blocks, clay pavers and precast concrete flags, kerbs and channels shall be lifted without cutting, to the nearest joint satisfying sub-Clause 3 of this Clause and carefully stored for re-use or dealt with as described in contract specific Appendix 2/3. In situ kerbs and channels shall be broken out to at least 150 mm beyond the excavation.
 (02/16) Reinstatement of Paved Areas
 5 (02/16) For roads designed to carry traffic loading of 125 msa or less, reinstatements of openings in highways shall comply with the `Specification for the Reinstatement of Openings in Highways' issued by the Highway Authorities and Utilities Committee.
 The same requirements shall apply for roads designed to carry traffic loading of more than 125 msa except where otherwise stated in the appropriate Clauses of the Specification for Highway Works including the contract specific requirements of Appendix 7/2.
 6 (02/16) Where foamed concrete is used for the reinstatement of openings in roads carrying more than 30 msa, the requirements of the foamed concrete shall comply with Clause 1043.
 7 (02/16) Immediately before bituminous layers are reinstated, the edges of the existing material shall be cleaned of all loose material and be coated with an appropriate hot bituminous binder, or equivalent treatment. Where joints in concrete slabs are affected by the excavation they shall be reinstated by cutting back to at least 0.5 m on each side of a transverse joint and forming an expansion joint on one side of the excavation and a contraction joint on the other and provide longitudinal joints where necessary in the same line before reinstatement in compliance with Series 1000 to match the existing construction.
 (02/16) Reinstatement of Other Areas
 8 Where the excavation affects grassed areas, unpaved footpaths, footways, verges and bridleways they shall be reinstated to match the existing surface, after backfilling with acceptable material described in contract specific Appendix 7/2 to a depth of not less than 150 mm below the finished surface.
 (02/16) Junctions Between New Pavement Construction and Existing Pavement or Other Paved Areas
 9 (02/16) Where new pavement construction abuts an existing bituminous pavement which has to be reduced in level or overlaid to match alignment and levels, the existing surface shall be trimmed by the minimum amount of cold-milling (planing) to a depth which will allow the specified thickness of new construction to be laid, the edge being trimmed and treated in compliance with this Clause. Where the difference in level makes it necessary, a regulating course as described in contract specific Appendix 7/1 and specified in Clause 907 shall be provided. The locations of areas to be trimmed are given in contract specific Appendix 7/2.
 10 (02/16) Junctions between concrete pavements and between concrete and bituminous pavements shall be constructed as described in contract specific Appendix 7/2.

 2 (02/16) Prior to the commencement of any saw-cutting operations, any existing asphalt overlay and surfacing shall be removed from the area to be treated under this Clause to the full width of each lane up to the adjoining longitudinal joint(s) unless directed otherwise by the Overseeing Organisation. Removal of any overlay shall be completed ahead of the works at a distance of not less than 50 m from the saw-cutting operation. The Contractor shall also ensure that adequate reference location marks based on the Overseeing Organisation's chainage have been clearly marked and agreed with the Overseeing Organisation for purposes of accurately recording progress and the locations of changes to equipment settings.
 3 (02/16) Before any of the main saw-cut and crack and seat work is commenced, a main trial shall be carried out as specified in sub-Clause 21 of this Clause. After the main trial, the Contractor shall locate all bay joints, repair joints and any existing transverse cracks and shall pre-plan and mark the positions of the intended transverse sawcuts using the transverse saw-cut spacing determined from the main trial. If the Contractor foresees any difficulty in complying with this sub-Clause, he shall immediately inform the Overseeing Organisation and shall not proceed with saw-cutting in such areas until he has received appropriate instructions from the Overseeing Organisation.
 4 (02/16) Unless directed otherwise by the Overseeing Organisation, cracking and seating operations shall not take place unless there is adequate side restraint in place from the adjacent verge(s) and central reserve assisted by any temporary works which may be necessary.
 5 (02/16) Compliance with this Clause shall be assessed by (i) examining the concrete surface for spalling, (ii) examining the depth and severity of cracking and the depth of saw-cuts by means of core extraction, (iii) measuring the spacing of saw-cuts, and (iv) recording the number of passes of the seating roller. Where required in contract specific Appendix 7/15, the effective stiffness modulus and/or joint efficiency of the cracked concrete layer or layers will be calculated from Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) measurements. The Overseeing Organisation may then instruct any variation required in the spacing of saw-cuts and/or method and pattern of cracking and/or subsequently confirm or otherwise the thickness of overlay required.
 6 (02/16) The sequence of operations shall be: (i) pre-planning and marking of the positions of intended transverse saw-cuts, (ii) saw-cutting of the concrete pavement at the spacing and depths specified in contract specific Appendix 7/15, (iii) verification of saw-cut depths, (iv) inducing transverse cracks, (v) extracting cores, and (vi) seating. The observation of the surface crack pattern and examination of the cores shall be carried out in daylight or under sufficient artificial light provided by the Contractor to the satisfaction of the Overseeing Organisation. Where FWD measurements are specified in contract specific Appendix 7/15, these will follow the seating operation and shall be made by the Contractor in accordance with Clause 718 unless stated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 7/15. Processing and analysis of the FWD results shall be performed by the Contractor in accordance with Clause 719 unless stated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 7/15. The road shall be neither overlaid nor re-opened to highway traffic without the Overseeing Organisation's written confirmation that his interpretation of the FWD measurements is complete and that the condition of the treated pavement is in accordance with the design requirements.
 7 (02/16) If, for reasons other than those in sub-Clauses 27 and 28 of this Clause, it either (i) becomes necessary for the Contractor to change any plant, equipment and/or method or (ii) the Contractor makes unplanned use of different or additional plant, he shall carry out a Special Trial which shall be so named but otherwise shall be in accordance with sub-Clauses 33 to 35 of this Clause.
 (02/16) Saw-cutting of Concrete Pavement
 8 (02/16) Transverse saw-cutting of the concrete pavement shall be carried out to comply with this Clause including the particular requirements in contract specific Appendix 7/15.
 9 (02/16) The position of all saw-cuts shall be clearly marked by the Contractor on the surface of the concrete prior to cutting. The spacing of saw-cuts to be used for the main trial in sub-Clauses 21 to 24 of this Clause shall be as specified in contract specific Appendix 7/15. No saw-cuts shall be made within the distance stated in contract specific Appendix 7/15 from an existing transverse joint or crack. The saw-cuts shall be made at the marked positions and shall be transverse to the longitudinal axis of the carriageway and within the tolerances specified in contract specific Appendix 7/15.

 10 (02/16) The depth of all saw-cuts shall be measured from the top surface of the concrete pavement slab. The minimum depth of saw-cuts shall be just sufficient to cut completely through the longitudinal steel reinforcement but this depth shall in no circumstances exceed 50% of the nominal depth of the concrete pavement layer. When such a saw-cut fails to fully cut through the reinforcing steel, the cracking operation shall not proceed within 5 m of the incompletely cut bar. This fact shall be recorded by the Contractor who shall report it to the Overseeing Organisation as soon as practicable. This report shall be confirmed within 18 hours. Saw-cutting shall also cease immediately and not re-commence on the same slab until so instructed by the Overseeing Organisation. If there has been any over-cutting, this shall be remedied in accordance with sub-Clause 31 of this Clause.
 11 (02/16) Each saw-cut, and the carriageway surface adjacent to it, shall be thoroughly cleaned of the slurry produced by sawing and any other detritus prior to cracking.
 (02/16) Cracking
 12 (02/16) Induced cracking of existing pavement layer or layers shall be carried out to comply with this Clause including the particular requirements in contract specific Appendix 7/15.
 13 (02/16) Transverse cracks at the positions of the saw-cuts shall be induced by suitable plant with a guillotine action capable of delivering controlled variable pre-set impact loads to the concrete surface. The plant used to crack the concrete pavement layer or layers shall be self-propelled and have all wheels fitted with rubber tyres. The compressive strength of the existing concrete shall be provided by the Overseeing Organisation in contract specific Appendix 7/15. The Contractor shall keep records of (i) the settings to his plant and equipment, (ii) the chainage and (iii) the time at which each and every adjustment is made to the plant and equipment. Such records shall be in accordance with the pro forma in contract specific Appendix 7/17 for the `Cracking Plant and Equipment Progress Record' and shall be available on demand for inspection by the Overseeing Organisation. Cracks shall be induced in the concrete underlying the saw-cut by one strike of the impacting head of such plant. The Contractor shall take suitable measures to ensure that the plant and impact head are of sufficient mass and geared to prevent both head bounce and any associated surface damage arising therefrom. The impact force shall be adjustable to achieve the cracking specified and the minimum force consistent with no damage to either the saw-cut or to the adjoining concrete surface. Excessive impact forces which cause multiple cracking or shattering of the underside of the concrete slab, or to the underlying or adjacent layers, shall not be permitted. If such damage does occur, the Contractor shall carry out remedial measures in accordance with sub-Clause 31 of this Clause.
 14 (02/16) The induced cracks shall extend from the bottom of the concrete slab to the base of the saw-cut and shall be predominantly vertical. They shall extend the full width of each concrete bay. The generation of longitudinal cracks is undesirable and those produced within the highway traffic wheel track zones of length greater than the longitudinal spacing of the saw-cuts specified in contract specific Appendix 7/15 or derived from a Main Trial shall constitute a failure under sub-Clause 31 of this Clause.
 15 (02/16) Where the full width of any existing pavement layer cannot be cracked transversely with one pass of the crack inducing plant further parallel passes shall be made as necessary so that all subsequent transverse cracks are aligned with those from the preceding pass within the tolerances specified in contract specific Appendix 7/15.
 16 (02/16) The Contractor shall adjust his equipment and methods so that (i) full depth fine vertical cracks in the concrete layer or layers are obtained, (ii) shattering of the concrete at the surface and/or at the bottom of the slab is avoided, and (iii) treated areas are rendered suitable for overlaying, to the satisfaction of the Overseeing Organisation. The cracking operation shall not proceed more than 100 metres beyond the last accepted core in the assessment under sub-Clause 29 of this Clause. Cracking shall not commence on a given saw-cut until it has been cut over its entire width to the appropriate depth in accordance with this Clause.
 (02/16) Coring
 17 (02/16) The Contractor shall take cores in accordance with sub-Clauses 22, 29, 30 and 32 of this Clause and with contract specific Appendix 7/15 at locations selected by the Overseeing Organisation. All holes from which core samples have been extracted shall be filled with new hydraulically bound material equivalent to that in the surrounding pavement and adequately compacted in layers each not exceeding 50 mm thickness.

 (02/16) Seating
 18 (02/16) Following cracking, all the cracked pavement layer shall be seated with a multi-wheeled pneumatictyred roller with a weight of not less than 20 tonnes compliant with contract specific Appendix 7/15 and with the number of passes specified in contract specific Appendix 7/15. The load including any ballast shall be distributed uniformly over all the wheels. The drive gear shall provide a progressive, variable speed, forward and reversing capability. Such compaction plant shall have articulating wheels on both front and rear axles. The wheel arrangement shall provide an overlap of not less than 40 mm with the adjacent wheels. The internal pressure of the tyres shall be adjustable to provide variable ground contact pressure (GCP). The Contractor shall certify in an agreed form on a daily basis the exact extent of work completed under this sub-Clause and shall deliver each such certificate to the Overseeing Organisation before noon the next day.
 19 (02/16) Where voids under the pavement permit rocking at the ends of the slab(s) that is not remedied by the seating operation under sub-Clause 18 of this Clause, this shall be deemed to be unstable seating. This shall require additional parallel saw-cuts followed by cracking at suitable positions sufficient to enable stable seating to be achieved to the satisfaction of the Overseeing Organisation.
 20 (02/16) Once saw-cutting and cracking and seating and any remedial work under sub-Clause 31 of this Clause have been completed, the pavement shall be prepared to Clause 920 before overlay.
 (02/16) Main Trial Area
 21 (02/16) The Contractor shall demonstrate that the plant, equipment and method that he proposes for the sawcut and cracking and seating of the existing concrete layer or layers are capable of producing the required depth of saw-cut and required type of cracks. This shall be demonstrated by first executing a main trial over an area neither less than 250 m2 nor greater than 420 m2 of existing pavement. The location and area of the trial shall be as directed by the Overseeing Organisation, and shall include a length of the most heavily trafficked lane. The Contractor shall demonstrate that the saw-cutting and cracking operation can achieve consistent compliance with this sub-Clause and with sub-Clauses 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 22 of this Clause and with contract specific Appendix 7/15. If the road pavement to be treated contains known areas where there are significant differences in the concrete thickness or the concrete strength or in the conditions of the reinforcement or foundations, then a main trial shall be conducted in each such area. The locations of pre-existing transverse cracks within the Main Trial shall be recorded by the Contractor. The work on the main trial length shall proceed as follows:
 (i) Saw-cutting and cracking shall proceed in stages as directed by the Overseeing Organisation. Each Stage that is cracked and seated shall be assessed in accordance with sub-Clause 22 of this Clause.
 (ii) Stage 1 of the main trial shall be on 1 no. slab. The Contractor shall set up his plant and equipment and demonstrate that he can produce the required pattern and quality of saw-cuts and transverse cracks in accordance with this Clause including contract specific Appendix 7/15. This shall be assessed in accordance with sub-Clause 22 of this Clause.
 (iii) In Stage 2 and any subsequent Stage of the main trial, a length encompassed by 6 no. saw-cuts shall be cracked starting from one end to produce transverse cracks at the saw-cut spacing stated in contract specific Appendix 7/15. For each Stage, the settings of the cracking plant and equipment shall be recorded in accordance with the pro forma in contract specific Appendix 7/17. The cracked pavement shall then be seated in accordance with the method in sub-Clauses 18 and 22(v) of this Clause.
 (iv) Seating: After cracking, the pavement shall be seated with the number of passes of the roller specified in contract specific Appendix 7/15 as described in sub-Clause 18 of this Clause.
 (02/16) Assessment of Main Trial
 22 (02/16) Compliance with the saw-cutting and the cracking and seating requirements for the main trial shall be assessed as follows:
 (i) The depths of the saw-cutting shall be checked by the Contractor before cracking.
 (ii) The spacing of transverse saw-cuts will be checked by the Contractor before cracking.

 Series 700 Road Pavements  General
 
 (iii) The surface cracking patterns shall be checked by the Overseeing Organisation either before or after seating by the Contractor.
 (iv) The depth of the saw-cut and the depth and vertical direction of cracking shall be determined by coring through the full depth of the concrete pavement layer or layers symmetrically at any transverse position along the length of the saw-cut. Core diameter shall be in accordance with contract specific Appendix 7/15. In Stage 1 the Contractor may select the number and position of cores to be taken. In Stage 2 and in subsequent Stages of the main trial, the number of cores shall be in accordance with Table 7/3, with not less than one core taken from alternate saw-cuts. These shall be at locations selected by the Overseeing Organisation. If the depth of saw-cut exceeds the specified depth, or if any shattering or multiple cracking is present in the extracted core then it is deemed to require remedial work in accordance with sub-Clause 31 of this Clause.
 (v) The Contractor's seating certificates required under sub-Clause 18 of this Clause will be checked by the Overseeing Organisation. If the number of roller passes required for seating is not in accordance with sub-Clause 18 of this Clause, the Contractor shall roll the entire area again in accordance with sub-Clause 18 of this Clause with not less than the number of passes of the roller specified in contract specific Appendix 7/15.
 23 (02/16) Where required in contract specific Appendix 7/15, FWD testing of effective stiffness modulus shall be performed before saw-cutting and after seating in Stage 2 and any subsequent Stages of the main trial. The FWD testing shall be performed by the Contractor in accordance with Clause 718, unless stated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 7/15, both (i) before cracking and (ii) after seating in accordance with this Clause. Unless stated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 7/15, the Contractor shall perform the processing and analysis of the FWD measurements in accordance with Clause 719 and will present the results to the Overseeing Organisation for interpretation and instruction. The Contractor shall remove all debris from the cracked pavement in the main trial lengths before FWD measurements are made. Saw-cutting of Stage 2 or subsequent Stages of the Main Trial shall not commence until the Overseeing Organisation has interpreted the analysed FWD measurements undertaken before cracking and has confirmed or otherwise the suitability of the area selected for the Main Trial.
 (02/16) Consent to the Method and Acceptance of the Main Trial
 24 (02/16) The Contractor shall not proceed with the main work until the Overseeing Organisation has given its consent that the plant, equipment and methods used in the main trial length comply with the requirements in Table 7/3. Consent to use the plant equipment and methods of saw-cutting and cracking and seating will be given by the Overseeing Organisation following a successful demonstration in the main trial that the saw-cutting and the cracking and seating complies with the requirements of this Clause and that the effective stiffness modulus of the cracked and seated pavement and/or underlying foundation derived from FWD testing meets the design criteria. When consent by the Overseeing Organisation to the method has been given, the plant, equipment and methods shall not be changed thereafter without the prior consent of the Overseeing Organisation except for normal adjustment and maintenance of plant. Should it be necessary for the Contractor to otherwise change any plant, equipment and/or method the Contractor may be required to carry out a further main trial Stage.
 (02/16) Main Production Work
 25 (02/16) The saw-cutting and cracking operation for the main production work shall proceed using the parameters as determined from the Main Trial or from any relevant subsequent Saw-cutting and Cracking Re-Assessment Trial. The seating operation shall be completed by rolling the pavement with the number of passes specified in contract specific Appendix 7/15. The main work shall be assessed in accordance with sub-Clause 29 of this Clause. As required in contract specific Appendix 7/15, the Contractor shall make allowance in his programme for FWD measurements of effective stiffness modulus which will be made by the Contractor according to Clause 718 after seating in accordance with this Clause, unless stated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 7/15. The Contractor will perform the processing and analysis of the FWD measurements in accordance with Clause 719, unless stated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 7/15, and will present the results to the Overseeing Organisation for interpretation and instruction. The Contractor shall remove all debris from the cracked pavement before FWD measurements are made.

 26 (02/16) The Contractor shall be responsible for the continuous observation of the operation. The location of pre-existing transverse cracks shall be recorded by the Contractor. Should the results vary from those to which consent was given in the main trial, or from any relevant subsequent Saw-cutting and Cracking Re-Assessment Trail, with the consent of the Overseeing Organisation the Contractor shall adjust the plant and equipment and/or saw-cut depth in order to produce the agreed results. The new settings of the plant and equipment shall be recorded by the Contractor, together with the location at which it was changed. These particulars shall be delivered to the Overseeing Organisation within 24 hours of the changes being completed. If the agreed surface crack pattern is not restored within 20 m production cracking shall cease in accordance with sub-Clause 6 of this Clause. A Saw-cutting and Cracking Re-Assessment Trial shall then be carried out in accordance with sub-Clauses 33 to 35 of this Clause before any further production saw-cutting and cracking and seating work is executed.
 27 (02/16) The depth of saw-cutting shall be measured before cracking. If the depth is not within the depth as specified in contract specific Appendix 7/15 the saw-cutting shall cease. If the saw-cut is too shallow it shall be recut until it is within tolerance. If the saw-cut is too deep it shall be deemed non-compliant under sub-Clause 22(iv) of this Clause. The saw-cut depth shall be brought within tolerance for subsequent cuts.
 28 (02/16) The depth of the saw-cutting and the depth and quality of the induced cracks shall be monitored by inspection of extracted cores. If there has been any non-compliance with sub-Clause 22(iv) of this Clause, production saw-cutting and cracking shall cease immediately. The extent of the area affected shall be determined as specified in sub-Clause 32 of this Clause.
 (02/16) Assessment of the Main Production Work
 29 (02/16) Compliance with the saw-cutting and the cracking and seating requirements shall be assessed during the main work in accordance with the following criteria:
 (i) The spacing and depths of transverse saw-cuts will be monitored by the Overseeing Organisation.
 (ii) The surface pattern of cracking of all areas that have been cracked and seated shall be checked by the Contractor and will be monitored by the Overseeing Organisation.
 (iii) The depth of saw-cut and the depth and the vertical direction of cracking through the full depth of the concrete pavement layer or layers shall be determined symmetrically at the saw-cut position. Core diameter shall be in accordance with contract specific Appendix 7/15. The minimum frequency for coring of saw-cut and cracked and seated concrete is specified in contract specific Appendix 7/15.
 (iv) The seating shall be assessed in accordance with sub-Clause 22(v) of this Clause.

 or any combination of these, then the following remedial measures shall be taken. The size of the affected area shall be determined and the rejected section(s) shall be broken out, excavated to full depth and reinstated with equivalent material, unless otherwise instructed by the Overseeing Organisation. The positions of the highway traffic wheel tracks to which reference is made in this Clause shall be as defined in sub-Clause 903.21. If the number of roller passes required for seating is less than the number of passes specified in contract specific Appendix 7/15 at each and every point on the pavement, then the Contractor shall roll the entire area again with not less than the number of passes of the roller specified in contract specific Appendix 7/15, unless otherwise instructed by the Overseeing Organisation.
 32 (02/16) The extent of shattering or multiple cracking or the extent to which the depth of the saw-cut is outside the specified tolerance shall be determined by extracting and inspecting cores. Such cores shall be taken through a saw-cut within the area between the position of the crack-inducing plant and the last core in which the saw-cutting and cracking complied with the requirements of sub-Clause 29 of this Clause. The extent of longitudinal cracking in the highway traffic wheel tracks shall be determined by visual inspection.
 (02/16) Saw-cutting and Cracking Re-assessment Trial
 33 (02/16) When in the opinion of the Overseeing Organisation the conditions so require, a saw-cut and cracking re-assessment trial shall take place. The re-assessment trial described in this sub-Clause and in sub-Clauses 7, 26, 34 and 35 of this Clause shall require the Contractor to demonstrate that the plant, equipment and method to which consent was given by the Overseeing Organisation for use in the main production work are capable of producing the required effective stiffness modulus in the existing concrete layer or layers by executing this trial over an area of neither less than 75 m2 nor greater than 120 m2 of existing pavement. The location of the trial shall be as directed by the Overseeing Organisation. The saw-cut spacing(s) shall be as directed by the Overseeing Organisation within the tolerances specified in contract specific Appendix 7/15. The Contractor shall demonstrate that the saw-cutting and the cracking operations can achieve consistent compliance with sub-Clause 29 of this Clause. The saw-cutting and cracking re-assessment trial length shall be seated with the number of roller passes specified in contract specific Appendix 7/15.
 Where FWD measurements are required by contract specific Appendix 7/15 the Contractor shall make programme allowance for these which shall be made by the Contractor according to Clause 718 before sawing and after cracking in accordance with this Clause, unless stated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 7/15. Unless stated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 7/16, the Contractor shall perform the processing and analysis of the FWD measurements in accordance with Clause 719 and shall present the results to the Overseeing Organisation for interpretation and instruction. The Contractor shall remove debris from the cracked pavement in the re-assessment trial length before FWD measurements are made. The production cracking re-assessment trial length shall be seated with the number of passes of the roller specified in contract specific Appendix 7/15.
 (02/16) Assessment of Saw-cutting and Cracking Re-assessment Trial
 34 (02/16) Compliance with the saw-cutting and cracking and seating requirements for the saw-cutting and cracking re-assessment trial shall be assessed in accordance with sub-Clauses 22 and 23 above.

 716 (02/16) Cracking and Seating of Existing Jointed Unreinforced Concrete Pavements and Hydraulically Bound Mixture (HBM) Bases
 (02/16) General
 1 (02/16) Where shown on the drawings listed in contract specific Appendix 7/16, the existing unreinforced hydraulically bound pavement layer or layers shall be cracked and seated with plant and equipment to which the Overseeing Organisation's consent has been given, and shall comply with this Clause. The treated surface shall be then be prepared in accordance with Clause 920 and tack or bond coated in accordance with contract specific Appendix 7/4 prior to overlaying where specified in contract specific Appendix 7/1.
 2 (02/16) Prior to the commencement of any operations to induce cracks, any existing asphalt overlay and surfacing shall be removed from the area to be treated for the full width of each lane up to the adjacent longitudinal joints unless directed otherwise by the Overseeing Organisation. Removal of any overlay shall be completed ahead of the works at a distance of not less than 50 m from the cracking operation. The Contractor shall also ensure that adequate reference marks based on the Overseeing Organisation's chainage have been clearly marked and agreed with the Overseeing Organisation for purposes of accurately recording progress and locations of changes to equipment settings.
 3 (02/16) Before any of the main crack and seat work is commenced, a main trial shall be carried out in accordance with sub-Clauses 17 to 20 of this Clause. After the main trial, the Contractor shall locate all bay joints and repair joints, or existing cracks in the concrete pavement or HBM, and shall pre-plan and mark the positions of the intended induced cracks at these locations using the transverse crack spacing determined from the main trial. If the Contractor foresees any difficulty in complying with this sub-Clause, he shall immediately draw this to the attention of the Overseeing Organisation and shall not proceed with cracking in such areas until he has received appropriate instructions from the Overseeing Organisation.
 4 (02/16) Cracking and seating operations shall not take place unless there is adequate side restraint in place from the adjacent verge(s) and central reserve assisted by any temporary works which may be necessary. All cracking and seating operations shall be completed before the commencement of any excavation which, in the opinion of the Overseeing Organisation, would remove adequate side restraint in the adjacent verge(s) and/or central reserve.
 5 (02/16) Compliance with this Clause shall be assessed by (i) examining the generated crack pattern on the surface of the jointed concrete or HBM base layer, (ii) examining the depth and severity of cracking by means of core extraction, (iii) measuring the spacing of the induced cracks, and (iv) recording the number of passes of the seating roller. The effective stiffness modulus of the cracked hydraulically bound layer or layers and underlaying foundation will be calculated from Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) measurements. The Overseeing Organisation may then instruct any variation required in the method and pattern of cracking or subsequently confirm or otherwise the thickness of overlay required.
 6 (02/16) The sequence of operations for the main production work shall be: (i) where necessary, pre-planning and marking of the positions of induced transverse cracks, (ii) application of clean water to assist examination of the crack pattern, (iii) inducing transverse cracks, (iv) observation of the surface crack pattern, (v) extracting cores and (vi) seating. The observation of the surface crack pattern and examination of the cores shall be carried out in daylight or under sufficient artificial light provided by the Contractor to the satisfaction of the Overseeing Organisation. FWD measurements will follow the seating operation and shall be performed by the Contractor in accordance with Clause 717 unless stated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 7/16. Processing and analysis of the FWD results shall be performed by the Contractor in accordance with Clause 719 unless stated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 7/16. The road shall be neither overlaid nor re-opened to highway traffic without the Overseeing Organisation's written confirmation that the Overseeing Organisation has completed its interpretation of the FWD measurements and that the condition of the treated pavement is in accordance with the design requirements.
 7 (02/16) Once the main crack and seat operation has commenced, its efficacy shall be kept under review by the Contractor in accordance with sub-Clauses 21 to 25 of this Clause. If, due to variations in the strength or other physical characteristics of the hydraulically bound pavement layer or of the foundation or otherwise, the crack pattern varies from that confirmed in the main trial, the equipment shall be adjusted as described in sub-Clauses 10 and 22 of this Clause to produce the required crack pattern. If the crack pattern obtained in the main trial is not
 
 Amendment  February 2016

 Volume 1 Specification for Highway Works
 
 Series 700 Road Pavements  General
 
 re-established within 4 bays for jointed unreinforced concrete pavements, or within 20 m for HBM bases, then production cracking shall stop immediately. The Contractor shall report such circumstances to the Overseeing Organisation orally within 1 hour and confirm it in writing within 2 hours. A production cracking re-assessment trial shall then be carried out in accordance with sub-Clauses 28 to 30 of this Clause before any further cracking and seating work is executed at the relevant area.
 8 (02/16) If, for reasons other than those in sub-Clause 22 of this Clause, it either (i) becomes necessary for the Contractor to change any plant, equipment and/or method or (ii) the Contractor makes unplanned use of different or additional plant, he shall carry out a Special Trial which shall be so named but otherwise shall be in accordance with sub-Clauses 28 to 30 of this Clause.
 (02/16) Cracking
 9 (02/16) Induced cracking of existing pavement layer or layers shall be carried out to comply with this Clause including the particular requirements in contract specific Appendix 7/16.
 10 (02/16) Transverse cracks at the required spacing shall be induced by suitable plant with a guillotine action capable of delivering variable pre-set impact loads to the concrete surface. The plant used to crack the hydraulically bound pavement layer or layers shall be self-propelled and have all wheels fitted with rubber tyres. The compressive strength of the existing concrete shall be provided by the Overseeing Organisation in contract specific Appendix 7/16. The required spacing of cracks for the main trial in sub-Clauses 17 to 20 of this Clause shall be as specified in contract specific Appendix 7/16. The required spacing thereafter shall be as confirmed by the Overseeing Organisation on completion of the main trial. The Contractor shall keep records of (i) the settings to his plant and equipment, (ii) the crack spacing, (iii) the chainage and (iv) the time at which each and every adjustment is made to the plant and equipment. Such records shall be in accordance with the pro forma in contract specific Appendix 7/17 for the `Cracking Plant and Equipment Progress Record' and shall be available on demand for inspection by the Overseeing Organisation. Cracks shall be induced by one strike of the impacting head of such plant without producing undue surface shatter. The plant and impact head shall be of sufficient mass and geared to prevent both head bounce and any associated surface damage arising therefrom. The impact force shall be adjustable to achieve the cracking specified using the minimum force consistent with no surface shatter. Excessive impact forces which cause multiple cracking or shattering of the underside of the concrete slab, or to the underlying or adjacent layers shall not be permitted. If such damage does occur, the Contractor shall carry out remedial measures in accordance with sub-Clauses 26 or 27 of this Clause, as appropriate.
 11 (02/16) The induced cracks shall be predominantly vertical and shall be transverse to the direction of the road. They shall extend the full width of each concrete bay or the lane width of a HBM base. The generation of longitudinal cracks is undesirable and those produced within the highway traffic wheel track zones of length greater than the spacing of the induced transverse cracks shall constitute a failure under Clause 26 of this Clause.
 12 (02/16) Where the full width of any existing pavement layer cannot be cracked transversely with one pass of the crack inducing plant further parallel passes shall be made as necessary so that all subsequent transverse cracks are aligned with those from the preceding pass within the tolerances specified in contract specific Appendix 7/16.
 13 (02/16) The Contractor shall be responsible for (i) adjusting his equipment and methods so that the requisite crack pattern is maintained, (ii) producing full depth fine vertical cracks in the hydraulically bound layer or layers, and (iii) rendering treated areas suitable for overlaying, to the satisfaction of the Overseeing Organisation. For all trials and for all production cracking operations the Contractor shall provide clean water and shall saturate the surface area of the pavement which is to be cracked. The surface shall be allowed to dry naturally or shall be dried artificially so that it becomes surface dry before visual inspection is made of the induced crack pattern. The cracking operation shall not proceed more than 100 metres beyond the last accepted core in the assessment under sub-Clause 23 of this Clause.
 (02/16) Coring
 14 (02/16) The Contractor shall take cores in accordance with sub-Clauses 18, 23, 24, and 27 of this Clause and with contract specific Appendix 7/16 at locations selected by the Overseeing Organisation. All holes from which core samples have been extracted shall be filled with new hydraulically bound material equivalent to that in the surrounding pavement and adequately compacted in layers each not exceeding 50 mm thickness.

 Volume 1 Specification for Highway Works
 
 Series 700 Road Pavements  General
 
 (02/16) Seating
 15 (02/16) Following cracking, all of the cracked pavement layer shall be seated with a multi-wheeled pneumatictyred roller with a weight specified in contract specific Appendix 7/16 and with the number of passes specified in contract specific Appendix 7/16. The load including any ballast shall be distributed uniformly over all the wheels. The drive gear shall provide a progressive, variable speed, forward and reversing capability. Such compaction plant shall have articulating wheels on both front and rear axles. The wheel arrangement shall provide an overlap of not less than 40 mm with the adjacent wheels. The internal pressure of the tyres shall be adjustable to provide variable ground contact pressure (GCP). The Contractor shall certify in an agreed form on a daily basis the exact extent of work completed under this sub-Clause and shall deliver each such certificate to the Overseeing Organisation before noon the next day.
 16 (02/16) Once cracking and seating and any remedial work under sub-Clause 26 of this Clause have been completed, the pavement shall be prepared to Clause 920 before overlay.
 (02/16) Main Trial
 17 (02/16) The Contractor shall demonstrate that the plant, equipment and method that he proposes for the cracking and seating of the existing hydraulically bound layer or layers are capable of producing the required type and pattern of cracks. This shall be demonstrated by first executing a main trial over an area of neither less than 250 m2 nor greater than 420 m2 of existing pavement. The location of the trial shall be as directed by the Overseeing Organisation and shall include a length of the most heavily trafficked lane. The Contractor shall demonstrate that the cracking operation can achieve consistent compliance with this sub-Clause and with sub-Clauses 10 and 18 of this Clause and with contract specific Appendix 7/16. If the road pavement to be treated contains known areas where there are differences in the concrete thickness or strength or in the foundation conditions, then a main trial shall be conducted in each such area. The locations of pre-existing transverse cracks within the area of the Main Trial shall be recorded by the Contractor. The work on the main trial length shall proceed as follows:
 (i) Cracking shall proceed in stages as directed by the Overseeing Organisation in groups of four to six bays in jointed concrete pavements, or in lengths of 20 m for HBM bases. Each group that is cracked and seated shall be assessed in accordance with sub-Clause 18 of this Clause.
 (ii) In Stage 1 of the main trial the Contractor shall set up his plant and equipment and demonstrate that he can produce the required pattern and quality of transverse cracks in accordance with this Clause including contract specific Appendix 7/16. This shall be assessed in accordance with sub-Clause 18 of this Clause.
 (iii) In Stage 2 and each subsequent Stage of the main trial, a group of four bays in jointed concrete pavements, or a length of 20 m for HBM bases, shall be cracked starting from one end to produce transverse cracks at each of the spacings stated in item 5(i) of contract specific Appendix 7/16. For each Stage, the settings of the cracking plant and equipment shall be recorded in accordance with the pro forma in contract specific Appendix 7/17.
 (iv) Seating: After cracking in both Stage 1 and Stage 2, the pavement shall be seated with the number of roller passes specified in contract specific Appendix 7/16 and as described in sub-Clause 15 of this Clause.
 (02/16) Assessment of Main Trial
 18 (02/16) Compliance with the cracking and seating requirements for the main trial shall be assessed as follows:
 (i) The surface pattern of cracking shall be checked before seating but after applying clean water and allowing to dry as specified in sub-Clause 13 of this Clause.
 (ii) In Stage 1 of the main trial, the induced crack pattern shall be inspected by the Contractor. In Stage 2 and in subsequent Stages, visual inspection of the crack pattern shall be made by the Overseeing Organisation.
 
 Amendment  February 2016
 
 22
 
 Volume 1 Specification for Highway Works
 
 Series 700 Road Pavements  General
 
 (iii) In Stage 2 and in subsequent Stages of the main trial, the spacing of transverse cracks will be monitored by the Overseeing Organisation.
 (iv) The depth and the vertical direction of cracking shall be determined by coring through the full depth of the hydraulically bound pavement layer symmetrically at the crack position. Core diameter shall be in accordance with contract specific Appendix 7/16. In Stage 2 and in subsequent Stages of the main trial, the number of cores shall be in accordance with Table 7/4. In cases where cracks are not visible in the surface, the locations of cores will be generally within the impact points and transversely in line with the impact points. If any shattering or multiple cracking is present in the extracted core then there is deemed to have been `shattering failure'.
 (v) The Contractor's certificates required under sub-Clause 15 of this Clause will be checked by the Overseeing Organisation. If the number of roller passes required for seating is not in accordance with sub-Clause 15 of this Clause, the Contractor shall roll again the entire area in accordance with subClause 15 of this Clause and with not less than the number of roller passes specified in contract specific Appendix 7/16.
 19 (02/16) The Contractor shall make allowance in his programme for the undertaking of FWD measurements which will be performed by the Contractor in accordance with Clause 717, unless stated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 7/16, both (i) before cracking and (ii) after seating in accordance with this Clause. Unless stated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 7/16, the Contractor shall perform the processing and analysis of the FWD measurements in accordance with Clause 719 and shall present them to the Overseeing Organisation for interpretation and instruction. The Contractor shall remove all debris from the cracked pavement in the main trial lengths before FWD measurements are made. Cracking of Stage 2 or subsequent Stages of the Main Trial shall not commence until the Overseeing Organisation has interpreted the analysed FWD measurements undertaken before cracking and has confirmed or otherwise the suitability of the area selected for the Main Trial.
 (02/16) Consent to the Method and Acceptance of the Main Trial
 20 (02/16) The Contractor shall not proceed with the main crack and seat work until the Overseeing Organisation has given its consent that the plant, equipment and methods used in the main trial length comply with the requirements in Table 7/4. Consent to the plant equipment and methods of cracking and seating will be given by the Overseeing Organisation following a successful demonstration in the main trial that the cracking and seating complies with the requirements of this Clause and that the effective stiffness modulus of the cracked and seated pavement and/or underlying foundation derived from FWD testing meets the design criteria. When consent by the Overseeing Organisation to the method has been given, the plant, equipment and methods shall not be changed thereafter without the prior consent of the Overseeing Organisation except for normal adjustment and maintenance of plant. Should it be necessary for the Contractor to otherwise change any plant, equipment and/or method the Contractor may be required to carry out a further main trial Stage.
 (02/16) Main Production Work
 21 (02/16) The cracking operation for the main production work shall proceed at the crack spacing determined after the main trial, or from any relevant subsequent production cracking re-assessment trial. The seating operation shall be completed by rolling the pavement for the number of passes specified in contract specific Appendix 7/16. The main production work shall be assessed in accordance with sub-Clause 24 of this Clause. The Contractor shall make allowance in his programme for FWD measurements which will be made by the Contractor according to Clause 717 after seating in accordance with this Clause, unless stated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 7/16. The Contractor will perform the processing and analysis of the FWD measurements in accordance with Clause 719, unless stated otherwise in contract specific Appendix 7/16, and will present the results to the Overseeing Organisation for interpretation and instruction. The Contractor shall remove all debris from the cracked pavement before FWD measurements are made.
 22 (02/16) The surface pattern of cracking shall be checked after applying water as specified in sub-Clause 13 of this Clause. The Contractor shall be responsible for the continuous observation of the crack pattern. The location of pre-existing transverse cracks shall be recorded by the Contractor. If without the prior agreement of the Overseeing Organisation the crack spacing on the main work is shorter than that specified following the

 main trial, the Contractor shall so notify the Overseeing Organisation in not less than 2 hours. Should the crack pattern vary from that to which consent was given in the main trial, or from any relevant subsequent production cracking re-assessment trial, with the consent of the Overseeing Organisation the Contractor shall adjust the plant and equipment in order to produce the agreed crack pattern. The new settings of the plant and equipment shall be recorded by the Contractor, together with the chainage at which the settings were changed. These particulars shall be delivered to the Overseeing Organisation within not more than 24 hours of the changes being completed. If the agreed crack pattern is not restored within 4 bays in jointed concrete pavements or within 20 m in HBM bases production cracking shall cease in accordance with sub-Clause 7 of this Clause. A production cracking reassessment trial shall then be carried out in accordance with sub-Clauses 28 to 30 of this Clause before any further production cracking and seating work is executed.
 23 (02/16) The depth and quality of the induced cracks shall be monitored by inspection of extracted cores. If there has been `shattering failure' in accordance with sub-Clause 18(iv) of this Clause, production cracking shall cease immediately. The extent of the area affected shall be determined as specified in sub-Clause 27 of this Clause.
 (02/16) Assessment of the Main Production Work
 24 (02/16) Compliance with the cracking and seating requirements shall be assessed during the main work in accordance with the following criteria:
 (i) The spacing of transverse cracks shall be checked by the Contractor and will be monitored by the Overseeing Organisation.
 (ii) The surface pattern of cracking of all areas that have been cracked shall be checked after applying water as specified in sub-Clause 13 of this Clause.
 (iii) The depth and the vertical direction of cracking shall be determined through the full depth of the hydraulically bound pavement layer or layers symmetrically at the crack position. Core diameter shall be in accordance with contract specific Appendix 7/16. Not less than one core shall be extracted in every 300 m2 of cracked concrete at locations selected by the Overseeing Organisation. In cases where cracks are not visible in the surface, the locations of cores will be generally in line with the impact points.
 (iv) The seating shall be assessed in accordance with sub-Clause 18(v) of this Clause.
 (02/16) Acceptance of the Main Production Work
 25 (02/16) The main production work under this Clause shall be accepted when it complies fully with the requirements of this Clause and with Table 7/4.
 (02/16) Failure to Comply and Remedial Work
 26 (02/16) The results of the crack and seat operations for any jointed unreinforced concrete slab, or any 5 m length of HBM base, shall be rejected if it fails to comply with any of the criteria in sub-Clause 23 of this Clause. If:
 (i) shattering or multiple cracking of hydraulically bound material occurs within the extracted core; or
 (ii) the length of any longitudinal cracks in the highway traffic wheel track zones are in excess of the specified crack spacing of the induced transverse cracks;
 (iii) the transverse crack spacing determined for the particular portion of the work is outside the tolerance specified in contract specific Appendix 7/16;
 or any combination of these, then the following remedial measures shall be taken. The size of the affected area shall be determined and the rejected section(s) shall be broken out, excavated to full depth and reinstated with equivalent material, unless otherwise instructed by the Overseeing Organisation. The positions of the wheel track zones to which reference is made in this Clause shall be as defined in sub-Clause 903.21.

 717 (02/16) Monitoring of Cracked and Seated Jointed Unreinforced Concrete Pavements and HBM Bases using the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD)
 (02/16) General
 1 (02/16) This Clause specifies the procedures to be followed when the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) is to be used to acquire the measurements required to determine the load-spreading properties of cracked and seated concrete as required by Clause 716. Specifically, the FWD shall be used to validate whether the effective stiffness modulus of the cracked and seated hydraulically bound layer or layers exceeds the threshold value determined from the structural design calculations. The type of equipment is specified together with the procedures for its use on site and the parameters to be used to acquire the deflection data. The effective stiffness moduli of the cracked and seated hydraulically bound layer or layers and of the underlying foundation shall be calculated by the Contractor using back-analysis of the FWD measurements obtained by the Contractor in accordance with Clause 719.
 2 (02/16) FWD measurements shall be made on the surface of the concrete after the removal of any existing asphalt overlay or surfacing from the area to be tested. Removal of overlay shall be completed ahead of the FWD testing at a distance of not less than 100 m from the FWD equipment. The cracking and seating operation shall be completed ahead of the FWD testing at a distance of not less than 100 m from the FWD equipment in order to minimise the effect of pavement vibration. FWD measurements shall follow the seating operation. The Contractor shall ensure that a sufficient frequency of clearly-marked locational reference markers have been put in place to the satisfaction of the Overseeing Organisation for the purpose of accurately recording the locations of the FWD measurements and therefore correlating the results with the settings used by the cracking plant.
 3 (02/16) The Overseeing Organisation will use the effective stiffness moduli obtained from the main trial in accordance with Clause 719 in conjunction with the other criteria specified in sub-Clause 17 of Clause 716 to determine the required transverse crack spacing to be used in the main production work.
 4 (02/16) The Overseeing Organisation may instruct any variation required in the method and pattern of cracking or subsequently confirm or otherwise the suitability of the proposed thickness of overlay required as a result of the effective stiffness modulus of the cracked and seated hydraulically bound layer or layers determined from FWD measurements.
 5 (02/16) The road shall be neither overlaid nor re-opened to highway traffic without the Overseeing Organisation's written confirmation that the FWD measurements have been assessed and any required remedial action taken.
 (02/16) Measuring Equipment
 6 (02/16) Any FWD used to monitor the effectiveness of the cracking and seating operation as specified in this Clause and in Clause 716 shall have the current appropriate certification before it can be used on the Overseeing Organisation's network.
 7 (02/16) Evidence of a satisfactory absolute calibration by the equipment manufacturer and consistency checks by the operator shall be provided as required by the Overseeing Organisation. The absolute calibration of the deflection sensors, load cell and system processor shall be carried out annually. Consistency checks of the dynamic response of the machine as a whole should take place at intervals of six weeks or less during periods of operation and after any major service involving replacement parts.
 8 (02/16) For the monitoring of the crack and seat operation on jointed unreinforced concrete pavements and on HBM bases, the load level shall be set at 50kN  10%. The load pulse shall be applied through a 300mm diameter plate and have a rise time from start of pulse to peak of between 5 and 15 milliseconds. Most FWDs have a 60 Hz smoothing filter option which has been shown to improve the agreement between machines. Where available the smoothing filter shall be activated. Deflections shall be measured to a resolution of at least 1 micron over the range 0-2mm by a minimum of 7 sensors situated at radii up to a distance of 2.25m from the centre of the loading plate at positions shown in Table 7/5. While more than 7 geophones can be fitted to an FWD, Clause 719 requires that the data input to the approved back-analysis software program shall contain measurements only from the geophones located at the positions shown in Table 7/5.

 (02/16) Operation on Site
 
 9 (02/16) FWD testing shall not be performed while standing water is present on the surface to be tested.
 10 (02/16) The Contractor shall ensure that there is no detritus on the road surface prior to the FWD testing. Care shall be taken to ensure that the whole area of the FWD loading plate is in contact with the pavement surface. A minimum of 3 drops, plus a small initial drop for settling the load plate, should be made at each test point. The Contractor shall make checks for machine consistency during the survey and before analysis.

 11 (02/16) During FWD testing, it is essential for subsequent analysis that the deflection values (for d1 to d7) decrease as the distance from the applied load increases. Should the deflection measured by a geophone of a higher number (see Table 7/5) be greater than the deflection measured by a geophone of lower number, then the FWD shall be moved forwards or backwards by a small distance and the measurement cycle repeated. If it is not possible to obtain a decreasing deflection bowl after two shifts of position, then the measurement should be discarded and the Overseeing Organisation informed of the location of the test position for possible further investigation. Measurements of pavement temperature at 100 mm depth should be recorded at no less than hourly intervals.
 
 (02/16) Main Trial Area Testing
 
 12 (02/16) In Stage 2 and subsequent Stages of a Main Trial, FWD measurements shall be made both before and after cracking to determine the reduction in the effective stiffness modulus of the concrete produced by the cracking and seating operation. Stage 2 and subsequent Stages shall consist of an area as described in sub-Clause 17 of Clause 716. The area of concrete to be tested shall be adequately marked to enable FWD testing to be performed on the same locations both before and after cracking and seating.
 13 (02/16) On jointed concrete pavements, FWD measurements shall be made along the centre line of the bays. For each crack spacing specified in contract specific Appendix 7/15, the location of the centre of the loading plate for the first measurement shall be 1 m beyond the transverse joint at the start of a bay with all the geophones located within the bay. Subsequent measurements shall be made at intervals of 0.5 m along the centre line of the slab up to and including the centre of the slab. Test positions coincident with transverse cracks shall be omitted and the location of the crack recorded by the Contractor. For each measurement, the location of the FWD loading plate shall be adequately recorded so that the position of each measurement can be clearly identified.
 14 (02/16) On HBM bases, FWD measurements shall be made along the centre line of each traffic lane unless this alignment coincides with a longitudinal shrinkage or construction crack, in which case the measuring line shall be shifted towards the nearside wheelpath until the FWD test plate is not located within 0.5 m of a longitudinal crack. The location of the centre of the loading plate for the first measurement shall be 1m past the start of the test area for the Stage. Subsequent measurements shall be made at intervals of 1 m along the centre line of the lane until the outer geophone d7 (see Table 7/5) is outside the other end of the test area for the Stage. Test positions coincident with transverse cracks shall be omitted and the location of the crack recorded by the Contractor. For each measurement, the location of the FWD loading plate shall be adequately recorded such that the position of each measurement can be clearly identified.
 15 (02/16) After completion of the FWD measurements on the Main Trial, the deflection data and layer thickness details derived from cores taken in accordance with Clause 716, and supplemented by Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) measurements when required by contract specific Appendix 7/16, shall be used by the Contractor to calculate effective stiffness moduli of the pavement layers in accordance with Clause 719. The moduli values shall be supplied to the Overseeing Organisation who will determine the required transverse crack spacing to be used in the main production with reference to the other criteria specified in sub-Clause 17 of Clause 716. For jointed unreinforced concrete pavements, the analysis will also provide the location on each bay where FWD measurements shall be made following production cracking and seating in the main works.

 Series 700 Road Pavements  General
 
 (02/16) Consent to the Results of the FWD Measurements on the Main Trial
 16 (02/16) The Contractor shall not proceed with the main production cracking works until the Overseeing Organisation has specified the transverse crack spacing and given its consent that the effective stiffness modulus of the cracked and seated concrete exceeds the threshold value required by the structural design.
 17 (02/16) Consent to the plant, equipment and methods will be given by the Overseeing Organisation following a successful demonstration in the main trial that the cracking and seating complies with the requirements of Clause 716 and this Clause. When consent by the Overseeing Organisation to the method has been given, the plant, equipment and methods shall not be changed thereafter without the prior consent of the Overseeing Organisation except for normal adjustment and maintenance of plant. Should it be necessary for the Contractor to otherwise change any plant, equipment and/or method, the Contractor shall carry out a further main trial Stage.
 (02/16) Main Production Work Testing
 18 (02/16) The cracking operation for the main production work shall proceed at the crack spacing determined from the main trial, or from any relevant subsequent production cracking re-assessment trial. The main production work shall be assessed in accordance with sub-Clause 24 of Clause 716 with reference to sub-Clause 21 of this Clause.
 19 (02/16) FWD measurements shall be made along the centre line of every bay of jointed concrete pavement after cracking and seating at the bay location determined by the Overseeing Organisation from the results of the main trial. For HBM bases, the FWD measurements shall be made every 5 m along the centre line of each traffic lane, and shifting by 0.5 m where necessary to avoid the location of pre-existing transverse cracks.
 20 (02/16) If the crack characteristics or patterns vary from those to which consent was given in the main trial, or from any relevant subsequent production cracking re-assessment trial and are not restored within 4 bays in jointed concrete pavements or within 20 m in HBM bases, production cracking shall cease in accordance with sub-Clause 7 of Clause 716. A production cracking re-assessment trial shall then be carried out in accordance with sub-Clause 28 of Clause 716 before any further production cracking and seating work is executed.
 21 (02/16) After completion of the FWD measurements on the Main Production Work, the deflection data and layer thickness details derived from cores taken in accordance with Clause 716, and supplemented by Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) measurements when required by contract specific Appendix 7/16, shall be used by the Contractor to calculate effective stiffness moduli of the pavement layers in accordance with Clause 719. The moduli values shall be supplied to the Overseeing Organisation within 24 hours of the cracking operations.
 (02/16) Acceptance of the Main Production Work Testing
 22 (02/16) The effective stiffness moduli of the cracked and seated concrete calculated in accordance with Clause 719 from the FWD measurements collected in accordance with this Clause shall be assessed by the Overseeing Organisation in conjunction with the other criteria specified in sub-Clause 24 of Clause 716. The Overseeing Organisation shall instruct or otherwise on any remedial actions that may be required. The road shall be neither overlaid nor re-opened to highway traffic without the Overseeing Organisation's written confirmation that he has completed his interpretation of the FWD measurements and that all required remedial actions have been completed.
 (02/16) Production Cracking Re-assessment Trial
 23 (02/16) Should a production cracking re-assessment trial be required for the reasons specified in sub-Clause 7 of Clause 716, then FWD measurements will be required for assessment of the trial. These measurements shall be made by the Contractor in accordance with sub-Clauses 12 to 17 of this Clause both before and after cracking and seating.
 (02/16) Assessment of Production Cracking Re-assessment Trial
 24 (02/16) After completion of the FWD measurements on the re-assessment trial, the deflection data and layer thickness details derived from cores taken in accordance with Clause 716 shall be used by the Contractor to calculate effective stiffness moduli of the pavement layers in accordance with Clause 719. The Overseeing Organisation will use these moduli values, in conjunction with the other criteria specified in sub-Clause 18 of Clause 716, to determine the transverse crack spacing to be used in the main production work. For jointed

 unreinforced concrete pavements, the analysis will also provide the location on individual bays where FWD measurements will be made following cracking and seating in the main works.
 (02/16) Consent to the Method and Acceptance of the Production Cracking Re-assessment Trial
 25 (02/16) The Contractor shall not resume the main crack and seat works until the Overseeing Organisation has given his consent that the plant, equipment and methods used in the production cracking re-assessment trial comply with the requirements given in Table 7/4 of Clause 716 and sub-Clauses 23 and 24 of this Clause.
 
 718 (02/16) Monitoring of Saw-cut, Cracked and Seated Jointed Reinforced Concrete Pavements Using the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD)
 (02/16) General
 1 (02/16) This Clause specifies the procedures to be followed when the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) is to be used to acquire the measurements used to determine the load-spreading properties of saw-cut, cracked and seated reinforced concrete as required by Clause 715. Specifically, the FWD shall be used to validate whether the effective stiffness modulus of the saw-cut, cracked and seated hydraulically bound layer or layers exceeds the threshold value determined from the structural design calculations. The type of equipment is specified together with the procedures for its use on site and the parameters required to acquire the deflection data. The effective stiffness moduli of the saw-cut, cracked and seated hydraulically bound layer or layers and of the underlying foundation shall be calculated by the Contractor using back-analysis of the FWD measurements obtained by the Contractor in accordance with Clause 719.
 2 (02/16) FWD measurements shall be made on the surface of the concrete after the removal of any existing asphalt overlay or surfacing from the area to be tested. Removal of overlay shall be completed ahead of the FWD testing at a distance of not less than 100 m from the FWD equipment. The cracking and seating operation shall also be completed ahead of the FWD testing at a distance of not less than 100 m from the FWD equipment in order to minimise the effect of pavement vibration. FWD measurements shall follow the seating operation. The Contractor shall ensure that a sufficient frequency of clearly-marked locational reference markers have been put in place to the satisfaction of the Overseeing Organisation for the purpose of accurately recording the locations of the FWD measurements and therefore correlating the results with the settings used by the cracking plant.
 3 (02/16) The Overseeing Organisation will use the effective stiffness moduli obtained from the main trial in accordance with Clause 719 in conjunction with the other criteria specified in sub-Clause 21 of Clause 715 to determine the required transverse crack spacing to be used in the main production work.
 4 (02/16) The Overseeing Organisation may instruct any variation required in the method and pattern of sawcutting and/or cracking or subsequently confirm or otherwise the suitability of the proposed thickness of overlay required, as a result of the effective stiffness modulus of the saw-cut, cracked and seated hydraulically bound layer or layers determined from FWD measurements.

 8 (02/16) For the monitoring of the saw-cut, crack and seat operation, the load level shall be set at 50kN  10%. The load pulse shall be applied through a 300 mm diameter plate and have a rise time from start of pulse to peak of between 5 and 15 milliseconds. Most FWDs have a 60 Hz smoothing filter option which has been shown to improve the agreement between machines. Where available the smoothing filter shall be activated. Deflections shall be measured to a resolution of at least 1 micron over the range 0-2 mm by a minimum of 7 sensors situated at radii up to a distance of 2.25m from the centre of the loading plate at positions shown in Table 7/6. While more than 7 geophones can be fitted to an FWD, Clause 719 requires that the data input to the approved back-analysis software program shall contain measurements only from the geophones located at the positions shown in Table 7/6.

 (02/16) Operation on site
 9 (02/16) FWD testing shall not be performed while standing water is present on the surface to be tested.
 10 (02/16) The Contractor shall ensure that there is no detritus on the road surface prior to the FWD testing. Care shall be taken to ensure that the whole area of the FWD loading plate is in contact with the pavement surface. A minimum of 3 drops, plus a small initial drop for settling the load plate, should be made at each test point. The Contractor shall make checks for machine consistency during the survey and before analysis.
 11 (02/16) During FWD testing, it is essential for subsequent analysis that the deflection values for d1 to d7 reduce as the distance from the applied load increases. Should the deflection measured by a geophone of a higher number (see Table 7/6) be greater than the deflection measured by a geophone of a lower number, then the FWD shall be moved forwards or backwards by a small distance and the measurement cycle repeated. If it is not possible to obtain a decreasing deflection bowl after two shifts of position, then the measurement should be discarded and the location of the test position noted for further investigation by the Overseeing Organisation.
 (02/16) Main Trial Area Testing
 12 (02/16) In Stage 2 and subsequent Stages of the Main Trial, the Contractor shall make FWD measurements both before saw-cutting and then after cracking and seating, in order to determine the reduction in the effective stiffness modulus of the concrete produced by the saw-cut, cracking and seating operation. Stage 2 and subsequent Stages, shall consist of an area as described in sub-clause 21 of Clause 715. The area of concrete to be tested shall be adequately marked to enable FWD testing to be performed on the same locations both before saw-cutting and after cracking.
 13 (02/16) FWD measurements shall be made along the centre line of the reinforced slabs. For each saw-cut spacing, the location of the centre of the loading plate for the first measurement shall be at the midpoint between the first two saw-cuts. Subsequent measurements shall be made directly on the saw-cuts and at the midpoint between adjacent saw-cuts. Test positions coincident with transverse cracks should be omitted and the location of the crack recorded by the Contractor. The location of the FWD loading plate shall be adequately recorded so that the location of each measurement can be clearly identified.
 14 (02/16) After completion of the FWD measurements on the main trial, the deflection data and layer thickness details derived from cores taken in accordance with Clause 715, and supplemented by Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) measurements when required by contract specific Appendix 7/15, shall be used by the Contractor to calculate effective stiffness moduli of the pavement layers in accordance with Clause 719. The moduli values shall be supplied to the Overseeing Organisation who will determine the required transverse saw-cut spacing to be used in the main production work with reference to the other criteria specified in sub-Clause 21 of Clause 715.

 (02/16) Consent to the Results of the FWD Measurements on the Main Trial
 15 (02/16) The Contractor shall not proceed with the main saw-cut, crack and seat works until the Overseeing Organisation has specified the transverse saw-cut spacing and given its consent that the effective stiffness modulus of the cracked and seated concrete exceeds the threshold value required by the structural design.
 16 (02/16) Consent to the plant, equipment and methods will be given by the Overseeing Organisation following a successful demonstration in the main trial that the saw-cut, cracking and seating complies with the requirements of Clause 715 and this Clause. When consent by the Overseeing Organisation to the method has been given, the plant, equipment and methods shall not be changed thereafter without the prior consent of the Overseeing Organisation except for normal adjustment and maintenance of plant. Should it be necessary for the Contractor to otherwise change any plant, equipment and/or method the Contractor shall carry out a further main trial Stage.
 (02/16) Main Production Work Testing
 17 (02/16) The cracking operation for the main production work shall proceed using the saw-cut spacing determined from the main trial, or from any relevant subsequent production cracking re-assessment trial. The main production work shall be assessed in accordance with sub-Clause 29 of Clause 715 with reference to sub-Clause 23 of this Clause.
 18 (02/16) FWD measurements shall be made every 5 m along the centre line of the slabs in each traffic lane, and shifting by 0.5 m where necessary to avoid the location of pre-existing transverse cracks.
 19 (02/16) If the crack characteristics or patterns vary from those to which consent was given in the main trial, or from any relevant subsequent production cracking re-assessment trial and are not restored within 20 m, production cracking shall cease in accordance with sub-Clause 6 of Clause 715. A production cracking re-assessment trial shall then be carried out in accordance with sub-Clause 33 of Clause 715 before any further production saw-cut and cracking and seating work is executed.
 20 (02/16) After completion of the FWD measurements on the Main Production Work, the deflection data and layer thickness details derived from cores taken in accordance with Clause 715, and supplemented by Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) measurements when required by contract specific Appendix 7/15, shall be used by the Contractor to calculate effective stiffness moduli of the pavement layers in accordance with Clause 719. The moduli values shall be supplied to the Overseeing Organisation within 24 hours of the cracking operations.
 (02/16) Assessment of the Main Production Work Testing
 21 (02/16) The effective stiffness moduli of the cracked and seated concrete calculated by the Contractor in accordance with Clause 719 from the FWD measurements collected in accordance with this Clause shall be assessed by the Overseeing Organisation in conjunction with the other criteria specified in sub-Clause 29 of Clause 715. The Overseeing Organisation shall instruct or otherwise on any remedial actions that may be required. The road shall be neither overlaid nor re-opened to highway traffic without the Overseeing Organisation's written confirmation that he has completed his interpretation of the FWD measurements and that all required remedial actions have been completed.
 (02/16) Production Cracking Re-assessment Trial
 22 (02/16) Should a production cracking re-assessment trial be required as specified in sub-Clause 33 of Clause 715, then FWD measurements will be required for assessment of the trial. These measurements shall be made by the Contractor in accordance with sub-Clauses 12 to 16 of this Clause both before saw-cutting and after cracking and seating.
 (02/16) Assessment of Production Cracking Re-assessment Trial
 23 (02/16) After completion of the FWD measurements on the re-assessment trial, the deflection data and layer thickness details derived from cores taken in accordance with Clause 715 shall be used by the Contractor to calculate effective stiffness moduli of the pavement layers in accordance with Clause 719. The Overseeing Organisation will use these moduli values, in conjunction with the other criteria specified in sub-Clause 21 of Clause 715, to determine the transverse crack spacing to be used in the main production work.

 719 (02/16) Back-analysis of Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) Measurements Made on Concrete Pavements Treated by Fractured Slab Techniques
 (02/16) General
 1 (02/16) For the purposes of this Clause, `Fractured Slab' techniques shall comprise the following:
 (i) Crack and seat of jointed unreinforced concrete pavements and HBM bases in accordance with Clause 716.
 (ii) Saw-cut and crack and seat of jointed reinforced concrete pavements in accordance with Clause 715.
 2 (02/16) The Contractor shall produce the FWD deflection measurements to be used in this Clause in accordance with Clause 717 for crack and seat or Clause 718 for saw-cut, crack and seat.
 3 (02/16) The effective stiffness modulus of the fractured concrete, together with that of the foundation, shall be derived from the back-analysis of FWD deflection bowl measurements by means of a recognised analysis package. Highways England recognises the MODULUS-HA computer program, any alternative package proposed must be proven to provide the same output values as MODULUS-HA. MODULUS-HA or an approved equivalent shall be used for all back-analysis of FWD measurements performed in accordance with Clause 717 for crack and seat or Clause 718 for saw-cut, crack and seat. Detailed instructions for the use of this program are contained in its accompanying MODULUS-HA User Guide.
 4 (02/16) The back-analysis procedure to be used utilises a two-layer model and, therefore, only the thickness of the bound layers is required. The unbound layers are modelled as a single layer of infinite depth. Thickness information for the bound layers is obtained from core samples obtained from the assessment of the cracking operations in accordance with Clause 715 or Clause 716, and may be supplemented by Ground Penetrating Radar measurements when required by contract specific Appendix 7/16 for crack and seat or contract specific Appendix 7/15 for saw-cut, crack and seat.
 5 (02/16) The pavement deflection data to be back-analysed shall be divided into uniform sections with similar total thicknesses of hydraulically bound material for the purposes of back-analysis. The mean total thickness of hydraulically bound material present shall be calculated for each section. The measured bound-layer thicknesses within a uniform section should lie within 5 per cent of the bound-layer thickness used for that section.
 6 (02/16) The Overseeing Organisation may instruct any variation required in the method and pattern of cracking or subsequently confirm or otherwise the suitability of the proposed thickness of overlay required as a result of the effective stiffness modulus of the fractured hydraulically bound layer or layers determined from FWD measurements.
 7 (02/16) Following submission of the electronic tables and graphs produced in accordance with sub-Clauses 11 and 12 of this Clause, the Contractor shall allow the period of time set out in contract specific Appendix 7/19 for the Overseeing Organisation to carry out his assessment and interpretation of the results.
 8 (02/16) The pavement shall be neither overlaid nor re-opened to highway traffic without the Overseeing Organisation's written confirmation that he has completed his assessment of the FWD measurements and that any required remedial action has been completed.

 9 (02/16) The Contractor shall use MODULUS-HA or an approved equivalent to create .OUT files with the required format from standard .F20 or .FWD output files in accordance with Chapter 3 of the MODULUS-HA User's Guide. Deflection measurements from a maximum of seven geophones shall be used. The additional parameters required by MODULUS-HA or an approved equivalent shall be as specified in contract specific Appendix 7/19. If the FWD deflection measurement data is not output in .F20 or .FWD file formats then the Contractor shall produce suitable .OUT files containing the measured FWD data with the required structure by an alternative method of his own devising.
 10 (02/16) Following production of a suitable .OUT file, the Contractor shall back-analyse the FWD deflection data obtained from a length of pavement defined in accordance with sub-Clause 5 of this Clause. The back-analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedure set out in Chapter 4 of the MODULUS-HA Users Guide. The additional parameters required by MODULUS-HA or an approved equivalent shall be as specified in contract specific Appendix 7/19.
 11 (02/16) The Contractor shall save the back-analysed data as an ASCII data file in accordance with the procedure set out in Chapter 5 of the MODULUS-HA Users Guide. The structure of the data contained within the output data files shall be as specified in Appendix F of the MODULUS-HA Users Guide.
 12 (02/16) The Contractor shall compile and present the back-analysed data created by MODULUS-HA or an approved equivalent to the Overseeing Organisation in tabulated form in accordance with the electronic spreadsheet format specified in contract specific Appendix 7/19. For each FWD test point, the presented data shall include, as a minimum, the:
 (i) Station identification; eg carriageway, lane and chainage.
 (ii) Magnitude of the applied load (in kN).
 (iii) Absolute measured deflections at each geophone position (in microns).
 (iv) Back-analysed effective stiffness modulus of the hydraulically bound layer (in MPa).

 3 (02/16) Notwithstanding the tolerances permitted in surface levels of pavement courses, the cumulative tolerance shall not result in a reduction in thickness of the pavement, excluding the subbase and filter layer, by more than 15 mm from the specified thickness nor a reduction in the thickness of the bituminous surface course by more than 5 mm from that specified.
 
 4 (02/16) For checking compliance with sub-Clause 2 of this Clause, measurements of the surface levels of all courses will be taken on a grid of points located as described in contract specific Appendix 7/1. In any length of pavement, compliance shall be deemed to be met for all surfaces, other than the final road surface, when not more than one of ten consecutive measurements taken longitudinally or one in any transverse line, exceeds the tolerances permitted in Table 7/1NI, provided that this one measurement shall not exceed by more than 5 mm the tolerance for the course concerned. For the final road surface the tolerance given in Table 7/1NI shall apply to any point on that surface.

 An irregularity is a variation of not less than 4 mm or not less 7 mm of the profile of the road surface as measured by the rolling straight-edge set at 4 mm or 7 mm as appropriate, or equivalent apparatus capable of measuring irregularities within the same magnitudes over a 3 m length. No irregularity exceeding 10 mm shall be permitted.
 
 6 (02/16) Prior to checking any final road surface, binder course or top surface of base in pavements without binder course for level, regularity or macrotexture depth, it shall be cleaned of loose or extraneous materials. These operations shall be carried out without damaging the surface of the pavement, as soon as possible and within 3 days of construction of the pavement.
 
 7 (02/16) Compliance with Table 7/2NI shall be checked by the rolling straight-edge along any line or lines parallel to the edge of pavement on sections of 300 m at regular intervals as stated in contract specific Appendix 7/1, whether or not it is constructed in shorter lengths. Sections shorter than 300 m forming part of a longer pavement shall be assessed using the number of irregularities for a 300 m length pro-rata to the nearest whole number.
 
 Where the total length of pavement is less than 300 m, the measurements shall be taken on 75 m lengths.
 
 8 (02/16) Pavements shall be measured transversely for irregularities at regular intervals as stated in contract specific Appendix 7/1, by a 3 m long straight-edge to BS 8420 placed at right angles to the centre line of the road. The maximum allowable difference between the pavement surface and the straight-edge shall be 3 mm.
 
 9 (02/16) A straight-edge 3 metres long, shall be used to check longitudinal surface regularity in the following cases:
 
 (i) for lengths of less than 75 m of surface course, binder course and concrete slabs;
 
 (ii) where use of the rolling straight-edge or equivalent apparatus is impracticable;
 
 (iii) for all lengths of subbase under concrete pavement slabs laid full thickness in one operation by machine with surface compaction.

 Volume 1 Specification for Highway Works
 
 Series 700 Road Pavements  General
 
 (i) Unbound and Hydraulically bound materials
 The top 75 mm shall be scarified, reshaped with material added or removed as necessary, and recompacted. The area treated shall be not less than 30 m long and 2 m wide or such area as necessary to obtain compliance with the specification.
 (ii) Cement bound subbases and bases
 The method of correction will depend on the period which has elapsed between detection of the error and the time of mixing of the material. If this is less than 4 hours, the surface shall be scarified to a depth of not less than 50 mm, surplus material removed or freshly mixed material added as necessary, and re-compacted in accordance with the specification. If the period is 4 hours or more the full depth of the layer shall be removed from the pavement and replaced with material in accordance with the specification. In either case the area treated shall be at least 5 m long and the full width of the paving laid in one operation. If the Contractor proposes rectification within 7 days of laying he shall comply with Clause 1048. Alternatively, for subbases under concrete pavements the Contractor may make up low areas to a level within the tolerances of this Clause with a 1:4 cement and sand mortar or with an AC4 fine surface course complying with Clause 914.
 (iii) Bituminous bases
 With coated macadam or asphalt bases, the full depth of the top layer as laid shall be removed and be replaced with fresh material laid and compacted in accordance with the specification. Any area so treated shall be at least 5 m long and the full width of the paving laid in one operation. Alternatively for low areas in bituminous bases, the Contractor may make up the level with additional binder course material.
 (iv) Surface courses, binder courses
 These shall have the full depth of the course removed and replaced with fresh material laid and compacted in accordance with the specification.
 The area rectified shall be the full width of the paving laid in one operation, and at least 5 m long if binder course or base on pavements without binder course, or 15 m if surface course.
 Where the number of surface irregularities exceeds the limits in Table 7/2NI, the area to be rectified shall be 300 m or 75 m long as appropriate and the full width of the lanes affected, or such lesser area as necessary to make the number of surface irregularities conform with the limits.
 Checking of the surface course for compliance with this Clause shall be carried out as soon as possible after completion of the surfacing and remedial works completed before the road is opened to traffic.
 Where the macrotexture depth requirement is not met for:
 (a) a section 1000 m in lane length; or
 (b) the full lane length of a section less than 1000 m long as the balance of a complete scheme; or
 (c) the full lane length of a scheme less than 1000 m long;
 then sufficient 50 m lengths shall be replaced, starting with that length having the least macrotexture depth, until the average requirement for the section length is complied with.
 A minimum length of 50 m and the full lane width shall be removed and replaced either:
 (a) to the full depth of the surface course; or
 (b) to a depth of 20 mm when replaced by the repave method process in compliance with Clause 926.
 Areas to be removed shall be delineated both longitudinally and transversely by saw cutting prior to the material being removed. Joints shall be formed either by coating the exposed sawn face with hot bitumen or heating by suitable heater. The heater shall raise the temperature of the full depth of the course immediately before laying the new material to a figure within the range of minimum rolling temperature and maximum temperature at any stage specified for the material and for a width of not less than 75 mm.

 (v) Concrete slabs
 Concrete slabs shall be rectified by planing, grinding or bump cutting. Large depressions, which cannot be dealt with in this way, shall be rectified by cutting out the surface and replacing by a thin bonded surface repair complying with Clause 1032.
 Retexturing of hardened concrete shall be carried out by sawing grooves in accordance with the specification. Texturing of replaced surfaces shall be by brushing in accordance with the specification. Where the slab cannot be rectified as above, the full depth of slab shall be removed and replaced with a slab constructed in compliance with Clause 1033 to the extent required to obtain compliance with the specification. Remedial works involving the placing of fresh concrete shall be completed in sufficient time for the concrete strength to have developed as required in Clause 1048, before that section of pavement is opened to traffic.

 1 (02/16) The Contractor shall not excavate pits, trenches or other openings in paved areas which have been constructed as part of the permanent works in order to construct other parts of the works, including Statutory Undertakers and other service works except with the prior approval of the Overseeing Organisation.
 2 (02/16) Where excavation and trimming of existing paved areas and highways not constructed as part of the permanent works are required in contract specific Appendix 7/2, they shall be carried out and reinstated in compliance with this Clause and with any additional requirements described in contract specific Appendix 7/2. Excavations shall be carried out to the dimensions described in contract specific Appendix 7/2, or, if not so described, to the minimum dimensions, subject to sub-Clause 3 of this Clause, necessary to carry out the work.
 (02/16) Excavations
 3 (02/16) Excavations in existing pavements and other paved areas, except those described in sub-Clause 4 of this Clause, including surfacing, base and subbase, shall be cut to neat lines to dimensions at least 75 mm greater on each side than the dimensions of any further excavation below formation level. Excavations in capping shall be taken at least 75 mm outside the dimensions of any excavation below. Road surfacing of bituminous material shall be cut back by sawing or planing to a further 75 mm on each side. Planing shall be carried out in accordance with Clause 709. Concrete surfacing and concrete roadbases, except CBM, shall be cut back by sawing by at least 300 mm on each side to the level of any reinforcement in reinforced slabs and to the full depth of the slab in unreinforced slabs.
 If excavations are required to inspect the condition of lower layers, each layer shall be excavated separately and cleaned of debris to permit inspection.
 4 (02/16) Concrete blocks, clay pavers and precast concrete flags, kerbs and channels shall be lifted without cutting, to the nearest joint satisfying sub-Clause 3 of this Clause and carefully stored for re-use or dealt with as described in contract specific Appendix 2/3. In situ kerbs and channels shall be broken out to at least 150 mm beyond the excavation.
 5 (02/16) All excavations shall be carried out in compliance with the specification and adequately supported at all times. Support shall be withdrawn as backfilling proceeds.

 7 (02/16) The layers of capping and pavement and other paved area materials shall be reinstated consecutively, as soon as possible, in compliance with the appropriate Clauses in the 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000 and 1100 Series, to match the thicknesses and constituents of the existing material or as otherwise described in contract specific Appendix 7/2. They shall be laid and compacted in compliance with the appropriate Clauses in the above Series within the tolerances given in Table 7/1.
 To allow for settlement in backfill under concrete pavements, temporary repairs to the pavement shall be carried out using bituminous materials. Alternatively, foamed concrete shall be used up to the base of the slab and the slab reinstated as soon as possible. The reinstatement of the concrete slab shall be carried out as described in contract specific Appendix 7/2.
 8 (02/16) Block and flag paving and precast and in situ kerbs and channels shall be reinstated in compliance with Series 1100 to match the existing construction.
 9 (02/16) Where settlement of the reinstatement occurs, the surface level shall be brought to correct levels and surface regularity. Where an existing pavement has been trimmed for a new pavement to abut it, regulating layers for changes in crossfall or level shall comply with the requirements for the appropriate subbase, base or surface layer.
 10 (02/16) Immediately before bituminous layers are reinstated, the edges of the existing material shall be cleaned of all loose material and be coated with an appropriate hot bituminous binder or equivalent treatment. Where joints in concrete slabs are affected by the excavation they shall be reinstated by cutting back to at least 0.5 m on each side of a transverse joint and forming an expansion joint on one side of the excavation and a contraction joint on the other and provide longitudinal joints where necessary in the same line before reinstatement in compliance with Series 1000 to match the existing construction.
 (02/16) Reinstatement of Unpaved Areas and Other Surfaced Highways
 11 (02/16) Where the excavation affects verges, grassed areas, footpaths and bridleways they shall be reinstated to match the existing surface, after backfilling in compliance with sub-Clause 6 of this Clause to a depth of 150 mm below the existing surface. The reinstatement shall be completed by topsoil and seeding or turfing in compliance with the specification, in both cases re-using any topsoil or turves cut and stored for re-use, or, when surfaced, with material matching the existing foundation and surface.
 12 (02/16) Levels between existing and newly constructed footpaths, footways, verges and bridleways shall be matched by removing the minimum area of existing material necessary, to enable the total thickness of surfacing material to be laid abutting the existing surface. Where settlement of the reinstatement occurs the levels shall be brought up to existing levels.
 Surfaces may be left proud of the adjacent existing surfaces by an amount not exceeding 50 mm, adequately ramped to avoid sharp changes in level, to cater for subsequent settlement.
 (02/16) Junctions Between New Pavement Construction and Existing Pavement or Other Paved Areas
 13 (02/16) Where new pavement construction abuts an existing bituminous pavement which has to be reduced in level or overlaid to match alignment and levels, the existing surface shall be trimmed by the minimum amount of cold-milling (planing) to a depth which will allow the specified thickness of new construction to be laid, the edge being trimmed and treated in compliance with this Clause. Where the difference in level makes it necessary, a regulating course as described in contract specific Appendix 7/1 and specified in Clause 907 shall be provided. The locations to be trimmed are given in contract specific Appendix 7/2.
 14 (02/16) Junctions between concrete pavements and between concrete and bituminous pavements shall be constructed as described in contract specific Appendix 7/2. Junctions in porous asphalt shall comply also with Clause 938. Junctions between porous asphalt surfacing and other pavement surfaces shall be constructed as described in contract specific Appendix 7/2.

 7 (02/16) Subject to the tolerances given in Table 7/1 and unless otherwise stated in contract specific Appendix 7/1, material shall not be frost susceptible if it is used within 450 mm of the designed final surface of a road or paved central reserve, or 350 mm if the Mean Annual Frost Index (MAFI) of the site is less than 50.
 8 (02/16) Material shall be classified as non-frost-susceptible if the mean heave is 15 mm or less, when tested in accordance with BS 812-124. Comparator specimens in accordance with Annex B of BS 812-124 shall be used.
 
 802 (02/16) Transport, Laying, Compaction and Trafficking of Unbound Mixtures
 (02/16) Transporting
 1 (02/16) Unbound mixtures shall be protected from drying out and segregation both during transit to the point where it is to be laid and whilst awaiting tipping.
 (02/16) Laying
 2 (02/16) Unbound mixtures in a frozen condition shall not be incorporated in the works but may be used, if acceptable, when thawed. Unbound mixtures shall not be laid on any surface which is frozen or covered with ice.
 3 (02/16) All unbound mixtures shall be placed and spread evenly. Spreading shall be undertaken either concurrently with placing or without delay. Unbound mixtures shall be spread using a paving machine or a suitable spreader box and operated with a mechanism which levels off the material to an even depth.
 4 (02/16) Except where otherwise stated in contract specific Appendix 7/1, material up to 225 mm compacted thickness shall be spread in one layer so that after compaction the total thickness is as specified. Material of compacted thickness greater than 225 mm shall be laid in two or more layers and the minimum compacted thickness of any such layer shall be 110 mm. Where the layers of unbound mixtures are of unequal thickness, the lowest layer shall be the thickest layer.
 (02/16) Compaction
 5 (02/16) Compaction shall be completed as soon as possible after the mixture has been spread and in accordance with the requirements for the individual mixtures.

 6 (02/16) Full compaction shall be obtained over the full area including in the vicinity of both longitudinal and transverse joints.
 7 (02/16) Compaction of unbound mixtures shall be carried out by a method specified in Table 8/4, unless the Contractor demonstrates at site trials that a state of compaction achieved by an alternative method is equivalent to or better than that using the specified method.
 8 (02/16) The surface of any layer of material shall on completion of compaction and immediately before overlaying, be well closed, free from movement under construction plant and from ridges, cracks, loose material, pot holes, ruts or other defects. All loose, segregated or otherwise defective areas shall be removed to the full thickness of the layer, and new material laid and compacted.
 9 (02/16) For the purposes of Table 8/4 the following shall apply:
 (i) The number of passes is the number of times that each point on the surface of the layer being compacted shall be traversed by the item of compaction plant in its operating mode (or struck, in the case of power rammers).
 (ii) The compaction plant in Table 8/4 is categorised in terms of static mass. The mass per metre width of roll is the total mass on the roll divided by the total roll width. Where a smooth-wheeled roller has more than one axle, the category of the machine shall be determined on the basis of the axle giving the highest value of mass per metre width.
 (iii) For pneumatic-tyred rollers the mass per wheel is the total mass of the roller divided by the number of wheels. In assessing the number of passes of pneumatic-tyred rollers the effective width shall be the sum of the widths of the individual wheel tracks together with the sum of the spacings between the wheel tracks provided that each spacing does not exceed 230 mm. Where the spacings exceed 230 mm the effective width shall be the sum of the widths of the individual wheel tracks only.
 (iv) Vibratory rollers are self-propelled or towed smooth-wheeled rollers having means of applying mechanical vibration to one or more rolls:
 (a)The requirements for vibratory rollers are based on the use of the lowest gear on a selfpropelled machine with mechanical transmission and a speed of 1.5-2.5 km/h for a towed machine or a self-propelled machine with hydrostatic transmission. If higher gears or speeds are used an increased number of passes shall be provided in proportion to the increase in speed of travel.
 (b)Where the mechanical vibration is applied to two rolls in tandem, the minimum number of passes shall be half the number given in Table 8/4 for the appropriate mass per metre width of one vibrating roll but if one roll differs in mass per metre width from the other, the number of passes shall be calculated as for the roll with the smaller value. Alternatively the minimum number of passes may be determined by treating the machine as having a single vibrating roll with a mass per metre width equal to that of the roll with the higher value.
 (c) Vibratory rollers operating without vibration shall be classified as smooth-wheeled rollers.
 (d)Vibratory rollers shall be operated with their vibratory mechanism operating at the frequency of vibration recommended by the manufacturer. All such rollers shall be equipped, or provided with devices indicating the frequency at which the mechanism is operating and the speed of travel. Both devices shall be capable of being safely read by an inspector alongside the machine.
 (v) Vibrating-plate compactors are machines having a base-plate to which is attached a source of vibration consisting of one or two eccentrically-weighted shafts:
 (a)The mass per square metre of base-plate of a vibrating-plate compactor is calculated by dividing the total mass of the machine in its working condition by its area in contact with compacted material.

 (b)Vibrating-plate compactors shall be operated at the frequency of vibration recommended by the manufacturer. They shall normally be operated at travelling speeds of less than 1 km/h but if higher speeds are necessary, the number of passes shall be increased in proportion to the increase in speed of travel.
 (vi) Vibro-tampers are machines in which an engine driven reciprocating mechanism acts on a spring system, through which oscillations are set up in a base-plate.
 (vii) Power rammers are machines which are actuated by explosions in an internal combustion cylinder; each explosion being controlled manually by the operator. One pass of a power rammer shall be considered to have been made when the compacting shoe has made one strike on the area in question.
 (viii) Combinations of different types of plant or different categories of the same plant will be permitted; in which case the number of passes for each shall be such proportion of the appropriate number in Table 8/4 as will together produce the same total compactive effort as any one operated singly, in accordance with Table 8/4.

 11 (02/16) Where the Contractor proposes to use the unbound mixture layers for construction plant he shall improve these layers where necessary, to accommodate the method of construction and the type of plant and vehicles which he proposes to use, in order to avoid damage to the laid layer(s), any capping and the subgrade. Any permanent thickening shall be across the whole width of the pavement. Temporary thickening shall not impede drainage of any layer or the subgrade.
 (02/16) Trafficking Trial
 12 (02/16) When required by contract specific Appendix 7/1, the Contractor shall undertake a Trafficking Trial incorporating the unbound mixture proposed for use in the permanent works. A trial area shall be constructed, trafficked and assessed in accordance with the procedure described in sub-Clauses 13 to 18 of this Clause. The mean vertical deformation after 1000 equivalent standard axles shall be less than 30 mm when measured in accordance with the procedure stated in sub-Clause 17 of this Clause.
 Proposals for trafficking trials shall be submitted to the Overseeing Organisation for review and acceptance five days in advance of construction.

 13 (02/16) The trial area shall be located on a formation prepared in accordance with the specification. The trial area may be located so that it can be incorporated within the permanent works if the resistance to wheel track rutting is demonstrated to comply with sub-Clause 12 of this Clause.
 14 (02/16) The trial area shall be at least 60 m long, and of sufficient width that when trafficked, the wheel paths of the test vehicle shall be at least 1 m from either edge of the top of the unbound mixture layer. The unbound mixture layer shall be compacted to the thickness specified in contract specific Appendix 7/1. The formation shall extend for a further 1 m either side of the unbound mixture layer.
 15 (02/16) A sufficient run off/run on area shall be constructed at each end of the trial area of the same width, and compacted to the same level, as the trial area, to ensure correct tracking by the test vehicle and minimise dynamic effects of the vehicle bouncing on its springs. Suitable guidance shall be given to assist the driver in maintaining the same track in each pass and to achieve channelled trafficking. Examples of suitable guides would be a string or painted line.
 (02/16) Mixtures
 16 (02/16) The unbound mixture used in the trial shall be transported, laid and compacted using the equipment proposed for use in the works.
 17 (02/16) Maximum vertical deformation shall be measured in both wheel tracks using optical or laser levels at pre-determined monitoring points on five transverse lines spaced equally along the length of the trial bay. The transverse lines at the ends of the trial area shall be at least 5 m from the run off/run on areas. The average deformation of the two wheel tracks after 1000 standard axles shall be recorded.
 (02/16) Reporting and Acceptance of Trafficking Trial Area
 18 (02/16) The Contractor shall provide the Overseeing Organisation, for acceptance, with a report on the Trafficking Trial, stating how the use of the unbound mixture was validated. The main construction of the permanent works shall not start until the Trafficking Trial area has been accepted by the Overseeing Organisation within two working days of receiving the Trafficking Trial area report.
 803 (02/16) Type 1 Unbound Mixtures
 1 (02/16) Type 1 unbound mixture shall be made from crushed rock, crushed slag, crushed concrete, recycled aggregates or well burnt non-plastic shale and may contain up to 10% by mass of natural sand that passes the 4 mm test sieve. Where permitted by contract specific Appendix 7/1, crushed gravel complying with sub-Clause 803.7 may be used.

 (ii) As a temporary expedient, when adjustments have to be made to the spreader distribution mechanism.
 (iii) When hand laying of the surface course is permitted.
 (iv) To correct uneven distribution of chippings.
 20 (05/18) Chippings shall be applied uniformly and rolled into the surface so they are effectively held and provide the initial macrotexture depth specified in Clause 921.
 (05/18) Joints
 21 (05/18) For new pavement construction, all longitudinal joints in all layers shall be situated outside wheeltrack zones. Where an existing road pavement is resurfaced, joints in the surface course shall coincide with either the lane edge, the lane marking, or the middle of a traffic lane, whichever is appropriate. Joints shall not coincide with the wheel path. For the purposes of this Clause, the wheel-track zones shall be taken to be between 0.5 m and 1.1 m and between 2.55 m and 3.15 m from the centre of the nearside lane markings for each traffic lane (or, in the absence of lane markings, lane edges). All joints shall be offset at least 300 mm from parallel joints in the layer beneath.

 (05/18) Scope
 1 (05/18) In situ cold recycled bitumen bound material shall be designed and produced to form the foundation or main structural layer of the road pavement. The primary aggregate source shall be obtained by cold pulverisation of all, or part, of the existing road structure. The primary binder (stabilising agent) shall be a foamed bitumen, with cement or lime as an adhesion agent. The aggregate grading may be adjusted by the addition of a filler. Lime may also be used to modify any cohesive sub-grade soil incorporated in the pulverised layer.
 2 (05/18) Prior to commencing the pulverisation and stabilisation works, the Contractor shall demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Overseeing Organisation, using the results of mix design procedures described in sub-Clauses 58 to 65 of this Clause, that the existing pavement materials in the sections of the works defined in contract specific Appendix 7/18 are capable of being recycled by pulverisation to form the primary aggregate component of an in situ cold recycled bitumen bound material which can meet the specified end-product performance requirements.
 (05/18) Component Materials
 (05/18) Aggregates and Fillers
 3 (05/18) The pulverised pavement material and any supplementary aggregate and/or filler shall normally be granular material with not less than 5% and not more than 20% passing the 0.063 mm sieve (Zone A graded material). Approval for use of pulverised granular material containing up to 35% passing the 0.063 mm sieve (Zone B graded material) shall require confirmation by the Overseeing Organisation, subject to the results of the mixture design procedures described in sub-Clauses 58 to 65 of this Clause.
 4 (05/18) The pulverised granular material shall contain not more than 2% of organic matter as determined in accordance with BS 1377-3 clause 3.

 6 (05/18) Other than foaming agent(s), bitumen modifiers shall not be used unless approved by the Overseeing Organisation for special purposes or conditions.
 7 (05/18) The binder shall be transported to the site in tankers capable of maintaining the required temperature and a homogeneous binder consistency and transferred to the stabilising plant in a controlled and uniform manner.
 8 (05/18) The foaming of the bitumen shall be carried out within the spraybar system of the recycling machine and immediately mixed with the pulverised aggregate, at which point the foamed bitumen shall have a volume of not less than 10 times the volume of the base penetration grade bitumen.
 (05/18) Cement, Filler Aggregate and Lime
 9 (05/18) The constituents and required quality standards of hydraulic cement, filler aggregate and lime delivered to site shall be certified by the supplier, whose manufacturing and delivery processes shall be implemented using quality management systems in accordance with the BS EN ISO 9001 and certified by an accredited body.

 11 (05/18) PFA, used as a filler aggregate, shall be in accordance with BS EN 450-1.
 12 (05/18) Lime for lime stabilisation (or as a modifier for plastic fines) shall, as required in contract specific Appendix 7/18, be either quicklime or hydrated lime, complying with sub-Clause 615.3.
 (05/18) Water
 13 (05/18) Water for moisture content control of the pulverised granular material, shall normally be obtained from a water company supply and used without testing. Water from an alternative source shall comply with BS EN 1008 and be approved by the Overseeing Organisation.
 (05/18) Pulverisation and Stabilisation
 14 (05/18) The Contractor shall satisfy the Overseeing Organisation that the plant used for pulverisation is capable of uniformly pulverising the existing road structure in a single pass, to the depth stated in contract specific Appendix 7/18. The plant used for stabilisation shall be capable of uniformly mixing controlled amounts of water and binder agent(s) into the full depth of pulverised layer. For either operation, the plant shall be equipped with a means of controlling the depth of processing to 15 mm of the required depth.
 15 (05/18) The plant used for stabilisation shall be equipped with a spraybar system within the mixing chamber capable of producing and uniformly distributing foamed bitumen binder at a monitored and controlled rate. An accessible sampling jet shall also be fitted that produces foamed bitumen having the same characteristics as that produced by the main spraybar. Flow rate meters for measuring the supply rate of hot bitumen and other liquid additives to the mixture shall be capable of recording the correct rate of flow during all states of pipeline flow (i.e. fully or partially charged). Evidence confirming the capabilities of the plant and the calibration of flow meters, shall be submitted to and approved by the Overseeing Organisation prior to the stabilisation works commencing.
 16 (05/18) The material shall be pulverised and stabilised in a single layer if its compacted thickness is 300 mm or less. If the compacted thickness is greater than 300 mm, the material shall be pulverised and stabilised in the minimum number of layers between 100 mm and 300 mm thick. Where more than one layer is required, the Contractor shall satisfy the Overseeing Organisation that the lower layer has achieved adequate stability in accordance with sub-Clause 31 of this Clause before proceeding with the overlying layer.
 (05/18) Pulverisation Process
 17 (05/18) Pulverisation of the existing road structure shall be carried out in a systematic pattern, to the required depth, to ensure that all parts of the existing road designated in contract specific Appendix 7/18 are included in the works. An overlap of at least 150 mm shall be made between adjacent passes of the machine. Any material missed along hard edges or around obstructions shall be excavated and placed in the path of subsequent passes of the machine until a uniform fully pulverised aggregate is obtained. The pulverised material shall not be contaminated by material drawn in from the verges.
 18 (05/18) All longitudinal and transverse joints shall be clean cut and vertical. Where work continues adjacent to previously recycled material, transverse joints shall be reformed a minimum 0.5 m into the previously treated construction. Where a layer of material for stabilisation is placed over a layer previously stabilised, the depth of pulverisation/stabilisation of the upper layer shall be set to cut into the underlying stabilised layer by at least 20 mm.
 19 (05/18) Excess pulverised material shall be removed by the grader and/or excavator for use elsewhere on site or transported to stockpile at locations given in contract specific Appendix 7/18. The surface of the layer shall be graded nominally to the required profile and provisionally compacted.
 20 (05/18) Moisture content of the pulverised aggregate immediately prior to stabilisation shall be measured in accordance with BS EN 1097-5 using the high temperature method. The moisture content shall be uniform throughout the layer within the range 2% of the optimum moisture content for the unstabilised aggregate including any designed proportion of filler, determined in accordance with BS EN 13286-2.
 
 Amendment  May 2018
 
 47
 
 Volume 1 Specification for Highway Works
 
 Series 900 Road Pavements  Bituminous Bound Materials
 
 21 (05/18) If the moisture content of the unstabilised pulverised aggregate fails to meet the specified moisture content range, corrective action shall be taken either by aeration to reduce the moisture content or by controlled addition of water to increase the moisture content.
 22 (05/18) Aeration of the affected area shall be achieved by full depth passes of the recycling machine to disturb and loosen the material and assist the evaporation of excess moisture. The material shall be kept in a loose condition until subsequent moisture content tests show that the treated material has reached the required moisture content range. The layer shall be re-graded nominally to the required profile and provisionally compacted in preparation for stabilisation.
 23 (05/18) An increase in moisture content of the affected area shall be achieved by the addition of water through an adjustable spraybar system in conjunction with full depth passes of the recycling machine to achieve a uniform distribution of the water throughout the layer. Increments of water shall be added and mixed in until subsequent moisture content tests show that the material has reached the required moisture content range. The layer shall be re-graded nominally to the required profile and provisionally compacted in preparation for stabilisation.
 (05/18) Stabilisation Process
 24 (05/18) Stabilisation shall not be carried out during or after periods of rainfall where the duration and intensity are likely to cause the stabilised mixture to exceed the specified moisture content criteria and compromise the stability of the layer under compaction (as defined in sub-Clause 31 of this Clause). Stabilisation of frozen materials shall not be permitted.
 25 (05/18) Prior to stabilisation, pulverised materials within 100 mm of restricted hard edges such as kerbs and channels, or around obstructions such as gullies, shall be removed and spread uniformly over the remaining full width of the pulverised material.
 26 (05/18) Immediately prior to stabilisation, any filler and/or adhesion agent shall be spread uniformly over the full width of the layer using a mechanical spreader capable of distributing the material(s) in a uniform controlled manner. The rate of spread of these materials shall be calculated to achieve the mixture composition determined in accordance with sub-Clauses 58 to 65 of this Clause and monitored as the spreading operation proceeds in accordance with sub-Clause 35 of this Clause.
 27 (05/18) The stabilisation shall be carried out to the required depth in a systematic pattern similar to that used for the pulverisation process, with an overlap of at least 150 mm between adjacent passes of the machine. The bitumen binder shall be introduced as a foamed bitumen and distributed through the spraybar system directly into the rotor and mixing box of the stabiliser. The binder shall be supplied to the spraybar of the recycling machine by pumped pipeline from on-board tanks or from a tanker moving in tandem with the recycling machine. The rate of supply of the bitumen and any foaming agent, calculated to achieve the target binder content determined in accordance with sub-Clauses 58 to 65, shall be controlled and monitored as described in sub-Clause 36 of this Clause.
 28 (05/18) The layer of stabilised material shall be graded to level and compacted within two hours of the final pass of the stabilising plant, unless a curing or "maturing" period of aeration is required. Any furrow formed by prior excavation of edge materials shall be re-filled by grading the adjacent stabilised material into the space using a minimum amount of re-working.
 29 (05/18) The compaction of each layer shall be carried out using compaction plant approved by the Overseeing Organisation, until such time as the in-situ density complies with sub-Clauses 40 and 41 of this Clause and the stabilised layer provides a stable and dense surface. Any open or segregated surface area shall be blinded using dry crushed rock fines.
 30 (05/18) The stability of the layer under compaction shall be deemed adequate if the finished surface does not shove, rut or exhibit transverse cracking under the load of subsequent construction traffic.
 31 (05/18) Where required by the Overseeing Organisation the stability of a layer in any area shall be assessed after a curing period of at least 24 hours by channelled trafficking using a rigid three-axle tipper truck loaded to a gross mass of 24 tonnes (assumed equivalent to three standard axles). The vertical deformation shall be measured in all wheel-tracks at monitoring points on each of 5 transverse sections set 1 m apart after 5, 15, 30 and 40 passes of the truck. The mean vertical deformations at the above trafficking increments shall be plotted against the
 
 Amendment  May 2018
 
 48
 
 Volume 1 Specification for Highway Works
 
 Series 900 Road Pavements  Bituminous Bound Materials
 
 respective number of truck passes and the mean vertical deformation corresponding to 100 standard axles shall be interpolated. The layer shall be deemed acceptable if the mean vertical deformation corresponding to 100 standard axles is less than 10 mm.
 32 (05/18) On completion of compaction the surface shall be sealed using a sprayed membrane of Class K170 bitumen emulsion complying with Clause 920. The bitumen emulsion shall be sprayed at the rate stated in contract specific Appendix 7/18. Where the surface is opened to traffic, the sealing membrane shall be blinded with fine aggregate or sand applied at a rate of 5.5 to 7.0 kg/m2.
 (05/18) Process Control
 33 (05/18) The condition or quality of the pulverised material or stabilised mixture shall be assessed for specification compliance on the basis of each 800 m2 area of the works or part thereof, completed in the same working day.
 34 (05/18) The moisture content specified in sub-Clause 20 of this Clause shall be monitored using test specimens extracted from three bulk samples of pulverised aggregate taken from points evenly spaced along a diagonal bisecting the assessment area. The bulk samples shall comprise material taken from the full depth of the pulverised layer. The depth of pulverisation relative to the designed road level shall be measured and recorded at each point. The samples shall also be tested to determine the particle (or "lump") size distribution in accordance with BS EN 933-1 (or by an amended method to obtain an early assessment of grading, provided correlation with the standard test method can be demonstrated). Where appropriate, the residue of the three samples shall be combined to form one bulk sample and the bitumen content of the pulverised aggregate determined in accordance with BS EN 12697-1. If any adjustment of moisture content is carried out prior to stabilisation, subsequent samples shall be taken and further moisture content tests completed.
 35 (05/18) The rate of spread of cement, filler, hydrated lime or quicklime shall be measured by weighing the amount of material retained on each of five trays or mats of known area laid in the path of the spreading machine. The trays shall be positioned approximately at points equally spaced along a diagonal bisecting the area of coverage. The mean rate of spread and percentage addition of the material shall be determined and recorded for each assessment area.
 36 (05/18) The rate of supply of bitumen binder and any other fluids to the stabilising plant shall be set and continuously monitored using the appropriate flow rate meters on the stabilising plant. As a check at the start of each work period, the rate of supply of bitumen shall be determined from before and after dip measurements of the storage/delivery tanks, related to an area of stabilisation of not more than 250 m2. The calculated supply rate of bitumen for each test area shall be recorded.
 37 (05/18) As directed by the Overseeing Organisation, where lime has been used to modify a cohesive soil component of the pulverised aggregate, the acceptability of the modified materials shall be tested in accordance with sub-Clause 615.9.
 38 (05/18) After stabilisation, prior to final compaction of the stabilised mixture, five samples of the stabilised material shall be obtained. Each sample shall be taken from a point equally spaced along a diagonal bisecting the area under consideration. The location of each sampling point shall be recorded. Each sample shall comprise at least 40 kg of material taken from the full depth of the layer. The depth of stabilisation relative to the designed road level shall be measured and recorded at each point. Where appropriate and as directed by the Overseeing Organisation, the depth measurements shall be made using a stringline stretched between points of known level.
 39 (05/18) In the field, each sample of the stabilised material shall be mixed in a tray and sufficient representative material taken to produce a 150 mm cube specimen, made in accordance with the relevant Clauses of Series 800. The refusal density for each cube sample shall be determined to the nearest 10 kg/m3. The remainder of each sample shall be retained in a sealed condition for subsequent testing on site or in the laboratory, as described in sub-Clauses 42, 43 and 46 of this Clause.
 40 (05/18) After trimming and final compaction of the stabilised layer, the in-situ bulk density shall be measured at 50 m intervals per lane, including points close to the material sampling points, using an indirect density gauge in direct transmission mode, to a depth within 25 mm of the total layer thickness. The meter readings shall be verified periodically in accordance with BS EN 13286-2.

 Series 900 Road Pavements  Bituminous Bound Materials
 
 41 (05/18) The in-situ bulk density values obtained shall be compared with the refusal density value obtained from the cube specimens at the respective sampling points. The average in-situ bulk density of each set of five values shall be at least 95% of the cube refusal density, with no individual in-situ density value less than 93% of the respective refusal density.
 42 (05/18) Either on site or immediately on arrival at the laboratory, each of the five samples shall be tested for moisture content in accordance with BS 1377-2.
 43 (05/18) Either on site or within 24 hours of arrival at the laboratory, one 150 mm diameter by 75 mm to 100 mm high cylinder test specimen (briquette specimen) shall be manufactured from each of the five samples, compacted in a PRD mould to a target density of the average in-situ bulk density measured in the field. The final density of each briquette specimen shall be measured and using the respective moisture content values, the dry density values shall be determined.
 44 (05/18) The curing history of the five briquette specimens prior to testing shall be recorded, which shall, as soon as possible after manufacture, include a period of 72 hours at a nominal temperature of 60C. Immediately before testing, each briquette specimen shall be conditioned in air for a minimum period of 12 hours at 20C and then tested in accordance with BS EN 12697-26 (ITSM method) to determine the Indirect Tensile Stiffness Modulus (ITSM) of the material. After removal from the test apparatus, each briquette shall be immersed in water at 20C for a minimum period of 24 hours, then re-tested to determine the ITSM of the material in a saturated state.
 45 (05/18) The air voids content of each briquette shall be determined in accordance with BS 598-104 except that the maximum density for the partially coated product, used in the air voids content calculation, shall be standardised using the maximum density determined for a fully coated laboratory prepared specimen. A sample of loose pulverised aggregate obtained prior to the addition of foamed bitumen shall be dried to constant mass at 50C. Sufficient hot penetration grade bitumen shall then be added in increments to the dried aggregate in a mechanical mixer until the mixture is visually fully coated (using of the order 4% of added bitumen). The coated specimen shall be tested to determine maximum density as specified in BS EN 12697-5.
 46 (05/18) The residue of the five samples of stabilised material shall be combined to form one bulk sample. From this bulk sample, four sub-samples shall be obtained. Three sub-samples shall be tested to determine the particle size distribution and one sub-sample to determine bitumen content in accordance with BS EN 12697-1. The added bitumen content shall be the measured bitumen content of the stabilised mixture, less the bitumen content of the pulverised aggregate prior to stabilisation.

 48 (05/18) The end-product performance of the in situ cold recycled bitumen bound material shall be assessed on the basis of measurements carried out in areas of 800 m2 or part thereof completed each working day which match the areas defined in sub-Clause 33 of this Clause.
 49 (05/18) Within 24 hours of completion, the as-installed performance of the stabilised layer shall be evaluated using a dynamic plate loading or penetrometer technique to determine values of elastic modulus at points on a nominal grid pattern as described in contract specific Appendix 7/18. The elastic modulus at each point and the mean elastic modulus for the assessment area shall comply with the minimum standards stated in contract specific Appendix 7/18. Additionally, before proceeding with construction of the overlying pavement, the valuation process shall be repeated to demonstrate that the elastic modulus value at all points and that of the mean value have increased over the respective as-installed values by not less than the percentage values stated in contract specific Appendix 7/18. Where these criteria are not met, the full extent of the non-compliant material shall be determined and appropriate remedial measures implemented. Remedial action shall comprise either a delay in construction to allow further curing and stiffening of the layer to occur or a repeat of all or part of the recycling process, followed by re-evaluation, until a compliant material is achieved.
 50 (05/18) Within 270 days of completion of the surfacing works, a Falling Weight Deflectometer survey shall be carried out and analysed in general accordance with HD 29 (DMRB 7.3.2). In particular, the measurements shall be taken on the finished road surface in the nearside wheel path, at a uniform and maximum spacing of 10 m. The survey shall be carried out during a period when the pavement temperature at a depth of 50 mm is within the range

 955 (05/18) Ageing Profile Test Using a Modified Rolling Thin Film Oven Test (MRTFOT)
 (05/18) Scope
 1 (05/18) This Clause specifies the procedure for obtaining samples of `Aged Binder' after various stages of conditioning. In this way, a plot of binder properties providing an `Ageing Profile' may be accomplished in a short time using the Modified Rolling Thin Film Oven Test (MRTFOT) to simulate ageing in road materials over many years in service.
 The MRTFOT utilises the Rolling Thin Film Oven (ASTM 2872) specified in BS EN 12607-1.
 The method is suitable for generating small quantities of binder for rheological testing
 The `Ageing Profile' is generated by determining the rheological properties of complex shear (stiffness) modulus G* and phase angle  of samples taken from the oven at intervals throughout the test period, typically one day. Other properties such as durability of cohesion may also be assessed.
 Three protocols are used depending on the type of binder and its use:
 (i) a method to simulate ageing of polymer modified binder or paving grade bitumen used in the manufacture of asphalt;
 (ii) a method to remove the water phase and volatile flux from polymer modified bituminous emulsions and simulate ageing and;
 (iii) a method to test the potential for preservatives to reduce the ageing rate of bitumen.
 The `Ageing Profile' in terms of rheological characteristics provides `Product Identification' and this is essential to ensure consistency and to enable proprietary binders to be identified.
 (05/18) Warning
 2 (05/18) The use of this test method can involve hazardous materials, operations and equipment. This Clause does not purport to address all of the safety problems associated with the use of the test method. It is the responsibility of the user of these test methods to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
 (05/18) Asphalt Binders
 3 (05/18) Binders used to manufacture hot mixed asphalt (asphalt binders) are first subjected to a `Short-term Ageing Test' to simulate the effects of manufacture, transport and laying. In this respect, the test described in this Clause has been shown to be equivalent to BS EN 12607-1. The binder is continually stirred by rotating stainless steel screws in sample cans to obtain a homogeneous sample; the procedure also benefits from a faster oxidation rate (rapid ageing), because of the increased exposure to the jetted air stream and, therefore, a shorter test duration.
 The binder samples are then aged at a lower temperature and samples removed at intervals and tested to obtain an `Ageing Profile'. This is particularly useful for asphalt, because different air void contents and binder contents in a road pavement result in different ageing rates.
 The `Long-term Aged' binder sample, where the characteristics are equivalent to those obtained after 65 hours using the Pressure Ageing Vessel PAV85 Test, is obtained after 7 hours; therefore, the test may be carried out in one day. PAV85 is detailed in BS EN 14769.
 Binders used for manufacturing `Warm Asphalt' are mixed at much lower temperatures than for hot mixed asphalt and they do not need the same high temperature protocol for `Short-term Ageing'; this part of the procedure is therefore amended for these binders. All the ageing is done at the lower temperature.
 (05/18) Bituminous Emulsion Binders
 4 (05/18) Bitumen and polymer modified bituminous emulsions are first subjected to a `Rapid Recovery Test' which removes any water phase and volatile oils to produce a `Recovered Binder'. The `Recovered Binder' has similar properties to that produced from other evaporative tests, but is achieved over a shorter period and the
 
 Amendment  May 2018
 
 65
 
 Volume 1 Specification for Highway Works
 
 Series 900 Road Pavements  Bituminous Bound Materials
 
 use of nitrogen, replacing air, reduces risks associated with volatile oils in the oven. The `Recovered Binder' in rheological terms is equivalent to that recovered using BS EN 130741.
 The `Ageing Profile' is provided by continuing the ageing of the `Recovered Binder' in the MRTFO at a higher temperature, replacing the nitrogen gas with air and removing samples after specified periods for testing. A `Stabilised Binder', equivalent in rheological terms to that produced using BS EN 13074-2, may be obtained from the `Ageing Profile' Plot for a particular emulsion. Fluxed and vegetal fluxed binders where volatile oils are thought to be present may also be tested using this protocol.
 (05/18) Preservatives
 5 (05/18) 40/60 penetration grade bitumen, used as a control, is subjected to `Short-term Ageing' in the MRTFOT followed by an extended period at a lower temperature to simulate the ageing of the bitumen in a road pavement. This aged bitumen control is then cooled to ambient and treated with the preservative. Most of the volatile oils are then removed by conditioning the samples in the MRTFOT using a nitrogen blanket. The aged bitumen, treated by preservative, is then subjected to further ageing with the MRTFOT. The properties of the aged bitumen, after action of the preservative, are assessed by an `Ageing Profile' using rheology and compared with the `Ageing Profile' of the control bitumen.
 (05/18) Definitions
 6 (05/18) For the purposes of the procedures specified in this Clause the following definitions apply:
 (i) Laboratory Sample: sample of bituminous binder intended for laboratory tests. It may be a spot sample, a composite sample or a part thereof (a divided sample) as described in BS EN 58.
 (ii) Test Sample: sample of bituminous binder produced by treatment or subdivision of a laboratory sample for individual test (BS EN 58).
 (iii) Recovered Binder: material remaining after removal of water or flux from a polymer modified or unmodified bituminous emulsion or fluxed binder in the presence of nitrogen, equivalent to the recovered binder using BS EN 13074-1.
 (iv) Aged Binder: material remaining after the Ageing protocol.
 (v) Short-term Aged Binder: material obtained during the MRTFOT which is equivalent to that provided by BS EN 12607-1(RTFOT)
 (vi) Long-term Aged Binder: material obtained during the MRTFOT which is equivalent to that provided by BS EN 14769
 (vii) Ageing Profile: graphical plot of performance-related results from samples tested during the ageing protocol of this method. Performance-related testing is carried out using a Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR), providing G* and phase angle data at a determined temperature and frequency.
 (05/18) Test Apparatus (common to all protocols)
 7 (05/18) The following test apparatus shall be used:
 (i) RTFOT apparatus to BS EN 12607-1.
 (ii) Eight identifiable sample cans with threaded screw top lids (or other fixing system) manufactured from aluminium and coated on all internal surfaces with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) with internal dimensions and aperture diameter (L2) as shown below:

All screws shall have dimensions: diameter 12.2  0.2mm, length 120  0.5mm and have between 18 and 19 turns with a pitch of 6  0.2mm. The depth of cut shall be 2  0.2mm with a semi-circular profile  see Figure 9/6. At one end, the screw shall have an unthreaded shank 10 0.5mm long and 7.5  0.5mm diameter, ending in a 45 cone, truncated to give a flat end at the apex 1.5 to 2.0mm diameter. The minimum weight of a screw shall be 70g. The direction of screw shall be such that the binder sample is drawn to the closed end of the sample can bottle when the can containing the screw is rotated in the carousel. If the RTFO carousel rotates anticlockwise, viewed from the front, screws with a right-hand thread are required and if the carousel rotates clockwise, screws with a left hand thread are required.

 (05/18) Principle of the Ageing Profile Test for Polymer Modified and Unmodified Bituminous Binders for Asphalts
 8 (05/18) A thin film of binder is rotated in aluminium sample cans with screw top lids, both coated internally with PTFE (replacing glass bottles), using the Rolling Thin Film Oven Test (RTFOT) apparatus, as described in BS EN 12607-1. Special screws are used to disturb the binder and maintain a homogenous material during `Ageing'. Air is jetted over the film of binder for a much longer period than in the conventional test and a lower temperature used in order to simulate the `ageing' of the binder in the road after application. The screws accelerate the process, and are necessary to maintain a homogeneous sample, especially when testing polymer modified binders, which tend to form a skin and may phase separate in static ageing tests.
 The initial conditioning test is to simulate the changes to the properties of the binder caused by the high temperatures during manufacture, transport and laying, termed `Short-term Ageing'.
 Further ageing is carried out at a reduced temperature and samples removed after set periods and tested, so that an `Ageing Profile' may be plotted.
 (05/18) Test Procedure for Determining the Ageing Profile of Hot Mixed Polymer Modified and Unmodified Bituminous Binders for Asphalts
 9 (05/18) Obtain a sample in accordance with BS EN 58. Stir the sample thoroughly to ensure it is completely homogenized. If sub-samples are taken these shall have a minimum volume of 250ml. Ensure that the RTFO is level so that the horizontal axes of the sample cans when in position in the carousel are level. Pre-heat the oven to

 Volume 1 Specification for Highway Works
 
 Series 900 Road Pavements  Bituminous Bound Materials
 
 163  1C, 1h is generally sufficient. For binders used to manufacture warm mixed asphalts, substitute 135C for 163C throughout the test procedure.
 Insert a stainless steel screw into each of the sample cans with the tapered end of the screw towards the aperture of the container and record the mass of each assembly to 0.1g. Heat the sample cans and the stainless steel screws to 163  1C for 90  10 min.
 Heat the sample to 170  3C. Thoroughly stir the sample to ensure homogeneity immediately prior to decanting into the sample cans.
 Pour 19.0  0.5g of the sample into a preheated sample can and record the mass with lid. Immediately after weighing, roll the sample cans to ensure distribution of the binder on the walls of the can.
 Mount the sample can in the carousel of the RTFO. Repeat for the remaining sample cans. Close the door of the RTFO between mounting each sample can in the carousel. The period between weighing the first sample can with binder and mounting of all the sample cans and the start of the rotation of the carousel shall not exceed 20 minutes.
 When the carousel is fully loaded, rotate the carriage assembly at a speed of 15.0  0.2min-1. Start the flow of air at a set rate of 4000  200ml/min. Start the timer. Maintain the samples in the oven and the air flowing for 45  1min from the time the test temperature reaches 163  1C.
 If the test temperature of 163C is not reached within the first 15 minutes, discontinue the test.
 After 45  1min, sample cans (minimum 2) may be removed for testing and to determine mass loss, if required. This is the Short-term Aged binder, equivalent to RTFOT, BS EN 12607-1.
 To continue the Ageing Profile test, maintain the temperature at 163C for a further 15 minutes, with the carousel rotating in the air flow, then reduce the temperature of the oven to 135  1C. Note the time the RTFO takes to reach 135C. Once the temperature has been achieved, continue to rotate the samples in the air supply and remove sample cans to obtain samples of aged binder as required for testing after three periods:
 2h  10min; termed Aged2 Binder
 4h  10min; termed Aged4 Binder
 6h  10min; termed Aged6 Binder: this is the Long-term Aged Binder, equivalent to PAV85.
 Other periods may be used either for convenience or to allow other degrees of ageing to be investigated.

 10 (05/18) If the binder is to be tested immediately, remove a sample can from the carousel, extract the screw using a small spatula and set the screw aside for cleaning. Place the sample can(s) in an oven preheated to the softening point of the binder plus 100C (if known), or 170C if the properties of the binder are unknown, for 20  5min.
 
 Amendment  May 2018

 Volume 1 Specification for Highway Works
 
 Series 900 Road Pavements  Bituminous Bound Materials
 
 Place the containers on their sides in an oven. This allows the binder to drain to one side of the container, which is more easily removed with the spatula.
 At the end of 20  5min, remove the sample can from the oven, unscrew the lid and, using the spatula, scrape the aged binder from the sample can and prepare the test samples in accordance with the relevant test method. Warming the spatula to the same temperature as the binder facilitates removal of the binder.
 If the aged binder from more than one sample can is needed to produce a test sample, combine the aged binder from the sample cans and re-heat. Re-heating for testing shall be in accordance with BS EN 12594, ensuring that aged binder is heated for no longer than is absolutely necessary. The binder shall be thoroughly homogenized by stirring after heating and before being used for testing, while taking care not to entrain any air.
 If the binder is not to be tested immediately, remove a sample can from the RTFO, extract the screw using a small spatula and set the screw aside for cleaning. Unscrew the lid and, using the spatula, scrape the aged binder from the sample can and place on a silicon sheet. The binder shall be sealed and stored at between 0C to 5C. The sample shall be re-heated in accordance with BS EN 12594 and homogenised immediately before testing.
 If the aged samples are to be transferred to another laboratory for testing, they shall not be subjected to temperatures greater than ambient after ageing and before testing, and the delay before testing shall not exceed 120 hours.
 The thermal history of the sample shall be recorded.
 (05/18) Principle of the Ageing Profile Test for Polymer Modified or Unmodified Bituminous Emulsions or Fluxed Binders
 11 (05/18) A thin film of binder is rotated in aluminium sample cans with screw top lids, both coated internally with PTFE (replacing glass bottles), using the RTFOT apparatus, as described in BS EN 12607-1, to evaporate water from bituminous emulsions and/or the light solvent or highly volatile fraction from fluxed or other binders. Special screws are used to disturb the binder and maintain a homogenous material during breaking and/or curing. Nitrogen gas instead of air is jetted over the film of bituminous binder at a lower temperature in order to minimize ageing effects and simulate the condition of the binder soon after application. The first part of the process is carried out with the RTFO set at 85C to prevent frothing of the binder. The temperature is then increased to 135C to drive off any remaining water and/or solvent to provide the `Recovered Binder', which is equivalent to the recovered binder obtained from BS EN 130741. The `Ageing Profile' is provided by continuing the ageing of the binder in the RTFO at 135C, replacing the nitrogen gas with air and removing samples after specified periods for testing.
 (05/18) Test Procedure for Recovery and Ageing of Bituminous Emulsion and Fluxed Binders
 12 (05/18) Obtain a sample in accordance with BS EN 58. Stir the sample thoroughly to ensure it is completely homogenized. The temperature of the binder sample shall not be less than 70% of the normal application temperature in degrees Celsius and shall be recorded (for example, high binder content surface dressing emulsion may require a minimum of 60C, or a polymer modified fluxed binder, 130C). The sample history if known shall be recorded; this is important, as some ageing may have occurred. If sub-samples are taken these shall have a minimum volume of 250ml. Ensure that the oven is level so that the horizontal axes of the sample cans, when in position in the carriage, are level. Pre-heat the oven to 85  1C, 1h is generally sufficient.
 Insert a stainless steel screw into each of the sample cans with the tapered end of the screw towards the aperture of the container and record the mass of each assembly to 0.1g. Heat the sample cans, lids and the stainless steel screws to 85  1C for 90  10min.
 Heat the sample to the application temperature of the binder, or, if this is not known, to 60  3C. Thoroughly stir the sample to ensure homogeneity immediately prior to decanting into the sample cans, taking care to minimise loss of water content and/or any volatile oil. Some cut-back binders and other binders such as primers having low flash points are not suitable for this test. If there is any doubt concerning the volatile nature of the sample for test, a suitable flash point test must be carried out before proceeding with the `Ageing Profile test' or heating to 60C.
 Pour 19.0  0.5g of the sample into a preheated sample can and record the mass. Immediately after weighing, roll the containers to ensure distribution of the binder round the bottle.

 Mount the sample can in the carousel of the RTFO. Repeat for the remaining sample cans. Close the door of the RTFO between mounting each sample can in the carousel. The period between weighing the first sample can with binder and mounting of all the sample cans and the start of the rotation of the carousel shall not exceed 20 minutes.
 When the carousel is fully loaded, rotate the carriage assembly at a speed of 15.0  0.2min-1. Start the flow of nitrogen at a set rate of 4000  200ml/min. Start the timer. Maintain the samples in the oven and the nitrogen flowing for 75  1min from the time the test temperature reaches 85C. At this stage there may still be residual water in emulsion binders, especially those with high polymer contents.
 If the test temperature of 85C is not reached within the first 10 minutes, discontinue the test.
 Increase the temperature of the oven to 135  1C. Note the time the RTFO takes to reach 135C. Once the temperature has been achieved, continue to rotate the carousel for a further 30  1min at 135C. At the end of the 30 minutes, turn off the nitrogen. If required, sample cans may be removed and the samples may be used for testing or determination of mass loss. This is the `Recovered Binder' and is equivalent to that obtained using BS EN 13074-1.
 The Ageing Profile can be determined by maintaining the RTFO at 135C and switching to an air supply set at 4000  200ml/min.
 Rotate the samples in the air supply and remove sample cans to obtain samples of aged binder as required for testing after three periods:
 3h  10min; termed Aged3 Binder
 5h  10min; termed Aged5 Binder, and
 22h  10min, termed Aged22 Binder
 Other periods may be used either for convenience or to allow different degrees of ageing to be investigated. Longterm Ageing equivalent to PAV85 has been found to occur at 22 hours. It takes longer to achieve than with asphalt binder, because there is no short-term ageing at 163C. The PAV85 ageing period is not thought to be relevant for emulsion binders used in most road applications. If samples at 22 hours are not required to simulate PAV85, a combined sample from three sample cans may be useful at 3 and 5 hours, or another aged sample from two cans, say at 4 hours, may be obtained for test to enhance the `Ageing Profile'

 (05/18) Handling of the Recovered Binder
 
 13 (05/18) If the binder is to be tested immediately, remove a sample can from the carousel, extract the screw using a small spatula and set the screw aside for cleaning. Immediately transfer the sample can (s) to an oven and heat until at the required test temperature. Place the containers on their sides in an oven. This allows the binder to drain to one side of the container, which is more easily removed with the spatula.
 Unscrew the lid of the sample can and, using the spatula, scrape the recovered binder from the sample can and place in the test apparatus. Warming the spatula to 135C facilitates removal of the binder.

 If the recovered binder from more than one sample can is needed to produce a test sample, combine the recovered binder from the sample cans and re-heat. Re-heating for testing shall be in accordance with BS EN 12594, ensuring that recovered binder is heated for no longer than is absolutely necessary. The recovered binder shall be thoroughly homogenized by stirring after heating and before being used for testing, while taking care not to entrain any air.
 If the recovered binder is not to be tested immediately, remove a sample can from the RTFO, extract the screw using a small spatula and set the screw aside for cleaning. Unscrew the lid and, using the spatula, scrape the recovered binder from the sample can and place on a silicon sheet. The binder shall be sealed and stored at between 0C to 5C. The sample shall be re-heated in accordance with BS EN 12594 and homogenised immediately before testing.
 If the recovered samples are to be transferred to another laboratory for testing, they shall not be subjected to temperatures greater than ambient after recovery and before testing, and the delay before testing shall not exceed 120 hours.
 The thermal history of the sample shall be recorded.
 (05/18) Handling of the Aged Binder
 14 (05/18) If the binder is to be tested immediately, remove a sample can from the carousel, extract the screw using a small spatula and set the screw aside for cleaning. Place the sample can (s) in an oven preheated to the softening point of the binder plus 100C (if known), or 170C if the properties of the binder are unknown, for 20  5min. Place the sample cans on their sides in an oven. This allows the binder to drain to one side of the sample can, which is more easily removed with the spatula.
 At the end of 20  5min, remove the sample can from the oven, unscrew the lid and, using the spatula, scrape the aged binder from the sample can and prepare the test samples in accordance with the relevant test method. Warming the spatula to the same temperature as the binder facilitates removal of the binder.
 If the aged binder from more than one sample can is needed to produce a test sample, combine the aged binder from the containers and re-heat. Re-heating for testing shall be in accordance with BS EN 12594, ensuring that aged binder is heated for no longer than is absolutely necessary. The binder shall be thoroughly homogenized by stirring after heating and before being used for testing, while taking care not to entrain any air.
 If the binder is not to be tested immediately, remove a sample can from the RTFO, extract the screw using a small spatula, and set the screw aside for cleaning. Unscrew the lid and, using the spatula, scrape the aged binder from the sample can and place on a silicon sheet. The binder shall be sealed and stored at between 0C to 5C. The sample shall be re-heated in accordance with BS EN 12594 and homogenised immediately before testing.
 If the aged samples are to be transferred to another laboratory for testing, they shall not be subjected to temperatures greater than ambient after ageing and before testing, and the delay before testing shall not exceed 120 hours.
 The thermal history of the sample shall be recorded.
 (05/18) Principle of Assessing the Action of Preservatives using the MRTFOT
 15 (05/18) A thin film of 40/60 penetration grade binder is rotated in aluminium sample cans, coated internally with PTFE (replacing glass bottles), using the Rolling Thin Film Oven Test (RTFOT) apparatus, as described in BS EN 12607-1. Special screws are used to disturb the binder and maintain a homogenous material during conditioning. The bitumen is subjected to `Short-term Ageing' followed by an extended period in the RTFO to simulate the ageing of the bitumen in a road pavement. The properties of the `Long-term Aged' bitumen may be determined at this stage. The aged bitumen control in the remaining samples is then cooled to ambient, treated with the preservative and left for 24 hours. Most of the remaining highly volatile oils are subsequently removed by conditioning the samples in the RTFO using a nitrogen blanket. The aged bitumen, treated by preservative, is then subjected to further ageing with the Modified RTFO. The properties of the aged bitumen, after action of the preservative, are assessed by an `Ageing Profile' test, using rheology values of complex shear (stiffness) modulus G* and phase angle , in accordance with BS EN 14770. Cohesion durability may also be determined.

 (05/18) Test Procedure for Determining the `Ageing Profile' of Aged Paving Grade Bitumen as a Control Treated with a Preservative
 16 (05/18) Obtain a sample of 40/60 paving grade binder in accordance with BS EN 58. Stir the sample thoroughly to ensure it is completely homogenized. If sub-samples are taken these shall have a minimum volume of 250ml. Ensure that the RTFO is level so that the horizontal axes of the sample cans when in position in the carousel are level. Pre-heat the oven to 163  1C, 1h is generally sufficient.
 Insert a weighed stainless steel screw into each of the sample cans with the tapered end of the screw towards the aperture of the can lid; record the mass of each assembly to 0.1g. Heat the sample cans, lids and the stainless steel screws to 163  1C for 90  10min.
 Heat the sample to the maximum storage temperature of the binder. Thoroughly stir the sample to ensure homogeneity immediately prior to decanting into the sample cans.
 Pour 19.0  0.5g of the sample into a preheated sample can and record the mass. Immediately after weighing, roll the sample can on the bench to ensure distribution of the binder round the walls of the can.
 Mount the sample can in the carousel of the RTFO. Repeat for the remaining sample cans. Close the door of the RTFO between mounting each sample can in the carousel. The period between weighing the first sample can with binder and mounting of all the sample cans and the start of the rotation of the carousel shall not exceed 20 minutes.
 When the carousel is fully loaded, rotate the carriage assembly at a speed of 15.0  0.2min-1. Start the flow of air at a set rate of 4000  200ml/min. Start the timer. Maintain the samples in the oven and the air flowing for 45  1min from the time the test temperature reaches 163C.
 If the test temperature of 163C is not reached within the first 10minutes, discontinue the test.
 After 45 1min at 163  1C, sample cans (minimum 2) shall be removed for testing and to determine mass loss. This is the `Short-term Aged Binder'.
 Reduce the temperature of the oven to 135  1C. Note the time the RTFO takes to reach 135C. Once this temperature has been achieved, continue to rotate the samples in the air supply for 240  10min. At the end of this period, remove the sample cans from the RTFO and determine their mass loss.
 Remove the screws and weigh to determine the mass of binder retained on each identified screw.
 A quantity of binder shall be removed from each sample can, which shall be: 8  1g, less the mass of binder retained on the particular screw removed.
 It may be necessary to warm the sample cans to facilitate the removal of the screws and binder.
 After removing the binder, lay the sample cans on their sides and allow them to cool to ambient temperature.
 Add 10  0.5g of preservative to each sample container and swill the preservative around the sample container for approximately 15 seconds. Determine the mass of each sample can.
 The sample cans with the binder and preservative are stored on their sides, with the pooled binder at the bottom, in a ventilated fume cupboard at ambient temperature for 24 hours. This process allows any very low flashpoint volatile oil to safely evaporate and consequently reduce the amount of hydrocarbon solvent within the sample can.
 Pre-heat the oven to 50  1C, and transfer the sample cans from the fume cupboard to the RTFO carousel. Start the carousel and jet nitrogen at 4000  200ml/min over the sample cans for 120  10min.
 Identify and weigh eight clean screws and heat the screws to 135C.
 After 2 hours, the RTFO temperature is raised from 50C to 135C and air jetted at 4000  200ml/min substituted for the nitrogen supply. Note the time when the oven achieves 135C.
 When the RTFO has reached 135C, stop the carousel and add a preheated screw to each sample can, with the tapered end of the screw towards the aperture/lid of the sample can (and noting which screw is added to which sample can). Restart the carousel and continue the conditioning of the samples at 135C in air jetted at 4000  200ml/min for 120  10 min.

 Remove the sample cans from the RTFO to obtain samples of aged binder as required for testing and determine the mass of each sample can.
 The control bitumen may be substituted with a binder recovered from a road or from a laboratory aged sample, in which case the `Short-term Ageing' and subsequent ageing protocol are not carried out, because the binder will already have been aged and heated. In this case, the recovered binder sample is heated in accordance with BS EN 12594 and 11  0.5g added to heated cans (135C) which are then rolled to achieve a film around the walls. After this, they are cooled, 10  0.5g preservative added and the preservative treated samples subjected to the same Ageing Profile protocol as described above.
 (05/18) Handling of the Preservative Treated Aged Bitumen
 17 (05/18) If the binder is to be tested immediately, remove a container from the carousel, extract the screw using a small spatula and set the screw aside for cleaning. Place the sample can (s) in an oven preheated to 140C for 20  5min. Place the containers on their sides in the oven. This allows the binder to drain to one side of the container, which is more easily removed with the spatula.
 At the end of 20  5min, remove the container from the oven, unscrew the lid and, using the spatula, scrape the aged binder from the container and prepare the test samples in accordance with the relevant test method. Warming the spatula to the same temperature as the binder facilitates removal of the binder.
 If the aged binder from more than one container is needed to produce a test sample, combine the aged binder from the containers and re-heat. Re-heating for testing shall be in accordance with BS EN 12594, ensuring that aged binder is heated for no longer than is absolutely necessary. The binder shall be thoroughly homogenized by stirring after heating and before being used for testing, while taking care not to entrain any air.
 If the binder is not to be tested immediately, remove a container from the RTFO, extract the screw using a small spatula and set the screw aside for cleaning. Unscrew the lid and, using the spatula, scrape the aged binder from the container and place on a silicone sheet. The binder shall be sealed and stored at between 0C to 5C. The sample shall be re-heated in accordance with BS EN 12594 and homogenised immediately before testing.
 If the aged samples are to be transferred to another laboratory for testing, they shall not be subjected to temperatures greater than ambient after ageing and before testing, and the delay before testing shall not exceed 120 hours.
 The thermal history of the sample shall be recorded.

 18 (05/18) Sample description (e.g. type, age/condition and source).
 The Ageing Profile test procedure adopted for the work.
 The change in mass of the sample from each stage of the recovery and /or ageing protocol shall be plotted to develop an Ageing Profile for mass change.
 Similarly, results of tests (for example G* using BS EN 14770), carried out after each stage of recovery and /or ageing protocol, shall be plotted to develop an Ageing Profile for that property. These results shall include:
  A plot of G* (0.4Hz) over a range of temperatures between 0C and 60C
  A plot of phase angle (0.4Hz) over a range of temperatures between 0C and 60C
  G* and phase angle at 0.4Hz and 25C
  Temperature (0.4Hz) where the phase angle is 45 degrees (Viscous Elastic Transition (VET) temperature)
  G* (0.4Hz) at the VET temperature where phase angle is 45 degrees
 For Clause 930 hard grade binder samples and other samples where they are considered to have a softening point above 60C the temperature range shall be increased to 80C.
 The thermal history of the samples, if they are not tested immediately, shall be reported.

 2 (02/16) Transverse joint grooves which are initially constructed less than the full width of the slab shall be completed by sawing through to the edge of the slab and across longitudinal joints as soon as any forms have been removed and before an induced crack develops at the joint.
 (02/16) Sawn Transverse and Longitudinal Joint Grooves
 3 (02/16) Sawing shall be undertaken as soon as possible after the concrete has hardened sufficiently to enable a sharp edged groove to be produced without disrupting the concrete and before random cracks develop in the slab. The grooves shall be between 1/4 and 1/3 of the specified depth of the slab and of any convenient width not less than 3 mm. The sealing groove may be sawn to the required width later. Expansion joint sealing grooves shall be sealed as soon as practical after sawing.
 (02/16) Wet-formed Longitudinal Joint Grooves
 4 (02/16) When slabs are constructed in more than one lane width in one operation a joint groove shall be formed by inserting a groove former ahead of the finishing beams from dispenser. The concrete so displaced shall be recompacted by a vibrating compactor or similar device, at least 300 mm wide operating symmetrically along the line of the joint. After finishing the concrete, the groove forming strip shall be in the correct position and alignment, within 10 of the vertical, and to sufficient depth below the surface to allow for the passage of the finishing beam within the range 0-3 mm below the finished level of the slab. Groove forming strips in wet-formed longitudinal joint grooves shall be left in place.
 (02/16) Construction Joint Grooves in Surface Slabs
 5 (02/16) The grooves shall be formed by fixing a groove-former or strip or cork seal along the top edge of the slab already constructed, before concreting the adjacent slab. Where the edge of the concrete is damaged it shall be ground or made good before fixing the groove forming strip. Alternatively the subsequent slab may be placed adjacent to the first and a sealing groove sawn later in the hardened concrete to the minimum depth required in Table 10/6 or to the manufacturer's instructions if greater, and to sufficient width to eliminate minor spalling of the joint arris, up to a maximum of 25 mm for longitudinal joints and 40 mm for transverse joints. The joint shall be sealed in compliance with Clause 1016.

 1015 (02/16) Joint Filler Board
 1 (02/16) Joint filler board for expansion joints and manhole and gully slab joints shall be 25 mm thick unless otherwise shown in the drawings, within a tolerance of  1.5 mm. It shall be a self-expanding cork seal or a firm compressible material or a bonded combination of compressible and rigid materials of sufficient rigidity to resist deformation during the passage of the concrete paving plant. The depth of the joint filler board for manhole and gully slabs shall be the full depth of the slab less the depth of the sealing groove. In expansion joints, the filler board shall have a ridged top as shown on the drawings, except where a sealing groove former is indicated on the drawings.
 Holes for dowel bars shall be accurately bored or punched out to form a sliding fit for the sheathed dowel bar.
 2 (02/16) The joint filler board shall meet the requirements given when tested in accordance with the procedures in the following sub-Clauses:
 (i) Weathering Test
 (a)Three specimens, each 115 mm square  2.5 mm, shall be placed in a ventilated drying oven maintained at a temperature of 55C  5C for 7 days, after which they shall immediately be immersed in water at room temperature of between 16C and 21C for 24 hours. They shall then be subjected to five cycles of freezing and thawing in the following manner.
 (b)The specimens shall be placed in a watertight weathering test pan having a ribbed bottom and a fitted slotted lid designed to hold the three specimens vertically on edge. The pan shall be filled with water to half the depth of the specimens and then frozen to minus 7C or below, for at least four hours after the initial freezing of the water. The pan shall then be placed in a water bath maintained at 18C to 38C without disturbing the specimens and shall remain there for one hour after thawing has completed. The pan and specimens shall then be returned to the refrigerator and freezing and thawing shall be repeated in precisely the same manner until five cycles of the process have been completed. The specimens shall be removed from the pan and air dried at room temperature for 48 hours before examination.
 (c)The material shall be deemed to have passed the weathering test if the specimens show no signs of disintegration or shrinkage.
 (ii) Compression and Recovery Test
 (a)Two of the specimens which pass the weathering test, and two new specimens, each trimmed to 100 mm square  0.5 mm, maintained at room temperature and humidity for 24 hours, shall be subjected to three applications of load at 24 hour intervals in a compression test machine complying with BS EN ISO 7500-1, with auxiliary platens 100 mm2, minimum 13 mm thick. During each application of load each specimen shall be compressed to 50% of its original thickness at a rate of strain of 1.3 mm per minute. The load required to achieve this amount of compression shall be:
  not less than 0.07 N/mm2 nor more than 10 N/mm2 for material to be used in pavements; and
  not less than 0.07 N/mm2 and not more than 0.4 N/mm2 for material to be used in bridge joints.
 The load shall be released immediately the required degree of compression is reached and after the third application a recovery period of 30 minutes shall be allowed after which the thickness of the specimen shall be measured.

 Volume 1 Specification for Highway Works
 
 Series 1000 Road Pavements  Concrete Materials
 
 (b)This thickness, expressed as a percentage of the original thickness, is the `recovery' value of the specimen. The thicknesses shall be measured to an accuracy of 25 micron. The two new specimens shall be weighed before and after testing. The difference in mass shall be determined with an accuracy of 0.1% and shall be expressed as a percentage of the original mass of the specimen.
 (c)The material shall be deemed to have passed the test if all four specimens have recovery values of at least 70% and the two new specimens have not suffered a reduction of mass in excess of 1%.
 (iii) Extrusion Test
 (a)The third sample which passes the weathering test shall be trimmed to 100 mm square  0.5 mm and be subjected to the following extrusion test.
 (b)The extrusion mould shall be 100 mm x 100 mm (+ 0.5 mm,  0) internally, of sufficient depth to test the sample as received, open on one side only and fixed rigidly to a base plate. The mould shall be provided with a closely fitting pressure plate which shall fit without binding, and with an accurate horizontal measuring dial gauge or measuring device accurate to 25 microns. The specimen shall be mounted in the extrusion mould and loaded once as described in the compression and recovery test. The extrusion at the open side of the mould shall be measured with the gauge when the specimen is compressed to 50% of its original thickness and before release of the load.
 (c)The material shall be deemed to have passed the test if the extrusion of the free edge does not exceed 6 mm.
 (iv) Immersion Test for Cork Filler Board
 (a)Two specimens each 115 mm x 115 mm  2.5 mm shall be prepared and the thickness of each specimen shall be determined to the nearest 25 microns before the specimens are immersed in boiling water for one hour. After removal from the water the specimens shall be allowed to cool to room temperature and after 15 minutes at this temperature their thickness shall be remeasured to the nearest 25 microns.
 (b)The material shall be deemed to have passed the test if both specimens have a thickness of not less than 140% of their thickness before immersion.
 (v) Acid Test for Cork Filler Board
 (a)Two specimens each 115 mm x 115 mm  2.5 mm shall be immersed in hydrochloric acid of a specific gravity of 1.18 at room temperature which is then brought to the boil and maintained thus for one hour when the specimens shall be removed and rinsed in water.
 (b)The material shall be deemed to have passed the test when, after examination, the specimens show no evidence of serious disintegration, friability or lack of resilience. Discolouration or minor swelling shall not be considered as failure.
 1016 (02/16) Preparation and Sealing of Joint Grooves
 (02/16) General
 1 (02/16) All transverse joints in surface slabs, except for construction joints in CRCP shall be sealed using one of the joint seals described in Clause 1017. Additionally longitudinal joints which are sawn or widened, shall be sealed.

 3 (02/16) That part of the groove former used to form the sealing groove or any temporary seal shall be removed cleanly without damaging the joint arrises to a minimum depth of 25 mm where compression seals are used or otherwise to such depth as will provide an applied seal to the dimensions shown in Table 10/6, after allowing for any necessary caulking material described in sub-Clause 6 of this Clause. If joint grooves are not initially constructed to provide the minimum dimensions for the joint seals as given in Table 10/6, they shall be widened by sawing. Joint grooves formed by tapered formers need not be widened. The sealing grooves shall be cleaned out immediately after sawing using high pressure water jets, to remove all slurry from the joint, before the slurry hardens.
 4 (02/16) If rough arrises develop when grooves are made they shall be ground to provide a chamfer approximately 5 mm wide. If the groove is at an angle up to 10 from the perpendicular to the surface, the overhanging edge of the sealing groove shall be sawn or ground perpendicular. If spalling occurs or the angle of the former is greater than 10 the joint sealing groove shall be sawn wider and perpendicular to the surface to encompass the defects up to a maximum width, including any chamfer, of 40 mm for transverse joints and 25 mm for longitudinal joints. If the spalling cannot be so eliminated then the arris shall be repaired by suitable thin bonded arris repair using cementitious materials as specified in Clause 1032.
 5 (02/16) For applied sealants the sides of the joint sealing groove shall be scoured by dry abrasive blasting. This shall not be carried out before the characteristic compressive strength of the concrete is expected to reach 15 N/mm. When compression seals are used, the sides of the groove may be ground or wire brushed.
 6 (02/16) For hot and cold applied sealants, compressible caulking material, debonding strip or tape or cord compatible with the sealant, of a suitable size to fill the width of the sealing groove, shall be firmly packed or stuck in the bottom of the sealing groove to such a depth so as to provide the correct depth of seal as described in Table 10/6 with the top of the seal at the correct depth below the surface of the concrete.
 7 (02/16) All grooves shall be cleaned of any dirt or loose material by air blasting with filtered, oil-free compressed air. The groove shall be clean and dry at the time of priming and sealing.
 8 (02/16) For applied sealants the joint grooves shall be primed with the relevant primer for the hot or cold applied sealant in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations and with BS 5212 : Part 2, except that when necessary the joint grooves may be primed and sealed earlier than 14 days after construction, as soon as the grooves have been grit-blasted and cleaned.

When hot or cold applied sealants are used the sealant shall be applied within the minimum and maximum drying times of the primer recommended by the manufacturer. Priming and sealing with applied sealants shall not be carried out when the naturally occurring temperature in the joint groove to be sealed is below 10C except between 8C and 10C it may be carried out when the temperature is rising.
 10 (02/16) Hot-applied sealants shall be prepared and applied in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
 11 (02/16) The components of cold-applied sealants shall be thoroughly mixed in the correct proportions in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. As soon as possible after mixing and within the worklife of the sealant, the material shall be dispensed into the joint, or applied using a caulking gun, to the correct level below the concrete surface. The tack-free time shall be achieved within 3 hours for machine dispensed material, or within 12 hours for hand applied material.
 (02/16) Testing of Applied Sealants
 12 (02/16) Test certificates shall be supplied from an appropriate organisation accredited in accordance with subClause 105.4 for testing sealants stating that the sealant conforms to the relevant standard in Clause 1017. Site testing of cold-applied sealants shall be in accordance with BS 5212-2. Site testing of hot applied sealants shall be in accordance with clause 6 and Appendix A of BS 2499-2 and that the reference to BS 2499-1 in clause 6 of BS 2499-2 shall be replaced by BS EN 14188-1. Samples of hot applied sealants shall be taken and tested for initial penetration and resilience in accordance with BS EN 13880-2 and BS EN 13880-3 respectively and shall conform to the requirements of BS EN 14188-1.
 (02/16) Sealing with Compression Seals
 13 (02/16) When compression seals are used, the widths of the seal shall be selected in relation to the width of the sealing groove, the bay lengths and manufacturer's recommendations so that the estimated maximum width of the joint opening shall be not more than 70% of the original width of the seal, the estimated maximum width being calculated on the basis of a movement of 4 mm per 10 m run of slab. The maximum calculated width of sealing groove shall be 30 mm. The depth of groove shall be such that the contact face of the seal with the side of the groove shall be not less than 20 mm and that the top of the seal shall be a minimum of 3 mm below the surface of the concrete.
 14 (02/16) Compression seals shall be inserted into the grooves without prior extension or rotation and, where recommended by the manufacturer, with a lubricant adhesive which is compatible with the seal and the concrete. The adhesive shall be applied to both sides of the sealing groove or the seal, or to both. The seal shall be positioned with its axis perpendicular to the concrete surface. Excess adhesive on top of the seal shall be removed to prevent adhesion of the top faces of the seal under compression. Except when compression seals are used in longitudinal joints the transverse joint seal shall be continuous across the slab and the longitudinal joint groove forming strips shall be cut to the required depth after the concrete has hardened for the transverse seal to be inserted. If compression seals are used in longitudinal joints where the grooves have been sawn after construction of the slab they shall be continuous across transverse joints, with the transverse seals butted and fixed to the longitudinal seals with adhesive.

 2 (02/16) Sub-Clauses 3 to 6 of this Clause shall only apply to the reconstruction of existing concrete pavements. All new concrete pavement constructions shall comply with sub-Clauses 7 to 11.
 3 (02/16) After the final regulation of the surface of the slab and before the application of the curing membrane, the surface of concrete slabs to be used as running surfaces shall be brush-macrotextured in a direction at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the carriageway. The macrotexture shall be applied evenly across the slab in one direction by a brush not less than 450 mm wide. The macrotexture shall be uniform both along and across the slab.
 4 (02/16) The macrotexture depth shall be determined by the volumetric patch technique as described in BS EN 13036-1. Tests shall be taken within 100 m of commencement of paving and thereafter at least once for each day's paving at the times after construction as given below and in the following manner: 10 individual measurements of the macrotexture depth shall be taken at least 2 m apart anywhere along a diagonal line across a lane width between points 50 m apart along the pavement. No measurement shall be taken within 300 mm of the longitudinal edges of a concrete slab constructed in one pass.
 5 (02/16) Macrotexture depths shall be as required in Table 10/8.
 6 (02/16) Where the required macrotexture depth is found to be deficient the Contractor shall make good the texture across the full lane width over lengths necessary to comply with the requirements of Table 10/9, by retexturing the hardened concrete surface as described in Clause 1029. Failure to achieve a satisfactory minimum macrotexture depth by random grooving shall result in the removal of the full thickness of the slab to the extent required to permit reconstruction of the slab in accordance with the specification. If the macrotexture depth is excessive the surface shall be planed or ground or otherwise treated over lengths necessary to comply with the requirements of Table 10/8. The treatment shall not affect the requirements of Clause 702 in respect of surface levels or surface regularity.

 1027 (02/16) Curing
 1 (02/16) Immediately after the surface treatment described in Clause 1026, the surface and exposed edges of surface slabs shall be cured for a minimum period of 7 days, by the application of an approved resin based aluminised curing compound, or polythene sheeting or an approved sprayed plastic film which hardens into a peelable plastic sheet and which shall be removed before road marking and opening to traffic. Where the concrete is to receive a thin surfacing overlay, the surface and exposed edges shall be cured for a minimum of 7 days by the application of a curing agent which is compatible with the bond coat specified on the HAPAS Roads and Bridges Certificate, or equivalent, for the thin surfacing.
 2 (02/16) Resin based aluminised curing compound shall contain sufficient flake aluminium in finely divided dispersion to produce a complete coverage of the sprayed surface with a metallic finish. The compound shall become stable and impervious to evaporation of water from the concrete surface within 60 minutes of application and shall have an efficiency index of 90% when tested as described in BS 7542.
 3 (02/16) The curing compound shall not react chemically with the concrete to be cured and shall not crack, peel or disintegrate within three weeks after application.
 4 (02/16) Prior to application, the contents of any containers shall be thoroughly agitated. The curing compound shall be mechanically applied using a fine spray on to the surface at a rate of at least 0.22 1/m. For the sides of slipformed slabs or when the side forms are removed within 24 hours and for small areas where mechanical application cannot be used, the compound shall be sprayed by hand lance at a rate of at least 0.27 1/m. The rate of spread shall be checked during construction of each trial length and for each 1000 m of treated slab.
 5 (02/16) The mechanical sprayer shall incorporate an efficient mechanical device for continuous agitation and mixing of the compound in its container during spraying.
 6 (02/16) Continuously reinforced concrete bases shall be cured in accordance with this Clause. Immediately prior to laying the bituminous surfacing or upper base, a cationic bituminous tack coat shall be applied in accordance with Clause 920 at a rate between 0.35 l/m to 0.55 l/m.
 7 (02/16) To achieve high early strength for early use by vehicles, insulation blankets as described in Clause 1045 shall be used for accelerated curing.

 1028 (02/16) Trial Length
 (02/16) General
 1 (02/16) Except in rapid construction projects and unless otherwise described in contract specific Appendix 7/1, at least three months prior to the construction of the trial length of surface slabs or CRCB the Contractor shall submit a detailed description of the proposed constituent materials, concrete proportions, plant, equipment and construction methods. No trials of new constituent materials, plant, equipment or construction methods; nor any development of them shall be permitted either during the construction of the trial length or in any subsequent paving work, unless they form part of further satisfactory trials.
 2 (02/16) Unless otherwise described in contract specific Appendix 7/1, the Contractor shall demonstrate the constituent materials, concrete proportions, plant, equipment and methods of construction that are proposed for concrete paving, by first constructing a trial length of slab, at least 150 m but not more than 300 m long for mechanised construction, and at least 30 m long for hand guided methods. The concrete proportions decided by trial concrete mixes may be adjusted during the trial but shall not be changed once the trial length has been satisfactorily completed unless the Contractor lays a further trial area to assess the suitability of the proposed changes.
 3 (02/16) The trial length shall be constructed in two parts over a period comprising at least part of two separate working days, with a minimum of 75 m constructed each day when mechanised paving plant is used and a minimum of 15 m on each day for hand guided methods. The trial length shall be constructed at a similar rate to that which is proposed for the main construction in the permanent works.
 4 (02/16) At least two transverse joints and one longitudinal joint of each type that are proposed for unreinforced concrete slabs and jointed reinforced concrete slabs in the main construction in the permanent works shall be constructed and assessed in the trial length. If in the trial length expansion joints are not demonstrated, the first 2 expansion joints and at least the first 150 m of longitudinal construction joint for mechanised paving, or 30 m for hand guided method of construction laid in the main construction in the permanent works, shall be considered the trial length for these joints. One construction joint shall be demonstrated in each trial length of CRCP or CRCB.
 (02/16) Assessment
 5 (02/16) The trial length shall comply for strength and density with the specification in all respects, with the following additions and exceptions:
 (02/16) Surface Levels and Irregularity
 (i) In checking for compliance with Table 7/1 the levels shall be taken at intervals of not more than 2.5 m along any line or lines parallel to the longitudinal centre line of the trial length.
 (ii) The maximum number of permitted irregularities of pavement surfaces shall comply with the requirements of Table 7/2 for 300 m lengths. Shorter trial lengths shall be assessed pro-rata based on values for a 300 m length.
 (02/16) Joints
 (iii) At least 3 cores of minimum diameter 100 mm shall be taken from the slab at joints to check the lateral and vertical location of joint grooves and bottom crack inducers.
 (iv) Alignment of dowel bars shall be inspected as described in Clause 1019 in any two consecutive transverse joints. If the position or alignment of the dowel bars at one of these joints does not comply with Clause 1011 but if that joint remains the only one that does not comply after the next 3 consecutive joints of the same type have been inspected then the method of placing dowels shall be deemed to be satisfactory. In order to check sufficient joints for dowel bar alignment without extending the trial length unduly, the Contractor may construct joints at more frequent joint intervals than the normal spacing required in contract specific Appendix 7/1.

 1 (02/16) Worn, rain damaged or inadequately textured surface slabs shall be macrotextured by sawing grooves in the hardened concrete surface at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the pavement with machines using diamond or other abrasive cutting discs.
 2 (02/16) Grooves shall be irregularly spaced and shall be not less than 2 mm and not more than 5 mm wide. The sequence of distances between groove centres in mm shall be: 40, 45, 35, 45, 35, 50, 30, 55, 35, 30, 50, 30, 45, 50, 30, 55, 50, 40, 35, 45, 50, 40, 55, 30, 40, 55, 35, 55. A tolerance of  3 mm shall be allowed on each of the spacings. The minimum width of grooving head shall be 500 mm and a head not providing a complete sequence of spacings shall use the number of spacings appropriate to its width commencing at the start of the sequence.
 3 (02/16) Groove depths shall be measured using a tyre tread depth gauge and measurements shall be taken as follows:
 (i) At 10 locations at least 2 m apart along a diagonal line across a lane width between points 50 m apart longitudinally. No measurement shall be taken within 300 mm of the longitudinal edge of a slab.
 (ii) At each of the 10 locations the depth of 10 adjacent grooves shall be measured.
 (iii) Where a grooved area is less than 50 m in length the locations where measurements are taken shall be as (i) but the number shall be proportional to the requirements for 50 m.
 (iv) The average of each set of 10 measurements shall be not less than 3 mm, nor greater than 7 mm.

 1033 (02/16) Full Depth Repairs and Reinstatements
 (02/16) General
 1 (02/16) Full depth repairs shall be repairs which will require full depth reinstatement of the concrete slab in accordance with this Clause to the extent instructed by the Overseeing Organisation, which repairs may also require reinstatement of sub-base. Full width repairs shall be repairs over the full width of a bay or bays. Part width repairs shall be repairs over part of the width of a bay or bays. A bay shall be that portion of the concrete pavement bounded by adjacent longitudinal and transverse joints.
 2 (02/16) The area of concrete to be removed shall be marked out perpendicular to and parallel to the axis of the road.
 For continuously reinforced concrete slabs (CRCP or CRCB) the edge of the repair shall be not less than 0.5 m from the nearest crack and not less than 3 m from a transverse construction joint at ground beam anchorages. Where this and the provisions of sub-Clause 3 of this Clause would otherwise require a longitudinal repair joint within 1 m of the existing longitudinal joint or edge, the repair shall be extended to align with that longitudinal joint or edge.
 (02/16) Part Width Repairs
 3 (02/16) Providing all the following criteria are met, part width repairs may be carried out in accordance with sub-Clause 4 of this Clause:
 (i) the transverse width of the repair shall not exceed 45% of the width of the slab under repair; and
 (ii) the longitudinal joint which would be formed by the repair shall not occur within the wheeltrack; and
 (iii) the minimum transverse width of the repair shall not be less than 1.0 m.
 If these criteria and those in sub-Clause 2 of this Clause cannot be met, a full-width repair shall be made in accordance with this Clause.
 (02/16) Full Width Repairs
 4 (02/16) For full width repairs the following criteria shall apply unless otherwise specified in contract specific Appendix 7/2:
 (i) Repair lengths which do not replace an existing transverse joint shall be constructed with two transverse contraction joints and the longitudinal joint shall have tie bars in repair lengths which are greater than 1 metre.
 (ii) Repair lengths which replace a single existing transverse joint shall be constructed with two transverse joints: one expansion and one contraction. The new expansion joint shall be formed at the end which will have the shortest longitudinal distance between this joint and the joint in the adjacent lane(s). The longitudinal joint(s) between the existing joint(s) and the new expansion joint shall be constructed without tie bars and shall have 5 mm thick compressible foam within the joint for the full depth of the concrete slab. The longitudinal joint between the new contraction joint and the joint in the adjacent bay(s) shall be constructed with tie bars where the exposed length so permits.

 Series 1000 Road Pavements  Concrete Materials
 
 (iii) Repair lengths which replace more than one existing transverse joint shall be constructed with transverse joints to match expansion and contraction joints in the adjacent bay(s). Where the repair length does not replace an existing expansion joint, one end joint shall be formed as an expansion joint. Except for the end joints all transverse joints shall be formed to coincide with the existing transverse joints. Where one end joint is an expansion joint, the longitudinal joint(s) between the existing joint(s) and the new expansion joint shall be constructed without tie bars and shall have 5 mm thick compressible foam within the joint for the full depth of the concrete slab. All other longitudinal joints shall be constructed with tie bars.
 (02/16) Repair Work

For jointed slabs, the saw-cut shall be full depth to provide the face for a new joint. There shall be no over-cutting into the adjacent slab. Additional cuts within the repair area may be made to ease removal of the redundant portion of the slab. At internal corners full depth holes across the corners at the limits of the saw cuts shall be drilled prior to breaking out.
 The line of cut shall not vary by more than 25 mm throughout its length from the set out line. All sawn edges shall be perpendicular or parallel to the sides and surfaces of the slab.
 When sawing operations have been completed, and before any other operations are commenced, the surface of the carriageway shall be thoroughly cleaned of the slurry produced by sawing and of any other detritus.
 6 (02/16) The concrete shall be carefully broken out without undercutting the slab or damaging adjoining slabs. If reinforcement has to be removed sufficient shall be left for a lap length, except where a dowelled joint is being made. Reinforcement shall not be bent and subsequently straightened. Slurry from sawing, slab breaking, repair materials and other debris shall be prevented from entering joints and grooves in adjacent areas.
 7 (02/16) When a new joint is required holes shall be drilled of the appropriate size and depth for dowels or tie bars according to the type of joint. These holes shall be thoroughly cleaned of debris and dust. This shall include but not be limited to the use of oil-free compressed air at a pressure of not less than 0.5 N/mm2.
 Dowels and tie bars shall comply with the requirements of Clauses 1011 and 1012 respectively. Epoxy mortar shall be to the manufacturer's recommendation for this specific application.
 The holes shall be filled with epoxy mortar, the mortar being injected to the rear of the hole to avoid air entrapment. The dowel bars shall be inserted into the holes before the initial set of the mortar. If cartridges of epoxy mortar are used they shall be inserted into each hole, the dowel bar inserted through the cartridges and rotated for 1 minute to ensure that the epoxy mortar is well mixed. After insertion the dowels and tie bars shall be within the specified tolerances for alignment.
 Where repairs straddle a movement joint with an adjacent slab, tie bars shall be omitted and the joint between the slabs debonded to ensure that movement patterns are not restricted.
 Where contract specific Appendix 7/1 or the drawings so require, full bay replacement shall be made and this may require an expansion joint or a contraction joint to be provided at the ends of the replaced bay.
 8 (02/16) Expansion joint filler shall be fixed to one of the transverse joints. In the other transverse joint, contraction joint groove forming strips or cork seal shall be fixed to the edges of the adjacent concrete.
 If the repair is adjacent to another slab, bond between the two slabs shall be prevented by providing full depth 5 mm thick compressible foam strips to Clause 1014 along the longitudinal joint between them.
 9 (02/16) The sub-base layer and any separation membrane shall be reinstated as necessary to comply with Series 800 and Clause 1007 respectively.
 Defective sub-base material shall be removed and the sub-base reinstated to the correct level with the material described in contract specific Appendix 7/2. Reinstatement of the sub-base shall be completed before new dowel and tie bars are fixed at the joints.

 Holes of 25 mm  30 mm diameter by 50 mm deep shall be drilled at each end of the slot and the slots cleaned out using oil free compressed air.
 When in a dry state the slots shall be primed and the staple tie bars placed into beds of epoxy mortar and covered to a minimum depth of 30 mm with the same material.
 The sides of the slots shall be cleaned of loose material and the slots filled with thoroughly compacted epoxy or cementitious mortar as described in contract specific Appendix 7/2.
 After curing a groove shall be sawn along the line of the crack and sealed in accordance with Clause 1016.
 14 (02/16) For Type 2 crack repairs drilling points shall be marked out at a distance from the crack equivalent to the depth of the slab, at 600 mm intervals along the crack with alternate points on opposite sides of the crack.
 Holes of 16 mm minimum diameter shall be drilled at right angles to the crack and at approximately 26 to the surface of the slab to a depth which allows 50 mm cover at the bottom of the slab. These holes shall be thoroughly cleaned of debris and dust.
 12 mm diameter Grade 460 deformed steel tie bars shall be notched at a point which will ultimately be 50 mm below the slab surface when the bars are fully inserted into the hole.
 Each hole shall be filled with epoxy mortar and its quantity adjusted to ensure that when the tie bar is fully inserted the level of the mortar is up to a point which is 25 mm below the notch on the tie bar. Such adjustment of the epoxy mortar and the final insertion of the tie bar shall be done rapidly to ensure its completion before the initial set of the mortar. After the epoxy mortar has set, the length of tie bar above the notch shall be broken off. Once all these bars have been broken off, the tops of all these holes shall be filled with epoxy mortar.

 (02/16) General Construction Requirements
 6 (02/16) The concrete paving equipment shall comply with contract specific Appendix 10/1 as completed by the Contractor and submitted at Tender stage for approval by the Overseeing Organisation before the work commences. The general construction requirements shall be in accordance with the requirements of this Series except where otherwise stated in this Clause:
 (i) The concrete carriageway paving operation shall be undertaken as not less than a single lane width of construction using either slip-form paving machines or fixed form paving machines.
 (ii) The concrete surface layer shall be fed, spread, compacted, regulated and finished using equipment with elements to obtain the required uniform distribution and bonded embedment of the selected aggregate in the finished road surface.
 (iii) The spread concrete shall be compacted in such a manner that base layer concrete is not drawn into the surfacing and selected aggregate is uniformly present in the finished road surface.
 (iv) The surface layer shall be compacted and shaped to line and level by a combination of either internal vibration and fixed conforming plate or vibrating conforming plate.
 (v) The final regulation of the surface layer shall be provided by a transverse finishing screed in advance of a longitudinal oscillating float in accordance with Clause 1024, travelling across the slab before the application of a retarder complying with BS EN 934-2.
 (02/16) Finished Surface Requirements
 7 (02/16) The finished surface of the pavement shall comply with the requirements of Clause 702. Where a pavement area does not comply with the specification for regularity, surface tolerance, thickness, material properties or compaction or contains surface depressions, the full extent of the surface which does not comply with the specification shall be rectified by cutting out the full depth of the slab. It shall be replaced with a new slab complying with the procedures set out in Clause 1033 to the extent required to obtain compliance with the specification.
 (02/16) Production of an Exposed Aggregate Surface
 8 (02/16) In order to obtain a suitable exposed aggregate surface the main requirement shall be the removal of the surface mortar from the top of the slab to produce an exposed aggregate finish. This objective may be achieved by the application of a suitable cement set retarder which is sprayed on the surface of the fresh concrete immediately after it has been levelled and finished. Retarded mortar shall be removed by wet or dry brushing as stated in contract specific Appendix 10/1, generally no sooner than when the surface concrete has reached a maturity of 16 hours at 20C or after a suitable interval determined by trial, to achieve the requirements of sub-Clause 27 of this Clause.
 (02/16) Retarder
 9 (02/16) The composition and viscosity of the retarder shall be such that it can be spread at an adequate and uniform rate over the surface of the concrete slab in order to ensure adequate aggregate exposure during the subsequent brushing operation.
 10 (02/16) The retarder shall contain a pigment in sufficient quantity to give an even uniform colour after it has been sprayed on to the slab surface. The pigment shall be fully degraded by exposure to ultra-violet light without leaving any residue that is detrimental to the surface of the concrete.
 11 (02/16) The chemical composition of the retarder and of the curing compound shall be such that they do not react adversely following the application of the curing compound to the exposed aggregate surface.
 12 (02/16) The Contractor shall use the retarder which he has nominated in contract specific Appendix 10/1. This shall be of a type and composition to satisfy the requirements of this Clause.

 Volume 1 Specification for Highway Works
 
 Series 1000 Road Pavements  Concrete Materials
 
 (02/16) Application of the Retarder
 13 (02/16) The retarder shall be spread evenly on to the surface of the wet concrete slab as soon as practicable after the surface layer has been levelled and finished, by a spray bar over the full width of the slab in one pass. To achieve this uniformity of spread, the spraying system shall consist of a spray bar, provided with nozzles, mounted on a machine spanning the slab. Temporary works materials and equipment shall be chosen in order to permit inspection to ensure adequate coverage of retarder immediately after spraying and before protection of the surface.
 14 (02/16) Before commencing work, the level of the spray bar, the rate of delivery of the retarder from the nozzles of the spray bar, and the forward speed of the spraying machine shall be adjusted to achieve the required rate of spread. Means shall be provided and steps shall be taken to avoid excess retarder flowing on the surface of the slab.
 15 (02/16) Back-up spraying equipment shall be available on the site at all times for use in case of a breakdown of the spraying machine.
 (02/16) Protection of the Surface after the Application of the Retarder
 16 (02/16) The finished surface of the pavement concrete after application of retarder shall be protected against precipitation, moisture loss, contamination and dispersal of the retarder by air movements as stated in contract specific Appendix 10/1. This protection shall be applied immediately after the application of the retarder.
 17 (02/16) Where waterproof sheeting is used it shall be laid onto the surface of the concrete immediately after the retarder has been sprayed. It shall be retained in position until immediately prior to exposing of the aggregate.
 18 (02/16) The protection system shall not adversely affect either the finish, the line or the level of the concrete surface or the even distribution of the retarder in any way. Where sheeting is used, any air bubbling or blistering shall be prevented.
 (02/16) Exposing the Aggregate Surface
 19 (02/16) Brushing equipment shall be used to expose the concrete surface aggregate. Where the brushing equipment runs on the slab the concrete shall have gained sufficient strength to avoid any damage to the concrete.
 20 (02/16) Removal of the protection system shall take place as brushing proceeds. If waterproof sheeting is used as a protection system it shall be maintained in position until immediately in advance of the brushing operation.
 21 (02/16) The Contractor shall complete the process of exposing the aggregate before the retarder becomes ineffective. Failure to do so shall entail the remedial measures specified in sub-Clauses 29 and 30 of this Clause.
 (02/16) Brushing System
 22 (02/16) Sufficient brushing capability shall always be maintained on site to complete the exposure of the aggregate before the retarder becomes ineffective. An adequate back-up brushing facility shall be available on the site at all times for use in case of a breakdown of the brushing equipment.
 23 (02/16) The brushing equipment nominated by the Contractor in contract specific Appendix 10/1 shall be used to produce an even macrotexture on the surface of the slab. Brushing shall be carried out in the longitudinal direction of the concrete slab.
 24 (02/16) The brushing equipment shall be capable of maintaining an adequate brush rotational speed which in conjunction with the forward working speed is sufficient to remove the surface mortar. Adequate dust suppression and collection measures shall be in operation at all times.
 25 (02/16) When complying with the requirements of sub-Clause 19 of this Clause, the wheels of any brushing equipment which may run on the slab shall be fitted with tyres with a shallow tread pattern and a low inflation pressure and be sufficiently wide to avoid damage to the concrete.

 (02/16) Protection of the Surface Layer After Exposure of the Aggregate
 26 (02/16) Within one hour of completing exposure of the aggregate the surface shall be dampened with water. A curing compound shall be applied to the entire exposed aggregate surface of the slab in accordance with Clause 1027. In wet weather the curing compound shall be applied as soon as practicable after the rain stops. The surface may, alternatively, be covered by hessian provided it is maintained in a wet condition at all times during the curing period of the concrete.
 (02/16) Surface Macrotexture Depth and Remedial Measures
 27 (02/16) The texture depth of the surface of the concrete shall be measured using a volumetric patch technique described in BS EN 13036-1. The average macrotexture depth of each 1000 m section of carriageway lane, or each carriageway lane where less than 1000 m, shall comply with the requirements of contract specific Appendix 7/1. Any individual result shall be neither greater than the maximum, nor be less than the minimum value of macrotexture depth stated in contract specific Appendix 7/1.
 28 (02/16) During brushing, initial interim spot check measurements of the surface macrotexture depth shall be made as soon as it is considered that the required texture depth has been reached. This shall continue until the specified macrotexture depth has been achieved.
 29 (02/16) In the event that it is not possible to achieve the specified minimum macrotexture depth by further exposure, the Contractor shall treat the surface in accordance with Clause 1029 to achieve the specified macrotexture depth. This treatment shall not be applied until the concrete has reached an age of 28 days and shall not affect the requirements of sub-Clauses 702.2 to 702.4 and 702.5 to 702.9.
 30 (02/16) Failure to achieve a satisfactory minimum macrotexture depth by mechanical means shall result in removal of the full thickness of the slab to the extent required to permit reconstruction of the slab in accordance with the specification. Where the maximum macrotexture depth is exceeded suitable remedial measures shall be employed.
 (02/16) Preliminary Trials
 31 (02/16) The Contractor shall carry out preliminary trials to demonstrate to the Overseeing Organisation, not less than one month prior to the commencement of the trial length referred to in sub-Clauses 37 to 39 of this Clause, the materials, concrete proportions and methods for achieving the macrotexture depth requirements defined in contract specific Appendix 7/1.
 32 (02/16) Preliminary trial panels shall be constructed off-line incorporating a top surface of exposed aggregate concrete similar to that specified for the permanent works. These panels shall be 20 m long and not less than 100 mm deep, and the maximum intended paving width. They shall be used to enable the Contractor to determine the required application rate of the retarder and the amount of brushing required to achieve the specified macrotexture depth.
 33 (02/16) The trial panels may alternatively be constructed on-site, but in this case, they may only form part of the permanent works if they meet all the requirements of the specification, otherwise they shall be removed after they have served their purpose.
 34 (02/16) The surface macrotexture depth shall be determined by volumetric patch technique at approximately 2 m spacings along a diagonal line across each trial panel, and shall follow the procedure described in BS EN 13036-1.
 35 (02/16) The average value of each set of 10 individual measurements shall be taken as the resulting macrotexture depth which shall be assessed against the specification.
 36 (02/16) The materials including all the aggregates, plant and equipment used in the preliminary trials shall be equivalent to that which will be used in the Trial Length.

 (02/16) Trial Length
 37 (02/16) In addition to the requirements of Clause 1028, the macrotexture depth shall be tested for compliance in accordance with sub-Clauses 38 and 39 of this Clause.
 38 (02/16) Macrotexture depth shall be assessed by the volumetric patch technique for each 50 m length of the trial length and for each lane, and shall follow the procedure in BS EN 13036-1.
 39 (02/16) During the construction of the Trial Length, spot checks shall be made as soon as it is considered that the required macrotexture depth has been reached. Should the texture depth be found to be inadequate, further exposure of the aggregate shall be undertaken until the specified macrotexture depth has been achieved. Where the macrotexture depth is not achieved, and the trial was intended to form part of the running surface of the permanent works, the remedial measures described in sub-Clauses 29 and 30 of this Clause shall apply.
 1045 (02/16) Weather Conditions for Laying of Cementitious Materials
 1 (02/16) Road pavement materials in a frozen condition shall not be incorporated in the works but may be used, if acceptable, when thawed.
 2 (02/16) Road pavement materials shall not be laid on any surface which is frozen or covered with ice.
 3 (02/16) The temperature of concrete in any pavement layer shall not be less than 5C at the point of delivery. These materials shall not be laid when the air temperature falls below 3C and laying shall not be resumed until the rising air temperature reaches 3C unless all surfaces of the concrete slabs are protected by thermal insulation blankets laid immediately after placing and finishing the concrete. The insulation shall be placed before the temperature of the concrete surface has dropped below 2C and shall be retained for a minimum of 3 days or until the concrete is assessed to have reached 50% of the specified characteristic compressive strength provided the air temperature is above 0C and rising at that time. Thermal insulation blankets shall be closed cell polyethylene foam sheets, minimum 10 mm thick with a `U' value of 4 watts/m C (or K value of 0.04 watts/m Kelvin) or suitable material with an equivalent or lower thermal conductivity. They shall be sufficiently robust and capable of being held in place against variations in wind and weather conditions for the necessary curing time.
 1046 to 1047 (02/16) Not Used
 
 1048 (02/16) Use of Surfaces by Traffic and Construction Plant
 1 (02/16) Construction plant and traffic used on pavements under construction shall be suitable in relation to the material, condition and thickness of the courses it traverses so that damage is not caused to the subgrade or the pavement courses already constructed. The wheels or tracks of plant moving over the various pavement courses shall be kept free from deleterious materials.
 2 (02/16) Concrete slabs may be used by traffic when the cube compressive strength is assessed to have reached 25 N/mm2 for pavement surface slabs, or 20 N/mm2 for bases with asphalt surfacing. The method of assessing the time when this strength is reached shall be as described in Clause 1004.
 3 (02/16) In the absence of test data establishing compliance with sub-Clause 2 of this Clause, no vehicle with an axle loading greater than 2 tonnes shall run on concrete slabs within a period of 14 days after placing the concrete. Vehicles with rubber tyres with an axle loading less than 2 tonnes, or wheels or tracks of concreting plant, shall not use any part of a newly constructed pavement within 7 days. The above periods before traffic may run on the pavement shall be increased if the 7 day cube strength is below that required in the specification. These periods shall be extended by one day for each night on which the temperature of the layer falls to 0C or below.

 The Contractor shall supply sample joints cut from complete lighting columns for destructive testing as selected on behalf of the Overseeing Organisation. The sample joints shall be cut from the column, extension piece, bracket and welded anchorage where relevant. The basis of selection shall be as follows:
 a) For orders of 1 to 10 lighting columns - one complete lighting column for each type, unless destructive testing has been carried out within the last year on a lighting column of that type. The manufacture, supply and verification of lighting columns and bracket arms shall comply with the quality management scheme described in Appendix A.
 b) For orders of 11 to 300 lighting columns one complete lighting column for each type unless destructive testing has been carried out within the last month on a lighting column of that type where the lighting column to be tested was also selected on behalf of the Overseeing Organisation.
 c) For orders exceeding 300 lighting columns two complete lighting columns for each type.
 Acceptance criteria shall be as specified in 7.1.4, except that in 7.1.4.2 the throat and leg dimension shall apply to the true rather than the apparent dimension.
 In the event that there is a non-conformance arising from a serious deviation in materials, preparation, assembly, or welding procedure, the batch concerned shall be rejected and further production of the columns affected stopped until such time as the fault has been corrected. A minor non-conformance shall only be accepted on the basis that further sampling and testing shows that fault is not repetitive and in the view of the Overseeing Organisation will not in that instance impair structural integrity.

 Definitions
 1 "Allowable pile capacity": a capacity which takes into account the pile's bearing capacity, the materials from which the pile is made, the required load factor, settlement, pile spacing, downdrag, the overall bearing capacity of the ground beneath the piles and other relevant factors.
 2 "Commencing surface": the level at which the piling equipment first enters the ground.
 3 "Compression pile": a pile which is designed to resist an axial force such as would cause it to penetrate further into the ground.
 4 "Constant rate of penetration (CRP) test": a test in which the pile is made to penetrate the ground at a constant controlled speed, while the force applied at the top of the pile to maintain the rate of penetration is continuously measured.
 5 "Constant rate of uplift (CRU) test": a test in which the pile is made to lift out of the ground at a constant controlled speed, while the force applied at the top of the pile to maintain the rate of extraction is continuously measured.
 6 "Cut-off level": the level to which the pile is trimmed.
 7 "Design Verification Load (DVL)": a load which will be substituted for the Specified Working Load for the purpose of a test.
 8 "Kentledge": dead load used in a loading test.
 9 "Load factor": the ratio between the pile's ultimate bearing capacity and maximum safe bearing capacity.
 10 "Maintained load test": a loading test in which each increment of load is held constant either for a defined period of time or until the rate of movement (settlement or uplift) falls to a specified value.
 11 "Preliminary pile": a pile installed before the commencement of the main piling works or specific part of the Works.
 12 "Proof load": a load applied to a selected working pile to confirm that it is suitable for the load at the settlement specified.
 
 13 "Raking pile": a pile installed at an inclination to the vertical.
 14 "Reaction system": the arrangement of the kentledge, piles, anchorages or spread foundations that provide a resistance against which the pile is tested.
 15 "Pile settlement": the axial movement at the top of the pile. The value of pile settlement specified for a given load refers to the value reached at the end of the first cycle of loading. Where piles are to be loaded and unloaded through a number of cycles settlement shall be the cumulative vertical movement.
 16 "Specified Working Load (SWL)": the specified load on the head of the pile as stated in the relevant Appendix.
 17 "Tension pile": a pile which is designed to resist an axial force such as would tend to cause it to be extracted from the ground.

Each face of a pile shall not deviate by more than 6 mm from any straight line 3 m long joining two points on that face, nor shall the centre of area of the pile at any cross-section along its length deviate by more than 1/500 of the pile length from a line joining the centres of area at the ends of the pile. Where a pile is less than 3 m long the permitted deviation from straightness shall be reduced below 6 mm on a pro rata basis in accordance with actual length.
 The head of a pile element or the end of the pile upon which the hammer acts shall be square to the pile axis within a tolerance of 1 in 150.
 Reinforcement for precast reinforced and prestressed concrete piles
 6 (11/03) Steel reinforcement shall be as described in Appendix 16/2 and in accordance with Series 1700.
 The main longitudinal reinforcing bars in piles not exceeding 12 m in length shall be in one continuous length. In piles more than 12 m long, joints will be permitted in main longitudinal bars so that the number of joints is minimised. Joints in reinforcement shall be such that the full strength of the bar is effective across the joint.
 Lap or splice joints shall be provided with link bars designed to resist eccentric forces. Reinforcement shall be incorporated for lifting and handling purposes.
 Spacers shall be designed and manufactured using durable materials which shall not lead to corrosion of the reinforcement or spalling of the concrete cover. Where required in Appendix 16/2, details of the means by which the Contractor plans to ensure the correct cover to and position of the reinforcement shall be submitted.
 Reinforcement for precast reinforced concrete segmental piles
 7 (11/03) Steel reinforcement shall be as described in Appendix 16/2 and in accordance with Series 1700.
 The main longitudinal reinforcing bars shall be in one continuous length. Reinforcement shall be incorporated for lifting and handling purposes.
 Spacers shall be designed and manufactured using durable materials which shall not lead to corrosion of the reinforcement or spalling of the concrete cover. Where required in Appendix 16/2, details of the means by which the Contractor plans to ensure the correct cover to and position of the reinforcement shall be submitted.
 
 8 If a pile is constructed with a shaped point or shoe, then the end of the pile shall be symmetrical about the longitudinal axis of the pile. Holes for handling or pitching, where provided in the pile, shall be lined with steel tubes; alternatively, inserts may be cast in.
 Formwork shall be robust, clean and so constructed as to prevent loss of grout or aggregate from the wet concrete and ensure the production of uniform pile sections, free from defects. The piles shall be removed from the formwork in such a manner that damage to the pile is prevented.
 Concrete
 General
 9 Cement materials, aggregates, admixtures and water shall be in accordance with Series 1700.
 The method of placing and compacting the concrete shall be such as to ensure that the concrete in its final position is dense and homogeneous.
 Protecting and curing concrete
 10 Immediately after compaction, concrete shall be adequately protected from the harmful effects of the weather, including wind, rain, rapid temperature changes and freezing. Curing and accelerated curing shall comply with Clause 1710.
 Piles shall not be removed from formwork until a sufficient pile concrete strength has been achieved to allow the pile to be handled without damage.
 Prestressing
 General
 11 Prestressing operations shall be carried out only under the direction of an experienced and competent supervisor. All personnel operating the stressing equipment shall have been trained in its use.
 The extensions and total forces, including allowance for losses, shall be calculated before stressing commences.
 Stressing of tendons and transfer of prestress shall be carried out at a gradual and steady rate.

 12 The Contractor shall cast sufficient cubes, cured in the same manner as the piles, to be able to demonstrate by testing two cubes at a time, with appropriate intervals between pairs of cubes, that the necessary in situ strength of the concrete has been reached.
 Concrete in the piles shall not be stressed until two test cubes attain the necessary strength.
 Records
 13 The Contractor shall keep detailed records of times of tensioning, measured extensions, pressure gauge readings or load cell readings and the amount of pull-in at each anchorage. The Contractor shall also check the cover to reinforcement of each pile and shall ensure it is at least that specified. Copies of these records shall be provided where required in Appendix 16/2.
 Post-tensioned piles
 14 Apart from the requirement for ducts and vents in post-tensioned piles to be grouted after the transfer of prestress, the requirements for pre-stressed piles apply.
 Grouting procedure
 15 Grout shall be mixed for a minimum of 2 minutes and until a uniform consistency is obtained.
 Ducts shall not be grouted when the air temperature in the shade is lower than 3C.
 Before grouting is started all ducts shall be thoroughly cleaned by means of compressed air which shall be free of oils.
 Grout shall be injected near the lowest point in the duct in one continuous operation and allowed to flow from the outlet until the consistency is equivalent to that of the grout being injected.
 Vents in ducts shall be provided in accordance with Clause 1711.
 Grout
 16 Grout for prestressing shall have the following properties:
 a) (11/03) The design and consistence of grout to be used in the formation of piles shall produce a mix which is suitable for pumping.
 b) (11/03) Grout shall consist only of Portland cement CEM I to BS EN 197-1, water and admixtures. Admixtures are only to be used in accordance with the Manufacturer's instructions and shall comply with Clause 1703.
 Amendment - November 2003
 
 c) (11/03) Grout shall have a water/cement ratio as low as possible consistent with the necessary consistence, and the water cement ratio shall not exceed 0.40.
 d) Grout shall not bleed in excess of 2% after 3 hours, or a maximum of 4%, when measured at 18C in a covered glass cylinder approximately 100 mm in diameter with a height of grout of approximately 100 mm, and the water shall be reabsorbed after 24 hours.
 Testing works grout
 17 (11/03) Cube strength testing shall be carried out in accordance with BS EN 12390-1. A sample shall consist of a set of six 100 mm cubes. Three cubes shall be tested at seven days and the remaining three at 28 days after casting.
 Batching grout
 18 The weighing and water-dispensing mechanisms shall be maintained at all times to within the limits of accuracy described in BS 1305.
 The weights of each component of the mix shall be within 2% of the respective weights per batch.
 Mixing grout
 19 Cement grouts shall be mechanically mixed using:
 a) high speed colloidal mixer (minimum speed = 1000 revs/minute); or
 b) paddle mixer (minimum speed = 150 revs/minute)
 or other suitable mixer subject to satisfactory evidence of performance.
 The grout shall be mixed on site until a homogenous grout is obtained and shall be kept in continuous movement until it is used. It shall be used within 30 minutes from the start of mixing. Following mixing the grout shall be passed through a 5 mm aperture sieve and shall be remixed if lumps are retained.
 Transporting grout
 20 Grout shall be transported from the mixer to the position of the pile in such a manner that segregation of the mix does not occur.
 Placing grout in cold weather

 Volume 1 Specification for Highway Works
 
 Series 1600 Piling and Embedded Retaining Walls
 
 Records
 22 The Contractor shall keep records of grouting, including the date, the proportions of the grout and any admixtures used, the pressure, details of interruption and topping up required. Copies of these records shall be provided where required in Appendix 16/2.
 Pile quality
 23 A certificate of quality from the pile manufacturer shall be provided where required in Appendix 16/2 stating that the requirements of this Specification have been fulfilled during manufacture.
 Marking of piles
 24 (11/03) Each pile shall be marked in such a manner that it can be identified with the records of manufacture which shall state the date of casting, the cement type, concrete strength class, element length, the prestressing force where appropriate and any other relevant data. On delivery the piles shall be accompanied by records of manufacture. Lifting positions shall be marked on each pile in accordance with the requirements of design.
 Handling, transportation and storage of piles
 25 The method and sequence of lifting, handling, transporting and storing piles shall be such as to avoid shock loading and to ensure that the piles are not damaged. Only designed lifting and support points shall be used. During transport and storage, piles shall be appropriately supported under the marked lifting points or fully supported along their length.
 All piles within a stack shall be in groups of the same length. Packing of uniform thickness shall be provided between piles at the lifting points.
 Concrete shall at no time be subjected to loading, including its own weight, which will induce a compressive stress in it exceeding 0.33 of its strength at the time of loading or of the specified strength, whichever is the lesser. For this purpose an assessment of the strength of the concrete and of the stresses produced by the loads shall be carried out.
 A pile shall be rejected when the width of any transverse crack exceeds the value given in Table 1 of BS 5400 : Part 4. The measurement shall be made with the pile in its working attitude.
 Driving piles
 Strength of piles
 26 Piles shall not be driven until the concrete cubes have achieved the specified characteristic strength or
 
 the pile has attained the strength to resist driving stresses, whichever is the greater.
 Leaders and trestles
 27 At all stages during driving and until incorporation into the structure the pile shall be adequately supported and restrained by means of leaders, trestles, temporary supports or other guide arrangements to maintain position and alignment and to prevent damage to the pile.
 Performance of driving equipment
 28 Where required in Appendix 16/2, the Contractor shall provide information on the efficiency and energy of the driving equipment including when followers are used. Where required in Appendix 16/2, (or 16/6 as appropriate), dynamic evaluation and analysis shall be provided.
 Where a drop hammer is used, the mass of the hammer shall be at least half that of the pile or pile segment. For other types of hammer the energy delivered to the pile per blow shall be at least equivalent to that of a drop hammer of the stated mass. Drop hammers shall not be used from floating craft in such a manner as to cause instability of the craft or damage to the pile.
 Length of piles
 29 The length of pile to be driven in any position shall be as specified in Appendix 16/2. During the execution of the Works any amendments to the scheduled lengths shall be recorded by the Contractor and a full statement of the reasons included in the pile record.
 Driving procedure and redrive checks
 30 The driving procedure shall be such as to avoid damage to the piles.
 The Contractor shall comply with all the particular requirements of Appendix 16/2 on driving resistances and characteristics.
 The driving of each pile shall be continuous until the depth or set as required by the design has been reached. In the event of unavoidable interruption to driving, the pile may be redriven provided it can subsequently be driven to the designed depth and/or resistance or set without damage. A follower shall not be used unless the set is revised where applicable in order to take into account reduction in the effectiveness of the hammer blow.
 Driving records shall be made for every pile. This record shall contain the weight and fall of the hammer or ram and the number of blows for each 0.25 m of penetration, unless otherwise specified in Appendix 16/2, (or 16/5 or 16/6 as appropriate).
 
 Amendment - November 2003
 
 8
 
 Volume 1 Specification for Highway Works
 
 Series 1600 Piling and Embedded Retaining Walls
 
 Any unexpected change in driving characteristics shall be included in the pile record.
 Set
 31 The set and temporary compression shall be measured and recorded for each pile at the completion of driving unless otherwise stated in Appendix 16/2, (or 16/6 as appropriate).
 When a set is being measured, the following requirements shall be met.
 (a) The exposed part of the pile shall be in good condition without damage or distortion.
 (b) The helmet, dolly and any packing shall be in sound condition.
 (c) The hammer blow shall be in line with the pile axis and the impact surfaces shall be flat and at right angles to the pile and hammer axis.
 (d) The hammer shall be in good condition, delivering adequate energy per blow, and operating correctly.
 (e) The temporary compression of the pile shall be recorded if required in Appendix 16/2, (or 16/6 as appropriate).
 The set shall be recorded either as the penetration in millimetres per 10 blows or as the number of blows required to produce a penetration of 25 mm.
 Driving sequence and risen piles
 32 Piles shall be driven in a sequence to minimise any detrimental effects of heave and lateral displacement of the ground. The sequence and method of piling including preboring shall limit uplift and lateral movement so that the final position of each pile is within the specified tolerances. At all times the deflections of each pile from its axis as driven shall not be such as to cause damage or impair durability of the piles or any structures or services.
 The maximum permitted uplift of each pile due to any one pile driven within a pile centre to centre radius of eight pile diameters is 3 mm or such figure as shall be specified unless it can be demonstrated by static load testing that uplift exceeding this amount does not affect the ability of the pile to meet the requirements of this Specification.
 Even if during the installation of preliminary piles uplift is shown to be within the permitted maximum and the preliminary piles tested meet the requirements of the Specification, checks of uplift on working piles shall be made by the Contractor at least once a week
 
 throughout the period of the piling work and the results recorded.
 If preliminary piles are not installed the Contractor shall commence installation of working piles taking measures to reduce or eliminate uplift until it can be established by site measurements that such measures are no longer necessary. Thereafter checks on uplift shall be made by the Contractor at least once a week and the results recorded.
 If a static load test shows that a pile which uplifted more than the maximum permitted amount due to any pile driven within a radius of eight pile diameters does not comply with the requirements of the Specification all such piles that may have been uplifted shall be redriven.
 If records and measurements show that piles have been laterally displaced so as to be outside the permitted tolerance or damaged the measures the Contractor plans to adopt to enable the piles to comply with the Specification shall be provided in accordance with Appendix 16/2.
 Laterally displaced piles shall not be corrected by forcible correction at the heads.
 Preboring
 33 If preboring is specified, the diameter and depth of prebore shall be as stipulated in Appendix 16/2.
 Other means to ease pile drivability may be used provided the completed piles meet the requirements of the Specification.
 Repair and lengthening of piles
 Repair of damaged pile heads
 34 If it is necessary to repair the head of a pile before it has been driven to its final level, the Contractor shall carry out such repair in a way which allows the piledriving to be completed without further damage. If the driving of a pile has been completed but the level of sound concrete of the pile is below the required cut-off level, the pile shall be made good to the cut-off level, or the pile cap or substructure may be locally deepened, so that the completed foundation will safely withstand the specified working load.
 Lengthening of precast reinforced and prestressed concrete piles
 35 Any provision for lengthening piles incorporated at the time of manufacture shall be designed by the Contractor to resist all stresses to which it may be subjected.
 
 March 1998
 
 9
 
 Volume 1 Specification for Highway Works
 
 Series 1600 Piling and Embedded Retaining Walls
 
 If no provision for lengthening piles was incorporated at the time of manufacture, any method for lengthening shall be such that the extended pile including any joints is capable of taking safely the stresses during driving and under load.
 Lengthening of segmental piles
 36 Where piles are driven to depths exceeding those expected, leaving insufficient projection for penetration into the following works, the piles shall be extended or replaced so that the completed piles are capable of meeting the requirements of the Specification.
 Driving repaired or lengthened piles
 37 Repaired or lengthened piles shall not be driven until cubes for the added concrete have reached the specified characteristic strength of the concrete of the pile.
 Cutting off pile heads
 38 When the driving of a pile has satisfied the Specification requirements the concrete at the head of the pile shall be cut off to the level specified. Reinforcing bars projecting above this level shall be as specified.
 Care shall be taken to avoid shattering or otherwise damaging the rest of the pile. Any cracked or defective concrete shall be cut away and the pile repaired to provide a full and sound section to cut-off level.
 1603 Bored Cast-in-Place Piles
 Support fluid
 1 Where support fluid is used to maintain the stability of the excavation it shall be in accordance with Clause 1618.
 Diameter of piles
 2 The diameter of a pile shall be not less than the specified diameter.
 The auger width shall be checked as necessary and recorded for each pile to ensure the specified diameter is achieved. A tolerance of +5% -0 on the auger width is permissible.
 Boring
 Boring near recently cast piles
 3 Piles shall be bored in an order and in such a manner that no damage is sustained by previously formed piles.
 Amendment - November 2003
 
 Casings
 4 (11/03) Temporary casings shall be of quality of material, length and thickness adequate for the purpose of preventing water and unstable soil from entering the pile excavations. A short length of temporary casing shall be provided for all piles to provide an upstand of at least 1 m above surrounding ground level for safety and to prevent contamination of the concrete in the bore.
 Temporary casings shall maintain the excavations to their full dimensions and ensure that piles are completed to their full cross-sectional dimensions.
 The use of a vibrator to insert and withdraw temporary casings is subject to compliance with Clause 109 (Control of Noise and Vibration) and sub-Clause 1601.28 and to the method not causing disturbance of the ground which would adversely affect the construction or the capacity of piles.
 Temporary casings shall be free from significant distortion. They shall be of uniform cross-section throughout each continuous length. During concreting, they shall be free from internal projections and encrusted concrete which might adversely affect the proper formation of piles.
 Where piles are bored under water or support fluid in an unlined state, the insertion of a full-length loosely fitting casing to the bottom of the bore prior to placing concrete will not be permitted.
 If required, permanent casings shall be specified in Appendix 16/3.
 Stability of pile bore
 5 Where boring takes place through unstable waterbearing strata, the process of excavation and the support fluid and depth of temporary casing where employed shall be such that soil from outside the area of the pile is not drawn into the pile section and cavities are not created outside the temporary casing as it is advanced.
 Where a support fluid is used for maintaining the stability of a bore, an adequate temporary casing shall be used in conjunction with the support fluid so as to ensure stability of the strata near ground level until concrete has been placed. During construction the level of drilling fluid in the pile excavation shall be maintained within the cased or stable bore so that it is not less than 2 m above the level of external standing groundwater at all times, unless stated otherwise in Appendix 16/3.
 Pumping from pile bores
 6 Pumping from pile bores shall not be permitted unless the bore has been sealed against further water

 Where the cut-off level of working piles is below the ground level at the time of pile installation and where it is required to carry out a proof test from that installation level, either allowance shall be made in the determination of the design verification load for friction which may be developed between the cut-off level and the existing ground level, or the pile may be sleeved appropriately or otherwise protected to eliminate friction which develops over the extended length.
 Supervision
 8 The setting-up of pile testing equipment shall be carried out under competent supervision and the equipment shall be checked to ensure that the setting-up is satisfactory before the commencement of load application.
 All tests shall be carried out only under the direction of an experienced and competent supervisor conversant with the test equipment and test procedure. All personnel operating the test equipment shall have been trained in its use.
 Safety precautions
 General
 9 Design, erection and dismantling of the pile test reaction system and the application of load shall be carried out according to the requirements of the various applicable statutory regulations concerned with lifting and handling heavy equipment and shall safeguard operatives and others who may from time to time be in the vicinity of a test from all avoidable hazards.

 Kentledge
 10 Where kentledge is used the Contractor shall construct the foundations for the kentledge and any cribwork, beams or other supporting structure in such a manner that there will not be differential settlement, bending or deflection of an amount that constitutes a hazard to safety or impairs the efficiency of the operation. The kentledge shall be adequately bonded, tied or otherwise held together to prevent it becoming unstable because of deflection of the supports or for any other reason.
 The weight of kentledge for each test shall be greater than the maximum test load for that test, and if the weight is estimated from the density and volume of the constituent materials an adequate factor of safety against error shall be allowed. Additional kentledge required shall be determined taking into account the accuracy of positioning of the centre of gravity of the stack.
 Tension piles, reaction piles and ground anchorages
 11 Where tension piles, reaction piles or ground anchorages are used to provide the necessary load reaction, they shall be so designed that they will resist the forces applied to them safely and without excessive deformation which could cause a safety hazard during the work. Such piles or anchorages shall be placed in the specified positions, and bars, tendons or links shall be aligned to give a stable reaction in the direction required. Any welding employed to extend or to fix anchorages to a reaction frame shall be carried out so that the full strength of the system is adequate and unimpaired.
 Testing equipment
 12 (11/03) In all cases the Contractor shall ensure that when the hydraulic jack and load-measuring device are mounted on the pile head the whole system will be stable up to the maximum load to be applied.
 If in the course of carrying out a test any unforeseen occurrence should take place, further loading shall not be applied until a proper engineering assessment of the condition has been made and steps have been taken to rectify any fault. Reading of gauges shall, however, be continued where possible and if it is safe to do so.
 Where an inadequacy in any part of the system might constitute a hazard, means shall be provided to enable the test to be controlled from a position clear of the kentledge stack or test frame.
 The hydraulic jack, pump, hoses, pipes, couplings and other apparatus to be operated under hydraulic pressure shall be capable of withstanding a pressure of 1 times the maximum pressure used in the test without leaking.
 Amendment - November 2003
 
 The maximum test load expressed as a reading on the gauge in use shall be displayed and all operators shall be made aware of this limit.
 Pile head for compression test
 13 For a pile that is tested in compression, the pile head or cap shall be formed to give a plane surface which is normal to the axis of the pile, sufficiently large to accommodate the loading and settlement measuring equipment and adequately reinforced or protected to prevent damage from the concentrated application of load from the loading equipment.
 Any pile cap shall be concentric with the test pile; the joint between the cap and the pile shall have a strength equivalent to that of the pile.
 Sufficient clear space shall be made under and around any part of the cap projecting beyond the section of the pile so that, at the maximum expected settlement, load is not transmitted to the ground by the cap.
 Pile connection for tension test
 14 For a pile that is tested in tension, means shall be provided for transmitting the test load axially without inducing moments in the pile. The connection between the pile and the loading equipment shall be constructed in such a manner as to provide a strength equal to the maximum load which is to be applied to the pile during the test, with an appropriate factor of safety on the structural design.
 Reaction systems
 Compression tests
 15 Compression tests shall be carried out using kentledge, tension piles or specially constructed anchorages. Kentledge shall not be used for tests on raking piles.
 Where kentledge is to be used, it shall be supported on cribwork and positioned so that the centre of gravity of the load is as close as possible to the axis of the pile. The bearing pressure under supporting cribs shall be such as to ensure stability of the kentledge stack.
 Tension tests
 16 Tension tests may be carried out using compression piles, rafts or grillages constructed on the ground to provide the necessary reaction. In all cases the resultant force of the reaction system shall be coaxial with the test pile.
 Where inclined piles or reactions are specified or their use is planned by the Contractor, full details shall be made available prior to the commencement of testing.

 Working piles
 17 If the Contractor plans to use working piles as reaction piles, he shall notify his intention prior to commencement of work. Working reaction piles shall not uplift by more than half their specified permissable settlement at working load. The integrity of all working piles used as reaction piles shall be checked on completion of static load testing.
 Where working piles are used as reaction piles their movement shall be measured and recorded to within an accuracy of  0.5 mm.
 Spacing
 18 Where kentledge is used for loading vertical piles in compression, the distance from the edge of the test pile to the nearest part of the crib supporting the kentledge stack in contact with the ground shall be not less than 1.3 m.
 The centre-to-centre spacing of vertical reaction piles, including working piles used as reaction piles, from a test pile shall be not less than three times the diameter of the test pile or the reaction piles or 2 m whichever is the greatest. Where a pile to be tested has an enlarged base, the same criterion shall apply with regard to the pile shaft, with the additional requirement that no surface of a reaction pile shall be closer to the base of the test pile than one half of the enlarged base diameter. Where vertical reaction piles penetrate deeper than the test pile, the centre-to-centre spacing of the reaction piles from the test pile shall be not less than five times the diameter of the test pile or the reaction piles whichever is the greatest unless the base capacity of the test pile is less than 20% of the total ultimate capacity.
 Where ground anchorages are used to provide a test reaction for loading in compression, no section of fixed anchor length transferring load to the ground shall be closer to the test pile than three times the diameter of the test pile. Where the pile to be tested has an enlarged base the same criterion shall apply with regard to the pile shaft, with the additional requirement that no section of the fixed anchor transferring load to the ground shall be closer to the pile base than a distance equal to the base diameter.
 Adequate reaction
 19 The reaction frame support system shall be adequate to transmit the maximum test load in a safe manner without excessive movement or influence on the test pile. Calculations shall be provided when required to justify the design of the reaction system.
 March 1998
 
 Care of piles
 20 The method employed in the installation of the reaction system shall be such as to prevent damage to any test pile or working pile.
 Equipment for applying load
 21 The equipment used for applying load shall consist of a hydraulic ram or jack. The jacking system shall be arranged in conjunction with the reaction system to deliver an axial load to the test pile and maintain it constant when required. The complete system shall be capable of safely transferring the maximum load required for the test. The length of stroke of a ram shall be sufficient to cater for deflection of the reaction system under load plus a deflection of the pile head up to 15% of the pile shaft diameter unless otherwise specified in Appendix 16/9.
 Measurement of load
 22 The test load shall be measured by a single load cell or proving ring calibrated in divisions not exceeding 1% of the maximum load to be applied. If an electronic transducer is used each reading shall be immediately stored magnetically so that in case of power failure the readings are not lost.
 The load cell or proving ring shall be calibrated immediately prior to the test and a certificate of calibration shall be made available.
 All increments of load shall be maintained to within 1% of the specified load.
 A spherical seating of appropriate size shall be used to avoid eccentric loading. Care shall be taken to avoid any risk of buckling of the load application and measuring system. Load measuring and application devices shall be short in axial length in order to secure stability. The Contractor shall ensure that axial loading is maintained.
 Control of loading
 23 The loading equipment shall enable the load to be increased or decreased smoothly or to be held constant at any required value.
 Measuring pile head movement
 Maintained load test
 24 In a maintained load test, movement of the pile head shall be measured by the method in sub-Clause 26 and by one of the methods in sub-Clauses 27, 28 and 29 in the case of vertical piles, or by one of the methods in sub-Clauses 27, 28 and 29 in the case of the raking piles, as required.

 Series 1600 Piling and Embedded Retaining Walls
 
 CRP and CRU test
 25 In a constant rate of penetration (CRP) or a constant rate of uplift (CRU) test the method in subClause 26 shall be used. Check-levelling of the reference frame or the pile head shall not be required. The dial gauge shall be graduated in divisions of 0.02 mm or less.
 Optical levelling method
 26 An optical levelling method by reference to a remote datum may be used.
 Where a level and staff are used, the level and scale of the staff shall be chosen to enable readings to be made to within an accuracy of 0.5 mm. A scale attached to the pile or pile cap may be used instead of a levelling staff. At least two reliable independent datum points shall be established. Each datum point shall be so situated as to permit a single setting-up position of the level for all readings.
 No datum point shall be located where it can be affected by the test loading or other operations on or off the Site.
 Reference beams and dial gauges
 27 An independent reference beam or beams shall be set up to enable measurement of the movement of the pile to be made to the required accuracy. The supports for a beam shall be founded in such a manner and at such a distance from the test pile and reaction system that movements of the ground do not cause movement of the reference beam or beams which will affect the accuracy of the test. The supports of the beam or beams shall be at least three test pile diameters or 2 m from the centre of the test pile, whichever distance is the greater. The beam must be free to move horizontally at one end.
 Check observations of any movements of the reference beam or beams shall be made and a check shall be made of the movement of the pile head relative to a remote reference datum at the start and end and at maximum load for each loading cycle.
 The measurement of pile movement shall be made by four dial gauges rigidly mounted on the reference beam or beams, bearing on prepared flat surfaces fixed to the pile cap or head and normal to the pile axis. Alternatively, the gauges may be fixed to the pile and bear on prepared surfaces on the reference beam or beams. The dial gauges shall be placed equidistant from the pile axis and from each other. The dial gauges shall enable readings to be made to an accuracy of at least 0.1 mm and have a stem travel of at least 25 mm. Machined spacer blocks may be used to extend the range of reading. Equivalent electrical displacementmeasuring devices may be substituted.
 March 1998
 
 Reference wires and scales
 28 Two parallel reference wires, one on either side of the pile, shall be held under constant tension at right angles to the test pile axis between supports formed as in the method in sub-Clause 27. The wires shall be positioned against scales fixed to the test pile head in an axial direction and the movements of the scales relative to the wires shall be determined.
 Check observations of any movements of the supports of the wires shall be made and a check shall be made on the movement of the pile head at appropriate time intervals. Readings shall be taken to within an accuracy of 0.5 mm.
 Other methods
 29 Where appropriate the Contractor may use an alternative method of measuring the movement of the test pile head. The method shall be accurate to within 0.5 mm of the pile head movement.
 Protection of testing equipment
 Protection from weather
 30 Throughout the test period all equipment for measuring load and movement and beams shall be protected from adverse effects of sun, wind and precipitation. Temperature reading shall be taken at the start, end and at the maximum load of each loading cycle.
 Prevention of disturbance
 31 Construction activity and persons who are not involved in the testing process shall be kept at a sufficient distance from the test to avoid disturbance to the measuring apparatus. Full records shall be kept of any unavoidable activity and its effects.
 Notice of test
 32 The Contractor shall give at least 24 hours notice of the commencement of the test. No load shall be applied to the test pile before the commencement of the specified test procedure.
 Test procedure
 Proof load test procedure (working compression piles)
 33 The maximum load which shall be applied in a proof test shall normally be the sum of the design verification load (DVL) plus 50% of the specified working load (SWL). The loading and unloading shall

 Any particular requirements given in Appendix 16/9 shall be complied with.
 Following each application of an increment of load, the load shall be maintained at the specified value for not less than the period shown in Table 16/6 and until the measured rate of settlement in a period of 30 minutes is less than 0.5% of the current cumulative settlement which has occurred, subject to a minimum settlement rate of 0.05 mm in 30 minutes. The rate of settlement shall be calculated from the slope of the line obtained by plotting values of settlement versus time and drawing a smooth curve through the points.
 Each stage of unloading shall proceed after the expiry of the period shown in Table 16/6.
 For any period when the load is constant, time and settlement shall be recorded immediately on reaching the load, at not more than five minute intervals up to 15 minutes, at approximately 15 minutes intervals up to one hour, at 30 minute intervals between one hour and four hours, and 1 hour intervals between four hours and 12 hours after the application of the increment of load.
 Where the methods of measuring pile head movement given in sub-Clauses 26, 28 and 29 are used, the periods of time for which loads must be held constant to achieve the specified rates of settlement shall be extended as necessary to take into account the lower levels of accuracy available from these methods and to allow correct assessment of the settlement rate.
 
 Test procedure for preliminary compression piles
 34 The procedure to be adopted for carrying out preliminary load tests on compression piles shall be in
 
 accordance with the requirements specified in Appendix 16/9 and either the extended proof load test procedure or the constant rate of penetration testing procedure given below. A normal proof load test will constitute the first stage of such a preliminary test unless otherwise specified.
 Extended proof load test procedure
 Where verification of the required minimum load factor is called for, the loading procedure may be carried out as a continuation of the proof load testing procedure given in sub-Clause 33.
 Following the completion of the proof load test, the load shall be restored in two stages (DVL, DVL + 50% SWL), and shall subsequently be increased by stages of 25% of the specified working load or other specified amount until the maximum specified load for the test is reached. Following each application of an increment of load, the load shall be maintained at the specified value for not less than 30 minutes and until the additional measured settlement in a period of 30 minutes is less than 0.5% of the current cumulative settlement which has occurred since the start of the current load increment, subject to a minimum settlement rate of 0.05 mm in 30 minutes. The rate of settlement shall be calculated from the slope of the line obtained by plotting values of settlement versus time and drawing a smooth curve through the points. Reduction of load at the end of the test shall be gradual as required by subClause 36 and the final recovery of the pile head shall be recorded.
 Permissible settlement at the load corresponding to the required minimum factor of safety called for in the design will not normally be specified. (The mobilization of ultimate load for compression piles normally involves settlements of at least 10% of the pile base diameter in clay and more in granular soils. The settlement of piles bearing on rock requires special consideration, and failure of pile materials may precede failure of the rock).
 Constant rate of penetration (CRP) testing procedure
 The rate of movement of the pile head shall be maintained constant in so far as is practicable and shall be approximately 0.01 mm/s for piles in predominantly cohesive soils and 0.02 mm/s for piles in predominantly cohesionless soils.
 Readings of loads, penetration and time shall be made simultaneously at regular intervals; the interval chosen shall be such that a curve of load versus penetration can be plotted without ambiguity.

 Loading shall be continued until one of the following results is obtained:
 a) the maximum required test load as specified in accordance with Appendix 16/9 is reached
 b) a constant or reducing load has been recorded for an interval of penetration of 10 mm
 c) a total movement of the pile base equal to 10% of the base diameter, or any other greater value of movement specified in Appendix 16/9, has been reached.
 The load shall then be reduced in five approximately equal stages to zero load, penetration and load at each stage and at zero load being recorded.
 Testing of piles designed to carry load in tension
 35 The testing of piles designed to carry load in tension shall follow the same procedure as specified in sub-Clauses 33 and 34.
 The rate of movement of the pile head shall be maintained at approximately 0.005 mm/s in so far as is practicable.

 Dimensions of panels
 5 The thickness of a panel shall be not less than the specified thickness. The length of panel may be varied to suit an individual Contractor's equipment but any upper limits on length because of geological or other external factors shall be specified in Appendix 16/10. Within these constraints the Contractor shall be responsible for selecting panel dimensions which ensure stability and that movements remain within the criteria set in Appendices 16/1 and 16/10.
 Excavation
 Excavation near recently cast panel
 6 Panels shall not be excavated so close to other panels which have recently been cast and which contain workable or unset concrete that a flow of concrete or instability could be induced from or damage caused to any panel. The Contractor's sequence of construction shall be submitted prior to work commencing in accordance with Clause 1601.
 Stability of the excavation
 7 Support fluid for maintaining the stability of an excavation shall be in accordance with Clause 1618 of this Specification. A suitable guide wall shall be used in conjunction with the method to ensure stability of the strata near ground level until concrete has been placed. During construction the level of support fluid in the excavation shall be maintained within the guide wall or stable ground so that it is not less than 1.5 m above the level of external standing groundwater at all times.
 In the event of a loss of support fluid from an excavation, the Contractor shall include a full statement of the reasons in the pile record.
 Cleanliness of base
 8 Prior to placing steel or concrete the Contractor shall clean the base of the excavation of as much loose, disturbed and remoulded materials as practical and in accordance with the method of construction and shall wholly or partly remove and replace support fluid while maintaining the fluid head if it does not comply with the Contractor's stated limits for support fluid prior to concreting.
 Steel reinforcement
 9 The number of joints in longitudinal steel bars shall be kept to a minimum. Joints in steel reinforcement shall be such that the full strength of each bar is effective across the joint and shall be made so that there is no detrimental displacement of the reinforcement during the construction of the panel. Reinforcement
 
 shall be maintained in its correct position during concreting of the panel. Where it is made up into cages, they shall be sufficiently rigid to enable them to be handled, placed and concreted without damage. If the cage is to be welded together, welding shall be carried out to the requirements of BS 7123.
 Spacers shall be designed and manufactured using durable materials which shall not lead to corrosion of the reinforcement or spalling of the concrete cover. Where required in Appendix 16/10, details of the means by which the Contractor plans to ensure the correct cover to and position of the reinforcement shall be submitted.
 The minimum projecting bond lengths required by Appendix 16/10 shall be observed.
 The Contractor shall prepare reinforcement detail construction drawings for each panel and these shall be made available.
 Placing concrete
 General
 10 (11/03) The consistence and method of placing of the concrete shall be such that a continuous monolithic concrete panel of the full cross-section is formed, and that the concrete in its final position is dense and homogenous. Concrete shall be transported from the mixer to the position of the wall in such a manner that segregation of the concrete mix does not occur.
 Before commencement of concreting of a panel, the Contractor shall satisfy himself that the supplier will have available sufficient quantity of concrete to construct the panel in one continuous operation.
 The concrete shall be placed without such interruption as would allow the previously placed batch to have achieved a stiffness which prevents proper amalgamation of the two concrete batches.
 No spoil, liquid or other foreign matter shall be allowed to contaminate the concrete.
 (11/03) Consistence of concrete
 11 (11/03) The concrete consistence shall be determined using the slump or flow classes in accordance with BS EN 12390-2 and BS EN 12390-5 respectively. The slump or flow classes for concrete placed through support fluid using a tremie pipe shall be class S4 or greater or classes F4 to F5 respectively or as specified in Appendix 16/10.
 Compaction
 12 Internal vibrators shall not be used to compact concrete within a cast in place panel.

 Series 1600 Piling and Embedded Retaining Walls
 
 Placing concrete
 13 The concrete shall be placed through a tremie pipe in one continuous operation. Where two or more pipes are used in the same panel simultaneously, care shall be taken to ensure that the concrete level at each pipe position is maintained nearly equal.
 The hopper and pipe of the tremie shall be clean and watertight throughout. The pipe shall extend to the base of the panel and a sliding plug or barrier shall be placed in the pipe to prevent direct contact between the first charge of concrete in the tremie and the support fluid.
 The pipe shall at all times penetrate the concrete which has previously been placed with a minimum embedment of 3 m and shall not be withdrawn from the concrete until completion of concreting. At all times a sufficient quantity of concrete shall be maintained within the pipe to ensure that the pressure from it exceeds that from the support fluid and workable concrete above the tremie base. The internal diameter of the pipe of the tremie shall be not less than the greater of 150 mm or six times the maximum aggregate size. It shall be so designed that external projections are minimised, allowing the tremie to pass within reinforcing cages without causing damage. The internal face of the pipe of the tremie shall be free from projections.
 The depth of the surface of the concrete shall be measured and the embedded length of the tremie pipe recorded at regular intervals corresponding to each batch of concrete. The depths measured and volumes placed shall be plotted immediately on a graph and compared with the theoretical relationship of depth against volume.
 Tolerances
 Guide wall
 14 The finished face of the guide wall towards the excavation and on the side of the excavation nearest to any subsequent main excavation shall be vertical to within a tolerance of 1 in 200 and the top edge of the wall shall represent the reference line. There shall be no ridges or abrupt changes on the face and its variation from its specified position shall not exceed  15 mm in 3 m.
 The minimum clear distance between the guide walls shall be the specified diaphragm wall thickness plus 25 mm and the maximum distance shall be the specified diaphragm wall thickness plus 50 mm.
 Diaphragm wall
 15 At cut-off level the maximum deviation of the centre line of each panel from the specified position shall be 15 mm and an additional tolerance of 8 mm for
 March 1998
 
 each 1.0 m that the cut-off level is below the top of the guide wall shall be permitted unless otherwise stated in Appendix 16/10.
 The exposed wall face and the ends of panels shall be vertical within a tolerance of 1:120 for walls constructed using grabs. A tolerance of 1:200 may be specified if there is a special need and an expectation of reverse circulation cutters being used. An additional tolerance of 100 mm will be allowed for concrete protrusions resulting from cavities formed by overbreak in the ground. Where very soft clay layers or peat layers are anticipated or obstructions are to be removed during trench excavation, an additional overbreak tolerance shall be stated in Appendix 16/10.
 Recesses
 16 Where recesses are to be formed by inserts in the wall, the vertical tolerance shall be that of sub-Clause 17 and the horizontal tolerance shall be that of subClause 17 plus the horizontal tolerance resulting from sub-Clause 15.
 Steel reinforcement
 17 The longitudinal tolerance of the cage head at the top of the guide wall measured along the excavation shall be  75 mm.
 The vertical tolerance of the cage head measured relative to the guide wall shall be +150/-50 mm. The reinforcement shall be maintained in position during concreting of a panel.
 Temporary stop-ends in diaphragm panels
 18 Temporary stop-ends shall be of the length, thickness and quality of material adequate for the purpose of preventing water and soil from entering the panel excavations.
 Each temporary stop-end shall be straight and true throughout. The external surface shall be clean and free from distortions that may affect panel integrity during removal of the temporary stop-end.
 Stop-ends shall be rigid and adequately restrained to prevent horizontal movement during concreting.
 Concrete level
 19 If the cut off level for the panel is less than 1 m below the top level of the guide walls, uncontaminated concrete shall be brought to the top of the guide walls. If the cut off level is greater than 1m below the top level of the guide walls, concrete shall be brought to 1 m above the cut off level specified, with a tolerance of 150 mm. An additional tolerance of + 150 mm over the above tolerances shall be permitted for each 1.0 m

 The tremie pipe shall be at least 3 m long.
 Placing concrete under water or support fluid
 14 Concrete to be placed under water or support fluid shall be placed through a tremie pipe in one continuous operation.
 The hopper and pipe of the tremie shall be clean and watertight throughout. The pipe shall extend to the base of the boring and a sliding plug or barrier shall be placed in the pipe to prevent direct contact between the first charge of concrete in the pipe of the tremie and the water or support fluid. The pipe shall at all times penetrate the concrete which has previously been placed with a minimum penetration of 3 m and shall not be withdrawn from the concrete until completion of concreting.
 At all times a sufficient quantity of concrete shall be maintained within the tremie pipe to ensure that the pressure from it exceeds that from the water or support fluid and workable concrete above the tremie base.
 The internal diameter of the pipe of the tremie shall be not less than the greater of 150 mm or six times the maximum aggregate size. It shall be so designed that external projections are minimised, allowing the tremie to pass through reinforcing cages without causing

 Extensometers
 3 The instrumentation shall be securely attached to the reinforcement cage so that no component is displaced during placing of the reinforcement cage or concreting. During concreting, the tubing shall be adequately covered at both ends to prevent the ingress of concrete. Compression or extension couplings shall be installed as necessary for the movement range specified in Appendix 16/17.
 The system will be such that the anchor and reference blocks shall be securely cast into the pile concrete. The rod shall be made of fibreglass or similar material so that it will not corrode or distort nor change its length due to heat or water changes.
 The top of the rod shall incorporate a range adjuster with a travel of 25 mm.
 If direct measurements are specified the displacement measuring device shall consist of a rechargeable digital dial gauge with 240 V. mains battery charger or analogue dial gauge. The orientation of the dial gauge relative to the top of the tube shall be constant for every reading. If remote reading is specified the readings shall be made by a linear potentiometer or other suitable device, securely held in place.
 Inclinometers
 4 (11/03) The access tubing shall be securely attached to the reinforcement cage so that no component is displaced during placing of the reinforcement cage or concreting. During concreting, the tubing shall be adequately covered at both ends to prevent the ingress of concrete. Alternatively, a nominal 100 mm steel duct sealed at the lower end and fitted with a removable screw cap at the upper end, shall be attached to the reinforcement cage. The inclinometer access tube can then be installed afterwards using a cementitious grout containing a non-shrink admixture.
 The system shall consist of 60 mm nominal diameter corrosion-proof access tubing which shall have four longitudinal internal keyways on two orthogonal axes. The keyways shall be continuous over the length of the access tubing so that the wheels of the torpedoes can pass freely along it. For embedded walls, the keyways shall be oriented so that one set are parallel to the face of the wall. The coupling between sections of the access tube shall ensure that the correct alignment of keyways is maintained through a joint. Jointing rivets to connect the tube sections shall be located midway between keyways. Sealing mastic shall be applied to each rivet head and to the points where the tubing enters a coupling. All joints shall be sealed by liberally wrapping with a fabric tape impregnated with a waterproofing compound. This procedure shall also be carried out for the end-caps.
 Amendment - November 2003
 
 The inclinometer readout equipment shall comprise a uniaxial or biaxial torpedo complete with operating cable, cable reel, grip, carrying case, cartridge readout unit and battery charger. The torpedo shall be fully waterproof, stainless steel and incorporate two robust force servo accelerators aligned at right angles to each other. The torpedo shall be fitted with two orthogonal pairs of centre sprung wheels and shall have a gauge length of 0.5 m and be capable of negotiating a tube curvature of 3 m. The cable shall be of an appropriate length. The readout unit shall have an alphanumeric LCD and rechargeable battery with sufficient power for 20 hours continuous use. The Contractor shall supply a calibration frame for checking the readout equipment.
 Alternatively a string of electrolevels may be used. Sufficient electrolevels shall be incorporated to provide an accurate deformation profile.
 The "azimuth deviation" shall be recorded for each inclinometer access tube and shall be taken into account when processing the data. Where azimuth correction is necessary, the Contractor shall make available details of the method used.
 Readings shall be taken for the full length of each inclinometer access tube for faces A, B, C and D. The top wheel of the torpedo will travel up face A first followed by faces B, C and D when using a uniaxial torpedo. With a biaxial torpedo, only faces A and B are travelled.
 If a full set of readings cannot be obtained due to accumulation of debris in the access tubes, the Contractor shall flush the tubes with water to remove the debris until readings can be taken.
 The readings shall be taken in increments of 0.5 m starting from the base of the access tube. All readings shall be recorded and reported to the nearest 0.1 mm. The readings are considered to be sufficiently accurate only if the "face errors" in the A/B plane and the C/D plane are less than 1.5 mm.
 The datum readings to be used in the calculations for each inclinometer shall be made available.
 The data shall be processed assuming a fixed base. The surveyed cumulative horizontal movement of the top of the access tube shall be reported to an accuracy of 0.5 mm. When required, the data shall also be processed assuming a specified offset at the top of the access tube.
 The processed data for faces A, B, C and D shall be tabulated to show the following:
 a) deviations and face errors
 b) mean deviation
 c) change in mean deviation
 45
 
 Volume 1 Specification for Highway Works
 
 Series 1600 Piling and Embedded Retaining Walls
 
 d) cumulative mean deviation
 e) displacement profiles.
 Items (c) and (e) shall also be presented graphically to show the deviation or displacement plotted against depth.
 Load cells
 5 (11/03) The loads to be measured may be either compressive or tensile, as specified in Appendix 16/17. The load cells shall have a response time of two seconds or less in response to monotonically increasing or decreasing loading.
 The monitoring system shall provide a stable signal and any temperature or cable length or other effects on the load signal shall be included in the permissible tolerance. If a hydraulic or pneumatic system is used it shall be rated for and have been tested to twice the anticipated maximum pressure. The load cells and cabling shall be compatible with their intended position within a pile and shall be unaffected by the presence of water or fluid concrete. They shall be sufficiently strong to withstand additional loading due to placing of the reinforcement cage and concreting.
 As the cell will give a direct reading of load, it shall be positioned so that all the load passes through it without any eccentricity. The loading system shall be safe and stable.
 Pressure cells
 6 The pressure cells shall have a response time of 2 seconds or less in response to monotonically increasing or decreasing loading.
 The monitoring system shall provide a stable signal and any temperature or cable length or other effects on the pressure signal shall be included in the permissible tolerance. If a hydraulic oil, pneumatic or mercurybased system is used it shall be rated for and have been tested to twice the anticipated maximum pressure. The pressure cells and cabling shall be compatible with their intended position within a pile and shall be unaffected by the presence of water or fluid concrete. They shall be sufficiently strong to withstand additional loading due to placing of the reinforcement cage and concreting.
 If the pressure cell is to be placed against concrete on one or both sides, it shall be provided with a mercury filled re-pressurising tube to ensure that no gap occurs between the hardened concrete and the pressure cell.
 Amendment - November 2003
 
 Strain gauges
 General
 7 The strain gauges shall have a response time of 10 seconds or less. The monitoring systems shall provide a stable signal and any temperature or cable length or other effects on the signal shall be included in the permissible tolerance. The strain gauges and cabling shall be compatible with their intended position within a pile and shall be unaffected by the presence of water or fluid concrete. They shall be sufficiently strong to withstand additional loading due to placing of the reinforcing cage and concreting or pile driving.
 Strain gauges attached to steel or precast concrete piles
 8 The strain gauges shall be securely attached to a mounting plate welded to the steel for steel piles, or securely attached to the reinforced concrete for precast concrete piles. The welding procedures of Clause 1606 shall be followed. The method of attachment shall be sufficiently strong so the gauge is not displaced, nor the wires or cables damaged by driving.
 Strain gauges embedded in concrete
 9 Strain gauges for cast in situ piles shall be either the embedment variety or shall be securely attached to reinforcement bars or to `sister' bars which shall be attached to the reinforcement cage. The methods of attachment shall be such that the gauge is not displaced, nor the wires or cables damaged by placing of the reinforcement, concreting, driving or other processes.
 Readings
 General
 10 Readings shall be reported in terms of the basic property measured (eg. volts, hertz, mm of Mercury) and shall be converted to SI or derivative units by means of a calibration constant. The calibration constant and the range over which it is applicable shall be clearly stated.
 Readings shall be taken at the times or time intervals specified in Appendix 16/17.
 Calibration and data checking
 11 The instrumentation shall be calibrated prior to incorporation into the works and a certificate of calibration shall be made available. For strain gauges a calibration constant can be provided if evidence is available showing that the variation in calibration constant will not vary maximum readings outside the specified tolerance.

 The instrumentation shall be calibrated so that its behaviour has been monitored over the range specified in Appendix 16/17. The Contractor shall demonstrate that the type of instrumentation can provide a stable, reproducible and repeatable calibration.
 All data shall be checked by the Contractor for errors prior to submission. If erroneous data are discovered (eg. face errors for inclinometer readings greater than 1.5 mm), the Contractor shall take a second set of readings immediately. If the errors are repeated, the Contractor shall determine the cause of the error. Both sets of readings shall be processed and submitted, together with the reasons for the errors and details of remedial works. The Contractor shall rectify any faults found in the instrumentation system for the duration of the specified monitoring period.
 All computer data files and calculation sheets used in processing the data shall be preserved until the end of the contract. They shall be made available for inspection on request.
 Tolerances
 12 For load or pressure, a tolerance of  1% of the range specified in Appendix 16/17 is permissible. For strain, a tolerance of  2 x 10-6 is permissible. For displacement, a tolerance of  0.1 mm is permissible.
 Except where explicitly specified in Appendix 16/17, no instrumentation device, tubing or cable shall be placed in the concrete cover zone.

 Formwork as described in sub-Clause 1710.2 shall be capable of producing the following finishes where  required in the works:
 Class F1. A dense finish with no grout or mortar loss with the specified cover to embedded metal and achieving the specified dimensional tolerances.
 Class F2. As the requirements of F1 and the irregularities in the finish shall be no greater than those obtained from the use of wrought thicknessed square edged boards arranged in a uniform pattern. The finish is intended to be left as struck but imperfections such as fins and surface discolouration shall be made good.
 Class F3. As the requirements of F1 and the resulting finish shall be smooth and of uniform texture and appearance. The formwork lining shall leave no stain on the concrete and shall be so joined and fixed to its backing that it imparts no blemishes. It shall be of the same type and obtained from only one source throughout any one structure. The Contractor shall make good any imperfections in the finish. Internal ties and embedded metal parts shall not be used.
 Class F4. The requirements for Class F4 are as for Class F3 except that internal ties and embedded metal parts shall be permitted. The ties shall be positioned only in rebates or in other positions as described in contract specific Appendix 17/3.
 Class F5. The resulting finish shall be smooth and of uniform texture. Any blemishes and imperfections, such as discolouration and fins, shall be made good. Provision for the embedment of metal parts in the permanent works on a regular spacing, shall be allowed.
 Other Classes. The finishes shall comply with the specific requirements described in contract specific Appendix 17/3.
 Permanently exposed concrete surfaces to all Classes of finish other than F1 shall be protected from rust marks and stains of all kinds.
 Unless otherwise described in contract specific Appendix 17/3, all formwork joints for all classes of finish other than F1 shall form a regular pattern with horizontal and vertical lines continuous throughout each structure and all construction joints shall coincide with these horizontal or vertical lines.
 (ii) (12/14) Unformed Surfaces  Classes of Finish
 Class U1 finish. The concrete shall be levelled and screeded to produce a uniform surface to the profile shown on the drawings. No further work shall be applied to the surface unless it is used as a first stage for another class of finish.
 Class U2 finish. After the concrete has hardened sufficiently, the Class U1 finish shall be floated by hand or machine sufficiently only to produce a uniform surface free from screed marks.
 Class U3 finish. When the moisture has disappeared and the concrete has hardened sufficiently to prevent laitance from being worked to the surface, a Class U1 finish shall be steel-trowelled under firm pressure to produce a dense, smooth uniform surface free from trowel marks.
 
 Amendment  December 2014

 Volume 1 Specification for Highway Works
 
 Series 1700 Structural Concrete
 
 Class U4 finish. The concrete shall be levelled and screeded to produce a uniform surface. When the concrete has sufficiently hardened and the bleed water evaporated the surface shall be trowelled to produce a hard dense surface free from screed marks and exposed aggregate. Finally the surface shall be lightly textured with a wooden float or equivalent. Alternatively the concrete shall be levelled, screeded and floated to produce a uniform surface and immediately before the waterproofing operation this surface shall receive surface preparation by water jetting or grit blasting to provide a lightly textured finish. The finished surface shall not deviate from the required profile by more than 10 mm over a 3 m gauge length or have any abrupt irregularities more than 3 mm.
 Class U5 finish. The concrete shall be levelled and screeded to produce a uniform finish. When the concrete has sufficiently hardened to prevent laitance being worked to the surface it shall be floated to produce a surface free from screed marks and exposed aggregate. Finally the surface shall be textured to suit the requirements of the particular waterproofing and surfacing system. The accuracy of the finished surface shall be such that it does not deviate from the required profile by more than 5 mm over a 3 m gauge length or have any abrupt irregularities.
 Other Classes. The finishes shall comply with the specific requirements described in contract specific Appendix 17/3.

 (12/14) Construction Joints
 1 (12/14) The position of construction joints shall be as shown on the drawings and at additional positions determined by the Contractor in accordance with the requirements of contract specific Appendix 17/4. When concrete is placed in vertical members, walls, columns and the like, the lifts of concrete shall finish level or, in sloping members, at right angles to the axis of the members, and the joint lines shall match features of the finished work, if possible, or be formed by grout checks. Kickers shall be constructed integrally with the lift of concrete below.
 Concreting shall be carried out continuously up to construction joints.
 Unless interface shear calculations in accordance with BS EN 1992-2 (Clause 6.2.5 of BS EN 1992-1-1) show that a non-prepared surface between concrete cast at different times is sufficient for structural purposes, construction joints shall be prepared in either of the following ways:
 (i) When the concrete is self-supporting but still sufficiently green, the formwork shall be removed, as necessary to expose the construction joint, subject to the requirements of sub-Clause 5 of this Clause. The concrete surface shall be sprayed with a fine spray of water or brushed with a stiff brush, just sufficiently to remove the outer mortar skin and expose the larger aggregate without disturbing it. Alternatively where this preparation proves impracticable the hardened surface skin and laitance shall be removed by grit blasting or a needle gun. Hardened surfaces shall not be hacked.
 (ii) By the use of proprietary steel open-mesh permanent formwork intended for use in construction joints.
 Retarding agents shall not be used unless permitted in contract specific Appendix 17/4.
 The joint surface shall be clean and damp but free of standing water immediately before any fresh concrete is placed against it.
 (12/14) Falsework and Formwork
 2 (i)( 12/14) Design and construction. The formwork shall be sufficiently rigid and tight to prevent loss of grout or mortar from the concrete at all stages and for the appropriate method of placing and compacting. The falsework and formwork shall be so arranged as to be readily dismantled and removed from the cast concrete without shock, disturbance or damage.

 Where necessary, the falsework and formwork shall be so arranged that the soffit form, properly supported on props only, can be retained in position for such period as may be required by maturing conditions as described in sub-Clause 1710.4(ii). If the component is to be prestressed whilst still resting on the soffit form, provision shall be made to allow for elastic deformation and any variation in weight distribution. Where it is intended to re-use formwork it shall be thoroughly cleaned and made good.
 Internal metal ties which require being withdrawn through hardened concrete shall not be used where either face is permanently exposed. Where internal ties are left in, they shall be provided with a mortar cover of at least 50 mm. The jointing faces of the pocket shall be prepared with an exposed aggregate finish and dampened immediately prior to mortar filling.
 (ii) (12/14) Cleaning and treatment of forms. The faces of the forms in contact with the concrete shall be clean and treated with a suitable release agent, where applicable as described in sub-Clause 1708.3. Immediately before concreting, all forms shall be thoroughly cleaned out. The source of any compressed air used for the clearing of foreign matter from formwork shall be free from oil and other contaminant.
 (iii) (12/14) Projecting reinforcement and fixing devices. Where holes are needed in forms to accommodate projecting reinforcement or fixing devices, care shall be taken to prevent loss of grout when concreting or damage when striking forms.
 (iv) (12/14) Permanent formwork or special formwork shall comply with contract specific Appendix 17/4.
 (12/14) Transporting, Placing and Compacting
 3 (12/14) Concrete shall be transported and placed so that contamination, segregation or loss of the constituent materials does not occur, in accordance with Clause 14 of BS 8500-2.
 Concrete, when deposited, shall have a temperature of not less than 5C. Where the concrete is made using CEM I or a CEM II/A cement the concrete temperature shall not be more than 30C. Where the concrete is made using a CEM II/B or a CEM III cement, or equivalent combination, the concrete temperature shall not be more than 35C. The temperature of fresh concrete shall be measured in accordance with BS 8500-2. Fresh concrete shall not be placed against in situ concrete that has been in position for more than 30 minutes unless a construction joint is formed as described in sub-Clause 1 of this Clause.
 Where lightweight aggregate concrete is to be pumped, the Contractor shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Overseeing Organisation that pumping will have no significant effect on the strength of the hardened concrete.
 No concrete shall be placed in flowing water. Underwater concrete shall be placed in position by tremies or by pipelines using methods to ensure the requirements of this Specification are met.
 When concreting bridge decks of substantial thickness to avoid layering of concrete, the whole thickness shall be placed in one pass. In deck slabs where void formers are used, adequate means to prevent flotation shall be employed and care taken to ensure adequate compaction of the concrete placed beneath the void formers.
 Where the minimum dimension of a concrete section to be placed at a single time is greater than 600 mm measures shall be taken to reduce the adverse affects of high temperatures in the concrete or to reduce the temperature of concrete to prevent high temperatures having an adverse effect on the finished concrete.
 Concreting operations shall not displace reinforcement, tendon ducts, tendon anchorages or formwork, or damage the faces of formwork.
 Concrete shall be thoroughly compacted by vibration during the operation of placing, and thoroughly worked around the reinforcement, tendons or duct formers, around embedded fixtures and into corners of the formwork to form a solid mass free from voids. When vibrators are used to compact the concrete, vibration shall be applied continuously during the placing of each batch of concrete until the expulsion of air has practically ceased. A sufficient number of vibrators in serviceable condition shall be on site to ensure that spare equipment is always available in the event of breakdowns. Vibration shall not be applied by way of the reinforcement. Where vibrators of the immersion type are used, contact with reinforcement and inserts shall be avoided as far as is practicable.
 The use of self-compacting concrete is not covered by this Specification.

 Series 1700 Structural Concrete
 
 Concrete shall not be subjected to disturbance between 4 hours and 24 hours after compaction except that recompaction of the upper layers of deep lifts to prevent or anneal settlement cracking may be carried out. Whenever vibration has to be applied externally, the design of formwork and disposition and operation of vibrators shall ensure efficient compaction and the avoidance of surface blemishes.
 There shall be no excess water on the top surface on completion of compaction.
 Slipforming shall be performed with appropriate equipment using methods to ensure that the requirements of this Specification are met.
 (12/14) Removal of Formwork and Falsework
 4 (i)( 12/14) General. Falsework and formwork shall be removed in a manner that does not damage the concrete, and at times to suit the requirements for its curing and to prevent restraint that may arise from elastic shortening, shrinkage or creep.
 (ii) (12/14) Timing of removal for cast in situ concrete. Where the concrete compressive strength is confirmed by tests on concrete cubes stored under conditions that simulate the field conditions, formwork supporting concrete in bending may be removed when the cylinder/cube strength is 12/15 N/mm2 or the strength needed by the design, whichever is the greater. For ordinary structural concrete made with Portland cement (CEM I) or sulfate-resisting Portland cements (CEM I-SR 0 or CEM I-SR 3) of strength class 42.5 or above, in the absence of control cubes the period before removal shall be in accordance with the minimum periods given in Table 17/2.

 Unless interface shear calculations in accordance with BS EN 1992-2 (Clause 6.2.5 of BS EN 1992-1-1) show that a non-prepared surface between concrete cast at different times is sufficient for structural purposes, the vibrated top surface of precast concrete elements which will subsequently receive in situ concrete shall be further prepared using one of the following methods and therefore considered as "Rough" in accordance to Clause 6.2.5 of BS EN 1992-1-1:
 Class 1 surface preparation. The surface finish shall be in accordance with sub-Clause 1710.1.
 Class 2 surface preparation. The hardened surface shall be jetted with air or water to remove laitance and all loose material and no further roughening shall then be carried out (rough as cast).
 The surface classification and the method of preparation shall be shown on the drawings.
 (b) Handling. Elements shall be lifted or supported at points described in contract specific Appendix 17/7 and shall be handled and placed without impact. Additional constraints on the support, restraint and dynamic loading during handling or transport are described in contract specific Appendix 17/7. The Contractor shall incorporate, in the erection specification in accordance with BS EN 13670, the requirements of the lifting scheme for the precast concrete elements.
 (c) Storage. When elements are stored, they shall be firmly supported only at the points described in contract specific Appendix 17/7. Where elements are stacked several units high, packings shall be vertically above each other to prevent additional bending stresses in the elements, and the maximum height of the stack and any provision required to maintain stability shall be as described in contract specific Appendix 17/7. The accumulation of trapped water and deleterious matter in the units shall be prevented. Care shall be taken to avoid rust staining and efflorescence. Where disfigurement would be detrimental, packing pieces shall not discolour or otherwise permanently damage the elements.
 (d) Protection. At all stages of construction, precast concrete elements and other concrete associated therewith shall be properly protected to prevent damage to permanently exposed concrete surfaces, especially arrises and decorative features.
 (e) Placing and adjustment. An erection specification shall be prepared by the Contractor in accordance with BS EN 13670 and it shall be submitted for acceptance of the Overseeing Organisation at least 4 weeks prior to the delivery of the elements. The method of assembly and erection shall comply with any particular requirements in contract specific Appendix 17/7 and form part of the erection specification.
 (f) Requirements for placing and adjustment of composite slab bridges. In a composite slab bridge where precast beams are laid side by side with minimal gaps to form a deck, the difference in soffit level between adjacent units before the in situ concrete is placed shall nowhere exceed 5 mm for units up to 5 m in length or 10 mm for longer units, and the width of the deck soffit shall be within + 25 mm of that shown on the drawings; furthermore, the width of the gap between individual beams shall not exceed twice the nominal gap shown on the drawings. The alignment of transverse holes shall permit the reinforcement or prestressing tendons to be placed without distortion.

All ducts shall be kept free from standing water at all times and be thoroughly clean before grouting.
 The following air pressure tests shall be carried out on site unless specified otherwise in contract specific Appendix 17/6.
 (12/14) Duct Assembly Verification Tests
 Each complete duct system including vents, anchorages, anchorage caps, and where appropriate couplers and their connections, shall be air-pressure tested before concreting. Testing to a pressure of 0.01 N/mm2 unless otherwise specified in contract specific Appendix 17/6, shall demonstrate that the system is undamaged and has been correctly assembled. The testing shall demonstrate that a loss of pressure no greater than 10% occurs after 5 minutes.
 The minimum manufactured wall thickness of ducting for internal tendons shall be 2 mm. The duct rigidity and type and spacing of fixings and supports shall be such as to maintain line, position and cross section shape during concreting. Local deformation of the duct at supports shall be avoided.
 For external tendons the minimum wall thickness shall be 4 mm for durability, or such thicker wall as required to withstand grouting pressures of the particular duct configuration.
 The Contractor shall provide evidence of testing to demonstrate the following requirements:
 (i) Wall thickness of ducts for tendons after tensioning of the tendons shall be not less than 1.5 mm unless specified otherwise in contract specific Appendix 17/6.
 (ii) For internal tendons the duct shall transmit full bond strength from the tendons to the surrounding concrete over a length no greater than 50-100 duct diameters or other such requirement as given in contract specific Appendix 17/6.

 Vents on each duct shall be identified by labelling and shall be protected against damage at all times.
 Vents at high points shall extend to a minimum of 500 mm above the highest point on the duct profile unless described otherwise in contract specific Appendix 17/6.
 (12/14) Grouting Equipment
 5 (12/14) Grouting equipment shall comply with the requirements of Section 7 of BS EN 446.
 The equipment shall be capable of maintaining pressure on completely grouted ducts and shall be fitted with a valve that can be locked off without loss of pressure in the duct.
 During the grouting operation the Contractor shall provide adequate flushing-out plant to facilitate complete removal of the grout in the event of a breakdown of the grouting equipment or other disruption before the grouting operation has been completed. Stand-by and emergency equipment shall be provided.
 All equipment shall be kept free from build-up of adhering materials.
 (12/14) Grouting Procedures
 6 (12/14) Grouting procedures shall comply with the requirements of Section 8 of BS EN 446.
 Grouting of the ducts shall be carried out within 14 days of installation of the tendon or as soon as is practicable thereafter, in which case additional measures shall be taken to avoid corrosion of the prestressing steel. The Overseeing Organisation's written agreement to commence grouting operations shall be obtained.
 During grouting operations, once the fluidity of the grout flowing from the vents is the same as the grout being injected (to within the limits specified in BS EN 447, as per 8.4 of BS EN 446), 5 litres of grout at each vent, or such other requirement of contract specific Appendix 17/6, shall be vented into a clean receptacle and then discarded. The volume of all grout that is expelled shall be measured. The opening shall be firmly closed. All vents shall be closed in a similar manner one after another in the direction of the flow except that at intermediate crests the vents immediately downstream shall be closed before their associated crest vent. The injection tubes shall then be sealed off under pressure with a pressure of 0.5 N/mm2 being maintained for at least one minute. Grout vents at high points shall be reopened immediately after 1 minute, while the grout is still fluid. Any escape of air, water or grout shall be recorded and reported immediately to the Overseeing Organisation. A further pumping of grout shall then be carried out to expel bleed water  and/or entrapped air. This shall be carried out with the vents open one at a time sequentially in the direction of grouting with a further 5 litres being released at each vent. In the event of disagreement over the quality of the vented grout, testing shall be undertaken immediately by the Contractor. Finally, when all outlets are closed the grout pressure shall be maintained for at least one minute to confirm there is no unintended loss due to leakage.
 The filled ducts shall not be subjected to shock or vibration for at least 24 hours from the time of grouting.
 When the grout has set, the grout vents shall be temporarily reopened. If voids are apparent on inspecting vents at end caps, the Overseeing Organisation may require all or some of the end caps to be removed to demonstrate that they are satisfactorily filled with grout. End caps which have been removed shall then be replaced and permanently sealed against ingress of contaminants, such sealing to be proved to the Overseeing Organisation.
 If the method of demonstrating filling of the anchorage caps involves their removal, a photographic record shall be made by the Contractor. The record shall clearly identify the individual anchorages, and shall be included in the report to the Overseeing Organisation.
 If, in the opinion of the Overseeing Organisation, there is doubt that the ducts or any part of the system are not satisfactorily filled with grout, the Overseeing Organisation may require investigations to be carried out.
 The Contractor shall keep full records of grouting for each duct in accordance with the acceptance scheme requirements for the installation of post-tensioning systems. Copies of these records shall be supplied to the Overseeing Organisation within 24 hours of completing grouting to each duct.
 On completion of grouting, grout vents shall be positively sealed and waterproofed by a means additional to but separate from the concrete waterproofing.

 (ii) Where two or more wires or strands are stressed simultaneously, they shall be approximately of equal length between anchorage points at the datum of load and extension measurement. The degree of variation shall be small compared with the expected extension.
 (iii) The tensioning apparatus shall be such that a controlled total force is imposed gradually and no dangerous secondary stresses are induced in the tendons, anchorage or concrete.
 (iv) The force in the tendons during tensioning shall be measured by direct-reading load cells or obtained indirectly from gauges fitted in the hydraulic system to determine the pressure in the jacks. Facilities shall be provided for the measurement of the extension of the tendon and of any movement of the tendon in the gripping devices. The load measuring device shall be calibrated to an accuracy within  2% and checked at frequent intervals. The valid calibration records shall be available on site before tensioning starts. Elongation of the tendon shall be measured to an accuracy within 2% or 2 mm, whichever is the greater.
 (v) The tensioning equipment shall be calibrated before the tensioning operation and subsequently at frequent intervals.
 (12/14) Pretensioning
 3 (12/14)Where pretensioning methods are used, the tension shall be fully maintained by some positive means during the period between tensioning and transfer. The transfer of stress shall take place slowly to minimize shock.
 (i) Straight tendons. In the long-line method of pretensioning, sufficient locator plates shall be distributed throughout the length of the bed to ensure that the wires or strands are maintained in their proper position during concreting. Where a number of units are made in line, they shall be free to slide in the direction of their length and thus permit transfer of the prestressing force to the concrete along the whole line. In the individual mould system, the moulds shall be sufficiently rigid to provide the reaction to the prestressing force without distortion.

 Series 1700 Structural Concrete
 
 (ii) Deflected tendons. Where possible, the mechanisms for holding down or holding up tendons shall ensure that the part in contact with the tendon is free to move in the line of the tendon so that frictional losses are nullified. If, however, a system is used that develops a frictional force, this force shall be determined by test and due allowance made. For single tendons the deflector in contact with the tendon shall have a radius of not less than 5 times the tendon diameter for wire or 10 times the tendon diameter for strand, and the total angle of deflection shall not exceed 15. The transfer of the prestressing force to the concrete shall be effected in conjunction with the release of hold-down and hold-up forces.
 Unless otherwise described in contract specific Appendix 17/4, concrete shall not be stressed until it has reached at least the age at which 2 test results from specimens taken from it (each obtained from the average of two test cubes made from one concrete sample) attain the specified characteristic compressive strength at the time when the concrete is subjected to the prestressing force. Testing shall be as described in Annex B.5 of BS 8500-1 and Annex B of BS EN 206-1. The samples shall be taken as described in BS EN 12350-1 and the test cubes shall be made and tested as described in BS EN 12390-2 and BS EN 12390-3 respectively. They shall be cured in similar conditions to the concrete to which they relate. The Contractor shall cast and test sufficient cubes to demonstrate that the required strength of the concrete at transfer has been reached.
 (12/14) Post-tensioning
 4 (12/14) In addition to the present Clause, the installation of post-tensioning systems shall comply with the requirements of Clause 1711.
 (i) Arrangement of tendons. Where wires, strands or bars in a tendon are not stressed simultaneously, the use of spacers shall be in accordance with the recommendations of the system manufacturer.
 (ii) Anchorages. Prestressing anchorages for post-tensioning systems shall be in accordance with Clause 7.2 of BS EN 13670 and shall be supplied by organisation certificated with the CARES product acceptance scheme for the Production and Supply of Prestressing Anchorages for Post-tensioning Systems (PT3), or an equivalent scheme. Anchorages shall comply with the minimum performance requirements of BS EN 13391. For each anchorage system used in the works, the characteristic value for anchorage efficiency shall be not less than 95%. Proprietary anchorages shall be handled and used strictly in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations.
 (iii) Deflected tendons. The deflector in contact with the tendon shall have a radius of not less than 50 times the diameter of the tendon, and the total angle of deflection shall not exceed 15.
 (iv) Tensioning procedure. Before tensioning, the Contractor shall demonstrate that all tendons are free to move in the ducts unless the geometry of the ducts makes this impracticable. Tensioning shall be carried out in such a manner that the stress in the tendons increases at a gradual and steady rate. Tensioning shall not be carried out at a temperature below 0C.
 Unless otherwise described in contract specific Appendix 17/4, concrete shall not be stressed until it has reached at least the age at which 2 test results from specimens taken from it (each obtained from the average of two test cubes made from one concrete sample) attain the specified characteristic compressive strength at the time when the concrete is subjected to the prestressing force. Testing shall be as described in Annex B.5 of BS 8500-1 and Annex B of BS EN 206-1. The samples shall be taken as described in BS EN 12350-1 and the test cubes shall be made and tested as described in BS EN 12390-2 and BS EN 12390-3 respectively. They shall be cured in similar conditions to the concrete to which they relate. The Contractor shall cast and test sufficient cubes to demonstrate that the required strength of the concrete at transfer has been reached.
 The Contractor shall ensure that those carrying out the stressing are provided with particulars of the required tendon loads, order of stressing and extensions. Allowance shall be made during stressing for the friction in the jack and in the anchorage, although the former is not necessary when using load cells, and for draw-in of the tendon during anchoring.
 Stressing shall continue until the required extension and tendon load are reached. The extension shall allow for any draw-in of the tendon occurring at a non-jacking end, but measurement shall not commence until any slack in the tendon has been taken up.

 Immediately after anchoring, the forces in the prestressing tendons shall not exceed 70% of their characteristic strength. During stressing the value may exceed 70% of their characteristic strength but shall not exceed 80%. After the tendons have been anchored, the force exerted by the tensioning apparatus shall be decreased gradually and steadily so as to avoid shock to the tendon or the anchorage. Full records shall be kept of all tensioning operations, including the measured extensions, pressure-gauge or load-cell readings, and the amount of draw-in at each anchorage. When requested by the Overseeing Organisation, copies of these records shall be provided within 24 hours of each tensioning operation. Tendons shall not be cut within 3 days of their being grouted; however, in the case of deviation from the planned performance during tensioning, cutting of the tendons, grouting and work which can impair the re-tensioning shall not take place until the causes have been investigated and revised tensioning report has been approved.
 1725 (12/14) Prestressing Tendons  Protection and Bond
 1 (12/14) The prestressing tendons shall be protected in their permanent positions from both mechanical damage and corrosion as described in contract specific Appendix 17/4. Grout and grouting operations for filling ducts and anchorages of post-tensioned bonded tendons (internal or external) shall be in accordance with Clause 1711. Grease and wax for the protection of sheaths and anchorages of unbonded tendons shall be in accordance with Clauses 7.2 and 7.6 of BS EN 13670. Vents, grout inlets and outlets and anchorages shall be sealed to assure corrosion protection equivalent to that provided along the tendon. Anchorage zones shall be protected from drainage water. Unbonded tendons shall be sealed throughout their length against penetration of moisture.
 1726 (12/14) Stainless Steel Dowels  Materials
 1 (12/14) Dowels shall be made from Steel Designation 1.4429 or 1.4436 and Grade 200 or 500 steel bars complying with BS 6744.
 1727 (12/14) Inspection and Testing of Structures and Components
 (12/14) General
 1 (12/14) Inspection and testing of structures and components shall be in accordance with BS EN 13670 for the designated Execution Class (see Clause 1701) and carried out as described in contract specific Appendix 17/4 and as scheduled in contract specific Appendices 1/5 and/or 1/6. The documentation of inspection shall be in accordance with BS EN 13670 and this Specification.
 1728 (12/14) Geometrical Tolerances
 (12/14) General
 1 (12/14) The tolerances given in Clauses 10.4 to 10.6 of BS EN 13670 and in its Annex have been derived specifically for buildings and shall not be applied to highway works. Instead, the requirements of this Clause apply. The tolerances given in this Clause are not cumulative. Further project specific tolerances shall be as described in contract specific Appendix 17/4 and on the drawings.
 (12/14) Reference System
 2 (12/14) The location of the reference grids or primary lines and levels for the overall positioning of the works shall be agreed between the Overseeing Organisation and the Contractor before the works are set out.

 STRUCTURAL STEELWORK
 1800 (08/14) General
 1800.1 (08/14) Introduction and Basis of Execution
 1 (08/14) This Series is part of the Specification for Highway Works. Whilst this Series is particularly relevant to the subject matter in its title it must be read in conjunction with the general requirements in Series 000 and 100 and with all other Series relevant to the specification for the particular Works to be undertaken.
 2 (08/14) The Contractor shall supply and install all structural steelwork in accordance with this Series. Any requirement to be fulfilled by the constructor in this Series and Appendix 18/1 is a requirement on the Contractor.
 3 (08/14) The terms `execution' and `constructor' have been used throughout this Series to be compatible with the terms used in BS EN 1090-2:2008+A1:2011.
 4 (08/14) The basis for the execution of structural steelwork in this Series shall be BS EN 1090-2:2008+A1:2011, with options and requirements described in this Series (see 1800.3).
 1800.2 (08/14) Clause Numbering
 1 (08/14) The clause and sub-clause numbering and headings in Clauses 1801 to 1812 in this Series adopt those in BS EN 1090-2:2008+A1:2011, Clauses 1 to 12 respectively except that the clause numbers are pre-fixed by `180' for Clauses 1 to 9 and `18' for Clauses 10, 11 and 12.
 2 (08/14) The numbering of paragraphs in this Series bears no specific relationship to the order of paragraphs presented in BS EN 1090-2:2008+A1:2011.
 3 (08/14) Cross reference to a specific paragraph within this Series is by sub-clause number followed by the paragraph number in brackets where appropriate.
 1800.3 (08/14) Options and Requirements
 1 (08/14) Where the requirements specified in BS EN 1090-2:2008+A1:2011 are to apply to this Series without amendment, the heading of the related sub-clause in this Series is followed by the abbreviation (AEN) (i.e. as in BS EN 1090-2:2008+A1:2011).
 2 (08/14) Where there is a choice between two or more different requirements in a sub clause in BS EN 10902:2008+A1:2011 the selected requirement(s) shall be as described in this Series. All other requirements in that sub-clause in BS EN 1090-2:2008+A1:2011 shall apply to this Series unless otherwise described in this Series.

 1 (08/14) Where tack welds are used in the root of a preparation, a weld procedure specification (WPS) shall be produced for this specific condition. The tolerances on size and length of the tack weld and any subsequent profiling requirements shall be specified in the WPS. The WPS shall state whether the tack weld is intended to be fully re-melted by the root run or not.
 2 (08/14) If the tack weld is to be removed prior to welding of the joint, the minimum permitted size of tack weld shall be subject to a welding procedure test in accordance with BS EN ISO 15614-1.
 3 (08/14) If the tack weld is to be left in the joint, the maximum cross section of tack weld shall be used and the root and subsequent passes shall be deposited until such time as the root pass is fully covered. The full length of the tack weld location shall be subjected to a welding procedure test in accordance with BS EN ISO 15614-1 (see Table 18/11, footnote A).
 4 (08/14) The tack weld shall be assumed to be a fillet weld for the purposes of qualification.

 1 (08/14) Methods of qualification shall be in accordance with those permitted for EXC3/4 in BS EN 10902:2008+A1:2011, Table 12.
 2 (08/14) The weld procedure qualification acceptance levels in BS EN ISO 15614-1 are less stringent in some respects than those required for FPC for EXC3/4 (see BS EN 1090-2:2008+A1:2011, 7.6). Also, for the highest quantified service categories, the acceptance limits for certain imperfection types are more stringent than for EXC4 (see 1812.4.2.3 and 1812.4.2.4). If either of these criteria are being used for FPC the relevant weld procedure qualification acceptance levels shall be amended. Existing procedures qualified to BS EN ISO 15614-1 shall be re-qualified accordingly by reference to the original test results, if possible. If this cannot be done, or the original results do not conform to the more stringent requirements, the relevant qualification tests for evaluation of imperfections shall be repeated.
 3 (08/14) Joints with restricted access for welding (eg slot and plug welds, shallow angle branch connections), shall be subject to procedure testing in accordance with BS EN ISO 15613.

 3 (08/14) Where other conditions than those assumed in Table 18/4 apply, the minimum proportion of welded joints to be subjected to specific supplementary NDT shall be increased (or decreased) by one or more levels in accordance with Table 18/5. This shall be done by applying the next highest (or lowest) proportion using the following sequence of seven increasing levels of proportion: 0%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 100%.
 NOTE: For example, if the proportion in Table 18/4 is 20%, an increase of one level changes the requirement to 50% and a decrease of one level to 10%.
 4 (08/14) If adjustments are made according to more than one condition in Table 18/5, the net number of levels shall be used, after adding and/or subtracting the number of levels given in each note.
 NOTE: For example, if the proportion in Table 18/4 is 100% and the adjustments according to Table 18/5 are -1, -1 and +1 level respectively, the net adjustment would be -1 level, which would result in a proportion of 50%.
 5 (08/14) For quantified service category F71 and above for shop welds in steel grades up to and including S355, the minimum proportions of welded joints which shall be subjected to supplementary NDT are specified in Table 18/6. For other conditions, the proportion tested in Table 18/6 shall be adjusted in accordance with Table 18/5 as described in 1812.4.2.2 (3) and (4) for Table 18/4.

 9 Coats of paint shall be free from embedded metallic or other foreign particles including metallic dust. Deposits of adherent matter on metallic coatings or painted surfaces shall be cleaned off immediately they occur. Coatings damaged in the process shall be restored.
 10 (05/05) Unless otherwise described in Appendix 19/5, the final workshop coats on external surfaces shall be wet cleaned on site.
 
 1903 Surface Preparation  Materials and Methods
 
 (05/05) Dry Blast Cleaning in the Workshop
 
 1 (08/14) Unless otherwise described in Appendix 19/5, metallic blast cleaning abrasives complying with BS EN ISO 11124 or non-metallic blast cleaning abrasives complying with BS EN ISO 11126 shall be used.
 Grades for metallic abrasives shall comply with the following:
 
 Profile (see sub-Clause 1904.1) Fine Medium Coarse
 
 Grade
 G050 or S060 G070 or S100 G100 or S120
 
 2 The particle size of metallic abrasive in plant or equipment shall not exceed the maximum for the relevant grade as specified above.
 
 3 (05/01) Before the start of blast cleaning and during blast cleaning the Contractor shall ensure that the abrasive is free from matter which could leave detrimental contamination, as defined in sub-Clause 1904.7, on the surfaces to be coated.
 
 (05/08) Abrading in the Workshop or on Site
 
 4 Any encrusted foreign matter or paint which may be difficult to remove by abrading alone shall be dislodged by scraping, aided by hand or power wire-brushing. This work shall be completed before abrading the areas so affected.
 5 (08/14) Abrading shall be carried out using abrasive paper or other material or a flexible abrasive disc mounted on a power driven flexible pad, or a power driven arbor or spindle-mounted flexible abrasive flap wheel. Abrading tools may be used to remove weld spatter. Wet abrading may be employed for the preparation of finishes over sound undercoats, over unsound systems over hot dip galvanizing, or hot dip galvanizing. Wet abrading shall not be allowed to come into contact with exposed thermally sprayed aluminium metal coatings.
 6 (05/05) All equipment including tools, abrasive sheets, abrasive discs and abrasive wheels shall be of a type, capacity and in a condition appropriate for the work. The use of hard grinding wheels for abrading shall not be permitted.
 7 (05/03) A polished appearance caused by polishing in of paint, rust or dirt shall not be acceptable.
 8 (05/03) Areas of previously corroded steel or unsound metal coatings, except hot dip galvanizing, which have been prepared by abrading down to bright steel or bright metal coating, and blast cleaned where appropriate, shall be protected by the primer and next coat of paint before any cleaning down or preparation of adjacent surfaces.
 
 (05/05) Wet Cleaning in the Workshop or on Site
 
 9 (05/03) Wet cleaning shall be carried out by scrubbing with a stiff-bristled brush using water and a cleaning agent or a pressure washer. Immediately after cleaning, the surfaces shall be thoroughly rinsed.
 
 (05/05) Dry Cleaning in the Workshop or on Site
 
 10 Surfaces shall be cleaned by scrubbing with a dry stiff-bristled brush.

 Series 1900 Protection of Steelwork Against Corrosion
 
 (05/03) Dry Blast Cleaning on Site Using Dry Air/Abrasive System
 11 (08/14) Metallic abrasives shall comply with sub-Clauses 1, 2 and 3 of this Clause. Metallic grit or aluminium oxide abrasive shall be used for dry blast cleaning of relatively small areas on site which are to receive a thermally sprayed aluminium metal coating, such as at site welds, at areas prepared to clean steel or areas where a thermally sprayed aluminium metal coating is to be restored, as indicated in sub-Clause 1905.3(i). The Contractor shall ensure that the grade and particle shape of non-metallic abrasives are adequate for the purpose intended. Nonmetallic abrasives shall not be recycled.
 (05/03) Wet Blast Cleaning Using Low Pressure Air/Water/Abrasive System on Site
 12 (05/05) Unless otherwise specified in Appendix 19/5 a low-pressure air/water/abrasive system shall be used. The air/water pressure at the nozzle shall not exceed 7.0 kgf/cm and shall be fully adjustable below this level. The system shall incorporate a mechanical metering device remote controlled by the operator from the nozzle to enable him to regulate from zero to maximum the quantity of non-metallic abrasive being fed into the air/water mixture. During abrasive cleaning, the air, water and abrasive shall be thoroughly mixed and this mixture shall be projected on to the surface to be cleaned through a single bore nozzle or tube. The use of an inhibitor during wet blast cleaning or washing shall not be permitted.
 (05/03) Wet Blast Cleaning using High Pressure Water/Abrasive System or Ultra High Pressure Water System on Site
 13 (05/03) Unless otherwise specified in Appendix 19/5, the water pressure shall not exceed 562 kgf/cm2 for high pressure or between 1750 and 2860 kgf/cm2 for ultra high pressure. The system shall incorporate a mechanical metering device controlled by the operator at the nozzle, to regulate from zero to maximum the quantity of nonmetallic abrasive being fed into the water.
 14 (08/14) Within 60 minutes of wet blast cleaning, the whole of the cleaned surface shall be thoroughly washed using the blast cleaning equipment with air and water. Any further deposits of abrasive on already rinsed surfaces shall be removed in a similar manner also within 60 minutes of being deposited. All accumulated deposits of abrasive and debris on other parts of the structure shall be removed by the same method before the end of the working day. After washing, the surfaces shall be free from all detrimental contamination. Tests for freedom from detrimental contamination shall be made after the washing.
 Combined Wet/Dry Blast Cleaning on Site
 15 (05/05) Wet blast cleaning using the low pressure air/water/abrasive system (in compliance with sub-Clauses 12 and 14 of this Clause) shall be followed, after a minimal interval, by dry blast cleaning in compliance with sub-Clause 11 of this Clause, of all the previously wet blast cleaned areas.
 16 (05/03) The specified standard of surface preparation shall have been achieved in full, initially by wet blast cleaning and washing, before any later dry blast cleaning of the same areas to remove flash rusting or to restore the required standard of surface preparation.
 Other Requirements
 17 (05/03) When surface preparation is to be carried out by dry blast cleaning and, on adjacent surfaces, by wet cleaning and or abrading, then unless otherwise necessary, the wet cleaning and any abrading shall be carried out first.
 When combined wet/dry blast cleaning has been specified instead of dry blast cleaning only, the above sequence may be reversed. On completion of the wet blast cleaning part of the process, the areas to be abraded shall be cleaned in compliance with sub-Clause 9 of this Clause except that for rinsing, the wet blast cleaning equipment may be used. The dry blast cleaning part of the process, and dry abrading shall be carried out after any wet abrading required and final rinsing. Any prepared dry metal surface shall be protected from the effects of any further wet method of surface preparation by the application of a minimum 75 microns dry film thickness of paint.

 28 Where required in Appendix 30/6, hedge-trenches excavated in accordance with Table 30/1 shall be backfilled with topsoil or with a pre-mixed 80% topsoil / 20% compost mixture or other mixture, as stated in Appendix 30/6.
 29 Where required in Appendix 30/6, the ground shall be cultivated to a minimum depth of 300 mm removing all live injurious weed roots and growth to a tip off Site. Any stones or other rubbish over 75 mm in any direction shall be removed from the surface and disposed of in accordance with sub-Clause 3004.8. Root disturbance of adjacent plants shall be avoided and the surface left with a medium tilth. Any ameliorants specified in Appendix 30/6 shall be incorporated in a second pass following initial cultivation.
 30 If required in Appendix 30/6, a 600 mm wide strip along hedgelines shall be cultivated in accordance with sub-Clause 3006.29.
 31 In planting beds, the extent of the area to be planted shall first be defined by plants spaced around the perimeter. The remaining plants shall then be used to fill in the centre of the area in an informal manner, avoiding straight lines and regular geometric patterns.
 32 At each planting position sufficient soil shall be excavated from the bed to allow 75 mm clearance between either the rootball, or the root-ends when fully spread, and the sides and bottom of the planting hole. The plant shall be set in the centre of the plant position, showing its best side to the front.
 33 Finely broken back-fill material shall be packed around the roots. The plants shall be gently shaken to allow fine soil to surround the roots. As soil is returned it shall be lightly consolidated and firmly heeled around the root-collar. Immediately after planting the soil surface shall be evenly graded. Where required in Appendix 30/6, the soil shall then be watered at the rate stated in Appendix 30/6.
 Planting of Whips, Transplants and Shrubs into Pits or Trenches
 34 Each plant shall be placed upright in the centre of the pit or, where required in Appendix 30/6, the hedge trench, with the roots spread evenly outwards and downwards without restriction. Where necessary, any badly damaged roots shall be carefully pruned before being planted.
 35 The pit or trench shall be backfilled with a premixed 80% topsoil / 20% compost mixture or other mixture stated in Appendix 30/6 and the backfill lightly firmed.

 37 Unless otherwise stated in Appendix 30/6, adjustable tree ties, strapping or spacers shall be made of black PVC or reinforced rubber. The width of the belt shall be 25 mm.
 Planting of Trees
 38 Where required in Appendix 30/6, root barriers shall be provided at the time of planting, in order to constrain the growth of tree roots. Root barriers shall be supplied and installed in accordance with Appendix 30/6 and the manufacturer's instructions.
 39 All wrappings, insulation and padding shall be removed from rootballs immediately before backfilling. No wire or plastic mesh containers may be left in position. Any damaged or torn roots shall be cut back cleanly to sound wood prior to planting.
 40 Stakes for all standards and feathered trees shall be firmly driven and positioned into the tree planting pit before planting to a minimum depth of 300 mm below the bottom of the pit. The stake shall be positioned off centre on the prevailing windward side of the tree as near to the tree as possible but shall not interfere with the free movement of the branches and shall cause no rubbing.
 41 Unless otherwise stated in Appendix 30/6, the Contractor shall use the shortest possible stake to support the tree; when the stake has been driven into the ground there shall be not more than one third of the height of the clear stem of the tree above ground.
 42 Unless otherwise stated in Appendix 30/6, for all standards and feathered trees, one tie shall be used for each tree, fixed within 50 mm of the top of the stake and secured to the stake with a 25 mm galvanised clout nail. Ties shall be of a size appropriate to the size of the tree and stake and equipped with spacers of a size that will ensure that the tree and stake remain vertical.
 43 For extra heavy standards and heavy standards the staking shall be undertaken after the tree has been positioned. Unless otherwise stated in Appendix 30/6, three stakes, each of 3 m length shall be driven down the side of the rootball and into the pit to a depth of 500 mm below the bottom of the pit. The stakes shall be angled outwards to between 5 and 10 at the top and pulled in moderately by tensioning all the supporting bands equally. The stakes shall be equally spaced and shall not pass through the rootball.

 44 Unless otherwise stated in Appendix 30/6, for extra heavy standards and heavy standards with above ground staking the tree shall be secured centrally between the stakes with two sets of supporting bands of fire hose or equivalent webbing of minimum width 70 mm. The upper set shall be positioned as near to the tops of the stakes as possible and the lower set shall be positioned 500 mm above ground level. Each band shall take the form of a loop around the tree stem nailed to the stake and shall be equally tensioned so as to hold the tree centrally between the stakes.
 45 Where stated in Appendix 30/6, semi-mature trees shall be planted as shown on HCD Drawing Number K5. Three proprietary anchors per pit shall be provided at angles of 120 around the pit ensuring that they are securely locked in position with their cable eyes 50 mm above the layer of coarse gravel and 150 mm from the side of the rootball position. The rootball surface shall be protected with a triangular timber frame formed from three pieces of 700 mm x 100 mm x 50 mm timber securely fastened by nails at each corner. Galvanised cable shall be threaded using a ratchet tensioner. Wires shall not cut across the rootball.
 46 Unless otherwise stated in Appendix 30/6, backfill to tree pits shall comprise any excavated topsoil and imported topsoil as necessary with compost in accordance with sub-Clause 3006.14, in a 80% topsoil/20% compost mixture thoroughly mixed.
 47 For bare root trees, each tree shall be planted upright in the centre of the hole and the root system fully spread outwards and downwards in the pit, at the correct level so that the stake passes through the root system as closely to the trunk as possible, with minimal disturbance to the roots themselves. Once the tree has been correctly positioned the pit shall be backfilled with the pre-mixed soil/compost mixture.
 48 During backfilling, the tree shall be gently shaken at regular intervals to settle the mixture closely around the roots. The backfill mixture shall be firmed in layers not exceeding 150 mm to a finished level equivalent to the nursery soil mark on the tree.
 49 Where required in Appendix 30/6, each tree shall be watered in on the same day as planting, at the rate stated in Appendix 30/6. The water shall be delivered by means of a low pressure hose to avoid any washing out of the soil, into a depression made in the planting medium around the base of the stem to ensure that the water goes to the root system. The planting medium shall then be returned to its previous level.
 50 Where stated in Appendix 30/6, a 75 mm or 80 mm diameter perforated flexible plastic irrigation pipe shall be inserted around the rootball during planting, at a depth of 150 mm below the ground surface. The pipe
 
 shall be of sufficient length to coil completely around the root system or rootball and shall be provided with two `T'-piece connections with aeration caps, which shall be located opposite each other.
 51 Where trees are to be situated within mown grass areas two additional posts of a diameter similar to that of the stake shall be driven firmly into the ground to leave a finished height of approximately 400 mm above soil level. These posts shall be sited clear of the tree roots in a triangular relationship to the stake, such that the combined effect with the weed-free circle will prevent accidental damage by mowing machinery.
 Tubes, Guards and Ties
 52 In the locations stated in Appendix 30/6, individual plant protectors as described in Appendix 30/6 shall be provided. Plant protectors shall be green, brown or black and if formed of solid sheet material this shall be translucent. The top edge of plant protectors shall be formed to prevent abrasion damage to the enclosed plants. Plant protectors shall be fixed with releasable ratchet ties to softwood or hardwood stakes, 25 mm x 25 mm in cross section. The length of the stakes and the number of stakes and releasable ratchet ties to be used shall be as stated in Appendix 30/6. Where two stakes are used they shall be placed opposite each other within the plant protector.
 Mulches: Ground Preparation
 53 Before application of any mulch the planting areas and/or tree positions which are to be mulched shall be free of grass and weed growth. Where required in Appendix 30/6, the planting areas and/or tree positions shall be watered at the rate stated in Appendix 30/6.
 Organic Mulches
 54 Where it is stated in Appendix 30/6 that compost shall be applied as a surface mulch it shall comply with sub-Clause 3006.14 or other composition as specified in Appendix 30/6.
 55 (05/08) Where it is stated in Appendix 30/6 that timber mulch is to be used, it should be a product certified under the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), as an appropriate grade for the site. Two types may be used:
 (i) Chipped conifer bark, size range 25-75 mm, maximum 15% fines, composted for a minimum of six weeks prior to delivery; or
 (ii) An organic mulch comprising composted wood chips or bark, free of fungi and diseases, methyl bromide contamination or foreign material. It shall be matured for a minimum of 16 weeks, naturally heated by the process of decomposition to temperatures

 hedges and hedges where hard growth over two years old is to be cut, only reciprocating blade cutting machinery shall be used. Large leafed evergreen hedges shall be pruned with secateurs to avoid half cut leaves.
 15 Growth shall be reduced to the point of the previous cut and on completion, both sides of the hedge shall be perpendicular and the top shall be level and at right angles to the sides. Exceptions to this shall be as described in Appendix 30/10.
 16 All clippings lodged in the top or sides of the hedge shall be removed off Site. During the cutting operation all litter and debris within the structure of the hedge shall be removed off Site.
 17 All hedge laying works shall be carried out in a manner to ensure that the newly laid hedge possesses a neat, uniform appearance of even density. The work shall be carried out ensuring that the cut hedge plants are able to re-grow vigorously.
 18 All hedge laying work shall only be carried out during the dormant season, but not during periods of extreme frost.
 19 The terms for the component parts of a cut and laid hedge are as follows:
 (i) Stakes - pointed greenwood stems or hardwood cleft driven vertically into the ground to provide support to the laid hedge plants.
 (ii) Binders - flexible greenwood stems woven together along the top of the hedge to hold it down and provide support to the stakes (applicable to Midland Hedge only - see sub-Clause 3010.20).
 (iii) Cut-Side - the side of the hedge from which the hedge plants are cut (applicable to Midland Hedge only - see sub-Clause 3010.20).
 (iv) Brash Side - the side facing the adjoining field or forestry plantation through which the hedge brash protrudes (applicable to Midland Hedge only - see sub-Clause 3010.20).
 (v) Stoving - the exposed stump of a laid hedge plant.
 (vi) Coppice Stool - the cut stump of a hedge plant.
 (vii) Pleacher - a live hedge plant which has been cut and laid to form the body of the hedge.
 20 If required in Appendix 30/10 that hedges are to be laid, the work shall be carried out in one of the following styles, as described in Appendix 30/10:
 
 (i) Midland Hedge - All the pleachers shall be cut from one side of the hedge and laid diagonally across the line of the hedge so that all the brash protrudes on the opposite side. The hedge shall be supported by greenwood stakes and binders.
 (ii) Straight Hedge - All the pleachers shall be cut and laid along the line of the hedge and inter-woven between hardwood, cleft stakes spaced at 1 m intervals.
 (iii) Any other regional variation described in Appendix 30/10.
 21 All cutting tools used on the hedge laying works shall be maintained in a sharp condition to ensure that cut surfaces are smooth and made cleanly without tearing the wood grain. The cuts which facilitate the laying of a pleacher shall be made with an axe or billhook only. Chainsaws shall only be used in the preparation of the hedge and the trimming of hedge stovings.
 22 When a mixed species hedge is to be laid, the individual species shall be treated in one of the following ways, as required in Appendix 30/10:
 (i) Cutting and laying; or
 (ii) Coppicing - hedge plants shall be felled at a height not exceeding 100 mm above ground level leaving their stumps with an angled surface to shed water and in a form to promote vigorous regrowth; or
 (iii) Removal - unwanted hedge plants shall be felled to ground level and their stumps either physically grubbed out or chemically treated to prevent regrowth; or
 (iv) Retention - certain young hedge plants which are either self set seedlings or growing from a healthy coppice stump may be selected to be retained to grow on as hedgerow trees.
 23 Unless otherwise stated in Appendix 30/10, the following materials shall be used for staking and/or binding:
 (i) Midland Hedge
 (a) Stakes shall be obtained from broadleaved species such as Castanea sativa, Quercus robur, Fraxinus excelsior or Acer pseudoplatanus. Stakes from any Salix or Populus species shall not be used. The stakes shall be pointed and cut from live greenwood stems not more than twelve weeks prior to being used. They shall be at least 1.5 m in length and of 30 mm to 60 mm diameter throughout.

 (ii) Straight Hedges
 (a) Stakes shall be cleft and of a hardwood species stated in Appendix 30/10, pointed at one end, 1.8 m in length and 75 mm to 100 mm in width throughout.
 24 All side branches from any hedge plants which may impede or obstruct the laying operation or detract from the style and appearance of the completed hedge shall be removed.
 25 Any branches which are tangled or interwoven with other hedge plants shall be removed to ensure that the hedge plant to be laid is free to be guided into position. Any dead, damaged or diseased wood, along with any other foreign objects and debris, shall also be removed before the plant is laid.
 26 All plants shall be laid in the same direction unless a gap is likely to occur. All laid hedge plants shall, as far as possible, be interwoven into each other and the supporting hedge stakes to ensure maximum stability. On sloping ground, all hedge plants shall be laid in an uphill direction except when back laying is required to fill a gap. On level ground the direction of laying shall be in the direction of traffic flow on that side of the carriageway except when back laying is required to fill a gap.
 27 Stakes shall be driven centrally down the line of the hedge to offer support to the newly laid hedge plants in accordance with the following staking requirements, specific to the two different styles of hedge described in sub-Clause 3010.20, or as required in Appendix 30/10:
 (i) Midland Hedges - greenwood stakes of sufficient length to ensure that at least 150 mm protrudes above the top of the laid hedge shall be driven in to a minimum depth of 300 mm at 0.5 m intervals along an even, straight line. When the binders have been fitted along the top of the hedge, the stakes shall be cut off 75 mm above the binders with a sloping cut, which shall face the cut side of the hedge.
 (ii) Straight Hedges - Cleft stakes of sufficient length to ensure that 100 mm protrudes above the top of the laid hedge shall be
 
 driven in to a minimum depth of 300 mm at 1.0 m intervals along a straight line.
 28 Only greenwood binders shall be used along the top of the hedge. These shall be tightly twisted around themselves and each stake in order to hold the laid hedge down and offer support to the line of stakes. A minimum of four binders shall be included at any one point and additional binders introduced at each stake in order to maintain the required number.
 29 When the hedge laying works at any location are complete, any loose branch or twig ends shall be trimmed from the cut side and top of Midland Hedges and also from the brash side if necessary and from both sides and the top of Straight Hedges, to leave a neat and compact appearance.
 30 All cut material and other arisings shall be removed off Site by the end of each working day, unless otherwise required in Appendix 30/10.
 31 Where any significant gap exists in the hedge after it has been laid, it shall be planted up with new hedge plants in accordance with Clause 3006. The size of the plants, species and planting density/pattern shall be as specified in Appendix 30/10.
 Individual Established Trees in Urban Streets
 32 Individual trees shall be defined as feathered, standard and extra heavy standard trees planted as single specimens rather than as part of a planted group. Street trees in footways, tree grilles and those planted as specimens within a group shall be defined as `individual trees' as well as any other young or semimature trees identified in Appendix 30/10.
 33 The individual trees shall be inspected annually during the growing season, and maintained as follows:
 (i) All weeds around the base of the tree shall be removed, to a radius of 500 mm in grass or to a whole tree station if in the footway or a tree grille. Removal shall be by hand and/ or chemical means as appropriate. When using herbicide the requirements of Clause 3001 and sub-Clause 3002.2 shall apply.
 (ii) Tree supports, stakes, ties and anchoring systems shall be inspected and adjusted.
 (iii) When trees can stand unsupported, stakes and/or ties shall be removed Stake holes shall be backfilled with topsoil which shall be lightly firmed.
 (iv) Tree guards and grilles shall be inspected and adjusted.

 Arboriculture: General
 34 All work specified in this Clause shall be undertaken in accordance with BS 3998, except that cuts and wounds shall not be treated with a fungicidal sealant, bitumen or latex paint, unless otherwise stated in Appendix 30/10.
 35 Where permission has been obtained to carry out any work under this Contract on trees covered by a Tree Preservation Order or in a Conservation Area this shall be noted in Appendix 30/10.
 36 The Contractor shall comply with the current Forestry and Arboriculture Safety & Training Council (FASTCO) recommendations in relation to all aspects of the arboricultural works.
 37 If any defect is found within a tree during the course of carrying out work which would render the specified work inappropriate or inadequate, the Contractor shall cease work and notify the Overseeing Organisation who shall agree any appropriate alternative action which is to be taken. Where such a defect constitutes an imminent threat to public safety or property, the Contractor shall take appropriate action to exclude the public from the area of danger, notify the Overseeing Organisation immediately, and protect the location until the Overseeing Organisation issues further instructions.
 38 No tree work shall be carried out during periods of extreme weather except in emergency situations. Except in an emergency incident, the removal of live wood from any species shall not be undertaken during periods of severe frosts. In such cases, the work carried out shall be the minimum required to render the tree safe or to allow removal from the carriageway.
 39 Except in an emergency incident, tree surgery, felling, thinning and coppicing operations shall only be undertaken within the dormant season and outside the bird nesting season.
 
 40 All mature trees shall be checked for bat roosts in any cavities, before arboricultural works are carried out. Any bat roosts shall be reported to the Overseeing Organisation and no works shall be carried out on any tree in which bat roosts are located without further written instructions from the Overseeing Organisation. The inspection for bat roosts and any subsequent action thereon must be carried out by appropriately licensed personnel.
 41 All tools shall be surface sterilised with methylated spirits after use on trees which are known or suspected to be diseased.
 42 When using tower wagons or cranes the Contractor shall ensure that manufacturer's safety limits are not exceeded. Demountable towers shall have all fastening brackets secured and shall only be used on the appropriate vehicle.
 43 Climbing irons shall not be used in the pruning of live trees and shall only be used during felling or dismantling operations when this is necessary during emergency works.
 44 No trees are to be used as winch anchors without the prior consent of the Overseeing Organisation and these shall be protected. Alternative types of winch anchor may be used provided they are appropriate for the conditions prevailing at the Site and the task to be undertaken and are of a recognised arboricultural type.
 Tree Surgery
 45 Tree size categories reflecting the extent to which tree surgery and felling works shall be carried out are stated in Appendix 30/10.
 46 Each tree shall be individually considered and the general description of work to be undertaken shall be interpreted in relation to the species, shape, size, character and condition of each individual tree.
 47 All operations shall be carried out so as to leave a well-balanced tree crown.
 48 The Contractor shall prune back all dead, damaged or diseased wood to its point of origin. The cutting of the branch shall not damage the branch collar if taken off at a main limb or on the bole. The triple cut method shall be used when carrying out the pruning operation and the final wound shall be smooth and free of snags.
 49 All damage to main limbs or boles shall be cleaned to remove damaged or diseased tissue back to, but not into, live wood or bark. The final wound shall be smooth and free of snags.
 50 The repair of major bark wounds (over 75 mm in diameter or length) shall consist of the removal of dead, damaged and loose bark and in addition any splintered

 Series 3000 Landscape and Ecology
 
 wood back to the line of newly forming callus growth ensuring that no live tissue is damaged. The size of the wound shall be kept to a minimum and its final shape shall be, as far as possible, rounded and free from sharp corners.
 51 Both wet and dry cavities shall be inspected and probed to determine the extent of decay and ascertain their significance in relation to the structure and safety of the tree or branch. Where possible, all accumulated debris and loose decayed wood shall be removed from such cavities and where specified in Appendix 30/10, the opening of the cavity covered with a fine mesh wire netting to prevent a further build up of debris. This covering shall be secured with felt tacks in such a way that it does not prevent natural callus formation but allows easy removal for future inspection.
 52 Regulative pruning shall be carried out in accordance with the Arboriculture Research Note 48/83/PATH and Arboriculture Research Note 116/93 as issued by the Arboricultural Advisory and Information Service. Pruning cuts shall wherever possible be made at a fork or at the main stem. All wounds shall be kept as small as possible. The final pruning cut shall be made so that both the branch, branch bark ridge and branch collar remain intact.
 53 The Contractor shall carry out as part of tree pruning operations any of the following works as may be necessary on an individual tree:
 (i) Removal of basal sucker growths and epicormic growth from the trunk at ground level up to the base of the tree's natural crown.
 (ii) Repair of minor bark wounds on the trunk and main branches by the removal of any dead, damaged or loose bark back to undamaged tissue or to the line of newly forming callus growth. In either case the size of wound shall be kept to a minimum.
 (iii) Removal of any foreign objects from the tree where this can be done without inflicting any undue damage to the tree concerned.
 (iv) Removal of reverted branches from cultivars of tree species.
 (v) Severance of undesirable climbing plants at base of trunk.
 54 Where crown lifting is directed in Appendix 30/10 the lower branches and branchlets of the tree shall be removed to the height stated in Appendix 30/10 in order to increase the clearance under the canopy of the tree.
 55 Where crown thinning is required in Appendix 30/10 a proportion of secondary and small live branch growth
 
 throughout the crown shall be removed to produce as far as possible an even density of foliage around a well spread and balanced branch structure. Crossing, weak, duplicated and damaged branches shall be removed where this will not spoil the overall shape.
 56 Where crown reduction or reshaping is required in Appendix 30/10 the crown shall be reduced in size, whilst preserving as far as possible a natural shape. This may involve cutting back both main and subsidiary branches to a side bud or branch, to leave a flowing line without stumps.
 Tree Felling
 57 Where straight felling is required in Appendix 30/10 the whole tree shall be felled to within 100 mm of ground level, where necessary with the assistance of a powered or hand winch.
 58 Where sectional felling is required in Appendix 30/10 the tree shall be felled in sections of a size appropriate to the location, using ropes where necessary to lower the sections.
 59 The height at which the stump shall be cut shall be as stated in Appendix 30/10, either:
 (i) as close to the ground level as possible; or
 (ii) where the tree is growing in a hedge or fence line the stump shall be left level with the top of the hedge or fence; or
 (iii) at any other height stated in Appendix 30/10.
 The final cut shall leave the stump with a smooth, level surface.
 60 Where required in Appendix 30/10, stump treatment shall be carried out within 24 hours of felling. A stump-killing herbicide with colouring agent, used in accordance with Clause 3001 shall be applied by means of drilling or frill girdling in the cambium zone of the cut stump.
 61 Any re-growth from the cut stump shall be treated during the following season in accordance with subClause 3010.60 and Clause 3001.
 62 Where required in Appendix 30/10, the complete root, including buttress and surface roots arising from or near to its base, shall be removed, either by:
 (i) stump grinding to a minimum depth of 300 mm; or
 (ii) stump grubbing by means of excavation or winching.
 63 Following removal of stumps by any means, the void shall be filled with topsoil to match existing levels in grassed areas. In paved areas the material shall be removed down to formation level to allow full

 reinstatement of the paved area. All arisings shall be disposed of as required in Appendix 30/10.
 Thinning and Coppicing
 64 Thinning operations shall be undertaken by means that avoid the need for pruning or crown lifting of retained plants, particularly to those on the outer edges.
 65 Thinning shall be carried out throughout the planted areas identified in Appendix 30/10. Unless otherwise stated in Appendix 30/10, thinning shall favour the retention of the strongest trees and those that offer the longest future useful life. Adequate spacing shall be created between the trees and shrubs to promote healthy future development of the crowns of the remaining trees. Edge treatment shall favour the maximum retention of lower branches and an understorey of younger trees or shrubs where these are present. All plants to be thinned shall be cut down to between 25 - 30 mm of ground level parallel with the slope of the ground.
 66 Plants to be coppiced shall be cut down to 50 mm above ground level if being coppiced for the first time. If coppiced previously, the plants shall be cut back to the previous point of coppicing but with the cuts positioned outside the branch collar. The final wound surface shall be smooth and angled to allow water runoff. Cut surfaces shall not be treated with herbicide.
 Scrub Control in Grass
 67 No scrub control shall be carried out during the bird nesting season.
 68 Where required in Appendix 30/10, control of scrub species shall be carried out. Species to be controlled shall be as specified in Appendix 30/10.
 69 The tree and shrub species to be controlled shall have a stem diameter and maximum height or sizes as stated in Appendix 30/10.
 70 Where required in Appendix 30/10, scrub control is required on rock ledges and scree.
 71 The following operations shall be carried out on specified species, as required in Appendix 30/10:
 (i) Where there are large areas of scrub to be controlled, a translocated herbicide shall be applied to the specified species during a period of active growth, in accordance with Clause 3001. After the herbicide application has been effective all dead vegetation shall be cut down to ground level and removed off Site.
 (ii) Specified species shall be cut down to between 50 and 100 mm above ground level.
 
 For stumps of sufficient diameter, the Contractor shall furrow or frill girth 50% of the stump and bark and apply a stump-killing herbicide, in accordance with Clause 3001. An approved vegetable dye shall be included to clearly indicate the stumps have been treated.
 (iii) Specified species shall be cut down to 50 mm above ground level, and the plants allowed to re-grow. The Contractor shall then apply a translocated herbicide during a period of active growth, in accordance with Clause 3001. This re-growth treatment is likely to be in the year following initial cutting.
 (iv) Specified species shall be cut down to 50 mm above ground level, and removed off Site. The plants will be allowed to re-grow.
 3011 Management of Waterbodies
 1 The following operations shall be undertaken where required in Appendix 30/11.

 16 Unless otherwise specified in Appendix 50/5, the water pressure shall not exceed 562 kgf/cm2 for high pressure or between 1750 and 2860 kgf/cm2 for ultra high pressure. The system shall incorporate a mechanical metering device controlled by the operator at the nozzle, to regulate from zero to maximum the quantity of non-metallic abrasive being fed into the water.
 17 (05/05) Within 60 minutes of wet blast cleaning, the whole of the cleaned surface shall be thoroughly washed using the blast cleaning equipment with air and water. Any further deposits of abrasive on already rinsed surfaces shall be removed in a similar manner also within 60 minutes of being deposited. All accumulated deposits of abrasive and debris on other parts of the structure shall be removed by the same method before the end of the working day. After washing, the surfaces shall be free from all contamination. Tests for freedom from detrimental contamination shall be made after the washing.
 Combined Wet/Dry Blast Cleaning
 18 (05/05) Wet blast cleaning using the low pressure air/water/abrasive system in accordance with sub-Clause 5003.15 and 17 shall be followed, at a minimal interval, by dry blast cleaning in accordance with sub-Clauses 5003.11 to 14 of all the previously wet blast cleaned areas.
 19 The specified standard of surface preparation shall have been achieved in full, initially by wet blast cleaning and washing to achieve the required cleanliness, before any later dry blast cleaning of the same areas to remove flash rusting or to restore the required surface profile.
 
 Other Requirements
 20 When surface preparation is to be carried out by dry blast cleaning and, on adjacent surfaces by wet cleaning down and/or abrading, then unless otherwise dictated by traffic management requirements etc., the wet cleaning down and any wet abrading shall be carried out first.
 21 When surface preparation is to be carried out by wet blast cleaning, any wet cleaning down and/or wet abrading of adjacent surfaces may be carried out after the wet blast cleaning. In such cases areas to be blast cleaned and/or abraded shall be cleaned down in accordance with sub-Clause 5002.8, and thoroughly rinsed using the blast cleaning equipment before any final preparation by dry blast cleaning or dry abrading is carried out.
 22 Any prepared steel surfaces shall be protected from the effects of any further wet method of surface preparation by the application of a minimum 75 microns dry film thickness of paint.

 (ii) no skin formation;
 (iii) any sediment present shall be easily redispersible with no irreversible settling;
 (iv) usability under the given site conditions.
 4 Paint shall be applied only to surfaces which have been prepared and cleaned as described in this Series. Areas of adjacent surfaces which are not to be painted shall be masked before application of paints to the prepared and cleaned surfaces. Accidental overspray on adjacent unpainted surfaces shall be removed immediately.
 5 Unless otherwise described in Appendix 50/2, a coat of paint in a system shall be applied by one of the following methods:
 (i) brush (B);
 (ii) airless spray (AS);
 (iii) (05/05) air assisted spray (S).
 6 Paint shall not be applied under the following conditions:
 (i) when the ambient temperature falls below 5C or the relative humidity rises above 90% or, for types of paints in sub-Clause 5012.14, outside the temperatures and humidities recommended by the paint manufacturer;
 
 (ii) during rain, snow, fog, mist or in a dustladen atmosphere;
 (iii) when the amount of moisture likely to be deposited on the surface by condensation or rain before or after painting, may have a harmful effect on the paint;
 (iv) when wind-borne dust may have a harmful effect on the paint.
 7 Before starting the procedure trials described in Clause 5011, the Contractor shall make available details of the overall wet film thickness for each coat he proposes to apply. He shall also make available information as to the total amount of paint he expects to use for each coat of each system during any Contract for which procedure trials are required. The calculation of the amount of paint to be used shall be based on the volume solids plus an allowance for waste.
 8 The following requirements on paint film thicknesses shall apply:
 (i) wet film thickness gauges shall be used where practicable to check that the wet film thickness is not less than:
 min dry film thickness (mdft) x 100 volume solids %
 (ii) during the application of a paint system, the Contractor shall ensure that the progressive total thickness of the applied coats shall allow the specified minimum total dft of the system to be attained without exceeding, overall, the proposed wet film thickness referred to in sub-Clause 7 of this Clause by more than 20%;
 (iii) in no case shall the total dry film thickness of a paint system or the mdft of the last undercoat and finish be less than that specified in Appendix 50/1 Form HA/P2 (Maintenance) Paint System Sheet;
 (iv) the local dry film thickness for any primer shall not exceed the specified mdft by more than 30% and for other paints by more than 75%.
 9 Each coat of paint of a specified system shall have satisfactory adhesion.
 10 (05/05) Each applied specified paint coat, shall be free from defects, including cratering, pin-holing blistering, rivelling, sagging, bittiness, dry spray and cissing etc. The presence of any of these defects shall be determined by unaided visual assessment. The presence of pin-holing or porosity shall be determined by low or high-voltage detectors (at corners, bolted joints and welds pin-holing shall be exempted). The
