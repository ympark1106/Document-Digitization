 design model meet the existing undisturbed ground surface (interface
 
 strings) have been calculated from a survey of that ground. The
 
 Contractor shall establish new interface strings based on the design
 
 information contained in the Drawings and the actual ground surface at
 
 the time of construction.
 
 3.
 
 Setting out information and levels for tolerance checks at
 
 any point shall, wherever possible, be determined from the Drawings
 
 with the exception of the Cross Section Drawings. The Cross Section
 
 Drawings have been generated from the design model and are
 
 provided to the Contractor for information only and are not generally to
 
 be used for setting out the Works or for determining levels for tolerance
 
 checks.

 105.01 GENERAL
 
 1.
 
 The Contractor must make all necessary arrangements for
 
 the supply and servicing of the required quantities of suitable water for
 
 the Works both for construction purposes and for potable water for
 
 concrete manufacture, pavement construction and site facilities.
 
 2.
 
 The responsibility for investigating the feasibility and
 
 availability of suitable water for the Works from all sources and
 
 obtaining the necessary approvals will rest entirely with the Contractor.
 
 3.
 
 Existing stock water points or station water supplies must
 
 not be used unless specific approval has been obtained from the
 
 current land owner/lessee. Livestock must be allowed unhindered
 
 access to pre-existing water points in the vicinity of the Works.

 Stock Access
 
 105.02 CONSTRUCTION WATER
 Water used by the Contractor for material compaction and dust suppression must be obtained from sources other than Water Corporation water supply services, existing wetlands or the River, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of Superintendent that alternatives are not viable, and all required approvals have been obtained.
 
 Water Sources
 
 105.03 WATER BORES
 
 1.
 
 Where the Principal has established water bores in the
 
 vicinity of the Works, these will be made available for use by the
 
 Contractor as possible water sources. All risks associated with the use
 
 of such water bores will remain with the Contractor, as the
 
 performance of the bores may be affected by seasonal fluctuations and
 
 cannot be guaranteed. Details of pump tests, locations and any
 
 restrictions placed on the use of water from these bores are given in
 
 Annexure 105A.
 
 2.
 
 The selection of the appropriate pumping equipment to
 
 utilise the bores is dependent on the nominal size and class of bore
 
 casing used in the development of the bores.
 
 3.
 
 Any test results given are from the only tests carried out.
 
 The performance of the bores, quantities available from open water
 
 sources and the quality of water cannot therefore be guaranteed and
 
 may be subject to seasonal fluctuations.
 
 4.
 
 If drawdown at any water source during the Works is
 
 considered excessive, the Superintendent may then direct the
 
 Contractor to discontinue the use of the bore or limit the amount of
 
 water drawn from the bore. The Contractor must use replacement
 
 water from alternative sources at no additional cost to the Principal.

 7. SETTING OUT INFORMATION (Clause 102.01)
 7.1 The Project Manager must ensure that Road Reference Marks (RRMs) have been established during pre-construction and are available for construction. If not, then action should be taken to establish the RRMs to the required Main Roads Survey Standard 67/08/36.
 7.2 If the RRMs are to be established as a separate survey prior to construction, then it is essential that the marks are connected to the original geodetic survey network that was used to define the ground model for design. This may have only been a minor control traverse. Further information for these requirements can be obtained from the Senior Geodetic Surveyor.
 7.3 Co-ordinate values of RRM's are available from the Survey Portal within the Survey and Mappings Standards section of the Main Roads Website available at www.mainroads.wa.gov.au. It is the Project Manager's responsibility to ensure the coordinate values of the RRMs have remained unaltered since establishment to ensure that no ambiguities arise between the Contractor's surveyor and Main Roads' survey representatives.
 7.4 The Project Manager must be aware of the need for the project to be designed and supplied in its respective Main Roads WA approved Project Zone Coordinate System (GDA94). The Project Manager must ensure all spatially referenced data e.g. RRMs, design models, Drawings and amendments, are supplied in their nominated Project Zone.
 7.5 MX GENIO default output Double Precision D23.17 output is the standard MX output that will ensure the integrity of the digital model is retained. It is the Contractor's responsibility to convert this data into any other required digital output for its needs.
 7.6 The Principal shall not supply String Reports (MX Minor Option 992), Cross Section Reports (MX Minor Option 994) or Geometry Reports (MX Minor Option 980) for setting out the Works. The Principal has provided sufficient information in the form of Design Drawings and the Design Model to enable the Contractor to set out of the Works. The Contractor shall be responsible for any reporting or reformatting of the design model.
 8. CONTRACTOR'S SITE FACILITIES (Annexure 103A)
 8.1 Provide details of known available sites suitable for camp location.
 9. WATER SUPPLIES (Annexure 105A)
 9.1 Further information on pump tests, locations and any restrictions placed on the use of water from these bores can be provided in the "Information for Tenderers".
 10. SERVICE ALTERATIONS (Annexure 106A)
 10.1 For service alterations undertaken by the Principal, it is essential to detail the timing of such alterations in order for the Contractor to make due allowance in the Construction Program.
 10.2 Clause 106.06.2 directs the Contractor to contact Western Power and/or Synergy and this is applicable for all locations with the South West Interconnected System (SWIS). For locations outside this area the Contractor will need to be directed to Horizon Power and the Clause will need to be amended accordingly. The extent of Horizon Power and SWIS's areas is detailed on the plan available at: http://www.horizonpower.com.au/business/your_account/get_connected/licence_areas.ht ml

 11. PROJECT WORKS SIGNS (Clause 101.08.2)
 11.1 Clause 101.08.2 refers to Annexure 101F & 101G for Project Works Sign details and examples. The project manager will need to enter the number of signs required for the project into the "space" at 1. in Annexure 101F (and also into the Bill of Quantities/Schedule of Rates) and ensure their location is shown on the Drawings.
 11.2 For all State funded capital works projects the example sign drawing number 200731-0020 is the approved sign layout and must be used. Alternative sign layouts for non-State funded projects are also available on-line and all Drawings are available through the link at Annexure 101G. Further advice on signs may be obtained from the Traffic Engineering Standards Manager.
 
 11.3
 
 If an "Opening Date", is required to be included on the sign it may be prudent
 
 when determining a date to use the anticipated time of the year e.g. "Opening Mid 2008"
 
 rather than to the exact tender date of completion.
 
 12.
 
 AS BUILT AND HANDOVER REQUIREMENTS (Clause 107.01-107.10)
 
 12.1 On all metropolitan projects where there is need for the Contractor to provide any of the above information such as, as built drawings, operating manuals and the like, the Project Manager should liaise with the Data Management Support Officer in the Asset Management Section of Metropolitan Region, as to the adequacy and format of the information that will need to be provided
 
 12.2 Where the information to be provided relates to a particular Specification Series such as for, traffic signal manuals, then the requirements shall be detailed in the As Built and Handover Requirements section of the relevant Specification.

 ANNEXURE 201A
 
 TESTING REQUIREMENTS
 
 In accordance with the requirements of the Contract for monitoring and measurement, testing procedures and minimum testing frequencies shall conform to the following details:
 
 1.0
 
 GENERAL
 
 This Annexure sets out the minimum sampling and testing requirements for the acceptance of various works to be carried out under the Contract. Additional sampling, testing and acceptance requirements may be detailed elsewhere in the Specification or in referenced Standards. Where no minimum sampling and testing requirements are specified the Contractor shall be able to demonstrate conformance of the work in accordance with Clause 9.1 of AS/NZS ISO 9001.
 
 Included in the test methods shown in the following sections are requirements for test authorities to be NATA accredited for the following applicable sampling and sample preparation methods: WA 0.1, 100.1, 105.1, 200.1, 701.1, 705.1 and AS 1012 part 1.
 
 The Contractor shall be responsible for patching holes made as a result of sampling and testing.
 
 The sample and test holes shall be backfilled immediately after sampling or testing by the persons responsible for carrying out the sampling and testing. Backfilled material shall have similar properties and shall be compacted at or near optimum moisture content to densities matching the surrounding material.
 
 THE CONTRACTOR'S CONFORMANCE DECISION SHALL APPLY TO THE WHOLE OF THE LOT OR PART OF THE WORK SUBJECT TO TEST.
 
 1.1
 
 TEST METHODS
 
 1.1.1
 
 DENSITY - EARTHWORKS AND PAVEMENT
 
 For the Works in general, density shall be measured in-situ by use of a nuclear moisture/density meter in accordance with WA 324.2. All measurements shall be made using the direct transmission mode.
 
 If the in-situ density is outside the range of densities 1.5-3.05 t/m for which the nuclear moisture/density meter can be calibrated then WA 324.1 shall be used.
 
 For the purpose of measuring conformance of all work under the Contract, the in-situ density shall be expressed as a percentage of the maximum dry density. This percentage shall be calculated in accordance with WA 134.1.
 
 The maximum dry density shall be determined by WA 133.1 or WA 133.2. Where the pavement material is stabilised or modified with Portland Cement, the maximum dry density determinations shall be commenced two (2) hours after mixing is complete and shall be completed within a further two (2) hours. If Low Heat (LH) Cement or Lime is used for the stabilisation or modification, these determinations shall be commenced three (3) hours after mixing is complete and shall be completed within a further three (3) hours.

 1.1.2
 
 DENSITY AND IN-SITU AIR VOIDS - ASPHALT
 
 Density and in-situ air voids shall be determined on the basis of the results of tests of core samples of asphalt sampled from the pavement in a stratified random manner, after laying and compaction, in accordance with WA 701.1. Core samples shall not be taken from asphalt placed on a bridge deck or other concrete structure. Core samples shall be taken from asphalt placed over a geotextile reinforced seal.
 
 The density of the samples shall be determined in accordance with WA 733.1 or WA 733.2. The density shall be expressed as a percentage of the mean Marshall Density of accepted asphalt from the same production shift in accordance with WA 731.1 and WA 733.1 or WA 733.2. The air voids shall be calculated using the mean Maximum Density of asphalt from the same production shift in accordance with WA 732.2 and WA 733.1.
 
 1.1.3
 
 MOISTURE CONTENT
 
 The Moisture content shall be determined using WA 110.1. If it is not practicable to use this method, then WA 110.2 or WA 324.2 may be used. However, correlation must be established with WA 110.1 before proceeding with the subsidiary methods WA 110.2 and WA 324.2.
 
 1.1.4
 
 CROSSFALL AND DEVIATION FROM A STRAIGHT EDGE
 
 Crossfall and deviation from a straight edge shall be measured by WA 313.2.
 
 1.2
 
 IN-SITU DENSITY AND AIR VOIDS
 
 1.2.1
 
 IN-SITU DENSITY
 
 The conformance of every Lot of the work under the Contract with respect to density shall be determined by comparing the Characteristic Dry Density Ratio of the Lot (or the Characteristic Percent Marshall Density of the Lot for asphalt) and the limits specified in the Specification.
 
 The dry density ratio (or the Marshall density) shall be determined at the number of locations per Lot defined in Table 201A-1. The locations shall be selected in accordance with WA 0.1.
 
 The Characteristic Dry Density Ratio (or the Characteristic Percent Marshall Density), Rc, of a Lot shall be calculated thus:
 
 where; R
 
 Rc = R - ks
 is the mean of the results of dry density ratio tests (or the mean of the results of the percentage of Marshall Density tests) on the Lot being assessed, reported to the nearest 0.1 percent

 Likelihood Rare
 Unlikely
 Possible
 Likely Almost certain
 
 Description
 The event or hazard: may occur only in exceptional circumstances, will probably occur with a frequency of less than 0.02 times per year (i.e. less than once in 50 years).
 The event or hazard: could occur at some time, will probably occur with a frequency of 0.02 to 0.1 times per year (i.e. once in 10 to 50 years).
 The event or hazard: might occur at some time, will probably occur with a frequency of 0.1 to 1 times per year (i.e. once in 1 to 10 years).
 The event or hazard: will probably occur in most circumstances, will probably occur with a frequency of between 1 and 10 times per year.
 The event or hazard: is expected to occur in most circumstances, will probably occur with a frequency in excess of 10 times per year.
 
 IMPORTANT NOTE: The likelihood of an event or hazard occurring shall first be assessed over the duration of the activity (i.e. "period of exposure"). For risk assessment purposes the assessed likelihood shall then be proportioned for a "period of exposure" of one year.
 Example: An activity has a duration of 6 weeks (i.e. "period of exposure" = 6 weeks). The event or hazard being considered is assessed as likely to occur once every 20 times the activity occurs (i.e. likelihood or frequency = 1 event/20 times activity occurs = 0.05 times per activity). Assessed annual likelihood or frequency = 0.05 times per activity x 52 weeks/6 weeks = 0.4 times per year. Assessed likelihood = Possible.

 GUIDANCE NOTES
 FOR REFERENCE ONLY  DELETE GUIDANCE NOTES FROM FINAL DOCUMENT
 1. All edits to downloaded Specifications shall be made using Track Changes, to clearly show added/deleted text.
 2. If all information relating to a clause is deleted, the clause number should be retained and the words "NOT USED" should be inserted.
 3. The proposed documents with tracked changes shall be submitted to the Project Manager for review, prior to printing the final batch of documents. When this final printing is carried out, the tracked changes option is to be turned off.
 4. Before printing accept all changes in the document, turn off Track Changes and refresh the Table of Contents.
 5. The Custodian of this specification is Road Safety Policy Manager.
 
 1. PRINCIPAL IDENTIFIED HAZARDS (Annexure 202A)
 1.1 Edit the CONTRACT MANDATORY hazards to suit the Works by deleting those not required, and add any CONTRACT SPECIFIC hazards as necessary.
 
 2. SIDETRACKS AND DETOURS (Clauses 202.43 and 202.81)
 2.1 Where sidetracks or detours are required, include Clause 202.81 under the section CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS as a supplement to Clause 202.43. Complete Annexure 202C as required.
 2.2 Project Managers should consider the use of sealed sidetracks for the safe movement of traffic through the Works. Problems have been experienced on Works where traffic (especially motorcyclists) has been required to travel on wet unsealed sections of construction.
 2.3 Design Requirements (Annexure 202C)  The Tables must be filled in to ensure compliance with requirements. Please note that a construction-staging plan should be developed along with the design such that the Principal can prove that the construction of the Works can be done. The staging plan MUST be included in the Information for Tenderers Book for Contractors to be informed that the design was developed using this proposed staging. The Contractor may wish to approach staging differently as an innovation to the Contract.
 2.4 Exclusions for sidetracks must complement the Environmental requirements.
 
 3. STAGING REQUIREMENTS (Annexure 202G)
 
 3.1 The Contractor's Traffic Management Plan will as required be based on the provisions contained in the staging requirements for the Works as shown in Annexure 202G, which could include the need for Separable Portions to the Contract.
 3.2 These requirements should be inserted as necessary where complex traffic control measures are involved, as may be the case for Works in densely trafficked urban areas.

 3.3 Annexure 202G may also include diagrams as appropriate, or simply refer to the Drawings. 3.4 If not a requirement, delete Annexure 202G.
 4. TRAFFIC RESTRICTIONS (Annexure 202H)
 4.1 Special requirements for Traffic Management can be inserted here, such as may be required for densely trafficked urban situations.
 4.2 Examples of typical requirements for inclusion in the Contractor's TCD could be as follows: a) Work to traffic lanes will be confined to non-peak traffic periods. Peak traffic periods for normal weekdays Monday to Friday will be taken as: 7.00 am to 9.00 am for the morning peak 4.00 pm to 6.00 pm for the evening peak (Check peak traffic times for the particular Works situation) b) The existing number of traffic lanes may need to be maintained at all times. The minimum lane width available to traffic during the Works will be 3.0 m. The minimum width of temporary traffic islands or medians will be 1.5 m. (Again, check appropriate details) c) The maximum gradient for any temporary traffic ramp will be 10%, and will be negotiable in safety by semi-trailers and other large commercial vehicles. d) Through traffic lanes may need to be maintained in a sealed condition at all times. Newly-constructed through traffic lanes open to traffic without the final bituminous surface treatment will be provided with the surface treatment as specified in Annexure 202C. This requirement will also apply at all weekends and Public Holidays. e) The column "Other" could include the number of lanes required to be open for traffic during "periods of no work" longer than one day.

 CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
 
 The following clauses are to be placed under the CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS, as required. After inserting the clause, change the clause number and heading to style "H2 SP" so it appears in the Table of Contents.
 
 202.81 SIDETRACKS AND DETOURS
 
 202.81.01 DESIGN
 
 1. Sidetracks shall provide for two-way traffic flow and shall be constructed to give a minimum clear width of four (4.0) metres for each lane of traffic.
 
 Width
 
 2. All sidetracks shall be constructed to the alignment shown on the Drawings, otherwise the sidetrack shall generally be constructed outside the limits of earthworks but within the road corridor and comply with the requirements of the Contract.
 
 Alignment
 
 3. The sidetrack alignment shall be deviated as much as practicable to maximise the retention of trees and other significant vegetation.
 4. The sidetrack alignment and general geometry shall be such that horizontal and vertical curves are designed to meet the speed limit posted for the sidetrack. The first horizontal curve leading away from the existing road and into the sidetrack shall be designed to be a minimum of 10km/h above the proposed design speed limit.
 
 Deviations Curve Radii
 
 5. Sidetrack grades shall be limited to a maximum of 10%. Grades exceeding 7% shall be sealed. An unsealed sidetrack shall have a maintained crossfall of between 4% and 6% to ensure dispersion of surface water.
 
 Maximum Grades and
 Crossfall
 
 6. Horizontal and vertical curves in combination shall be avoided, especially on routes where high wide load vehicles or road trains are likely to traverse the sidetrack.
 
 Horizontal and Vertical Curves
 
 7. The construction of sidetracks will not be permitted at the locations as indicated in Table 202C.02 (Annexure 202C).
 
 Sidetracks Prohibited
 
 8. Unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent, the maximum length of unsealed sidetrack open to traffic in one continuous length shall not exceed five (5) km in any one direction followed by a sealed roadway not less than 5 km.
 
 Maximum Length
 
 9. The Contractor shall stage the construction of the Works to minimise the disruption to all road users. The Contractor shall adjust the staging as required to address the impacts of advertised events.
 
 Staging of the Works
 
 202.81.02 CONSTRUCTION
 
 1. At least 2 working days prior to commencing any work associated with the construction of sidetracks, the Contractor shall advise the Superintendent in writing of the location, design speed, alignment and width of such tracks, where such details are not specified.

 2. Clearing and topsoil removal for sidetracks shall be as specified in Specification 301 CLEARING and Specification 302 EARTHWORKS. Topsoil windrows shall be stockpiled within a two-metre wide strip upstream of the sidetrack to avoid creating a "dam" effect.
 3. After removal of topsoil and completion of the formation and shaping operation, the sidetrack foundation shall be compacted in accordance with Specification 302 EARTHWORKS embankment foundation. Embankment Construction shall be constructed in accordance with Specification 302 EARTHWORKS.
 4. Where necessary, borrow material or other material provided for sidetrack construction shall be imported for sheeting purposes in locations where the insitu material does not produce the specified driving surface. The minimum compacted depth shall be 150 mm ( 50 mm). Clay soils with a Plasticity Index (PI) exceeding 10 shall not be used as a surface material.
 5. The Contractor shall provide drainage to sidetracks including off road drainage to prevent ponding of water on or adjacent to the sidetrack. Culverts shall be installed at creeks, streams and well-defined low points as necessary in accordance with Specification 404 CULVERTS. Culverts shall be designed for an Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) of one (1) year.
 6. Sidetracks shall be sealed to provide an all-weather surface at those locations nominated in this Annexure. Sealing shall be in accordance with Specification 503 BITUMINOUS SURFACING.
 7. The Traffic Management Representative shall sign a Certificate of Compliance that certifies the sidetrack meets the requirements of the Contract. The Certificate shall be presented prior to detouring traffic onto newly constructed sections of sidetrack.

 IMPORTANT NOTE: The likelihood of an event or hazard occurring shall first be assessed over the duration of the activity (i.e. "period of exposure"). For risk assessment purposes the assessed likelihood shall then be proportioned for a "period of exposure" of one year.
 Example: An activity has a duration of 6 weeks (i.e. "period of exposure" = 6 weeks). The event or hazard being considered is assessed as likely to occur once every 20 times the activity occurs (i.e. likelihood or frequency = 1 event/20 times activity occurs = 0.05 times per activity). Assessed annual likelihood or frequency = 0.05 times per activity x 52 weeks/6 weeks = 0.4 times per year. Assessed likelihood = C (i.e. Possible)

 1. GENERAL
 As part of the pre-qualification process contractors engaged on major works contracts are required to have OSH management systems that have been certified to AS/NZS4801 Occupational Health and Safety Management System.
 
 1.01 Principal Responsibilities
 Under the OSH Act 1984, the Principal has the capacity to exercise control and is also responsible for ensuring a safe and healthy working environment on construction sites. A key element of that responsibility is to identify hazards, assess the risks and determine suitable controls.
 
 1.02 National Standard for Construction Work Under the OSH Regulations 1996, Division 12 of Part 3, Construction industry  consultation on hazards and safety management outlines the responsibilities of:
  Designers (Clause 3.140);  Main Contractors (Clause 3.141); and  Clients (Clause 3.139).
 
 1.02.1 Responsibilities of Designers (Clause 3.140) Designers must forward to the Client a written report that identifies:
  all hazards arising from the design;
 Document No: Dxx#xxxxx Contract No: xxxx/xx Contract Name
 
 Page 30 of 35
 
 Specification 203 Occupational Safety and Health  04/10094-02 Issued 11/10/2018
 
  assessment of the risks arising from the hazards;
  action taken to reduce the hazard risks; and
  any hazards identified but have not been resolved. The PM must ensure that they receive a detailed report from the Designer, appropriate for the nature of the hazard and degree of risk for each design. The PM must then determine how the hazards detailed in the Design Report are communicated to the Contractor:
  in contract specific requirements;
  in the Principal's Identified Hazards in Annexure 203A; and/or
  to include the Design Report in the Information for Tenderers. The hazards identified in the Design Report must be addressed in the Contractor's OSH Management Plan.
 1.02.2 Responsibilities of Main Contractor (Clause 3.141) The Main Contractor must as far as practicable ensures that:
  all hazard records are maintained;
  assess the risk of injury from the hazards;
  take action by means to reduce the risks. It is therefore a requirement of this Specification that:
 a) The Project Manager or Superintendent shall ensure appropriate risk assessment for all foreseeable hazards have been identified and risk potential determined by competent team members in sufficient detail;
 b) Based on the outcome of the risk assessment the Specification will be added to in prescribed Clauses to reflect the risk profile; and
 c) The risk assessment will be forwarded to the Superintendent's 2nd party OSH Auditor when the Contract OSH Management Plan's suitability is assessed to ensure the auditor is aware of the critical issues associated with the Contract.
 1.02.3 Responsibilities of the Client (Clause 3.139) The Client must consult with the Designer and Main Contractor that persons doing the construction work may do so without risk to their health and safety. The Client must ensure that information given to the client meets workplace safety requirements Part 3, Division 12 of the OSH Regulations 1996 Construction industry  consultation on hazards and safety management etc.
 2. PRINCIPAL IDENTIFIED HAZARDS (Annexure 203A) 2.1 Annexure 203A outlines a schedule of common hazards associated with Main Roads Contracts. The Contractor is required to at least address this list of hazards in its
 
 Document No: Dxx#xxxxx Contract No: xxxx/xx Contract Name
 
 Page 31 of 35
 
 Specification 203 Occupational Safety and Health  04/10094-02 Issued 11/10/2018
 risk management plan and include the assessment, together with prescribed control measures into the Contract OSH Management Plan. 2.2 ACTION  Any unlisted hazards should be added to the list as necessary in accordance with the project team's risk assessment.
 3. HAZARD IDENTIFICATION (Clause 203.16) 3.1 This Section looks to ensure that issues associated with key OSH hazards are addressed in detail by the Contractor as part of the Contract OSH Management Plan. Specific requirements in respect to Plant and Equipment and Traffic Hazards have been included in the Specification and are mandatory for all contracts. Other requirements may be added based on issues that come out of the project risk assessment.
 3.2 ACTION - Add specific requirements relating to identified hazards e.g. Asbestos, Dust, etc. in CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. It is worth noting that risk requirements relating to dust and vibration management, property damage and some environmental issues such as waste management have significance under the occupational safety and health legislation and have therefore been referenced as part of this Specification. These requirements also have environmental implications and the requirements for dealing with these environmental issues are dealt with in Specification 204 ENVIRONMENT. Traffic management is almost entirely an OSH management issue and is dealt with comprehensively through Specification 202 TRAFFIC.
 4. CYCLONE PREPAREDNESS 4.1 Project Managers preparing project documentation for projects located within the regions most likely to be affected by cyclones are reminded that they shall consider the risks associated with this factor and ensure all tenderers are made fully aware of Main Roads' cyclone procedures and requirements to allow them to consider them in relation to ANNEXURE 203C Item 3. 4.2 The Joint Resources Safety/WorkSafe Safety Bulletin issued on 2 April 2007 provides recommendations that shall be included into existing cyclone procedures and is accessible through the following link: http://www.worksafe.wa.gov.au/newsite/worksafe/media/pdf/alerts/joint_safety_bulletin0 001.pdf

 GENERAL
 
 This Specification lays out the Principal's minimum environmental requirements that the Contractor must develop and detail in the contract specific Environmental Management Plan to deliver the Works. All Pre-qualified tenderers must have in place an environment management system conforming to AS/NZS ISO 14001 to tender for Major Works Contracts.
 
 The approach of this Specification is to follow the structure of AS/NZS ISO 14001 to assist the Contractors' development of the contract specific Environmental Management Plan based on their pre-qualified submission. In this way, Audits can be done to ensure compliance to the standardised systems and ensure that the Principal's obligations are met under the Act and associated Regulations.
 
 The specification has been structured to allow Contractors to use management system elements from established systems such as Environmental Management Systems or Integrated Management Systems where generic approach to management is applicable.
 
 The Specification does require the Contractor to prepare a Contract Specific Aspects and Impacts Register (Annexure 204H) which addresses the elements that are unique to the project.
 
 The Contractor is required to provide a register in the form shown in Annexure 204H which has been developed to follow a systematic approach to impact identification, assessment and treatment. The flow chart below outlines the key stages in the processes.

 DELETE THESE GUIDANCE NOTES FROM FINAL DOCUMENT AFTER USING FOR REFERENCE
 All edits to downloaded TDP documents shall be tracked (most word processing software allows this to be done automatically). Deletions shall be struck through e.g. example. Insertions shall be in italics e.g. example. If all information relating to a clause is deleted then the clause number should be retained and the words "NOT USED" should be inserted.
 The proposed documents with tracked changes shall be submitted to the Project Manager for review, prior to printing the final batch of documents. When this final printing is carried out, the tracked changes option is to be turned off.
 The Custodian of this specification is the Principal Design Engineer Regional Support.
 
 1. GENERAL
 When setting out the extent of clearing and demolition works it is important to carefully consider the management of the existing site vegetation. Clearing must be conducted in accordance with the Clearing Permit and the area approved in the Preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment (PEIA).
 2. CLEARING PERMIT
 The Environmental Protection (Clearing of Native Vegetation) Regulations 2004 and associated amendments to the Environmental Protection Act 1986 includes limits and conditions on obtaining permits for the clearing of native vegetation. For more details on the requirements and on the clearing exemptions refer to the Main Roads Environmental Guideline Native Vegetation Clearing Regulations and Permits, (Document No. 6707/034).
 The Project Manager MUST ensure that an authorised clearing permit is secured for the clearing works and a copy of the permit is provided to the Contractor in the Information for Tenderers or at Contract Award. The clearing permit shall be for all works under the Contract including the clearing of sidetracks and temporary work areas and be referenced in Specification 202 TRAFFIC.
 The Contractor shall be required to include a copy of the clearing permit with the Hold Point submission. The contractual implications of not having a permit prior to the start of the clearing works include time delays and costs.
 3. VEGETATION CLEARING
 Table 301A.1 should be completed to provide a specific schedule of clearing widths and the treatment of cleared vegetation, if these details are not clearly shown in the Drawings.
 
 MAIN ROADS Western Australia Contract xxx/xx
 
 Specification 301 Clearing
 Document 04/10098 Issue 26/08/2013
 
 Page 19 of 24
 
 A detailed schedule is critical in environmentally sensitive areas and dieback-affected areas, where it is important to minimise the impacts and extent of clearing. Clearing and Topsoil Management Drawing(s) should be prepared as part of the design documentation for all work projects.
 Ensure the sidetracks are also pegged out.
 4. EXTENT OF CLEARING AND LIMITATION
 It is important to ensure that the Drawings clearly show the full extent of clearing necessary at the top of the batter (e.g. to allow for windrow of topsoil) and to include a typical cross section showing the limit of the clearing. The Drawings must include only the extent of clearing described in the clearing permit / environmental approvals.
 
 5. TREATMENT OF CLEARED VEGETATION 5.1 General
 
 One or more of the following treatments for cleared vegetation may be applicable, as determined by the specific site conditions (e.g. soil and vegetation type) and project requirements.
 
  Disposal of unwanted vegetation off site (e.g. disease and or weed infected or excess to the quantity of mulch required for the works).
 
  Chipping of vegetation and or `shrub rolling' of vegetation (shrubs and groundcovers) and incorporation of the vegetation (disease and weed-free) into the existing topsoil for stockpiling and later respread.
 
  Chipping and stockpiling of cleared vegetation (disease and weed-free) for later respread as mulch over batter slopes and cleared surfaces.
 
 In some locations (e.g. in sandy heath vegetation) the most cost effective treatment is by rolling over the existing shrub and understory vegetation in-situ, and in the process roughly incorporating the vegetation into the existing topsoil, with suitable land clearing equipment. The appropriate treatment must be determined in the design process and be documented in the Drawings (e.g. clearing and topsoil management plan) or as an Annexure.
 
 5.2 Salvageable Material
 
 If the salvage and disposal of timber logs to timber mills is to form part of the clearing operations undertaken by the Contractor, it is suggested a Provisional Sum be provided to cover the costs over and above the clearing operations to cover felling of the trees any handling, temporary storage and transport to a timber mill. Include a clause under the treatment of cleared vegetation to cover any necessary arrangements to be made and the salvage value of the timber.
 
 5.3 Cartage and Stockpiling of Cleared Vegetation
 
 Cleared vegetation shall be removed and shall be stacked in neat manageable stockpiles at approved locations. The temporary stockpiling of the cleared vegetation shall be minimised and cartage to the final stockpile location shall be undertaken as
 
 MAIN ROADS Western Australia Contract xxx/xx
 
 Specification 301 Clearing
 Document 04/10098 Issue 26/08/2013
 
 Page 20 of 24
 
 soon as possible after the clearing operations and within 2 days after clearing, to minimise drop of viable seed material (that is useful for revegetation) to the ground.
 5.4 Chipping of Cleared Vegetation
 All disease-free and weed-free cleared vegetation as nominated in the Drawings or Annexure 301A for chipping into organic mulch shall be reduced in size by chipping, splitting, cutting, mowing, slashing, grinding, etc. to useable mulch material. The average grade size shall be between 15mm - 50mm, with no individual pieces greater than 100mm. No woody and herbaceous weed species shall be included into the chipped material. Chipping of vegetation shall be undertaken as soon as possible after the clearing operations and within 7 days after clearing to avoid excessive drying out of the material.
 6. TRANSPLANTING
 Where appropriate, transplanting of certain desirable vegetation (e.g. grass trees) can be used to preserve a scarce or attractive native plant type local to the area. Lifting and temporary storage of the target species can be carried out prior to the main clearing operations, and transplanting to final location can be made part of Specification 304 REVEGETATION AND LANDSCAPING.
 Insert a listing of the locations of any individual plant to be transplanted as Annexure 301A 3.
 A suggested clause for the transplanting of grass trees (Xanthorrhoea) is given in Specification 304 REVEGETATION AND LANDSCAPING. Requirements for other species would be similar, but should be checked for accuracy with the Main Roads Landscape Architect. Include a measure and payment item(s), and note the HOLD POINT for temporary storage.
 7. PROTECTION OF EXISTING VEGETATION
 Insert a listing of the locations of any vegetation to be retained and protected during the clearing operations (include protection details) as Table 301A 3.
 8. DEMOLITION ITEMS
 Annexure 301B should be completed to provide a specific schedule of demolition item locations and details. Particular items for demolition should also be listed, e.g. old kerbing, fencing, stock grids, etc. Note that Specification 803 DISMANTLING & DEMOLITION should be used where existing bridges and associated structures are involved.
 9. SUITABLE STOCKPILE LOCATIONS
 Insert a listing of suitable stockpile locations for the storage of cleared vegetation as Annexure 301C. It is recommended that the preferred locations for stockpiling of materials be identified by the Principal to minimise potential environment impacts. The Contractor may nominate alternative sites subject to the Superintendent's approval that the sites comply with the specifications.
 
 MAIN ROADS Western Australia Contract xxx/xx
 
 Specification 301 Clearing
 Document 04/10098 Issue 26/08/2013
 
 Page 21 of 24
 
 Sites for the stockpiling and storage of vegetation must be managed to ensure that the properties of the vegetation are not degraded and made unsuitable for use in the revegetation and landscaping works, e.g. by weed infestation of the stockpiles. Refer to Figure 301C.1 Typical Cross Section for Stockpiles of Chipped Vegetation.
 Stockpiling and storage of cleared vegetation must not occur on uncleared native vegetation.
 
 10. ESTIMATING THE VOLUME OF VEGETATION TO BE CLEARED
 An estimate of the expected volume of cleared vegetation will provide an estimate of the required stockpile area. The following estimates are based on prior experience in the local land clearing industry.
  Heavy vegetation (Forest, well timbered) ~ 300 -350m3/ha  Medium vegetation (Banksia woodland) ~ 200 m3/ha  Light vegetation (scrubland, wattles) ~ 50 -100m3/ha
 Area (m2) of stockpile required = ~ estimate of total volume of cleared vegetation/height of stockpiles (~1.5m). Allow for access for placing materials and management of stockpiles of chipped vegetation to be in accordance with FIGURE 301C.01 TYPICAL CROSS SECTION FOR STOCKPILES OF CHIPPED VEGETATION in Annexure 301C2.
 For mixed vegetation cover (i.e. varied across the project area) the estimate of volume should be based on the above rates and the area of cover. In South West forest areas the vegetation cover may get heavier up to 450m3/ha. Chipping machinery (1000hp) can chip up to 400mm diameter tree trunks.
 
 11. EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL
 Erosion and sedimentation control measures may be a requirement in advance of, or in conjunction with clearing and grubbing operations. Note that a separate Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan should be prepared where erosion control operations are required. Refer to Guidance notes in Specification 302 EARTHWORKS.
 
 12. WEED CONTROL The control of undesirable weed species (e.g. declared species) may be a requirement prior to clearing operations. Insert a listing of any known locations for weed control (include details) as Annexure 301A.4 and include a note that weed species may include, but are not limited to, any listing of nominated weed species identified in Table 301A.4.
 The Contractor must identify all weed species within the Contract area and prepare a Weed Control Program for approval by the Superintendent. Advice on appropriate herbicide use should be sought from an environmental specialist in the area.
 Acceptance criteria for weed control shall be as a minimum:
  The approved weed control program has been implemented to the satisfaction of the Superintendent.

 EARTHWORKS QUANTITIES (Annexure 302A)
 
 1.1
 
 Due to inevitable discrepancies between estimated and remeasured (actual)
 
 earthworks volumes, consideration could be given to issue any summary of earthworks
 
 quantities under the heading "Information for Tenderers" and reference to Annexure
 
 302A deleted. The issue of the detailed MX GENIO output may be another alternative
 
 (perhaps even in electronic format), either as part of the normal tender documentation,
 
 or for inspection upon request.
 
 1.2
 
 If inserted at Annexure 302A, the earthworks summary should be limited to a
 
 summary of the major cuts and fills, and certain qualifications should be stated with the
 
 data:
 
 a) Volumes listed should be solid volumes (as they are in the Schedule of Rates), and should be stated as solid volumes (i.e. no bulking). Any assumptions about bulking when excavations are proposed to be used as fills should be left to the Contractor to make.
 
 b) The allowance made (if any) for the removal of topsoil, i.e. do the volumes in the summary include topsoil or not? (NOTE: Earthworks quantities given in the Schedule of Rates are usually given with the topsoil removed, as topsoil removal is measured separately as an area).

 TOPSOIL REMOVAL, STORAGE AND RESPREAD
 
 2.1
 
 Sufficient topsoil should be stripped from the Site and/or imported to provide
 
 a supply of suitable growing medium (to support vegetation) for use in revegetation and
 
 landscaping works.
 
 2.2
 
 AS 4419 is the recommended standard for defining the requirements of soils
 
 for landscaping use and the testing of soil properties. The conditioning (improvement) of
 
 topsoil and supply of imported topsoil is covered in Specification 304 REVEGETATION
 
 AND LANDSCAPING.
 
 2.3
 
 Only the upper 100 to 200 millimetres of a Site soil layer is usually
 
 biologically active and of the greatest value in revegetation and landscaping. This is
 
 only the O and A soil horizons (refer to Australian Soil and Land Survey Field Handbook
 
 McDonald et al, 1990). It is important that:
 
 a) this active topsoil layer and the subsoil is not mixed in the stripping and stockpiling process;
 
 b) stockpiling is limited to the minimum practical period;
 
 c) the height of topsoil stockpiles and batter slopes are limited as per Figure 302D.01
 
 d) the properties of stockpiled topsoil are not degraded by weed infestation and or erosion.
 
 2.4
 
 The stripping and handling of topsoil should ideally only occur when the field
 
 soil moisture content is optimum for the particular soil texture class. Movement of soil
 
 that is too wet or dry may result in the loss of topsoil properties that are important for the
 
 effective use in revegetation and landscaping e.g. stripping dry sandy soil will result in
 
 mixing of the topsoil and subsoil layers, unless care is taken. Measures to improve the
 
 workability of the soil may be required, i.e. allowing the soil to dry out or watering to bind
 
 dry soil and control dust.
 
 2.5
 
 Sites for the stockpiling and storage of topsoil must be managed to ensure
 
 that the properties of the topsoil are not degraded and made unsuitable for use in the
 
 revegetation and landscaping works, e.g. by soil erosion and or weed infestation of the
 
 stockpiles. Refer to Figure 302D.01 Typical Cross Section for Stockpiles of Topsoil.
 
 2.6
 
 Control of soil erosion and weed invasion may require the consideration of
 
 on-site surface drainage, the potential use of protective covers; (e.g. hydro-mulch or
 
 seeding with a temporary cover crop or by spreading of in-situ or imported vegetation
 
 mulch) and weed control measures. More details are provided in the Specification 304
 
 REVEGETATION AND LANDSCAPING.
 
 2.7
 
 The rehabilitation of all batter and ground surfaces including respread of
 
 topsoil (site topsoil and/or imported topsoil) shall be in accordance with specification
 
 clauses for Rehabilitation.
 
 2.8
 
 It is critical that soil used for revegetation is stable and the physical
 
 properties provide a suitable growing medium (to support vegetation). Soil types vary
 
 across the state, but as a general rule the proportion of oversized soil material larger
 
 than 100mm in size should be limited to a minimum.
 
 a) for broad scale revegetation areas to be direct seeded or for planting by tube stock with native species, most of the soil material (>98%) should ideally pass a 75mm sieve.
 
 b) for general landscape plantings most of the soil material (>90%) should pass a 50mm sieve and for grassed areas a 20mm sieve.

 PRINCIPAL'S METHOD SPECIFICATIONS - PLANT REQUIREMENTS
 
 8.1
 
 The types of rollers and number of passes given in the Principal's Method
 
 Specifications for Embankment Foundation, Embankment Construction and
 
 Subgrade are fairly typical, but consideration could be given to providing Project
 
 Managers the opportunity in Annexure 302B to vary the rollers and number of passes.

 OVERLAY CONSTRUCTION (Clause 302.22.02)
 
 9.1
 
 The preparatory work required on the retained pavement prior to the overlay
 
 being constructed could be paid as a Provisional Sum, as the nature and extent of
 
 such work is very difficult to price. This work will vary from contract to contract, and
 
 could include such items as:
 
 a) trimming off "high" spots
 
 b) filling in "low" spots with additional pavement material
 
 c) watering and rolling to tighten the exposed pavement surface.
 
 9.2
 
 Possibly, an allowance of $1,000.00 - $2,000.00 per km could be used to
 
 assess the amount of the Provisional Sum.
 
 9.3
 
 The questions whether the existing seal may be incorporated into the new
 
 pavement and whether any of the existing pavement will be incorporated into the new
 
 pavement needs to be considered. Is it prone to excessive degradation in the mixing
 
 process or are there cobbles present in the existing pavement that will lead to rapid
 
 wearing or damage of the mixing tynes?
 
 9.3.1
 
 Where the seal is not allowed to be incorporated and mixing is to be carried
 
 out by grader only. (Clause 302.22.02 is applicable).
 
 9.3.2

 SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS
 
 10.1
 
 Unless specified otherwise in the Contract, the sequence of operations
 
 before commencing the topsoil removal shall be:
 
 a) confirm areas of topsoil to be removed with Superintendent.
 
 b) scalp and remove topsoil areas with nominated weeds and or dieback.
 
 c) remove topsoil to be respread.
 
 10.2
 
 Dieback and weed infected soil shall be handled separately to minimise the
 
 risk of spreading weed species across the Site or into other areas. Cleaning down of
 
 machinery before and between operations is essential to prevent the introduction and
 
 spread of weeds or dieback.
 
 10.3
 
 Weed control operations shall occur in accordance with Specification 304
 
 REVEGETATION AND LANDSCAPING.
 
 10.4
 
 Dieback control measures shall occur in accordance with Specification 204
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS.

 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL
 
 11.1
 
 Project environmental commitments include the requirements to control Site
 
 erosion and sedimentation into natural drainage lines. This may require the installation
 
 of temporary and or permanent control measures. The Project Manager should arrange
 
 for an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan to be prepared for the Works. The
 
 Contractor should be required to install and maintain the measures contained within the
 
 Plan, before any section of the earthworks proceeds. Seek advice if required from the
 
 Environment Branch.
 
 11.2
 
 The Project Manager must ensure that the design slopes of batters are
 
 suitable for the proposed revegetation measures. Key locations for attention are steep
 
 batter slopes where subsoil, rock and groundwater may cause instability of topsoil and
 
 vegetation.
 
 11.3
 
 Steep and long slopes increase surface runoff and downslope transport of
 
 surface soil. Surface roughening and benching of bare soil by creating furrows across
 
 slopes, terracing, or by surface roughing (tracking the soil surface) reduces erosion
 
 potential by decreasing runoff velocities, trapping sediment, and increasing infiltration of
 
 water into the soil and will facilitate effective mulching, seeding and planting.
 
 11.4
 
 During the formation layer compaction process leave 200mm of rough and
 
 uncompacted soil at ends to assist in the revegetation of the batter surfaces
 
 11.5
 
 Cut batters greater than 3 metre height shall be benched or stepped to
 
 provide drainage and erosion control and detailed in the Drawings. The floor of the
 
 bench shall not vary by more than the nominated tolerances and the bench must drain
 
 away from the lowest cut face and provide for longitudinal drainage. Benches shall be
 
 maintained free of loose materials until the finishing of batters and ground surfaces.
 
 11.6
 
 Where random rock outcrops occur, leave these on the batter and bench up
 
 to both sides. Leaving the natural rock face exposed and revegetating the remaining
 
 benched batters can make a considerable improvement to the overall appearance of the
 
 cuttings.
 
 12.
 
 RETAINING TREES IN CUT OR FILL SLOPES

 USE OF SURPLUS MATERIALS
 
 13.1
 
 Main Roads often pays to have spoil, carted off site that could have been
 
 used to improve the safety of the new road by reducing batter slopes and filling deep
 
 medians etc. Unsuitable road building material can often be used to enhance batter
 
 slopes or sheet grass affected verges to allow revegetation to be undertaken.

 b) In agricultural regions some level of seeding and/or planting and weed control would be the expected minimum level of treatment.
 
 c) In urban areas a higher standard of revegetation/landscaping is the expected minimum level of treatment.
 
 15.3
 
 Revegetation and landscaping works may be managed as a separable
 
 portion of a roadwork and/or bridgework construction contract, or as a stand-alone minor
 
 works contract.
 
 15.4
 
 Where revegetation/landscaping works form part of a roadwork and/or
 
 bridgework construction contract:
 
 a) Ensure suitable specifications and drawings are prepared for incorporation into the main contract documentation.
 
 b) Ensure the documentation includes any appropriate cross-referencing of specifications (e.g. clearing and earthworks requirements).
 
 c) Ensure that a vegetation establishment period is nominated in the Special Conditions of Contract to supplement the defects liability period in the Conditions of Contract.
 
 15.5
 
 Where the project works are limited to respreading topsoil and chipped
 
 vegetation as mulch and weed control, then ensure adequate completion criteria are
 
 clearly nominated (e.g. erosion control and weed control) as a basis for handover of the
 
 site for any additional revegetation/landscaping works.

 LIME STABILISATION (refer to Clause 302.91)
 
 16.1
 
 Lime stabilisation of earthworks layers is not commonly used. It can be
 
 applied to any earthworks layer, but is typically only applied to the subgrade layer.
 
 16.2
 
 If lime stabilisation of the subgrade is specified, determine the following and
 
 insert into Annexure 302A (in addition to required compaction at Table 302B.02):
 
 a) typically 150mm.
 
 Depth of stabilisation is
 
 b)
 
 Lime content is determined by laboratory testing. Because lime
 
 varies in purity (depending on manufacture) and strength (depending on
 
 whether it is quicklime, hydrated lime or lime slurry), the optimum lime
 
 content (see 16.3) must be expressed as a percentage of equivalent pure
 
 hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide) by dry mass of the subgrade material.
 
 16.3
 
 The process for determining whether Lime stabilisation is appropriate
 
 and the required % of pure hydrated Lime for subgrade stabilisation is;
 
 a)
 
 Refer to section 4.9 Preliminary Binder Selection of the Austroads
 
 Guide to Pavement Technology- Part - 4D: Stabilised Materials, to determine
 
 if Lime is a suitable additive for the selected material.
 
 b)
 
 Undertake laboratory testing (only applicable to
 
 expansive soil) to determine the minimum % of lime (i.e. the Lime Demand)
 
 that must be added to achieve long term soil stabilisation. Determine the
 
 "Lime Demand" of the soil in accordance with VicRoads Manual of Testing,
 
 method RC 131.01 "Lime Saturation Point of Soil (pH Method)". This
 
 method uses hydrated lime for the laboratory testing and includes reference
 
 to a methodology for determining the percentage of lime that must be added
 
 if another type of lime (e.g. quick lime) is used in the field.
 
 c)
 
 Determine the UCS of the stabilised material in accordance with
 
 Main Roads Test Method WA 143.1.
 
 d)
 
 The optimum Lime content of the soil for stabilisation must satisfy both
 
 the Minimum Lime Content to achieve long term stabilisation at Step b) (only
 
 applicable to expansive soil) and the % of lime that must be added to the soil
 
 to produce a 28 day UCS at Step c) falling in the range 0.7MPa to 1.5MPa.
 
 e)
 
 Should the Lime Demand test require a % of lime that results in a
 
 28-day cured UCS that exceeds 1.5MPa then lime stabilisation must
 
 not be used (only applicable to expansive soil).
 
 The minimum practical spread rate that can be achieved by most lime spreaders is 3kg/m2, which equates to approximately 1% lime for laterite gravel stabilised to a depth
 of 150mm.

 CEMENT STABILISATION
 
 17.1
 
 Cement stabilisation can be applied to any earthworks layer, but typically
 
 only to the subgrade layer.
 
 17.2
 
 If cement stabilisation of the subgrade is specified determine the following
 
 and insert into Annexure 302E (in addition to required Compaction):
 
 a) Depth of stabilisation - typically 150mm.
 
 b) Cement content - typical values are 1.0% to 2.0% by mass of the subgrade material.
 
 c) The cement content required will be determined from the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of the material when tested in accordance with WA 143.1. The UCS specimens shall be compacted using General Purpose (type GP) cement, cured for seven (7) days in a controlled environment and immersed in water for four (4) hours prior to compression testing. The specimens are to be compacted at the applicable Characteristic Dry Density Ratio and 100% of OMC. The UCS must be in the range of 0.6  1.0MPa.
 
 17.3
 
 The minimum practical spread rate that can be achieved by most cement
 
 spreaders is 3kg/m2, which equates to approximately 1% cement for laterite gravel
 
 stabilised to a depth of 150mm.

 Pad-foot rollers must be used for initial compaction in accordance with
 
 Clause 302.92.07.

 302.91.06 SPREADING OF LIME
 
 1.
 
 Lime shall be spread uniformly at a controlled rate over the
 
 area to be stabilised using a suitable lime spreader.
 
 2.
 
 The lime stabilised subgrade layer shall contain an average
 
 of not less than the equivalent percentage of hydrated lime (calcium
 
 hydroxide) as shown in Annexure 302E. The percentage stated is a
 
 percentage of the dry mass of the subgrade layer material. The
 
 Contractor shall keep daily records of the amounts of lime used and
 
 actual spread rates achieved per section treated and shall make such
 
 records available to the Superintendent upon request.
 
 3.
 
 The actual spread rate of lime achieved shall be determined
 
 by either:
 
 a) placing three trays each of approximately one third of a square metre in area in front of the lime spreader and measuring the mass of lime deposited on the trays for each lot, or
 
 b) by the use of an on-board electronic weigh scale system.
 
 4.
 
 The percentage lime (P%) shall be calculated thus:
 
 Composition
 
 P% = M x 100 A x T x MDD
 
 Where M =
 
 total mass of lime (kg) as determined by one of the following methods:
 
 a) on each tray b) on-board electronic weight scale system.
 
 A=
 
 method a) total area of the trays (m)
 
 method b) total measured area spread (m)
 
 T=
 
 Thickness to be stabilised (mm) (including
 
 allowances for tolerances and trimming)
 
 MDD = Maximum Dry Density of the pavement material without the addition of lime (kg/m)
 
 5.
 
 The percentage lime determined for each tray in accordance
 
 with this clause shall be maintained within  10% by mass of the
 
 specified lime content throughout the stabilisation works.
 
 6.
 
 The use of an on-board electronic weighing scale system in
 
 determining the values 'M' and 'A' is subject to satisfactory calibration of
 
 the measuring device and the production of associated certification in
 
 accordance with the Contractor's Quality System. Audits on this method
 
 shall be carried out using the measuring tray method.
 
 7.
 
 Once the lime has been spread, no other plant other than
 
 that needed for spreading, or for mixing and spreading the mixed
 
 material, shall be permitted to travel over the area to be stabilised.

 302.91.07 INCORPORATION OF LIME
 
 1.
 
 The spreading of lime shall not proceed when rain is
 
 imminent. The spread lime shall be incorporated into the subgrade layer
 
 immediately following the spreading operation. All spread lime shall be
 
 incorporated into the subgrade layer within the same working day. Lime
 
 shall not be spread when the prevailing wind velocity is sufficient to
 
 make the lime particles airborne.
 
 2.
 
 As a minimum cutting, pulverising, mixing, adding water and
 
 spreading of mixed material shall take place by the stabilising machine
 
 in two separate operations. The first operation shall incorporate 50 % of
 
 the lime spread rate as specified into the full depth of the layer to be
 
 stabilised. Prior to incorporation of the remaining lime into the full depth
 
 of the layer to be stabilised, the stabilised layer shall be compacted by
 
 not less than four (4) complete coverage of a vibratory pad foot roller of
 
 a size not smaller than specified in the Embankment Foundation
 
 Compaction: Principal's Method Specification Clause.
 
 3.
 
 Cutting, pulverising, mixing, adding water and spreading of
 
 mixed material shall continue until the maximum size of all material
 
 (other than rock) is not greater than 25mm, and the lime and water are
 
 uniformly incorporated into the mixed material without streaks or pockets
 
 of lime.
 
 4.
 
 The depth of the stabilisation shall be judged to be
 
 acceptable when the depth after compaction is not less than the layer
 
 thickness specified in Annexure 302E, determined by measuring six (6)
 
 sites per lot in accordance with Main Roads Test Method WA 330.1.
 
 302.91.08 MOISTURE CONTENT
 
 1.
 
 The Moisture Content at any point in the Lot shall be within
 
 90% - 110% of the Optimum Moisture Content of the stabilised material.
 
 2.
 
 The Contractor shall be responsible for achieving and
 
 maintaining the required moisture content by controlling the amount of
 
 water added during the mixing process within the stabilising machine.
 
 302.91.09 COMPACTION
 
 1.
 
 The mixed material shall be compacted to the Characteristic
 
 Dry Density Ratio as shown in Annexure 302B, or greater.
 
 2.
 
 The Contractor shall be responsible for any additional
 
 stabilising, including the supply and incorporation of additional lime,
 
 required as a result of non-compliance with this clause as directed by

 c) It shall have provision for adding water automatically through a system comprising a pump, flow meter, variable control valve and full width spray bar. Each nozzle on the spray bar shall be fully and independently adjustable, and the water pump shall have the capacity to supply up to 1500 litres per minute.
 
 302.92.04 PRELIMINARY TREATMENT
 
 1.
 
 It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to determine
 
 whether pre-ripping of any in-situ material is necessary. Under no
 
 circumstances shall ripping to a depth exceeding the depth to be
 
 stabilised be permitted.
 
 302.92.05 SPREADING OF CEMENT
 
 1.
 
 The cement stabilised subgrade layer shall contain not less
 
 than the proportion of cement as a percentage of the dry mass of
 
 subgrade material as shown in Annexure 302E. Cement shall be spread
 
 uniformly at a controlled rate over the area to be stabilised using a
 
 suitable cement spreader.
 
 2.
 
 The Contractor shall keep daily records of the amounts of
 
 cement used and actual spread rates obtained per section treated.
 
 3.
 
 The percentage cement shall be determined by either
 
 a) placing three (3) trays each of one third one square metre in area in front of the cement spreader and measuring the mass of cement deposited on the trays for each lot, or
 
 b) by use of an on-board electronic weight scale system.

 The percentage cement (P%) shall be calculated thus:
 
 % = M x 100 A x T x MDD
 
 Where M
 a) b)
 
 =
 
 total mass of cement (kg) as
 
 determined by one of the following
 
 methods:
 
 on each tray
 
 on-board electronic weight scale system.
 
 A
 
 =
 
 method a): total area of the
 
 trays (m)
 
 method b): total measured area

 T
 
 =
 
 Thickness to be stabilised (mm)
 
 (including allowances for tolerances and
 
 trimming)
 
 MDD =
 
 Maximum Dry Density of the
 
 subgrade material without the addition of
 
 cement (kg/m)
 
 5.
 
 The percentage cement determined for each tray in
 
 accordance with this Clause shall be maintained within  10% by mass
 
 of the cement content specified in this Clause throughout the
 
 stabilisation works.
 
 6.
 
 The use of an on-board electronic weighing scale system in
 
 determining the values 'M' and 'A' is subject to satisfactory calibration of
 
 the measuring device and the production of associated certification in
 
 accordance with the Contractor's Quality System. Audits on this method
 
 shall be carried out using the measuring tray method.
 
 7.
 
 Once the cement has been spread, no other plant other than
 
 that needed for spreading, or for mixing and spreading the mixed
 
 material, shall be permitted to travel over the area to be stabilised.
 
 Calibration Requirement
 
 302.92.06 INCORPORATION OF CEMENT
 
 1.
 
 The spreading of Cement shall not proceed when rain is
 
 imminent. The spread cement shall be incorporated into the subgrade
 
 layer immediately following the spreading operation. All spread cement
 
 shall be incorporated into the subgrade layer within the same working
 
 day. Cement shall not be spread when the prevailing wind velocity is
 
 sufficient to make the cement particles airborne.
 
 2.
 
 Cutting, stabilising, mixing, adding water and spreading of
 
 mixed material shall take place as a single operation within the
 
 stabilising machine.

 3.
 
 Cutting, stabilising, mixing, adding water and spreading of
 
 mixed material shall continue until the maximum size of all material
 
 (other than rock) is not greater than 25mm, and the cement and water
 
 are uniformly incorporated into the mixed material without streaks or
 
 pockets of cement.
 
 4. The depth of the stabilisation shall be judged to be acceptable when the depth after compaction is not less than the layer thickness shown in Annexure 302E, determined by measuring six (6) sites per lot in accordance with Main Roads Test Method WA 330.1.
 
 302.92.07 COMPACTION
 
 1.
 
 Compaction of the mixed material shall be completed within
 
 six (6) hours of the completion of incorporation of cement into the
 
 subgrade layer and shall be compacted to the Characteristic Dry Density
 
 Ratio as shown in Annexure 302B or greater.
 
 2.
 
 The Moisture Content at any point in the Lot shall be within
 
 90% - 110% of the Optimum Moisture Content of the stabilised material.
 
 Time for Compaction
 
 3.
 
 The Contractor shall achieve and maintain the required
 
 moisture content of the mixed material by controlling the amount of
 
 water added during the mixing process within the stabilising machine.
 
 Moisture Content
 
 4.
 
 Initial compaction must be carried out with a vibratory pad
 
 foot roller of a size not smaller than specified in Clause 302.44.
 
 302.92.08 REWORK
 
 1.
 
 If a completed section of cement stabilisation does not
 
 satisfy all of the requirements of the Specification and has to be
 
 reworked, the layer shall be reworked without the addition of cement at
 
 no cost to the Principal.
 
 2.
 
 Rework shall include any disturbance to the surface of the
 
 cement stabilised layer during trimming to meet shape or level
 
 requirements and the rework depth shall not be less than the full depth
 
 of the affected layer.
 
 Rework
 
 302.92.09 CONSTRUCTION JOINTS
 
 1.
 
 If the stabilised work is such that it cannot be completed in
 
 one continuous operation, the Contractor shall provide construction
 
 joints at each discontinuity in the operation.
 
 2.
 
 All construction joints shall be made transverse to and/or
 
 parallel to the direction of the stabilised run, and shall be made just prior
 
 to the commencement of the next stabilised run.
 
 3.
 
 The joints shall be formed by cutting back into the
 
 compacted stabilised material to form a vertical face. The loose trimmed
 
 material shall be removed from the joint before the next section is mixed
 
 and compacted.

 DELETE THESE GUIDANCE NOTES FROM FINAL DOCUMENT AFTER USING FOR REFERENCE
 All edits to downloaded TDP documents shall be tracked (most word processing software allows this to be done automatically). Deletions shall be struck through e.g. example. Insertions shall be in italics e.g. example. If all information relating to a clause is deleted then the clause number should be retained and the words "NOT USED" should be inserted.
 The proposed documents with tracked changes shall be submitted to the Project Manager for review, prior to printing the final batch of documents. When this final printing is carried out, the tracked changes option is to be turned off.
 The Custodian of this specification is the Senior Environment Officer.
 
 1.
 
 ANNEXURE 303A
 
 Insert requirements for Borrow Pit management into Annexure 303A. The column "Other Requirements" could be used to indicate the need for Dieback Controls at particular pits.
 
 2.
 
 ANNEXURE 303B
 
 Insert the Principal's Environmental Management Plan or the Contractor requirements for preparing the plan in Annexure 303B. The plan must be prepared by an experienced person and reviewed by the Main Roads regional environment officer or the Main Roads Environment Branch. The plan must be prepared and approved prior to the start of pit site operations. Consultation with landholders or land managers must be included in the preparation of the plan and in determining completion criteria.
 
 Completion criteria give the Superintendent something to measure against if the works are completed by Contract. On CALM land, Main Roads is required to achieve a certain plant coverage or survival rate. Other requirements may apply on private land, e.g. return to pasture or timber plantation or alternative crop.
 
 If the Environmental Management Plan does not nominate any rehabilitation completion criteria then the revegetation should be in accordance with the completion criteria in Specification 304 REVEGETATION AND LANDSCAPING. Seek the advice of the Environment Branch to assist in the determination of the appropriate rehabilitation treatment, and ensure the SMM clauses include a suitable reference to any additional requirements.
 
 For further guidance refer to the Environmental Guideline  Pits and Quarries prepared by the Main Roads Environment Branch. This document includes guidance on environmental approvals and on the expected contents of an Environmental Management Plan.

 If a severe impact on a public road is anticipated due to heavy haulage, maintenance of the road can be included, i.e. where a public road forms part of a major haul road, the road shall be maintained to the same standard as at the date of Possession of Site.
 Insert a suitable clause in CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.
 
 4.
 
 REINSTATEMENT OF ROCKY GROUND IN PITS OR QUARRIES
 
 The treatment for extensive rock base that cannot be ripped will depend on the pit location, drainage and what revegetation is to occur. Usual practice is to build up the landform to allow vegetation to establish (e.g. > 1 metre depth) by the return of the overburden, topsoil and vegetation cleared from the pit site. The Environmental Management Plan should identify the suitable treatment on a site-specific basis, e.g. if rock outcrops naturally occur in the area then exposed rock may be acceptable.
 
 Include relevant requirements in Annexure 303B, and insert a suitable clause in CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.

 2. SCOPE OF WORKS
 The revegetation of disturbed soil areas is carried out for environmental and visual amenity to meet the objectives and commitments defined in the Environmental Management Plan for the project.
 Project requirements for revegetation/landscaping will vary significantly. The works may include mass planting and seeding, temporary hydro-mulching to protect an exposed batter surface, irrigated planting and grassing or be limited to respreading topsoil and mulch. Constraints may apply on plant species selection, seed collection and propagation. Soil testing may be necessary in some locations.
 Delete specification clauses not relevant to the project.
 ANNEXURE 304 A
 This sets out the specific contract requirements for the Works. Refer to Section 12 of the Specification Guidance Notes for examples of a completed Annexure.
  List of Contract Drawings The number and content of the Drawings will vary according to the scale and complexity of the works e.g:
  Site Vegetation Clearing.  Site Topsoil management.  Planting Plan (and or Seeding Plan).  Special details or treatments (e.g. Irrigation).
 Insert a listing of the final design drawings (title and drawing reference number).
  Establishment Period Once the initial seeding and planting works have been completed, the new vegetation must also be allowed to establish and grow. The revegetation works may also only be partially successful in the first year. It is essential to allow for a Vegetation Establishment Period with adequate financial incentives, to ensure that follow up works (replacement or infill) are identified and will occur in subsequent years.
 A minimum Vegetation Establishment Period of at least two summers (~ 26 months), following the Completion of the works, is recommended, prior to a handover of the revegetation works for ongoing routine roadside maintenance activities.
 Contract arrangements must be defined as part of the project planning, to cover the establishment of the new vegetation and any remedial works that may become necessary. The contract may be limited to the initial construction works only or include the Vegetation Establishment Period. Ensure that a vegetation establishment period is nominated in the Special Conditions of Contract to replace or to supplement the defects liability period in the Conditions of Contract.
 Insert the nominated Vegetation Establishment Period for the Works

  Defects Liability Period The Works may include built components with a defined Defects Liability Period, e.g. Irrigation system.
 Insert the nominated Defects Liability Period.
  Monitoring Monitoring reports provide important feedback on the effectiveness and success in achieving the contract completion criteria as listed in Annexure 304C. The recommended sequence and timing for monitoring is listed in Annexure 304A. The timing allows assessment and planning for infill and replacement planting in the following years.
 A handover report at the completion of the Works is essential to ensure a smooth transition into the roadside maintenance cycle. It provides a concise record of the works and a sound basis for defining on-going maintenance requirements and any follow-up works by the Asset Manager after handover.
 Insert the nominated timing for the Monitoring Reports.
 Insert the reference to Annexure 304C for Completion Criteria. (Refer to section 12 of the Specification Guidance Notes for an example of a completed Annexure 304C)
 
 ANNEXURE 304 B
 Use schedules to summarise the specific quantities and other contract requirements for the Works based on the design drawings and specifications.
 Amend the template schedules to match the scope of the Works. In small projects the listing of plant and seed species are documented on the design Drawings. For complex and large projects separate schedules are prepared for the plant and seed mix supply and cross-referenced on the Drawings.
 
 Insert the relevant schedules for the Works.
 
 ANNEXURE 304 C This sets out the completion criteria for the Works.
 
 Complete the details for each of the completion criteria provided in the template tables to match the specific site and contract requirements.
 
 The Project Manager must ensure that completion criteria are determined for the works in the project planning and design process. The generic process for setting completion criteria is outlined in the Main Roads environmental guideline Revegetation Planning and techniques Document no. 6707/031.
 
 Completion criteria and the nominated requirements are customised to specific zones within the project area (e.g. batters, drainage basins, medians, roadside verge or planting, seeding or grassing areas) and are based on the design drawings. Key steps are:
 
  Set the management objective by defined zones within the project area.
 
 MAIN ROADS Western Australia Contract xxx/xx
 
 Specification 304 Revegetation & Landscaping Document 04/10101-02 Issue 21/08/09
 
 Page 49 of 63
 
  Set the target to be achieved for each zone (based on the condition of existing vegetation adjacent to the site or project commitments).
  Nominate the completion criteria for each zone.
 A `zone' is an area of varying size but with uniform characteristics. In any given project, zones can be separated by treatments received (e.g. planting, seeding, grassing), soil types, slope angle, position in the landscape (water-shedding or water-accumulating) or a maximum size (e.g. up to 10,000 m2).
 The number of representative plots and the plot size (i.e. two representative plots (10m x 10m or equal area or % of the zone area) per nominated zone within the project area) are defined during the design process and are based on the design drawings. The layout of the representative plots must reflect the shape of the area and the type of vegetation. Plot and size should relate to the overall area (ha) of the project site, e.g. say 1% if site<10ha and 2% if >2ha.
 The expected mean number of plant stems will vary by project area and according to seeding rate and the species used. The sample figures provided in section 12 for Annexure 304C are nominal for urban or agricultural regions. The figures nominated for a project must be estimated to match the plant and seed list and the density of vegetation cover that naturally occurs in the project area.
 In arid areas (where rainfall variability is high) the spacing between individual plants will tend to be greater, with more areas of bare soil, than occurs in the agricultural regions with regular seasonal rainfall and low rainfall variability.
 Note that the requirement for the each zone varies for each stage during the Vegetation Establishment Period.
 Amend the template tables provided to match the specific site and contract requirements.
 Insert the relevant Completion Criteria for the Works.
 3. TIMING OF WORKS
 The timing of the works is fundamental to its effectiveness. Revegetation/landscaping should occur at the optimal time for the Region when the soil moisture content is conducive to seed germination and establishment and as soon as practical after soil preparation. Generally this is limited to match the seasonal rains, otherwise watering must be allowed for.
 It is important that the Superintendent ensure the soil moisture content is conducive to seed germination and establishment before allowing seeding operations to start.
 Timing of the work, including the ordering and acquisition of materials, is dependent on seasonal conditions and the progress of road construction works. Project timetables often mean that a delay occurs between the end of road works and the optimal time to start the revegetation/landscaping works. Where a delay is necessary, the hold over period must be planned and budgeted for prior to finalising the contract. Tasks like weed control, stabilisation of batters, plant and seed supply may be necessary during the hold over period.

 The general sequence of works is weed control, soil preparation, planting/seeding/grassing, and vegetation establishment prior to handover for ongoing maintenance.
 Advice and support can be obtained from the Manager Environment Branch.
 The optimal time for the works should be specified in the Annexure 304B.

 5. PREPARATION OF SOIL SURFACES
 
 Revegetation and landscaping may follow on from new road works or be undertaken within an established roadside or borrow pit. The management of the existing site vegetation and topsoil and weed control activities during clearing and earthworks can facilitate or make revegetation more difficult.
 
 Where revegetation follows on from new road works, it is critical to ensure that the specifications for CLEARING (301) and EARTHWORKS (302) are co-ordinated with and complement the REVEGETATION AND LANDSCAPING (304) Specifications.
 
 Where revegetation occurs within an established roadside, the soil preparation and weed control occurs in response to the site conditions and reflected in the design drawings and Specifications.
 
 6. WATERING Revegetation is like growing agricultural crops and subject to the local weather conditions. Wherever practical watering in the first growing season to complement the rainfall should be used to promote the establishment of vegetation. The Superintendent should confirm the water source, quality (potable if available) and watering system proposed by the Contractor. There are four general types of irrigation for possible use in revegetation works.
 Sprinkler systems (relatively costly, need to be designed, and good water supply).
 Drip or Trickle system (less cost, temporary, permanent, above or below ground)
 Watering hose (limited and not very efficient).
 Watering form a water truck (limited access and use).
 The selection of watering system is dependant on availability of suitable water and size of area to be treated. If area is > 5000m2 then a drip or sprinkler system may be more efficient. Regional advice should be sought on the most appropriate watering system for the project size and location.
 
 7. STEEP BATTER SLOPES
 Project Manager must ensure that the design of batters is suitable for the proposed revegetation measures. Key locations for attention are steep batter slopes where subsoil, rock and groundwater may cause instability of topsoil and vegetation. Additional work in finishing of batters may be required to facilitate revegetation/landscaping works.
 The risk of erosion is directly proportional to the length of time a disturbed soil area is exposed without vegetation cover or other surface protection. Consideration shall be given to the need for batter protection and weed control during any interim period until the main revegetation work can be undertaken.
 
 MAIN ROADS Western Australia Contract xxx/xx
 
 Specification 304 Revegetation & Landscaping Document 04/10101-02 Issue 21/08/09
 
 Page 52 of 63
 
 The installation of temporary and or permanent control measures (e.g. erosion control matting, hydro mulching) may be required to control site surface runoff or wind erosion and minimise disturbance to areas of revegetation.
 Steep and long slopes increase surface runoff and downslope transport of surface soil. Surface roughening and benching of bare soil by creating furrows across slopes, terracing, or by surface roughing (tracking the soil surface) reduces erosion potential by decreasing runoff velocities, trapping sediment, and increasing infiltration of water into the soil and will facilitate effective mulching, seeding and planting.
 On accessible slopes, mulch shall be anchored or tracked with suitable equipment to anchor the mulch into the soil. On slopes that are inaccessible, a suitable binding agent shall be applied in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions to anchor the mulch. If nominated for use as a binding agent, bitumen emulsion shall be applied at a controlled rate (nominal 1 to 2 litres per square metre of surface) to match the soil moisture and site requirements.
 If available brush (rough cut site vegetation) may be laid along the slope to provide a uniform cover (thatch) over the soil surface. The brush shall be secured by mulch control netting, wire strands running across the slope and secured to regular fixed stakes, or equal method to prevent the brush from blowing away.
 8. PLANTING AND SEEDING
 It is important to allow lead-time for securing plants and any collection of seed or plant propagation. At least one year is recommended before the required works are due to begin.
 The propagation of plants and seed collection may be contracted out separately from the revegetation and landscaping works.
 The pre-treatment of seeds is necessary to improve germination and to assist to break dormancy. The requirements for pre-treatment should be nominated in Annexure 304B. If not nominated the Contractor shall be required to treat all species of seed with pretreatment as per best horticultural practices. In addition to smoke water, hard seeded species shall be treated by scarification or hot water treatment.
 A seeding rate should be specified within the design documentation. In the absence of this information, a default value of 4 kg/ha can be used.
 Hydro-mulch
 Unless specified otherwise in Annexure 304B, the hydro-mulch shall consist of water, cellulose fibre mulch, tacifier (e.g. Gluon240 applied at 200ltr to 400ltr /ha, polygon17 a powder applied at 20kg/ha or equal) and other materials (paper mache or bulking agent) as necessary to suit the size and location of the site area, the slope and soil and local weather conditions.
 Unless specified otherwise in Annexure 304B, the hydro-mulch shall be applied at a nominal rate of 200litres/ha. Rates can vary from up to 40,000 litres/ha in response to project site conditions.
 Soil conditions means that the application may involve several passes e.g. on clay soils, on sand batters.

 Page 53 of 63
 
 The critical measure is the depth applied. The number of applications may vary due to the conditions.
 9. WEED CONTROL
 Include any weed control requirements as part of Annexure 304B.
 The control or removal of unwanted vegetation (weed species) is critical to ensure that planting and seeding operations are effective. While eradication of all weed species may not be possible, the objective is to control and reduce weed populations and to prevent their spread within the road reserve. To make best use of available resources, a listing of the weed species that pose the greatest risk should be identified and the weed control initiatives to target these priority species. A weed control program must be developed for the contract area and implemented by the Contractor. Nominated weed species should not be limited to the species identified in the design process. The recommended approach is to require the Contractor to identify all weed species within the Contract area and to prepare a Weed Control Program and submit this to the Superintendent for approval prior to undertaking any works.
 10. PESTICIDES AND HERBICIDES
 The term `pesticide' as defined by the Department of Health (DoH) includes herbicides, fungicides and all other specific forms of `pest' control agents. Herbicides are used to control or remove the growth of unwanted vegetation. Also refer to the draft Main Roads environmental guideline on Water Protection. Approval to apply pesticides on road verges in proclaimed areas must be obtained from the DoE. In water catchment areas managed by the Water Corporation, mixing or spraying of pesticide must not occur:
  within 50m of other water courses where water is flowing.  within 50m of any visible natural or artificial pool or storage.  If rain is falling or is likely to occur within four hours following application.
 When herbicides are to be used in water catchment areas, the DoE or Water Corporation should be advised at least 3 weeks before the spraying programme. Details supplied should include location, type of herbicide, rate of application and date when work is planned.
 Advice on appropriate herbicide use within the project area (selective and or non selective, residual, timing etc.) should be sought from specialist in the area. A weed control plan should be prepared for the project area. Residual herbicides are generally not recommended for use within the road reserve. A sample general list of herbicides that may be nominated for a specific project is provided below:
 a) Glyphosate Biactive  at manufacturer's recommended rate (non selective).
 b) Lontrel  for broadleaf weeds at manufacturer's recommended rate.
 c) Verdict  or Fusilade  for narrow leaf grasses at manufacturer's recommended rate.

 11. BLEND AREAS The zone between all proposed and existing landscaping treatments shall be blended both visually and functionally. Blended areas are undertaken to:
 Reinstate an existing landscaping damaged by the road works;
 Extend the existing landscaping treatment into an adjoining area altered by the road works;
 Modify an existing landscaping treatment to integrate with the proposed landscaping.
 Where blend areas overlap private property, the nominal extent is 2 metres beyond the cadastral boundary or 2 metres beyond the limit of any road works, which have extended into the property. This work shall only proceed with the approval of the landowner. This work shall be undertaken at the contract rates submitted by the Contractor. The scope may be hard to define. A Provisional Sum should be allowed to cover any additional costs or extra treatments.

 10.2 Additionally, Clause 404.86 should be added to Contract Specific Requirements, which has the added benefit that the bulk of culvert contract documents may be reduced by not having to unnecessarily include SPECIFICATIONS 819 and 821.
 
 11. PLASTIC FLEXIBLE CULVERTS (Clause 404.87)
 11.1 Flexible pipes may be considered in remote locations where the cost of transport becomes prohibitive, due to their light weight, or where conditions are aggressive, due to their inert nature to most naturally occurring chemicals.
 
 11.2 Clause 404.87 should be added under Contract Specific Requirements where, the use of plastic flexible culverts, are permitted on a project.
 11.3 Note that Section 2.0 `Minimum Testing Frequency' within SPECIFICATION 201 Quality Systems, will need to have the product/process `Corrugated Metal Pipe' (under subsection 2.3 `Drainage') amended to read "'Plastic Flexible Pipe'.
 11.4 Unless otherwise recommended by the manufacturer, where plastic flexible culverts are to be used in ground conditions that would ordinarily be classified as `Aggressive` for concrete culverts, Clause 404A1 (Annexure A) should be amended to "NOT USED". This is because the materials used in plastic flexible culverts are typically inert in such conditions.
 11.5 Where in-situ concrete is proposed:
 a. N40 in-situ concrete used for pipe diameter with < 1500mm.
 b. N50 in-situ concrete used for pipe diameter with  1500mm
 
 11.6 Alternative products to those listed in Clause 404.87.03 shall not be used. Manufacturers of alternative products shall make a submission to MRWA's Structures Engineering Branch for acceptance and inclusion within the clause.

 WALL THICKNESS (Clause 405.08.04.3)
 
 1.1. Where Specification 404 CULVERTS (Annexure 404A) specifies that the in-situ ground conditions for Reinforced Concrete Pipe are "Aggressive" the minimum concrete cover to steel reinforcement shall be 20mm in accordance AS/NZS 4058. As such 900mm diameter liners should not be used in aggressive environment as the typical wall thickness does not allow 20mm cover to be achieved. In such circumstances 1050mm diameter liners should be specified instead.
 
 2.
 
 PRECAST CONCRETE LINERS (Clause 405.35)
 
 2.1. There is a practical limit as to the number and size of holes which can be safely punched into the walls of the liner to accommodate entry and exit drainage conduits without compromising wall strength. Where the manufacturer's published requirements differ to those shown on the Drawings then the Contractor shall use the more stringent requirements.
 
 3.
 
 DEWATERING (Clause 405.30.2
 
 3.1. Where the requirement for dewatering exists then Clause 204.94 in Specification 204  ENVIRONMENT (Specification 204 Guidance Notes) shall be added to the Contract Specific Requirements of that document.

 CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
 
 The following clauses are to be placed under the CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS, as required. After inserting the clause, change the clause number and heading to style "H2 SP" so it appears in the Table of Contents.
 
 1. RE-USEABLE REDUNDANT DRAINAGE STRUCTURES
 
 The following Clause concerns the removal and storage of re-usable redundant drainage structures. If required, Clause 405.91 should be added and Annexure 405A as shown below also needs to be inserted on a separate page following Clause 405.91 and completed:
 
 405.91 RE-USABLE REDUNDANT STRUCTURES
 
 1. Where redundant drainage structures are located under roadways, such structures shall be removed by the Contractor, and if deemed suitable for re-use by the Superintendent, shall be delivered to the storage area nominated in Annexure 405A.
 
 2. Damaged or unusable drainage structures shall be disposed of by the Contractor to the Contractors disposal site approved by the Superintendent.
 
 Damaged
 
 2. LOW STRENGTH INFILL FOR REDUNDANT STRUCTURES
 The practice of infilling redundant drainage structures with low strength infill should be discouraged as the locations of redundant structures are rarely monitored and subsequent service checks are not likely to show their location, resulting in unnecessary delays if exposed in future works. Should their removal not be possible, then Clause 404.92 below should be added:
 405.92 LOW STRENGTH INFILL
 1. Where detailed on the Drawings, redundant drainage structures shall be filled with low strength concrete infill in accordance with Specification 410 LOW STRENGTH INFILL.

 406.29 INSTALLATION OF GABIONS AND MATTRESSES
 
 1.
 
 The assembly and erection of the gabions and mattresses
 
 shall conform to the following and the manufacturer's recommendations.
 
 Prior to assembly, the wire mesh of the gabion or mattress shall be
 
 opened out flat on the ground and stretched as much as possible to
 
 remove all kinks and bends, and checked to make sure that all creases
 
 are in the correct positions for forming the box.
 
 Assembly
 
 2.
 
 The gabion or mattress shall be assembled individually by
 
 lifting the side and end panels into vertical position to form a rectangular
 
 box, ensuring that the tops of all four sides are level.
 
 Panels
 
 3.
 
 The four corners of the gabion or mattress box shall be wired
 
 together with lengths of lacing wire supplied. Starting at the top, the
 
 end of the wire shall be secured by twisting it around the selvedges and
 
 through each mesh in turn using alternate single and double loops. The
 
 wire at the bottom shall be secured with the lacing wire turned to the
 
 inside of the box on completion. The diaphragm panels shall also be
 
 secured in a similar fashion.
 
 Lacing
 
 4.
 
 The assembled empty gabion or mattress boxes shall be
 
 positioned in the structure. The end or side from which work is expected
 
 to proceed shall be secured either to completed work or by stakes driven
 
 into the ground at the corners. These stakes must be secure and reach
 
 at least to the top of the gabion or mattress.
 
 Staking
 
 5.
 
 For gabions, the opposite end or side of the box shall be
 
 stretched using crowbars or a small winch and secured top and bottom
 
 by stakes placed at the corners, fixed at the bottom and tied back at the
 
 top. Lacing to adjacent boxes and filling shall be carried out whilst
 
 gabion boxes are under tension.
 
 Gabion Stretching
 
 6.
 
 For mattresses, movement of the rockfill inside the cells,
 
 either due to gravity or flowing current, should be kept to a minimum.
 
 Mattresses on slopes shall be placed such that the long dimension lies
 
 up and down the slope i.e. internal diaphragms at right angles to the
 
 direction of the slope. In watercourses, the long dimension of the
 
 mattress should be aligned with the direction of flow i.e. internal
 
 diaphragms at right angles to the direction of flow. The boxes shall be
 
 wired together along all adjoining edges and at diaphragm points.
 
 Mattress Alignment
 
 7.
 
 The gabion boxes shall be filled one third full and horizontal
 
 interval bracing inserted (approximately 0.30m apart) to prevent
 
 excessive bulging and distortion of the completed structure. This
 
 procedure shall be repeated when the box is two thirds full. For both
 
 gabions and mattresses, final filling shall be to a level 25 to 50mm above
 
 their tops to allow for subsequent settlement.

 410.31 PLACEMENT
 1. Prior to the commencement of filling operations the Superintendent shall be provided with details of the proposed mix design and results of testing (e.g. site performance test/check) demonstrating conformance with the Specification.
 2. Pipes, culverts and other buried structures shall be filled with low strength infill strictly to the limits shown on the Drawings. To place, low strength materials, use a pump suitable for the type of void to be filled and its accessibility or other means acceptable to the Superintendent.
 3. Any formwork used to contain the infill shall be removed on completion of the works. The Contractor shall remove at its own cost any low strength infill placed outside these limits without damage to the surrounding permanent structure. Any damage resulting from this work shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the Superintendent.
 4. The filling of each section of pipe shall proceed from both ends. The job shall only be considered complete when the material is seen to flow out of the other end full to the soffit, i.e. the soffit of the pipe must be wet by the material. Where both ends of the pipe cannot be open, the LSI must be injected via a sacrificial hose inserted to the far end of the pipe being filled. The Superintendent shall be provided with details of the volume of low strength infill placed after each pour.

 USE OF LOW STRENGTH INFILL
 
 1.1. For redundant or disused pipes and associated drainage structures which are located under roadways or portions of roadways not scheduled for reconstruction, the use of a low strength infill is an acceptable alternative to removal and backfilling to avoid unnecessary destruction of an existing pavement.
 
 1.2. In such cases, existing culverts and drainage structures which may be treated in this way must be indicated on the Drawings. It would normally only apply to the smaller diameter (< 300 mm) pipes, culverts and associated drainage structures.

 4. PRINCIPAL SUPPLIED MATERIALS (refer Clause 501.91)
 4.1 Materials are normally required to be supplied by the Contractor. Where supply is by the Principal (for example, gravel in stockpiles), Clause 501.91 in the section CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS (or a suitably edited version of this clause) is applicable.
 4.2 Amend this clause as shown to indicate whether the material is supplied at a cost to the Contractor, or is supplied free of charge. Applying a charge may conserve material where there is a limited supply, but appropriate supervision and a suitable means of measurement must be established.
 4.3 Insert details of any other Principal supplied materials as required.
 5. OPTIONAL PAVEMENT MATERIALS (refer Clauses 501.92 to 501.94)
 5.1 The section PRODUCTS AND MATERIALS includes commonly used pavement materials. Other pavement materials should be included under CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS and selected as required.
 5.2 Pavement materials not listed should be researched and approved as required before inclusion.
 6. DRAINAGE LAYER (refer Clause 501.32
 6.1 GEOTEXTILE
 1. Where a drainage layer is required, it is usually constructed immediately below the lower Pavement Layer. 2. A Geotextile may or may not be required as part of the drainage layer. Typical details of Geotextile are as follows

 6.2 SAND FOR DRAINAGE LAYER
 1. Bassendean Sand is commonly used as a drainage layer in the Metro area, with the grading limits following Table 501A8. 2. Insert appropriate details of the specified drainage layer material.
 7. PAVEMENT COMPACTION
 7.1 Where a range is given for the minimum characteristic dry density ratio in Table 510 A1, the higher value in the range should be selected unless there is evidence that the Basecourse properties will be damaged by so doing (e.g. if a higher compactive effort causes breakdown of the stone and adversely affects the grading or the linear shrinkage of the Basecourse).
 A higher compactive effort will reduce the risk of post construction wheel path rutting under traffic loading. A more uniform Pavement Layer can be expected when a higher minimum characteristic dry density ratio is specified. To achieve the higher density, the Contractor will need to exercise greater control over the uniformity of the mixing and compaction processes (e.g. especially over the amount and uniformity of moisture in the Pavement Layer during compaction). 7.2 Cement stabilised or Lime Stabilised Basecourse must not be used under asphalt wearing courses unless approved by the Manager Materials Engineering.
 7.3 Refer to Engineering Road Note No. 8 for guidance, to augment engineering judgement and knowledge of local materials.
 7.4 Plastic pavement materials should be moist cured for at least 24 hours before compaction takes place if the in situ or imported Basecourse is in a dry condition. Refer Guidance Note 1.4
 8. DRYBACK OF PAVEMENT AND SUBGRADE LAYERS
 8.1 The dryback criterion of 85% for Basecourse with a spray seal surface is usually suitable however consideration should be given to adjusting the criterion, if required, to reduce aggregate embedment and the risk of subsequent seal flushing. The risk is higher when commercial vehicle numbers are high.
 9. DIEBACK CONTROL
 9.1 Insert as a CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT if dieback controls should be included in pavement construction.
 9.2 Refer to any general requirements shown in Specification 204 ENVIRONMENT.
 10. CEMENT STABILISED PAVEMENTS (refer Clause 501.30)
 10.1 Cement stabilisation can be applied to any Pavement Layer, but typically only to the Basecourse layer.
 10.2 If cement stabilisation of the Basecourse is specified (e.g. at floodways), determine the following and insert into Annexure 501A (in addition to required Compaction):
 
 Document No: DXX#XXXX Contract No: XXX/XX [Contract Name]
 
 Page 50 of 60
 
 Specification 501 Pavements  04/10110-04 Issued 29/06/2018
 a. Depth of stabilisation - typically 150mm to 200mm.
 b. Cement content - typical values are 1.0%, 1.5% or 2% by dry mass of the Basecourse material.
 c. The cement content required, will be determined by the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of the material when tested in accordance with WA 143.1. The UCS specimens shall be compacted using General Purpose (Type GP) cement, cured for seven (7) days in a controlled environment and immersed in water for four (4) hours prior to compression testing. The specimens are to be compacted at the specified density and 100% of OMC. The 7-day UCS must be in the range of 0.6  1.0MPa.
 10.3 The minimum practical spread rate that can be achieved by most cement spreaders is 3kg/m2, which equates to approximately 1% cement for a laterite gravel stabilised to a depth of 150mm.
 10.4 The mandatory use of padfoot rollers for initial compaction is recommended in the following circumstances:
 a. When the section length is 100m or more.
 b. The depth of material to be stabilised is 175mm or more.
 Padfoot rollers are more efficient in achieving density but trimming out the padfoot marks is difficult in short sections and those with coarse material that could tear the surface.
 Delete Clause 501.30.07.1 if padfoot rollers are not required.
 10.5 Check clause cross reference number "302.44.4"in Clause 501.30.07 is still current as any revision to Specification 302 could affect the clause numbering of that specification and is not automatically picked up in this specification
 11. LIME STABILISATION (refer Clause 501.95)
 11.1 If lime modification is specified, determine the following and insert into Annexure 501A (in addition to required compaction):
 a. Depth of stabilisation  (typically 150mm to 250mm).
 b. Lime content is determined by laboratory testing. Because lime varies in purity (depending on manufacture) and strength (depending on whether it is quicklime or hydrated lime), the optimum lime content must be expressed as a percentage of equivalent pure hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide) by dry mass of the pavement material
 11.2 The process for determining whether Lime modification is appropriate and the required % of pure hydrated Lime for pavement modification is;
 a. Refer to section 4.9 Preliminary Binder Selection of the Austroads Guide to Pavement Technology- Part - 4D: Stabilised Materials to determine if Lime is a suitable additive for the selected pavement material.
 b. Determine the UCS of the modified material in accordance with Main Roads Test Method WA 143.1. The test specimens are to be compacted at the specified density and 100% of OMC and must be 28 day cured.
 c. The optimum Lime content of the soil for modification produces a 28-day UCS in the range 0.6MPa to 1.0MPa.

 Specification 501 Pavements  04/10110-04 Issued 29/06/2018
 11.3 The minimum practical spread rate that can be achieved by most lime spreaders is 3kg/m2, which equates to approximately 1% lime for a laterite gravel stabilised to a depth of 150mm.
 11.4 The safety aspects of lime stabilisation are referred to in Clause 501.95.02.
 12. DURABILITY OF BASIC IGNEOUS ROCKS
 Tests (AS1141.26 & AS1141.29) have been included for the purpose of excluding material that has the potential to degrade in service when used as Sub-Base and Basecourse. The colour of the rocks may be green, grey or black, but the basaltic rocks that most commonly present a risk of degradation are often dark green. Standard classification and strength tests are not suitable to identify the presence of material prone to degradation. Vic Roads Code of Practice RC 500.00 provides additional guidance on this topic.
 13. HYDRATED CEMENT TREATED CRUSHED ROCK BASE (HCTCRB) (refer Clause 501.12)
 13.1 A Geotextile Reinforced Seal must be specified whenever HCTCRB Basecourse is used. The GRS must comprise a double/double seal (14mm/7mm with heavy grade fabric) in accordance with the requirements in Specification 503 or Specification 509 as applicable.
 The purpose of the GRS is to maintain a waterproof seal on the HCTCRB Basecourse. HCTCRB should not be specified for pavements with a sprayed seal wearing course or pavements at intersections.
 14. CRUSHED RECYCLED CONCRETE SUB-BASE (refer Clause 501.92)
 Crushed Recycled Concrete Sub-Base in accord with Clause 501.92 is suitable to be used as the Sub-Base layer for Full Depth Asphalt pavements. The CRC Sub-Base material specification is available from the Materials Engineering Branch. The CRC Sub-Base specification is generally only used in Alliance contracts, where the risk of contamination is jointly managed.
 15. RESILIENT MODULUS
 The basecourse vertical modulus adopted in the pavement design should be inserted in the relevant Table. Refer to the pavement design for the appropriate criterion. The criterion will typically be in the range 500 MPa  700 Mpa in accordance with Austroads Guide to Pavement Technology Part 2 guidance.
 16. RECLAIMED PAVEMENT SUB-BASE
 16.1 If it is likely that existing pavement material will be reused as Sub-Base compliance to the appropriate Sub-Base specifications is applicable.
 17. CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
 The following clauses are to be placed under the CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS, as required. After inserting the clause, change the clause number and heading to style "H2 SP" so it appears in the Table of Contents.
 501.91 PAVEMENT MATERIALS  PRINCIPAL SUPPLIED
 1. Where pavement materials are supplied by the Principal, details of such materials are provided in Specification 100 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS Annexure 101E.

 2. Rotary hoes and other implements normally used for agricultural work shall not be used. The stabilising machine shall also satisfy the following requirements:
 
 i. Be capable of producing a uniformly mixed material throughout the specified depth of the work.
 ii. Be equipped with a variable depth of cut control, and an accurate gauge to measure depth of cut which is readily visible to the operator.
 iii. Have provision for adding water automatically through a system comprising a pump, flow meter, variable control valve and full width spray bar. Each nozzle on the spray bar shall be fully and independently adjustable and the water pump shall have the capacity to supply a minimum of 900 litres per minute.
 
 501.95.04 PRELIMINARY TREATMENT
 
 1. It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to determine whether pre loosening and mixing of the in situ material is necessary.
 
 2. Under no circumstances shall the first loosening and mixing operation of the Pavement Layer exceed the final stabilised depth.
 
 501.95.05 SPREADING OF LIME
 
 1. Lime shall be spread uniformly at a controlled rate over the area to be stabilised using a suitable lime spreader.
 
 2. The lime stabilised Pavement Layer shall contain an average of not less than the equivalent percentage of hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide) as stated in Annexure 501A. The percentage stated is a percentage of the dry mass of the Pavement Layer material. The Contractor shall keep daily records of the amounts of lime used and actual spread rates achieved per section treated and shall make such records available to the Superintendent upon request.
 
 3. The actual spread rate of lime achieved shall be determined by either:
 
 i. placing three trays each of approximately one third of a square metre in area in front of the lime spreader and measuring the mass of lime deposited on the trays for each lot, or
 
 ii. by the use of an on-board electronic weigh scale system.
 
 4. The percentage lime (P%) shall be calculated thus:
 
 P = M x 100 A x T x MDD
 
 Where M =
 
 total mass of lime (kg) as determined by one of the following methods:
 a) on each tray b) on-board electronic weight scale system.

 5. The percentage lime determined for each tray in accordance with this clause shall be maintained within  10% by mass of the specified lime content throughout the stabilisation works.
 
 6. The use of method (b) in determining the values 'M' and 'A' is subject to satisfactory calibration of the measuring device and the production of associated certification in accordance with the Contractor's Quality System. Audits on this method shall be carried out using the measuring tray method.
 
 7. Once the lime has been spread, no other plant other than that needed for spreading, or for mixing and spreading the mixed material, shall be permitted to travel over the area to be stabilised.
 
 501.95.06 INCORPORATION OF LIME
 
 1. The spreading of lime shall not proceed when rain is imminent. The spread lime shall be incorporated into the Pavement Layer immediately following the spreading operation. All spread lime shall be incorporated into the Pavement Layer within the same working day. Lime shall not be spread when the prevailing wind velocity is sufficient to make the lime particles airborne.
 
 2. Cutting, pulverising, mixing, adding water and spreading of mixed material shall take place as a single operation within the stabilising machine.
 
 3. Cutting, pulverising, mixing, adding water and spreading of mixed material shall continue until the maximum size of all material (other than rock) is not greater than 25mm, and the lime and water are uniformly incorporated into the mixed material without streaks or pockets of lime.
 
 501.95.07 MOISTURE CONTENT
 
 1. Compaction shall be carried out at a moisture content at any point in the Lot that is within the range 90%  110% of the Optimum Moisture Content.
 
 2. The Contractor shall be responsible for achieving and maintaining the required moisture content by controlling the amount of water added during the mixing process within the stabilising machine.
 
 501.95.08 COMPACTION
 
 1. Compaction and trimming of the mixed material to shape and level shall be completed within the same working day that the lime is incorporated into the Pavement Layer. The mixed material shall be compacted to the Characteristic Dry Density Ratio as shown in Annexure 501A, or greater.

 2. Rework shall include any disturbance to the surface of the lime stabilized layer during trimming to meet shape or level requirements that is undertaken after the working day that the lime is incorporated into the Pavement Layer. The rework depth shall not be less than the full depth of the affected layer.
 501.95.10 CONSTRUCTION JOINTS
 1. When the stabilising work cannot be completed in one continuous operation, the Contractor shall provide construction joints at each discontinuity in the operation.
 2. Construction joints shall be made transverse to and/or parallel to the direction of the stabilising run, and shall be made just prior to the commencement of the next stabilising run.
 3. The joints shall be formed by cutting back into the compacted stabilised material to form a vertical face. The loose trimmed material shall be removed from the joint before the next section is mixed and compacted and shall be disposed of to the Contractor's spoil area.
 501.95.11 PRELIMINARY TRIAL
 1. The Contractor shall carry out a preliminary trial of the proposed stabilising operations. The trial shall determine:
 i. The effectiveness of the plant.

 503.44 APPLICATION OF COVER MATERIAL  BITUMEN SEALS
 503.44.01 AGGREGATE PRIMERSEALS AND SEALS
 1. General
 a. The aggregate shall be dry (containing no water) at the time of application and shall be uniformly spread over the sprayed area by means of a suitable type of mechanical spreader. The mechanical spreader shall be fitted with removable cut-off attachments to allow the aggregate spread width to match the required width on the pavement.

 2. BITUMINOUS SURFACING INTENT
 Clause 503.01.2 has been inserted to define the intended outcomes of applying a bituminous surfacing treatment. This specification includes a number of different types of treatment, as indicated within Clause 503.01.1. The critical intention will vary slightly from treatment to treatment. The requirement for a bituminous treatment to be "durable" is constant irrespective of the type, though the quantum will be different between a primerseal and a reseal for example.
 The three bullet points in this clause are the essential outcomes of the application of a bituminous surfacing treatment. If these outcomes are not met, then the treatment is not achieving the desired intention and further scrutiny should be applied to determine the cause for this failure. This might include such factors as design, preparation, application, and/or operational practices.
 3. GEOTEXTILE REINFORCED SEALS
 Insert details for a Geotextile Seal in Table 503C8. Refer to Austroads Report AP-T37/05 and Main Roads guideline 71-6-137 for guidance on the use and design of geotextile seals.
 4. AGGREGATE
 4.1. PRINCIPAL SUPPLIED AGGREGATE
 4.1.1. If screening of Principal-supplied aggregate is required, include Clause 503.91 as a Contract Specific Requirement.
 4.1.2. Insert any other requirements concerning Principal-supplied aggregate as necessary in Clause 503.92 as a further Contract Specific Requirement, e.g. .care of dumpsites:
 4.1.3. Provide aggregate spread rates. Base on test results where known calculated using the formula:
 Spread rate (m/m) = 900/Average Least Dimension (AS 1141.20.1)
 The provided rate should be adjusted in the field to give the correct stone mosaic.

 16mm
 
 to 90 m/m
 
 (Note: 5mm aggregate is neither intended nor expected to be spread as a single layer.)
 
 4.1.4. Provide rate of deduction to allow for the cost of wastage in $/m for overspreading aggregate. A typical value might be of the order of $50/m, and would represent the production cost of the aggregate.
 
 4.1.5. Nominate in Table 503.1 the type of precoat fluid to be used. Distillate precoat fluid is used for most hot bitumen or cutback bitumen sealing or primersealing. A bitumen based precoat fluid may be used where a higher level of initial adhesion is required such as geotextile seals.
 
 4.2. CONTRACTOR SUPPLIED AGGREGATE
 
 In the Conditions of Tender (currently Schedule L) include:
 
 a. an item to cover the Contractor's response to Clause 503.16.01.3 re source of Aggregate, and
 
 b. an item to cover the Contractor's response to Clause 503.13.1 re Adhesion Agent (cross referenced in the note to Table 503.6), and
 
 c. an item to cover the Contractor's response to Clause 503.33.07.2 re Aggregate Screen sizes.
 
 5. RESPONSIBILITY FOR SEAL DESIGN
 
 Amend Table 503C1 to show whether the Principal or Contractor is responsible for the design of sprayed seals and what types of seals.
 
 6. BITUMEN EMULSION APPLICATION (refer Clause 503.45)
 
 6.1. Where a double/double emulsion primerseal is used for a new pavement the typical treatment is:
 
 First Coat: 10mm crushed aggregate (usually Perth granite), BAR 0.9 litres/m @ 15C
 Second Coat: 5mm crushed aggregate (usually Perth granite), BAR 1.1 litres/m @ 15C
 Document No: DXX#XXXX Contract No: XXX/XX [Contract Name]
 
 Page 51 of 55
 
 Specification 503 Bituminous Surfacing  04/10111 Issued 05/02/2018
 6.2. Double/double emulsion seals using 14mm and 7mm sized aggregates should be applied using a 70% emulsion (CRS/170-70). CRS/170-60 (60% bitumen content) bitumen emulsion is far more liquid and less viscous than the 70% emulsion and will flow on the road at emulsion application rates in excess of 1.3 L/m2. This makes it problematic for spraying the first coat of a 14/7mm emulsion seal when binder run off will occur. The 70% emulsion allows an emulsion application rate of up to about 1.7-1.8 L/m2 before run off may occur. The direct application of CRS/170-70 on to a basecourse without a prime is not recommended as the increased viscosity of the 70% emulsion can impair the coating ability on the surface potentially leaving pinholes that facilitate moisture ingress into the basecourse.
 7. RUBBER SEALS
 7.1. Where a rubberised seal is used as a Stress Alleviating Membrane (SAM), a Stress Alleviating Membrane Interlayer (SAMI) or for waterproofing membrane on a bridge deck it is specified in Specification 509 POLYMER MODIFIED BITUMINOUS SURFACING.
 7.2. 5% rubber binder can be used in a GRS in lieu of Class 170 bitumen where the GRS is subject to large numbers of heavy vehicles. The use of 5% rubber binder in a GRS is specified in this document.
 8. ROLLING WITH STEEL WHEEL ROLLERS
 8.1. There is no reference to the use of steel wheel rollers in the standard specification. The use of steel rollers on seal/reseal works is not recommended particularly on softer aggregates such as granite due to the possibility of over-rolling and crushing the aggregate. Steel wheel rollers travel slower than multi tyred rollers and delay the rolling process.
 9. NOTES RE ANNEXURES
 9.1. ANNEXURE 503A SCHEDULE OF WORKS
 Use only if required (e.g. Minor Works sealing/resealing contract), and insert details on a road-by-road basis. This schedule is not normally required in Major Works, but could be adapted to suit if necessary. When Annexure 503A is NOT used, the text of Clause 503.01.3 and the title of Annexure 503A should be replaced with "NOT USED", while the table in Annexure 503A should also be deleted.
 9.2. ANNEXURE 503B COVER MATERIALS - PRINCIPAL SUPPLY
 Insert relevant details of Principal-supplied aggregate. Insert CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS into the text of the Specification as noted in Item 4 of these Notes.
 9.3. Annexure 503C Application Details
 Cutters should not be specified for inclusion in the binder blend of the first coat of a double/double seal, therefore the binder specified in Table 503C2 is 100% bitumen.
 10. MINOR WORKS CONTRACTS
 10.1. WORKING HOURS (Clause 503.93)
 Where sealing works are organised as a separate Minor Works contract, a Clause for Working Hours should be added in CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS if not

 GUIDANCE ON THE USE OF WEARING COURSE ASPHALT
 
 1.1 Main Roads document number 6706-04-154 Guide for Surfacing Type Selection provides guidance on the use of various types of asphalt surfacings in different scenarios and speed zones.
 
 2.
 
 10mm DENSE GRADED LATERITE ASPHALT (Refer Clause 504.26)
 
 2.1 Laterite asphalt shall be used for bus lanes, cycle lanes, medians or road shoulders where delineation is required. Laterite asphalt shall not be used for general traffic lanes.
 
 3.
 
 10mm OPEN GRADED ASPHALT
 
 3.1 For new construction or reconstruction works granite open graded asphalt shall be used for both the trafficked lanes and the break down lane or shoulder. Red coloured granite open graded asphalt shall not be used for any application.
 
 4.
 
 USE OF A MATERIAL TRANSFER VEHICLE
 
 4.1 The requirement to use a MTV has to be specified at Annexure 504C. MTVs facilitate continuous paving by having a truck come in contact with the MTV to empty its load whilst asphalt is transferred into the paver by conveyor. Removing contact between a truck and paver overcomes bumps from the stop/start of the paver and reduces the likelihood of mix segregation near the end of a truckload. The outcome is more uniform temperature of the asphalt which will result in improved and more uniform compaction, improved ride and less incidence of segregated areas of asphalt.
 
 MTVs are not suited to all asphalting applications as shown below. Where a MTV must be used includes:
 
  On a project where there will be high daily production outputs of asphalt, eg. widening of Tonkin and Leach Highways near Perth Airport (Gateway WA Project)
 
  Where there are long paving runs, eg Kwinana Fwy widening Roe to Armadale and Armadale to Russell

 Page 31 of 34
 
 Specification 504 Asphalt Wearing Course  04/10112 Issued 22/05/2017
 
  Where improved ride quality is required, eg. Great Eastern Hwy from Graham Farmer Fwy to Tonkin Hwy (City East Alliance)
 
  Where asphalt is to be placed in adverse weather conditions such as low temperatures or strong winds, eg Winter paving
 
  When paving thin layers of asphalt containing a polymer modified binder.
 
 MTVs may not be suited for the following scenarios:
 
  On a project where there will be small daily production outputs of asphalt, eg. small minor improvement works
 
  Where there are confined spaces
 
  Small areas of widening such as intersection channelisation including short turn pockets.
 
 5.
 
 MINOR WORKS CONTRACTS
 
 5.1 Where this document is used in a Minor Works contract with wearing course asphalt as the sole or primary work required, Authors should ensure that the following specifications are also included in the tender documentation:
 
 a. Specification 100 General Requirements
 
 b. Specification 604 Pavement Markings (if required)
 
 (Note: Current Minor Works tender documentation contains its own Quality, Traffic and OSH specifications.)
 
 5.2 CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS  include any details provided or required by the Principal, such as:
 
 i. (Setting Out information
 
 ii. Working Hours and Days (if not already included in the tender document)

 Sign Maintenance
 
 506.32 OPENING OF ROAD TO TRAFFIC
 
 1. Traffic shall not be allowed on the new work until the emulsion has broken and fully cured and the sprayed surface is able to withstand the action of traffic without picking-up of material. Where required, or where ordered by the Superintendent, ponding and excess binder shall be covered in accordance with Clause 506.44.
 
 Curing of Emulsion
 
 2. The Contractor shall be responsible for the cleaning of any vehicles resulting from noncompliance with this Clause.
 
 Damage to Vehicles
 
 3. All spraying is to be completed no later than 3:00 pm. This is to ensure that there is sufficient time after spraying and before sunset for the emulsion to penetrate the pavement and break before traffic is permitted on the newly sprayed works.
 
 Timing of Final Spray
 
 506.33 FAILURE TO COMPLY
 
 1. If within a reasonable time of receiving a request from the Superintendent to carry out the above requirements the Contractor fails to comply with these requirements, the Superintendent may take whatever steps he considers necessary to properly provide for the safety and/or convenience of traffic and the cleaning of any vehicles, including the hiring of plant and the employment of labour, and the cost of all such provision shall be charged to the Contractor, or shall be deducted from any payment due to the Contractor.

 Specification 506 Enrichment Seals  04/10114 Issued 23/05/2017
 
 506.42 SURFACE PREPARATION
 
 1.
 
 The Contractor shall carry out preparation of the existing bitumen
 
 surface by sweeping off all loose material on the existing surface prior to
 
 spraying.
 
 506.43 DILUTION
 
 1. The bitumen emulsion shall be diluted with water in the ratio 4:1 bitumen emulsion: water. The Contractor shall supply the water for dilution.
 
 2. Where dilution is carried out in a bulk tanker, the tanker load shall be circulated for 20 minutes after dilution and immediately prior to filling the sprayer. A further 5 minutes circulation shall be carried out in the sprayer immediately before spraying the emulsion.
 
 3. Where the dilution is carried out in the sprayer each sprayer load shall be circulated for 15 minutes after dilution and immediately before spraying the emulsion.
 
 506.44 APPLICATION
 
 1. Application shall take place only when the pavement temperature is between 15C and 45C. Binder shall not be applied if there is excessive wind or if rain is imminent.
 
 2. No setting out marks will be provided but the Contractor shall uniformly cover the pavement at the rates specified or ordered. The provisional application rates are detailed in Annexure 506A. Any changes to these application rates will be provided by the Superintendent on the day of spraying.
 
 3. Application rates shall be within 0.1 litres/m of those ordered. Any section under sprayed by more than 0.1 litres/m shall be resprayed in order to achieve the specified application rate. Where the total application rate is more than 0.1 litres/m greater than the ordered application rate, cover material, as specified in Clause 506.07, will be applied if so directed by the Superintendent.
 
 4. Half width spraying will be required on all two lane roads. The maximum length of an individual spray run shall be 2000 metres. The Superintendent may direct that a lesser maximum length shall apply due to road alignment and traffic constraints.
 
 5. Cover material as specified in Clause 506.07 shall be spread over any areas of excess or ponding of binder, sufficient to blind the bitumen and prevent pickup of material by traffic.
 
 6. Trial strips not exceeding 100 metres in length may be necessary to verify the application rates. Extra overlapping at the road centre and the closing of alternative nozzles in wheel tracks may be required.
 
 506.45 WORKS RECORDS

 SPECIFICATION FRAMEWORK
 
 This Specification is based on the model Specification published by AUSTROADS (1997). This publication is accompanied by a Guidelines document which should be referred to assist in mix selection and practice.
 
 2.
 
 STANDARD METHOD OF MEASUREMENT (SMM)
 
 Measurement and payment is based on the volume (in m3) of dry mineral aggregate used in completing the Works. Estimates of the quantities required for use in a Schedule of Rates may be based on an assumed thickness of slurry over the nominated area. This will depend on the nature of the works but for typical resurfacing works will be of the order of 1.5 times the nominal mix size.

 509.42 APPLICATION OF BINDER
 
 509.42.01 GENERAL
 
 1. The surface to be sealed shall be dry and no binder shall be applied during wet or rainy conditions, or when adverse weather conditions may prevail at any time during such work. When binder is applied and rain is forecast during the 24 hour period after application of the seal the Contractor shall be responsible for any damage to or defects in the seal and action and cost to maintain or repair the seal. No binder shall be applied whilst the
 pavement surface temperature is less than 20C.
 
 2. The Contractor shall provide the Superintendent with safe and convenient access to the sprayer at all times for checking the volume before and after spraying by means of the dipstick.
 
 509.42.02 APPLICATION RATE
 
 1. The binder application rate (BAR) for tender purposes shall be as detailed in Annexure 509C. Where adjustments to the binder application rates in excess of 7.5 percent of the rates detailed in Annexure 509C are directed by the Superintendent, then changes to the Contractor's rates for sealing shall be made as follows:
 
 URN = URC + ( ARO - ARC)L
 
 Where :
 
 URN = New Rate for polymer modified binder treatment ($ per m2)
 
 URC = Contracted rate for polymer modified binder treatment as applicable ($ per m2)
 
 ARO = Ordered binder application rate (Litres per m2)
 
 ARC = Contracted binder application rate in Annexure (Litres per m2)
 
 L
 
 = Rate per litre for variation in the Schedule of Rates ($ per litre)
 
 Adjustments made under this clause shall be made prior to any adjustments that are due to conditional acceptance.
 
 2. The actual BAR at 15C shall be calculated from the quantity of binder sprayed and the actual area covered as measured on the ground.
 
 3. On sections where the actual binder application rate differs from the ordered application rate and the work is deemed to be non-conforming, refer to Clause 509.53 ("Non Conformance in Binder Application").
 
 509.42.03 VOLUME CONVERSION
 
 1. Table 509.7 gives factors to be used when converting binder volumes or spray rates at temperatures other than 15C to volumes or spray rates at 15C or vice versa. Adjustment shall be made using the following formulae:

 2. The Superintendent may order additional rolling and drag brooming and such additional work shall be paid at Daywork rates.
 3. For double double seals, the rolling shall comply with the requirements of this clause for each coat of the seal. Any aggregate not incorporated in the first coat of the seal shall be removed in such a manner as to prevent removal of aggregate embedded in the first coat. Any damage to the first coat shall be repaired by the Contractor at no cost to the Principal prior to spraying the binder for the second coat.
 509.43.03 SURFACE SWEEPING
 1. Any loose cover material not incorporated in the seal after the completion of rolling shall be swept off the sealed surface to beyond the outer edge of each shoulder without damage to the seal, shoulder or guideposts, and shall then be dispersed such that no windrows of swept material remain.
 2. Where the roadway to be sealed is kerbed, the excess cover material may be swept hard against the kerb during interim sweeping operations but shall be picked up and removed during the final sweeping.

 3. The initial sweeping shall be carried out prior to the completion of the day's work. A second sweeping shall be carried out at the commencement of the following day's work. The Contractor shall carry out subsequent sweepings as necessary for the following seven (7) days to ensure that no loose stones remain on the road surface. All loose aggregate shall be swept clear of the sealed surface, off the shoulder and past the line of the guide posts.
 
 4. The Contractor shall install "LOOSE STONE" signs and other temporary traffic management signs in accordance with Specification 202 TRAFFIC. The signs shall remain in place on each section of the Works for the following seven (7) days after completion of sealing.

 509.52 NONCONFORMING TEST RESULTS
 
 1. If defects occur in the surfacing in any way, either in part or in full, attributable to binder for which test results are non-conforming, then within 60 days of completion of the works on which that binder was used, the Superintendent may direct the Contractor to take remedial action to repair or replace any defective sections of work. Any remedial action so directed will be at no cost to the Principal.
 
 2. The Superintendent may consider not making payment to the Contractor for the Schedule of Rates item for binder supply and delivery related to that delivery for 60 days after the work has been completed, plus any subsequent time thereafter if remedial work is outstanding.
 
 3. The Superintendent may initiate testing of other samples retained but not previously tested.
 
 509.53 NON-CONFORMANCE IN BINDER APPLICATION
 
 1. The actual binder application rate at 15C on a spray run shall be deemed to be conforming to the ordered binder application rate if it falls within the tolerances given in Table 509.10 for Polymer Modified Bituminous Surfacings.
 
 2. Where the actual binder application rate at 15C on a spray run differs from the ordered rate, the Quality Level shall be deemed to be either a non-conformance or one of a range of conditional conformance levels, depending on the difference between the actual binder application rate and the ordered binder application rate. The tolerances applicable to conditional conformance are given in Table 509.10, and a Pay Factor shall be applied for work at the corresponding conformance levels. The Pay Factor applied will reflect the lower level of serviceability of conditionally conforming sprayed bituminous work.
 
 3. Where sprayed work is deemed non-conforming, the Contractor shall apply corrective action subject to the procedures contained in the Quality System Specification.
 
 4. No payment shall be made for binder sprayed outside the 50mm margin specified in Clause 509.42.04.

 2. BITUMINOUS SURFACING INTENT
 
 Clause 509.01.2 has been inserted to define the intended outcomes of applying a bituminous surfacing treatment. This specification includes a number of different types of treatment, as indicated within Clause 509.01.1. The critical intention will vary slightly from treatment to treatment. The requirement for a bituminous treatment to be "durable" is constant irrespective of the type.
 
 Document No: DXX#XXXX Contract No: XXX/XX [Contract Name]
 
 Page 36 of 42
 
 Specification 509 Polymer Modified Bituminous Surfacing  06/2852 Issued 05/02/2018
 
 The three bullet points in this clause are the essential outcomes of the application of a bituminous surfacing treatment. If these outcomes are not met, then the treatment is not achieving the desired intention and further scrutiny should be applied to determine the cause for this failure. This might include such factors as design, preparation, application, and/or operational practices.
 
 3. AGGREGATE
 
 3.1 PRINCIPAL SUPPLIED AGGREGATE (Clause 509.91)
 
 3.1.1 If screening of Principal-supplied aggregate is required, include Clause 509.91 in CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.
 
 3.1.2 Insert any other requirements concerning Principal-supplied aggregate as necessary in CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS, e.g. care of dumpsites (Clause 509.92).
 
 3.1.3 Provide aggregate spread rates. Based on test results where known calculated using the formula:
 
 Spread rate (m/m) = 900/Average Least Dimension (ALD)
 
 adjusted to increase the amount of aggregate per m for SAM and SAMI treatments by 10%, i.e. Spread rate = 900/1.1ALD.
 
 The provided rate should be adjusted in the field to give the correct stone mosaic. Typical values are:
 
 7mm
 
 200 to 250 m/m
 
 10mm
 
 140 to 170 m/m
 
 14mm
 
 90 to 120 m/m
 
 16mm
 
 65 to 90 m/m
 
 20mm
 
 50 to 70 m/m
 
 3.1.4 Provide rate of deduction to allow for the cost of wastage in $/m for over-spreading aggregate. A typical value might be of the order of $50/m, and would represent the production cost of the aggregate.
 
 3.2 CONTRACTOR SUPPLIED AGGREGATE
 
 In Schedule L of the Conditions of Tender, include an item to cover the Contractor's response to clause 509.16(3) resource of aggregate.
 
 3.3
 
 AGGREGATE SIZE
 
 3.3.1
 
 For bridge deck waterproofing membranes use 5mm aggregate with a S45R binder or
 
 7mm aggregate with a S25E binder.
 
 3.3.2
 
 For a Stress Alleviating Membrane (SAM) seal the nominal aggregate size will typically
 
 vary between 10mm to 14mm.
 
 3.3.3
 
 For a Stress Alleviating Membrane Interlayer (SAMI) seal the nominal size of
 
 aggregate shall be 10mm.
 
 Document No: DXX#XXXX Contract No: XXX/XX [Contract Name]
 
 Page 37 of 42
 
 Specification 509 Polymer Modified Bituminous Surfacing  06/2852 Issued 05/02/2018
 
 3.3.4
 
 For an enhanced aggregate retention seal the nominal size is that which would have
 
 been used for a seal using Class 170 bitumen.
 
 3.3.5
 
 For a double double seal the stone size in the second coat is of the order of about half
 
 the size of the stone in the first coat where the larger sized stone is applied first. Typical
 
 applications are 14/7mm which can be 14/10mm if 7mm aggregate supply is difficult, however the
 
 control of spreading the 14mm stone has to be managed. A 14/10mm double double seal is not
 
 recommended unless experienced Main Roads supervision is on site.
 
 Larger combinations of 16/7mm, 16/10mm or 20/10mm would be used as an extreme treatment to regain surface texture. The 16mm sized aggregate is difficult to procure and a Contractor needs a good lead time to procure the stone. An option is for a region to get its Materials Manager to liaise with quarries on availability. The use of 20mm sized aggregate should not happen without discussion with the Materials Engineering Branch first as this is a very large sized stone that will result in a hungry surface texture which will be uncomfortable for some road users. Neither 16mm, or 20mm aggregate is to be used for single coat seals as the stones will become large missiles if dislodged by high speed traffic.
 
 4. RESPONSIBILITY FOR SEAL DESIGN
 Amend Table 509C1 to show whether the Principal or Contractor is responsible for the design of sprayed seals.
 
 5. ROLLING
 
 5.1 STEEL WHEELED ROLLERS
 
 There is no reference to the use of steel wheel rollers in the standard specification. The use of steel rollers on seal/reseal works is not recommended particularly on softer aggregates such as granite due to the possibility of over-rolling and crushing the aggregate.
 
 5.2 ROLLER SIZE
 
 Table 509.9 requires that the size of rollers be specified by deleting one of two rows showing roller size. For sprayed seals that will remain as so for their service life it is important to achieve the best embedment and alignment of the sealing aggregate at the time of application. For seals or reseals with a service life to be beyond 1-2 years heavier rollers with a minimum mass of 18 tonnes must be used. For seals that may not be trafficked, such as SAMI seals under asphalt or bridge deck waterproofing membranes to be covered with asphalt smaller sized roller s of at least 11 tonne mass are acceptable. The use of the 11 tonne rollers can be acceptable also for initial seals (primerseals etc.) with a trafficked lifetime of no more than 1-2 years.
 
 6. NOTES RE ANNEXURES
 
 6.1 ANNEXURE 509A SCHEDULE OF WORKS
 
 Use only if required (e.g. Minor Works sealing/resealing contract), and insert details on a road-by-road basis including the type of treatment as shown in Table 509C1 or 509C2. This schedule is not normally required in Major Works, but could be adapted to suit if necessary. When Annexure 509A is NOT used, the text of Clause 509.01.3 and the title of Annexure 509A should be replaced with "NOT USED", while the table in Annexure 509A should also be deleted.

 7. MINOR WORKS CONTRACTS 7.1 WORKING HOURS (CLAUSE 509.93)
 Where sealing works are organised as a separate Minor Works contract, a Clause for Working Hours should be added in CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS if not already covered elsewhere (e.g. in the Conditions of Contract). The hours stated here are typical  vary to suit the conditions, particularly in heavily trafficked areas. 7.2 CLEARING (CLAUSE 509.94) Add this Clause if required.

 4. Rollers shall be kept in continuous operation as much as practicable and in such a manner that all parts of the pavement receive substantially equal compaction. In the event of a delay in the laying operation, rolling is to be carried out as close as practicable to the paving machine. Rollers shall not be parked on work carried out the same day.
 5. The number of rollers on site shall be commensurate with the rate of supply of asphalt and the output of the paving machine.
 6. All joints must be filled and edges adjacent to kerbing and such other hand work as may be necessary must be rolled with a suitable pedestrian type roller.
 7. At places not accessible to the roller, thorough compaction must be ensured by means of hot tampers and at all joints with structures the surface mixture must be effectively sealed.
 8. The Contractor shall ensure the protection of services and property from deterioration or damage due to the works.
 9. Finish rolling shall be carried out while the material is still warm enough for the removal of tyre marks. Steel wheeled rollers shall be used

 1.
 
 USE OF A MATERIAL TRANSFER VEHICLE
 
 1.1 The requirement to use a MTV has to be specified at Annexure 510B. MTVs facilitate continuous paving by having a truck come in contact with the MTV to empty its load whilst asphalt is transferred into the paver by conveyor. Removing contact between a truck and paver overcomes bumps from the stop/start of the paver and reduces the likelihood of mix segregation near the end of a truckload. The outcome is more uniform temperature of the asphalt which will result in improved and more uniform compaction, improved ride and less incidence of segregated areas of asphalt.
 
 MTVs are not suited to all asphalting applications as shown below. Where a MTV must be used includes:
  On a project where there will be high daily production outputs of asphalt, eg. widening of Tonkin and Leach Highways near Perth Airport (Gateway WA Project)
  Where there are long paving runs, e.g. Kwinana Fwy widening Roe to Armadale and Armadale to Russell
  Where improved ride quality is required, e.g. Great Eastern Hwy from Graham Farmer Fwy to Tonkin Hwy (City East Alliance)
  Where asphalt is to be placed in adverse weather conditions such as low temperatures or strong winds, e.g. Winter paving
  When paving thin layers of asphalt containing a polymer modified binder.
 
 MTVs may not be suited for the following scenarios:
  On a project where there will be small daily production outputs of asphalt, e.g. small minor improvement works
  Where there are confined spaces
  Small areas of widening such as intersection channelisation including short turn pockets.

 2.
 
 SEAL ON ASPHALT INTERMEDIATE COURSE
 
 2.1 The aim of the seal is to waterproof the surface of the uppermost layer of the 14mm asphalt intermediate course. Details of the binder, aggregate type, binder application rate and aggregate spread rate should be included in Specification 503 or 509 as appropriate. The amount of binder applied will dictate how effective the seal will be at waterproofing the surface.
 
 Single coat seals using 5mm and 7mm cover aggregate will have low binder application rates and will not provide sufficient waterproofing, therefore the smallest size aggregate specified for a single coat seal is 10mm nominal size applied to S35E modified binder at the following application rate:
 
 10mm single coat seal using S35E
 
 Binder Application Rate @ 15C (L/m2)
 1.4
 
 Aggregate Spread Rate (m2/m3)
 150
 
 Where an emulsified binder is used it is not practical to apply the seal as a single coat of 10mm aggregate. The specification requires that where an emulsion seal is to be applied over the 14mm intermediate course it has to be a 10/5mm two coat seal.
 
 1st coat - 10mm aggregate
 2nd coat  5mm aggregate

 511.06.01 GENERAL
 1. All bitumen used or for manufacturing cutback bitumen, polymer modified bitumen, multigrade bitumen or bitumen emulsion shall be a straight run, slightly blown or blended product prepared by distillation from crude bituminous base oils. The bitumen shall be homogeneous. It shall not foam when heated to 205C. The formation of a thin layer of bubbles will not be regarded as foaming. Bitumen shall be sampled in accordance with WA 700.1.
 2. Where Class 320 or Class 600 bitumen is produced by the blending of a low and high viscosity bitumen the following process shall be completed to verify conformance of the blend formulation
  The Viscosity at 60C and other properties as required of the low and high viscosity bitumen shall be determined.
  A blend formulation shall be determined to manufacture Class 320 or Class 600 bitumen.
  The blend formulation shall be assigned a unique identifier.
  A unique formulation shall be applicable to the batch of each of the two, or more, constituent materials used to manufacture the Class 320 or Class 600 bitumen.
  When a blend formulation is determined a laboratory or plant batch shall be manufactured. The batch shall be tested for all properties shown in Specification 201. Manufacture of Class 320 or Class 600 bitumen using the new blend formulation shall not be undertaken until testing confirms the blend complies to all specified requirements.
  Bitumen manufactured using the blend formulation shall be sampled and tested for Viscosity at 60C at the frequency in Specification 201 QUALITY SYSTEMS.
  When a batch of one of the constituent materials changes a new blend formulation shall be determined.

 511.06.03 BITUMEN DURABILITY
 1. In addition to the properties specified in Table 511.1 Class 170 bitumen shall conform to the following requirements at the source of initial supply within Western Australia. The Rolling Average Durability Value shall be 9 days or greater. The method for determining the Monthly Average Durability Value is detailed in the Clauses 511.06.03 (a) and (b) based on the source of the bitumen.
 a. Locally Produced Bitumen
 (i) The frequency of testing Class 170 bitumen to determine the Durability Value shall be at least one batch of bitumen per month.
 (ii) The rolling average is the mean of all durability values reported during the previous 12 calendar months including values reported by both the bitumen supplier and Main Roads Western Australia. The rolling average value shall be calculated on the first day of each month by determining the average of ALL durability values reported during the preceding 12 calendar months. The average is the sum of all of the durability values divided by the number of reported values during the 12 month period.

 Specification 511 Materials for Bituminous Materials  10/4287 Issued 23/05/2017
 (iii) The Durability Values used to determine the Rolling Average Durability Value must be traceable to batches of Class 170 bitumen. The rolling average shall be determined on the first day of each month as a single value rounded to the nearest 0.1 day.
 b. Bitumen Produced Outside of Western Australia
 Where supply is from a bulk storage depot with bitumen sourced from outside of Western Australia, at least one sample shall be taken from any delivery to the bulk depot. The sample shall be tested in full to demonstrate compliance with the properties shown in Table 511.1 including a durability test. A Rolling Average Durability Value shall be determined for each bulk storage depot.

 601.12 FLAT ALUMINIUM AND STEEL SHEET SIGNS  BRACED
 601.12.01 SHEET SIZE AND JOINT LIMITATIONS
 1. Flat sheet signs that cannot be manufactured from a single sheet of material and which exceed 2400mm in length, but do not exceed 1200mm in height, shall be manufactured from the least number of sheets possible.
 2. Flat sheet signs that cannot be manufactured from a single sheet of material and which are greater than 2400mm in length may be fabricated as single multi-piece signs using vertical joining of either 600mm, 900mm or 1200mm wide sheets and least number of sheets possible.
 3. Flat sheet signs that cannot be manufactured from a single sheet of material and which are greater than 1200mm in height may be fabricated in horizontal modules with each module using the least number of sheets possible. All horizontal joints shall be by using an approved interlocking stiffener system equivalent to types specified in Clause 601.12.03.
 601.12.02 JOINTS
 (i) General
 1. Joints shall be located so as to minimise the amount of legend directly over the joint.
 2. Legend and background on either side of a joint shall be colour matched.
 (ii) Horizontal Joints
 1. The top edge of a module that is to join the bottom edge of another module shall have a type A1, B1 or C1 aluminium stiffener attached, as specified in Clause 601.12.03. The bottom edge of a module that is to join the top edge of another module shall have a "Z" section stiffener attached, as specified in Clause 601.12.03. The aluminium stiffeners shall be attached to the aluminium or steel sheet by a single row of evenly spaced rivets, or other fixings as specified in Clause 601.12.05.
 2. As an alternative to the horizontal joint constructed in accordance with the above clause, horizontal joints may be constructed using Type A, Type B or Type C stiffeners together with a sign alignment bracket as detailed on Drawing No. 200831-0017, provided the maximum spacing of the stiffeners is less than 450mm. The maximum spacing of the alignment bracket should be 450mm.

 Specification 601 Signs  04/10118 Issued 01/06/2018
 
 (iii) Vertical Joints
 
 1. Before vertical joints are constructed, the adjoining sheets shall be painted or covered with reflective sheeting. Joints shall be covered with a backing strip of the same metal type as the sign, 60  5mm wide, terminating 5  5mm short of the edge of the sign and discontinued at each horizontal stiffening section with a gap not exceeding 5mm. The backing strip for a joint may be omitted if the calculated length of the strip is less than 120mm. The backing strip shall be attached to each aluminium sheet by a single row of evenly spaced rivets, or by other approved fixings as specified in Clause 601.12.05. The resultant gap between two sheets so butted shall not at any point exceed 1.5mm.
 
 2. An approved joining tape may be used as an alternative method of constructing a joint: the backing strip is to be fixed to the sign by 12 mm wide Very High Bond (VHB) joining strips on both sides of the joint, and running along the full length of the backing strip. Such an approved tape is 3M VHB tape, which shall be used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
 
 3. For large gantry single sign spanning across more than one lane, or other very large signs, sign panels may be assembled on site in pieces to reduce the difficulty of handling and erecting. The vertical joints along the full height of the sign shall be formed using pre-installed aluminium angles (25 x 25 x 3mm) in accordance with Drawing No. 201431-0032. The angles shall be bolted together with a galvanised M6 bolt and nut at 500mm spacing with equal distances from sign edges on both sides.
 
 601.12.03 EXTRUDED ALUMINIUM STIFFENERS
 
 1. Type A, Type B, Type C, Type A1, Type B1, Type C1 and Type Z stiffeners are detailed on Drawing No 8820-354. They shall be affixed to the rear of a sign. Type A, Type B, Type C, Type A1, Type B1 and Type C1 stiffeners shall be affixed at interval specified on the sign drawings and "Z" stiffeners shall be used to brace the signs. Where horizontal alignment brackets are used to brace the signs instead of "Z" stiffeners in terms of Clause 601.12.02(ii)2, maximum spacing shall be 450mm.
 
 2. Type A, Type B, Type C, Type A1, Type B1, Type C1 and Type Z stiffeners shall be extruded from aluminium type 6063-T5 in accordance with AS/NZS 1866.
 
 3. Stiffeners attached to signs less than or equal to
 
 6 500mm in length
 
 shall be a continuous length of extrusion not joined in any way. Where
 
 stiffeners longer than 6 500mm are required and the sign is to be
 
 manufactured as a single continuous horizontal unit and continuous lengths
 
 of extrusion are not available, lengths of stiffener extrusion may be joined.
 
 4. The ends of the extrusions to be joined shall be machined to facilitate a general purpose full penetration butt weld and the extrusions shall be butt welded together. Extended stiffeners shall be attached with the connections staggered, so that the join in two adjacent stiffeners is separated by a distance exceeding 2m.
 
 5. Stiffeners shall be attached to the aluminium or steel sheet by a single row of evenly spaced rivets, or other fixings as specified in Clause 601.12.05.

 7. If an approved self-locking taper is used for installing the sign post, the footing, sleeves and bases for the installation of the sign post shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation.
 601.43.05 ERECTION
 1. Once signs have been transported to the road site, they should not be laid flat on the ground. Laying signs flat can result in damage to the reflective face through direct contact with the ground.
 2. When attaching signs to posts, all connecting bolts should be tightened using offset spanners, not socket wrenches. The use of offset spanners minimise tool and hand contact with the sign face and avoids scratching or the surface, as well as allowing the extent of tightening to be observed. Only one end of the nut and bolt should be tightened, preferably tightened from the rear of the sign.
 3. Tightening from both sides can transfer stress into the top film of reflective sheeting resulting in permanent pinwheel style wrinkles. Avoid over tightening the connecting bolts as this can cause specular glare from dimples on the sign face.
 4. Nylon washers shall be used between connecting bolt heads and the sign face to protect the reflective sheeting from the twisting action of the bolt heads.
 5. A circle of diameter slightly larger than the bolt head may be scored in the reflective sign face around the bolt hole to minimise any fine cracking that may inadvertently occur during bolt tightening.
 6. When erecting large guide and information signs, care must be taken to prevent lifting ropes, cables and chains from contacting the sign surface. These can cause permanent visible damage.
 7. After installation and before leaving the road site, inspect all signs to see that they have not been damaged during erection and are free of oil and dirt residue from fingers and tools.
 601.43.06 TRAFFIC ISLANDS

 TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE OF SIGNS
 601.61 TRANSPORTATION
 1. Traffic signs are intended to communicate information to the road user in a clear and concise manner.
 2. This can only be accomplished if the surface of the sign is free of damage, abrasion, dirt, oil or other markings causing loss of legibility. These problems are especially severe when dealing with reflective material since night-time legibility is directly related to the quality and clarity of the reflective surface.
 3. This guide serves to highlight the important aspects of correct reflective sign storage and handling and is designed to be used by sign manufacturers, sign users and erectors.
 4. All finished signs should be handled, transported and stored to prevent damage to the sign face or other components. Signs should be stored vertically with their edges clear of the ground and in such a manner that the sign faces are not scuffed or marked, making use of protruding stiffening members where possible.
 5. Back to back storage of signs is permitted, but pressure must not be transferred onto a sign face by any other sign or sign support.
 
 Document No: DXX#XXXX Contract No: XXX/XX [Contract Name]
 
 Page 34 of 62
 
 Specification 601 Signs  04/10118 Issued 01/06/2018
 6. When transporting signs by truck or trailer, it is imperative that signs be securely braced vertically and adequately supported and secured to avoid damage due to scuffing, abrasion and load shifting.
 7. Large guide and information signs should be braced using wooden stiffeners attached to the extensions at the back of the sign and transported with the stiffeners in place to avoid buckling and rivet popping.
 601.62 INDOOR STORAGE
 1. Signs should be preferably stored indoors. Signs required to be stored outdoors must have the packaging removed and be stored so as to permit free air circulation and normal moisture evaporation. Moisture must be prevented from remaining in contact with the face of the sign at all times. Packaging that has become wet or damp must be removed immediately and the signs permitted to dry completely. Steps need to be taken to ensure that high temperature and high humidity conditions do not occur in either indoor or outdoor storage.
 601.63 OUTDOOR STORAGE
 1. Signs stored outdoors shall be unwrapped from their transport packaging and stored upright on edge using wooden battens on the floor or as vertical supports, or both.
 2. Signs stored outdoors, especially large guide or information signs, should be stored using a racking system that will provide vertical support for the stored signs that will avoid pressure points on sign faces and allow adequate air circulation between sign faces to prevent a build-up of moisture.
 601.64 SIGN COVERING
 1. Covering signs is not good general practice due to the damage that can be caused to the sign face through the interaction of environmental conditions.
 2. If it is necessary to cover a sign face temporarily after erection, caution must be exercised as some coverings may cause permanent damage to the sign face following exposure to moisture and sunlight. Some porous materials have been used successfully for limited periods by folding the material over the sign and securing it at the back of the sign. At the same time the material needs to have sufficient opacity to prevent the reflective face of the sign showing through at night.
 3. Covering signs with paper or plastic materials, especially black, is forbidden as it is known that these materials are responsible for severe and permanent damage within 24 hours as a consequence of the high temperatures and humidity conditions that can be generated during entrapment.
 4. Avoid the use of ropes, wire fasteners or strapping that may abrade the sign surface. Do not apply tape to the sign race because sunlight will cause it to bond permanently. Masking or application tape must be removed prior to exposure to sunlight.
 5. Some specially formulated low tack pressure sensitive films are available that are suitable to mask signs. For specific details on use refer to technical literature available from the manufacturer of the retro-reflective sheeting.

 SIGN MAINTENANCE
 601.71 SIGN MAINTENANCE
 601.71.01 GENERAL
 1. All materials and application processes used for the maintenance of signs shall comply with this Specification.
 2. The level of service of all signs shall not fall below the minimum performance criteria as specified in Clause 601.71.06.
 601.71.02 SIGN REPLACEMENT
 1. Signs to be replaced shall be removed in accordance with Clause 601.51.
 2. Replacement signs shall be attached to the post using fixings manufactured in accordance with Clause 601.36 and be level as measured by a spirit level.
 3. The replacement of signs shall be carried out in a single operation to ensure a minimum length of time during which the signs are not in use.
 601.71.03 SIGN REMOVAL
 1. Sign removal, sign post removal and surface reinstatement shall be in accordance with Clauses 601.51 to 601.53.
 601.71.04 SIGN CLEANING
 1. Traffic signs shall be cleaned without damage to the sign face and legend.
 2. Traffic signs shall be cleaned to remove all dust, grime and other loose or foreign material from the sign face, legend and rear of sign panel.
 3. Typical cleaning methods include washing using a mild detergent agent mixed in water with soft bristle brooms or brushes and rinsing with potable water. The sign surface shall be free from streaks after washing.
 4. Graffiti shall be removed in accordance with the paint, sheeting or protective overlay sheeting manufacturer's instructions.
 5. The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring the compatibility of the proposed cleaning method and medium without injurious effect to the sign, sign face and legend. Traffic signs damaged by the Contractor's cleaning works shall be rectified at no cost to the Principal.
 6. For maximum performance, signs should be kept clean and free from dirt, road tar, oil, bituminous material and mulch. Primarily this means cleaning the surface of the reflective sheeting - the essential characteristic of a sign.

 Specification 601 Signs  04/10118 Issued 01/06/2018
 7. A wet, detergent type, non-abrasive cleaner suitable for high quality paint surfaces is recommended. The cleaner must also be free or strong aromatic solvents or alcohols and be chemically neutral (i.e. pH of around 7.0). Following use of any cleaning agent, the sign surface must be thoroughly and immediately rinsed with clean water. In all cleaning operations, care should be taken not to abrade the sign by use of stiff-bristle brushes or by unnecessary scrubbing.
 601.71.05 NORMAL CLEANING PROCEDURE
 1. Flush the surface with clean water to remove loose, dirt particles. A squeeze (or triggered) hose nozzle is convenient for this purpose.
 2. Wash the sign face with a rag or sponge using detergent or any of several suitable commercial cleaners. Wash thoroughly from the top down. Once suds have been applied, keep a steady stream of water flowing on the sign face to wash away dirt particles.
 3. Rinse the entire sign face with clean water, and allow the sign to drain dry.
 4. Take extreme care in cleaning screened sign faces since some cleaning solvents may damage the screen printed area. Use a mild solvent such as mineral spirits. Follow with detergent and water, then rinse with clean water. Do not use high pressure sprayers. Do not direct sprays at sign face edges.
 601.71.06 PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
 A) Colour Fade or Change
 1. When blue, brown or green signs are viewed under either daytime or night time conditions, the perceived colour shall be that commonly associated with that designated colour, that is, there shall be no degradation of appearance that would allow a sign using one of these colours to be confused with either of the other colours.
 B) Retro-Reflectivity and Luminance
 1. The retro-reflectivity shall be measured in accordance with AS 1906.1 Appendix A at an observation angle of 0.2o and at an entrance angle of 4o The value must be an average of five readings equally spaced across the width of larger signs or within the area of smaller signs and shall be greater than the minimum value specified in Table 601.4.
 2. The luminance factor is measured in accordance with AS 1906.1 Appendix C using the Y function of the CIE 1964 colour system and shall be less than the maximum value specified in Table 601.4.

 FOR REFERENCE ONLY  DELETE GUIDANCE NOTES FROM FINAL DOCUMENT 1. All edits to downloaded Specifications shall be made using Track Changes, to clearly show
 added/deleted text. 2. If all information relating to a clause is deleted, the clause number should be retained and the
 words "NOT USED" should be inserted. 3. The proposed documents with tracked changes shall be submitted to the Project Manager for
 review, prior to printing the final batch of documents. When this final printing is carried out, the tracked changes option is to be turned off. 4. Before printing accept all changes in the document, turn off Track Changes and refresh the Table of Contents. 5. The Custodian of this specification is Principal Design Engineer.
 
 1.
 
 EXCAVATION OF ROCK
 
 1.1 If there is any likelihood that rock will be encountered in installing the barrier this should be brought to the Contractor's attention and if fill is being done as part of the Works then restrictions may need to be placed on the use of oversize material within the area that barrier system foundations may be placed. Insert an appropriate clause in CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS to cover the situation.
 
 2.
 
 W-BEAM AND THRIE BEAM BARRIERS (CLAUSE 603.22)
 
 2.1 If curved panels with a radii less then 45m are required they should be measured separately and require a Schedule of Rates / Bill of Quantities item. Note panels are not to be pre-bent for the WAMELT.
 
 3.
 
 REMOVAL OF EXISTING BARRIERS (CLAUSE 603.91)
 
 3.1 Where removal of existing barriers and end treatments are required, Clause 603.91 should be added under CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.
 
 3.2 Annexure 603E  Details the location of where any re-useable barrier sections or end treatments shall be delivered to. If not required then delete and add the words "NOT USED" to the Annexure title.
 
 3.3 In considering if existing barriers or end treatments are to be salvaged and retained by MRWA the value of the components to be salvaged should be taken into account. For example, it may not be worth salvaging 2-3 W-beam rails but it would be worth salvaging a crash attenuator some of which cost in the order of $15,000.
 
 3.4 Appropriate Schedule of Rates / Bill of Quantities item(s) should be included to cover loading, delivery and unloading of salvaged components to the Principal's storage area.

 DOUBLE SIDED RAIL BARRIER AND TWO AND THREE RAIL BARRIERS (CLAUSE
 
 603.92)
 
 4.1 These barriers are no longer accepted barrier types. However, it may be necessary to extend existing, double sided and/or two and three rail barriers. If so, include Clause 603.92 under CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.
 
 5.
 
 SUPPLY OF MATERIALS BY PRINCIPAL (CLAUSE 603.93)
 
 5.1 If as part of the Works the Principal is supplying materials Clause 603.93 should be added.
 
 5.2 If the Principal is not supplying any materials then delete the table in Annexure 603 F and add the words "NOT USED" to the Annexure title.
 
 6.
 
 PAINTING OF STEEL RAIL BARRIERS (CLAUSE 603.94)
 
 6.1 Steel rail barriers on urban bridges are often painted as required by the Asset Manager. If painting is required then Clause 603.94 should be added under CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.
 
 6.2 An appropriate pay item should also be added in the Schedule of Rates / Bill of Quantities.
 
 7.
 
 ANNEXURE 603A  ROAD SAFETY SYSTEM BARRIER REQUIREMENTS
 
 Where guide posts would normally be required and a wire rope barrier system is to be installed, instead of installing guide posts either in front or behind the barrier an alternative is for the posts or post caps of the systems to be marked with Class 1A reflective tape as suitable for each system. The location of the markings shall be in accordance with the Main Roads Guide to the Design of Guide Posts.
 
 In this case the following text shall be added beneath the list of approved barrier systems.
 
 Posts or post caps to be marked at suitable intervals based on post spacing to approximate 25 m intervals. For Brifen and Flexfence, post caps shall be marked with 100 mm (wide) x 50 mm (high) Class 1A reflective tape. For Sentryline II posts shall be marked with 50 mm (wide) x 150 mm (high) Class 1A reflective tape. The location and colouring of the markings shall be in accordance with the Main Roads Guide to the Design of Guide Posts.
 
 8.
 
 ANNEXURE 603B  ROAD SAFETY SYSTEM BARRIER REQUIREMENTS
 
 8.1 The Designer must complete ANNEXURE 603B as appropriate for the particular project.
 
 Table 603B.1
 
 Wire rope safety barriers systems (WRSB) come in a number of different post spacing. The post spacing affects the amount of deflection where wire rope barrier is proposed. The Designer shall nominate in Annexure 603B the deflection that has been allowed for in the design, the test level and if the barrier is to be installed on a curve the radius of the curve and identify it as concave or convex and if installed on a vertical curve if K < 30.

 Page 29 of 37
 
 Specification 603 Safety and Traffic Barrier Systems  04/10120 Issued 21//04/2017
 
 More guidance on the design of WRSB can be found in the Main Roads Guides to the Design of Road Safety Barriers.
 
 Table 603B.2
 
 This is to be completed for barrier types other then WRSB e.g. W-Beam, Thrie-beam, barriers for structures etc. they are typically specified to be installed in accordance with Main Roads Standard Drawings and therefore the test level is irrelevant.
 
 Likewise for the concrete barriers the test level is set by the height and foundation type of the concrete barriers if nominated on the Drawings, as it should be, the test level is therefore not relevant.
 
 Barriers for structures are similarly treated. Some of these details may be shown on the Drawings and therefore can be removed from Table 603B.2.
 
 Table 603B.3 End Treatments
 
 For the leading and departure end treatments for barrier systems other than wire rope either proprietary or public domain end systems can be used.
 
 The only public domain systems that are currently approved for use, by MRWA are the WAMELT (refer to Drawings 0330-1647-1651 inclusive), which is deemed to comply with TL 3 and the trailing terminal (refer to Figure F10 of AS / NZS 3845 for limitations on the use of this).
 
 The WA MELT has to be installed on a flare and uses timber breakaway posts. There have been issues associated with the supply of the timber posts in terms of quality and availability and the costs for the terminal has matched or exceeded the proprietary systems which use steel breakaway posts.
 
 Guidance on the use of the WA MELT was amended in July 2007 with the following statement being added "The timber posts have associated supply and durability issues and the parabolic flare creates installation difficulties. Designers are advised to utilise the other approved crashworthy terminals available."
 
 If a proprietary end treatment is to be used then the Designer shall specify the Test Level and the type of end treatment, i.e.:
 
 Re-directive gating
 
 If an extruder type end treatment is required e.g. SKT-350 or ET 2000 Plus then this should be identified in the table and any requirements such as install on a flare should be shown on the Drawings or included in Table 603B.2 or
 
 Re-directive non-gating
 
 Wire rope systems have their own end treatments, which are deemed to comply with TL3.
 
 For W-beam barriers there are a number of acceptable end treatments that can be used. The Designer may have chosen a particular product but in many cases other products may be acceptable. To ensure that no supplier is disadvantaged designers shall nominate in Table 603B.3 the end treatment that has been used for the basis of the design and in Table 603B.4 the accepted Main Roads configuration as well as other acceptable alternatives.
 
 Some of the proprietary end treatments have different configurations and not all of these are acceptable to Main Roads. Details of approved systems and their configurations can be found in the end treatment design sheets at Appendix H of the Guide to the Design of Road Safety Barriers.

 Specification 603 Safety and Traffic Barrier Systems  04/10120 Issued 21//04/2017
 Designers are to copy and paste the accepted configuration into Table 603B.3. An example is given below.
 Either contained in the table or preferably shown on the Drawings shall be details of how the end treatment shall be set-out. This is particularly relevant to the extruding gating end treatments which can be installed either on a flare or parallel to the road.
 If the end treatment is public domain i.e. WAMELT or the trailing terminal no test level is required and configuration details are required as the standard drawings have all the necessary information.

 A similar approach is to be taken for Crash Attenuators. Below is an example. Some of this information may be shown on the Drawings. The Designer also needs to specify foundation typically this would be shown on the Drawings. As with other end treatments, Main Roads preferred configuration can be found in Appendix H of the Guide to the Design of Road Safety Barriers.
 In place of the test level on some projects it may be more appropriate to specify the design speed.

 ANNEXURE 603C  CONCRETE CLASS FOR CONCRETE BARRIERS
 
 The annexure contains default concrete strengths for concrete barriers.
 In situations where road concrete barriers make up a small proportion of the total concrete barriers then to avoid having two classes on concrete on site the Designer may elect to change to concrete class on the road barriers to match the concrete barrier on the structure. Annexure 603C would need to be changed accordingly.
 If the Drawings indicate the class of concrete then the table in Annexure 603C can be deleted and the Annexure marked as Not Used.

 REMOVAL OF EXISTING PAVEMENT MARKINGS (Clause 604.36)
 
 Where existing pavement markings are to be removed or covered, the Contract shall specify the required method to be used. Inapplicable methods should be deleted and marked "NOT USED".
 
 Notes:
 
 1.
 
 In all instances where removal or cover of existing pavement markings is
 
 required, permanent removal by overlay of the road pavement is the preferred option as
 
 it provides a new surface for the new markings without compromising safety. Unless
 
 there is a concentration of pavement markings in one area, i.e. a marked pedestrian
 
 crossing, it can be an expensive option however this must be assessed against the
 
 safety implications of an alternative method of removal. Other methods of removal or
 
 cover are listed in 604.36. When choosing an alternative method of pavement marking
 
 removal or cover the following points should be considered:
 
 a) Is the removal/cover temporary or permanent?
 
 b) Will the chosen method achieve the desired result in both the short and long term without excessive maintenance?
 
 c) Will the safety of road traffic be compromised, i.e. will the resultant
 
 surface
 
 still display old markings which could be misleading to
 
 traffic?
 
 2.
 
 It should be noted that the painting over of existing road markings is
 
 considered to be a very short term and temporary measure.
 
 3.
 
 The Overspray method is generally used for aggregate seals only.
 
 6.
 
 SPOTTING & OVERTAKING BARRIERS
 
 6.1
 
 It is essential that prior to any longitudinal road marking taking place, the
 
 road is spotted in accordance with the approved methodology as set out in Clause
 
 604.31.02.2. The marking of overtaking barriers must also be undertaken prior to any
 
 longitudinal road marking commencing. It is essential that the overtaking barriers are
 
 marked out by a Main Roads accredited person.

 c. Cue  Any object within the environment which can be felt, heard, seen or smelt by a blind or vision impaired pedestrian
 d. Depth  Measured along the direction of travel when encountering the TGSI
 e. Directional Indicators  A directional indicator is a textured surface feature consisting of directional grooves built into or applied to walking surfaces to give directional orientation to blind and vision impaired people.
 f. Direction of Travel  The path a person travels along which may be a footpath, passageway, walkway, ramp, stairs, landing or similar.
 g. Discrete Tactile Ground Surface Indicators (discrete TGISs)  Tactile ground surface indicators that are individually installed, which provide the same luminance for the sloping sides and upper surface of the truncated cone.
 h. Front edge (of warning indicator)  This refers to the edge of the area of warning indicators closest to the roadway.
 i. Height  Distance measured above the finished floor or ground surface
 j. Integrated Tactile Ground Surface Indicators (integrated TGSIs)  Tactile ground surface indicators that are in a defined pattern and which are of the same luminance and material as the base surface.
 k. Luminance contrast - The light reflected from one surface or component, compared to the light reflected from another surface of component.
 l. Luminance factor - The ratio of luminance of a surface to that of a perfect reflector, identically illuminated
 m. LRV  Luminance reflectance value
 n. Orientation  Orientation is a person's awareness of where they are in relation to their environment.
 o. Tactile Ground Surface Indicators (TGSIs)  TGSIs are truncated cones or bars installed on the ground or floor surface designed to provide pedestrians who are blind or vision impaired, with warning or directional orientation information.
 p. Vision impaired  This is a general term covering all vision difficulties that cannot be adequately corrected by spectacles or contact lenses. Blindness implies severe impairment including a total or near total loss of the ability to perceive form. Therefore to cover total range of visual impairment, it is referred as "blind and vision impaired" and when mentioned vision impaired, it implies the person has sufficient residual vision for the user to benefit from the bold, high contrast visual cues etc.

 PRODUCT AND MATERIALS
 606.06 GENERAL
 1. TGSIs are designed to provide pedestrians with visual and sensory information. The two types of TGSIs used by Main Roads WA are warning indicators and directional indicators.
 2. Warning indicators alert pedestrians to hazards in the continuous accessible path of travel indicating that they should stop to determine the nature of the hazard before proceeding further.
 3. Directional indicators give directional orientation to blind and vision impaired people and designate the continuous accessible path of travel when other tactile or environmental cues are insufficient.
 4. The visual contrast between the walking surface and surrounding environment are critical for vision-impaired people who are using their limited residual vision for orientation, distinguishing the limits of the footpath, recognising hazards and gathering information. Therefore contrast is especially important in the provision of TGSIs to warn users of hazards. TGSIs shall provide a high visual contrast to the adjoining walking surface.
 5. TGSIs shall be installed so that there is no likelihood of the edges lifting. For this reason Main Roads WA does not approve the use of surface stickon type TGSIs, unless additional mechanical fastenings (eg. screws) are used.
 6. Discrete TGSIs are not to be used on Main Roads WA projects unless there are contract specific requirements.
 7. Main Roads WA does not recommend any specific TGSI for particular applications. The Contractor will need to assess which type or style of TGSI is most suitable for the particular application taking into account substrate, aesthetics, contrast, availability, consistency with the surrounding area and cost.
 8. An approved list of TGSI manufacturers and available colours that can be used, based on luminous contrast, for typical background materials in road infrastructure works is in Annexure 606A.

 INSTALLATION
 606.20 GENERAL
 1. In Western Australia, on Main Roads WA projects, Main Roads WA standard drawings supersede those shown in AS 1428.4.1 for the following typical treatments:
 a. Drawing No.200931-0089, Ramps Type A and Type B

 Specification 606 Tactile Ground Surface Indicators 12/6395 Issued 31/05//2018
 b. Drawing No.200931-0090, Modified Cut Through Corner Treatment c. Drawing No.200931-0091, Median Gaps
 606.21 METHOD OF INSTALLATION
 1. In the absence of any other documents approved by Main Roads Western Australia, all components of a TGSI as well as the installation methodology shall conform to the manufacturer's requirements.
 2. The methods of installation shall include
 a. In-built into substrate (Integrated TGSI tile)
 b. Adhesive Fixing (Integrated TGSI tile)
 606.22 IN-BUILT INTO SUBSTRATE
 1. MRWA's preferred method of installation for integrated TGSI tiles is in-built into the substrate. For new surfacing the TGSIs shall be in-built at the time of substrate construction in order to avoid the likelihood of the TGSIs coming off due to weak adhesion/bonding between the substrate and tiles.
 2. Specific attention should be given to ensuring that the TGSIs are installed flush with the surrounding surface so as not create a trip hazard.
 606.23 ADHESIVE FIXING
 1. To ensure satisfactory bonding of TGSIs to the surface, it is a Main Roads WA requirement that this method of fixing be supplemented by mechanical means (eg. use of screws into the substrate).
 2. TGSIs shall be installed with high strength adhesive recommended by the manufacturer, on a smooth, flat and dry surface to ensure the adhesive has maximum surface area contact.
 3. For integrated TGSIs, the edge of the base surface shall not be more than 3mm above the surrounding surface and have all exposed external edges chamfered.
 606.24 MECHANICAL FIXING
 1. In mechanical fixing, TGSIs with a stem or spigot that protrudes into the substrate are used instead of TGSIs with a flat base. This method is ideal to retro-fit discrete TGSIs after the substrate has been laid or on an existing substrate. The mechanical fixing mechanism may be supplemented through the use of an adhesive.
 2. For mechanical fixing, drilling templates shall be used as a guide and correct diameter holes drilled into the substrate to the minimum depth specified by the manufacturer.
 3. Metal TGSI's must be thoroughly cleaned with a suitable cleaning agent (eg; acetone) prior to installation. Any additional adhesive material used shall be recommended by the manufacturer.

 Glossary of Terms ( ITS)
 
 702.03.02 DESCRIPTION OF HELPHELP PHONE OPERATION
 
 1.
 
 The principle of this operation is that when a call is initiated
 
 in the field, the Help Roadside Phone automatically calls the phone
 
 number unique to that particular phone. This unique called number is
 
 known as the Voice Call Number.
 
 Principle of Operation
 
 2.
 
 The Voice Call Number is connected to Main Roads
 
 Customer Information Centre (CIC) at the Don Aitken Centre.
 
 3.
 
 The MRWA CIC is programmed to display on a screen:
 
  the pillar ID number of the calling Roadside help phone;
 
  the Pillar location; and
 
  Any other information as required.
 
 4.
 
 From the pillar number and other information programmed
 
 into the PABX the CIC operator answering the call is able to identify
 
 the location of the phone being used including which side of the
 
 carriageway without the caller giving any details.
 
 5.
 
 The CIC operators and the caller are able to communicate
 
 clearly in a two way (duplex) manner.
 
 6. In the event of a failure, the Roadside help Phone can detect the listed defects and will automatically initiate a call to the Help programmed Phone Manager number and log the details of the defect.

 ROADSIDE HELP PHONE NETWORK PROVIDING PROGRAMMABLE INFORMATION TO PHONE SUPPLIER
 
 1.
 
 Background
 
 Main Roads in the Perth metropolitan area operates a roadside help phone network that includes both cable connected (PSTN) and cellular (GSM) phones, maintained by an electronic management system. The specification for additions to the network requires management compatibility with the existing installed system.
 
 The electronic maintenance and management system involves programming sets of key data into each phone facia by the supplier. As data custodianship exists at separate locations, it needs to be picked up and eventually dropped off with the supplier to use. An electronic shuttle system, ShuttleSked, has been developed to pick up data at various stops, and convey it ahead to various necessary destinations. The shuttle itself essentially is an Excel spreadsheet, titled Configuration Schedule.
 
 Note:
 
 Under the Contract, Downer EDI Engineering and GHD Pty Ltd are service
 
 providers to Main Roads for electrical design and asset inventory custodianship and
 
 electrical infrastructure maintenance, respectively  including Metropolitan Roadside
 
 Help Phones.

 CONTRACTOR collects a blank Configuration Schedule ("shuttle") from its
 
 depot and completes the shuttle identification information of informs MRWA
 
 Maintenance contractor of the following information for each Help Phone:
 
 (a) Contract No.
 (b) Site Location Drawing No (this can be shown as the first Drawing then add "on")
 (c) Name of Licensed Firm Installing Phones
 [This `licence' will be checked by Main Roads at shuttlestop (3), before authorisation to continue is given]
 Separate shuttles are made up for separate phone suppliers, if more than one is involved.
 From information provided in Contract Documents, the columns of Location Details are to be completed.
 Note (A) If some Pillar No's are to be provided with cable-connected (PSTN) phones, rather than cellular phones  in the Optus/Telstra Details area the SIM PIN column in line with those Pillars should show "PSTN", to prevent inadvertent SIM card issue!
 Note (B) If GSM phones are involved, then SIM Cards issued by Optus will be sent by courier service to the phone supplier (5). Hence the CONTRACTOR'S electronic note accompanying the Configuration Schedule (shuttle) must provide a delivery address.
 Note (C) It is assumed that at this point the CONTRACTOR has already sourced a phone supplier and placed a formal order. The supplier's name and email address must also be conveyed in the CONTRACTOR'S transmittal note.

 ANNEXURE C
 
 C.1
 
 COMMISSIONING OF PHONES
 
 The commissioning of the phones has to be done in stages. It is important that each
 
 stage is completed prior to the next stage is commenced. If certain stages are missed
 
 or completed in the wrong order it could result in phone being installed that do not work
 
 or have no location assigned so it is not known where the help call is coming from.
 
 In the past a paper based "ShuttleSked" system was used, but this became unworkable due to the changing roles of the parties involved in the installation process. This process was abandoned and replaced with a process of stages that have to be completed in the correct order to ensure the phone becomes correctly operational.
 C.1.1 Commissioning Stages To ensure the phones are commissioned and become operational in a proper way the following stages have to be strictly adhered to:
 1. Obtain SIM card and pillar number from MRWA. 2. Inform MRWA CIC of details of each phone to be commissioned. 3. Prior to the phones being installed check with the MRWA CIC that MRWA CIC
 Phone System is programmed. 4. Install Help Phone in its intended location and make a test call to MRWA CIC. 5. Inform MRWA TCIC Maintenance Contractor that a phone has been installed. 6. Provide "As Built" and Handover documentation.
 
 The MRWA Help Phones are normally installed by one party, but up to 5 parties work together to keep the system operational. Therefore information has to be shared by all the parties in a controlled environment to ensure that the correct information is available at the right time to each party.
 
 C.1.1.1 Obtain SIM card and Pillar number from MRWA
 
 1.
 
 Five (5) weeks before a contractor is planning to commission a Roadside Help
 
 Phone MRWA is to be contacted and a request is to be made for the supply of an phone
 
 ID and SIM card for each phone to be commissioned.
 
 2.
 
 MRWA should issue the SIM card and phone ID within 2 to 3 weeks.
 
 MAIN ROADS Western Australia Contract xxx/xx
 
 Specification 702 Roadside Help phones Document 04/10124 Issue 29/10/12
 
 Page 25 of 33
 
 C.1.1.2 Inform MRWA CIC of details of each phone to be commissioned.
 
 1.
 
 Three (3) weeks before the phone is to be commissioned the contractor informs
 
 the MRWA CIC of the following:
 
 
 
 Phone ID
 
 
 
 SIM Card Number
 
 
 
 Site location, consisting of name of road the phone is installed on,
 
 nearest other road and direction of carriageway.
 
 
 
 Anticipated Installation and Commissioning Date is required to
 
 program the MRWA CIC Phone System and MRWA is aware of its urgency.
 
 2. Check to be carried out prior to the phone being installed and commissioned.
 About 1 week before the phone is to be installed and commissioned the MRWA CIC will have to be contacted to confirm the MRWA CIC Phone System is programmed with each phone's particulars.
 
 3.
 
 Install and commissioning procedure.
 
 On the installation day, when each Help Phone is installed the contractor shall immediately apply the pillar ID. A test call to the MRWA CIC shall also be made to confirm the MRWA CIC Phone System is programmed correctly. Test calls shall not be made during CIC peak times of 7:00 to 9:00 AM, 12:00 to 1:00 PM and 4:00 to 6:00 PM. If the MRWA CIC Phone System is not programmed correctly or the Pillar ID can not be installed, the phone shall be temporarily removed, or marked with an "Out Of Service" tag until the programming is rectified. The "Out Of Service" tag shall as a minimum cover the speaker and microphone as well as the button area of the fascia. Due to the often unexpected nature it is acceptable to make the tag out of printed, white photocopy paper, installed with cling wrap to the fascia. The tag shall therefore be white in colour with large black lettering.
 
 4.
 
 Post installation and commissioning procedure.
 
 The Contractor shall within 7 days of commissioning a Roadside Help Phone forward a copy of the Commissioning Notice contained in Annexure A to both the MRWA TCIC Electrical Maintenance Contractor and MRWA CIC. It is important that the MRWA TCIC Electrical Maintenance Contractor is informed as to the location, SIM number, Phone ID and other relevant data so the Phone Tester can be programmed and the periodic testing can commence. If not all phones on each drawing are commissioned within a 7 day period, the "Commissioning Notice" shall be forwarded within 7 days of the first phone on each

 drawing being commissioned, a note shall be provided to indicate which phones have not been commissioned and their expected commissioning date. When all phones on each drawing have been commissioned a final "Commissioning Notice" shall be issued.
 
 5.
 
 Providing the "As Built" and Handover documentation.
 
 The Contractor shall provide "As-Constructed Drawings" showing the location of the Roadside Help Phones in the latest AutoCAD format within 14 days of the phone commissioning to the MRWA TCIC document custodian GHD. The Drawings shall be in a format in accordance with Main Roads drawing 9134-4012  "Help Phone Locations for the Mitchell and Kwinana Freeways."
 
 C1.1.3 Removal or relocation of Roadside Help Phones
 Under no circumstances are Roadside Help Phones to be removed and stored or otherwise disposed of, unless specified in the Contract. If a Roadside Help Phone is left not operating for any period an "Out of Service" label shall be attached to the fascia until the facility has been returned to the operational status. It is acceptable to make the tag out of printed, white photocopy paper, installed with cling wrap to the fascia, if the tag is going to be in place for weeks, the tag has to be inspected periodically and replaced if not legible.
 C1.1.4 Relocation procedure. When relocating a Roadside Help Phone the following stages shall be adhered to: 1. One week prior to relocation of the Help Phone(s) the Contractor shall inform Main Roads Customer Call Centre and the MRWA TCIC Maintenance Contractor of the intention to relocate the phone, giving details of the old and new location and intended date of the relocation. 2. The original phone, complete with concrete pad and phone base shall be removed. Under no circumstances shall the footing be pulled out by pulling on the Help Phone. 3. The verge at the original phone location shall be reinstated to match the surrounding verge. 4. If a temporary location is used this location shall be kept as close to the original, or new, location as possible. 5. Whilst the phone is in a temporary location it shall be kept operational. If possible, wheelchair access shall be maintained. 6. The original phone shall be installed at the new location following the Roadside Help Phone installation Specification.

 Centre (TOC)
 
 The scope of work covered by this specification includes:
 
 a) The supply and installation of the camera housing, and camera pole.
 
 b) The supply and installation of the communications cabinet or traffic signals top-hat extension.
 
 c) The supply, installation and testing of all communications and associated equipment.
 
 d) The interfacing of all camera sites into the existing MRWA TOC CCTV system.
 
 e) The supply of as-constructed documentation and any relevant training information.
 
 2.
 
 CCTV `Tilt' Pole Drawings provided by Main Roads WA are
 
 based on existing CCTV site installations.
 
 These drawings are not intended to be design drawings for new installations. The supply of these drawings is to enable performance features required by the Main Roads Specifications to be included in new CCTV installations.
 
 CCTV `Tilt' Pole Drawings
 
 Some elements of the drawings, such as mounting spigot detail and lock box detail, allow for compatibility with existing infrastructure and provide for required operational features.
 
 NOTE: The reference to the `Tilt' Pole drawings are not intended to imply any intellectual property ownership by Main Roads of the `Tilt' Pole design.
 
 Actual construction details of the CCTV pole and footing will need to be designed to meet the performance criteria specified, and to meet any conditions specific to each site (such as soil conditions, likely maximum wind speed etc.).

 AS3996: 2006 includes ratings of up to 900 kN loading for Class G. To meet the loading requirements, it is expected that the top of the pit would be strengthened, as part of the design, either with an increased material width (nominally 125mm) surrounding the lid, or by a reinforcing frame. Given that the lid loadings are transferred to the pits, the design, construction (mode and material), manufacture and installation of the pits shall be such that they can accommodate the specified forces without damage or distortion.
 CO used above refers to the Circular Opening of the pit and is defined in AS/NZ 3996-2006, Paragraph 1.1.4 and shown in Figure 1.1 of the specification.
 The following procedures and test methods shall be used to perform the test sequences noted above:
 Vertical Centre Load A 240 mm x 240 mm x 25.4 mm steel plate will be placed on a 240 mm x 240 mm x 25. 4 mm soft plywood layer and be located at the centre of the enclosure lid, oriented as indicated in Figure 1. The full magnitude of the cyclic load will be applied over the centre of the plate for 5 seconds and then removed. The loading and unloading rate shall not exceed 5 kN per minute. This cycle is repeated 4 more times, after which the final (maximum) load is applied for 10 seconds and then removed.

 separate concrete surround. The ring must be secured to the top of the pit. The pit, ring, and lid as an assembly shall carry the required loads as detailed in the Application Chart of 704.08.4 above. There may still be a project specific requirement to install pits with concrete surrounds, or within a concrete pad or paved area. This requirement should be confirmed by the project manager.
 
 12.
 
 Unless otherwise specified, Pit Lids must be Badged and
 
 fully Certified to AS 3996: 2006. Pit Lids shall be pad-lockable type, 4 to
 
 5mm tread patterned, hot dipped galvanised steel to AS 4680: 2006.
 
 Composite Resin Fill lids shall meet AS4586:2004 Slip resistance
 
 standards with a `W' Wet pendulum and/or `B' Wet Barefoot
 
 classification. If the locking mechanism resides in the lid, the lock shall
 
 be recessed in a chamber hidden behind a steel panel of similar
 
 material to the lid. All metal components of the lid, pit and locking
 
 mechanism shall be hot dipped galvanised steel (to AS 4680: 2006) or
 
 marine grade stainless steel.
 
 Pit Lids (Steel)
 
 13.
 
 Alternative pit lid material and construction may be approved
 
 by the Project Superintendent/Manager in consultation with the Asset
 
 Manager Traffic Systems. Such alternatives could include Composite
 
 Resin Fill, HDPE, or separate lid sections, such as a combination of a
 
 (AS 4680: 2006) galvanised steel lid with a concrete filled galvanised
 
 steel/ aluminium tray lid, provided that the loading, construction/
 
 performance and locking requirements of this specification are met. All
 
 lids shall be lockable with either a recessed padlock, as discussed in
 
 paragraph 15 above, for high security, or a captured L bolt lock for
 
 medium security applications.

 14.
 
 For pit lids (including lids incorporating the locking
 
 mechanism), the lid surface shall have no hole larger than 6mm
 
 diameter with the locking chamber closed. Alternative lifting methods
 
 such as magnets may be used in place of lifting holes to access the
 
 locking chamber under a spring loaded cover. The locking mechanism
 
 cover plate shall not be secured by screws. All lids shall allow for safe
 
 and practical lifting. Requirement for special tools (if any) should be
 
 identified.
 
 No lifting Hole
 
 15.
 
 The pit locking mechanism, whether located in the pit or the
 
 lid, shall be supplied and fitted with a type 234 Yale brass padlock with
 
 stainless steel shackles, and must utilise the Main Roads secure
 
 (restricted copy) locking system. Details of the locking system should be
 
 obtained from the Project Superintendent /Manager.

 1.
 
 The maximum distance between cable pits shall be 250
 
 metres. Every fourth pit (i.e. pits at approximately 1000 metre intervals)
 
 shall be a large MRW8 size to allow for the coiling of additional cable.
 
 These distances are applicable for optical fibre cable drawn in conduit.
 
 2.
 
 Where `blown fibre' is installed the distance between pits
 
 may be extended to a nominal 500 metres, coinciding with vehicle
 
 detector locations, where applicable. Pit spacing for `blown fibre' may
 
 extend beyond this to a nominal 750 metres where there is no
 
 requirement for field devices within this spacing. Pit sizes will normally
 
 depend on project specific requirements. With the pits often coinciding

 Excavate the site using hand or mechanical methods ensuring that the bottom of the excavation is level and conforms with general slope of ground level.
 
 1.2
 
 Bed the MRW pit on layer of fine crushed rock (20mm
 
 or less) to a depth of 75mm to 125mm to prevent subsidence and
 
 assist drainage. The rock shall be free of soil and organic material.
 
 Alternatively a dry mix of cement and crushed rock in a ratio of
 
 1:10 may be used where higher lateral loads are anticipated.
 
 Preparing Pit Foundation
 
 In circumstances where other services are located underneath the MRW pit, place approved mechanical protection below
 foundation covering complete base area of the pit.
 
 1.3
 
 MRW pit cover and floor should be installed and
 
 Placing Pit in
 
 secured on body prior to placing pit into position and/or backfilling. Excavation
 
 Place the assembled pit into the excavation using appropriate handling method or aid. Once pit and lid are placed in position adjust the height and top of the pit so that it is level with surrounding footway/driveway or ground surface.
 
 Centre the pit in the excavation in line with the conduit entries and parallel to the edge of the footway or driveway paving.
 
 1.4
 
 Ensure top of the pit is as per final ground level and
 
 allow for the correct depth of footway or driveway to the edge of
 
 the pit.
 
 Backfilling
 
 a) Discard rocks larger than 40mm from the backfill material. b) Match level and surface grade to surrounding area. c) Remove excess excavated material from the site. d) Backfill around the pit using the finer excavated material in
 200mm deep layers tamping each layer either by hand or using a mechanical tamper. e) Ensure backfill flows into MRW pit rib pockets to secure pit into position.
 
 Installed pit is as follows:

 3. AND
 
 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS  CONFIGURATION OF ITS CONDUITS CABLE PITS
 
 3.1
 
 Conduits shall be run to enable cables to be 'drawn-in' after installation, with
 
 sufficient accessible cable pits to be used for this purpose.
 
 3.2.
 
 A single 100mm diameter white conduit for fibre optic telecommunication
 
 cable and a single 100mm diameter orange conduit for electrical power cable, shall be
 
 installed below ground in a straight line between cable pits, along the cable route, in the
 
 configuration shown in Main Roads Drawing Number 200431-0081-1. Alternative
 
 configurations and arrangements, as with the use of `brown fibre' may be approved by
 
 the Project Superintendent/Manager in consultation with the Asset Manager Traffic
 
 Systems.
 
 3.3.
 
 Except where shown on the drawings, cable pits for each of the conduits
 
 shall be located at intervals to allow for hauling of the cable and connection to terminal
 
 equipment.

 3.4.
 
 Existing road crossings for cable conduits are at locations and at depths
 
 below the pavement as shown on the drawings. The crossings consist of one or more
 
 300mm concrete pipes extending 1 metre either side of the roadway. Heavy-duty
 
 underground conduits shall be used to segregate cables through the concrete pipes.
 
 3.5.
 
 Cable pits shall be provided at the following specific locations:
 
 a) Each side of under road crossings.
 b) Nominated locations as shown on the drawings.
 c) Changes in direction of conduit alignment of more than ten degrees.
 d) Interfaces between different types of cable routes.
 e) Every 250 metres or less (except for blown fibre installations where the spacing may be between 500metres and 750 metres depending on device connection requirements).
 
 3.6.
 
 One MRW8 cable-jointing pit shall be located at every fourth pit location.
 
 One MRW8 cable-jointing pit shall be located at each side of under-road crossings. All
 
 other pits shall be MRW4 cable hauling pits. Except where shown on the drawings, the
 
 cable pits for each conduit route shall be located adjacent to each other, a minimum of 2
 
 metres apart longitudinally, and offset to allow the other conduit route to pass. (See
 
 Main Roads Drawing Number 200431-0081-1.) The intention of this requirement is to
 
 allow the conduits to be laid side by side in the trench whilst ensuring that the two types
 
 of cable are completely segregated.
 
 3.7.
 
 Where the work involves the relocation of existing ITS conduits, the use of
 
 MRW7 type pits in lieu of MRW8 pits may be specified to allow the re-use of pits and/or
 
 lids if this is an option.

 INSTALLATION OF NEW CABLES IN OCCUPIED CONDUIT / DUCTS
 
 1.
 
 The conduit must be proven with a suitable mandrel prior to
 
 attempting any hauling. As a guide where the conduit capacity is
 
 questionable (e.g. the aggregated existing plus new cable/subduct
 
 diameters exceeds 80% of the internal diameter of the conduit) the conduit
 
 must be proven with a suitable mandrel 1.5 times the size of the cable. If
 
 this is successful and it can be reasonably assumed there will be no
 
 damage to any cables, subducts or infrastructure, the haul can proceed.
 
 2.
 
 If at any stage the proving of the conduit becomes difficult or
 
 the conduit cannot be proven and there is a possibility of cable damage,
 
 the conduit must be upgraded
 
 3.
 
 Once all sections of the proposed haul have been proven the
 
 hauling tensions and lay off points ,if required, shall be determined
 
 4.
 
 Pressure roping shall be used in preference to hand rodding, to
 
 minimise the possibility of intertwining of cables during hauling.
 
 5.
 
 A water based cable lubricant that is Non-Toxic, Non-
 
 Flammable and compatible with all types of cable sheath shall be used, on
 
 the cables, rope and mandrel when hauling over existing cables.
 
 6.
 
 Existing optical fibre cables shall be restrained from moving in
 
 the same direction as the haul.
 
 7.
 
 During the haul supervision shall be provided at entry, exit and
 
 change of direction locations.
 
 705.28 HAULING  CARE OF EXISTING PLANT
 
 1.
 
 The existing MRWA TCS Network must be cared for at all times
 
 and not interfered with during the course of proving conduits, the
 
 installation of rope and/or additional cable.
 
 2.
 
 If the existing cables and/or closures need to be moved during
 
 work tasks, they are to be handled carefully, suitably restrained and
 
 replaced correctly in the pit on completion of the task.
 
 3.
 
 Avoid lacing the rope through existing cable loops, as this will
 
 cause undue pressure to be inserted upon the cables and joints.
 
 4.
 
 Care must be taken to ensure existing cables, identification
 
 tags, joints or other plant are not caught up with and dragged by the
 
 hauling rope or cable being installed.
 
 5.
 
 Existing cables or subduct shall be constantly observed for
 
 movement (through dragging). If there are any significant signs of cable
 
 gathering, or of cable or subduct movement at any location along the
 
 route, the haul shall stop immediately, and action taken e.g. reapply
 
 lubricants, restraint to prevent further movement /dragging of the cable(s)
 
 or subduct, before recommencing the haul.

 705.42 OTDR LINK LOSS
 
 1.
 
 All OTDR Fibre test results shall be recorded and saved with
 
 the correctly assigned MRWA Asset numbers used to describe End A / End
 
 B with cursors correctly aligned.
 
 OTDR Tests
 
 2.
 
 All fibres are to be tested utilising two-way OTDR Link Loss
 
 (LL) measurements. The measurements shall also be carried out on spare
 
 fibres within the cable that either terminate at one end only or are provided
 
 between joint/splice locations.
 
 Two-way Measurement
 
 3.
 
 An OTDR Link Loss (LL) measurement shall be performed on
 
 all fibres to confirm the integrity of the cable link excluding the performance
 
 of the pre-terminated connector.
 
 Fibre Integrity
 
 4.
 
 On terminated fibres the link loss tests shall be performed after
 
 termination of connector, which would then include the connector loss
 
 being factored in the LL data recording. The link loss shall be tested and
 
 recorded in both directions at wavelengths 1550nm utilising the OTDR
 
 (Two-point method i.e. position the first cursor just beyond the front end
 
 attenuation saturation dead zone where the trace is linear and position the
 
 second cursor at the end of the trace just before the trace begins to rise).
 
 The two-way (average) link loss (LL) for a fibre shall be calculated as the
 
 average of the measurements. The two-way (average) OTDR LL shall not
 
 exceed the following:
 
 Link Loss Test
 
 Maximum Loss at 1550 nm (LL) = 0.3L + 0.1N + 0.5, where: a) LL = Maximum allowable Link Loss in dB
 
 Maximum Link Loss
 
 b) L = the optical link length in Km
 
 c) N = number of splices
 
 5.
 
 If a fibre fails the OTDR Link Loss after a number of re-
 
 measurements, then a more comprehensive evaluation of the fibre link
 
 should be undertaken to determine the high loss i.e. re-check of any
 
 irregularities, splice losses and fibre attenuation co-efficient (dB/km).
 
 Test Failure
 
 705.43 IRREGULARITY CHECK
 
 1.
 
 All fibres in each section length shall be checked for any
 
 irregularities in both directions at wavelengths of 1310nm and 1550nm. The
 
 magnitude of irregularities (point losses) in length shall be calculated as the

 705.44 SPLICE LOSS / LOCATION
 
 1.
 
 These measurements shall be undertaken for the purpose of
 
 ensuring the integrity and quality of splice performance and identifying and
 
 documenting optical fibre cable distances to all splice locations to assist in
 
 the future location of faults.
 
 2.
 
 The optical distance and magnitude of all splices shall be
 
 measured from both directions at wavelengths of 1310nm and 1550nm.
 
 The loss of any splice shall not exceed 0.10dB (two way average) at
 
 1310nm and 1550nm.
 
 3.
 
 Any splice loss that exceeds the above criteria shall be re-
 
 spliced. If the splice does not improve after two attempts at resplicing and
 
 OTDR testing confirms that the splice loss is not consistent with a high
 
 point loss within the splice enclosure then the splice shall be accepted but
 
 reported as a high splice loss. All splice loss/joint measurements shall be
 
 recorded and any reported high splice loss value shall be appropriately
 
 marked and reported.
 
 705.45 LSPM INSTERTION LOSS
 
 1.
 
 This measurement shall be undertaken on terminated fibres to
 
 verify the overall end-to-end power budget level of the entire fibre link. The
 
 Insertion Loss (IL) for each fibre shall be measured in both directions using
 
 a stabilised LSPM.
 
 2.
 
 These results shall be compared with predictions based on the
 
 manufacturer's SMOF geometrical properties and minimum splice loss
 
 criteria.
 
 3.
 
 The maximum two-way (average) Insertion Loss shall not
 
 exceed the following criteria:
 
 a) Maximum Loss at 1310nm (IL) = 0.4L + 0.1N + 0.50C + 0.5
 
 b) Maximum Loss at 1550nm (IL) = 0.3L + 0.1N + 0.50C + 0.5
 
 Where;
 
 a) IL = Maximum allowable Insertion Loss in dB,
 
 b) L = optical section link Length in km,
 
 c) N = Number of splices including pre-terminated connector, and
 
 d) C = total number of through Connectors.
 
 4.
 
 If a fibre exceeds the acceptance criteria then the insertion loss
 
 value shall be appropriately marked (e.g. circled, highlighted, etc.).

 This calculation is performed to verify the overall performance
 
 of the individual connector / pigtail combination situated at either end of the
 
 optical fibre link.
 
 2.
 
 For each fibre the delta between the maximum Insertion Loss
 
 (average IL).
 
 3.
 
 LSPM Insertion Loss (Clause 705.47) less the OTDR average
 
 Link Loss (LL) (Clause 705.42) shall not exceed 1.0dB. Results for all fibre
 
 shall be calculated and recorded.
 
 4
 
 If the 1.0dB limit is exceeded for any fibre then a more
 
 comprehensive evaluation of the individual pre-terminated connector at
 
 both ends will need to be undertaken to determine the high loss (i.e.
 
 investigate the launch conditions of each pre-terminated connector using
 
 OTDR in high resolution mode.
 
 705.47 COMMISSIONING ACCEPTANCE TEST RESULTS

 MODE ENTRY FOR CONFLICT CHECKING
 
 It is necessary to specify the nominal mains voltage to allow the controller to set up correct voltage thresholds for the red, yellow and green lamps for conflict monitoring.
 
 The controller is also able to provide voltage control to the lamps to protect lamps against over voltage supply, which shortens lamp life. The controller is also able to provide dimming to reduce lamp intensity at night. The CMODE entry allows either none, one or two levels of dimming to be specified as the default.
 
 The function of the bits in the CMODE entry for conflict checking is:

 Notes: 1. With the mains voltage code specified for 240 Volts, level 1 dimming
 corresponds to a 10% reduction in lamp supply voltage, and level 2 dimming corresponds to a 20% reduction in lamp supply voltage. Different percentage reductions for the dimming levels may be applicable for other mains supply voltages. Refer also to discussion for the DIMDAT table. 2. Bit 10 being set in the CMODE entry disables checking of conflicts with yellow for all signal groups, for the Secondary Conflict Monitor only.

 SITE POST COMMISSIONING CHECKS
 Upon commissioning, the Contractor must check the operation of the traffic signals as listed below: 711 L.1 Operations check  Ensure that all vehicular and pedestrian movements are executed safely.  Ensure that all Signal Groups are operating as per design drawing and as specified
 in the Phase Sequence Chart.  Verify the operation of all signal groups overlap as specified.  Ensure that the pedestrian protection (time separation, short arrow, and full
 protection) is adequate and operating correctly.  Check that all software documentation in controller folder is up to date and accurate. 711 L.2 Timing checks  Check that the minimum value is displayed for a safe minimum time for vehicles to
 enter the intersection.  Check that the maximum green values are correct for Isolated operation in peak
 periods.  Check the yellow values are set according to the posted speed limit and the road
 gradient.  Check that the all-red values allow a safe clearance of vehicles within the
 intersection.  Check that the Gap / Headway / Waste values are adequate for each approach.  Check the pedestrian clearance times are adequate.  Check the Advanced Warning Flashing Signs (AWFS) times are adequate. Timings can be adjusted in RAM through the KDU or SCATS. When all the timings are finalised the timings are burned in a new EPROM or Personality Card and installed on site.
 711 L.3 Demands and Extension  Ensure that all pedestrian pushbuttons demands are registered and activated to
 service the corresponding crossing.  Ensure that all the loops demand and extensions operate as per design and detector
 chart to demand and extend the corresponding movement. 711 L.4 SCATS Checks  Ensure that SCATS communications are correctly established.  SCATS Masterlink/Flexilink features operate as specified.  Check that the SCATS controlled operation is correct with special flags and XSF bits
 correctly set and cleared.  Check that all special functions under Masterlink or Flexilink control are operating
 correctly.

 not prevent the support tray from sitting in its correct position or cause
 
 the cables to kink.
 
 NOTE: All Ring Main cable cores shall be connected in the Termination Pits regardless of the controller type. However, for controllers with lamp conflict monitoring, only the cores specified on the Cable Chart shall be connected to the controller Terminals. To complete the ring main circuit at the Termination Pits the incoming and outgoing terminals shall be bridged using a two pin bridging link e.g Weidmuller QS2 or similar approved pin Bridging Link. Where there are three posts per signal group connected in one termination box a 3 pin bridging link e.g Weidmuller QS3 plug or similar shall be used. The use of two QS2 plugs in this situation is not acceptable.

 1. The Contractor shall be responsible for the design of all temporary works, including, but not limited to, the casting bay, launching girder, temporary piers, launching bearings, jacking systems, braking system and side restraint systems. All design forces which will react onto the permanent structure, and the means of ensuring they are not exceeded, shall be clearly identified in the calculations and/or on the drawings.
 
 2. At least 4 weeks prior to carrying out any work on the deck launching system the Contractor shall supply to the Superintendent full details of the proposed method of construction, including 4 copies of all drawings, specifications and procedures, and certification that the proposal has been independently verified by an engineer experienced in this form of construction.
 
 808.07 DESIGN ASSUMPTIONS
 
 1. Use of the Incremental Launching Method requires the designer to make a number of assumptions about the construction method. These are detailed on the Drawings. Any proposal to vary these could require redesign of the permanent works. The Principal will take account of these costs when assessing tenders.
 
 2. Supports for the casting bay, temporary supports and the launching procedure shall be such as to restrict differential settlement between adjacent longitudinal supports to the following:
 
 a. Casting bed and temporary support  3mm
 
 b. Temporary support and abutment
 
  3mm
 
 c. Abutment and pier
 
  3mm
 
 d. Any two piers
 
  3mm
 
 808.08 LAUNCHING GIRDER
 
 1. The properties of the launching girder shall be as shown on the Drawings. The connection between the launching girder and the end of the deck shall be as detailed on the Drawings.
 
 2. Any changes proposed by the Contractor to either the details of the launching girder or the connection between the launching girder and the deck must be approved by the Superintendent. Any changes required to the Drawings will be carried out by the Principal at no cost to the Contractor.

 4. Prior to driving any spliced piles, the Contractor shall supply to the Superintendent certification that the splice complies with the requirements of the Specification.
 5. The driving has been designed assuming the details shown in Annexure 810C. The Contractor should note that the packing requirement is for a minimum thickness at the conclusion of driving. To ensure compliance excess will need to be inserted at the commencement of driving and it may be necessary to replenish the packing during driving. In any event the packing shall be replaced after driving each pile or more frequently if necessary.
 6. To avoid the possibility of premature `setting-up' pile driving shall be continuous in the latter stages without deliberate stops except as directed by the Superintendent. Delays of as little as 15 minutes may lead to significant `set-up' in piles. Where premature `set-up' has occurred the Contractor shall be required to overcome this by continued driving where resistance to penetration may be significantly greater than normal.
 7. The Superintendent may direct that certain selected piles be subject to a `set-up' test. These piles shall be driven as specified and subsequently redriven 24 hours after completion of initial driving. A Provisional Sum is allowed for this operation.
 8. The Contractor shall record the number of blows for each 250mm of pile penetration. Details of each pile driven shall be kept on pile driving record forms as shown in Annexure 810D.
 810.29 DRIVING STEEL CIRCULAR PILES
 1. The Contractor's attention is drawn to the special requirements for driving steel circular piles, in particular the varied nature of the foundation material as indicated by the bore logs Drawings and the possible need to drive and excavate within and ahead of the steel circular piles to attain the specified penetration. Where the bore logs show layers of hard rock, it may be necessary to drill and blast before piles are driven to achieve the penetration. Blasting shall be carried out in such a way that overbreak is kept to a minimum.
 2. Blasting shall not be carried out inside steel circular piles. Piles which cannot be driven to the required penetration without exceeding a set of 200 blows/250mm using the hammer specified in Annexure 810A shall be excavated within the pile or ahead of the pile toe as necessary and redriven. Repeated excavation and redriving may be necessary to achieve the minimum penetrations specified.
 3. Excavation ahead of the pile toe shall be such as to keep overbreak to a minimum. Where excessive overbreak occurs within 1.5m from the minimum penetrations specified, piles shall be extended to the required penetration by socketing as detailed on the Drawings.
 4. Where the toe of a pile reaches sound rock at a level above the minimum penetration specified and where the bore information indicates that a minimum depth of 2m of sound rocks exists below the pile toe then the pile can be anchored into the rock by means of a rock socket as detailed on the Drawings.

 810.30 DYNAMIC PILE TESTING
 
 1. As an audit the Superintendent will select piles as described in Annexure 810B for dynamic pile testing when the piles are close to the minimum specified set. The Contractor shall cease driving when directed by the Superintendent and provide all necessary assistance for attaching the dynamic test recording equipment to the pile. The pile shall then be redriven.
 
 Dynamic Testing
 
 2. The Contractor shall allow in the rates for pile driving for all necessary assistance required to carry out the dynamic pile tests and for a delay of up to five days for the tests to be carried out and the results analysed before further piles are driven.
 
 3. All dynamic testing shall be undertaken by the Superintendent and all costs met by the Principal.
 
 4. The Contractor shall give the Superintendent 4 weeks' notice of when pile driving the test sample as described in Annexure 810B is scheduled to commence.
 
 810.31 TEMPORARY COMPRESSIONS
 
 1. The Contractor shall take temporary compressions on a minimum of 2 piles at each pile cap during pile driving. Temporary compressions will normally be taken when the pile is close to final set. The Contractor shall allow for any delays incurred in taking temporary compressions. Alternatively, the Contractor may use other means of testing in lieu of temporary compressions.
 
 Temporary Compressions
 
 810.32 ACCEPTANCE OF PILES
 
 1. Minimum toe RLs for the piles are shown on the Drawings. The actual driven length may vary based on the driving performance of the piles in each particular foundation. The main criteria in the acceptance of the piles are that the minimum penetration (pile toe RL) and the minimum set as shown in Annexure 810C shall both be attained.
 
 Acceptance Criteria for Driving
 
 810.33 TOLERANCES ON PILES
 
 1. Piles shall be driven to comply with the following tolerances:
 
 Tolerances
 
 a. Variation from specified position in plan 75mm
 
 b. Variation from vertical in a 3m template 15mm
 
 c. Variation from specified batter (other than vertical) in a 3m template
 
 30mm
 
 d. Variation in specified cut-off level
 
 10mm
 
 810.34 CUTTING OFF
 
 1. On completion of driving, piles shall be cut-off to the levels as determined from the Drawings.

 4. At least 7 days prior to driving of piles, the Contractor shall submit details of the proposed Hammer to be used including:
 a. Energy rating of hammer
 b. Details of helmet and dolly
 c. Mass of ram and total mass of hammer
 d. Method of determining the efficiency of the hammer during pile installation.
 811.28 PITCHING AND DRIVING
 1. Piles shall be pitched accurately in position prior to the commencement of driving.
 2. Prior to driving any piles, the Contractor shall supply to the Superintendent certification that the piles comply in all respects with the requirements of the Specification.
 3. Prior to driving any piles, the Contractor shall supply to the Superintendent certification that the plan position and batter of the piles comply with the requirements of the Specification.
 4. Prior to driving any piles, the Contractor shall supply to the Superintendent certification that the splice complies with the requirements of the Specification.
 5. The driving has been designed assuming the details shown in Annexure 811A. The Contractor should note that the packing requirement is for a minimum thickness at the conclusion of driving. To ensure compliance excess will need to be inserted at the commencement of driving and it may be necessary to replenish the packing during driving. In any event the packing shall be replaced after driving each pile or more frequently if necessary.
 6. To avoid the possibility of premature `setting-up' pile driving shall be continuous in the latter stages without deliberate stops except as directed by the Superintendent. Delays of as little as 15 minutes may lead to significant `set-up' in piles. Where premature `set-up' has occurred the Contractor shall be required to overcome this by continued driving where resistance to penetration may be significantly greater than normal.
 7. The Superintendent may direct that certain selected piles be subject to a `set-up' test. These piles shall be driven as specified and subsequently redriven 24 hours after completion of initial driving. A Provisional Sum is allowed for this operation.
 8. The Contractor shall record the number of blows for each 250mm of pile penetration. Details of each pile driven shall be kept on pile driving record forms as shown in Annexure 811D.

 3. The side of all boreholes shall be kept intact and no loose material shall be permitted to fall into the bottom of the boreholes.
 4. The borehole shall be filled with drilling fluid to a level to sufficiently stabilise the borehole. If drilling fluid alone is not sufficient to prevent the ground water from intrusion or the borehole side walls from collapse, a steel casing of appropriate size and length shall be used in conjunction with the drilling fluid to support the side of the borehole.
 5. If a temporary casing is required to stabilise the borehole, it shall be extended beyond the unstable strata for one meter or more to prevent the inflow of soil and the formation of cavities in the surrounding ground.
 6. If a temporary casing is damaged during installation in a manner which prevents the proper formation of the pile, such a casing shall be withdrawn from the borehole and repaired if necessary, or other measure to be taken to the approval of the Principal or the delegated authority to continue the construction of the pile.
 7. The pile toe shall be founded at the levels shown on the Drawings.
 8. During the installation process, if any of the following scenarios occur, the Principal or the delegated authority shall determine the need for further deepening of the pile shaft:
 a. The pile excavation refuses at a level above the specified toe level;
 b. Where the distance between the bottom of the steel casing which is going to be left in place and the toe level is less than the minimum socked length shown on the drawings;
 c. The ground condition varies from that assumed at design stage or as shown in borehole logs completed during geotechnical investigation.
 9. If additional excavation is ordered to continue, the Principal or the delegated authority shall decide when the founding level is satisfactory, and the pile shaft can be prepared for concreting.
 812.29 CLEANING AND INSPECTION OF BOREHOLE
 1. Upon completion of boring, the pile holes shall be cleaned of all loose, disturbed soil and sediment soil to expose a firm base of undisturbed material using a suitable and effective method to be approved by the Principal or the delegated authority.
 2. Where practicable, all boreholes shall be inspected for their full length prior to concreting to ensure the cleaning has been properly carried out; the sides are able to remain stable during subsequent installation of reinforcement cage and concreting operations; and the verticality and position of the boreholes meet the specified tolerances.
 3. The Piling Contractor shall provide all necessary apparatus for the inspection to be carried out safely.

 812.30 PLACEMENT OF REINFORCEMENT
 1. The reinforcement cage shall be free from oil, rust or debris and straight. It shall not be placed until inspected and accepted by the Principal or delegated authority.
 2. Reinforcement must be carefully aligned as shown on the drawings to allow the satisfactory construction of the pile caps.
 3. Spacer skids with contact width of not less than 35mm must be used for the installation of reinforcement to ensure maintenance of cover requirements as specified on the drawings. Not less than 4 spacer skids shall be provided evenly around the perimeter of the pile at a vertical spacing of not less than 2 meters.
 4. Reinforcement cages and spacers shall be sufficiently robust to withstand the forces during lifting, placing of the concrete and extraction of temporary casings.
 5. The cage shall be kept vertical or at the required batter angle (if applicable) during installation.
 6. In addition to any weld details shown in the approved drawings, welding of reinforcement is required to form a robust cage. Each ligature must be connected to at least on main bar, and each main bar to at least one ligature to form electrical connectivity to allow for future cathodic protection.
 7. If the reinforcement cage cannot be placed to the specified depth, the cage must be removed and the pile re-drilled.
 812.31 CONCRETING
 1. Immediately after the completion of boring, approval to commence concreting shall be sought and, when this has been obtained, concreting shall start forthwith.
 2. Placing and compaction of concrete shall be in accordance with Specification 820 CONCRETE FOR STRUCTURES.
 3. Concreting must be continuous to achieve monolith from the top to the base of the pile, without segregation and free of entrapped debris.
 4. Concreting shall be continued to 300 mm above the designed pile cut off level to ensure any contaminated concrete is removed. A temporary casing may be required to achieve the concreting level.
 5. Any ground water must be displaced during concreting operations.
 6. The volume of concrete used in the pile shall be determined to an accuracy of 5% and recorded. The measured volume of concrete placed in any pile shall be not less than 105% of the nominal volume of the pile.

 7. If the recorded volume of the concrete placed in the borehole indicates a possible necking, the Piling Contractor shall propose and carry out appropriate tests and measures to demonstrate the adequacy of the pile, or appropriate remedy work to the approval of the Principal or delegated authority.
 
 812.32 CASING EXTRACTION
 
 1. Withdraw of any temporary casing shall be carried out whilst the concrete still fluid and has a slump close to that while concreting so that no concrete is lifted.
 
 2. When casings are withdrawn as concreting proceeds, a sufficient head of concrete shall be maintained to prevent the entry of ground water. Concrete shall be placed continuously as the casing is extracted until the desire head of concrete is obtained.
 
 3. Temporary casings may be left in place provided that the designed geotechnical capacity (i.e. provided by bond between rock and concrete) is not compromised in any way by the steel casings left in place and the minimum cover to reinforcement specified on the drawings is satisfied.
 
 4. If a temporary casing is left in place, any lifting lugs or other attachments shall be removed and any gaps between the casing and the sides of excavations shall be filled with sand which shall be compacted by flooding.
 
 812.33 PILE CUT-OFF
 
 1. The Piling Contractor shall trim the tops of pile to elevations indicated on the design drawings prior to construction of the pile caps. All contaminated and weak concrete or laitance must be removed to expose sound concrete over the full cross sectional area of the pile during trimming.

 Forming a Rock Socket
 
 813.32 PILE DRIVING EQUIPMENT
 
 1. Piles shall be held in fixed leads such that the hammer and a braced follower follow the pile and provide support throughout the entire driving period. The use of swinging leads shall not be permitted.
 
 Equipment
 
 2. In general the choice of the hammer shall be in accordance with the recommendations of Clause 7.3.3 of AS 2159 and shall develop a rated energy of not less than that specified in Annexure 813A.
 
 3. A helmet and packing to suit the approved hammer and pile shall be used at all times during driving. The specification for the driving dolly and packing is given in Clause 813.33.
 
 4. At least 7 days prior to driving of piles, the Contractor shall submit details of the proposed Hammer to be used, including:
 
 HOLD POINT
 
 a. Energy rating of hammer
 
 b. Details of helmet and dolly
 
 c. Mass of ram and total mass of hammer
 
 d. Method of determining the efficiency of the hammer during pile installation.
 
 813.33 PITCHING AND DRIVING
 
 1. Piles shall be pitched accurately in position prior to the commencement of driving.
 
 2. Prior to driving any piles, the Contractor shall supply to the Superintendent certification that the piles comply in all respects with the requirements of the Specification.

 5. The driving has been designed assuming the details shown in Annexure 813A. The Contractor should note that the packing requirement is for a minimum thickness at the conclusion of driving. To ensure compliance excess will need to be inserted at the commencement of driving and it may be necessary to replenish the packing during driving. In any event the packing shall be replaced after driving each pile or more frequently if necessary.
 
 6. To avoid the possibility of premature `setting-up' pile driving shall be continuous in the latter stages without deliberate stops except as directed by the Superintendent. Delays of as little as 15 minutes may lead to significant `set-up' in piles. Where premature `set-up' has occurred the Contractor shall be required to overcome this by continued driving where resistance to penetration may be significantly greater than normal.
 
 7. The Superintendent may direct that certain selected piles be subject to a `set-up' test. These piles shall be driven as specified and subsequently redriven 24 hours after completion of initial driving. A Provisional Sum is allowed for this operation.
 
 8. The Contractor shall record the number of blows for each 250mm of pile penetration. Details of each pile driven shall be kept on pile driving record forms as shown in Annexure 813E.
 
 813.34 INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
 
 1. The level of the natural surface at each pile location shall be determined prior to the Contractor commencing works necessary for the installation of each pile casing.
 
 2. The Contractor's attention is drawn to the requirements for installing the pile casings - in particular, the nature of the material as shown on the bore logs and the potential to intersect ground water during the installation procedure. Depending on the installation method used, it may be that there will be a need to excavate within and ahead of the casing during driving to breakout and remove difficult material in order to attain the pile casing toe level specified on the Drawings or such level as approved by the Superintendent.
 
 3. Where pile casings are driven to rock the pile casing is required to be driven Casings to Rock into the underlying bedrock to create a seal. Rock sockets, where shown on the Drawings, shall be constructed in the dry.
 
 4. Where rock sockets are shown, the Contractor is required to drill into the bedrock to construct the rock socket as detailed on the Drawings.
 
 Rock Sockets
 
 5. Prior to driving or placing any pile casing, the Contractor shall supply to the Superintendent certification that the plan position and alignment of the casings comply with the requirements of the Specification.

 Specification 813 Cased Piles  04/10122 Issued 05/09/2017
 6. Where rock sockets are required, the indicative toe level of the rock sockets shall be shown on the Drawings. The Superintendent shall specify the final level to which the rock socket is to be drilled. This level shall be a minimum distance into solid bedrock and a minimum distance below the bottom of the pile casing whichever is the deeper as detailed on the Drawings. The Superintendent will take into consideration any irregularities and/or inclination of the surface of the bedrock when determining the final level.
 7. The Contractor shall ensure that the drill head remains on line when it commences to construct the rock socket in the underlying bedrock. The pile shaft shall be cleaned of all loose material and pumped free of water in readiness for inspection and construction of the piles.
 8. When the toe level of the rock socket has been reached, the pile shaft shall be inspected by the Superintendent in the dry for acceptance before preparation for construction.
 9. All piles shall be constructed in the dry. Concrete for piles constructed in the dry shall be compacted using immersion vibrators in accordance with the "Compaction" Clause of Specification 820 CONCRETE FOR STRUCTURES.
 10. In the event that a pile casing or pile casing including rock socket takes in water after being installed/drilled, then the concrete shall be placed by use of a tremie or other under water concrete placement techniques approved by the Superintendent.
 11. The tremie or other Superintendent approved means of discharge shall be operated in a manner to ensure a continuous and uniform discharge flow of concrete below the surface of the fresh concrete for the whole of the pour in each pile casing. The concrete level shall be taken to 500mm above the finished level of concrete in each pile to displace the top section of concrete that is likely to be contaminated.
 12. No agitation or vibration of the underwater concrete during placement shall be permitted.
 13. The top section of concrete and pile casing above the level of the soffit of the pile cap shall be cut back to the levels shown on the Drawings. All contaminated concrete shall be removed in the preparation of the pile head construction joint.
 14. Flame cutting of the pile casings to final level shall not be permitted.
 15. The reinforced concrete piles shall be constructed in accordance with Specification 820 CONCRETE FOR STRUCTURES and Specification 822 STEEL REINFORCEMENT.
 16. The Contractor shall prepare pile heads for bonding into the structure in accordance with the "Construction Joints" Clause of Specification 820 CONCRETE FOR STRUCTURES.
 17. The Contractor shall complete a pile installation record for each pile in accordance with Annexure 813D or 813E.

 813.36 ACCEPTANCE OF PILES
 
 1. Minimum toe RLs for piles shall be shown on the Drawings. For driven steel casings the actual driven length may vary based on the driving performance of the steel casings in each particular foundation. The main criteria in the acceptance of driven casings are that the minimum penetration (pile casing toe RL) and the minimum set as shown in Annexure 813C shall both be attained. For pile casings installed by oscillation acceptance shall be based on the minimum specified toe RLs and the level of the refusal layer.
 
 2. Prior to the completion of the installation of each pile, the Superintendent shall determine the acceptance of the toe level of each pile.
 
 813.37 INTEGRITY TESTING
 
 1. The Contractor shall carry out integrity testing on 50% of all piles and at least one pile at each support pier and abutment, in accordance with AS 2159. Piles giving anomalous results shall be subject to Superintendent approved alternative testing by the Contractor and may be rejected by the Superintendent if they do not comply with the Standard.
 
 Integrity Testing
 
 2. Alternative testing is at the discretion of the Superintendent but shall include static load testing in accordance with AS 2159 to ensure the pile serviceability and ultimate geotechnical strength. All alternative testing shall be at no cost to the Principal.
 
 3. Prior to substructure works commencing, the Contractor shall submit satisfactory written pile test results to the Superintendent for acceptance.

 2. Suitable cutting heads and augers shall be used to auger to the design diameter and depth shown on the drawings. The Piling Contractor shall regularly check that worn components are replaced.
 3. Augering must be carried out at a rate that prevents drawing of the surrounding material laterally into the pile hole.
 4. Automatic continuous measurements shall be made and recorded during the drilling operation including depth of the auger injection point, speed of revolution, penetration per revolution, torque delivered to the auger, and progressive total number of auger revolutions. All measurements must be referenced to (or plotted against) the depth of auger injection point.
 5. If the measurements or records indicate that lateral subsidence of the ground inside the hole has occurred, the Piling Contractor shall immediately stop augering, fill the hole with concrete and then re-drill the pile shaft after the concrete has had its initial set.
 6. If during the installation process the pile auger refuses at a level above the specified toe level, rotation of the auger must be stopped and the Piling Contractor must determine the need for remedial works, in consultation with the Principal or delegated authority.
 814.23 CONCRETING AND WITHDRAWAL OF AUGER
 1. The concreting must commence immediately upon reaching the agreed pile toe elevation. The auger shall be pre-charged with concrete under suitable pre-agreed pressure prior to lifting.
 2. The Piling Contractor shall use construction techniques which minimise disturbance at the pile toe. The auger stem shall be locked against rotation at the commencement of withdrawal. If it is necessary to rotate the auger to ease extraction, the auger must be rotated slowly forward, never reversed.
 3. Lifting of the auger prior to blowing the plug closing off the hollow auger shall be avoided. If and in any case it shall not exceed 75 mm and prior to starting withdrawal, the auger must be re-penetrated to the original pile tip elevation while maintaining pressure on the concrete.
 4. Extraction of the auger must be smooth without jerks, whilst maintaining the required concrete pressure and oversupply at all times. The concrete oversupply must not be less than 5% in accordance with AS 2159.
 5. Concreting must be continuous to achieve concrete that is monolithic from the top of the pile to the base of the design cross section, without segregation and free of entrapped debris.
 6. Any ground water must be displaced during concreting operations.
 7. During auger extraction, if the concrete pressure or oversupply drops to zero or less, note the depth at which this occurred, stop the extraction, reauger to 500 mm below that depth and then recommence the extraction.

 Specification 814 Continuous Flight Auger Piles  11/349 Issued 11/05/2018
 8. If auger extensions are used, check the level of the concrete in the extensions, which as a minimum must be able to balance the overburden pressure at the discharge point at the tip of the auger. After removing an extension and after reconnecting the auger stem to the drive head, precharge the auger and re-auger one metre down prior to continuing auger extraction.
 9. Continue concrete pumping until the auger tip rises to the working platform level or 300 mm above the designed pile cut off level, whichever is higher. A form at the pile top extending above the working platform shall be applied where it is necessary to achieve the required concreting level.
 10. On completion of concrete placing and prior to reinforcement cage installation, the top of the pile shall be cleared of debris and any contamination shall be removed.
 11. As a minimum, continuous automatic measurements must be made and recorded during the withdrawal and concreting operation for extraction rate (m/minute), volume and oversupply of concrete, flow profile, concrete pressure, auger revolution (if any, but not preferred), and depth of the injection point. All measurements must be referenced to (or plotted against) the depth of auger injection point.
 12. The equipment and the concrete pump efficiency shall be calibrated in advance for each concrete mix to be used to ensure the accuracy of the reported concrete volumes to within 5%.
 814.24 PLACEMENT OF REINFORCEMENT CAGE
 1. The reinforcement cage shall be free from oil, rust or debris and straight. It shall not be placed until inspected and accepted by the Superintendent or delegated authority.
 2. The reinforcement cage shall be ready to be inserted immediately after concreting.
 3. Reinforcement must be carefully aligned as shown on the drawings to allow the satisfactory construction of the pile caps.
 4. Minimum nominal cover to reinforcement shall be 100 mm but cover spacers provided on the bars shall be 25 mm less than the nominal cover to facilitate insertion of the cage.
 5. Prior to placement, check the reinforcement cage to ensure that it is clean and straight. Cages may be worked into the concrete by hand, supplemented by the use of approved vibratory drive head where required. Driving or hammering using plant is not permitted. Keep cage vertical during installation.
 6. Spacers and ties shall be sufficiently robust to withstand the forces and vibration needed to install the reinforcement cages.
 7. If the reinforcement cage cannot be placed to the specified depth, the cage must be removed and the pile re-augered and re-concreted. Re-use of the cage is permitted only if it is recovered to meet all requirements as per items 1 to 5 and Clause 814.09 of this specification.

 OPERATIONS
 819.26 GENERAL
 1. Falsework shall be designed and constructed so that on completion of the permanent Works the concrete levels are as shown on the Drawings. To achieve this objective the levels of the falsework shall be set to allow for any settlement and deflection accompanying casting of the concrete.
 2. In the event that falsework settles under load to such an extent that the allowable tolerances on the finished concrete work are exceeded then the concrete shall be removed and the falsework modified so that the finished work is in accordance with the Drawings. The cost of such remedial works shall be at no cost to the Principal.
 819.27 SAFETY
 1. All falsework shall comply with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Regulations 1996.
 819.28 DESIGN
 1. The design of all falsework shall be in accordance with AS 3610, and shall be adequate in every way for the loads it is required to support and to meet the requirements specified in Clause 819.26.
 2. Falsework shall be designed to permit shrinkage of concrete and movements due to temperature and to allow for any special conditions likely to occur during construction including but not limited to the redistribution of load due to the effects of staged construction and prestress.
 3. Falsework shall be designed and erected in such a manner that the loads are accepted in accordance with the loading assumptions made. All permanent structures such as piers and abutments which are adjacent to or surrounded by falsework shall be adequately protected to ensure that they are not damaged during the Contract.
 4. Foundations for falsework shall be designed to prevent excessive settlement and rotation of supports. Foundation materials which are soft and compressible or which may be subject to erosion by water shall be removed and replaced with a suitable foundation. Falsework shall not be supported or braced from the permanent structure unless it can be shown that such temporary loading will not affect the integrity of the structure.

 Testing When Directed
 
 2. Costs for such testing will be met by the Principal.
 
 3. The purpose of the tests will be to prove the structural adequacy of the falsework/formwork system under overload.
 
 819.29.02 LOAD TESTING OF FALSEWORK
 
 1. The load shall be applied using kentledge. The load shall be equivalent to 1.25 times the actual weight of the concrete plus a construction live load of 0.75kN per square metre.
 
 Kentledge
 
 819.29.03 TEST DURATION
 
 1. The full test load shall be applied for at least twenty four hours during which time the Contractor will determine the displacement of the falsework resulting from the application of the test load. The acceptance of the system shall be subject to it sustaining no structural damage under the test load and it being adequate such that the profile of the soffit surface after pouring the concrete shall be in accordance with the Drawings and the Formwork Tolerances.
 
 Tolerances
 
 819.29.04 NON-CONFORMANCE
 
 1. If any section of the falsework under the test load displaces such that the Retesting a nonprofile of the cast concrete soffit will not be within the tolerances specified or conformance if the falsework under the test load shows signs of structural distress then the Contractor shall make the necessary modifications to the falsework tested and to all other areas which would be similarly defective. The Contractor shall then carry out a further test load on an area of the modified falsework in accordance with this Specification. The costs of all modifications and retesting shall be at no cost to the Principal.
 
 819.30 REMOVAL
 
 1. After completion of the permanent works the Contractor shall dismantle all falsework and remove it from the site.

 CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
 The following clauses are to be placed under the CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS, as required. After inserting the clause, change the clause number and heading to style "H2 SP" so it appears in the Table of Contents.
 819.91 FALSEWORK IN RIVER BEDS
 1. The Contractor is advised that the river may flow during the contract period and shall make due allowance for this in Falsework design. When carrying out repair or replacement of half caps Falsework for the deck may be supported off existing piles.
 819.92 SUPPORTING EXISTING ABUTMENTS
 1. Where the height of abutments under repair exceeds 1.5m measured from the base of any excavation works, the abutment shall be adequately propped to resist full active lateral soil pressure, including any surcharge.
 819.93 SUPPORTING TIMBER DECKS
 1. When carrying out repair or replacement works to supporting half caps and piles all associated stringers or corbels shall be adequately supported. Props shall be designed and so positioned to resist the full dead load of the deck and any traffic permitted over the bridge during construction. These loads shall be calculated in accordance with AS 5100.
 819.94 STEEL BEAM BRIDGES
 1. Steel beams shall be supported on the bearings before casting the deck diaphragms. Permanent deck formwork can be supported on the beams. The bottom flanges of beams shall be set parallel to the top surface of the bearings.
 2. The Contractor shall provide adequate temporary bracing for the beams to prevent rotation, lateral and longitudinal movements due to superimposed loads and temperature during construction. The attention of the Contractor is specifically drawn to the possibility of temperature differentials across the beams causing lateral displacements.
 3. Beams may require pulling into line to conform to the construction tolerances specified.
 4. The welding to or drilling of holes in the beam flanges for attaching temporary bracings or supports shall not be permitted.
 819.95 PRECAST BEAM BRIDGES
 1. The bottom flanges of the beams shall be set parallel to the top surface of the bearings and be supported on softwood timber packers. These timber packers shall be removed only after the deck diaphragm concrete has achieved the nominated compressive strength as given on the Drawings.
 2. The Contractor shall provide adequate temporary bracing for the beams to prevent rotation and lateral movement due to superimposed loads.

 CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
 The following clauses are to be placed under the CONTRACT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS, as required. After inserting the clause, change the clause number and heading to style "H2 SP" so it appears in the Table of Contents.
 820.91 STEAM CURING
 820.91.01 GENERAL
 1. This section of the Specification covers the curing of precast concrete units in an atmosphere saturated with water vapour at a pressure not exceeding atmospheric pressure.
 2. The method of control and the proposed curing cycle to achieve the specified concrete compressive strength are the responsibility of the Contractor, but shall be in accordance with this Specification.
 3. The Contractor shall take measures to allow for the potential lower 28-day compressive strength obtained from test cylinders cured initially under in-situ conditions, as compared to those cured in accordance with the requirements of AS 1012.
 820.91.02 STEAM COVERS
 1. To prevent drying out, steam covers shall be placed over the units immediately following the casting and screeding operations in such a manner as to ensure free circulation of the steam around the concrete mass.
 820.91.03 CURING CYCLE
 1. After an initial "maturity" of 40C hours, but not less than 2 hours after batching the last batch of concrete for the units, steam shall be admitted to the steam covers at such a controlled rate that the maximum average temperature rise shall not exceed 24C per hour and the temperature rise in any one 15 minute period shall not exceed 6C. (Note: The initial "maturity" period is calculated by dividing 40C hours by the concrete temperature of the last batch of concrete placed in the unit. The concrete temperature is as measured on an indicating thermometer).
 2. If the admission of steam to the steam covers is delayed by more than the initial specified "maturity" of 40C hours after the completion of placing of concrete, water curing, shall be applied until steaming commences.
 3. Steaming shall continue at a rate such that the temperature rise shall not exceed 24C per hour, until a temperature under the steam covers of not greater than 70C has been reached. The steam supply shall then be reduced to maintain the temperature at 65  5C.

 Page 28 of 34
 
 Specification 820 Concrete for Structures  04/10134 Issued 12/06/2018
 4. After the elapse of sufficient time at the maximum temperature for the required concrete properties to have been reached, steam shall be completely shut down. Steam covers shall not be removed nor any part of the concrete units and test cylinders disturbed in any way until the temperature under the steam covers has fallen to within 30C of the ambient temperature. The rate of loss of temperature under the steam covers after shutting off steam shall not exceed 24C per hour.
 820.91.04 TEMPERATURE CONTROLS
 1. Temperature shall be recorded by means of recording thermometers. The temperature sensitive parts of the thermometers shall be so positioned under the steam covers as to record the minimum temperature under the covers. One recording thermometer shall be used for each unit or group of units in line up to a total length of 25m. For greater lengths, additional recording thermometers shall be used and the distance between the temperature sensitive parts of the thermometers shall not exceed 25m.
 2. The recording thermometers shall be set in operation immediately upon completion of casting and screeding.
 3. Charts shall not be removed from any recording thermometers, nor the recording thermometers disturbed or moved in any way until after the removal of the steam covers.
 4. Charts from temperature recording thermometers shall be retained.
 5. The following information shall be recorded on the chart:
 a. date on which steaming commenced;
 b. unique identification and description of concrete unit;
 c. temperature correction, if any;
 d. time correction, if any;
 e. batching of concrete;
 f. temperature of concrete when placed;
 g. ambient temperature at time of removal of steam covers; and
 h. Name of Contractor and manufacturer.
 820.91.05 STEAM DELIVERY
 1. Under no circumstances shall steam jets be allowed to impinge upon any part of the concrete units or of a test specimen, or of their formwork or moulds. Neither shall any steam delivery pipe be attached directly to any formwork nor moulds in such a manner as may cause localised overheating of the concrete.

 Specification 820 Concrete for Structures  04/10134 Issued 12/06/2018
 2. Sufficient steam jets or steam entry points shall be provided to ensure that a substantially uniform temperature is maintained under the steam covers such that the difference in temperature between any two points adjacent to the concrete units is not more than 10C.
 820.91.06 EXTENT OF STEAM CURING
 1. Unless otherwise specified, steam curing shall be continuously applied until at least the 7 day compressive strength for the specified concrete grade is obtained.
 820.91.07 PARTIAL STEAM CURING
 1. Where steam curing is used only to obtain sufficient compressive strength for removal of forms or for lifting, curing shall be continued by one or a combination of the methods specified in Clause 820.56, for a minimum period of 7 days.
 820.91.08 CURING OF TEST CYLINDERS
 1. Concrete compression test cylinders shall be placed near the concrete units, and shall be so positioned under the steam covers as to be midway between 2 adjacent points of steam entry, subject always to their being no closer to any points of steam entry than half the width of the concrete units. Test cylinders shall be positioned in a group at the lower face of the concrete unit and shall in no case be placed on top of the concrete unit or its formwork.
 2. Test cylinders shall remain in position under the steam covers until the steam curing cycle is complete. Test cylinders shall be suitably covered in such a way as to minimise moisture and temperature losses between the time of removal from the steam covers and the time of forwarding to an accredited laboratory for testing. Cylinders shall be transported in moisture proof containers.

 820.92 MATURITY TESTING
 820.92.1 GENERAL
 1. Subject to the Superintendent's approval, the contractor may be permitted to undertake Maturity Testing to determine the strength development of the concrete subjected to accelerated curing, for the purpose of facilitating early lifting of precast units or early application of loading.
 2. The contractor shall submit the following for review to the Superintendent at least 10 working days prior to concreting:
 a. Purpose for test and strength(s) required for the application.
 b. The proposed procedure to develop the Strength-Maturity Relationship Curve with the corresponding strength required.
 c. The methodology of maturity testing and documenting procedures.
 d. The proposed temperature recording device to be used to monitor the concrete temperature and the locations where the sensors (a minimum of two sensors) will be placed.
 e. The proposed equipment and controls used for Maturity Testing of specimens to develop the relationship.
 f. The period of testing.
 g. The methodology for validation testing.
 h. Any documented evidence of previous performance of tested samples, including accuracy and deviations.
 3. The constituents of the concrete test samples shall be the same used in construction; this includes the mix proportions, preparation and production of the concrete. Any deviations in manufacturing the concrete may reduce the accuracy of the Strength-Maturity Curve.
 4. Strength-Maturity Relationship Curves shall be created for each project specific application and mix designs.
 820.92.2 DEVELOPING THE STRENGTH-MATURITY FUNCTION
 1. A minimum of 20 specimens for either cylindrical or flexural beam test specimens shall be cast from the same concrete mixture used for construction.
 2. Thermocouples or any approved maturity recording device shall be embedded within 15 mm centrally of at least two specimens.
 3. Compressive strength testing shall be taken at maturity ages of 1, 3, 7, and 28 days.

 Specification 820 Concrete for Structures  04/10134 Issued 12/06/2018
 4. Unless otherwise determined from laboratory testing, the datum temperature, To, may be taken as 0C.
 5. If results of one specimen has a difference of 10% or greater, the specimen shall be discarded and the average of the two other specimens shall be used. However, a new Strength-Maturity Relationship shall be created if the difference of two or more specimens varies by more than 10%.
 6. Once the Strength-Maturity Relationship has been determined, it shall be reduced by 5%.
 820.92.3 ESTIMATING THE IN-PLACE STRENGTH
 1. The contractor shall nominate a suitable inspector with experience in Maturity Testing who shall be present at the concrete batch plant to monitor the batching process.
 2. A minimum of two temperature sensors per element shall be installed at the locations approved by the Superintendent. It is recommended that one temperature sensor be located centrally of the concrete member and the other within the concrete cover. Installation of additional sensors at alternative locations may be required to increase the accuracy of strength estimation.
 3. Temperature sensors shall not be in direct contact with any steel that may affect the temperature recorded by the sensor.
 4. The maturity recording device shall immediately start recording after the concrete placement. Temperatures shall be recorded every 0.5 hours for the first 48 hours and every hour thereafter up until the strength required has been achieved.
 5. The concrete shall have reached its required design strength once results indicate the strength is equal to or greater than the Strength-Maturity Relationship at the same maturity index.
 820.92.4 VERIFICATION OF THE STRENGTH-MATURITY RELATIONSHIP
 1. Strength verification testing shall be required - for the determination of the maturity index of the specified application. A minimum of three specimens shall be cast from the concrete that is used in the structure and shall be cured in the same conditions.
 2. If the percent error of the measured verification strength is equal to or less than 5% of the estimated strength, then the Strength-Maturity Relationship shall be considered valid. Similarly, the Strength-Maturity Relationship shall be considered invalid if the percent error is greater than 5%. A new Strength-Maturity Relationship shall then be created. Until a new relationship has been developed, standard compressive strength testing shall be required for determining early age concrete strength required.

 4. Tendons shall be assembled using methods and equipment which ensure that individual wires or strands are not kinked and that they maintain approximately the same relative position to the other wires and strands in the tendon. The wires and strands of the assembled tendon shall be bound at regular intervals, in such a manner that twisting of the tendon is minimised and no damage will be done to the tendon when it is installed.
 5. For the button headed tendons, composed of wires or strands the individual wires or strands in each tendon shall be so laid out that the uniformity of length can be inspected.
 824.26.03 MINIMUM COVER
 1. Unless otherwise specified on the Drawings, the concrete cover to any duct, sheathing or former shall not be less than 50mm.
 824.26.04 PULLING OF TENDONS AND PUSHING OF STRANDS
 1. The pre-assembled tendons shall be pulled through the ducts using a form of pulling sock or cable leader so that no damage is done to the sheathing.
 2. Notwithstanding the above paragraph and if requested by the Contractor, consideration will be given to pushing the strands through the ducts individually, provided the Contractor can demonstrate conclusively to the satisfaction of the Superintendent, that this procedure will not be detrimental to the strength and safety of the tendon during and after stressing.
 3. The demonstration shall prove that, under the proposed pushing procedure, there will be no risk of sheathing being stripped and forming blockages in the duct, or of the strands becoming interlocked and developing internal friction points, which may cause differential overstress and even failure during stressing, and particularly during the additional extensions associated with temporary de-stressing operations.
 824.26.05 PRECAUTIONS DURING AND AFTER CONCRETING
 1. During concreting the Contractor shall ensure that all cable sheaths and associated anchorages and coupling devices and grout vents are maintained in position.
 2. Where the Contractor elects to have sheathing concreted in before the prestressing cables are installed, black polythene tube liners shall be inserted into the complete length of the sheathing to provide adequate support and stiffness during the concreting operations.
 3. The Contractor shall remove the polythene tube liners 24 hours after the concrete has attained its initial set.
 4. Immediately after all the concrete has been placed in the element, any installed tendons or continuous tubing shall be pulled back and forth about 0.25m to ensure they are perfectly free inside the duct.
 824.26.06 SPECIAL PROVISION FOR HIGH TENSILE BARS
 1. The exposed threads of all bars, nuts and couplers shall be fully protected on site at all times until stressing is completed.

 2. Each set of bars, nuts and couplers shall be trial assembled prior to installation. The bars shall be suitably marked and/or a suitable system of reference marks established in the adjacent concrete so that it can be confirmed by visual inspection that each end of each bar is fully engaged in its corresponding nut or coupler.
 3. The Contractor shall submit details of the proposed procedures for ensuring that all bars are fully engaged during installation, including the method of confirming this by inspection prior to stressing.
 4. The Contractor shall submit these proposed procedures to the Superintendent for approval at least 5 working days prior to the commencement date for installing bars. No bars shall be installed until the Superintendent has released this HOLD POINT.
 824.27 PREPARATION FOR STRESSING
 824.27.01 STRESSING EQUIPMENT
 1. The prestressing equipment comprising pump, jack and pressure gauges shall be calibrated every 12 months unless there is reason to doubt their accuracy, in which case, a recalibration shall be carried out.
 2. Dual working gauges shall be used at all times as a safeguard against gauge failure.
 3. Gauges and scales shall permit force and elongations respectively to be determined within an accuracy of 2%. Pressure gauges shall be concentric scale industrial gauges of nominal size above 100mm complying with the requirements of AS 1349.
 824.27.02 CLEANING TENDON DUCTS
 1. Tendon ducts and grout vents shall be cleaned out by blowing oil-free compressed air through them. Anchorages shall be thoroughly cleaned prior to commencement of tensioning. The protruding ends of tendons shall be cleaned of any coating, rust, mortar, oil, or mud, which may have accumulated since placing and which would lessen the grip of wedges or of anchorage devices.
 2. Where the bearing plate has been previously cast in concrete, any misalignment of the plate shall be compensated for prior to stressing.
 824.27.03 CONCRETE STRENGTH TESTING
 1. In addition to test cylinders submitted for acceptance testing, the Contractor shall take test cylinders as required below for determination of the concrete strength prior to prestressing.
 2. A pair of test cylinders shall be taken from each batch or load of concrete which is placed around or close to the anchorages. Also, a pair of test cylinders shall be taken from every 30 cubic metres or part thereof of the remaining concrete in the member.

 b. applicable test identification No.
 c. stressing length of tendon (including jacking length)
 d. frictionless extension of tendon at proposed jacking force
 e. calculated loss of extension due to friction and curvature of duct
 f. anticipated actual elongation at proposed jacking force
 3. The anticipated elongation versus load (during stressing) shall be plotted in a form which can be used to compare actual elongations against the preplotted anticipated values as the operation proceeds.
 824.28 STRESSING OPERATIONS
 824.28.01 SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
 1. Care shall be taken during tensioning to ensure the safety of all personnel engaged on the work and of other persons in the vicinity. Jacks shall be secured in such a manner that they will be restrained if a tendon failure occurs. No person shall be allowed to stand behind the jacks while tensioning is in progress. The operation of the jacks, the measurement of the elongation and associated operations shall be carried out in such a manner and from such positions that the safety of all concerned is ensured.

 824.29.03 AIR TESTING OF DUCTS BEFORE GROUTING
 1. Air testing of ducts before grouting shall be carried out under the supervision of the specialist stressing personnel.
 2. Any water in the duct shall first be blown out with oil-free air.
 3. After sealing the anchorage ends, each duct shall be tested as follows:
 i. With all valves closed, pressurise the duct at the inlet with oil-free air to 250kPa to confirm the installed system has sufficient integrity for grouting.
 ii. Hold the pressure at 250kPa for 30 seconds. A sudden drop in pressure of more than 100kPa, or a need to continuously inject compressed air to maintain pressure indicates that the system is not sufficiently sealed for grouting. All leaks shall be located and repaired and the test repeated.
 iii. Reduce the pressure to 100kPa.
 iv. Lock off the air source.
 v. Record the air pressure loss over time. A pressure loss greater than 40% shall not be permitted within a duration of D = (1.1V + 5)/60, where D = duration in minutes and V = volume of the duct minus the strand volume, in litres.
 4. If the pressure loss over time is greater than 40%, a thorough inspection and repairs shall be undertaken prior to re-test.
 5. Where air testing detects leakage between two adjacent ducts that cannot be practically rectified, both shall be air tested together as a single system and then shall be grouted simultaneously with two lines controlled by individual lock off valves.
 6. If the air loss criterion cannot be achieved after rectifying all detected leakages, assessment shall be undertaken by the specialist stressing personnel to determine whether grouting can proceed and approval shall be sought from the Superintendent before proceeding.
 824.29.04 GROUTING EQUIPMENT
 1. The mixing equipment shall be of a type capable of producing a uniform suspension of cement in water.
 2. The injection shall be capable of continuous operation with minimum variation of pressure and shall include a system for recirculating the grout whilst grouting is not in progress.
 3. The grout pump shall be capable of delivering grout at a rate of 1800 litres per hour at pressures up to 1.0MPa. All piping to the grout pump shall have a minimum of bends and valves and changes in diameter. All baffles to the pump shall be fitted with 1.18mm sieve strainers.

 4. A standby grout pump shall be made available on site for use at all times during grouting operations.
 5. All equipment shall be thoroughly washed through with clean water after every series of operations and more frequently if necessary. The intervals between washings shall not exceed three hours.
 824.29.05 MIXING OF GROUT
 1. Water shall be added to the mixer first then Portland Cement. Mixing shall continue for at least two but not more than four minutes until a uniform consistency is obtained. Only as much grout as may be used in one hour shall be mixed in any batch. The Contractor shall ensure that each batch of grout is mixed to the same consistency.
 824.29.06 GROUTING PROCEDURE
 1. Before grouting, the volume of grout required for each duct shall be determined for use as a basis for control of volumes and rates of grout injection.
 2. Grout shall be injected into the sheath from the lowest anchorage in an even continuous flow so that it moves along the sheath at a rate of between 6-12 metres per minute. Filling rates for vertical ducts shall not exceed 5 metres per minute.
 3. When the grout reaches the first grout vent it shall be allowed to flow out until all excess water and air has been expelled from the first portion of the sheath and it is of the same consistency as the injected grout. This grout vent shall then be sealed off and the procedure repeated at the remaining vents until the sheath is completely filled.
 In cases where the sheaths are longer than 100 metres an alternative grouting procedure may be required.
 4. The Contractor shall supply attachments suitable for injecting grout at the anchorages and all intermediate grout outlets for use as required if a blockage occurs during grouting.
 5. After a period of not less than two days the plugs at grout outlets shall be removed and any necessary topping up carried out.
 6. All grout outlet pipes shall be cut off or drilled out as necessary to maintain the specified cover to any metal surfaces. The recess so formed shall be made good with mortar to give a smooth surface flush with the concrete.
 824.30 PROTECTION OF ANCHORAGES
 1. The ends of the tendons shall be cut off with high speed abrasive disc or wheel so as to give, when the recesses are concreted, a minimum of 25mm cover over the tendon stubs. Flame cutting within 300mm of a concrete surface will not be allowed.
 2. Where the ends of the tendons are not to be covered with concrete, a protective coating of epoxy shall be applied in an approved manner to the exposed parts of the anchorage.

 2. Casting methods shall be designed to ensure that no damage occurs to the units. The ends of all units shall be free from any grout loss or honeycombing or cracking or spalling. Units with defects of this nature shall be rejected.
 3. Some beams are required to have holes located in the webs for subsequent attachment of formwork during bridge construction. The location and size of these holes and the number of beams requiring these holes are detailed on the Drawings.
 828.07 FORMWORK
 1. The provisions of Specification 821 FORMWORK shall apply and in addition:
 a. Formwork shall be fabricated from steel with a minimum thickness of 3mm.
 b. Unformed surfaces shall be roughened and shall be free from laitance and loose material which may be deleterious to the bond with the in situ deck concrete. This shall be achieved after curing by scabbling or any other suitable method.
 828.08 REINFORCEMENT
 1. The provisions of Specification 822 STEEL REINFORCEMENT shall apply, except that the tolerance on the minimum clear cover specified shall be 0mm + 5mm in all cases. Any lengths of reinforcement which are left exposed after manufacture shall be coated with cement grout to prevent rusting.
 828.09 PRESTRESS
 1. The provisions of Specification 824 PRESTRESSING OF CONCRETE shall apply with additional provisions as specified below:
 2. The stressing bed shall have the capacity to safely accommodate the forces involved for the pretensioned member being manufactured.
 3. The structural adequacy of a temporary stressing bed shall be certified by an Engineer eligible for Corporate Membership of the Institution of Engineers, Australia. Such certification shall be made available to the Superintendent prior to the commencement of any stressing.
 4. Pressure gauges shall comply with the requirements of AS 1349. The diameter of the gauge shall not be less than 150mm or shall be of such a type which will allow visual reading to the nearest 0.5MPa. The maximum jacking force shall correspond to a gauge pressure between 50 and 90 percent of the gauge capacity. A device shall be fitted to the gauge to protect it against a sudden loss of pressure. Provision shall be made for the attachment of a second gauge.
 5. Calculations to determine the nominated jacking force, nominated elongations, and corresponding gauge pressure shall be carried out for the coils in each lot, using the representative test certificates.

 6. All calculations shall be certified by an Engineer who is eligible for Corporate Membership of the Institution of Engineers, Australia.
 7. Where prestressing strand is to be deflected at tie down points as shown on the Drawings then the steelwork which is cast into the beam to hold the deflected strand shall be hot dipped galvanised in accordance with AS/NZS 4680 and shall be rebated 15mm from the surface of the concrete. The void so formed shall be filled with a compatible colour matching epoxy mortar and brought to a smooth, even finish.
 8. At least one working day prior to the proposed pretensioning of each member or line of members, the Contractor shall submit to the Superintendent stressing calculations, Engineer's certification and the representative test certificates for each member.
 9. The Superintendent will consider the submitted documents for compliance with the Specification, prior to authorising the release of the Hold Point, for each member or line of members.
 10. Strands at the ends of units shall be cut off flush or left protruding as detailed on the drawings. Strands cut off flush shall be coated with epoxy resin to prevent rusting. Strands left protruding shall be coated with cement grout.
 828.10 CONCRETE
 1. The provisions of Specification 820 CONCRETE FOR STRUCTURES shall apply. In addition:
 a. If the Contractor proposes to use external type vibrators for concrete compaction then evidence shall be provided to show that the same level of compaction can be achieved.
 b. Where steam curing is proposed to be used then it shall be low pressure wet steaming and in accordance with Specification 820 CONCRETE FOR STRUCTURES. Any other form of accelerated curing will not be permitted. Steaming shall not commence until at least two hours after the last batch of concrete has been placed. Subsequent curing shall be in accordance with Specification 820.
 828.11 TRANSFER OF PRESTRESS
 1. The Contractor shall use methods that result in a relatively shock free transfer of stress during the release of tendons. Examples of non-complying methods include cutting through with a disk grinder, and severing the tendons directly and quickly with a naked flame.
 2. The transfer of the prestressing force from the stressing bed to the member shall not occur until the concrete has reached the minimum transfer strength specified in the Drawings.
 3. Prior to transfer all tendons shall be checked. All tendons shall be tight.
 4. The slippage of each tendon into the concrete at transfer shall be visually inspected. Localised spalling around fully bonded strands at transfer as a result of excessive slippage shall be identified as a nonconformance.

 a. A magnetic instrument used in accordance with AS 1580 - "Methods of Test for Paints and Related Materials" Method 108.1 except that gauges of the 'Tinsley' type shall not be used.
 or
 b. An instrument operating on the eddy current principle and used in accordance with British Standard 3900 - "Methods of Test for Paints" Part C5.
 835.33.04 PROCEDURE
 1. In order to determine the dry film thickness of each coating the following procedure shall be adopted:

 Page 12 of 18
 
 Specification 835 Protective Treatment of Steelwork  04/10144 Issued 13/12/2018
 a. Dry film thickness gauges shall be calibrated using shims of known thickness set on the blast reference sample. The calibration procedure shall consist of taking not less than 30 readings on the shim on the reference blast sample and from these determining the mean reading. This mean reading shall be subtracted from the known shim thickness to produce a correction factor which shall be added algebraically to all subsequent readings of dry film paint thickness in order to obtain the true "above peaks" value.
 i. Alternatively the gauge itself may be adjusted to yield the appropriate reading equivalent to the known shim thickness. In this case not less than 30 readings shall be taken until the gauge mean reading is equivalent to the known shim thickness.
 ii. This calibration shall be maintained throughout the duration of the contract except where blasting techniques or procedures are varied in which case the calibration procedure shall be repeated.
 b. Readings shall subsequently be taken of the total dry film thickness after the application of each type of coating.
 c. At each stage the Contractor shall use the average reading for that surface.
 d. The dry film thickness for any coating is the difference between the values obtained for this coating and the average total dry film thickness at the completion of the preceding coating.
 e. Film thickness measurements will be taken at random to suit the shape of the area being tested and the number of such measurements shall be given as below:
 i. For large flat surfaces like the webs and flanges of beams the number shall be one per square metre.
 ii. For hand railing panels the number shall be six per linear metre.
 iii. For guard railings the number shall be four per linear metre.
 iv. For guardrail posts the number shall be four per post.
 2. For assessing the compliance of a coating with the thickness requirement of this Specification all measured values of the dry film thickness on each surface shall equal or exceed the specified minimum dry film thickness for that coating. Surfaces not meeting this requirement shall receive further coats of primer or finishing coat as appropriate to build up the paint thickness required.

 835.34 PROTECTION
 
 1. The paint system shall be fully cured before any components are handled. It shall be properly protected during all transport and erection procedures to maintain it in a clean and undamaged condition. In particular proper precautions are to be taken during lifting operations to ensure a minimum of damage is caused by slinging or guying or supporting or similar operations.
 
 835.35 SITE REPAIRS
 
 1. Repairs to areas of damaged paintwork shall be carried out at the time of application of the final finishing coat except that where corrosion of the steel may occur adequate cleaning and protective priming shall be carried out immediately.
 
 2. Areas of paintwork which have been damaged and areas of site welded connections shall be cleaned by power wire brush to AS 1627.2 Class St 3 followed by abrasive paper to provide a surface profile. In addition the edge of the surrounding undamaged paint shall be feathered with abrasive paper.
 
 3. In areas of site welded connections all weld splatter and slag shall be removed by mechanical means and all sharp edges and rough welds shall be rounded off before cleaning.
 
 4. The damaged areas and areas of site welded connections shall then be painted as laid down in Clauses 835.28 to 835.30. The new paint shall overlap the existing paint by at least 50 mm all-round the affected area.
 
 5. Areas of galvanising which have been affected by welding or otherwise damaged shall be thoroughly painted with Zinga Liquid Galvanising or similar approved cold galvanised paint followed by the required amount of finishing paint.

 24mm 65 x 65 x 5
 
 20mm 60 x 60 x 5
 
 16mm 50 x 50 x 3
 
 5. Prior to the installation of all new or replacement connectors into the timber, the inside of each hole shall be sterilised with Boracol 200RH and each bolt shall be coated, and each hole filled with Denso paste.
 6. Bolts and threaded rods shall be tightened to the tightness achievable with an ordinary spanner without crushing the timber under the washer. Following tightening the exposed ends of all bolts and threaded rods shall be coated in Denso paste to facilitate tightening in the future. Further tightening may be required to accommodate creep in the timber.
 850.31 PILE REPAIR
 1. Piles shall be assed to determine the appropriate pile repair type (Type 2, Type 3 or Type 4). Repair details are referenced in MRWA Document No 6702-02-221, Structures Engineering Practice Notes.
 850.31.01 TYPE 2 AND TYPE 3 PILE REPAIRS
 1. Defective piles shall be potted as detailed on the Drawings. Piles that are required to be pottedshall be exposed by excavating below ground level to the depths shown on the Drawings. Working room shall be kept to a minimum.
 2. During pile repair work the bridge superstructure shall be adequately supported in accordance with the requirements of Specification 819 FALSEWORK. Temporary props shall be located on stable ground unaffected by excavations.
 3. Before cutting the timber piles, the location and extent of the deterioration shall be determined by drilling, using 8mm diameter augers. Piles to be repaired, as shown on the Drawings, shall be cut off not less than a minimum of 100mm beyond the location where a 100mm annulus of solid timber is first encountered and any pipe encountered is less than one third of the diameter of the pile. Cuts shall be made square and true to the axis of the pile to ensure steel replacement sections will be located concentric and square to the cut surfaces.

 4. The cut surface at the top of the timber pile shall be given a heavy brushing with the diffusible fungicide Boracol 400RH. Following the fungicide treatment the top surface shall be sealed using Elastoseal Heavy Duty reinforced with Crommlein Polyfabric.
 5. For potted piles, temporary shimming of the suspended section of the pile will be required until the bearing angles at the base of the suspended section are fully installed. This is to ensure full load transfer without deflection of the superstructure. Permanent shimming may be required to ensure full load transfer capacity, as approved by the Superintendent. Shimming shall be undertaken in a manner that does not damage the water proof membrane.
 850.31.02 TYPE 4 PILE REPAIRS
 1. All pier piles nominated as requiring splinting or epoxy repair shall have all bolts and loose rotten material removed from the area of encapsulation. These piles shall be thoroughly cleaned with a high pressure water jet and compressed air. This process shall continue until a quality of wood is exposed that when drilled produces timber particles of 2-3mm length. The newly exposed section shall then be sterilised with Boracol 200RH. At this stage a final assessment shall be made of the pile condition as the removal of unacceptable material on a pile classed as a type C may reveal a type D
 2. The pile classification shall be agreed with the Superintendent prior to commencing corrective action.
 3. Piles classified as type A require no further treatment.
 4. Piles classified as type B shall be wrapped with a 3mm clear acrylic which extends a minimum of 200mm and a maximum of 300mm below the deteriorated zone and a minimum of 200mm and a maximum of 300mm above the deteriorated zone. The bottom of the acrylic wrap shall be fastened as shown on the Drawings and the wrap shall then be filled with Epigen MRD epoxy or similar approved by the Superintendent. The epoxy shall be used in accordance with the manufacturer's published recommendations.
 5. Piles classified as types C and D shall be splinted as shown on the Drawings. The suspended section of pile in a type D repair will require shimming off to ensure full load transfer without deflection of the superstructure.
 6. The splint shall be positioned vertically on the pile with the clearances specified on the Drawings.

 Specification 850 Timber Bridges  04/10145 Issued 19/06//2018
 
 850.93.02 FUNGICIDE TREATMENT OF TIMBER PILES
 
 1. All timber piles requiring fungicide treatment shall firstly be treated with sufficient diffusible boron based fungicide in treatment reservoirs within the piles in the groundline zone to achieve a Boric Acid Equivalent (BAE) in the timber of at least 5 kg/m of timber. The amount of Borate powder or Boracol required to treat each stringer to meet this requirement shall be calculated from the design charts in Document No. 67-02-2226, Preventative Maintenance Standard for Timber Bridges.
 
 Fungicide Piles
 
 2. Where piles have previously been treated at the groundline, the number and location of existing treatment reservoirs shall be checked to determine whether they conform to this requirement and modified as required to suit if they have not been.
 
 3. Where piles have not previously been treated, treatment reservoirs 20mm in diameter shall be drilled at groundline and at 300mm above groundline. Holes shall be drilled downwards into the piles at an angle of approximately 15 degrees to the vertical and be evenly spaced around the perimeter with ground level holes staggered relative to the holes at 300mm above. The maximum practical length of hole that can be drilled in most piles is 500mm, limited by intersection with adjacent holes and drill bit lengths.
 
 4. The number of reservoirs required shall be calculated for each pile based on their measured diameter and the information in Document No. 67-022226, Preventative Maintenance Standard for Timber Bridges. A maximum of 12 treatment holes total shall be drilled in any pile at or around the groundline. For 20mm diameter standard reservoir drill bits the treatment volume is 32ml / 100mm length of hole. Where the required treatment volume cannot be fitted into the available drilled reservoirs during the initial visit, a subsequent treatment shall be carried out by topping up the reservoirs between one and three months after the initial visit.
 
 5. Treatment reservoirs shall only be drilled through sound timber, away from checks and splits. Each reservoir shall be filled with liquid fungicide and if the fluid level drops quickly in a hole due to leakage, the treatment in that hole shall be supplemented with 4 No. 14mm diameter `Polesaver' rods.
 
 6. After treatment each reservoir hole shall be capped with a plastic plug of the same colour as specified in Document No. 67-02-2226, Preventative Maintenance Standard for Timber Bridges.
 
 7. The Contractor shall record the treatment (or re-treatment) date for the bridge to enable scheduling for the next treatment. Fungicide usage and batch number of chemical applied shall also be recorded for each pile.
 
 8. Piles in permanent water shall be treated to the waterline zone of each pile, carried out in accordance with Document No. 67-02-2226, Preventative Maintenance Standard for Timber Bridges.
 
 9. Potted piles shall all be scheduled for standard treatment in the zone above the level of the concrete collar, carried out in accordance with the treatment required at ground level.

 850.93.03 FUNGICIDE TREATMENT OF BEDLOGS AND BEARERS
 1. All timber bedlogs and bearers requiring fungicide treatment shall be drilled using 20mm drill bits, with holes drilled at as steep an angle as possible to pass through the centre and pass through into rot zones, typically at the far faces of the bedlog or bearer.
 2. The bedlogs and bearers shall be treated with a slurry consisting of 5.0kg of Solubor powder to 2.90 litres of water or Boracol 400RH pumped into the drilled holes to achieve the dosage rates as shown in Document No. 67-022226, Preventative Maintenance Standard for Timber Bridges.
 3. Hole spacings shall be 0.5m to 1.0m along bedlogs or bearers, located specifically in the vicinity of the areas of dry rot occurring in the bedlogs or bearers.
 4. Sufficient holes and repeat dosages shall be applied to achieve an application rate of 4.5kg of Boric Acid Equivalent (BAE) per cubic metre of timber, based on the actual slurry mixture strength used, hole lengths drilled and actual diameters. If Boracol 400RH is used, the application rate shall be at least 3.0kg/m3 BAE.
 
 850.93.04 FUNGICIDE TREATMENT OF HALFCAPS
 
 1. The halfcap shall be saturated with water one day prior to proposed fungicide treatment to encourage `take up' of hygroscopic Boracol in the treatment to follow.
 
 Fungicide Halfcaps
 
 2. The diffusible boron-based fungicide, Boracol 400RH shall then be applied in brush form to the halfcap, with repeat doses as necessary until a level of Boric Acid Equivalent (BAE) of 3.0 kg/m3 of timber has been achieved in the halfcap. Repeat doses shall be delayed by at least an hour to allow full absorption of each application.
 
 3. Normally 2 or 3 repeat doses will be required to achieve this BAE level. The actual number of applications required to achieve the required BAE level is a function of the timber thickness and the absorption rate of the halfcap. For halfcaps 170mm x 340mm, the total application rate required of absorbed Boracol 400RH to achieve 3.0kg/m3 of BAE has been calculated at 0.31 litres/m.
 
 4. The amount of Boracol 400RH to be applied to the halfcap to achieve the absorbed level of BAE required shall take into account all losses.
 
 850.93.05 DECK DRAINAGE MAINTENANCE
 
 1. Bridges noted as requiring deck drainage maintenance and not requiring construction of a concrete overlay shall have all existing drainage outlets, whether through horizontal holes in timber kerbs or vertically through decks (both known as Scuppers) cleaned out to remove all debris and to allow the continued free flow of drainage water through them.

 Specification 860 Bridge Bearings  04/10146 Issued 13/12/2018
 4. Test loads shall be applied slowly and at a uniform rate. When the specified loading has been attained it shall be maintained steady sufficiently long for a physical examination of the bearing or for two minutes whichever is the greater before unloading. If any damage occurs, then the load and time at which any damage begins to occur shall be recorded.
 860.27.02 COMPRESSION TEST
 1. All bearings shall be loaded individually to 1.5 times the rated load at zero rotation and zero shear given on the Drawings or in the relevant table of the AS 5100.4.
 860.27.03 STABILITY TEST
 1. 50% of bearings of the same capacity and type shall be loaded in pairs under the rated load at zero shear.
 2. Lateral deflections of rectangular bearings shall be recorded in directions parallel to width and length dimensions. One bearing in the pair shall then be rotated through 180 in the horizontal plane. The pair shall then be reloaded with the maximum rated load and the lateral deflection parallel to each dimension again recorded at the same points on the non-rotated bearing. From these two results the lateral deflections for each bearing alone shall be calculated.
 3. In case of bearings which are circular in plan one bearing shall be rotated with respect to the other for a series of equal loads until an orientation producing maximum lateral deflection is located. The bearings shall then be loaded under the maximum rated load and the maximum radial lateral deflection measured. The bearings shall be permanently marked and then reloaded with one bearing rotated through 180 with respect to the other. The lateral radial deflection shall then be measured at the same point on the non-rotated bearing and the lateral deflection for each bearing alone shall be calculated.
 4. Any bearing in which the lateral deflection in any direction under the test load is greater than 5% of the vertical height of the bearing shall be rejected.
 860.27.04 PROOF LOADING
 1. The Contractor shall carry out the tests set out in Table 860.1 on one pair of bearings of each type and capacity. The bearings shall be loaded in stacked pairs in the test apparatus.
 2. During the test described at (b) or (c) in Table.860.1, the net contact area shall be not less than 80% of the unloaded bearing area.

 860.27.05 STIFFNESS
 1. Bearings shall be tested to determine their compressive and shear stiffness.
 2. All bearings shall be tested for compressive stiffness in accordance with Clause D3 of AS5100.4. Testing for compressive stiffness may be carried out in conjunction with the compression test. The mean compressive stiffness of all bearings tested shall be within 15% of the value given in AS 5100.4 and the compressive stiffness of any individual bearing shall be within 15% of the mean.
 3. 50% of bearings of each type, with a minimum of two bearings, shall be tested for shear stiffness in accordance with Clause D4 of AS 5100.4. The shear stiffness of any bearing shall be within 20% of the value given in AS 5100.4.
 860.28 DESIGN OF POT BEARINGS
 1. The bearings shall be free to rotate and to accommodate expansion and contraction of the structure in the directions and to the extents indicated on the Drawings. Throughout the range of movements indicated, the bearings shall be capable of carrying the vertical and lateral loads as set out on the Drawings.
 2. Dimensional requirements of the bearings and arrangements for fixing are given on the Drawings. Variations from these may be acceptable, details must be submitted at time of tender.
 3. Where bearing units are required to permit movements by sliding, the sliding requirement and frictional characteristics shall be in accordance with Clause 14 and Clause 11.2 of AS 5100.4 respectively.
 4. The design of all bearings shall also take into account the combinations of loads and associated criteria specified for the acceptance testing.

 860.29 ACCEPTANCE TESTS FOR POT BEARINGS
 1. Upon completion of manufacture, and before final assembly of all the bearing units, the Contractor must notify the Superintendent in writing that the bearings are ready for inspection. The Superintendent shall inspect the internal components of each bearing unit prior to final assembly of the bearings.
 2. To prevent the possibility of metal-to-metal contact under service conditions, all sliding bearings must be checked after final assembly and there must be a minimum clearance of 2.0mm between any opposed horizontal metal surfaces.
 3. Pot bearing acceptance tests are required and shall be carried out in the presence of the Superintendent at a testing laboratory certified by the National Association of Testing Authorities Australia for the type of bearing and class of test concerned. Load testing shall be in accordance with Clause 13.2 of AS 5100.4 and as outlined below.
 4. Testing shall be carried out on completion of manufacture of all bearing types. The Contractor shall give at least 4 weeks written notice of intention to test bearings to the Superintendent to enable adequate arrangements to be made for inspection.
 5. A minimum of two bearing units from 10 identical bearings, or part thereof, of each type supplied shall be tested by the Contractor in the presence of the Superintendent.
 6. Test loads shall be applied slowly and at a uniform rate. In tests where both vertical and horizontal loads are required, they may be applied simultaneously or independently. Where horizontal and vertical loads are applied independently, the horizontal load shall be applied after the vertical load. When the specified loading has been attained it shall be maintained steady sufficiently long for a physical examination of the bearing or for two minutes, whichever is the greater, before unloading.
 7. Where the pot bearing is a sliding type, the coefficient of friction shall be determined by a separate test under the vertical load from Permanent Effects only. Before determining the coefficient of friction, the bearing sliding surfaces under load shall be moved forward and backward once to bed the surfaces. The horizontal load in the direction of sliding shall be monitored continuously throughout the test. The coefficient of friction shall be determined by the ratio of the horizontal load, measured when the surfaces of the bearing just begin to slide, to the applied vertical load, and shall be the average value from three separate tests. The tests shall be carried out with the PTFE in the unlubricated condition. The maximum measured coefficient of friction must not exceed the values specified in Table 860.2 for the relevant stresses on the PTFE. On completion of testing, the bearing surface shall be lubricated with Dow Corning DC 44 or similar approved by the Superintendent.

 Note: Friction values for intermediate bearing pressures shall be linearly interpolated.
 
 8. Should any bearing exhibit any signs of damage or permanent distortion either during or after test loading or should the horizontal coefficient of static friction exceed the value specified in Clause 860.28, this shall constitute a failure under test and shall be cause for rejection of all bearings of the type represented. Bearings exhibiting any signs of damage or permanent distortion before testing shall be rejected.
 
 9. The satisfactory test performance of any bearing does not preclude it from being rejected if it shows signs of damage or permanent distortion after delivery.
 
 10. All costs incurred in testing shall be borne by the Contractor and considered as incidental to the supply of bearings.
 
 860.30 REJECTION
 
 1. Where a bearing is rejected on the basis of unacceptable test performance, the Contractor may elect to test all bearings of the type represented and only bearings successfully passing the tests may be accepted. In addition all replacement bearings shall be acceptance tested. The cost of all additional testing shall be at no cost to the Principal.
 
 860.31 TRANSPORT AND DELIVERY
 
 1. The Contractor shall take all necessary precautions to prevent damage to the bearings during handling, storage and delivery to site.
 
 2. All elastomeric bearings shall be clearly labelled with the project name, AS Part Number and test number referred to in the test certificate, together with any other relevant information.
 
 3. All pot bearings shall be marked and identified in accordance with Clause 13.3 of AS 5100.4.
