 ABBREVIATIONS, SYMBOLS, TERMS, AND DEFINITIONS
 
 ACTIVE VOICE, IMPERATIVE MOOD, REFERENCES, USE OF LANGUAGE
 
 The New Mexico Department of Transportation publishes this edition of the Standard
 Specifications for Highway and Bridge Construction with an emphasis on the active voice. In a
 sentence written in the active voice, someone acts on something. For example: “The
 Engineer will take a sample.” A similar sentence in the passive voice “A sample will be taken”
 would be unclear about who was responsible for taking the sample.
 This edition of the Standard Specifications also makes use of the imperative mood. The
 imperative mood is used when the party issuing an instruction and the party receiving it are
 already understood.
 In these Standard Specifications, the Department is stating its
 requirements or directions for Work to the Contractor; such statements have the same force
 as if they contained the word “shall.” In an imperative sentence such as, “Pour the concrete,”
 the Department is indicating that it requires the Contractor to pour the concrete. Before an
 Award of a Contract, imperative statements are directed to the Bidder. After a Contract has
 been awarded, imperatives are directed to the Contractor.
 The Department will identify parties other than the Bidder or Contractor to whom it gives
 a responsibility in these Standard Specifications. In phrasings where the responsible party
 has already been clearly identified or in factual statements when it is not important to do so,
 the Department may use the passive voice.
 The word “shall” is used
 Department is imposing a duty
 word “may” is used to signify
 However, use of the term “may

 in a mandatory or imperative sense and signifies that the

 The titles or headings of the sections and subsections herein are intended for
 convenience of reference and shall not be considered as having any bearing on their
 interpretation.
 The Contractor, having an obligation to comply with, observe, and comply with all federal
 and State law and regulations, any reference to any federal or State law or regulation shall
 constitute a reference to any applicable amendment or successor law or regulation.

 102.6 INTERPRETATION OF QUANTITIES
 The quantities appearing in the Bid Schedule, Plans, or other Contract documents are
 approximate only and are prepared for the comparison of Bids. Payment to the Contractor
 shall be made only for the actual quantities of Work performed and Accepted, or Materials
 furnished, or as otherwise specified (e.g., Computed Quantities) in the Contract.
 102.7
 
 EXAMINATION OF CONTRACT,
 PROVISIONS, AND SITE OF WORK
 
 1.
 Section 102:
 
 PLANS,
 
 SPECIFICATIONS,
 
 SPECIAL
 
 The Department will prepare Plans and Specifications in accordance with
 acceptable engineering standards and will give such directions as may enable any
 Bidding Requirements and Conditions
 
 Page 20
 
 competent Contractor to construct the Work. The submission of a Bid shall be
 considered prima facie evidence that the Bidder has exercised Pre-Bid Due
 Diligence and accepts the conditions to be encountered in performing the Work and
 accepts the provisions and requirements of the Contract. The Bidder must so certify
 on the Bid Form for the Bid to be considered a Responsive Bid;
 2.
 
 When available, boring logs and other records of subsurface investigations including
 Borrow, surfacing Material, and other Materials pits may be inspected by the
 Bidders. Bidders are informed that such information is for Department design and
 estimating purposes only. Such information is made available to Bidders so that
 they and the Department have identical access to subsurface information. The
 Department does not warrant the sufficiency of such subsurface investigation
 documentation, and the Department furnishing such subsurface investigation
 documentation does not relieve the Bidder from, at its own expense, performing its
 own site investigation, considering geotechnical data from previous Projects
 performed by the Bidder in the vicinity of the Project, and determining how
 subsurface conditions may affect the means, methods and cost of the Work;
 
 3.
 
 Requests for Contract interpretation shall be in writing, addressed to the Chief
 Engineer, and must be received by the Chief Engineer at least 48 hours prior to the
 date fixed for the opening of Bids in order to receive a written response to the
 request. No interpretation of the meaning of the Contract shall be made to any
 Bidder orally. The Contractor shall not rely on oral statements and shall only rely on
 written responses provided by the Chief Engineer or designate. Any and all such
 interpretation and any supplemental instructions if issued by the Department will be
 in the form of an Addendum or posted to Bid Express. Such Addendum will be
 provided to all prospective Bidders for such purposes and shall, whenever
 practicable, be issued no later than twenty-four (24) hours prior to Bid Opening. The
 Bidder agrees that it will make no Claim because of misinterpretation or
 misunderstanding of the Contract or because of lack of information; and,
 
 4.
 
 The Contractor is not entitled to a written response by the Chief Engineer when
 Contract interpretation requests are received less than 48 hours before Bid
 Opening. If a written response by the Department to a request for Contract
 interpretation is not provided, the Bidder shall Bid the Contract according to the
 Contract documents.
 
 102.8

 Section 102:
 
 Bidding Requirements and Conditions
 
 Page 22
 
 Opening to the official designated by the Department to open and read Bids at the Bid
 Opening.
 Alternatively, the Bidder may submit its Bid electronically in accordance with the Invitation
 for Bids.
 102.13 REVISION OF BIDS
 A Bidder may revise its Bid after submitting it to the Department, provided such revision
 is in writing, facsimile or electronically in portable document format (PDF) and is received by
 the Department before the Bid Opening in accordance with the Invitation for Bids.
 A Bidder may revise electronic Bids anytime before Bid Opening.
 102.14 WITHDRAWAL OF BIDS
 A Bidder may withdraw its Bid after it has been deposited with the Department and before
 the time set for Bid Opening by requesting to do so in person, in writing, by facsimile, or
 electronically in PDF. Once a Bid Opening has commenced at the time and place designated
 in the Invitation for Bids, a Bidder may not withdraw its Bid, except that an opportunity will be
 given prior to the opening and reading of the Bids on each Project for a Bidder to withdraw the
 Bidder’s own Bid for that Project and for any other Projects which have not yet been opened
 and read. Withdrawn Bids shall not be resubmitted.
 Alternatively, the Bidder may withdraw its Bid electronically in accordance with the
 Invitation for Bids.
 102.15
 
 BID OPENING
 
 Bids will be opened and read publicly in the presence of one (1) or more witnesses at the
 time and place designated in the Invitation for Bids. The amount of each Bid and each Bid

 ENGINEER’S ESTIMATE
 
 The Engineer's Estimate shall be confidential and is not subject to the Inspection of
 Public Records Act and shall not be disclosed to, or be subject to inspection by, members of
 the public prior to the Bid Opening. When all Responsive Bids for the Project are received and
 read during the Bid Opening, the Engineer's Estimate for the Project will be publicly disclosed.
 
 Section 102:
 
 Bidding Requirements and Conditions

 SECTION 103:
 103.1
 
 AWARD AND EXECUTION OF CONTRACT
 
 CONSIDERATION OF BIDS
 
 After the Department opens and reads the Bids, a Bid review committee will check the
 extended unit prices and the sum of the extended unit prices and item Lump sums for
 accuracy and compare the resulting Total Bid Amounts. The Department’s Bid Review
 Committee shall review and evaluate Bids for a number of factors, which may include:
 comparison of Bids against the Engineer's Estimate; number of Bids submitted; unbalancing of
 Bids; Bid prices for the Project versus Bid prices for similar Projects; Unit Bid Price differences
 between a Bid, the Engineer’s Estimate, and other Bids; Bid irregularities; whether a Unit Bid
 Price substantially reflects reasonable actual costs plus a reasonable proportionate share of
 the Bidder’s anticipated profit, overhead costs, insurance, and other indirect costs necessary
 to complete that Bid Item; justification for any differences; and, any other factors the
 Department has determined to be in the public’s interest. The results of the completed
 analysis will be available to the public after preliminary Award of Contract.
 If the Bid Item Unit Price is omitted, the Bid Item Price will be divided by the estimated
 quantity, thereby establishing a Bid Item Unit Price. If both the Bid Item Unit Price and the Bid
 Item Price are omitted, the Bid shall be rejected.
 If a discrepancy exists between a Bid Item Unit Price and its extension, the Bid Item Unit
 Price shall govern. If two (2) Contractors submit identical lowest Total Bid Amounts, the
 Department shall determine the successful Bidder by the flip of a coin.
 Mathematical errors in Bid Item Prices or Total Bid Amount shall be corrected by the
 Department during the review of Bids.
 The Department reserves the right to reject any or all Bids, to waive technicalities, or to
 advertise for new Bids if, in the judgment of the Department, the best interests of the public
 and the Department would be promoted thereby. Any or all Bids may be rejected when it is in
 the best interest of the public and the Department at any time prior to execution of the
 Contract. If all Bids are rejected the Department may request a new Invitation for Bids. A
 Department decision to cancel the Award of Contract or to reject all Bids and issue a new
 Invitation for Bids is wholly an exercise of executive discretion not subject to review at an
 informal hearing pursuant to Section 103.3, “Bidding Dispute Resolution Procedures”.
 103.2
 
 AWARD OF CONTRACT
 
 When required by the Department, the Bidder shall submit written answers to the Bidder
 Information Questionnaire. The Department will determine if the Apparent Low Bidder is a
 Responsible Bidder using the answers to this questionnaire. The Department will base its
 decision on whether the Bidder demonstrates adequate financial resources, production or
 service facilities, personnel, service reputation, and experience to make satisfactory delivery of
 the construction described in the Invitation for Bids.
 Except as described in Section 103.3, “Bidding Dispute Resolution Procedures,” the
 Department will Award the Contract within 30 Days after the opening of Bids to the lowest
 Responsible Bidder. This Bidder may agree to a later Award time if requested to do so by the
 Department.
 Unless the Department determines to cancel the Invitation for Bids or to reject all Bids the
 Department will notify the lowest Responsible Bidder in writing that its Bid has been accepted
 and that it has received preliminary Award of the Contract. The Department will provide the
 Contract to be executed by the Contractor and returned to the Department.

 Informal Hearing Procedures
 
 1.
 
 Failure to file a timely protest shall constitute a waiver of the Bidder’s right to protest;
 
 2.
 
 Service of the written protest shall be made only upon the Cabinet Secretary, with a
 copy contemporaneously transmitted and separately served upon the Office of
 General Counsel for the Department, during the Department’s regular Business
 Hours by delivery in person, or by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
 requested, or by delivery by a nationally recognized overnight or same-day courier
 service that obtains receipts. Electronic communication (i.e. e-mail, facsimile) shall
 not be considered. Service of a written protest made after the Department’s regular
 Business Hours shall not be effective until the next business Day. Copies of the
 protest shall be contemporaneously transmitted by the disputing Bidder to every
 Bidder when the protest is served upon the Cabinet Secretary and the Office of
 General Counsel; and,
 
 3.
 
 Any Bidder, other than the disputing Bidder, that considers itself to be an interested
 party to the Bidding dispute may submit a written response to the protest in advance
 of the informal hearing. The response shall include a statement of the requested
 action, a rebuttal of any of the factual matters in the protest, facts supporting the
 response, and any contractual provisions, laws, rules, or regulations, or other

 When a timely protest is filed, the Cabinet Secretary will not proceed further with the
 Award until the dispute is resolved, as detailed below, unless or until the Cabinet
 Secretary determines that the Award of the Contract is necessary to protect the
 substantial interests of the public and the Department. The Cabinet Secretary
 retains the right to cancel the Award of Contract or to reject all Bids and issue a new
 Invitation for Bids when it is in the best interest of the public and the Department;
 
 5.
 
 When a timely protest is filed, the Bids of both the Apparent Low Bidder and the

 The Department will, subject to other provisions in the Specifications, Award the
 Contract within 45 Days of the Bid Opening;
 
 Section 103:
 
 Award and Execution of Contract
 
 Page 25
 
 6.
 
 Within seven (7) Days of receiving a timely Bid protest, the Cabinet Secretary or the
 Cabinet Secretary’s designated informal hearing officer will cause to be delivered by
 mail, postage prepaid, or by facsimile copy or by email transmission a letter notifying
 all parties to the grievance of the date, time and place to appear with all necessary
 material evidence for an informal hearing in the Department’s General Office or
 elsewhere as identified. Such letter shall include a copy of the written protest.
 Whenever practicable the parties shall be afforded at least seven (7) Days notice of
 the scheduled informal hearing. If an informal hearing officer is designated by the
 Cabinet Secretary, the designee shall not be a person who made or approved the
 decision under review or a subordinate of such person during the past 12 months;
 
 7.
 
 The informal hearing officer has absolute discretion in establishing the degree of
 formality for the informal hearing. The formal rules of evidence or civil procedure do
 not apply to the informal hearing. While parties to an informal hearing may call their
 own witnesses they are not afforded the opportunity to subpoena or cross-examine
 witnesses. Parties are permitted to submit documentary evidence and written
 arguments at the informal hearing. Parties may supplement the record or provide
 supplemental written arguments after the initial hearing date provided that such
 Materials are provided to the informal hearing officer at least three (3) Days prior to
 the deadline to issue a determination letter. The presentation of evidence and
 argument may be limited by the informal hearing officer. The informal hearing
 officer shall have the authority to question any party or witness. The informal
 hearing officer may limit the time for oral argument; exclude the participation or
 testimony of any person who becomes belligerent or unruly, or any representative
 who attempts to harass any witness; and, refuse to hear testimony or argument if it
 is cumulative, not relevant or is immaterial to the issues. At disposition, the informal
 hearing officer is not restricted to considering only those documents and testimony
 introduced at the informal hearing but may consider evidence that is reliable,
 accurate, and competently obtained from either party. When such information is
 obtained the hearing officer shall provide it to both parties and provide 24 hours for
 rebuttal before the final decision. The informal hearing officer is responsible for
 maintaining a complete record of the informal hearing including all evidence,
 transcripts of the hearing, and written arguments submitted by the parties. A
 complete record of the testimony and argument at the informal hearing shall,
 whenever practicable, be either stenographically or electronically recorded by a
 certified court reporter or monitor. Transcripts or recordings of the proceeding, if
 available, may be supplied to any party at their own expense upon request to the
 court reporter or monitor;
 
 8.
 
 Within seven (7) Days of the initial hearing date, the Cabinet Secretary or the
 Cabinet Secretary’s designated informal hearing officer will issue a determination
 letter stating the reasons for the action taken and informing the losing party of its
 right, under NMSA 1978, § 13-1-183, to file an appeal in Santa Fe District Court
 within 30 Days of the issuance of the adverse determination. The determination
 letter shall constitute the final Department decision or order;
 
 9.
 
 The Award of the Contract to the lowest Responsible Bidder, based upon the
 Department’s determination letter, shall be conditioned upon the unsuccessful party
 not appealing, under NMSA 1978, § 13-1-183, to the Santa Fe District Court within
 30 Days of receiving the determination letter. The Award letter, if it is mailed within
 45 Days of the Bid Opening, shall bind the lowest Responsible Bidder to accept the
 Contract or to reject the Contract and forfeit the Bid Guaranty it has provided;
 
 10. If an appeal is filed pursuant to NMSA 1978, § 13-1-183, the Department may
 extend the date of the Award letter to a later date as agreed upon by the
 Department and the lowest Responsible Bidder. When such an extension cannot
 be agreed upon or for any other reason, the Department may proceed with the
 Award to the lowest Responsible Bidder if the Cabinet Secretary determines that the
 Award of the Contract is necessary to protect the substantial interests of the public
 and the Department, or may cancel the Award of the Contract, or reject all Bids and
 issue a new Invitation for Bids when it is in the best interest of the public and the
 Department;
 Section 103:
 
 Award and Execution of Contract
 
 Page 26
 
 11. If a Bidder successfully prevails on appeal, a Bidder is limited to one (1) of two (2)
 remedies arising from a Bidding dispute, Award of the Contract or, if the Contract
 can no longer be practicably awarded to the Bidder or it is not in the best interest of
 the public and the Department to Award the Contract to the Bidder, the Contractor’s
 reasonable, documented Bid preparation costs; and,
 12. Each party shall bear its own attorneys fees and costs.
 103.4 CANCELLATION OF AWARD
 The Department may cancel the Award of any Contract or reject all Bids and issue a new
 Invitation for Bids at any time prior to the execution of the Contract by all parties without
 incurring liability where such cancellation is deemed by the Cabinet Secretary to be in the best
 interests of the public and the Department. No Bidder has a contractual, equitable, implied, or
 any other right to the Contract until executed by both parties.
 103.5 RETURN OF BID GUARANTY
 Immediately following the opening and checking of Bids, the Department will return all Bid
 Guaranties submitted in the form of a check, except for those of the two (2) lowest Bidders.
 The Department will return the Bid Guaranty of the unsuccessful of the two (2) lowest Bidders,
 if submitted in the form of a check, within ten (10) Days of the Contract Award. The
 Department will return the retained Bid Guaranty of the successful Bidder, if in the form of a
 check, after the successful Bidder has furnished satisfactory Contract bonds and the Contract
 has been executed. The Department will return Bid Guaranties in the form of Bid bonds only
 upon the request of an unsuccessful Bidder.
 103.6
 
 REQUIREMENT OF CONTRACT BONDS
 
 Return the signed Contract with Contract Bonds. The value of each bond shall equal the
 Total Original Contract Amount. The Department must approve the Surety and the form of the
 Contract Bonds.
 All bonds shall be procured from Sureties with an A.M. Best Company financial strength
 rating level of A- or better, Class VII or better, unless otherwise approved in writing by the
 Department. In no event shall the Department approve the use of a Surety with an A.M. Best
 Company financial strength rating level of B or worse.
 103.7
 
 EXECUTION AND APPROVAL OF CONTRACT
 
 The successful Bidder shall sign and return the Contract and provide Contract Bonds and
 lists of all Subcontractors and Suppliers within 15 Days of receiving the Contract. If the
 Department fails to execute the Contract within 30 Days of receiving the signed Contract and
 Contract Bonds from the successful Bidder, the Bidder may withdraw the Bid without penalty.
 No Contract shall be effective until it has been fully executed by the Department and the
 Contractor.
 103.8
 
 FAILURE TO EXECUTE CONTRACT
 
 Failure by the successful Bidder to return the signed Contract and Contract Bonds within
 15 Days of receiving the Contract shall constitute just cause for cancellation of the Award and
 the forfeiture of the Bid Guaranty which shall become the property of the Department, not as a
 penalty but as liquidation of reasonable damages sustained. The Department may then
 Award the Contract to the Bidder with the next lowest Responsive Bid, reject all bids, reject all
 bids and issue a new Invitation for Bids or take other actions as the Department may decide.

 SCOPE OF WORK
 
 104.1 INTENT OF THE CONTRACT
 The intent of the Contract is to provide for the construction and completion in every
 manner and detail of the Work described in accordance with the Plans, Specifications, and
 Contract terms except for Materials supplied by the Department in accordance with Section
 106.8, “Department-Provided Material.”
 Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, the Contractor is vested with the discretion
 and is wholly and solely responsible for selecting and managing the means and methods for
 performing the Work including determining the suitability of Equipment, experience of labor
 and staff, construction management and scheduling, production rates, Materials, and
 compliance with all Federal, State and local laws and regulations.
 The Contract is a final, complete and exclusive statement of the written and executed
 agreement of the parties. No modifications, limitations, waivers or discharge of the Contract or
 any of its terms shall bind the Department unless made in a written Change Order signed by
 the Project Manager. A course of performance or course of dealing on this Contract or any
 other contract between the Department and a contractor shall not constitute a modification or
 waiver of the Contract and shall not give rise to any Claim including any cause of action based
 upon promissory estoppel, estoppel, waiver, or detrimental reliance.
 104.2
 
 SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE CHARACTER OF THE WORK
 
 The Department reserves the right to make, in writing, modifications in quantity and
 alterations to the Work. Such changes will not invalidate the Contract nor release the
 Contractor’s Surety, and the Contractor shall perform the Work as altered.
 If modifying the quantities or altering the Work significantly changes the character of the
 Work, the Project Manager will make an adjustment to the Contract which excludes additional
 profit. The Project Manager and the Contractor shall agree upon the adjustment prior to the
 Contractor’s performance of the Work. If an agreement is not reached, the Project Manager
 will determine a fair and equitable adjustment.
 If the modifications or alterations do not significantly change the character of the Work,
 the Department will pay for the altered Work in accordance with the Contract Bid Items.
 “Significant change” applies only to modifications or alterations that:
 1.
 
 Materially change, in kind or nature, the character of the Work including the Critical
 Path; or,
 
 2.
 
 Increase or decrease a Major Contract Item by twenty-five percent (25%). Adjusted
 compensation shall apply only to the following:
 
 3.
 
 a.
 
 For quantity in excess of one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the
 original Contract item quantity, or,
 
 b.
 
 For the case of a decrease, below seventy five percent (75%) of the original
 Contract item quantity, the adjusted compensation will apply to the total
 quantity placed.
 
 Affect Work performed under a Department-approved subcontract. The Department
 will make adjustments if, prior to the Work, the Contractor demonstrates that the
 change adversely affects the Subcontractor’s Work or payment.
 
 The Department shall not consider customary increases or decreases in quantities
 necessary to complete the Work changed by the Contractor’s schedule of operations, his or
 her planning of the Work, or unscheduled mobilizations.
 104.3
 
 DIFFERING SITE CONDITIONS
 
 Section 104:
 
 Scope of Work
 
 Page 28
 
 The Contractor and the Project Manager shall provide each other with prompt written
 notice, not to exceed two (2) Working Days, of the following conditions encountered on the
 Project during the progress of the Work:
 1.
 
 Latent physical conditions differing materially from those shown in the Contract; or,
 
 2.
 
 Unknown conditions of an unusual nature differing materially from those ordinarily
 encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the Work.
 
 The party providing notice shall do so before the conditions are disturbed or as soon
 thereafter as practicable and before the affected Work continues. Pursuant to Section 108.3.2
 “Schedule Format,” the Contractor shall provide a revised schedule to the Project Manager
 within seven (7) Days of the discovery or notice of a differing site condition; this timeframe
 may be extended in writing by the Project Manager.
 The Project Manager will decide, within a, two (2) Working Days, after written notification,
 whether the conditions materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time
 required to perform the Work. The Project Manager will notify the Contractor of this decision.
 The Project Manager will adjust the Contract for differing site conditions in accordance
 with Section 109.5, “Payment for Changes, Differing Site Conditions, and Extra Work,” and will
 include the costs of Delays but exclude anticipated profit in accordance with Section 109.11,
 “Compensation for Claims.” No Contract adjustment or additional compensation or time which
 results in a benefit to the Contractor will be allowed if a differing site condition could have been
 discovered or anticipated by the Contractor through the exercise of Pre-Bid Due Diligence.
 The Contractor is not entitled to a Claim due to a differing site condition unless the
 Contractor has provided the required written notice pursuant to Section 105.19, “Notice of
 Potential Claim.”
 If the Contractor or the Project Manager fails to provide prompt written notice which
 results in additional costs to the Department which could have been mitigated, the Department
 shall adjust the Contract accordingly.
 104.4
 
 EXTRA WORK
 
 The Contractor shall perform Extra Work at the Department’s written direction and in
 accordance with the Specifications. The Department shall pay for Extra Work in accordance
 with Section 104.2, “Significant Changes in the Character of Work” and Section 109.5,
 “Payment for Changes, Differing Site Conditions, and Extra Work.”
 104.5 MAINTENANCE OF TRAFFIC
 The Contractor shall provide, erect, and maintain barricades, warning signs, flaggers and
 pilot cars in accordance with the version of the MUTCD current at the time of letting and the
 Accepted vehicular and pedestrian traffic control plan and Division 700, “Traffic Control
 Devices.” The Contractor shall provide flaggers with proper training and Equipment in
 accordance with the MUTCD, current edition. The Contractor shall keep flagging Equipment
 clean and in good repair. The Contractor shall keep the existing Roadway open with a
 minimum of inconvenience to the traveling public or provide an approved alternate route.

 The Department is responsible for snow removal on sections of Roadway open to the
 traveling public. The Project Manager will coordinate snow removal with the Contractor and
 the maintenance patrol. The Contractor is responsible for snow removal on sections of the
 Roadway not open to the traveling public, as necessary for protection of the Work. The
 Contractor shall furnish warning devices, take protective and safety measures provided in this
 section, and complete Shoulder Work, drainage Structures, or other features of the Work. If
 the Contractor fails to do so, the Project Manager will notify the Contractor in writing of the
 deficiency and the Contractor shall take corrective action within the time frame specified by the
 Project Manager. If the Contractor does not take corrective action in this period, the Project
 Manager may make corrections or terminate the Contract in accordance with Section 108.9,
 “Default of Contract.” The Contractor shall reimburse the Department for Department incurred
 costs of such corrections plus an additional ten percent (10%) for administrative costs.
 The Contractor shall provide reasonable vehicular and pedestrian ingress and egress to
 adjoining properties during the duration of the Contract. The Contractor shall advise and
 schedule access modifications with local business owners and residences and the Project
 Manager at least 24 hours in advance.
 The Contractor shall open partially completed sections of the Roadway to traffic under
 the following conditions:
 1.
 
 At the Project Manager’s direction;
 
 2.
 
 As shown on the Plans; or,
 
 3.
 
 If requested by the Contractor and approved by the Project Manager.
 
 Such an opening shall not constitute a full or partial Acceptance of the Work or a waiver
 of any Contract provisions. The Project Manager will provide written instructions stating any
 sections not shown on the Plans which are to be opened.
 If the Project Manager directs the opening of a Roadway section because of an
 unforeseen need that is not the fault of the Contractor, the Department will negotiate a Change
 Order for additional compensation or additional time, if any, qualifying under Section 104.2,
 “Significant Changes in the Character of the Work.”
 If a Roadway section is opened at the request of the Contractor, the Contractor shall
 remain liable for the section until final Acceptance of the Project and must repair, at its own
 expense, any resultant damage to the section except differing site conditions which shall be
 paid as Extra Work under Section 104.2, “Significant Changes in the Character of the Work,”
 and Section 109.5, “Payment For Changes, Differing Site Conditions, and Extra Work.”
 104.6
 
 RIGHTS IN AND USE OF MATERIALS FOUND ON THE WORK
 
 The Contractor may use stone, gravel, sand or other Material meeting Contract
 requirements and found in an excavation required by the Contract. The Department will pay
 for the excavation at the Bid Item Unit Price for Excavation and will pay for the pay item for
 which the Contractor uses the Material.
 If the excavated Material would have been used to construct Embankments or Bridge
 approaches or for other purposes, any of which would have been required to complete the
 Contract, the Contractor shall replace the excavated Material with Acceptable Material at no
 additional cost to the Department. The Department will not charge the Contractor for the use
 of the excavated Material. The Contractor shall obtain written authorization from the Project
 Manager before excavating Material that is within the Right of Way but outside the grading
 limits, as shown by the slope and grade lines. Prior to granting approval, the Project Manager
 will verify that the requirements of Section 107, “Legal Relations, Environmental
 Requirements, and Responsibility to the Public” have been met. If not previously cleared
 environmentally, meeting these requirements will be the responsibility of the Contractor.
 
 Section 104:
 
 Scope of Work
 
 Page 30
 
 Unless otherwise provided, the Contractor may temporarily use the Material from existing
 Structures in the erection of a new Structure but shall not, without the approval of the Project
 Manager, cut or otherwise damage such Materials.
 104.7 FINAL CLEANUP
 Before final Acceptance, the Contractor shall clean waste (including concrete and asphalt
 chunks, loose rock, excess Materials, and temporary Structures) from the Roadway and pit
 sites and ground used in connection with the Work. Leave all parts of the Work in an
 Acceptable condition. To avoid the requirement of removal of Equipment from private property
 before final Acceptance, make appropriate arrangements with private property owners.
 The Contractor shall re-vegetate Borrow Pits, haul Roads, and all occupied ground in
 accordance with Section 632, “Revegetation” and the Contract. Acceptance by the Project
 Manager of a letter of intent from the landowner for future use may exempt haul Roads or
 other areas from this requirement.
 The Contractor shall strip Borrow Pits and Surfacing Pits when indicated on the Plans
 and stockpile topsoil. After construction operations are complete, place stockpiled Materials
 uniformly over the stripped area to form a seedbed for planting. The Contractor shall spread
 stockpiled waste that is not covered by a land owner agreement over the stripped area prior to
 placing the topsoil. Stripping, stockpiling, and replacement of topsoil and spreading of
 stockpiled waste shall be Incidental to completion of the Work unless a Bid Item for them
 exists in the Bid.
 The Contractor shall not allow Borrow Pits and Surfacing Pits to change the general
 pattern of existing drainage. Unless Borrow Pits or Surfacing Pits are suitable to develop as
 ponds or lakes and the property owner has notified the Department in writing that such
 development is planned, the Contractor shall where practicable leave all pits well drained.
 The Contractor shall, when excavation is complete, contour grade pits, except quarry
 pits, to blend with the natural topography of the surrounding area or in accordance with the
 Contract or agreements with the property owners.
 Pits located on state or federal land are governed by the appropriate requirements of
 their agency. The above requirements do not apply to a commercial source.
 104.8 VALUE ENGINEERING COST PROPOSAL (VECP)
 When the Total Original Contract Amount exceeds $100,000, the Contractor may submit
 a VECP which does not impair or degrade any of the following:
 1.
 
 Service life;
 
 2.
 
 Economy of operation;
 
 3.
 
 Ease of maintenance;
 
 4.
 
 Desired appearance;
 
 5.
 
 Safety;
 
 6.
 
 Environmental requirements; or,
 
 7.
 
 Any other essential functions and characteristics of the Project.
 
 The Contractor shall provide sufficient information, in writing, for a VECP to stand on its
 own merit and require minimal verification as determined by the Department.
 104.8.1
 
 Content Requirements
 
 The Contractor shall provide, at a minimum, the following information, in writing, in a
 VECP:
 1.
 Section 104:
 
 A statement identifying the submittal as a VECP;
 Scope of Work
 
 Page 31
 
 2.
 
 A description of the Work to be performed under the Contract and under the VECP;
 
 3.
 
 An engineering analysis including drawings, computations, and other documents
 necessary for an evaluation by the Department;
 
 4.
 
 A list of the Contract requirements that must be changed if the Department adopts
 the proposal and a recommended way to make these changes;
 
 5.
 
 A detailed estimate of the Contractor’s cost to perform the Work under the existing
 Contract and under the proposal, including the cost of developing and implementing
 the change;

 104.8.2
 
 Procedural Requirements
 
 The following requirements and procedures apply to VECP:
 1.
 
 In order to expedite the processing of a VECP and to minimize costly studies by the
 Contractor and Department, the Contractor may submit to the Department, on a
 Department form, a summary of the VECP. The Department will evaluate the
 summary for merit and submit a recommendation to the Contractor. A favorable
 recommendation to the Contractor shall not be construed as acceptance of all or
 any part of the submittal;
 
 2.
 
 The Department will not accept a VECP if it is similar to a change in the Plans or
 Specifications the Department is considering for the Project at the time the proposal
 is submitted or if the proposal is based upon or similar to the Standard
 Specifications, Special Provisions, standard drawing serials, or procedures the
 Department adopted after the Advertisement for the Contract;
 
 3.
 
 The Department will execute a Change Order with the necessary Contract
 modifications if it accepts a VECP;
 
 4.
 
 If the Department approves a VECP, only the Contractor who initially submitted the
 proposal will be eligible for payment in accordance with Section 104.8, “Value
 Engineering Cost Proposals (VECP).” In this case, the approved VECP will apply
 only to those Contracts which were awarded to the Contractor before submission of
 the VECP and for which the proposal was submitted;
 
 5.
 
 The Department will deduct from the net savings the costs it incurs implementing
 the accepted VECP and the changes;
 
 6.
 
 The Department will be the sole judge of the estimated net savings resulting from an
 approved VECP. In determining the estimated net savings, the Department may
 disregard the Bid Item Unit Price if, in the Department’s judgment, the prices are not
 a fair measurement of the Work performed or deleted. The Department will also
 determine the net savings by considering actual JMFs, shrink and swell factors and
 other actual design criteria used;
 
 7.
 
 The Contractor’s share of an approved VECP is 50% of the net savings;
 
 8.
 
 The Contractor’s share of 50% of the net savings shall be full compensation for
 effecting all changes pursuant to the Change Order resulting from an approved
 VECP;
 
 9.
 
 The Department will not pay for the actual costs of implementing an approved VECP
 if these costs exceed the Contract amount originally committed;
 
 10. When the District Engineer determines the actual net savings, the Department will
 execute a Change Order for a Lump sum of the Contractor’s share. The Project
 Manager may approve a schedule for Progress Payments of the Lump sum; and,
 Section 104:
 
 Scope of Work
 
 Page 32
 
 11. In preparing a VECP, the Contractor shall perform an independent examination of
 the affected Work site. The Department will rely exclusively upon the accuracy of
 the engineering data upon which the VECP is based and will not be required to
 perform additional investigations, crosschecks, or site examinations.
 The
 Department’s acceptance or adoption of a VECP shall not be construed to alleviate
 or reduce the Contractor’s full and absolute liability if the implementation of the
 proposal fails to satisfactorily perform. Except as set forth in Section 109.10,
 “Project Closure,” the Contractor’s liability will not extend beyond the Department’s
 final written acceptance.

 SECTION 105:
 105.1
 105.1.1
 
 CONTROL OF WORK
 
 RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTHORITY OF THE DEPARTMENT
 The Department has the authority to:
 
 1.
 
 Manage the Contract;
 
 2.
 
 Alter the Plans;
 
 3.
 
 Modify the Contract by Change Order;
 
 4.
 
 Supervise and terminate the Contract as expressly provided in other sections of the
 Standard Specifications; and,
 
 5.
 
 Wholly or Partially Suspend the Work for cause, e.g., weather conditions, discovery
 of Cultural Resource, and utility conflicts.
 
 The Project Manager may also wholly or Partially Suspend the Work for reasons beyond
 the control of the Contractor or not connected to the construction of the Project when the
 Project Manager deems such a suspension to be in the best interests of the public and the
 Department. Failure by the Contractor to suspend Work immediately may result in the
 Contractor being in default of Contract pursuant to Section 108.9, “Default of Contract.” The
 Department will pay for Work caused by such a suspension pursuant to Section 104.2,
 “Significant Changes in the Character of Work,” and will adjust any Contract Time for such a
 suspension pursuant to Section 108.6, “Determination and Extension of Contract Time.”
 105.1.2
 
 Department Authority to Suspend Work
 
 The Department has the authority to wholly or Partially Suspend the Work and to prepare
 and post a zero dollar ($0.00) Progress Payment if the Contractor:
 1.
 
 Fails to correct unsafe conditions;
 
 2.
 
 Fails to comply with any term or condition of the Contract;
 
 3.
 
 Fails to observe and comply with any Federal or State law or regulation;
 
 4.
 
 Fails to carry out directions of the Project Manager; or,
 
 5.
 
 Fails to perform satisfactory Work.
 
 Failure by the Contractor to suspend Work immediately may result in the Contractor
 being in default of Contract pursuant to Section 108.9 “Default of Contract.” The Contractor
 shall not receive additional compensation or time for these failures.
 If, during the course of the Project the Contractor's personnel are not performing
 satisfactory Work, the Project Manager may order the Contractor to suspend operations until
 the Contractor corrects the problem, at no cost to the Department.
 The Department’s ability to withhold Progress Payments in part or in their entirety as part
 of a suspension as authorized by this Section, supplements the Department’s ability, pursuant
 to Section 109.8, “Progress Payments,” until the Contractor complies with the Contract.
 105.1.3
 
 Contractor Request for Suspension
 
 The Contractor may request a suspension of the Work wholly or partially, but the
 Contractor shall not suspend the Work without written approval from the Project Manager.
 105.2
 
 PLANS AND WORKING DRAWINGS
 
 The Contractor shall perform the Work in accordance with the details shown on the Plans
 prepared by the Department and the approved Working Drawings prepared and submitted by
 the Contractor. The Contractor shall have the sole responsibility for verifying pertinent
 dimensions in the field before submitting such Working Drawings to the Department.
 
 Section 105:
 
 Control of Work
 
 Page 34
 
 The Project Manager will review the Working Drawings although the Project Manager’s
 review does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for the satisfactory completion of
 the Work. The Contractor shall obtain written approval of the Working Drawings from the
 Project Manager before beginning Work covered by the drawings and shall not alter or amend
 such drawings without the prior written approval of the Project Manager. The furnishing of all
 Working Drawings is Incidental.
 105.3
 
 COMPLIANCE WITH PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS
 
 The Contractor shall perform the Work and provide Materials in substantial compliance
 with the lines, grades, cross sections, dimensions, and material requirements as specified by
 the Contract. If Work does not comply with the Contract, the Project Manager may determine
 if the nonconforming Work is nonetheless Acceptable. If Accepted, the Project Manager will
 document the basis of Acceptance by Change Order, and provide an adjustment in the
 Contract price for Work or Materials, as necessary. If the Work or Materials do not comply
 with the Contract and the Project Manager determines they are unacceptable, the Contractor
 shall remove, replace, and correct the Work or Materials at no additional cost to the
 Department.
 The Contractor has an affirmative duty to perform all Work and provide Materials in
 compliance with the Contract. The Department's failure to discover or reject Materials or Work
 not in accordance with the Contract during the progress of Work shall not be considered an
 Acceptance of the Work or Materials, or a waiver of defects. The failure to properly perform
 inspections, tests or approvals by the Department shall not relieve the Contractor from its
 obligation to perform the Work and provide Materials in strict conformance with the Contract.
 105.4 COORDINATION OF CONTRACT DOCUMENTS
 The following documents are essential parts of the Contract, and in their totality constitute
 the Contract, and are intended to be complementary. In case of a discrepancy, the
 documents will govern in the following order of importance:
 1.
 
 Addenda;
 
 2.
 
 Required Documents for Bid Submittal;
 
 3.
 
 Notice to Contractors;
 
 4.

 Special Provisions;
 
 6.
 
 Plans other than Standard Drawings;
 
 7.
 
 Supplemental Specifications;
 
 8.
 
 Standard Specifications; and,
 
 9.
 
 Standard Drawings.
 
 Dimensions given on the Plans or that can be calculated govern over scaled dimensions.
 If a Contract or plan discrepancy is discovered after the Award of the Project, the
 Contractor shall, upon discovery, promptly notify in writing the Project Manager of errors or
 omissions in the Plans, contradictions within these documents or contradictions between the
 Contract documents and the worksite. Unless otherwise directed by the Project Manager, the
 Project Manager will resolve the discrepancy in writing before the Contractor proceeds further
 with performance of the affected Work.
 The Project Manager and the Contractor may agree that the Contractor shall obtain
 drawings, modifications, or other documents necessary to correct the error or omission. The
 Department will pay for this Work pursuant to Section 104.2, “Significant Changes in the
 Character of the Work.”

 been damaged or dislocated during the excavation work.
 Upon request, the Department will make available to the Contractor all information
 received from utility companies, pipeline owners and other parties that the Department has
 notified concerning the proposed construction. This Department-furnished information does
 not abrogate the Contractor’s responsibility for any further verifications and utility inquiries
 necessary to properly address permanent and temporary utility appurtenances in the
 performance of the Work.
 The following items which are to be relocated or adjusted will be moved by others at no
 expense to the Contractor unless otherwise provided for in the Special Provisions or in the

 Work performed without authority.
 
 The Department may order the Contractor to remove or replace such Work, at no
 additional cost to the Department.
 Upon failure of the Contractor to comply with the removal and replacement of
 unacceptable or unauthorized Work within the time specified by the Project Manager, the
 Project Manager shall have authority to cause unacceptable Work to be remedied or removed
 Section 105:
 
 Control of Work

 and replaced and unauthorized Work to be removed by others with the costs to be deducted
 from monies due or to become due to the Contractor.
 105.12
 
 LOAD RESTRICTIONS
 
 The Contractor shall observe legal load restrictions when hauling Equipment or Material
 on public Roads outside of the Project or on Roadways within the Project. The Project
 Manager may approve exceptions, in writing, provided the Contractor has obtained the proper
 oversize and overweight permits. The Contractor is liable for damage that may result from
 moving Equipment, even with the issuance of a special permit.
 The Contractor shall not use Equipment or haul loads that will cause damage to
 Structures, Roadway, or any other construction, regardless of legal load allowances.
 The Contractor may exceed legal loads on treated base under construction with approval
 from the Project Manager. The Department will not allow loads over PCC construction before
 the minimum curing period has expired or specified strength is obtained.
 If the Project Manager determines that hauling operations are causing undue damage to
 existing Roadways or Structures, the Project Manager will issue a written order to the
 Contractor to stop operations causing the damage in accordance with Section 105.17,
 “Contract Adustments for Suspention of Work.” Within seventy two (72) hours of the notice,
 the Project Manager will decide on one (1) or more of the following solutions:
 1.
 
 Change the haul route;
 
 2.
 
 Reduce the allowable load limit; and,
 
 3.
 
 Allow the operations to continue with the requirement that the Contractor repair all
 damaged areas at ½ Unit Bid prices.
 
 105.13
 
 HAUL ROADS
 
 If the Contract establishes Material sources and haul Roads and the Contractor elects to
 use others, the Department will not pay the Contractor for corrective actions required to repair
 damage to existing Roadway and Structures resulting from the Contractor’s sources and
 hauling operations.
 If the Contract specifies that the Contractor use established Material sources and haul
 Roads the Department will determine what preservation or restoration of the existing Roadway
 or Structures is necessary, payment shall be made pursuant to Section 105.13.1, “Corrective
 Actions and Methods of Payment.”
 If the Contractor’s own Material sources are used but transported on some Contractspecified haul Roads, and the Department determines that preservation or restoration of the
 existing Roadway or Structures is necessary, the corrective action and method of payment will
 be as follows:
 1.
 
 The Contractor shall repair haul Roads not established by the Contract at no
 additional cost to the Department; and,
 
 2.
 
 The Department will pay for repairs to Contract-established haul Roads in
 accordance with Section 105.13.1, “Corrective Actions and Methods of Payment.”
 
 The Project Manager will determine the extent of the corrective action.
 105.13.1
 105.13.1.1
 
 Corrective Actions and Methods of Payment
 Change in Haul Route
 
 If the Project Manager changes the haul route, the Department will modify the
 Contractor’s payment per the following equation:
 
 P  R  t  (d1  d 0 )
 Section 105:
 
 Control of Work
 
 (1)
 Page 40
 
 Where,
 
 P
 
 is the payment modification (in dollars)
 
 R
 
 is the rate (in dollars per ton mile determined in accordance with Section
 109, “Measurement and Payment.”)
 
 t
 
 is the weight of Material hauled from the new stockpile area (in tons)
 
 d0
 
 is the original haul distance measured from the Roadway access point to the
 original stockpile area
 
 d1
 
 is the new haul distance measured from the Roadway access point to the
 new stockpile area
 
 105.13.1.2
 
 Change in Allowable Load Limit
 
 If the Project Manager reduces the allowable load limit, the Department will pay the
 Contractor in accordance with the following equation:
 
 P
 
 QF  R  d  ( LA  LR )
 LA
 
 (2)
 
 Where,
 
 P
 
 is the additional payment (in dollars)
 
 R

 109, “Measurement and Payment.”)
 
 QF
 
 is the total quantity of Material hauled at the reduced load limit (in tons)
 
 LA
 
 is the allowable load limit (in tons)
 
 LR
 
 is the reduced load limit (in tons)
 
 d
 
 is the haul distance (in miles)
 
 If the Project Manager allows operations to continue, the Department will pay the
 Contractor for the Material used to make the repairs at the Bid Item Unit Price, or in
 accordance with Section 109, “Measurement and Payment.” If an item is not part of the
 Contract, the Department will negotiate a new unit price. If a Structure or existing Roadway
 must be repaired, the Department may pay the Contractor for hauling repair Materials using a
 rate requested and justified by the Contractor and approved by the Project Manager.

 MAINTENANCE DURING CONSTRUCTION
 
 The Contractor shall maintain the Work during construction and until the Department
 Accepts the Work, except as otherwise provided in Section 104.5, “Maintenance of Traffic,”
 and Section 105.18, “Acceptance.” This maintenance shall consist of continuous, daily Work
 with adequate Equipment and forces so that the Roadway and Structures are kept in
 satisfactory condition. The Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining the Project free and
 clear of Deleterious Materials including debris, weather related remnants, snow, loose
 Materials and trash. The Department shall be responsible for snow removal operations on
 travel lanes open and utilized by the public.
 In the case of a Contract for placing a course on a previously constructed course or
 Subgrade, the Contractor shall maintain the previous course or Subgrade during all
 construction operations, including when the Plan requires the Contractor to place traffic on the
 unfinished Roadway.
 All maintenance Work during construction and before the Project is Accepted shall be
 Incidental. The Department shall not pay the Contractor an additional amount for this Work
 Section 105:
 
 Control of Work

 except in accordance with Section 104.5, “Maintenance of Traffic,” and Section 105.18,
 “Acceptance.”
 105.16
 
 FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ROADWAY OR STRUCTURE
 
 If the Contractor fails to maintain the Project in accordance with Section 105.15,
 “Maintenance During Construction,” the Project Manager shall notify the Contractor in writing
 of the failure. If the Contractor does not begin maintenance after such notice, the Project
 Manager may begin maintenance of the Project. If the Contractor does not take corrective
 action in this period, the Project Manager may make corrections or terminate the Contract in
 accordance with Section 108.9, “Default of Contract.” For corrective actions implemented by
 the Project Manger the Contractor shall reimburse the Department for Department incurred
 costs of such maintenance plus an additional ten percent (10%) for administrative costs.
 105.17
 
 CONTRACT ADJUSTMENT FOR SUSPENSION OF WORK
 
 If the Work is suspended by the Project Manager in writing pursuant to Section 105.1.2,
 “Department Authority to Suspend Work” for an unreasonable time (not originally anticipated,
 customary, or inherent to the construction industry), the Contractor may submit to the Project
 Manager a Notice of Intent to Claim in accordance with Section 105.19, “Notice of Potential
 Claim” which must be accompanied by a proposed revised schedule pursuant to Section
 108.3.2 “Schedule Format.”
 Upon receipt, the Project Manager will evaluate the Contractor’s request. If the Project
 Manager agrees that the cost and time required for the performance of the Contract has
 increased as a result of such suspension and the suspension was caused by conditions
 beyond the control of and not the fault of the Contractor, its Suppliers, or Subcontractors at
 any approved tier, and not caused by weather conditions, the Project Manager will make an
 adjustment in accordance with Section 109.11 “Compensation for Claims” and modify the
 Contract in writing accordingly. The Project Manager will notify the Contractor of the decision.
 The Department will not make a Contract adjustment under this clause if the Contract
 performance would have been suspended or delayed by any other cause. The Department
 will not make a Contract adjustment under this clause if a Contract adjustment is provided or
 excluded under any other term or condition of this Contract.
 105.18
 
 ACCEPTANCE
 
 105.18.1
 
 Partial Acceptance
 
 The Contractor may request that the Project Manager inspect a portion of the Project
 (e.g., a Structure, a section of Road, etc.) at any time during the Work. If the Project Manager
 finds that portion to be in accordance with the Contract, the Project Manager may Accept that
 portion as complete, and, without waiving the provisions in Section 105.3, “Compliance with
 Plans and Specifications,” and Section 109.10, “Project Closure” the Contractor may be
 relieved of further responsibility for that portion unless the Department discovers latent defects
 before final Acceptance of the Work. Such partial Acceptance does not void or alter the
 Contract.
 The Department will Accept permanent traffic safety and control devices installed in
 accordance with the Contract (with all ancillary components) and being used by the public
 upon installation but before Completion of the remaining Work.
 Permanently installed items Accepted on this basis are limited to the following:
 1.
 
 Guardrail;
 
 2.
 
 Impact attenuators;
 
 3.
 
 Traffic Signals;
 
 4.
 
 Signs;
 
 5.

 All required performance tests and guarantees shall remain applicable.
 The Department or the Contractor will repair or replace any damage, theft, or vandalism
 to these items after Acceptance in accordance with Section 104.4, “Extra Work.” If the
 damage to an item requires only partial repair or replacement and the Contractor performs the
 Work, the Department will pay the Contractor in accordance with Section 109.4,
 “Compensation for Overrun / Underrun Quantities.” The Contractor shall repair or replace
 items damaged due to the Contractor’s negligence, at no additional cost to the Department.
 The Contractor shall erect these items in a logical construction sequence. The
 Department shall not Accept prematurely constructed items until they may be used for their
 intended purposes.
 105.19
 
 NOTICE OF POTENTIAL CLAIM
 
 1.
 
 The Contractor shall only make Claims in accordance with the Contract pursuant to
 the exclusive administrative remedy and procedures set forth in this Section and
 Section 105.20, “Administrative Remedy.”
 
 2.
 
 The Contractor shall not be entitled to pursue a Claim if the Project Manager
 determines the Work ordered is Extra Work in which case payment shall be made in
 accordance with Section 109.5, “Payment For Changes, Differing Site Conditions,
 and Extra Work.”
 
 3.
 
 The Contractor shall promptly notify the Project Manager in writing of the intent to
 make a Claim and shall provide a contemporaneous statement of estimated
 damages or delay before beginning the Work on which the Claim is based, but, in
 no event shall notice be given later than seven (7) Days of the Contractor
 discovering the condition or issue giving rise to the Claim, or within seven (7) Days
 of receipt of a notice of a differing site condition from the Project Manager, or in the
 case of termination of Contract under Section 108.10, “Termination of Contract; No
 Fault of Contractor” within 30 Days of the effective termination date. A notice of
 intent to Claim shall include, when relevant to the intended Claim (e.g., when the
 Contractor intends to seek a Contract adjustment for time, Delay damages, or
 reduction in Liquidated Damages, etc.), a revised schedule pursuant to Section
 108.3.2, “Schedule Format”; failure to include a revised schedule shall render the
 notice of intent to Claim incomplete.
 
 4.
 
 Such notice of intent to Claim shall be given in order that the Department can
 assess the situation, make an initial determination as to the causes of the potential
 Claim, institute appropriate changes or procedures to resolve the matter, to
 document issues related to the potential Claim, to track costs and possible Delay,
 and facilitate resolution of the potential Claim. The failure of the Contractor to
 provide timely written notice of intent to make a Claim and a contemporaneous
 statement of estimated damages or Delay shall constitute a waiver or abandonment
 of the Claim. The Contractor waives the right to assert a Claim if the Contractor fails
 to provide proper and complete notice of intent to Claim.
 
 5.
 
 The Contractor shall provide the Project Manager proper facilities to keep account of
 the actual cost of a Claim; the Contractor waives the right to assert a Claim if the
 Project Manager is not afforded proper facilities to keep account of actual cost. The
 Project Manager may, in the Project Manager’s discretion, in writing, waive the
 
 Section 105:
 
 Control of Work
 
 Page 43
 
 requirement regarding the furnishing of proper facilities to keep account of actual
 cost upon a showing of adequate justification by the Contractor.
 6.
 
 This Section and the deadlines stated herein do not modify any of the deadlines for
 submitting revised schedules as provided in Section 108.3, “Schedule.”
 
 7.
 
 Neither proper Notice by the Contractor nor the Project Manager’s accounts of the
 cost shall be construed to prove or validate the Claim or be construed as an
 admission of liability.
 
 105.20
 
 ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY
 
 Once the Contractor has provided timely and proper notice of intent to make a Claim
 pursuant to Section 105.19, “Notice of Potential Claim” the entire and complete administrative
 remedy and procedure to resolve all contractual disputes is provided by this Section.
 The complete administrative remedy is sequential in nature, exclusive, and consists of
 the following steps:
 Step I.
 
 Notice of Intent to Claim;
 
 Step II.
 
 Submittal of the Claim to the Project Manager;
 
 Step III.
 
 District Level review and decision;
 
 Step IV.
 
 Service of Request for Reconsideration of Claim to Secretary;
 
 Step V.
 
 Secretary’s review, which may include referral to Claims Board for an
 informal hearing, and Secretary’s decision;
 
 Step VI.
 
 Service of Request for Arbitration or Service of Summons and Complaint
 in State District Court.
 
 No contractual dispute or Claim shall be accorded any level of review unless the dispute
 has been properly submitted, reviewed and decided at the preceding level and the Contractor
 rejects the decision by providing the requisite notices and submittals in writing to the proper
 Department officials or employees within the time periods proscribed in this Section and
 Section 105.19, “Notice of Potential Claim.”
 The complete terms of a resolved Claim, regardless of the level of the administrative
 remedy, shall be documented and memorialized via a Change Order executed by the
 Contractor and the Department. The executed Change Order shall represent a final
 agreement to the total amount and time due for any and all Work and items pertaining to the
 Work associated with the Change Order. Unless otherwise provided, in writing, in the
 executed Change Order, the executed Change Order shall operate as an accord and
 satisfaction of the Claim and shall operate as a bar to any further Claim by the Contractor.
 The Department shall dismiss a Contractor’s Claim for failure to comply with the time
 limitations, requirements and procedures set forth in this Section and Section 105.19, “Notice
 of Potential Claim.”
 Each party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees, costs, and expert fees.
 105.20.1
 
 District Level
 
 The Contractor shall submit the Claim in writing to the Project Manager and include
 justification for the Claim and the total amount requested within 30 Days of the date that the
 Work associated with the Claim has been completed but, in no event later than within 30 Days
 of receipt of the Departments proposed final payment statement (estimate) pursuant Section
 109.10 “Project Closure”. The Contractor may submit a Claim only once. Once a Claim is
 submitted to the Project Manager, nothing in this section shall be construed as permitting the
 Contractor to revive, modify, supplement, enlarge, or amend the Claim other than providing
 additional documents and information in support of the Claim. The Contractor shall be
 prohibited from amending either the bases of entitlement or the amount of any compensation
 or time stated for any and all issues claimed in the Contractor’s written Claim submitted
 hereunder, and all further proceedings shall be limited solely to the bases of entitlement and
 Section 105:
 
 Control of Work
 
 Page 44
 
 the amount of any compensation or time stated for any and all issues claimed in the
 Contractor’s written Claim submitted hereunder. This shall not, however, preclude a
 Contractor from withdrawing or reducing any of the bases of entitlement and the amount of
 any compensation or time stated for any and all issues claimed in the Contractor’s written
 Claim submitted hereunder at any time.
 1.
 
 Section 105:
 
 The Contractor has the burden of fully justifying and documenting the Claim and
 shall provide to the Project Manager the following supporting documentation and
 information in support of the Claim:
 a.
 
 Description of the issue upon which the Claim is based;
 
 b.
 
 Location where the issue arose;
 
 c.
 
 Time and date the issue was identified and the dates impacted;
 
 d.
 
 Clear explanation of why the issue requires additional compensation or time or
 a change to the Contract, including references to the relevant portions of the
 Contract;
 
 e.
 
 Copies of all written communications including correspondence and emails
 related to the issue;
 
 f.
 
 A detailed compilation of the amount of additional compensation sought and a
 breakdown of the amount sought as follows: documented additional job site
 labor expenses; documented additional cost of Materials and supplies; a list of
 additional Equipment costs claimed, including each piece of Equipment and the
 Blue Book rental rate claimed for each; any other additional direct costs or
 damages and the documents in support thereof; any additional indirect costs or
 damages and all documentation in support thereof;
 
 g.
 
 Where a Claim seeks additional time, time and compensation for Delay,
 adjustment of Contract Time, or the reduction or elimination of liquidated
 damages, previously submitted Baseline Schedule and revised schedules that
 comply with the requirements of Section 108.3, “Schedule”;
 
 h.
 
 Invoices identifying the labor, Materials, and Equipment used or proposed to be
 used;
 
 i.
 
 Financial Statements. If the amount claimed by the Contractor exceeds
 $100,000.00, or if requested by the Project Manager, job cost reports and
 financial statements for the time periods relevant to the Contract and the
 performance of the Work. The Contractor shall make the Contractor’s
 documents available for inspection by the Project Manager at the Contractor’s
 project office. The Project Manager may waive this requirement;
 
 j.
 
 Bid Documents. If the amount claimed by the Contractor exceeds $100,000.00,
 or if requested by the Project Manager, the Contractor shall make the
 Contractor’s documents available for inspection by the Project Manager at the
 Contractor’s project office, information and calculations used to prepare and
 determine its bid for the Contract prior to submission of the Bid. The required
 bid preparation documents, as maintained by the Contractor, to be produced
 shall include: clear itemization of the costs for each pay item broken down into
 components sufficient to allow a detailed cost estimate; the costs allocated to
 each component broken down into the Contractor's usual estimate categories
 such as direct labor, Equipment, Materials, and Subcontractor cost; indirect
 costs, including the indirect cost allocations made to each bid item; quantity
 takeoffs; the construction and progress schedule and any conceptual
 schedules upon which the Bid was based; rates of production and progress;
 marked up plans, sheets and Working Drawings ; calculations, copies and
 quotes from Subcontractors and Suppliers; memoranda, narratives, and all
 other information used by the Contractor to arrive at all of the prices contained
 in the Bid. The Project Manager may waive this requirement;
 
 k.
 
 Total amount of Claim in terms of time and compensation; and,
 
 l.
 
 The failure of the Contractor to provide the Project Manager all required
 supporting documentation and information shall constitute a waiver or
 abandonment of the Claim and a failure to exhaust its administrative remedy.
 Control of Work
 
 Page 45
 
 The Project Manager retains the right to request additional information and
 documents from the Contractor to support the Claim. The Contractor shall
 provide such additional information and documents.
 2.
 
 Subcontractor Claims shall not be considered, except when timely submitted and
 certified by the Contractor as the Contractor’s Claim.
 
 3.
 
 The District Engineer or designee has 30 Days from the date the Claim is received
 by the Project Manager, or additional time if agreed upon by both parties in writing,
 to review and render a decision. If the District Engineer or designee does not make
 a written decision within the 30 Days, or the agreed upon time, the Claim is deemed
 denied by the District Engineer. The parties may engage in informal mediation to
 resolve the Claim at the District level prior to the expiration of the time in which the
 District Engineer or its designee may render a decision.
 
 105.20.2
 
 Secretary Level
 
 Within ten (10) Days of the District Engineer’s or designee’s denial of its Claim or a
 written notice that the attempted mediation of its Claim was unsuccessful, the Contractor may
 serve a written request upon the Cabinet Secretary to reconsider the Claim. Service shall not
 be considered effective unless the request includes all supporting documentation provided at
 the District Level and, when applicable, a copy of the District Engineer’s written denial of the
 Claim. The Cabinet Secretary will provide a written decision on the request or will refer the
 Claim to the Department’s Claims Board within 21 Days of service of the request for
 reconsideration; this deadline may be extended in writing by the Cabinet Secretary. Failure to
 timely serve a written request to reconsider the Claim constitutes acceptance of the District
 Engineer’s decision and a waiver and relinquishment of the Claim. If the Contractor does not
 timely serve a written request to reconsider the Claim, the Department may, within 30 Days of
 the District Engineer’s decision, execute a unilateral Change Order implementing the District
 Engineer’s decision.
 1.
 
 Service of Process at the Secretary Level. Service of all notices and required
 documentation and information at the Secretary Level shall be made upon the
 Cabinet Secretary with a copy contemporaneously transmitted to both the District
 Engineer and the Department’s Office of General Counsel.
 Service upon the
 Cabinet Secretary shall be made during the Department’s regular Business Hours
 by delivery in person, or by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested,
 or by delivery by a nationally recognized overnight or same-day courier service that
 obtains receipts. The copy contemporaneously transmitted to the Office of General
 Counsel may be served by the means for serving the Cabinet Secretary or, with
 prior written agreement of the Office of General Counsel, by facsimile copy or by
 email transmission. Service of notice or documents made after the Department’s
 regular Business Hours shall not be effective until the next business Day. Service
 upon the District Engineer may be made by the means for serving the Cabinet
 Secretary or by facsimile copy or by email transmission and need not include the
 documentation previously submitted at the District level.
 
 2.
 
 Certification of Claim. The written request to reconsider the Claim shall include a
 notarized statement from an authorized representative or agent of the Contractor
 certifying: “under penalty of perjury, I have actual knowledge of the truth and
 accuracy of the Claim and the supporting information and records; the Claim and
 submittals are true and correct; the Claim made for Work on this Contract is true and
 is made in good faith to the best of my personal knowledge; and, the Claim and the
 remedies sought are supported by the terms of the Contract.” Where a Claim is a
 Subcontractor pass-through Claim, the certification shall further include: “the
 Contractor certifies that the Claim being passed through to the Department is
 passed through in good faith, has been independently verified by the Contractor,
 and is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.”
 
 3.
 
 Claims Board. If the Claim is referred to a Claims Board, an informal dispute
 resolution board, by the Cabinet Secretary, the Secretary shall appoint three (3)
 independent panelists with relevant experience in highway and transportation
 design, construction management, engineering, surveying, construction contract
 
 Section 105:
 
 Control of Work
 
 Page 46
 
 administration, construction oversight work, or law. The Claims Board shall not
 include any current employees of the Department or the Contractor. The Claims
 Board shall apply the Contract to the Claim and shall conduct an informal hearing in
 order to facilitate the expeditious and informal resolution of the Claim. Attorneys
 representing the parties are permitted to attend the informal hearing; however,
 attorneys shall not participate in the informal hearing unless the Claims Board
 specifically addresses an issue to them or unless agreed to by both parties.
 Notification shall be provided by both parties a minimum of five (5) Days prior to the
 hearing if legal representation will be attending the hearing. The Claims Board shall
 issue a final, written recommendation to the Cabinet Secretary to resolve the Claim.
 4.
 
 Secretary Decision. If the Claim is referred to the Department’s Claims Board, the
 Cabinet Secretary will provide a written decision within 21 Days of the Secretary’s
 receipt of a final, written recommendation on the Claim from the Claims Board; If the
 Cabinet Secretary does not provide a written decision within 21 Days, unless
 extended by the Secretary in writing prior to expiration of time to issue a decision,
 the Claims Board’s recommendations shall be deemed to have been adopted by the
 Cabinet Secretary and shall operate as the Secretary’s decision.
 
 5.
 
 Payment. Contractor is only entitled to payment of its Claim pursuant to the Cabinet
 Secretary’s decision if Contractor fully accepts the decision and executes an
 accompanying Change Order. If the Contractor fails to execute a Change Order
 within 21 Days of the Cabinet Secretary’s decision, the Department may process a
 unilateral Change Order implementing the Cabinet Secretary’s decision. The
 Contractor’s proceeding with litigation in State District Court or arbitration shall
 operate as a waiver by the Contractor to recover or receive payment pursuant to the
 Cabinet Secretary’s decision.
 
 6.
 
 Additional Information. The Secretary retains the right to request additional
 information from the Contractor to support the Claim including information as is
 provided by Section 105.20.1, “District Level” (i) and (j), regardless of the Project
 Manager’s previous waiver of those subsections.
 
 105.20.3
 
 Arbitration
 
 1.
 
 The Contractor and Department may agree to arbitrate the Claim instead of
 proceeding to litigation in State District Court. Arbitration may only be had at the
 mutual agreement of the Contractor and the Department. Arbitration shall be
 conducted in accordance with the New Mexico Uniform Arbitration Act (NMSA 1978,
 § 44-7A-1, et seq.) and this Section.
 
 2.
 
 The Contractor may, within ten (10) Days of the issuance of the Cabinet Secretary’s
 decision pursuant to Section 105.20.2, "Secretary Level,” serve upon the
 Department a written request that the Claim be submitted to arbitration. Service of
 the request to arbitrate the Claim by the Contractor shall be made pursuant to
 Section 105.20.2, “Secretary Level.” If either the Contractor or the Department fails
 to provide written notice agreeing to arbitrate the Claim within ten (10) Days of the
 request, the request shall be deemed denied. By the parties electing arbitration, the
 Contractor waives the right to redress through litigation filed in State District Court.
 The Contractor’s proceeding with arbitration shall operate as a waiver by the
 Contractor of recovery under any written decision issued by the Cabinet Secretary.
 Denial of a request, or failure to agree, to arbitrate a Claim by any party does not
 modify any of the deadlines contained in this Section.
 
 3.
 
 If the Contractor and Department agree to arbitrate the Claim the arbitration panel
 shall consist of three (3) members.
 
 4.
 
 Within 15 Days of the agreement to arbitrate the Claim, the Contractor shall submit
 the name of a panelist. The Contractor’s panelist shall:

 Be a professional arbitrator who is a member or diplomat of a nationally
 recognized professional arbitration organization, such as the National Academy
 of Arbitrators or the American Arbitration Association; or is a retired federal or
 New Mexico district or appellate judge; or be a former employee of FHWA;
 
 b.
 
 Not be an employee or a contractor of either the Department or the Contractor;
 and
 
 c.
 
 Agree to serve on the panel;
 
 7.
 
 If the two (2) panelists are unable to agree, a district judge from the First Judicial
 District shall choose the third panelist from a list of four (4) prospective panelists
 who meet the requirements of the preceding paragraph, two (2) each provided by
 the Department and the Contractor. Application to the court for this appointment
 shall be made by either or both parties within 15 Days of the impasse; the parties
 may agree in writing to extend this deadline.
 
 8.
 
 The panel shall hold the arbitration hearing in Santa Fe County, unless otherwise
 approved by the Department, no later than 90 Days after the panel is selected. If
 the panel fails to meet this deadline or if the parties agree to extend the deadline,
 the panel retains jurisdiction to hear and resolve the issues in dispute.
 
 9.
 
 Each party will pay the expenses and fees of its chosen panelist and attorney. Both
 parties will share equally the expenses and fees of the third panelist. If both parties
 agree, they will share court reporter costs. If not, the party requesting the
 transcription will pay the full cost.
 
 10. The proceedings and the decision of the panel will be in accordance with the New
 Mexico Uniform Arbitration Act, NMSA 1978, § 44-7A-1 et seq. The decision is final
 and binding and may be vacated, confirmed, or appealed only in accordance with
 the New Mexico Uniform Arbitration Act (NMSA 1978, § 44-7A-1 et seq.).
 105.20.4
 
 Litigation

 federal law or regulation or court order, in whole or in part, then both parties shall be relieved
 of all obligations under that provision only to the extent necessary to comply with the
 superseding law or ruling, provided however, that the remaining provisions of the Contract, or
 portions thereof, shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.
 The Contractor agrees that any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be
 resolved against the drafting party shall not be applied in the construction or interpretation of
 this Contract.
 107.31 CHOICE OF LAW

 New Mexico.
 
 Section 107:
 
 Legal Relations, Environmental Requirements, and Responsibility to the Public
 
 Page 69
 
 SECTION 108:
 
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 
 The Contractor is wholly and solely responsible and liable for the performance of all Work
 or any act by its Subcontractors, Truckers, and Suppliers on the Project.
 108.1
 
 SUBCONTRACTING
 
 Any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, or joint venture performing Work on the
 Project that is not an employee of the Contractor is a Subcontractor unless otherwise
 excepted in this Section. A Supplier or Fabricator is not a Subcontractor unless Work is being
 performed on the Project.
 The Contractor shall perform with its own organization at least 40% of the Work based on
 the Total Bid Amount. The Contractor’s organization shall include workers employed and paid
 directly and Equipment owned or rented by the Contractor but shall not include employees or
 Equipment of its Subcontractor, assignee, or agent. The Contractor shall submit to the Project
 Manager a request for Subcontractor approval before subcontracting Work and shall not
 circumvent this requirement by placing a Subcontractor’s employees on its payroll. The
 Department will treat a person or group generally operating as an independent Contractor, as
 independent Contractors for the purposes of this Section.
 The Department will provide the required forms for a list of intended Subcontractors and
 Material Suppliers in the Bid Package. The Contractor shall submit this list at the
 preconstruction conference and update the list as the Work progresses. The Contractor is
 responsible for ensuring that its Subcontractors are prequalified by the Department and are
 also duly licensed for the Work to be performed on the Project, are registered with all of the
 state agencies as is required to do business in New Mexico and to perform Work on Public
 Works Projects including the New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department and the New
 Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions or successor agencies, and are in compliance with
 all applicable state and federal laws and regulations including the New Mexico Public Works
 Minimum Wage Act. The Contractor shall comply with the New Mexico Subcontractor Fair
 Practices Act to the extent it is applicable to the Project.
 A Trucker is not a Subcontractor unless the Contractor is using the Trucker to meet the
 DBE requirement associated with the Project. A Trucker is an individual, partnership, firm,
 corporation, or joint venture that transports Materials to and from the Project and does not
 perform Work on the Project site. Transportation of Materials within the Project site (e.g.
 never leaves the Project limits) is Work performed by the Contractor or a Subcontractor.
 Transportation of Materials on or off the Project site (e.g. leaving the Project) does not require
 a Subcontract.
 Liability of the Contractor and the Contractor’s Surety under the Contract and the
 Contract Bonds shall not be waived or diminished by subcontracting or any other assignment
 of interest.
 The Contractor shall promptly pay its Subcontractors and Suppliers for satisfactory
 performance of their contracts no later than seven (7) Days after receipt of Progress Payment
 for the Subcontractor’s Work or Supplier’s Materials by the Department. For purpose of this
 section, a Subcontractor’s portion of the Work is satisfactorily completed when it is Accepted
 by the Department. In no event shall the Contractor and its Subcontractors fail to promptly
 pay their Subcontractors and Suppliers the amounts due for undisputed Accepted Work within
 seven (7) Days of the Contractor receiving a Progress Payment from the Department. The
 payment by the Department to the Contractor is not a condition precedent for payment by the
 Contractor to any Subcontractor or Supplier. A zero dollar ($0.00) Progress Payment by the
 Department does not relieve the Contractor from paying the Subcontractor or Supplier for
 Accepted Work.
 The Contractor’s failure to make timely or prompt Subcontractor or Supplier payments for
 undisputed Accepted Work is a Non-Conformance and shall result in the Department
 withholding 25% of the Progress Payment and may result in the Department rejecting the
 Section 108:
 
 Prosecution and Progress
 
 Page 70
 
 Contractor’s future Bids in accordance with Section 102.5, “Refusal or Rejection of Bids.” The
 Contractor’s repeated failure to make timely Subcontractor payment may lead to Suspension
 or Debarment in accordance with Section 102.3, “Suspension and Debarment.”
 108.2
 
 NOTICE TO PROCEED AND PRE-CONSTRUCTION CONFERENCE
 
 The Department will issue the Notice to Proceed within 30 Days after Contract execution,
 unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. The Notice to Proceed will identify the date the
 Department expects the Contractor to begin Work and the start of Contract Time. The
 Contractor’s commencement of the Work without a Notice to Proceed may be deemed a
 waiver of this notice and, in the absence of prior written permission from the Project Manager,
 shall start the Contract Time. In no event shall the Contractor commence Work until after
 execution of the Contract by all parties.
 After the issuance of the Notice to Proceed, the Project Manager shall provide written
 notice to the Contractor of the date, time and location of the Pre-Construction Conference.
 The Contractor shall provide an authorized Contract representative and the Project
 Superintendent at the Pre-Construction Conference.

 15. Other items and any other documents required by the Contract or as directed in the
 Project Manager’s notice of Pre Construction.
 Failure by the Contractor to provide the above listed items a minimum of ten (10) Days
 before the Pre-Construction Conference may result in the Contractor being in default of
 Contract pursuant to Section 108.9 “Default of Contract.” Contract Time shall commence as
 indicated in the Notice to Proceed and no additional Contract Time will be granted. The
 Section 108:

 Page 71
 
 Contractor shall not commence Work until the required items are provided to the Project
 Manager and Accepted.
 108.3
 
 SCHEDULE
 
 108.3.1
 
 Baseline Schedule
 
 The Project shall utilize a CPM format as the Baseline Schedule unless otherwise
 specified in the Contract.
 The Project Manager will notify the Contractor in writing within ten (10) Days of the
 submittal of a Baseline Schedule if the schedule is “Accepted,” “Accepted as noted”, or is
 “rejected.” Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, the Contractor is wholly and solely
 responsible for construction means, methods or techniques, therefore the Project Manager’s
 review of the Baseline Schedule will be for compliance with the Specifications and Contract
 requirements. Acceptance by the Project Manager shall not relieve the Contractor of any of its
 responsibilities for the accuracy or feasibility of the schedule. Any Baseline Schedule which
 alters Contract Time shall be deemed “rejected.” In no event, may approval of a Baseline
 Schedule revise the Contract Documents, including Contract Time, unless accompanied by a
 related Change Order. The Contractor shall not commence Work until the Project Manager
 Accepts a Baseline Schedule.
 The Department will use the Baseline Schedule to establish major construction
 operations, to determine Contract Time extensions, and to measure the progress of the Work.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for assuring all Work, including all Subcontractor Work, is
 included in the Baseline Schedule. The Contractor shall be responsible for assuring that all
 Work sequences are logical and that the Baseline Schedule indicates a coordinated plan.
 Failure by the Contractor to include any element of Work required for performance of the
 Contract shall not excuse the Contractor from completing all Work within the required time.
 For Baseline Schedules that are “rejected”, the Project Manager shall communicate, in
 writing, to the Contractor all portions of the schedule that are not in compliance with the
 Contract requirements. The Contractor shall, within seven (7) Days of receipt of the reasons
 for rejection of the schedule, provide a new Baseline Schedule and all additional information
 necessary for the Project Manager to “Accept” the Baseline Schedule. The Project Manager
 will notify the Contractor in writing within seven (7) Days of the submittal of the corrected
 Baseline Schedule if the schedule is “Accepted,” “Accepted as noted”, or is “rejected.” The
 Contractor’s failure to provide a timely and Acceptable new Baseline Schedule in response to
 a rejected schedule waives any Claim the basis of which would have been documented by an
 Acceptable Baseline Schedule.
 108.3.1.1
 
 CPM Baseline Schedule
 
 Unless otherwise specified in the Contract the Contractor shall provide a CPM Baseline
 Schedule which clearly describes the following:
 1.
 
 A reasonable and workable plan to complete the Work within the Contract Time;

 3.
 
 Activities in a format prescribed by the Department so the Department can readily
 identify the Work and measure the progress of each activity;
 
 4.
 
 The Project’s critical path;
 
 5.
 
 The milestones or other key dates specified in the Contract; and,
 
 6.
 
 Logic diagrams.
 
 The CPM Baseline Schedule shall consist of network diagrams and associated bar
 graphs and shall include a tabulation of each activity shown on the detailed network diagrams.
 Provide, at a minimum, the following information on the CPM Baseline Schedule:
 1.
 
 Activity description;
 
 2.
 
 Early start date (each activity);
 
 Section 108:
 
 Prosecution and Progress
 
 Page 72
 
 3.

 Total float and free float (each activity);
 
 6.
 
 Sequence and interdependence of activities;
 
 7.
 
 Workdays each week;
 
 8.
 
 Contractor designated holidays;
 
 9.
 
 Number of shifts per Day;
 
 10. Number of hours per shift;
 11. Scheduled Completion Date;
 12. Anticipated weather events based on historical data; and
 13. Resource Loading.
 The CPM Baseline Schedule shall include a report of projected Project completion,
 measured in dollars and time, on a monthly basis or at each Progress Payment cut-off date.
 Float contained in the CPM Baseline Schedule is not for the exclusive use or benefit of either
 the Department or the Contractor.
 108.3.2
 
 Schedule Format
 
 108.3.2.1
 
 CPM Schedule Format
 
 The Project shall utilize a CPM format as the Baseline Schedule unless otherwise
 specified in the Contract.
 The Contractor shall prepare and submit one (1) electronic copy and two (2) time-scaled
 color prints of the CPM Baseline Schedule, updated monthly schedule, and revised schedules
 using a Project scheduling software as directed by the Department that includes the following
 features:
 1.
 
 Ability to display the schedule as a Gantt chart;
 
 2.
 
 Ability to clearly display the critical path of scheduled activities apart from the noncritical scheduled activities;
 
 3.
 
 Ability to calculate and display total float and free float for each activity;
 
 4.
 
 Ability to clearly display the early start, late start, early finish and late finish dates for
 each activity; and,
 
 5.
 
 Ability to easily store and transfer the schedule as a file (or files) from one computer

 108.3.2.2
 
 Bar Graph Baseline Schedule
 
 If required by the Contract the Contractor shall submit the Baseline Schedule in bar graph
 form. The Baseline Schedule shall list Contract features or Work activities in sufficient detail
 to show a reasonable and workable plan to complete the Project within the Contract Time.
 The Contractor shall show the following on the bar graph Baseline Schedule:
 1.
 
 Each Work activity as a bar;
 
 2.
 
 Each activity’s planned start and Completion Dates;
 
 3.
 
 Each activity’s estimated cost and percent of Total Bid Amount;
 
 4.
 
 The overall Project cost;
 
 5.
 
 The planned Project Completion Date;
 
 6.
 
 The monthly projected percent complete in time and dollars;
 
 7.
 
 A plot of the monthly projected percent complete (in dollars) superimposed on the
 bar chart; and,
 
 8.
 
 Any approved Project suspensions and time extensions.
 
 Section 108:
 
 Prosecution and Progress
 
 Page 73
 
 108.3.3 Monthly and Revised Schedules
 For this Section “schedule” refers to CPM or Bar Graph as required by the Contract.
 Each activity in a monthly or revised schedule shall contain the same information required for
 the Baseline Schedule. The Contractor shall include in the schedule a report of projected
 percent complete, measured in dollars and time. An Acceptable schedule shall conform to
 Section 108.3.1 “Baseline Schedule.” In no event may Acceptance of a schedule revise the
 Contract Documents, including Contract Time, unless accompanied by a related Change
 Order. Any monthly or revised schedule which alters Contract Time shall be deemed
 “rejected.”
 If the Contractor fails to timely submit an updated or revised and Acceptable schedule,
 the Department shall withhold 25% of the Progress Payment as a Non-Conformance. The
 Department may suspend the Work pursuant to Section 105.1.2 “Department Authority to
 Suspend Work” for failure to submit the monthly schedule update or revision. Repeated failure
 to provide timely and Acceptable monthly or revised schedules may result in the Department
 rejecting the Contractor’s future Bids in accordance with Section 102.5, “Refusal or Rejection
 of Bids.” The Contractor’s repeated failure to provide timely and Acceptable monthly or
 revised schedules may lead to Suspension or Debarment in accordance with Section 102.3,
 “Suspension and Debarment.” Failure to timely provide a monthly or revised schedule waives
 any Claim the basis of which would have been documented by an Acceptable monthly or
 revised schedule.
 Float contained in the updated or revised Schedule is not for the exclusive use or benefit
 of either the Department or the Contractor, except as follows: float generated on critical path
 activities due to the acceleration of the Contractor’s performance, at the written direction of the
 Project Manager, shall be for the exclusive use of the Department; and, float generated on
 critical path activities due to the reduction or elimination of items including any time associated
 with VECP shall be for the exclusive use of the Department.
 The Department may grant time extensions only to the extent that the activities on the
 critical path of the CPM Baseline Schedule in effect at the time of the delay are impacted.
 108.3.3.1 Monthly Schedule Update
 The Contractor shall submit an updated schedule monthly a minimum of five (5) Days
 before the Progress Payment date. Failure by the Contractor is a Non-Conformance and 25%
 of the Progress Payment shall be withheld.
 108.3.3.2
 
 Contractor’s Independent Duty to Provide Schedule Revisions
 
 The Contractor shall provide a revised schedule and recovery plan to the Project
 Manager within five (5) Days of when it becomes apparent, or should have become apparent,
 to the Contractor that the Contractor cannot complete the Work within the Contact Time, when
 a noncritical item has become critical, or cannot meet the schedule due to the following:
 Section 104.2 “Significant Changes in Character of Work”, Section 104.3 “Differing Site
 Conditions”, Section 104.4 “Extra Work”, Section 107.12 “Environmental, Hazardous Materials
 and Cultural Resource Discoveries”, or any other cause which may give rise to a Claim.
 If the Contractor’s Work falls behind schedule the Contractor shall take such steps as
 may be necessary to mitigate damages and improve its progress including development of a
 recovery plan. For an Excusable Delay, Noncompensable Delay, Concurrent Delay,
 Nonexcusable Delay, or Inexcusable Delay, as those terms are identified in Section 109.11,
 “Compensation for Claims,” the Contractor shall consider as a minimum the following potential
 schedule mitigation techniques: increase the number of shifts, begin overtime operations, work
 extra days including weekends and holidays, or supplement its construction plant and submit,
 as provided in this Section, a revised schedule with a proposed recovery plan, as may be
 deemed necessary to demonstrate the manner in which the agreed rate of progress shall be
 regained, all at no cost to the Department. If the Delay cannot be mitigated, the Contractor
 shall promptly submit either a written request for an extension of the Contract Time pursuant
 Section 108:
 
 Prosecution and Progress
 
 Page 74
 
 to Section 105.19, “Notice of Potential Claim,” and Section 105.20, “Administrative Remedy,”
 or request approval of a late completion schedule and shall be liable for liquidated damages.
 The revised schedule shall show Contract Time, Project completion date and all
 additional information necessary for the Project Manager to “Accept” the revised schedule.
 The Contractor’s failure to provide a timely and Acceptable revised schedule waives any Claim
 the basis of which would have been documented by an Acceptable revised schedule.. The
 Project Manager will provide the Contractor with a decision in writing within ten (10) Days of
 receiving the revised schedule. The revised schedule shall become the current Accepted
 Baseline Schedule.
 108.3.3.3
 
 Schedule Revisions at Request of Department:
 
 If it becomes apparent to the Department that the Contractor cannot meet the schedule,
 or that a noncritical item has become critical, the Project Manager may request a schedule
 revision and recovery plan from the Contractor. The Contractor shall, within five (5) Days of
 receipt of the request provide a revised schedule showing Contract Time, Project completion
 date and all additional information necessary for the Project Manager to “Accept” the revised
 schedule. The Contractor’s failure to provide a timely and Acceptable response waives any
 Claim the basis of which would have been documented by an Acceptable revised schedule.
 The Project Manager will provide the Contractor with a decision in writing within ten (10) Days
 of receiving the revised schedule. The revised schedule shall become the current Accepted
 Baseline Schedule.
 108.3.3.4 Schedule Update and Revision Information
 The Contractor’s updated monthly and revised schedules shall conform to the
 requirements of Section 108.3.1 “Baseline Schedule” and shall show:
 1.
 
 Actual start and finish dates of each activity;
 
 2.
 
 Remaining duration of activities started but not yet completed;
 
 3.
 
 Delays and changes resulting from the addition, deletion or revisions to activities
 due to the issuance of a Change Order, change to an activity duration, changes to
 relationship between activities or changes to the planned sequence of work or the
 method and manner of its performance; and
 
 4.
 
 Narrative report describing;
 a.
 
 108.4
 
 Processes during the month;
 
 b.
 
 Shifts in the critical activities from the previous update;
 
 c.
 
 Sources of delay;
 
 d.
 
 Potential problem areas;
 
 e.
 
 Work planned for the next update period; and
 
 f.
 
 Changes made to the schedule.
 
 UNSATISFACTORY PROGRESS OF WORK
 
 The progress of the Work is deemed unsatisfactory when:
 1.
 
 The dollars earned by the Contractor on the Project are 15% less than the estimated
 dollars earned, as shown on the current Accepted baseline progress schedule;
 
 2.
 
 When the start of an activity on the critical path, as shown on the current Accepted
 progress schedule, has exceeded its late start date by seven (7) Days;
 
 3.
 
 When an activity on the critical path, as shown on the current Accepted progress
 schedule, has exceeded its original duration by ten (10) or more Days; or,
 
 4.
 
 When the Project Manager determines that the progress of work is unsatisfactory.
 
 The Project Manager shall issue a notice of unsatisfactory performance to the Contractor
 by certified mail and identify the unsatisfactory performance.
 Section 108:
 
 Prosecution and Progress
 
 Page 75
 
 When the progress of the Work is deemed unsatisfactory the Project Manager and the
 Contractor shall meet to address the schedule within five (5) Days. The Contractor shall
 provide a revised schedule with a narrative addressing Project progress compliance or
 anticipated liquidated damages. The Department’s approval of a late completion schedule will
 not operate as a waiver of the Department’s right to assess liquidated damages. If a
 resolution cannot be determined within five (5) Days, the Project Manager will issue a notice to
 the Contractor and Surety of unsatisfactory performance.
 The Contractor shall bring progress into compliance in a time frame determined by the
 Project Manager, not to exceed 30 Days and at no additional cost to the Department. Failure
 to return the Project into compliance may result in any or all of the following:
 1.
 
 Suspend or debar the Contractor in accordance with Section 102.3, “Suspension
 and Debarment”;
 
 2.
 
 Withhold Progress Payments in the amount of the projected liquidated damages and
 withhold 25% of Progress Payments pursuant to Section 109.8, “Progress
 Payments”;
 
 3.
 
 The Contractor being declared in default pursuant to Section 108.9, “Default of
 Contract”;
 
 4.
 
 Rejection of the Contractor’s bids; and,
 
 5.
 
 Other administrative actions that the Project Manager deems appropriate and in the
 best interest of the public and the Department.
 
 108.5
 108.5.1
 
 CHARACTER OF WORKERS, METHODS, AND EQUIPMENT
 Character of Workers
 
 The Contractor shall provide the resources necessary to complete the Work as specified.
 The Contractor shall ensure workers have the experience and skills to perform assigned Work.
 The Contractor shall remove employee(s) who performs the Work in an unskilled manner
 or who is intemperate or disorderly. The Contractor shall rehire these employees only with the
 Project Manager’s written permission.
 The Project Manager may suspend Work for failure to remove any employee(s) or to
 furnish suitable and sufficient personnel necessary to perform the Work.
 108.5.2
 
 Methods and Equipment
 
 The Contractor shall use Equipment of the size and mechanical condition to produce the
 Work. The Contractor shall ensure that the Equipment does not damage the Roadway,
 adjacent property or other Highways, Streets, or Roads.
 The Contractor shall request permission in writing to use methods or Equipment other
 than those specified; describe the proposed methods and Equipment to be used and the
 reasons for the change. The Contractor shall perform Work under original Basis of Payment
 and Contract Time. The Contractor shall discontinue use of alternate methods or Equipment
 when Work does not meet Contract requirements. The Contractor shall remove and replace
 or repair deficient Work at Contractor’s expense.
 108.6
 
 DETERMINATION AND EXTENSION OF CONTRACT TIME
 
 The Department will provide the Contract Time in the Invitation for Bids and on the Bid
 Form. If the Contract contains a Mandatory Completion Date, the Project must be
 Substantially Complete by that date.
 The Project Manager will provide the Contractor with a weekly statement showing the
 Contract Time, the number of Days charged to the Contract for the preceding week, the
 accumulated Days charged, and the number of Days remaining to complete the Work. The
 Contractor shall have seven (7) Days after receipt of the statement to file a written protest of
 Section 108:
 
 Prosecution and Progress
 
 Page 76
 
 Days charged. If the Contractor fails to timely file a written protest, the statement is deemed
 accepted by the Contractor.
 The Contractor is not entitled to a Partial Suspension during periods of traffic control
 operations or when working on any critical path activities. Partial suspension shall be lifted if
 the Contractor works on critical path activities and the Project Manager shall commence the
 Day count.
 Quantity overruns in Contract Items that do not significantly change the character of the
 Work in accordance with Section 104.2 “Significant Changes in the Character of the Work”,
 shall not result in an extension of Contract Time. If completion of the Contract requires Extra
 Work that impacts the critical path, the Contractor shall provide the Department an updated
 progress schedule and narrative requesting additional Contract Time associated with the Extra
 Work. Upon adequate justification by the Contractor the Department will determine if any
 adjustment in Contract Time is warranted.
 Any request for additional Contract Time shall be made pursuant Section 105.19 “Notice
 of Potential Claim.”
 If the Project Manager rejects a time extension request, the Contractor may proceed in
 accordance with Section 105.20, “Administrative Remedy.”
 When the Project Manager completes the final inspection in accordance with Section
 109.10 “Project Closure”, the daily time charge will stop on the date the Contractor completes
 all pay items, as determined by the Project Manager, or in accordance with Section 109.10.3
 “Termination of Contract Time”.
 108.7
 
 FAILURE TO COMPLETE ON TIME
 
 Liquidated damages shall be assessed for each Day the Work remains incomplete after
 Contract Time has expired, including approved time extensions.
 The Department may suspend time charges on the Contract when the Project is
 Substantially Complete.
 For Work that remains incomplete after the Contract Time expires, the Department shall
 deduct an amount (in accordance with Section 108.8, “Liquidated Damages”) from dollars due
 the Contractor, not as a penalty but as liquidated damages.
 The Department does not waive its rights under the Contract by allowing the Contractor
 to finish the Work after the expiration of Contract Time, including approved extensions.
 108.8
 
 LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
 
 Time is an essential element of the Contract, and it is important that the Contractor
 pursue timely completion of the Work. The Department’s Contract administration costs,
 including engineering, inspection, and supervision, will be increased as the time to complete
 the Work increases. The public is impacted and inconvenienced when a Project is incomplete
 and not available for use.
 The Contractor agrees that the following schedule of liquidated damages, unless
 otherwise specified in the Contract, represents the reasonable projected value of
 inconvenience and monetary damage to the public and the Department if the Contractor does
 not complete the Project within the Contract Time and does not operate as a penalty to the
 Contractor:
 Schedule of Liquidated Damages
 Total Original Contract Amount ($)
 Charge ($) per Day

 The Department shall withhold payment under the Contract and may seek performance
 from the Contractor’s Surety to cover the liquidated damages. The Department shall continue
 to assess liquidated damages until Physical Completion in accordance with Section 109.10
 “Project Closure.” When the Project Manager issues the notice of completion and final
 Acceptance, further assessment of liquidated damages will stop.
 If the amount of Liquidated Damages meets or exceeds the remaining dollar amount of
 Work remaining on the Contract the Department shall cease Progress Payments. The
 Contractor remains contractually obligated to complete the Work remaining on the Project.
 The Contractor shall reimburse the Department for any Liquidated Damages exceeding the
 dollar amount withheld from the Contractor within 30 Days of Physical Completion.
 108.9
 
 DEFAULT OF CONTRACT
 
 The Department may declare the Contractor in default of the Contract if the Contractor:
 1.
 
 Fails to perform the Work with sufficient resources (supervision, workers,
 Equipment, or Materials) to assure the completion of the Work;
 
 2.
 
 Performs the Work unsuitably, or neglects or refuses to remove Materials or to
 correct rejected Work;
 
 3.
 
 Fails to begin the Work within the time specified in the Notice to Proceed;
 
 4.
 
 Discontinues the Work;
 
 5.
 
 Fails to resume discontinued Work after the Department issues a request to resume
 Work;
 
 6.
 
 Becomes insolvent or is declared bankrupt, or files for reorganization under the
 bankruptcy code, or commits any act of bankruptcy or insolvency, either voluntarily
 or involuntarily;
 
 7.
 
 Allows a final judgment, in a suit filed in connection with this Contract, to stand
 unsatisfied for 30 Days;
 
 8.
 
 Makes an assignment, in connection with the Contract, for the benefit of its
 creditors;
 
 9.
 
 Fails to carry on the Work in an Acceptable manner in accordance with the Contract;
 
 10. Fails to comply with Contract requirements or willfully violates any term or condition
 of the Contract;
 11. Fails to perform the Work or maintain the Project in compliance with Federal and
 New Mexico Occupational Health and Safety laws and regulations;
 12. Fails to observe or comply with Federal and New Mexico laws and regulations, local
 laws and ordinances,
 13. Is debarred or suspended in accordance with the Section 102.3, “Suspension and

 accordance with Section 108.1., “Subcontracting”.
 The Project Manager will provide written notice to the Contractor and the Contractor’s
 Surety of Contractor’s delay, neglect, apparent default, or anticipatory repudiation. This notice
 Section 108:
 
 Prosecution and Progress
 
 Page 78
 
 will specify the Contract provisions that the Contractor violated and the corrective measures to
 be taken by the Contractor. When reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the
 performance of the Contract by the Contractor, the Project Manager may, in writing, demand
 adequate assurance of due performance and until such assurance is received may suspend
 any Department performance. If the Contractor or Surety does not proceed with the corrective
 measures within ten (10) Days, or when demanded fails to provide adequate assurance of due
 performance, after receiving the notice, the Department, upon written notification from the
 Project Manager, has full power and authority, without violating the Contract, to declare the
 Contractor in default, to remove the corrective measures from the Contractor, and to demand
 compliance by the Surety of the terms, conditions, and obligations contained in the
 Performance Bond.
 If the Department determines that the Contractor is in default the Surety shall complete
 the Work at its own expense pursuant to the Contract and receive the balance of any funds
 owing to the Contractor. If the Surety fails to complete the Work, the Department may
 complete the Project with its forces or may obtain another Contractor to complete the Work.
 The Department will deduct costs and charges that the Department incurs as a result of the
 default and the cost of completing the Work from Contract funds due to or which may become
 due to the defaulting Contractor or Surety. If the total costs for completing the Work exceeds
 the amount that would have been payable under the Contract, the defaulting Contractor and
 the Surety shall be jointly and severally liable for the excess costs.
 108.10
 
 TERMINATION OF CONTRACT; NO FAULT OF CONTRACTOR
 
 The Department may terminate, by written order, all or part of the Contract, after
 determining the following:
 1.
 
 That the Contractor is prevented from proceeding with or completing the Work as
 originally contracted for reasons beyond the control of the Contractor; or
 
 2.
 
 That termination would be in the public interest.
 
 Reasons for termination may include, but are not limited to, the following:
 1.
 
 Executive orders of the President of the United States relating to war or national
 defense;
 
 2.
 
 A national emergency that creates a serious shortage of Materials, as deemed by
 the Secretary;
 
 3.
 
 Orders from duly constituted authorities relating to energy conservation;
 
 4.
 
 Restraining orders or injunctions obtained by third party citizen actions resulting
 from national or local environmental protection laws or where the issuance of the
 order or injunction is primarily caused by acts or omissions of persons or agencies
 other than the Contractor; or,
 
 5.
 
 To correct any material errors or omissions in the Plans or to correct any
 discrepancy or contradictions within the Contract discovered after execution of the
 Contract by both parties and which could not have been discovered through the
 exercise of Pre-Bid Due Diligence, the failure of which to correct is likely to lead to
 Contractor Delay, a Claim for additional time, or a Claim for compensation which
 may exceed the costs recoverable under this Section.
 
 When the Department orders a Contract termination effective on a certain date, it will pay
 for the actual number of units or items of Work completed at the Bid Item Unit Price or as
 mutually agreed for items of Work partially completed or not started. For pay items eliminated
 by the termination, the Department will pay for items eliminated in their entirety in accordance
 with Section 109.7, “Eliminated Items.”
 The Department may obtain from the Contractor, at a negotiated cost, Acceptable
 unused Materials obtained by the Contractor for but not incorporated into the Work. The
 Contractor shall deliver this Material to a prescribed location or dispose of it as mutually
 agreed.
 Section 108:
 
 Prosecution and Progress
 
 Page 79
 
 After the Contractor receives the termination notice from the Department, the Contractor
 shall submit any Claim for additional damages or costs within 30 Days of the date of the
 Contractor’s termination or shall waive such Claim. The Contractor shall submit the Claim in
 accordance with Section 105.19 “Notice of Potential Claim,” and Section 105.20
 “Administrative Remedy.” The Claim shall be limited to the following cost items:
 1.
 
 Idle Equipment time using standby-time rental rates at 50% of the Blue Book
 Equipment rental rate, without the cost of operating personnel;
 
 2.
 
 Actual and direct Mobilization costs;
 
 3.
 
 Bidding and Project investigative costs;
 
 4.
 
 Accounting charges involved in Claim preparation;
 
 5.
 
 Unpaid Supplier costs;
 
 6.
 
 Idle labor costs if Work is stopped in advance of termination date;
 
 7.
 
 Guaranteed payments for private land usage as part of original Contract; and
 
 8.
 
 An additional ten percent (10%) of the total of the above items 1, 2, 5, and 6 to
 cover home office overhead and salaried labor expenses.
 
 The Contractor shall provide those records required by Section 105.20.1, “District Level,”
 to the Department to determine the validity and amount of each Claim item. The Contractor
 shall not be entitled to recover anticipated loss of profits or any category of damages excluded
 pursuant to Section 109.11, “Compensation for Claim.”
 Full or partial Contract termination does not relieve the Contractor of its contractual
 responsibilities for the completed Work, nor will it relieve the Surety of its obligation for Claims
 arising out of the completed Work.

 Department will pay the transportation cost for each piece of Equipment once.
 Under unusual circumstances the Contractor may provide to the Department written
 justification for additional transportation costs;
 
 4.
 
 The Contractor shall only be paid the operating rate for those hours the Equipment
 is actually in use. A standby rate for Equipment required to be at the Work site but
 not operating may by paid by the Department if agreed to in writing in advance by
 the Project Manager in which case the Department will pay for standby Equipment
 using standby-time rental rates at 50% of the Blue Book Equipment rental rate,
 without the cost of operating personnel.
 
 5.
 
 The regional difference percentage, as described in the Blue Book does not apply.
 However, the factors in the Rate Adjustment Tables of the Blue Book do apply;
 
 6.
 
 Overtime, as described in Blue Book does not apply. The Department will pay for

 Department will pay for said Materials at Contractor’s actual cost and take ownership.
 109.8
 
 PROGRESS PAYMENTS
 
 The Department will make Progress Payments at least once each month as the Work
 progresses. The Project Manager will prepare and post Progress Payments based on
 estimates of the value of the Work performed and Materials complete-in-place, and in
 accordance with Section 109.9, “Stockpile” and minus price reductions within five (5) Days of
 the estimate cut-off date.
 The Department will include in the Progress Payments monies associated with accepted
 fully executed Change Orders, this shall be included within the next regularly scheduled
 Progress Payment or within 60 Days.
 The Project Manager shall process a Progress Payment on a monthly basis regardless of
 the dollar amount, including zero dollar ($0.00), owed the Contractor. The Department will not
 make a payment when the total value of the Work completed since the last Progress Payment

 Manager approves such payment.
 109.8.1
 
 Retainage
 
 The Department will make Progress Payments to the Contractor in accordance with
 Section 109.8 “Progress Payments”. The Department will pay 100% of the value of Work
 performed and Materials complete in place in accordance with Section 109.9, “Stockpile”, until
 the sum of the Progress Payments made equals 95% of the Total Original Contract Amount as
 amended by Change Order. The Department will continue to make additional Progress
 Payments in the sum of zero dollars ($0.00) after the Total Original Contract Amount as
 amended by Change Order equals 95% and until the Contractor completes the Work in an
 acceptable manner. The five percent (5%) retained when the Progress Payments equals 95%
 of the Total Original Contract Amount as amended by Change Order is the amount considered
 necessary to protect the interests of the public and the Department; those interests include
 ensuring that the Work is Acceptable, on schedule, in compliance with the Contract, and that
 the Work reaches Substantial Completion and final Acceptance. Subject to other deductions
 the amount retained shall be provided to the Contractor in accordance with Section 109.10
 “Project Closure.”
 109.8.2 Non-Conformance
 If the Contractor fails to comply with all material terms and conditions of the Contract the
 Department shall withhold an additional 25% as a Non-Conformance from each Progress
 Payment and subsequent Progress Payments in addition to Retainage until the Contractor
 fully complies with the Contract. Release of Non-Conformance withholdings shall be
 processed at the next scheduled Progress Payment after the resolution of the NonConformance.
 Nothing in this section prevents the Department from withholding application and
 certification for payment because of the following: unsatisfactory job progress, defective
 construction not remedied, disputed Work, third party Claims filed or reasonable evidence that
 a Claim will be filed, failure of the Contractor to make timely or prompt payments for labor,
 Equipment, and Materials, damage to the Department, reasonable evidence that the Work

 The Contractor is not entitled to payment for Work or that portion of Work that is the
 subject of a disputed Claim; the Department shall pay undisputed monies due for Accepted
 Work. The Contractor is not entitled to late payment charges, including late payment charges
 pursuant to NMSA 1978, § 13-1-158, associated with any Claim or disputed construction
 services and Materials. The Department will pay the Contractor late payment charges as
 authorized by NMSA 1978, § 13-1-158 for construction services and Materials not the subject
 of a disputed Claim or subject to Retainage or withheld Progress Payments and that have
 been certified by the Department to have been received and Accepted. The Department will
 pay the Contractor late payment charges on undisputed, qualified, delayed Progress
 Payments for certified, approved and Accepted Work in accordance with Section 109.8,
 “Progress Payments” that are not the subject of a disputed Claim.
 The Contractor is barred from seeking a Claim, a remedy, compensation, time, cause of
 action, or any damages except as provided by Section 105.19, “Notice of Potential Claim,” and
 Section 105.20 “Administrative Remedy,” and this Section.
 The Contractor shall not be entitled to any consequential, indirect, punitive, exemplary,
 special, or incidental damages and shall only be entitled to additional compensation and time
 as specifically provided by the following Sections of these Specifications: Section 104.2,
 “Significant Change in the Character of the Work”; Section 104.3, “Differing Site Condition”;
 Section 104.4, “Extra Work”; Section 107.10.3, “Cooperation with Owner of Railroad Right of
 Way”; Section 108.6, “Determination and Extension of Contract Time”; Section 108.10,
 “Termination of Contract; No Fault of Contractor”; Section 109, “Measurement and Payment”;
 and this Section.
 Except as otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Department in a written Change
 Order, all Claims and causes of action arising out of the performance and administration of the
 Contract, including Claims for Delay, Claims for additional compensation and time, Contract
 adjustment, Claims seeking extension of Contract Time, Claims seeking Delay damages,
 pass-through Subcontractor Claims, causes of action for breach of Contract, promissory
 estoppel, equitable estoppel, waiver, detrimental reliance, bad faith breach of contract, breach
 of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or any other cause of action arising out of the
 performance of the Work or the Contract shall be governed by this Section. The
 compensation, time and damages provided for in this Section are exclusive, complete, and
 apply regardless of whether such Claims are to be resolved pursuant to the procedures set
 forth in Section 105.20, “Administrative Remedy,” or any other legal or administrative
 procedure, whether or not authorized herein, including arbitration, mediation, or appeal.
 Delay. The term “Delay” does not include time extensions granted by the Department by
 Change Order in accordance with Section 108.6, “Determination and Extension of Contract
 Time” that do not result in any additional compensation.
 The Contractor’s entitlement to compensation and time with regard to a Delay is defined,
 limited to, and provided as follows:
 1.
 
 Excusable Delay: A Delay beyond the Contractor’s control that negatively impacts
 the critical path of the Project and is not caused, in whole or in part, by the
 Contractor’s fault or negligence and for which a time extension, but not additional
 compensation, may be granted;
 
 2.
 
 Compensable Delay: An Excusable Delay that negatively impacts the critical path
 of the Project resulting from the neglect or default of the Department or from
 Differing Site Conditions. For such Delays, the Department may grant additional
 time and compensation. Examples of a Compensable Delay includes Delays
 attributable to design errors not readily discovered through Pre-Bid Due Diligence,
 failure by the Department to acquire Right of Way, and Department-initiated design
 changes;
 
 3.
 
 Noncompensable Delay: An unforeseen and unanticipated Excusable Delay not
 caused by the fault of either the Contractor or the Department that negatively
 impacts the critical path of the Project. For such delays, the Contractor may receive
 
 Section 109:
 
 Measurement and Payment
 
 Page 90
 
 an extension of time but not additional compensation. Examples of a
 Noncompensable Delay includes Delays attributable to utility conflicts, widespread
 Materials shortages, extreme weather, war, acts of God, and labor strikes.
 4.
 
 Concurrent Delay: A Delay for which the Contractor is not entitled to compensation
 that occurs when both the Contractor and the Department independently Delay
 work, or that occurs when the Contractor is responsible for an Excusable or
 Compensable Delay and also encounters a Differing Site Condition, which
 negatively impacts critical path activities during approximately the same time period
 or when separate Delays to the critical path occur at approximately the same time.
 The Contractor is not entitled to compensation due to or arising from a Concurrent
 Delay. The Contractor is not entitled to an extension of Contract Time for any
 period in which a Non-excusable Delay is concurrent with an Excusable Delay.
 When a Noncompensable Delay is concurrent with a Compensable Delay, the
 Contractor may be entitled to an extension of Contract Time but not entitled to
 compensation for the period the Noncompensable delay is concurrent with the
 Compensable Delay.
 
 5.
 
 Inexcusable Delay or Nonexcusable Delay: a Delay for which the Contractor is not
 entitled to compensation or time that was caused by: factors within the Contractor’s
 control; the fault or responsibility of the Contractor; factors that could or should
 have reasonably been foreseen by the Contractor; Delays caused by an event that
 the Contractor could have foreseen and prevented but failed to do so; or failure to
 reasonably mitigate a Delay. Examples of inexcusable or nonexcusable Delays
 include those attributable to reasonably expected seasonal inclement weather
 events, reasonable time periods necessary for reviews of shop drawings by the
 Department, for changes or additions to the Work that do not negatively impact the
 critical path of the Project, inefficient operation, inefficient or ineffective construction
 management, failure by the Contractor to properly perform Pre-Bid Due Diligence,
 failure by the Contractor to procure Materials in a timely manner, or failure by the
 Contractor to assign sufficient resources to the Project.
 
 6.
 
 Non-critical Disruption: a disruption or interference with Contractor’s performance,
 regardless of cause, that does not negatively impact the critical path of the Project
 and therefore does not meet the definition of a Delay and for which the Contractor
 receives neither compensation nor time.
 
 Additional time for Delay. The Department may only extend Contract Time for an
 Excusable Delay, Compensable Delay, or a Non-compensable Delay. The Department may
 only grant an extension of Contract Time for an Excusable Delay using the Acceptable
 updated monthly or revised schedules current at the time the Delay occurred.
 Compensation for Delay. The Department may only compensate the Contractor for a
 non-Concurrent, Compensable Delay as provided in this Section. In order to receive
 compensation for a Delay the Contractor shall document costs resulting from the Delay using
 actual cost records, shall measure expenses using generally accepted accounting principles,
 and shall comply with Section 108.3.2, “Schedule Format,” and Section 105.20.1, “District
 Level.” The compensation which the Contractor may recover for a Delay Claim is limited to:
 1.
 
 Non-salaried labor expenses;
 
 2.
 
 Material costs;
 
 3.
 
 Equipment costs pursuant to Section 109.2 “Approved Equipment Rental Rates”;
 
 4.
 
 Costs of extended job site overhead, including bonds; or,
 
 5.
 
 An additional ten percent (10%) of the total of items 1, 2, 3, and 4 to cover home
 office overhead, salaried labor expenses, and profit.
 
 The Department reserves the right to use innovative bidding approaches, as specified in
 the Contract, as an alternate means of calculating Delay damages including requiring Bidders
 to bid a daily overhead rate (cost / Working Day) as a Bid Item Unit Price. If the Contract
 requires that the Contractor escrow its Bid documents, the escrow Bid Documents may be
 considered in resolving Claims.
 Section 109:
 
 Measurement and Payment
 
 Page 91
 
 If the source of the loss of productivity and Compensable Delay cannot be isolated and
 priced separately, the method by which the Department shall calculate the extent of an
 Excusable Delay caused by a production rate inefficiency shall be made in the following order
 of priority:
 1.
 
 Measured Mile analysis by which the Department shall compare actual efficiency
 (production rates) in an impacted area to actual efficiency in a comparable nonimpacted area;
 
 2.
 
 Comparison of actual efficiency to actual efficiency on a comparable project; and,
 
 3.
 
 Comparison of actual efficiency to planned efficiency taking into account the
 Contractor’s Baseline Schedule and timely submitted Acceptable updated monthly
 or revised schedules.
 
 In no event shall the Department make a payment based on application of the Eichleay
 formula, the Total Cost Method or other formula including original Contract period formula,
 fixed overhead formula, burden fluctuation method, and comparative absorption rates.
 Non-Allowable Damages. Regardless of the basis or cause of the Claim, the Contractor
 may not recover and is not entitled to recover the following categories of damage:
 1.
 
 Any compensation except as provided by Section 109.11 “Compensation for
 Claims” and for Delay;
 
 2.
 
 Loss of anticipated profit, incentives or bonuses;
 
 3.
 
 Labor inefficiencies;
 
 4.
 
 Home office overhead regardless of whether it is characterized as absorbed,
 unabsorbed, or extended exceeding that provided in Section 109.11 “Compensation
 for Claims”;
 
 5.
 
 Home office overhead, extended home office overhead, or Delay damages
 calculated using the Eichleay formula or other formula including original Contract
 period formula, fixed overhead formula, burden fluctuation method, and comparative
 absorption rates;
 
 6.
 
 Any indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, including, but not limited
 to, lost or impaired bonding capacity, loss of Bidding and contracting opportunities,
 loss of credit standing, cost of financing, interest paid, lost Material discounts,
 economic loss, loss of reputation, loss of other Work, loss of use, loss of business
 opportunity, loss of product or output, income, loss of profit or revenue, cost of
 capital, financing, and for loss of management or employee productivity or of the
 services of such persons, other not Project direct costs, and business devastation,
 bankruptcy, or insolvency. The Department waives any entitlement to consequential
 damages from the Contractor other than liquidated damages as provided in the
 Contract;
 
 7.
 
 Acceleration costs and expenses, except where the Department has expressly and
 specifically directed the Contractor in writing to accelerate the Work at the
 Department’s expense;
 
 8.
 
 Indirect costs or expenses;
 
 9.
 
 Late payment charges, including late payment charges pursuant to NMSA 1978, §
 13-1-158, related to any disputed Claim, or on any judgment or award made to the
 Contractor. This provision does not affect the Department’s payment of late
 payment charges on undisputed, qualified, delayed Progress Payments for certified,
 approved and Accepted Work in accordance with Section 109.8, “Progress
 Payments” that are not the subject of a disputed Claim;
 
 10. Prejudgment or post-judgment interest related to or arising from any disputed Claim
 or on any Award made to the Contractor; or,
 11. Attorneys’ fees and costs, Claim preparation expenses, and litigation or other costs
 related to or arising from any disputed Claim, or prosecution thereof.

 203.3.3.1.6
 
 Blasting Test Sections
 
 Demonstrate the adequacy of proposed Blasting Plan with a blasting test section(s) for
 material of different geologic characteristics. For Projects involving multiple cuts in similar
 geologic Materials, the Project Manager may reduce the requirement for a blasting test section
 in each cut. Blasting test sections include drilling, blasting, and excavating cut sections
 approximately 100 ft long to determine the optimal combination of method, blast hole spacing,
 and charge. When field conditions warrant, the Project Manager may direct the Contractor to
 use test section lengths less than 100 ft long.
 Blasting test section requirements include the following:
 1.
 
 Perform the blasting test section in accordance with Section 203.3.3.1, “Blasting
 Requirements.” Prepare and submit a Detailed Blasting Plan for the test section to
 the Project Manager at least 48 h before the planned time of the blast. Do not start
 blasting the test section until the Project Manager approves the Detailed Blasting
 Plan;
 
 2.
 
 Unless the Contractor’s Detailed Blasting Plan indicates otherwise, begin the tests
 with the controlled blast holes spaced at 30 inches;
 
 3.
 
 After blasting, remove a sufficient amount of material from the test section to
 determine if the blast hole diameter, blast hole spacing, and amount of explosives
 are adequate to provide the required backslope. Do not continue drilling of the test
 section area until the test section is excavated and the Department evaluates the
 results.
 
 If, at any time during the progress of the main blasting operation, the methods of drilling
 and blasting do not produce the desired results, revise and retest the blasting techniques until
 a technique produces the required results. The Department will consider the results to be
 unsatisfactory if:
 1.
 
 There is an excessive amount of breakage beyond the indicated lines and grade;
 
 2.
 
 There is excessive flyrock;
 
 3.
 
 The final backslope within the specified tolerances is not uniform;
 
 4.
 
 Ground vibration and air blast levels exceed limits as stated in Section 617,
 “Vibration Monitoring;”
 
 5.
 
 There are violations of other requirements of the Specifications;
 
 6.
 
 The slopes are unstable;
 
 7.
 
 The safety of the public is jeopardized;
 
 8.
 
 Property or natural features are endangered.

 Blasting Execution
 
 203.3.3.1.7.1
 
 Notification and Schedule
 
 The following requirements will apply to the notification and scheduling of blasting
 procedures:
 1.
 
 Coordinate blasting operations with the Project Manager and notify the Project
 Manager a minimum of 1.5 h before the blast. Provide a one-hour timeframe for the
 blast. For example, if the Contactor notifies the Project Manager by 9:00 a.m. the
 blast may occur between 10:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m.;
 
 2.
 
 Provide notice to the required federal, State, and local agencies before each blast,
 as required by the blasting permits;
 
 3.
 
 Notify occupants of buildings and owners of Structures and utilities of the blast time
 and location at least 48 h before the start of drilling or blasting;
 
 4.
 
 Detonate blasts at the planned time, unless approved otherwise by the Project
 Manager.
 
 203.3.3.1.7.2
 
 General Requirements
 
 Cover the blast area with blasting mats, soil, or another equally serviceable material,
 before firing blasts in areas where flying rock may result in personal injury or damage to
 property or the Work.
 203.3.3.1.7.3
 
 Controlled Blasting Requirements
 
 Perform controlled blasting in accordance with the Detailed Blasting Plans that produced
 acceptable results in blasting test sections. Perform control blasting using either pre-splitting
 or cushion blasting in accordance with the following requirements:
 1.
 
 If the overburden does not support the drill holes, completely remove the
 overburden soil and loose rock along the top of the cut to expose the rock surface
 before drilling the controlled blast holes;
 
 2.
 
 Mechanically monitor the blast hole angles;
 
 3.
 
 Drill and space blast holes with a nominal diameter from two (2) inch to three
 (3) inch, in accordance with the blasting test sections or the results achieved in
 similar geologic Materials. Do not exceed three (3) ft;
 
 4.
 
 Use proper Equipment and technique to ensure that no blast holes deviate from the
 plane of the backslope shown in the Plans by more than eight (8) inches, parallel or
 normal to the slope. The Department will not pay for blast holes exceeding these
 limits unless the Project Manager approves the obtained slopes;
 
 5.
 
 Drill the controlled blast holes at the required slope inclination, to the full depth of
 the cut, or to a pre-determined stage elevation. The maximum drill depth is 30 ft.
 Use shallower holes if the directional control is inadequate. If more than five
 percent (5%) of the controlled blast holes are misaligned in any one (1) lift, reduce
 the height of the lifts until the eight (8) inch tolerance is met. The length of
 controlled blast holes may be incrementally increased once satisfactory directional
 control and blast results are demonstrated;
 
 6.
 
 Drill unloaded and un-stemmed guide holes to the same diameter, in the same
 plane, and to the same tolerance as the controlled blast holes;
 
 7.
 
 The Department will allow a maximum offset of 24 inches from the bottom of each
 lift to allow for drill Equipment clearances, when the cut requires more than one (1)
 lift. Begin drilling the control blast hole at a point that allows the necessary offsets,
 and adjust at the start of lower lifts as necessary to compensate for drift in the upper
 lifts;
 
 8.
 
 Do not use horizontal blast holes for controlled blasting;
 
 9.
 
 Use explosive charges, detonating cord, and other items necessary for the blasting
 operation in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations and instructions;
 
 Section 203:
 
 Excavation, Borrow, and Embankment

 necessary to prevent the walls of the hole from collapsing;
 
 Use casing if
 
 11. Use only standard explosives manufactured especially for the type of controlled
 blasting (cushion or pre-splitting). Do not load ammonium nitrate and fuel oil in the
 controlled blast holes. Use explosives and blasting accessories appropriate for the
 conditions of the blast hole (including water in the holes) and necessary to achieve
 satisfactory results;
 12. Assemble and affix continuous column cartridge-type explosives to the detonating
 cord in accordance with the explosive manufacturer's instructions;
 13. The bottom charge in a blast hole may be larger than the charges above, but not
 large enough to cause overbreak. Place the top charge far enough below the collar
 and sufficiently reduced in size to avoid overbreaking or heaving;
 14. Use a dry, angular, and granular material that passes a 3/8 inch sieve to stem the
 controlled blast holes, from the top charge to the hole collar.
 203.3.3.1.7.4
 
 Pre-Split Blasting
 
 Perform pre-split blasting in accordance with Section 203.3.3.1.7.3, “Controlled Blasting
 Requirements,” and the following requirements:
 1.
 
 Detonate the pre-split blast holes before drilling for production blasting; or fire the
 pre-split blast holes at least 75 ms before the production holes if detonated in the
 same blast;
 
 2.
 
 Fire pre-split blast holes simultaneously, unless ground vibrations, noise, or air blast
 are excessive. Fire pre-split holes in delayed sections and reduce the charge
 weight per delay to mitigate excessive effects;
 
 3.
 
 The line of pre-split blast holes will extend beyond the limits of the production blast
 holes to be detonated. The minimum length of this extension will be 30 ft or to the
 end of the cut, but will not be greater than one-half of the distance of the expected
 blast advance;
 
 4.
 
 Do not perform pre-split blasting if the distance between the controlled blast line and
 free face is less than 20 ft or less than three (3) times the blast hole depth,
 whichever is greater.
 
 203.3.3.1.7.5
 
 Cushion Blasting
 
 Perform cushion blasting in accordance with item No. 3 of Section 203.3.3.1.7.3,
 Controlled Blasting Requirements,” and the following requirements:
 1.
 
 Perform cushion blasting as part of the final shot after other blasting is finished;
 
 2.
 
 If the final shot includes production blast holes, detonate the cushion blast no more
 than 75 ms or less than 25 ms after the production blast;
 
 3.
 
 Fire cushion blast holes simultaneously, unless ground vibrations, noise, or air blast
 are excessive. Fire cushion blast holes in delayed sections and reduce the charge
 weight per delay to mitigate excessive effects.
 
 203.3.3.1.7.6
 
 Production Blasting
 
 Perform production blasting in accordance with the Blasting Plan that produced
 acceptable results in blasting test sections and the following requirements:
 1.
 
 Minimize blast damage to the final excavation backslope;
 
 2.
 
 Drill buffer rows of production blast holes on a plane approximately parallel to the
 controlled blast line;
 
 3.
 
 Place the buffer row of production blast holes no closer than 6 ft to the controlled
 blast line unless the Contractor can prove the final excavation backslope will not be
 damaged by the production blast;
 
 4.
 
 Where necessary to minimize damage to the excavation backslope, load blast holes
 in the buffer row lighter than other production holes;
 
 Section 203:
 
 Excavation, Borrow, and Embankment

 conditions as necessary to achieve satisfactory results.
 203.3.3.1.7.7
 
 Scaling and Stabilization of Slopes Established by Controlled Blasting
 
 Perform scaling and stabilization of slopes established by controlled blasting in
 accordance with the following requirements:
 1.
 
 Observe the entire blast area following a blast before starting Work in the cut. If any
 rocks are loose, hanging, or potentially dangerous within a blast area, the
 Contractor shall remove them. Scale slopes by hand using a standard steel mine
 scaling rod. Use other methods to supplement or in lieu of hand scaling, such as,
 machine scaling, hydraulic splitters, or light blasting, if approved by the Project
 Manager;
 
 2.
 
 Slopes shall be scaled and stabilized before further construction activities take
 place. Scale slopes throughout the span of the Contract and as often as necessary
 to keep the slopes free of hazardous loose rock or overhangs;
 
 3.
 
 Cease blasting operations if the following conditions exist:
 3.1. There is an excessive amount of breakage beyond the specified lines and
 grade;
 3.2. There is excessive flyrock;
 3.3. The final backslope within the specified tolerances is not uniform;
 3.4. Ground vibration and air blast levels exceed limits specified in Section 617,
 “Vibration Monitoring;”
 3.5. There are violations of other requirements of the Specifications;
 3.6. The slopes are unstable;
 3.7. The safety of the public is jeopardized;
 3.8. Property or natural features are endangered.
 
 203.3.4
 
 Borrow
 
 Obtain the borrow source, unless otherwise specified. Use Roadbed excavated Material
 for Embankment before using borrow Material, unless approved by the Project Manager. If
 the Contractor places more than the specified amount of borrow and causes a waste of
 excavation, the Department will deduct the wasted amount from the borrow volume, as
 measured in the borrow area. After excavation is complete, blade the borrow areas and leave
 in a condition to allow accurate payment measurements by cross sectioning. Restore Right of
 Way fencing removed for borrow operations to its original condition or better. Prevent livestock
 from entering Right of Way.
 203.3.5 Embankments
 Do not place Embankment Material on frozen earth, or incorporate frozen soils in
 Embankments. Suspend Embankment construction if Embankment Materials become frozen.
 Do not resume until the Materials are thawed and suitable for compaction. Before beginning
 Embankment construction, perform scalping in accordance with Section 201, “Clearing and
 Section 203:
 
 Excavation, Borrow, and Embankment
 
 Page 103
 
 Grubbing.” Bench new Embankments into the following:
 1.
 
 Natural slopes including rock;
 
 2.
 
 Existing Embankments; or
 
 3.
 
 Phased Embankment construction.
 
 Ensure benches are wide enough to allow operation and placement of compacting
 Equipment. Re-compact new Embankment Material and Material that is cut out at no
 additional cost to the Department. Do not place rock, broken concrete, or other solid Materials
 in Embankment areas where driven pilings, drilled caissons, utility lines, or other Structures
 are specified in the Plans.
 203.3.5.1
 
 Roadbed Embankments
 
 Break up the original ground surface to at least six (6) inches by plowing, scarifying, or
 stepping up.
 Compact this area to 95% of maximum density in accordance with
 Section 203.3.8, “Moisture and Density Control.” Place Material for Roadbed Embankment in
 horizontal layers not exceeding eight (8) inches thick and compact in accordance with Section
 203.3.8, “Moisture and Density Control.”
 The Department will allow rocks no larger than three (3) ft (in any dimension) as long as
 the Contractor distributes and fills the interstices to form a dense mass. If the interstices
 between the rock fragments cannot be completely filled and compacted, use bridging
 geotextile over the top of the rock fragments to prevent the overlying Embankment Material
 from filling the interstices. Do not use rock fragments that may degrade with time or may be
 water sensitive (such as shale or gypsum) as rock fill in Roadbed Embankments. The
 Department considers this material to be unsuitable.
 Place large rocks in the toe of the slope in accordance with the following requirements:
 1.
 
 No rock is larger than one-half the Embankment height or ten (10) ft;
 
 2.
 
 No rock is placed in fill height less than eight (8) ft, measured at the edge of the
 Roadway Shoulder;
 
 3.
 
 Place rocks inside a line six (6) inches from the slope stake, space a minimum of
 three (3) ft from edge to edge, and cover with approved Embankment Material.
 
 Construct rock Embankments to a maximum of six (6) inches below Subgrade elevation.
 Consolidate rock fills by using the appropriate Equipment and methods approved by the
 Project Manager.
 203.3.5.2
 
 Non-Roadbed Embankment
 
 Construct non-roadbed Embankments in accordance with Section 203.3.5.1, “Roadbed
 Embankments,” except, if the Embankment Material consists of rock, place the rock in layers
 of sufficient depth to contain the largest rock in the Material, and carefully distribute and fill the
 interstices to form a dense mass.
 203.3.6
 
 Subexcavation
 
 Remove unsuitable Materials from the Subgrade unless an alternative treatment is
 agreed upon by the Project Manager.
 203.3.7
 
 Unstable Subgrade Stabilization
 
 Areas that have been proof rolled and lack sufficient stability in the opinion of the Project
 Manager shall be treated as unstable Subgrade.
 Prior to placement of the base material, the stabilized Subgrade shall be proof rolled with
 a roller having a minimum weight of 30 tons and shall exhibit no displacement when proof
 rolled.
 Section 203:
 
 Excavation, Borrow, and Embankment
 
 Page 104
 
 The Contractor shall stabilize unstable Subgrade using acceptable chemical or
 mechanical methods meeting an equivalent R-value as approved by the State Pavement
 Design Engineer.
 203.3.8
 
 Moisture and Density Control
 
 Maximum dry density of all soil types encountered or used will be determined in
 accordance with AASHTO T 180 (Modified Proctor), Method D (TTCP Modified) and AASHTO
 T 224.
 Construct Roadbed, Roadbed Embankment, non-roadbed Embankment, and Roadway
 Median excavation or Embankment, with moisture and density control. Compact each layer of
 Embankment to at least 95% of maximum density. Ensure the moisture content of the soil, at
 the time of compaction, is not greater than or five percent (5%) less than the optimum level.
 For soils with a plasticity index of 15 or greater, ensure the moisture content of the soil at the
 time of compaction is from optimum moisture to optimum moisture plus four percent (4%). If
 the moisture content at the time of compaction is not within the specified range, moisten or dry
 the Material, then thoroughly mix the Material to the full lift depth before re-compacting.
 Roadbed Embankments that contain mostly rock or coarse-grained Material (65% or greater
 retained on the No. 4 sieve) does not require moisture and density control, except the top six
 (6) inches of the Embankment; construct in accordance with Section 207.3, “Construction
 Requirements.” Non-roadbed Embankments of rock Material will not require moisture and
 density control unless otherwise specified.
 Ensure field densities are in accordance with AASHTO T 310 or other approved methods.
 Measure densities at each lift before the next subsequent lift is placed in accordance with
 Material Testing Requirements.

 203.4.1
 
 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 Rock Excavation
 
 The Department will measure Rock Excavation based on the estimated percentages if
 shown in the Contract, unless otherwise requested by the Contractor.
 If the Contractor requests, the Department will measure Rock Excavation in its original
 position for material classified as Rock Excavation in accordance with Section 203.2.1.1,
 “Rock Excavation.” Before excavation, the Contractor and Project Manager must agree on the
 limits of material classified as rock excavation. Calculate volumes in accordance with
 Section 203.4.3, “Unclassified Excavation, Borrow, and Subexcavation.”
 Include in
 measurements the overbreakage in rock excavation a maximum of ten (10) inches beyond the
 backslope specified in the Plans or directed by the Project Manager. The Department will use
 the blaster’s drill-hole log cards to determine the quantities of rock excavation covered by soil
 or overburden. Provide these log cards as part of the surveying records.
 203.4.2
 
 Controlled Blasting
 
 The Department will measure Controlled Blasting by the blast holes drilled along the final
 line, whether loaded or not; and will measure the lengths from the top of the rock surface to
 the elevation of the Roadway ditch or to a bench elevation set by the Project Manager. The
 Department based the quantities for Controlled Blasting shown in the Plans on assumed blast
 hole spacing; the actual quantities depend on field conditions and the results from test
 sections.
 203.4.3
 
 Unclassified Excavation, Borrow, and Subexcavation
 
 Measure unclassified excavation, borrow, and subexcavation in its original position. The
 measurements for subexcavation will include approved excavation of rock, shale, muck, or
 other unsuitable material, and its placement in the required Embankment or disposal as
 directed by the Project Manager. Cross-sectional measurements for subexcavation shall be
 taken before backfill is placed.

 210.3.1
 
 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 General
 
 Excavate material to the elevations established by the Contract Plans. Do not remove
 material, except unstable material, below the final grade, if placing footings on excavated
 surfaces other than rock. Remove rock and other unyielding foundation material a maximum
 12 inches below the bottom of the Structure. Clean rock seams and cavities, and fill with
 concrete or grout. Use concrete (of the same class as the footing) to backfill areas outside the
 neat lines or below the final grade of the footing bottom, at no additional cost to the
 Department. The Contractor may use excavated surpluses of suitable Material in the
 construction of Embankments, but must dispose of unsuitable material. Notify the Project
 Manager after each footing excavation. Do not place footings until the Project Manager
 approves the excavation depth and the foundation material.
 Dewater wet pits for inspection and for construction of footings. When necessary, install
 well-braced cofferdams, built as watertight as practical. Do not use timber or bracing inside
 cofferdams that cannot be removed without damage to the concrete. Make temporary
 Structures large enough to provide ample room for pile driving, form construction, inspection,
 and sump pumps. Straighten or move cofferdams that threaten to damage the Structure.
 Submit to the Project Manager Working Drawings showing proposed methods of constructing
 cofferdams, cribs, shoring, or similar temporary Structures. The submittal of Working
 Drawings does not relieve the Contractor of any responsibility.
 Backfill excavated areas not occupied by piers, abutments, or other permanent
 Structures to the adjoining finished surface elevation. Do not use rock in backfill that is within
 2 ft of the Structure. Place backfill Material in approximately level layers for the length and
 width of the backfilled area. When necessary to prevent wedge action, bench the slopes
 bounding the area being backfilled in accordance with Section 203.3.5.1 Roadbed
 Embankments. Dispose of unstable excavated material outside of the Roadway Prism as
 directed by the Project Manager. Before placing backfill Material against new masonry or
 concrete Structures, wait until the concrete has developed its specified design strength as

 Subgrade Preparation
 
 Treat the Subgrade in accordance with the State Materials Bureau’s mix design.
 Identify and correct soft areas, then shape the Subgrade to the grades shown in the
 Plans before adding Portland cement or hydrated lime, quicklime, or lime-slurry. Ensure that
 the scarified depth of the treated Subgrade (shown in the Plans) is free of Deleterious Material
 and stones retained on a 3.0 inch sieve.
 Do not perform Work during wet or inclement weather. Mix and place the Portland
 cement- or lime-treated Subgrade, only if when the air temperature is at least 40 °F and rising
 in the shade. Do not mix or place cement- or lime-treated Subgrade on frozen Subgrade.
 When the air temperature is forecast to fall below 32 °F within a 48-hour period, cease Work
 or ensure the Subgrade temperature will not fall below 40 °F.
 Proof-roll the material with Equipment, approved by the Project Manager, to expose and
 correct the soft areas.
 Where unstable Subgrade is encountered in cuts or existing grades, due to no fault or
 neglect of the Contractor, sub-excavation and borrow will be paid for and measured as per
 Section 203, “Excavation, Borrow, and Embankment.” Engineered designs will be measured
 and paid for on an item by item basis or as specified in the Contract. Conduct operations in
 such a way that the Project Manager can take the necessary cross-sectional measurements
 before the backfill is placed.
 306.3.2
 
 Portland Cement Treated Subgrade
 
 Prior to the addition of Portland cement, pulverize the Subgrade to the specified depth so
 that at least 80% (by weight) passes through a No. 4 sieve.
 Apply Portland cement at the specified application rate and to the depth shown on the
 Plans. When processing the Portland cement-treated Subgrade, ensure that cement dust is
 not a hazard to the public or workers. Perform mixing, placing, compacting, and finishing on
 the same Day as the cement placement.
 306.3.2.1
 
 Mixing
 
 Mix the portland cement, soil, and water with a self-propelled rotary-type mixing machine
 (approved by the Project Manager) to provide a uniform mixture. Overlap at least six (6)
 inches between passes.
 The Department will consider streaks and pockets of portland cement as evidence of
 unacceptable mixing.
 Ensure the Material moisture content ranges between optimum to five percent (5%) over
 optimum within the entire treated depth.
 306.3.2.2
 
 Finishing Operations
 
 Section 306:
 
 Portland Cement or Lime Treated Subgrade
 
 Page 124
 
 Compact to 95% maximum density in accordance with AASHTO T 180 (Modified
 Proctor), Method D (TTCP Modified), immediately after mixing is complete. Finish to ± 0.1 ft
 along centerline and ± 0.05 ft at right angles to the centerline. Correct deviations from these
 tolerances. Final roll the surface to finish the completed Work and prevent hairline cracking.
 Finish within four (4) h of adding the Portland cement.
 Allow the cement-treated Subgrade to cure for at least seven (7) Days. Maintain a moist,
 not saturated, condition during the entire curing period, to prevent drying. If permitted by local
 jurisdiction, the Contractor may use an alternate curing procedure by applying a CSS-1 or
 SS-1 emulsified asphalt to the surface so that the surface is fully covered and sealed, as
 approved by the Project Manager.
 306.3.3
 
 Lime Treated Subgrade
 
 Use a distributor that will apply a uniform application and automatically adjust the spread
 rate for variable travel speeds. Apply hydrated lime or quicklime dry, within ±0.5% of the
 specified percentage, by weight shown on the approved mix design, onto the prepared
 scarified Subgrade. Do not use a tailgate spreader. When used, apply quicklime at the
 equivalent percentage to hydrated lime (1.0 ton quicklime is equivalent to 1.3 tons hydrated
 lime).
 Apply lime-slurry, at the specified percentage of dry solids content onto the prepared
 scarified Subgrade, with a distributor having a pump and a spray bar. Continuously circulate
 the slurry in transit and during application. Apply the lime-slurry within 24 h of its production.
 After 24 h, the slurry is considered expired.
 Dispose of the expired slurry in an
 environmentally-acceptable manner, and do not use it on the Project. Replace lime-slurry that
 is left exposed on the ground to the open air for more than ten (10) hours and shows
 excessive moisture loss.
 306.3.3.1
 
 Initial Mixing
 
 Process the hydrated lime, quicklime, or lime-slurry so as not to present a hazard to the
 public or workers.
 Mix immediately after applying the lime treatment using a self-propelled rotary-type
 mixing machine. Provide a loose uniform mixture, with clods and lumps no larger than two (2)
 inch, that, when compacted, will meet the required depth and width shown in the Plans.
 Overlap at least six (6) inches between passes.
 The Department will consider visible streaks and pockets as evidence of unacceptable
 mixing.
 Immediately following mixing, ensure the entire treated Subgrade depth’s moisture
 content is three percent (3%) to five percent (5%) above optimum in accordance with
 AASHTO T 180 (Modified Proctor), Method D (TTCP Modified). Lightly compact the surface to
 minimize water loss or gain and lime carbonation.
 306.3.3.2
 
 Curing
 
 Allow the treated lightly compacted Subgrade to cure for at least 24 h. Apply a seal
 during the cure period using either:
 1.
 
 A water curing seal that maintains moisture content at not less than three percent
 (3%), or more than five percent (5%) above optimum as determined by AASHTO T
 180 (Modified Proctor), Method D (TTCP Modified); or
 
 2.
 
 An SS or CSS emulsified asphalt seal using a rate between 0.10 to 0.20 gal per
 square yard as determined by the Project Manager.
 
 Treated Subgrade temperature must remain above 40 °F during the entire curing period.

 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 
 401.3.1
 
 Profile Measurements
 
 Collect raw profile data utilizing profiler settings used in certification by TTCP
 “Certification of Intertila Profilers.” Export all raw profile data to create files conforming to the
 University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute’s Engineering Research Division
 (ERD) format using an upper wavelength cutoff filter of 300 ft for HMA/WMA. For PCCP data
 collection use a Butterworth Band-Pass filter short cutoff wavelength of seven (7.0) ft and a
 long cutoff wavelength of 300 ft, and the current calibration documentation to the
 accompanying Department representative, within one (1) hour after the data has been
 collected, on either a CD or Universal Serial Bus (USB) memory storage device. Provide
 additional data files or text files upon request. If the Contractor does not submit the profile
 measurements files within this time period, the Department may alter the Pay Adjustments
 resulting from Table 401.5.1.1:1, “MRI Based Profile Pay Adjustment Schedule for Category I
 HMA/WMA Projects”, Table 401.5.1.1:2 “MRI Based Pay Adjustment Schedule for Category II
 HMA/WMA Projects”, Table 401.5.1.2:1, “MRI Based Profile Pay Adjustment Schedule for
 Category I PCCP Projects”, or Table 401.5.1.2:2, “MRI Based Profile Pay Adjustment

 and manufacturer’s procedures with the machine and provide the calibration documentation
 and verification documentation to the Project Manager. The Project Manager may require
 additional calibrations or verifications.
 Remove the profile measurement device from the Project if it does not meet
 manufacturer’s calibration requirements. The Project Manager will report the TTCP profile
 measurement device certification number to the TTCP Administrator in order to provide
 notification that the Contractor cannot use the machine on other Projects until the Contractor
 obtains re-certification. Once the manufacturer re-certifies the profile measurement device,
 provide a copy of the certificate to the Department’s TTCP Administrator. The TTCP
 Administrator will provide a temporary TTCP certification valid until the next scheduled
 certification.
 401.3.1.3
 
 Technician Certification
 
 The Department’s TTCP will certify individuals performing profile measurement. The
 Department will base certification on demonstrated ability and a written test. The TTCP will
 establish the term and expiration date of certification and requirements for renewal. The
 Department State Materials Engineer, through the TTCP, will investigate any concerns
 submitted in writing as to the competence of a certified individual and implement corrective
 action if necessary in accordance with the TTCP Board of Directors established procedures.
 401.3.1.4
 
 Profile Measurement Operations
 
 The Department will consider profile testing as part of the paving operation. Include the
 proposed frequency and schedule for profile testing with the paving plan submittal at the prepaving conference. Allow the Department’s Representative to witness the collection of raw
 data by riding in the vehicle while collecting the data.
 Obtain the Project Manager’s written approval and sweep the Roadway surface before
 beginning profile operations.
 Final surface is the surface immediately behind the paving operation prior to any surface
 modification.
 Measure the longitudinal smoothness of the final surface of HMA, WMA, OGFC, and
 PCCP using a Department certified profile measurement device. Operate the profile
 measurement device in accordance with AASHTO R 57 “Operating Inertial Profiling Systems”
 and manufacturer’s recommendations. Using dual-sensors, with single point lasers or bar
 lasers one (1.0) inch or less, measure the profile traces for each wheel path. Locate outside
 trace three (3) feet from and parallel to the approximate location of the pavement edge line.
 Ensure the centerline distance between sensors is 70.0 inches ± one (1.0) inch. At transverse
 joints, commence profile traces at the joint location. Operate the device on the driving surface
 of the Roadway at the manufacturer's recommended speed without interfering with traffic or its
 own operation.
 On HMA/WMA Projects, perform profile measurements and corrective actions on the final
 surface of HMA/WMA. On PCCP Projects, perform profile measurements and corrective
 actions on the finished surface after tining or grooving.
 Maintain the profile data files. Take additional profiles to retest paved surfaces that have
 received corrective Work. The Project Manager may require additional profiles to check
 previously submitted data or to identify the limits of surface irregularities. Include the following
 information for each data file:

 401.3.1.5
 
 ProVal Profile Data Analysis by the Department
 
 The Department will use the FHWA’s current version of “ProVal” software to determine
 the MRI for each 0.1 mile section of each lane, reported to the nearest 0.1 inch per mile using
 the average of the two wheel paths’ IRI’s, using Ride Quality Analysis. Using the ProVal
 software, the Department will not use any further filter settings. Do not use the 250 mm filter
 in “ProVal”. Data obtained through analysis by the Department will be used for evaluations of
 all “Must Grind Work”, “Corrective Work”, and “Pay Adjustments.”
 401.3.2
 
 Straightedge Measurements (Category III)
 
 Test the final surface of HMA, WMA, or PCCP with an approved ten (10) foot
 straightedge at both right angles and parallel to the centerline, advancing the straightedge in
 five (5) foot increments. In lieu of a physical ten (10) foot straightedge measuremet and at the
 direction of the Project Manager a profile measurement device that complies with Section
 401.3.1.1 “Profile Measurement Device” can be used for the ten (10) foot straightedge
 measurement. Correct surface deviations greater than 1/8 inch within ten (10) ft, as directed
 by the Project Manager.
 401.3.3
 
 Evaluation for Must Grind Work and Corrective Work
 
 Evaluate the pavement in 0.1-mile sections for determining needed Must Grind Work,
 Corrective Work and Pay Adjustments.
 401.3.4 Diamond Grinding
 Diamond grinding equipment uses diamond tipped saw blades, composed of industrial
 diamonds and metallurgical powder, that are gang mounted on a cutting head ranging in width
 from 36 inches to 48 inches. The diamond grinding equipment shall use water to cool the
 cutting head. The slurry or residue resulting from the grinding operation shall be contiuously
 removed from the pavement with a wet vacuum process. The slury or residue shall not be
 allowed to flow across lanes occupied by traffic or to flow into gutters or other drainage
 facilities. Diamond grinding equipment shall be self-propelled, self-contained and without
 external attachments acting as cutting / grinding devices.
 Diamond grinding operations shall not dislodge aggregate or binder creating rock pockets
 or deviations on pavement surface.
 401.3.5
 
 Must Grind Work
 
 Identify potential must grind locations using “Ride Quality Analysis” under the “Analysis
 Type” with the “Continuous” feature of the latest version of the FHWA’s “ProVAL” software.
 Use a MRI threshold (inch/mi) of 105.00 and a segment length of 25.00 feet. Identify must
 grind locations for each lane using the “MRI” Ride Quality Index feature of ProVAL. Any
 locations with a MRI of 105.00 to 125.00 will be evaluated by the Project Manager and the
 Contractor, to determine if diamond grinding is required, final determination will be made by
 the Project Manager. All locations with an MRI above 125.00 must be included in the
 corrective action plan.
 Develop and submit an appropriate written corrective action plan, including methods and
 procedures utilized to diamond grind and achieve the specified MRI values proposed by the
 Contractor, to the Project Manager for review and written approval. Do not begin must grind
 Work until the Project Manager approves the methods and procedures in writing. Failure to
 submit and obtain approval of the corrective action plan will result in the contractor correcting
 all locations identified by ProVAL regardless of the smoothness value for the 0.1 mile section.
 The Project Manager’s approval does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to comply
 with the Specifications.
 Section 401:
 
 Pavement Smoothness Measurement
 
 Page 130
 
 Correct all must grind locations on the Project identified by the approved written
 corrective action plan then measure and evaluate Roadway profiles for smoothness Pay
 Adjustment. Use diamond grinding to bring the reported average measured smoothness value
 to an acceptable level.
 Do not reduce planned pavement thickness by more than 0.3 inches without written
 approval of the Project Manager.
 Grind must grind areas across the lane width to produce a smooth transition to the
 surrounding pavement. If the must grind area is not the full width of the lane, only half of the
 lane containing the roughness shall be ground and smoothly feathered into the surrounding
 pavement.
 For HMA/WMA, if the Contract does not require an OGFC, or OGFC will not be placed
 before Project suspension, apply a fog seal to the ground areas as approved by the Project
 Manager. Fog seal and all operations necessary to apply it is included in the Bid Item Unit
 Price for HMA/WMA, the Department will make no separate payment.
 401.3.6
 
 Corrective Work
 
 Develop and submit an appropriate written Corrective Work Plan, including methods and
 procedures, utilized to diamond grind and achieve the specified MRI values proposed by the
 Contractor, to the Project Manager for review and written approval if the measured
 smoothness value falls within the “Corrective Work Required” (CWR) value of the applicable
 pay adjustment table and category as indicated in the Contract. If approved, complete elected
 corrective Work, including necessary traffic control, at no additional cost to the Department.
 After completion of the approved corrective Work, re-profile the corrected area to verify
 compliance with specification requirements.
 Limit corrective Work to diamond grinding, overlaying, or removing and replacing rejected
 0.1-mile sections. Do not begin corrective Work until the Project Manager approves the
 methods and procedures in writing. The Project Manager’s approval does not relieve the
 Contractor of the responsibility to comply with the Specifications.
 Perform corrective Work in accordance with the following:
 Surface Diamond Grinding.  Use diamond grinding to bring the measured
 smoothness value to an acceptable level in accordance with the applicable table(s)
 and category(ies) as indicated in the Contract.
 
 1.
 
 Do not reduce planned pavement thickness by more than 0.3 inches without written
 approval of the Project Manager.
 Grind corrective Work areas to produce a smooth transition to the surrounding
 pavement. If the corrective Work areas are not the full width of the lane, only half of
 the lane containing the corrective Work area shall be ground and smoothly
 feathered into the surrounding pavement.
 For HMA/WMA, if the Contract does not require an OGFC, or OGFC will not be
 placed before Project suspension, apply a fog seal to the ground areas as approved
 by the Project Manager. Fog seal and all operations necessary to apply will be
 Incidental to the Bid Item Unit Price for HMA/WMA; the Department will make no
 separate payment.
 For PCCP, perform additional diamond grinding as necessary in the following
 situations:
 1.1.
 
 The transverse direction, so the lateral diamond grinding limits are at a
 constant offset from and parallel to the nearest lane line or pavement edge;
 and
 
 1.2.
 
 The longitudinal direction, so the diamond grinding begins and ends at lines
 perpendicular to the pavement centerline. Maintain diamond grinding locations
 as neat rectangular areas of uniform appearance. If tining is eliminated by
 
 Section 401:
 
 Pavement Smoothness Measurement
 
 Page 131
 
 diamond grinding, machine groove the hardened concrete in the same pattern
 as adjacent tining at no additional cost to the Department.
 Overlaying.  If the Contractor uses an additional lift of HMA/WMA to correct rough
 pavement, the HMA/WMA shall meet the requirements of the appropriate
 specification. Extend the overlay lift the full width of the underlying pavement
 surface to a finished compacted thickness sufficient to correct the existing pavement
 roughness.
 
 2.
 
 The Department will not allow a second overlay if the first overlay does not meet the
 longitudinal smoothness requirement.
 Correct a corrective overlay that does not meet the smoothness requirement by
 diamond grinding or removing and replacing as specified in Section 401.3.6
 “Corrective Work”.
 3.
 
 Removing and Replacing. Remove pavement the full width of the lane and the full
 thickness of the course. The removal area shall begin and end with a transverse
 saw cut perpendicular to centerline. Use the type of approved HMA, WMA or PCCP
 as originally specified in the Project Contract as replacement Material.
 
 Re-profile the 0.1 mile section of travel lane after performing corrective Work and use the
 re-profile’s reported measured smoothness data to represent the particular section for Pay
 Adjustment purposes.
 401.3.7
 
 OGFC Placement and Profile Measurement
 
 Ensure HMA/WMA profile measurements and corrective Work has been completed
 before placing OGFC. Pay Adjustment will be based on the MRI of the HMA/WMA unless the
 measured MRI of the OGFC is greater than the measured MRI of the HMA/WMA on the same
 0.1 mile section, then the Department will base the Pay Adjustment for the HMA/WMA section
 on the OGFC’s measured MRI.
 401.4
 
 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 
 The Department will determine smoothness Pay Adjustments on the calculated square
 yards of the surface area of the travel lane bound by the plan typical section travel lanes and
 0.1-mile lane length.
 401.5
 
 BASIS OF PAYMENT
 
 Surface smoothness testing and corrective Work to bring the final surface within
 specification smoothness in accordance with the applicable table(s) and category(ies) as
 indicated in the Contract is Incidental to the Bid Item Unit Price for HMA, WMA or PCCP; the
 Department will make no separate payment. All traffic control required to determine and
 correct pavement smoothness is Incidental to the HMA, WMA or PCCP item.
 All adjustments of manhole and utility valves for the facilitation of pavement smoothness
 shall be performed after paving of the finish grade. This Work shall be paid in accordance with
 Section 662 “Manholes” and 663 “Utility Items.”

 Sampling
 
 The Contractor shall perform all Quality Assurance sampling using AASHTO T 40,
 Standard Method of Test for Sampling Bituminous Materials under the direct supervision of
 TTCP certified sampling personnel, and witnessed by the Project Manager or his designee.
 The samples will be taken either from the discharge side of the storage tank or from the
 delivery trucks. The samples will be taken after a sufficient amount, a minimum of one (1)
 gallon, of PGAB is run out to clear any residual PGAB or other asphalt material and/or solvent
 that may have built up in the sampling valve. All approved sample containers shall be
 identified using Department Form MT-85.
 The minimum sampling frequency for PGAB shall be one (1) sample during the test strip
 operation and every 5000 tons of HMA or WMA thereafter. One (1) sample of PGAB shall be
 taken representing OGFC operations. A minimum of two (2) samples shall be taken per
 Project representing asphalt binder from HMA or WMA, and a minimum of one (1) sample
 representing asphalt binder for OGFC. A sample shall consist of (3) separate 1-quart subsamples. All samples shall be maintained in a secure, dry location at the Project office or at a
 pre-agreed upon location that is satisfactory to the Contractor and Project Manager.
 402.2.5.2
 
 Testing
 
 One (1) sub-sample shall be tested by NMDOT Chemistry Unit when the test strip is
 performed. Another randomly selected sub-sample shall be tested by the NMDOT Chemistry
 Unit during the course of the Project. If the results of any of the sub-samples designate failing
 material, the second sub-sample shall be submitted to and tested by the NMDOT Chemistry
 Unit. If the second sub-sample does not meet Specifications in accordance with AASHTO M
 320, Table 402.2.5.2.1 “Pay Adjustment Factor Based on PGAB Test Results” will be
 implemented by the Project Manager. The Pay Adjustment Factor will represent the total
 asphalt binder used for 5000 Tons of HMA or the tonnage of HMA used for the test strip. If
 there are multiple failures for each binder test on the same sample, the Project Manager will
 base the adjustment on the lowest pay factor of all the tests. The Price Adjustment will be
 executed with a Change Order (Field Sheet).

 Mix Design
 
 A Department approved Private Testing Lab will develop the Rubberized OGFC mix
 design in accordance with ASTM D 7064, “Standard Practice for Open Graded Friction Course
 (OGFC) Mix Design”, as modified by the New Mexico Department of Transportation State
 Asphalt Engineer. The mix design shall be reviewed and signed by a professional Engineer
 licensed by the New Mexico Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land
 Surveyors. The JMF gradation will be within the master range for the specified type of OGFC.
 The mix design will establish a single percentage of aggregate passing each required sieve
 size and a single percentage of asphalt Material to be added to the aggregate. The mix
 design will specify either hydrated lime or anhydrite based material as an anti-strip, at a
 minimum of one (1) percent, by weight. The mix design shall indicate the amount used and it
 shall be included in the aggregate gradation for establishing the mix design. The Mix Design
 shall identify the minimum and maximum mixing and placement temperatures of the mix.
 Mix aggregate with asphalt at three (3) asphalt contents in 0.5% increments. Three (3)
 specimens should be compacted to optimum and three (3) specimens each at both 0.5%
 above and 0.5% below the estimated optimum asphalt content. Estimate the optimum asphalt
 content as follows:
 For <3 % aggregate absorption, use estimated optimum AC = 6.5%;
 For >3 % aggregate absorption use estimated optimum AC = 7.0%.
 Determine the maximum specific gravity (Gmm) of the loose mix in accordance with
 AASHTO T 209 using a companion sample mixed with the middle increment of AC content.
 Perform the drain down test in accordance with AASHTO T305. If the sample has a drain
 down in excess of 0.3 %, make the necessary adjustments in the AC content or aggregate
 gradation and repeat the test.
 Evaluate the stripping potential in accordance with the Static Immersion Test described
 below. If less than 95% of the binder is retained, repeat the test using an appropriate
 Section 404:
 
 Rubberized Open Graded Friction Course
 
 Page 153
 
 adjustment to the type of anti-strip agent used and/or the amount of anti-stripping agent.
 Retention greater than 95% of the binder is required in order for the ROGFC mix to be
 approved for use on this Project.

 404.2.6 Static Immersion Test Procedure
 404.2.6.1
 
 Scope
 
 This method describes coating and static immersion procedures for determining the
 retention of a bituminous film on an aggregate surface in the presence of water.
 404.2.6.2
 
 Significance and Use
 
 The purpose of the test is to evaluate the effectiveness of an anti-strip additive in the
 asphalt coating of aggregate used for Open Graded Friction Course (OGFC).
 This test evaluates the effectiveness of the anti-strip additive with specific asphalt and a
 specific aggregate. Different asphalts and aggregates will give variable response to this test
 with the same additive.
 This procedure is to be used as a go/no-go test at the ninety-five percent (95%) level. No
 attempt shall be made to evaluate the retention of a film below 95%.
 If both hydrated lime and anhydrite based material provide retention of 95% or greater,
 the Contractor may choose which anti-strip material will be used.
 This test is a static immersion test and should not be confused with the immersioncompression test.
 404.2.6.3
 
 Apparatus
 
 1.
 
 Containers for mixing such as stainless steel bowls or seamless tin cans.
 
 2.
 
 Hot Plate or Oven for bringing the asphalt and aggregate to suitable mixing
 temperatures.
 
 3.
 
 Oven or Water Bath capable of maintaining a constant temperature of 140 oF for 24
 hours.
 
 4.
 
 Pyrex Beakers or other suitable glass containers, 600 ml capacity.
 
 5.
 
 Spatula for mixing.
 
 404.2.6.4
 
 Sample Preparation
 
 Select a representative sample of the aggregate passing the 3/8” sieve and retained on
 the No. 4 sieve. Dry and weigh the aggregate, then add sufficient water (2 to 4%) to obtain
 proper coating of the aggregate with the proposed anti-strip material. When aggregate is
 thoroughly moistened, weigh in one percent (1%) anti-strip, by weight of dry aggregate and
 thoroughly mix to coat all aggregate surfaces with the anti-strip material. Air or oven dry as
 time permits.

 Department Quality Assurance Testing for HMA or WMA Compaction
 
 The Department will test in accordance with Section 423.3.6, or 424.3.6, “Sampling and
 Testing.” The target density is a mean density of at least 93% of the theoretical maximum
 density. The Project Manager will grant an exception to the target if the Contractor can
 demonstrate that the target density is not reasonably obtainable because of the conditions of
 the existing Pavement Structure or Subgrade Materials.
 If the Department grants this exception, construct a Roadway test strip and develop a
 HMA compaction process to obtain the highest possible target density based on an approved
 roller’s density gain per pass, in accordance with Section 423.3.4.4, “Compaction Equipment.”
 Do not begin paving operations (except for the Roadway test strip) until the Project Manager
 approves the process. The in-place density shall not exceed 98% of the theoretical maximum
 density or be more than three percent (3%) below the target density. If a lot’s mean density
 does not meet this density requirement, the Project Manager may do the following:
 1.
 
 Require the Contractor to remove and replace the defective lot of HMA or WMA at
 no additional cost to the Department; or
 
 2.
 
 Accept the HMA or WMA Material and pay the Contractor 50% of the Bid Item Unit
 Price.
 
 If the Project Manager determines that the mean measured densities are consistently
 higher, not exceeding 93% of the theoretical maximum density, or lower than the current lot’s
 target density, the Project Manager may establish a new Acceptance lot on the Project.
 412.3.4.3
 
 Department Quality Assurance Testing for HMA/WMA Smoothness

 in-situ cold recycled layer within one (1) week of completing the in-situ cold recycled layer.
 Remove Deleterious Materials within the width of the pavement to be recycled before
 beginning recycling operations or other relevant Work. Dispose of the debris as directed by
 the Project Manager. Control water to the pulverized Material to facilitate uniform mixing with
 the emulsified binder agent. The Contractor may add water before or with the emulsified
 binder agent. Provide a means to accurately meter and register the rate of flow of water into
 the pulverized Material. If the typical section to be recycled is on a super elevated or sloped
 section, begin the initial pass of the milling Equipment at the lowest portion of the section and
 proceed in succession towards the higher side of the slope. Remove fillets of fine, pulverized
 Material that form adjacent to a vertical face before spreading the recycled mix. The
 Contractor shall not remove fillets adjacent to existing pavement if the Contractor is to remove
 the fillets by overlapping during subsequent milling operation. If segregation occurs either in
 the windrow or behind the paver, the Project Manager may require the Contractor to make
 changes to the Equipment or operations.
 If a section of recycled pavement contains a paving fabric, as identified in the Plans,
 waste oversized material as directed by the Project Manager. This may require changes in
 Equipment and procedures to obtain an acceptable end product.

 Finishing Operations
 
 Do not permit vehicles on the completed recycled asphalt base for at least two (2) hours
 after the recycled Material is spread and compacted. Allow traffic on the recycled Material
 when approved by the Project Manager. Allow the recycled Material to cure so that the free
 moisture in the recycled Material reduces to a maximum of one percent (1%) above the
 inherent moisture content of the existing pavement by the total weight of the mix. Determine
 the inherent moisture content of the existing pavement from samples taken at a maximum of
 1-mile intervals, or as approved by the Project Manager.
 The State will determine the free moisture content of the recycled pavement from
 samples taken from the same areas and same intervals sampled for the inherent moisture
 content. Take the samples and determine the free moisture immediately before sealing or
 overlaying operations. If the free moisture content of the recycled Material is one percent (1%)
 or less above the inherent moisture of the Material, seal the surface with emulsion at an
 approximate rate of 0.05 gal per square yard to 0.10 gal per square yard, in order to control
 surface raveling. Repair unacceptable recycled Material, as directed by the Project Manager,
 before placing a subsequent surfacing course. Ensure that the surface of the recycled
 pavement is safe for traffic. Remove loose aggregate that develops on the surface of the
 recycled pavement with a power-broom.
 415.3.2
 
 Option B: Cold Mill with HMA or WMA Inlay
 
 Ensure that Option B Work has a minimum depth of three (3) inches, unless otherwise
 specified in the Plans, and a width as specified in the Plans, or as directed by the Project
 Manager. If required, mill the pavement surface to the grades, depths, and widths specified in
 the Plans. Remove dirt and other objectionable material from the surface of the pavement
 with blades, brooms, or other methods approved by the Project Manager in accordance with
 Section 423, “Hot-Mix Asphalt - Superpave (QLA & Non-QLA),” Section 407, “Tack Coat,” and

 density requirement of at least 93% of the theoretical maximum density if the Contractor can
 demonstrate that a minimum of 93% cannot be reasonably obtained because of the conditions
 of the existing Pavement Structure or Subgrade Materials. If the Project Manager grants this
 exemption, construct a Roadway test strip and develop a HMA or WMA compaction process to
 get the highest possible density based on an approved roller’s density gain per pass, in
 accordance with Section 423.3.4.4, “Compaction Equipment.” The Project Manager will
 approve the process (except for the Roadway test strip) before paving operations begin. In no
 case shall the percentage of theoretical maximum density exceed 98% nor fall more than
 three (3) percentage points lower than the target density. If a lot does not meet either of these
 density requirements, the Project Manager will do the following:
 1.
 
 Accept and pay for the lot of HMA Material at 50% of the Bid Item Unit Price; or
 
 2.
 
 Reject the in-place material and require the Contractor to remove and replace.
 
 If the Project Manager determines that the mean measured densities are consistently
 higher, but not to exceed 93%, or lower than the current lot’s target density, the Project
 Manager may establish a new Acceptance lot on the Project.

 Determine the need for and percentage (a maximum of 20.0%) of blending sand using
 mix design tests on samples taken from stockpiles during crushing operations and submitted
 to an approved testing Laboratory.
 423.2.6
 
 Mineral Filler
 
 Provide mineral filler in accordance with AASHTO M 17 and approved by the State
 Materials Bureau. The Department will not allow fly ash as mineral filler for HMA.
 423.2.7
 
 Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement
 
 Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, the Contractor may use RAP removed under
 the Contract consisting of salvaged, milled, pulverized, broken, or crushed asphalt pavement.
 The Contractor may use RAP produced from outside sources provided evidence of ownership
 is supplied and the following is met: After the Contractor obtains sufficient quantities of RAP
 aggregate samples in accordance with AASHTO T 308, the Department will accept RAP for
 which each fraction of coarse aggregate has a percent wear of 40.0 or less, at 500 revolutions,
 when tested in accordance with AASHTO T 96. Provide plus No. 4 RAP Material with a
 minimum of 75% Fractured Faces content (one (1) face).
 The Contractor may use a maximum of 15% RAP (by weight) in the production of HMA
 mixtures without changing the asphalt binder. For quantities greater than 15% to 25% RAP,
 either lower the asphalt binder’s high and low temperature grades by one (1) grade (e.g. lower
 a PG 76-22 to a PG 70-28) or extract, recover, and combine the RAP’s asphalt binder with a
 virgin asphalt binder per AASHTO M 323, Appendix A, ensuring the resultant binder meets the
 entire AASHTO M 320 required Project PG asphalt binder properties indicated on the
 approved mix design. For quantities greater than 25% to 35% RAP, extract, recover, and
 combine the RAP’s asphalt binder with a virgin asphalt binder per AASHTO M 323,
 Appendix A. Ensure the resultant binder meets the entire AASHTO M 320 required Project
 PG asphalt binder properties indicated on the approved mix design. The Department will not
 allow the Contractor to use more than 35% RAP in the production of HMA mixtures. For
 Projects of entirely new construction, limit the RAP to 15% in the top mat or extract, recover
 and combine the RAP’s asphalt binder with a virgin asphalt binder per AASHTO M323,
 Appendix A. Ensure the resultant binder meets the entire AASHTO M320 required Project PG
 asphalt binder properties indicated on the approved mix design.

 Process RAP so that 100% passes a 1-1/2-inch sieve. For HMA mixtures containing
 greater than 15% RAP, maintain adequate stockpile management (i.e. sufficient quantities and
 shaping of the stockpiles) and fractionation (divide the RAP into a minimum of two (2)
 stockpiles), so they are uniform throughout the stockpiles. Address in the Quality Control Plan
 how RAP will be controlled, such as which screen will be used to split into two (2) stockpiles,
 or by what method the RAP will be controlled to keep the resultant mix within acceptable
 limits. Account for the weight of the binder in the RAP when batching aggregates. Provide
 RAP that is free of Deleterious Materials. If the Contractor decides to use RAP in the
 production of HMA mixtures, the Department will make no additional payment for the asphalt
 binder in the RAP or asphalt binder due to asphalt binder grade adjustment. As RAP is
 produced and prepared for inclusion in the HMA, perform Process Control testing in
 accordance with Section 901, “Quality Control/Quality Assurance,” Table 901.7:3, Minimum
 Process Control Guidelines for Aggregates and Base Course.
 If problems with HMA consistency or compliance with Project Specifications occur,
 additional efforts taken to achieve acceptable levels of consistency and compliance with
 Contract Specifications, at the Contractor’s discretion (at no additional cost to the
 Department), include, but are not limited to:
 
 
 Reduce the top size of the RAP from 1-1/2” to 1”;
 
 
 
 Fractionate the aggregates on a second screen, such as the 3/8” or 1/4” Screen so
 that the RAP is maintained in three (3) stockpiles, one being Rap larger than 1-1/2”
 to 2”, Coarse RAP and the third being Fine RAP;
 
 
 
 Ensure that the RAP used in the HMA mix design is representative of the RAP
 available on the Project;
 
 
 
 Cover the RAP pile(s) so that ambient moisture is not absorbed; and
 
 
 
 Process and maintain the stockpiles so that the RAP material is equally and
 uniformly distributed throughout the entire stockpile(s) and is withdrawn such that
 uniform, non-segregated RAP is delivered to the hoppers.
 
 423.2.8
 
 Mix Design
 
 Provide a mix design developed by a Department-approved testing Laboratory, reviewed
 and signed by a professional Engineer licensed by the New Mexico Board of Registration for
 Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors. A list of approved private testing laboratories is
 available from the State Materials Bureau. Develop the mix design at no additional cost to the
 Department. The Contractor may develop the mix design at any time prior to the Project PrePaving Conference. Submit at least five (5) independent aggregate gradation test results from
 each stockpile to the Project Manager.
 Provide the Department with a copy of the request to the testing Laboratory to develop a

 copies of all stockpile test results. Summarize the mix design results from the Departmentapproved testing Laboratory in a format approved by the State Materials Bureau and submit
 them to the Project Manager and State Asphalt Engineer for review and concurrence by the
 State Asphalt Engineer. Include the results and design worksheets of testing calculations in
 accordance with AASHTO R 35, for the mix components as well as the mixture itself and in
 accordance with State Materials Bureau procedures. Department concurrence of a mix design
 will not relieve the Contractor of full responsibility for producing an acceptable mixture. The
 mix design may require adjustment in accordance with Section 423.2.8.1, “Mix Design
 Adjustment.”
 Create the JMF gradation in accordance with Table 423.2.2.1:1, “HMA Aggregate
 Gradation Control Points.” The Department will require at least one percent (1.0%) hydrated
 lime or anhydrite based material in all mix designs. Include the hydrated lime or anhydrite
 based material in the gradation for developing the mix design. The mix design shall establish
 a single percentage of the aggregate passing each sieve size and a single percentage of
 asphalt binder the Contractor is to add to the aggregate. Develop the mix design using the

 changed. Submit a new mix design if changing the source of Materials. Obtain concurrence
 from the State Materials Bureau before using the new Materials.
 423.2.9
 
 Job Mix Formula
 
 The Job Mix Formula (JMF) must be in accordance with all aggregate gradation
 requirements and result in a mix that meets all specified mix design requirements. The
 Department will refer to the result of the Laboratory mix design developed in accordance with
 Section 423.2.8, “Mix Design,” as JMF1.
 Prepare the aggregate gradation of the calibration samples for analysis per
 AASHTO T 308. Individually calibrate each oven used to perform AASHTO T 308 in
 accordance with the State Materials Bureau’s, Ignition Oven Calibration Factors procedure
 including a set for the Referee Lab. Provide a minimum of five (5) sets of calibration samples.
 Do not combine the elements of the calibration samples prepared for the Referee Lab, and
 provide them, with the Project Number, Contractor and Project Manager clearly identified to
 the Project Manager who will forward them to the State Asphalt Engineer. All Quality Control,
 Quality Assurance and Independent Assurance ovens must be calibrated by this procedure
 prior to start of production of a JMF. New calibration samples may be required for new JMF’s,
 as determined by the District Lab Supervisor or the State Asphalt Engineer. The Project
 Section 423:
 
 Hot Mix Asphalt – Superpave (QLA & Non-QLA)
 
 Page 192
 
 Manager will suspend paving operations until calibration of the ovens has been completed.
 No additional time or compensation will be granted for completion of this requirement.
 423.2.9.1
 
 Job Mix Formula Adjustment
 
 The Contractor may request a modification to the JMF based on field testing of Material
 produced through the plant. It is expected that minor adjustments will be necessary and the
 Project Manager (with the concurrence of the Department’s District Laboratory Supervisor)
 may approve a new JMF if the adjustment results in a new TV that is within the tolerance from
 the design TV. (Example: If design TV for No. 4 sieve is 30%, then a new TV may be
 approved in the field from 23% - 37%). Test results and calculations that verify a proposed
 JMF adjustment complies with the Specifications will be required prior to being reviewed by
 the Project Manager and concurred by the State Materials Bureau. Review and concurrence
 of a JMF adjustment can only be made after:
 
 
 The Quality Control Plan (including checks on specific gravity) has been submitted
 and concurred by the Project Manager and the District Lab Supervisor for use on
 the Project;
 
 
 
 Confirmation by the Project Manager that the Quality Control Plan is being
 followed;
 
 
 
 Concurrence of the proposed changes from Project Manager and District Lab
 Supervisor,
 
 
 
 Submittal by the Testing Laboratory responsible for the original mix design to the
 Project Manager with a copy to the State Asphalt Engineer.
 
 If the JMF is adjusted after the Shakedown Period, terminate the previous lot when the
 adjusted JMF has been reviewed and concurred with by the Project Manager, Assistant
 District Engineer for Construction and the State Materials Bureau. Terminated lot will be added
 to the previous lot for evaluation by QLA. Begin a new lot for the QLA with the adjusted JMF.
 During the Shakedown Period, make JMF adjustments in accordance with Section 423.3.5.7,
 Test Strip and Shakedown Period.

 423.3.1
 
 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 General
 
 Provide sufficient storage space for each size of aggregate and RAP. Keep the different
 sizes separate until delivery to the cold feed system feeding the drier. While storing and
 moving the coarse and fine aggregate, ensure that segregation, degradation, or combination
 of Materials of different grades does not occur. Re-screen or waste segregated or degraded
 Material. Provide separate storage and bin feeder for mineral filler if the Contract requires
 mineral filler. Stockpile aggregates and RAP that contain gravitational water and allow them to
 drain before mixing. After introducing the required amounts of aggregate, RAP (if used), and
 asphalt binder into the mixer, mix them until the aggregate particles are completely and
 uniformly coated with asphalt binder. If the Project Manager determines that uncoated
 aggregate exists, take corrective action. Ensure that the moisture content of the HMA at
 discharge from the mixer does not exceed 0.5%.
 423.3.2
 
 Mix Temperature Requirements
 
 Do not allow the temperature of the HMA discharged from the mixer into the transport
 vehicle to be greater or less than the target mixing temperature specified in the mix design by
 more than ten percent (10%) F, not to exceed 350° F, unless written concurrence by the oil
 Supplier and design lab are provided to the Project Manager. HMA delivered to the Project
 with mix temperatures outside the acceptable range shall, at the sole discretion of the Project
 Manager, be removed and replaced at no cost to the Department.
 423.3.3
 
 Addition of Hydrated Lime or Anhydrite Based Material
 
 Section 423:
 
 Hot Mix Asphalt – Superpave (QLA & Non-QLA)
 
 Page 193
 
 Add the hydrated lime or anhydrite based material to the aggregate in an enclosed pug
 mill immediately after leaving the cold feed and just before introduction into the drier drum or
 aggregate drier. Minimize the loss of hydrated lime or anhydrite based material while adding
 to the aggregate. Use an enclosed conveyor belt to prevent blowing or loss of hydrated lime
 or anhydrite based material if necessary. During production, if necessary to counteract loss,
 increase the percentage of hydrated lime or anhydrite based material.
 Equip the out feed of the hydrated lime or anhydrite based material silo with a vane
 feeder and install a flow sensor on the discharge from the vane feeder. Ensure that the
 sensor activates audible and visual signals at the control panel upon interruption of hydrated
 lime or anhydrite based material flow.
 Equip the hydrated lime or anhydrite based material silo with an approved means of
 metering the addition of hydrated lime or anhydrite based material to the mix at typical
 discharge rates with an accuracy of ± 3.0 %, by weight. Approved means of metering
 hydrated lime or anhydrite based material include load cell weighing devices placed beneath
 each leg of the silo, or a weigh belt feeder between the silo discharge and the pug mill. Obtain
 Project Manager’s approval for other means of metering the addition of hydrated lime or
 anhydrite based material before use. Do not use external strain gauges affixed to the legs of
 the silo. If the Contractor uses load cell weighing devices for hydrated lime or anhydrite based
 material metering, use a foundation system to support the silo in accordance with the silo
 manufacturer’s recommendations. Control the hydrated lime or anhydrite based material
 content such that at a minimum the amount added is equal to the Target Value on the Job Mix
 Formula.
 When mixing the aggregate and hydrated lime or anhydrite based material, maintain the
 moisture content of the combined aggregate at the recommended saturated surface dry
 moisture content, plus an additional 1.5 % ± 0.5 %, by weight. The Project Manager may
 increase the moisture content of the coarse and fine aggregates to properly coat the
 aggregates with hydrated lime or anhydrite based material and to eliminate dust pollution.
 Provide a method to measure the amount of moisture added to the hydrated lime or anhydrite
 based material-aggregate mix. On a daily basis, record the average amount of added
 moisture to verify specification compliance. Supply the recorded moisture information to the
 Project Manager upon request.

 423.3.4.2
 
 Haul Equipment
 
 Haul asphalt mixtures with trucks that have tight, clean, smooth metal beds and a thin
 coat (a minimal amount) of a Department-approved release agent to prevent the mixture from
 adhering to the bed. Do not use release agents derived from petroleum derivatives, including
 but not limited to diesel fuel that contaminate or alter the characteristics of the mix.
 Be prepared to cover and insulate hauling beds. Equip each truck with a waterproof and
 windproof cover of suitable material and sufficient size to protect the mix from the weather.
 Securely fasten covers when necessary to maintain temperature. Ensure that covers do not
 allow water to enter the bed, paver or mix material transfer device during mix unlading. Use
 insulated truck beds when necessary to maintain temperature.
 423.3.4.3
 
 Pavers
 
 Use self-contained, self-propelled pavers, with activated screeds or strike-off assemblies,
 heated if necessary, and capable of spreading and finishing courses of HMA in accordance
 with the Plans.
 423.3.4.4
 
 Compaction Equipment
 
 Provide a sufficient number, weight, and type of rollers to obtain the required compaction
 and specified pavement density while the HMA is in a workable condition. All rollers must be

 Page 196
 
 When placing HMA on Base Course, Proof Roll the Base Course with a 27 ton roller or
 other approved Equipment and correct any soft areas, as directed by the Project Manager.
 Correct deficient areas at the Contractor’s expense. Place the HMA on the approved surface,
 then spread, and strike off to the specified grade and elevation. Spread and compact the
 HMA in layers in accordance with the Plans.
 For new construction and reconstruction, prepare the Subgrade or Base Course as
 follows:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 Clean of loose or Deleterious Materials;
 Free of frozen material;
 Meet the moisture and density requirements; and
 Place prime coat, as required in the Plans unless otherwise approved by the Project
 Manager, in accordance with Section 408, Prime Coat.
 
 Unless otherwise specified in the Plans, for construction on NMDOT Projects using State
 approved HMA designs utilizing greater than 25% RAP the use of a Materials Transfer Vehicle
 is required.
 Materials Transfer Vehicle (MTV): Use a MTV with storage and remixing capabilities on
 all mainline construction when placing HMA State approved designs. The MTV will
 independently remix and deliver mixture from the hauling Equipment to the paving Equipment.
 Furnish an MTV with the following capabilities:
 1.
 
 An unloading system to receive mixtures from the hauling Equipment.
 
 2.
 
 A minimum storage capacity of 13 tons with a remixing system in the MTV storage
 bin.
 
 3.
 
 A discharge conveyor to deliver the mixture to the paver hopper.
 
 4.
 
 The MTV system cannot exceed maximum legal loading on Structures.
 
 Pick-up machines, hopper inserts and material transfer devices are not considered
 MTVs.
 In the event the MTV malfunctions during paving operations, the Contractor can finish the
 Day without the MTV. Do not resume further mainline mix placement until the MTV is
 operational.
 Consistently overloading the HMA mix into the paving machine is not acceptable.
 Coordinate the speed of the paving machine with the production of the plant and keep enough
 haul Equipment available to achieve continuous operation.
 Use the control system on the paving machine to control the grade and the transverse
 slope by either of the following methods:
 1.
 
 One end directly and the other indirectly through controlling the transverse slope; or
 
 2.
 
 Each end independently, including screed attachments.
 
 Suspend operations if the control system does not achieve the typical section in accordance
 with the Plans. Place, spread, and finish the courses of HMA according to the following:
 1.
 
 Without segregation or tearing ;
 
 2.
 
 True to the line, grade, and crown in accordance with the Plans; and
 
 3.
 
 With self-propelled pavers, except as otherwise directed.
 
 On areas where irregularities or unavoidable obstacles make the use of mechanical
 spreading and finishing Equipment impracticable, dump, spread, and level the HMA by other
 methods to achieve the required compacted thickness.
 Section 423:
 
 Hot Mix Asphalt – Superpave (QLA & Non-QLA)

 423.3.5.1
 
 Weather Limitations
 
 Do not place HMA on wet or frozen surfaces or if weather conditions prevent proper
 handling, finishing, and compacting. Place HMA when the Chill Factor is at least 40 °F and
 rising. If the air temperature is 60 °F or warmer, do not consider the Chill Factor.
 423.3.5.2
 
 Compaction
 
 Compact the HMA thoroughly and uniformly immediately after placement. Operate
 rollers at speeds slow enough to minimize displacement of the HMA, including the lines and
 grades of the asphalt edges. Remove marks from pneumatic rollers and immediately correct
 any displacement. The Department will not allow the use of Equipment that crushes the
 aggregate excessively.
 Prevent the HMA from sticking to the roller wheels by keeping the wheels moistened with
 water; water mixed with very small quantities of detergent or other approved material. Do not
 use diesel fuel or other petroleum diluents. At locations inaccessible to the rollers, compact
 the HMA with hot hand tampers, smoothing irons, or mechanical tampers. The Contractor
 may use a trench roller or cleated compression strips under the roller to transmit compression
 to depressed areas.
 Remove areas that become loose, broken, mixed with dirt, segregated or defective,
 replace with fresh HMA, and compact to match the surrounding area, at no additional cost to
 the Department. Immediately correct areas that have excessive or deficient asphalt binder.

 423.3.5.4
 
 Joints
 
 Place the HMA as continuously as possible. Do not pass rollers over the unprotected
 end of a freshly laid mixture. When placing open-graded friction course over HMA, stagger
 longitudinal joints at least six (6) inches relative to the longitudinal joints of the underlying
 course.
 Unless otherwise specified, taper transverse and longitudinal joints as follows:
 1.
 
 At least a three (3) ft taper for transverse joints, with a taper slope no steeper than
 24:1.
 
 2.
 
 At least a one (1) ft taper or a notched taper, for longitudinal joints, with a taper
 slope no steeper than 6:1 or a notched taper with a one (1) inch vertical edge at the
 top of the taper connected to a slope no steeper than 6:1.
 
 3.
 
 Cut and square off transverse tapers before commencing new Work.
 
 4.
 
 Clean and tack coat longitudinal joints from previous operations.
 
 5.
 
 Avoid placing longitudinal joints in the wheel paths, unless approved by the Project
 Manager.
 
 Completely bond joints. Smooth the surface of each course at the joints. The
 Department will not allow deviations greater than 3/16 inch when tested with a ten (10) ft
 straightedge in any direction. When paving under traffic, schedule the daily surfacing
 operations so that tapered longitudinal joints are not exposed for longer than seven (7) Days.
 423.3.5.5
 
 Surface Tolerances
 
 Smooth the surface of each completed course and prevent deviations larger than 1/8 inch
 using a ten (10) ft straightedge in any direction. Immediately correct deviations exceeding this
 tolerance. Provide a final HMA surfacing course that conforms to Section 401, “Pavement
 Smoothness Measurement”.

 the Contractor in writing. Control production to keep yield within the upper and lower limits.
 Correct deficiencies at no cost to the State. Correct deficient depths during placement.
 Address Plan Surfacing Depths in the Quality Control Plan.
 423.3.5.7
 
 Test Strip & Shakedown Period
 
 Construct a maximum 1,000 ton test strip for each HMA mix design with a minimum of
 three (3) Contractor and three (3) agency samples to evaluate the JMF, process control, and
 placement operations. Construct test strip on Shoulder, low volume segments of the
 pavement, or area approved by the Project Manager.
 Correct and modify non-complying
 placement operations and produce necessary process control adjustments. Develop a revised
 JMF if necessary based on the results of the test strip. Production and placement operations
 prior to approval of the revised JMF and placement operations are at the Contractor’s risk.
 For purposes of payment, the test strip will be evaluated in conformance with Section 416,
 Minor Paving. If accepted, the test strip will have a pay factor of 1.0. If rejected, said material
 shall be handled in accordance with Section 423.3.6.1.3 Adherence to Specifications and
 Rejection of Non-specification Material. Remove unaccepted test strip material placed within
 the Roadway Prism at no cost to the Department. If the Contractor disagrees with removing
 and replacing unacceptable material placed in test strips outside the Roadway Prism, the
 Assistant District Engineer for Construction, based on engineering judgment, will decide if the
 material can remain in place with a maximum pay factor of 50%, or shall be removed and
 replaced at no cost to the Department. If the test strip is rejected, construct a subsequent test
 strip. Do not proceed to full production until an accepted test strip is produced. After the test
 strip is placed, continue to evaluate the mix properties and the JMF during the placement of
 the first two (2) sublots in the first lot. Changes may be made to either the JMF or the mix
 proportions and/or properties with the concurrence of the Assistant District Engineer for
 Construction. For changes made prior to the completion of the first two (2) sublots, the
 adjustments will be applied to the entire lot for purposes of payment.
 The Project Manager may waive test strip requirements for the Project, if requested by
 the Contractor based on prior experience with the JMF.
 For QLA Projects, the Shakedown Period is defined as the first two (2) sublots produced
 in the first lot.
 For Non-QLA Projects, the Shakedown Period is defined as the test strip. As the test
 strip is placed, evaluate the mix properties and the JMF. Changes may be made to either the
 JMF or the mix proportions and/or properties with the concurrence of the Project Manager,
 State Materials Bureau and the Assistant District Engineer for Construction.

 Non-QLA
 
 The Department will evaluate (QA) test results from Projects with Bid quantities less than
 15,000 tons for specification compliance in accordance with the following procedures: If the
 mean of the test results for each property is within the Acceptance Tolerances as listed in
 Table 423.3.6.2.1:1, “Acceptance Testing Tolerances,” the Material will be accepted at full
 Contract price except that Roadway density will be adjusted in price in accordance with
 Section 901.5, Quality Level Analysis. If the mean of the test results for any of the listed
 properties is outside of the tolerances as listed in Table 423.3.6.2.1:1, “Acceptance Testing
 Tolerances,” then the Department will determine Acceptance of the Material in accordance
 with 901.1.3, “Acceptance Sampling and Testing,” and Section 901.5, “Quality Level Analysis.”
 A composite pay factor of more than 1.00 is not allowed for Projects with Bid quantities less
 than 15,000 tons. Remove and replace rejected Material with specification Material at no
 additional cost to the Department.
 423.3.6.2.1.1.1
 
 Acceptance of Pavement Density
 
 The target density for Acceptance of HMA will be 94.5% of the theoretical maximum
 density as determined from AASHTO T 209. For determination of maximum specific gravity,
 obtain and test a minimum of two (2) samples and ensure the Department obtains and tests a
 minimum of one (1) sample for each Day that the HMA is placed.
 Each individual density
 test value obtained must be from 92.0% to 97.0% of the theoretical maximum density.
 To be prepared for dispute resolution, the Contractor is to provide one (1) additional core
 for each core tested by the Department for Acceptance of density. The additional core is to be
 from the same lot as the initial core and shall be generated from the random sample plan. If
 the Contractor believes the Department’s cut pavement samples have been damaged they
 may invoke Section 423.3.7 Dispute Resolution. The Referee Lab results will replace the
 initial core in determining pay factor. The Assistant District Engineer for Construction will
 make the final decision on accepting or rejecting material, based on the Referee Laboratory’s
 result(s) by:
 1.
 
 Accepting the section or sublot if the density falls between 92.0% - 97.0%;
 
 2.
 
 Determining that a portion, based on visual determination, or all of the Material in
 that section or sublot shall be removed or replaced at no additional cost to the
 Department;
 
 3.
 
 Determining that a portion, based on visual determination, of the Material in that
 section or sublot will be paid for at a 50% pay factor.
 
 For purposes of Acceptance and pay factor determination, determine the density from cut
 pavement sections (cores) with 6-inch diameters extending through the full thickness of the
 HMA. Determine the pay factor in accordance with Section 901.5, Quality Level Analysis.
 Use a minimum of ten (10) cores to determine the pay factor, unless otherwise directed by the
 Assistant District Engineer for Construction. Determine the theoretical maximum density using
 an average of the maximum specific gravity values obtained by the Department and the
 Contractor the Day the core’s Material was placed. If a composite pay factor of more than
 1.00 is calculated, the composite pay factor will be a 1.00 for the purposes of payment.
 Section 423:
 
 Hot Mix Asphalt – Superpave (QLA & Non-QLA)
 
 Page 203
 
 For Projects consisting of single lift overlays or mill and inlay with a single lift of two and a
 half inches or less, the Project Manager may grant an exception to the mean density target
 requirement of at least 94.5% of the theoretical maximum density if the Contractor can
 demonstrate that a minimum of 92.0% cannot be reasonably obtained because of the existing
 conditions of the Pavement Structure or Subgrade Materials. The Contractor demonstrates
 this by providing density results obtained during paving operations witnessed by a State
 Inspector at the location in question. If the Project Manager grants this exemption, construct a
 Roadway test strip and develop an HMA compaction process to get the highest possible
 density based on an approved roller’s density gain per pass, in accordance with Section
 423.3.4.4, Compaction Equipment. The Project Manager will approve the process, establish a
 new target value for density and establish a new Acceptance lot only for the portion of the
 Project addressed herein (except for the Roadway test strip) before paving begins or
 continues.
 Density shall not fall below 91%. If a lot does not meet either of the revised
 density requirements, the Project Manager will, with the concurrence of the Assistant District
 Engineer for Construction, do the following:
 1.
 
 Accept and pay for the lot of HMA at 50% of the Bid Item Unit Price; or
 
 2.
 
 Reject the in-place material and require the Contractor to remove and replace.
 
 423.3.6.3
 
 QLA
 
 On Projects with Bid quantities of 15,000 tons or more, the Department will determine
 Acceptance of the Materials in accordance with Section 901.5, “Quality Level Analysis,” using
 the Acceptance limits in Table 423.3.6.2.1:1, “Acceptance Testing Tolerances”. Acceptance
 lots shall be between 15,000 tons and 30,000 tons, as determined at the pre-paving
 conference. Table 423.3.6.2.1:2 indicates properties that will be tracked for purposes of
 Quality Assurance. For all QLA Projects, if a composite pay factor of more than 1.00 is
 calculated, the composite pay factor will be a 1.00 for the purposes of payment.
 423.3.6.3.1
 
 Acceptance of Pavement Density
 
 The target density for Acceptance of HMA will be 94.50% of the theoretical maximum
 density as determined from AASHTO T 209. For determination of maximum specific gravity,
 obtain and test a minimum of two (2) samples and ensure the Department obtains and tests a
 minimum of one (1) sample for each Day that the HMA is placed, in accordance with the
 random sampling plan. Each individual density test value obtained must be from 92.0% to
 97.0% of the theoretical maximum density.
 For purposes of Acceptance and pay factor determination, determine the density from cut
 pavement sections (cores) with 6-inch diameters extending through the full thickness of the
 HMA. Determine the pay factor in accordance with Section 901.5, Quality Level Analysis.
 Use a minimum of ten (10) cores to determine the pay factor, unless otherwise directed by the
 Assistant District Engineer for Construction. To be prepared for dispute resolution, the
 Contractor is to provide one (1) additional core for each core tested by the Department for
 Acceptance of density. The additional core is to be from the same lot as the initial core and
 shall be generated from the random sample plan. If the Contractor or Department believes the
 Department’s cut pavement samples have been damaged they may invoke Section 423.3.7
 Dispute Resolution. The Referee Lab results will replace the initial core in determining pay
 factor. Determine the theoretical maximum density using an average of the maximum specific
 gravity values obtained by the Department and the Contractor the Day the core’s Material was
 placed. If a composite pay factor of more than 1.00 is calculated, the composite pay factor will
 be a 1.00 for the purposes of payment.
 For Projects consisting of single lift overlays or mill and inlay with a single lift of two and a
 half inches or less, the Project Manager may grant an exception to the mean density target
 requirement of at least 94.5% of the theoretical maximum density if the Contractor can
 demonstrate that a minimum of 92.0% cannot be reasonably obtained because of the existing
 conditions of the Pavement Structure or Subgrade Materials. The Contractor demonstrates
 this by providing non-destructive density results obtained during paving operations witnessed
 by a State Inspector at the location in question. If the Project Manager grants this exemption,
 construct a Roadway test strip and develop an HMA compaction process to get the highest
 Section 423:
 
 Hot Mix Asphalt – Superpave (QLA & Non-QLA)
 
 Page 204
 
 possible density based on an approved roller’s density gain per pass, in accordance with
 Section 423.3.4.4, Compaction Equipment. The Project Manager will approve the process,
 establish a new target value for density and establish a new Acceptance lot only for the portion
 of the Project addressed herein (except for the Roadway test strip) before paving begins or
 continues. Lot density shall not fall below 91%. If a lot does not meet either of the revised
 density requirements, the Project Manager will, with the concurrence of the Assistant District
 Engineer for Construction do the following:
 1.
 
 Accept and pay for the lot of HMA at 50% of the Bid Item Unit Price; or
 
 2.
 
 Reject the in-place material and require the Contractor to remove and replace at no
 cost to the Department.
 
 423.3.6.4 Independent Assurance Testing
 The Department will perform Independent Assurance sampling and testing in accordance
 with Section 901.3, “Independent Assurance Testing.”
 423.3.7 Dispute Resolution
 For any test incorporated into the pay factor, if a dispute exists the Project Manager and
 Contractor will investigate to determine why and make corrections if possible. If the
 discrepancy cannot be resolved, then either party may invoke a referee lab. The State Asphalt
 Engineer will maintain a list of labs that are willing and capable of performing referee testing.
 All referee labs shall be AASHTO Materials Reference Laboratory (AMRL) certified for the
 test(s) to be performed. Neither the Department’s Project staff, nor the Contractor will know
 who is performing the referee testing. The State Asphalt Engineer will select a Laboratory,
 without disclosing the name of the lab to Department Project Personnel or Contractor
 personnel, from the following, not in priority order:
 1.
 
 A District Laboratory not from the District in which the Project resides; or
 
 2.
 
 A private Laboratory currently listed on the State Material’s Bureau’s list of approved
 private labs not involved in the subject Project in any manner, such as mix design
 submittal, preliminary testing for design, etc. Only laboratories that are in the
 routine business of providing testing and designs will be considered. Contractor
 owned laboratories will not be allowed.
 
 When a referee lab is used, the referee lab’s test results will be used in determining the
 pay factor. The referee lab must be invoked in writing within ten (10) Calendar Days of
 receiving the test results from the other party. If not invoked within ten (10) Calendar Days,
 the test results are deemed accepted. The results will be used to determine pay factors. The
 Department’s prior test results or the Contractor’s prior test results for the test in question will
 be discarded. If the composite pay factor decreases from applying the referee lab’s results,
 the Contractor shall pay for the testing performed by the referee lab. If the composite pay
 factor increases from applying the referee lab’s results, the Department will pay for the testing
 performed by the referee lab. If the composite pay factor remains unchanged, the cost shall
 be split with each party responsible for 50% of the total cost.
 For all testing incorporated into the pay factor, each party shall generate an additional
 sample from the Department’s Acceptance Samples and the Contractor’s Quality Control
 Samples used in pay factor analysis. Failure to provide the referee samples prior to testing
 the initial sample will result in the Project Manager suspending the Project at no cost to the
 Department. Additional time will not be added to the Contract for Project suspension caused
 by failure to comply with Dispute Resolution Process. Work shall not resume until the
 Contractor provides the delayed sample(s) and satisfies the Project Manager, in writing, that
 future samples will be provided in compliance with this requirement. The extra sample(s) is
 (are) to be retained by the Department. The Department will retain the samples at the Project
 location inside a locked cargo container, provided by the Contractor at no cost to the State.
 The State will provide the lock for the cargo container. Once the pay factor is determined
 dispose of the unused samples at no cost to the Department. In no case will the unused
 samples be disposed of prior to the ten (10) Calendar Day period in which the Dispute
 Resolution process may be invoked.
 Section 423:
 
 Hot Mix Asphalt – Superpave (QLA & Non-QLA)
 
 Page 205
 
 For Pavement Density, the Contractor shall provide an additional core only for each core
 provided to the Department for Acceptance. The additional core will be stored and retained in
 the provided container. Should the Contractor invoke the Dispute Resolution Process for
 Density, the second core will be provided to the Referee Lab. The density pay factor for the
 material in question will be based solely on the Referee Lab result, not including Department
 or Contractor results.
 Failure to comply with the requirements contained herein will result in the pay factor
 being calculated in accordance with the applicable Sections of 423, Superpave (QLA and NonQLA), and 901, Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QC/QA). No test results will be replaced
 by referee results.
 423.4
 
 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 
 If the Department measures HMA by the square yard, the Department will use the
 average width of the HMA in place and the length from station to station along the centerline of
 the Roadway when calculating quantities.

 Projects with Bid Quantities of 15,000 Tons or Greater
 
 The Department will pay for accepted quantities of HMA or HMA Complete at the Bid
 Item Unit Price, adjusted in accordance with Section 901.5, “Quality Level Analysis.” The
 HMA will be evaluated on a lot-by-lot basis at a price determined by multiplying the Bid Item
 Unit Price by the weighting factor. The Department will use Table 423.5.1.1:1, “Weighting
 Factors,” to calculate each lot’s composite pay factor. The pay factor for the entire Project will

 MATERIALS
 
 424.2.1
 
 General
 
 WMA may be produced by one (1) or a combination of several technologies which may
 include WMA plant foaming processes and Equipment, mineral additives or chemicals that
 allow the reduction of the production temperatures.
 WMA is a mixture of asphalt binder, Warm Mix Additive (or technologies), aggregate,
 blending sand, mineral filler, and hydrated lime or anhydrite based material. Unless otherwise
 prohibited in the Contract, the Department will allow Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP) in
 WMA mixes as long as the resulting mixture conforms to all specification requirements.
 Size, uniformly grade, and combine aggregate fractions in accordance with the Contract.
 Test Materials in accordance with applicable AASHTO methods, as modified by the
 Department (if applicable) or other test procedures as directed by the Department. The State
 Materials Bureau will decide all questions pertaining to the interpretation of test procedures.
 424.2.2
 
 Aggregate
 
 Ensure the aggregate gradation of the WMA mixture meets the requirements of
 Table 424.2.2.1:1, “WMA Aggregate Gradation Control Points.” The Project Manager may
 require, at no additional cost to the Department, wet preparation, per AASHTO T 146, Method
 A, if the Project Manager determines there are Deleterious Materials present in the aggregate
 stockpiles before aggregate gradation testing. The Contract will specify the type of WMA the
 Contractor is to use. The Department will allow the Contractor to combine Materials from two
 (2) or more sources to produce aggregate only when each individual aggregate source meets
 all applicable quality requirements.

 Aggregate Quality
 
 For each Material source, ensure the WMA coarse aggregate has an AI of 25 or less
 when calculated in accordance with Section 901, "QUALITY CONTROL/QUALITY
 ASSURANCE (QC/QA)."
 Regulate the crushing of aggregate stockpiles so that the minimum Fractured Faces
 content of the plus No. 4 Material complies with the requirements of Table 424.2.2.1.2:1,
 “Fractured Faces, Sand Equivalent, and Fine Aggregate Angularity,” and evaluation by
 NMDOT Method FF-1, “Fractured Face Determination for Coarse Aggregate.” Ensure the plus
 3/8 inch material contains a maximum of 20% flat, elongated particles with a dimensional ratio
 of 3:1 or greater as determined by ASTM D 4791 (TTCP Modified). Ensure the combined
 material, excluding RAP; passing the No. 40 sieve is non-plastic. Ensure that before the
 addition of hydrated lime or anhydrite based material, the minimum sand equivalent value and
 the minimum fine aggregate angularity value of the combined aggregate, excluding RAP,
 complies with the requirements of Table 424.2.2.1.2:1, “Fractured Faces, Sand Equivalent,
 and Fine Aggregate Angularity.” Determine the sand equivalent value in accordance with
 AASHTO T 176, Alternate Method No. 1 and the fine aggregate angularity value in
 accordance with AASHTO T 304, Method A.

 or partitions;
 
 5.
 
 Prevent contamination (store stockpiles away from vehicular and Equipment traffic);
 
 6.
 
 Keep the storage yard neat and orderly and keep the stockpiles accessible for
 sampling; and
 
 7.
 
 Keep the aggregate sizes separated until delivered to the cold feed system that
 feeds the drier.
 
 424.2.2.4
 
 Combining
 
 When combining crushed Materials from different stockpiles, including RAP (if in the
 mixture) ensure the product is in accordance with the mix design gradation requirements. Use
 controlled feeders from each stockpile to combine crushed Material.
 424.2.3
 
 Asphalt Binder
 
 The Contract will specify the type and grade of asphalt binder. Provide asphalt binders in
 accordance with Section 402, “Asphalt Materials, Hydrated Lime, and Anhydrite Based
 Material.” Do not change the asphalt source after approval of the mix design without written
 approval of the State Materials Bureau.
 424.2.3.1
 
 Warm Mix Additive or Technology
 
 Only Warm Mix Additives or Technologies approved by the Product Evaluation Program
 and currently listed on the Approved Products List can be used on Department Projects. To be
 placed on the Approved Products List, the WMA additive Supplier shall verify that the binder
 with the additive meets the PG grade of the specified binder. The potential additive Supplier
 shall demonstrate this to the Department by evaluating the Asphalt Binder and WMA additive
 for compliance with the rheological properties for low and high temperatures for the specified
 PG grade in accordance with AASHTO M320, Table 1 and Section 402.2.5, Performance
 Graded Asphalt Binder. The type and dosage of Warm Mix Additives shall comply with the
 requirements of the Warm Mix Additive Supplier. The type and/or dosage of the WMA
 additives shall be provided to the Project Manager two (2) weeks prior to the commencement
 of paving operations. Warm Mix Additive dosage rates shall not deviate from those designated
 by the Warm Mix Additive Supplier. If a terminal blend Warm Mix Additive is used, the dosage
 rate shall be shown on the Materials Certificate of Compliance.
 After the Warm Mix Additive is introduced, the PG grade of the binder shall comply with
 the PG grade as specified in the Contract.
 For foamed asphalt systems, water used as directed by the foamed asphalt system
 manufacturer shall be considered to be the Warm Mix Additive. Only foam systems on the
 Department’s Approved Product List shall be used.
 Section 424:

 424.2.4
 
 Hydrated Lime or Anhydrite Based Material
 
 Provide hydrated lime or anhydrite based material in accordance with Section 402,
 “Asphalt Materials, Hydrated Lime, and Anhydrite Based Material.”
 424.2.5 Blending Sand
 Blending sand consists of the following:
 1.
 
 Natural fines from the scalping process;
 
 2.
 
 Concrete sand;
 
 3.
 
 Sandy Material; or
 
 4.
 
 A combination of these, graded to the mix design requirements.
 
 Determine the need for and percentage (a maximum of 20.0%) of blending sand using
 mix design tests on samples taken from stockpiles during crushing operations and submitted
 to an approved testing Laboratory.
 424.2.6
 
 Mineral Filler
 
 Provide mineral filler in accordance with AASHTO M 17 and approved by the State
 Materials Bureau. The Department will not allow fly ash as mineral filler for WMA.
 424.2.7
 
 Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement
 
 Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, the Contractor may use RAP removed under
 the Contract consisting of salvaged, milled, pulverized, broken, or crushed asphalt pavement.
 The Contractor may use RAP produced from outside sources provided evidence of ownership
 is supplied and the following is met: After the Contractor obtains sufficient quantities of RAP
 aggregate samples in accordance with AASHTO T 308, the Department will accept RAP for
 which each fraction of coarse aggregate has a percent wear of 40.0 or less, at 500 revolutions,
 when tested in accordance with AASHTO T 96. Provide plus No. 4 RAP Material with a
 minimum of 75% Fractured Faces content (one (1) face).
 The Contractor may use a maximum of 15% RAP (by weight) in the production of WMA
 mixtures without changing the asphalt binder. For quantities greater than 15% to 25% RAP,
 either lower the asphalt binder’s high and low temperature grades by one (1) grade (e.g. lower
 a PG 76-22 to a PG 70-28), or extract, recover, and combine the RAP’s asphalt binder with a
 virgin asphalt binder per AASHTO M 323, Appendix A, ensuring the resultant binder meets the
 entire AASHTO M 320 required Project PG asphalt binder properties indicated on the
 approved mix design.. For quantities greater than 25% to 35% RAP, extract, recover, and
 combine the RAP’s asphalt binder with a virgin asphalt binder per AASHTO M 323,
 Appendix A. Ensure the resultant binder meets the entire AASHTO M 320 required Project
 PG asphalt binder properties indicated on the approved mix design. The Department will not
 allow the Contractor to use more than 35% RAP in the production of WMA mixtures. For
 Projects of entirely new construction, limit the RAP to 15% in the top mat or extract, recover
 and combine the RAP’s asphalt binder with a virgin asphalt binder per AASHTO M323,
 Appendix A. Ensure the resultant binder meets the entire AASHTO M320 required Project PG
 asphalt binder properties indicated on the approved mix design.
 Process RAP so that 100% passes a 1-1/2-inch sieve. For WMA mixtures containing
 greater than 15% RAP, maintain adequate stockpile management (i.e. sufficient quantities and
 shaping of the stockpiles) and fractionation (divide the RAP into a minimum of two (2)
 stockpiles), so they are uniform throughout the stockpiles. Address in the Quality Control Plan
 how RAP will be controlled, such as which screen will be used to split into two (2) stockpiles,
 or by what method the RAP will be controlled to keep the resultant mix within acceptable
 limits. Account for the weight of the binder in the RAP when batching aggregates. Provide
 RAP that is free of Deleterious Materials. If the Contractor decides to use RAP in the
 production of WMA mixtures, the Department will make no additional payment for the asphalt
 binder in the RAP or asphalt binder due to asphalt binder grade adjustment. As RAP is
 Section 424:
 
 Warm Mix Asphalt
 
 Page 211
 
 produced and prepared for inclusion in the WMA, perform Process Control testing in
 accordance with Section 901, “Quality Control/Quality Assurance,” Table 901.7:3, Minimum
 Process Control Guidelines for Aggregates and Base Course.
 If problems with WMA consistency or compliance with Project Specifications occur,
 additional efforts taken to achieve acceptable levels of consistency and compliance with
 Contract Specifications, at the Contractor’s discretion (at no additional cost to the
 Department), include, but are not limited to:
 
 
 Reduce the top size of the RAP from 1-1/2” to 1”;
 
 
 
 Fractionate the aggregates on a second screen, such as the 3/8” or 1/4” Screen so
 that the RAP is maintained in two (2) stockpiles, one being Coarse RAP and the
 second being Fine RAP;
 
 
 
 Ensure that the RAP used in the WMA mix design is representative of the RAP
 available on the Project;
 
 
 
 Cover the RAP pile(s) so that ambient moisture is not absorbed; and
 
 
 
 Process and maintain the stockpiles so that the RAP material is equally and
 uniformly distributed throughout the entire stockpile(s) and is withdrawn such that
 uniform, non-segregated RAP is delivered to the hoppers.
 
 424.2.8
 
 Mix Design
 
 Provide a mix design developed by a Department-approved testing Laboratory, reviewed
 and signed by a Professional Engineer licensed by the New Mexico Board of Registration for
 Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors. A list of approved private testing laboratories is
 available from the State Materials Bureau. Develop the mix design at no additional cost to the
 Department. The Contractor may develop the mix design at any time prior to the Project PrePaving Conference. Submit at least five (5) independent aggregate gradation test results from
 each stockpile to the Project Manager.
 Provide the Department with a copy of the request to the testing Laboratory to develop a
 mix design, along with supporting documents in accordance with AASHTO R 35, to the Project
 Manager and the State Asphalt Engineer. Include the proposed aggregate combination and
 copies of all stockpile test results. Summarize the mix design results from the Departmentapproved testing Laboratory in a format approved by the State Materials Bureau and submit
 them to the Project Manager and State Asphalt Engineer for review and concurrence by the
 State Asphalt Engineer. Include the results and design worksheets of testing calculations in
 accordance with AASHTO R 35, for the mix components as well as the mixture itself and in
 accordance with State Materials Bureau procedures. Department concurrence of a mix design
 will not relieve the Contractor of full responsibility for producing an acceptable mixture. The
 mix design may require adjustment in accordance with Section 424.2.8.1, “Mix Design
 Adjustment.”
 Create the JMF gradation in accordance with Table 424.2.2.1:1, “WMA Aggregate
 Gradation Control Points.” The Department will require at least 1.0% hydrated lime or
 anhydrite based material in all mix designs. Include the hydrated lime or anhydrite based
 material in the gradation for developing the mix design. The mix design shall establish a
 single percentage of the aggregate passing each sieve size and a single percentage of
 asphalt binder the Contractor is to add to the aggregate. Develop the mix design using the
 Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP) gyratory compactor in accordance with
 AASHTO R 35. AASHTO TP 77 may be used in lieu of AASHTO T 84/T 85. The mix design
 shall be in accordance with Table 424.2.8:1, “WMA Superpave Design Requirements for
 Aggregates with Less Than 3.0% Absorption,” or Table 424.2.8:2, “WMA Superpave Design
 Requirements for Aggregates with 3.0% or Greater Absorption.”

 When Department Reviewed Commercial Mix Designs are used on the Project, submit a
 copy of proposed commercial mix design to the State Materials Material Bureau with Project
 information to verify the proposed commercial mix design is appropriate to use and meets all
 the required Specifications for the Project. If the proposed commercial mix design meets all
 the requirements for the specific Project, the State Materials Bureau may re-issue the
 proposed commercial mix design for that specific Project.
 The State Materials Bureau may allow the Contractor to use a mix design for one (1) year
 from the date of review by the State Materials Bureau. The Contractor may use or re-submit
 the design before the expiration of the one (1) year time frame. Do not use a Mix Design
 beyond one (1) year after the State Materials Bureau’s review date. Submit acceptable
 evidence to the State Materials Bureau verifying that the component Materials have not
 changed. Submit a new mix design if changing the source of Materials. Obtain concurrence
 from the State Materials Bureau before using the new Materials. Provide documentation
 confirming that the WMA additive blended with the asphalt binder results in asphalt cement
 that meets the specified PG Grade Asphalt Binder.
 The WMA Additive Supplier and the Asphalt Binder Supplier will recommend mixing,
 compaction and maximum allowable temperatures to be used for the development of the mix
 design. The WMA mix design signed and submitted by a Department Approved Testing
 Laboratory will be reviewed by the State Asphalt Engineer in accordance with Department
 procedures, and if found to comply with all requirements, sent to the Project Manager for final
 Acceptance for use by the Department.
 424.2.9
 
 Job Mix Formula
 
 The Job Mix Formula (JMF) must be in accordance with all aggregate gradation
 requirements and result in a mix that meets all specified mix design requirements. The
 Department will refer to the result of the Laboratory mix design developed in accordance with
 Section 424.2.8, “Mix Design,” as JMF1.
 Section 424:

 Prepare the aggregate gradation of the calibration samples for analysis per
 AASHTO T 308. Individually calibrate each oven used to perform AASHTO T 308 in
 accordance with the State Materials Bureau’s, Ignition Oven Calibration Factors procedure
 including a set for the Referee Lab. Provide a minimum of five (5) sets of calibration samples.
 Do not combine the elements of the calibration samples prepared for the Referee Lab, and
 provide them, with the Project Number, Contractor and Project Manager clearly identified, to
 the Project Manager who will forward them to the State Asphalt Engineer. All Quality Control,
 Quality Assurance and Independent Assurance ovens must be calibrated by this procedure
 prior to start of production of a JMF. New calibration samples may be required for new JMF’s,
 as determined by the District Lab Supervisor or the State Asphalt Engineer. The Project
 Manager will suspend paving operations until calibration of the ovens has been completed.
 No additional time or compensation will be granted for completion of this requirement.
 424.2.9.1
 
 Job Mix Formula Adjustment
 
 The Contractor may request a modification to the JMF based on field testing of Material
 produced through the plant. It is expected that minor adjustments will be necessary and the
 Project Manager (with the concurrence of the Department’s District Laboratory Supervisor)
 may approve a new JMF if the adjustment results in a new TV that is within the tolerance from
 the design TV. (Example: If design TV for No. 4 sieve is 30%, then a new TV may be
 approved in the field from 23% - 37%). Test results and calculations that verify a proposed
 JMF adjustment complies with the Specifications will be required prior to being reviewed by
 the Project Manager and concurred by the State Materials Bureau. Review and concurrence
 of a JMF adjustment can only be made after:
 
 
 The Quality Control Plan (including checks on specific gravity) has been submitted
 and concurred by the Project Manager and the District Lab Supervisor for use on
 the Project;
 
 
 
 Confirmation by the Project Manager that the Quality Control Plan is being
 followed;
 
 
 
 Concurrence of the proposed changes from Project Manager and District Lab
 Supervisor,
 
 
 
 Submittal by the Testing Laboratory responsible for the original mix design to the
 Project Manager with a copy to the State Asphalt Engineer.
 
 If the JMF is adjusted after the Shakedown Period, terminate the previous lot when the
 adjusted JMF has been reviewed and concurred with by the Project Manager and the State
 Materials Bureau. Terminated lot will be added to the previous lot for evaluation by QLA.
 Begin a new lot for the QLA with the adjusted JMF. During the Shakedown Period, make JMF
 adjustments in accordance with Section 424.3.5.7, Test Strip and Shakedown Period.

 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 General
 
 Provide sufficient storage space for each size of aggregate and RAP. Keep the different
 sizes separate until delivery to the cold feed system feeding the drier. While storing and
 moving the coarse and fine aggregate, ensure that segregation, degradation, or combination
 of Materials of different grades does not occur. Re-screen or waste segregated or degraded
 Material. Provide separate storage and bin feeder for mineral filler if the Contract requires
 mineral filler. Stockpile aggregates and RAP that contain gravitational water and allow them to
 drain before mixing. After introducing the required amounts of aggregate, RAP (if used), and
 asphalt binder into the mixer, mix them until the aggregate particles are completely and
 uniformly coated with asphalt binder. If the Project Manager determines that uncoated
 aggregate exists, take corrective action. Ensure that the moisture content of the WMA at
 discharge from the mixer does not exceed 0.5%.
 424.3.2
 
 Mix Temperature Requirements
 
 Section 424:
 
 Warm Mix Asphalt
 
 Page 215
 
 Do not allow the temperature of the WMA discharged from the mixer into the transport
 vehicle to be greater than 275 degrees F or less than 215 degrees F unless written
 recommendations by the asphalt cement Supplier, the Warm Mix Additive Supplier and the
 Mix Design Laboratory are provided to the Project Manager. WMA delivered to the Project
 with mix temperatures outside the acceptable range shall, at the sole discretion of the Project
 Manager, be removed and replaced at no cost to the Department.

 Addition of Hydrated Lime or Anhydrite Based Material
 
 Add the hydrated lime or anhydrite based material to the aggregate in an enclosed pug
 mill immediately after leaving the cold feed and just before introduction into the drier drum or
 aggregate drier. Minimize the loss of hydrated lime or anhydrite based material while adding
 to the aggregate. Use an enclosed conveyor belt to prevent blowing or loss of hydrated lime
 or anhydrite based material if necessary. During production, if necessary to counteract loss,
 increase the percentage of hydrated lime or anhydrite based material.
 Equip the out feed of the hydrated lime or anhydrite based material silo with a vane
 feeder and install a flow sensor on the discharge from the vane feeder. Ensure that the
 sensor activates audible and visual signals at the control panel upon interruption of hydrated
 lime or anhydrite based material flow.
 Equip the hydrated lime or anhydrite based material silo with an approved means of
 metering the addition of hydrated lime or anhydrite based material to the mix at typical
 discharge rates with an accuracy of ± 3.0 %, by weight. Approved means of metering
 hydrated lime or anhydrite based material include load cell weighing devices placed beneath
 each leg of the silo, or a weigh belt feeder between the silo discharge and the pug mill. Obtain
 Project Manager’s approval for other means of metering the addition of hydrated lime or
 anhydrite based material before use. Do not use external strain gauges affixed to the legs of
 the silo. If the Contractor uses load cell weighing devices for hydrated lime or anhydrite based
 material metering, use a foundation system to support the silo in accordance with the silo
 manufacturer’s recommendations. Control the hydrated lime or anhydrite based material
 content such that at a minimum the amount added is equal to the Target Value on the Job Mix
 Formula.
 When mixing the aggregate and hydrated lime or anhydrite based material, maintain the
 moisture content of the combined aggregate at the recommended saturated surface dry
 moisture content, plus an additional 1.5 % ± 0.5 %, by weight. The Project Manager may
 increase the moisture content of the coarse and fine aggregates to properly coat the
 aggregates with hydrated lime or anhydrite based material and to eliminate dust pollution.
 Provide a method to measure the amount of moisture added to the hydrated lime or anhydrite
 based material-aggregate mix. On a daily basis, record the average amount of added
 moisture to verify specification compliance. Supply the recorded moisture information to the
 Project Manager upon request.

 424.3.4.2
 
 Haul Equipment
 
 Haul asphalt mixtures with trucks that have tight, clean, smooth metal beds and a thin
 coat (a minimal amount) of a Department-approved release agent to prevent the mixture from
 adhering to the bed. Do not use release agents derived from petroleum derivatives, including
 but not limited to diesel fuel, that contaminate or alter the characteristics of the mix.
 Be prepared to cover and insulate hauling beds. Equip each truck with a waterproof and
 windproof cover of suitable material and sufficient size to protect the mix from the weather.
 Securely fasten covers when necessary to maintain temperature. Ensure that covers do not
 allow water to enter the bed, paver or mix material transfer device during mix unlading. Use
 insulated truck beds when necessary to maintain temperature.
 424.3.4.3
 
 Pavers
 
 Section 424:
 
 Warm Mix Asphalt
 
 Page 218
 
 Use self-contained, self-propelled pavers, with activated screeds or strike-off assemblies,
 heated if necessary, and capable of spreading and finishing courses of WMA in accordance
 with the Plans.
 424.3.4.4
 
 Compaction Equipment
 
 Provide a sufficient number, weight, and type of rollers to obtain the required compaction
 and specified pavement density while the WMA is in a workable condition. All rollers must be
 capable of reversing direction without shoving or tearing the mixture.
 424.3.5
 
 Placement Operations
 
 For cold milled surfaces, prepare the surface in accordance with Section 414, Cold
 Milling. Clean the existing surfaces and apply a tack coat in accordance with Section 407,
 “Tack Coat.”
 When placing WMA on Base Course, Proof Roll the Base Course with a 27 ton roller or
 other approved Equipment and correct any soft areas, as directed by the Project Manager.
 Correct deficient areas at the Contractor’s expense. Place the WMA on the approved surface,
 then spread, and strike off to the specified grade and elevation. Spread and compact the
 WMA in layers in accordance with the Plans.
 For new construction and reconstruction, prepare the Subgrade or Base Course as
 follows:
 1)
 
 Clean of loose or Deleterious Materials;
 
 2)
 
 Free of frozen material; and
 
 3)
 
 Meet the moisture and density requirements.
 
 4)
 
 Place prime coat, as required in the Plans unless otherwise approved by the Project
 Manager, in accordance with Section 408, Prime Coat.
 
 Unless otherwise specified in the Plans, for construction on NMDOT Projects using State
 approved WMA designs utilizing greater than 25% RAP the use of a Materials Transfer
 Vehicle is required.
 Materials Transfer Vehicle (MTV): Use a MTV with storage and remixing capabilities on
 all mainline construction when placing WMA State approved designs. The MTV will
 independently remix and deliver mixture from the hauling Equipment to the paving Equipment.
 Furnish an MTV with the following capabilities:
 1.
 
 An unloading system to receive mixtures from the hauling Equipment.
 
 2.
 
 A minimum storage capacity of 13 tons with a remixing system in the MTV storage
 bin.
 
 3.
 
 A discharge conveyor to deliver the mixture to the paver hopper.
 
 4.
 
 The MTV system cannot exceed maximum legal loading on Structures.
 
 Pick-up machines, hopper inserts and material transfer devices are not considered
 MTVs.
 In the event the MTV malfunctions during paving operations, the Contractor can finish the
 Day without the MTV. Do not resume further mainline mix placement until the MTV is
 operational.
 Consistently overloading the WMA mix into the paving machine is not acceptable. Coordinate
 the speed of the paving machine with the production of the plant and keep enough haul
 Equipment available to achieve continuous operation.
 Use the control system on the paving machine to control the grade and the transverse
 slope by either of the following methods:
 Section 424:
 
 Warm Mix Asphalt
 
 Page 219
 
 1.
 
 One end directly and the other indirectly through controlling the transverse slope; or
 
 2.
 
 Each end independently, including screed attachments.
 
 Suspend operations if the control system does not achieve the typical section in
 accordance with the Plans. Place, spread, and finish the courses of WMA according to the
 following:
 1.
 
 Without segregation or tearing;
 
 2.
 
 True to the line, grade, and crown in accordance with the Plans; and
 
 3.
 
 With self-propelled pavers, except as otherwise directed.
 
 On areas where irregularities or unavoidable obstacles make the use of mechanical
 spreading and finishing Equipment impracticable, dump, spread, and level the WMA by other
 methods to achieve the required compacted thickness.
 424.3.5.1
 
 Weather Limitations
 
 Do not place WMA on wet or frozen surfaces or if weather conditions prevent proper
 handling, finishing, and compacting. Place WMA when the Chill Factor is at least 35 °F and
 rising. If the air temperature is 55 °F or warmer, do not consider the Chill Factor.
 424.3.5.2
 
 Compaction
 
 Compact the WMA thoroughly and uniformly immediately after placement. Operate
 rollers at speeds slow enough to minimize displacement of the WMA, including the lines and
 grades of the asphalt edges. Remove marks from pneumatic rollers and immediately correct
 any displacement. The Department will not allow the use of Equipment that crushes the
 aggregate excessively.
 Prevent the WMA from sticking to the roller wheels by keeping the wheels moistened with
 water; water mixed with very small quantities of detergent or other approved material. Do not
 use diesel fuel or other petroleum diluents. At locations inaccessible to the rollers, compact
 the WMA with hot hand tampers, smoothing irons, or mechanical tampers. The Contractor
 may use a trench roller or cleated compression strips under the roller to transmit compression
 to depressed areas.
 Remove areas that become loose, broken, mixed with dirt, segregated or defective,
 replace with fresh WMA, and compact to match the surrounding area, at no additional cost to
 the Department. Immediately correct areas that have excessive or deficient asphalt binder.
 424.3.5.3
 
 Not Used
 
 424.3.5.4
 
 Joints
 
 Place the WMA as continuously as possible. Do not pass rollers over the unprotected
 end of a freshly laid mixture. When placing open-graded friction course over WMA, stagger
 longitudinal joints at least six (6) inches relative to the longitudinal joints of the underlying
 course. Unless otherwise specified, taper transverse and longitudinal joints as follows:
 1.
 
 At least a three (3) ft taper for transverse joints, with a taper slope no steeper than
 24:1.
 
 2.
 
 At least a one (1) ft taper or a notched taper, for longitudinal joints, with a taper
 slope no steeper than 6:1 or a notched taper with a one (1) inch vertical edge at the
 top of the taper connected to a slope no steeper than 6:1.
 
 3.
 
 Cut and square off transverse tapers before commencing new Work.
 
 4.
 
 Clean and tack coat longitudinal joints from previous operations.
 
 5.
 
 Avoid placing longitudinal joints in the wheel paths, unless approved by the Project
 Manager.
 
 Section 424:
 
 Warm Mix Asphalt
 
 Page 220
 
 Completely bond joints. Smooth the surface of each course at the joints. The
 Department will not allow deviations greater than 3/16 inch when tested with a ten (10) ft
 straightedge in any direction. When paving under traffic, schedule the daily surfacing
 operations so that tapered longitudinal joints are not exposed for longer than seven (7) Days.
 424.3.5.5
 
 Surface Tolerances
 
 Smooth the surface of each completed course and prevent deviations larger than 1/8 inch
 using a ten (10) ft straightedge in any direction. Immediately correct deviations exceeding this
 tolerance. Provide a final WMA surfacing course that conforms to Section 401, “Pavement
 Smoothness Measurement.”
 424.3.5.6
 
 Plan Surfacing Depths
 
 Provide pavement at the depth specified in the Contract. Monitor depths by calculating
 continuous production yields using the formula found in the MT-1, as maintained by the State
 Construction Bureau. Calculate the required yield and the corresponding yields for 0.25 inch
 increase (upper limit) and decrease (lower limit). The Project Manager may adjust the
 required yield to fit field conditions. If adjusted, the new target yield will be communicated to
 the Contractor in writing. Control production to keep yield within the upper and lower limits.
 Correct deficiencies at no cost to the Department. Correct deficient depths during placement.
 Address Plan Surfacing Depths in the Quality Control Plan.
 424.3.5.7
 
 Test Strip & Shakedown Period
 
 Construct a maximum 1,000 ton test strip for each WMA mix design with a minimum of
 three (3) Contractor and three (3) agency samples to evaluate the JMF, process control, and
 placement operations. Construct test strip on Shoulder, low volume segments of the
 pavement, or area approved by the Project Manager. Correct and modify non-complying
 placement operations and produce necessary process control adjustments. Develop a revised
 JMF if necessary based on the results of the test strip. Production and placement operations
 prior to approval of the revised JMF and placement operations are at the Contractor’s risk.
 For purposes of payment, the test strip will be evaluated in conformance with Section 416,
 Minor Paving. If accepted, the test strip will have a pay factor of 1.0. If rejected, said material
 shall be handled in accordance with Section 424.3.6.1.3 Adherence to Specifications and
 Rejection of Non-specification Material. Remove unaccepted test strip material placed within
 the Roadway Prism at no cost to the Department. If the Contractor disagrees with removing
 and replacing unacceptable material placed in test strips outside the Roadway Prism, the
 Assistant District Engineer for Construction, based on engineering judgment, will decide if the
 material can remain in place with a maximum pay factor of 50%, or shall be removed and
 replaced at no cost to the Department. If the test strip is rejected, construct a subsequent test
 strip. Do not proceed to full production until an accepted test strip is produced. After the test
 strip is placed, continue to evaluate the mix properties and the JMF during the placement of
 the first two (2) sublots in the first lot. Changes may be made to either the JMF or the mix
 proportions and/or properties with the concurrence of the Assistant District Engineer for
 Construction. For changes made prior to the completion of the first two (2) sublots, the
 adjustments will be applied to the entire lot for purposes of payment.
 The Project Manager may waive test strip requirements for the Project, if requested by
 the Contractor based on prior experience with the JMF.
 For QLA Projects, the Shakedown Period is defined as the first two (2) sublots produced
 in the first lot.
 For Non-QLA Projects, the Shakedown Period is defined as the test strip. As the test
 strip is placed, evaluate the mix properties and the JMF. Changes may be made to either the
 JMF or the mix proportions and/or properties with the concurrence of the Project Manager,
 Assistant District Engineer for Construction and the State Asphalt Engineer.

 The Department will evaluate (QA) test results from Projects with Bid quantities less than
 15,000 tons for specification compliance in accordance with the following procedures: If the
 mean of the test results for each property is within the Acceptance Tolerances as listed in
 Table 424.3.6.2.1:1, “Acceptance Testing Tolerances,” the Material will be accepted at full
 Contract price except that Roadway density will be adjusted in price in accordance with
 Section 901.5, Quality Level Analysis. If the mean of the test results for any of the listed
 properties is outside of the tolerances as listed in Table 424.3.6.2.1:1, “Acceptance Testing
 Tolerances,” then the Department will determine Acceptance of the Material in accordance
 with 901.1.3, “Acceptance Sampling and Testing,” and Section 901.5, “Quality Level Analysis.”
 A composite pay factor of more than 1.00 is not allowed for Projects with Bid quantities less
 than 15,000 tons. Remove and replace rejected Material with specification Material at no
 additional cost to the Department.
 424.3.6.2.1.1.1
 
 Acceptance of Pavement Density
 
 The target density for Acceptance of WMA will be 94.5% of the theoretical maximum density
 as determined from AASHTO T 209. For determination of maximum specific gravity, obtain
 and test a minimum of two (2) samples and ensure the Department obtains and tests a
 minimum of one (1) sample for each Day that the WMA is placed. Each individual density test
 value obtained must be from 92.0% to 97.0% of the theoretical maximum density.
 To be prepared for dispute resolution, the Contractor is to provide one (1) additional core
 for each core tested by the Department for Acceptance of density. The additional core is to be
 from the same lot as the initial core and shall be generated from the random sample plan. If
 the Contractor believes the Department’s cut pavement samples have been damaged they
 Section 424:
 
 Warm Mix Asphalt
 
 Page 225
 
 may invoke Section 424.3.7 Dispute Resolution. The Referee Lab results will replace the
 initial core in determining pay factor. The Assistant District Engineer for Construction will
 make the final decision on accepting or rejecting material, based on the Referee Laboratory’s
 result(s) by:
 1.
 
 Accepting the section or sublot if the density test falls between 92.0% - 97.0% ;
 
 2.
 
 Determining that a portion, based on visual determination, or all of the Material in
 that section or sublot shall be removed or replaced at no additional cost to the
 Department;
 
 3.
 
 Determining that a portion, based on visual determination, of the Material in that
 section or sublot will be paid for at a 50% pay factor.
 
 For purposes of Acceptance and pay factor determination, determine the density from cut
 pavement sections (cores) with 6-inch diameters extending through the full thickness of the
 WMA. Determine the pay factor in accordance with Section 901.5, Quality Level Analysis.
 Use a minimum of ten (10) cores to determine the pay factor, unless otherwise directed by the
 Assistant District Engineer for Construction. Determine the theoretical maximum density using
 an average of the maximum specific gravity values obtained by the Department and the
 Contractor the Day the core’s Material was placed. If a composite pay factor of more than
 1.00 is calculated, the composite pay factor will be a 1.00 for the purposes of payment.
 For Projects consisting of single lift overlays or mill and inlay with a single lift of two and a
 half inches or less, the Project Manager may grant an exception to the mean density target
 requirement of at least 94.5% of the theoretical maximum density if the Contractor can
 demonstrate that a minimum of 92.0% cannot be reasonably obtained because of the existing
 conditions of the Pavement Structure or Subgrade Materials. The Contractor demonstrates
 this by providing density results obtained during paving operations witnessed by a State
 Inspector at the location in question. If the Project Manager grants this exemption, construct a
 Roadway test strip and develop a WMA compaction process to get the highest possible
 density based on an approved roller’s density gain per pass, in accordance with Section
 424.3.4.4, Compaction Equipment. The Project Manager will approve the process, establish a
 new target value for density and establish a new Acceptance lot only for the portion of the
 Project addressed herein (except for the Roadway test strip) before paving begins or
 continues.
 Density shall not fall below 91%. If a lot does not meet either of the revised
 density requirements, the Project Manager will, with the concurrence of the Assistant District
 Engineer for Construction, do the following:
 1.
 
 Accept and pay for the lot of WMA at 50% of the Bid Item Unit Price; or
 
 2.
 
 Reject the in-place material and require the Contractor to remove and replace.
 
 424.3.6.3
 
 QLA
 
 On Projects with Bid quantities of 15,000 tons or more, the Department will determine
 Acceptance of the Materials in accordance with Section 901.5, “Quality Level Analysis,” using
 the Acceptance limits in Table 424.3.6.2.1:1, “Acceptance Testing Tolerances”. Acceptance
 lots shall be between 15,000 tons and 30,000 tons, as determined at the pre-paving
 conference. Table 424.3.6.2.1:2 indicates properties that will be tracked for purposes of
 Quality Assurance. For all QLA Projects, if a composite pay factor of more than 1.00 is
 calculated, the composite pay factor will be a 1.00 for the purposes of payment.
 424.3.6.3.1
 
 Acceptance of Pavement Density
 
 The target density for Acceptance of WMA will be 94.5% of the theoretical maximum
 density as determined from AASHTO T 209. For determination of maximum specific gravity,
 obtain and test a minimum of two (2) samples and ensure the Department obtains and tests a
 minimum of one (1) sample for each Day that the WMA is placed, in accordance with the
 random sampling plan. Each individual density test value obtained must be from 92.0% to
 97.0% of the theoretical maximum density.
 For purposes of Acceptance and pay factor determination, determine the density from cut
 pavement sections (cores) with 6-inch diameters extending through the full thickness of the
 Section 424:
 
 Warm Mix Asphalt
 
 Page 226
 
 WMA. Determine the pay factor in accordance with Section 901.5, Quality Level Analysis.
 Use a minimum of ten (10) cores to determine the pay factor, unless otherwise directed by the
 Assistant District Engineer for Construction. To be prepared for dispute resolution, the
 Contractor is to provide one (1) additional core for each core tested by the Department for
 Acceptance of density. The additional core is to be from the same lot as the initial core and
 shall be generated from the random sample plan. If the Contractor or Department believes the
 Department’s cut pavement samples have been damaged they may invoke Section 424.3.7
 Dispute Resolution. The Referee Lab results will replace the initial core in determining pay
 factor. Determine the theoretical maximum density using an average of the maximum specific
 gravity values obtained by the Department and the Contractor the Day the core’s Material was
 placed. If a composite pay factor of more than 1.00 is calculated, the composite pay factor will
 be a 1.00 for the purposes of payment.
 For Projects consisting of single lift overlays or mill and inlay with a single lift of two and a
 half inches or less, the Project Manager may grant an exception to the mean density target
 requirement of at least 94.5% of the theoretical maximum density if the Contractor can
 demonstrate that a minimum of 92.0% cannot be reasonably obtained because of the existing
 conditions of the Pavement Structure or Subgrade Materials. The Contractor demonstrates
 this by providing non-destructive density results obtained during paving operations witnessed
 by a State Inspector at the location in question. If the Project Manager grants this exemption,
 construct a Roadway test strip and develop a WMA compaction process to get the highest
 possible density based on an approved roller’s density gain per pass, in accordance with
 Section 424.3.4.4, Compaction Equipment. The Project Manager will approve the process,
 establish a new target value for density and establish a new Acceptance lot only for the portion
 of the Project addressed herein (except for the Roadway test strip) before paving begins or
 continues. Density shall not fall below 91%. If a lot does not meet either of the revised
 density requirements, the Project Manager will, with the concurrence of the Assistant District
 Engineer for Construction, do the following:
 1.
 
 Accept and pay for the lot of WMA at 50% of the Bid Item Unit Price; or
 
 2.
 
 Reject the in-place material and require the Contractor to remove and replace at no
 cost to the Department.
 
 424.3.6.4 Independent Assurance Testing
 The Department will perform Independent Assurance sampling and testing in accordance
 with Section 901.3, “Independent Assurance Testing.”
 424.3.7 Dispute Resolution
 For any test incorporated into the pay factor, if a dispute exists between the Department
 and the Contractor about the validity of the test result, either party may invoke a referee lab.
 The State Asphalt Engineer will maintain a list of labs that are willing and capable of
 performing referee testing. All referee labs shall be AASHTO Materials Reference Laboratory
 (AMRL) certified for the test(s) to be performed. Neither the Department’s Project staff, nor
 the Contractor will know who is performing the referee testing. The State Asphalt Engineer
 will select a Laboratory, without disclosing the name of the lab to Department Project
 Personnel or Contractor personnel, from the following, not in priority order:
 1.
 
 A District Laboratory not from the District in which the Project resides; or
 
 2.
 
 A private Laboratory currently listed on the State Material’s Bureau’s list of approved
 private labs not involved in the subject Project in any manner, such as mix design
 submittal, preliminary testing for design, etc. Only laboratories that are in the
 routine business of providing testing and designs will be considered. Contractor
 owned laboratories will not be allowed.
 
 When a referee lab is used, the referee lab’s test results will be used in determining the
 pay factor. The referee lab must be invoked in writing within ten (10) Calendar Days of
 receiving the test results from the other party. If not invoked within ten (10) Calendar Days,
 the test results are deemed accepted. The results will be used to determine pay factors. The
 Department’s prior test results or the Contractor’s prior test results for the test in question will
 Section 424:
 
 Warm Mix Asphalt
 
 Page 227
 
 be discarded. If the composite pay factor decreases from applying the referee lab’s results,
 the Contractor shall pay for the testing performed by the referee lab. If the composite pay
 factor increases from applying the referee lab’s results, the Department will pay for the testing
 performed by the referee lab. If the composite pay factor remains unchanged, the cost shall
 be split with each party responsible for 50% of the total cost.
 For all testing incorporated into the pay factor, each party shall generate an additional
 sample from the Department’s Acceptance Samples and the Contractor’s Quality Control
 Samples used in pay factor analysis. Failure to provide the referee samples prior to testing
 the initial sample will result in the Project Manager suspending the Project at no cost to the
 Department. Additional time will not be added to the Contract for Project suspension caused
 by failure to comply with Dispute Resolution Process. Work shall not resume until the
 Contractor provides the delayed sample(s) and satisfies the Project Manager, in writing, that
 future samples will be provided in compliance with this requirement. The extra sample(s) is
 (are) to be retained by the Department. The Department will retain the samples at the Project
 location inside a locked cargo container, provided by the Contractor at no cost to the State.
 The State will provide the lock for the cargo container. Once the pay factor is determined
 dispose of the unused samples at no cost to the Department. In no case will the unused
 samples be disposed of prior to the ten (10) Calendar Day period in which the Dispute
 Resolution process may be invoked. .For Pavement Density, the Contractor shall provide an
 additional core only for each core provided to the Department for Acceptance. The additional
 core will be stored and retained in the provided container. Should the Contractor invoke the
 Dispute Resolution Process for Density, the second core will be provided to the Referee Lab.,
 The density pay factor for the material in question will be based solely on the Referee Lab
 result, not including Department or Contractor results.
 Failure to comply with the requirements contained herein will result in the pay factor
 being calculated in accordance with the applicable Sections of 424, Superpave (QLA and NonQLA), and 901, Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QC/QA). No test results will be replaced
 by referee results.
 424.4
 
 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 
 If the Department measures WMA by the square yard, the Department will use the
 average width of the WMA in place and the length from station to station along the centerline
 of the Roadway when calculating quantities.

 WMA will be evaluated on a lot-by-lot basis at a price determined by multiplying the Bid Item
 Unit Price by the weighting factor. The Department will use Table 424.5.1.1:1, “Weighting
 Factors,” to calculate each lot’s composite pay factor. The pay factor for the entire Project will
 be calculated by applying weighted averages, based on tonnage contained within each lot, to
 each lot’s composite pay factor. If the composite pay factor for a lot is greater than 1.0, the
 pay factor will be set at 1.0.

 Transporting
 
 Use truck mixers, truck agitators or non-agitating trucks that comply with Section 510.3.2,
 “Transporting.”
 450.3.2.4
 
 Slip-Form Paver
 
 Place the concrete with an approved slip-form paver designed to spread, consolidate
 screed, float, and finish the concrete in one (1) complete pass to create a dense and
 homogeneous pavement. Minimize the use of hand finishing.
 The vibrators of the slip-form paver must be located behind the auger. Do not use pavers
 with vibrators in front of the auger.
 Equip slip-form pavers with internal vibrators that meet or exceed the following
 Specifications at 10,000 cycles per minute (cpm) under no-load conditions:
 1.
 
 Amplitude (peak to peak) = 0.070 inch; and
 
 2.
 
 Centrifugal force = 1,200 lb
 
 Equip the slip-form paver with an electronic monitoring device capable of the following:
 1.
 
 Displaying the operating frequency of each internal vibrator;
 
 2.
 
 Continuously recording at a minimum the following:
 a.
 
 Time of Day,
 
 b.
 
 Station location,
 
 c.
 
 Paver track speed, and
 
 d.
 
 Operating frequency of each vibrator.
 
 Store all information captured by the electronic monitoring system throughout the Project.
 This information is to be used only for Project information by the Department, and will be
 provided to the Project Manager at his request during the course of the Project and at the
 completion of the Project.
 Position the vibrators no further apart than the manufacturer’s recommendations for
 horizontal spacing of the vibrators; but do not exceed 18 inches, center-to-center. Ensure that
 the space from the outer edge of the pavement to the center of the outside vibrator does not
 exceed nine (9) inches, or ½ the maximum recommended spacing, whichever is less.
 450.3.2.5
 
 Concrete Jointing Equipment
 
 Provide enough sawing Equipment and/or joint insertion Equipment to complete the Work
 within the allotted time. The Contractor may use a water-cooled diamond edge saw blade, an
 abrasive wheel, an “early entry dry cut” type with a skid plate, as defined by ACI 302 or a
 control joint insertion system approved by the Project Manager and State Materials Bureau.
 Provide at least one (1) additional saw or insertion tool in good working order. Keep an ample
 supply of saw blades (and skid plates, if the "early entry dry cut" saws are used) at the Work
 site during sawing operations.
 450.3.2.6
 
 Curing Compound Application Equipment
 
 Apply curing compounds with Equipment that uses a pressure tank or pump. Ensure that
 the Equipment has a feed tank agitator that provides continuous agitation of the compound
 during spraying operations. Use a nozzle that contains enough air to thoroughly atomize the
 compound.
 450.3.3
 
 Operations
 
 For slip-form paving, construct the Subgrade of sufficient width to accommodate the slipform Equipment.
 Section 450:
 
 Portland Cement Concrete Pavement (QLA)
 
 Page 231
 
 Provide enough lateral support to construct the section in accordance with the Contract.
 Maintain the smoothness and compaction of the Base Course in the specified condition
 until the concrete placement is completed.
 Moisten untreated aggregate base layer, if used, before paving.
 450.3.3.1
 
 Handling, Measuring, Batching, and Mixing Materials
 
 Handle, measure, batch, and mix the Materials in accordance with Section 510, "Portland
 Cement Concrete." The maximum mixing time for either truck mixers or non-agitating mixers
 is specified in Section 510.3.4.2, “Mixing Time."
 450.3.3.2
 
 Placing, Spreading, and Consolidating Concrete
 
 Place concrete with the specified thickness along the full width of the lane or area being
 paved. Prevent segregation and minimize redistribution. Place the concrete continuously
 between transverse joints without using intermediate bulkheads.
 When using dowel baskets do not end-dump the concrete directly onto the dowel
 baskets. The Contractor may use end-dumps to transfer the concrete to the Equipment
 designed to place it completely across the grade. Do not windrow the concrete.
 When placing concrete adjacent to a newly constructed PCCP lane, do not operate
 Equipment or traffic on the lane until the concrete has achieved a compressive strength of at
 least 3,000 psi, as determined by the Maturity Method, as described in Section 510.3.5.2.
 When working on existing pavement, use Equipment with protective pads on crawler
 tracks or rubber-tire wheels. Set the crawler tracks or rubber-tire wheels far enough from the
 pavement edge to prevent damage to the pavement.
 450.3.3.2.1
 
 Slip-Form Paving
 
 Use a slip-form paver that complies with Section 450.3.2.4 to distribute the concrete
 uniformly. Vibrate the full width and depth of the concrete to produce maximum consolidation
 without segregation. Ensure that the vibration produces uniform concrete that will stand
 normal to the surface with sharp well-defined edges.
 Coordinate concrete mixing, delivering, and spreading operations in order to provide
 uniform progress and to eliminate stopping and starting the paver. If it is necessary to stop the
 paver, also stop the vibratory and tamping elements immediately. Do not apply external
 tractive force to the machine: the machine must be propelled only by its own mechanisms.
 450.3.3.2.2
 
 Other Paving
 
 For paving operations that are not slip formed, the Contractor will place Class AA-HPD
 concrete pavement between stationary side forms. Consolidate the concrete by internal
 vibration and finish it to the required surface smoothness using the hand-float method or other
 suitable means. Cure the concrete with approved methods.
 Leave wood or metal forms in place at least 12 hours after placing the concrete. If
 necessary, take additional efforts to prevent thermal cracking of the concrete. Clean and oil
 the forms each time they are used. Apply a curing compound to the concrete surfaces
 exposed by removal of the forms immediately after removing the forms.
 Check the form’s alignment and grade elevations and make the necessary corrections
 before placing the concrete. If a form is disturbed or if the Base Course under a form
 becomes unstable, reset and recheck the form, as directed by the Project Manager.
 Section 450:
 
 Portland Cement Concrete Pavement (QLA)

 450.3.3.3
 
 Temperature and Weather Limitations
 
 Temperature and weather limitations are defined in Section 511.3.4, "Temperature and
 Weather Limitations." Keep the concrete temperature between 50 °F to 90 °F at the time of
 placement. In addition for cold weather placement refer to Section 511.3.3.1 “Cold Weather
 Concrete.”
 450.3.3.4
 
 Rate of Evaporation Limitations
 
 The Contractor shall continuously monitor the evaporation potential at a height not to
 exceed 5 feet above the surface of the concrete as determined from Figure 511.3.3.5:1,
 "Surface Evaporation from Concrete" at the actual placement location. Computerized
 Equipment, furnished by the Contractor, is set to automatically take the required readings shall
 be used for this purpose. Readings shall be taken at least once every 5 minutes beginning at
 least 15 minutes before the placement begins, and continuing until the final application of the
 curing compound has been completed. All readings shall be graphically plotted on a
 continuous time scale.
 Do not place (or continue to place) PCCP if the average evaporation potential over any
 10 minute period of time is greater than 0.2 lb per square foot per hour. If the evaporation
 exceeds the 0.15 lb per square foot per hour, one (1) or more of the following actions shall be
 implemented to reduce the rate of evaporation, as approved by the Project Manager:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 Use an evaporation retarder (If used, this cannot be used as a finishing aide);
 Erect windbreaks to reduce the wind velocity over the concrete surface.
 Place concrete during nighttime or early morning hours.
 Lower the fresh concrete temperature during hot weather.
 This can be
 accomplished by using cool aggregate and chilled water, by adding ice as part of
 the mixing water, or by adding liquid nitrogen to the concrete mix after all mix
 ingredients have been placed into the ready mix truck.
 Increase the relative humidity at the site with a fog spray maintained over the entire
 concrete surface until the final finish has been achieved and the curing system has
 been applied.
 
 5.
 
 450.3.3.5
 
 Change in Atmospheric Conditions
 
 During marginal weather placement of any PCCP by the Contractor is at his own risk.
 Repair or replace concrete that is determined to be damaged due to weather conditions by the
 Assistant District Engineer (Construction), at no additional cost to the Department.
 450.3.4
 
 Joints
 
 Submit the proposed joint layout plan in .pdf format to the Project Manager, State
 Pavement Engineer and the State Materials Bureau for review and approval at least four (4)
 weeks before starting concrete slab construction. The proposed joint layout plan shall have
 the lane markings clearly depicted. Attempts shall be made in the submitted jointing plan for
 mainline paving not to place longitudinal joints in the wheel path. After receiving the
 recommendations and/or responses from the State Pavement Engineer and from the State
 Materials Bureau, the Project Manager will either approve or reject the submittal within 10
 Working Days from the date of submittal.
 Construct joints at the locations, intervals, and dimensions shown in the approved joint
 layout plan, and seal them in accordance with Section 452, "Sealing and Resealing Concrete
 Pavement Joints." Ensure no re-entrant corners. For typical slabs the longitudinal joint
 spacing shall not exceed 12 feet and the transverse joint spacing shall not exceed 15 feet.
 The maximum slab length-to-width ratio shall not be greater than 1.25:1 for the primary
 traveled lanes and longitudinal joints shall be placed within the lane stripe or as approved by
 the Project Manager and NMDOT Pavement Engineer. Avoid tapered joints if possible. If a
 tapered joint is formed, place a control joint at:
 Section 450:
 
 Portland Cement Concrete Pavement (QLA)
 
 Page 233
 
 1.
 
 One-half the distance between the end of the taper and the opposite end, if the base
 leg is less than or equal to ten (10) ft and longer than five (5) ft; or
 
 2.
 
 Third points along the base leg, if the base leg is longer than ten (10) ft.
 
 3.
 
 No slabs will have angles less than 60 degrees.
 
 4.
 
 Joints shall be “dog-legged” through curve radius points. Dog leg should be at least
 24 inches in length to the radius point.
 
 5.
 
 Construct joint faces perpendicular to the PCCP surface.
 
 Install dowels at any joints added to control cracking in exactly the same way as the
 standard joints.
 Construct transverse and longitudinal contraction joints by inserting control joints while
 the concrete is still plastic, or by sawing the freshly hardened concrete as soon as possible
 after placing it. Make the initial sawcut at least one third the pavement depth. Do not allow
 the saw to cut so deep that any reinforcement is damaged.
 Begin sawing of the joints as soon as possible after the concrete has hardened enough to
 permit a person to stand on the surface without leaving visible tracks or indentations. All
 sawcutting must be completed no later than four (4) hours after the concrete has hardened
 enough that a person can stand on the surface without leaving visible tracks or indentations.
 In all cases, regardless of setting characteristics, all sawcutting must be completed before the
 concrete is seven (7) hours old.
 Make transverse contraction and longitudinal joints in two-phases. Make the initial saw
 cut or inserted joint wide enough and deep enough to ensure that a sufficiently weakened
 cross-section exists, but not less than 1/3 the thickness of the concrete. Make the second
 sealant reservoir-shaping saw cut in accordance with the details shown in the Plans. Do not
 damage the steel reinforcement with any saw cut.
 All PCCP panels containing uncontrolled cracks shall be removed and replaced at no
 cost or additional time to the Department. The Project shall not be granted final Acceptance
 until all panels containing uncontrolled cracks have been removed and replaced.
 Change saw blades (and the skid plates, when using the early entry dry cut method) as
 often as required to control and minimize spalling. Maintain a sufficient supply of replacement
 saw blades and skid plates at the Project site to insure that the sawing operations will proceed
 without interruption until completed.
 Saw joints sequentially. However, the Contractor may saw control transverse joints at
 intervals shown in the Contract, or at intervals that will most effectively minimize the possibility
 of uncontrolled cracking.
 If necessary, perform the sawing operations Day and night, regardless of weather
 conditions. Do not saw a joint if a crack occurs at or near the joint location before sawing.
 Immediately discontinue sawing of a joint when a crack develops ahead of the saw.
 450.3.4.1
 
 Longitudinal Joints
 
 Place tie bars perpendicular to the longitudinal joints using approved Equipment, or
 secure the joints with chairs or baskets. Do not place tie bars within 15 inches of transverse
 joints. Only paint or coat tie bars if it is necessary to repair the corrosion-resistant coating.
 The combined width of all concrete slabs tied together shall be not more than 40 feet.
 Should the tie bars be found to be closer than one (1) inch to the bottom of the sawed
 joint, or closer than two (2) inches to the bottom of the slab, or if the spacing between tie bars
 is found to be greater than 30 inches, the Contractor shall cease paving operations until it can
 be successfully demonstrated that the required tolerances will be met. The control joint shall
 Section 450:
 
 Portland Cement Concrete Pavement (QLA)
 
 Page 234
 
 then be made by sawing in hardened concrete in accordance with the plan details and with
 Section 450.3.4.
 Use a two-part threaded tie bar and splice coupler system, or bend the tie bars, unless
 otherwise directed by the Project Manager. Only bend tie bars made of Grade 420 steel.
 Bend tie bars at right angles against the form of the first lane constructed and then straighten
 them into final position before placing the concrete of the adjacent lane.
 If construction of PCCP abuts existing pavement, drill the holes at mid-depth of the
 thinner slab. Drill the face of the existing PCCP to accept half of the tie bar length. Ensure
 that the drill holes are a diameter that provides a close fit for the tie bars to be epoxied into the
 drill holes. Construct joints with tie bars as shown on the Plans.
 450.3.4.2
 
 Transverse Joints
 
 Construct transverse contraction joints with load transfer devices (dowels). Hold dowels
 in position parallel to the surface and centerline of the slab with chairs or other approved
 supports as approved by the Project Manager. Submit shop drawings of the welded dowel
 assemblies to the Project Manager for approval by State Pavement Engineer. Do not place
 concrete until the Department approves the welded dowel assemblies.
 Dowel bars shall be installed within the tolerances and of the size, grade and spacing
 specified. Horizontal support wires or shipping braces shall be non-deformed bars or wires
 with a diameter less than or equal to 0.307 inches (gauge 0 wire). The number of horizontal
 support wires or shipping braces shall be limited to a maximum of five (5) per assembly. The
 center of the dowel assembly or insertion location shall be marked on both sides of the
 pavement slab for reference in sawing the joint. Dowel bars shall be furnished in a rigid
 welded assembly or, when the Contractor demonstrates that the placement can be made
 within required tolerances, placed by a dowel insertion machine. Assembly should be
 securely fastened to the base/subbase and constructed to firmly hold all the centerline of all
 dowel bars at T/2 depth with a minimum of three (3) inches cover, parallel to each other and to
 the pavement grade and alignment. See Detail indicated in the Contract Plans or standard
 Plan serials for the applicable section. Dowel placement tolerances are:
 Horizontal translation = two (2) inches
 Horizontal Skew = 3/8 inch
 Vertical Translation = 1/4 inch
 Vertical Skew = 3/8 inch
 Longitudinal Side Shift/Translation = one (1) inch
 The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that the dowels remain properly aligned and in
 the proper locations before and during the placing procedure. Do not cut the tie wires holding
 the baskets together before placing the concrete.
 Thoroughly and uniformly coat each dowel and each tie wire along its full length with an
 approved form release agent not more than twelve (12) hours before concrete placement. Do
 not use grease to lubricate the dowels. If the concrete placement is postponed or delayed the
 dowels will be re-coated.
 450.3.4.3
 
 Transverse Construction Joints
 
 Make construction joints with approved corrosion resistant dowels. Use a dowel size and
 spacing that is adequate for the joint, and is approved by the Project Manager.
 If construction of PCCP abuts existing pavement, drill the holes at mid-depth of the
 thinner slab. Drill the face of the existing PCCP to accept half of the dowel length.
 Do not construct a transverse construction joint within five (5) foot of a control joint or
 weakened plane. If concrete placement stops, the final slab must measure at least five
 Section 450:
 
 Portland Cement Concrete Pavement (QLA)
 
 Page 235
 
 (5) foot. If the final slab is less than five (5) foot, remove the excess concrete to the preceding
 joint, as directed by the Project Manager. Unanticipated construction joints need to be tied.
 The Contractor is responsible for preventing uncontrolled cracking and/or loss of
 pavement durability by whatever means necessary, including but not limited to placing
 construction joints and/or contraction joints wherever necessary.
 450.3.4.4
 
 Final Location of Dowels and Tie Bars
 
 Within 72 hours of concrete placement confirm that the final location of the transverse
 dowel bars and the longitudinal tie bars comply with the specified location and placement
 tolerances for every transverse joint and longitudinal joint in the first 120 linear feet of paving,
 or as otherwise specified. Equipment used to determine the final location shall be a Magnetic
 Tomography (i.e.: MIT Scan 2) or Magnetic Field Detection (i.e.: Hilti Ferroscan FS 10) or
 Ground Penetrating Radar equipped with dual side-by-side antennas or approved equal
 approved by the Project Manager and State Concrete Engineer.
 If all of the dowels and tie bars are properly located and aligned on the first 120 linear
 feet, then the frequency used to confirm the final location of the dowels can be reduced to one
 (1) randomly selected longitudinal and transverse joint for within each 1000 linear feet for the
 duration of the Project and/or as directed by the Project Manager. Paving can only proceed
 when all surveyed steel and dowels are confirmed by the Project Manager to be in proper
 location for each 1000 foot increment.
 1.
 
 If the dowel bars or the tie bars do not comply with the Project Requirements, then
 all placement of concrete must stop until the Contractor can provide a corrective
 action plan to ensure the dowel bars and the tie bars are located in accordance with
 Project requirements. At the discretion of the Assistant District Engineer for
 Construction, either remove and replace the dowels and/or tie bars that do not
 comply with this specification or allow the non-complying bars to remain at a
 reduced price determined by the Assistant District Engineer. Do not resume
 placement of concrete operations until approved by the Assistant District Engineer
 (Construction) in concurrence with the State Pavement Engineer and State
 Concrete Engineer. When the placement operations are resumed, the final location
 of the dowel bars and tie bars shall be confirmed in accordance with Paragraph 1
 above.
 
 The Contractor will be responsible for providing the appropriate Equipment and qualified
 personnel to provide the specified test and report to the Project Manager. This Work will be
 Incidental to concrete pavement.
 450.3.5
 
 Finishing
 
 After the concrete has been discharged from the truck, no additional water will be added
 to the concrete.
 Provide a final surface finish that complies with the Project requirements for MRI,
 measured in accordance with Section 401 “Pavement Smoothness Measurement.”
 Correct pavement edge slumping (exclusive of specified edging) in excess of ¼ inch
 before the concrete hardens. If edge slump exceeds ¼ inch within 10 feet, or less, of
 hardened concrete, replace the entire panel between the transverse and longitudinal joints.
 Before the concrete’s initial set, work the edges and joints with the appropriate tools to
 produce a well-defined and continuous radius with a smooth and dense mortar finish that is
 not segregated nor prematurely sealed. Minimize disturbance of the slab surface during
 finishing operations. It is the Contractor’s responsibility not to over-work the surface of the
 fresh concrete. Any plastic shrinkage cracks that occur shall be repaired or replaced at the
 discretion of the Project Manager at no cost in time or money to the department.
 
 Section 450:
 
 Portland Cement Concrete Pavement (QLA)
 
 Page 236
 
 Thoroughly clean the sawed area and, after completion of the sawing process. Seal the
 joint immediately, if required by the Project Manager.
 Give the pavement a final wearing surface by tining or grooving as required in Section
 450.3.5.1 “Texturing of PCCP.”
 450.3.5.1
 
 Texturing of PCCP
 
 When tining, use a mechanical device such as a wire broom or comb having a single row
 of tines 1/8 inch +/-1/64 inch width. The depth of groove in the plastic concrete shall be 1/8
 inch +/- 1/16 inch. Tining will be Longitudinal unless otherwise specified in the Contract.
 Longitudinal Tining: The tines shall be uniformly spaced at ¾ inch intervals. Use
 Equipment with horizontal and vertical controls to ensure straight, uniform depth grooves. A
 two (2) inch to three (3) inch wide strip of pavement surface shall be protected from
 longitudinal surface grooving for the length of and centered over the longitudinal joint.
 Transverse Tining: The tines shall be randomly spaced from 3/8 inch to 1 5/8 inch with
 no more than 50% of the spacing exceeding one (1) inch. Leave a four (4) inch to six (6) inch
 wide un-tined strip of pavement surface centered over each transverse joint.
 Perform the tining operation at such time and manner that the desired surface texture will
 be achieved while minimizing displacement of the larger aggregate particles and before the
 surface permanently sets. Where abutting pavement is to be placed, the texturing shall
 extend as close to the edge as possible without damaging the edge. If abutting pavement is
 not to be placed, the six (6) inch area nearest the edge or one (1) foot from the face of the
 curb shall not be textured. All uniform width slabs of 20 feet or narrower and less than 600 feet
 in length, as well as mainline and ramp pavement during Equipment breakdowns, may be
 textured by hand methods.
 When diamond grooving is specified or allowed in the Contract Plans, allow concrete to
 cure, but no sooner than 48 hours groove the surface of the concrete in accordance with
 Section 455, "Diamond Grinding and Grooving of Portland Concrete Cement Pavement."
 Unless otherwise approved by the Project Manager, make grooves as required by the Project
 Specifications.
 Stamp the concrete surface near the right hand edge of the panel at the start and end of
 paving each Day, indicating the date, month, and year of placement.
 Stamp the concrete surface at 500-foot intervals near the right-hand edge of the
 pavement indicating the Roadway station.
 450.3.5.2
 
 Protection of Fresh Concrete
 
 To protect the fresh concrete from unanticipated storm events, keep enough waterproof
 sheeting at the placement location to cover the maximum anticipated amount of pavement that
 can be placed in a three (3)-hour period. Reserve this sheeting exclusively to protect the
 pavement.
 450.3.5.3
 
 Surfacing Smoothness Requirements
 
 Test the longitudinal smoothness of the PCCP finished surface in each through traffic
 lane and passing lane with an approved Profile, in accordance with Section 401, "Pavement
 Smoothness Measurement."
 The Department will exclude the following locations from the Profiler measurement.
 Evaluate them using a straightedge in accordance with Section 401, "Pavement Smoothness
 Measurement."

 450.3.5.4 Straightedge Measurements
 Measure the surface of PCCP not subject to Profiler measurements using an approved
 10-foot straightedge at both right angles and parallel to the centerline. Correct surface
 deviations greater than ¼ inch within ten (10) feet.
 450.3.6
 
 Curing
 
 Begin application of the approved curing system as soon as possible after the concrete is
 placed.
 
 Do not wait until the bleed water has disappeared.
 
 
 Do not wait until all of the concrete has been placed if the curing system can be
 applied sooner.
 
 
 
 No further finishing operations shall be performed after the curing system has been
 applied.
 
 Ensure that the entire surface of the newly placed concrete has been completely covered
 by applying the approved curing system at the earliest opportunity.
 The use of an Evaporation Retarder is permitted. The Evaporation Retarder must be
 used in strict accordance with the manufacturer’s directions. Once the Evaporation Retarder
 has been evenly applied to the concrete, do not touch or finish any portion of the coated
 concrete until it is ready for the final surfacing treatment. The Evaporation Retarder may not
 be used as a finishing aide or in any manner to facilitate finishing the surface of the concrete.
 450.3.6.1
 
 Application of Curing Compound
 
 Before placing the curing compound in the spray tank, thoroughly agitate it with
 compressed air, or other approved means, until the pigments in the original container are
 uniformly suspended. Do not dilute or alter the curing compound in any way.
 Place the curing compound directly into the spray tanks from the manufacturer’s original
 containers bearing the manufacturer’s name, brand, and lot number.
 If, because of cold temperature, the curing compound becomes too viscous for proper
 stiffening or application, or if portions of the curing compound have been precipitated from
 solution, follow the manufacturer’s recommendations to restore proper fluidity and dispersion.
 Apply curing compound to the entire area of the exposed concrete surface with an
 approved mechanical spray machine. Protect the fog spray from the wind with an adequate
 shield and apply uniformly until it completely covers the entire surface without gaps or
 openings in the coverage, at an application rate equal or greater than the minimum rate
 recommended by the manufacturer. Provide the actual rate of application to the Project
 Manager. Immediately reapply the curing compound over any control joints that were cut
 through previously applied coatings of curing compound.
 If rain falls on freshly applied curing compound before it has dried enough to resist
 damage, or if the surface is otherwise damaged, apply an additional coat of curing compound.
 Protect the applied curing compound areas from automobile and pedestrian traffic for at
 least 7 Calendar Days, or the concrete has achieved an in-place compressive strength of 3000
 psi, as determined by the Maturity Method.
 450.3.6.2
 
 Use of Sheeting Materials
 
 Section 450:
 
 Portland Cement Concrete Pavement (QLA)
 
 Page 238
 
 When chosen, place sheeting Materials over the pavement immediately after completing
 finishing operations.
 Place the sheeting so that individual sheets overlap at least 24 inches. Weigh down the
 overlapped areas with earth or boards to prevent movement by the wind. Extend the sheeting
 to completely cover the edges of the pavement, and the surface of the Subgrade to a distance
 of at least 12 inches beyond the edge of the pavement and secure them to the Subgrade with
 a continuous bank of earth or surfacing material.
 Protect sheeting from damage and keep in place for at least 7 Calendar Days or until the
 compressive strength has reached 3000 psi, as determined by the Maturity Method.
 Immediately patch holes in the sheeting.
 450.3.8
 
 Protections from and Opening to Traffic

 CRACKING AND SEATING CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 
 DESCRIPTION
 
 This Work consists of cracking and seating existing portland cement concrete pavement.
 454.2
 
 MATERIALS—Reserved
 
 454.3
 
 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 
 454.3.1
 
 Equipment
 
 Use impact hammers capable of cracking the pavement’s full depth. Equip the breaker
 with a plate-type shoe or use one designed to prevent penetration, spalling, and shattering of
 the existing surface, use other Equipment approved by the Project Manager. Do not use a
 headache, drop ball, or whip hammer.
 If required, provide a screen to protect vehicles in the adjacent lane from flying chips
 during the cracking process.
 Use pneumatic tire rollers that weigh a minimum of 50 ton.
 
 454.3.2 Cracking Operations
 Before cracking the concrete, remove existing asphalt patches. Before cracking, the
 Project Manager will designate test sections. Crack the test sections using varying energy
 and striking patterns to establish an optimum pattern for cracking the pavement. Wet the
 pavement surface test section to determine the extent and pattern of cracking.
 Use the established pattern to crack the pavement on the remainder of the Project,
 provided the cracked pavement continues to meet the specified size requirements. Adjust the
 energy and striking pattern as directed by the Project Manager. Wet pavement surfaces at
 least once an hour to determine the extent and pattern of cracking.
 Crack the existing concrete pavement so that the dimensions of the majority of pieces of
 pavement are from 18 inches to 24 inches, with a maximum dimension of 30 inches. Ensure
 that 80% of pavement pieces are smaller than 24 inch. The Project Manager will determine
 the adequacy of pavement breakage.
 Perform cracking one (1) lane at a time with an impact hammer.
 Prevent damage to underground utilities, drainage facilities, Bridge approach slabs, and
 Bridge decks. Repair damage at no additional cost to the Department.
 454.3.3
 
 Seating Operations
 
 After cracking the concrete pavement, clean the surface of loose and spalled concrete
 and foreign material.
 Roll the cracked concrete with a pneumatic tire roller within 24 h before overlaying with
 HMA until it is well seated and thoroughly and uniformly compacted. Crack slab sections (that
 do not seat well under the roller) into smaller sections and roll them again. The Project
 Manager will determine when the pavement is properly cracked and seated.
 The Department will allow traffic on the cracked pavement before overlaying. When
 routing traffic over the cracked pavement, ensure the pavement’s condition is satisfactory to
 carry the traffic.

 DIAMOND-GRINDING AND DIAMOND-GROOVING OF PORTLAND
 CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENT (PCCP)
 
 DESCRIPTION
 
 This Work consists of diamond-grinding and/or diamond-grooving PCCP, and includes
 the removal of slurry and residue resulting from the Work.
 Diamond grinding is a pavement preservation technique that corrects a variety of surface
 imperfections on both concrete and asphalt pavements. The diamond blades used for
 grinding are composed of industrial diamonds and metallurgical powder.
 455.2
 
 MATERIALS—Reserved
 
 455.3
 
 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 
 455.3.1
 
 Equipment
 
 Use power-driven, self-propelled machines equipped with diamond blades specifically
 designed to grind, groove, and texture PCCP. Ensure the grinder has a depth control device
 to detect variations in the concrete surface and adjust the cutting head height to maintain the
 depth of the specified groove. Equip the diamond grinding machine with alignment control
 devices.
 Ensure the Equipment grinds and grooves the pavement surface to the specified
 smoothness tolerances and textures, without causing excessive raveling of the joints or
 cracking or fracturing of the aggregates.
 455.3.2 Diamond Grinding and Grooving Operations
 Begin and end longitudinal diamond grinding and grooving at lines normal to the
 pavement centerline, unless otherwise specified in the Contract.
 Grind designated areas until the pavement surfaces on both sides of transverse joints
 and cracks are on the same plane. Ensure that diamond grinding produces a uniform finished
 surface, eliminates joint or crack faults, and provides positive lateral surface drainage by
 maintaining a constant cross-slope within the diamond grinding limits of each lane.
 Grind auxiliary or ramp lane transitions from the mainline edge to provide positive
 drainage and an acceptable riding surface.
 Make grooving patterns in accordance with Section 512.3.10.3, “Grooving of Hardened
 Concrete,” unless otherwise specified in the Contract.
 455.3.3
 
 Slurry Removal
 
 Continuously remove the slurry from the Work.
 Do not allow the slurry to flow across lanes open to traffic or into gutters or other drainage
 facilities.
 455.3.4
 
 Final Surface Finish
 
 Produce a pavement surface in accordance with Section 450.3.5.2, “Surfacing
 Smoothness Requirements.”
 Ensure the texture has parallel longitudinal corrugations that present a narrow ridge
 corduroy-type appearance. Make the peaks and grooves approximately 0.08 inch apart in
 elevation. Make the grooves from 0.08 inch to 0.16 inch wide, and the peaks from 0.08 inch to
 0.12 inch wide. Determine the appropriate number of grooves per yard to produce the
 specified surface requirements.

 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 
 501.3.1
 
 Equipment
 
 501.3.1.1
 
 Pile Hammers
 
 Use steam, air, diesel, or hydraulic hammers for driving piles. Only use gravity hammers
 where specified for use in dynamic testing of drilled shafts.
 501.3.1.1.1
 
 Steam and Air Hammers
 
 Provide the plant and Equipment with pressure gages that are easily accessible to the
 Inspector. Use air and steam hammers with striking parts that weigh at least 1/3 the weight of
 drive head and pile or 2,750 lb, whichever is more.
 501.3.1.1.2
 
 Diesel Hammers
 
 Use open-end diesel hammers that allow the Inspector to see the hammer stroke during
 pile driving operations, unless accompanied by a saximeter stroke measurement device.
 Use closed-end diesel hammers equipped with a bounce chamber pressure gauge,
 mounted with a hose long enough for the Inspector to read.
 501.3.1.1.3
 
 Hydraulic Hammers
 
 Use hydraulic hammers equipped with a digital display of delivered hammer energy for
 each stroke. Provide certification of hammer energy measurement read-out to the Project
 Manager.
 501.3.1.2
 501.3.1.2.1
 
 Driving Apparatus
 Hammer Cushion
 
 Equip impact pile driving Equipment (except gravity and hydraulic hammers) with
 hammer cushion material to prevent damage to the hammer or pile and to ensure uniform
 driving. Use hammer cushions made in accordance with the hammer manufacturer’s
 guidelines. Do not use wood, wire rope, or asbestos hammer cushions. Place a
 manufacturer-recommended striker plate on the hammer cushion to ensure uniform
 compression of the cushion material.
 501.3.1.2.2
 
 Drive Head
 
 Equip impact hammer driven piles with a steel drive head to distribute the hammer blow.
 Align the drive head axially with the hammer and the pile. Ensure that it is guided by leads
 and not free-swinging.
 Use a drive head that fits around the pile head to maintain the proper alignment of the
 hammer and pile and not transfer the torsional forces during driving. Cut pile heads squarely.
 Provide a drive head insert to fit the pile type and dimensions, as recommended by the
 hammer manufacturer.
 For pre-cast concrete and pre-stressed concrete piles, use a pile head that is
 perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pile to prevent eccentric impacts.
 501.3.1.2.3
 
 Pile Cushion
 
 Before driving, place a plywood pile cushion that is at least four (4) inches thick on the
 pile head. Greater thicknesses may be required if the Wave Equation Analysis (per Section
 501.3.2.1.1, “Wave Equation Analysis”) or dynamic testing (per Section 501.3.2.1.2, “Dynamic
 Formula”) determines that the pile compressive or tensile stresses are unacceptable.
 Section 501:
 
 Driven Bearing Piles
 
 Page 255
 
 501.3.1.2.4
 
 Leads
 
 While being driven, support piles in line and position with leads. Construct pile driver
 leads to allow the hammer free movement while maintaining alignment of the hammer and the
 pile to ensure concentric impacts.
 Do not extend the pile section being driven above the leads. Embed the leads in the
 ground or restrain by a rigid brace to maintain alignment. Ensure that the leads are long
 enough to make a follower unnecessary, and design the leads to permit alignment of batter
 piles.
 Use fixed or swinging leads. Fit swinging leads with a pile gate at the bottom. For batter
 piles, use a horizontal brace between the crane and the leads.
 501.3.1.2.5
 
 Pile Extensions
 
 Do not use followers. Where required and approved by the Foundation Engineer, use an
 extra length pile with splices (if necessary) and ensure that the leads are of adequate length
 so that followers will not be required. After cut-off, undamaged extra length pile may be reused as a production pile.
 501.3.1.2.6
 
 Templates
 
 Use securely anchored heavy metal templates to maintain pile positions when driving a
 pile bent.
 501.3.1.2.7
 
 Pre-Boring Equipment
 
 Use pre-boring Equipment in accordance with Section 501.3.3.2, “Pre-Boring.”
 501.3.1.2.8
 
 Inspection Equipment
 
 Provide and use Equipment to illuminate the entire interior length of pipe piles after they
 are driven.
 501.3.1.3
 
 Minimum Manufacturer’s-Rated Hammer Energy
 
 Unless the Contract specifies a minimum hammer energy, use a manufacturer-rated
 hammer at or above the appropriate minimum energy level corresponding to the required
 nominal pile capacity in accordance with Table 501.3.1.3:1, “Required Hammer Energy.”

 Approval of Driving System
 
 The Foundation Engineer will approve the driving system. The driving system includes
 the hammer and driving apparatus proposed on the Department’s Pile and Driving Equipment
 Data Form. Transporting the driving system to the Project site before it is approved will be
 done at the Contractor’s risk.
 The driving system will be approved based on the following:
 1.
 
 The driving system meets the requirements of Sections 501.3.1.1, “Pile Hammers,”
 and 501.3.1.2, “Driving Apparatus;”
 
 2.
 
 The manufacturer’s rated hammer energy meets or exceeds the minimum hammer
 energy requirements established in Section 501.3.1.3, “Minimum Manufacturer’sRated Hammer Energy;”
 
 3.
 
 The Wave Equation Analysis indicates that the expected driving resistance (required
 nominal capacity) can be achieved at less than ten (10) blows per inch;
 
 4.
 
 The Wave Equation Analysis indicates that the pile stresses will not exceed the
 allowable stresses at the expected driving resistance (required ultimate capacity) as
 indicated in Table 501.3.1.4:1, “Wave Equation Analysis Allowable Driving Stress;”
 
 5.
 
 When dynamic tests are specified in accordance with Section 504, “Load Testing of
 Bearing Piles,” Acceptance of the hammer system will be based on the measured
 energy transfer efficiency in accordance with Section 501.3.4, “Variations of
 Approved Driving Systems.”

 Driven Pile Capacity
 
 Section 501:
 
 Driven Bearing Piles
 
 Page 257
 
 The nominal pile capacity will generally be the required factored design resistance of the
 pile divided by the specified AASHTO LRFD resistance factor, unless specified otherwise.
 The specified AASHTO resistance factor depends on the specified pile testing and the
 specified method for monitoring the pile capacity. Determine resistance factors in accordance
 with Table 501.3.2:1, “LRFD Resistance Factors for Driven Piles,” unless otherwise specified.

 Determination of Pile Capacity with Impact Hammer
 
 501.3.2.1.1
 
 Wave Equation Analysis
 
 The Foundation Engineer will determine the nominal pile capacity based on a Wave
 Equation Analysis.
 Drive piles to the required resistance based on the operating energy of the hammer. The
 Pile Driving Acceptance Chart will indicate the resistance criteria.
 Obtain pile penetration by achieving the Wave Equation resistance criteria in accordance
 with Section 501.3.5.2, “Minimum Penetration Elevation,” and Section 501.3.5.3, “Estimated
 Penetration Elevation.” If the predicted pile penetration varies from the Plan length by ± 25%
 or more, the Foundation Engineer will perform a revised Wave Equation Analysis in
 accordance with Section 501.3.4.2, “Revised Wave Equation Analysis.”
 501.3.2.1.2
 
 Dynamic Formula
 
 Use the dynamic formula to determine nominal pile capacity only if specified or approved
 by the Foundation Engineer. Drive piles to the depth necessary to obtain the nominal pile
 capacity according to the following equation and in accordance with Section 501.3.5.2,
 “Minimum Penetration Elevation”:

 Preparation for Driving
 
 501.3.3.1
 
 Abutment Piles
 
 Unless otherwise shown, and before driving the abutment bearing piles, place and
 compact the approach Embankment Material underneath and adjacent to the abutment to the
 required density. After compaction, ensure that the surface of the approach Embankment is
 not lower than the elevation of the bottom of the abutment.
 501.3.3.2
 
 Pre-Boring
 
 If specified, pre-bore holes at pile locations to the depths and size in accordance with the
 Plans. If the Contract does not specify pre-bored, but the Foundation Engineer approves the
 use of pre-bored holes, drill the holes to the depth established by the Foundation Engineer.
 Ensure that the depth permits the piles to be driven to the minimum penetration elevation and
 required bearing capacity without overstress or damage to the piles. Pre-bore holes in the
 presence of the Inspector. After placing pile, fill voids remaining around the pile with sand or
 other approved material.
 501.3.3.2.1
 
 Application of Pre-Bored Holes
 
 Only use pre-bored holes as specified, or when demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
 Foundation Engineer that a pile cannot be driven to the minimum penetration elevation in
 accordance with Section 501.3.5.2, “Minimum Penetration Elevation.”
 The Department will determine the need for pre-bored pile holes based on the following
 driving resistances:
 1.
 
 Steel piles: when, in ten (10) blows, the set is less than 3/4 inch with the hammer
 delivering the minimum energy required;
 
 2.
 
 Pre-cast concrete piles: when, in ten (10) blows, the set is less than one (1) inch
 with the hammer delivering the minimum energy as required in the Contract;
 
 3.
 
 All piles: if the resistance is sufficient to overstress the pile as indicated by the Wave
 Equation Analysis Field Acceptance Chart for the approved hammer system.
 
 501.3.3.2.2
 
 Diameter of Pre-bored Holes
 
 The Foundation Engineer will establish the diameter of pre-bored holes. In general, the
 diameter established will be as shown in Table 501.3.3.2.5:1, “Diameter of Pre-Bored Holes in
 Soil,” or Table 501.3.3.2.5:2, “Diameter of Pre-Bored Holes in Rock, Shale, or Conglomerate.”
 501.3.3.2.3
 
 Obstructions
 
 If the Contractor encounters subsurface obstructions, the Contractor may increase the
 borehole diameter to the smallest dimension adequate for pile installation. Penetrate
 obstructions in accordance with Section 502.3.4.2.2, “Obstructions.”
 501.3.3.2.4
 
 Rock Sockets
 
 If the Contract requires the Contractor to drive a pile in a rock socket and the bore hole is
 larger than the diameter of the pile, fill around that part of the pile in solid material with Class G
 concrete. Place concrete in accordance with Section 502.3, “Construction Requirements.” Fill
 the part of the pile above the rock socket with sand or other suitable material.
 501.3.3.2.5
 
 Temporary Casing
 
 Temporary casing may be required if the soil sloughs or caves into the hole or if a hole is
 required to be kept dry from groundwater, such as socketed holes into shale. Increase the
 diameter of the drilled hole as necessary to place the temporary casing. Pull the casing after
 driving the pile and after the hole is backfilled with the appropriate Material.

 Pile and Hammer Cushion Preparation
 
 Before the drive head is attached, make the pile heads plane and perpendicular to the
 longitudinal axis of the pile. Protect pre-cast concrete pile heads with a pile cushion in
 accordance with Section 501.3.1.2.3, “Pile Cushion.” Provide a new pile cushion for each precast concrete pile. Replace the pile cushion if it is either compressed more than one-half of
 the original thickness or begins to burn during driving.
 Inspect the hammer cushion with the Inspector present when beginning pile driving at
 each Structure or after each 100 h of pile driving, whichever is less. If the hammer cushion
 thickness is reduced by more than 25% of the original thickness, replace the cushion before
 proceeding with driving.
 501.3.3.4
 
 Conditions to Proceed
 
 The Contractor shall not drive production piles until it meets the following conditions:
 1.
 
 The Foundation Engineer approves the driving system in accordance with
 Section 501.3.1.4, “Approval of Driving System;”
 
 2.
 
 The Inspector completes the Pile Driving Field Inspection Form and the form is then
 approved by the Project Manager;
 
 3.
 
 All required load testing is complete as specified and in accordance with
 Section 504, “Load Testing of Bearing Piles;”
 
 4.
 
 The Pile Driving Acceptance Chart is completed and stamped with New Mexico P.E.
 seal by the Foundation Engineer and approved by the State Geotechnical Engineer
 and submitted to the Project Manager;
 
 5.
 
 The hammer and leads are aligned with the pile plan in vertical or battered position;
 and
 
 6.
 
 The Inspector is present before beginning operations.
 
 501.3.4
 
 Variations of Approved Driving Systems
 
 Only use the approved pile driving system. Submit a new Pile and Driving Equipment
 Data Form to the Project Manager for variations to the approved driving system. The Project
 Manager will notify the Contractor of Acceptance or rejection within 72 h of the receipt of the
 data form. The time required for submission, review, and approval of a variation in the driving
 system will not constitute a basis for a Contract Time extension.
 501.3.4.1 Variations Due to Dynamic Testing
 The Foundation Engineer will reject the hammer if the hammer is unable to transfer
 sufficient energy to perform the dynamic testing in accordance with Section 504, “Load Testing
 Section 501:
 
 Driven Bearing Piles
 
 Page 260
 
 of Bearing Piles.”
 Reasons for rejection include pre-ignition from overheating or
 malfunctioning of the injection system and poor hammer or capblock maintenance. After
 rejection, repair or replace the hammer.
 501.3.4.2
 
 Revised Wave Equation Analysis
 
 The Department will perform a revised Wave Equation Analysis to establish revised
 driving resistance criteria when the following conditions occur:
 1.
 
 Variations in the driving system;
 
 2.
 
 Pre-boring not originally specified in the Contract is used to facilitate pile
 penetration; or
 
 3.
 
 The pile penetrations are considerably more or less than that estimated in the
 Contract.
 
 Do not drive piles until the Project Manager receives the revised Pile Acceptance Chart.
 501.3.5 Pile Driving Operations
 Approval of a pile hammer relative to allowable driving stresses will not relieve the
 Contractor of responsibility for damaged piles for the following reasons:
 1.
 
 Misalignment of the leads;
 
 2.
 
 Failure of capblock or cushion material;
 
 3.
 
 Failure of splices;
 
 4.
 
 Malfunctioning of the pile hammer; or
 
 5.
 
 Other improper construction methods.
 
 If the Foundation Engineer determines that damage caused by one (1) of the above
 reasons impairs the pile strength, or questions the measured resistance, replace the piles at
 no additional cost to the Department.
 Schedule pile driving to prevent vibrations and pressure from damaging piles or other inplace concrete structural components that have reached their initial set, but that do not have
 sufficient strength to resist damage.
 Replace the hammer cushion and pile cushion when necessary in accordance with
 Section 501.3.3.3, “Pile and Hammer Cushion Preparation,” to avoid excessive compression
 or damage.
 501.3.5.1
 
 Pile Measurement and Recording
 
 Ensure that the first pile driven at each Substructure element is accessible so the
 Inspector can measure and mark the pile in 12-inch increments. On the first pile driven, the
 Inspector will record blows per 12 inches of penetration until the pile tip is within five (5) ft of
 the specified penetration elevation or until the pile begins to set up, whichever comes first.
 Then, the Inspector will measure and record the penetration in inches per ten (10) or 20 blows,
 as directed by the Foundation Engineer, until the Contractor achieves the specified set.
 501.3.5.2
 
 Minimum Penetration Elevation
 
 If the Contract specifies a “Minimum Penetration Elevation” and the driven piles do not
 develop the required nominal bearing capacity at that elevation, the Contractor shall continue
 driving the piles until the required resistance is obtained. If the piles develop a set, determined
 in accordance with Section 501.3.3.2.3, “Application of Pre-Bored Holes,” before the pile tip
 reaches the minimum penetration elevation, the Contractor shall perform drilling to prevent
 damaging the pile while driving to the minimum penetration elevation.
 501.3.5.3
 Section 501:
 
 Estimated Penetration Elevation
 Driven Bearing Piles
 
 Page 261
 
 If the Contract specifies an estimated penetration elevation, drive the piles to the required
 nominal capacity. If the piles attain the required resistance above the estimated penetration
 elevation, terminate driving and the Department will accept the piles at the shallower
 penetration.
 501.3.5.4
 
 Pile Groups
 
 If driving multiple rows of piles for pile cap foundations, drive the piles to the estimated or
 minimum penetration elevation, before determining pile capacity for Acceptance. After driving
 the piles in the group to the required tip elevation, re-strike to determine the pile nominal
 capacity. If the piles do not develop the required nominal bearing capacity at that elevation,
 continue to drive until the required resistance is attained.
 501.3.5.5
 
 Splices
 
 Ensure that steel pile splices are in accordance with Section 541, “Steel Structures.”
 Make splices for closed-end pipe piles watertight.
 Use the cement dowel method to make splices for pre-cast concrete piles unless the
 Foundation Engineer approves an alternate splice detail. Select mechanical splices for
 concrete or steel piles from the Department’s Approved Products List.
 501.3.5.6
 
 Cut-Off Lengths
 
 Cut off the tops of all permanent piles at the elevation shown or as directed. Remove the
 cut off lengths from the Project.
 501.3.5.7
 
 Filling Closed-End Pipe Piles
 
 After driving closed-end steel-pipe piles, inspect for water or other Deleterious Material
 inside the piles. Remove water and foreign substances from inside the piles. After the Project
 Manager approves the piles, fill them with Class A (any risk zone) concrete with a 4 1/2 inch to
 eight (8) inch slump. Provide a superplasticizer in accordance with 510.3.4.4 from the
 Department’s Approved Products List to achieve the slump. Place the concrete in accordance
 with Section 502.3.4.4, “Concrete Placement.”
 501.3.5.8
 
 Filling Open-End Pipe Piles
 
 After driving open-end steel pipe piles, inspect for water inside the piles. If water is
 present, place pea gravel in the pile to an elevation of three (3) feet above the water level. If
 the Project Manager approves the piles, fill them with Class A (any risk zone) concrete with a
 4 ½ inch to six (6) inch slump. , Provide a superplasticizer in accordance with 510.3.4.4 from
 the Department’s Approved Products List to achieve the slump. Place the concrete in at least
 the upper ten (10) ft of the piles in accordance with Section 502.3.4.4, “Concrete Placement.”
 501.3.6
 
 Pile Acceptance
 
 501.3.6.1
 
 Pile Load Capacity and Penetration
 
 Drive piles to the required nominal capacity as determined by the specified capacity
 monitoring method in accordance with Section 501.3.2, “Driven Pile Capacity.”
 If specified, install piles to the penetration elevation in accordance with Section 501.3.5.2,
 “Minimum Penetration Elevation.”
 501.3.6.2
 
 Location and Alignment Tolerances
 
 Do not pull laterally on piles to correct misalignment or splice a properly aligned section
 on a misaligned section to meet tolerances.
 501.3.6.2.1
 Section 501:
 
 Trestle and Abutment Beam Piling
 Driven Bearing Piles
 
 Page 262

 and weak axis of the pile shown.
 501.3.6.2.5
 
 Pile Tops
 
 Cut off the tops of piles perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pile or to a specified bevel,
 and within the specified tolerance.
 501.3.6.3
 
 Damaged Pile Limitations
 
 The Department will reject damaged piles based on the following criteria:
 1.
 
 Piles that are broken, cracked, or split;
 
 2.
 
 Pre-cast concrete piles that show signs of crushing and spalling of the concrete,
 splitting, or visible cracks that affect the strength or service life of the pile;
 
 3.
 
 Steel piles bent or deformed during installation and exceed mill tolerances for sweep
 and camber; or
 
 4.
 
 Closed-end pipe piles that show evidence of groundwater infiltration, or breaks or
 deformation that would impair the strength of the completed piles.
 
 501.3.6.4
 
 Correcting Rejected Piles
 
 Correct piles damaged during driving because of internal defects or improper driving with
 methods approved by the Project Manager, at no additional cost to the Department.
 If the Contractor exceeds the location or alignment tolerances, and the Foundation
 Engineer determines that corrective measures are necessary, the Contractor shall design and
 construct corrective measures at no additional cost to the Department.
 The State
 Geotechnical Engineer will approve the design.
 Corrective methods may include the following:
 1.
 
 Removing and replacing the pile with a new, and when necessary, longer pile;
 
 2.
 
 Driving additional piles next to the defective piles; or
 
 3.
 
 Extending the footing to properly embed the pile.
 
 501.4
 501.4.1
 
 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 Pile Extensions
 
 The Project Manager will include any approved extension lengths in the pile
 measurement.
 Section 501:
 
 Driven Bearing Piles
 
 Page 263
 
 501.4.2
 
 Driven Piles
 
 The Department will measure Driven Piles below the cut-off elevation to the nearest foot.
 501.4.3 Pile Cut-Offs
 The Department will calculate Pile Cut-Offs to the nearest foot by subtracting the total
 lengths of the in-place piles (after cut-off) from the total Plan lengths.
 501.4.4
 
 Pre-bored Holes for Bearing Piles
 
 The Department will only measure that portion of Pre-Bored Holes for Bearing Piles
 below the Plan grade elevation. The Department will not measure that portion of pre-bored
 holes drilled through soil or rock layers (overburden) that the Contractor later excavates.
 501.4.5
 
 Pile Splices
 
 The Department will measure Pile Splices required for piles driven deeper than the
 estimated penetration elevation to achieve the required nominal capacity. The Department will
 only measure up to two (2) splices per pile in order to drive the piles beyond the specified
 penetration elevation to meet the required resistance.

 Page 265
 
 may use casings larger than specified, at no additional cost to the Department.
 502.3
 
 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 
 502.3.1
 
 Equipment
 
 502.3.1.1
 
 Excavation and Drilling Equipment
 
 Use excavation and drilling Equipment that can excavate a hole of the specified diameter
 20% deeper than what is shown in the Contract. Use excavation Equipment that can
 complete a flat shaft bottom. Ensure that the cutting edges are normal to the vertical axis of
 the Equipment within a tolerance of 0.25 in per foot of diameter. Ensure that under-reaming
 tools do not allow the base diameter to exceed three (3) times the specified shaft diameter.
 The Foundation Engineer may approve a change in other under-reaming Plan dimensions to
 accommodate the Equipment. When the Foundation Engineer requires over-reaming of the
 shaft sidewall, use an over-reaming bucket, grooving tool, or other approved Equipment. Use
 an over-reaming tool that over sizes the shaft diameter from 0.5 inch to three (3) inch. If the
 Contractor cannot drill the material with conventional earth augers, the Contractor shall use
 special drilling Equipment, such as core barrels, rock tools and other Equipment, as
 necessary. Blasting is not allowed.
 502.3.1.2
 
 Slurry Equipment
 
 Use desanding Equipment to keep the slurry sand content to less than eight percent (8%)
 by volume for mineral slurry and less than one percent (1%) by volume for polymer slurry.
 This is required during shaft excavation to maintain mix consistency of the slurry in the shaft.
 Use slurry tanks for slurry circulation, storage, and treatment. Do not use excavated slurry pits
 in place of slurry tanks without the written permission of the Project Manager. Use a slurrysampling tool to conduct the slurry control tests in accordance with Section 502.3.4.1.3.3,
 “Slurry Control Tests.” Use a slurry sampler capable of sampling slurry from the bottom of the
 hole and withdrawing the sample without loss or contamination of sample fluid.
 502.3.1.3
 
 Concrete Placement Equipment
 
 Depending on the type of shaft construction, place the concrete in the excavated shaft
 with a rigid tremie pipe, a concrete pump line, or a drop chute.
 502.3.1.3.1
 
 Tremies
 
 Use a rigid tremie pipe that can deposit concrete at the shaft bottom. Do not use a tremie
 with aluminum parts that will have contact with the concrete. Ensure the inside diameter is at
 least ten (10) inch. Ensure the tremie’s inside and outside surfaces are clean and smooth.
 Ensure that the tremie is watertight. In slurry displacement shafts use a plug initially placed at
 the top of the tremie to separate the concrete from the displacement fluid until the concrete is
 flowing through the orifice. Ensure that plugs left in the shaft concrete are made of material
 approved by the Project Manager. Construct the discharge end of the tremie to permit the free
 radial flow of concrete during placement operations.
 502.3.1.3.2
 
 Concrete Pumps and Lines
 
 Use watertight pump lines with a diameter of at least five (5) inch. Use schedule-40 steel
 pipe or heavier. Use plugs in accordance with Section 502.3.1.3.1, “Tremies.”
 502.3.1.3.3
 
 Drop Chutes
 
 Use rigid-pipe drop chutes that are either one-piece or sectional. Ensure they can be
 added and removed from a metal hopper. Do not use flexible trunk line hose.
 502.3.2
 
 Submittals
 
 Provide the required drilled shaft submittals to the Project Manager for the State
 Section 502:
 
 Drilled Shafts
 
 Page 266
 
 Geotechnical Engineer’s review and approval. The Contractor may use documented Work
 experience (per Section 502.3.2.1, “Work Experience”) and proposed construction procedure
 submittals (per Section 502.3.2.2, “Proposed Construction Procedure”) approved on previous
 Department Projects of similar size, difficulty, and geology, in lieu of the detailed submittal
 requirements listed below.
 502.3.2.1
 
 Work Experience
 
 Submit documentation verifying the required Work experience in accordance with
 Section 502.1.1, “Work Experience.” Include the names and phone numbers of references
 that can verify successful completion of the listed Projects.

 Details for placing reinforcement including support and centralization methods; and
 
 9.
 
 Details for placing concrete including operational procedures for free fall, tremie or
 pumping methods.
 
 502.3.2.3
 
 Review and Approval
 
 The State Geotechnical Engineer will evaluate the proposed construction procedure and
 will notify the Contractor if additional information is required and changes are necessary within
 14 Days after receiving the proposed construction procedure. Administrative approvals are
 subject to field verification of performance.
 502.3.3 Construction Preparations
 502.3.3.1
 
 Site and Subsurface Conditions
 
 The Department’s test results and rock core samples are available for examination upon
 request.
 502.3.3.2
 
 Protection of Existing Structures
 
 If specified, submit a preventative-measures plan to the Project Manager, at least
 14 Days before the construction of the shaft.
 502.3.3.3
 
 Site Preparation
 
 If footings are present, excavate to the footings' bottom elevation before beginning shaft
 construction, unless the Contract or Project Manager allows otherwise. If the Contractor drills
 shafts in conjunction with placing Embankment, drill the shafts after placing the fill, unless the
 Contract or Project Manager allows otherwise.
 502.3.3.4
 
 Proof Drilled Shafts
 
 Construct a proof drilled shaft, when specified, at the location shown in the Contract.
 Section 502:
 
 Drilled Shafts
 
 Page 267
 
 Construct the shaft after the State Geotechnical Engineer approves the Equipment and
 methods. If specified in the Contract, load test the proof shaft in accordance with the Contract
 and Section 504, “Load Testing of Bearing Piles.” Drill the shaft to the maximum depth of any
 production shaft unless otherwise shown in the Contract. Underream the proof shaft to
 establish the feasibility of under-reaming in a specific soil strata or rock. Fill the proof shaft
 with concrete in the same way as the production shafts. If the methods and Equipment
 produce inadequate results as determined in 502.3.7 Acceptance, the Project Manager will
 require the Contractor to demonstrate acceptable results with another proof shaft. Once the
 proof shaft is approved, construct production shafts using the same means and methods. Do
 not change the means or methods without written approval from the State Geotechnical
 Engineer. Cut off the proof shafts five (5) ft below finished grade and leave in place. Restore
 the proof shaft sites to their original condition.
 502.3.3.5
 
 Safety
 
 Do not allow workers to enter the excavation for any reason.
 502.3.4
 
 Construction of Drilled Shafts
 
 502.3.4.1
 
 Construction Methods
 
 502.3.4.1.1
 
 Dry Construction Method
 
 The State Geotechnical Engineer will approve the dry construction method when the
 following occurs:
 1.
 
 The shaft accumulates less than 12 inches of water above the base over a one
 (1) hr period without pumping;
 
 2.
 
 The shaft remains stable without caving, sloughing or swelling over a four
 (4) hr period immediately following excavation;
 
 3.
 
 The Contractor can remove loose material and water before inspection and concrete
 placement; and
 
 4.
 
 Use of low strength grout collars to stabilize running sands or unstable zones within
 the drilled shaft excavation.
 
 Use the slurry-displacement construction method or the casing construction method for
 shafts that do not meet these requirements.
 The dry method consists of the following:
 1.
 
 Drilling the shaft;
 
 2.
 
 Removing accumulated water and loose material from the excavation;
 
 3.
 
 Approval of bottom hole conditions by Certified Drilled Shaft Inspector;
 
 4.
 
 Placing the reinforcing cage; and
 
 5.
 
 Concreting the shaft.
 
 502.3.4.1.2
 
 Casing Construction Method
 
 Use the casing construction method when called for in the Contract or where the dry
 construction method is inadequate. If necessary, use the casing method combined with the
 slurry displacement or dry construction method. Place the casing by twisting, driving, or
 vibrating into the ground before cleaning it out, unless the Contract requires the Contractor to
 place the casing in a predrilled hole. If the Contractor elects to use casings or shafts larger
 than those specified the Contractor shall provide the concrete necessary to fill the additional
 volume, at no additional cost to the Department.
 502.3.4.1.2.1
 
 Temporary Casing
 
 The Department will consider subsurface casing to be temporary unless shown as
 permanent in the Contract. Remove the temporary casing when placing concrete for the
 Section 502:
 
 Drilled Shafts
 
 Page 268
 
 drilled shaft when the concrete is in a fluid state. If the Contractor removes a casing or
 replaces it with a longer or larger diameter casing through caving soils, the Contractor shall
 stabilize the excavation with slurry before installing the new casing. Other methods to control
 the stability of an excavation require approval of the Foundation Engineer. Before withdrawing
 the casing, ensure that the level of concrete in the casing is at least ten (10) ft above either the
 hydrostatic water level or the drilling fluid level, whichever is higher. Maintain a concrete level
 in the casing as it is removed so that fluid trapped behind it is displaced upward and
 discharged without contaminating or displacing the shaft concrete. Temporary casings that
 become bound or fouled during shaft construction, and cannot be practically removed,
 constitute a defect. Repair defective shafts in accordance with 502.3.8 Correction of Defective
 Drilled Shafts.
 502.3.4.1.2.2
 
 Permanent Casing
 
 Make permanent casing continuous from top to bottom. Cut off the permanent casing at
 the prescribed elevation after installation. Complete the shaft by placing the reinforcing steel
 and concrete in the casing. If using temporary casings in conjunction with permanent casings,
 keep the temporary inner casing aligned with the permanent outer casing. Maintain a
 water-tight seal between the two (2) casings during excavation and concrete placement where
 an oversized hole or temporary casing is approved by the Project Manager. When approved
 by the Foundation Engineer to allow drilling an oversize hole to aid in the placement of the
 permanent casing, post grout the exterior annular space outside of the permanent casing,
 such that the direct contact between casing and the surrounding soil/rock is created.
 502.3.4.1.3
 
 Slurry Displacement Construction Method
 
 Use the slurry displacement method at sites where maintaining a dry excavation is not
 possible. Use a mineral or polymer slurry, or water to maintain stability around the hole's
 perimeter while advancing excavating, placing the reinforcing cage, and placing concrete.
 Displace the slurry during final cleaning of the excavation with a bailing bucket, air lift, or
 submersible pump. Place concrete with a tremie or concrete pump beginning at the shaft
 bottom. During construction, keep the slurry level in the shaft excavation high enough to
 prevent caving and at least five (5) ft above the highest expected piezometric pressure head
 along the depth of the shaft. If not using permanent casings, provide temporary surface
 casings to aid shaft alignment and to prevent sloughing, unless otherwise approved by the
 Foundation Engineer. If the slurry construction method does not produce the necessary
 results, discontinue operations and make corrective modifications to the procedures and
 Equipment.
 502.3.4.1.3.1
 
 Polymer Slurry Requirements
 
 Use polymer slurry that will stabilize the hole and inhibit the influx of ground water. Table
 502.3.4.1.3.1:1, “Polymer Slurry Requirements, Emulsified or Dry Phpa Polymer,” lists
 acceptable ranges of values for slurry viscosity and gel.

 Mineral Slurry Requirements
 
 Use Attapulgite, in lieu of Bentonite, where saline or chemically contaminated
 groundwater occurs. Use mineral slurry with a grain size that remains in suspension and has
 sufficient viscosity and gel characteristics to transport excavated material to the screening
 system. Provide mineral slurry in accordance with Table 502.3.4.1.3.2:1, “Mineral Slurry
 Requirements, Sodium Bentonite or Attapulgite in Fresh Water.”

 “Disposal of Other Materials and Debris.”
 502.3.4.1.3.3
 
 Slurry Control Tests
 
 Perform control tests on the mineral slurry to determine density, viscosity, pH, and sand
 content. Do not place concrete unless the Certified Drilled Shaft Inspector has approved the
 bottom hole test results and after test results show acceptable values. Provide test reports to
 the Project Manager upon completion of each drilled shaft.
 502.3.4.1.3.3.1
 
 Pre-entry Tests
 
 Perform tests to determine viscosity and pH before pumping the slurry into the
 excavation. Take at least two (2) sets of tests during the first 8 h of slurry processing.
 Decrease the testing frequency to one (1) set every eight (8) hours when the results are
 consistent.
 502.3.4.1.3.3.2
 
 Bottom Hole Tests
 
 Test slurry samples taken from the shaft base before placing concrete in any shaft
 excavation. Test until samples produce acceptable values for density, pH, and sand content.
 502.3.4.2
 
 Shaft Excavation
 
 Extend drilled shaft tip elevations when the Foundation Engineer determines that the
 material encountered during excavation is unsuitable. Dispose of Materials from the shaft
 excavation as directed by the Project Manager.
 When using vibrating casing, do not place adjacent casings or excavate shafts until 48 h
 after pour completion of an adjacent shaft, or when concrete from the adjacent shaft pour
 breaks at least 2,000 psi, whichever comes first. This requirement applies to excavating any
 shaft within four (4) shaft diameters of another.
 502.3.4.2.1
 
 Underream and Overream
 
 Use sidewall overreaming when the Foundation Engineer determines the sidewall has:
 softened due to excavation methods; swelled due to concrete placement Delays; or, degraded

 The Foundation Engineer will direct the thickness and
 
 Obstructions
 
 Remove surface and subsurface obstructions. Obstructions may include manmade
 Materials, such as old concrete foundations, or natural Materials, such as boulders or nested
 cobble zones that are not anticipated in the Contract. The Department’s Foundation or
 Geotechnical Report includes the soil boring and rock core information, as well as
 groundwater conditions present at the time of the field investigation. Use this information to
 anticipate conditions. When obstructions are encountered, notify the Department Certified
 Drilled Shaft Inspector as shown in Section 502.4.3, “Obstruction Removal.”
 502.3.4.2.3
 
 Soil Samples and Rock Cores
 
 Take soil samples or rock cores at the locations shown in the Contract or as directed by
 the Foundation Engineer to determine the character of material directly below the bottom shaft
 elevation. Perform soil borings before excavating the shafts. Perform rock cores before
 excavating the shaft from the bottom of an exploration hole at no additional cost to the
 Department. Extract and ship the core samples in accordance with the Department’s Manual
 of Highway Structure Foundation Investigation and Subsurface Exploration. Unless otherwise
 specified in the Contract, begin bore holes or rock cores at the top of the rock socket elevation
 to at least ten (10) ft below the bottom of the drilled shaft excavation. Record the rock quality
 designation, percent recovery, joint orientation and infilling, and joint water from the rock cores
 extracted. After exploration, fill the core holes with grout, slurry, or mortar having a minimum
 compressive strength of 3,000 psi at 28 Days. Deliver the geologist’s field log cards to the
 Project Manager after completing the logs. The Department will not require the Contractor’s
 geotechnical consultant to perform Laboratory testing on soil samples or rock cores unless
 specifically specified in the Contract. The Foundation Engineer will notify the Contractor of the
 final required shaft depth after receiving the geologist’s field log sheets and the lab testing
 results. This notification may take as long as 48 h from the time the Foundation Engineer
 receives the field log sheets or the soil and rock samples test results.
 502.3.4.2.4
 
 Shaft Excavation Inspection
 
 Measure the final shaft depths. Ensure that at least 50% of each shaft base has less
 than 1.0 in of sediment when placing the concrete. Ensure that the sediment depth or debris
 at any place on the shaft base does not exceed 1.5 inches. For dry shafts, ensure that the
 water depth does not exceed three (3) inches before pouring concrete. Inspect slurry
 displacement shafts using the methods that the Foundation Engineer deems appropriate.
 Receive approval of bottom hole conditions from Certified Drilled Shaft Inspector prior to
 continuing with the Work.
 502.3.4.2.4.1
 
 Inspection Procedures
 
 The Project Manager will notify the Contractor which procedures will be used for the shaft
 inspections. Supply Equipment and labor, the Project Manager will need to inspect the shaft.
 Inspection procedures may include:
 1.
 
 Inserting a casing in the shaft excavation temporarily for alignment, cleanliness, and
 dimension checks;
 
 2.
 
 Inserting a rigid rod assembly with several 90° offsets equal to the shaft diameter;
 
 3.
 
 Using Department video Equipment; or
 
 4.
 
 Using a weighted tape and evaluation of results of desanding and density tests for
 slurry displacement excavations.
 
 502.3.4.2.4.2
 
 Remedial Work for Substandard Excavation
 
 If the Foundation Engineer determines that a shaft excavation is substandard, develop,
 propose, and implement corrective measures. Corrective measures may include:
 Section 502:
 
 Drilled Shafts
 
 Page 271
 
 1.
 
 Overdrilling to a larger diameter to permit reinforcing steel placement with the
 required minimum cover;
 
 2.
 
 Overreaming sidewalls of the shaft;
 
 3.
 
 Increasing steel reinforcement bar number and size; or
 
 4.
 
 Enlarging the underream within allowed tolerance.
 
 502.3.4.3
 
 Reinforcing Steel Unit Placement
 
 The reinforcing steel unit consists of longitudinal bars and circular ties or a Structural
 Steel shape. Place the structural shape or the reinforcing steel cage as a unit immediately
 after the Certified Drilled Shaft Inspector approves the shaft excavation and before placing
 concrete. Tie and support the reinforcing steel unit in the shaft so that it remains within
 allowable tolerances given in Section 502.3.5, “Location and Alignment Tolerances.” Use
 concrete spacers or other approved non-corrosive spacing devices at sufficient intervals, near
 the bottom and at maximum intervals of ten (10) ft up the shaft, to ensure concentric spacing
 for the entire reinforcement unit length. Use spacers equal in quality and durability to the
 concrete specified for the shaft. Inspect the bottom of the shaft immediately before placing of
 the cage to ensure that there is no sloughing.
 Check the top elevation of the reinforcement unit before and after placing the concrete. If
 the reinforcement unit is not maintained within the specified tolerances, make corrections. Do
 not construct additional shafts before modifying the reinforcement unit support to the
 satisfaction of the Project Manager. Maintain the reinforcement unit at the proper elevation
 and orientation with an approved support mechanism at the ground surface. Place shaft
 concrete immediately after installing the cage. If more than 24 h elapses between the
 placement of the cage and concrete placement, remove the cage and inspect the shaft for
 sloughing or other damage.
 502.3.4.4
 
 Concrete Placement
 
 Place concrete in accordance with Section 511, “Concrete Structures.” Place concrete
 as soon as possible after placing reinforcing steel.
 Ensure that the time from when the concrete is batched at the plant to placement does
 not exceed 2 h. The Project Manager may approve a longer time period if the concrete
 mixture remains workable and plastic. Use admixtures for the job conditions so the concrete
 remains in a workable plastic state through the approved placement limit.
 502.3.4.4.1
 
 Concrete Placement by Free Fall
 
 Use free fall placement in relatively dry holes where the maximum water depth does not
 exceed three (3) inches. Ensure that free fall-placed concrete falls directly to the base without
 contacting either the rebar cage or hole sidewall. Use a hopper at the top of the shaft or a rigid
 pipe extension from the hopper. Ensure that free fall placement does not exceed 60 ft below
 the bottom of the hopper or the rigid pipe extension. Do not use free fall in slurry displacement
 shafts. If the Project Manager determines that concrete cannot be placed using the free fall
 method, use either a tremie or pumping to accomplish the pour.
 502.3.4.4.2
 
 Concrete Placement with Tremie or by Pumping
 
 Use rigid tremie pipe or concrete pumps for concrete placement in either dry or slurry
 displacement shafts. Place plug within tremie or pump line to ensure concrete does not
 segregate prior to developing concrete pressure head within tremie or pump line and that plug
 does not discharge from tremie or pump line prior to concrete developing continuous flow. Do
 not begin underwater placement before placing the tremie or pump line within one (1) tremie
 or pump line diameter of the shaft base elevation. Remove plugs from the excavation if the
 Project Manager does not specifically approve them to remain in the shaft. Keep the
 discharge end continually immersed at least five (5) ft in concrete after starting the flow of
 concrete. Keep the concrete flow continuous. Maintain the concrete in tremies or pump lines
 continuously at a positive pressure differential to prevent water or slurry intrusion into the shaft
 Section 502:
 
 Drilled Shafts
 
 Page 272
 
 concrete. When lifting pump lines during concrete placement, temporarily reduce the line
 pressure until the orifice has been repositioned at a higher level in the excavation. If at any
 time during the concrete pour, the orifice is removed from the fluid concrete column and
 discharges concrete above the rising concrete level, the Department will consider the shaft
 defective. The Contractor may at its own risk and cost, remove the reinforcing cage and
 concrete to complete the necessary sidewall removal as directed by the Foundation Engineer.
 The Department will base final Acceptance in accordance with Section 502.3.7, “Acceptance.”
 502.3.5
 
 Location and Alignment Tolerances
 
 Adhere to the following construction tolerances unless otherwise stated in the Contract or
 directed by the Project Manager:
 1.
 
 Ensure the drilled shaft and the concentric reinforcement steel unit is within three
 (3) inches of Plan position at the top of the shaft;
 
 2.
 
 Do not vary the vertical alignment of a vertical drilled shaft from the Plan alignment
 by more than 1/4 inch per foot of depth. Do not vary alignment of a battered drilled
 shaft by more than 0.5 inch per foot of depth from the specified batter;
 
 3.
 
 Ensure that the top of the reinforcing steel unit is no more than six (6) inches above
 and no more than three (3) inches below Plan elevation; and
 
 4.
 
 Ensure that the top elevation has a tolerance of +1 inch or −3 inch from the Plan top
 of shaft elevation.
 
 502.3.6
 
 Load Testing
 
 When the Contract includes load testing, complete the testing before construction of
 production shafts, unless otherwise approved by the State Geotechnical Engineer. Allow
 three (3) Working Days after the last load test is completed before receiving tip elevations of
 the production shafts from the State Geotechnical Engineer and proceeding with the
 construction of production shafts. After testing is completed, cut off the test shafts and
 reaction shafts at an elevation of five (5) ft below the finished ground elevation.
 502.3.7
 
 Acceptance
 
 502.3.7.1
 
 Concrete Strength
 
 The Department will accept drilled shafts after the 28-Day compressive strength is
 verified. If the Contractor does not achieve the 28-Day compressive strength, the Department
 may completely reject the shafts or accept them in place in accordance with
 subsection 510.3.5.5, “Price Adjustments.”
 502.3.7.2
 
 Location and Alignment Tolerances
 
 The Department will accept drilled shafts if the construction tolerances are satisfied in
 accordance with Section 502.3.5, “Location and Alignment Tolerances.” If the shafts exceed
 the location or alignment tolerances, the Department will reject the shafts. If the State
 Geotechnical Engineer determines that the extent of overloading is not detrimental to the
 performance of the shaft, the Department will accept the shaft.
 502.3.7.3
 
 Shaft Integrity
 
 If applicable, the Department will accept shafts when the pile integrity testing reports
 verify the structural integrity of the piles. The Department may reject a shaft if integrity testing
 shows conclusive evidence that a defect exists in the shaft that may result in inadequate or
 unsafe performance under service loads. If the report is inconclusive, the State Geotechnical
 Engineer may require the Contractor to drill a core hole in the shaft. If the core hole confirms
 the defect, the Department will not pay the coring costs. If the core hole does not find a
 defect, the Department will pay for coring costs, including pressure grouting.
 502.3.8
 
 Correction of Defective Drilled Shafts

 Testing Requirements
 
 504.3.4.1
 
 Dynamic Pile Testing Requirements
 
 Perform dynamic testing during the pile driving as described in the Contract as “Dynamic
 Test Piles.” The State Geotechnical Engineer may decide to designate additional piles shown
 in the Contract as dynamic test piles.
 504.3.4.1.1
 
 Notification to Proceed
 
 Notify the Project Manager at least 21 Days before commencing dynamic test pile testing.
 Confirm the testing schedule with the Project Manager 3 Days before the testing date. Notify
 the Project Manager promptly of any changes in the schedule. Test dynamic test piles before
 any other piles are driven or installed, unless the Project Manager approves otherwise.
 504.3.4.1.2
 
 Preparation for Testing
 
 Prepare dynamic test piles as follows:
 1.
 
 Drilling for Mounting Transducers.  Drill holes for mounting the transducers.
 Bolt the instruments near the head of the pile at the location and using a bolt pattern
 designated by the State Geotechnical Engineer.
 Drilling requirements for each test pile include the following:
 1.1. Steel pipe piles: Seven (7) holes drilled with a 7/32 inch diameter bit, tapped to
 accommodate ¼ in bolts;
 1.2. Steel HP piles: Five (5) holes drilled with a 5/16 inch diameter bit through the
 
 Section 504:
 
 Load Testing of Bearing Piles
 
 Page 278
 
 web;
 1.3. Precast concrete or cast-in-place concrete piles: Seven (7) ¼ inch x 1 ½ inch
 holes with ¼ inch expandable anchor studs set in the holes to accommodate
 ¼ inch bolts;
 2.
 
 Wave Speed Measurements.  When precast concrete piles are specified as
 dynamic test piles, place the pile horizontally on wooden sleepers so that it is not in
 contact with the ground or with other piling. The State Geotechnical Engineer will
 take wave speed measurements for the Pile Driving Analyzer (PDA) by hitting the
 pile with a six (6) lb rubber mallet hammer.
 The Department will not require wave speed measurements for steel piles;
 
 3.
 
 Transducer Installation.  Install the instruments while the pile is in the leads
 using a man-lift raised to the top of the pile.
 As an alternative to the man-lift requirement, the State Geotechnical Engineer may
 install the instruments after the pile is driven to a tip elevation of ten (10) ft above
 the Plan tip elevation.
 
 504.3.4.1.3
 
 Procedure for Testing Driven Piles
 
 The following are the procedures for testing driven piles:
 1.
 
 Drive the test pile in accordance with Section 501.3.5, “Pile Driving Operations,”
 while the State Geotechnical Engineer monitors the dynamic measurements;
 
 2.
 
 Monitor the test pile stresses that result from the driving to ensure that the
 compressive or tensile stresses do not exceed the allowable driving stresses as
 defined in Table 501.3.1.4:1, “Wave Equation Analysis Allowable Driving Stress.” If
 the monitored pile stresses exceed these criteria, stop driving. Perform necessary
 modifications to the driving operation to ensure that pile damage does not occur;
 
 3.
 
 Monitor the test pile stresses on individual gauges to determine if non-axial driving is
 indicated. If the pile bends beyond acceptable allowances, stop driving and realign
 the driving system;
 
 4.
 
 If the Contract specifies an estimated penetration elevation, drive the first dynamic
 test pile until the required ultimate capacity or the estimated penetration elevation is
 achieved;
 If the Contract specifies a minimum penetration elevation, drive the first dynamic
 test pile to that elevation;
 If the test pile does not achieve the required ultimate capacity at the estimated or
 minimum penetration elevation, splice the test pile with additional length of pile.
 Remove and relocate the instruments to the spliced section. Proceed with driving
 until the ultimate driving capacity is achieved;
 
 5.
 
 Forty-eight hours after the initial drive, restrike each test pile previously driven with
 the dynamic measuring Equipment installed. The State Geotechnical Engineer may
 allow shorter wait periods depending on soil and test conditions. Alternatively, the
 Contract may require longer wait periods, multiple restrike intervals, or both on a
 given test pile. Use a “warm” hammer that has previously driven at least one (1) pile
 other than the test pile(s), to restrike the test pile(s). The maximum total number of
 hammer blows for the restrike is 40.
 
 504.3.4.1.4
 
 Procedure for Testing Cast-in-Place Piles
 
 The following are the procedures for testing cast-in-place piles:
 1.
 
 When the Contractor casts the dynamic test pile(s), the Inspector will make three (3)
 test cylinders of concrete or grout for each test pile in accordance with
 AASHTO T 23M.
 
 Provide concrete that will achieve a compressive strength at seven (7) Days of
 3,000 psi;
 2.
 Section 504:
 
 After seven (7) Days, weigh the three (3) concrete test cylinders and report the
 average unit weight to the State Geotechnical Engineer.
 Load Testing of Bearing Piles
 
 Page 279
 
 Test one (1) concrete cylinder at seven (7) Days. If the compressive strength is at
 least 3,000 psi, test the other two (2) cylinders. Report the average of the three (3)
 breaks to the State Geotechnical Engineer.
 Perform the dynamic test on the test pile the same Day that the cylinders are
 broken;
 3.
 
 If the first test cylinder breaks at less than 3,000 psi, report the result to the State
 Geotechnical Engineer. The State Geotechnical Engineer may decide either to
 have the last two (2) cylinders tested the same Day or to wait up to a maximum of
 14 additional Days before breaking the last two (2) cylinders. The Day the last two
 (2) cylinders are tested, re-weigh the cylinders and determine the average unit
 weight of the concrete.
 Perform the dynamic test on the test pile the same Day the last two (2) cylinders are
 broken;
 There will be no added compensation to the Contractor and no time extension to the
 Contract if Delays occur because the concrete does not achieve the required
 strength at seven (7) Days.
 
 4.
 
 Use the average compressive strength and the average unit weight of the concrete
 to estimate the modulus of elasticity and the wave speed of the concrete for input
 into the PDA;
 
 5.
 
 Perform excavation around the test pile as needed to mount the gauges. Typically,
 the required depth of excavation will be twice the diameter of the pile;
 
 6.
 
 Attach the instruments to the pile head and impact the pile with the ram at the free
 fall height directed by the State Geotechnical Engineer. Each test pile will not
 require more than 40 blows.
 Monitor the pile stresses that result from the ram impact to ensure that the
 compressive or tensile stresses do not exceed the allowable pile driving stresses
 defined in Table 501.3.1.4:1, “Wave Equation Analysis Allowable Driving Stress.” If
 the monitored pile stresses exceed these criteria, the Department will direct the
 Contractor to reduce the ram free fall height or add pile cushioning.
 
 504.3.4.1.5
 
 Case Pile Wave Analysis
 
 After re-striking a dynamic test pile, the State Geotechnical Engineer may phone an
 approved firm and transmit a record of a representative blow from the dynamic test pile.
 The firm must have proven experience using the Case Pile Wave Analysis Program
 model and be capable of returning analysis results to the State Geotechnical Engineer within
 one (1) Working Day from the time of transmission.
 At the option of the State Geotechnical Engineer, Department personnel may perform the
 Case Pile Wave Analysis Program.
 504.3.4.2
 
 Pile Load and Pile Pullout Testing Requirements
 
 504.3.4.2.1
 1.
 
 Test Pile and Anchor Pile Requirements
 
 Driven Piles.  Apply the load to a production pile driven in the final Plan location,
 unless otherwise specified in the Contract, and apply the test frame against anchor
 (tension) piles;
 Use production piles driven in final Plan locations for the anchor piles unless the
 layout of the test frame reaction points is fixed and inconsistent with the production
 pile layout or unless an alternative pile type is required to develop adequate pullout
 resistance. The Project Manager will decide if anchor piles that are not final
 production piles may be cut-off below final grade or pulled after the testing is
 completed;
 
 2.
 
 Section 504:
 
 Cast-in-Place Piles.  Apply the load to a production pile located in the final Plan
 location, unless otherwise shown in the Contract. Use either driven piles or cast-inplace piles as anchor piles. Do not use anchor piles as final production piles.
 Load Testing of Bearing Piles
 
 Page 280
 
 Provide cast-in-place anchor piles with reinforcement capable of carrying the pile
 tension force.
 504.3.4.2.2
 
 Commencement of Load Test
 
 Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, wait a minimum of 24 h between driving or
 installing anchor piles or the test pile and commencing with the pile load or pile pullout test.
 When testing pipe piles filled with concrete or cast-in-place concrete piles, begin load
 tests after the concrete has attained a compressive strength of 2,500 psi.
 504.3.4.2.3
 
 Load Testing Procedures
 
 Conduct pile load tests and pile pullout tests in accordance with the following
 requirements:
 1.
 
 Perform the Quick Load Test Method for Individual Piles in accordance with
 ASTM D 1143, but take the load test to the first of either failure of the test pile or
 capacity of the load system;
 
 2.
 
 Test pile failure is defined as total vertical pile movement equal to the greater of
 either five percent (5%) of the pile diameter or two (2) inches;
 
 3.
 
 If failure occurs, remove the test load in four (4) approximately equal amounts with a
 five-minute interval between removals;
 
 4.
 
 For pile load tests where piles are 24 inch or less in diameter or width, the ultimate
 capacity is the load that produces a settlement of the pile head in accordance with
 the following equation:
 
 Sf  S  (0.15  0.008D)
 
 (1)
 
 Where,
 
 Sf
 D
 
 is the settlement at the ultimate pile capacity in inches
 
 S
 
 is the elastic deformation of pile length in inches
 
 is the pile diameter or width in inches
 
 Use the following equation for piles with diameters or widths greater than 24 inches:
 
 Sf  S 
 
 D
 30
 
 (2)
 
 Where,
 
 5.
 
 504.3.4.3
 
 Sf
 D
 
 is the settlement at the ultimate pile capacity in inches
 
 S
 
 is the elastic deformation of pile length in inches
 
 is the pile diameter or width in inches
 
 For pile pullout tests, the State Geotechnical Engineer will determine when the
 ultimate pile capacity is attained.
 Completion of Dynamic Testing of Driven Piles
 
 After completing the dynamic test pile(s) at a Substructure element, prepare the pile(s)
 for any specified pile load or pile pullout test(s).
 If no load testing is required as determined in Section 501.3.6, “Pile Acceptance,” the
 required field Acceptance criteria for the production piles is dynamic testing. When dynamic
 testing alone is specified, the State Geotechnical Engineer will require up to 36 h after
 completion of the last test pile to provide the driving criteria.
 Drive production piles no deeper than the estimated or minimum penetration elevation
 Section 504:
 
 Load Testing of Bearing Piles
 
 Page 281
 
 before receiving the field Acceptance criteria. Record the average hammer stroke and pile set
 after driving of each pile to determine pile Acceptance once the driving criteria is established.
 After receiving the field Acceptance criteria, drive piles until attaining the required ultimate
 capacity.
 504.3.4.4
 
 Completion of Dynamic Testing of Cast-in-Place Piles
 
 Base the required production pile tip elevation on the dynamic testing and load testing
 results if specified. The State Geotechnical Engineer will require up to 36 h after completion of
 the last test pile to provide the pile tip elevation.
 Unless the State Geotechnical Engineer directs otherwise, place no other piles until
 receiving the production pile tip elevation.
 504.3.4.5
 
 Completion of Load Testing
 
 After completing the specified load test(s) to the Project Manager’s satisfaction, dismantle
 the test apparatus and Equipment and remove from the site. Use the load test results to
 determine the ultimate pile capacity Acceptance criteria of driven piles as established under
 Section 501.3.6, “Pile Acceptance,” and to confirm ultimate pile capacities determined by
 dynamic pile tests.
 Pulled anchor piles of the same type as the production piles may be reused as production
 piles if not rejected by the Project Manager due to damage as covered in Section 501.3.6.3,
 “Damaged Pile Limitations.”
 For cast-in-place piles, use the load test results to determine the pile penetration
 requirements if no subsequent dynamic testing is specified.
 The State Geotechnical Engineer will require up to 36 h after completion of the last test
 pile to provide the pile tip elevation.
 Re-drive production piles used as anchor piles in accordance with Section 501.3.6, “Pile
 Acceptance.”

 PILE INTEGRITY TESTING
 
 DESCRIPTION
 
 505.1.1
 
 General
 
 This Work consists of pile integrity testing for verifying structural integrity and determining
 the extent and location of pile defects. Defects may include internal voids, necking of the
 pile’s perimeter, transverse cracks, soil intrusions, weak concrete or grout in drilled shaft
 foundations.
 505.1.2
 
 Test Methods
 
 Use crosshole sonic logging (CSL) or low strain integrity (LSI) testing for integrity testing.
 The Department may require LSI testing to corroborate the results of CSL testing that show
 potential defects. Only an approved Integrity Testing Consultant or Department personnel will
 perform CSL or LSI Testing.
 505.1.3 Consultant Integrity Testing
 If an Integrity Testing Consultant is required, the consultant’s qualifications must meet the
 requirements of the Geotechnical Design Section and the Equipment used must meet the
 requirements of Section 505.3.1.1, “CSL Testing Equipment,” and Section 505.3.1.2, “LSI
 Testing Equipment.” Perform field testing with an experienced technician or Engineer having
 at least one (1) year of experience with the integrity testing methods. Use a licensed
 professional Engineer having at least three (3) years of experience in the integrity testing
 methods performed to interpret the recorded measurements.
 505.1.4
 
 Department Integrity Testing
 
 Department personnel will only perform integrity testing when the Contract specifies CSL
 or LSI Department testing. Department personnel will use Department-owned Equipment to
 perform testing.
 505.1.5
 
 Assistance
 
 Provide additional labor to perform the testing if required by the testing consultant or
 Department personnel. Provide access to the piles. If required, provide a 110 V, 55 Hz to
 60 Hz, AC power supply.

 Ensure that the CSL system has filter/amplification of data and cables;
 
 5.
 
 Use a CSL system that has a synchronized triggering feature with the ultrasonic
 pulse for the recording system.
 
 505.3.1.2
 
 LSI Testing Equipment
 
 Use LSI Testing Equipment that meets the following requirements:
 1.
 
 Use Equipment that has a digital data acquisition system with a dynamic signal
 analyzer, magnetic disk storage and hardcopy plotting capabilities. Ensure that the
 analyzer has both signal conditioning and power supply with high signal-to-noise
 ratios and variable frequency filtering to mitigate steel reinforcing and surface waves
 vibration noise. Ensure that the data is displayed in the field so that a preliminary
 data quality evaluation is possible;
 
 2.
 
 Provide a receiver that is a suitable velocity transducer or accelerometer and place
 on the pile head.
 
 505.3.2
 
 CSL Testing Requirements
 
 505.3.2.1 Preparation of CSL Access Tubes
 Place access tubes in drilled shafts where the wet-hole construction method was used, or
 as directed by the State Geotechnical Engineer. Install access tubes as shown in the Plans.
 Fasten the tubes to the exterior reinforcement cage, so the tube bottoms are six (6) inches
 above the shaft bottom and the tube tops are 12 inches above the shaft top. Tie the tubes to
 the cage and glue the tubes together while lowering the cage into the shaft. Immediately after
 concrete or grout placement, fill the tubes with clean water and cap.
 505.3.2.2
 
 CSL Testing Procedure
 
 Before construction of the Substructure above the foundation, direct the CSL consultant
 to test the completed piles from two (2) Days to ten (10) Days after completing concrete or
 grout placement. Provide information about the pile’s bottom and top elevations, tube lengths
 and positions, and construction dates to the Integrity Testing Consultant or Department
 personnel before logging.
 Log between each adjacent pair of tubes in the pile. Place the source and receiver
 probes in the same horizontal plane unless test results indicate potential defects. If potential
 defects are indicated, evaluate the area further using angled tests with the source and receiver
 vertically offset in the tubes. Additional testing of other untested tube pair combinations may
 be required.
 Simultaneously pull the probes from the tube bottom of the over the depth wheel or other
 measuring device, once the slack is taken out of the cables, to provide accurate depth
 measurements. Take the CSL measurements at 2 3/8 inch intervals or less from the bottom to
 top of the pile. Report defects indicated by longer pulse arrival times and significantly lower
 amplitude/energy signals to the State Geotechnical Engineer. The State Geotechnical
 Engineer may require further tests to evaluate the extent of the defects.
 Refill CSL tubes with water after testing the shafts containing defects indicated by the
 initial CSL testing.
 505.3.2.3
 
 CSL Testing Results
 
 Report the results of completed CSL testing at a given Substructure element within
 5 Days after testing completion for that element. Provide report copies to the State
 Section 505:

 Geotechnical Engineer and the Project Manager that contain the following information:
 1.
 
 CSL logs (indicate defect zones on the CSL logs);

 analyses; and
 
 3.
 
 Narrative.
 
 505.3.3
 
 LSI Testing Requirements
 
 505.3.3.1
 
 Pile Head Preparation
 
 Ensure that the pile head is perpendicular to the pile’s vertical axis and is made of sound
 concrete. Remove weak, poor quality, or broken concrete from the pile head to expose sound
 concrete. Clearly expose the pile head and free it of debris and water. Ground the pile head
 center impacted by the impulse hammer smooth along with the pile edge area where
 transducers are attached to provide a flat, horizontal surface for the LSI test.
 505.3.3.2
 
 LSI Testing Procedure
 
 Perform LSI testing only when specified or when required by the State Geotechnical
 Engineer due to potential defects indicated by CSL testing results. Impact the pile head with a
 hammer that can produce a compression wave capable of being reflected from the pile toe.
 LSI testing may only be effective to depths of 20 times to 30 times the pile diameter. Take LSI
 testing measurements in both the time and frequency domains.
 Display the motion record (pile top velocity) on a hard copy as a function of time. High
 soil friction may require velocity signal magnification using integration with exponentially
 increasing magnitude to enhance the pile toe reflection. Average several consistent records.
 In addition to the velocity records as a function of time, the amplified and averaged difference
 between velocity and force may be displayed to provide additional information about the pile
 top quality, including dynamic stiffness.
 Use transient response or impulse response, using hammer force in the frequency
 domain (mobility) to provide additional defect determination of the pile.
 505.3.3.3
 
 LSI Testing Results
 
 Report LSI testing results completed at a given Substructure element within 10 Days after
 completing testing for that element. Provide report copies to the State Geotechnical Engineer
 and the Project Manager that contain the following information:
 1.
 
 Pile length and concrete quality analyses;
 
 2.
 
 Pile integrity opinions based on LSI testing;
 
 3.
 
 Correlation of potential defects to those indicated by the CSL test results, if
 performed;
 
 4.
 
 Pile head dynamic stiffness;
 
 5.
 
 Mobility, a measure of cross-sectional area and concrete quality;
 
 6.
 
 Plots of the averaged, amplified velocity and acceleration versus time, and, if
 required, the mobility versus frequency; and
 
 7.
 
 Narrative.
 
 505.3.4
 
 Acceptance and Rejection of Piles
 
 The Department will accept piles if pile integrity testing reports verify the structural
 integrity of the piles. Pile rejection will require conclusive evidence that a defect exists that
 may result in inadequate or unsafe performance under service loads. If the report is
 inconclusive, the State Geotechnical Engineer may require the Contractor to drill a core hole
 into the defective pile.
 The Department will reject shafts where velocities are less than 10,000 ft per second and
 Section 505:
 
 Pile Integrity Testing
 
 Page 285
 
 the anomalous velocity is less than 25% of the baseline velocity of the CSL record. Such
 rejection may be due to tubes not being tied in a plumb position and with equal offsets from
 adjacent tubes.
 If a pile is unacceptable, submit a remedial action plan to the State Geotechnical
 Engineer. Provide calculations and Working Drawings stamped by a registered professional
 Engineer for foundation elements affected by modifications to the foundation piles and load
 transfer mechanisms caused by the remedial action.

 506.3.4
 
 Wall Erection
 
 Erect walls in accordance with the manufacturer’s written instructions. Ensure that a field
 representative from the manufacturer is available during the erection of the first ten percent
 (10%) of the wall (and as directed by the Project Manager) to assist the Fabricator, Contractor,
 and Project Manager. Place panels so that their final position is vertical or battered in
 accordance with the Contract. Sequence the placement of panels in successive horizontal lifts
 during backfill placement in accordance with the Working Drawings.
 506.3.4.1
 
 Placement Tolerances
 
 When placing backfill Material, maintain the panels in the specified vertical alignment with
 temporary wedges or bracing as recommended by the manufacturer. Ensure that vertical and
 horizontal alignment tolerances do not exceed .75 inch if measured with a ten (10) ft
 straightedge. Ensure that the overall horizontal tolerance (plumbness) of the vertical wall does
 not exceed .5 inch per ten (10) ft. Ensure that the offset at any panel joint does not exceed
 0.4 inch.
 506.3.4.2
 
 Placement of Reinforcement Elements
 
 Place the reinforcement elements normal to the face of the wall, unless otherwise shown
 on the Plans. Ensure that the reinforcement bears uniformly on the compacted reinforced soil
 from the connection to the wall to the end of the reinforcing elements. Do not cut the
 reinforcement elements to accommodate obstructions within the reinforced soil zone. Do not
 weld soil reinforcements (shop or field welds) to extend lengths of longitudinal reinforcements.
 The Department will allow approved shop welds at the connections and approved spot-welds
 at the transverse and longitudinal intersections of bar mats.
 506.3.5
 
 Backfill Placement
 
 Perform backfill placement immediately after erecting each level of wall panels. Place
 backfill carefully to avoid damage or disturbance of the wall Materials, misalignment of wall
 panels, or damage to soil reinforcement. Replace wall Materials damaged during backfill
 placement at no additional cost to the Department. If backfill placement causes misalignment
 or distortion of wall panels, correct at no additional cost to the Department.
 506.3.5.1
 
 Compaction
 
 Compact backfill in accordance with AASHTO T 180 (Modified Proctor), Method D (TTCP
 Modified), Note 7, to 95% of the maximum density, except as modified in accordance with
 Section 506.3.5.1.1, “Compaction of Bridge Approaches,” and Section 506.3.5.1.2,
 “Compaction Against Faces of Walls.”
 506.3.5.1.1
 
 Compaction of Bridge Approaches
 
 Compact the backfill to 95% of maximum density as determined by AASHTO T 180
 (Modified Proctor), Method D (TTCP Modified), within 50 ft of the centerline of a Bridge
 abutment. Control this density adjacent to and around pile or casing penetrations through the
 reinforced soil mass at the abutment.
 506.3.5.1.2
 
 Compaction Against Faces of Walls
 
 Compact the backfill to 90% density as determined by AASHTO T 180 (Modified Proctor),
 Method D (TTCP Modified), within 3.3 ft of the wall. Compact with a minimal number of
 passes using a lightweight mechanical tamper, roller, or vibratory system. Determine the
 number of passes with a test section before compaction against the wall, as approved by the
 Project Manager. Use approved compaction Equipment from the test section for production
 Work. If changing Equipment, create a new test section to determine the number of passes
 for the Project Manager’s approval.
 506.3.5.2
 Section 506:
 
 Moisture Control
 Mechanically Stabilized Earth Retaining Structures
 
 Page 292
 
 Uniformly distribute the moisture content of the backfill Material throughout each layer
 before and during compaction. Ensure that backfill Materials have an in-place moisture
 content of three percent (3%) less than optimum to optimum. Remove backfill Material with
 in-place moisture content greater than optimum and rework, or replace with acceptable backfill
 Material.
 506.3.5.3
 
 Lift Thickness
 
 Ensure that the maximum lift thickness after compaction does not exceed eight
 (8) inches. Decrease the lift thickness, if necessary, to obtain the specified density.
 506.3.5.4
 
 Protection of the Work
 
 At the end of each Day’s operation, slope the last level of backfill away from the wall to
 direct runoff away from the Structure. Do not allow surface runoff from adjacent areas to enter
 the wall construction site.

 509.2.4.3.3
 
 Fine Aggregate Gradation Requirements
 
 If the combined gradation procedure detailed in Section 509.2.8.3.1, “Combined
 Gradation” has been chosen by the Contractor, then the gradation requirements specified
 below do not apply. Comply with all other aggregate properties and characteristics, including
 the amount of Material passing the No. 200 sieve.
 Use well-graded fine aggregate in accordance with Table 509.2.4.3.3:1, “Fine Aggregate
 Gradation Requirements.”
 The gradation requirements represent the limits that the
 Department will use to determine source acceptability.
 The Department will not approve fine aggregate that has more than 45% passing any
 sieve and retained on the next finer sieve shown in Table 509.2.4.3.3:1, “Fine Aggregate
 Gradation Requirements.”
 Use a fineness modulus, calculated in accordance with
 AASHTO M 6, to determine the degree of uniformity between representative samples. If the
 combined gradation procedure has not been chosen, the Department may reject fine
 aggregate from designated sources with variation in fineness modulus greater than 0.20
 above or below the fineness modulus shown on the approved concrete mix designs.
 Variations in excess of these tolerances may be cause for rejection. The Department may
 accept the aggregate once the Contractor assures the State Materials Bureau that the source
 maintains the designated production tolerances.

 the combined fine and coarse aggregates passing the No. 200 sieve does not exceed three
 percent (3.0%).
 509.2.4.4
 
 Alkali-Silica Reactivity
 
 Prevent damage from ASR in accordance with the following procedures.
 Perform the initial proof-of-reactivity-potential test using standard Rio Grande Type I-II
 low alkali cement from the Rio Grande Cement plant located at Tijeras, New Mexico. Use
 cement with an alkali content of from 0.5% to 0.6%. The Department considers aggregates
 with mean mortar bar expansions of greater than 0.10% at 14 Days potentially reactive and
 those less than 0.10% as non-reactive. Expansions greater than 0.20% are considered
 “Reactive.” If tested using ASTM C 1293, the Department will consider aggregate nonreactive if the average expansion at the end of one (1) year is less than 0.04%. Once the
 State Materials Bureau decides a particular aggregate source is non-reactive, it will not require
 the source to reevaluate for three (3) years unless concerns arise from possible aggregate
 source changes. Obtain a list of reactive, potentially reactive, and non-reactive aggregate
 sources tested to date from the State Materials Bureau.
 Section 509:
 
 Portland Cement Concrete Mix Designs
 
 Page 300
 
 If the results of the initial proof-of-potential-reactivity test show the aggregate to be
 “potentially reactive” or “reactive”, repeat the test procedure using the actual cement, fly ash
 and, if desired, any of the ASR inhibiting admixtures shown in Table 509.2.4.4:1 “ASR
 Inhibiting Admixtures.” Report the minimum amount of Class F fly ash, and the minimum
 amount of ASR inhibiting admixture required to provide a maximum expansion at 14 Days that
 is less than 0.10%. Report the Fly Ash required as a percentage of the cement weight.

 ASR Mitigation Evaluation Criteria
 
 The Department will consider an admixture effective if the mean mortar bar expansion at
 14 Days is less than or equal to 0.10%, when tested in accordance with Section 509.2.4.4
 “Alkali-Silica Reactivity.” Retest aggregates classified as “potential reactive” or “reactive” for
 ASR mitigation each time the comprehensive mix evaluation is performed. If the test results
 from AASHTO T 303 or ASTM C 1293 indicate “potentially reactive” or “reactive” Material, but
 the Contractor believes that the aggregates are non-reactive, submit the following
 documentation as proof of non-reactivity:
 1.
 
 A letter signed and sealed by an Engineer registered in New Mexico confirming
 direct knowledge of the fundamentals of ASR in concrete and stating that the
 subject aggregates have never caused ASR concrete deterioration; and
 
 2.
 
 A report from an approved petrographer. The report will confirm that at least two (2)
 different concrete core samples obtained from different 15-year old exposed
 Structures that used the subject aggregates in a cement-only mixture were
 examined and that there is no evidence of ASR reactivity.
 
 After receipt of a stamped letter from the registered professional Engineer indicating no
 Section 509:
 
 Portland Cement Concrete Mix Designs

 evidence of ASR gel found in either of the cores, the Department will consider the aggregate
 sources non-reactive.
 509.2.5
 
 Admixtures
 
 Ensure the total admixture, or combinations of admixtures, of soluble and insoluble
 chloride content does not exceed 1,000 ppm. Use only admixtures on the Department’s
 Approved Products List.
 509.2.5.1
 
 Air Entraining Admixtures
 
 Use air-entraining admixtures that comply with AASHTO M 154.
 509.2.5.2
 
 Chemical Admixtures
 
 Use water-reducing and set-controlling admixtures set retarding admixtures, and nonchloride set accelerating admixtures, that comply with Section 509.2.5, “Admixtures,” and
 AASHTO M 194.
 509.2.6
 
 Water
 
 Test non-potable water before use in accordance with AASHTO T 26. Use water for
 mixing and curing concrete or washing concrete aggregates that does not contain acid, oil,
 alkali, organic matter, or other Deleterious Material that will adversely affect the concrete. Use
 water with a pH value of from 6.0 to 8.5 in accordance with AASHTO T 26. Do not use water
 with a sulfate content or chloride content that exceeds 1,000 ppm. Prevent contamination
 from silt, clay, organic matter, or other Deleterious Material. Do not use residual water, wash
 water, or recycled water generated by Equipment, mixer trucks, or central mixers in concrete
 mixtures.
 509.2.7
 
 Fibrous Concrete Reinforcement
 
 Use fibers in the concrete mix at a minimum dosage rate of 1.5 lb per cubic yard of
 concrete. Use only 100% virgin polypropylene fibrillated fibers, containing no reprocessed
 olefin Materials, and specifically manufactured for use in PCC.

 The Department will allow linear interpolation for an intermediate number of tests. A mix
 that was developed from a history of 15 or more test results from the preceding 12-month
 period is considered an existing mix. A mix developed without historical test results is
 considered a new mix.
 Class E and Class F concrete must attain minimum strength at 14 Days. The minimum
 Class F over-design is 800 psi at 14 Days unless a lower value is calculated using the greater
 value from either Equation (1) or Equation (2). The minimum Class E over-design is 600 psi at
 14 Days, unless a lower number is calculated using the greater value from either Equation (1)
 or Equation (2).
 Class G shall have the following characteristics:
 1.
 
 A minimum cementitious content of at least 611 lb;
 
 2.
 
 A maximum water/cementitious ratio no greater than 0.44;
 
 3.
 
 A maximum sized aggregate no greater than 0.75 inch;
 
 4.
 
 A sand/aggregate ratio between 40% and 42% by total aggregate volume;
 
 5.
 
 A maximum air content no greater than three percent (3.0%);

 Adjust admixtures for the job site conditions encountered so that the concrete
 remains workable and plastic for the two (2) h placement limit.
 
 509.2.8.2
 
 Freeze-Thaw Risk Zones
 
 Design the concrete mixture for use in the freeze-thaw zone in which the Project is
 located. One freeze/thaw cycle is defined as a Day in which the lowest recorded temperature
 is equal to or less than 25 °F as recorded on the Western Regional Climate Center database.
 The web address is www.wrcc.dri.edu. The risk levels are defined as follows:
 1.
 
 Low-Risk.  The annual average number of freeze/thaw cycles is equal to or less
 than 30 cycles per year;
 
 2.
 
 Medium-Risk.  The annual average number of freeze/thaw cycles is greater than
 30 but less than or equal to 130 cycles per year;
 
 3.
 
 High-Risk.  The annual average number of freeze/thaw cycles is greater than
 130 cycles per year.
 
 Obtain the number of freeze/thaw cycles using the closest weather station to the Project
 with the most similar environmental conditions. Use Table 509.2.8.2:1, “Statewide Concrete
 Risk Zones,” to determine the required risk zone.

 PCC Mixture Development
 
 Submit representative samples of all proposed Materials to a PTL that is pre-approved to
 design PCC mixtures by the State Materials Bureau. Provide a professional civil Engineer
 licensed by the State of New Mexico with a minimum of three (3) years experience in
 proportioning and testing PCC mixes to directly supervise all testing.
 509.2.8.3.1
 
 Combined Gradation
 
 The combined gradation procedure is optional for all concrete mixes except for Class FLS and High Performance Deck (HPD) mixes. Class F-LS and HPD mixes must be prepared
 using the combined gradation procedure. Evaluate aggregates for concrete mixtures prepared
 for the combined gradation procedures in accordance with the following:
 1.
 
 Coarseness Factor.  Determine the Coarseness Factor in accordance with the
 following equation:
 
 CF 
 
 Q
  100
 QI
 
 (3)
 
 Where,
 
 CF is the Coarseness Factor
 
 Q
 
 is the weight of the aggregate retained on or above the 3/8-inch sieve
 
 I
 
 is the weight of the aggregate passing the 3/8 inch sieve, but retained on
 the No. 8 sieve
 
 2.
 
 Workability Factor.  The weight of the aggregate passing the No. 8 sieve divided
 by the weight of the combined gradation, represented as a percent.
 
 3.
 
 Mortar Factor.  The volume of the cement, fly ash, water, air, other pozzolans,
 and aggregate passing the No. 8 sieve divided by the volume of the entire concrete
 mixture, represented as a percent.
 
 4.
 
 Paste Factor.  The volume of the cement, fly ash, water, air, and other pozzolans
 divided by the volume of the entire concrete mixture, represented as a percent.
 
 Combine aggregates to produce a uniform gradation. Ensure that combined aggregates
 comply with the required individual physical and chemical properties. Individual gradation
 requirements will not apply. Use the .45 Power Curve to blend the aggregates to achieve the
 densest grading possible. Approximate targets for the Coarseness Factor and the Workability
 Factor are shown in Table 509.2.8.3.1:1, “Recommended Workability Factor and Coarseness
 Factor Targets,” for concrete mixtures designed using combined gradation.

 Concrete Mix Design Development
 
 Use fly ash in all concrete mixtures. If fly ash is the only pozzolan used, add at a
 minimum of 20%, by weight of cement only. Only use Class C or C/F blended fly ash with
 non-reactive aggregate. When using Class C or C/F blended fly ash instead of the Class F fly
 Section 509:

 ash, use at a minimum dosage rate of 25%, by weight of cement. When using additional
 pozzolans, such as silica fume, metakaolin, or GGBFS, the minimum amount of fly ash
 required is 12% for mixtures using Class F fly ash and 15% for mixtures using Class C fly ash.
 When using multiple pozzolans, ensure that the total pozzolan content is at least 20% with
 Class F fly ash and 25% with Class C or C/F blend fly ash.
 509.2.8.4.1

 1.
 
 All Materials used comply with Section 510.2, “Materials;”
 
 2.
 
 The PTL prepared and tested a proof mix using the designated Materials and batch
 weights;
 
 3.
 
 A complete companion set of compressive strength test cylinders was delivered to
 the Department District Laboratory for comparison testing; and
 
 4.
 
 The cylinders were cured for at least 48 h after casting, and the cylinders were
 transported upright in protected and cushioned containers to the Department District
 Laboratory.
 
 509.2.8.4.2
 
 Concrete Mix Design Designing & Proportion
 
 Design and proportion the concrete mixtures to comply with the following performance
 requirements:
 1.
 
 Except for concrete mixtures to be used exclusively in pre-stressed applications, all
 structural concrete mixtures must demonstrate strength gain characteristics as
 follows:
 1.1 28-Day strength of at least 130% of the seven (7)-Day strength;
 1.2 56-Day strength at least 108% of the 28Day test;

 4.
 
 Determine the durability index from at least one (1) prism tested at 28 Days for
 300 cycles, in accordance with ASTM C 666, Method A. Cure prisms tested for
 durability index by bathing in lime saturated water at a temperature of 73.3 °F ±
 3.0 °F for the first seven (7) Days followed by 21 Days in lime saturated water at a
 temperature of 100.0 °F ± 3.0 °F.
 
 5.
 
 If the specimen cannot be tested immediately after curing, place immediately in a
 freezer at a maximum temperature of 10.0 °F until testing;
 
 6.
 
 Hardened air void system characteristics required of all structural concrete classes,
 when examined in accordance with the ASTM C 457 linear traverse method include:
 6.1 A minimum air content of five percent (5.0%);
 6.2 A specific surface greater than 600 in-1; and
 6.3 A spacing factor less than 0.008 inch;
 
 7.

 8.2 Less than 2,500 coulombs for Medium-Risk Zones; or
 
 Section 509:
 
 Portland Cement Concrete Mix Designs
 
 Page 307
 
 8.3 Less than 2,000 coulombs for High-Risk Zones;
 9.
 
 Cure concrete for chloride ion permeability the same way as the durability index
 specimens in accordance with #2, above;
 
 10. The maximum shrinkage value for Class F-LS concrete mixtures and for HPD
 concrete mixtures is 0.05% at 56 Days when tested with three (3) inch x four
 (4) inch x 16 inch prism or three (3) inch x three (3) inch x ten (10) inch prism and
 cured in a standard cure for the first seven (7) Days. Following the seven (7) Day
 initial cure, cure in a relative humidity of 50% and test in accordance with
 AASHTO T 160;
 11. For Class G mixtures, provide trial mix and slump loss test results that verify
 compliance with the concrete slump requirements for Class G.
 Only technicians who are currently certified by TTCP-Concrete or ACI Concrete Field
 Technician, Level I shall determine concrete fresh properties in accordance with the
 appropriate AASHTO procedures. Laboratories approved by the Department’s State Materials
 Bureau shall determine hardened properties. Technicians performing tests on aggregates and
 aggregate gradations shall be certified by TTCP or ACI Concrete Laboratory Level I. Those
 technicians performing strength tests on hardened concrete must be certified as an ACI Level

 Mixture Design Approval
 
 The Department will require at least 14 Days to review the submittal packages after
 receipt by the State Materials Bureau of all required information. The Department will approve
 designs for a period of 1 year from the date of issuance if the documentation verifies
 compliance with all requirements. At least 30 Days before the 1-year approval expires, the
 Contractor may request that the mix design be reissued. The Contractor must provide test
 reports showing that the mix design met specification requirements during the issue period.
 Mix designs may be re-approved for no more than 4 additional years. The Department will
 grant each approval period if the documentation verifies the following:
 1.
 
 Constituent Material sources and the Material’s properties remain the same;
 
 2.
 
 The compressive strength performance data verifies compliance with Section
 510.3.5.3, “Acceptance of Concrete Based on Cylinders;”
 
 3.
 
 Compliance with other fresh and hardened properties is verified where the mixture
 was used;
 
 4.
 
 The coefficient of variation (CV), determined in accordance with ACI 214, is less
 than 12%; and
 
 5.
 
 When field performance data shows the CV exceeds 12%, a “Comprehensive
 Operations QC/QA Manual” that shows how the Contractor will reduce the variability
 and improve the consistency of its production process will be required.
 
 Section 509:
 
 Portland Cement Concrete Mix Designs
 
 Page 310
 
 At the discretion of the State Concrete Engineer, a mixture can be adjusted without rebatching by using “cement efficiency” calculations to determine the amount of change to the
 cement and the total cementitious content that is necessary to achieve the desired level of
 performance. When this procedure is allowed, the ratio of pozzolan to cement ratio will remain
 unchanged, the water content will remain unchanged, and the aggregates will be adjusted
 without changing the overall gradation to accommodate the changes in volume from changes
 made to the cement. All changes made by this method must be approved by the State
 Concrete Engineer before being implemented in the field.
 If the constituent Materials change, immediately provide documentation to the State
 Materials Bureau describing how to resolve the problem. Return the affected Material to an
 approved condition or submit a new concrete mixture design package. If the compressive
 strengths do not comply with Department requirements, describe the needed adjustments.
 Submit a written summary of the adjustments to achieve compressive strength to the State
 Materials Bureau for approval. Do not use the concrete mixture on Department Projects
 before receipt of written approval from the State Materials Bureau.
 The Department will not consider the addition of more cement a sufficient explanation or
 resolution without additional documentation explaining why other measures are not
 appropriate.

 General Use
 
 510.3.1.1
 
 Freeze-Thaw
 
 Use a concrete mixture which has been approved for use in a freeze-thaw zone of equal
 or greater risk than the zone in which the Project is located.
 510.3.1.2
 
 Class Substitution
 
 The Contractor may substitute an approved structural class of concrete with a higher
 compressive strength than that of the specified class of concrete, as long as the design slump
 characteristics remain the same (i.e. Class AA for Class A, Class F for Class E). Do not
 substitute Class A for Class E or Class AA for Class F concrete mixtures.
 Perform concrete field-testing with Concrete Field Testing Technicians certified by ACI or
 TTCP.
 510.3.1.3
 
 Alternate Batching Facilities
 
 A request may be made to the State Materials Bureau to allow a currently approved
 concrete mixture to be batched out of facilities not under the direct control of the Contractor to
 whom the concrete mixture approval is granted. The Department will permit off-site batching of
 an approved concrete mixture when the following occur:
 1.
 
 Use the same Materials as those used at the plant where the mixture is approved
 and as shown on the approved mix design;
 
 2.
 
 Use the same admixtures as those used at the plant where the mixture is approved
 and as shown on the approved mix design;
 
 3.
 
 Prepare a written QC plan for the alternate batch facilities, personnel and operations
 that adequately addresses how the alternate batch plant will assure the quality of
 the mixture;
 
 4.
 
 The operations at the alternate batch facility has confirmed compliance with the
 approved QC plan with other mixtures;
 
 5.
 
 Provide concrete performance statistics that assure the same level of performance
 can be achieved from the alternate batch facilities.
 
 510.3.1.4
 
 Plastic Properties
 
 The allowable slump range for non-superplasticized Class AA, Class HPD and Class A
 concrete is 3.5 inches ± 1.0 inch. The allowable slump range for Class E and Class F SlipFormed Concrete is 1.5 inches ± 1.0 inch. All test procedures and frequencies will be
 performed in accordance with the Minimum Testing Requirements. Measure the air content in
 accordance with AASHTO T 121. The air content determined by AASHTO T 121 will be used
 to confirm compliance with the specified air content for structural concrete.
 1.
 
 Low Risk Freeze/Thaw Zone – from 4.5% to 8.0%; or
 
 2.
 
 Medium Risk Freeze/Thaw Zone – from 5.0% to 8.0%; or
 
 3.
 
 High Risk Freeze/Thaw Zone – from 6.0% to 8.0%.
 
 510.3.1.5
 
 Troubleshooting
 
 If the approved mixture design fails to meet requirements, the Project Manager will
 immediately contact the PTL that designed the mixture and the State Concrete Engineer. The
 PTL shall work with the State Concrete Engineer to make the necessary changes to resolve
 Section 510:
 
 Portland Cement Concrete
 
 Page 313
 
 the problems. Efforts to evaluate problems with the concrete does not relieve the Contractor
 of the responsibility to provide a concrete mixture that meets Project requirements.
 510.3.2 Batching
 Produce ready-mixed concrete and site-mixed concrete in accordance with
 AASHTO M 157, Section 9 to 11. Ensure that production facilities are certified in accordance
 with the National Ready Mix Concrete Association (NRMCA) criteria for concrete production
 facilities.
 510.3.2.1
 
 Batching Plant
 
 The Department will review and approve facilities and Equipment before batching
 operations begin.
 Ensure that batching plants have clearly separated aggregate bins or stockpiles; silos for
 cement and fly ash; weighing hoppers; and scales. Ensure that the batch plants are equipped
 to proportion aggregates, bulk cement and fly ash using calibrated weighing devices. Weigh
 aggregates on separate scales or accumulatively on a single scale. If weighing fly ash on the
 same scale as the portland cement, weigh the cement first, then add the fly ash.
 Ensure that the batch plant operator has a direct view or live video of each scale and
 admixture sight tube while preparing batches of concrete. It is not sufficient to be able to see
 only the computer measurements. Ensure that the batch plant is capable of:
 1.
 
 Accurately weighing and batching Materials for the portland cement or portland
 cement/fly ash concrete mixture within the tolerances specified;
 
 2.
 
 Providing readily visible scale dials or instrumentation devices for admixture bottles,
 beam scales and load cells, even if using a computer to prepare the batch;
 
 3.
 
 Using weighing hoppers of sufficient size to contain the material without loss or
 spillage; and
 
 4.
 
 Properly combining and re-combining various mixture components to obtain the
 required uniformity and consistency.
 
 Use weighing hoppers that efficiently discharge weighed Materials for each batch.
 Ensure that the material charging Equipment can deliver the batch to the mixer without loss or
 spillage. Provide scales for weighing aggregates, cement, water, and fly ash in accordance
 with Section 109.1, “Measurement of Quantity.”
 510.3.2.2 Portland Cement and Fly Ash
 Use cement and fly ash in bulk or in sacks. Weigh fractions of sacks before using
 cement or fly ash in a concrete batch. Measure cement and fly ash by weight. Weigh bulk
 cement and fly ash on an approved scale, except when using continuous proportioning and
 mixing Equipment.
 Provide cement, and combined cementitious weights within ± one percent (1.0%) of the
 required weights. If the weight of cementitious Materials is expected to weigh less than
 1,000 lb, ensure that those Materials weigh within 30 lb of the target weight.
 If the material varies from the target weight by more than ± one percent (1.0%), the
 Department will immediately notify the Contractor to take corrective action. If the weight is no
 more than two percent (2.0%) above or 1.5% below the target weight, the Department may, at
 the Project Manager’s discretion, accept a maximum of five (5) loads out of the first ten (10)
 consecutive loads of concrete delivered of any continuous placement with these weight
 discrepancies, regardless of whether the discrepancies are for the same material or for other
 weighed Materials. Any batches of concrete produced after the first ten (10) have been
 batched that have cement or total cementitious weights that are more than ± one percent
 Section 510:
 
 Portland Cement Concrete
 
 Page 314
 
 (1.0%) will be rejected and not allowed to be placed on the Project. Dispose of rejected loads
 at no additional cost to the Department.
 Equip cement and fly ash scales and hoppers with a device that indicates the complete
 discharge of cement and fly ash into the mixer. Contain bulk cement and fly ash in weather
 tight bins and weighing hoppers. Do not suspend discharge chutes from the weighing
 hoppers. Arrange the discharge chutes so that cement and fly ash do not lodge in or leak
 from them.
 Protect cement and fly ash from moisture. Store different brands or types of cement/fly
 ash, or cement/fly ash from different production facilities separately. Provide separate,
 identifiable blended portland-fly ash cement storage at the Project or plant site. Store portland
 cement and portland-fly ash cement separately.
 510.3.2.3
 
 Water
 
 Mixing water consists of free water, ice added to the batch and surface moisture on the
 aggregates. Measure the added water by weight or volume to ensure that the amount of
 water in the mixture design is not exceeded. Measure added ice by weight. For truck mixers,
 discharge the wash water before loading the next batch of concrete.
 510.3.2.4
 
 Aggregates
 
 510.3.2.4.1
 
 Stockpiles
 
 Ensure the separation of stockpiles of different sizes or from different sources. Stockpile
 aggregates so that the coarse and fine particles do not separate. Provide stockpiles that can
 produce enough concrete for the section constructed during a scheduled operation. Ensure
 that aggregates are not contaminated by material from adjacent stockpiles or from contact with
 the ground, dust, or other Deleterious Materials. Do not use aggregates that become
 segregated or mixed with Deleterious Material. Do not use frozen lumps of aggregate in
 concrete batching.
 Ensure that a “sacrificial” layer of the same size aggregate at least six (6) inches deep is
 maintained below the bottom of the stockpile so that the front-end loader will not pick up noncomplying Materials that would contaminate the concrete mixture.
 510.3.2.4.2
 
 Gradations
 
 All gradation tests performed to fulfill the requirements of this section must be performed
 by TTCP certified technicians.
 The Project Manager may cancel concrete placements that have gradation data that is
 more than seven (7) Days old.
 1.
 
 If the mixture design is approved with the Conventional Stockpile Procedure, ensure
 that the stockpile gradations comply with the standard gradation requirements for
 each sieve size shown in Table 509.2.4.2.3:1, "Coarse Aggregate Gradation
 Requirements," and Table 509.2.4.3.3:1, "Fine Aggregate Gradation Requirements."
 
 2.
 
 If the mixture design is approved with the combined gradation procedure, it is the
 Contractor’s responsibility to continuously monitor the gradation of each of the
 stockpiles. Provide new gradation results to the Project Manager, in one (1) of the
 following ways:
 
 Section 510:
 
 2.1.
 
 If placing more than 1000 yd3 per week, provide new gradation results every
 3
 1000 yd ;
 
 2.2.
 
 If regularly making placements that total less than 1000 yd per week, provide
 new gradation results once per week.
 
 Portland Cement Concrete
 
 3
 
 Page 315
 
 2.3.
 
 If placements are irregular and limited to no more than two (2) placements in
 a single week, provide new gradation results at least 24 hours before the first
 scheduled placement in any week.
 
 3.
 
 The Contractor’s responsibilities to monitor gradations are not related to the QC/QA
 testing requirements. The Department considers these responsibilities to be part of
 the standard operation and maintenance of the batching facilities.
 
 4.
 
 Determine if the combined gradation is within the following limits:
 
 5.
 
 6.
 
 4.1.
 
 Coarseness factor is ± 3 percentage points of the value in the approved
 mixture design;
 
 4.2.
 
 Workability factor is ± 2 percentage points of the value in the approved
 mixture design;
 
 The aggregate batch weights will automatically be adjusted when the gradation
 information determined by the Supplier is entered into the Field Report form. The
 supplier will be required to use the most recent gradations to determine if the
 Coarseness Factor or the Workability Factor does not comply with 4.1 or 4.2 above.
 If the Coarseness Factor or the Workability Factor does not comply with 4.1 or 4.2
 above, the mix batch weights must be adjusted to bring these factors into
 compliance. When adjusting these factors, adjust them to the tolerances in 5.1 and
 5.2, below.
 5.1.
 
 Coarseness factor is ± 2 percentage points of the value in the approved
 mixture design;
 
 5.2.
 
 Workability factor is ± 1.5 percentage points of the value in the approved
 mixture design;
 
 If the gradation tolerances in 4.1 and 4.2 can not be met, do not place concrete until
 the gradations are corrected to meet the designated tolerances.
 
 510.3.2.4.3
 
 Batch Weights
 
 Batch aggregate target weights over 1,000 lb to within ± two percent (2%) of the target
 weight. For target weights less than 1,000 lb, batch to within ± 50 lb of the target weight.
 If any of the first ten (10) loads of concrete have a fine or coarse aggregate weight that
 differs from the target weight by more than two percent (2%), but not more than ± three
 percent (3%), the Department may, at the Project Manager’s discretion accept the concrete.
 The Department will allow no more than five (5) loads out of the first ten (10) consecutive
 loads of concrete of any continuous placement to exceed the maximum allowable weight
 tolerances. Any batches produced after the first ten (10) that differ from the target weight by
 more than ± two percent (2%) will be rejected from the Project and can not be placed on the
 Project. Dispose of rejected loads at no additional cost to the Department.
 510.3.2.4.4
 
 Moisture Control
 
 1.
 
 For a manually operated facility or for hoppers not equipped with automatic moisture
 sensors, measure the moisture content of each stockpile not monitored by
 automatic moisture sensors at least every four (4) hours, or as required by changing
 moisture conditions within the stockpiles
 
 2.
 
 For plants equipped with automatic moisture probes, for each stockpile monitored
 by an automatic moisture probe, measure moisture content manually at least once a
 Day. Compare the manual measurement immediately before preparing the first
 concrete load to the measurement shown by the moisture sensing Equipment. If the
 measurements differ by more than 0.5%, re-correlate the moisture probe.
 2.1 For stockpiles not monitored by an automatic moisture probe, follow the
 requirements of 510.3.2.4.4(1).
 
 3.
 
 Section 510:
 
 Send a certificate showing the moisture content determined by manual methods in
 accordance with Paragraph 4 below, and the moisture correlation to the Project
 Manager with the first load of concrete. If this information is not included with the
 Portland Cement Concrete
 
 Page 316
 
 first load of concrete delivered to the Project, that load of concrete and all
 subsequent loads of concrete are subject to rejection until the information is
 received at the Project.
 4.
 
 Determine the aggregate moisture content to the nearest 0.5% in accordance with
 one (1) of the following procedures:
 4.1 AASHTO T 217: The shelf life of the calcium carbide is relatively short. Closely
 monitor the age of the calcium carbide and replace it in strict accordance with
 the manufacturer’s recommendations
 4.2 AASHTO T 255: The Department will allow the hot-plate or microwave
 methods for this purpose, as long as no material is lost and the pan is
 continuously agitated during the drying process.
 
 5.
 
 Provide the following information on the moisture certificate to the Project Manager:
 5.1 Pan weight (it is not acceptable to tare out the pan weight on scales equipped
 to do so);
 5.2 Wet weight of the pan and the sample;
 5.3 First dry weight of the pan and the sample;
 5.4 Second dry weight of the pan and the sample;
 5.5 Third dry weight of the pan and the sample (if necessary);
 5.6 Absolute moisture content of the sample;
 5.7 The moisture probe reading from the tested sample (if equipped); and
 5.8 The calculated difference between the actual moisture content test and that
 shown by the moisture sensing Equipment.
 
 Allow washed aggregates to drain before use. The Project Manager may require the
 aggregates to remain in the stockpile or storage area for longer, if the moisture contents are
 excessive.
 510.3.2.5
 
 Air-Entraining and Chemical Admixtures
 
 Store admixtures in separate containers to avoid contamination, evaporation, and
 damage. Protect liquid admixtures from freezing and from damaging temperatures. For
 admixtures used as suspensions in non-stable solutions, provide agitating Equipment to
 ensure the thorough distribution of the ingredients. Measure liquid admixtures within ± three
 percent (3%) of the target amount.
 510.3.2.6
 
 Mixing
 
 Ensure that the uniformity of the concrete mixture complies with AASHTO M 157,
 Section 10.2. If using a central plant mixer it must have a rated mixing capacity of at least
 3 yd³. Batch and deliver concrete in accordance with NRMCA Standards.
 510.3.3
 
 Transporting
 
 Transport mixed concrete in non-agitating trucks only when the slump is less than two (2)
 inches. Revolving-drum mixer trucks must be used to transport concrete with a slump in
 excess of two (2) inches. Transport concrete produced in a dry-batched concrete plant in
 revolving-drum mixer trucks.
 510.3.3.1
 
 Non-Agitator Trucks
 
 Use only non-agitating trucks with bodies that are smooth, mortar-tight metal containers
 capable of discharging the concrete at a satisfactory controlled rate without segregation.
 Provide covers needed for protection.
 Section 510:
 
 Portland Cement Concrete

 510.3.3.2
 
 Truck Mixers and Agitators
 
 Equip agitator trucks with a plate directly attached to the truck in a readily visible location,
 labeled with the specific truck properties, including the designated drum mixing speed.
 Keep documentation for review by Department personnel upon request to show that the
 mixers and agitators have been inspected in accordance with NRMCA Guidelines within the
 last 12 months.
 Department personnel will check the water tank site tube when the truck arrives at the
 Project site. If there is water missing from the tank, the Department will reject the truck unless
 the Driver can account for the missing water.
 510.3.3.3
 
 Upon Arrival at the Project
 
 Re-mix the concrete that arrives at the Project site in agitator trucks as follows:
 1.
 
 For concrete mixed in a central mix plant: mix at the designated mixing speed for a
 minimum of two (2) min, before discharging;
 
 2.
 
 For concrete mixed inside an Agitator Truck: mix at the designated mixing speed for
 a minimum of five (5) min, before discharging;
 
 3.
 
 If any water, water-reducing admixtures, entrained air, or other ingredients are
 added to the concrete, mix the additional material at the designated mixing speed
 for at least five (5) min before discharging.

 until the concrete has been placed into its final location. Do not use concrete mixed less than
 the minimum specified time. The maximum mixing time for concrete hauled in truck mixers or
 truck agitators is 90 min. Do not exceed 60 min of mixing time when:
 1.
 
 The concrete temperature is 80 °F or above for Bridge decks or approach slabs,
 
 2.
 
 The concrete temperature is 85 °F for other concrete.
 
 When hauling the concrete in non-agitating trucks, all concrete must be placed into its
 final location within 45 min of initial mixing. If the concrete temperature is 80 °F or above,
 place concrete within 30 min from initial mixing.
 Concrete arriving at the Project with a temperature greater than 90 oF can not be used.
 510.3.4.2.1
 
 Extended Mixing Time
 
 In rural and remote areas of the State where mixing time cannot be met, submit a written
 request to the Assistant District Engineer for additional time. Include the following information:
 1.
 
 The reason for requesting additional time;
 
 2.
 
 The additional time needed in excess of the specified mixing time;
 
 3.
 
 The proposed procedures, methods, and type of Materials or admixtures to be used
 so that the concrete will meet required fresh and hardened properties; and
 
 4.
 
 Documentation to prove that the additional time will not damage the quality of the
 concrete.
 
 Section 510:
 
 Portland Cement Concrete
 
 Page 318
 
 This information will be forwarded to the State Concrete Engineer for review. The State
 Concrete Engineer will issue a written recommendation within 10 Working Days from receipt of
 the request.
 If the Department allows a mixing time extension, prepare a trial batch consisting of at
 least one (1) full load of concrete at the designated production facility and haul to the Project
 site. Batch the concrete in the same quantities as anticipated for the Project. Place the trial
 batch in a non-critical application to assess the mixture. If the dosage used is found to provide
 a final setting time within 20 – 30 minutes after the concrete has been unloaded, then the
 Contractor will be approved for the use of the designated hydration stabilizer at the dosage
 determined from this trial.
 510.3.4.3
 
 Concrete Sampling and Testing
 
 The Contractor shall test for Quality Control; and the Department will test for Acceptance.
 1.
 
 Measure concrete for specification compliance only by the test methods shown in
 the Minimum Testing Requirements. The Department will not accept results from
 the in-place test methods described in Section 510.3.5.2, "In-Place Concrete
 Strength Measurements" as an alternative to these requirements.
 Obtain
 representative samples of concrete from the approximate middle of the truck being
 tested for the required properties from the point of discharge into the structure being
 placed. The Department will provide test results to the Contractor after the final
 compressive strength tests for each set of test specimens is completed with a copy
 to the Supplier on a weekly basis;
 
 2.
 
 Mold and cure concrete cylinders for compressive strength tests in accordance with
 AASHTO T 23, Making and Curing Concrete Test Specimens in the Field using four
 (4) inch × eight (8) inch single use plastic cylinder molds with plastic lids. Use
 cylinder molds that are six (6) inch × 12 inch if the nominal maximum size of the
 aggregate is equal to or greater than 1.5 inch
 
 3.
 
 Use a rod to consolidate the concrete for all slump, air content and unit weight tests
 and all compressive strength test cylinders cast with normal slump concrete (Class
 A, Class AA, Class G and Class D). Use a vibrator to consolidate the concrete in all
 air content and unit weight tests and all test cylinders cast from slip form concrete
 (Class E and Class F). Do not use a rod to consolidate slip-form concrete
 
 4.
 
 Provide all necessary support for all testing and to maintain sufficient safe storage
 space, including but not limited to water bath container, water for initial curing of
 concrete cylinders, heating or cooling as necessary, generators (and alternate
 power sources, as needed) and all vibratory Equipment and all Equipment required
 to operate the vibratory Equipment as required by Section 510.3.4.3.
 
 5.
 
 Immediately after molding, begin curing of test cylinders by submerging in a water
 bath with a temperature of 70 °F ± 10 °F. Do not exceed 25 min from the time the
 concrete was sampled to the start of initial curing. Use water that complies with
 Section 510.2.4, "Water," for the initial curing.
 All cylinder curing containers for testing of the concrete must be in the same
 location, and within 50 ft of the testing site, chosen in advance by Department
 inspection personnel unless an alternative location has been approved by the
 Project Manager prior to the placement. The Project Manager can not authorize any
 location that does not provide sufficient time for the casting of the test specimens
 and subsequent delivery to the initial curing location within the 25 minutes allowed
 to begin initial curing of the test specimens.
 Maintain the water-filled containers with the test cylinders undisturbed for a
 minimum of 21 h, but not more than 48 h, from the time of placement. Ensure that
 the level of water never drops below the tops of the cylinders.
 
 6.
 
 Section 510:
 
 After initial curing, strip the concrete cylinders and place into a standard curing tank
 (or moist room) in accordance with AASHTO T 23, Section 10.1.3. If the cylinders
 are to be shipped to an off-site Laboratory for testing, maintain the cylinders in the
 standard curing environment at a temperature of 73 +/- 3 oF until they are ready to
 be transported. Do not ship test cylinders until they are at least 48 h old.
 Portland Cement Concrete
 
 Page 319
 
 7.
 
 The party that prepared the test specimens is responsible for transporting them from
 the initial curing environment to the final curing location. Protect the test specimens
 from being damaged in any way. Specific attention will be paid to protection from
 sun, wind, rain, vibrations, moisture loss and any sudden drops or impacts during
 transport.
 
 510.3.4.3.1
 
 Testing Frequency
 
 Department personnel will perform all testing in accordance with the Minimum Testing
 Requirements.
 510.3.4.3.2
 
 Continuous Concrete Placements
 
 It is common practice to place and test concrete at the same time, therefor:
 As concrete is being placed and tested, concrete tests which are outside the allowable
 concrete test ranges may be encountered and are to be immediately reported to the Project
 Manager. Concrete that has already been placed shall be removed if the slump is more than
 one (1)inch over the specified limits and air is more than ½% below the minimum air specified.
 The Project Manager then can determine to place or halt the placement of the remaining
 concrete. The Project Manager can determine if the placed concrete needs to be removed or
 if it can remain. In the event that two (2) consecutive trucks or any two (2) out of six (6) trucks
 are outside the allowable testing ranges, concrete shall not be placed in the structure until the
 concrete testing is performed prior to the placement operation and the allowable concrete test
 ranges are shown to be in the allowable range. If concrete from five (5) consecutive trucks are
 delivered within allowable concrete testing parameters, then the placement and testing of
 concrete can once again be performed concurrently.
 Payment of concrete that deviated from required parameters will receive a $50/cu yd pay
 reduction in addition to the outcome of the final pay factors for the concrete.
 510.3.4.4
 
 Superplasticizers
 
 If using a superplasticizer, measure the initial slump before adding the superplasticizer,
 and again immediately after the super-plasticizer has been properly mixed into the load. Do
 not exceed slump Specifications defined on the approved mixture design before introducing
 the super-plasticizer. Do not exceed a slump of eight (8) inches after adding the superplasticizer. Check super-plasticized concrete for segregation before and during placement.
 Do not place segregated concrete.
 510.3.5
 
 Acceptance
 
 510.3.5.1
 
 Concrete Strength
 
 Determine the compressive strength for compliance by averaging two (2) or more
 concrete cylinder test results from the same concrete sample and tested at the specified age.
 Make, handle, and store in accordance with AASHTO T 23 and test in accordance with
 AASHTO T 22. Consider the result from a single cylinder only as an indicator. It will not be
 considered an actual strength measurement.
 510.3.5.1.1
 
 Individual Strength Test
 
 Unless otherwise specified, verify compliance with the Specifications by determining the
 concrete strength at the age designated in Table 509.2.8.1:1, “Concrete Classes for
 Laboratory Design of Concrete Mixtures.” Make at least 4 cylinders for each set. Test the
 first cylinder at seven (7) Days for use as an early concrete compressive strength indicator.
 Test the second and third cylinders to determine the Individual Strength Test result. Reserve
 the fourth cylinder for testing if the Within-Test-Coefficient-of-Variation exceeds five percent
 (5%), in accordance with ACI 214.3.4.1. If the fourth cylinder is tested, average all of the
 Section 510:
 
 Portland Cement Concrete
 
 Page 320
 
 cylinders tested at that age to determine the Individual Strength Test, unless any of the
 following conditions exist:
 1.
 
 There is a visible cylinder defect or a defect in the capping.
 
 2.
 
 A significant irregularity occurred while loading the test specimen to failure, such as
 a sudden load burst, cyclic or pulsating loads, or a loading rate not in accordance
 with AASHTO T 22.
 
 510.3.5.2
 
 In-Place Concrete Strength Measurements
 
 If the Contractor requests measurement of in-place concrete strength for constructionrelated purposes, the Contractor must provide testing Equipment and perform strength tests at
 no additional cost to the Department. Field cured test cylinders will be tested by a PTL
 approved by the State Materials Bureau. Use one (1) of the following procedures to determine
 the in-place concrete strength:
 1.
 
 Core Testing.  Perform in accordance with AASHTO T 24, and Section 510.3.5.4,
 "Investigation of Low Strength Cylinder Test Results";
 
 2.
 
 The Maturity Method, ASTM C1074.  Integrates the heat of hydration and the
 time since the concrete was batched, correlated for the specific concrete mixture
 before use in the field;
 
 3.
 
 The Windsor Probe, ASTM C803.  Measures the penetration depth of a specially
 fabricated probe into the concrete, calibrated to the concrete mixture;
 
 4.
 
 The Pull-Out Test, ASTM C900.  Measures the pull-out resistance of a plug cast
 into the concrete, calibrated to the concrete mixture;
 
 5.
 
 The Match-Cure Method.  Places additional cylinders into a specially controlled
 chamber that maintains the temperature of the cylinders to that of the concrete
 represented;
 
 6.
 
 The Cast-in-Place Cylinder Method, ASTM C873.  Tests a cylinder that was cast
 into the concrete being evaluated and subsequently removed for testing. The hole
 remaining after removal of the cast-in-place-cylinder must be filled with a non-shrink
 grout or a Type K cement;
 
 7.
 
 The Rebound Test, ASTM C 805 (as modified herein) This procedure must be
 performed in accordance with directions from the State Concrete Engineer. At a
 minimum, a test shall consist of at least 14 credible rebounds obtained from an area
 approximately 18 inches in diameter. The highest two (2) and the lowest two (2)
 rebounds will be deleted and the remaining 10 rebound results averaged to
 determine the rebound number from the test location.
 
 8.
 
 Field Curing.  Cast cylinders in accordance with AASHTO T 23, and cure in
 accordance with AASHTO T 23, Section 10.2.1.
 
 Before using any method of measuring in-place concrete strength in the field (with the
 exception of Method 8 - “Field Curing”), submit complete supporting documentation for the
 method proposed for use and intended procedures to be followed to the Project Manager for
 approval by the State Materials Bureau.
 Do not use field cured cylinders to determine the in-place strength for any structural
 applications. The Department will not permit any test samples to be extracted from Bridge
 decks, prestressed members or approach slabs. Prohibited testing for these Structures
 includes core testing, pull-out tests, or cast-in place cylinder test methods.
 If the in-place compressive strength is at least equal to the strength required for the
 intended application, the Contractor may strip forms or allow traffic on the structure or
 pavement.
 510.3.5.3
 
 Compressive Strength Compliance of Concrete Based on Cylinders
 
 The Department will accept concrete based on the compressive strength cylinder tests
 when the compliance tests equal or exceed the specified strength. If the compliance test is
 Section 510:
 
 Portland Cement Concrete
 
 Page 321
 
 less than the specified strength, the test will be considered acceptable if both of the following
 requirements are met:
 1.
 
 The running average of three (3) consecutive individual strength tests meets or
 exceeds the specified strength; and
 
 2.
 
 No Individual Strength Test as defined in 510.3.5.1.1 falls below the specified
 strength by more than 500 psi.
 
 If the compliance test does not meet cylinder-based Acceptance requirements, the
 Department will review the strength tests and notify the Contractor whether the concrete will
 be accepted at a reduced price, or if the Contractor has to replace it.
 510.3.5.4
 
 Investigation of Low Strength Cylinder Test Results
 
 Do not use the following test procedures as a substitute for the compliance test program
 in Section 510.3.4.3, "Concrete Sampling and Testing." The procedures described below will
 not be allowed more than twice during the course of the Project.
 If problems with low strength cylinder tests persist, the Department may suspend the
 Project at no additional cost or time to the Department and require the Contractor to comply
 with Section 510.3.1.5, “Troubleshooting”. If the corrective actions taken by the Contractor are
 insufficient, the Department may suspend Work again, at no additional cost or time to the
 Department, until the Project Manager determines acceptable action as proposed by the
 Contractor.
 The Contractor may use any of the in-place strength-test methods in accordance with
 Section 510.3.5.2, "In-Place Concrete Strength Measurements," to investigate areas of
 concern if normal Acceptance tests do not comply with Section 510.3.5.3, "Acceptance of
 Concrete Based on Cylinders." However, the Schmidt Hammer test shown in Section
 510.3.5.2.7 can not be used for final Acceptance or to determine the pay factor. Do not use
 core testing, pull-out testing, or cast-in place cylinder test methods for any investigation of
 concrete contained in Bridge decks, prestressed members or approach slabs.
 510.3.5.4.1
 
 Testing Cores
 
 If the Contractor uses cores to determine in-place compressive strength, obtain cores in
 accordance with AASHTO T 24, and immediately seal each core in an air tight plastic bag.
 Test cores in accordance with AASHTO T 22.
 If the concrete structure will be dry under normal service conditions, cure the cores inside
 the plastic bags at a temperature range between 60 °F to 80 °F for seven (7) Days before
 testing. Test the cores dry.
 If the concrete structure will be more than superficially wet under normal service
 conditions, cure the cores in lime-saturated water for at least 40 h before testing. Test the
 cores wet.
 Obtain the cores 49 Days after concrete placement (21 Days for Class E or Class F
 concrete). Take at least three (3) cores from any area of concern to evaluate the area of that
 had low strength test results. The Department will approve core locations before the cores are
 obtained. Test for compressive strength of the concrete cores at 56 Days (28 Days for Class
 E or Class F concrete).
 For Bridge concrete (exclusive of Bridge decks) with low strength test results, the Bridge
 Design Section will develop a coring plan within 38 Days of the initial concrete placement.
 Obtain, cure and test cores in accordance with the previous paragraph.
 The Department will accept the concrete when the average of the cores representing
 each area of concern equals or exceeds the specified strength.
 510.3.5.4.2
 Section 510:
 
 Alternate Testing
 Portland Cement Concrete
 
 Page 322
 
 As an alternative to using cores for testing in-place compressive strength, Method 2, 3, 4,
 5, 6 or 7 can be used to investigate the in-place strength of the concrete in question. For
 Bridge decks, prestressed members and approach slabs, use only in-place strength-test
 methods 2, 3, 5 or 7 described in Section 510.3.5.2, "In-Place Concrete Strength
 Measurements." Submit a written request to the Project Manager for permission to use the
 selected method. Do not proceed until receipt of written approval from the State Materials
 Bureau. Method 7 can only be used to investigate the areas of concern, and can not be used
 for final Acceptance of for determination of the pay factor.
 The Department will accept the concrete when the average of the tests is equal to or
 greater than the 108% of the specified strength.
 510.3.5.4.3
 
 State Concrete Engineer Analysis
 
 If the in-place strengths are not adequate for Acceptance at full price, the State Concrete
 Engineer will evaluate the concrete.
 After reviewing the State Concrete Engineer’s
 recommendations, the Department will take one (1) of the following actions:
 1.
 
 Direct the Contractor to remove and replace the failed concrete at no additional cost
 to the Department; or,
 
 2.
 
 Pay the Contractor for the concrete in accordance with Flow Chart 510.3.5.5.1:1,
 "Price Adjustment Percentages for Low Strength Concrete Based on Lab-Cured
 Cylinders."
 
 510.3.5.5
 
 Price Adjustments
 
 The Department will make price adjustments for non-compliance with concrete strength
 Specifications based on lab-cured strength tests unless alternate in-place strength tests have
 been previously approved.
 If the compliance strength test is 85% or more of the specified strength then the
 Contractor may choose to have a Hardened Air Content Test on a core obtained from the
 concrete in question performed by a Department approved Petrographer in accordance with
 ASTM C-457, linear traverse method. If the result of the hardened air content analysis meets
 the requirements below, the concrete will be paid for at full price.
 1.
 
 A minimum air content of 50%;
 
 2.
 
 A specific surface greater than 600 in-1; and
 
 3.
 
 A spacing factor less than 0.008 inch.
 
 510.3.5.5.1
 
 Cylinder Based Price Adjustments
 
 If low strength concrete is accepted based on lab-cured cylinders, the Department will
 pay for concrete in the lot represented by the low strength tests in accordance with Flow Chart
 A:, "Price Adjustment Percentages for Low Strength Concrete Based on Lab-Cured Cylinders."
 510.3.5.5.2
 
 Price Adjustments based on In-Place Strength Tests
 
 1.
 
 If the Department accepts low strength concrete based on core tests, the
 Department will pay for the concrete represented by the cores in accordance with
 "Flowchart B: Pay Factor Determination for Portland Cement Concrete by In-Place
 Strength Tests”
 
 2.
 
 If the concrete strength is based on one (1) of the in-place test methods specified in
 Section 510.3.5.2, "In-Place Concrete Strength Measurements”, methods 2 through
 6, The Price Adjustment Factor will be determined by first multiplying the specified
 strength by 1.08. This value will then be used as the denominator to determine the
 percentage of the measured in-place strength compared to the adjusted specified
 strength. The pay factor shown in Flow Chart B: Price Adjustment Percentages for
 Low Strength Concrete Based on In-Place Strength Tests for that percentage will be
 
 Section 510:
 
 Portland Cement Concrete
 
 Page 323
 
 applied to all of the affected concrete. The Department will not allow use of field
 cured cylinders to determine price adjustments.

 Surface Treatment of Forms
 
 Ensure that all forms have been properly treated with an approved form release agent
 before placing reinforcing steel. Ensure that forms have been properly wetted before placing
 concrete.
 Do not use form oil that adheres to or discolors the concrete.
 511.3.3.4
 
 Metal Forms
 
 Provide metal forms thick enough to prevent bending and maintain their shape. Use
 countersunk bolts and rivet heads. Use clamps, pins, and other connecting devices designed
 to hold forms rigidly together and for removal without damaging the concrete. Use metal
 forms that have a smooth surface and line up properly.
 The Contractor may use metal forms that remain part of the Structure in accordance with the
 Contract or as approved by the State Bridge Engineer. Use permanent steel Bridge deck
 forms in accordance with Section 512.3.4.1, “Permanent Steel Deck Forms.”
 511.3.3.5
 
 Reuse of Forms
 
 Section 511:

 Continuously maintain the shape, strength, rigidity, water tightness, and surface
 smoothness of reused forms. Resize warped or bulged lumber before reusing it.
 511.3.4
 
 Temperature and Weather Limitations
 
 Keep the concrete mixture temperature between 50 °F to 90 °F at the time of placement.
 511.3.4.1
 
 Cold Weather Concrete
 
 Do not place concrete directly onto any surface that is less than 40 °F unless otherwise
 approved by the Project Manager. Do not place concrete on frozen ground.
 Place cold weather concrete in accordance with ACI 306, Cold Weather Concreting.
 If placing concrete at or below air temperatures of 35 °F, provide suitable enclosures and
 heating devices. Vent exhaust from combustion type heating devices outside the placing area
 so that the exhaust fumes can not come in contact with the freshly placed concrete.
 Ensure the concrete surface temperatures never fall below 45 °F during placement and
 the first three (3) Days after placing. Do not let the surface temperature fall below 40 °F during
 the next four (4) Days after placing, or until the in-place strength determined by the Maturity
 Method, as described in Section 510, “Portland Cement Concrete” indicates that 75% of the
 design strength is achieved.
 Monitor the minimum concrete temperatures at various locations including edges and
 corners of slabs or other Structures, and check immediately before placing insulating material
 over the concrete.
 If heating the aggregates or water, use heating methods and Equipment that can heat the
 Material uniformly. Do not heat the Materials to more than 110 °F. During the heating or
 mixing process, do not add cement to water and aggregate combinations that are hotter than
 90 °F.
 If air temperatures are likely to fall below 35 °F during the placement or curing periods,
 submit a cold weather concreting and curing plan to the Project Manager for approval by the
 State Concrete Engineer before concrete placement. Allow 14 Days for review. Ensure that
 the plan details the methods and Equipment to maintain the required concrete temperatures.
 Information submitted will include, but not be limited to:
 o
 
 Whether or not outside heating sources will be used (and how the exhaust will be
 vented away from the fresh concrete);
 
 o
 
 What the target mix temperature will be;
 
 o
 
 How the concrete will be protected from the ambient conditions;
 
 o
 
 How soon after the placement the protection from the ambient conditions will be
 implemented;
 
 o
 
 Who will be responsible for insuring that the proper protection from the environment
 is properly implemented;
 
 o
 
 o
 
 How the actual temperature of the concrete will be monitored;
 o
 
 How often will this be checked;
 
 o
 
 Who will do the checking;
 
 What actions will be taken if the temperatures fall below the target points;
 
 o
 
 Who will be responsible for taking the necessary actions;
 
 o
 
 Who the contact will be if Department Personnel need to talk transmit notices or
 information about the cold weather conditions.
 
 511.3.4.2
 
 Hot Weather Concrete
 
 Place hot weather concrete in accordance with ACI 305, Hot Weather Concreting.
 Section 511:
 
 Concrete Structures

 511.3.4.3
 
 Wind Break
 
 If a wind break is used, the wind break shall be a minimum height of eight (8) ft- 0 inches
 and constructed in a perimeter enclosing the Bridge deck, approach slabs, sleeper footings
 and/or transition slabs (if applicable). All areas of the freshly placed concrete must be
 protected by the wind break. The nature and type of windbreak to be used shall be approved
 by the Project Manager prior to placement of any Superstructure concrete.
 511.3.4.4
 
 Fogging System
 
 If a fogging system is used, a water fog shall be continuously applied over the surface of
 the freshly placed concrete in such a manner that the entire surface is kept at a relative
 humidity of 90% or greater and the surface of concrete is kept at an evaporation potential of
 0.15 pound/square foot/hour or less, as determined from Figure 511.3.3.5:1. The evaporation
 potential shall be determined prior to fogging and outside the wind protection, and
 continuously monitored with evaporation potential measurements taken and recorded at least
 once every five (5) min throughout the entire placement, and continuing until the concrete
 curing system has been completely installed. If a wind break and/or fogging are being used,
 obtain these readings from the protected area at a height of approximately five (5) feet above
 the protected concrete.
 The area to be fogged shall be the entire area of the freshly placed concrete, which has
 not had the final finish applied. This fog shall be delivered through a network of nozzles,
 which are properly spaced to provide a uniform fog at the surface of the concrete. The
 nozzles used shall be of the type, which atomizes the water so that there are no visually
 discernible droplets of water. The area of coverage from each nozzle shall overlap all
 adjacent nozzle coverage by at least one (1) ft. It shall be demonstrated prior to the
 placement of the concrete that the intended system is capable of delivering the required
 fogging environment for at least twice the anticipated required time. Do not finish or otherwise
 mix any of the fogging water into the fresh concrete.
 The intended system must be properly field tested, and approved by the State Materials
 Bureau before being used on any Superstructure concrete. Fogging shall continue until the
 surface is covered with an approved curing compound. The wet burlap shall not be applied
 over the curing compound until the Superstructure concrete can receive the wet burlap and
 any placement loads without deformation.
 The use of a Mono-Molecular Film (MMF) evaporation retarder shall only be used in strict
 accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. If used, it shall be applied and no
 further finishing efforts will be permitted in any location that has received the MMF. Under no
 circumstances shall the MMF be used as a finishing aid in the working of the concrete surface.
 DO not place concrete until the Project Manager approves the reinforcing steel and forms.
 Ensure that forms are clean and free of rust, grease, and other Deleterious Material
 immediately before placing the concrete. Remove wooden form spacers immediately before
 placing concrete in that area.
 Vibrate the concrete during placement to force the coarse aggregate from external surfaces
 and to bring mortar against the forms to produce a smooth finish significantly free of water, air
 pockets, and honeycombs.
 Place concrete in girders, walls, and other similar Structures in horizontal layers. Ensure
 that the concrete is not too thick for the vibrator to consolidate and merge it with the previous
 layer. Do not pour concrete layers deeper than two (2) ft.
 Do not place concrete faster than the rate used for the design of the forms. Adjust the
 rate for the temperature of the concrete being placed.
 511.3.4.5 Rate of Evaporation Limitations (applies to Bridge decks, approach slabs,
 Sidewalks, curbs, CBC (top and bottom slabs), slipped formed concrete Structures, all
 PCCP, structural shotcrete, and concrete slope paving) (review listing of Structureshow to match top paragraph)
 Section 511:
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 Page 330
 
 Do not place concrete unless the average combination of air temperature, temperature of
 fresh concrete, relative humidity, and wind velocity (Evaporation Potential) at the site over any
 ten (10) minute period is less than 0.20 lb per square foot per hour in accordance with
 Figure 512.3.7.5:1, “Surface Evaporation from Concrete,” by using a continuous reading
 computerized weather station set to intervals not greater than five (5) minutes apart.
 Measurements of the wind speed, relative humidity and ambient air temperature used to
 determine the Surface Evaporation from the Concrete shall be taken at a height of
 approximately five (5) feet above the deck. Utilize an automated system that does not require
 any human support or effort after its initial set-up. Continue obtaining and recording the
 Surface Evaporation from the Concrete after all of the concrete has been placed until the final
 curing system has been physically applied.
 Do not place concrete during periods of high air temperature, low humidity, or high winds
 unless one (1) or more of the following measures have been taken upon by the Contractor at
 his expense and maintained to the satisfaction of the Project Manager to reduce the rate of
 evaporation to within the specified rate:
 1.
 
 Erect windbreaks to reduce the wind velocity over the concrete surface;
 
 2.
 
 Place concrete during nighttime or early morning hours;
 
 3.
 
 Use cool aggregate and mixing water to lower the fresh concrete temperature during
 hot weather;
 
 4.
 
 Increase the relative humidity at the site with a fog spray; or
 
 5.
 
 Protect the concrete with temporary wet coverings during an appreciable Delay
 between placing and finishing.
 
 511.3.5.1
 
 Chutes and Troughs
 
 Avoid segregation of the Materials and the displacement of the reinforcement when
 placing the concrete. Use metal or metal-lined open troughs and chutes; do not use
 aluminum. All tools used for the moving and/or spreading of the concrete shall be square
 pointed tools. Do not use round nose shovels and spreading tools.
 Where the Contract requires steep slopes, equip the chutes with baffle boards or use
 short lengths that reverse the direction of movement.
 Keep chutes, troughs, and pipes clean and free of hardened concrete by thoroughly
 flushing with water after each pour. Discharge the water used for flushing away from the
 placed concrete.
 Do not allow concrete to free fall for more than five (5) ft, unless confined by closed
 chutes or pipes. For walls equal to or less than 10 inch thick, such as Culvert walls, concrete
 may have a free fall of less than nine (9) ft.
 Fill each part of the form by placing the concrete as close to the final position as possible.
 Vibrate the concrete during placement to force the coarse aggregate back from the forms and
 around the reinforcement without displacing the bars. After the concrete's initial set, do not jar
 the forms or place strain on the ends of projecting reinforcement.

 Concrete Pumping
 
 If placing concrete by pumping, install pumping Equipment so that vibrations resulting
 from the operation do not damage the concrete being placed. Obtain Project Manager
 approval before using concrete pumping Equipment.
 Before placing the concrete, clean the Equipment thoroughly. Operate the Equipment so
 that it pumps a continuous flow of concrete without air pockets and without an appreciable loss
 of slump or entrained air.
 Control the loss of entrained air by one (1) or more of the following methods:
 1.
 Section 511:
 
 Tie the end of the pump hose so that the discharge end is pointing upward, forming
 Concrete Structures
 
 Page 332
 
 a “J” at the end of the hose;
 2.
 
 Install a series of four (4) consecutive elbows to form a 360° loop;
 
 3.
 
 Reduce the diameter of the end of the pump line; or
 
 4.
 
 Limit the enclosed angle of the boom arms to an angle of 135° or more.
 
 Make sure that the discharge of the concrete from the pump is as close as possible to the
 bottom of the structure being placed, but in no case shall it be allowed to drop a distance
 greater than four (4) feet.
 Do not use aluminum pipe. Do not add water to the concrete during pumping. If water is
 added at the pump hopper to clear a clogged pump, dispose of the concrete in the hopper and
 the line.
 511.3.5.3
 
 Conveyers and Belts
 
 The Contractor may use conveyor belts to transport the concrete from the point of
 delivery to the point of placement. If using multiple belts, ensure that the drop from one (1) belt
 to the next is no greater than 18 inches. At the end of the last belt, do not allow the concrete
 to free-fall more than four (4) ft. Ensure that the concrete coming off the end of any belt is not
 being segregated. If segregation occurs, slow down the speed of the belt until segregation no
 longer occurs.
 511.3.5.4
 
 Placing Concrete Under Water
 
 If placing concrete under water, submit a mix design and procedure plan to the Project
 Manager. The Project Manager may require up to 30 Days to approve them. Allow time in the
 schedule to accommodate this approval process.
 511.3.5.5
 
 Vibrating/Consolidation
 
 Unless otherwise directed by the Project Manager, and excluding drilled shafts, compact
 concrete with suitable mechanical vibrators operating within the concrete. During concrete
 placement, keep enough personnel, vibrators, and other tools available to assure adequate
 consolidation. If necessary, supplement vibrating with hand spading with suitable tools to
 assure proper consolidation. If using vibrators, use procedures in accordance with ACI 309.
 Do not use a “jitterbug” or any other flat tool that could cause concrete segregation.
 Use approved vibrators that can transmit vibration at frequencies up to 10,000 vpm.
 Provide vibrators that have each been certified within the last 90 Days to provide 8,000 to
 10,000 vpm.
 Operate vibrators to consolidate the concrete thoroughly around the reinforcement and
 embedded fixtures and into corners and angles of the forms. Do not use vibrators to make
 concrete flow or run. Vibrate long enough to accomplish consolidation, but do not vibrate so
 long to cause segregation or air bubbles. Insert the vibrators vertically into the concrete, and
 immediately withdraw upward along the same line with the opposite motion. Do not drag the
 vibrator horizontally across the placing area.
 When operating vibrators, avoid contact with reinforcing bars, particularly epoxy coated
 reinforcing bars or bars that extend into concrete that has taken an initial set. If vibrating
 concrete in areas reinforced with epoxy-coated bars, cover the vibrators with nonmetallic
 sleeves to prevent damage to the epoxy coating.
 511.3.5.6
 
 Sequence of Placement and Application of Load
 
 Do not place superimposed loads on or against load carrying members, floor slabs, or
 retaining walls until the concrete reaches 80% of specified compressive strength but no
 less than 2,500 psi, as determined by the Maturity Method, in accordance with
 Section 510.3.5.2, “In-Place Concrete Strength Measurements.” Concrete box Culverts and
 Section 511:
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 Page 333
 
 CBC wingwalls shall not be backfilled until specified compressive strength has been achieved.
 Submit a concrete placement schedule to the Project Manager upon request. Plan and
 schedule concrete placement to prevent damage to previously placed concrete or to the curing
 or protection systems of previously placed concrete.
 The following applies to concrete placement scheduling:
 1.
 
 The Contractor may erect reinforcement and formwork for walls, columns, and pier
 caps 24 h after placement of footings or floor stab concrete;
 
 2.
 
 Unless otherwise provided, the Contractor may concrete columns, walls, and pier
 caps, 48 h after placement of footing or floor slab concrete;
 
 3.
 
 Do not set beams or girders, or place Superstructure concrete until Substructure
 forms have been stripped sufficiently to determine the quality of the concrete;
 
 4.
 
 Do not place the load of the Superstructure on the Substructure until the
 Substructure concrete has been in place for at least 14 Days or until in-place
 strength measured by the Maturity Method indicates that the concrete has attained
 the design strength;
 
 5.
 
 Ensure that the concrete has achieved sufficient strength as determined by the
 Maturity Method in accordance with the form design before placing concrete for
 integral horizontal members, such as pier caps or roof slabs;
 
 6.
 
 Place the vertical members at least seven (7) Days before mounting friction collars
 or falsework brackets that will support the weight of horizontal members. Ensure
 that the vertical members have attained the specified strength before applying
 loads, unless the Department approves otherwise;
 
 7.
 
 Limit monolithic casting of walls and deck slabs of concrete box Culverts to Culverts
 that are six (6) ft high or less. Construct box Culvert walls higher than six (6) ft in
 accordance with this subsection;
 
 8.
 
 If the strength gain of the concrete is retarded, the District Construction Engineer
 may extend the waiting periods. Conduct construction operations in a manner that
 does not damage the previously placed concrete.
 
 511.3.5.7 Supplementary Lighting
 Do not mix, place, or finish concrete when the natural light is insufficient without using an
 adequate artificial lighting system, approved by the Project Manager. Test the lighting system
 at least one (1) Day before placing the concrete to assure that the system will provide
 sufficient light, without shadows or dark areas for placing, testing and finishing concrete.
 Ensure that the lights do not create a hazard for traffic on adjacent Roadways or Detours.
 511.3.6
 
 Removal of Forms
 
 Do not remove the forms until the concrete is strong enough to avoid damage by
 removing the forms, and the temperature differential between the concrete surface to be
 exposed and the core of the concrete Structure is less than 10 °F per inch.
 If in-place strength tests in accordance with Section 510.3.5.2, “In-Place Concrete
 Strength Measurements,” are not used to control field operations remove forms in accordance
 with Table 511.3.5:1, “Timetable for Removal of Forms,” not counting those Days when the
 temperature is below 40 °F.

 If one (1) of the test methods in Section 510.3.5.2, “In-Place Concrete Strength
 Measurements,” is used to control the field operations, the Contractor may remove forms from
 the bottom of beams and floor slabs when the concrete reaches 75% of the design
 compressive strength.
 511.3.7
 
 Joints
 
 Make construction joints in concrete Structures in accordance with the Plans, unless
 otherwise directed or approved by the Project Manager.
 If the concrete placement is interrupted and additional construction joints are required,
 place the additional joints in planes perpendicular to the principal lines of stress, and at points
 of minimum shear, as approved by the Project Manager.
 Roughen the joint surface to increase the bond with future concrete, except in areas near
 the forms.
 511.3.7.1
 
 Keyed Joints
 
 Mechanically bond construction joints with keys formed by beveled strips embedded in
 the surface of the concrete. Make the keys from 1 3/8 inch to 1 1/2 inch deep. Place the keys
 centrally within the thickness of the joint. Ensure that the keys have a width that is one-third of
 the depth of the smallest dimension of the joint. The keys do not need to exceed the clear
 distance between reinforcing mats, or be greater than 8 inches. Provide raised keys in
 accordance with the Plans.
 511.3.7.2
 
 Bonding New Concrete to Existing
 
 If bonding new and existing concrete, retighten the forms before depositing new concrete
 on or against the hardened concrete. Roughen the surface of the hardened concrete without
 loosening the aggregate or damaging the concrete on the surface. Thoroughly clean the
 surface of foreign matter and laitance.
 Have an approved private testing Laboratory measure the water vapor being transmitted
 through the concrete surface in accordance with ASTM F 1869. Do not place new concrete on
 existing concrete if the water vapor exceeds five (5) lb per 1,000 ft2 per 24 h.
 Provide a bonding agent at the interface between the hardened and fresh concrete by
 covering the cleaned and saturated surfaces with a coating of mortar, neat cement grout, or an
 approved bonding agent. Place the new concrete before the grout reaches an initial set. If
 using an approved bonding agent, follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Do not use a
 bonding agent that is water soluble or is delivered in a water-based solution. Place the
 concrete continuously from joint to joint, and finish the face edges of exposed joints in
 accordance with the Plans.
 Section 511:
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 Page 335
 
 511.3.7.3
 
 Water Stops and Flashings
 
 Provide and place water stops and flashings. Splice or solder water stops and flashings
 to form continuous watertight joints.
 511.3.7.4
 
 Joint Fillers
 
 Accurately shape the pre-formed joint filler to fit adjacent concrete, and hold the filler
 firmly in place to prevent formation of concrete fins under and between sections of the
 Material.
 
 511.3.8 Miscellaneous Construction
 511.3.8.1
 
 Setting of Bearings
 
 Ensure the surfaces on which metal masonry plates and elastomeric bearing pads will
 rest are flat and on level planes. If using elastomeric bearing pads finish the Bridge seats
 slightly high and grind to the correct elevation.
 If it is necessary to adjust the elevation of a bearing upward, make the adjustment by
 placing full size shim plates. If it is necessary to adjust the elevation of a bearing downward,
 make the adjustment by diamond grinding to a level plane-bearing surface. Do not use grout
 to level or adjust elevation.
 If placing a bearing surface below the level of adjacent concrete, ensure water drains
 away from the masonry plate or elastomeric bearing pad.
 Finish sections of Bridge seats on abutments or piers on both sides of bearing
 assemblies to drain, with a slope of from 1/16 inch to 1/8 inch per foot. Correct depressions
 that retain water.
 511.3.8.2
 
 Waterproofing
 
 If required in the Contract, protect the backsides of abutment backwalls and wingwalls by
 waterproofing. The Contract defines the vertical and horizontal limits of the waterproofing.
 Select a membrane type waterproofing system from the Department’s Approved Products List.
 511.3.9
 
 Finishing
 
 Perform finishing after removing forms in accordance with the Contract.
 511.3.9.1
 
 Exposed Surfaces
 
 The Department considers “exposed surfaces” as surfaces that are not buried in the
 ground or permanently covered by the fill, or against which the fill is not permanently placed.
 However, the Department does not consider the inside surfaces of concrete box drainage
 Culverts and concrete box girders, and the bottom side of concrete Bridge decks as “exposed
 surfaces.”
 511.3.9.2
 
 Class 1, Ordinary Surface Finish
 
 Apply a Class 1 finish to exposed surfaces as a final finish or before a Class 2, Rubbed
 Surface Finish, or a Class 4, Special Surface Finish.
 A Class 1 finish includes the removal of rods, bolts, or other form ties to at least 1/2 inch
 deep from the face of the concrete. Fill tie holes and honeycombs with mortar composed of
 one (1) part cement and two (2) parts sand; use the same brand and type of cement as used
 in the concrete.
 Section 511:
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 Page 336
 
 Remove objectionable fins, bulges, and projections by rubbing with carborundum bricks
 or by other methods approved by the Project Manager. If necessary, clean the entire surface.
 Keep such surfaces in an acceptable condition until final Acceptance of the Work.
 Apply a Class 1 finish to surfaces buried in the ground or permanently against the fill,
 except that form ties may be cut off even with the concrete surface, and fins, minor bulges,
 projections, stains, and discolorations do not need to be removed.
 Unless specified otherwise in the Contract, apply a Class 1 finish to the front faces of
 backwalls of abutments, the top surfaces of Bridge seats on piers and abutments, and
 concrete curtain walls between pier pilings.
 Apply a Class 1 finish to the inside surfaces of concrete box drainage Culverts, except as
 noted in Section 511.3.8.3, “Class 2, Rubbed Surface Finish.”
 511.3.9.3
 
 Class 2, Rubbed Surface Finish
 
 Apply a Class 2 finish to concrete surfaces generally exposed to public view.
 The Contract may specify a Class 4, Special Surface Finish with selected colors, for
 various components or parts of components. If the Contract specifies a Class 4, Special
 Surface Finish, apply a Class 2 finish first, unless otherwise approved by the Project Manager.
 A Class 2 finish consists of a Class 1 finish, then thoroughly wetting the surface and
 applying a mortar.
 Apply a thin mortar, composed of one (1) part cement and four (4) parts sand, and rub it
 into holes and pockets; use the same brand and type of cement as used in the concrete. Use
 sand passing a No. 16 sieve. Allow the mortar to remain until it has set sufficiently to prevent
 removal by subsequent rubbing operations. Rub the surface with a No. 25 to No. 30
 carborundum brick, then, rub with burlap to remove excess mortar. If the completed rubbed
 surface does not look uniform, make a final finish by wet rubbing with a No. 30 carborundum
 brick.
 Apply Class 2 finish to the following:
 1.
 
 Outside vertical surfaces of Bridge decks;
 
 2.
 
 Outside surfaces of exterior girders, curb and rail posts seen in elevation view;
 
 3.
 
 Curb tops, post tops, inside faces of curbs, and faces of hand rails;
 
 4.
 
 Exposed surfaces of pier columns and caps;
 
 5.
 
 Abutment wingwalls and Bridge seats one (1) ft below final grade;
 
 6.
 
 Bridge rehabilitation Projects with existing slope paving;
 
 7.
 
 Top surface of slope paving (tops of Bridge seats require only a Class 1 finish);
 
 8.
 
 Exposed surfaces of barrier railings on Bridges or concrete box Culverts;
 
 9.
 
 Exposed surfaces of miscellaneous concrete Structures extending above Shoulder
 line grade and inside walls of concrete underpass Structures.
 
 10. Concrete box Culverts used for drainage, on the soffit and streamside faces of
 headwalls and wingwalls, and for six (6) inches down the back side of wingwalls;
 and
 11. The interiors of sidewalls to one (1) ft back from the face of the Culvert at the tops of
 the sidewalls, and extending on a 45° line downward and inward.
 511.3.9.4
 
 Class 3, Float Finish
 
 Apply a Class 3 finish to upper surfaces not formed, such as tops of walls, parapets, tops
 of slabs and bottom slabs of box Culverts, copings and Bridge seats, except tops of Bridge
 decks, Sidewalks, or curbs.
 Section 511:
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 Page 337
 
 A Class 3 finish consists of placing an excess amount of concrete in the forms and
 striking off this excess concrete with a template, forcing the coarse aggregate below the
 surface. After striking off the concrete, thoroughly work the surface with a wooden, cork, or
 canvas float without adding water or cement. Before the final finish has set, use a fine brush
 to remove surface film and to produce a fine grain, smooth, sanded texture.
 511.3.9.5
 
 Class 4, Special Surface Finish
 
 Apply a Class 4 finish on new Structures over the Class 2 finish, unless directed
 otherwise by the Project Manager. If applying a Class 4 finish, apply it throughout the
 Structure and on adjacent Structures for concrete surfaces where the Contract specifies a
 Class 2 finish.
 If repairing existing Structures, apply a Class 4 finish to the entire surface of the repaired
 components.
 For a Class 4 finish use Materials from the Department’s Approved Product List for
 special surface finish on concrete Structures. Use the same Material and methods for
 surfaces the Contract requires to receive a Class 4 finish.
 Submit sample panels for each type of Class 4 finish, showing colors and texture to the
 Project Manager at least 30 Days before beginning finishing operations for approval by the
 Landscape Architect. Unless otherwise shown in the Contract, use sample panels that are at
 least one (1) ft × one (1) ft.
 If applying a Class 4 finish and penetrating water repellent on a concrete surface, allow
 the penetrating water repellant to cure for at least seven (7) Days before applying the Class 4
 finish.
 511.3.9.6
 
 Penetrating Water Repellent Treatment Solution
 
 Saturate the exposed surfaces of the following concrete Structures with a penetrating
 water repellent treatment in accordance with Section 532, “Penetrating Water Repellent
 Treatment;”
 1.
 
 Bridge wingwalls;
 
 2.
 
 Front and side faces of abutment Bridge seats;
 
 3.
 
 Front faces of abutment backwalls;
 
 4.
 
 Top surfaces of Bridge seats on piers and abutments;
 
 5.
 
 Pier columns, stem walls and vertical surfaces of pier caps;
 
 6.
 
 Top and vertical side surfaces of Bridge decks, except in the areas where using
 epoxy Bridge deck overlays;
 
 7.
 
 Top surfaces of concrete approach slabs;
 
 8.

 10. Sidewalks, curbs and gutters on Structures.
 Extend treatment to at least one (1) ft below the final groundline.
 Do not treat the underside of pier caps, sides, and end surfaces of concrete approach
 slabs.
 511.3.10
 
 Curing
 
 Use curing methods in accordance with Table 511.3.9:1, “Curing of Concrete Structures,”
 unless the Contract specifies otherwise.
 For Structures with formed surfaces such as barrier walls, barrier railings on Bridges,
 wingwalls, or parapets on Bridges or box Culverts, remove the forms, finish the concrete, and
 resume curing with Method 2. Do not pause curing for more than two (2) h. Keep the
 Section 511:
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 Page 338
 
 concrete surface moist throughout the finishing and curing operations.
 For other formed vertical surfaces, the Contractor may strip or partially strip forms before
 the end of the specified seven (7) Day curing period, if the Contractor immediately resumes
 curing by Method 2.
 Cure construction joints in box Culverts, Bridge Substructures and Superstructures, and
 other concrete Structures with wet burlap for seven (7) Days, or until covered with the next lift
 of concrete. Alternatively, cure these Structures with Method 1, provided that the surfaces are
 sandblasted and thoroughly cleaned before placing the new concrete.

 Unless the Contract specifies otherwise.
 
 The Contractor shall not apply curing compound to surfaces that will receive a Class 2 or
 Class 4 finish, unless the Contractor sandblasts and thoroughly cleans the surfaces before
 applying the finish.
 If the Department allows the Contractor to choose the curing method, the Contractor shall
 obtain the approval of the Project Manager before beginning curing operations. During curing
 operations, keep unsprayed surfaces wet.
 511.3.10.1
 
 Method 1, Water Curing
 
 Keep the concrete Structures thoroughly and continuously wet and covered for at least
 seven (7) Days. Place and anchor covers, mats, and sheeting to ensure continuous contact
 with the concrete surfaces.
 The Contractor may temporarily remove the cover of surfaces that require a rubbed finish
 for finishing, but shall restore the cover as soon as possible.
 Cover concrete slabs as soon as possible with a double layer of clean, wet burlap or
 cotton mats, or other moisture retaining Material approved by the Project Manager. Next,
 cover the concrete slab with white plastic sheeting. The Project Manager will determine the
 suitability of burlap or cotton mats for reuse, based on the cleanliness and absorptive ability of
 the Materials.
 Soak burlap in a solution of water and a small amount of detergent. Drain the burlap and
 cotton mats and lay them flat with no wrinkles on the deck surface. Ensure that adjacent strips
 of burlap and cotton mats overlap at least 12 inches. Once in place, lightly fog-spray the
 burlap and cotton mats with water. Regularly re-wet the burlap or cotton mats so that they are
 Section 511:
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 Page 339
 
 not allowed to become dry.
 Completely cover the concrete slab with burlap and cotton mats and the plastic sheeting.
 If the slabs are on grade, extend the mats at least twice the slab’s thickness beyond the edges
 of the slab, and make sure that the entire exposed surface of the concrete is protected. If the
 slab is a Bridge deck, place the mats and plastic to fully protect exposed edges and unformed
 surfaces of the concrete.
 511.3.10.2
 
 Method 2, Curing Compound
 
 For slabs, Bridge decks and other flatwork, apply the curing compound to the fresh
 concrete after as soon after finishing as allowed by manufacturer.
 Thoroughly mix the membrane forming curing compound within an hour of use, and
 agitate it during spraying operations. Do not apply the curing compound in rainy conditions.
 Apply the curing compound under pressure with an atomizing-type spray nozzle.
 Uniformly cover the entire surface area at a rate of at least one (1) gal per 175 ft2. Use spray
 Equipment with enough pressure to force the curing compound to leave the nozzle as a fine
 mist. If the nozzle becomes plugged, immediately clear the nozzle before continuing the
 application. Do not continue to spray curing compound through a nozzle that has become
 plugged or obstructed.
 Apply the curing compound by first spraying back and forth in one (1) direction until a
 uniform covering has been achieved. Then spray back and forth in a direction perpendicular
 to the first application until a second, uniform covering has been achieved. Ensure that the
 entire curing surface has been uniformly covered with two (2) coatings of curing compound.
 Do not apply the curing compound to exposed reinforcing steel or construction joints.
 Protect all surfaces covered with curing compound for seven (7) Days after application.
 Provide walkways and mats for workmen, Material, and Equipment.
 Do not use a curing compound that exhibits separation, segregation, or skimming.
 511.3.10.3
 
 Method 3, Form Curing
 
 Leave forms in place for at least seven (7) Days. Keep the forms moist during the curing
 period and replenish the system with water spray to maintain a continuously moist condition.
 Cure exposed surfaces with Methods 1 or 2.
 511.3.10.4
 
 Method 4, Combination of Curing Compound and Water Curing
 
 Apply Method 2 curing first.
 When the concrete is hard enough that burlap or cotton mats can be placed without
 marring the concrete surface, apply Method 1 curing directly over the emulsion coated
 surface.
 511.3.10.5
 
 Equipment and Personnel Readiness
 
 Show the Project Manager that curing Material and Equipment (including backup
 sprayers and mixers) are in working order, at least one (1) Day before concrete placement.
 511.3.9.6
 
 Temperature Requirements for Storage and Application
 
 Store curing compounds in protected areas away from weather and extreme
 temperatures. Dispose of compounds that have been frozen in storage. Apply curing
 compounds when the temperature of the compound is between 50 °F and 95 °F.

 512.3.1
 
 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 Deck Placement Preconstruction Conference
 
 The Project Manager will hold a preconstruction conference at least one (1) week before
 the anticipated deck placement to review the specification requirements and discuss the
 Contractor’s preparations. Ensure that at a minimum the following attend the conference:
 1.
 
 Project Superintendent;
 
 2.
 
 Bridge deck foreman; and
 
 3.
 
 One (1) representative of the concrete Supplier.
 
 The recommended agenda checklist is available from the Bridge Bureau.
 512.3.2
 
 Profile Survey of Girders
 
 After placing girders and before setting screeds, take a profile along each line of girders.
 If actual top of girder elevations differ significantly (more than a nominal haunch dimension)
 from those shown on the Plans such that excessive haunches or deficient slab thickness
 would result, make appropriate adjustments as directed by the State Bridge Engineer.
 512.3.3
 
 Falsework
 
 The Contractor may not support deck finishing machines with overhang brackets outside
 of exterior girders, unless the Contractor designs a lateral bracing system to resist the entire
 torsion load from the deck overhang. The maximum vertical deflection of the screed rail due
 to the rotation of the exterior girder shall be ¼” of less. The Contractor shall submit the
 drawings for the lateral bracing system and design calculations stamped by a NM Licensed
 Professional Engineer to the Bridge Bureau for approval. The lateral resistance of the steel
 intermediate diaphragms for the prestressed girders shall not be included in the Contractor’s
 Section 512:
 
 Superstructure Concrete
 
 Page 342
 
 lateral bracing system design. The cost of the lateral bracing system and its design shall be
 included in the cost of the Bridge.
 Submit Plans and design calculations for the proposed girder bracing system to the
 Project Manager for approval at least 45 Days before the anticipated placement date.
 512.3.4
 
 Forms
 
 Use deck forms that produce the desired results.
 512.3.4.1
 
 Permanent Steel Deck Forms
 
 Provide Material and elements for the permanent steel deck form units that are fabricated
 from steel in accordance with ASTM A 653M (A653) Grades 40, 50, and 80.. Provide a Class
 G 165 coating. Provide form sheets and form supports in accordance with the shop drawings;
 that are at least 22 gauge and 16 gauge thick, respectively.
 Do not use permanent steel forms in panels where longitudinal slab construction joints
 are located between stringers. Provide proper vibration of the concrete to ensure adequate
 consolidation of concrete.
 512.3.4.1.1
 
 Permanent Ventilated Steel Deck Form Design
 
 Design permanent steel forms to support superimposed dead loads of the form,
 reinforcement, and plastic concrete, plus a live load of 50 pounds per square foot. Use steel
 ventilated at a minimum rate of 1/2 inch2 per square foot.
 The Department will not allow the following:
 1.
 
 Unit working stresses to exceed the lesser of the following:
 1.1. 72.5% of the specified minimum yield strength of the Material, or
 1.2. 36,000 psi.
 
 2.
 
 Maximum deflections under the weight of the plastic concrete, reinforcement, and
 form, to exceed the lesser of the following:
 2.1. 1/240 of the form span, or
 2.2. 3/4 inch.
 
 3.
 
 A load used to compute the deflection that is less than 120 lb per square foot.
 
 The form span for design and deflection is the clear distance between the flanges of the
 supporting girders less two (2) inches, measured parallel to the form flutes.
 Limit the increase in dead load due to the use of permanent steel deck forms to 15 lb per
 square foot. If the increase exceeds this limit, show that the additional load will not be
 detrimental; or strengthen the Structure to accommodate the extra load, at no additional cost
 to the Department.
 Calculate physical design properties in accordance with the current American Iron and
 Steel Institute Specification for Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members.
 Design the permanent steel deck forms so that the deck slab laterally supports the steel
 girder or girder top flanges in compression, except where providing shear connectors.
 512.3.4.1.2
 
 Permanent Steel Deck Form Installation
 
 Do not rest form sheets directly on the top of the stringer or floor beam flanges. Securely
 fasten sheets to form supports. Use sheets with a minimum bearing length of one (1) inch at
 each end. Place form supports in direct contact with the flange of stringers or support beams.
 Make attachments with welds, bolts, clips, or other approved means; do not weld to girder or
 beam flanges. All welding must be performed by a certified welder in accordance with the
 applicable documents and welder qualifications listed in Section 541.3.
 Section 512:
 
 Superstructure Concrete
 
 Page 343
 
 Place bottom reinforcing bars with a minimum cover of one (1) inch. Except in cases
 where reinforcing bars are not parallel to form corrugations, center the bars (approximately) in
 the bottom layer of the main reinforcement over the valleys of the forms when necessary to
 achieve the minimum concrete cover. Do not allow the distance from the top of the slab to the
 bottom layer of main slab reinforcement to be less than the dimension shown in the Contract.
 512.3.4.1.3
 Forms
 
 Inspection and Acceptance of Decks Placed with Permanent Steel Deck
 
 If during the placement of the deck concrete there is adequate evidence to question the
 consolidation of the concrete, the Department will require the following procedure. Provide
 suitable facilities to provide safe access to the Work for inspection. Follow one (1) or more of
 the following inspection procedures a minimum of two (2) Days after placing the deck
 concrete:
 1.
 
 Test the forms for soundness of the concrete and bonding to the concrete by striking
 a sharp blow to the form with a geologist hammer as and when ordered by the
 Project Manager. Provide the geologist hammer.
 
 2.
 
 As a minimum, strike forms at ten (10) foot intervals parallel to and six (6) inches
 from the edge of the steel beam and at ten (10) foot intervals along the centerline of
 each bay between the beams in an “X” pattern with those along the beams. Strike
 forms at random points on a semicircle or circle as applicable on approximately a
 two (2) foot radius from the above points. Strike forms in other places as directed
 by the Project Manager to define suspicious or defective areas.
 
 3.
 
 Sound areas where efflorescence is evident in accordance with item No. 2 of this
 list.
 
 Repair defective areas as directed by the Project Manager at no expense to the
 Department.
 512.3.5
 
 Placing of Reinforcing Bars
 
 Firmly support reinforcing bars in deck slabs with approved devices spaced at intervals
 not exceeding 3.3 ft. Securely tie down reinforcing bar mats in Bridge decks to girders and
 forms to prevent upward movement during concrete placement.
 Do not allow the spacing between adjacent reinforcement bars to vary more than 1/2 inch
 from the dimensions shown in the Contract. Place and maintain reinforcement bars within
 1/4 inch of the vertical dimensions shown in the Contract. Do not allow the concrete cover
 over the top layers of reinforcement to be less than two (2) inches.
 For continuous steel Bridges, complete the forming and placing of reinforcing steel and
 screed rail settings for the entire length of the Bridge before proceeding with any portion of the
 deck placement, unless otherwise authorized by the State Bridge Engineer.
 512.3.6
 
 Preparation for Placing Concrete
 
 512.3.6.1
 
 Support of Finishing Machines
 
 Ensure finishing machines travel on steel rails. Provide pipe for rails with 2 3/8 inch
 outside diameter and 1 15/16 inch inside or heavier. Firmly support rails on adjustable steel
 supports. Securely fasten supports in place and do not space them more than 30 inches
 apart. The Department will not allow the Contractor to weld the supports to top flanges of
 steel girders or girders, or to the stirrups of concrete girders.
 512.3.6.2
 
 Setting of Screed Rails
 
 Set the steel rails for placing and finishing Equipment to finish the deck in accordance
 with the Contract or as directed by the Project Manager. Make the accuracy of setting the rails
 consistent with the required tolerances for smoothness. Check elevations and straightness of
 Section 512:
 
 Superstructure Concrete
 
 Page 344
 
 the rails by survey, straight edging, or string lining, and sight by eye.
 If supporting the finishing machine over an outside girder, check edge forms for the deck
 for vertical alignment and install in accordance with the Contract tolerances for smoothness.
 Provide rails that extend a sufficient distance beyond both ends of the scheduled length of
 placement to permit the finishing machine to reach all areas of the concrete placed and to
 permit off-deck parking of the machine out of the way of the hand finishers. Check the
 finishing machine setup for correct deck cross sections. Check blockouts for expansion joints
 for proper depths and widths of openings.
 512.3.6.3
 
 Finish Machine Trial Run
 
 At least 24 h before placing concrete, traverse the finish machine the length of the
 proposed placement or, if a continuous steel Bridge, for the full length of the Bridge.
 Demonstrate that the following performance criteria are met during the trial run:
 1.
 
 Use of required deck slab thickness, top of deck elevations, and the specified
 reinforcing bar cover; unless otherwise noted on the Plans, provide cover to the top
 of the top reinforcing bars of from 2 (two) inches to 2 7/16 inches. When checking
 the deck slab thickness, top of deck elevations, and cover, allow for deflections of
 supports resulting from the weight of the concrete;
 
 2.
 
 Do not allow screed rails to deflect excessively;
 
 3.
 
 The finishing machine is properly adjusted and in good working order; and
 
 4.
 
 The finishing machine will properly track over the entire length of the proposed
 placement, particularly for decks that are curved, super-elevated, or that have a high
 skew.
 
 512.3.6.4
 
 Work Bridges
 
 Provide one (1) or two (2) transverse work Bridges for floating, straight edging, and
 curing operations. Provide work Bridges that are structurally sound and do not deflect
 excessively. Test the work Bridges in place before the deck placement to ensure proper
 adjustments of wheels, adequate clearances to safety railings, and compliance with other
 requirements.
 512.3.7
 
 Placing of Concrete
 
 Place concrete by pumping or other approved means.
 Place concrete close to the final position and to the full thickness of the slab. Place
 concrete far enough in front of the finishing machine to ensure proper striking off and finishing,
 generally a distance not greater than 12 ft.
 Unless otherwise directed by the Project Manager, compact concrete with suitable
 mechanical vibrators operating within the concrete. During concrete placement, keep enough
 personnel, vibrators, and other tools available to assure adequate consolidation. If necessary,
 supplement vibrating with hand spading with suitable tools to assure proper consolidation. If
 using vibrators, use procedures in accordance with ACI 309.
 Do not use a “jitterbug” or any other flat tool that could cause concrete segregation.
 Use approved vibrators that can transmit vibration at frequencies up to 10,000 vpm.
 Provide vibrators that have each been certified within the last 90 Days to provide 8,000 to
 10,000 vpm.
 Operate vibrators to consolidate the concrete thoroughly around the reinforcement and
 embedded fixtures and into corners and angles of the forms. Do not use vibrators to make
 concrete flow or run. Vibrate long enough to accomplish consolidation, but do not vibrate so
 long to cause segregation or air bubbles. Insert the vibrators vertically into the concrete, and
 immediately withdraw upward along the same line with the opposite motion. Do not drag the
 vibrator horizontally across the placing area.
 Section 512:
 
 Superstructure Concrete
 
 Page 345
 
 When operating vibrators, avoid contact with reinforcing bars, particularly epoxy coated
 reinforcing bars or bars that extend into concrete that has taken an initial set. If vibrating
 concrete in areas reinforced with epoxy-coated bars, cover the vibrators with nonmetallic
 sleeves to prevent damage to the epoxy coating.
 If hydraulic fluid, motor oil, dirt, or other Deleterious Material leaks or falls onto the deck,
 remove contaminated concrete from the deck before proceeding.
 Place concrete for abutment and/or pier diaphragms monolithically with Bridge deck; no
 exceptions.
 512.3.7.1 Pumping of Concrete
 Before placing concrete, thoroughly clean the Equipment. Operate the pump to produce
 a continuous stream of concrete without air pockets and no appreciable loss of slump.
 If placing concrete by pumping, do not add water at the concrete entrance hopper. If
 adding water at the pump hopper to clear a clogged pump, remove and dispose of concrete in
 the hopper and the line.
 Obtain the Project Manager's approval of concrete pumping Equipment before use.
 Provide a backup placement system capable of completing concrete placement to a bulkhead
 in case of a pump failure. Provide bulkheads that are pre-cut and ready for installation.
 Do not use aluminum pipe as a conduit for concrete placement.
 The Department will test concrete for Acceptance at the discharge end of the pump, and
 collect samples from concrete placed on the deck.
 512.3.7.2
 
 Delays in Deck Placement
 
 Stop placement operations and correct, if one (1) of the following problems occur:
 1.
 
 A deck-finishing machine fails;
 
 2.
 
 Placement operations are not within the specification requirements; or
 
 3.
 
 Placement operations are not achieving satisfactory results.
 
 If the concrete placement is delayed, stop all other placement operations until the cause
 of the Delay is corrected.
 If the Contractor fails to correct the problem within 45 min (or within 60 min if using a set
 retardant), erect a bulkhead parallel to the finishing operations and as close as practical to the
 location that placement originally stopped. Finish concrete to the bulkhead and discontinue
 placement operations for the Day. Before deck placement, cut the bulkhead to length and slot
 it for reinforcing bars.
 For slab Bridges, install the bulkhead as close to one (1) of a span’s quarter points as
 possible.
 If deck placement operations have been suspended and bulkheads installed, do not
 resume deck construction until after 12 h and after taking adequate corrective measures to
 ensure concrete mixing, placement, finishing, and curing are performed in accordance with the
 Contract, as approved by the District Construction Engineer.
 512.3.7.3
 
 Rate of Evaporation Limitations
 
 Comply with Section 511.3.7.5 Evaporation Potential.
 512.3.7.3
 
 Rate of Progress
 
 Section 512:
 
 Superstructure Concrete
 
 Page 346
 
 Provide a rate of progress of Bridge deck placement in accordance with the Contract. If
 the Contract does not define a rate, the rate of progress will be at least 30 ft per hour over the
 entire width of the deck, except for slab Bridges, for which the rate will be at least 20 ft per
 hour.
 If the placement includes integral pier or abutment diaphragms, do not include the time
 required to place the diaphragms in the rate of placement calculations. Include Delays in the
 placement due to other causes in the calculation of the overall rate of pour.
 The Department may reject decks placed at rates slower than specified.
 The Project Manager may decrease the rate of placement by 25%, if the following
 conditions exist:
 1.
 
 The rate of evaporation is less than 0.8 lb per square foot per hour;
 
 2.
 
 The wind velocity on the deck is less than ten (10) mph; and
 
 3.
 
 The Contractor is producing an acceptable finish.
 
 512.3.7.4
 
 Concrete Placement in Girders
 
 Unless otherwise approved by the District Construction Engineer, uniformly deposit
 concrete in girders the full length of the girder and bring up evenly in horizontal layers not
 exceeding two (20 ft in depth.
 512.3.8
 
 Temperature and Weather Limitations
 
 512.3.8.1
 
 Temperature Requirements
 
 See Section 511.3.3, “Temperature and Weather Limitations.”
 512.3.8.2
 
 Change in Weather Conditions
 
 The Contractor shall assume the risk of proceeding with deck placement during marginal
 weather. Repair or remove and replace concrete damaged due to changing weather
 conditions.
 After placement operations have started, if weather conditions change causing
 evaporation rates to exceed those previously specified or if other adverse weather conditions
 arise, immediately place an emergency bulkhead, finish concrete to the bulkhead, and
 discontinue placement operations for the Day.
 Keep Materials available to cover and protect unfinished deck areas and completed deck
 areas ahead of and behind the finishing machine as the machine moves forward to the
 bulkhead.
 512.3.9
 
 Finishing
 
 Ensure that the rideability, drainage, and surface texture characteristics of finished Bridge
 deck slabs meet the requirements specified.
 Provide deck with smooth transitions at ends of Bridges and across expansion and
 construction joints. Provide deck that is free draining, with no depressions.
 Unless otherwise specified in the Contract or approved in writing by the District
 Construction Engineer, operate finishing machines with the skew of the Structure. Float and
 broom the plastic concrete parallel to the finishing operation.
 The Contractor will provide a ten10 foot long, lightweight, round-bottom, straightedge
 equipped with a long handle, as approved by the Project Manager.
 Do not add water to the surface of the concrete to assist finishing.
 Section 512:
 
 Superstructure Concrete
 
 Page 347
 
 512.3.9.1
 
 Finishing Machine
 
 Finish Bridge deck slabs and approach slabs with approved power driven finishing
 machines, unless the use of such machines is impractical and the District Construction
 Engineer provides a written waiver.
 Use finishing machines with one (1) or more rotating rollers, augers, and vibratory pans
 providing from 2,500 vpm to 4,000 vpm.
 512.3.9.2
 
 Finishing of Slab Edges
 
 If an exterior beam or girder supports a finishing machine, the Contractor may hand finish
 the deck slab between the exterior beam or girder and the edge of the deck slab.
 512.3.9.3
 
 Hand Finishing Plan Submittal
 
 The Contractor may finish the concrete deck slabs by hand if the use of a finishing
 machine is not possible. Submit a hand-finishing plan to the Project Manager for approval
 before initiating placement operations. The plan will describe the screed arrangement and
 proposed methods of finishing.
 512.3.9.4
 
 Final Finishing Operations
 
 Immediately following the initial finishing operations and while the concrete is still plastic,
 test the slab surface for trueness in accordance with Section 512.3.10.2, “Acceptance
 Criteria,” by using the straightedge as a float. Advance the straightedge longitudinally along
 the slab in successive stages not more than 1/2 the length of the straightedge.
 Correct variations in the surface of the slab by striking off projections and filling
 depressions with freshly mixed concrete. Consolidate and refinish the corrected areas with a
 long handled float at least three (3) ft in width.
 The Contractor may use small hand floats if approved by the Project Manager. Recheck
 the surface with a straightedge.
 During the floating and straight-edging process, check and ensure that the deck has the
 proper crown, slope, and grade. Construct deck surfaces in the vicinity of deck drains to slope
 gently toward the drains.
 The Contractor may use a float three (3) ft or greater in width to seal the surface behind
 the finishing machine.
 Final finishing operations will follow the trailing edge of the finishing machine closely,
 generally, at a distance of 13 ft or less. Do not allow more than one (1) h to elapse between
 the time of placement of concrete on the deck and the completion of final finishing operations.
 Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, apply a broomed finish to the plastic concrete
 parallel to the finishing operation.
 512.3.10
 512.3.10.1
 
 Final Operations
 Curing
 
 Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, cure Bridge decks and approach slabs in
 accordance with Section 511.3.9, “Curing.” Ensure forms supporting Bridge decks remain in
 place for at least seven (7) Days.
 512.3.10.2
 
 Acceptance Criteria
 
 Test the smoothness of the completed Roadway surfaces of Bridge decks, approach
 Section 512:
 
 Superstructure Concrete
 
 Page 348
 
 slabs, and the adjoining 50 ft of approach pavement. After the concrete of Bridge decks,
 approach slabs, and pavement hardens, check the entire surface areas with a ten (10) foot
 straightedge. Hold the straightedge in successive positions parallel to the centerline of the
 Roadway and in contact with the slab. Advance the straightedge longitudinally along the slab
 in successive stages no greater than half the length of the straightedge.
 Provide a finished surface plane of Bridge decks and approach slabs that do not vary
 more than 3/16 inch, measured from the bottom of the straightedge. Provide a finished
 surface of concrete or asphalt approaches that does not vary more than 1/4 inch, measured
 from the bottom of the straightedge. Plainly mark variations that exceed the allowable values.
 Ensure that vertical steps or discontinuities at the ends of Bridges and approach slabs do
 not exceed 3/16 inch. Place expansion joints below grade, from1/16 inch to 3/16 inch. The
 Department will reject expansion joints installed at elevations above the Roadway grade.
 Remove smaller discontinuities or high spots greater than 3/16 inch by rubbing with
 carborundum brick and water. Correct larger areas of deck requiring repair by use of power
 grinders or similar tools approved by the Project Manager. The Department will not allow the
 use of a bush hammer or similar tools to remove irregularities. When grinding, do not reduce
 the concrete cover over the reinforcing steel to less than 1 9/16 inch. If diamond grinding
 cannot satisfactorily correct portions of decks, remove and replace them at no additional cost
 to the Department.
 After rubbing and diamond grinding, restore the curing system on the deck as necessary.
 The District Construction Engineer may direct the Contractor to remove and replace
 unacceptable areas under the following conditions, at no additional cost to the Department:
 1.
 
 The finished deck surface is exceedingly rough;
 
 2.
 
 Plastic shrinkage cracking or surface tearing is severe; or
 
 3.
 
 Serious damage due to any cause occurs over large areas of the deck placement.
 
 512.3.10.3
 
 Grooving of Hardened Concrete
 
 Straightedge and repair the Bridge deck before grooving. Do not groove the deck before
 the end of the concrete curing period.
 512.3.10.3.1
 
 Grooving Machine
 
 Groove hardened concrete with diamond blades mounted on a multiblade arbor on a selfpropelled machine built for grooving concrete pavements. Provide a grooving machine with
 the following:
 1.
 
 A depth control device that detects variations in the concrete surface and adjusts
 the cutting head height to maintain the specified groove depth; and
 
 2.
 
 A device to control alignment.
 
 512.3.10.3.2
 
 Groove Pattern
 
 Groove the Bridge decks parallel to the centerline of the Roadway if Bridge decks abut
 concrete pavement that is to receive longitudinal grooving, or if specified in the Contract.
 Otherwise cut grooves perpendicular to the centerline of the Roadway.
 Begin grooving 18 inches from the gutter line or face of rail and run in a continuous
 pattern to 18 inches from the opposite gutter line or face of rail. The Contractor may increase
 the 18 inch dimension on one (1) side of the deck to as much as 27 inches, if the clearance of
 the grooving machine does not allow a closer approach to the railing.
 Provide grooves that begin and end within from two (2) inches to four (4) inches of
 expansion joints, contraction joints, and ends of the slab.
 Section 512:
 
 Superstructure Concrete

 517.3.6
 
 Precast Concrete Member Assembly
 
 517.3.6.1
 
 Beds and Forms
 
 Use forms that are smooth, mortar tight, and capable of withstanding forces caused by
 placement and consolidation of concrete. Accurately fabricate and secure forms in position
 so that the precast member has true, smooth, and even surfaces. Provide support for casting
 beds on unyielding foundations. The Department will not allow internal bracing and holding
 devices in forms if they remain in the finished member.
 Provide corners with a chamfer or radius in accordance with the Plans.
 Check the grade and alignment of forms each time they are set, and maintain them
 during concrete placement.
 Ensure forms are reasonably free of rust, grease, or other Deleterious Materials.
 Thoroughly clean beds and forms after each use and before each casting operation. Do not
 allow coatings used for release of members to build up. Maintain beds and forms to produce
 an acceptable product.
 Construct the forms to facilitate removal without damage to the concrete. Use care in
 removing forms to not deface or damage the member. Do not use methods of removal that
 cause overstressing of the concrete.
 517.3.6.2
 
 Forms for Internal Voids
 
 If constructing forms for internal voids, use an approved watertight material that is
 resistant to breakage and deformation during concrete placement. Provide stay-in-place
 internal forms that are as light in weight as practical. Securely anchor internal forms in
 position to prevent flotation or displacement during concrete placement.
 Vent and drain stay-in-place void forms through the base of the member. Seal splices
 and ends of stay-in-place void forms to prevent concrete from entering.
 Manufacture internal voids shaped by moving mandrels in accordance with the same
 dimensional tolerances as formed voids. The timing and rate of mandrel movement will
 preclude fallout of inner surfaces, tensile cracks, and the separation of concrete from
 reinforcing.
 Section 517:
 
 Precast Concrete Structures
 
 Page 360
 
 517.3.6.3
 
 Placement of Reinforcing Bars
 
 Accurately place and secure reinforcing bars in accordance with the Plans, and methods
 approved by the Project Manager and Precast Inspector. Pay particular attention to concrete
 cover requirements over reinforcing bars. Provide lap splices in accordance with the
 approved drawings, and fasten them securely.
 517.3.6.4
 
 Placement and Consolidation of Concrete
 
 Place concrete in accordance with Section 511, “Concrete Structures,” unless otherwise
 specified in this section.
 Before placing concrete, correct deficiencies found by the Inspector.
 To ensure that
 similar deficiencies do no recur, implement Quality Control procedures satisfactory to the
 Inspector.
 Use internal vibration to eliminate honeycombing. Attach a sufficient number of external
 vibrators rigidly to the forms so that the vibrations extend throughout the entire length and
 volume of the member.
 The Department will not allow vibrating methods that cause segregation. The
 Department will reject members with voids or honeycombing that exposes reinforcement.
 517.3.6.5
 
 Tolerances
 
 The maximum allowable deviations from the dimension and details shown in the
 Contract are listed in the Manual for Quality Control for Plants and Production of Precast and
 Prestressed Concrete Products, published by the PCI.
 517.3.6.6
 
 Curing
 
 Cure precast members in accordance with Section 511, “Concrete Structures.”
 Contractor may use steam, in accordance with Section 517.3.6.6.1, “Steam Curing.”
 
 The
 
 Before placing concrete, submit the proposed curing methods and procedures to the
 Project Manager or the Inspector for approval. Test elevated-temperature curing facilities for
 a minimum of 48 h before approval. Make curing Equipment and Materials for curing
 available before casting.
 The Project Manager or Inspector will suspend concrete placement if curing facilities are
 inadequate or the Contractor is not attending to the proper curing of the concrete. Placement
 may resume after the Contractor makes the appropriate corrections.
 Begin curing as soon as possible but not more than two (2) hours after casting. To
 prevent damage and discoloration of a concrete member, do not allow mats, sheets, or
 blankets to contact the concrete member.
 The Contractor may remove forms after the concrete has reached sufficient strength in
 accordance with the Specifications for the item being cast. Do not interrupt the curing of
 members for more than 30 min when removing forms.
 517.3.6.6.1
 
 Steam Curing
 
 If steam curing; enclose the member entirely within an approved and supported
 enclosure so that a clear space forms around the sides, ends, and top of the member.
 After placement and vibration of the concrete, allow it to attain its initial set before
 applying steam. Prevent surface drying during the period between placement of concrete and
 application of steam by applying coatings, a membrane curing compound, moisture retention
 covers, or other equivalent methods.
 Section 517:
 
 Precast Concrete Structures
 
 Page 361
 
 Ensure that the rate of temperature rise and the maximum temperature, in combination
 with the cement used in the concrete mix, does not promote or initiate delayed ettringite
 formation.
 Equip each enclosure with accurate temperature recording devices spaced at no more
 than 100-foot intervals to keep continuous hourly records.
 If the air temperature is 40 °F or greater, do not admit steam fog to the enclosure for a
 period of from two (2) h to six (6) h after final placement of concrete into the forms, to allow
 the initial set to take place. Maintain the steam fog surrounding the member at a temperature
 between 120 °F and 165 °F until the member attains the required strength.
 If the air temperature is less than 40 °F, admit steam no hotter than 120 °F to the
 enclosure immediately. Allow the two (2) to (6) hour initial setting period to elapse before
 raising the steam temperature to the specified curing temperature range.
 Admit steam into the enclosure at a low pressure and in a saturated condition. Position
 steam jets so they do not discharge directly onto the concrete, forms, or test cylinders.
 Carefully check the housing to ensure uniform distribution of steam fog and uniform
 application of heat and moisture.
 When discontinuing the steam, decrease the temperature of the air surrounding the
 member at a nearly constant rate not to exceed 70 °F per hour until it reaches a temperature
 50 °F above the temperature of the surrounding air. At that time, terminate the steam curing.
 Maintain the temperature of the member above 35 °F for four (4) consecutive Days after
 completion of steam curing.
 Remove side forms from six (6) h to two (2) Days after completing the pour. Loosen or
 remove steel side forms as early as practical to prevent damaging the concrete. The
 Contractor may interrupt curing briefly for this purpose as long as the surrounding air
 temperature does not drop below 40 °F.
 517.3.7
 
 Workmanship
 
 The Department will not reject Work because of fine cracks on the surface of the
 member that do not extend to the plane of the nearest reinforcement unless they are
 numerous and extensive. For members with diagonal cracks, which indicate damage from
 torsion, the Department will perform a structural review before accepting.
 Repair cracks that extend into the plane of the reinforcing steel (but are acceptable
 otherwise) by sealing with an approved epoxy or other approved material.
 Repair defective areas or surfaces needing patching using approved methods. Do not
 plaster over defective areas.
 Unless otherwise noted, provide finishes in accordance with Section 511.3.8.2, “Class 1,
 Ordinary Surface Finish,” or Section 511.3.8.3, “Class 2, Rubbed Surface Finish,” except for
 temporary Structures which will require a Class 1 finish. Provide a Class 2 surface finish for
 visual surface defects/pitting on Structures other than temporary Structures.
 517.3.8
 
 Lifting, Handling, Storing, and Shipping Precast Members
 
 Avoid chipping, cracking, fracturing, and excessive bending stresses when lifting,
 handling, storing, and shipping members. Support members on firm blocks. During handling
 and storage, keep the members vertical and the long axis approximately level. Make the
 points of support and direction of reactions with respect to the member approximately the
 same as when the member is in its final position in the completed Structure or application.
 Handle or support the items securely in an upright position.
 Use care during lifting, handling, hauling, storing, erecting, and driving to prevent
 cracking, spalling, or other damage to the member. Replace members damaged by improper
 Section 517:

 handling methods.
 Verify lifting devices for capacity in lifting and handling products, taking into account
 various positions during handling. Do not allow lifting devices to project above the surface of
 the member after placement unless the lifting devices will:
 1.
 
 Be embedded in a subsequent concrete pour;
 
 2.
 
 Have a concrete cover of at least two (2) inches; and
 
 3.
 
 Not interfere with the placement of reinforcing steel or concrete.
 
 Stack members in storage only with approval of the Project Manager and the Precast
 Inspector. Keep members covered and protected until installed.
 Do not subject members to heavy loads until the members have attained the specified
 28-Day strength.
 517.3.9 Installation

 518.3
 
 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 
 518.3.1
 
 Precast Concrete Institute Certified Plant
 
 All prestressed concrete structural members shall be manufactured in a plant certified by
 the Precast Concrete Institute (PCI). The manufacturer must have a B4 Certification for
 Prestressed Deflected-Strand Bridge Member. Certifications must be maintained throughout
 the production of prestressed concrete structural members. Production will immediately stop if
 at any time the manufacturer’s certification is revoked, regardless of the status of completion
 of contracted Work. Production will not be allowed to re-start until the necessary corrections
 are made and certification has been re-established.
 The Department will not be responsible for time, additional compensation or other Project
 impacts due to lack of certification.
 518.3.1.1
 
 Approval of Plants and Equipment
 
 The State Bridge Engineer or the Department’s Inspector must approve plants and
 Equipment for manufacturing pre-stressed concrete members before the Contractor starts the
 pre-stressed concrete Work. The State Bridge Engineer or the Department’s Inspector may
 forbid unsatisfactory machinery, Equipment, or appurtenances.
 518.3.2
 518.3.2.1
 
 Fabrication
 Forms
 
 Use forms that are smooth, mortar tight, and capable of withstanding the action of form
 vibrators. Accurately fabricate and secure the forms in position so that the cast member will
 present true, smooth, and even surfaces.
 Construct forms for interior cellular spaces with an approved material that is watertight,
 resistant to breakage and deformation, and as lightweight as possible. Anchor interior forms
 to resist flotation or displacement during concrete placement. The design of interior and
 exterior forms shall not restrict the longitudinal movement of the member when the Contractor
 transfers the pre-stressing force to the casting.
 518.3.2.2
 
 Placement of Reinforcing Bars and Appurtenances
 
 Place and secure reinforcing bars, forms for cored holes and cellular spaces with
 methods approved by the State Bridge Engineer. Pay particular attention to concrete cover
 requirements over reinforcing bars near and at ends of girders.
 Section 518:
 
 Pre-Stressed Concrete Members
 
 Page 367
 
 518.3.2.4
 
 Placement and Consolidation of Concrete
 
 Place concrete in accordance with Section 511, “Concrete Structures,” and Section 512,
 “Superstructure Concrete.”
 Do not place concrete until the Inspector has inspected and approved the placement of
 the items to be embedded in the concrete. Place and secure shoe plates on girders in the
 exact position in accordance with the Plans.
 The Department will allow the placement of concrete in the bottom flange of precast box
 girders before placement of the interior form and reinforcing bars in the upper portion of the
 members, if concrete placement is continuous for longer than 30 min.
 Use external vibration for precast box girders or to eliminate internal honeycombing.
 Rigidly attach external vibrators to the forms in sufficient quantity so that the vibration extends
 throughout the entire length of the member.
 Do not use vibrating methods that cause segregation. The Department may reject
 members with voids in piles or in the bottoms of girders and girders or over bearing points, or
 honeycombing sufficient to expose pre-stressing tendons or reinforcement.
 The maximum allowable deviations from the dimensions and details shown in the
 Contract including camber and sweep will be the dimensional tolerances listed in the Manual
 for Quality Control for Plants and Production of Precast and Prestressed Concrete Products
 published by PCI, except as follows:
 1.
 
 The tolerance on tipping and flushness of shoe plates within 1/16 inch.
 
 2.
 
 The tolerance of steel diaphragms attachment holes shall be no greater than 1/16
 inch.
 
 518.3.2.5
 
 Finishing Concrete Surfaces
 
 Score top surfaces of girders transversely over the entire flange width to a minimum
 depth of 1/4 inch and a maximum of 3/8 inch. Clean the top surface of girders after initial set
 to remove laitance, dirt and debris and to provide a rough surface.
 Finish the top surface of precast box girders and piles by over filling the forms, vibrating,
 and striking off with a metal plated strike board. On the final forward movement of the strike
 board, carry excess mortar ahead to completely fill the form. After striking off the concrete,
 finish the surface to a true plane. Ensure that surface irregularities do not exceed 9/16 inch
 per ten (10) ft. Unless otherwise shown in the Contract, give the top surface of the precast
 box girders a final broomed finish to produce transverse corrugations.
 If the Contract requires the Contractor to embed the ends of pre-stressed concrete
 girders in concrete diaphragms, the ends of the girders do not require hand finishing after
 removal of forms. If the Contract does not require the Contractor to extend strands for field or
 shop bending to provide continuity reinforcement, the Contractor shall cut the strands three
 (3) inches or less beyond the girder ends.
 Finish girder ends that will not be embedded in concrete and other surfaces of prestressed Bridge members in accordance with Section 511.3.8, “Finishing.”
 518.3.2.6
 
 Curing
 
 Steam cure or water cure precast, pre-stressed members. Do not use a curing
 temperature greater than 160 oF. Uniformly increase the temperature to the maximum
 temperature over a period not less than seven (7) hours. Additionally uniformly reduce the
 curing temperature such that at least seven (7) hours are required to reduce the temperature
 of the curing environment.
 Perform steam curing in accordance with Section 517, “Precast Concrete Structures.”
 Section 518:
 
 Pre-Stressed Concrete Members
 
 Page 368
 
 Perform water curing in accordance with Section 511, “Concrete Structures.”
 518.3.2.7
 
 Lifting, Handling, Storing and Transporting Precast Members
 
 Do not handle members until after applying the pre-stressing force.
 At all times keep webs of pre-stressed girders vertical and keep the long axis
 approximately level. Keep the points of support and direction of reactions in accordance with
 approved shop drawings.
 Limit the camber growth to a value not to exceed the predicted camber at erection
 dimension by two (2) inches at the time of deck slab placement. Camber growth is to be
 limited by methods such as weighting, fabrication scheduling or other acceptable means.
 Submit plan for review to the State Bridge Engineer prior to limiting camber growth. The plan
 must be prepared by a Professional Engineer licensed in the State of New Mexico.
 Lift girders for handling, transport and erection by means of devices designed or
 recommended by the Fabricator and approved by the State Bridge Engineer prior to use.
 Do not crack, spall, or otherwise damage members during lifting, handling, hauling,
 storing, erecting, or transporting. Replace members damaged by improper handling.
 Do not transport members to the job site until the required ultimate compressive concrete
 strength is attained.
 518.3.2.3
 
 Tensioning
 
 Apply tension to pre-stressing steel with hydraulic jacks to produce forces in accordance
 with the approved Working Drawings.
 During strand stressing, the State Bridge Engineer or the Inspector may accept individual
 wire failures, if no more than one (1) wire in any strand is broken and the area of broken wires
 does not exceed two percent (2%) of the total area of the pre-stressing steel in the member.
 Stress the members in a sequence that produces a minimum of eccentric forces.
 518.3.2.3.1
 
 Tensioning Equipment
 
 Apply stress to tendons using hydraulic jacks that can provide and sustain the necessary
 forces and have either a pressure gauge or a load cell for determining jacking stresses.
 If necessary, use a pressure gauge with at least a six (6) inch diameter dial accompanied
 with a certified calibration chart. Calibrate each jack and its gauge as a unit with the cylinder
 extension in the approximate position that it will be at final jacking force.
 If necessary, calibrate a load cell and provide it with an indicator to determine the prestressing force in the tendon. Use a load cell range that does not include the lower ten
 percent (10%) of the Fabricator's rated capacity to determine the jacking stress.
 Use a testing Laboratory approved by the State Bridge Engineer to calibrate the
 Equipment. Ensure that the Equipment has been calibrated within a year of the Work. The
 Inspector may check certified calibration charts for the hydraulic jacks, pressure gages, or load
 cells used for tensioning pre-stressing steel before and during tensioning operations.
 518.3.2.3.2
 
 Measurement of Stress
 
 Provide a record of gauge pressures and tendon elongations for each tendon, for review
 and approval by the Department’s Inspector. Measure elongations to an accuracy of within
 1/16 inch. Do not cut off stressing tails of tendons until the Department's Inspector approves
 the stressing records.
 Section 518:
 
 Pre-Stressed Concrete Members
 
 Page 369
 
 Use the gauge or load cell readings to determine the stress in the tendons during
 tensioning and verify with the measured elongations.
 Use the modulus of elasticity to calculate anticipated elongations of and base calculations
 for the nominal area (provided by the Fabricator per lot of tensioned steel), or as determined
 by a bench test of strands used in the Work.
 Before starting elongation readings, tension the tendons to a preliminary force to
 eliminate take-up in the tensioning system. Ensure this preliminary force is between five (5)
 and 25% of the final jacking force. Measure the initial force with a dynamometer or with other
 approved methods. Mark each strand before the final stressing to permit measurement of
 elongation and to ensure that anchor wedges are set properly.
 Address a discrepancy in indicated stress between jack gauge pressure and elongation.
 If this occurs, the load used, as indicated by the gauge pressure, will produce a slight
 overstress rather than understress. Check the entire operation to determine the source of
 errors, if a discrepancy occurs between gauge pressure and elongation; more than five
 percent (5%) for tendons longer than 50 ft, or seven percent (7%) for tendons shorter than
 50 ft. Correct errors before proceeding.
 518.3.2.3.3
 
 Tensioning Pre-tensioned Members
 
 The Contractor may cast several members in a continuous line on the casting bed.
 Spools of pre-stressing strand are allowed two (2) splices within the entire spool. Do not
 use strands within each pre-stressed concrete member that have splices.
 Accurately locate and hold strands in positions in accordance with the Plans for each
 individual member. Modify the strand, if the State Bridge Engineer approves, to ensure that
 the total pre-stressing force and location of its center of application is not changed.
 The Contractor may anchor straight pre-tensioning strands at one end of the casting bed
 and stress the other end with hydraulic jacks. Tension each individual strand to the required
 stress. Adopt a method for stressing draped strands that prevents significant stress loss
 between the jacking and anchor ends of the casting bed. If required to avoid significant stress
 loss, stress draped strands from both ends of the casting bed.
 Stress or check pre-stressed strands for required stress within 24 h before placing
 concrete in the member.
 Do not release or cut pre-tensioned strands until cylinder tests indicate that the concrete
 in the member has reached the initial unit compressive strength. Remove side forms before
 releasing the strands. Strands may be flame cut to release stress. Release or cut the strands
 in accordance with a previously approved sequence to avoid unbalanced forces in excess of
 that applied by one (1) strand. Trim strands in piles flush with the top and bottom of the piles.
 518.3.3
 
 Bracing for Girders
 
 Tie and brace the girders immediately after erection to prevent overturning. Leave ties
 and bracing in place until the girders are permanently secured for lateral stability. If steel
 girder diaphragms are used, install diaphragms during girder erection.
 518.3.4
 
 Grouting Keyways in Precast Box Girders
 
 The keyways between adjacent precast box girders shall be grouted per Section 521
 “Non-Shrink Mortar”. The non-shrink mortar shall be commercial pre-blended non-shrink
 mortar that the Contractor only has to add water. The non-shrink mortar shall be from the
 Department’s Approved Product List.

 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 
 Section 519:
 
 Shotcrete
 
 Page 377
 
 519.3.1
 
 Equipment
 
 519.3.1.1
 
 Shotcrete Placing Equipment
 
 Apply wet mix shotcrete with one (1) of the following methods:
 1)
 
 The “thick-stream” method, which involves the use of a regular concrete pump with
 air addition at the discharge nozzle to pneumatically apply the shotcrete on the
 receiving surface. The “thick-stream” method usually uses a two (2) inch to
 2 1/2 inch internal diameter delivery hose.
 
 2)
 
 The “thin-stream” method, which normally involves the use of a pressurized
 chamber to pneumatically send the shotcrete down the delivery hose to the
 receiving surface. The “thin-stream” method normally uses a hose with a maximum
 1 1/2 inch internal diameter.
 
 Only use the “thin-stream” method for non-structural shotcrete if pre-construction testing
 confirms the capability to properly consolidate shotcrete, fully encase reinforcing steel, and
 produce a Material that meets the required hardened properties.
 Use shotcrete delivery Equipment in accordance with ACI 506R and that is capable of
 delivering a steady stream of uniformly mixed Material to the discharge nozzle at the proper
 velocity and rate of discharge.
 The preferred type of the wet-mix shotcrete delivery system uses positive displacement
 pumps equipped with hydraulic or mechanically powered pistons (similar to conventional
 concrete piston pumps), surge-reduction devices, and compressed air added at the discharge
 nozzle. The Contractor may use pneumatic-feed guns, rotary-type feed guns (similar to drymix guns), and peristaltic squeeze-type pumps if the Contractor demonstrates that the guns
 can produce shotcrete in accordance with the performance requirements and the Project
 Manager approves.
 Carefully monitor the air ring at the nozzle for signs of blockage of individual air holes. If
 non-uniform discharge of shotcrete becomes apparent, stop shooting and clean the air ring or
 take other appropriate corrective actions.
 Thoroughly clean the delivery Equipment at the end of each shift. Remove build-up of
 coatings in the delivery hose and nozzle liner. Regularly inspect the air ring and nozzle and
 replace as necessary.
 519.3.1.2
 
 Auxiliary Shotcrete Equipment
 
 Supply a clean, dry air supply capable of maintaining sufficient nozzle velocity and
 simultaneous operation of a blow pipe.
 Use an air supply system with a moisture and oil trap.
 Provide auxiliary shotcrete Equipment, such as air delivery hoses, blow pipes, couplings,
 admixture dispensers, and fiber feeders, in accordance with the recommendations of
 ACI 506R.
 519.3.2
 
 Batching and Mixing Shotcrete
 
 519.3.2.1
 
 Wet Mix Process
 
 Batch, mix, and supply wet mix shotcrete using one (1) of the following systems:
 1.
 
 Central Mixing with transit delivery; or
 
 2.
 
 Transit mixing and delivery.
 
 519.3.2.1.1
 Section 519:
 
 Central Mixing and Supply
 Shotcrete
 
 Page 378
 
 Batch and mix ingredients in accordance with Section 510. Provide inspected transit
 mixers in accordance with Section 510, “Portland Cement Concrete.”
 The Contractor may only re-temper the shotcrete once with superplasticizer added
 directly to the transit mixer during the period of discharge to maintain workability (slump) of
 shotcrete. Mix the shotcrete for a minimum period of 5 min at the rated mixing speed after
 adding the superplasticizer to the transit mixer.
 Shoot shotcrete within 90 min of adding mix water to the batch.
 shotcrete batch sizes per load to meet this requirement.
 519.3.2.1.2
 
 Use appropriate
 
 Transit Mixing and Supply
 
 Apply central mixing requirements to transit mixing, except add ingredients directly to the
 transit mixer, not the central mixer. Do not charge transit mixers to more than 70% of their
 rated capacity.
 519.3.2.2
 
 Dry Mix Process for Non-Structural Shotcrete
 
 Batch the cement and aggregate by weight directly at the Project site within the
 tolerances required in Section 510.
 Pre-dampen the dry mix before flow into the main hopper and immediately after flow out
 of the packaging to ensure uniform shotcrete free of dry pockets.
 Do not use pre-dampened cement/aggregate mixtures that are more than 90 min old or
 that are unable to produce the specified hardened properties.
 519.3.2.3
 
 Batching and Mixing Steel Fibers
 
 Submit the procedure used for adding steel fibers to the shotcrete to the Project Manager
 for approval. Demonstrate the procedure in the field to the satisfaction of the Project Manager
 before starting production operations.
 If fiber addition takes place at the nozzle, uniformly distribute fibers throughout the mortar
 matrix without isolated concentrations (clumping or balling).
 If adding fibers to the dry or wet mix during the batching and mixing process, use a
 screen with a mesh of from 1 1/2 inch to 2 1/2 inch to prevent fiber balls from entering the
 shotcrete line. The Department will not require batching through a screen if the Contractor
 demonstrates that fiber balls are not forming.
 Do not add fibers to the dry or wet mix too quickly (so they can be blended with the other
 ingredients without forming balls or clumps). Use a vibrating screen or sift to pass bulk fibers
 (that have a tendency to stick) into the mix as individual elements and not as clumps.
 519.3.2.4
 
 Preparation and Hardware
 
 519.3.2.4.1
 
 Subsurface Preparation
 
 Locate and remove loose, spalled, deteriorated, and delaminated concrete, stone, or
 other substrate. Use hammer sounding to locate specific de-laminated areas of concrete or
 rock. Do not damage areas of sound concrete or reinforcing steel during concrete removal
 operations.
 Remove concrete using one (1) or more of the following methods:
 1.
 
 Chip with light duty pneumatic, or electric, chipping hammers (not to exceed 15 lb);
 
 2.
 
 Scarifiers, scabblers or other suitable mechanical means;
 
 3.
 
 High-pressure (15,000 psi to 40,000 psi) water jetting. (If using water jetting, do not
 allow water to collect so that surrounding areas are not contaminated or damaged.)
 
 Section 519:
 
 Shotcrete
 
 Page 379
 
 If the Contractor exposes corroded reinforcing steel, the Contractor shall continue
 concrete removal until there is a minimum 3/4 inch clearance around the exposed, corroded
 reinforcing bar. Do not damage the bond to adjacent non-exposed reinforcing steel during
 concrete removal.
 Taper the perimeter of removed concrete areas at approximately 45° angles. Sawcut the
 outer edges of chipped areas to a minimum depth of 3/4 inch to avoid feather edging.
 Use abrasive blast cleaning to remove fractured surface concrete and traces of unsound
 material or contaminants, such as oil, grease, dirt, slurry or Materials that could interfere with
 the bond of the freshly placed shotcrete. Apply shotcrete to abrasive blast cleaned areas
 within 48 h or re-blast them.
 The Project Manager may waive the requirement for abrasive blast cleaning where the
 Contractor performed concrete removal with high-pressure water blasting and the prepared
 surface is free of residual slurry or other material detrimental to an acceptable shotcrete bond.
 Install reinforcement in slope blankets that do not contain steel reinforcement. Unless
 otherwise specified, the reinforcement will consist of No. 4 steel reinforcing bars placed with
 maximum spacing of 12 inch for vertical and horizontal bars. Rigidly attach this reinforcement
 to the underlying forms or concrete Structure. Remove dust, debris, or laitance generated by
 this process in accordance with these abrasive blast cleaning procedures.
 519.3.2.4.2
 
 Repair or Replacement of Steel Reinforcement
 
 If the Contractor exposes corroded reinforcing steel during concrete removal, remove
 corrosion using abrasive grit blasting.
 Remove and replace reinforcing steel displaying deep pitting or loss of more than 20% of
 cross-sectional area as directed by the Project Manager.
 If pitting is isolated, reinforce the steel by adding appropriately placed reinforcing bars of
 suitable length (the existing reinforcing steel need not be cut).
 519.3.2.4.3
 
 Steel Reinforcement
 
 Use a minimum lap splice length of reinforcing steel that is in accordance with the
 AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specification. Place these bars in accordance with ACI 506R,
 Sections 5.4 and 5.5. In particular, do not bundle bars in lapped splices; place them so the
 minimum spacing around each bar is three (3) times the maximum aggregate size to allow for
 proper shotcrete encapsulation.
 Tightly secure intersecting reinforcing steel bars to each other using 12 gauge or heavier
 tie wire and adequately support them to minimize vibration during shotcrete placement.
 Place welded wire mesh fabric in accordance with the Contract. Lap sheets of adjoining
 mesh by at least two (2) spaces in both directions at intersections, and securely fasten.
 Fasten mesh to preset or existing anchors and reinforce using 12 gauge or heavier tie
 wire on a grid not less than 12 inch2. Avoid large knots of tie wire that could result in sand
 pockets and voids during shotcreting.
 Provide a minimum clearance of 3/4 inch behind installed reinforcing steel or mesh and
 existing concrete forms or bare rock.
 519.3.2.4.4
 
 Structural Anchors
 
 Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, place anchor bars (for structural applications)
 at a maximum spacing of 24 inches on a grid pattern over the entire area.
 Section 519:
 
 Shotcrete
 
 Page 380
 
 Provide the types of anchors in accordance with the Contract and either mechanically set
 or grout, as specified.
 Ensure anchors develop the minimum pullout force in accordance with the Contract.
 Randomly test anchors at a frequency in accordance with the Contract to verify pullout force.
 The Department will not accept a pull out force less than 150 lb. If anchors fail to meet the
 minimum acceptable pullout value, remove and replace immediately and take corrective
 action. Also, test the anchors in the same relative location as those that failed. The Project
 Manager will determine the area for corrective measures.
 519.3.2.4.5
 
 Non-Structural Anchors
 
 For non-structural applications (slope blankets, etc.), install anchor bars at ten (10) foot
 centers on a grid pattern over the entire area in one (1) inch diameter holes drilled into the
 rock or soil approximately 24 inches deep.
 Completely fill the drilled hole with neat cement grout using a grout tube extending to the
 bottom of the hole.
 Push the anchor bar into the grout-filled hole and center it such that the short leg of the
 “L”-shaped bar points upward and parallel to the slope and is located approximately
 1 1/2 inches from the rock or soil surface.
 519.3.2.4.6
 
 Weep Holes
 
 For slope blankets, provide weep holes throughout the shotcrete mat on maximum ten
 (10) foot centers, horizontally and vertically.
 The weep hole drains will consist of two (2) inch diameter Schedule 40 PVC slotted
 drainpipe, two (2) feet in length, placed within predrilled holes and sloped five percent (5%) to
 drain. The exposed end will extend from one (1) inch to three (3) inch outside the slope.
 The Department will not allow pre-drilled holes with diameters larger than three
 (3) inches.
 Install the slotted drainpipe before placing shotcrete. During placement of shotcrete,
 protect weep holes and drainpipes against contamination.
 519.3.2.4.7
 
 Alignment Control and Cover
 
 Implement alignment control (to establish control over line and grade), and maintain the
 minimum specified shotcrete thickness and cover of reinforcing steel.
 Perform alignment control with shooting wires (also called ground wires), guide strips,
 depth gauges, or forms. Submit the proposed means of alignment control to the Project
 Manager for review and approval.
 Use shooting wires that are at least “piano wire”–sized high-strength steel wire combined
 with a turnbuckle and spring coil. Remove shooting wires after completion of shotcreting and
 screeding operations.
 Do not let guide strips and forms impede the ability of the nozzle operator to produce
 uniform, dense, properly consolidated shotcrete. Do not use alignment control material that
 causes the formation of sand-pockets and voids.
 If using depth gauges for alignment control, space no greater than four (4) ft in a grid
 pattern. Cut back metal depth gauges to 1/4 inch below the finished surface.
 Cover reinforcing steel in accordance with Section 540, “Steel Reinforcement.”

 519.3.4
 
 Shotcrete Application and Finishing
 
 519.3.4.1
 
 Shotcrete Application
 
 The Project Manager will review and approve areas prepared for shotcrete application
 before application of shotcrete.
 Flush surfaces with water at least one (1) hour before application of shotcrete. Allow
 flushed surfaces to dry back to saturated surface-dry condition before application of shotcrete.
 If necessary, use a blowpipe with oil-free compressed air to facilitate removal of surface water.
 For very porous and dry substrates, saturate the substrate the Day before shotcreting and
 then re-wet before shooting as described above.
 The Contractor shall apply shotcrete in accordance with ACI 506R, except that if using
 silica-fume modified shotcrete; the Contractor may apply the full thickness of shotcrete in a
 single layer. Use the minimum number of layers required to build up the full thickness of
 shotcrete without sagging, separation, or sloughing. Wherever possible, apply shotcrete to the
 full thickness in a single layer.
 If using multiple-layer shotcrete construction, prepare the first layer with one (1) of the
 following methods before applying a subsequent layer:
 1.
 
 Broom the stiffening layer with a stiff bristle broom to remove loose material,
 rebound, over-spray, or glaze, before the shotcrete attains initial set.
 
 2.
 
 If the shotcrete has set, Delay surface preparation at least 24 h, then prepare the
 surface by sandblasting or high-pressure water blasting to remove loose material,
 rebound, hardened over-spray, glaze, or other material detrimental to good bond.
 
 When successive layers of shotcrete are necessary to build up full shotcrete thickness,
 prevent the first layer from drying out with fogging or wetting. Only use curing compound with
 the approval of the Project Manager. If using a curing compound, remove it by abrasive blast
 cleaning or high-pressure water blasting, before application of the next layer of shotcrete.
 Clean the first layer of shotcrete of surface water and ensure it is in a saturated surface-dry
 condition when applying the next shotcrete layer.
 Exercise care to protect adjacent surfaces from buildup of rebound and over-spray. The
 Department will not allow rebound and over-spray on the completed Work. Remove rebound
 and over-spray from surfaces to receive shotcrete while the Material is still plastic, using
 blowpipes, scrapers, wire brushes, or other suitable tools. Remove hardened rebound and
 overspray with abrasive blast cleaning, chipping hammers, high-pressure water blasting or
 other suitable techniques before applying additional shotcrete.
 Provide scaffolding or other devices so the nozzle operator and helpers have free,
 unhindered access to the Work area.
 Apply shotcrete from the nozzle in accordance with ACI 506R.
 Do not apply shotcrete during periods of rain or high wind, unless suitable protection is
 provided.
 Section 519:
 
 Shotcrete

 Apply shotcrete in accordance with the Contract using shooting wires, depth gauges,
 guide strips, forms, or other suitable devices. Apply the minimum cover of shotcrete to
 reinforcing steel in accordance with the Plans. Cut back metal depth gauges to within 1/4 inch
 of the shotcrete surface, to prevent corrosion staining of the surface.
 When applying a 3/8 inch maximum aggregate size shotcrete, the Department will allow a
 final flash coat layer (¼ inch to ¾ inch thick) using ¼ inch aggregate shotcrete.
 519.3.4.2
 
 Shotcrete Finishing
 
 Leave shotcrete in the natural gun finish unless otherwise specified in the Contract.
 If the Contract requires finishing, cut back shotcrete to line and grade using cutting rods,
 screeds, or other suitable devices. Allow shotcrete to stiffen sufficiently before cutting and
 trimming, to prevent the formation of tears, cracks, and delaminations. Remove shooting
 wires on completion of cutting and trimming.
 Apply one (1) or more of the following finishes if required:
 1.
 
 Wood float finish, either as a preliminary finish for other surface treatments, or as a
 granular texture finish;
 
 2.
 
 Rubber float finish, applied to either a flash coat or wood float finish, to produce a
 finer textured granular finish;
 
 3.
 
 Brush finish, a fine hairbrush float finish that leaves a finely textured, sandy finish;
 
 4.
 
 Steel trowel finish that leaves a dense, smooth hard finish.
 
 Trim back shotcrete and over-spray from adjacent non-prepared concrete surfaces.
 Provide the edges of shotcrete repairs with a minimum square saw-cut edge 3/4 inch deep;
 finish shotcrete up to this edge. Do not featheredge shotcrete (including flash coats).
 519.3.4.3
 
 Curing and Protection
 
 On completion of finishing, immediately prevent shotcrete from drying out by fogging or
 wetting.
 If the Contract requires leaving shotcrete with a natural gun finish, apply curing
 compounds at twice the application rate normally specified for smooth concrete finishes.
 Completely remove curing compounds by abrasive blasting or water blasting (with a pressure
 of 3,000 psi) before application of subsequent sealers.
 Once the shotcrete achieves its final set, keep it continuously moist for at least seven
 (7) Days. Perform moist curing using one (1) or both of the following procedures:
 1.
 
 Wrap the elements in wet burlap presoaked in water for 24 h before installation;
 wrap the wet burlap in plastic sheet to slow the drying rate of the burlap;
 
 2.
 
 Install sprinklers, soaker hoses, or other devices that keep the shotcrete
 continuously wet. Do not use intermittent wetting procedures that allow the
 shotcrete to undergo cycles of wetting and drying during the curing period.
 
 519.3.4.4
 
 Hot and Cold Weather Protection
 
 Apply shotcrete during periods of hot and cold weather in accordance with ACI 305R and
 ACI 306R.
 If it is anticipated that shotcrete will be placed when the ambient temperature will fall
 below 35 oF, a Cold-Weather Shotcrete Plan must be prepared and submitted to the Project
 Manager at least 30 Days before the intended application. The Cold Weather Shotcreting
 Plan must be reviewed and approved by the State Concrete Engineer before shotcrete is
 o
 permitted to be placed at temperatures below 35 F.
 Monitor the Surface Evaporation of the Shotcrete in accordance with Section 512. Do not
 Section 519:
 
 Shotcrete
 
 Page 384
 
 proceed with shotcrete application if the average rate of surface evaporation of the shotcrete
 over any 10 minute period exceeds 0.2 lb per square foot per hour, in accordance with
 Section 512, “Superstructure Concrete.” Do not allow the prevailing ambient conditions
 (relative humidity, wind speed, air temperature, and direct exposure to sunlight) to cause
 either plastic shrinkage or early drying shrinkage cracking.
 All cracked Structural shotcrete, regardless of the cause, shall be removed and replaced
 at no cost to the Department.
 Subsequent efforts to prevent further cracking problems shall include, but not be limited
 to:
 1.
 
 Rescheduling of the Work to a time when more favorable ambient conditions prevail;
 
 2.
 
 Adopt corrective measures, such as installation of sunscreens, windbreaks, or
 fogging devices to protect the Work; or
 
 During periods of cold weather, shotcreting may only proceed if the substrate to which
 the shotcrete is applied and the air temperature in contact with the shotcrete surfaces are both
 above 50 °F.
 Maintain the air temperature in contact with the shotcrete surfaces at 60 °F or greater for
 at least 4 Days after application of shotcrete. Submit the means of maintaining the air
 temperature to the Project Manager for approval. Do not use unvented heaters.
 Apply shotcrete at a temperature of between 50 °F and 90 °F. Use cooler mix
 temperatures during hot-weather shotcrete operations and warmer mix temperatures during
 cold-weather shotcrete operations.
 519.3.4.5
 
 Inspection and Remedial Work
 
 Sound the surface of the cured shotcrete with a hammer to locate unsound areas.
 Provide Equipment, hardware, and means necessary to perform the inspection
 operations. The inspection accommodations are subject to the approval of the Project
 Manager.
 Cut out and replace sags or other defects with another layer. If welded wire mesh
 reinforcement is damaged or destroyed by such repairs, repair the damaged area by
 overlapping and tying additional wire mesh in accordance with Section 519.3.2.4.3, “Steel

 provisions for preventing grout leakage.
 520.3.1.3
 
 Duct Size
 
 Section 520:
 
 Non-Shrink Grout for Post-Tensioned Bridge Members
 
 Page 386
 
 For tendons consisting of multiple wires, bars, or strands, use duct with a cross-sectional
 area at least twice that of the stressing steel. For tendons consisting of a single wire, bar, or
 strand, use ducts with a diameter at least 1/4 inch larger than the nominal diameter of the wire,
 bar, or strand.
 520.3.1.4
 
 Placement of Ducts
 
 After placing the ducts and completing reinforcement and forming, inspect the Work for
 possible duct damage. Securely fasten ducts at close intervals to avoid displacement during
 concrete placement. Repair unintentional holes or openings in the duct before concrete
 placement.
 Securely anchor grout openings and vents to the duct and to the forms or reinforcing
 steel to prevent displacement during concrete placement.
 520.3.2
 
 Personnel Certification
 
 Grout tendon ducts under the direction of a person who has verifiable documentation of
 experience in performing grouting of post-tension operations. The person shall be certified by
 the American Segmental Bridge Institute’s Grouting Certification Program or equivalent as
 approved by the State Bridge Engineer.
 520.3.3
 
 Grouting Equipment
 
 Use grouting Equipment that includes a mixer capable of continuous mechanical mixing
 that produces grout free of lumps or undispersed cement. Use Equipment that pumps the
 mixed grout in a manner that complies with provisions of this specification. Do not use
 commercially available plaster and concrete mixers for mixing grout.
 Use accessory Equipment that provides accurate solid and liquid measures to batch
 Materials.
 Use a positive displacement type pump that provides an outlet pressure of at least
 150 psi. Use a pump with seals adequate to prevent the introduction of oil, air, or other foreign
 substance into the grout, and to prevent the loss of grout or water.
 Place a pressure gauge that has a full-scale reading of 300 psi or less in the grout line
 between the pump outlet and the duct inlet.
 Make standby water flushing Equipment available where difficult grouting conditions
 exist. Use this Equipment in addition to the grouting Equipment. Provide the standby water
 flushing Equipment with a different power source than the grouting Equipment. Use standby
 water flushing Equipment that has sufficient capacity to flush out any partially grouted
 enclosures, and is capable of developing a pressure of at least 300 psi.
 Use grouting Equipment that contains a screen with maximum clear openings of 1/8 inch
 to filter the grout before its introduction into the grout pump. If using a grout with a thixotropic
 additive, a screen opening of 3/16 inch is satisfactory. Make this screen easily accessible for
 inspection and cleaning.
 Use grouting Equipment that uses gravity feed to the pump inlet from a hopper attached
 to and directly above it. Keep enough Material in the hopper during the pumping operation to
 prevent air from being drawn into the post-tensioning duct.
 Under normal conditions, use grouting Equipment capable of continuously grouting the
 largest tendon on the Project in 20 minutes or less.
 520.3.4 Mixing of Grout
 Prepare the grout in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. The Project
 Section 520:
 
 Non-Shrink Grout for Post-Tensioned Bridge Members
 
 Page 387
 
 Manager will determine the pumpability of the grout in accordance with ASTM C 939. Ensure
 the outflow time of grout samples, immediately after mixing, reaches or exceeds 11 seconds.
 520.3.5
 
 Duct Preparation
 
 Conduct a pre-grouting air pressure test of ducts and take measures to eliminate or
 reduce the consequences of identified leakage. Clean ducts of water and Deleterious
 Materials that would impair bonding of the grout or interfere with grouting procedures. Use oilfree compressed air to blow out ducts.
 The Contractor may use water to flush metal ducts.
 Flush ducts with concrete walls (cored ducts) with water to ensure that the concrete is
 thoroughly wetted. Water for flushing ducts may contain slack lime (calcium hydroxide) or
 quicklime (calcium oxide) in the amount of 0.1 lb per gallon.
 520.3.6
 
 Grout Injection Requirements
 
 Bond post-tensioned steel to the concrete by filling the entire void space between the
 duct and the prestressing reinforcement with non-shrink grout in accordance with Section 518,
 “Pre-Stressed Concrete Members.” Fit grout injection pipes with positive mechanical shutoff
 valves. Fit vents and ejection pipes with valves capable of withstanding the pumping
 pressures. Do not remove or open valves until the grout has set. Prevent leakage of grout
 through the anchorage assembly by positive mechanical means. Pump grout from the low
 point of the duct through the duct with vents provided at the high point of the duct when
 possible. Continuously waste grout at the outlet until no visible slugs, water, or air are ejected
 and until the efflux time of ejected grout is at least 11 seconds. Allow grout to flow from the
 first vent after the inlet pipe until residual flushing water or entrapped air disappears, then cap
 or otherwise close the vent. Close the remaining vents in sequence in the same manner.
 Then close the outlet valve and hold the pumping pressure momentarily. While maintaining
 this pressure, close the inlet valve.
 Do not allow the pumping pressure at the tendon inlet to exceed 250 psi.
 If the actual grouting pressure exceeds 250 psi, the Contractor may inject grout at any
 capped vent, as long as the Contractor maintains a one-way flow of grout. If the Contractor
 uses this procedure, the Contractor shall fit the vent, at which it plans to inject, with a positive
 shutoff.
 520.3.7
 
 Temperature Considerations
 
 Do not allow the temperature of the grout to exceed 90 °F or fall below 45 °F during
 mixing and pumping. If necessary, cool or heat the mixing water. Maintain the concrete at a
 temperature of 35 °F or higher until site-cured mortar cubes reach a compressive strength of
 800 psi.
 520.3.8
 
 Grouting Inspection
 
 Physically probe or visually inspect anchorages 48 hours after grouting until the Project
 Manager is assured that there is no bleed water or subsidence voids. The Project Manager
 may require subsequent spot inspections of one (1) or more selected anchorages per span to
 verify the absence of voids. Immediately fill discovered voids with grout.
 520.3.9
 
 Finishing of Anchorage Zones
 
 The Contractor shall thoroughly blast clean (with abrasives) the surfaces of concrete
 against which the Contractor shall place concrete encasement over anchorage assemblies
 after completing grouting of the ducts.

 Strengthen corroded or damaged existing bars by splicing an equal sized bar at least two
 (2) ft longer than the corroded or damaged length. The minimum splice length shall be one
 (1) ft on each end.
 533.3.1.4
 
 Application of Bonding Agents
 
 Use diluted bonding admixture or other manufacturer-recommended priming systems as
 bonding agents. Apply the bonding agents to the contact surfaces of the repair areas
 immediately before concrete or mortar placement.
 533.3.2 Depth of Repair
 Use enriched mortar where the repair depth is less than one (1) inch, and use enriched
 concrete where the repair depth is one (1) inch or greater. If the repair depth is four (4) inches
 or greater, use the appropriate class concrete or enriched concrete.
 533.3.3
 
 Forms for Full Depth Repair
 
 Provide forms to support concrete placed in the full depth repair areas. The Contractor
 may use wires from the reinforcing steel to suspend forms for areas up to five (5) ft2. For
 larger areas, the Contractor may use the primary members of the Superstructure to support
 the forms or shore them from below. Clean the concrete faces and reinforcing steel in areas
 of full depth repair as described previously.
 533.3.4
 
 Placing, Finishing, and Curing
 
 Do not mix mortar and concrete in repair areas. Use forms if necessary.
 533.3.4.1
 
 Temperature and Weather Limitations
 
 Make repairs when the air temperature is between 50 °F and 95 °F. Maintain the
 temperature of the mortar and concrete at or above 50 °F during the curing period. Use a set
 retardant if recommended by the manufacturer.
 533.3.4.2
 
 Placement
 
 Place mortar or concrete in a continuous operation for each repair area. For vertical
 surfaces, start the Work at the bottom of the patch and continue upwards, and from one edge
 to the other to prevent the entrapment of air pockets.
 If the repair area abuts or crosses a working joint, place a temporary strip of waxed wood
 or pre-molded filler in the joint before placing repair Material. Remove the strips before the
 concrete sets.
 The Contractor may also repair areas that occur on both sides of a joint by patching the
 entire cavity and restoring the joint by saw cutting immediately after the repair Material has
 set, instead of using a temporary vertical insert strip.
 533.3.4.3
 
 Curing
 
 Cure in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. If the manufacturer does
 not specify a cure method, use Method 2 or Method 4 in accordance with Section 511.3.9,
 “Curing.”
 533.3.5
 
 Inspection
 
 The Project Manager will examine repaired areas after the curing period is completed to
 ensure soundness of the repairs and complete bonding with the existing members. Remove
 and replace unacceptable areas at no additional cost to the Department.

 The Department will mark cracks and delaminated areas for injection.
 Inject epoxy when concrete temperature is between 50 °F and 80 °F. Inject epoxy
 continuously over the entire crack or area of delamination. Maintain low pumping pressures to
 prevent lifting the delamination.
 534.3.1.1 Epoxy Sampling During Operations
 Before starting injection Work, at hourly intervals during continuous injection Work, and
 when requested by the Project Manager, take a 3-fluid-ounce sample of mixed epoxy from the
 injection device. If the sample indicates improper proportioning or mixing of the epoxy, the
 Project Manager will suspend injection Work until the Contractor corrects the problem.
 534.3.1.2
 
 Core Sampling
 
 Take core samples from injected cracks and delaminated areas and submit them to the
 Project Manager to verify penetration and bonding adequacy. Cut cores with a diameter of
 1 1/2 inch and to the full crack depth or six (6) inches, whichever is smaller.
 The Project Manager will specify core sample locations. Submit at least one (1) core
 sample for every 50 ft of injected crack or every 50 ft2 of injected delamination. Fill core holes
 with a Department-approved epoxy mortar.
 534.3.2
 
 Equipment
 
 Use positive displacing dispensing Equipment that is capable of injecting epoxy at set
 pressures without pressure build-up.
 Where the Contractor uses pressure plates to seal cracks, the Contractor shall use a
 special pressure fitting on the injection device to prevent leakage.
 If the Contractor drills out injection ports, the Contractor shall use drilling Equipment with
 a vacuum system to remove and not compact drilling dust into cracks or delaminations.
 534.3.3
 
 Crack Injection
 
 534.3.3.1
 
 Crack Preparation
 
 Clean surface openings and crack interiors with oil-free compressed air to remove dirt,
 dust, silt, and other Materials. If the Department determines the result is inadequate, use
 another cleaning method such as vacuuming, pressure flushing, routing, or sawing. If using
 Section 534:
 
 Epoxy Injection
 
 Page 412
 
 pressure flushing, blow water out with oil-free compressed air.
 534.3.3.2
 
 Injection Ports
 
 Unless the Project Manager approves other methods, drill holes along the crack to insert
 the injection ports.
 534.3.3.3
 
 Temporary Crack Sealing
 
 Temporarily seal surface openings of cracks between injection ports with material that
 can retain the epoxy adhesive during pressure injection and until the epoxy hardens.
 534.3.3.4
 
 Crack Injection Process
 
 When Material travel is indicated, the nozzle shall be moved to the port that shows
 epoxy, and the pumped port sealed and this method continued until the crack is completely
 filled. Where vertical and horizontal cracks intersect, inject the vertical crack below the
 intersection first. On wide cracks, where epoxy movement between ports will be rapid, the
 Contractor may pump two (2) or more ports simultaneously.
 534.3.4 Re-bonding Delaminated Areas by Epoxy Injection
 534.3.4.1
 
 Injection Ports
 
 Use at least one (1) port for every square yard of delaminated areas.
 534.3.4.2
 
 Temporary Sealing of Delaminated Openings
 
 Temporarily seal the surface openings of cracks in the delaminated areas to prevent
 leakage of epoxy Material.
 534.3.4.3
 
 Delamination Injection Process
 
 Begin injection at one port near the perimeter of the delaminated area and continue until
 there is epoxy at an adjacent port. Then plug the port being pumped and continue the
 injection at the adjacent port showing epoxy. Continue this process until the entire
 delaminated area has been injected. The Contractor may pump two (2) or more ports
 simultaneously.
 534.3.5
 
 Finishing Operations
 
 After curing is complete, remove excess sealing material from the concrete surface
 without altering the concrete surface color or texture.
 534.3.6

 recommendations concerning moisture content.
 Submit proposed locations of the longitudinal and transverse joints for approval. Do not
 locate the longitudinal joints in wheel lines.
 537.3.6
 
 Application
 
 Before applying the prime coat, the concrete area to receive the prime coat shall be dry
 when tested according to ASTM D 4263. The concrete surface temperature shall be between
 50 degrees F and 100 degrees F during application of the prime coat. Follow the
 manufacturer’s deck temperature recommendations. Do not use artificial methods to raise the
 deck temperature.
 Follow the manufacturer’s temperature requirements for polyester resin and aggregate
 components. The Contractor shall not apply polyester resin if either of the following
 conditions exists:
 1.
 
 The air temperature is expected to drop below the manufacturer-required
 temperature within 8 h after application; or
 
 2.
 
 The polyester resin gel time is less than ten (10) min.
 
 The prime coat shall be uniformly applied to completely cover the surface to receive the
 polyester concrete. Apply the prime coat at an approximate rate of 0.09 to 0.11 gal/yd2 prior to
 placement of polymer concrete. Flood concrete surfaces with the prime coat, allowing
 penetration into the concrete and filling of all cracks. Redistribute the applied prime coat in
 cracks by squeegees or brooms. The quantity of initiated, promoted resin shall be no more
 than what is needed to apply a prime coat. A noticeable increase in viscosity prior to
 placement will be cause for rejection. If the primed surface becomes contaminated, or if there
 is a failure of the material, clean the contaminated or failed area by abrasive blasting and reprime.
 Immediately after the prime coat has been applied, the polyester concrete overlay shall
 be placed, in accordance with manufacturer’s guidelines.
 Mix polyester concrete in mechanically operated mixers. Use a sufficient amount of
 initiator in the polyester concrete to produce set times between 30 and 120 minutes after
 placement. Accelerators or inhibitors may be required to achieve proper set times and shall
 be used as recommended by the resin Supplier.
 Place and finish polyester concrete before gelling or within 15 minutes following addition
 of the initiator, whichever occurs first. Discard polyester concrete not placed within this time.
 Use finishing Equipment that strikes off the polyester concrete to the established grade,
 cross section, and nominal depth. Fit finishing Equipment with vibrators or other means of
 consolidating the overlay material. Construct longitudinal joints parallel to the Roadway
 alignment at the approved locations. Construct vertical joints perpendicular to the deck
 surface.
 
 Section 537:
 
 Polyester Concrete Bridge Deck Overlay
 
 Page 428
 
 The smoothness of the polyester concrete surface will be tested with a straightedge. The
 surface shall not vary by more than 0.02 feet from the lower edge of a 12 foot +/- 0.2 feet long
 straightedge placed in any direction. Any surface that fails to conform to the above tolerance
 shall be ground to meet this requirement.
 Apply abrasive sand finish to polyester concrete surfaces. The sand shall be commercial
 quality blast sand, conforming to the absorption capacity and moisture content requirements of
 polymer concrete aggregate of this Specification. Provide sand such that 95% shall pass the
 No. 8 sieve and 95% shall be retained on the No. 20 sieve. Apply the sand finish by
 mechanical means immediately after overlay strike-off. Broadcast sand uniformly onto the
 2
 surface before gelling occurs at a minimum rate of 1.5 lb/yd .
 After application of the sand finish and before gelling occurs, texture the overlay by
 grooving with a steel-tined rake with tines 1/8 inch wide and spaced from ¾ inch to 1½ inch
 apart. Groove to a depth of 1/8 to 3/16 inch.
 The surface texture of the overlay shall be uniform and shall have a coefficient of friction
 of not less than 0.35. If the coefficient of friction is less than 0.35, grind or groove, parallel to
 the centerline, those portions of surfaces until the coefficient of friction requirement is met.
 537.3.7
 
 Curing
 
 Protect the finished overlay from moisture, Equipment, and public traffic until the overlay
 achieves an average Schmidt hammer reading of 24. The Schmidt hammer test shall consist
 of the average of ten (10) readings (strikes), all taken in an area approximately 18 inches in
 diameter. Perform one (1) such test per 500 sq ft of overlay. Traffic may be allowed on the
 overlay when the reading of 24 is achieved.
 Do not contaminate concrete surfaces during clean-up of tools and Equipment. Do not
 dump or spill polyester concrete Materials or cleaning solvents in areas that will cause
 environmental or fire hazards.
 537.3.9
 
 Testing
 
 Provide the necessary Equipment and supplies for conducting adhesion tests on the
 completed overlay. Perform adhesion tests according to ACI 503R - Appendix A of the ACI
 Manual of Concrete Practice. Adhesion tests shall obtain a 250 psi minimum pulloff or
 cohesive failure within existing concrete. Perform tests at a frequency of one (1) test per every
 1600 sq ft of deck surface in a random location. Prime and patch test holes with polyester
 concrete immediately after testing.
 537.3.10
 
 Corrective Work
 
 Correct surface variations that exceed ± 0.02 ft per 12 ft, unless otherwise directed by the
 Project Manager.
 Repair damaged overlay areas by saw cutting in rectangular sections to the top of the
 concrete surface and replacing the material at no additional cost to the Department.
 In the event that the testing performed under 537.3.9 does not meet minimum pulloff, the
 material shall be removed and replaced in the areas in which low adhesion is determined from
 additional testing. Any additional testing required shall be Incidental to the Work.
 537.3.11
 
 Warranty
 
 In addition to the requirements of Section 106.10, "Guarantees and Warranties," provide
 a five (5)-year warranty for the overlay material and installation.

 direction. Tie alternate intersections where bar spacing is less than one (1) ft in either
 direction.
 Use metal spacers, chairs, hangers, and other approved devices to hold the reinforcing
 bars in position.
 When using concrete blocks to support the bottom mat of reinforcement in slabs that are
 cast on ground, use dense, rectangular concrete blocks that:
 Section 540:
 
 Steel Reinforcement
 
 Page 434
 
 1.
 
 Have compressive strength and density equal to or greater than the concrete to be
 placed;
 
 2.
 
 Occupy a small area; and
 
 3.
 
 Contain embedded, plastic or epoxy-coated, tie wires for attachment of
 reinforcement.
 
 Do not use wooden spacers or supports.
 Tie reinforcing bar mats in Bridge deck and concrete box Culvert slabs to beams and
 forms to prevent upward movement during concrete placement. Ensure that the space
 between ties does not exceed ten (10) ft.
 540.3.1.5.2
 
 Reinforcing Bar Placement Tolerances
 
 Ensure that the space between adjacent bars does not vary more than the greater of ½
 inch or 1 /24 of the spacing dimension shown on the Plans.
 Except for slabs cast on the ground, ensure that the clear cover of reinforcement shall not
 vary more than the greater of either 1/4 inch or 1/8 of the dimension shown on the Plans.
 Ensure that the reinforcement clear cover in slabs cast on the ground does not vary more
 than minus 1/2 inch from the position shown on the Plans.
 540.3.1.6
 
 Cleaning Reinforcing Bars
 
 Before placing concrete, clean the reinforcing bars of Materials that would reduce or
 destroy the bond.
 540.3.1.7
 
 Welding of Reinforcing Steel
 
 Weld reinforcing steel only if the Contract requires it or if the State Bridge Engineer
 authorizes it in writing. Weld in accordance with AWS Specification D1.4, Reinforcing Steel
 Welding Code. Welding of bars other than ASTM A706 is allowed only upon approval of
 qualified welding procedures for those bars that comply with AWS D1.4. Submit a Welding
 Procedure Specification, stamped by an AWS certified welding Inspector for each procedure.
 Welding to other added Contractor steel for stiffening, cage alignment, lifting, handling
 and other Contractor needs shall not be welded to reinforcing steel called for in the Plans.
 540.3.1.8
 
 Concrete Cover Requirements

 Final Inspection
 
 Do not place concrete until the Department inspects the reinforcing steel in place.
 Acceptance of the reinforcing steel does not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for the
 cover and position control of the steel.
 540.3.2
 
 Requirements for Epoxy-Coated Reinforcing Bars
 
 540.3.2.1
 
 Storage and Handling of Epoxy- Coated Reinforcing Bars
 
 Transport and store epoxy-coated reinforcing steel on wooden or padded supports. Use
 devices with padded contact areas to handle epoxy-coated reinforcement bars and prevent
 bar-to-bar abrasion. Do not drop or drag bars or bundles. Use spreader beams and multiple
 pick points when hoisting bar bundles to prevent sagging. Do not store epoxy-coated
 reinforcing bars in sunlight for more than 30 Days. Use only non-metallic sleeved heads with
 immersion-type vibrators when placing concrete around epoxy-coated reinforcing.
 540.3.2.2
 
 Repair of Damaged Epoxy-Coating
 
 Repair visible damage before shipping. Ensure the total surface area of patched coating
 Material is not more than one percent (1%) of the total coated area in any one (1) foot section.
 The Department will reject bars shipped to the Project that show more than one percent (1%)
 patched coating Material.
 Patch sheared ends, cuts and exposed areas promptly before detrimental oxidation
 occurs. Keep exposed areas free of contaminants before patching.
 Patch coating damage before placing concrete. Ensure that the total patched surface
 area does not exceed two percent (2%) of the coated area in any one (1) foot section. The
 Department will reject any installed bars with more than two percent (2%) patching.
 Apply the patching material in strict compliance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
 Allow adequate time for the patch to cure before placing concrete over the bars.
 540.3.3
 
 Requirements for Galvanized Reinforcing Bars
 
 540.3.3.1
 
 Galvanizing Bent Bars
 
 Where galvanized bars are detailed to be bent or have other types of cold-forming, the
 bars must be bent before galvanizing.
 540.3.3.2
 
 Surface Preparations
 
 Prepare bar surfaces by removing dirt and grease with a hot alkaline solution. Use a
 diluted solution of sulfuric acid to pickle. Use a solution of zinc ammonium chloride to flux.
 Ensure that the resulting surface condition is about equal to SSPC-SP 10 as described by the
 SSPC.
 540.3.3.3
 
 Thickness of Galvanizing
 
 Ensure that the galvanizing after drying with air, steam or wiping is from three (3) mils to
 3.9 mils thick. Determine the thickness with a magnetic thickness gage.
 Section 540:
 
 Steel Reinforcement
 
 Page 436
 
 540.3.3.4
 
 Chromating
 
 Treat the galvanized coating with chromate. This prevents a reaction between the bars
 and fresh Portland cement paste. The Department will allow proprietary chromating treatment
 solutions of equivalent strength instead of the generic chemical treatment in accordance with
 ASTM A 767, Section 5.3. Quenching of bent bars or bars to be bent is not allowed. Such
 bars must be chromated at ambient temperature.
 540.3.3.5
 
 Finish and Adherence of Coating
 
 Ensure that the zinc coating is free of bare spots, blisters, flux spots or inclusions, dross,
 and acid or black spots. The Department will reject bars that stick together after galvanizing.
 A matte gray finish appearance is not, by itself, a cause for rejection.
 Ensure that the coating cannot be removed through normal handling.
 540.3.3.6
 
 Installation of Galvanized Reinforcing Bars
 
 Transport and store galvanized bars in a manner to prevent damage to the galvanized
 coating. All systems for handling galvanized coated bars shall have padded contact areas. All
 bundles of bars shall be lifted using spreader beams and multiple pick points or a platform
 Bridge to prevent bar-to-bar abrasion from sagging in the bar bundle. The bars and bundles
 shall not be dropped or dragged on the ground, platforms or other bars.
 Galvanized reinforcing bars shall not be tied with black steel or left in contact with black
 steel. Galvanized reinforcing bars shall be left in contact only with galvanized, plastic-coated,
 or epoxy-coated surfaces.
 540.3.3.7
 
 Repair of Damaged Galvanizing
 
 Patch sheared ends, cuts and exposed areas using a zinc-rich paint. Prepare the surface
 to be patched so that it is clean, dry and free of oil, grease and corrosion products. Blast-clean
 the surface to near-white metal, in accordance with SSPC-SP10. Spray or brush-apply the
 paint containing the zinc dust as recommended by the manufacturer in one (1) application of
 as many passes as required to achieve a dry film thickness of four (4) mils as determined
 using a magnetic or electromagnetic gage.
 540.3.4
 
 Repair of Stainless Steel Clad Deformed Steel Bars
 
 The stainless steel clad deformed steel bars shall be shop bent as shown on the Contract
 documents. All ends of the bars where mild steel core is exposed shall be capped by one (1)
 of the following methods:
 1. Heat shrink cap applied in accordance with the cap manufacturer’s instructions.
 2. Neoprene cap adhered with silicone or epoxy sealant.
 3. Stainless steel cap epoxied in place.
 4. Stainless steel seal weld.
 No field cutting or bending of stainless steel clad deformed steel bars will be allowed.
 540.4
 
 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 
 The Department will measure reinforcing bar weight in accordance with Table 540.2.1:1
 “Nominal Dimensions of Reinforcement,” whether it is black steel, epoxy-coated, galvanized,
 stainless steel, stainless steel clad, or low-carbon, chrome steel. The computed weights of
 reinforcing bars will be based on the nominal weights of the bars before application of the
 epoxy-coating, or galvanizing of the bars. When splice overlaps are unscheduled or are made
 for the convenience of the Contractor, and are approved by the State Bridge Engineer at
 locations not shown in the Contract, the extra steel required for splice overlaps will not be
 included in computing the weight of the bars for payment.

 541.3.6.1
 
 Attachment and Fit of Gussets and Stiffeners
 
 Where welding of gusset plates, stiffeners or other secondary attachments to main
 structural members would otherwise result in intersections of welds, clip back the corners of
 the attachments 1 1/4 inch minimum from the corner in each direction to avoid such
 intersections.
 Terminate welds attaching secondary components to main members 1/4 inch short of the
 end of the attachments.
 If the Plans require bearing stiffeners “finished to bear,” mill or grind the ends and obtain
 an even bearing against the flange the stiffeners will bear on.
 If the Plans require “tight fit” stiffeners, fit the stiffeners tight against the flange to exclude
 water after being coated.
 541.3.6.2
 
 Straightening of Flanges
 
 At pier bearings, abutment bearings and splices, straighten girder or beam flanges
 perpendicular to the webs. At bearings, straighten flanges before fitting stiffeners. At splices,
 straighten flanges before coating and shipment. Do not cold bend.
 541.3.6.3
 541.3.6.3.1
 
 Bearing Plates, Pins, and Rollers
 Sole, Masonry, and Shoe Plates
 
 Flatten the top and bottom surfaces of sole masonry and shoe plates to within
 ± 1/32 inch.

 Procedure for Rotational Capacity Test for Short Bolts
 
 Test bolts that are too short for a tension calibrator in accordance with these procedures:
 Equipment requirements:
 1.
 
 A calibrated torque wrench and a spud wrench;
 
 2.
 
 Spacers with a hole size no larger than 1/16 inch greater than the tested bolt;
 
 3.
 
 A steel section with a normal size hole to install bolt. Any available splice hole with
 plate thicknesses that will provide the number of threads under the nut required in
 Step 3.1 of the following procedures is acceptable.
 
 The procedure is as follows:
 3.1 Mark the steel section with lines at vertical and at 1/3 (120°) and 2/3 (240°) of a
 turn, clockwise from vertical;
 3.2 Put the nut on the bolt. Measure the bolt length and the distance from the end
 of the threaded shank to the underside of the bolt head when there are three
 (3) to five (5) full threads of the bolt between the bearing face of the nut and the
 bolt head.
 3.3. Put the bolt in the hole and install the required number of shim plates to
 produce the thread stick-out measured in Step 3.1. Always install one (1)
 washer under the nut.
 3.4. Snug using a hand wrench. Do not exceed 20% of the torque determined in
 Step 3.6 of this procedure.
 Section 542:
 
 High-Strength Bolts

 Sampling and Testing by the Department
 
 Before installation, the Project Manager will select two (2) bolt, nut and hardened washer
 assemblies from each rotational capacity lot and at least three (3) direct-tension indicators with
 accompanying bolts, nuts and hardened washers, for each diameter and grade of fastener for
 testing by the State Materials Bureau.
 542.2.5.7
 
 Shipping
 
 Ship bolts, nuts, and washers from each rotational capacity lot in the same container. If
 there is only one (1) production lot number for each size of nut, washer, and direct tension
 indicator, the Contractor may ship the nuts, washers, and direct tension indicators in separate
 containers.
 Permanently mark each container with the rotational capacity lot number.
 542.3
 
 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 
 The Contractor shall fabricate Materials it shall connect with high-strength bolts in
 accordance with Section 541, “Steel Structures.”
 Blast clean steel faying surfaces in accordance with SSPC-SP 10.
 Ensure that the bolted part surfaces adjacent to the bolt head and nut are parallel within
 the 3 degrees for parallel surface rolled steel members. Use beveled washers on surfaces
 with more than a 1:20 slope for proper seating. Use bolted parts that fit solidly together when
 assembled. Do not use gaskets or other flexible material.
 Erect joints and splices with cylindrical erection pins and bolts in accordance with
 Section 541, “Steel Structures.” Use high-strength bolts instead of erection bolts if necessary.
 These can be left in place, provided they are not loosened and retightened.
 542.3.1 Installation of Bolts
 Ensure that bolt, nut, and washer combinations are from the same rotational capacity lot.
 Section 542:
 
 High-Strength Bolts
 
 Page 455
 
 542.3.2
 
 Lubrication
 
 Ensure that black bolts are oily to the touch when delivered and installed.
 Clean and relubricate weathered or rusted bolts and nuts before installation. Retest
 recleaned or relubricated bolt, nut, and washer assemblies.
 Before installing galvanized nuts, inspect the nuts to ensure the threads are properly
 lubricated. If lubricant is not visible or if tensioning indicates that thread friction is too high,
 apply an approved lubricant to the remaining threads before installation.
 542.3.3
 
 Method of Installation
 
 Install bolts in accordance with Figure 542.3.3:1, “Installation Details.” In general, use
 Method I. Use Method 2 and Method 3, as approved by the Department, where bolt entry,
 wrench clearances, or inspection procedures make Method I impossible.
 Prevent the stationary element from turning.
 For oversized or slotted holes, place additional hardened washers between the bolted
 Material and the fastener.
 Wherever practical, place the nut where it is not visible from the Traveled Way. When
 one end of a bolted assembly is embedded in concrete, place the assembly so the nut end is
 in the concrete.
 When tightening connections involving several bolts, draw together plies of the steel by
 snugging the bolts before starting the tightening operations. On connections involving a large
 number of bolts or thick Materials, tighten the bolts to the point where the direct-tension
 indicators are partially compressed. In some cases, proper tensioning of the bolts may require
 more than a single cycle of systematic partial tightening before final tightening to deform the
 direct-tension indicators to the specified gap.
 Ensure that the final gap between the bolt head and the direct-tension indicator is
 less than or equal to 0.015 in for Method I and less than or equal to 0.005 in for Method 2 or
 Method 3.

 544.3.4.5
 
 Primer Application
 
 Do not apply primers over blasted steel that has begun to rust or bloom. Apply primer in
 a smooth, wet, continuous film.
 Adjust the spray Equipment to apply an even wet coat with minimal overspray. Hold the
 spray gun at right angles to the surface, making even, parallel passes with about a 50%
 overlap. Apply the primer in two (2) or more wet coats avoiding heavy coats.
 Remove dry overspray with light sanding. Pre-spray edges, welds, bends, and other
 areas that will likely fail to meet the minimum thickness.
 Repair deficiently primed areas in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations
 and as directed by the Inspector.
 Prime coat Structural Steel surfaces, except as noted in Section 544.3.4.6, “Bolted and
 Welded Connections.”
 Give steel Bridge sole plates one (1) coat of zinc rich primer. Mask-off strips where sole
 plates will be welded to beam flanges and surfaces that will be in contact with elastomeric
 bearing pads. After welding, apply a primer touch-up to the welded areas.
 544.3.4.6
 
 Bolted and Welded Connections
 
 Blast clean faying (contact) surfaces in accordance with SSPC-SP 10, and leave
 uncoated for bolting.
 Make uncoated areas slightly larger than the contact areas to ensure that the bolted
 connections clamp down only on the blast-cleaned Material and not on painted surfaces.
 Mask off faying areas to protect them from rust during hauling and storage. Apply a rust
 prohibitor to the faying surfaces or coat the faying areas with a Class B primer (slip coefficient
 equal to or greater than 0.50). The Department will approve the rust prohibitor or Class B
 primer. Before bolting, remove the rust prohibitor. Do not remove Class B primers before
 bolting, unless required.
 Immediately before bolting, ensure the exposed connection areas are in accordance with
 SSPC-SP 10. Apply the complete coating system to these surfaces after erection.
 Mask-off coating systems at connections to leave neat lines between the connections
 and previously coated areas.
 After blast cleaning, mask-off field weld areas before applying the primer and topcoats.
 After field welding, clean the welded areas in accordance with SSPC-SP 10 and apply the
 coating system.

 544.3.4.7
 
 Topcoat Application
 
 After cleaning and before applying the coating system, mask opposite sides of the
 diaphragms and stiffeners over areas that the direct tension indicators will bear on. Do not
 coat these areas until after erection and bolt tightening.
 Before applying the topcoat, tie coat the galvanized components using manufacturer’s
 recommended tie coat Material. Apply with a brush.
 The Project Manager will inspect the primed surfaces before the Contractor applies the
 topcoat.
 Do not apply the topcoat to the following Structural Steel surfaces:
 1.
 
 Faying surfaces of bolted connections (Section 544.3.4.6, “Bolted and Welded
 Connections”);
 
 2.
 
 The top flange top surfaces of beams, girders or diaphragms to be embedded in
 concrete;
 
 3.
 
 Bearing surfaces resting on concrete Substructures or are subject to sliding and
 rotational movement; and
 
 4.
 
 Bearing surfaces in contact with elastomeric bearing pads.
 
 Spray the topcoat with multiple spray gun passes. Apply a mist coat on the primer. Prespray edges, welds, bends, and other areas likely to be under the minimum thickness
 requirements.
 Apply full wet cross coats, separated by a few minutes if necessary, to achieve the
 desired film build with minimal surface bubbling.
 On weld seams, bolt heads, and flange joints it may be necessary to brush thinned-out
 Material to avoid bridging and to fill cracks and crevasses.
 544.3.4.8
 
 Urethane Protective Coat Application
 
 Apply the urethane protective coat after the topcoat has cured. Apply urethane protective
 coat in accordance with Section 544.3.4.1, “Required Coatings.”
 544.3.5 Handling Steel
 Protect uncoated faying surfaces to minimize corrosion during shipping and storage.
 Store Structural Steel on pallets so it does not rest on dirt. Store beams and girders in an

 Section 572:
 
 Cast-In-Place Concrete Pipe
 
 Page 516
 
 Excavate and backfill in accordance with Section 206, “Excavation and Backfill for
 Culverts and Minor Structures,” except as modified in Section 572.3.9.1, “Trench Excavation.”
 572.3.9.1
 
 Trench Excavation
 
 Construct the pipe in native soil capable of standing unsupported from the bottom of the
 trench to the top of the pipe without sloughing. The Contractor may construct the pipe in a fill
 section if it is compacted to at least 95% of the maximum dry density if tested in accordance
 with ASTM D 698.
 Excavate the trench to the lines and grades established by the Project Manager. Use a
 laser or other electronic Equipment to control the grade of the trench. Shape the trench to
 form the bottom outside of the pipe. Grade and prepare it to provide full, firm, and uniform
 support by the undisturbed earth, or rock, over a minimum of the bottom 210° of the outside of
 the pipe.
 When soft, spongy, or unstable Material appears in the pipe or in the bottom of the
 trench, remove the Material as directed by the quality administrator and the Project Manager.
 Backfill the resulting area with Material compacted to 95% of the maximum dry density in
 accordance with ASTM D 698.
 If boulders or rocks are in the bottom or sidewalls of the trench, remove them to at least
 six (6) inches from the nearest surface of the pipe. Next, backfill the space, and compact and
 reshape it as required for unsuitable Materials.
 If necessary to provide stability in the trench, slope the trench walls from a point 12 inch
 above the top of the pipe to the top of the trench, as required by soil conditions. Limit the pitch
 of the slope to a safe degree of stability that meets OSHA requirements for trench safety.
 572.3.10
 
 Placement
 
 Remove water entering the trench before constructing the pipe. Keep adjacent surfaces
 free of standing water, mud, and debris. Thoroughly moisten dry surfaces adjacent to the
 concrete being placed with water to keep it from neither drawing moisture from the freshly
 placed concrete nor expanding upon additional wetting.
 Place the concrete around the full circumference of the pipe monolithically in one (1)
 placement with fixed and traveling metal forms. Keep the invert of the pipe available for
 inspection during the placing of the concrete. Keep concrete free of rock pockets, and
 completely fill the forms.
 Achieve concrete consolidation with internal mechanical tampers or consolidation rings
 and vibrators that are an integral of the pipe forming Equipment. Use tamping and vibration to
 consolidate the concrete and secure a good bond between the pipe and the supporting soil.
 The Project Manager may require the use of a spud-type vibrator in the hopper to assist the
 flow and consolidation of the concrete.
 572.3.10.1
 
 Forms
 
 Use a fixed metal form that is strong enough to withstand vibrating or tamping, and
 ensure that workmen walking on the forms do not cause springing, bulging, or other types of
 distress.
 Ensure that the forms do not vary more than 1/2 inch from the lower edge of a straight
 edge laid parallel to the centerline of the form, and keep it free of holes larger than 0.6 inch.
 Ensure that the flow line of the finished pipe does not vary more than 0.125 ft from the
 specified grade.
 572.3.10.2
 
 Construction Joints
 
 Section 572:
 
 Cast-In-Place Concrete Pipe
 
 Page 517
 
 At the end of a Day’s placement, or when placement operations are interrupted for more
 than 30 min, form a construction joint. At construction joints, bevel the pipe walls downward at
 an approximate 45° angle, and leave rough. Embed 1/2-inch reinforcing bars that are
 24 inches long into the ends of the pipe walls. Space the reinforcing bars at 12 inches on
 center for pipes with diameters 42 inches and smaller, and at 18 inches on center for pipes
 with diameters larger than 42 inches.
 Within 30 minutes before pipe casting resumes, pipe end surface shall be thoroughly
 cleaned of foreign Materials, coatings, and loose or defective concrete, and thoroughly wetted.
 A tie-in cap shall be cast over joint across the top of pipe from trench wall to trench wall. The
 tie-in cap shall be 24 inches minimum in length and centered over the joint. Thickness shall
 be 1.5 times minimum wall thickness, shown in Table 572.3.5:1.
 572.3.10.3
 
 Collar
 
 Joint for connections to another pipe or structure shall be made by squaring off the end of
 pipe. Excavation of the trench shall be made along the sides and bottom of the pipe to permit
 casting of concrete collar. Collar shall be 24 inches minimum in length and centered on joint.
 Thickness shall be 1.5 times the minimum wall thickness shown in Table 572.3.5:1.
 572.3.10.4
 
 Cover and Backfill
 
 Ensure that the cover, measured from the top of the pipe to the bottom of the surfacing, is
 not less than 24 inches. Do not place backfill on pipes until the concrete has developed a
 compressive strength of at least 2,500 psi.
 572.3.10.5
 
 Temperature
 
 Refer to Section 511.3.3, “Temperature and Weather Limitations.”
 572.3.10.6
 
 Curing and Protecting Concrete
 
 Place polyethylene film in accordance with ASTM C 171 (except provide a 0.0015-inch
 nominal thickness) on the exposed top surface of the pipe immediately after casting the pipe.
 Immediately cover the film with up to three (3) inches of moist soil to hold the film in place and
 protect the pipe. Maintain a humid atmosphere within the pipe, evidenced by condensation on
 the interior surface, for at least seven (7) Days after placement. However, do not exceed the
 maximum period of 24 h for removing forms and making repairs. Take measures to prevent
 air drafts from drying pipe. Keep the ends covered except when conducting Work on the inside
 of the pipe. Leave other openings open so that the inside of the pipe can cure effectively.
 572.3.11
 
 Inspection and Repair of Pipe
 
 After removing the forms, make required repairs. Repair the offsets and indentations of
 the following size:
 1.
 
 Larger than 0.25 inch, for pipes with internal diameters of 42 inches or less;
 
 2.
 
 Larger than 0.38 inch, for pipes with internal diameters from greater than 42 inches
 to less than 72 inches;
 
 3.
 
 Larger than 1/2 inch, for pipes with internal diameters of 72 inches and greater.
 
 Repair defects not extending through the pipe wall and less than two (2) ft2, as directed
 by the Project Manager. Repair holes cut in the pipe, as directed by the Project Manager.
 572.3.11.1
 
 Crack Repairs
 
 Perform interior crack repairs after backfilling.
 Clean and fill transverse cracks with a width of 0.05 inch or more with an elastomeric
 compound approved by the Project Manager. Ensure that the elastomeric compound
 Section 572:
 
 Cast-In-Place Concrete Pipe
 
 Page 518
 
 penetrates into the crack at least 0.37 inch.
 The Department defines a longitudinal crack as a crack generally oriented within 30° of
 the pipe alignment. The Department may reject pipes with the following longitudinal cracks:
 1.
 
 A crack that has caused a surface fault within the pipe with a displacement greater
 than 0.08 inch;
 
 2.
 
 A crack with a width greater than 0.0005 times the outside diameter of the pipe, that
 can be penetrated by a standard machinist gauge leaf in accordance with
 AASHTO T 280; or
 
 3.
 
 A crack with a width greater than 0.05 inch, that can be penetrated by a standard
 machinist gauge leaf in accordance with AASHTO T 280.
 
 The Project Manager may allow pipes with longitudinal cracks to remain in place. In such
 a case, repair the cracks by full-depth epoxy pressure grouting.
 572.3.11.2
 
 Rejection of Pipe
 
 The Department may reject a pipe for any of the following conditions:
 1.
 
 Rock pockets, blisters, voids, fractures, porous concrete or similar defects that
 extend through the pipe wall or exceed two (2) ft2 (pipe may be rejected for one
 (1) foot on each side beyond the limits of the defects);
 
 2.
 
 The pipe is damaged during construction; or
 
 3.
 
 Contractor does not repair other cracks and defects as directed by the Project
 Manager.
 
 Replace rejected sections of pipe at no additional cost to the Department. Make the
 finished surface of the concrete pipe equivalent to a wood float surface, substantially free of
 fractures, cracks, and roughness.
 572.3.11.3
 
 Verification of Wall Thickness
 
 If requested by the Project Manager, drill four (4) ¾ inch diameter holes at approximately
 20-foot intervals, in the walls of the pipe to verify thickness. Drill one (1) hole in the top, one
 (1) hole in the bottom, and one (1) hole in each side of the pipe, as directed by the Project
 Manager. If a deficient wall thickness exists, drill enough additional holes to determine the
 nature and extent of the deficient thickness.
 572.3.12
 572.3.12.1
 
 Field Quality Control
 Load Tests
 
 Load tests shall be performed when required by Contract documents. Test load applied
 to the top of pipe shall be at least 125% of the maximum earth load plus live load to which the
 pipe will be subjected. The pipe shall be inspected before and after load testing. Load tests
 shall be made without disturbing the earth supporting the lower 230 degrees of pipe. The test
 load shall be applied in accordance with 572.4.1.1 or 572.4.1.2.
 572.3.12.2
 
 Sandbox Test
 
 Load shall be applied to a four (4) ft (1.2 m) length of pipe through a sandbox in such a
 manner that sand forms a bedding over 1/4 the circumference of the pipe, measured at the
 centerline of the crown. Sandbox shall be made of metal or dressed timber so heavy as to
 avoid appreciable bending by side pressure of sand. A strip of cloth or plastic film may be
 attached to the inside of the sandbox on each side, along the lower edge, to prevent the
 escape of sand between the sandbox and pipe. Depth of bedding above the pipe at the
 thinnest point shall be 1/4 the inside diameter of the pipe. Sandbox shall not contact pipe or
 sides of trench. Sandbox shall be filled with clean sand containing not less than five percent
 (5%) moisture and passing a 4.75 mm (No. 4) sieve. Upper surface of sand shall be struck off
 level with a straight edge and covered with a rigid top bearing plate. Lower surface of the
 Section 572:
 
 Cast-In-Place Concrete Pipe
 
 Page 519
 
 plate shall be a true plane made of heavy timbers or other rigid material capable of distributing
 the test load uniformly without appreciable bending. Test load shall be applied to the bearing
 plate by piling weights directly on the bearing plate or by moving heavy Equipment of
 predetermined weight onto the bearing plate. The bearing plate shall not be allowed to touch
 the sandbox.
 572.3.12.3
 
 Wheel Load Test
 
 A wheel load equivalent to the test load shall be applied to pipe.
 compacted fill shall be maintained between pipe and wheel load.
 572.3.12.4
 
 Two (2) feet of
 
 Hydrostatic Test

 604.3.2
 
 Geotextile Exposure After Placement
 
 Do not expose geotextiles to the elements after placement for more than 14 Days, unless
 otherwise directed by the Project Manager.
 604.3.3
 
 Site Preparation
 
 Prepare the installation site by clearing and grading the area and preparing a firm,
 smooth surface on which to place the geotextiles. Remove sharp objects and large stones
 and cut trees and shrubs flush with the smooth surface.
 Ensure correct orientation (roll direction). Place geotextiles as smoothly as possible on
 the prepared surface; pull tight, align, and anchor such that the geotextile is free of wrinkles
 and does not show evidence of holes, tears, or rips before placing cover Material on the
 geotextile. Before placing cover Material, hold geotextiles in place by pins, staples, or piles of
 fill or rock as required by fill placement procedures. On curves, fold or cut geotextiles to
 conform to the curve.
 The Department will not allow vehicles directly on the geotextile, but will allow vehicles
 after the Contractor places at least six (6) inches of cover Material on the geotextile. Do not
 allow vehicles to turn on the cover Material until at least two (2) lifts of cover Material have
 been placed.
 604.3.4
 
 Backfill
 
 Obtain approval from the Project Manager before beginning backfill operations. Do not
 end dump backfill directly onto exposed geotextile. Backfill by end dumping onto previously
 spread backfill and then pushing the dumped backfill over the exposed geotextile. On
 Subgrades having an R-value less than 10, dump and spread the Material placed on the
 geotextile to minimize the potential of a localized Subgrade failure.
 Backfill in layers from six (6) inches to eight (8) inches deep (uncompacted) unless
 otherwise specified in the Contract. After placement, compact each lift to 95% of maximum
 density in accordance with AASHTO T 180 (Modified Proctor), Method D (TTCP Modified).
 Compact the top lift in accordance with Section 207, “Subgrade Preparation.” The Contractor
 may use vibratory compaction Equipment on initial layers of Material, if approved by the
 Project Manager.
 Repair ruts occurring during construction by filling with additional Material and
 compacting to the specified density to maintain an even backfill surface and the minimum lift
 thickness over the geotextile.
 Obtain the Project Manager’s approval of geotextile placement before covering.
 604.3.5 Subsurface Drainage Geotextiles
 Place geotextiles in accordance with Section 605, “Drains,” where specified.
 Use subsurface drainage geotextiles against soil in an underground drainage system or
 in an edgedrain to allow for long-term passage of water into a subsurface drain system while

 applications is filtration.
 
 The primary function of the geotextile in subsurface drainage
 
 Provide one (1) soil sample to the Department for testing to confirm the applicable
 apparent opening size based on the percent of in situ soil passing the No. 200 sieve and
 cohesiveness (PI).
 Compact the aggregate with vibratory Equipment to a minimum compaction of 95% of
 maximum density in accordance with AASHTO T 180 (Modified Proctor), Method D (TTCP
 Modified). If a higher compactive effort is necessary, substitute a geotextile suited for more
 severe installation conditions.
 604.3.6
 
 Sediment Control Geotextiles
 
 Place geotextiles in accordance with Section 603, “Temporary Erosion and Sediment
 Control,” where necessary.
 Place and maintain sediment control geotextiles as a temporary control measure to
 prevent eroded soil from being transported off the construction site to rivers, streams, and
 impoundments and to prevent damage to private property from storm water runoff.
 604.3.7 Erosion Control Geotextiles
 Place geotextiles in accordance with Section 602, “Slope and Erosion Protection
 Structures,” where necessary.
 Use erosion control geotextiles between erosion control Structures (rip-rap and gabions)
 and the in situ soil to prevent soil loss resulting in excessive scour and to mitigate hydraulic
 uplift pressures that may cause instability of an erosion control structure.
 604.3.8
 
 Separation/Stabilization Geotextiles
 
 Use separation/stabilization geotextiles as a semi-permeable separator to prevent mixing
 of a Subgrade soil and sub-base or base Material.

 except in areas approved by the Project Manager, incline the boreholes to a maximum of 30°
 Section 624:
 
 Wire Mesh for Slope Stabilization
 
 Page 607
 
 off the perpendicular in order to intercept and seat the steel bolts/anchors in solid rock.
 Upon completion of drilling, blow the drilled holes clean with compressed air with an
 operating air pressure of at least 50 psi introduced at the back of the hole.
 Use the manufacturer’s recommended hole diameter for the steel bolts/anchors.
 Ensure that the clearance between the steel bolt/anchor and borehole wall is from 1/8
 inch to 3/16 inch.
 624.3.2
 
 Anchor Installation
 
 Carefully follow the manufacturer’s recommended installation procedures for steel
 bolts/anchors.
 During construction, the Contractor may reduce the center-to-center spacing in order to
 maximize anchorage by selective bolting/anchoring in sound rock or to eliminate large voids
 between the wire mesh and the slope face.
 Use steel bolts/hooked anchors that are at least six (6) feet long. Ensure that the steel
 bolts extend at least one (1) foot into sound rock.
 As construction progresses, the rock conditions encountered may require the lengths of
 the steel bolts/hooked anchors to be greater than the minimum length, so the Project Manager
 may direct varied lengths. If using varied lengths, the Department will allow the Contractor to
 use steel couplings or other methods recommended by the manufacturer.
 624.3.2.1
 
 Tensioning and Testing of Steel Bolts and Earth Anchors
 
 Tension steel bolts and earth anchors in accordance with the manufacturer's
 recommendations. Use a minimum torque of 200 lbf•ft, unless otherwise specified.
 After installation, test a randomly selected set of ten percent (10%) of the bolts or
 anchors to confirm the specified working load. If more than one third of these fail, test all
 bolts/anchors.
 After replacing the failed bolts and anchors, test another randomly selected set of ten
 percent (10%) of bolts and anchors, not including those previously tested and accepted.
 Repeat the procedure until obtaining the satisfactory results.
 Replace unacceptable bolts and anchors at no additional cost to the Department.
 624.3.3
 
 Installation of Wire Mesh
 
 If the Contract specifies, use PVC-coated wire mesh.
 Lap the wire mesh at least six (6) inches and securely bind the perimeter edges of wire
 mesh so that the joints formed by tying the selvedges have a minimum strength equal to that
 of the body of the mesh.
 Space ties, connectors, locking clips, or hog rings used for fastening edges four (4)
 inches apart or less. The Contractor may lace perimeter edges with binding wire by tightly
 looping it through every mesh opening.
 Extend wire mesh down the face of the slope and anchor it to the face of the slope by
 resin-grouted steel bolts or anchors, as required.
 Hold wire mesh in place by the bearing base plates to stretch it to the maximum and
 contour it to the existing surface.
 Section 624:

 660.3
 
 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 
 660.3.1
 
 Trenching and Excavation
 
 Grades for underground utility lines are the invert (inside bottom of the pipe) unless the
 Contract specifies otherwise.
 During excavation, pile Material suitable for backfill in an orderly manner far enough away
 from the banks of the trench to avoid overloading and to prevent slides or cave-ins.
 Perform grading necessary to prevent surface water from flowing into trenches or other
 excavations; remove water that has accumulated by pumping or with other approved methods.
 Perform trenching far enough in advance of pipe laying to allow the Project Manager to
 make necessary grade changes. Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, begin backfilling
 immediately after laying pipe and keep pace with pipe-laying operations.
 660.3.1.1
 
 Trench Widths
 
 Ensure that trenches are wide enough to properly lay, align, grade, and joint the pipe.
 Dig trenches to at least 24 inches wide, but in no case should they exceed 1.4 times the
 outside diameter of the pipe, plus 24 inches, plus twice the thickness of shoring structures, at
 the level of the top of the pipe.
 The Contractor may use excavation for concrete Structures as the outside form, if
 approved by the Project Manager.
 If trenching is behind a curb, in lawns, or adjacent to Sidewalks or walls, ensure that the
 trench is not wider than the outside diameter of the pipe plus 24 inches at the trench top.
 Provide sheeting or bracing as necessary.
 The Department will consider over depth excavation not ordered by the Project Manager
 as unauthorized. Fill the unauthorized excavation with granular or compacted embedment
 Material or concrete, as directed by the Project Manager at no additional cost to the
 Department.
 660.3.1.2
 
 Shaping Trench Bottoms
 
 Accurately grade trench bottoms for pipe six (6) inches or smaller to provide uniform
 bearing and support throughout the length of each section of pipe. Finish the bottom of the
 trench by excavating a shallow concave groove at the line of the pipe and shape it
 approximately to fit the pipe.
 Excavate trench bottoms for larger pipe to below the grade line, as necessary, to allow
 the installation of granular embedment foundation Material for the pipe.
 Dig bell holes and depressions for joints after grading the trench bottom so that the full
 length of the pipe rests on the prepared bottom. Make these depressions the length, depth,
 and width necessary to properly fit the particular type of joint.
 Do not excavate below the specified final trench bottom elevation, unless the Contract
 Section 660:
 
 Excavation, Trenching, and Backfilling for Utilities
 
 Page 622
 
 requires granular embedment foundation Material.
 660.3.1.3
 
 Foundations
 
 Remove wet or otherwise unstable soil, incapable of properly supporting the pipe, and
 backfill the trench to grade with granular embedment foundation Material or other suitable
 Material.
 If the Contractor excavates deeper than the specified grade, the Contractor shall backfill
 the trench to grade with granular embedment foundation Material or other approved Material.
 Thoroughly tamp the replacement foundation Material to provide a solid bed for the pipe. The
 Project Manager will determine if Material from the trench is acceptable.
 660.3.1.4
 
 Rock Excavation
 
 Remove rock that is not rippable with a rip tooth, or that occurs in masses larger than 1/2
 3
 yd or ledges at least four (4) inches thick in accordance with Section 203, “Excavation,
 Borrow, and Embankment.”
 If the Contractor encounters solid rock during excavation, the Contractor shall excavate
 to a depth six (6) inches below the outside bottom of the pipe and backfill the trench to the
 proper grade.
 If Materials cannot be handled or compacted as earth (including rock), the Contractor
 shall separate them from excavated Materials that the Contractor shall use as fill or
 Embankment Material.
 Dispose of rock separated from fill Material as approved by the Project Manager.
 660.3.1.5
 
 Wet Excavation Requirements
 
 Keep trenches and other excavations free of water by bailing, pumping, or draining during
 construction operations. Keep water away from concrete or cement joints until the Materials
 attain initial set.
 Provide the following, as necessary:
 1.
 
 Cofferdams;
 
 2.
 
 Pumps;
 
 3.
 
 Drains;
 
 4.
 
 Ditches;

 Dispose of water by pumping it into ditches, storm drains, or sanitary sewers in accordance
 with applicable regulations.
 660.3.2
 
 Bracing and Sheeting
 
 The Department will allow the Contractor to cut trench banks on slopes to prevent sliding
 and caving where the increased trench width will not interfere with surface features or
 encroach on Right of Way limits. Slopes may not intersect vertical trench walls more than 12
 inches above the top of pipe.
 Do not remove sheeting and bracing until sufficient backfill is in place to protect the utility
 Structures and the adjacent Roadway from caving damage.

 Light emitting diode signal modules must fit into the existing pedestrian signal section
 housings built in accordance with the requirements in the VTCSH without modification.
 The LED signal module consists of a double side-by-side message combining the
 symbols of a hand and walking person. Arrange the LEDs in a manner to form an outline of
 the symbols. The shape of the outline must conform to the standard symbols for pedestrian
 signals.
 Ensure that the measured chromaticity coordinates for the “lunar white” walking person
 and the “portland orange” hand are in accordance with Section 8.04 and Figure 1 of the
 VTCSH. Ensure that the chromaticity measurements remain unchanged over the input line
 voltage range from 120 V AC: 80 V to 135 V, 240 V AC: 184 V to 276 V, 12 V DC: 8 V to 24 V.

 installation into existing Traffic Signal housing. Manufacture the LED signal module assembly
 to withstand mechanical shock and vibration from high winds and other sources.
 Do not exceed the maximum rating for DC current recommended by the LED
 manufacturer used by the driver board to drive the LEDs. Use the driver board to regulate the
 LED drive current on both the hand and walking man messages to compensate for line voltage
 fluctuations over the range of 120 V AC: 80 V to 135 V, 240 V AC: 184 V to 276 V. Ensure
 that the luminous output does not vary more than ten percent (10%) over the voltage range
 and that it is not perceptible to the human eye. Use drive circuitry that includes voltage surge
 protection to withstand high-repetition noise transients and low-repetition high-energy
 transients in accordance with Section 2.1.6, NEMA Standards TS-2, 1992. Provide onboard
 circuitry in accordance with FCC regulations concerning the emission of electronic noise (47
 C.F.R. § 15.101 et seq.). Ensure compatibility in the circuitry, proper triggering and operation

 Loop Detectors Installation Requirements and Procedures
 
 Section 713:
 
 Detectors
 
 Page 735
 
 713.3.4.1.1
 
 Saw Cuts
 
 Make saw cuts using an abrasive cutting wheel concrete saw. Make saw cuts from
 2¼ inch to 2½ inch deep and approximately 0.275 inch wide. Use a ⅜ inch wide slot to install
 ducted loop wire.
 If the Contract requires new pavement or additional paving material overlay, make the
 saw cut and wire installation at least below the last paving layer of ⅝ inch or greater thickness.
 The Department will not allow saw cuts in the final layer of surfacing. In the case of pavement
 overlay, make a saw cut a minimum of two (2) inches below the final surfacing elevation.
 Install piezoelectric detectors in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations, which
 may require saw cutting of the open-graded friction course.
 If the Contract specifies heater-scarification pavement treatment, make the saw cuts after
 completing this operation. Provide two (2) inch diameter holes, drilled at angle points to the
 same depth as the saw cuts. The Department will allow 45° angle cuts made at corners
 instead of drilled holes. The Department will not allow sharp corners greater than 45° between
 overlapping saw cuts. Also, drill cuts across concrete pavement expansion joints to allow wire
 slack. Overlap saw cuts by a sufficient length to provide a smooth bottom, even-depth wire
 channel. If there is more than one (1) loop terminating at a pull box, provide each loop with a
 separate saw cut back to the box. Make these saw cuts no closer than six (6) inches. Before
 placement of the sealant and wire, clean the saw cut of debris and standing water by blowing
 out with compressed air. The Department will allow the pavement surface to be damp to the
 touch. Ensure the inside of the saw cut is free of sharp protrusions from loose aggregate or
 uneven saw cuts.
 713.3.4.1.2
 
 Rigid Electrical Conduit Entrance
 
 Provide a separate one (1) inch rigid electrical conduit entrance at the pull box for each
 loop. Begin the rigid conduit at the end of the pavement saw cut and run under any curb and
 gutter, and Sidewalk. Leave slack in wire through the conduit entrances, and seal the end of
 the conduit with a soft-setting butyl rubber or asphalt joint sealer. Fill the remainder of the hole
 with the appropriate material and approved saw cut sealant.
 713.3.4.1.3
 
 Loop Wire Placement
 
 Place a continuous run of loop wire in the saw cut and wind around the coil section the
 number of turns specified in the Contract, or directed by the Project Manager. Install no more
 than four (4) wires or turns in a single saw cut. Leave wire run through drilled corners and joint
 crossings slack. Encapsulate the slack portion of wire with a soft-setting butyl rubber or
 asphalt joint sealer. Installation of ducted loop wire during a paving operation by securely
 attaching the loop in the proper shape to the pavement surface and overlaying with the next
 paving layer(s) of two (2) inches or greater total thickness is allowable. Secure the loop before
 overlaying by placing the ducted wire in a slot cut in the pavement, or by securing the corners
 using a method approved by the Project Manager, then covering the wire by hand with a small
 amount of asphalt paving material. Do not bend the ducted loop wire to less than a one
 (1) inch radius.
 713.3.4.1.4
 
 Sealant Application
 
 Do not place sealant, if the air temperature is below 40 °F or if precipitation is occurring
 or impending. Place sealant in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
 Place sealant in saw cut using a special nozzle. Fill the saw cut to within approximately
 ⅛ inch of the top. Do not allow spillover onto the pavement surface; immediately strike off
 excess material.
 713.3.4.1.5
 
 Multiple-Loop Systems
 
 If using a multiple-loop system (same channel), wind adjacent loops with opposite
 rotations. Accomplish rotation reversal by reversing leads at the pull box. Mark the beginning
 Section 713:
 
 Detectors
 
 Page 736
 
 of the loop wire and the pull box before beginning the winding process to identify the direction
 of rotation. Connect multiple loops in series to the lead-in cable at the pull box or splice point.
 713.3.5
 
 Loop Lead-in Cable Installation
 
 Run loop lead-in cable continuously from the loop wire splice to the terminal in the control
 cabinet. The Department will not allow splices in the lead-in cable.
 Connect the drain (ground) wire in the lead-in cable to earth ground at the cabinet end
 only. Neatly clip off the ground wire at the curbside pull box adjacent to the end of the outer
 jacket.
 Solder connections between the loop wire and the lead-in cable. Do not use open flame
 torches for soldering. Make splices waterproof by stripping from ¼ inch to ½ inch of the
 insulation, and inserting into a self-sealing epoxy-filled twist-on connector in accordance with
 Section 711.3.4.1, “Spring-Type Connector." Use of a two-part sealant, DBY-3M #3570
 connector sealant, or approved equal is allowable.
 Wrap #3570 connector splices with a high-quality all-weather electrical tape, or approved
 self-bonding tape, by overlapping the wire insulation approximately one (1) inch and in layers
 equal to or greater than 1½ times the thickness of the original wire insulation. Seal the outer
 jacket of the cable in a similar manner, except overlap the tape on the outer jacket four
 (4) inches.
 If using ducted loop wire, apply sealant at the end of the tube portion and then wrap with
 tape to prevent water entry. Suspend the “V” splices formed high in the pull box to prevent
 immersion in water.
 713.3.6
 
 Integrity Test Check
 
 After completing loop installation in the Roadway, check each loop with a megger, if
 required, to ensure the integrity of the installation. Ensure that the resistance of each loop is
 greater than 100 MΩ. If directed by the Project Manager, check the completed loop detector
 system in accordance with Section 713.2.3.8, “Testing.”

 Phase Control Functions
 
 Ensure each phase is capable of the following functions:
 1.
 
 Max Recall (Non Act). Automatically returns the phase and extends green timing
 to that of maximum green. In absence of an opposing phase demand, the controller
 rest in green;
 
 2.
 
 Ped Recall (Non Act). Automatically returns phase to walk-ped clearance and
 vehicle right-of-way without vehicle and pedestrian demand;
 
 3.
 
 Veh. Recall (Ext.). Automatically places a recurring demand for vehicle service
 without actual vehicle demand when not in its green interval;
 
 4.
 
 Non-Locking (Memory Off). Phase operates in fully actuated mode. Memory of
 vehicle demand is retained only when a vehicle is in the detection zone (detector
 outputting);
 
 5.
 
 Locking (Memory On). Phase operates in fully actuated mode. Memory of vehicle
 demand (detector output) is retained in the phase until that phase is served.
 
 714.2.1.6
 714.2.1.6.1
 
 Operational Requirements
 Timing Requirements
 
 Provide an initial interval control for each phase that determines the guaranteed minimum
 green period for that phase. The minimum green period consists of the sum of the walk
 interval and the greater of the pedestrian clearance interval or minimum green interval with
 pedestrian or pedestrian and vehicle actuation.
 Ensure that each phase provides vehicles additional green time beyond the minimum
 green time by vehicle actuations by means of an extension interval control. Ensure that
 successive actuations cancel the remainder of the previous extension interval and initiate a
 new extension interval for the vehicle that provided the actuation. Should transfer of right-ofway occur while an extension interval is un-expired, ensure that the right-of-way returns at the
 next opportunity in the cycle.
 Equip each phase with at least two (2) maximum green timing interval controls that set a
 limit on the time that continuous traffic during the right-of-way phase can be extended, after an
 actuation is registered for any conflicting phase. Maximum interval (MAX 1) is for normal
 operation. Maximum interval (MAX 2) is for external and internal input.
 
 Section 714:
 
 Traffic Signal Controllers
 
 Page 742
 
 Provide each phase with a clearance period consisting of a yellow change interval and a
 red clearance interval, both of preset duration.
 Ensure that the presence of a pedestrian is registered upon actuation of a pedestrian
 push button during a pedestrian clearance interval, or whenever the “Don’t Walk” signal is
 displayed, so that the walk signal occurs at the next assignment of right-of-way to the phase.
 Ensure that the phase is capable of recycling and providing pedestrian and pedestrian
 clearance intervals when a pedestrian actuation is registered on a phase with no demand for
 pedestrian or vehicular right-of-way on a conflicting phase. The pedestrian clearance interval
 is the minimum and guaranteed pedestrian protection. Ensure that the “Don’t Walk” display is
 steady during the remaining right-of-way and clearance intervals.
 714.2.1.6.2
 
 Phasing Requirements
 
 The Department does not want the Equipment to give the right-of-way to any Street
 without an actuation (call). In the absence of traffic or recall option, the Department wants the
 right-of-way to remain on the Street where it was last assigned, unless the “RED REST” option
 is implemented. If the “RED REST” option is used, ensure that the controller cycles to all red
 and remains until a phase call.
 Provide controllers that operate in a concurrent phase timing, dual-ring or sequential,
 single-ring configuration. Number and operate all phases in accordance with a NEMA dualring (quad-left) configuration or sequential configuration. Provide controllers capable of
 operating at least eight (8) field phases.
 Provide controllers capable of assigning the right-of-way to a single phase or any
 combination of non-conflicting phases. Specify phases skipped on each ring for no demand,
 and recall functions for each phase for sequential controllers. Provide controllers capable of
 providing four (4) overlap phases in any phase combination, and programmable on both a
 Standard NEMA plug-in overlap program board and operator keyboard entry.

 SECTION 901:
 
 QUALITY CONTROL/QUALITY ASSURANCE (QC/QA)
 
 DEFINITIONS:
 Direct Supervision. The required supervision of a TTCP trainee by a certified TTCP
 technician who is on a Project with the trainee and who is both signing off and is personally
 responsible for all of that trainee’s sampling and testing procedures, results and reports.
 Qualified Sampling and Testing Technician. A technician who has been certified under
 TTCP to independently perform inspections, sampling, and testing in specified Materials
 testing area(s) for either Quality Control or Acceptance testing. The term “qualified” and
 “certified” have the same meaning.
 TTCP Trainee. A technician who has attended the appropriate TTCP training class and has
 a certificate of completion, and is receiving required “on-the-job-training” under the direct
 supervision of a TTCP certified technician, as such is eligible to take a particular TTCP
 certification exam.
 Validation. A procedure using statistical methods to compare the Contractor’s and the
 Department’s test results, specifically, the F-test to compare variances and T-test to compare
 means.
 901.1 INSPECTIONS AND TESTING OF MATERIALS
 901.1.1
 
 General
 
 Materials are subject to inspection, sampling, and testing before Acceptance of the Work.
 References in the Contract to test methods or Specifications are to the latest versions as of
 the Bid Advertisement date, unless otherwise noted. Test methods may be subject to
 modification at the discretion of the State Materials Bureau. The Department’s current TTCP
 Manual contains AASHTO and ASTM test method modifications. Testing frequency must be
 equal to or greater than the Minimum Testing Requirements, available here:
 http://dot.state.nm.us
 The Department will sample and test Materials for Acceptance unless otherwise specified
 in the Contract. The Department will provide Acceptance test results to the Contractor within
 2 Working Days after sampling, but only after Contractor QC tests have been received for the
 same sublot, and will provide other test results to the Contractor upon request. Department
 testing is not intended for Quality Control.
 901.1.2 Technician Certification
 Ensure that testing is performed under the direct supervision of an individual certified by
 the State Materials Bureau’s TTCP. Certification is based on demonstration of abilities for test
 methods and procedures, and a written test. The TTCP Board of Directors, in conjunction with
 the State Materials Bureau and the State Construction Bureau, will establish term and
 expiration date of certification and requirements for renewal of certification. If the competence
 of a certified individual is questioned, the question of competence must be documented in
 accordance with the TTCP Manual. The TTCP Manual requires a written complaint be
 addressed to the TTCP Administrator or the State Materials Engineer. The State Materials
 Bureau will investigate the concern through the TTCP. If this investigation substantiates the
 concern, disciplinary action such as probation, revocation, or suspension of certification will be
 implemented in accordance with procedures established by the TTCP Board of Directors.
 901.1.3
 
 Acceptance Sampling and Testing
 
 The Department will sample and test in accordance with Table 901.7:6, “Minimum
 Acceptance Guidelines,” or at a lesser sublot size for Acceptance purposes as determined by
 the Project Manager before production of material begins. If Material appears defective, or if
 the Project Manager determines that a change in the process or product has occurred,
 additional sampling and testing may occur. When additional informational sampling and
 Section 901:
 
 Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QC/QA)
 
 Page 779
 
 testing is performed, the results will be used only to determine if corrective actions need to be
 taken by the Contractor and will not be incorporated into the quality level analysis.
 The Department will conduct Acceptance testing independently from the Contractor’s
 Quality Control testing. If the Department’s Acceptance testing validates in method and
 property to the Contractor’s Quality Control testing, the Department will use both for
 Acceptance and pay factor determination. Use of the Contractor’s test results is dependent on
 the following conditions:
 1.
 
 The Contractor uses Quality Control procedures as described in Section 901.2,
 “Contractor Quality Control.”
 
 2.
 
 The Department validates the Contractor’s test results against the Department’s test
 results using the F-test and T-test, conducted at a level of significance of 0.01.
 
 3.
 
 The Contractor shall use all test results from the Contractor's random sampling plan
 as detailed in the Quality Control plan per Section 901.2.1, “Quality Control Plan.”
 Do not include informational test data obtained by test results beyond the
 Contractor’s random sampling plan locations. If a split sample is taken to determine
 deviations between Contractor and Department process, only data obtained from a
 random sampling plan location can be utilized in the quality level analysis. If a split
 sample is tested by the Contractor and Department for informational purposes and
 the location does not represent either the Contractor’s or Department’s random
 sampling plan locations, neither test data results are to be included in the quality
 level analysis.
 
 If the Department cannot validate the Contractor’s test data at any time during the
 Project, the Project Manager and Quality Control technician will investigate to determine why
 and make corrections if possible. If the discrepancy cannot be resolved, then, unless
 otherwise approved by the Assistant District Engineer for Construction, the Department will
 determine the pay factor using the Department’s test values only for all characteristics.
 901.2
 
 CONTRACTOR QUALITY CONTROL
 
 Perform Quality Control sampling, testing, and inspection in accordance with
 Table 901.7:3, “Minimum Process Control Guidelines for Aggregates and Base Course,”
 Table 901.7:4, “ Minimum Process Control Guidelines for Hot Mix Asphalt,” and Table 901.7:5,
 “Minimum Process Control Guidelines for Portland Cement Concrete Pavement.”
 901.2.1
 
 Quality Control Plan
 
 Provide a Quality Control plan to control the quality of the product. At the PreConstruction Conference, be prepared to discuss Quality Control responsibilities for specific
 Contract Items. Submit the Quality Control plan to the Project Manager at least two (2) weeks
 before starting Work. Itemize inspections, testing procedures, sampling and testing
 frequencies, and corrective action strategies that the Contractor will use to control the Work.
 Develop the Quality Control plan using the Department's Contractor Process Quality Control
 Plan Guidelines available from the Project Manager or State Construction Bureau. Do not
 begin Work that requires Quality Control testing for Acceptance without a Quality Control plan
 that has been reviewed and approved by the Project Manager and the District Laboratory
 Supervisor. Provide written certification that testing Equipment is calibrated and meets the
 applicable Specifications.
 901.2.2
 
 Quality Control Laboratory
 
 Perform the Quality Control testing using a private testing Laboratory or a Contractor
 provided Laboratory. Use a portable or permanent Quality Control Type II Laboratory in
 accordance with Section 622.3.2.2, “Field Office Equipment.” Calibrate or check testing
 Equipment in accordance with AASHTO R 18 and any time the Equipment is moved. Maintain
 calibration documentation at the Laboratory and provide this to the Project Manager upon
 request. The Project Manager in conjunction with the District Lab Supervisor will determine
 acceptability of the Quality Control Laboratory. Allow the Department unrestricted access to
 Section 901:
 
 Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QC/QA)
 
 Page 780
 
 the Laboratory. The Department will conduct independent inspection of the Contractor’s field
 Laboratory. The Project Manager will provide the Contractor a written accounting of
 Laboratory deficiencies.
 901.2.3 Plan Administration and Technician Qualification
 Identify the individual who will administer the plan. The individual shall have full authority
 to take actions necessary for the successful operation of the plan. Quality Control Technicians
 (QCT’s) performing the actual sampling, testing, or inspection shall be TTCP certified as
 described in Section 901.1.2, “Technician Certification.” Cease production if certified
 personnel are unavailable on the Project.
 901.2.4
 
 Sampling
 
 The sampling plan shall contain a random sampling selection technique in accordance
 with specified Department, AASHTO, or ASTM procedures, as modified by the State Materials
 Bureau. Allow the Project Manager to witness all sampling and testing. Take additional
 samples if directed by the Project Manager. The sampling plan shall be submitted as a
 component of the Quality Control Plan.
 901.2.5
 
 Testing
 
 The Department will use test results from the random sampling plan only in the quality
 level analysis for pay factor determination. Additional informational test results will not be
 used in the quality level analysis. The Contractor shall provide original Quality Control test
 results (on approved forms including all original supporting handwritten worksheets and notes)
 to the Project Manager within 1 Working Days of sampling. The Technician performing the
 testing shall sign and certify the results as “true and accurate to the best of my belief and
 knowledge” prior to providing the results to the Department. Failure to provide the results
 within 1 Working Day of sampling may result in the Project Manager ordering the Contractor to
 cease HMA operations until said results are provided to the Project Manager.
 901.2.6
 
 Records
 
 Maintain copies of the complete set of original Quality Control test records (including
 supporting documents (calculations, scratch sheets, internal forms etc.) and, upon request,
 make them available to the Project Manager within 24 hours. No hard copy Laboratory testing
 documentation shall be destroyed for any reason, even after the data is entered into the
 computer spreadsheet for analysis. If complete records are not provided as requested, the
 Department may determine the pay factor using the Department’s test values only for all
 testing characteristics. Maintain copies of test documentation for a minimum of three (3) years
 after the Physical Completion Date of the Project.
 901.2.7
 
 Control Charts
 
 Update Department-approved test control charts daily on all tests in accordance with
 Table 901.7:3, “Minimum Process Control Guidelines for Aggregates and Base Course,”
 Table 901.7.4, “Minimum Process Control Guidelines for Hot-Mix Asphalt,” and Table 901.7:5,
 “Minimum Process Control Guidelines for Portland Cement Concrete Pavement.” Keep at a
 location approved by the Project Manager. Provide at least the following information on the
 charts:
 1.
 
 Project number;
 
 2.
 
 Contract Item number;
 
 3.
 
 Test number;
 
 4.
 
 Each test parameter;
 
 5.
 
 Upper and lower specification limit applicable to each test parameter; and
 
 6.
 
 The Contractor's test results.
 
 Section 901:
 
 Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QC/QA)
 
 Page 781
 
 Use the charts for identifying product and Equipment problems, and potential pay factor
 reductions. Notify the Project Manager of any identified problems within 4 hours.
 901.3
 
 INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE TESTING
 
 TTCP certified independent personnel will perform Independent Assurance testing on
 split samples from Quality Control and Acceptance programs to ensure that the Contractor
 and Department field personnel are using correct and accurate procedures and the proper
 Equipment. These personnel will not have direct responsibility for Quality Control or
 Acceptance testing.
 901.4
 
 EVALUATION OF MATERIALS FOR ACCEPTANCE
 
 The Department will analyze lot Acceptance test results collectively and statistically using
 the Quality Level Analysis method. Quality Level Analysis is a statistical procedure for
 estimating the percent compliance with a specification; it is affected by shifts in the arithmetic
 mean, and by the sample standard deviations. The Department will use this analysis to
 estimate the total percent of the lot that is within specification limits. The maximum pay
 factor per lot is 1.0.
 The Department may accept a lot containing Material below a pay factor of 1.00 at a
 reduced price, in accordance with the following criteria:
 1.
 
 The composite pay factor is at least 0.75;
 
 2.
 
 There are no rejectable individual criteria (Agency, Contractor or Combined); and
 
 3.
 
 The Project Manager does not identify isolated defects (i.e., segregation, or other
 construction related material defects).
 
 The Department will consider a written request to accept a Material lot below the Target
 Value (TV) that does not meet the above criteria, but at a composite pay factor not to exceed
 0.50. The Contractor shall include an engineering analysis showing expected Material
 performance. The Assistant District Engineer for Construction will decide if the Material may
 remain in place and determine the final pay factor for the material in question. If less than
 three (3) samples are obtained at the time a lot is terminated, they shall be incorporated in the
 prior lot. If no prior lot exists, the disposition of the material shall be decided by the Assistant
 District Engineer for Construction after evaluating with Non-QLA criteria in accordance with
 Section 423.3.6.2.1.1.
 The Project Manager may reject Material that appears to be defective based on visual
 inspection.
 901.5
 
 QUALITY LEVEL ANALYSIS (QLA)
 
 Use the following steps to calculate the standard deviation:
 1.

 For gradations to control crushing operations, the Contractor may, at its own risk, modify
 AASHTO T 146 to improve the test result timelines. Modified method tests will not be
 considered in Acceptance determinations by the Project Manager.

 Take measurements at a randomly selected location. Determine thickness by removing all of
 the in-place compacted Material, placing a straight edge tool (i.e. a survey lath) across the
 hole, measuring the thickness to the nearest 1/4 inch using a measuring tape, and then
 replacing and recompacting the removed material.
