 102.3 Examinations of Documents, Site and Other Information Before submitting a Bid, the
 Bidder is responsible for: (A) obtaining and examining the Plans, Specifications, all Bid
 Amendments, and all other Bid Documents; (B) examining the Geotechnical Information and
 all other information provided or referenced in the Bid Documents; (C) examining the site(s) of

 Opening. For a related provision, see Section 102.7.2 - Effects of Signing and Delivery of Bid.
 102.3.1 Geotechnical Information Bidders and Contractors are obligated to examine and, if
 necessary, obtain geotechnical information. If one is available, the project geotechnical report
 may be accessed at the Department’s web site.
 The Department shall not be responsible for the Bidders’ and Contractors’ interpretations of or
 estimates or conclusions drawn from the Geotechnical Information. Data provided may not be
 representative of the subsurface conditions between the boring locations.
 This section does not diminish the duties imposed upon parties in Section 102 or in any other
 sections.
 102.4 Estimated Quantities Quantities shown in the Bid Documents are estimates; only to
 be used for the preparation and comparison of Bids. For related provisions, see Sections 109.1Changes in Quantities and 109.2 - Elimination of Items.

 information that may significantly affect the cost, quality, Conformity, or timeliness of the
 Work. If a Bidder discovers any such ambiguity, etc., it must notify the Bid Contact Person
 immediately in writing. Failure to provide such notice constitutes a waiver of any claim for
 entitlement for additional compensation or time related to such ambiguity, etc.
 102.5.3 Bid Amendment The Department will interpret or modify the Bid Documents only
 by written Bid Amendment or other writing issued by the Department’s Contracts Section. The
 Department is not bound by any other oral or written representations, including information

 Bid Bonds for electronic Bids must be delivered, received, or faxed to the number in the
 Notice to Contractors before the Bid Opening time. Original Bid Bonds must be received within
 48 hours for faxed submittals. Electronic Bid Bonds which accompany electronic Bids are
 acceptable.
 102.7 Delivery of Bids
 102.7.1 Location and Time The Bidder must Deliver its Bid and Bid Guaranty in a sealed
 envelope to the exact location and before the precise time (as determined by the Department)
 specified in the Notice to Contractors or any applicable Bid Amendment. The Bid and Bid
 Guaranty must be signed by duly authorized individuals. The sealed envelope must be labeled
 with the Bidder's name, the Project location, WIN, and the words “Bid Enclosed”. As a
 minimum, the Bidder will submit a Bid Package consisting of the Notice to Contractors, the
 completed Acknowledgement of Bid Amendments form, the completed Schedule of Items, 2
 copies of the completed Agreement, Offer, & Award form, a Bid Bond or Bid Guarantee, and
 any other Certifications or Bid Requirements listed in the Bid Book. For a related provision, see
 Section 102.11 - "Bid Responsiveness".
 Electronic Bids must be submitted to the appropriate electronic bid system before the precise
 time (as determined by the Department) specified in the Notice to Contractors or any applicable
 Bid Amendment.
 102.7.2 Effects of Signing and Delivery of Bids
 A. Offer and Agreement to Pre-execution Terms The signing and Delivery of a Bid
 represents: (1) an offer by the Bidder to perform the Work for the price(s) submitted within
 the time(s) specified and in Conformity with all provisions of the Bid Documents; and (2)
 the Bidder’s Agreement to all the provisions of the Bid Documents governing requirements
 
 1-24
 
 and procedures applicable before Contract Execution. The Bidder's offer shall be
 irrevocable until the expiration of the time for Contract Execution by the Department set
 forth in Section 103.8, except as provided in Sections 102.8 and 102.10 regarding
 withdrawal of Bids.
 B. Bidder Representations By signing and Delivering a Bid, the Bidder represents that:
 (1) the Bidder has performed the examinations required by Section 102.3 - Examinations of
 Documents, Site and Other Information; (2) the Bidder has given the Department written
 notice of all ambiguities, etc. discovered by the Bidder as required by Section 102.5.2 Bidder’s Duty to Notify Department if Ambiguities Discovered; and (3) the Bidder has
 sufficient knowledge of the Bid Documents, Geotechnical Information, the site, and other
 conditions to properly price, schedule, plan, and perform the Work.
 C. Certifications By signing and Delivering a Bid on federally funded or partially
 federally funded Contract, the Bidder certifies as provided in all federal certifications set
 forth in the Bid Book, including those set forth in Section 1 thereof. By signing and
 Delivering a Bid, the Bidder further certifies as provided in Section 105.10.2(F) Certification of Continuing EEO Efforts.
 102.8 Withdrawal of Bids Before the Time Specified for Bid Opening A Bidder may
 withdraw a Bid after Delivery, provided the request for such withdrawal is made in writing or in
 person before the time set for Bid Opening in the Notice to Contractors. The Bidder may revise
 and resubmit a Bid so withdrawn before the time specified for Bid Opening.
 102.9 Bid Opening Bids will be opened and publicly read at the time and place specified in
 the Notice to Contractors or any applicable Bid Amendments. The Department will normally
 read publicly only the total Bid Price of each Bid. Unit and lump sum prices are available for
 inspection by the Bidders immediately after the Bid Opening process.
 The public reading of a Bid does not constitute a determination by the Department of
 whether the Bid is responsive or of whether the Bidder is responsible, though the Department
 may refuse to read Bids that are obviously non-responsive. Accordingly, the Department may
 reject a Bid as non-responsive and/or determine a Bidder is not responsible or ineligible to Bid
 even if that Bidder’s Bid is read at Bid Opening.
 102.10 Withdrawal of Bids in Multiple Bid Context Bids may not be withdrawn after the
 time of Bid Opening, except under the limited circumstance set forth in this Section 102.10.
 If a Bidder has submitted Bids on multiple Projects that have the same Bid Opening time,
 and if after the reading of Bids the Bidder has submitted the apparent low Bid on one Project,
 then the Bidder may withdraw any Bids on other Projects for which no Bids have yet been read.
 Such a request for withdrawal must be made in person or in writing. Bids withdrawn will not be
 considered. The Bidder assumes sole responsibility for the risk that the Bidder’s apparent low
 Bid is rejected as non-responsive or that the Bidder is determined to be not responsible.

 J. The Bidder fails to comply with any provision in the Bid Documents that expressly
 indicates that such non-compliance will cause Bid rejection.
 K. When A plus B bidding is specified, the bid does not contain the number of Calendar
 Days bid to complete the work
 L. The Bid is not submitted on the most current forms provided by the Department or
 identical copies thereof.
 The Bidder will have no opportunity to cure the above Non-curable Bid Defects.
 102.11.2 Curable Bid Defects Unless the Department waives a curable Bid defect, the
 Bidder must cure, within the time stated in the written notice by the Department, but not less
 than 24 hours, all other Bid Defects not listed in Section 102.11.1 - Non-curable Bid Defects
 that are identified by the Department. Failure to cure such Defects within said time may result
 in forfeiture of the Bidder’s Bid Guaranty. Upon such failure, the Department may take any
 
 1-26
 
 action in the best interests of the Department including those set forth in Section 103.6 - Failure
 to Fulfill Award Conditions.
 Such curable Bid Defects include, but are not limited to, the following.

 the Contract Completion Date as determined by the Department.
 Materially unbalanced Bids may create a significant question as to the Bidder’s ability or
 will to complete the Work within the Contract Time in accordance with the requirements of the
 Contract; see Section 103.1.2 - Unbalanced Bids.
 Contractors prequalified for the general category stated in the Notice to Contractors may be
 determined non-responsive by the Department based on recent or new data provided since the
 last determination of prequalification for that Contractor.
 SECTION 103 - AWARD AND CONTRACTING
 Scope of Section This Section includes requirements related to the final determination of
 Bid responsiveness and Award and execution of the Contract.
 103.1 Analysis of Bids
 103.1.1 Unit Prices Govern After Bid Opening, the Department will review the mathematics
 of all apparently responsive Bids. In the event of a discrepancy between (A) unit and lump
 prices and (B) extensions and/or the total Bid Price, the unit and lumps sum prices shall govern
 and the total Bid Price will be adjusted accordingly.
 103.1.2 Unbalanced Bids
 A. Definitions An Unbalanced Bid is a Bid that is Mathematically Unbalanced and that
 may also be Materially Unbalanced. Mathematically Unbalanced means a Bid containing
 lump sum or Unit Prices, which do not reflect reasonable direct costs plus a reasonable
 proportionate share of the Bidder’s anticipated profit, overhead costs, and other indirect
 
 1-27
 
 costs. Materially Unbalanced means a Mathematically Unbalanced Bid, which generates a
 reasonable doubt that said Bid, will represent the lowest ultimate cost to the Department.
 B. Comparison and Possible Bid Rejection The Department will compare the price of
 items contained in the Bid of the Apparent Successful Bidder with the estimate prepared by
 the Department. If the Bid is Mathematically Unbalanced, the Department may, in its
 discretion, notify the Apparent Successful Bidder and request an explanation. There shall be
 no negotiation or changes in prices. If the Bidder fails to provide a reasonable explanation,
 and if the Department finds the Bid is Materially Unbalanced, the Department may reject the
 Bid as non-responsive and may take any action that is in the best interests of the Department
 including those set forth in Section 103.6 - Failure to Fulfill Award Conditions.
 103.1.3 Waiver of Defects and Technicalities; Right to Reject Bids The Department
 reserves the right to reject any or all Bids and to advertise for new Bids if doing so is in the best
 interest of the Department. The Department reserves the right to waive curable defects and
 other technicalities without notice to any party. Refer to section 102.11.2 for Curable Bid
 Defects.
 103.2 Return of Bid Guaranty Bid Bonds will not be returned unless so requested. Bid
 Guaranties other than bonds will be returned within 7 Days following Bid Opening, except that
 the Bid Guaranties from two lowest responsive Bids from responsible Bidders will be retained
 until Contract Execution or rejection of all Bids.
 103.3 Post-Bid Qualification
 103.3.1 PreQualification Requirement for Award If the Notice to Contractors lists a
 PreQualification requirement, the Apparent Successful Bidder must successfully complete the
 prequalification process as a condition of Award.
 103.3.1.1 Notice and Information Gathering After Bid Opening and as a condition for
 Award of a Contract, the Department may require an Apparent Successful Bidder to demonstrate
 to the Department’s satisfaction that the Bidder is responsible and qualified to perform the
 Work.
 If such qualification is required, the Department will provide the Bidder with written notice
 to that effect. Such notice will include a brief description of the reasons why such qualifications
 is required, and may require the Bidder to provide any information requested in the
 “Contractor’s Prequalification Application” form adopted by the Department.
 If requested by the Bidder, the Department shall provide an opportunity for the Bidder to
 present evidence of qualifications at a reasonable time and place.
 103.3.2 Notice of Determination After the Bidder’s presentation of evidence of
 qualifications (if required), the Department will notify the Bidder of its determination in writing.
 If a determination of “Not Qualified” is rendered, the Department’s Chief Engineer will send the
 
 1-28
 
 notice, which will set forth the specific reasons therefore to the extent practical. Such reasons
 include the following.
 A. Default(s) or termination(s) on past or current Contracts.
 B. Failure to pay or settle all bills for labor, Materials or services on past or current
 Contracts.
 C. Failure to provide Closeout Documentation on past or current Contracts.
 D. Failure to fulfill warranty obligations on past or current Contracts.
 E. Failure to comply with directives of the Department on past or current Contracts.
 F. "Below Standard" performance as determined from the Department’s Contractor’s
 Performance Rating process.
 G. Inability of the Contractor to obtain or retain performance or Payment Bonds meeting
 MDOT requirements.
 H. Failure to accept an Award of a Contract made by the Department to the Contractor.
 I. Making materially false, deceptive, or misleading Statements or omissions, whether
 or not under oath, regarding a claim on prior Contracts or on the Contractor’s
 Prequalification Application.
 J. Failure to provide information requested by the Department pursuant to this Section
 103.3.
 K. Any of the reasons contained in Section 102.02 of the “Rules Regarding Debarment
 of Contractors”, Maine Department of Transportation Register 17-229, Chapter 102
 (October 2, 1985).
 L. Debarment or suspension by any federal, State, or local governmental procurement
 agency or the Contractor’s Agreement to refrain from Bidding as part of the
 settlement with any such agencies.
 M. Other serious misconduct that the Department reasonably determines will
 substantially and adversely affect the cost, quality or timeliness of Work, or the
 safety of Workers or the public.
 103.3.3 Appeal To appeal a “Not Qualified” determination, the Bidder must Deliver a
 written "Request for Appeal of Qualification Determination” to the Commissioner within 48
 hours of Receipt of such determination. The Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee will
 grant such Requests for Appeal unless the Department reasonably determines that Delay of
 Award pending appeal is likely to cause substantial harm to the interests of the Department. If
 
 1-29
 
 the Request for Appeal is denied, the determination of "Not Qualified" is upheld and the Award
 process will proceed without the unqualified Bidder.
 If the Request for Appeal is granted, the Bidder and the Chief Engineer must Deliver to the
 Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee any information or arguments that the parties
 want considered within 14 Days of Receipt of a “Not Qualified” determination.
 Within 14 Days of Receipt of such information and arguments, the Commissioner or the
 Commissioner’s designee will notify the Bidder in writing as to whether: (A) the determination
 of "Not Qualified" is upheld, modified or reversed; or (B) the Commissioner or the
 Commissioner’s designee elects to submit the issue to binding or non-binding alternative
 Dispute resolution.
 After a final determination of “Not Qualified”, the Bidder’s Bid Guaranty will be returned
 and the Bidder will be ineligible for Award of future Department Contracts until the Bidder is
 prequalified pursuant to the Department’s Prequalification Procedure.
 103.4 Notice of Intent to Award The Department has 30 Days following Bid Opening to
 Deliver a written Notice of Intent to Award and request a payment bond, performance bond,
 insurance bond, special certifications, and other information from the Apparent Low Bidder. If a
 notice of Intent to Award is not sent within 30 days of receipt of the Bid Opening, the Apparent
 Successful Bidder may withdraw its Bid without forfeiture of its Bid Guaranty or Bidding
 eligibility. If the Department and the Apparent Successful Bidder agree, an extension beyond the
 30 days of the Bid and Bid prices may occur and the Bid remains viable. For a related
 provision, see Section 103.5 Award Conditions.
 103.5 Award Conditions The Apparent Successful Bidder must provide and/or perform all
 of the items listed in this Section 103.5 within 14 Days of Receipt of the Notice of Intent to
 Award. Unless indicated otherwise, all items must be Delivered to the Department’s Contracts
 Engineer.

 liability company, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, or other entity which (A) is
 not licensed to do business within the State of Maine, or (B) does not have a principal place
 of business within the State of Maine.
 
 1-30
 
 B. Requirements If a Non-Resident Contractor, the Apparent Successful Bidder must
 file with the Department a copy of a written appointment of an attorney admitted to practice
 in the State of Maine having a place of business within the State. The appointment must:
 (A) set forth the attorney's business and personal addresses, and business telephone and fax
 numbers, (B) name said attorney to be the true and lawful attorney of the Non-Resident
 Contractor, (C) set forth that the Contractor agrees that any lawful process which is served
 on said attorney shall have the same legal force and validity as if served on the Contractor,
 (D) set forth that the appointment shall continue in force as long as any potential liability in
 any way related to the Work or the Contract remains or until the Department receives written
 notice of a change of appointment Conforming to this paragraph, (E) provide that service of
 such process may be made by leaving a copy of the process in the hands or in the office of
 the Resident attorney and that such service will be effective upon the Non-Resident
 Contractor, as if service were made in accordance with Rule 4 of the Maine Rule of Civil
 Procedure, and (F) provide that the Contractor expressly waives any and all defenses
 regarding service of process under Rule 12 of said Civil Rules or otherwise. The
 appointment shall be filed in the office of the Maine Secretary of State.
 103.5.4 Execution of Contract By Bidder The properly completed and signed Contract
 Agreement, Offer, & Award form provided with the Bid constitutes the Bidder’s offer. Once the
 Department has received the bonds, insurance, and any other pre-award items required, the

 The point of Contract execution is when the Contractor receives the written Notice of Award.
 103.5.5 Bid Escrow If required by Special Provision, the Apparent Successful Bidder must
 provide a legible copy of Bid Escrow Documentation and a related Affidavit Conforming to said
 Special Provision. Failure to provide Conforming Bid Escrow Documentation or the Affidavit
 constitutes a refusal to enter into the Contract and will result in the Bidder’s forfeiture of its Bid
 Guaranty.
 103.5.6 Other Conditions The Apparent Successful Bidder must comply with all other
 conditions set forth or referenced in the Notice of Intent to Award.
 103.6 Failure to Fulfill Award Conditions Failure of the Apparent Successful Bidder to
 fulfill all conditions of Award within the time provided or to otherwise accept Award will result
 in forfeiture of the Award to the Apparent Successful Bidder and the forfeiture of the Bid
 Guaranty. Such Bidder will be prohibited from submitting a Bid for the Work in the event that
 the Work is re-advertised. Further, the Department may refuse to accept any Bid from the
 Bidder on any Project for a period of two years from the date of such refusal.
 The Department may then take any action that the Department determines is in the best
 interest of the Department including Awarding the Contract to the responsible Bidder with the
 next lowest responsive Bid, rejecting all Bids, and/or re-advertising the Work.
 103.7 Forfeiture of Award The Department reserves the right to stop the Award of any
 Contract at any time before the Contract Execution without liability if doing so is in the best
 
 1-31
 
 interest of the Department. Any costs incurred by the Bidder before Contract Execution shall be
 the sole responsibility of the Bidder.
 103.8 Award of Contract by Department Once the Contractor has met the requirements of
 the Notice of Intent to Award letter, the Department has 14 days to execute the Contract and
 notify the Contractor of the award with a written Notice of Award. If a Notice of Award is not
 sent within 14 days, the Apparent Successful Bidder may withdraw its Bid without forfeiture of

 the next Business Day.
 The Department and Apparent Successful Bidder may extend the time for the Award
 process, fulfillment of Award Conditions, or execution of the Contract by mutual Agreement.
 Unless specifically and mutually agreed to in writing, such extensions shall not extend the
 Contract Time or the Contract Completion Date.

 104.4.6 Utility Coordination
 A. Pre-construction Utility Conference A pre-construction utility meeting will be held to
 coordinate the Work of the Contractor and the Work of affected Utility Companies. Usually
 this meeting will be held on the same day as and immediately before the pre-construction
 conference provided by Section 104.4.2 - Pre-construction Conference but, in any event, will
 be held before the start of on-site construction by the Contractor that affects Utility
 Facilities. The Department’s utility coordinator for the Project, the Project Manager, the
 Resident, the Contractor's Superintendent, and a representative of each affected Utility
 
 1-41
 
 Company will attend. The Department’s Utility Coordinator will prepare minutes of the preconstruction utility meeting and distribute them to all attendees. Any requests to revise the
 minutes must be made to the Department’s Utility Coordinator within 7 Days of distribution.
 These minutes will constitute the final record of the meeting. For a related provision, see
 Section 104.4.2 - Pre-construction Conference(s).
 B. Utilities Within Right-of-Way Except as provided otherwise in the Contract
 including subsection E - Temporary Relocations below, all Utility Facilities of all Utility
 Companies within the Right-of-Way will be relocated and adjusted as provided in the
 Contract by and at the expense of the affected Utility Company, provided, however, that the
 Contractor is responsible for scheduling its Work in accordance with the time allowed for
 utility relocation as provided in the Contract. Utility relocation Work may not proceed
 without authorization from the Department.
 C. Contractor’s Responsibilities
 1) Utility Coordination - The Contractor has primary responsibility for coordinating
 their work with utilities after contract award. The Contractor shall communicate directly

 and prevent project construction delays. The Contractor shall notify the Resident of any
 issues. The contractor shall plan and conduct their work accordingly.
 2) The Contractor must exercise every reasonable precaution to prevent damage to
 Utility Facilities or interruption to utility services known to or discovered by the
 Contractor, whether or not shown on the Plans. Such precautions must include notice to
 Utility Companies before undertaking Work that could damage Utility Facilities. The
 Contractor must provide each Utility Company with notice at least three Business Days
 before the date a Utility Company will have to support any pole.
 The Contractor must take all reasonable precautions to determine the presence of
 underground Utility Facilities before commencing any excavation Work and must
 provide all affected Utility Companies with at least 72-hour prior notice of the proposed
 excavation. The Contractor must comply with 23 MRSA § 3360-A, entitled "Protection
 of Underground Facilities," Maine’s “Dig Safe” statute and also contact the non-member
 underground facility operators in the Maine Public Utilities Commission’s “OK-TODIG” directory.

 4) The Contractor must maintain initial markings (spray paint, stakes, etc.) made by
 the authorized representative of a Utility Company to indicate the location of
 underground Utility Facilities and otherwise comply with 23 MRSA § 3360-A(4).
 5) The Contractor must cooperate with Utility Companies in their relocation or
 operations so that these operations proceed in a logical sequence, minimize duplication
 of Work, and avoid unnecessary interruptions to utility service.
 
 1-42
 
 6) If utility services are interrupted as a result of the Contractor’s Work, the
 Contractor must Promptly notify the appropriate Utility Company and must cooperate
 fully in the restoration of service. If service is interrupted, repair Work will be
 continuous until the service is restored. No Work can be undertaken around fire
 hydrants until the local fire authority has approved provisions for continued services.
 7) The Contractor must schedule its Work so as to provide for all Utility Company
 Work and to complete the Work within the Contract Time. The estimated number of
 workdays required by each Utility Company to perform its relocation Work contained in
 the Contract is provided by the Utility Companies and are estimates only. Such Utility
 Facility relocation times assume normal Working times (Monday through Friday, 8 hours
 per day), and are dependent upon normal weather, normal Working conditions, and
 freedom from emergencies. The Department is not responsible for the accuracy of these
 estimates. If a Utility Company fails to perform its Work within the time frames set
 forth in the Contract or in the minutes of the pre-construction utility conference, and
 such failure impacts the Contractor’s Critical Path, the Contractor may request a
 suspension of Work pursuant to Section 107.5.2 and such Delay will be analyzed in
 accordance with Section 109.5 - Adjustments for Delay.
 8) Any clearing and tree removal that is a part of the Contract and that must be done
 in areas where Utility Companies are involved must be completed by the Contractor
 before the Utility Company can relocate its Utility Facilities. Any clearing, cutting of
 single trees, or limbing required for the temporary or permanent Utility Facility location
 must be approved by the Department. The Contractor must provide the Department with
 notice of at least 4 Days before removing or trimming any trees or other vegetation.
 9) If blasting occurs on the Project, the Contractor must provide each Utility
 Company having Utility Facilities that could be damaged by the blast with at least 24hour prior notice that includes the anticipated time of the initial blast.
 10) If the Contractor actually observes a Utility Company Working within the
 Project Limits in a manner that (a) obviously violates the MUTCD, the Contractor’s
 Traffic Control Plan, or an applicable OSHA requirement or commonly accepted safety
 practices, and (b) represents a clear and immediate risk of significant bodily injury to any
 person within the Project Limits, then the Contractor must notify the Resident and the
 Utility Company immediately.
 11) The Contractor agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Department
 from and against any and all claims or causes of action arising from any act or omission
 of the Contractor, the Subcontractors or their respective agents, representatives, or
 employees for failure to comply with this Section 104.4.6.
 D. Temporary Relocations The Contractor may request temporary changes of location of
 Utility Facilities for the Contractor's convenience. The Contractor must satisfy the
 Department that the proposed temporary change will not interfere with the Work, the Work
 of Utility Companies, or the Work of other Contractors and will not impede the free and safe
 
 1-43
 
 flow of traffic. If acceptable to the Department, the Contractor may make its own request to
 the Utility Company or other party affected by such temporary changes. The expense and
 risk of temporary changes will be borne solely by the Contractor; no changes to
 compensation or time will be made.
 E. Unforeseeable Utility Relocations The Department may order utility adjustments in
 accordance with Section 109.4 - Differing Site Conditions.
 F. Cost The cost of all Work related to utility coordination is Incidental to the Contract.

 all risks and liability associated with such other Work and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
 Department from all claims related to such other Work that arise from the Contractor's acts or
 omissions.
 104.4.8 Coordination with Railroads The Contractor shall (A) perform Work within a
 railroad Right-of-Way without interfering with trains or railroad company traffic and (B)
 coordinate all Work crews and the Contractor’s Schedule of Work to accommodate the railroad
 company Work. If the Bid Documents clearly show that Materials must be hauled across
 railroad tracks, the Department will make preliminary arrangements with the railroad to permit
 such hauling. The Contractor shall, at its expense, negotiate and enter into any other
 Agreements with the railroad.
 Special Provision will provide any additional conditions or requirements regarding railroad
 coordination.
 104.4.9 Coordination with Marine Traffic The Contractor shall not interfere with free and
 safe navigation of navigable waters except as provided by permit issued by the US Coast Guard
 and other applicable regulatory agencies. All Work must comply with all US Coast Guard
 permit conditions and all applicable Federal regulations affecting navigation.

 wetlands specialist in order to determine whether wetlands exist, and if so, to delineate them.
 The Contractor must notify the Department of all such examinations and analyses and the
 results thereof. Wetlands so delineated must not be impacted unless properly permitted.
 Any fill Material generated from this Project shall not be placed, stored, or disposed of in
 a wetland at an off-site location unless the Contractor provides the Department with written
 evidence that all Permits necessary for such use have been obtained. Such evidence must be
 signed by the Owner of such site and otherwise acceptable to the Department.
 C. Temporary Structures Temporary or permanent impacts to wetlands are prohibited
 without proper permitting or modification to existing Permits. Temporary Structures in a
 waterbody must comply with any Contract provisions regarding Instream Work.
 105.8.4 Hazardous Materials If the Contractor encounters any condition that indicates the
 presence of uncontrolled petroleum or hazardous Materials, the Contractor shall immediately
 stop Work, notify the Department, treat any such conditions with extreme caution, and secure
 the area of potential hazard to minimize health risks to Workers and the public, and to prevent
 additional releases of contaminants into the environment. Such conditions include the presence
 of barrels, tanks, unexpected odors, discoloration of soil or water, an oily sheen on soil or water,
 
 1-60
 
 excessively hot earth, smoke, or any other condition indicating uncontrolled petroleum or
 hazardous Materials. The Contractor shall continue Work in other areas of the Project unless
 otherwise directed by the Department. The Contractor shall utilize approved vendors and
 comply with all federal, State, and local laws concerning the handling, storage, treatment, and
 disposal of uncontrolled petroleum or hazardous Material. If the condition meets the definition
 of a Differing Site Condition under Section 109.4.1, the Contractor may be eligible for an
 Equitable Adjustment.
 105.8.5 Dredge Spoils (Dredge Materials) Unless otherwise provided in the Contract,
 dredge spoils may not be used as fill within the Project Limits. Any use or disposal of dredge
 spoils must be in accordance with all applicable federal and State laws.
 105.8.6 Pit or Quarry Requirements
 A. General Pits or quarries that are sources of Material for the Project, including
 loam fields, shall meet the requirements of this Section 105.8.6. The Contractor
 must procure an Agreement from the Owners of such sources stating that the
 Owners will comply with these requirements. If requested by the Department, the
 Contractor will provide the Department with a copy of such Agreement. The
 Contractor shall provide the Resident with the center of the source GPS
 coordinate pairs (latitude and longitude) in decimal degrees (DD.DDDDDD),
 name, and town in which the source is located.
 B.
 
 Excavation Requirements Surface Material stripped from the pit shall be stored
 to allow for restoration of the pit. The Contractor shall not excavate from pit
 faces that are vertical or have an overhang. The Contractor must stop excavating
 within a 2 horizontal to 1 vertical slope 10 feet inside of a property line of a
 deposit, even though the Material within the pit may have a steeper angle of
 repose. The exception may be when an additional Agreement is reached with an
 adjacent property Owner to allow the extension of a pit onto the adjacent property
 Owner’s land. The Contractor must insure that hazards such as steep pit faces and
 ponds are protected by flattening slopes or by erecting suitable fencing.
 
 C. Rehabilitation If the pit is licensed by MDEP or LURC, the Contractor shall
 follow the rehabilitation provisions of said license. In the absence of such
 license requirements, pits, including loam fields, shall be rehabilitated as
 provided below and in Section 657 - Rehabilitation of Pits.
 1) Newly opened pits and loam fields from which any Material has been
 removed for the Project shall be completely rehabilitated, as defined
 below.
 2) Areas of extensions of existing pits from which common borrow, granular
 borrow, gravel borrow, rock borrow, or loam have been removed for the
 Project shall be completely rehabilitated.
 
 1-61
 
 3) Areas of extensions of existing pits that have become depleted, as defined
 below, by the removal of other gravel, sand, Aggregate items, or loam for
 the Project shall be completely rehabilitated.
 4) Areas of extensions of pits which have not become depleted by the
 removal of other gravel, sand, Aggregate items, or loam shall be
 rehabilitated to the extent of grading the slopes to 1 horizontal to 1
 vertical or flatter.
 For the purposes of this Section 105.8.6, the following definitions apply:
 "Completely Rehabilitated" means grading all areas disturbed as a result of the MDOT
 Project and treating of the ground surface in accordance with Section 657 - Rehabilitation of
 Pits.
 "Depleted" means when the only remaining Material is within 10 feet of a property line on
 a 1 horizontal to a 1 vertical slope or when the character of the Material so radically changes
 that it can no longer be used as originally anticipated.
 105.8.7 Environmental Non-compliance - Remedies and Costs The Contractor shall be in
 non-compliance if it, or Subcontractors at any tier, fail to comply with the terms of this Contract
 or, pursuant to Section 104.3.7 - Laws To Be Observed, any applicable environmental or land
 use law or regulation including Project specific permit conditions.
 If the Contractor is in non-compliance, the Department may, at its discretion:
 A. Withhold all Progress Payments, or any portion thereof, during the period the
 Contractor is in non-compliance;
 B. Remedy such non-compliance using State forces or another Contractor and
 deduct all costs incurred by the Department from Progress Payments. Such costs
 include direct costs, Project Engineering costs, and Contractor costs from amounts
 otherwise due the Contractor, and/or
 C. Suspend the Work for cause and without cost or liability to the Department.
 Said suspension shall continue until the Contractor has addressed all non-compliance
 issues as directed by the Department.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for any fines and penalties assessed by environmental or
 land use regulatory agencies due to such non-compliance. Such penalties may be withheld from
 amounts otherwise due the Contractor. For related provisions, see Sections 108.5 - Right to
 Withhold Payments and 108.9.3 - Amounts Due the Department.
 105.9 Historic and Archaeological Considerations Unless otherwise provided in the
 contract, the Contractor is approved to construct the project in accordance with the contract
 plans. This in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C.
 
 1-62
 
 470 f), the Regulation (36 CFR Part 800), and the 2004 Section 106 Maine Programmatic
 Agreement.
 Changes during construction that vary from the project contract plans must be approved by the
 Department. These changes could have adverse effects to Historic Resources, as well as
 jeopardize federal funding.
 If the Contractor or any subcontractor discovers any object of potential historic archaeological or
 other historic interest, all work that could disturb the object will immediately cease and will not
 resume until investigation of the object and related deposits have been completed, and if
 necessary recovered. The Contractor will notify the MaineDOT immediately. (The first
 indications of deposits may be burial grounds or campsites of Native Americans that reveal the
 bones of the dead and implements. Also the exposure of marine fossils or shells found mainly
 in clay deposits, as well as, exposure of dumps in landfill areas, abandoned campfire sites, and
 building foundations.)
 Any delay of the Contractor’s operations resulting from the above will be analyzed in
 accordance with MaineDOT Standard Specification Section 109.5 – Adjustment for Delay,
 except that in no event will such delay be a compensable delay.
 The Contractor is notified of a Maine Statute, 27 MRSA §371, which states that artifacts,
 specimens, and material, which are public property by virtue of having been found on, in, or
 beneath State controlled lands, and places ownership of the same in the State of Maine.
 105.10 Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights
 105.10.1.1 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Program The Maine Department of
 Transportation (MaineDOT) has established a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE)
 program in accordance with regulations of the United States Department of Transportation
 (USDOT), 49 CFR Part 26. The MaineDOT receives federal financial assistance from USDOT,
 and as a condition of receiving this assistance, the Department has signed an assurance that it
 will comply with 49 CFR Part 26.The MaineDOT is responsible for determining the eligibility
 of and certifying DBE firms in Maine.
 A DBE is defined as a for-profit business that is owned and controlled by one or more socially
 and economically disadvantaged person(s). For the purpose of this definition:
 1. “Socially and economically disadvantaged person” means an individual who is a citizen
 or lawful permanent resident of the United States and who is Black, Hispanic, Native
 American, Asian, Female; or a member of another group or an individual found to be
 disadvantaged by the Small Business Administration pursuant to Section 3 of the Small
 Business Act.
 2. “Owned and controlled” means a business which is:
 a. A sole proprietorship legitimately owned and controlled by an individual who is a
 disadvantaged person.
 
 1-63
 
 b. A partnership or limited liability company in which at least 51% of the beneficial
 ownership interests legitimately are held by a disadvantaged person(s).
 c. A corporation or other entity in which at least 51% of the voting interest and 51%
 of the beneficial ownership interests legitimately are held by a disadvantaged
 person(s).
 The disadvantaged group owner(s) or stockholder(s) must possess control over management,
 interest in capital, and interest in earnings commensurate with the percentage of ownership. If
 the disadvantaged group ownership interests are real, substantial and continuing and not created
 solely to meet the requirements of this program, a firm is considered a bona fide DBE.
 105.10.1.2 Commercially Useful Function MaineDOT will count expenditures of a DBE
 contractor toward DBE goals only if the DBE is performing a commercially useful function on
 that contract. A DBE performs a commercially useful function when it is responsible for
 execution of the work of the contract and is carrying out its responsibilities by actually
 performing, managing, and supervising the work involved. Credit will only be given when the
 DBE meets all conditions for a CUF. Credit for labor will be in accordance with the
 responsibilities outlined in the contract. To perform a commercially useful function, the DBE
 must also be responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the Contract, for
 negotiating price, determining quality and quantity, ordering the materials, and installing (where
 applicable) and paying for the material itself. To determine whether a DBE is performing a
 commercially useful function, MaineDOT will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted,
 industry practices, whether the amount the firm is to be paid under the Contract is commensurate
 with the work it is actually performing and DBE credit claimed for its performance of the work,
 and other relevant factors.
 Rented equipment used by the DBE must not be rented from the Prime Contractor on a job that
 the DBE is subcontracted with that Prime Contractor for regular course of business.
 A current listing of certified DBEs that may wish to participate in the highway construction
 program and the scope of work for which they are certified can be found at
 http://www.maine.gov/mdot/civilrights/dbe.htm. Credit will be given for the value described by
 a DBE performing as:
 A. A prime contractor; 100% of actual value of work performed by own workforces.
 B. An approved subcontractor; 100% of work performed by own workforces.
 C. An owner-operator of construction equipment; 100% of expenditures committed.
 D. A manufacturer; 100% of expenditures committed. The manufacturer must be a firm that
 operates or maintains a factory or establishment that produces on the premises the
 materials or supplies obtained by the Contractor. Brokers and packagers shall not be
 regarded as manufacturers.
 E. A regular dealer; 60% of expenditures committed. A regular dealer is defined as a firm
 that owns, operates, or maintains a store, warehouse or other establishment in which the
 materials or supplies required for the performance of the contract are bought, kept in
 stock, and regularly sold to the public. For purposes of this provision a “Broker” is a
 DBE that has entered into a legally binding relationship to provide goods or services
 
 1-64
 
 delivered or performed by a third party. Brokers and packagers shall not be regarded as
 regular dealers.
 F. A bona fide service provider; 100% of reasonable fees or commissions. Eligible services
 include professional, technical, consultant, or managerial, services and assistance in the
 procurement of essential personnel, facilities, equipment, materials or supplies required
 for the performance of the contract. Eligible services also include agencies providing
 bonding and insurance specifically required for the performance of the contract.
 G. A trucking, hauling or delivery operation. 100% of expenditures committed when trucks
 are owned, operated, licensed and insured by the DBE and used on the contract and, if
 applicable, includes the cost of the self-supplied materials and supplies.100% of
 expenditures committed when the DBE leases trucks from another DBE firm including
 an owner-operator. 100% of reasonable fees or commissions the DBE receives as a result
 of a lease arrangement for trucks from a non-DBE, including an owner-operator.
 H. Any combination of the above.
 105.10.1.3 Race-neutral Goals The Maine DOT is required to set an annual goal (approved on a
 three year basis) for DBE participation in Federal-aid projects. In order to fulfill that goal,
 bidders are encouraged to utilize DBE businesses certified by the MaineDOT. MaineDOT seeks
 to meet the established DBE goal solely through race-neutral means. Race-neutral DBE
 participation occurs when a DBE is awarded a prime contract through customary competitive
 procurement procedures, is awarded a subcontract on a contract that does not carry a DBE
 contract goal, or wins a subcontract from a prime contractor that did not consider its DBE status
 in making the award. A DBE/subcontractor Utilization Proposed Form is required to be
 included in bid documents.
 MaineDOT will analyze each project and create a Project Availability Target (PAT), based on a
 number of factors including project scope, available DBE firms, firms certified in particular
 project work, etc. Each bid will request that the contractor attempt to meet the PAT. This PAT
 is developed to assist contractors to better understand what the MaineDOT expectations are for a
 specific project. The PAT is NOT a mandate but an assessment of what this particular project
 can bear for DBE participation. The Department anticipates that each contractor will make the
 best effort to reach or exceed this PAT for the project.
 105.10.1.4 Race-conscious Project Goals If it is determined by the Department that the
 annual DBE goal will not be met through race-neutral means, the Department may implement
 race-conscious contract goals on some projects. Race-conscious contract goals are goals that
 are enforceable by the Department and require that the prime contractor use good faith effort to
 achieve the goal set by the Department for that particular project. If race conscious means are
 implemented on a project, the Prime must comply with the requirements of 49 CFR.
 At the time of the bid opening, all Bidders shall submit with their bid a Disadvantaged Business
 Enterprise (DBE) Commitment Form provided by the Department. This form will list the DBE
 and non-DBE firms that are proposed to be used during the execution of the Work. The list shall
 show the name of the firm, the item/material/type of work involved and the dollar amount of
 
 1-65
 
 work to be performed. The dollar total of each commitment shall be totaled and a percentage
 determined.
 If the project goal is not met, acceptable documentation showing all good faith efforts made to
 obtain participation may be required in order to award the project. Failure to provide the
 required listing with the dollar participation total or acceptable documentation of good faith
 efforts to obtain DBE participation within 3 days after the bid opening date will be considered a
 lack of responsiveness on the part of the low bidder. Rejection of the low bid under these
 circumstances will require the low bidder to surrender the Proposal Guaranty to the Department.
 The submission and approval of the above forms does not constitute a formal subcontract.
 If for any reason during the progress of the Work the Contractor finds that DBEs included on the
 list are unable to perform the proposed work, the Contractor, with written release by the
 committed DBE or approval of the Department, may substitute other DBE firms for those
 named on the list. If the Contractor is able to clearly document their inability to find qualified
 substitute firms to meet the project goal, the Contractor may request in writing approval to
 substitute the DBE with a non-DBE firm. If at any time during the life of the Contract it is
 determined that the Contractor is not fulfilling the goal or commitment(s) and is not making a
 good faith effort to fulfill the DBE requirement, the Department may withhold progress
 payments. If good faith effort is determined by the Department, failure to meet the DBE
 contract goal will not be a detriment to the bid award. Fulfillment of the goal percentage shall be
 determined by dividing the dollars committed to the DBEs by the actual contract dollars. These
 requirements are in addition to all other Equal Employment Opportunity requirements on
 Federal-aid contracts.
 105.10.1.5 Certification of DBE attainment on Contracts The MaineDOT must certify that it
 has conducted post-award monitoring of all contracts to ensure that DBEs had done the work for
 which credit was claimed. The certification is for the purpose of ensuring accountability for
 monitoring which the regulation already requires. The MaineDOT will certify these contracts
 through review of CUF forms, Elations sub-contract payment tracking as well as occasional onsite reviews of projects and through the project’s final closeout documentation provided by our
 Contracts Section.
 105.10.1.6 Bidders’ List Survey Pursuant to 49 CFR 26.11 the MaineDOT is required to
 “create and maintain” a bidders list and gather bidder information on our construction/consultant
 projects, Contractors will maintain information on all subcontract bids submitted by DBE and
 Non-DBE firms and provide that information to the Department. The Following information is
 required:
 Firm Name
 Firm Address
 Firm status (DBE or non-DBE)
 Age of firm (years)
 And the annual gross receipts amount as indicated by defined brackets, i.e. $500,000 to
 $800,000, rather than requesting exact figures.
 
 1-66
 
 Not only is this information critical in determining the availability of DBE businesses relative to
 other businesses that do similar work, but the Federal Highway Administration requires that we
 obtain this information.
 105.10.2 Requirements Applicable to All Contracts Unless expressly provided otherwise in
 the Bid Documents, the provisions contained in this Section 105.10.1 apply to this Contract.
 A. Maine Code of Fair Practices and Affirmative Action The Contractor must comply
 with the provisions of Maine's Code of Fair Practices and Affirmative Action, 5 MRSA
 §781, et seq., and all regulations promulgated thereunder. This Code, at 5 MRSA§784(2),
 reads as follows.

 1) The Contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for
 employment because of race, color, religious creed, sex, national origin, ancestry, age,
 sexual orientation, physical and/or mental disability . Such action shall include, but not
 be limited to, the following: Employment, upgrading, demotions, transfers, recruitment
 or recruitment advertising; layoffs or terminations; rates of pay or other forms of
 compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship.
 2) The Contractor will, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by

 understanding, whereby he is furnished with labor for the performances of [sic] his
 Contract, a notice, to be provided by the Contracting Department or agency, advising the
 said labor union or Workers’ representative of the Contractor’s commitment under this
 Section and shall post copies of the notice in conspicuous places available to employees
 and to applicants for employment.
 4) The Contractor will cause the foregoing provisions to be inserted in all Contracts
 for any Work covered by this Agreement so that such provisions will be binding upon
 each Subcontractor.
 5) Contractors and subcontractors with contracts in excess of $50,000 will also
 pursue in good faith affirmative action programs.
 B. Maine Human Rights Act The Contractor must comply with the provisions of
 Maine's Human Rights Act, 5 MRSA §4551, et seq., and all regulations promulgated
 thereunder. This Act provides, among other things, that it is unlawful discrimination for any
 employer to fail or refuse to hire or otherwise discriminate against any applicant for
 
 1-67
 
 employment because of race or color, sex, physical or mental disability, religion, age,
 ancestry or national origin, or sexual orientation except when based on a bona fide
 occupational qualification.
 C. EEO Notice to Labor Sources Contractors and Subcontractors that are required by
 Maine's Code of Fair Practices and Affirmative Action or by federal law to notify a labor
 union or a representative of workers with which the Contractor or the Subcontractor has a

 D. Prevention of Sexual Harassment It is the policy of the Department that all parties
 have a right to Work in an environment free from harassment, including sexual harassment.
 Maine State Law and the Department prohibit any and all forms of sexual harassment in the
 Workplace, on the job site or that which may have an effect on the Work environment.
 THEREFORE:
 The Contractor hereby agrees to the following requirements in order to provide and promote
 a non-discriminatory Workplace free of sexual harassment.
 1. No Contractor, supervisor, or employee shall allow repeated, objectionable, or
 unwanted verbal or physical advances, sexually explicit derogatory Statements, or sexually
 discriminatory remarks which cause discomfort, humiliation, or are in any way offensive to
 the recipient, or which interfere with the quality of any employee’s Work environment in any
 way. Furthermore, no one on any job shall threaten or insinuate either explicitly or
 implicitly that any employee’s submission to or rejection of sexual advances will have any
 effect on that person’s employment, job assignment, training, evaluation, promotion, wages,
 or any other term or condition of employment or future job opportunity. Contractors, under
 Maine State Law, are responsible for ensuring and maintaining a Work environment, which
 is free from sexual harassment.
 2. Any Contractor whose employee sexually harasses another employee shall be subject
 to disciplinary action. Contractors who fail to adequately and expeditiously investigate
 sexual harassment claims will be subject to enforcement proceedings and such sanctions as
 are authorized by law. Contractors are required to provide detailed written reports to the
 Department when so requested which shall describe the investigation and corrective actions
 taken by Contractors in all instances of sexual harassment allegations.
 Contractors shall also be responsible for ensuring that no retaliation, reprisal, or
 intimidation be directed against any complainant or other employee who provides
 information to any person or agency investigating an allegation or complaint of sexual
 harassment.
 E. Certification of Continuing EEO Efforts The Contractor must certify, to the best of its
 knowledge and belief, that the Contractor has made and will continue to make a good faith
 effort to comply with all applicable State requirements on equal employment opportunity,
 non-discrimination, and affirmative action including employment of women minorities and
 disadvantaged as journeyed trade workers. Contractors not having achieved company-wide
 trade employment goals of 6.9% for females and 0.5% for minorities will, where indicated
 by Contract and to the maximum extent practical, comply with Section 660 - On-the-Job
 Training.
 
 1-71
 
 105.11 Other Federal Requirements
 Prior to payment by the Department, the Contractor shall provide a certification from the
 producer of steel or iron, or any product containing steel or iron as a component, stating that all
 steel or iron furnished or incorporated into the furnished product was manufactured in the
 United States in accordance with the requirements of the Buy America provisions of 23 CFR
 635.410, as amended. Such certification shall also include (1) a statement that the iron or steel
 product or component was produced entirely within the United States, or (2) a statement that the
 iron or steel product or component was produced within the United States except for minimal
 quantities of foreign steel and iron valued at $ (actual value).
 All manufacturing processes must take place domestically. Manufacturing begins with the initial
 melting and mixing, and continues through the coating stage. Any process which modifies the
 chemical content, the physical size and shape, or the final finish is considered a manufacturing
 process. These processes include rolling, extruding, machining, bending, grinding, drilling, and
 coating. “Coating” includes epoxy coating, galvanizing, painting, or any other coating that
 protects or enhances the value of the material.
 A Buy America Certification is required from each manufacturer, fabricator, supplier,
 subcontractor, etc. that meets the “manufacturing” definition above.
 Buy America does not apply to raw materials (iron ore and alloys), scrap, pig iron, or processed,
 pelletized, and reduced iron ore.
 SECTION 106 - QUALITY
 Scope of Section This section contains general provisions related to the Quality of Work
 including roles, standards, Materials, Quality Control, Acceptance, Non-conforming Work, and

 Title to all hot mix asphalt to be furnished by the Contractor shall pass to the State of Maine,
 Department of Transportation, immediately before installation. The preceding sentence shall not
 in any way affect any right or remedy the Department has relating to the quality of the material,
 installation, or workmanship.
 106.3.2 Quality Requirements Materials shall meet the requirements of the contract at the
 time they are incorporated into the work. The Contractor shall sample and test proposed sources
 of materials, using accepted procedures and equipment no more than 60 days prior to use.
 Materials shall not be used in the work until passing results are obtained and provided to the
 
 1-73
 
 Department. The Contractor shall provide the Resident with a copy of the passing test results
 including the source of the material as identified in Section 105.8.6.
 The Contractor shall perform QC inspection, sampling, testing, and documentation in
 accordance with the contract requirements. For work without specific QC requirements, the
 Contractor shall perform inspection, sampling, and testing, as the Contractor deems necessary
 to ensure adequate process control and end product quality.
 The Contractor shall provide all facilities, equipment, and material samples required by the
 Department to conduct Acceptance, Verification and IA sampling and testing.
 The Contractor shall supply materials and perform work using methods and equipment in a
 manner, which will not degrade the quality of the materials. Materials with prior approval that
 become unfit for use or fall outside the specification limits will result in the affected product
 being declared non-conforming work. For a related provision, see Section 106.8 - Nonconforming Work.
 The cost of the Contractor’s QC activities and for furnishing facilities, testing equipment,
 and samples for the Department’s Acceptance and IA activities is incidental to the related Pay
 Items.
 106.3.3 Sources
 A. General The Contractor shall furnish all materials and products required to complete
 the work, except as otherwise provided in the Contract. Unless otherwise specified in the
 Contract, the Contractor shall use only those products contained on the Department’s
 Qualified Products List (available on the MaineDOT internet site) if a list is established for
 that type of product or material. For any material on the MaineDOT qualified products list
 that is being considered for incorporation into the Work, it shall be the Contractor’s
 responsibility to verify that the material is appropriate for the use being considered.
 B. Department Furnished Materials The Contract may specify that the Department will
 furnish certain materials. If the Contractor reasonably believes that the Departmentfurnished material is deficient in any way, the Contractor shall immediately notify the
 Department before accepting delivery. After acceptance of delivery, the Contractor is
 responsible for all risk or loss of Department-furnished material. The cost of inspecting,
 handling, and storing Department-furnished materials after delivery is incidental to the
 Contract. The Department may deduct from amounts otherwise due the Contractor all costs
 necessary to make good any shortage, damage, or deficiencies discovered after the
 Contractor accepts delivery including any demurrage or car hire charges.
 106.3.4 Storage The Contractor shall store materials to preserve their quality and fitness
 for the work. If materials fail to meet the requirements of the Contract, the materials will be
 rejected. The Department may inspect stored materials at any time. The Contractor shall
 
 1-74
 
 locate stored materials to facilitate their prompt inspection. The Department may approve
 portions of land within the Right-of-Way for storage purposes and for the placing of the
 Contractor’s equipment, but the Contractor shall provide any additional land required without
 cost to the Department. The Contractor shall not use private property for storage purposes
 without written permission of the owner, with copies of the written permission furnished to the
 Department upon request. The Contractor shall restore all storage sites, whether within the
 Right-of-Way or on private property, to original condition at the completion of the project,
 without cost to the Department.
 106.3.5 Handling The Contractor shall handle all materials in a manner that preserves their
 quality and fitness for the work. The Contractor shall transport aggregates in tight vehicles to
 avoid loss or segregation of materials after loading and measuring.
 106.3.6 Unacceptable Materials The Department may reject materials not conforming to
 the Specifications at any time, and the Contractor shall remove them immediately from the
 project site unless otherwise instructed by the Department. The Contractor shall not store or
 use rejected materials on any Department project.
 106.3.7 Sampling and Testing Qualified Departmental personnel may take samples for
 Acceptance Testing. Work in which material is used without the Department’s approval will
 be at the Contractor’s sole risk and the work will be considered non-conforming work. Unless
 otherwise designated, the Department’s testing costs will be at the expense of the Department.
 Materials being used are subject to inspection, testing, or rejection at any time. The
 Department will furnish copies of test reports to the Contractor upon request.
 The Contractor is responsible for the quality of construction and materials incorporated
 into the work. The Contractor shall perform all necessary QC inspection, sampling, and testing
 in accordance with the approved QCP. If a QCP is not required, the Contractor is still
 responsible for all QC necessary for a high quality project. The Contractor shall not rely on the
 results of the Department’s Acceptance Testing being available for process QC.
 The Contractor may observe the Department’s sampling and testing activities. If the
 Contractor observes a deviation from the specified sampling or testing procedures, then the
 Contractor shall describe the deviation to the Department immediately and document the
 deviation in writing within 24 hours to preserve their ability to dispute the sample.
 The Department will randomly sample and test items designated for Acceptance in
 accordance with the procedure specified for that item. The Department may also sample and
 test at any time if the material appears defective or when the Department determines that a
 change in the process or product has occurred. Acceptance Tests will govern in all cases for
 determination of pay factors without regard to QC tests, unless otherwise specified in the
 Contract.
 When directed by the Department, the Contractor shall sample and test any material, which
 appears inconsistent with similar material being sampled, unless such material is voluntarily
 
 1-75
 
 removed and replaced or corrected by the Contractor. All sampling shall be in accordance with
 Department, AASHTO, or ASTM procedures as specified for the material being sampled.
 106.4 Quality Control
 106.4.1 General When required by Special Provision, the Contractor shall develop, submit,
 and implement a Quality Control Plan (QCP), approved by the Department, for those items of
 work specified that will result in work that meets or exceeds the quality requirements of this
 Contract. Regardless of whether a QCP is required, Quality Control for all work is the
 Contractor’s responsibility.
 A. Submittal Within 21 Days of Contract Execution or at least 30 days before any
 related work is to be performed, the Contractor shall submit three copies of its QCP to the
 Department.
 B. Approval Within 14 Days of Receipt, the Department will determine if the QCP is in
 accordance with the requirements of this Section 106.4 and (1) notify the Contractor that its
 QCP is approved or (2) return it for any needed revisions. If returned for revision, the
 Contractor shall resubmit three copies of its revised QCP as provided above within 7 days
 and the Department will have 7 days from receipt of the revised plan to notify the Contractor
 whether its QCP is approved or again requires revision. Additional iterations will occur in a
 like manner until the Department approves the Contractor’s QCP. Failure to submit an
 approvable QCP shall not be cause for any adjustment to compensation or time.
 C. Standard QC Plans For items included in Section 400 – Pavements, the Contractor
 may choose to submit a standard QCP which includes any items common to all of their
 plants and paving operations. Standard plans shall be submitted to the Quality Assurance
 Engineer by March 1. The standard plan will apply to all projects constructed by the
 Contractor until a new standard plan is approved the following year. In addition to the
 standard plan, the Contractor must submit a supplemental QCP for each project which
 includes any required items and project specific details not covered by the standard plan.
 Approval of both standard and project specific QCPs shall be as outlined in paragraph B
 above, with the exception that the initial 14 day review period for standard plans will begin
 on March 1.
 Upon final approval of the QCP, the Contractor shall provide 5 bound copies or an
 electronic version to the Department. All Contractor QC personnel shall also be issued their
 own copy of the approved QCP. The Contractor shall communicate the applicable contents of
 the approved QCP to all Contractor and Subcontractor personnel involved in completing the
 work items covered by the QCP.
 The Contractor’s QCP shall consist of plans, procedures, responsibilities, authority, and an
 organizational structure that demonstrates that an effective level of QC will exist and that the
 end result products will comply with all Contract requirements. The Contractor shall provide all
 necessary QC inspection, sampling, and testing to implement the QCP. The QCP shall include
 
 1-76
 
 an organizational structure and reporting requirements that demonstrate that QC personnel have
 sufficient independence to allow them to be primarily concerned with quality, as opposed to
 schedule and budget.
 The individual administering the QCP shall be a full-time employee of or a consultant
 engaged by the Contractor. The individual shall have full authority to institute any and all
 actions necessary for the successful implementation of the QCP.
 The Department will not sample or test for process control or assist in controlling the
 Contractor’s production operations. The Contractor shall provide QC personnel and testing
 equipment capable of providing a quality product that meets or exceeds the Contract
 requirements. Continued production of non-conforming work for a reduced price as
 determined by the Department, instead of making adjustments to bring work into conformance,
 is not allowed.
 106.4.2 Quality Control Plan Requirements The QCP shall include, at a minimum, the
 following:
 Construction items covered by the QCP, as specified in the Contract
 Sampling location and techniques
 Tests and test methods
 Testing frequencies
 Inspection frequencies
 Detailed description of production and placement equipment and methods
 Documentation procedures, including:
 - Inspection and test records
 - Temperature measurements
 - Accuracy, calibration, or recalibration checks performed on production or testing
 equipment
 The QCP shall identify the Contractor’s QC personnel, including the company official
 ultimately responsible for the quality of the work. The Department’s QCP approval process
 may include inspection of testing equipment and a sampling and testing demonstration by the
 Contractor’s QC inspector(s) to assure an acceptable level of performance.
 106.4.3 Testing Qualified technicians in laboratories approved by the Department shall
 perform all QC testing covered by the QCP. Technician qualifications shall be as described in
 the Contract for the corresponding item of work.
 Laboratory facilities shall be clean and all equipment shall be maintained in proper
 working condition. The Department shall be permitted unrestricted access to inspect the
 Contractor’s laboratory facility. The Department will advise the Contractor in writing of any
 noted deficiencies concerning the laboratory facility, equipment, supplies, or testing personnel
 and procedures. Deficiencies shall be grounds for the Department to order an immediate stop
 
 1-77
 
 to incorporating materials into the work until deficiencies are corrected. Work already in place
 affected by QC deficiencies is non-conforming work.
 The Contractor shall maintain original documentation of all inspections, tests, (including
 all associated data such as measurements, weights, dial readings, etc. used in the completion of
 the test), and calculations used to generate reports. The records shall indicate the nature,
 number, and type of deficiencies found, the quantities approved and rejected, and the nature of
 corrective actions taken. The Contractor shall maintain standard testing equipment and
 qualified personnel as required by the Contract.
 The QCP shall include the testing and record keeping requirements for each item as
 contained in the Contract. The number preceding each item refers to the item and specification
 number in the Standard Specifications. When testing requirements are not specified, the
 Contractor shall perform all testing and record keeping as recommended by the manufacturer,
 vendor, or supplier.
 If an item is required to be in the QCP but the Contract does not specify testing
 requirements, the Contractor shall propose testing requirements in the QCP.
 The Contractor shall maintain Control Charts in a manner and location acceptable to the
 Department. At a minimum, the Control Charts shall identify the project number, the Pay Item
 number, each test parameter, the upper and lower control limits applicable to each test
 parameter, and the running average of the last three Contractor test results. The Contractor shall
 use the Control Charts as part of a process control system for identifying production and
 equipment problems and for identifying potential quality reductions before they occur.
 Acceptable Control Charts are part of the approved QCP.
 After final records review, the Contractor will certify in writing to the Department that the
 project has been constructed and inspected, and all materials have been tested in accordance
 with the Contract. All Paving certs shall be submitted on the Paving Company’s Letterhead.
 106.4.4 QC Inspector Qualifications When a QCP is required, the Contractor’s QC
 Inspectors shall hold all certifications from MCTCB or NETTCP that apply to the items
 included in the QCP. The Department may require the Contractor to remove Inspectors from the
 project that are not certified as required or that are otherwise unqualified or unable to fulfill their
 duties in a good and workmanlike manner.
 106.4.5 Inspection Requirements The QCP shall cover all construction operations on the
 site and at off-site production facilities, keyed to the proposed construction materials, sequence
 and schedule. The QCP shall also identify QC personnel (including qualifications), procedures,
 controls, tests, records, and forms to be used.
 The Contractor shall provide a copy of each completed QC report to the Department by 1:00
 PM on the day following each construction activity, unless other arrangements are made with
 
 1-78
 
 the Resident. Failure to provide this report will constitute non-compliance with the QCP and the
 Contract.
 If an item is required to be in the QCP but QC Inspection requirements are not specified in
 the Contract, the Contractor shall propose inspection and record keeping requirements for such
 items in the QCP.
 106.4.6 QCP Non-Compliance The Contractor shall comply with the approved QCP and
 shall take all other steps necessary to assure a high quality project.
 Failure by the Contractor to comply with the approved Quality Control Plan will result in the
 following actions:
 1st Incident: Written warning. If the Contractor does not take corrective action upon
 receipt of written warning, the Department will escalate immediately to the 2nd Incident.
 2nd Incident: Mandatory work suspension until compliance and loss of 1% of the Bid
 Price of all Pay Items covered by the QCP, as described in this Section.
 3rd Incident: Mandatory work suspension until compliance and loss of an additional 2%
 of the Bid Price of all Pay Items covered by the QCP, as described in this Section.
 4th and subsequent Incidents: Mandatory work suspension until compliance and loss of
 an additional 3% of the Bid Price (each occurrence) of all Contract Pay Items covered by the
 QCP, as described in this Section.
 During all periods of the Contractor’s failure to follow the approved QCP, no positive pay
 incentives will be calculated or paid if the Department accepts the material.
 Disincentives for failure to comply with the approved QCP are additive, and the Department
 will deduct any disincentives due from amounts otherwise due the Contractor. These
 disincentives are intended to encourage the Contractor to comply with its approved QCP, and
 are not related to the quality of the material provided.
 106.5 Quality Assurance The Department will conduct Quality Assurance by:
 -Review of QC Reports provided by the Contractor.
 -Monitoring Contractor compliance with the QCP.
 -Random inspection of production, placement and workmanship
 -Randomly accompanying the Contractor’s inspector during QC Inspections/Testing.
 -Acceptance Verification and IA sampling and testing of materials or completed work.
 The Department’s objective is a high quality project through a cooperative effort with the
 Contractor. Items, which are to be buried, covered, are of high cost, or affect the long-term
 durability of the work, will receive extra attention in the QA effort.
 
 1-79
 
 Unacceptable work, found by the Department’s Inspector, will be brought to the attention of
 the Resident, who will determine what corrective action that the Contractor will take. The
 Contractor shall schedule the corrective work with the Resident, and both the QC and
 Department’s Inspectors will witness the corrective work. Failure of the Contractor to correct
 unacceptable work in a timely manner, as determined by the Department, may result in the
 withholding of progress payment(s) or suspension of the work, or both. The Contractor will not
 be eligible for either additional monetary compensation or a time extension should this happen.
 If necessary for protection of the work or for public convenience, the Department may
 accomplish corrective work by other means and deduct the cost from any monies due the
 Contractor.
 The Department may review and obtain copies of all QC test reports (including original test
 data), inspections reports, and control charts at all reasonable times without cost to the
 Department.
 If the Department decides to inspect the materials or operations at the plant, then the
 following conditions shall be met:
 A. The Department shall have the cooperation and assistance of the Contractor and the
 producer with whom the Contractor has arranged for materials.
 B. The Department shall have full access at all times to the parts of the plant that
 concern the manufacture and production of the materials being furnished.
 C. If required, the Contractor shall arrange for an approved testing laboratory building
 for the sole use of the Department. The building shall be located near the plant and conform
 to the requirements of Section 639 - Engineering Facilities.
 D. The Contractor shall provide any needed equipment for safe access to plant
 stockpiles, equipment, and operations.
 106.6 Acceptance The Department is responsible for determining the acceptability of the
 Work. Acceptance of the material is based on the visual inspection of the construction,
 monitoring of the Contractor’s QCP, and Acceptance Test results. Acceptance sampling and
 testing is the responsibility of the Department (unless alternate procedures are specified) except
 for furnishing facilities, testing equipment, transportation, and material samples as required.
 Acceptance of Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement will be based on Method A, B or C Statistical
 Acceptance, or Method D (Small Quantity - Product Verification) as specified. The method of
 acceptance for each item is defined in Special Provision, Section 403, Hot Mix Asphalt
 Pavement. When items of Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement are not so designated, Method A will be
 utilized whenever there are more than 1000 tons per Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement item, and
 Method B will be utilized when there are less than or equal to 1000 tons per Hot Mix Asphalt
 Pavement item.
 
 1-80
 
 Acceptance of structural concrete will be based on Method A or B Statistical Acceptance, or
 Method C Verification. Items to be accepted under Method A, Method B, or Method C are
 defined in Special Provision, Section 502, Structural Concrete Acceptance Methods. When
 items of cast-in-place concrete are not so designated, Method B will be used when there are
 more than 10 cubic yards and Method C will be used when there are 10 cubic yards or less.
 The Department may reject material, which appears to be defective based on visual
 inspection. No payment will be made for the materials rejected by the Department.
 Prior to knowledge of the sample location, the Contractor may remove and replace defective
 material at no cost to the Department. This will not preclude visual rejection of obviously
 defective material. The Department will sample, test, and evaluate new material for acceptance.
 A. Statistical Acceptance methods utilize the Quality Level Analysis and Pay Factor
 Specifications described in Section 106.7 - Quality Level Analysis and in Tables 106.7 A,
 along with specific information contained in the Divisions 400 and 500 Specifications. This
 includes Sections 401 - Hot Mix Asphalt, 402 - Pavement Smoothness, and 502 - Structural
 Concrete.
 Pay Items specified to be sampled and tested under Statistical Acceptance methods will
 be evaluated for acceptance in accordance with the guidelines specified for that Pay Item.
 All Acceptance Test results for a lot as defined in the Specification will be analyzed
 collectively and statistically by the Quality Level Analysis - Standard Deviation
 (Specification Conformance Analysis) Method using the procedures listed to determine the
 total estimated percent of the lot that is within specification limits. Quality Level Analysis
 (Specification Conformance Analysis) is a statistical procedure for estimating the percent
 compliance with a specification and is affected by shifts in the arithmetic mean (x) and by
 the sample standard deviation (s). Analysis of test results will be based on an Acceptance
 Quality Level (AQL) of 90.0, unless otherwise specified. AQL may be viewed as the lowest
 percent within the specification limits of a material that is acceptable as a process average
 and receive 100% pay. The Department will exclude test results on material not
 incorporated in the work from the Quality Level Analysis.
 For items evaluated using Quality Level, and at the Department’s sole discretion, a lot
 with a Quality Level of less than 50 percent within limits will be either (1) removed and
 replaced with acceptable material at the Contractor’s expense, or (2) accepted and paid for at
 a Pay Factor determined by the Department. The Department may also reject material with a
 Quality Level at or above this level, but such material will be removed and replaced by the
 Contractor at the Department’s expense.
 B. Items not designated for Statistical Acceptance will utilize Product Verification testing to
 validate the quality of the material incorporated into the Project. The Contractor shall
 provide the Department with a Certification Letter that indicates that the material supplied
 
 1-81
 
 complies with the Specifications. Test results representative of the certified material shall be
 attached to the letter.
 The Department will randomly sample and test the certified material for properties noted
 in Table 1 of Section 502 - Structural Concrete or Table 8 of Section 401.20 - Acceptance.
 Material will be subject to rejection as noted in Structural Concrete Section 502.195 Quality Assurance Method C Concrete or Hot Mix Asphalt, Section 401.204 - Quality
 Assurance Method D.

 = upper specification limit.
 
 D. Compute the lower quality index (QL):
 _____
 
 QL =
 Where LSL
 
 X-LSL
 s
 
 = lower specification limit.
 
 1-82
 
 E. Determine PU (percent within the upper Specification limit which corresponds to a
 given QU) from Table 106.7 A.
 Note: If a USL is not specified, PU will be 100. If the mean test value is equal to the
 USL, then PU will be 50 regardless of the computed value of s.
 F. Determine PL (percent within the lower Specification limit which corresponds to a
 given QL) from Table 106.7 A.
 If the mean test value is equal to the USL, then PU will be 50 regardless of the
 computed value of s.
 Note: If a LSL is not specified, PL will be 100.
 G. Determine the Quality Level (total percent within Specification limits).
 Quality Level = (PU + PL) - 100
 H. Determine the Pay Factor (PF) for the lot using the Quality Level from Step G.
 For items included in Sections 401 – Hot Mix Asphalt:
 Method A:
 Method B:
 Method C:
 
 PF = [55 + (Quality Level * 0.5)] * 0.01
 PF = [70 + (Quality Level * 0.33)] * 0.01
 PF = [55 + (Quality Level * 0.5)] * 0.01
 
 For items included in Section 402 – Pavement Smoothness:
 PF = [55 + (Quality Level * 0.5)] * 0.01
 For items included in Section 502 – Structural Concrete:
 PF = [55 + (Quality Level * 0.5)] * 0.01
 PF = [70 + (Quality Level * 0.33)] * 0.01
 
 Method A:
 Method B:
 
 I. Determine the Composite Pay Factor (CPF) for each lot.
 CPF =
 Where
 
 [f1(PF1)+f2(PF2)+...fJ(PFJ)]
 f
 fJ
 
 = price adjustment factor listed in the specifications for the
 applicable property.
 
 PFJ
 
 = Pay Factor for the applicable property.
 
 f
 
 = Sum of the “f” (price adjustment) factors.
 
 1-83
 
 Note: Numbers used in the above calculations shall be carried to significant figures and
 rounded according to AASHTO Standard Recommended Practice R-11.
 106.7.2 Statistical Outliers This procedure specifies how outlying observations in sample
 test results will be evaluated for their statistical significance. The Department will use this
 procedure for only those items that are specified to be checked for outlying observations.
 An outlying observation or “outlier” is one that appears to deviate markedly from other
 sample test values in the lot.
 When specified, the procedure will determine whether any value is a statistical outlier. If a
 test result is found to be an outlier, the QA Engineer will investigate the outlying value to
 determine if it should be retained or discarded. The investigation will include but not be limited
 to: examination of all available test data and inspection reports relating to the questionable test
 result, possible additional testing, and discussions with appropriate Contractor and Department
 personnel. If the investigation concludes that an assignable cause cannot be determined for the
 outlying value, it will be discarded; otherwise, it will be retained for pay factor determination.
 Procedure
 __
 
 A. Calculate the sample average ( x ) and standard deviation(s) of all the values in the
 lot.
 B. Find the value “t” from Table 106.7 B corresponding to the sample size for the lot.
 C. Determine D (the total allowable deviation from the average) by multiplying t by s.
 D. Establish values for MAX and MIN by the following:
 ______
 
 MAX = x + D
 
 ______
 
 MIN = x - D
 
 E. Any value greater than MAX or less than MIN is an outlier. The Department will
 investigate any outlying values before determining the Pay Factor for that lot.

 Contractor. If the Department and Contractor cannot agree to the amount of the credit, the work
 shall be unacceptable work.
 106.8.2 Unacceptable Work The Contractor shall remove, replace, or otherwise correct all
 unacceptable work as directed by the Department at the expense of the Contractor, without cost
 or liability to the Department.
 
 1-86

 acceptance of the remedial work. The Contractor warrants and guarantees all remedial work to
 be free from warranty defects for one year after such acceptance.
 106.9.4 Other Warranty Provisions The Contractor hereby assigns to the Department the
 right to enforce all manufacturer’s warranties or guarantees on all materials, equipment or
 products purchased for the work that exceed the nature or duration of the warranty obligations
 assumed by the Contractor under this Contract.

 SECTION 107 - TIME
 Scope of Section This Section contains general time-related provisions of the Contract
 including the Contract Time, allowable Work times, schedule requirements, Liquidated
 Damages, and Project Closeout.
 107.1 Contract Time and Contract Completion Date All Work must be Complete by the
 Contract Completion Date and within the Contract Time. Unless expressly provided otherwise
 by the Department in writing, the Contract Time shall be all time between the Contract
 Execution and the Completion date specified in the Contract, and any authorized extensions.
 107.2 Commencement of Contract Time and Work Unless provided elsewhere in this
 Contract or in writing from the Department, the Contract Time will commence on the date of
 Contract Execution. For related provisions, see Sections 101.2 - Definitions of Contract
 Execution and 103.8 - Execution of Contract by the Department.
 Unless specified otherwise, Work may commence upon Contract Execution, unless the
 Contractor has not secured and provided the Performance and Payment Bonds and Insurance
 Certificates required by Sections 103.5 - Award Conditions, 110.2 - Bonding, and 110.3 Insurance. Any Work performed before the requirements of these sections are met is
 Unauthorized Work and is at the sole risk of the Contractor. Pursuant to Section 110.1 Indemnification, the Contractor and Surety shall indemnify and hold harmless the Department
 from any claims arising from Work.
 107.3 Allowable Work Times
 107.3.1 General Work can be performed at any time except Sundays and Holidays, unless
 expressly specified otherwise in this Contract, including any applicable Permit conditions. If a
 Holiday occurs on a Sunday, the following Monday shall be considered a Holiday. Sunday or
 Holiday work must be approved by the Department, except that the Contractor may work on
 Martin Luther King Day, President’s Day, Patriot’s Day, the Friday after Thanksgiving, and
 Columbus Day without the Department’s approval.
 107.3.2 Night Work If the Contractor performs Work during periods of darkness, the
 Contractor shall comply with Contract requirements governing night Work. If the Contractor
 elects to perform Work during periods of darkness on its own initiative and without direction
 from the Department, then the Contractor shall also comply with all municipal ordinances
 affecting such Work including noise ordinances. When pricing and scheduling the Work, the
 Contractor shall not assume that such non-directed night Work will be allowed. Accordingly,
 the Contractor shall not be entitled to any adjustment to either compensation or time due to its
 inability to secure any required municipal approvals.
 107.3.3 Sundays and Holidays The Contractor shall not carry on construction operations on
 Sundays or Holidays unless (A) expressly specified otherwise in this Contract, (B) authorized
 
 1-89
 
 by the Department, or (C) necessary to avoid or eliminate a clear and immediate risk of
 significant bodily injury to any person.
 107.3.4 Seasonal Work Restrictions The Contractor shall meet all seasonal restrictions on
 time of Work contained in the Contract including all Permits.
 107.4 Scheduling of Work
 107.4.1 General Duty of Contractor The Contractor is solely responsible for the planning
 and execution of Work in order to complete the Work within the Contract Time.
 107.4.2 Schedule of Work Required at least 3 days before the pre-construction meeting and
 before beginning any on-site activities, the Contractor shall provide the Department with its
 Schedule of Work in a Critical Path Method (CPM) in the form of an activity on node (AON)
 diagram. This CPM schedule will become the basis for claims involving delay. The
 Department will waive this CPM requirement for appropriate contracts through a special
 provision. The Contractor shall plan the Work, including the activity of Subcontractors,
 vendors, and suppliers, such that all Work will be performed in Substantial Conformity with its
 Schedule of Work. The Schedule must include sufficient time for the Department to perform its
 functions as indicated in this Contract, including QA inspection and testing, approval of the
 Contractor's TCP, SEWPCP and QCP, and review of Working Drawings.
 At a minimum, the Schedule of Work shall show the major Work activities, milestones,
 durations, submittals and approvals, and a timeline. Milestones to be included in the schedule
 include: (A) start of Work, (B) beginning and ending of planned Work suspensions, (C)
 Completion of Physical Work, and (D) Completion. If the Contractor Plans to Complete the
 Work before the specified Completion date, the Schedule shall so indicate.
 Any restrictions that affect the Schedule of Work such as paving restrictions or In-Stream Work
 windows must be charted with the related activities to demonstrate that the Schedule of Work
 complies with the Contract.
 The Department will review the Schedule of Work and provide comments to the Contractor
 within 20 days of receipt of the schedule. The Contractor will make the requested changes to the
 schedule and issue the finalized version to the Department
 107.4.3 Projected Payment Schedule The Contractor shall provide the Department with a
 Quarterly Projected Payment Schedule that estimates the value of the Work as scheduled,
 including requests for payment of Delivered Materials. The Projected Payment Schedule must
 be in accordance with the Contractor's Schedule of Work and prices submitted by the
 Contractor’s Bid. The Contractor shall submit the Projected Payment Schedule as a condition of
 Award.
 107.4.4 Schedule Revisions The progress of the Work shall be compared against the
 Schedule of Work at each Progress Meeting. If the Department determines that the Contractor’s
 actual progress is not in Substantial Conformity with the Schedule of Work, then the Contractor
 
 1-90
 
 shall either increase Project resources to get back on schedule or submit a revised Schedule of
 Work and Projected Payment Schedule to the Department.
 107.4.5 No Separate Payment Unless expressly provided otherwise, the cost for providing a
 Schedule of Work, a Projected Payment Schedule, and all revisions and updates is Incidental to
 the Contract.
 107.5 Suspension of Work
 107.5.1 Winter Suspensions
 A. Start of Winter Suspension The Contractor may request in writing that the
 Department approve a Winter Suspension. If the Department determines that winter weather
 conditions make it impossible to perform all or specified portions of the Work, the
 Department will approve the Contractor's request with respect to such portions and set the
 start date of the Winter Suspension.
 B. Monitoring and Communications During the Winter Suspension, the Contractor is
 responsible for monitoring weather conditions and requesting approval from the Department
 to resume Work as soon as possible. In any case, the Contractor shall notify the Project
 Manager or Resident 14 Days before the end date of the Winter Suspension specified in
 Section 107.5.1(C), being April 15th or May 1st, as applicable.
 C. End of Winter Suspension Upon request by the Contractor or upon its own initiative,
 the Department may determine the end date of the Winter Suspension and the Contractor is
 responsible for resuming Work immediately after said end date. If the end date is not
 determined by the Department in writing, Winter Suspensions shall end on May 1 for Zone 1
 and April 15th for Zone 2. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, Zone 1 means all
 areas north of Route 2 from Gilead to Bangor and Route 9 from Bangor to Calais and Zone 2
 means all areas south of Zone 1 including Routes 2 and 9.
 D. Impact on Liquidated Damages Liquidated Damages will not be assessed for any
 portion of a Winter Suspension that occurs after expiration of the Contract Time. Winter
 Suspensions will not otherwise affect the assessment of Liquidated Damages. For a related
 provision, see Section 107.7 - Liquidated Damages.
 107.5.2 Suspensions Due To Uncontrollable Events Upon request of the Contractor or upon
 its own initiative, the Department may suspend the Work due to Uncontrollable Events. Any
 Delay related to such a suspension will be analyzed in accordance with Section 109.5 Adjustments for Delay. For a related provision, see Section 101.2 - Definition of Uncontrollable
 Event.
 107.5.3 Suspensions for Cause The Department may suspend the Work if the Contractor
 violates any provision of the Contract that may affect the quality, cost, timeliness or Conformity
 
 1-91
 
 of the Work. Any Delay related to such a suspension will be an Inexcusable Delay. For a
 related provision, see Section 109.5 - Adjustments for Delay.
 107.5.4 Suspensions for Convenience The Department may suspend the Work for any other
 reason it determines is in the best interest of the Department. Any Delay related to such a
 suspension will be analyzed in accordance with Section 109.5 - Adjustments for Delay.
 107.5.5 Pre-Suspension Work If Work is to be suspended for an extended period of time,
 the Contractor shall store all Materials in a manner that does not obstruct the free and safe flow
 of vehicular, pedestrian, railroad, or marine traffic and that protects the Materials from damage.
 The Department may direct the Contractor to install guardrail or other traffic control devices
 necessary to protect the traveling public. The Contractor shall take all precautions to prevent
 damage or deterioration of the Work already performed, provide suitable Drainage of the
 Roadway by opening ditches and Shoulder drains, erecting temporary Structures, and providing
 temporary erosion control where necessary. The cost of such pre-suspension Work will be
 analyzed in accordance with Section 109.5 - Adjustments for Delay.
 For related provisions, see Sections 104.2.6 - Right to Suspend Work, 105.4.4 - Maintenance
 During Suspension of Work, 107.7 - Liquidated Damages, and 109.5 - Adjustments for Delay.
 107.6 Completion Incentives and Disincentives When provided in the Contract, financial
 incentives for early Completion and disincentives for late Completion will be added to or
 deducted from amounts otherwise due the Contractor. Incentives/Disincentives are separate and
 distinct from Liquidated Damages and Supplemental Liquidated Damages.
 107.7 Liquidated Damages
 107.7.1 General The Department and the Contractor acknowledge that time is an essential
 element of the contract, and that delay in completing the work beyond the designated completion
 date will result in damages including but not limited to, damages to the State of Maine due to
 public inconvenience, obstruction to traffic, interference with business, as well as increased
 engineering, inspection, and administrative costs to the Department. The Department and the
 Contractor acknowledge the difficulty of making a precise determination of such damages and,
 as a result, they have agreed to a sum of money in the amount stipulated in the contract that will
 be charged against the Contractor for each calendar day that the work remains uncompleted after
 the expiration of the designated completion date, not as a penalty but as Liquidated and
 Supplemental Liquidated Damages.
 Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Contract, the Contractor or, in case of default, its
 Surety, shall owe the Department the per diem amount specified in Section 107.7.2 - Schedule
 of Liquidated Damages, as well as any per diem amount of Supplemental Liquidated Damages
 as specified in the Supplement Specifications, for each Calendar Day that any portion of the
 Work remains incomplete after the Contract Time has expired. Should the Contractor or its
 Surety, fail to complete the work by the Completion date, a deduction of the amount stipulated
 in the Contract as Liquidated and Supplemental Liquidated Damages will be made for each and
 
 1-92
 
 every calendar day that such contract remains uncompleted. This amount will be deducted from
 any money due the Contractor or its Surety under the Contract, and the Contractor and its Surety
 will be liable for any Liquidated and Supplemental Liquidated Damages in excess of the amount
 due.
 The Contractor acknowledges that the specified amounts per diem of Liquidated and
 Supplemental Liquidated Damages in the Standard Specifications and Supplemental
 Specifications, respectively (if applicable) are reasonable, and agrees to stipulate to their
 reasonableness in any suit for the collection of or involving the assessment of said damages. The
 damages referred to herein are intended to be and are cumulative, and will be in addition to
 every other remedy now or hereafter enforceable at law, in equity, by statute, or under the
 contract.
 Permitting the Contractor to continue and finish the work or any part thereof after the expiration
 of the completion date shall in no way operate as a waiver on the part of the Department of its
 rights to assess and recover Liquidated and Supplemental Liquidated Damages, or any other
 rights, under the Contract.
 For related provisions, see Sections 107.1 - Contract Time, 107.5.1(D) - Winter Suspensions Impact on Liquidated Damages, and 109.5 - Adjustments for Delay.
 107.7.2 Schedule of Liquidated Damages The specific per diem rates for Liquidated
 Damages are set forth below. By executing the Contract, the Contractor acknowledges that such

 107.9 Project Closeout
 107.9.1 Final Cleanup and Finishing To prepare for Final Acceptance, the Contractor shall
 clean the Project and all ground, lawns, streams, Structures, and other areas adjacent to the
 Project of all rubbish, excess Material, temporary Structures, and Equipment. The ground shall
 be backfilled with Material that is generally the same as the surrounding Material, graded to
 drain properly, and finished such that the surface matches the surrounding surface (examples loam and seed, compacted gravel, pavement). The Contractor must leave all areas impacted by
 the Work in a condition that is reasonably acceptable to the Department.
 107.9.2 Notice / Inspection / Punch List The Contractor will notify the Department in
 writing that it considers the Project complete. As soon as practicable thereafter, the Department
 will inspect the Work. If incomplete or unsatisfactory Work is noted, the Department will
 prepare a written list of all items that must be completed or corrected before the Physical Work
 is Complete (“Punch List”). The Contractor shall immediately take such measures as are
 necessary to complete all Punch List items.
 107.9.3 Notices / Final Inspections / Physical Work Completion The Contractor shall notify
 the Department in writing that all Punch List items have been completed and/or corrected and
 that the Contractor considers the Project Complete. As soon as practicable thereafter, the
 Department will make another inspection of the Work. The Department and the Contractor will
 attend this inspection jointly. If incomplete or unsatisfactory Work is noted, the Department
 will prepare a revised Punch List [which may include items not on previous Punch List(s)] and
 the Contractor shall immediately take such measures as are necessary to complete the revised
 Punch List items. Additional iterations will occur in a like manner until the Department finds
 that the Physical Work is Complete and in Conformity with the Contract If the Contractor has
 not already done so, the Contractor will Promptly remove all temporary traffic control devices.
 107.9.4 Closeout Documentation The Department will notify the Contractor in writing that
 the Physical Work is Complete and in Conformity with the Contract and that the Project will be
 Finally Accepted when 106 Memo, Buy America Certification, Materials Certification and DBE
 Signoff, and any other documentation as requested in the Physical Work Complete letter are
 received from the Contractor. The Contractor shall deliver the Closeout documentation as
 requested in the Physical Work Complete letter, to the Department within 30 Days of the date
 of the notification that the Physical Work is Complete. Liquidated Damages will cease upon the
 physical completion of the Work. For a related provision, see Section 101.2 - Definition of
 Closeout Documentation.
 107.9.5 Final Acceptance Within 75 Days of Final Acceptance by the Department, the
 Department will advise the Contractor in writing of the Final Quantities and any damages to be
 assessed for the Project. The Contractor shall resolve any Project issues that remain and provide
 the All Bills Paid and Request for Final Payment Letters to the Department within 30 Days. The
 
 1-94
 
 Department will make Final Payment, including the release of all remaining retainage, and
 release any escrowed bid documents within 20 Days of receipt of the above letters, which
 complete the Closeout Documentation. For a related provision, see Section 108.8 - Final
 Quantity Voucher.
 If the Contractor fails to resolve issues and deliver Closeout Documentation within the 30
 Days provided in Section 107.9.5, the Department may provide a final notice informing the
 Contractor in writing that unless the Contractor Delivers all Closeout Documentation within 30
 Days of the date of Receipt of final notice, the Contractor shall be in Default under the Contract.
 The Contractor shall become ineligible to Bid on any Department Contracts. The Department
 may then pursue all remedies provided by the Contract or by law, including withholding Final
 Payment. For a related provision, see Section 102.1.1 - Eligibility to Bid - Basic Requirements.
 107.9.6 No Waiver of Legal Rights Final Acceptance does not preclude the Department
 from correcting any measure, estimate, or certificate made. The Department may recover from
 the Contractor or its Surety, or both, overpayments made due to failure to fulfill Contract
 obligations.
 A waiver on the part of the Department of any breach of any part of the Contract is not a
 waiver of any other or subsequent breach.
 The Contractor retains liability for latent Defects, fraud (or such gross mistakes as may
 amount to fraud), and warranty obligations.
 SECTION 108 - PAYMENT
 Scope of Section This Section contains general provisions related to payment including
 measurement of quantities, progress payment, retainage, the right to withhold payment, and
 other payment-related terms.
 108.1 Measurement of Quantities for Payment
 108.1.1 Use of Plan Quantities Payment for all items labeled in the Bid Documents as "Plan
 Quantity" will be based upon the estimated quantity for the work described in the Bid
 Documents. The Contractor shall accept such payment as full and complete compensation for
 that item without physical measurement. Quantities included in the plan quantity amount but not
 accomplished will be calculated by the Department using standard estimating procedures and
 deducted from the plan quantity. Areas not included in the plan quantity amount but completed
 will be measured and added to the plan quantity. Upon mutual written Agreement by the
 Department and the Contractor through a Contract Modification, the estimated quantity of any
 item of Work may be used as the final quantity for that item without physical measurement.
 108.1.2 General Measurement Provisions The Department will use the U.S. Customary
 system for all measurements unless the Contract utilizes the International System of Units (SI).
 
 1-95
 
 Measurement of Bid Items shall include all resources necessary to complete the Pay Item of
 Work under the Contract. The Department will measure items for payment in accordance with
 the “Method of Measurement” provisions of the applicable Specification. For all items of
 Work, other than those paid for by lump sum, the Department shall determine the quantities
 accepted as the basis for Final Payment after the Physical Work is Completed.
 108.1.3 Provisions Relating to Certain Measurements Unless expressly provided otherwise,
 the Department and the Contractor shall use the following general measurement provisions.
 Lump Sum or Each Lump Sum payment is total reimbursement for all resources
 necessary to complete the item of Work. Quantities provided for items measured and paid
 by Lump Sum are estimated quantities and are provided for informational purposes, only.
 There will be no additional payment made by the Department or reduction in payment to the
 Contractor if the actual, final, quantities for items measured and paid by Lump Sum are
 different than the quantities estimated by the Department. The only exception to this is
 when an item is eliminated, in which case Standard Specification Section 109.2, Elimination
 of Items, would take precedence.
 Each is payment per complete unit.
 Length Length is defined as linear measurement parallel to the item base or foundation.
 A station is 100 feet.
 Area Area refers to the length, as defined above, multiplied by the width, which is
 defined as the linear measurement perpendicular to the item base or foundation. When
 calculating area for payment, use horizontal, longitudinal, and plan (neat) transverse
 measurements for surface area computations. Make no deductions for individual fixtures
 having an area of 1 square yard or less. For purposes of the preceding sentence, “fixtures”
 means small subareas that do not receive material(s) or on which no Work is performed.
 Volume Measure Structures using plan (neat) or approved Contract Modification
 dimensions. Use the average end area method to compute excavation volumes. Use hauling
 vehicles approved by the Department, when transporting Materials measured by volume.
 Measure materials at the point of delivery. Ensure the body shape allows contents to be
 accurately measured. Load and level vehicles to the lesser of their water level or legal
 capacity. Obtain the Department’s approval to convert Materials specified for measure by
 mass to volume. Use specified conversion factors.
 Measure water to the nearest gallon with calibrated tanks, distributors, certified scale
 weights or water meters.
 Measure bituminous materials by the gallon or ton.
 Use net certified scale weights or certified rail car volumes. Correct for bituminous
 Material lost, wasted, or otherwise not incorporated in the Work. Correct net certified
 
 1-96
 
 bituminous Material weights or volumes for loss or foaming when shipped by truck or
 transport.
 Measure timber by the board foot. Base measurement on nominal widths and
 thicknesses and individual maximum lengths.
 Mass One ton is 2,000 pounds. Use certified scales to determine mass (weight). Accept
 certified “car weights” for Material shipped by rail, except for Material to be subsequently
 processed in mixing plants. Obtain certified haul truck tares as specified. Each Haul Truck
 shall display a legible identification mark.
 Measure cement by the pound or ton.
 Accept nominal mass or dimensions for standard manufactured items unless otherwise
 specified.
 Accept industry-established manufacturing tolerances, unless otherwise specified.
 Measure Aggregate mass in the saturated surface dry condition.
 The Contractor shall furnish and maintain weigh systems tested and certified by the State
 or use certified permanently installed commercial scales. The Contractor shall provide
 certifications after each set-up and before use or as requested by the Department. The weigh
 system shall be scaled after certification and display a certification stamp. Only mechanical
 or electronic scales shall be used.
 The beams, dials, platforms, and other scale Equipment shall be arranged for safe and
 convenient viewing by the operator and inspector. Scales shall be tested for accuracy before
 use at a new site. Platform scales shall be level and with rigid bulkheads at each end. The
 Department will adjust quantities of Materials received on scales found to be outside of
 specified tolerances, using a correction based on the last documented test within specified
 tolerances.
 All materials, which are measured or proportioned by weight, shall be weighed on
 approved weighing systems. When a delivery slip is required for payment of Materials
 measured by weight, weighing, except for automatic ticket printer systems, shall be
 performed on approved platform truck scales by a Licensed Public Weighmaster furnished
 by the Contractor, in accordance with the following requirements.
 (A) Licensed Public Weighmaster A Licensed Public Weighmaster shall be any
 person satisfying the requirements of the State Sealer of Weights and Measures and
 granted a license as a Public Weighmaster. Each Licensed Public Weighmaster shall
 provide him/her with an impression seal as required by the State Sealer and shall impress
 this seal upon delivery slips issued by him/her. When completed by a Licensed Public
 Weighmaster, delivery slips shall be considered as the Weight Certificates required by
 
 1-97
 
 the Maine Weights and Measures Law, MRSA Title 10. The Weighmaster shall perform
 all duties required of him/her by law and the specifications.
 (B) Weighing Trucks Tare weights of trucks hauling stone, bituminous mixes and
 similar items shall be determined twice daily, once during the forenoon and once during
 the afternoon. The tare weight thus found shall be used to determine the net load until
 the next tare weighing of the empty truck. Tare weights of trucks hauling liquid and
 bituminous cement materials or other items not generally on a repeat basis shall be
 determined immediately before being loaded and the weight thus found shall be used for
 that load only. The tare weight of a truck shall be defined as the weight of the empty
 vehicle including the driver, but with no passengers.
 (C) Platform Truck Weighing Systems An approved platform truck scale, meeting
 the following requirements shall be provided, installed and maintained, when required,
 by the Contractor or be available to him/her at an approved nearby location:
 1) The weighing system shall conform to the specifications, tolerances and
 regulations for commercial weighing devices of the National Institute of Standards
 and Technology and shall be accurate within maximum tolerances of plus or minus 2
 pounds for every 1000 pounds of load.
 2) No auxiliary indicators, in combination with the beams or dial of the weighing
 system shall be used to increase the maximum allowable load above 105 percent of
 the manufacturer’s rated capacity, as stated in the National Institute of Standards and
 Technology Handbook 44 S.1.7.
 3) The platform of the weighing system shall be sufficient size to accommodate
 the entire vehicle or combination of vehicles. If a combination of vehicles must be
 divided into separate units in order to be weighed, each unit shall be entirely
 disconnected before weighing and a separate weight certificate, delivery slip, or
 ticket shall be issued for each separate unit.
 4) The value of the minimum graduation on the indicator of the scale shall not be
 greater than 20 pounds. All weighing shall be read and recorded to the nearest 20
 pounds or one-hundredth ton.
 5) The weighing system shall be set on concrete or other approved foundation.
 The recording mechanism of the scale shall be suitably housed or protected from
 weather.
 6) The Contractor shall have the weighing system inspected and approved by the
 State Sealer of Weights and Measures or by a Repairman registered and approved by
 the State Sealer within a period of 12 months preceding the date of any weighing and
 again after each change of location.
 
 1-98
 
 (D) Check Weighing for Platform Truck Weighing System Check weighing shall be
 made on the weights and on the weighing in scales during production in the following
 manner:
 1) At least twice during 5 days of production, in the presence of a State Inspector,
 a loaded truck which has been weighed and issued a weigh slip shall be turned and a
 new weighing made of the truck and load with the truck heading in reverse direction
 and at the opposite end of the weighing system platform from the first weighing. The
 new weight will be recorded. If the variation from the first weight is 0.2 percent or
 less, the fact will be so noted in the project records. However, if the variation
 exceeds 0.2 percent, the scales may not be used until rechecked and resealed by the
 State Sealer of Weights and Measures.
 2) At least twice during 5 days of production, a loaded truck, which has moved
 off the weighing system, will be intercepted, directed back to the scales, and
 reweighed under supervision of a State Inspector.
 3) At least twice during 5 days of production, in the presence of a State Inspector,
 a truck which has been emptied will be directed to the weighing system before being
 loaded at a time other than the normal tare weighing and weighed again for a check
 on the tare weight.
 4) Check weighing will be on a plant basis and, although a plant may produce
 material for more than one project or Contract, check weighing will not be required
 for each project or Contract.
 5) Although at least twice during 5 days of production, additional checks will be
 made occasionally at the discretion of the Engineer. Claims by the Contractor for
 delays or inconvenience due to check weighing will not be considered.
 (E) Reciprocal Agreements Weighing of materials on weighing systems located
 outside the State of Maine will be permitted for materials produced or stored outside the
 State, when requested by the Contractor and approved. Out-of-state weighing, in order
 to be approved, must be performed by a Licensed Public Weighmaster or a person of
 equal authority in the State concerned, on scales accepted in the State concerned and
 meeting the requirements of this Section.
 (F) Delivery Slips Serially pre-numbered delivery slips of acceptable size and format
 for stating the following minimum information shall be furnished by the Contractor, in
 as many copies as may be necessary. One copy shall be retained by the Resident or
 Inspector upon accepting delivery of the material.
 1) Vehicle identification
 2) Date loaded
 3) Work identification number & location
 
 1-99
 
 4) Identification of material:
 a) Item number
 b) Source location of supplier
 c) Type and grade
 d) Tank number from which loaded, if liquid
 5) Quality information as necessary for bituminous liquids
 a) Specific gravity at 60°F
 b) Serial number of the Certificate of Analysis as furnished according to
 Division 700, General Statement
 c) The Certificate Statement as required in Division 700, General Statement
 d) The Viscosity of the material: if asphalt cement, in poises at 140°F and in
 centistokes at 275°F; if other bituminous liquid, the specified viscosity
 according to the type and grade shown in Section 702
 6) Quantity information as necessary: gross, tare and net weights, volume of load
 if not material requiring weighing, net gallons at 60°F if bituminous liquids
 7) Signatures (legible initials acceptable) of: Weighmaster (if weight measured
 material), Contractor’s representative (if volume measured material), and
 Resident (Cover Slips).
 If materials are shipped by rail the car weight may be accepted provided that only the
 actual weight of material is paid for. However, car weights will not be acceptable for
 materials to be passed through mixing plants. Trucks used to haul material being paid
 for by weight shall be weighed empty daily, at such times as directed. Each truck shall
 bear a legible identification mark.
 Rail shipments of bituminous liquid shall be measured directly by volume.
 Correction shall be made when liquid bituminous material has been lost from the car,
 wasted, or otherwise not incorporated in the work. Other shipments of bituminous
 liquids will be measured by the gallon or ton. Volumes will be measured at 60°F or will
 be corrected to the volume at 60°F using the tables in ASTM D1250.
 When bituminous liquids are shipped by truck or transport, net certified weights or
 volume subject to correction for loss or foaming may be used for computing quantities.
 Net certified weight shall be determined upon loading for all bituminous liquids when
 shipped by truck or transport. The net weight of each load shall be converted to net
 gallons at 60°F by a conversion factor expressed in pounds per gallon.
 (G) Time Measure Equipment by hours in accordance with Section 631 - Equipment
 Rental.
 108.2 Progress Payments
 108.2.1 Generation of Progress Payment Estimates The Department will estimate the
 amount of Work performed at least monthly and make payment based upon such estimates.
 Estimates may be paid once every two weeks if, in the opinion of the Resident, the amount of
 
 1-100
 
 Work performed is sufficient to warrant such payment. No such estimates or payment will be
 made if, in the judgment of the Resident, the Work is not proceeding in accordance with the
 provisions of the Contract, or when the total value of the Work performed since the last estimate
 amounts to less than $5,000. The Contractor agrees to waive all claims related to the timing
 and amount of such estimates.
 If the Contract requires, the Contractor will submit an application for progress payment with
 a detailed written explanation of the payments requested, on forms and media approved by the
 Department, to the Resident for approval. The Resident may request that the Contractor submit
 backup documentation including copies of receipts, invoices, and itemized payments to
 Subcontractors.
 108.2.2 Payment The Department will make payment within 15 Days if the Contractor
 agrees to accept electronic transfer of payments in a manner approved by the Department, except
 as otherwise provided in the Contract. In other cases, the Department will make payment within
 30 days, except as otherwise provided in the Contract. These payment obligations shall not
 apply in the event of unforeseeable circumstances such as insufficient legislative appropriations,
 information systems failure, and other Uncontrollable Events. All payments made are subject to
 correction in subsequent Progress Payments and the Final Payment. For related provisions, see
 Sections 108.8 - Final Payment, and 108.9.2 - No Inflation Adjustments/ Interest.
 108.2.3 Mobilization Payments Mobilization includes the mobilization and demobilization
 of all resources as many times as necessary during the Work.
 Upon approval of all pre-construction submittals required for approval by this Contract
 including those listed in Section 104.4.2 - Preconstruction Conference, the Contractor will
 receive payment of 50% of the Lump Sum price for Mobilization, not to exceed 5% of the Bid
 less the amount bid for Mobilization. After the Department determines that the Work is 50%
 complete, the Contractor will receive the other 50% of the Lump Sum price for Mobilization,
 not to exceed 5% of the Bid less the amount bid for Mobilization. Any remaining Mobilization
 will be paid upon Final Acceptance.
 108.3 Retainage The Department will pay 100% of each approved Progress Payment until the
 Work is approximately 50% complete. Thereafter, the Department will deduct 5% of the
 amount of each Progress Payment as retainage In the event that the Department believes that
 the retainage will be insufficient to cover the Contractor’s obligations under this Contract, the
 Department may withhold a greater percentage of the money to cover Contractor obligations.
 The Department may hold, temporarily or permanently, retainage as needed to assure timely
 Completion of the Work and payment of all Subcontractors and Suppliers in Conformity with
 the Contract. The Department may also disburse retainage to Subcontractors as set forth in
 Section 104.5.6 - Subcontractor Claims for Payment.
 The Contractor may withdraw retainage by depositing certain securities with the Treasurer of
 State as provided by 23 MRSA § 52-A(1).
 
 1-101
 
 Upon Final Acceptance , the Contractor may request that the Department reduce retainage.
 The Department may grant or deny such request as it deems desirable and prudent. Otherwise,
 retainage will be held until the receipt of all Closeout Documentation
 108.4 Payment for Materials Obtained and Stored Acting upon a request from the
 Contractor and accompanied by bills or receipted bills, the Department will pay for all or part of
 the value of acceptable, non-perishable Materials that are to be incorporated in the Work,
 including Materials that are to be incorporated into the Work, not delivered on the Work site,
 and stored at places acceptable to the Department. Examples of such Materials include steel
 piles, stone masonry, curbing, timber and lumber, metal Culverts, stone and sand, gravel, and
 other Materials. The Department will not make payment on living or perishable Materials until
 acceptably planted in their final locations.
 If payment for Materials is made to the Contractor based on bills, only, then the Contractor
 must provide receipted bills to the Department for these Materials within 14 days of the date the
 Contractor receives payment for the Materials. Failure of the Contractor to provide receipted
 bills for these Materials within 14 days of the dated the Contractor receives payment will result
 in the paid amount being withheld from the subsequent progress payment, or payments, until
 such time the receipted bills are received by the Department.
 Materials paid for by the Department are the property of the Department, but the risk of loss
 shall remain with the Contractor. Payment for Materials does not constitute Acceptance of the
 Material. If Materials for which the Department has paid are later found to be unacceptable,
 then the Department may withhold amounts reflecting such unacceptable Materials from
 payments otherwise due the Contractor.
 In the event of Default, the Department may use or cause to be used all paid-for Materials in
 any manner that is in the best interest of the Department.”

 Hot Mix Asphalt: The quantity of hot mix asphalt will be determined from the quantity
 shown on the progress estimate for each pay period.
 Base Price: The base price of performance graded binder to be used is the price per standard
 ton current with the bid opening date. This price is determined by using the average New
 England Selling Price (Excluding the Connecticut market area), as listed in the Asphalt
 Weekly Monitor.
 Period Price: The period price of performance graded binder will be determined by the
 Department by using the average New England Selling Price (Excluding the Connecticut
 market area), listed in the Asphalt Weekly Monitor current with the paving date. The
 maximum Period Price for paving after the adjusted Contract Completion Date will be the
 Period Price on the adjusted Contract Completion Date.
 108.5 Right to Withhold Payments The Department may withhold payments claimed by the
 Contractor on account of:
 A. Defective Work,
 B. Damages for Non-conforming Work,
 C. Failure to provide the Department the opportunity to inspect the Work,
 D. Damage to a third party,
 E. Claims filed or reasonable evidence indicating probable filing of claims,
 F. Failure of the Contractor to make payments to Subcontractors or for Materials or
 labor, or failure of Subcontractors to make payments to Sub-Subcontractors or for
 Materials or labor,
 G. Substantial evidence that the Project cannot be completed for the unpaid balance,
 
 1-104
 
 H. Substantial evidence that the amount due the Department will exceed the unpaid
 balance,
 I. Regulatory non-compliance or enforcement,
 J. Failure to submit Closeout Documentation,
 K. All other causes that the Department reasonably determines negatively affect the
 State’s interest.
 108.6 Taxes, Fees, Allowances, and Notices The Contractor shall pay all taxes, charges,
 fees, and allowances and give all notices necessary and incidental to the due and lawful
 prosecution of the Work. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Contract, all such
 taxes, charges, fees, and allowances are Incidental to the Contract.
 Most items are exempt from Maine sales tax. The Contractor shall Bid in accordance with
 the Maine statutory exemption from sales tax located at 36 MRSA §1760, subsections (2) and
 (61).
 108.7 Damages for Non-Conforming Work If the Contractor performs Non-conforming
 Work that causes the Department to incur costs including environmental costs or penalties,
 failure of the Federal Highway Administration to participate in certain costs for reasons due to
 the Contractor's performance, Departmental staff time related to the non-Conformity, penalties,
 or other damages of any nature whatsoever (“damages”), then the Contractor shall be liable to
 the Department for such Damages. The Department, at its option, and without liability, may
 deduct such Damages from amounts otherwise due the Contractor and/or postpone disbursement
 of Progress Payments until the non-Conformity is corrected.
 108.8 Final Quantity Voucher The Department will prepare a final quantity voucher
 reflecting final quantities of the items of Work performed. The Department may require the
 Contractor to provide information necessary to substantiate Pay Items, including Statements
 itemizing Force Account Work.
 108.9 General Payment Provisions
 108.9.1 Full Compensation Payments to the Contractor shall be full compensation for
 furnishing all labor, Equipment, Materials, services, and Incidentals used to perform all Work
 under the Contract in a complete and acceptable manner, and for all risk, loss, damage, or
 expense of any kind arising from the nature or prosecution of the Work.
 108.9.2 No Inflation Adjustments / Interest No payments due the Contractor will be
 adjusted for inflation. No interest shall be due and payable on any payment due the Contractor,
 except that the Department will pay statutory interest on uncontested Final Payments for any
 period of time that extends beyond 60 Days of the date of Receipt of all Conforming Closeout
 Documentation. The preceding exception expressly does not include payments regarding
 pending Issues, a Dispute or claim.
 
 1-105
 
 108.9.3 Amounts Due the Department Unless expressly provided otherwise in this Contract,
 in cases where the Department may deduct sums from amounts otherwise due the Contractor
 and where the sums to be deducted are more than the funds otherwise due the Contractor, the

 from the Department. After such 30 Days, the Contractor shall be in Default of this Contract
 and shall not be entitled to any additional cure period. Statutory interest shall accrue after 60
 Days of Receipt of the Invoice.
 SECTION 109 - CHANGES
 Scope of Section This Section contains general provisions related to changes in quantities,
 scope, time and payment.
 109.1 Changes in Quantities
 109.1.1 Changes Permitted The Department may increase or decrease Pay Item quantities
 from the estimated quantities shown in the Bid Documents, and such increase or decrease shall
 not be considered Extra Work. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Contract, the
 Contractor shall be paid for actual quantities in place and Accepted at the Unit Prices contained
 in the Contractor’s Bid. The Contractor accepts such payment as full and complete
 compensation. There will be no adjustment to Contract Time due to an increase or decrease in
 quantities, compared to those estimated, except as addressed through Contract Modification(s).
 109.1.2 Substantial Changes to Major Items If quantities of Major Items vary from the
 estimated quantities contained in the Bid Documents by more than 25%, then the Department
 may increase or decrease the Unit Price of such item using the extra work process. For related
 provisions, see Section 109.3 - Extra Work and Section 109.8 - Contract Modification. If an
 adjustment to the Unit Price is made, it will apply only to that portion of the actual quantity that
 is less than 75% of the estimated quantity or more than 125% of the estimated quantity.
 109.2 Elimination of Items Upon written notification to the Contractor, the Department may
 entirely eliminate item(s) of Work for any reason. Upon notification, the Department is entitled
 to a credit. For Minor Items, the credit shall be the Contractor's Bid price for the eliminated
 item(s). For Major Items, the amount of the credit shall be the Contractor's Bid price for the
 eliminated item(s), less (A) direct costs actually incurred by the Contractor after Award,
 including mobilization, shipping, and restocking expenses that the Contractor cannot recoup on
 other Projects as reasonably determined by the Department, and (B) 10% for overhead and
 profit. The Department may withhold said credit from amounts otherwise due the Contractor.
 109.3 Extra Work The Department reserves the right to revise the Contract by adding Extra
 Work. Such revisions neither invalidate the Contract nor release the Surety. The Contractor
 and/or its Surety agree to perform all such Extra Work. The Department will compensate for
 Extra Work by written Contract Modification in accordance with Section 109.7.1 - General and
 Section 109.7.2 - Basis of Payment. Any Delay related to Extra Work will be analyzed in
 
 1-106
 
 accordance with Section 109.5 - Adjustments for Delay. For a related provision, see Section
 109.8 - Contract Modification.
 109.4 Differing Site Conditions
 109.4.1 Definition "Differing Site Conditions" are subsurface or latent physical conditions
 that, at the time of Bid submittal, were:
 (A) Materially different from conditions indicated in the Bid Documents,
 (B) Not discoverable from a reasonable site investigation prior to Bid,
 (C) Materially different from conditions ordinarily encountered and generally recognized
 as inherent in Work like that specified by the Contract by Contractors experienced in such
 Work, and
 (D) Actually unknown to the party seeking relief due to such conditions, which in the
 case of the Contractor includes its Subcontractors.
 109.4.2 Risk of Other Conditions All costs, Work, Delays, or other damages related to or
 arising from site conditions that are not Differing Site Conditions are the sole risk and
 responsibility of the Contractor.
 109.4.3 Notice and Procedural Requirements If the Contractor discovers what it considers
 Differing Site Conditions that may cause adjustments to compensation, time, or other Contract
 requirements, the Contractor shall provide "Notice of Issue for Consideration" within 48 hours
 of discovery and before doing any Work relating to such conditions as provided in Section
 104.4.5 - Early Negotiation. The Contractor shall then comply with all other requirements of
 Section 104.4.5 - Early Negotiation, and Section 111 - Resolution of Disputes. The Contractor
 will not be entitled to any change to compensation, time, or Work requirements without proper
 notice as specified herein. Failure to provide such notice or to otherwise comply with this
 Section 109.4 will constitute a waiver of all claims related to such conditions.
 If the Department discovers what it considers Differing Site Conditions that may cause
 adjustments to compensation, time, or other Contract requirements, then the Department will
 provide the Contractor with notice within 48 hours of discovery. If the Contractor disagrees
 with the Department’s finding of Differing Site Conditions or the related adjustments, then the
 Contractor shall provide “Notice of Issue for Consideration” within 48 hours and comply with
 the requirements of Section 104.4.5 - Early Negotiation and Section 111 - Resolution of
 Disputes.
 109.4.4 Investigation / Adjustment Upon notification by the Contractor or upon the
 Department's own initiative, the Department will investigate the conditions. If the Department
 determines that Differing Site Conditions exist and that the Differing Site Conditions have
 caused an increase in the cost or time required for the performance of the Work, then the
 Contractor is entitled to an Equitable Adjustment for the additional costs in accordance with
 Section 109.7, Equitable Adjustments to Compensation and Time, - Basis of Payment that are
 caused directly by the Differing Site Conditions. If the Department determines that Differing
 
 1-107
 
 Site Conditions exist and that the Differing Site Conditions have caused a decrease in the cost or
 time required for the performance of the Work, then the Department is entitled to a credit in the
 amount of savings to compensable items in accordance with Section 109.7, Equitable
 Adjustments to Compensation and Time, , that are caused directly by the Differing Site
 Conditions. Delays caused by Differing Site Conditions will be considered in accordance with
 Section 109.5 - Adjustments for Delay.
 109.5 Adjustments for Delay
 109.5.1 Definitions - Types of Delays Delays are defined as follows and may be divided
 into more than one type depending upon cause.
 A. Excusable Delay Except as expressly provided otherwise by this Contract, an
 "Excusable Delay" is a Delay to the Critical Path that is directly and solely
 caused by (1) a weather related Uncontrollable Event of such an unusually
 severe nature that a Federal Emergency Disaster is declared. The
 Contractor will only be entitled to an Equitable Adjustment if the Project
 falls within the geographic boundaries prescribed under the disaster
 declaration. or (2) a flooding event at the effected location of the Project
 that results in a Q25 headwater elevation, or greater, but less than a Q50
 headwater elevation. Theoretical headwater elevations will be determined
 by the Department; actual headwater elevations will be determined by the
 Contractor and verified by the Department.
 B. Compensable Delay A "Compensable Delay" is a Delay to the Critical Path that is
 directly and solely caused by: (1) a weather related Uncontrollable Event
 of such an unusually severe nature that a Federal Emergency Disaster is
 declared. The Contractor will only be entitled to an Equitable Adjustment
 if the Project falls within the geographic boundaries prescribed under the
 disaster declaration and receives project-specific emergency funds, and
 the Contractor can show proof that the Work was delayed by this weather
 event, (2) an Uncontrollable Event caused by a Utility Company for
 which the Utility Company reimburses the Department, (3) an
 Uncontrollable Event caused by other third party (not Subcontractors)
 Working on Project-related Work within the Project Limits if, and only if,
 the such other third party offers the Department reimbursement for such
 Delay, or (4) acts by the Department that are in violation of applicable
 laws or the Contract, or (5) a flooding event at the effected location of the
 Project that results in a Q50 headwater elevation, or greater. Theoretical
 Q50 headwater elevations will be determined by the Department; actual
 headwater elevations will be determined by the Contractor and verified by
 the Department.
 C. Inexcusable Delay "Inexcusable Delays" are all Delays that are not Excusable
 Delays or Compensable Delays.
 
 1-108
 
 For a related provision, see Section 101.2 - Definition of Uncontrollable Event.
 109.5.2 Entitlement to Adjustments
 A. Types of Adjustments Provided the Contractor meets the requirements of Section
 109.5.2(B) below and complies with the notification, documentation, and procedural
 requirements set forth in the Contract, the Contractor is entitled to certain adjustments to the
 Contract depending upon the type of Delay.
 1. If an Excusable Delay, the Contractor is entitled to an extension of time, but no
 additional compensation.
 2. If a Compensable Delay, the Contractor is entitled to an extension of time and an
 Equitable Adjustment as set forth in Section 109.7 - Equitable Adjustments to
 Compensation and Time.
 3. If an Inexcusable Delay, the Contractor is entitled to neither an extension of time
 nor additional compensation.
 For related provisions, see Sections 104.2.7 - Damage to Project Caused By
 Uncontrollable Events and 104.3.10 - Responsibility for the Damage to Work.
 B. Requirements for Entitlement To be entitled to any adjustments for an Excusable
 Delay or a Compensable Delay, the Contractor must demonstrate all of the following.
 1. The Contractor consistently utilized its Schedule of Work to schedule,
 coordinate, and manage the Work as evidenced by documentation created as the
 Work progressed including Progress Meeting minutes;
 2. The Delay impacted the Critical Path of the Schedule of Work; and
 3. There are no concurrent Inexcusable Delays.
 C. Concurrent Delays The Contractor is not entitled to a time extension for the period of
 time when Excusable and Inexcusable Delays are concurrent. The Contractor also is not
 entitled to either time extension or an Equitable Adjustment for the period of time when
 Compensable and Inexcusable Delays are concurrent. In the event Compensable and
 Excusable Delays are concurrent, the Contractor is only entitled to time extension, not an
 Equitable Adjustment, for the period of time such Delays are concurrent.
 109.5.3 Early Completion Date Delay Claims For the purposes of this Section 109.5.3, a
 “Contractor’s Early Completion Date” means a Project Completion date shown on the
 Contractor’s initial Schedule of Work submitted in accordance with Section 107.4.2 - Schedule
 of Work Required that is earlier than the Contract's specified Completion date. The Department
 will not be liable for any claims or expenses related to the period of time between the
 
 1-109
 
 Contractor’s Early Completion Date and the Contract’s specified Completion date, unless the
 Contractor demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence that: (A) all requirements of Section
 109.5.2(B) - Requirements for Entitlement are met, and (B) that the Contractor’s Early
 Completion Date was reasonable at the time of Bid in light of the surrounding facts and
 circumstances, including the Contractor's available resources, and the requirements of the Work.
 109.5.4 Notice and Procedural Requirements If the Contractor becomes aware of facts or
 circumstances that may cause a Delay for which the Contractor may seek adjustments to
 compensation, time, or other Contract requirements, the Contractor must notify the Resident of
 such “Issue” within 48 hours and before doing any Work relating to such facts or circumstances
 as provided in Section 104.4.5 - Early Negotiation. Except as otherwise provided in this Section
 109.5, the Contractor shall then comply with all other requirements of Part 111 - "Resolution of
 Disputes". The Contractor will not be entitled to any change to compensation, time, or Work
 requirements without proper and timely notice. Failure to provide such notice constitutes a
 waiver of all claims related to such conditions.
 109.5.5 Documenting the Delay and Request for Adjustments
 A. Weekly Reports During Delay To be entitled to any adjustments for Delay, the
 Contractor must keep records as provided in Section 111.1.6 - Contractor's Obligation to
 Keep Records. Further, the Contractor must submit weekly written reports containing the
 following information.
 1. Number of Days of impact to the Critical Path.
 2. A summary of all operations that have been Delayed, or will be Delayed on the
 impact of the Contractor's Critical Path.
 3. A narrative describing how the cause of the Delay meets the definition of
 "Excusable Delay" or "Compensable Delay" contained in Section 109.5.1(A) or
 (B).
 4. Itemization of all extra costs being incurred, including (A) how the extra costs
 relate to the Delay, (B) the identification of all non-salaried Project employees for
 whom costs are being compiled, and (c) a summary of time charges for
 Equipment, identified by the manufacturer's number for which costs are being
 compiled.
 B. Request and Report After Completion Within 14 Days of Completion of the phase of
 Work that the Contractor claims has been Delayed, the Contractor shall submit a written
 report to the Department that contains the following information.
 1. A description of the operations that were Delayed and the documentation and
 narrative of how the cause for the Delay meets the definition of "Excusable
 Delay" or "Compensable Delay" contained in Sections 109.5.1(A) or (B),
 including all reports prepared for the Contractor by consultants, if used;
 
 1-110
 
 2. An as-built chart showing when Work operations were actually performed;
 3. A graphic depiction of how the operations were Delayed and the impact on the
 Critical Path; and
 4. An item-by-item request for additional time and compensation for items allowed
 under Section 109.7.5 – Force Account Work, including measurement and
 explanation.
 The Department may require that all costs shown in the report be certified by an accountant,
 and that the Contractor provide all other information described in Section 111.2.2 - Detailed
 Notice of Dispute.
 109.5.6 Decision by Program Manager Within 30 Days of receiving all information
 described in Section 109.5.5(B) - Request and Report After Completion, the Program Manager
 will Deliver a written decision on the request made to the Contractor. Failure to provide a
 decision within said 30-day period shall be considered a denial of the Contractor's request,
 unless the parties mutually agree to an extension of time for such decision.
 109.5.7 Additional Consideration By Department If the Contractor wants additional
 consideration, the Contractor shall Deliver a “Notice of Unresolved Dispute” to the
 Department's appropriate Bureau Director within 14 Days of Receipt of the Program Manager’s
 decision. Such Notice shall comply with Section 111.3.1 - Notice of Unresolved Dispute. The
 parties must then comply with all other Dispute resolution provisions of this Contract, beginning
 with Section 111.3 - Negotiation By Management.
 109.6 Value Engineering
 109.6.1 Overview - General Requirements A Value Engineering Change Proposal (VECP) is a
 proposal made by the Contractor after Contract Execution that is intended to produce cost
 savings without impairing essential characteristics of the Project including function,
 serviceability, safety, durability, maintainability, and aesthetics, all as determined by the
 Department.
 A VECP shall contain proven features that have been used under similar conditions. A
 proposal is not a VECP if equivalent options are already provided in the Contract.
 A VECP must be approved by the Department. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
 Contractor and the Department will equally share the Net Savings generated by the VECP as
 provided in Section 109.6.4(C) - Contract Modification - Amount of Payment.
 Unless mutually agreed otherwise, the VECP approval process will occur in three steps: (A)
 Conceptual VECP submission and review, (B) Detailed VECP submission and evaluation, and
 if approved, (C) Contract Modification including the amount of payment due to the Contractor
 and credit due to the Department. When the nature and scope of a VECP warrants, the parties
 may agree to truncate the VECP approval process.
 
 1-111
 
 109.6.2 Conceptual VECP
 A. Submittal To propose a VECP, the Contractor must submit a written "Conceptual
 VECP" to the Resident. The Conceptual VECP is not a formal and complete submittal
 based upon detailed technical analysis, but instead relays a conceptual idea based upon the
 Contractor's knowledge and experience. The Conceptual VECP should include the
 following information:
 1. General Description A narrative that describes the proposed change in concept
 and includes the basic differences between the existing Contract and the proposed
 change.
 2. Advantages and Disadvantages A listing and brief description of the comparative
 advantages and disadvantages of the VECP including effects on function,
 serviceability, safety, durability, maintainability, aesthetics, and any other factors
 significantly altered by the VECP.
 3. Estimate of Net Savings An estimate of the Net Savings as defined in Section
 109.6.4(C) - Contract Modification - Amount of Payment.
 4. Savings and Schedule Impacts An estimate of the time necessary for the
 Contractor to submit a Detailed VECP. Such estimate must specify the date by
 which the Department must approve the VECP to obtain the maximum cost
 reduction, and the latest date by which the Department must approve the VECP
 for the Contractor to avoid significant impacts on the estimated Net Savings or
 the Contractor's Schedule of Work. If the Department determines that the time
 for response is insufficient for review, the Contractor will be so notified.
 B. Conceptual Review and Response The Department will use its best efforts to review
 a Conforming Conceptual VECP and respond to the Contractor within 14 Days of Receipt.
 The Department may, at its sole discretion, (1) invite the Contractor to submit a Detailed
 VECP, (2) reject the Conceptual VECP for reasons that will be described briefly, or (3)
 request additional information. The Department may also, in its sole discretion, agree to
 partially reimburse the Contractor for the costs to develop and submit a Detailed VECP.
 109.6.3 Detailed VECP
 A. Submittal If the Department invites the Contractor to submit a Detailed VECP, it
 shall contain the following information that is sufficient in detail to clearly define and
 explain the proposed change(s):
 1. Updated and more complete information regarding items included in the
 Conceptual VECP, including the general description of the VECP, advantages
 and disadvantages, use, or testing performed, elsewhere, a detailed computation
 
 1-112
 
 of the estimated Net Savings generated in accordance with Section 109.6.4(C) Contract Modification - Amount of Payment, actual VECP development costs to
 date, and estimated savings and schedule impacts including approval date(s)
 required. If the Department determines that the time for response is insufficient
 for review, the Contractor will be notified promptly.
 2. A complete set of Plans and Specifications showing the proposed revisions
 relative to the original Contract features and requirements. All VECP's that
 require engineering design, computations, or analysis shall be prepared under the
 responsible charge of, and sealed by, a Professional Engineer licensed in the State
 of Maine.
 B. Evaluation
 1. Additional Information The Department may request any additional information
 that it determines is necessary to properly evaluate the VECP. Where design
 changes are proposed, such additional information may include results of field
 investigations and surveys, design computations, specifications, and field change
 sheets. The Contractor will promptly provide any such requested information.
 2. Cost Verification The Department may require the Contractor to provide
 additional information to verify the Contractor's cost analyses.
 C. Response The Department will evaluate a Conforming Detailed VECP and provide
 the Contractor with a written response within 14 Days of Receipt of all of the information it
 has determined is necessary to properly evaluate the VECP. Such response will include a
 brief description of the Department’s reason(s) for its decision. The Department, at its sole
 discretion, will either approve the Detailed VECP, approve it with conditions, or reject it.
 The Department may base its decision on any reason that is in the best interest of the
 Department including: (1) unacceptable impact on the function, serviceability, safety,
 durability, maintainability, or aesthetics of the Project, (2) insufficient testing or use of the
 VECP concepts elsewhere, (3) insufficient justification of cost savings, (4) unacceptable
 schedule impacts, (5) insufficient review time, or (6) differing engineering judgment. The
 Contractor may request that the Department reconsider certain portions of the decision. If
 requested, the Department will reconsider its decision and then issue a final decision, which
 is not subject to review or appeal.
 D. Termination of VECP Process If the Department rejects the VECP or the Contractor
 does not desire to proceed with the VECP as approved by the Department, the VECP process
 will terminate and the Department will reimburse the Contractor for 100 percent of all
 VECP development costs incurred by the Contractor to date.
 109.6.4 Contract Modification - Amount of Payment If the VECP is approved, or if it is
 approved with conditions, and the Contractor wants to proceed, a Contract Modification will be
 executed by the parties. In addition to the requirements of Section 109.8 - Contract
 
 1-113
 
 Modifications, the VECP will set forth the net savings generated by the VECP, which shall be
 split equally between the Contractor and the Department, per the following formula:
 NS = EGS - CDC - DVEC
 Where:
 NS =
 
 Net Savings, generated by the VECP, as determined by the Department.
 
 EGS =
 
 Estimated Gross Savings, which is the difference between the cost of
 performing the Work as originally specified in the Contract and the cost
 of performing the Work as revised by the VECP, at agreed upon or lump
 sum prices.
 
 CDC = Contractor’s Development Costs, related to the preparation of the Detailed
 VECP including costs of the Contractor's design subconsultants and
 Subcontractors. The Department shall reimburse the Contractor for these
 costs.
 DVEC = Department's VE Costs, related to review, approval, and implementation
 of the VECP including design costs, field inspection, and the value of any
 Department provided property.
 Once the Contract Modification is executed, the Contractor may be paid for its actual
 Development Costs. The Contractor’s share of the Net Savings shall not be disbursed until the
 work is complete and the actual Net Savings is known.
 The Contract Modification shall also set forth any adjustments to Contract Time related to the
 Work as revised by the VECP, if any.
 109.6.5 Subsequent Payment Adjustments Upon Completion of the portion of the Work
 revised by the VECP, the Department, on its own initiative or upon request by the Contractor,
 may review the actual net savings realized by the VECP. The Contractor will be afforded an
 opportunity to review and comment on such a review. If the actual net savings was greater than
 set forth in the Contract Modification, the increased savings will be shared equally by the
 parties. If the net savings was less than set forth in the Contract Modification, the reduction in
 savings will be borne equally by the parties.
 109.6.6 General Conditions Regarding VECP's
 A. VECP’s will remain the property of the Contractor, provided that the Department
 will have the unrestricted right to use any approved VECP, or any VECP in which
 the Department has reimbursed the Contractor for any portion of the development
 costs, on other MDOT Projects without notice, cost, or liability to the Contractor.
 B. Only the Contractor may submit VECP's. The Contractor shall review, be
 responsible for, and submit all proposals initiated by the Contractor's Subcontractors.
 
 1-114
 
 C. The Contractor shall not anticipate Departmental approval of a VECP when Bidding
 or otherwise before approval of a Detailed VECP. The Contractor is responsible for
 all Delays caused by the VECP that were not negotiated in the Contract
 Modification.
 D. If a VECP is rejected, the Contractor shall perform the Work in accordance with the
 Contract.
 E. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 109.6, the Contractor shall have no
 claim against the Department for additional compensation or time resulting from the
 Delayed review or rejection of a VECP, including, but not limited to, development
 costs, loss of anticipated profits, and increased Material or labor costs.
 F. Cost sharing applies only to the Contract for which the VECP was submitted.
 G. Because the Department has no obligation to change the terms of the original
 Contract, all VECP decisions by the Department are final and are not subject to the
 Dispute resolution provisions provided in this Contract or otherwise available at law.
 109.7 Equitable Adjustments to Compensation and Time
 109.7.1 General Equitable Adjustment means an adjustment to compensation due to a
 change in the nature or scope of Work as defined in this Section 109.
 This Section 109.7 applies to all changes to the nature or scope of the Work excepting (A)
 changes in quantities, which are governed by Section 109.1, (B) elimination of items of Work
 which is governed by Section 109.2, and (C) payment for Value Engineering Change Proposals,
 which is governed by Section 109.6.
 109.7.2 Basis of Payment Adjustments will be established by mutual Agreement based upon
 Unit or Lump Sum Prices which include labor, materials, equipment, mark-up, overhead, profit
 and time. These agreed upon Unit or Lump Sum prices will be full compensation and no
 additional overhead, profit, mark-ups or fees are allowed. If Agreement cannot be reached, the
 Contractor shall accept payment on a Force Account basis as provided in Section 109.7.5 - Force
 Account Work, as full and complete compensation for all Work relating to the Equitable
 Adjustment.
 109.7.3 Reserved
 109.7.4 Non-Compensable Items The Contractor is not entitled to compensation or
 reimbursement for any of the following items:
 A. Lost profits or lost opportunity costs,
 B. Labor inefficiencies,
 
 1-115
 
 C. Consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of bonding capacity, loss of
 Bidding opportunities, and insolvency,
 D. Indirect costs or expenses of any nature,
 E. Dispute resolution costs of any nature including attorney’s fees, claims consultant
 fees, expert witness fees, claims preparation expenses, and costs related to DRB
 proceedings, mediation, arbitration, or litigation, and
 F. Interest.
 109.7.5 Force Account Work Compensation for Force Account Work will be computed
 according to this Section .
 A. Labor The Contractor will receive the actual hourly wages paid to Workers
 actually engaged in the changed Work and the foreman in direct charge of the changed Work
 as determined from certified payrolls, plus 90 percent of the sum thereof for all fringe
 benefits, payroll taxes, overhead, and profit.
 B. Materials For Materials incorporated in the permanent Work, the Contractor will
 receive the Actual Cost of Materials including freight and Delivery charges (but excluding
 any sale or use tax) plus a single 15 percent markup. For all Materials not incorporated in
 the permanent Work, the Contractor will receive the difference of actual value of such
 Material at the time of its use less the fair salvage value of Material when released, plus 15
 percent of said difference. There shall be no markup on markups.
 C. Equipment For all authorized usage of power-operated machinery, trucks, or
 other Equipment, the Contractor will receive the rental rates for the actual time to the nearest
 ¼ hour that such Equipment is in operation on the Work. Time spent moving Equipment
 within the Project Limits and any approved idle time may be measured for payment when
 authorized. Time spent servicing, maintaining, and changing attachments will not be paid
 for. The rental rates shall include the cost of all fuel oil, lubrication, supplies, necessary
 attachments, repairs and maintenance of any kind, depreciation, storage, insurance, small
 tools, and all other Incidentals.
 The maximum Hourly Equipment rental rates (R) will be determined using the most
 current Blue Book rates and the following formula:
 Where:
 
 R=AxBxE+C+D
 A = Blue Book monthly rate divided by 176
 B = Blue Book regional adjustment factor for Maine
 C = Blue Book estimated operating costs per hour
 D = Operator's hourly payroll rate plus 90 percent
 E = Factor from the Rate Adjustment Table for the year the machine was made
 
 1-116
 
 When the Contractor's Equipment is ordered to be available for Force Account Work,
 but is idle for reasons not the fault of the Contractor, standby time will be paid at 70% of the
 hourly Equipment rental rate excluding all operating costs.
 For each piece of Equipment, the Contractor shall provide the following information: the
 manufacturer's name, Equipment type, year of manufacture, model number, type of fuel
 used, horsepower rating, attachments required, together with its size or capacity and any
 further information necessary to ascertain the proper rate. The Contractor shall also provide
 a photocopy of the appropriate pages from the Blue Book that were used to arrive at the rates
 and prepare a chart that fully shows all the details of the Equipment costs.
 Unless otherwise specified, manufacturer's ratings and manufacturer-approved
 modifications will be used to classify Equipment for the determination of applicable rental
 rates. A unit of at least the minimum rating recommended by the manufacturer shall power
 equipment that has no direct power unit.
 If the Department specifies Equipment not listed in the above publication, the
 Department will establish a suitable rate for such Equipment. If requested by the
 Department, the Contractor will produce cost data to assist the Department in the
 establishment of such rental rate, including all records that are relevant to the Actual Costs
 including rental Receipts, acquisition costs, financing documents, lease Agreements, and
 maintenance and operational cost records.
 Equipment leased by the Contractor for Force Account Work and actually used on the
 Project will be paid for at the actual invoice amount plus 10% markup for administrative
 costs.
 D. Superintendence No part of the salary or expense of anyone connected with the
 Contractor above the grade of foreman or having general supervision of the Work will be
 included in the labor items as specified above, except when the Contractor’s entire on-site
 Workforce is occupied with Force Account Work, in which case, the salaries of the
 Superintendent may be included in the labor item specified above when the nature of the
 Work is such that their services are required, as determined by the Department.
 E. Documentation Requirements All Statements shall be accompanied and
 supported by Receipted Invoices for all Materials used and transportation charges. If
 Materials used on the Force Account Work are not specifically purchased for such Work but
 are taken from the Contractor's stock, then instead of Invoices, the Statements shall contain
 or be accompanied by an affidavit of the Contractor certifying that such Materials were taken
 from stock, that the quantity claimed was actually used, and that the price and transportation
 claimed represent the Actual Cost to the Contractor, excluding storage costs.
 No payment will be made for Work performed on a Force Account basis until the
 Contractor has furnished duplicate itemized Statements of the cost of such Force Account
 Work detailed to the following:
 
 1-117
 
 1) Name, classification, date, daily hours, total hours, rate, and amount for each
 foreman and laborer.
 2) Designation, dates, daily hours, total hours, rental rate, and amount for each unit
 of Equipment.
 3) Quantities of Materials, prices, and amounts.
 4) Transportation charges on Materials.
 F. Subcontractor Quoted Work When accomplishing Force Account Work that utilizes
 Subcontractors, the Contractor will be allowed a maximum markup of 5% for profit and

 SECTION 110 - INDEMNIFICATION, BONDING AND INSURANCE
 Scope of Section This Section contains general requirements for indemnification, bonding,

 110.1 Indemnification The Contractor agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the
 Department and its officers, directors, employees, agents and consultants from and against all
 claims, actions, torts, costs, losses, and damages for bodily injury (including sickness, disease,
 or death) and property damage arising out of or relating to this Contract or the performance of
 Work by the Contractor, its Subcontractors, subconsultants, Engineers, suppliers, any

 1-118
 
 including court costs, attorney’s fees, and the fees of Engineers and consultants, arbitrators, and

 This indemnification obligation shall not be limited in any way by any limitation on the
 amount or type of damages, compensation, or benefits payable by or for the Contractor or any
 Subcontractor, subconsultant, Engineer, supplier, or other individual or entity under Workers’
 Compensation acts, disability benefit acts, or other employee benefit acts.
 110.2 Bonding

 Department of the Treasury listing for "Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as
 Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds and as Acceptable Reinsuring Companies".
 The bonds shall each be in the full Contract amount, payable to the “Treasurer - State of
 Maine,” and on the Department's forms, on exact copies thereof, or on forms that do not contain

 Regarding claims related to any obligations covered by these bonds, the Surety shall provide,
 within 60 Days of Receipt of written notice thereof, full payment of the entire claim or written
 notice of all bases upon which it is denying or contesting payment. Failure of the Surety to
 provide such notice within the 60-day period constitutes the Surety’s waiver of any right to deny
 or contest payment and the Surety’s acknowledgment that the claim is valid and undisputed.
 If the Surety becomes financially insolvent or stops operating in the United States, the
 Contractor shall file new bonds complying with this Section within 10 Days of the date the
 Contractor is notified of such change.
 For a related provision, see Section 106.9.4 - Other Warranty Provisions.

 Business Regulation, Bureau of Insurance, and listed on the latest Federal Department of the
 Treasury listing for “Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on
 Federal Bonds and as Acceptable Reinsuring Companies.”
 By issuing a bond, the Surety agrees to be bound by all terms of the Contract, including
 those related to payment, time for performance, quality, warranties, and the Department’s selfhelp remedy provided in Section 112.1 - Default to the same extent as if all terms of the

 Regarding claims related to any obligations covered by the bond, the Surety shall provide,
 within 60 Days of Receipt of written notice thereof, full payment of the entire claim or written
 notice of all bases upon which it is denying or contesting payment. Failure of the Surety to
 provide such notice within the 60-day period constitutes the Surety’s waiver of any right to deny

 provided in Section 109.2 - Elimination of Items, except that there will be no reductions in the
 amount of the credit to the Department. The Contractor shall make all Work records available
 to the Department upon request regarding payment under this Section. All costs and charges

 liable and shall pay to the Department the amount of such excess within 30 Days of the Delivery
 of a Statement setting forth such expenses to the Contractor and the Surety, as applicable.
 If the Contractor files for bankruptcy at any time before expiration of the warranty periods
 provided by this Contract, then the Contractor and its Surety agree, if requested by the
 Department and within 30 Days of such request, to take all actions necessary or convenient to
 reject or accept this Contract under the executory Contract provisions of the federal bankruptcy

 payment under this Section. Acceptable Materials, obtained by the Contractor for the Work but
 which have not been incorporated therein, may at the option of the Department be purchased
 from the Contractor at Actual Cost Delivered to a prescribed location or otherwise disposed of
 as mutually agreed.
 After Receipt of Notice of Termination for Convenience from the Department, the
 Contractor may also submit a claim for additional damages or costs not covered above or
 elsewhere in this Contract to the Project Manager within 60 Days of the effective Termination
 date. Such claim may include such cost items as idle Equipment time, Bidding and Project
 investigative costs, overhead expenses attributable to the Project terminated, legal and
 accounting charges involved in claim preparation, Subcontractor costs not otherwise paid for,
 idle labor cost if Work is stopped in advance of termination date, guaranteed payments for
 private land usage as part of the original Contract, and any other cost or damage item for which
 the Contractor reasonably believes reimbursement should be made. In no event, however, will
 loss of anticipated profits be considered as part of any settlement.
 The Contractor agrees to make the Bid Escrow, Documentation, if any, and its cost records
 available to the extent necessary to determine the validity and amount of each item claimed.
 The Department will respond in writing to such claim within 60 Days of Receipt. If the
 Contractor wants additional consideration, the Contractor must Deliver a written “Notice of

 "Federal Contract Provisions Supplement" including section II - "Nondiscrimination" of the
 “Required Contract Provisions, Federal Aid Construction Contracts”, FHWA-1273.
 
 A-2
 
 B. Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action - Executive Order 11246 Pursuant to
 Executive Order 11246, which was issued by President Johnson in 1965 and amended in 1967
 and 1978, this Contract provides as follows.
 The Contractor shall take specific affirmative actions to ensure equal employment
 opportunity. The evaluation of the Contractor’s compliance with these specifications shall be
 based upon its efforts to achieve maximum results from its actions. The Contractor shall
 document these efforts fully, and shall implement affirmative action steps at least as extensive as
 the following:
 Ensure and maintain a working environment free of harassment, intimidations, and coercion
 at all sites, and in all facilities at which the Contractor’s employees are assigned to work. The
 Contractor, where possible, will assign two or more women to each construction project. The
 Contractor shall specifically ensure that all forepersons, superintendents, and other on-site
 supervisory personnel are aware of and carry out the Contractor’s obligation to maintain such a
 working environment, with specific attention to minority or female individuals working at such
 sites or in such facilities.
 Establish and maintain a current list of minority and female recruitment sources, provide
 written notification to minority and female recruitment sources and to community organizations
 when the Contractor or its union have employment opportunities available, and to maintain a

 female off-the-street applicant and minority or female referral from a union, a recruitment source
 or community organization and of what action was taken with respect to each such individual. If
 such individual was sent to the union hiring hall for referral and was not referred back to the
 Contractor by the union or, if referred, not employed by the Contractor, this shall be documented
 in the file with the reason therefore, along with whatever additional actions the Contractor may
 have taken.
 Provide immediate written notification to the Department’s Civil Rights Office when the
 union or unions with which the Contractor has a collective bargaining agreement has not
 referred to the Contractor a minority person or woman sent by the Contractor, or when the
 Contractor has other information that the union referral process has impeded the DesignBuilder’s efforts to meet its obligations.
 Develop on-the-job training opportunities and/or participate in training programs for the area
 which expressly include minorities and women, including upgrading programs and
 apprenticeship and trainee programs relevant to the Contractor’s employment needs, especially
 those programs funded or approved by the Department of Labor. The Contractor shall provide
 notice of these programs to the sources compiled under B above.
 Disseminate the Contractor’s EEO policy by providing notice of the policy to unions and
 training programs and requesting their cooperation in assisting the Contractor in meeting its
 
 A-3
 
 EEO obligation; by including it in any policy manual and collective bargaining agreement; by
 publicizing it in the company newspaper, annual report, etc.; by specific review of the policy
 with all management personnel and with all minority and female employees at least once a year;
 and by posting the company EEO policy on bulletin boards accessible to all employees at each
 location where construction work is performed.
 Review, at least annually, the company’s EEO policy and affirmative action obligations
 under these specifications with all employees having any responsibility for hiring, assignment,
 layoff, termination, or other employment decisions including specific review of these items with
 on-site supervisory personnel such as Superintendents, General Forepersons, etc., prior to the
 initiation of construction work at any job site. A written record shall be made and maintained
 identifying the time and place of these meetings, persons attending, subject matter discussed,
 and disposition of the subject matter.

 notification to and discussing the Contractor’s EEO policy with other Contractor’s and
 Subcontractors with whom the Contractor does or anticipates doing business.
 Direct its recruitment efforts, both orally and written to minority, female and community
 organizations, to schools with minority and female students and to minority and female
 recruitment and training organizations serving the Contractor’s recruitment area and
 employment needs. Not later that one month prior to the date for the acceptance of applications
 for apprenticeship or other training by any recruitment source, the Contractor shall send written
 notification to organizations such as the above describing the openings, screenings, procedures,
 and test to be used in the selection process.
 Encourage present minority and female employees to recruit other minority persons and
 women and, where reasonable, provide after school, summer and vacation employment to
 minority and female youth, both on the site and in other areas of a Contractor’s workforce.
 Validate all tests and other selection requirements.
 Conduct, at least annually, an inventory and evaluation at least of all minority and female
 personnel for promotional opportunities and encourage these employees to seek or to prepare
 for, through appropriate training, etc., such opportunities.
 Ensure that seniority practices, job classifications, work assignments and other personnel
 practices, do not have a discriminatory effect by continually monitoring all personnel and
 employment related activities to ensure that the EEO policy and the Contractor’s obligations
 under these specifications are being carried out.
 Ensure that all facilities and company activities are non segregated except that separate or
 single-user toilet and necessary changing facilities shall be provided to assure privacy between
 the sexes.
 
 A-4

 and female construction Contractor’s and suppliers, including circulation of solicitations to
 minority and female Contractor associations and other business associations.
 Conduct a review, at least annually, of all supervisors’ adherence to and performance under
 the Contractor’s EEO policies and affirmative action obligations.
 C. Goals for Employment of Women and Minorities Per Executive Order 11246, craft
 tradesperson goals are 6.9% women and .5% minorities employed. However, goals may be
 adjusted upward at the mutual agreement of the Contractor and the Department. Calculation of
 these percentages shall not include On-the-Job Training Program trainees, and shall not include

 and bids on all Federal and federally assisted construction contracts or subcontracts in
 excess of $10,000 to be performed in geographical areas designated by the Director
 pursuant to §60-4.6 of this part (see 41 CFR 60-4.2(a)):
 Notice of Requirement for Affirmative Action to Ensure Equal Opportunity (Executive
 Order 11246)
 1. The Offeror's or bidder's attention is called to the "Equal Opportunity Clause" and the
 "Standard Federal Equal Employment Specifications" set forth herein.
 2. The goals and timetables for minority and female participation, expressed in percentage
 terms for the Contractor's aggregate work force in each trade on all construction work in the
 covered area, are as follows:
 Goals for female participation in each trade
 
 6.9%
 
 Goals for minority participation for each trade
 Maine
 001 Bangor, ME
 0.8%
 Non-SMSA Counties (Aroostook, Hancock, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Waldo, Washington)
 
 A-5
 
 002 Portland-Lewiston, ME
 SMSA Counties: 4243 Lewiston-Auburn, ME

 (Cumberland, Sagadahoc)
 
 0.5%
 0.6%
 
 Non-SMSA Counties:
 0.5%
 (Franklin, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Oxford, Somerset, York)
 These goals are applicable to all the Contractor's construction work (whether or not it is
 Federal or federally assisted) performed in the covered area. If the contractor performs
 construction work in a geographical area located outside of the covered area, it shall apply
 the goals established for such geographical area where the work is actually performed. With
 regard to this second area, the contractor also is subject to the goals for both its federally
 involved and non federally involved construction.
 The contractor's compliance with the Executive Order and the regulations in 41 CFR Part
 60-4 shall be based on its implementation of the Equal Opportunity Clause, specific
 affirmative action obligations required by the specifications set forth in 41 CFR 60-4.3(a),
 and its efforts to meet the goals. The hours of minority and female employment and training
 must be substantially uniform throughout the length of the contract, and in each trade, and
 the contractor shall make a good faith effort to employ minorities and women evenly on each
 of its projects. The transfer of minority or female employees or trainees from Contractor to
 Contractor or from project to project for the sole purpose of meeting the Contractor's goals
 shall be in violation of the contract, the Executive Order and the regulations in 41 CFR Part
 60-4. Compliance with the goals will be measured against the total work hours performed.
 3. The Contractor shall provide written notification to the Director of the Office of Federal
 Contract Compliance Programs within 10 working days of award of any construction
 subcontract in excess of $10,000 at any tier for construction work under the contract
 resulting from this solicitation. The notification shall list the name, address and telephone
 number of the subcontractor, employer identification number of the subcontractor, estimated
 dollar amount of the subcontract; estimated started and completion dates of the subcontract;
 and the geographical area in which the subcontract is to be performed.
 4. As used in this Notice, and in the Contract resulting from this solicitation, the "covered
 area" is (insert description of the geographical areas where the contract is to be performed
 giving the state, county and city, if any).
 STANDARD FEDERAL EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY CONSTRUCTION
 CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS (EXECUTIVE ORDER 11246)
 1. As used in these specifications:
 
 A-6
 
 a. "Covered area" means the geographical area described in the solicitation from which this
 contract resulted;
 b. "Director" means Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, United
 States Department of Labor, or any person to whom the Director delegates authority;
 c. "Employer identification number" means the Federal Social Security number used on the
 Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return, U.S. Treasury Department form 941;
 d. "Minority" includes:
 (i) Black (all persons having origins in any of the Black African racial groups not of
 Hispanic origin);
 (ii) Hispanic (all persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American
 or other Spanish Culture or origin, regardless of race);
 (iii) Asian and Pacific Islander (all persons having origins in any of the original peoples
 of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, or the Pacific Islands); and
 (iv) American Indian or Alaskan Native (all persons having origins in any of the original
 peoples of the North America and maintaining identifiable tribal affiliations through
 membership and participation or community identification).
 2. Whenever the Contractor, or any subcontractor at any tier, subcontracts a portion of the work
 involving any construction trade, it shall physically include in each subcontract in excess of
 $10,000 the provisions of these specifications and the Notice which contains the applicable
 goals for minority and female participation and which is set forth in the solicitations from
 which this contract resulted.
 3. If the contractor, is participating (pursuant to 41 CFR 60-4.5) in a Hometown Plan approved
 by the U.S. Department of Labor in the covered area either individually or through an
 association, its affirmative action obligations on all work in the Plan area (including goals
 and timetables) shall be in accordance with that Plan for those trades which have unions
 participating in the Plan. Contractors must be able to demonstrate their participation in and
 compliance with the provisions of any such Hometown Plan. Each Contractor or
 Subcontractor participating in an approved Plan is individually required to comply with its
 obligations under the EEO clause, and to make a good faith effort to achieve each goal under
 the Plan in each trade in which it has employees. The overall good faith performance by
 other Contractors for Subcontractors toward a goal in an approved Plan does not excuse any
 covered Contractor's or Subcontractor's failure to take good faith efforts to achieve the Plan
 goals and timetables.
 4. The Contractor shall implement the specific affirmative action standards provided in
 paragraphs 7 a. through p. of these specifications. The goals set forth in the solicitation from
 which this contract resulted are expressed as percentages of the total hours of employment
 and training of minority and female utilization the Contractor should reasonably be able to
 achieve in each construction trade in which it has employees in contractors performing
 
 A-7
 
 construction work in geographical areas where they do not have a Federal or federally
 assisted construction contract shall apply the minority and female goals established for the
 geographical areas where the work is being performed. Goals are published periodically in
 the Federal Register in notice form and such notices may be obtained from any Office of
 Federal Contract Compliance Programs office or from Federal procurement contracting
 officers. The Contractor is expected to make substantially uniform progress in meeting its
 goals in each craft during the period specific.
 5. Neither the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement, nor the failure by a union
 with whom the Contractor has a collective bargaining agreement, to refer either minorities or
 women shall excuse the Contractor's obligations under these specifications, Executive Order
 11246, or the regulations promulgated pursuant, thereto.
 6. In order for the non working training hours of apprentices and trainees to be counted in
 meeting the goals, such apprentices and trainees must be employed by the Contractor during
 the training period, and the Contractor must have made a commitment to employ the
 apprentices and trainees at the completion of their training, subject to the availability of
 employment opportunities. Trainees must be trained pursuant to training programs approved
 by the U.S. Department of Labor.
 7. The Contractor shall take specific affirmative actions to ensure equal employment
 opportunity. The evaluation of the Contractor's compliance with these specifications shall
 be based upon its effort to achieve maximum results from its actions. The Contractor shall
 document these efforts fully, and shall implement affirmative action steps at least as
 expensive as the following:
 a. Ensure and maintain a working environment free of harassment, intimidation, coercion at
 all sites, and in all facilities at which the Contractor's employees are assigned to work.
 The Contractor, when possible, will assign two or more women to each construction
 project. The Contractor shall specifically ensure that all foremen, superintendents, and
 other on-site supervisory personnel are aware of and carry out the Contractor's obligation
 to maintain such a working environment, with specific attention to minority or female
 individuals working at such sites or in such facilities.
 b. Establish and maintain a current list of minority and female recruitment sources provide
 written notification to minority and female recruitment sources and to community
 organizations when the Contractor or its unions have employment opportunities
 available, and maintain a record of the organization's responses.
 c. Maintain a current file of the names, addresses and telephone numbers of each minority
 and female off-the-street applicant and minority or female referral from a union, a
 recruitment sources or community organization and of what action was taken with
 respect to each such individual. If such individual was sent to the union hiring hall for
 referral and was not referred back to the Contractor by the union or, if referred, not
 
 A-8
 
 employed by the Contractor, this shall be documented in the file with the reason
 therefore, along with whatever additional actions the Contractor may have taken.
 d. Provide immediate written notification to the Director when the union or unions with
 which the Contractor has a collective bargaining agreement has not referred to the
 Contractor a minority person or woman sent by the Contractor, or when the Contractor
 has other information that the union referral process has impeded the Contractor's efforts
 to meet its obligations.
 e. Develop on-the-job training opportunities and/or participate in training programs for the
 area which expressly include minorities and women, including upgrading programs and
 apprenticeship and trainee programs relevant to the Contractor's employment needs,
 especially those programs funded or approved by the Department of Labor. The
 Contractor shall provide notice of these programs to the sources complied under 7b
 above.
 f. Disseminate the Contractor's EEO policy by providing notice of the policy to unions and
 training programs and requesting their cooperation in assisting the Contractor in meeting
 its EEO obligations; by including in any policy manual and collective bargaining
 agreement; by publicizing it in the company newspaper, annual report, etc.; by specific
 review of the policy with all management personnel and with all minority and female
 employees at least once a year; and by posting the company EEO policy on bulletin
 boards accessible to all employees at each location where construction work is
 performed.
 g. Review, at least annually, the company's EEO policy and affirmative action obligations
 under these specifications with all employees having any responsibility for hiring,
 assignment, layoff, termination or other employment decisions including specific review
 of these items with on-site supervisory personnel such as Superintendents, General
 Foremen, etc., prior to the initiation of construction work at any job site. A written
 record shall be made and maintained identifying the time and place of these meetings,
 persons attending, subject matter discussed, and disposition of the subject matter.
 h. Disseminate the Contractor's EEO policy externally by including it in any advertising in
 the news media, specifically including minority and female news media, and providing
 written notification to and discussing the Contractor's EEO policy with other Contractors
 and Subcontractors with whom the Contractor does or anticipates doing business.
 i. Direct its recruitment, efforts, both oral and written, to minority, female and community
 organizations, to schools with minority and female students and to minority and female
 recruitment and training organizations serving the Contractor's recruitment area and
 employment needs. Not later than one month other training by any recruitment source,
 the Contractor shall send written notification to organizations such as the above,
 describing prior to the date for the acceptance of applications for apprenticeship or the
 openings, screening procedures, and tests to be used in the selection process.
 
 A-9
 
 j. Encourage present minority and female employees to recruit other minority persons and
 women and, where reasonable, provide after school, summer and vacation employment
 to minority and female youth both on site and in other areas of a Contractor's work force.
 k. Validate all tests and other selection requirements where there is an obligation to do so
 under 41 CFR Part 60-3.
 l. Conduct, at least annually, an inventory and evaluation at least of all minority and female
 personnel for promotional opportunities and encourage these employees to seek or to
 prepare for, through appropriate training, etc., such opportunities.
 m. Ensure that seniority practices, job classifications, work assignments and other personnel
 practices, do not have a discriminatory effect by continually monitoring all personnel and
 employment related activities to ensure that the EEO policy and the Contractor's
 obligations under these specifications are being carried out.
 n. Ensure that all facilities and company activities are non segregated except that separate
 or single-user toilet and necessary changing facilities shall be provided to assure privacy
 between the sexes.
 o. Document and maintain a record of all solicitations of offers for subcontracts from
 minority and female construction contractors and suppliers, including circulation of
 solicitation to minority and female contractor associations and other business
 associations.
 p. Conduct a review, at least annually, of all supervisor's adherence to and performance
 under the Contractor's EEO policies and affirmative action obligations.
 8. Contractors are encouraged to participate in voluntary associations which assist in fulfilling
 one or more of their affirmative action obligations (7 a through p.). The efforts of a
 contractor association, joint contractor-union, contractor-community, or other similar group
 of which the contractor is a member and participant, may be asserted as fulfilling any one or
 more of its obligations under 7 a through p. of these specifications provided that the
 contractor actively participates in the group, makes every effort to assure that the group has a
 positive impact on the employment of minorities and women in the industry, ensures that the
 concrete benefits of the program and reflected in the Contractor's minority and female work
 force participation, makes a good faith effort to meet its individual goals and timetables, and
 can provide access to documentation which demonstrates the effectiveness of actions take on
 behalf of the Contractor. The obligation to comply, however, is the Contractor's and failure
 of such a group to fulfill an obligation shall not be a defense for the Contractor's
 noncompliance.
 9. A single goal for minorities and a separate single goal for women have been established.
 The Contractor, however, is required to provide equal employment opportunity and to take
 
 A-10
 
 affirmative action for all minority groups, both make and female, and all women, both
 minority and non-minority. Consequently, the Contractor may be in violation of the
 Executive Order if a particular group is employed in a substantially disparate manner (for
 example, specific minority group of women is underutilized.)
 10. The Contractor shall not use the goals and timetables or affirmative action even through the
 Contractor has achieved its goals for women generally, the Contractor may be in violation of
 the Executive Order if standards to discriminate against any person because of race, color,
 religion, sex, or national origin.
 11. The Contractor shall not enter into any Subcontract with any person or firm debarred from
 Government contracts pursuant to Executive Order 11246.
 12. The Contractor shall carry out such sanctions and penalties for violation of these
 specifications and of the Equal Opportunity Clause, including suspension, termination and
 cancellation of existing subcontracts as may be imposed or ordered pursuant to Executive
 Order 11246, as amended, and its implementation regulations by the Office of Federal
 Contract Compliance Programs. Any Contractor who fails to carry out such sanctions and
 penalties shall be in violation of these specifications and Executive Order 11246, as
 amended.
 13. The Contractor, in fulfilling its obligations under these specifications, shall implement
 specific affirmative action steps, at least as extensive as those standards prescribed in
 paragraph 7 of these specifications, so as to achieve maximum results from its efforts to
 ensure equal employment opportunity. If the Contractor fails to comply with the
 requirements of the Executive Order, the implementing regulations, or these specifications,
 the Director shall proceed in accordance with 41 CFR 60-4.6.
 14. The Contractor shall designate a responsible official to monitor all employment related
 activity to ensure that the company EEO policy is being carried out, to submit reports
 relating to the provisions hereof as may be required by the Government and to keep records.
 Records shall at least include for each employee the name, address, telephone numbers,
 construction trade, union affiliation if any, employee identification number when assigned,
 social security number, race, sex, status (e.g. mechanic, apprentice, trainee, helper, or
 laborer), dates of changes in status, hours worked per week in the indicated trade, rate of
 pay, and location sat which the work was performed. Records be maintained in an easily
 understandable and retrievable form; however, to the degree that existing records satisfy this
 requirement, contractors shall not be required to maintain separate records.
 15. Nothing herein provided shall be construed as a limitation upon the application of other laws
 which establish different standards of compliance or upon the application of requirements
 for the hiring of local or other area residents (e.g., those under the Public Works
 Employment Act of 1977 and the Community Development Block Grant Program).

 D. Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Requirements
 The Department has
 established an annual Disadvantaged Business Enterprise goal to be achieved through race
 neutral means. This goal will be adjusted periodically and will be provided by Supplemental
 Provision. The Contractor shall comply with all provisions of this section regarding DBE
 participation and the Department’s latest version of the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise
 Program Manual, said Manual being incorporated herein by reference. In the case of conflict
 between this Contract and said Manual, this Contract shall control. The Department reserves the
 right to adjust DBE goals on a project-by-project basis by addendum.
 Policy. It is the Department’s policy that DBEs as defined in 23 CFR Part 26 and referenced
 in the Transportation Equity Act for 21st Century of 1998, as amended from the Surface
 Transportation Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987, and the Intermodal Surface
 Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. The intent hereto remains to provide the maximum
 opportunity for DBEs to participate in the performance of contracts financed in whole or in part
 with federal funds.
 The Department and its Contractors shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color,
 national origin, ancestry, sex, age, or disability in the award and performance of DOT assisted
 contracts.
 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises are those so certified by the Maine Department of
 Transportation Civil Rights Office prior to bid opening date.
 The Department has determined that elements of a good faith effort to meet the contract goal
 include but are not limited to the following:
 1. Whether the Contractor advertised in general circulation, trade association, and
 minority/women’s-focus media concerning the subcontracting opportunities;
 2. Whether the Contractor provided written notice to a reasonable number of specific DBEs
 that their interest in the contract is being solicited;
 3. Whether the Contractor followed up on initial solicitations of interest by contacting
 DBEs to determine with certainty whether the DBEs were interested;
 4. Whether the Contractor selected portions of the work to be performed by DBEs in order
 to increase the likelihood of meeting the DBE goals;
 5. Whether the Contractor provided interested DBEs with adequate information about the
 plans, specification and requirements of the contract;
 
 A-12
 
 6. Whether the Contractor negotiated in good faith with interested DBEs, not rejecting the
 DBE as unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their
 capabilities;
 7. Whether the Contractor made efforts to assist interested DBEs with other appropriate
 technical/financial assistance required by the Department or Contractor;
 8. Whether the Contractor effectively used the services of available minority/women’s
 community organizations, minority/women’s business assistance offices; and other
 organizations that provide assistance in the recruitment and placement of DBEs.
 Substitutions of DBEs. The following may be acceptable reasons for Civil Rights Office
 approval of such a change order:
 The DBE defaults, voluntarily removes itself or is over-extended;
 The Department deletes portions of the work to by performed by the DBE.
 It is not intended that the ability to negotiate a more advantageous contract with another
 certified DBE be considered a valid basis for such a change in DBE utilization once the DBE
 Bid Submission review has been passed. Any requests to alter the DBE commitment must be in
 writing and included with the change order.
 Failure to carry out terms of this Standard Specification shall be treated as a violation of this
 contract and will result in contract sanctions which may include withholding of partial payments
 totaling the creditable dollars amount which would have been paid for said DBE participation,
 termination of this contract or other measures which may affect the ability of the Contractor to
 obtain Department contracts.
 Copies of the Maine Department of Transportation’s DBE Program may be obtained from:

 Quarterly Reporting Requirement. The Contractor must submit Semi-annual reports of
 actual dollars paid to Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE's) on this Project to the
 MaineDOT Civil Rights Office by the end of the third week of April and October for the period
 covering the preceding six months considered Federal Fiscal Year periods. The reports will be
 submitted directly to the Civil Rights Office on the form provided in the latest version of the
 DBE Program Manual. Failure to submit the report by the deadline may result in a withholding
 of approval of partial payment estimates by the Department.

 its letterhead to the Department stating the following:
 “This is to certify that products made of steel, iron or the application of any coating to
 products of these materials whose costs are in excess of $2,500.00 or 0.1 percent of
 the original contract amount, whichever is greater, were manufactured and the coating,
 if one was required, was applied in the United States.”
 B. Materials
 a. Convict Produced Materials References: 23 U.S.C. 114(b)(2), 23 CFR 635.417
 Applicability: FHWA's prohibition against the use of convict material only applies to
 Federal-aid highways. Materials produced after July 1, 1991, by convict labor may only be
 incorporated in a Federal-aid highway construction project if: 1) such materials have been
 produced by convicts who are on parole, supervised release, or probation from a prison; or
 
 A-14
 
 2) such material has been produced in a qualified prison facility, e.g., prison industry, with the
 amount produced during any 12-month period, for use in Federal-aid projects, not exceeding the
 amount produced, for such use, during the 12-month period ending July 1, 1987.
 Materials obtained from prison facilities (e.g., prison industries) are subject to the same
 requirements for Federal-aid participation that are imposed upon materials acquired from other
 sources. Materials manufactured or produced by convict labor will be given no preferential
 treatment.
 The preferred method of obtaining materials for a project is through normal contracting
 procedures which require the contractor to furnish all materials to be incorporated in the work.
 The contractor selects the source, public or private, from which the materials are to be obtained
 (23 CFR 635.407). Prison industries are prohibited from bidding on projects directly (23 CFR
 635.112e), but may act as material supplier to construction contractors.
 Prison materials may also be approved as State-furnished material. However, since
 public agencies may not bid in competition with private firms, direct acquisition of materials
 from a prison industry for use as State-furnished material is subject to a public interest finding
 with the Division Administrator's concurrence (23 CFR 635.407d). Selection of materials
 produced by convict labor as State-furnished materials for mandatory use should be cleared prior
 to the submittal of the Plans Specifications & Estimates (PS&E).
 b. Patented/Proprietary Products References: 23 U.S.C. 112, 23 CFR 635.411
 FHWA will not participate, directly or indirectly, in payment for any premium or royalty
 on any patented or proprietary material, specification, or process specifically set forth in the
 plans and specifications for a project, unless:
 the item is purchased or obtained through competitive bidding with equally suitable
 unpatented items,
 the STA certifies either that the proprietary or patented item is essential for
 synchronization with the existing highway facilities or that no equally suitable alternative
 exists, or
 the item is used for research or for a special type of construction on relatively short
 sections of road for experimental purposes. States should follow FHWA's procedures for
 "Construction Projects Incorporating Experimental Features" (expermnt.htm) for the
 submittal of work plans and evaluations.
 The primary purpose of the policy is to have competition in selection of materials and
 allow for development of new materials and products. The policy further permits materials and
 products that are judged equal may be bid under generic specifications. If only patented or
 proprietary products are acceptable, they shall be bid as alternatives with all, or at least a
 reasonable number of, acceptable materials or products listed; and the Division Administrator
 may approve a single source if it can be found that its utilization is in the public interest.
 
 A-15
 
 Trade names are generally the key to identifying patented or proprietary materials. Trade
 name examples include 3M, Corten, etc. Generally, products identified by their brand or trade
 name are not to be specified without an "or equal" phrase, and, if trade names are used, all, or at
 least a reasonable number of acceptable "equal" materials or products should be listed. The
 licensing of several suppliers to produce a product does not change the fact that it is a single
 product and should not be specified to the exclusion of other equally suitable products.
 c. State Preference References: 23 U.S.C. 112, 23 CFR 635.409
 Materials produced within Maine shall not be favored to the exclusion of comparable
 materials produced outside of Maine. State preference clauses give particular advantage to the
 designated source and thus restrict competition. Therefore, State preference provisions shall not
 be used on any Federal-aid construction projects.
 This policy also applies to State preference actions against materials of foreign origin,
 except as otherwise permitted by Federal law. Thus, States cannot give preference to in-State
 material sources over foreign material sources. Under the Buy America provisions, the States are
 permitted to expand the Buy America restrictions provided that the STA is legally authorized
 under State law to impose more stringent requirements.
 d. State Owned/Furnished/Designated Materials References: 23 U.S.C. 112, 23 CFR
 635.407
 Current FHWA policy requires that the contractor must furnish all materials to be
 incorporated in the work, and the contractor shall be permitted to select the sources from which
 the materials are to be obtained. Exceptions to this requirement may be made when there is a
 definite finding, by MaineDOT and concurred in by Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA)
 Division Administrator, that it is in the public interest to require the contractor to use materials
 furnished by the MaineDOT or from sources designated by MaineDOT. The exception policy
 can best be understood by separating State-furnished materials into the categories of
 manufactured materials and local natural materials.
 Manufactured Materials When the use of State-furnished manufactured materials is
 approved based on a public interest finding, such use must be made mandatory. The optional use
 of State-furnished manufactured materials is in violation of our policy prohibiting public
 agencies from competing with private firms. Manufactured materials to be furnished by
 MaineDOT must be acquired through competitive bidding, unless there is a public interest
 finding for another method, and concurred in by FHWA’s Division Administrator.
 Local Natural Materials When MaineDOT owns or controls a local natural materials
 source such as a borrow pit or a stockpile of salvaged pavement material, etc., the materials may
 be designated for either optional or mandatory use; however, mandatory use will require a public
 interest finding (PIF) and FHWA’s Division Administrator's concurrence.
 
 A-16
 
 In order to permit prospective bidders to properly prepare their bids, the location, cost,
 and any conditions to be met for obtaining materials that are made available to the contractor
 shall be stated in the bidding documents.
 Mandatory Disposal Sites Normally, the disposal site for surplus excavated materials is
 to be of the contractor's choosing; although, an optional site(s) may be shown in the contract
 provisions. A mandatory site shall be specified when there is a finding by MaineDOT, with the
 concurrence of the Division Administrator, that such placement is the most economical or that
 the environment would be substantially enhanced without excessive cost. Discussion of the
 mandatory use of a disposal site in the environmental document may serve as the basis for the
 public interest finding.
 Summarizing FHWA policy for the mandatory use of borrow or disposal sites:
 mandatory use of either requires a public interest finding and FHWA’s Division
 Administrator's concurrence,
 mandatory use of either may be based on environmental consideration where the
 environment will be substantially enhanced without excessive additional cost, and
 where the use is based on environmental considerations, the discussion in the
 environmental document may be used as the basis for the public interest finding.
 Factors to justify a public interest finding should include such items as cost effectiveness,
 system integrity, and local shortages of material.
 C. Standard FHWA Contract Provisions - FHWA 1273

 documents, however, the Form FHWA-1273 must be physically incorporated (not referenced) in
 all contracts, subcontracts and lower-tier subcontracts (excluding purchase orders, rental
 agreements and other agreements for supplies or services related to a construction contract).
 
 A-18
 
 2. Subject to the applicability criteria noted in the following sections, these contract provisions
 shall apply to all work performed on the contract by the contractor's own organization and with
 the assistance of workers under the contractor's immediate superintendence and to all work
 performed on the contract by piecework, station work, or by subcontract.
 3. A breach of any of the stipulations contained in these Required Contract Provisions may be
 sufficient grounds for withholding of progress payments, withholding of final payment,
 termination of the contract, suspension / debarment or any other action determined to be
 appropriate by the contracting agency and FHWA.
 4. Selection of Labor: During the performance of this contract, the contractor shall not use
 convict labor for any purpose within the limits of a construction project on a Federal-aid
 highway unless it is labor performed by convicts who are on parole, supervised release, or
 probation. The term Federal-aid highway does not include roadways functionally classified as
 local roads or rural minor collectors.
 II. NONDISCRIMINATION
 The provisions of this section related to 23 CFR Part 230 are applicable to all Federal-aid
 construction contracts and to all related construction subcontracts of $10,000 or more. The
 provisions of 23 CFR Part 230 are not applicable to material supply, engineering, or
 architectural service contracts.
 In addition, the contractor and all subcontractors must comply with the following policies:
 Executive Order 11246, 41 CFR 60, 29 CFR 1625-1627, Title 23 USC Section 140, the
 Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 USC 794), Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
 as amended, and related regulations including 49 CFR Parts 21, 26 and 27; and 23 CFR Parts
 200, 230, and 633.
 The contractor and all subcontractors must comply with: the requirements of the Equal
 Opportunity Clause in 41 CFR 60-1.4(b) and, for all construction contracts exceeding $10,000,
 the Standard Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Construction Contract Specifications in 41
 CFR 60-4.3.
 Note: The U.S. Department of Labor has exclusive authority to determine compliance with
 Executive Order 11246 and the policies of the Secretary of Labor including 41 CFR 60, and 29
 CFR 1625-1627. The contracting agency and the FHWA have the authority and the
 responsibility to ensure compliance with Title 23 USC Section 140, the Rehabilitation Act of
 1973, as amended (29 USC 794), and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and
 related regulations including 49 CFR Parts 21, 26 and 27; and 23 CFR Parts 200, 230, and 633.
 The following provision is adopted from 23 CFR 230, Appendix A, with appropriate revisions
 to conform to the U.S. Department of Labor (US DOL) and FHWA requirements.
 1. Equal Employment Opportunity: Equal employment opportunity (EEO) requirements not
 to discriminate and to take affirmative action to assure equal opportunity as set forth under laws,
 A-19
 
 executive orders, rules, regulations (28 CFR 35, 29 CFR 1630, 29 CFR 1625-1627, 41 CFR 60
 and 49 CFR 27) and orders of the Secretary of Labor as modified by the provisions prescribed
 herein, and imposed pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 140 shall constitute the EEO and specific affirmative
 action standards for the contractor's project activities under this contract. The provisions of the
 Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) set forth under 28 CFR 35
 and 29 CFR 1630 are incorporated by reference in this contract. In the execution of this contract,
 the contractor agrees to comply with the following minimum specific requirement activities of
 EEO:
 a. The contractor will work with the contracting agency and the Federal Government to ensure
 that it has made every good faith effort to provide equal opportunity with respect to all of its
 terms and conditions of employment and in their review of activities under the contract.
 b. The contractor will accept as its operating policy the following statement:
 "It is the policy of this Company to assure that applicants are employed, and that employees
 are treated during employment, without regard to their race, religion, sex, color, national
 origin, age or disability. Such action shall include: employment, upgrading, demotion, or
 transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other
 forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship, preapprenticeship, and/or on-the-job training."
 2. EEO Officer: The contractor will designate and make known to the contracting officers an
 EEO Officer who will have the responsibility for and must be capable of effectively
 administering and promoting an active EEO program and who must be assigned adequate
 authority and responsibility to do so.
 3. Dissemination of Policy: All members of the contractor's staff who are authorized to hire,
 supervise, promote, and discharge employees, or who recommend such action, or who are
 substantially involved in such action, will be made fully cognizant of, and will implement, the
 contractor's EEO policy and contractual responsibilities to provide EEO in each grade and
 classification of employment. To ensure that the above agreement will be met, the following
 actions will be taken as a minimum:
 a. Periodic meetings of supervisory and personnel office employees will be conducted before
 the start of work and then not less often than once every six months, at which time the
 contractor's EEO policy and its implementation will be reviewed and explained. The meetings
 will be conducted by the EEO Officer.
 b. All new supervisory or personnel office employees will be given a thorough indoctrination
 by the EEO Officer, covering all major aspects of the contractor's EEO obligations within thirty
 days following their reporting for duty with the contractor.
 c. All personnel who are engaged in direct recruitment for the project will be instructed by the
 EEO Officer in the contractor's procedures for locating and hiring minorities and women.
 
 A-20
 
 d. Notices and posters setting forth the contractor's EEO policy will be placed in areas readily
 accessible to employees, applicants for employment and potential employees.
 e. The contractor's EEO policy and the procedures to implement such policy will be brought to
 the attention of employees by means of meetings, employee handbooks, or other appropriate
 means.
 4. Recruitment: When advertising for employees, the contractor will include in all
 advertisements for employees the notation: "An Equal Opportunity Employer." All such
 advertisements will be placed in publications having a large circulation among minorities and
 women in the area from which the project work force would normally be derived.
 a. The contractor will, unless precluded by a valid bargaining agreement, conduct systematic
 and direct recruitment through public and private employee referral sources likely to yield
 qualified minorities and women. To meet this requirement, the contractor will identify sources
 of potential minority group employees, and establish with such identified sources procedures
 whereby minority and women applicants may be referred to the contractor for employment
 consideration.
 b. In the event the contractor has a valid bargaining agreement providing for exclusive hiring
 hall referrals, the contractor is expected to observe the provisions of that agreement to the extent
 that the system meets the contractor's compliance with EEO contract provisions. Where
 implementation of such an agreement has the effect of discriminating against minorities or
 women, or obligates the contractor to do the same, such implementation violates Federal
 nondiscrimination provisions.
 c. The contractor will encourage its present employees to refer minorities and women as
 applicants for employment. Information and procedures with regard to referring such applicants
 will be discussed with employees.
 5. Personnel Actions: Wages, working conditions, and employee benefits shall be established
 and administered, and personnel actions of every type, including hiring, upgrading, promotion,
 transfer, demotion, layoff, and termination, shall be taken without regard to race, color, religion,
 sex, national origin, age or disability. The following procedures shall be followed:
 a. The contractor will conduct periodic inspections of project sites to insure that working
 conditions and employee facilities do not indicate discriminatory treatment of project site
 personnel.
 b. The contractor will periodically evaluate the spread of wages paid within each classification
 to determine any evidence of discriminatory wage practices.
 c. The contractor will periodically review selected personnel actions in depth to determine
 whether there is evidence of discrimination. Where evidence is found, the contractor will
 
 A-21
 
 promptly take corrective action. If the review indicates that the discrimination may extend
 beyond the actions reviewed, such corrective action shall include all affected persons.
 d. The contractor will promptly investigate all complaints of alleged discrimination made to
 the contractor in connection with its obligations under this contract, will attempt to resolve such
 complaints, and will take appropriate corrective action within a reasonable time. If the
 investigation indicates that the discrimination may affect persons other than the complainant,
 such corrective action shall include such other persons. Upon completion of each investigation,
 the contractor will inform every complainant of all of their avenues of appeal.
 6. Training and Promotion:
 a. The contractor will assist in locating, qualifying, and increasing the skills of minorities and
 women who are applicants for employment or current employees. Such efforts should be aimed
 at developing full journey level status employees in the type of trade or job classification
 involved.
 b. Consistent with the contractor's work force requirements and as permissible under Federal
 and State regulations, the contractor shall make full use of training programs, i.e.,
 apprenticeship, and on-the-job training programs for the geographical area of contract
 performance. In the event a special provision for training is provided under this contract, this
 subparagraph will be superseded as indicated in the special provision. The contracting agency
 may reserve training positions for persons who receive welfare assistance in accordance with 23
 U.S.C. 140(a).
 c. The contractor will advise employees and applicants for employment of available training
 programs and entrance requirements for each.
 d. The contractor will periodically review the training and promotion potential of employees
 who are minorities and women and will encourage eligible employees to apply for such training
 and promotion.
 7. Unions: If the contractor relies in whole or in part upon unions as a source of employees, the
 contractor will use good faith efforts to obtain the cooperation of such unions to increase
 opportunities for minorities and women. Actions by the contractor, either directly or through a
 contractor's association acting as agent, will include the procedures set forth below:
 a. The contractor will use good faith efforts to develop, in cooperation with the unions, joint
 training programs aimed toward qualifying more minorities and women for membership in the
 unions and increasing the skills of minorities and women so that they may qualify for higher
 paying employment.
 b. The contractor will use good faith efforts to incorporate an EEO clause into each union
 agreement to the end that such union will be contractually bound to refer applicants without
 regard to their race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disability.
 
 A-22
 
 c. The contractor is to obtain information as to the referral practices and policies of the labor
 union except that to the extent such information is within the exclusive possession of the labor
 union and such labor union refuses to furnish such information to the contractor, the contractor
 shall so certify to the contracting agency and shall set forth what efforts have been made to
 obtain such information.
 d. In the event the union is unable to provide the contractor with a reasonable flow of referrals
 within the time limit set forth in the collective bargaining agreement, the contractor will, through
 independent recruitment efforts, fill the employment vacancies without regard to race, color,
 religion, sex, national origin, age or disability; making full efforts to obtain qualified and/or
 qualifiable minorities and women. The failure of a union to provide sufficient referrals (even
 though it is obligated to provide exclusive referrals under the terms of a collective bargaining
 agreement) does not relieve the contractor from the requirements of this paragraph. In the event
 the union referral practice prevents the contractor from meeting the obligations pursuant to
 Executive Order 11246, as amended, and these special provisions, such contractor shall
 immediately notify the contracting agency.
 8. Reasonable Accommodation for Applicants / Employees with Disabilities: The
 contractor must be familiar with the requirements for and comply with the Americans with
 Disabilities Act and all rules and regulations established there under. Employers must provide
 reasonable accommodation in all employment activities unless to do so would cause an undue
 hardship.
 9. Selection of Subcontractors, Procurement of Materials and Leasing of Equipment: The
 contractor shall not discriminate on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age
 or disability in the selection and retention of subcontractors, including procurement of materials
 and leases of equipment. The contractor shall take all necessary and reasonable steps to ensure
 nondiscrimination in the administration of this contract.
 a. The contractor shall notify all potential subcontractors and suppliers and lessors of their
 EEO obligations under this contract.
 b. The contractor will use good faith efforts to ensure subcontractor compliance with their
 EEO obligations.
 
 10. Assurance Required by 49 CFR 26.13(b):
 a.
 The requirements of 49 CFR Part 26 and the State DOT’s U.S. DOT-approved DBE
 program are incorporated by reference.
 b.
 The contractor or subcontractor shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national
 origin, or sex in the performance of this contract. The contractor shall carry out applicable
 requirements of 49 CFR Part 26 in the award and administration of DOT-assisted contracts.
 
 A-23
 
 Failure by the contractor to carry out these requirements is a material breach of this contract,
 which may result in the termination of this contract or such other remedy as the contracting
 agency deems appropriate.
 11. Records and Reports: The contractor shall keep such records as necessary to document
 compliance with the EEO requirements. Such records shall be retained for a period of three
 years following the date of the final payment to the contractor for all contract work and shall be
 available at reasonable times and places for inspection by authorized representatives of the
 contracting agency and the FHWA.
 a. The records kept by the contractor shall document the following:
 (1) The number and work hours of minority and non-minority group members and women
 employed in each work classification on the project;
 (2) The progress and efforts being made in cooperation with unions, when applicable, to
 increase employment opportunities for minorities and women; and
 (3) The progress and efforts being made in locating, hiring, training, qualifying, and
 upgrading minorities and women;
 b. The contractors and subcontractors will submit an annual report to the contracting agency
 each July for the duration of the project, indicating the number of minority, women, and nonminority group employees currently engaged in each work classification required by the contract
 work. This information is to be reported on Form FHWA-1391. The staffing data should
 represent the project work force on board in all or any part of the last payroll period preceding
 the end of July. If on-the-job training is being required by special provision, the contractor will
 be required to collect and report training data. The employment data should reflect the work
 force on board during all or any part of the last payroll period preceding the end of July.
 III. NONSEGREGATED FACILITIES
 This provision is applicable to all Federal-aid construction contracts and to all related
 construction subcontracts of $10,000 or more.
 The contractor must ensure that facilities provided for employees are provided in such a manner
 that segregation on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin cannot result. The
 contractor may neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such
 use by employee custom. The contractor's obligation extends further to ensure that its
 employees are not assigned to perform their services at any location, under the contractor's
 control, where the facilities are segregated. The term "facilities" includes waiting rooms, work
 areas, restaurants and other eating areas, time clocks, restrooms, washrooms, locker rooms, and
 other storage or dressing areas, parking lots, drinking fountains, recreation or entertainment
 areas, transportation, and housing provided for employees. The contractor shall provide separate
 or single-user restrooms and necessary dressing or sleeping areas to assure privacy between
 sexes.
 A-24
 
 IV. DAVIS-BACON AND RELATED ACT PROVISIONS
 This section is applicable to all Federal-aid construction projects exceeding $2,000 and to all
 related subcontracts and lower-tier subcontracts (regardless of subcontract size). The
 requirements apply to all projects located within the right-of-way of a roadway that is
 functionally classified as Federal-aid highway. This excludes roadways functionally classified
 as local roads or rural minor collectors, which are exempt. Contracting agencies may elect to
 apply these requirements to other projects.
 The following provisions are from the U.S. Department of Labor regulations in 29 CFR 5.5
 “Contract provisions and related matters” with minor revisions to conform to the FHWA-1273
 format and FHWA program requirements.
 1. Minimum wages
 a. All laborers and mechanics employed or working upon the site of the work, will be paid
 unconditionally and not less often than once a week, and without subsequent deduction or rebate
 on any account (except such payroll deductions as are permitted by regulations issued by the
 Secretary of Labor under the Copeland Act (29 CFR part 3)), the full amount of wages and bona
 fide fringe benefits (or cash equivalents thereof) due at time of payment computed at rates not
 less than those contained in the wage determination of the Secretary of Labor which is attached
 hereto and made a part hereof, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged
 to exist between the contractor and such laborers and mechanics.
 Contributions made or costs reasonably anticipated for bona fide fringe benefits under section
 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act on behalf of laborers or mechanics are considered wages paid to
 such laborers or mechanics, subject to the provisions of paragraph 1.d. of this section; also,
 regular contributions made or costs incurred for more than a weekly period (but not less often
 than quarterly) under plans, funds, or programs which cover the particular weekly period, are
 deemed to be constructively made or incurred during such weekly period. Such laborers and
 mechanics shall be paid the appropriate wage rate and fringe benefits on the wage determination
 for the classification of work actually performed, without regard to skill, except as provided in
 29 CFR 5.5(a)(4). Laborers or mechanics performing work in more than one classification may
 be compensated at the rate specified for each classification for the time actually worked therein:
 Provided, That the employer's payroll records accurately set forth the time spent in each
 classification in which work is performed. The wage determination (including any additional
 classification and wage rates conformed under paragraph 1.b. of this section) and the DavisBacon poster (WH–1321) shall be posted at all times by the contractor and its subcontractors at
 the site of the work in a prominent and accessible place where it can be easily seen by the
 workers.
 b. (1) The contracting officer shall require that any class of laborers or mechanics, including
 helpers, which is not listed in the wage determination and which is to be employed under the
 contract shall be classified in conformance with the wage determination. The contracting officer
 shall approve an additional classification and wage rate and fringe benefits therefore only when
 the following criteria have been met:
 
 A-25
 
 (i) The work to be performed by the classification requested is not performed by a
 classification in the wage determination; and
 (ii) The classification is utilized in the area by the construction industry; and
 (iii) The proposed wage rate, including any bona fide fringe benefits, bears a reasonable
 relationship to the wage rates contained in the wage determination.
 (2) If the contractor and the laborers and mechanics to be employed in the classification (if
 known), or their representatives, and the contracting officer agree on the classification and
 wage rate (including the amount designated for fringe benefits where appropriate), a report of
 the action taken shall be sent by the contracting officer to the Administrator of the Wage and
 Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
 Washington, DC 20210. The Administrator, or an authorized representative, will approve,
 modify, or disapprove every additional classification action within 30 days of receipt and so
 advise the contracting officer or will notify the contracting officer within the 30-day period that
 additional time is necessary.
 (3) In the event the contractor, the laborers or mechanics to be employed in the classification
 or their representatives, and the contracting officer do not agree on the proposed classification
 and wage rate (including the amount designated for fringe benefits, where appropriate), the
 contracting officer shall refer the questions, including the views of all interested parties and the
 recommendation of the contracting officer, to the Wage and Hour Administrator for
 determination. The Wage and Hour Administrator, or an authorized representative, will issue a
 determination within 30 days of receipt and so advise the contracting officer or will notify the
 contracting officer within the 30-day period that additional time is necessary.
 (4) The wage rate (including fringe benefits where appropriate) determined pursuant to
 paragraphs 1.b.(2) or 1.b.(3) of this section, shall be paid to all workers performing work in the
 classification under this contract from the first day on which work is performed in the
 classification.
 c. Whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the contract for a class of laborers or
 mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not expressed as an hourly rate, the contractor shall
 either pay the benefit as stated in the wage determination or shall pay another bona fide fringe
 benefit or an hourly cash equivalent thereof.
 d. If the contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other third person, the contractor
 may consider as part of the wages of any laborer or mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably
 anticipated in providing bona fide fringe benefits under a plan or program, Provided, That the
 Secretary of Labor has found, upon the written request of the contractor, that the applicable
 standards of the Davis-Bacon Act have been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the
 contractor to set aside in a separate account assets for the meeting of obligations under the plan
 or program.
 
 A-26
 
 2. Withholding
 The contracting agency shall upon its own action or upon written request of an authorized
 representative of the Department of Labor, withhold or cause to be withheld from the contractor
 under this contract, or any other Federal contract with the same prime contractor, or any other
 federally-assisted contract subject to Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements, which is held
 by the same prime contractor, so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be
 considered necessary to pay laborers and mechanics, including apprentices, trainees, and helpers,
 employed by the contractor or any subcontractor the full amount of wages required by the
 contract. In the event of failure to pay any laborer or mechanic, including any apprentice,
 trainee, or helper, employed or working on the site of the work, all or part of the wages required
 by the contract, the contracting agency may, after written notice to the contractor, take such
 action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment, advance, or
 guarantee of funds until such violations have ceased.
 3. Payrolls and basic records
 a. Payrolls and basic records relating thereto shall be maintained by the contractor during the
 course of the work and preserved for a period of three years thereafter for all laborers and
 mechanics working at the site of the work. Such records shall contain the name, address, and
 social security number of each such worker, his or her correct classification, hourly rates of
 wages paid (including rates of contributions or costs anticipated for bona fide fringe benefits or
 cash equivalents thereof of the types described in section 1(b)(2)(B) of the Davis-Bacon Act),
 daily and weekly number of hours worked, deductions made and actual wages paid. Whenever
 the Secretary of Labor has found under 29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(iv) that the wages of any laborer or
 mechanic include the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a
 plan or program described in section 1(b)(2)(B) of the Davis-Bacon Act, the contractor shall
 maintain records which show that the commitment to provide such benefits is enforceable, that
 the plan or program is financially responsible, and that the plan or program has been
 communicated in writing to the laborers or mechanics affected, and records which show the
 costs anticipated or the actual cost incurred in providing such benefits. Contractors employing
 apprentices or trainees under approved programs shall maintain written evidence of the
 registration of apprenticeship programs and certification of trainee programs, the registration of
 the apprentices and trainees, and the ratios and wage rates prescribed in the applicable programs.
 b. (1) The contractor shall submit weekly for each week in which any contract work is
 performed a copy of all payrolls to the contracting agency. The payrolls submitted shall set out
 accurately and completely all of the information required to be maintained under 29 CFR
 5.5(a)(3)(i), except that full social security numbers and home addresses shall not be included on
 weekly transmittals. Instead the payrolls shall only need to include an individually identifying
 number for each employee ( e.g. , the last four digits of the employee's social security number).
 The required weekly payroll information may be submitted in any form desired. Optional Form
 WH–347 is available for this purpose from the Wage and Hour Division Web site at
 http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/forms/wh347instr.htm or its successor site. The prime contractor is
 responsible for the submission of copies of payrolls by all subcontractors. Contractors and
 subcontractors shall maintain the full social security number and current address of each covered
 
 A-27
 
 worker, and shall provide them upon request to the contracting agency for transmission to the
 State DOT, the FHWA or the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor for purposes
 of an investigation or audit of compliance with prevailing wage requirements. It is not a
 violation of this section for a prime contractor to require a subcontractor to provide addresses
 and social security numbers to the prime contractor for its own records, without weekly
 submission to the contracting agency..
 (2) Each payroll submitted shall be accompanied by a “Statement of Compliance,” signed by the
 contractor or subcontractor or his or her agent who pays or supervises the payment of the
 persons employed under the contract and shall certify the following:
 (i) That the payroll for the payroll period contains the information required to be provided
 under §5.5 (a)(3)(ii) of Regulations, 29 CFR part 5, the appropriate information is being
 maintained under §5.5 (a)(3)(i) of Regulations, 29 CFR part 5, and that such information is
 correct and complete;
 (ii) That each laborer or mechanic (including each helper, apprentice, and trainee) employed
 on the contract during the payroll period has been paid the full weekly wages earned, without
 rebate, either directly or indirectly, and that no deductions have been made either directly or
 indirectly from the full wages earned, other than permissible deductions as set forth in
 Regulations, 29 CFR part 3;
 (iii) That each laborer or mechanic has been paid not less than the applicable wage rates and
 fringe benefits or cash equivalents for the classification of work performed, as specified in
 the applicable wage determination incorporated into the contract.
 (3) The weekly submission of a properly executed certification set forth on the reverse side of
 Optional Form WH–347 shall satisfy the requirement for submission of the “Statement of
 Compliance” required by paragraph 3.b.(2) of this section.
 (4) The falsification of any of the above certifications may subject the contractor or
 subcontractor to civil or criminal prosecution under section 1001 of title 18 and section 231 of
 title 31 of the United States Code.
 c. The contractor or subcontractor shall make the records required under paragraph 3.a. of this
 section available for inspection, copying, or transcription by authorized representatives of the
 contracting agency, the State DOT, the FHWA, or the Department of Labor, and shall permit
 such representatives to interview employees during working hours on the job. If the contractor
 or subcontractor fails to submit the required records or to make them available, the FHWA may,
 after written notice to the contractor, the contracting agency or the State DOT, take such action
 as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment, advance, or guarantee of
 funds. Furthermore, failure to submit the required records upon request or to make such records
 available may be grounds for debarment action pursuant to 29 CFR 5.12.
 4. Apprentices and trainees
 a. Apprentices (programs of the USDOL).
 
 A-28
 
 Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they
 performed when they are employed pursuant to and individually registered in a bona fide
 apprenticeship program registered with the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and
 Training Administration, Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer and Labor Services, or
 with a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the Office, or if a person is employed in his
 or her first 90 days of probationary employment as an apprentice in such an apprenticeship
 program, who is not individually registered in the program, but who has been certified by the
 Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer and Labor Services or a State Apprenticeship
 Agency (where appropriate) to be eligible for probationary employment as an apprentice.
 The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen on the job site in any craft classification shall
 not be greater than the ratio permitted to the contractor as to the entire work force under the
 registered program. Any worker listed on a payroll at an apprentice wage rate, who is not
 registered or otherwise employed as stated above, shall be paid not less than the applicable wage
 rate on the wage determination for the classification of work actually performed. In addition, any
 apprentice performing work on the job site in excess of the ratio permitted under the registered
 program shall be paid not less than the applicable wage rate on the wage determination for the
 work actually performed. Where a contractor is performing construction on a project in a
 locality other than that in which its program is registered, the ratios and wage rates (expressed in
 percentages of the journeyman's hourly rate) specified in the contractor's or subcontractor's
 registered program shall be observed.
 Every apprentice must be paid at not less than the rate specified in the registered program for
 the apprentice's level of progress, expressed as a percentage of the journeymen hourly rate
 specified in the applicable wage determination. Apprentices shall be paid fringe benefits in
 accordance with the provisions of the apprenticeship program. If the apprenticeship program
 does not specify fringe benefits, apprentices must be paid the full amount of fringe benefits
 listed on the wage determination for the applicable classification. If the Administrator
 determines that a different practice prevails for the applicable apprentice classification, fringes
 shall be paid in accordance with that determination.
 In the event the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer and Labor Services, or a State
 Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the Office, withdraws approval of an apprenticeship
 program, the contractor will no longer be permitted to utilize apprentices at less than the
 applicable predetermined rate for the work performed until an acceptable program is approved.
 b. Trainees (programs of the USDOL).
 Except as provided in 29 CFR 5.16, trainees will not be permitted to work at less than the
 predetermined rate for the work performed unless they are employed pursuant to and
 individually registered in a program which has received prior approval, evidenced by formal
 certification by the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration.
 The ratio of trainees to journeymen on the job site shall not be greater than permitted under the
 plan approved by the Employment and Training Administration.
 
 A-29
 
 Every trainee must be paid at not less than the rate specified in the approved program for the
 trainee's level of progress, expressed as a percentage of the journeyman hourly rate specified in
 the applicable wage determination. Trainees shall be paid fringe benefits in accordance with the
 provisions of the trainee program. If the trainee program does not mention fringe benefits,
 trainees shall be paid the full amount of fringe benefits listed on the wage determination unless
 the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division determines that there is an apprenticeship
 program associated with the corresponding journeyman wage rate on the wage determination
 which provides for less than full fringe benefits for apprentices. Any employee listed on the
 payroll at a trainee rate who is not registered and participating in a training plan approved by the
 Employment and Training Administration shall be paid not less than the applicable wage rate on
 the wage determination for the classification of work actually performed. In addition, any trainee
 performing work on the job site in excess of the ratio permitted under the registered program
 shall be paid not less than the applicable wage rate on the wage determination for the work
 actually performed.
 In the event the Employment and Training Administration withdraws approval of a training
 program, the contractor will no longer be permitted to utilize trainees at less than the applicable
 predetermined rate for the work performed until an acceptable program is approved.
 c. Equal employment opportunity. The utilization of apprentices, trainees and journeymen
 under this part shall be in conformity with the equal employment opportunity requirements of
 Executive Order 11246, as amended, and 29 CFR part 30.
 d. Apprentices and Trainees (programs of the U.S. DOT).
 Apprentices and trainees working under apprenticeship and skill training programs which have
 been certified by the Secretary of Transportation as promoting EEO in connection with Federalaid highway construction programs are not subject to the requirements of paragraph 4 of this
 Section IV. The straight time hourly wage rates for apprentices and trainees under such
 programs will be established by the particular programs. The ratio of apprentices and trainees to
 journeymen shall not be greater than permitted by the terms of the particular program.
 5. Compliance with Copeland Act requirements. The contractor shall comply with the
 requirements of 29 CFR part 3, which are incorporated by reference in this contract.
 6. Subcontracts. The contractor or subcontractor shall insert Form FHWA-1273 in any
 subcontracts and also require the subcontractors to include Form FHWA-1273 in any lower tier
 subcontracts. The prime contractor shall be responsible for the compliance by any subcontractor
 or lower tier subcontractor with all the contract clauses in 29 CFR 5.5.
 7. Contract termination: debarment. A breach of the contract clauses in 29 CFR 5.5 may be
 grounds for termination of the contract, and for debarment as a contractor and a subcontractor as
 provided in 29 CFR 5.12.
 8. Compliance with Davis-Bacon and Related Act requirements. All rulings and
 interpretations of the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts contained in 29 CFR parts 1, 3, and 5 are
 herein incorporated by reference in this contract.
 
 A-30
 
 9. Disputes concerning labor standards. Disputes arising out of the labor standards provisions
 of this contract shall not be subject to the general disputes clause of this contract. Such disputes
 shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures of the Department of Labor set forth in 29
 CFR parts 5, 6, and 7. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between the
 contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of
 Labor, or the employees or their representatives.
 10. Certification of eligibility.
 a. By entering into this contract, the contractor certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any
 person or firm who has an interest in the contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be
 awarded Government contracts by virtue of section 3(a) of the Davis-Bacon Act or 29 CFR
 5.12(a)(1).
 b. No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a
 Government contract by virtue of section 3(a) of the Davis-Bacon Act or 29 CFR 5.12(a)(1).
 c. The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.
 1001.
 V. CONTRACT WORK HOURS AND SAFETY STANDARDS ACT
 The following clauses apply to any Federal-aid construction contract in an amount in excess of
 $100,000 and subject to the overtime provisions of the Contract Work Hours and Safety
 Standards Act. These clauses shall be inserted in addition to the clauses required by 29 CFR
 5.5(a) or 29 CFR 4.6. As used in this paragraph, the terms laborers and mechanics include
 watchmen and guards.
 1. Overtime requirements. No contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the
 contract work which may require or involve the employment of laborers or mechanics shall
 require or permit any such laborer or mechanic in any workweek in which he or she is employed
 on such work to work in excess of forty hours in such workweek unless such laborer or
 mechanic receives compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half times the basic rate of
 pay for all hours worked in excess of forty hours in such workweek.
 2. Violation; liability for unpaid wages; liquidated damages. In the event of any violation of
 the clause set forth in paragraph (1.) of this section, the contractor and any subcontractor
 responsible therefor shall be liable for the unpaid wages. In addition, such contractor and
 subcontractor shall be liable to the United States (in the case of work done under contract for the
 District of Columbia or a territory, to such District or to such territory), for liquidated damages.
 Such liquidated damages shall be computed with respect to each individual laborer or mechanic,
 including watchmen and guards, employed in violation of the clause set forth in paragraph (1.)
 of this section, in the sum of $10 for each calendar day on which such individual was required or
 permitted to work in excess of the standard workweek of forty hours without payment of the
 overtime wages required by the clause set forth in paragraph (1.) of this section.
 3. Withholding for unpaid wages and liquidated damages. The FHWA or the contacting
 agency shall upon its own action or upon written request of an authorized representative of the
 A-31
 
 Department of Labor withhold or cause to be withheld, from any moneys payable on account of
 work performed by the contractor or subcontractor under any such contract or any other Federal
 contract with the same prime contractor, or any other federally-assisted contract subject to the
 Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, which is held by the same prime contractor,
 such sums as may be determined to be necessary to satisfy any liabilities of such contractor or
 subcontractor for unpaid wages and liquidated damages as provided in the clause set forth in
 paragraph (2.) of this section.
 4. Subcontracts. The contractor or subcontractor shall insert in any subcontracts the clauses set
 forth in paragraph (1.) through (4.) of this section and also a clause requiring the subcontractors
 to include these clauses in any lower tier subcontracts. The prime contractor shall be responsible
 for compliance by any subcontractor or lower tier subcontractor with the clauses set forth in
 paragraphs (1.) through (4.) of this section.
 VI. SUBLETTING OR ASSIGNING THE CONTRACT
 This provision is applicable to all Federal-aid construction contracts on the National Highway
 System.
 1. The contractor shall perform with its own organization contract work amounting to not less
 than 30 percent (or a greater percentage if specified elsewhere in the contract) of the total
 original contract price, excluding any specialty items designated by the contracting agency.
 Specialty items may be performed by subcontract and the amount of any such specialty items
 performed may be deducted from the total original contract price before computing the amount
 of work required to be performed by the contractor's own organization (23 CFR 635.116).
 a. The term “perform work with its own organization” refers to workers employed or leased by
 the prime contractor, and equipment owned or rented by the prime contractor, with or without
 operators. Such term does not include employees or equipment of a subcontractor or lower tier
 subcontractor, agents of the prime contractor, or any other assignees. The term may include
 payments for the costs of hiring leased employees from an employee leasing firm meeting all
 relevant Federal and State regulatory requirements. Leased employees may only be included in
 this term if the prime contractor meets all of the following conditions:
 (1) the prime contractor maintains control over the supervision of the day-to-day
 activities of the leased employees;
 (2) the prime contractor remains responsible for the quality of the work of the leased
 employees;
 (3) the prime contractor retains all power to accept or exclude individual employees from
 work on the project; and
 (4) the prime contractor remains ultimately responsible for the payment of predetermined
 minimum wages, the submission of payrolls, statements of compliance and all other Federal
 regulatory requirements.
 b. "Specialty Items" shall be construed to be limited to work that requires highly specialized
 knowledge, abilities, or equipment not ordinarily available in the type of contracting
 A-32
 
 organizations qualified and expected to bid or propose on the contract as a whole and in general
 are to be limited to minor components of the overall contract.
 2. The contract amount upon which the requirements set forth in paragraph (1) of Section VI is
 computed includes the cost of material and manufactured products which are to be purchased or
 produced by the contractor under the contract provisions.
 3. The contractor shall furnish (a) a competent superintendent or supervisor who is employed by
 the firm, has full authority to direct performance of the work in accordance with the contract
 requirements, and is in charge of all construction operations (regardless of who performs the
 work) and (b) such other of its own organizational resources (supervision, management, and
 engineering services) as the contracting officer determines is necessary to assure the
 performance of the contract.
 4. No portion of the contract shall be sublet, assigned or otherwise disposed of except with the
 written consent of the contracting officer, or authorized representative, and such consent when
 given shall not be construed to relieve the contractor of any responsibility for the fulfillment of
 the contract. Written consent will be given only after the contracting agency has assured that
 each subcontract is evidenced in writing and that it contains all pertinent provisions and
 requirements of the prime contract.
 5. The 30% self-performance requirement of paragraph (1) is not applicable to design-build
 contracts; however, contracting agencies may establish their own self-performance
 requirements.
 VII. SAFETY: ACCIDENT PREVENTION
 This provision is applicable to all Federal-aid construction contracts and to all related
 subcontracts.
 1. In the performance of this contract the contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal,
 State, and local laws governing safety, health, and sanitation (23 CFR 635). The contractor shall
 provide all safeguards, safety devices and protective equipment and take any other needed
 actions as it determines, or as the contracting officer may determine, to be reasonably necessary
 to protect the life and health of employees on the job and the safety of the public and to protect
 property in connection with the performance of the work covered by the contract.
 2. It is a condition of this contract, and shall be made a condition of each subcontract, which the
 contractor enters into pursuant to this contract, that the contractor and any subcontractor shall
 not permit any employee, in performance of the contract, to work in surroundings or under
 conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous to his/her health or safety, as
 determined under construction safety and health standards (29 CFR 1926) promulgated by the
 Secretary of Labor, in accordance with Section 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety
 Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 3704).
 
 A-33
 
 3. Pursuant to 29 CFR 1926.3, it is a condition of this contract that the Secretary of Labor or
 authorized representative thereof, shall have right of entry to any site of contract performance to
 inspect or investigate the matter of compliance with the construction safety and health standards
 and to carry out the duties of the Secretary under Section 107 of the Contract Work Hours and
 Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C.3704).
 VIII. FALSE STATEMENTS CONCERNING HIGHWAY PROJECTS
 This provision is applicable to all Federal-aid construction contracts and to all related
 subcontracts.
 In order to assure high quality and durable construction in conformity with approved plans and
 specifications and a high degree of reliability on statements and representations made by
 engineers, contractors, suppliers, and workers on Federal-aid highway projects, it is essential
 that all persons concerned with the project perform their functions as carefully, thoroughly, and
 honestly as possible. Willful falsification, distortion, or misrepresentation with respect to any
 facts related to the project is a violation of Federal law. To prevent any misunderstanding
 regarding the seriousness of these and similar acts, Form FHWA-1022 shall be posted on each
 Federal-aid highway project (23 CFR 635) in one or more places where it is readily available to
 all persons concerned with the project:
 18 U.S.C. 1020 reads as follows:
 "Whoever, being an officer, agent, or employee of the United States, or of any State or
 Territory, or whoever, whether a person, association, firm, or corporation, knowingly makes any
 false statement, false representation, or false report as to the character, quality, quantity, or cost
 of the material used or to be used, or the quantity or quality of the work performed or to be
 performed, or the cost thereof in connection with the submission of plans, maps, specifications,
 contracts, or costs of construction on any highway or related project submitted for approval to
 the Secretary of Transportation; or
 Whoever knowingly makes any false statement, false representation, false report or false claim
 with respect to the character, quality, quantity, or cost of any work performed or to be
 performed, or materials furnished or to be furnished, in connection with the construction of any
 highway or related project approved by the Secretary of Transportation; or
 Whoever knowingly makes any false statement or false representation as to material fact in any
 statement, certificate, or report submitted pursuant to provisions of the Federal-aid Roads Act
 approved July 1, 1916, (39 Stat. 355), as amended and supplemented;
 Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years or both."
 
 A-34
 
 IX. IMPLEMENTATION OF CLEAN AIR ACT AND FEDERAL WATER POLLUTION
 CONTROL ACT
 This provision is applicable to all Federal-aid construction contracts and to all related
 subcontracts.
 By submission of this bid/proposal or the execution of this contract, or subcontract, as
 appropriate, the bidder, proposer, Federal-aid construction contractor, or subcontractor, as
 appropriate, will be deemed to have stipulated as follows:
 1. That any person who is or will be utilized in the performance of this contract is not
 prohibited from receiving an award due to a violation of Section 508 of the Clean Water Act or
 Section 306 of the Clean Air Act.
 2. That the contractor agrees to include or cause to be included the requirements of paragraph
 (1) of this Section X in every subcontract, and further agrees to take such action as the
 contracting agency may direct as a means of enforcing such requirements.
 X. CERTIFICATION REGARDING DEBARMENT, SUSPENSION, INELIGIBILITY
 AND VOLUNTARY EXCLUSION
 This provision is applicable to all Federal-aid construction contracts, design-build contracts,
 subcontracts, lower-tier subcontracts, purchase orders, lease agreements, consultant contracts or
 any other covered transaction requiring FHWA approval or that is estimated to cost $25,000 or
 more – as defined in 2 CFR Parts 180 and 1200.
 1. Instructions for Certification – First Tier Participants:
 a. By signing and submitting this proposal, the prospective first tier participant is providing
 the certification set out below.
 b. The inability of a person to provide the certification set out below will not necessarily result
 in denial of participation in this covered transaction. The prospective first tier participant shall
 submit an explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set out below. The certification
 or explanation will be considered in connection with the department or agency's determination
 whether to enter into this transaction. However, failure of the prospective first tier participant to
 furnish a certification or an explanation shall disqualify such a person from participation in this
 transaction.
 c. The certification in this clause is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was
 placed when the contracting agency determined to enter into this transaction. If it is later
 determined that the prospective participant knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in
 addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the contracting agency may
 terminate this transaction for cause of default.
 d. The prospective first tier participant shall provide immediate written notice to the
 contracting agency to whom this proposal is submitted if any time the prospective first tier
 A-35
 
 participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous
 by reason of changed circumstances.
 e. The terms "covered transaction," "debarred," "suspended," "ineligible," "participant,"
 "person," "principal," and "voluntarily excluded," as used in this clause, are defined in 2 CFR
 Parts 180 and 1200. “First Tier Covered Transactions” refers to any covered transaction
 between a grantee or subgrantee of Federal funds and a participant (such as the prime or general
 contract). “Lower Tier Covered Transactions” refers to any covered transaction under a First
 Tier Covered Transaction (such as subcontracts). “First Tier Participant” refers to the
 participant who has entered into a covered transaction with a grantee or subgrantee of Federal
 funds (such as the prime or general contractor). “Lower Tier Participant” refers any participant
 who has entered into a covered transaction with a First Tier Participant or other Lower Tier
 Participants (such as subcontractors and suppliers).
 f. The prospective first tier participant agrees by submitting this proposal that, should the
 proposed covered transaction be entered into, it shall not knowingly enter into any lower tier
 covered transaction with a person who is debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily
 excluded from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the department or
 agency entering into this transaction.
 g. The prospective first tier participant further agrees by submitting this proposal that it will
 include the clause titled "Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and
 Voluntary Exclusion-Lower Tier Covered Transactions," provided by the department or
 contracting agency, entering into this covered transaction, without modification, in all lower tier
 covered transactions and in all solicitations for lower tier covered transactions exceeding the
 $25,000 threshold.
 h. A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification of a prospective
 participant in a lower tier covered transaction that is not debarred, suspended, ineligible, or
 voluntarily excluded from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification is
 erroneous. A participant is responsible for ensuring that its principals are not suspended,
 debarred, or otherwise ineligible to participate in covered transactions. To verify the eligibility
 of its principals, as well as the eligibility of any lower tier prospective participants, each
 participant may, but is not required to, check the Excluded Parties List System website
 (https://www.epls.gov/), which is compiled by the General Services Administration.
 i. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require the establishment of a
 system of records in order to render in good faith the certification required by this clause. The
 knowledge and information of the prospective participant is not required to exceed that which is
 normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
 j. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph (f) of these instructions, if a participant
 in a covered transaction knowingly enters into a lower tier covered transaction with a person
 who is suspended, debarred, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this
 
 A-36
 
 transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department
 or agency may terminate this transaction for cause or default.

 a. By signing and submitting this proposal, the prospective lower tier is providing the
 certification set out below.
 b. The certification in this clause is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was
 placed when this transaction was entered into. If it is later determined that the prospective lower
 tier participant knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies
 available to the Federal Government, the department, or agency with which this transaction
 originated may pursue available remedies, including suspension and/or debarment.
 
 A-37
 
 c. The prospective lower tier participant shall provide immediate written notice to the person
 to which this proposal is submitted if at any time the prospective lower tier participant learns
 that its certification was erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

 "person," "principal," and "voluntarily excluded," as used in this clause, are defined in 2 CFR
 Parts 180 and 1200. You may contact the person to which this proposal is submitted for
 assistance in obtaining a copy of those regulations. “First Tier Covered Transactions” refers to
 any covered transaction between a grantee or subgrantee of Federal funds and a participant (such
 as the prime or general contract). “Lower Tier Covered Transactions” refers to any covered
 transaction under a First Tier Covered Transaction (such as subcontracts). “First Tier
 Participant” refers to the participant who has entered into a covered transaction with a grantee or
 subgrantee of Federal funds (such as the prime or general contractor). “Lower Tier Participant”
 refers any participant who has entered into a covered transaction with a First Tier Participant or
 other Lower Tier Participants (such as subcontractors and suppliers).
 e. The prospective lower tier participant agrees by submitting this proposal that, should the
 proposed covered transaction be entered into, it shall not knowingly enter into any lower tier
 covered transaction with a person who is debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily
 excluded from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the department or
 agency with which this transaction originated.

 include this clause titled "Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and
 Voluntary Exclusion-Lower Tier Covered Transaction," without modification, in all lower tier
 covered transactions and in all solicitations for lower tier covered transactions exceeding the
 $25,000 threshold.
 g. A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification of a prospective
 participant in a lower tier covered transaction that is not debarred, suspended, ineligible, or
 voluntarily excluded from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification is
 erroneous. A participant is responsible for ensuring that its principals are not suspended,
 debarred, or otherwise ineligible to participate in covered transactions. To verify the eligibility
 of its principals, as well as the eligibility of any lower tier prospective participants, each
 participant may, but is not required to, check the Excluded Parties List System website
 (https://www.epls.gov/), which is compiled by the General Services Administration.
 h. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system
 of records in order to render in good faith the certification required by this clause. The
 knowledge and information of participant is not required to exceed that which is normally
 possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
 i. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph e of these instructions, if a participant in
 a covered transaction knowingly enters into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who
 
 A-38
 
 is suspended, debarred, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction,
 in addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department or agency
 with which this transaction originated may pursue available remedies, including suspension
 and/or debarment.

 be removed under another item, shall be removed as directed. Branches of trees extending over
 the roadbed shall be trimmed to provide a clear height of 20 feet above the road and shoulder
 
 2-1
 
 surface. Trimming shall be done by skilled workers and in accordance with good tree surgery
 practices.
 Alignment stakes, grade stakes, witness stakes, boundary markers, bench marks and tie
 points shall be preserved until permission is given for their destruction.
 201.04 Clearing In areas indicated on the plans, all trees, down timber, brush, bushes,
 shrubs, plants and debris not designated to remain shall be removed and disposed of.
 In areas where the proposed embankment is not designated to be grubbed, as provided in
 Subsection 203.09 - Preparation of the Embankment Area, all stumps shall be cut off as close to
 the ground as is practicable. When stumps are to remain in the backslope rounding of cut
 sections, they shall be cut flush with the final slope line.
 All wood in the clearing area, except trees designated to remain, shall become the property
 of the Contractor, unless otherwise provided.
 The Contractor shall take special care to completely dispose of all elm trees removed.
 All live hardwood stumps, 1 inch or more in diameter located between the lines of
 improvement and the outermost clearing or selective clearing lines shall be treated with an
 approved herbicides, unless specifically exempted.
 In areas where stumps and shrubs are to remain, the surface of the ground shall not be
 unduly disturbed or compacted. Existing ground cover shall be preserved insofar as possible
 and the area shall be left neat and clean and in a condition that is reasonably consistent with the
 surroundings.
 201.05 Selective Clearing and Thinning In order that trees may be properly marked, the
 Contractor shall give the Resident at least 2 weeks notice before starting work. Only those trees
 or bushes designated to be removed shall be cut. In no event shall selective clearing and
 thinning operations begin until approval is given.
 All dead or diseased trees or shrubs, junk, trash, litter or foreign matter of any kind shall be
 removed from the areas to be enhanced. This shall include uprooted stumps and all branches,
 tops, trunks and dead wood, resulting from woodcutting operations or from any other causes.
 Trees and shrubs to be preserved shall be carefully pruned to remove all dead, diseased and
 injured wood. In addition, in certain areas, the Resident may require the branches of designated
 trees to be removed to a height above ground as directed. Complete clearing may be required in
 certain areas. Such clearing shall be included under this Subsection. Storing logs and pulpwood
 in thinned areas shall be avoided.
 The Contractor shall avoid disturbing or compacting the existing ground surfaces as well as
 avoiding damage to plant growth. The use of heavy equipment, operating anywhere within the
 area to be selectively thinned, will not be allowed unless authorized.
 
 2-2
 
 Any injury to trees and shrubs that are to be preserved shall be carefully repaired. Disturbed
 ground surface shall be restored as nearly as possible to natural conditions.
 Pruning and repairs to live trees and shrubs shall be done by skilled workers or tree surgeons
 according to approved arboricultural practice. All stumps, new or old, shall be cut off as close
 to the ground as is practicable.
 Trees falling outside the specified limits of the thinning areas shall be removed and disposed
 of in a satisfactory manner. Undesirable trees leaning or falling over the highway right-of-way
 from outside shall be cut at the property line.
 201.06 Herbicides All herbicides shall be approved by the Department of Transportation
 Landscape Architect. The herbicides shall be applied by Certified Pesticide Applicators in
 accordance with State Pesticides Control Board Regulations. With the exception of coniferous
 (softwood) trees, stumps over 1 inch in diameter resulting from cutting live hardwood trees and
 shrubs shall be treated with approved herbicide spray mixture. The spray mixture may be
 applied at any time until regrowth from the stumps has reached a height of approximately 24
 inches except that it shall not be applied when the stumps are wet or frozen. The herbicide spray
 mixture shall be sprayed on all exposed surfaces of stumps and the stems of regrowth, until there
 is complete saturation and run-off. Particular attention to coverage shall be given to the bark
 and all exposed roots.
 All stumps shall receive at least one treatment with the herbicide spray mixture. At the time
 of final acceptance, live regrowth of hardwood tree seedlings shall have been substantially
 eliminated. Any remaining regrowth will require another treatment before final acceptance.
 Particular care must be taken that the herbicide mix does not come in contact with or too
 near live trees and shrubs that are to be preserved. Unless otherwise directed the spray mixture
 shall not be applied closer than 2 feet from the trunk of a tree that is to remain.
 When directed, live stumps in specified areas shall be exempted from spraying with
 herbicides.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining the treated area until final acceptance of
 the work. All damage or dieback shall be repaired at the Contractor's expense as directed. At
 the time of final acceptance the area shall be free of all dead, dying or damaged trees and shrubs
 and litter of any kind as well as free from regrowth.
 201.07 Disposal All brush, timber, logs and other woody debris shall be disposed of by
 approved methods. The Contractor shall make every effort to provide useful disposition of

 2-3
 
 Acceptable methods of disposal may include chipping, grinding, and burying. Burning will
 not be allowed.
 a. Chipping Wood chippers shall reduce woody material to chips, not over ¼ inch thick
 by not over 8 inches long, and the chips shall be spread uniformly over the ground or as
 directed.
 b. Burying Brush and logs may be disposed of by burying in approved waste dumps or
 by placing in the portion of the embankments outside a slope 1-1/2 horizontal to 1 vertical
 extending from the edge of the shoulder to the existing ground and covering with a
 minimum of 2 feet of earth. Excavation or borrow used to cover the brush and logs in the
 slopes may be placed in layers at least 2 feet thick and compacted only to the extent that the
 stability of the slope is assured. For a related provision, see Department of Environmental
 Protection Code of Maine Regulations 401 Section 7.
 c. Burning Burning is not allowed
 201.08 Removing Single Trees and Stumps When called for on the plans or otherwise
 designated, complete removal and disposal of single trees and stumps shall be required and shall
 include the backfilling of stump holes.
 Trees, which have been uprooted, shall be removed by cutting the tree and removing the
 stump from the ground or, where approved, the stumps may be placed back in the hole to present
 a natural appearance. The area shall be graded to conform to the surrounding terrain.
 201.09 Method of Measurement Clearing, and selective clearing and thinning will be
 measured by the acre, determined from horizontal dimensions, acceptably and actually cleared
 or thinned within the limits shown on the plans or additional areas flagged by the Resident.
 Areas not shown on the plans or not flagged for clearing or thinning will not be measured for
 payment.
 As an alternative to field measurements, the Contractor and the Resident may agree in
 writing that the acreage acceptably cleared for payment will be that shown in the Schedule of
 Items. If such an agreement is reached, no further measuring and computing of quantities will
 be required and the quantity referred to herein will be final.
 Single trees and stumps will be measured by each unit. The size of the tree shall be the
 average diameter determined by circumferential measurement at a height of 4½ feet above the
 ground. When trees are removed under this contract and the removal of the stump is required,
 the stump size shall be the same size as that determined for the tree. The size of all other stumps
 shall be the greatest horizontal cross sectional dimension determined at the top of the stump.
 Trees or stumps, which have multiple trunks protruding from a single base trunk, shall be
 measured for payment as a single tree or stump.
 
 2-4
 
 Individual trunks of multiple trunk trees or stumps having a diameter of less than 12 inches
 will not be included to determine the size of a tree or stump.
 201.10 Basis of Payment The accepted quantities of clearing, selective clearing and thinning
 will be paid for at the contract unit price per acre.
 The accepted quantity of single trees and stumps removed will be paid for at the contract
 unit price each. Payment for trees shall include removal and disposal of the entire tree except
 stumps.
 All stumps, as defined in Subsection 201.01 d.2 and designated to be removed, will be paid
 for at the contract unit price each. Payment shall include removal and disposal of the stumps
 and roots.
 When the Schedule of Items does not contain an estimated quantity for clearing, and it is not
 noted on the plans as incidental, the work, when authorized, will be paid for under the
 provisions of Section 109.3 - Extra Work.
 When the use of herbicide or tree paint is required to complete the work included under this
 section, it will not be paid for directly, but will be considered as included in the other contract
 pay items.
 Grubbing, when required, will be measured and paid for as provided in Section 203 Excavation and Embankment.
 Payment for removal of trees and stumps, not defined as contract pay items under Section
 201.01d, shall be considered incidental to the contract and no separate payment will be made.
 Removal of unsound and unsightly branches and trimming branches of trees, as specified in
 Subsection 201.03 - General, will be paid for under the provisions of Sections 109.03 - Extra

 limits designated on the plans and shall be accomplished without damage to the portion of the
 structure to remain.
 Removing existing bridge shall be to the limits shown on the plans.
 Existing concrete curbs, granite curbs, and concrete sidewalks shall be removed to the limits
 shown on the plans using a chipping hammer or pavement breaker of a size approved by the
 Resident or any other method approved by the Resident which will not damage the structural
 integrity of the concrete deck to remain.
 Before removal of existing concrete curbs or sidewalks, the fascia removal line, as indicated
 on the plans, shall be saw cut to a depth of 1 inch minimum. Care shall be taken not to damage
 any reinforcing steel that is to remain in the bridge.
 When the material from an existing structure is to be retained by the Department, the
 Contractor shall carefully dismantle it, and all materials, except those that may be specified to be
 reused in the new structure, shall be loaded on trucks supplied by the Department or carefully
 stored by the Contractor within the right-of-way. The use of any portion of the salvaged
 material in connection with new or temporary construction shall not be anticipated by the
 Contractor. The dismantling of metal structures or railings shall, when especially provided,
 include the removal of all bolts and rivets necessary to disconnect the members and the
 matchmarking of these members for future reassembling.
 When the material from an existing structure is designated to become the property of the
 Contractor, it shall be entirely removed and disposed of out of sight of the highway and beyond
 the limits of the right-of-way. Such material shall not be deposited in rivers, streams, or other
 bodies of water. If the material is to be wasted then it shall be disposed of at an approved
 location.
 When practical, any suitable material removed shall be used in backfilling or for the
 formation of embankments and no additional allowances for payment will be made. Unsuitable
 or surplus material shall be disposed of in an approved waste area.
 Blasting or other operations necessary for the removal of an existing structure or obstruction,
 which might damage new construction, shall be completed before placing the new work. If this

 202.031 Removing Existing Bituminous Pavement and Concrete Wearing Surface from
 Bridges and Scarifying the Top of Deck The full depth of existing bituminous pavement, or
 concrete wearing surface shall be removed from curb to curb for the entire length of the bridge.
 Membrane waterproofing, if present, shall also be removed in a manner approved by the
 Resident.
 
 2-7
 
 Extreme care shall be taken to avoid damaging the top of the concrete deck to remain. All
 existing deck concrete damaged by the Contractor, which is not specified to be scarified or
 rehabilitated, shall be repaired. Such repair shall be at the expense of the Contractor.
 When rehabilitation of the top of the deck is called for on the plans, the work will be done in
 accordance with Section 518 - Rehabilitation of Structural Concrete Bridge Decks.
 When scarifying the top of the deck is called for, the specified depth of material shall be
 removed from curb to curb for the entire length of the bridge. Removal shall be accomplished
 by an approved scarifying machine. Areas that cannot be removed by a scarifying machine, such
 as adjacent to curbs, drains, and armored joints, shall be removed by using a maximum 35
 pound chipping hammer or pavement breaker.
 202.04 Removing Portland Cement Concrete Pavement All Portland cement concrete
 pavement and Portland cement concrete base course designated for removal shall be broken into
 pieces suitable for use in construction or embankment or disposed of as directed by the Resident.
 When used in construction of embankments, the maximum size of any fragment shall not exceed
 the thickness of the layer being placed. The Contractor may, at their option and with approval,
 dispose of material in approved waste areas and replace with an equivalent volume of granular
 borrow at no cost to the State.
 202.05 Removing Manholes or Catch Basins Where the manhole or catch basin is under a
 roadway of embankment, the sides shall be removed to a depth of at least 2 feet below subgrade.
 When the plans do not provide for the complete removal of pipe(s) connecting to the catch basin
 or manhole, said pipe: (1) if to be connected to new pipe, shall not be disturbed, or (2) if no
 connection is called for, the pipe shall be tightly plugged with mortared masonry. Floors of the
 structures shall be broken up or removed to permit drainage. The open cavity shall be filled
 with earth and thoroughly compacted.
 202.06 Removing Bituminous Concrete Pavement The equipment for removing the
 bituminous pavement shall be capable of scarifying and loading the bituminous pavement
 without including any gravel, except that adhering to the pavement. The remaining gravel shall
 be graded to drain as approved by the Resident.
 202.061 Removing Pavement Surface The equipment for removing the bituminous surface
 shall be a power operated milling machine or grinder capable of removing bituminous concrete
 pavement to the required depth, transverse cross slope, and profile grade by the use of an
 automated grade and slope control system. The controls shall automatically increase or decrease
 the pavement removal depth as required, and readily maintain desired cross slope, to compensate
 for surface irregularities in the existing pavement course. The equipment shall be capable of
 accurately establishing profile grades by referencing from a fixed reference such as a grade wire,
 or from the existing pavement surface using a 30 foot minimum contact ski (floating beam), or
 24 foot non-contact grade control beam.
 
 2-8
 
 The Contractor shall locate and remove all objects in the pavement through the work area
 that would be detrimental to the planing or grinding machine.
 The finished milled surface will be inspected before being accepted, and any deviations in
 the profile exceeding ½ inch under a 16 foot string line or straightedge placed parallel to the
 centerline will be corrected. Any deviations in the cross-slope that exceed ⅜ inch under a 10
 foot string line or straightedge placed transversely to centerline will be corrected. All corrections
 will be made with approved methods and materials. Any areas that require corrective measures
 will be subject to the same acceptance tolerances. Excess material that becomes bonded to the
 milled surface will be removed to the Resident’s satisfaction before the area is accepted.
 202.062 Pavement Butt Joints The equipment for removing the bituminous surface shall be
 a cold milling machine or a power operated planer capable of removing the existing pavement to
 the required depth, width, grade, and slope.
 The milled surface shall have a uniform texture and provide acceptable rideability for
 vehicles. Should resurfacing be delayed, or the resulting milled surface is unsatisfactory for any
 reason, bituminous leveling course or temporary pavement may be required. The Contractor
 shall clean the milled surface and surrounding area of all loose material prior to use by traffic.
 202.07 Method of Measurement Removing buildings, removing existing superstructures,
 and removing existing bridges will each be measured by the lump sum. Removing Portland
 cement concrete pavement, removing bituminous concrete pavement, pavement butt joints, and
 removing pavement surface will be measured by the square yard with no deductions made for
 areas occupied by existing catch basins and manholes. Removing existing structural concrete
 will be measured either by the cubic yard in place before work starts on the particular portion of
 the structure to be removed or by the lump sum as specified. Remove existing railings will be
 measured by the foot in place along the grade and line of the railing from outside to outside of
 end posts or rail projections, whichever is greater.
 The removing of existing bituminous pavement, removing existing concrete wearing surface,
 removing of existing concrete curbs and sidewalks from bridges, and scarifying of the concrete
 deck will each be measured for payment as one lump sum unit, complete, and accepted.
 The removing of existing manholes and catch basins will be measured by the unit.
 202.08 Basis of Payment The accepted quantity of removing building, removing existing
 superstructure, and removing existing bridge will be paid for at the contract lump sum price,
 which price shall be full compensation for removing and disposing of the obstructions and
 building foundations down to an elevation matching the surrounding ground as directed by the
 Resident. Removing Portland cement concrete pavement will be paid for at the contract unit
 price per square yard which price will be full compensation for removing and disposing of
 pavement and pavement reinforcement. Material for backfilling holes resulting from removal of
 obstructions will be measured and paid for as provided in Section 203 - Excavation and
 Embankments. The quantity of structural concrete removed will be paid for, either at the
 
 2-9
 
 contract unit price per cubic yard or at the contract lump sum price which price shall include
 disposal of the concrete. The quantity of railing removed will be paid for at the respective
 contract unit price per foot of railing removed and disposed of.
 Removing and scarifying existing concrete, removing existing concrete wearing surface, and
 removing existing bituminous pavement from bridges will be paid for at the contract lump sum
 price for the respective contract pay item involved. Removing membrane waterproofing, if
 present on the existing deck, shall be incidental to the removing of bituminous pavement.
 The containment and disposal of pollutants during the removal of materials from an existing
 bridge will not be paid for directly but shall be incidental to the related contract Pay Item. These
 payment provisions shall prevail over those of Section 656 - Temporary Soil Erosion and Water
 Pollution Control, for this work only. The payment for each contract pay item will be full
 compensation for furnishing all materials, labor, equipment for all formwork, and for all other
 incidentals necessary to complete the work.
 Removing existing manholes and catch basins will be paid for at the contract unit bid price
 each, which price shall include all work, materials, labor, and equipment. New pipe as required
 by the plans will be paid for separately under the appropriate pay item. Where new pipe is to be
 connected to existing pipe, the Contractor shall furnish and install, at their expense, pipe
 necessary to replace any existing pipe damaged beyond the limits of pipe removal shown on the
 plans.
 Removing bituminous concrete pavement will be paid for at the contract unit price for the
 number of square yards removed as required by the plans or as ordered by the Resident, which
 price will be full compensation for removing and disposing of the bituminous pavement and regrading of the remaining material.
 The accepted quantity of pavement butt joints will be paid for at the contract unit price per
 square yard which price will be full compensation for removing and salvaging the bituminous
 material.
 Any bituminous leveling material or temporary pavement required will not be
 measured for payment directly, but will be incidental to the related contract Pay Items.
 The accepted quantity of removing pavement surface will be paid for at the contract unit
 price per square yard. This price will be full compensation for removing the material to the
 required depth, profile and cross slope, complete cleaning of the milled surface suitable for
 paving, and for salvaging, hauling, and stockpiling excess material to an approved designated
 area. Locating and removing objects, and additional milling and paving required to correct
 deviations will not be paid for separately but will be included in the contract unit price per
 square yard.
 When the pay item calls for material to be retained by the Department, payment shall include
 the salvage of these materials, custody, preservation, and storage on the right-of-way and
 disposal as provided herein. When the proposal does not include pay items for removal of
 structures and obstructions as provided in this Section, such work shall be incidental to the
 
 2-10
 
 various contract pay items and no direct payment will be made except that removal of
 foundations and Portland cement concrete pavement will be paid as provided in Section 203 Excavation and Embankment.

 stumps, roots, bushes, grass, turf or other objectionable material and it shall include berm
 ditches and cut slope downspouts.
 Common Excavation shall include muck removal, which shall consist of excavating and
 disposing of saturated or unsaturated mixtures of soils and organic matter not suitable for
 embankment foundation material regardless of moisture content.
 Common Excavation shall also include removing and disposing of all earth material
 encountered in excavating for permanent stream channel diversion, channel widening or
 straightening, when designated on the Plans, outside the limits of structural excavation or
 other classifications.
 b. Rock Excavation shall consist of removing hard igneous, metamorphic and
 sedimentary rock which cannot be excavated without drilling and blasting or drilling and
 splitting and all boulders, solid mortared stone masonry, concrete masonry, each having a
 volume of 2 yd³ or more. The use of perchlorate is not allowed in blasting operations.
 c. Unclassified Excavation shall consist of common excavation and rock excavation as
 classified above and not measured separately.
 When identical unit prices are bid for Common Excavation and for Rock Excavation, such
 bids shall be considered as a bid for Unclassified Excavation of the combined items and shall be
 so classified.
 203.02 Materials Borrow shall consist of approved material required for the construction of
 embankments or for other portions of the work as designated and shall be obtained from beyond
 the limits of the required cut slopes. Unless otherwise designated in the contract, the Contractor
 shall make their own arrangements for obtaining borrow and shall pay all costs involved. No
 material shall be removed from an approved borrow pit except for use under this contract.
 Material shall meet the requirements
 Materials:
 Common Borrow
 Granular Borrow
 Gravel Borrow
 Rock Borrow
 
 of the following Subsections of Division 700 703.18
 703.19
 703.20
 703.21
 
 2-12
 
 Slope blanket backfill material shall meet the requirements of aggregate for base, subbase,
 Type D specified in Subsection 703.06 - Aggregate for Base and Subbase, as directed.
 203.03 Unauthorized Use of Materials No common excavation, rock excavation,
 unclassified excavation or borrow which is designated for use in embankments or backfill may
 be diverted for the Contractor's own use. Any unauthorized use of such material will be
 adjusted by deducting quantities, measured by the most appropriate method, as determined, and
 115% of the quantity deducted from the total amount.
 203.04 General Prior to beginning excavating, grading, and embankment operations in any
 area, all necessary clearing in that area shall have been performed in accordance with Section
 201 - Clearing Right-of-Way.
 Unsuitable material shall be disposed of as directed and no material shall be wasted without
 permission. Excavating operations shall be conducted so that material outside of the limits of
 slopes will not be disturbed.
 The Resident may designate as unsuitable those soils which cannot be properly compacted in
 embankments and all such unsuitable material shall be disposed of in approved waste storage
 areas or waste areas as directed.
 Suitable material taken from excavation shall be used in the construction of embankment,
 subgrade, and for backfilling as indicated on the plans, or as directed, except that if the volume
 of suitable excavated material exceeds that required to construct the embankments to the grades
 indicated, the excess shall be used as directed or wasted.
 The Contractor shall give the Resident sufficient time before beginning excavation to take
 necessary cross section elevations and measurements. The Contractor shall not excavate beyond
 the dimensions, slopes and elevations established, and no material shall be removed prior to the
 staking out and cross sectioning the site. Unless otherwise authorized, borrow material shall not
 be placed until after all suitable excavation has been placed in the embankment unless the use of
 granular borrow is called for on the plans or required for use under embankments or in
 conjunction with the use of excavated material or for the maintenance of traffic. If the
 Contractor places more borrow than is required and thereby causes a waste of suitable
 excavation material, the amount of such waste will be measured by the method deemed most
 appropriate and 100% of the amount deducted from the borrow volume.
 When different unit prices are bid for Common Excavation and Rock Excavation, the
 Contractor will be required to strip earth from the ledge to provide an opportunity for the
 Resident to take the necessary measurements. When identical prices are bid for Common
 Excavation and Rock Excavation, the Contractor will not be required to strip the earth from the
 ledge.
 When it is necessary to temporarily remove fencing designated to remain, the fencing shall
 be replaced by the Contractor at their expense in as good a condition as it was originally. The
 
 2-13
 
 Contractor shall be responsible for the confinement of livestock when a portion of the fence is
 removed. When new fencing for confinement of livestock is required, it shall be erected before
 existing fencing is disturbed. Where new fencing cannot be erected in its final location,
 temporary fencing shall be at the Contractor's expense.
 Excavating for obliterating old roadways or salvaging material from old roadways shall
 include all grading operations necessary to incorporate the old roadway into the new roadway
 and surroundings or placing salvaged material in a stockpile as directed.
 The degree of finish for grading ditches and slopes, both fill slopes and cut slopes, shall be
 that obtainable from machine operations. Ditches shall be constructed to within 6 inches above
 or below the grade called for on the cross sections or as otherwise modified but in no case shall
 the ditch be finished in a condition that will not allow the flow of water. Ditches shall be graded
 to the extent that puddles will not form. All provisions for measurement and payment limits
 shall remain in force and no payment will be made for unauthorized work done beyond
 authorized pay limits.
 Unstable slopes subject to sliding and slumping shall be excavated to the lines and grades
 shown or as directed. Immediately after each location is excavated approved stone or granular
 slope blanket backfill material shall be placed and shaped to match the adjacent slopes.
 Ledge slopes shall be scaled (cleaned of all loose material) immediately as the excavation
 proceeds. The ledge slope shall then be examined by the Contractor to determine if the slope is
 stable. If the slope is not deemed stable upon this examination, then immediate steps shall be
 taken by the Contractor to insure the stability of the slope during construction. There will be no
 additional pay for any temporary protection required for the construction of the project.
 203.041 Salvage of Existing Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement
 All existing hot mix asphalt pavement designated to be removed under this contract must be
 salvaged for utilization. Existing hot mix asphalt pavement material shall not be deposited in
 any waste area or be placed below subgrade in any embankment.
 Methods of utilization may be any of the following:
 1. Used as a replacement for untreated aggregate surface course on entrances provided
 the material contains no particles greater than 2 inches in any dimension. Payment will be
 made under Pay Item 411.09, Untreated Aggregate Surface Course or 411.10, Untreated
 Aggregate Surface Course, Truck Measure. Material shall be placed, shaped, compacted and
 stabilized as directed by the Resident.
 2. Used as the top 3” of gravel. Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP) shall be processed
 such that the material contains no particles greater than 1 ½ inches in any dimension. When
 this method is utilized, a surcharge will not be required
 3. Stockpiled at commercial or approved sites for commercial or MaineDOT use.
 
 2-14
 
 4. Other approved methods proposed by the Contractor, and approved by the Resident
 which will assure proper use of the existing hot mix asphalt pavement.
 The cost of salvaging hot mix asphalt material will be included for payment under the
 applicable pay item, with no additional allowances made, which will be full compensation for
 removing, temporarily stockpiling, and rehandling, if necessary, and utilizing the material in
 entrances or other approved uses, or stockpiling at an approved site as described above. The
 material will also be measured and paid for under the applicable Pay Item if it is reused for
 aggregate in entrances, or other approved uses.
 203.042 Rock Excavation and Blasting
 1. All blasting operations, including the storage and handling of explosives and blasting
 agents, shall be performed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Standard
 Specifications and all other pertinent Federal, State and local regulations.
 2. The Contractor shall observe the entire blast area to guard against potential hazards
 before commencing work in the cut.
 3. In case of conflict between regulations or between regulations and this Specification, the
 Contractor shall comply with the strictest applicable codes, regulations, or
 Specifications.
 4. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
 a. The Resident will, at all times, have the authority to prohibit or halt the
 Contractor’s blasting operations if it is apparent that through the methods being
 employed, the required slopes are not being obtained in a stable condition, or the
 safety and convenience of the public is being jeopardized.
 b. Explosives shall be stored, handled and employed in accordance with Federal,
 State and Local regulations. No explosives, caps, detonators or fuses shall be
 stored on the project site during non-working hours.
 c. The overburden shall be removed or trenches shall be excavated through the
 overburden at the intervals directed by the Resident, normally 25 ft. but in no
 case closer than 10 ft. apart to permit cross sectioning of the rock in its original
 position. Rock removed prior to sectioning will be considered as Common
 Excavation.
 5. SUBMITTALS
 a. Advance submittal – Not less than two weeks prior to commencing drilling and
 blasting operations, or at any time the Contractor proposes to change drilling and
 blasting methods, the Contractor shall submit a Blasting Plan to the Resident for
 review. The Blasting Plan shall contain full details of the drilling and blasting
 patterns and controls the Contractor proposes to use for both the controlled and
 production blasting. Review of the Blasting Plan by the Department shall not
 relieve the Contractor of his responsibility for the safety, accuracy and adequacy
 of the Plan when implemented in the field. The Blasting Plan shall contain the
 following information.
 i. Station limits of proposed shots.
 
 2-15
 
 ii. Plan and section views of the proposed drill pattern, including free face,
 burden, blasthole spacing, blasthole diameters, blasthole angles, lift
 height, and subdrill depth.
 iii. Loading diagram showing type and amount of explosives, primers,
 initiators, and location and depth of stemming.
 iv. Initiators sequence of blastholes including delay times and delay system.
 v. Manufacturers’ data sheets for all explosives, primers and initiators to be
 used.
 1. The delay elements in blasting caps are known to deteriorate with
 age. For this reason, it is required that all blasting caps used on
 the project be less than one year of age. Blasting products will be
 allowed on the job site if the date codes are missing.
 2. When in the opinion of the Resident any blasting product is either
 of excessive age or in what appears to be a deteriorated condition,
 all work will cease until the product’s age or quality can be
 determined.
 3. Explosives containing Perchlorate compounds shall not be used on
 Department projects.
 vi. Details of the audible advance signal system to be employed at the job
 site.
 vii. Precautions to protect nearby structures and cultural features.
 b. Daily Blasting Logs – The Contractor shall provide the Resident with a daily log
 of blasting operations, submitted on a weekly basis. The log shall be updated at
 the close of each working day. The log shall include the number of blasts, times,
 and dates of blasts, the blasting locations and patterns, and all information shown
 below:
 i. Station limits of the shot.
 ii. Plan and section views of drill pattern, including free face, burden
 blasthole spacing, blasthole diameters, lift height, and subdrill depth.
 iii. Loading diagram showing type and amount of explosive, primers,
 initiators, and location and depth of stemming.
 iv. Initiators sequence of blastholes including delay times and delay system
 in each blasthole.
 v. Mats or other protection used.
 vi. Signature of the Blaster in charge.
 c. The Contractor shall report to the Resident in writing all blasting complaints
 received by the Contractor within 24 hours of receipt. Each blast complaint
 report shall include the name and address of the complainant, time received, date
 and time of blast complained about, and a description of the circumstances which
 led to the complaint.
 6. BLAST VIBRATION CONTROL AND MONITORING
 a. The Contractor shall be required to monitor blasting vibrations (both ground and
 air concussions) and shall provide a Pre-Blast Condition survey of all structures
 and cultural features that may be affected.
 
 2-16
 
 b. When nearby structures, utilities, or adjacent slopes may be subject to damage
 from blast-induced ground vibrations, the ground vibrations shall be controlled
 by the use of properly designed delay sequences and appropriate charge weights
 per delay.
 c. When vibration damage to adjacent structures or cultural features is possible, the
 Contractor shall monitor each blast with an approved seismograph located, as
 approved by the Department, between the blast area and the closest structure
 subject to blast damage. The seismograph used shall be capable of recording
 particle velocity for three mutually perpendicular components of vibration in the
 range generally found with controlled blasting.
 7. FLYROCK CONTROL Before the firing of any blast in areas where flying rock or
 debris may result in personal injury or damage to property, the rock to be blasted shall be
 covered with approved blasting mats, soil, or other equally serviceable material to
 prevent flyrock. The method of flyrock control shall be subject to approval by the
 Resident.
 8. CONTROLLED BLASTING METHODS Controlled blasting is defined as a blasting
 method which utilizes a line of closely spaced, lightly loaded blastholes that are fired
 either before or after the main production blast to define a break line on the perimeter of
 the excavation.
 The purpose of the Controlled blasting is to create a stable rock face with a fall zone to protect
 the traveling public from rockfall hazard, and to protect existing structures, adjacent and nearby
 properties, and the public from damage or injury. Controlled blasting shall be required on all
 rock critical slopes.
 a. Production blasting refers to the main fragmentation blasting resulting from
 widely spaced production holes drilled throughout the main excavation area
 adjacent to the presplit line. Production holes shall be detonated in a controlled
 delay sequence.
 b. Presplitting is defined as the establishment of a free surface of a shear plane in
 rock by the controlled usage of explosives and blasting accessories in
 appropriately aligned and spaced drill holes so that the resulting split rock is not
 affected by subsequent blasting and excavation operations. The purpose of
 presplitting is to minimize damage to the rock backslope and to help ensure long
 term stability. When presplitting, the detonation of the presplit line shall be
 before the detonation of any production holes.
 i. Prior to drilling, all overburden and all loose and disintegrated rock shall
 be removed down to solid rock in the vicinity of the presplit lines.
 Potentially dangerous boulders beyond the excavation limits shall also be
 removed as directed by the Resident.
 ii. Presplitting shall extend a minimum of 30 feet ahead of the limits of
 production blasting within the section or to the end of the cut as
 applicable.
 iii. All drilling equipment used to drill the presplit holes shall have
 electromechanical or electronic devices affixed to that equipment to
 
 2-17
 
 accurately determine the angle at which the drill steel enters the rock.
 Presplit hole drilling will not be permitted if these devices are missing or
 inoperative.
 iv. The length of the presplit holes shall not exceed 30 feet in depth unless
 approved by the Resident. Rock deeper than 30 feet shall usually be
 presplit in lifts, but no lift shall be less than 10 feet in depth. When the
 cut height will require more than one lift, a maximum 2-foot offset
 between lifts shall be permitted to allow for equipment clearance. No
 payment will be made for additional excavated quantity caused by
 offsetting of presplit lines for less than 20 foot lifts. Drilling 2 feet below
 ditch bottom will be allowed to facilitate removal of the toe berm.
 v. Before placing charges, the contractor shall determine that the hole is free
 of obstructions for its entire depth. All necessary precautions shall be
 exercised so that placing the charges will not cause caving of material
 from the walls of the holes.
 vi. The diameter of the explosives used in presplit holes shall not be greater
 than ½ the diameter of the hole.
 vii. Continuous column cartridge explosives manufactured especially for
 presplitting shall be used for all presplitting. The bottom charge of a
 presplit hole may be larger than the line charges, but shall not be large
 enough to cause overbreak. The top charge of the presplitting hole shall
 be placed far enough below the collar, and reduced sufficiently, to avoid
 overbreaking and heaving. The upper portion of all presplit holes, from
 the top charge to the hole collar, shall be stemmed.
 viii. The presplit slope face shall not deviate more than one foot from a plane
 passing though adjacent drillholes, except where the character of the rock
 is such that, as determined by the Resident, irregularities are unavoidable.
 The one-foot plane shall be measured perpendicular to the plane of the
 slope. In no case shall any portion of the slope encroach on the roadbed.
 c. Cushion blasting. Where the horizontal distance from the existing rock face to
 the cut face is less than 15 feet, or if rock conditions warrant this approach, the
 contractor may use cushion blast in lieu of presplitting. Cushion blasting is
 similar to presplitting except that the detonation along the cut face occurs after
 the detonation of all production holes. With the exception of the above criteria,
 requirements previously given for presplitting shall also apply to cushion
 blasting.
 d. Sliver Cuts – For sliver cuts, pioneering the top of cuts and preparing a working
 platform to begin the controlled blasting may require unusual work methods and
 use of equipment. The contractor may use angle drilled holes during the initial
 pioneering operations to obtain the desired rock face. Hole spacing shall not
 exceed 30 inches.
 203.05 Roadway Excavation Roadway excavation shall be maintained in such condition
 that the excavation surface will be well drained. Temporary drains, drainage ditches and
 
 2-18
 
 culverts shall be constructed to intercept and divert water that may adversely affect the condition
 of the excavation and the prosecution of the work.
 Excavation in general, shall proceed in an upgrade direction. Subgrades shall be promptly
 graded and rolled to minimize absorption of water. Adjacent ditches shall be graded to the
 extent that puddles will not form. Grubbing areas which cannot be drained shall be promptly
 filled with approved excavation or borrow to such an elevation that surface drainage will be
 effective. If, due to unusual circumstances, drainage by gravity cannot be accomplished, the
 Resident may require the Contractor to provide adequate means of pumping the area. Pumping
 may be required on a 24 hour a day continuous basis and no direct compensation for cost of
 pumping will be made.
 Muck shall be removed in such a manner to insure its complete removal with no areas
 remaining or trapped below the embankment. Excavated muck shall be deposited in designated
 waste storage areas as shown on the plans or as otherwise directed. When muck is encountered
 that was not contemplated on the plans, it shall be disposed of as indicated above.
 Excavation adjacent to roots of trees or shrubs, which are to remain, shall be removed by
 hand.
 When excavating results in a subgrade of unsuitable soil, the Resident may require the
 Contractor to remove the unsuitable material and backfill the area with approved material. The
 Contractor shall conduct their operations in such a way that the Resident can take the necessary
 measurements before the backfill is placed.
 Material classified as rock, whether paid for as rock excavation or unclassified excavation,
 shall be excavated to the required depth. Care shall be taken that undrained pockets will not be
 left in the surface of the rock remaining.
 The space between the rock remaining and the normal subgrade shown on the plans shall be
 backfilled with the designated aggregate subbase or aggregate base, pulverized rock or other
 approved material. The Contractor shall conduct their excavating and hauling work in a manner
 that will cause as little contamination as possible. Fine grading at the normal subgrade line will
 be required unless aggregate subbase or aggregate base material is used.
 Ditches in rock cuts shall be constructed with no protrusions of rock above the designated
 rock cut pay lines. The space between the rock remaining and the finished surface of the ditch
 shall be backfilled with broken rock.
 For earth and rock backslopes designated to be constructed on a 2 horizontal to 1 vertical
 slope or flatter, the slope shall be uniformly finished to within 6 inches above or 6 inches below
 the lines designated, but in no case shall projections of rock extend over 6 inches above the
 actual finished surface of the slope as constructed. Rock backslopes designated to be
 constructed on a ¼ horizontal to 1 vertical slope shall be excavated at least to a vertical plane.
 
 2-19
 
 Buried structures and obstructions, as specified in Section 104.3.13 - Materials and Items
 Found on the Project, located within the designated limits of the work, shall be removed as part
 of the applicable excavation item for type of work being performed. Buried structures and
 obstructions located below or outside the required excavation, whose removal is ordered, shall
 be removed and such removal paid for as Common Excavation, Rock Excavation or
 Unclassified Excavation, whichever is applicable.
 203.051 Drilling and Blasting of Solid Rock Subgrade. Subgrade areas shall be shattered to
 the dimensions shown on the Plans or as directed by the Resident.
 The area of blasted rock subgrade shall extend sufficiently beyond the beginning and end of cut
 areas to ensure the shattering of all rock to a depth of 4 feet below subgrade elevation to
 eliminate water pockets.
 After detonation, any rock that protrudes above the subgrade elevation after subgrade has been
 proof rolling, shall be removed. When directed by the Resident, the Contractor shall excavate a
 trench across the blasted rock to determine if the rock is broken and rearranged to a depth of 4
 feet below subgrade. Afterwards, the trench shall be backfilled with the rock removed.
 203.06 Waste Areas It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to obtain necessary
 permits and approvals from all pertinent State and Federal agencies and from the local
 municipality before the establishment of waste areas off the project. In addition, written
 permission of the property owners shall be obtained by the Contractor, including permission to
 dispose of waste in the area. Copies of all required permits shall be given to the Resident.
 Provisions shall be made for temporary and permanent erosion controls at waste areas,
 which shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, grading the surface to drain, covering the
 surface with loam or other earthy material that will support growth and seeding and mulching.
 Seed and mulch shall be applied in accordance with Section 618 - Seeding.
 Entrances to waste areas located within wooded areas shall be in accordance with Subsection
 203.07 - Haul Roads.
 When waste areas are located within wooded areas, a screen of trees at least 100 feet wide
 shall be maintained between the nearest edge of the waste area and the right-of-way line or the
 construction limit line.
 The entrances to waste areas shall be treated in the same manner as the waste area except
 that if entrances in wooded areas exceed 16 feet in width the ground shall also be replanted with
 trees compatible with the type growth in adjacent area. These plantings shall extend for a length
 of 100 feet along the entrance road or as otherwise directed.
 All trees that are damaged, uprooted or otherwise moved as a result of the waste material,
 and trees that have had waste material placed around them to the extent that they may die, shall
 be cut and removed at the expense of the Contractor.
 
 2-20
 
 Designated waste areas may be established by the Department. When such waste areas are
 established, the location and other conditions relating to them will be described in the Special
 Provisions or on the plans.
 Waste material shall not be disposed of in wetlands without prior approval and the
 acquisition by the Contractor of all necessary Federal, State and local permits.
 "Wetlands" are those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a
 frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a
 prevalence of vegetation adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally
 include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. The Contractor shall be solely responsible for
 delays and costs resulting from or associated with the proposed disposal of waste material in
 wetlands.
 203.07 Haul Roads In wooded areas, haul roads shall be kept to a minimum width and
 placed at approximately right angles to the road or angled away from view of oncoming traffic.
 203.08 Borrow The location of all borrow pits and rock borrow quarries shall be approved
 in accordance with Section 105.8.6 - Pit Requirements and Section 657 - Rehabilitation of Pits.
 The Contractor shall notify the Resident sufficiently in advance of opening any borrow areas
 so that cross section elevations and measurements of the ground surface after stripping may be
 taken and the borrow material can be tested before being used. Existing pits shall, when
 directed, be graded and shaped by the Contractor before being cross-sectioned for original
 measurements.
 Borrow pits shall be excavated to neat lines and all slopes shall be dressed uniformly and left
 in a neat condition. Before the completion of the project, all borrow pits and haul roads shall be
 graded to blend with adjacent ground, loamed if necessary, seeded and mulched. When
 practicable, the bottom of all pits shall be graded to drain the pit.
 203.09 Preparation of the Embankment Area When the depth of the embankment, measured
 vertically below subgrade, does not exceed 5 feet the area on which the embankment is to be
 placed shall be grubbed as defined in Subsection 203.01 a. When the embankment is more than
 5 feet, as measured above, all vegetation in the embankment area shall be cut as specified in
 Section 201 - Clearing Right-of-Way.
 When embankment is to be placed and compacted on hillsides or where new embankment is
 to be compacted against existing embankment, slopes steeper than 1 vertical to 2 horizontal shall
 be continuously benched by excavating steps into the existing material of sufficient width to
 permit operations of placing and compacting the additional material. Material removed shall be
 placed and compacted along with the new embankment material. When such benching is
 required, it will be as indicated on the plans, called for in the special provisions or as directed.
 
 2-21
 
 203.10 Embankment Construction - General Layers of material for embankments shall start
 at the deepest portion of the fill and as placement progresses, layers shall be constructed
 approximately horizontal. Except for the first layer over swampy ground and cleared areas,
 roadway embankment of earth material shall be placed in layers not exceeding 8 inches, loose
 measure, unless otherwise approved and the material compacted as specified before the next
 layer is placed.
 When it is impractical to construct layers over the full width of the cross section, partial
 width layers may be authorized.
 Effective spreading equipment shall be used on each layer to obtain uniform thickness. Each
 layer shall be crowned and maintained free of ruts and ridges to provide direct drainage of water
 from the embankment. As the compaction of each layer progresses, grading and manipulating
 will be required to assure uniform density. Construction equipment shall be routed uniformly
 over the entire surface of each layer.
 Embankments within 50 feet of a bridge abutment, structural plate or box culvert type
 structure shall be compacted by the moisture and density control method as specified in Section
 203.12 - Construction of Earth Embankment with Moisture and Density Control, except that
 rock embankments may be constructed over culverts as specified in Section 203.15 Construction of Rock Embankments.
 Water shall be added or removed, if necessary, in order to obtain required compaction.
 Aeration of excavated roadway materials to reduce the moisture content to within specified
 limits shall be as specified under Section 631.04 - Aerating.
 When placing layers of specified thickness is not feasible, such as filling in water or over
 swampy ground, the initial layer of embankment may be constructed in one layer to an elevation
 where bridging will be accomplished. In embankment areas where no grubbing is required, the
 material placed in the first layer shall be of sufficient depth to cover all stumps.
 When the excavation or borrow consists predominantly of fragments of such size that the
 material cannot be placed in embankments in layers of specified thickness without breaking
 down the pieces, such material may be placed in layers in thickness not exceeding the
 approximate average size of the larger rocks but in no case shall layers exceed 2 feet. Rocks
 exceeding this thickness shall be separated and collectively placed in accordance with the
 requirements for rock embankments. Each layer shall be leveled and smoothed with suitable
 leveling equipment and by even distribution of rock spalls and finer rock fragments or earth.
 The Resident may test any or all layers by moisture and density control as specified in Section
 203.12 - Construction of Earth Embankment with Moisture and Density Control, which are
 constructed in depths exceeding 8 inches. The layers so constructed shall not be placed above
 an elevation 2 feet below the finish subgrade. The remainder of the embankment shall be
 composed of suitable material smoothed and placed in layers not exceeding 8 inches, loose
 thickness, and compacted as specified for earth embankments.
 
 2-22
 
 Where guardrail is to be installed, rock shall not be placed in the embankment under the
 location of the guardrail to an elevation 4 feet below the finished grade of the shoulder. Rocks,
 broken concrete and other solid materials shall not be placed in any portions of embankments
 where piling is to be placed or driven or where Utility facilities are to be placed.
 Excess or unsuitable excavated material, including rock and boulders, which cannot be used
 in embankments shall be placed in the nearest available waste areas. When it is impossible to
 dispose of all material in the manner described, the remainder shall be disposed of in approved
 waste areas.
 When material obtained from roadway excavation is unsatisfactory for use in the formation
 of embankments due to excessive moisture content, can be rendered satisfactory for such use by
 combining it with granular material, the unsatisfactory material shall be combined with granular
 borrow or granular excavation when and as directed by the Resident.
 If the embankment is required to be deposited on only one side of abutments, wing walls,
 piers or culvert headwalls, care shall be taken that the area immediately adjacent to the structure
 is not compacted excessively to the extent that it will cause overturning of or excessive pressure
 against the structure. When embankment is to be placed on both sides of a concrete wall,
 structural plate or box type structure, operations shall be so conducted that the embankment is
 always at approximately the same elevation on both sides of the structure.
 At the close of each day's work, the embankment surface shall be graded, crowned,
 smoothed, rolled and sealed against infiltration of water.
 The portion of the embankment and subbase outside a 1 vertical to 1½ horizontal slope extending from the edge of the finished shoulder to the existing ground, as shown on the Standard
 Detail entitled "Disposal of Waste Materials", will be required to be compacted only to the
 extent that stability of the slope is assured. As construction of the embankment progresses,
 material placed in the portion of the embankment outside the 1 vertical to 1½ horizontal slope
 shall not be placed above the elevation of the surface of the main embankment unless provisions
 are made to allow drainage of surface water from the embankment. The surface of the slopes
 shall be finished to present a uniform neat appearance.
 The portion of the embankment inside the aforementioned 1 vertical to 1½ horizontal slope
 lines shall be compacted in accordance with the designated embankment compaction
 requirements specified for the project.
 203.11 Construction of Earth Embankment-Layer Method The layer method will be
 required unless otherwise specified. Unless otherwise approved the material shall be deposited
 and spread upon compacted material in full width layers not more than 8 inches in depth, loose
 measure. Clay or loam soils shall be compacted by use of sheeps foot or tamping type roller
 having a minimum weight on each tamper, under working conditions, of 250 psi of cross
 sectional bearing area. Sand or gravel soils shall be compacted by vibratory type compaction
 equipment or by pneumatic tired equipment and, if necessary, by the addition of water. A
 
 2-23
 
 combination of the above or other methods capable of producing equivalent results may be
 used. The compacting operations shall be continued until each layer is compacted to its full
 depth and width.
 With approval, the Contractor may place layers in excess of 8 inches and less than 24 inches,
 loose measure, providing the specified compaction requirements are obtained and the Contractor
 agrees to make necessary test excavation for the Resident to determine density.
 The Contractor will be required to demonstrate that the compaction equipment and methods
 are obtaining satisfactory compaction.
 Satisfactory compaction for the purpose of the demonstration is defined as not less than
 90% of the maximum density. The maximum density shall be determined in accordance with
 AASHTO T180, Method C or D, correcting for oversize particles according to AASHTO T 224
 except mixtures may have 40 percent or less retained on the ¾ inch sieve. (An Adjustment
 Chart/Spreadsheet for this correction is available at the MaineDOT Central Laboratory in
 Bangor, Maine). Field density tests will be performed by the Department in accordance with
 AASHTO T 310.
 Compaction of each layer of base or subbase material that exceeds 40 percent retained on the
 ¾ inch sieve shall continue until a density of not less than 98% of the maximum density has
 been achieved for the full width and depth of the layer. Density tests and the maximum density
 determined by a control section shall be performed by the Department.
 A 300 foot section at the start of the operation will be designated as the control section. The
 contractor shall add or remove water to the control section as directed until the Department
 determines that optimum moisture has been obtained. The control section shall then be rolled as
 directed using the specified compaction equipment until the Department determines that four
 consecutive passes do not increase the dry density by more than 1 lb/ft3. The compaction process
 shall be repeated for each roller. Once the compaction process is complete, the Department will
 perform several additional density tests. The average of these tests shall be used to determine the
 maximum density of the control section.
 203.12 Construction of Earth Embankment with Moisture and Density Control The contract
 or Section 203.10 will designate the areas to be constructed with moisture and density control
 and the distance below subgrade to which such methods shall be applied. The moisture content
 at the time of compaction shall be suitable to obtain the required density. The maximum density
 shall be determined in accordance with AASHTO T180, Method C or D, correcting for oversize
 particles according to AASHTO T 224 except mixtures may have 40 percent or less retained on
 the ¾ inch sieve. (An Adjustment Chart/Spreadsheet for this correction is available at the
 MaineDOT Central Laboratory in Bangor, Maine). Field density tests will be performed by the
 Department.
 All material in embankments above the elevation designated on the plans for moisture
 density control shall be placed at a moisture content suitable to obtain the required
 
 2-24
 
 density. Each layer placed with controlled moisture shall be compacted to not less than 90% of
 the maximum density.
 Compaction of each layer of base or subbase material that exceeds 40 percent retained on the
 ¾ inch sieve shall continue until a density of not less than 98% of the maximum density has
 been achieved for the full width and depth of the layer. Density tests and the maximum density
 determined by a control section shall be performed by the Department.
 A 300 foot section at the start of the operation will be designated as the control section. The
 contractor shall add or remove water to the control section as directed until the Department
 determines that optimum moisture has been obtained. The control section shall then be rolled as
 directed using the specified compaction equipment until the Department determines that four
 consecutive passes do not increase the dry density by more than 1 lb/ft3. The compaction process
 shall be repeated for each roller. Once the compaction process is complete, the Department will
 perform several additional density tests. The average of these tests shall be used to determine the
 maximum density of the control section.
 203.15 Construction of Rock Embankments The material for rock embankment shall be
 placed in compacted layers not exceeding 3 feet in depth. Depositing the rock directly over the
 end of the fill from the hauling equipment will not be permitted; it shall be deposited on the fill
 and pushed into place. The top of the rock embankment shall be so choked that there will be no
 infiltration of the earth embankment placed on the top of the rock embankment.
 This method shall be used only in fills in excess of 4 feet in depth. In no case shall the rock
 embankment be placed within 1 foot of subgrade (4 feet in guardrail areas).
 When structures are located under rock embankment, they shall be covered with not less
 than 2 feet of earth excavation or borrow before the rock embankment is placed over the
 structures.
 203.16 Winter Construction of Embankments Frozen material shall not be placed in the
 core embankment. The construction of embankments may continue during cold weather only
 when all frozen material in the top of the core embankment or the existing ground is moved to
 the waste area before placing additional material. When this procedure results in additional
 borrow quantity the additional borrow will not be paid for directly.
 Compaction shall be in accordance with the specified method of embankment construction.
 When the prevailing temperatures are below 30°F all material used in embankment construction
 shall have a moisture content, at the time of compaction, equal to or less than the optimum
 moisture content.
 The embankment shall not be constructed upon frozen material except that such construction
 of embankments may be allowed providing the total depth of the added fill, including bases,
 plus the depth of the frozen material beneath does not exceed 5 feet. Frozen material may be left
 in the embankment only if it has been compacted as specified before freezing. The Contractor
 
 2-25
 
 shall not resume construction of any embankments built in this manner until all frozen material
 has thawed. If test holes are required to make this determination they shall be dug and
 backfilled with satisfactory compaction at the Contractor's expense. Before additional material
 is added, uncompacted material on the surface of such embankments shall be either recompacted
 in accordance with the specified method of embankment construction or removed.
 203.17 Preparation and Protection of the Subgrade Unless otherwise provided, the subgrade
 shall be brought to a condition of uniform stability and compacted for the full width of the
 roadway by grading and rolling operation and shall be maintained to no tolerance above or 3
 inches below the required grade and cross section. The surface shall be compacted to uniform
 density and stability and graded to the extent that puddles of water will not form. Additional
 material required as a result of low subgrade shall be furnished and placed at the expense of the
 Contractor.
 The required compaction shall be the same as specified for embankments. When the
 subgrade occurs in cuts, the required compaction shall apply to a depth of 6 inches below
 subgrade unless otherwise specified.
 The Contractor shall protect the subgrade from damage. Ditches and drains along the
 roadway shall be maintained to effectively drain the subgrade. In no case shall vehicles be
 allowed to travel in a single track and form ruts. No material shall be deposited on a subgrade
 until the subgrade has been approved.
 203.18 Method of Measurement Except as otherwise provided, excavation and borrow will
 be measured by the number of cubic yards measured in place by cross sectional elevations.
 Measurements will include slides in common excavation and unclassified excavation, not
 attributable to carelessness of the Contractor, and authorized excavation of earth, rock, shale,
 muck or other unsuitable material. Volumes will be computed by the average end area method
 or by other methods generally recognized as conforming to good engineering practice.
 When granular borrow or gravel borrow is placed for backfill behind bridge abutments and
 around structural plate pipes, pipe arches, and plate arches to the lines, grades, and dimensions
 shown on the plans, the quantity measured for payment will be that portion of the number of
 cubic yards shown in the Schedule of Items that is estimated for the structure.
 This quantity is considered final, and no adjustments will be made except under the
 following conditions:
 a. When the structure is founded on ledge, the quantity measured will be what is actually
 placed to maximum allowable horizontal dimensions shown on the plans.
 b. When changes to the plans are made by the Resident.
 Muck excavation, to be measured for payment as common excavation, will be the number of
 cubic yards of material acceptably excavated from areas shown on the plans or other authorized
 
 2-26
 
 areas not shown on the plans or placed in waste storage areas or hauled to an approved waste
 area. Muck excavation shall be measured in its original position by cross sectional elevations
 and the volume computed by the average end area method. If muck is stored in excess of the
 maximum slope requirements of any waste storage area, the amount requiring reloading, hauling
 and disposing of in other waste storage areas or approved waste areas will not again be
 measured for payment.
 When it is impractical to measure excavation by the cross sectional method, acceptable
 methods involving three-dimensional measurements may be used. When small quantities of
 borrow are involved and it is impractical to measure in place, a quantity not exceeding 2,500
 cubic yards per item for a single project may be measured in vehicles at the point of delivery. If
 a dedicated borrow pit is available for the project, the entire quantity may be measured pit
 quantity. When measured in vehicles the quantity for payment shall be 80% of the quantity
 determined for earth and 100% of the quantity determined for rock as shown on delivery slips.
 When pit measured, the amount for payment shall be 90% of the quantity so measured for earth
 material and 130% of the quantity so measured for rock.
 Unless otherwise authorized, measurement for excavation in earth cuts will be made to the
 designated slopes. Field changes made by the Resident will be measured by cross sections or by
 other acceptable methods. Elevations for final cross sections shall be determined at the surface
 of the finished ground with no additional allowance for thickness of loam, sod, riprap, hay
 mulch, or other type of ground cover except that excavation for slope gravel blanket will be
 measured by the cubic yard.
 Unless otherwise authorized, measurement for excavation in rock slopes designated to be
 constructed on a 1 vertical to 2 horizontal slope or flatter will be made to the designated slope
 line providing the finished slope is within tolerances described in Subsection 203.05 - Roadway
 Excavation. If the finished slope line is not within the tolerances described, payment will be
 made to the designated cut slope line or to the finished slope line, whichever yields the lesser
 quantity.
 Unless otherwise authorized, measurement for excavation in rock slopes designated to be
 constructed on a 1 vertical to ¼ horizontal slope will be made to the designated slope providing
 the rock is excavated beyond a vertical plane. There will be no payment for material removed
 beyond the designated slope line.
 Unless authorized, material placed in embankments outside a surface parallel to and 6 inches
 beyond the neat line of embankment slope or 12 inches beyond the neat line of the waste storage
 area in which waste has been placed will not be included in the quantity for payment and will be
 deducted from the borrow at 100% of the material so measured in place.
 The elevations for final cross sections for excavation shall be determined at the surface of
 the finished ground with no additional allowance for thickness of loam, sod, riprap, temporary
 erosion control blanket, hay mulch or other type ground surface except that excavation for slope
 gravel blanket will be measured by the cubic yard.
 
 2-27
 
 Measurements will be made for unsuitable materials actually excavated and removed to
 obtain proper compaction in cut sections and in foundations for fill sections.
 Aeration of excavated materials to reduce moisture content to specified limits will be
 measured as specified under Section 631 - Equipment Rental.
 The quantity of Drilling and Blasting of Solid Rock Subgrade to be measured for payment will
 be the number of square yards of subgrade plan area drilled and detonated in accordance with
 this Section, measured at subgrade level. The number of cubic yards of excavation required by
 the Resident to inspect the depth of shattered and rearranged rock, computed at a maximum
 width of 30 inches will be measured for payment as Structural Earth Excavation – Drainage and
 Minor Structures Below Grade.
 When Structural Rock Excavation – Drainage and Minor Structures, and Drilling and Blasting
 of Solid Rock Subgrade occur at the same location, measurement and payment for Structural
 Rock Excavation - Drainage and Minor Structures will be made for the required trench. This
 area will not be included in the measurement and payment for Drilling and Blasting of Solid
 Rock Subgrade.
 Controlled Blasting shall be paid by the linear foot of presplitting holes and extra drilled holes
 without explosives, measured from the top of the drill hole at the rock surface to the bottom of
 the hole or to the elevation of the required subgrade (whichever is higher) or to an established
 bench elevation. Portions of holes not meeting the requirements of Subsection 8 will not be
 measured. Production holes will not be measured. Presplitting holes and extra drilled holes
 without explosives drilled where presplitting is not required by this specification will not be
 measured. Where presplitting is required, excavated rock will be paid only to the slope and
 depth lines shown on the plans or as ordered by the Resident. Where the Resident determines
 that the removal of additional rock is necessary due to conditions clearly not attributable to the
 Contractor’s methods of operations, the payment lines will be adjusted to the limits ordered, to
 include only rock actually removed within such limits.
 203.19 Basis of Payment The accepted quantity of excavation and borrow will be paid for at
 the contract unit price per cubic yard for each of the pay items included in the Schedule of Items.
 Payment shall be full compensation for obtaining borrow when required and for excavating,
 loading, hauling, placing, grading and compacting all material necessary for the formation of
 embankments. It shall also include full compensation for disposing of unsuitable and surplus
 material when necessary. It shall also include excavation in embankments for determining
 compaction density.

 206.01 Description This work shall consist of excavating, hauling and backfilling or
 disposing of all material encountered for the installation and construction of drainage and minor
 structures and for major structures in accordance with these specifications and in reasonably
 
 2-34
 
 close conformity with the lines, grade and typical cross sections shown on the plans or
 established. Excavating for structures below designated excavation limits as specified or shown
 on the plans will be included under this Section. Material, which is required to be excavated
 under another item, shall not be included under this item.
 Ditches at inlets and outlets of culverts, special ditches and outlet ditches, all as shown on
 the plans, shall be constructed and paid for under Section 203 - Excavation and Embankment.
 a. Drainage and Minor Structures shall include pipe culverts, pipe arches, underdrains,
 catch basins, manholes, structural plate units, box culverts, culvert end walls, concrete steps
 and other minor structures.
 b. Major Structures shall include abutments and piers for bridges, rigid frame structures,
 and masonry retaining walls.
 c. Special backfill shall consist of obtaining, hauling, and placing selected material
 suitable for the location where it is to be used. Structural backfill as a contract item will be
 called for on the plans or in the proposal.
 d. Structural Rock Excavation shall consist of removing hard igneous, metamorphic and
 sedimentary rock which cannot be excavated without drilling and blasting or drilling and
 splitting and all boulders, solid mortared stone masonry, concrete masonry, each having a
 volume of 2 cubic yards or more.
 206.02 Construction Methods The Contractor shall notify the Resident a sufficient length of
 time in advance of the beginning of structural excavation so that necessary elevations and
 measurements may be taken of the undisturbed ground. When solid rock is encountered which
 is to be removed, the Contractor shall uncover the rock and provide ample opportunity for the
 Resident to take the necessary measurements of the undisturbed rock. Soil erosion control
 devices shall be in place at this time.
 When the foundation material is soft or otherwise unsatisfactory the excavation shall be
 carried to a depth designated and the material removed below the elevation shown on the plan
 and shall be replaced with approved granular material, thoroughly compacted, or a lower
 elevation for the bottom of the structure shall be established.
 Suitable material removed from the excavation area including that material removed from
 beyond the specified excavation pay limits shall be used for backfilling or for the formation of
 embankments and no additional allowances for payment will be made. Unsuitable or surplus
 material shall be disposed of as directed.
 When the foundation is to be placed on solid rock, the rock shall be excavated to a firm
 surface, either level stepped or serrated. When solid or disintegrated rock or boulders are
 encountered, the rock shall be excavated to a designated depth below the bottom of the proposed
 
 2-35
 
 structures. Except for installations of underdrain, the material so removed shall be replaced with
 selected fine compressible material such as sand and uniformly compacted and shaped in
 accordance with Section 603.04 - Bedding.
 When the structure is to rest on an excavated surface other than rock, special care shall be
 taken not to disturb the bottom of the excavation. If the surface upon which the structure is to
 rest is disturbed, it shall be regraded and recompacted to the extent directed by the Resident.
 After each excavation is completed, the Contractor shall notify the Resident and no culverts
 or masonry shall be placed, foundation piles driven or other installations made, until the depth of
 the excavation and the character of the foundation material has been approved.
 Before drainage or underdrain pipe is installed in cut areas where common excavation,
 unclassified excavation or muck excavation is removed below the subgrade elevation shown on
 the plans, the undercut roadbed shall be filled with approved granular material to a depth
 sufficient to support construction equipment. All fill material shall be compacted as required.
 206.03 Backfilling Backfilling shall consist of placing suitable material in all spaces
 excavated and not occupied by drainage structures, bridge structures and other permanent
 structures up to the elevation of the existing ground or other elevations shown on the plans or
 designated. Except for underdrain backfill and for structural plate pipe units, backfill material
 for drainage and minor structures shall be fine readily compressible soil or granular material, at
 or near optimum moisture content, and shall not contain stones larger than 3 inches, frozen
 lumps, chunks of clay, mineral matter or any other objectionable material. Backfill material for
 major structures shall be granular borrow or other material designated on the plans and shall be
 at or near optimum moisture content and shall not contain stones larger than 3 inches, frozen
 lumps, chunks of clay, mineral matter or any other objectionable matter.
 Backfill shall not be placed against gravity sections of any structure, including those
 comprised of masonry and/or concrete, until the structure has been in place for at least 7 days or
 until mortar and/or concrete cubes/cylinders cured with the structure establish that design
 strength has been reached. For structures other than gravity structures that require reinforcing
 steel designed to resist applied dead and live loads, no backfill shall be placed against the
 structure until the concrete has been in place for at least 14 days or until concrete cylinders cured
 with the structure establish that the design strength has been reached. Backfilling around pipes,
 catch basins and manholes, the joints of which are made with Portland cement mortar, shall not
 be done until the mortar has been in place at least 12 hours unless methods approved by the
 Resident are used to protect the mortar from being disturbed.
 Except for structural plate units, backfill material shall be uniformly distributed in layers of
 not more than 8 inches in depth, loose measure, and each layer thoroughly compacted by use of
 approved compactors before successive layers are placed. When backfill is being placed around
 a pipe or structure, operations shall be so conducted that the fill is always at approximately the
 same elevation on both sides. Water shall be added when necessary to increase the moisture
 content of the backfill material to obtain compaction. Puddling or jetting of backfill will not be
 
 2-36
 
 allowed unless specifically provided in the contract. Structural plate units shall be backfilled in
 accordance with Section 509 - Structural Plate Pipes, Pipe Arches, Arches, and Metal Box
 Culverts.
 Unless otherwise indicated on the plans or directed, all sheeting and bracing used during
 structural excavation shall be removed by the Contractor following the completion of the work,
 and all voids resulting from use of the sheeting and bracing backfilled where necessary.
 206.04 Method of Measurement Structural excavation will be measured by the number of
 cubic yards of material removed, measured in its original position acceptably excavated in
 conformity with the plans or as directed.
 When structures are to be installed where roadway excavation is to be removed, only the
 excavation beyond and below the roadway excavation limits will be classified as structural
 excavation.
 a. Drainage and Minor Structures For these structures there will be no measurement for
 structural earth excavation except excavation required below a plane parallel with and 12
 inches below the bottom of the aforementioned structures, as shown on the plans, hereafter
 called Structural Earth Excavation, Below Grade. When measured for payment, the quantity
 of Structural Earth Excavation, Below Grade, will be the amount actually excavated,
 provided the maximum allowable horizontal dimensions do not exceed those bounded by
 vertical surfaces 15 inches from the structure, except 18 inches out-side the lines of the base

 304.03 Placing The maximum compacted thickness of any base or subbase course layer
 shall not exceed 12 inches unless the Contractor demonstrates by a test section that the required
 compaction can be obtained. If compacted layers more than 12 inches are allowed, the
 Contractor shall agree to make the necessary excavations and backfilling in the course for the
 Resident to determine the density.
 When layers are constructed of differently graded aggregate, fine grading of the lower layer
 will not be required except when millings are placed as the upper most layer. In this case the
 coarse graded base layer shall be fine graded to +/- ¾ inch and compacted to the required
 specification prior to placing the layer of millings. The layer of millings shall then be placed,
 shaped, and compacted within the tolerances specified below.
 Each layer of aggregate shall be placed over the full width of the section except, the Resident
 may authorize the Contractor to place less than full width layers, when existing traffic or other
 conditions restrict operations over the full width of the section. When the Contractor places
 material to complete the full width, the exposed edge of the previously placed aggregate shall be
 cleaned of all contamination before additional base or subbase aggregate is placed adjacent to it.
 Aggregate base and subbase courses may be placed upon frozen surfaces when such surfaces
 have been properly constructed.
 The material as spread shall be well mixed with no pockets of either fine or coarse material.
 Segregation of large or fine particles will not be allowed.
 304.04 Shaping, Compacting and Stabilizing Compaction of each layer of base and subbase
 shall continue until a density of not less than 95% of the maximum density has been achieved
 for the full width and depth of the layer. The maximum density shall be determined in
 accordance with AASHTO T180, Method C or D, correcting for oversize particles according to
 AASHTO T 224 except mixtures may have 40 percent or less retained on the ¾ inch sieve. (An
 Adjustment Chart/Spreadsheet for this correction is available upon request). Field density tests
 will be performed by the Department in accordance with AASHTO T 310.
 Compaction of each layer of base or subbase material that exceeds 40 percent retained on the
 ¾ inch sieve shall continue until a density of not less than 98% of the maximum density has
 been achieved for the full width and depth of the layer. Density tests and the maximum density
 determined by a field proctor shall be performed by the Department.
 The surface, compaction and stability, shall be satisfactorily maintained until the pavement
 course has been placed. If required, additional water and fine material shall be applied to
 prevent checking, raveling or rutting.
 If the top of any layer becomes contaminated by degradation of the aggregate or addition of
 foreign material, the contaminated material shall be removed and replaced with the specified
 material.
 
 3-2
 
 All layers of base and subbase course shall be compacted to the required density
 immediately after placing. As soon as the compaction of any layer has been completed, the next
 layer shall be placed unless otherwise authorized.
 The Contractor shall bear full responsibility for and make all necessary repairs to the subbase
 course and the subgrade until the full depth of the subbase course is placed and compacted.
 Repairs shall be considered incidental to other contract items.
 The top of any base or subbase course layer shall be scarified and loosened for a minimum
 depth of 1 inch immediately prior to the placing of the next layer of aggregate base or subbase.
 This scarifying shall be considered incidental to placing the course, and no separate payment
 will be made.
 The surface of each layer shall be maintained during compaction operations in such a
 manner that a uniform texture is produced and the aggregate firmly keyed. The moisture content
 of the material shall be maintained at the proper percent to attain the required compaction and
 stability.
 If voids remain on the surface after the subbase course has been constructed to grade,
 compacted, checked and approved, sand-leveling material shall be dumped and spread as
 directed. The quantity of sand leveling material shall be limited to the amount necessary to fill
 the voids and the minor low areas on the subbase surface. After the sand leveling material has
 been spread, it shall be completely rolled by a rubber-tired roller with water applied, if
 necessary. The surface of this material shall be maintained in its compacted and graded
 condition until the hot mix asphalt pavement has been placed. The furnishing, spreading,
 compacting and maintaining of sand leveling material will be considered included in the
 measurement and payment of the subbase course and no separate payment will be made.
 If the Contractor wishes to route public traffic over the completed Aggregate Subbase Course
 for a period of time greater than 48 hours, the Aggregate Subbase Course shall be constructed
 with a minimum 2 inch surcharge above the design grade. Whenever the surcharge is used, it
 shall be constructed with material meeting the requirements of Section 703.06(b), Type D
 Aggregate. Also, whenever, the surcharge is used, it shall be placed on all the Aggregate
 Subbase Course subjected to public traffic. When the surcharge is removed, it may be placed in
 driveways, sidewalks, approach roads, or the outer portions of the shoulders. Removal of the
 surcharge shall be followed immediately in succession by the fine grading of the aggregate
 subbase and construction of the next course.
 The furnishing, placing, maintaining, and removal of the surcharge will not be paid for directly,
 but will be considered incidental to the Aggregate Subbase Course pay item.
 304.05 Surface Tolerance The completed surface of the subbase or base course shall be
 shaped and maintained to a tolerance, above or below the required cross sectional shape, of ⅜
 inch.

 308.06 Pulverizing The entire depth of existing pavement shall be pulverized together with
 approximately 1 inch or more of the underlying gravel into a homogenous mass. All pulverizing
 shall be done with equipment that will provide a homogenous mass of pulverized material,
 processed in-place, which will pass a 2 in square mesh sieve.
 308.07 Weather Limitations When Portland cement is used, full depth recycled work shall
 be performed when;
 A. Cement stabilizing operations will be allowed between May 15th and September 15th
 inclusive in Zone 1 - Areas north of US Route 2 from Gilead to Bangor and north of
 Route 9 from Bangor to Calais. Cement stabilizing will be allowed between May 1st
 and September 30th inclusive in Zone 2 - Areas south of Zone 1 including the US
 Route 2 and Route 9 boundaries.
 b. The atmospheric temperature, as determined by an approved thermometer placed in
 the shade at the recycling location, is 50°F and rising.
 c. When there is no standing water on the surface.
 d. During generally dry conditions, or when weather conditions are such that proper
 pulverizing, adding, mixing, and curing can be obtained using proper procedures, and
 when compaction can be accomplished as determined by the Resident.
 e. When the surface is not frozen and when overnight temperatures are expected to be
 above 32°F.
 f. Wind conditions as such that the spreading of cement on the roadway ahead of the
 recycling machine will not adversely affect the operation (cement will not be blown
 away).
 308.08 Surface Tolerance The complete surface of the Full Depth Reclamation course shall
 be shaped and maintained to a tolerance, above or below the required cross sectional shape, of ⅜
 inch.
 308.09 Full Depth Recycling Procedure New aggregate or recycled material meeting the
 requirements of Section 308.021 - New Aggregate and Additional Recycled Material shall be
 added as necessary to restore cross-slope and/or grade before pulverizing. Locations will be
 shown on the plans or described in the construction notes; the Resident may add other locations
 while construction of the project is in progress. The Contractor will use recycled material to the
 extent it is available, in lieu of new aggregate. The material shall then be pulverized, processed,
 
 3-10
 
 and blended into a homogeneous mass passing a 2 in square mesh sieve. Material found not
 pulverized down to a 2 in size will be required to be reprocessed by the recycler with successive
 passes until approved by the Resident.
 Should the Contractor be required to add new aggregate or recycled material to restore crossslope and/or grade after the initial pulverizing process, those areas will require re-processing to
 blend into a homogenous mass passing a 2 in square mesh sieve.
 The resultant material shall be graded and compacted to the cross-slope and profile shown on
 the plans or as directed by the Resident. The Contractor will also be responsible for reestablishing the existing profile grade. The completed surface of the full depth recycled course
 shall be shaped and maintained to a tolerance, above or below the required cross sectional shape,
 of ⅜ inch. The initial reclaiming process density requirements will be the same as Section
 308.101 unless otherwise directed by the Resident.
 Following completion of the initial reclaiming process cement shall be spread uniformly over
 the full width of roadway to be recycled just prior to each pass of the stabilizing operation, in a
 continuous process by means of a mechanical spreader. Dry stabilizing agents shall be spread at
 the prescribed rate in the mix design as provided by the Department. These additives shall then
 be uniformly blended into a homogeneous mass until an apparent uniform distribution has
 occurred. The Resident may adjust the rate of application as necessary.
 Sufficient water shall be added through the recycler head during the recycling process to ensure
 thorough blending to meet the optimum moisture for compaction as specified. Water shall be
 added only by means of a controlled system on the recycling machine. Care shall be taken to
 prevent excessive wetting. A second water truck may be required during recycling operations to
 assist in the compaction and water control efforts. The rate of water supplied shall be kept
 constant unless changed due to project material changes.
 The resultant material shall be graded and compacted to the cross-slope and profile shown on
 the plans or as directed by the Resident. The Contractor will also be responsible for reestablishing the existing profile grade. The completed surface of the full depth recycled course
 shall be shaped and maintained to a tolerance, above or below the required cross sectional shape,
 of ⅜ in. Areas not meeting this tolerance will be repaired as described in Section 308.091.
 After compaction, the roadway surface shall be treated with a light application of water, and
 rolled with pneumatic-tired rollers to create a close-knit texture. The finished layer shall be free
 from:
 A. Surface laminations,
 B. Segregation of fine and coarse aggregate,
 C. Corrugations, centerline differential, potholes, or any other defects that may adversely
 affect the performance of the layer.
 The Contractor shall protect and maintain the recycled layer until a lift of pavement is
 applied. Frequent light watering shall be performed to keep the finished cement stabilized
 
 3-11
 
 material moist for at least 48 hours. Watering will continue from 48 hours to 1 week if the
 equipment is available on-site. Any damage or defects in the layer shall be repaired immediately.
 An even and uniform surface shall be maintained. The recycled surface shall be swept prior to
 hot mix asphalt placement.
 308.091 Repairs Repairs and maintenance of the recycled layers, during and after the curing
 period, resulting from damage caused by traffic, weather or environmental conditions, or
 resulting from damage caused by the Contractor’s operations or equipment, shall be completed
 at no additional cost to the Department.
 Low areas will be repaired using a hot mix asphalt shim. Areas up to 1 in high can be repaired
 by either milling the high area or shimming the low areas adjacent to the high area with hot mix
 asphalt areas greater than 1 in high will be repaired by shimming the low areas adjacent to the
 high area with hot mix asphalt. All repair work will be done with the Resident’s approval at the
 Contractor’s expense.

 At the time of JMF submittal, the Contractor shall identify and make available the stockpiles of
 all proposed aggregates at the plant site. There must be a minimum of 150 ton for stone
 stockpiles, 75 ton for sand stockpiles, and 50 ton of blend sand before the Department will
 sample. The Department shall obtain samples for laboratory testing. The Contractor shall also
 make available to the Department the PGAB proposed for use in the mix in sufficient quantity to
 test the properties of the asphalt and to produce samples for testing of the mixture. Before the
 start of paving, the Contractor and the Department shall split a production sample for evaluation.
 The Contractor shall test its split of the sample and determine if the results meet the
 requirements of the Department’s written policy for mix design verification (See MaineDOT
 Policies and Procedures for HMA Sampling and Testing available at the Central Laboratory in
 Bangor). If the results are found to be acceptable, the Contractor will forward their results to the
 Department’s Lab, which will test the Department’s split of the sample. The results of the two
 split samples will be compared and shared between the Department and the Contractor. If the
 Department finds the mixture acceptable, an approved JMF will be forwarded to the Contractor
 and paving may commence. The first day’s production shall be monitored, and the approval
 may be withdrawn if the mixture exhibits undesirable characteristics such as checking, shoving
 or displacement.
 The Contractor shall be allowed to submit aim changes within 24 hours of receipt of the first
 Acceptance test result. Should all of the Acceptance samples of a Lot be obtained prior to the
 receipt of the first Acceptance result, the Department will not allow the aim changes to be
 applied to that Lot. Adjustments will be allowed of up to 2% on the percent passing the 2.36 mm
 sieve through the 0.075 mm and 3% on the percent passing the 4.75 mm or larger sieves.
 Adjustments will be allowed on the %PGAB of up to 0.2%. Adjustments will be allowed on
 GMM of up to 0.010.
 The Contractor shall submit a new JMF for approval each time a change in material source or
 materials properties is proposed. The same approval process shall be followed. The cold feed
 percentage of any aggregate may be adjusted up to 10 percentage points from the amount listed
 on the JMF, however no aggregate listed on the JMF shall be eliminated. The cold feed
 percentage for RAP may be reduced up to 10 percentage points from the amount listed on the
 
 4-2
 
 JMF and shall not exceed the percentage of RAP approved in the JMF or for the specific
 application under any circumstances.

 Sections, shall be waived: 108.1.3 a., 108.1.3 b., 108.1.3 c., and 108.1.3 d. The automatic
 printed ticket will be considered as the Weight Certificate.
 The requirements of Section 108.1.3 f. - Delivery Slips, shall be met by the weigh slip or ticket,
 printed by the automatic system, which accompanies each truckload, except for the following
 changes:
 a. The quantity information required shall be individual weights of each batch or total
 net weight of each truckload.
 b. Signatures (legible initials acceptable) of Weighmaster (required only in the event of
 a malfunction as described in 401.074 c.).
 c. The MaineDOT designation for the JMF.
 
 4-5
 
 401.074 Weight Checks on Automatic HMA Plant At least twice during each 5 days of
 production either of the following checks will be performed:
 a. A loaded truck may be intercepted and weighed on a platform scale that has been
 sealed by the State Sealer of Weights and Measures within the past 12 months. The
 inspector will notify the producer to take corrective action on any discrepancy over 1.0%.
 The producer may continue to operate for 48 hours under the following conditions.
 1. If the discrepancy does not exceed 1.5%; payment will still be governed by
 the printed ticket.
 2. If the discrepancy exceeds 1.5%, the plant will be allowed to operate as long
 as payment is determined by truck platform scale net weight.
 If, after 48 hours the discrepancy has not been addressed and reduced below 1.0%, than
 plant operations will cease. Plant operation may resume after the discrepancy has been
 brought within 1.0%.
 b. Where platform scales are not readily available, a check will be made to verify the
 accuracy and sensitivity of each scale within the normal weighing range and to assure
 that the interlocking devices and automatic printer system are functioning properly.
 c. In the event of a malfunction of the automatic printer system, production may be
 continued without the use of platform truck scales for a period not to exceed the next two
 working days, providing total weights of each batch are recorded on weight tickets and
 certified by a Licensed Public Weighmaster.
 401.08 Hauling Equipment Trucks for hauling Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement shall have tight,
 clean, and smooth metal dump bodies, which have been thinly coated with a small amount of
 approved release agent to prevent the mixture from adhering to the bodies. Solvent based agents
 developed to strip asphalts from aggregates will not be allowed as release agents.
 All truck dump bodies shall have a cover of canvas or other water repellent material capable of
 heat retention, which completely covers the mixture. The cover shall be securely fastened on the
 truck, unless unloading.

 to place Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement over the full width of the mainline travel way with a 10 ft
 minimum main screed with activated extensions.
 
 4-6
 
 The Contractor shall place Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement on the main line with a paver using an
 automatic grade and slope controlled screed, unless otherwise authorized by the Department.
 The controls shall automatically adjust the screed and increase or decrease the layer thickness to
 compensate for irregularities in the preceding course. The controls shall maintain the proper
 transverse slope and be readily adjustable so that transitions and superelevated curves can be
 properly paved. The controls shall operate from a fixed or moving reference such as a grade
 wire or ski type device (floating beam) with a minimum length of 30 ft, a non-contact grade
 control with a minimum span of 24 ft, except that a 40 ft reference shall be used on Expressway
 projects.
 The Contractor shall operate the paver in such a manner as to produce a visually uniform surface
 texture and a thickness within the requirements of Section 401.101 - Surface Tolerances. The
 paver shall have a receiving hopper with sufficient capacity for a uniform spreading operation
 and a distribution system to place the mixture uniformly, without segregation in front of the
 screed. The screed assembly shall produce a finished surface of the required evenness and
 texture without tearing, shoving, or gouging the mixture. Pavers with extendible screeds shall
 have auger extensions and tunnel extenders as per the manufacturer’s recommendations, a copy
 of which shall be available if requested.
 The Contractor shall have the paver at the project site sufficiently before the start of paving
 operations to be inspected and approved by the Department. The Contractor shall repair or
 replace any paver found worn or defective, either before or during placement, to the satisfaction
 of the Department. Pavers that produce an unevenly textured or non-uniform mat will be
 repaired or replaced before continuing to place HMA on MaineDOT projects.
 On a daily basis, the Contractor shall perform density testing across the mat being placed, prior to
 being compacted by equipment at 12 in intervals. If the density values vary by more than 2.0%
 from the mean, the Contractor shall make adjustments to the screed until the inconsistencies are
 remedied.
 Failure to replace or repair defective placement equipment may result in a letter of suspension of
 work and notification of a quality control violation resulting in possible monetary penalties as
 governed by Section 106 - Quality
 401.10 Rollers Rollers shall be static steel, pneumatic tire, oscillatory, or approved vibrator
 type. Rollers shall be in good mechanical condition, capable of starting and stopping smoothly,
 and be free from backlash when reversing direction. Rollers shall be equipped and operated in
 such a way as to prevent the picking up of hot mixed material by the roller surface. The use of
 rollers, which result in crushing of the aggregate or in displacement of the HMA will not be
 permitted. Any Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement that becomes loose, broken, contaminated, shows an
 excess or deficiency of Performance Graded Asphalt Binder, or is in any other way defective
 shall be removed and replaced at no additional cost with fresh Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement,
 which shall be immediately compacted to conform to the adjacent area.
 
 4-7
 
 The Contractor shall repair or replace any roller found to be worn or defective, either before or
 during placement, to the satisfaction of the Department. Rollers that produce grooved, unevenly
 textured or non-uniform mat will be repaired or replaced before continuing to place HMA on
 MaineDOT projects. The type of rollers to be used and their relative position in the compaction
 sequence shall generally be the Contractor’s option, provided specification densities are attained
 and with the following requirements:
 a. On variable-depth courses, the first lift of pavement over gravel, reclaimed pavement,
 on irregular or milled surfaces, or on bridges, at least one roller shall be 16 ton
 pneumatic-tired. Unless otherwise allowed by the Resident, pneumatic-tired rollers shall
 be equipped with skirting to minimize the pickup of HMA materials from the paved
 surface. When required by the Resident, the roller shall be ballasted to 20 ton.
 b. Compaction with a vibratory or steel wheel roller shall precede pneumatic-tired
 rolling, unless otherwise authorized by the Department.
 c. Vibratory rollers shall not be operated in the vibratory mode when checking or
 cracking of the mat occurs, or on bridge decks.
 d. Any method, which results in cracking or checking of the mat, will be discontinued
 and corrective action taken.
 e. The use of an oscillating steel roller shall be required to compact all mixtures placed
 on bridge decks.
 The maximum operating speed for a steel wheel or pneumatic roller shall not exceed the
 manufacturer’s recommendations, a copy of which shall be available if requested.

 upon which Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement is to be placed of all objectionable material. When the
 surface of the existing base or pavement is irregular, the Contractor shall bring it to uniform
 grade and cross section. All surfaces shall have a tack coat applied prior to placing any new
 
 4-8
 
 HMA course. Tack coat shall conform to the requirements of Section 409 – Bituminous Tack
 Coat, Section 702 – Bituminous Material, and all applicable sections of the contract.
 401.12 Hot Mix Asphalt Documentation The Contractor and the Department shall agree on
 the amount of Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement that has been placed each day. All delivery slips shall
 conform to the requirements of 401.073.
 401.13 Preparation of Aggregates The Contractor shall dry and heat the aggregates for the
 HMA to the required temperature. The Contractor shall properly adjust flames to avoid physical
 damage to the aggregate and to avoid depositing soot on the aggregate.
 401.14 Mixing The Contractor shall combine the dried aggregate in the mixer in the amount
 of each fraction of aggregate required to meet the JMF. The Contractor shall measure the
 amount of PGAB and introduce it into the mixer in the amount specified by the JMF.
 The Contractor shall produce the HMA at the temperature established by the JMF.
 The Contractor shall dry the aggregate sufficiently so that the HMA will not flush, foam
 excessively, or displace excessively under the action of the rollers. The Contractor shall
 introduce the aggregate into the mixer at a temperature of not more than 25°F above the
 temperature at which the viscosity of the PGAB being used is 0.150 Pa s.
 The Contractor shall store and introduce into the mixer the Performance Graded Asphalt Binder
 at a uniformly maintained temperature at which the viscosity of the PGAB is between 0.150
 Pa s and 0.300 Pa s. The aggregate shall be coated completely and uniformly with a thorough
 distribution of the PGAB. The Contractor shall determine the wet mixing time for each plant
 and for each type of aggregate used. The resultant material shall be a uniformly blended,
 homogenous HMA mixture.
 401.15 Spreading and Finishing On areas where irregularities or unavoidable obstacles
 make the use of mechanical spreading and finishing equipment impracticable, the Contractor
 shall spread, rake, and lute the HMA with hand tools to provide the required compacted
 thickness. Solvent based agents developed to strip asphalts from aggregates will not be allowed
 as release agents.
 On roadways with adjoining lanes carrying traffic, the Contractor shall place each course over
 the full width of the traveled way section being paved that day, unless otherwise noted by the
 Department in Section 403 - Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement.
 In addition, hot mix asphalt pavement placed on bridges shall also conform to Section 508.04
 and the following requirements.
 a. The bottom course shall be placed with an approved rubber mounted paver of such
 type and operated in such a manner that the membrane waterproofing will not be
 damaged in any way.
 
 4-9
 
 b. The top course shall not be placed until the bottom course has cooled sufficiently to
 provide stability.
 c. The Contractor will not be required to cut sample cores from the compacted
 pavement on the bridge deck, unless otherwise directed by Special Provision.
 d. After the top course has been placed, the shoulder areas shall be sealed 3 ft wide with
 two applications of an emulsified bituminous sealer meeting the requirements of
 Section 612.03 – Sealing and Section 702.12 - Emulsified Bituminous Sealing
 Compound. The first application shall be pre-mixed with fine, sharp sand, similar to
 mortar sand, as needed to fill all voids in the mix in the area being sealed. The
 second application may be applied without sand. The sealer shall be carried to the
 curb at the gutter line in sufficient quantity to leave a bead or fillet of material at the
 face of the curb. The area to be sealed shall be clean, dry and the surface shall be at
 ambient temperature.
 e. The furnishing and applying of the required quantity of sealer for the bridge shoulder
 areas shall be incidental to placing the hot mix asphalt pavement.
 f. The atmospheric temperature for all courses placed on bridge decks shall be 50°F or
 higher.
 401.16 Compaction Immediately after the Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement has been spread,
 struck off, and any surface irregularities adjusted, the Contractor shall thoroughly and uniformly
 compact the HMA by rolling.
 The Contractor shall roll the surface when the mixture is in the proper condition and when the
 rolling does not cause undue displacement, cracking, or shoving. The Contractor shall prevent
 adhesion of the HMA to the rollers or vibrating compactors without the use of fuel oil or other
 petroleum based release agents. Solvents designed to strip asphalt binders from aggregates will
 not be permitted as release agents on equipment, tools, or pavement surfaces.
 The Contractor shall immediately correct any displacement occurring as a result of the reversing
 of the direction of a roller or from other causes to the satisfaction of the Department. Any
 operation other than placement of variable depth shim course that results in breakdown of the
 aggregate shall be discontinued. Any new pavement that shows obvious cracking, checking, or
 displacement shall be removed and replaced for the full lane width as directed by the Resident at
 no cost to the Department.
 Along forms, curbs, headers, walls, and other places not accessible to the rollers, the Contractor
 shall thoroughly compact the HMA with mechanical vibrating compactors. The Contractor shall
 only use hand tamping in areas inaccessible to all other compaction equipment. On depressed
 areas, the Contractor may use a trench roller or cleated compression strips under a roller to
 transmit compression to the depressed area.
 
 4-10
 
 Any HMA that becomes unacceptable due to cooling, cracking, checking, segregation or
 deformation as a result of an interruption in mix delivery shall be removed and replaced, with
 material that meets contract specifications at no cost to the Department.
 401.17 Joints The Contractor shall construct wearing course transverse and longitudinal
 joints in such a manner that minimum tolerances shown in Section 401.101 - Surface Tolerances
 are met when measured with a straightedge.
 The paver shall maintain a uniform head of HMA during transverse and longitudinal joint
 construction.
 The HMA shall be free of segregation and meet temperature requirements outlined in section
 401.04. Transverse joints of the wearing course shall be straight and neatly trimmed. The
 Contractor may form a vertical face exposing the full depth of the course by inserting a header,
 by breaking the bond with the underlying course, or by cutting back with hand tools. The
 Department may allow feathered or "lap" joints on lower base courses or when matching
 existing base type pavements.
 Longitudinal joints shall be generally straight to the line of travel, and constructed in a manner
 that best ensure joint integrity. Methods or activities that prove detrimental to the construction
 of straight, sound longitudinal joints will be discontinued.
 The Contractor shall apply a coating of emulsified asphalt immediately before paving all joints
 to the vertical face and 3 in of the adjacent portion of any pavement being overlaid except those
 formed by pavers operating in echelon. The Contractor shall use an approved spray apparatus
 designed for covering a narrow surface. The Department may approve application by a brush for
 small surfaces, or in the event of a malfunction of the spray apparatus, but for a period of not
 more than one working day.
 Where pavement under this contract joins an existing pavement, or when the Department
 directs, the Contractor shall cut the existing pavement along a smooth line, producing a neat,
 even, vertical joint. The Department will not permit broken or raveled edges. The cost of all
 work necessary for the preparation of joints is incidental to related contract pay items.
 401.18 Quality Control Method A, B & C The Contractor shall operate in accordance with
 the approved Quality Control Plan (QCP) to assure a product meeting the contract requirements.
 The QCP shall meet the requirements of Section 106.6 - Acceptance and this Section. The
 Contractor shall not begin paving operations until the Department approves the QCP in writing.
 Prior to placing any mix, the Department and the Contractor shall hold a Pre-paving conference
 to discuss the paving schedule, source of mix, type and amount of equipment to be used,
 sequence of paving pattern, rate of mix supply, random sampling, project lots and sublots and
 traffic control. A copy of the QC random numbers to be used on the project shall be provided to
 The Resident. The Departments’ random numbers for Acceptance testing shall be generated and
 
 4-11
 
 on file with the Resident and the Project Manager. All personnel of the Department and the
 Contractor who have significant information relevant to the paving items shall attend, including
 the responsible onsite paving supervisor for the Contractor. The Resident will prepare minutes
 of the conference and distribute them to all attendees. Any requests to revise the minutes must
 be made to the Resident within 7 Days of Receipt. These minutes will constitute the final record
 of the Pre-paving conference.
 
 4-12

 documents to produce or monitor the production of the mix, subject to approval by the
 Department.
 The Contractor shall submit all Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement plant test reports, inspection reports
 and updated pay factors in writing, signed by the appropriate technician and present them to the
 Department by 1:00 P.M. on the next working day, except when otherwise noted in the QCP due to
 local restrictions. The Contractor shall also retain splits of the previous 5 QC tests, with QC
 results enclosed for random selection and testing by The Department during QA inspections of the
 HMA production facility. Test results of splits that do not meet the Dispute Resolution Variance
 Limits in Table 10 shall trigger an investigation by the MaineDOT Independent Assurance Unit,
 and may result in that lab losing NETTCP certification and the ability to request a dispute [Section
 401.223 - Process for Dispute Resolution (Methods A , B and C only)].
 The Contractor shall make density test results, including randomly sampled densities, available to

 The Contractor shall cease paving operations whenever one of the following occurs on a lot in
 progress:
 a. Method A: The Pay Factor for VMA, Voids @ Nd, Percent PGAB, composite
 gradation, VFB, fines to effective binder or density using all Acceptance or all Quality
 Control tests for the current lot is less than 0.85.
 b. Method B: The Pay Factor for VMA, Voids @ Nd, Percent PGAB, composite
 gradation, VFB, fines to effective binder or density using all Acceptance or all Quality
 Control tests for the current lot is less than 0.90.
 c. Method C: The Pay Factor for VMA, Voids @ Nd, Percent PGAB, percent passing the
 nominal maximum sieve, percent passing 2.36 mm sieve, percent passing 0.300 mm
 sieve, percent passing 0.075 mm sieve or density using all Acceptance or all available
 Quality Control tests for the current lot is less than 0.85.
 d. The Coarse Aggregate Angularity or Fine Aggregate Angularity value falls below the
 requirements of Table 3: Aggregate Consensus Properties Criteria in Section 703.07
 for the design traffic level.
 e. Each of the first 2 control tests for a Method A or B lot fall outside the upper or lower
 limits for VMA, Voids @ Nd, or Percent PGAB; or under Method C, each of the first 2
 control tests for the lot fall outside the upper or lower limits for the nominal maximum,
 2.36 mm, 0.300 mm or 0.075 mm sieves, or percent PGAB.
 f. The Flat and Elongated Particles value exceeds 10% by ASTM D4791.
 g. There is any visible damage to the aggregate due to over-densification other than on
 variable depth shim courses.
 h. The Contractor fails to follow the approved QCP.
 The Contractor shall notify the Resident in writing as to the reason for shutdown, as well as the
 proposed corrective action, by the end of the work day. Failure to do so will be treated as a second
 incident under 106.4.6 QCP Non-compliance. The Department will consider corrective action
 
 4-16
 
 acceptable if the pay factor for the failing property increases, based on samples already in transit, or
 a verification sample is tested and the property falls within the specification limits.
 In cases where the corrective action can be accomplished immediately, such as batch weight or
 cold feed changes, the Contractor may elect to resume production once the corrective action is
 completed. Additional QC testing shall be performed to verify the effectiveness of the corrective
 action. Subsequent occurrences of shutdown for the same property in a Lot in progress will require
 paving operations to cease. Paving operations shall not resume until the Contactor and the
 Department determines that material meeting the Contract requirements will be produced. The
 Department may allow the Contractor to resume production based upon a passing QC sample, with
 a split of the sample being sent to the Department for verification testing. If the submitted
 verification sample test results fall outside the specification limits, the Contractor shall cease
 production until a verification sample is submitted to the Department has been tested by the
 Department and found to be within specification limits.
 If the Contractor’s control chart shows the process to be out of control (defined as a single point
 outside of the control limits on the running average of three chart) on any property listed in Table
 3: Control Limits, the Contractor shall notify the Resident in writing of any proposed corrective
 action by 1:00 PM the next working day.
 The Department retains the exclusive right, with the exception of the first day’s production of a
 new JMF, to determine whether the resumption of production involves a significant change to the
 production process. If the Department so determines, then the current lot will be terminated, a pay
 factor established, and a new lot will begin.
 401.19 Quality Control Method D For Items covered under Method D, the Contractor shall
 submit a modified QC Plan detailing, how the mix is to be placed, what equipment is to be used,
 and what HMA plant is to be used. All mix designs (JMF) shall be approved and verified by
 MaineDOT prior to use. Certified QC personnel shall not be required. The Contractor shall certify
 the mix and the test results for each item by a Certificate of Compliance.
 401.20 Acceptance Method A, B & C These methods utilizes Quality Level Analysis and pay
 factor specifications. For Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement designated for acceptance under Quality
 Assurance provisions, the Department will sample once per sublot on a statistically random basis,
 test, and evaluate in accordance with the following Acceptance Criteria:

 In the event the Department terminates a Lot prematurely but fails to obtain the
 required number of acceptance samples to calculate the volumetric property pay factor under
 the test method specified in the contract, the pay factor shall be calculated using the number of
 samples actually obtained from the contract. Should the number of acceptance samples taken
 total less than three, the resulting pay factor shall be 1.0 for volumetric properties. A minimum
 of three cores will be used for a density pay factor using the contract’s specified Acceptance
 method, if applicable, for quantities placed to date.
 Should the Contractor request a termination of the Lot in progress prior to three acceptance
 samples being obtained, and the Department agrees to terminate the Lot, then the pay factor for
 mixture properties shall be 0.80. A minimum of three cores will be used to determine a density
 pay factor using the contract’s specified Acceptance method, if applicable, for quantities placed
 to date.
 Lot Size For purposes of evaluating all acceptance test properties, a lot shall consist of the
 total quantity represented by each item listed under the lot size heading.
 Sublot size - Refer to section 401.201, 401.202, and 401.203 for minimum size and number
 of sublots. The quantity represented by each sample will constitute a sublot.
 If there is less than one-half of a sublot remaining at the end, then it shall be combined with the
 previous sublot. If there is more than one-half sublot remaining at the end, then it shall
 constitute the last sublot and shall be represented by test results. If it becomes apparent
 partway through a Lot that, due to an underrun, there will be insufficient mix quantity to
 obtain the minimum number of sublots needed, the Resident may adjust the size of the
 remaining sublots and select new sample locations based on the estimated quantity of
 material remaining in the Lot.
 Acceptance Testing The Department will obtain samples of Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement in
 conformance with AASHTO T168 Sampling Bituminous Paving Mixtures, and the
 
 4-18
 
 MaineDOT Policies and Procedures for HMA Sampling and Testing, which will then be
 transported by the Contractor to the designated MaineDOT Laboratory within 48 hours (except
 when otherwise noted in the project specific QCP due to local restrictions), as directed by
 MaineDOT in approved transport containers to be provided by the Department, unless
 otherwise directed by the Resident. Failure to deliver an acceptance sample to the designated
 acceptance laboratory will be considered the second incident under 106.4.6–QCP NonCompliance.
 The Department will take the sample randomly within each sublot. Target values shall be as
 specified in the JMF. The Department will use Table 5 for calculating pay factors for
 gradation, PGAB Content, Air Voids at Ndesign, VMA, Fines to Effective Binder and VFB. The
 Department will withhold reporting of the test results for the Acceptance sample until 7:00
 AM, on the second working day of receipt of the sample, or after receipt of the Contractors
 results of the Acceptance sample split. Upon conclusion of each lot, where there is a minimum
 of four sublots, results shall be examined for statistical outliers, as stated in Section 106.7.2 Statistical Outliers.
 Isolated Areas During the course of inspection, should it appear that there is an isolated area
 that is not representative of the lot based on a lack of observed compactive effort, excessive
 segregation, a change in process or any other questionable practice, that area may be isolated
 and tested separately. An area so isolated that has a calculated pay factor below 0.80 for
 Method A and C or below 0.86 for Method B, based on three random tests shall be removed
 and replaced at the expense of the Contractor for the full lane width and a length not to be less
 than 150 ft.
 Pavement Density The Department will measure pavement density using core samples
 tested according to AASHTO T-166. The Department will randomly determine core
 locations. The Contractor shall cut 6 inch diameter cores at no additional cost to the
 Department by the end of the working day following the day the pavement is placed, and
 immediately give them to the Department. Cores for Acceptance testing shall be cut such
 that the nearest edge is never within 9 inches of any joint. The cores will be placed in a
 transport container provided by the Department and transported by the Contractor to the
 designated MaineDOT Lab as directed by the Department. Pre-testing of the cores will not
 be allowed. At the time of sampling, the Contractor and the Department shall mutually
 determine if a core is damaged. If it is determined that the core(s) is damaged, the
 Contractor shall cut new core(s) at the same offset and within 3 ft of the initial sample. At
 the time the core is cut, the Contractor and the Department will mutually determine if saw
 cutting of the core is needed, and will mark the core at the point where sawing is needed.
 The core may be saw cut by the Contractor in the Department's presence onsite, or in an
 MaineDOT Lab by The Department, without disturbing the layer being tested to remove
 lower layers of Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement, gravel, or RAP. No recuts are allowed at a test
 location after the core has been tested. Upon conclusion of each lot, density results shall be
 examined for statistical outliers as stated in Section 106.7.2.
 
 4-19
 
 On all sections of overlay with wearing courses designed to be 3/4 in or less in thickness, there
 shall be no pay adjustment for density otherwise noted in Section 403 - Hot Mix Asphalt
 Pavement. For overlays designed to be 3/4 in or less in thickness, density shall be obtained by
 the same rolling train and methods as used on mainline travelway surface courses with a pay
 adjustments for density, unless otherwise directed by the Department.
 There shall be no pay adjustment for density on shoulders unless otherwise noted in Section 403
 - Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement. Density for shoulders shall be obtained by the same rolling train
 and methods as used on mainline travelway, unless otherwise directed by the Department.
 Efforts to obtain optimum compaction will not be waived by the Department unless it is
 apparent during construction that local conditions make densification to this point detrimental to
 the finished pavement surface course.
 For 9.5 mm HMA mixtures the following pay adjustment shall also apply:
 The average percent passing for the 0.075 mm sieve shall be evaluated for each Lot. If the
 average is greater than 6.5%, a pay adjustment according to TABLE 4A below shall apply in
 addition to the other pay adjustments for the given method of testing.

 a given Lot is greater than 6.5%. Disputes on the 0.075 mm sieve values shall not be allowed
 for Method A or Method B Lots.
 401.201 Method A Lot Size will be the entire production per JMF for the project, or if so
 agreed at the Pre-paving Conference, equal lots of up to 4500 tons, with unanticipated over-runs of
 up to 1500 ton rolled into the last lot. Sublot sizes shall be 750 ton for mixture properties, 500 ton
 for base or binder densities and 250 ton for surface densities. The minimum number of sublots for
 mixture properties shall be 4, and the minimum number of sublots for density shall be five.

 401.21 Method of Measurement The Department will measure Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement by
 the ton in accordance with Section 108.1 - Measurement of Quantities for Payment.
 401.22 Basis of Payment The Department will pay for the work, in place and accepted, in
 accordance with the applicable sections of this Section, for each type of HMA specified.
 The Department will pay for the work specified in Section 401.11, for the HMA used, except that
 cleaning objectionable material from the pavement and furnishing and applying bituminous
 material to joints and contact surfaces is incidental.
 Payment for this work under the appropriate pay items shall be full compensation for all labor,
 equipment, materials, and incidentals necessary to meet all related contract requirements, including
 design of the JMF, implementation of the QCP, obtaining core samples, transporting cores and
 samples, filling core holes, applying emulsified asphalt to joints, and providing testing facilities
 and equipment.
 The Department will make a pay adjustment for quality as specified below.
 
 4-22
 
 401.221 Pay Adjustment The Department will sample, test, and evaluate Hot Mix Asphalt
 Pavement in accordance with Section 106 - Quality and Section 401.20 - Acceptance, of this
 Specification.
 401.222 Pay Factor (PF) The Department will use the following criteria for pay adjustment
 using the pay adjustment factors under Section 106.7 - Quality Level Analysis:
 Density If the pay factor for Density falls below 0.80 for Method A or C or 0.86 for Method B,
 all of the cores will be randomly re-cut by Sublot. A new pay factor will be calculated that
 combines all initial and retest results. If the resulting pay factor is below 0.80 for Method A or
 C or below 0.86 for Method B, the entire Lot shall be removed and replaced with material
 meeting the specifications at no additional cost to the Department, except that the Department
 may, when it appears that there is a distinct pattern of defective material, isolate any defective
 material by investigating each mix sample sublot and require removal of defective mix sample
 sublots only, leaving any acceptable material in place if it is found to be free of defective
 material. Pay factors equal to or greater than the reject level will be paid accordingly.
 Gradation For HMA evaluated under Acceptance Method A or B, the Department will determine
 a composite pay factor (CPF) using applicable price adjustment factors “f“ from Table 9: Table of
 Gradation Composite “f” Factors, and Acceptance limits from Table 5: Method A Acceptance
 Limits, for Method A or Table 6: Method B Acceptance Limits, for Method B. The Department
 will not make price adjustments for gradation on Methods A and B, but will monitor them as
 shutdown criteria.

 The Department will use the following criteria for pay adjustment: density, Performance Graded
 Asphalt Binder content, voids @Nd, VMA, VFB, F/Beff, and the screen sizes listed in Table 9
 for the type of HMA represented in the JMF. If any single pay factor for PGAB Content, VMA,
 or Air Voids falls below 0.80, then the composite pay factor for PGAB Content, VMA, and Air
 Voids shall be 0.55.
 Density: For mixes having a density requirement, the Department will determine a pay factor
 using Table 5: Method A Acceptance Limits:
 PA = (density PF- 1.0)(Q)(P)x0.50
 PGAB Content, VMA and Air Voids: The Department will determine a pay adjustment using
 Table 5: Method A Acceptance Limits as follows:
 PA = (voids @ Nd PF- 1.0)(Q)(P)x0.20 + (VMA @ Nd PF- 1.0)(Q)(P)x0.20 +
 (PGAB PF- 1.0)(Q)(P)x0.10
 VFB and Fines to Effective Binder The Department will determine a pay factor (PF) using Table
 5: Method A Acceptance Limits. The Department will not make price adjustments for VFB or
 Fines to Effective Binder, but will monitor them as shutdown criteria.
 Pay Adjustment Method B
 The Department will use the following criteria for pay adjustment: density, Performance Graded
 Asphalt Binder content, voids @Nd, VMA, VFB, F/Beff, and the screen sizes listed in Table 9
 for the type of HMA represented in the JMF. If any single pay factor for PGAB Content, VMA,
 or Air Voids falls below 0.86, then the composite pay factor for PGAB Content, VMA, and Air
 Voids shall be 0.70.
 Density: For mixes having a density requirement, the Department will determine a pay factor
 using Table 6: Method B Acceptance Limits:
 PA = (density PF- 1.0)(Q)(P)x0.50
 PGAB Content, VMA and Air Voids: The Department will determine a pay adjustment using
 Table 6: Method B Acceptance Limits as follows:
 PA = (voids @ Nd PF- 1.0)(Q)(P)x0.20 + (VMA @ Nd PF- 1.0)(Q)(P)x0.20 +
 (PGAB PF- 1.0)(Q)(P)x0.10
 
 4-25
 
 VFB and Fines to Effective Binder The Department will determine a pay factor (PF) using Table
 6: Method B Acceptance Limits. The Department will not make price adjustments for VFB or
 Fines to Effective Binder, but will monitor them as shutdown criteria.
 Pay Adjustment Method C
 The Department will use density, Performance Graded Asphalt Binder content, and the percent
 passing the nominal maximum, 2.36 mm, 0.300 mm and 0.075 mm sieves for the type of HMA
 represented in the JMF. If the PGAB content falls below 0.80, then the PGAB pay factor shall
 be 0.55.
 Density: For mixes having a density requirement, the Department will determine a pay factor
 using Table 7: Method C Acceptance Limits:
 PA = (density PF- 1.0)(Q)(P)x0.50
 PGAB Content and Gradation The Department will determine a pay factor using Table 7: Method
 C Acceptance Limits. The Department will calculate the price adjustment for Mixture Properties as
 follows:
 PA = (% Passing Nom. Max PF-1.0)(Q)(P)X0.05+(% passing 2.36 mm PF1.0)(Q)(P)X0.05+(%passing 0.30 mm PF-1.0)(Q)(P)X0.05+(%passing 0.075
 mm PF-1.0)(Q)(P)X0.10+(PGAB PF-1.0)(Q)(P)X0.25
 VMA, Air Voids, VFB and Fines to Effective Binder The Department will determine a pay factor
 (PF) using Table 7: Method C Acceptance Limits. The Department will not make price
 adjustments for VMA, Air Voids, VFB or Fines to Effective Binder, but will monitor them as
 shutdown criteria.
 Pay Adjustment Method D
 The Department will use density, Performance Graded Asphalt Binder content, and the screen
 sizes listed in Table 8b for the type of HMA represented in the JMF. If test results do not meet
 the Table 8 requirements, deducts as shown in Table 8b shall be applied to the quantity of mix
 represented by the test.
 401.223 Process for Dispute Resolution (Methods A B & C only)
 a. Dispute Resolution sampling At the time of Hot-Mix Asphalt sampling, the
 Department will obtain a split sample of each Acceptance test random sample for possible
 
 4-26
 
 dispute resolution testing. The Contractor shall also obtain a split sample of the HMA at this
 same time. If the Contractor wishes to retain the option of requesting dispute testing of the
 initial Acceptance sample, the Contractor will test their split of the
 Acceptance sample and shall report their results to the Resident, with a copy to the QA
 Engineer by 7:00 AM, on the second working day from time of QA sampling, otherwise
 dispute resolution will not be initiated. The Department’s dispute resolution split sample will
 be properly labeled and stored for a period of at least two weeks, or until the sample is
 tested.
 b. Disputing Acceptance results The Contractor may dispute the Department’s
 Acceptance results and request (Methods A, B, & C) that the dispute resolution split sample
 be tested by notifying the Department’s Resident and the QA Engineer in writing within two
 working days after receiving the results of the Acceptance test. The following shall be
 provided in the request:
 
 
 
 
 Acceptance sample reference number
 The specific test result(s) or property(ies) being disputed, and
 The complete, signed report of the Contractor’s testing (In a lab certified by the
 NETTCP and MaineDOT) of their split of the Acceptance sample indicating that
 the variances in Table10: Dispute Resolution Variance Limits, for the specific
 test result(s) or property(ies) were exceeded.
 
 c. Disputable Items The Contractor may dispute any or all of the following Method A or
 B test results when the difference between the Department’s value and the Contractor’s
 value for that test equals or exceeds the corresponding allowable variation in Table 10:
 Dispute Resolution Variance Limits, PGAB content, Gmb, and Gmm. In addition, if the
 allowable variation for the Gmb or Gmm is not met or exceeded, the Contractor may dispute
 either or both of the following material properties provided the difference between results
 for them equals or exceeds the corresponding allowable variation in Table 10: Voids at
 Ndesign, and VMA.
 For Method C only: The results for PGAB content and the screen sizes used for pay
 adjustment may be disputed.
 d. Outcome The value of any disputed result or property reported for the initial
 Acceptance sample shall stand if the value reported for the dispute resolution sample is not
 closer to the value the Contractor reported for their split sample than to the value reported
 for the initial Acceptance sample. If the value reported for the dispute resolution falls
 precisely half-way between the other two values the value reported for the dispute resolution
 will replace the original acceptance value. Otherwise, the value reported for the dispute
 resolution sample will replace the value reported for the initial Acceptance sample, and will
 be used to re-calculate any other affected results or properties.

 501.04 Construction Requirements
 501.041 Ordering Piles The Contractor shall order all pilings from an itemized list of order
 lengths provided by the Resident. When additional lengths of piles are necessary, the additional
 lengths will be ordered by the Contractor from a written list provided by the Resident.
 501.042 Equipment for Driving Piles
 Hammers Piles shall be driven with approved power-actuated impact hammers powered
 with steam/air, diesel fuel, or hydraulics (hereinafter referred to as power hammers). Gravity
 drop hammers (hereinafter referred to as drop hammers), except as noted on the Plans, shall only
 be used to drive timber piles. When drop hammers are used to drive timber piles, the ram shall
 be between 2,000 and 3,500 pounds and the height of drop shall not exceed 13 feet. In no case
 shall the ram weight be less than the combined weight of the drive head and pile. All drop
 hammers shall be equipped with hammer guides to insure concentric impact on the drive head.
 Air/steam hammers shall be operated and maintained within the manufacturer’s specified
 ranges. The plant and equipment furnished for air/steam hammers shall have sufficient capacity
 to maintain, at the hammer under working conditions, the volume and pressure specified by the
 manufacturer. The plant and equipment shall be equipped with accurate pressure gauges that are
 easily accessible to the Resident. The weight of the striking parts of air and steam power
 hammers shall not be less than 1/3 the weight of drive head and pile being driven, and in no case
 shall the striking parts weigh less than 2,750 pounds.
 Open-end (single acting) diesel hammers shall be equipped with a device such as rings on
 the ram or a scale (jump stick) extending above the ram cylinder, to permit the Resident to
 visually determine hammer stroke at all times during pile driving operations. The Contractor
 shall provide the Resident with a chart from the hammer manufacturer equating stroke and
 blows per minute to energy imparted for the open-end diesel hammer to be used.
 Closed-end (double acting) diesel hammers shall be equipped with a bounce chamber
 pressure gauge, in good working order, mounted near ground level to be easily read by the
 Resident. The Contractor shall provide the Resident with a chart, calibrated within 90 days of
 use, of actual hammer performance, equating bounce chamber pressure to either equivalent
 energy or stroke for the closed-end diesel hammer to be used.
 Double-acting hydraulic hammers shall have a power plant with sufficient capacity to
 maintain the volume and pressure specified by the manufacturer, under working conditions. The
 power plant and equipment shall be equipped with digital readouts, easily accessible to the
 Resident, showing pertinent system criteria, including but not limited to energy imparted to the
 pile, to enable the Resident to visually determine whether or not the refusal criteria has been
 
 5-2
 
 met. In addition, the Contractor shall provide the Resident with a chart, calibrated within 90
 days of use, of actual hammer performance.
 Approval of Pile Driving Equipment All pile driving equipment shall be sized such that the
 specified piles can be driven to the required resistance, without damage, as indicated on the
 Plans. Approval of the pile driving equipment by the Department will be based on the wave
 equation analysis and a completed Pile and Driving Equipment Data Form, as shown on Figure
 1 of this Section.
 The wave equation analysis prepared by the Contractor shall include a proposed stopping
 criterion, where the number of blows per inch, for a number of 1 inch driving intervals, at a
 specified hammer-stroke and fuel setting, is clearly defined. The criteria that the Department
 will use to evaluate the driving equipment will be based on the approved wave equation analysis
 utilizing the information provided in the completed Pile and Driving Equipment Data Form.
 For the driving system to be acceptable, the number of hammer blows at the required
 resistance indicated by the wave equation analysis shall be between 3 and 15 blows per inch, and
 the driving stresses shall not exceed 90% of the specified yield stress of the pile material. For
 timber piles, the compressive driving stress shall not exceed 1.15 times the base resistance of the
 wood in compression parallel to the grain. The stopping criteria used for pile driving operations
 shall be approved by the Department.
 If the wave equation analyses show that the driving system is unacceptable, the Contractor
 shall modify or replace the proposed driving equipment in an amendment to the QCP, at its
 expense, until subsequent wave equation analyses indicate the piles can be driven to the required
 resistance, without damage or excessive blows. Department review times of a revised wave
 equation analysis and Pile and Driving Equipment Data Form will be per Section 106.4.1.B.
 During pile driving operations, the Contractor shall use the approved system. No variations
 in the driving system will be permitted without an amendment to the QCP and a revised wave
 equation analysis and Pile and Driving Equipment Data Form.
 Acceptance of the pile driving equipment does not relieve the Contractor of the
 responsibility to properly install the piling. The hammer acceptance and driving criteria will be
 based on commonly accepted hammer efficiencies, component properties, and soil parameters.
 Local soil conditions and the actual driving system will affect the driving. If, in the opinion of
 the Resident, the accepted driving system fails to perform satisfactorily during actual driving,
 the Department reserves the right to revise the driving criteria.
 Drive System Components and Accessories
 Leads Pile driver leads shall be constructed in such a manner as to afford freedom of
 movement of the hammer while maintaining alignment of the hammer and the pile to insure
 concentric impact for each blow.
 
 5-3
 
 Followers Followers, when used, must be included in the QCP. In cases where a follower
 is permitted, the first pile in each group and every tenth pile driven thereafter shall be driven full
 length without a follower, to verify that adequate pile length is being attained to develop the
 required pile resistance. The follower and pile shall be held and maintained in equal and proper
 alignment during driving. The follower shall be of such material and dimensions to permit the
 piles to be driven to the length determined necessary from the driving of the full-length piles.
 The final position and alignment of the first two piles installed with followers in each
 substructure unit shall be verified in accordance with location tolerances.
 Hammer Cushion All power pile driving equipment shall be equipped with a suitable
 thickness of hammer cushion material to prevent damage to the hammer and pile and to insure
 uniform driving behavior. Hammer cushions shall be made of durable, manufactured materials,
 provided in accordance with the hammer manufacturer's guidelines except that all wood, wire
 rope, and asbestos hammer cushions are specifically disallowed and shall not be used. A striker
 plate as recommended by the hammer manufacturer shall be placed on the hammer cushion to
 insure uniform compression of the cushion material. The hammer cushion shall be inspected in
 the presence of the Resident when beginning pile driving at each pile group or after each 100
 hours of pile driving, whichever is less. Any hammer cushion thickness measuring less than
 75% of the original thickness shall be replaced by the Contractor before driving is permitted to
 continue.
 Helmet Piles driven with power hammers require an adequate drive head to distribute the
 hammer blow to the pile head. The helmet shall be axially aligned with the hammer and the
 pile. The helmet shall be guided by the leads and not be free-swinging. The helmet shall fit
 around the pile head in such a manner as to prevent transfer of torsional forces during driving
 while maintaining proper alignment of hammer and pile.
 For special types of piles, appropriate driving heads, mandrels, or other devices shall be
 provided in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations so that the piles may be driven
 without damage.
 501.043 Driving Procedures and Tolerances The sequence of driving piles in any
 substructure unit shall be included in the QCP. The ground surface shall be brought to the
 bottom of the footing elevation before driving the piles. The Contractor shall furnish all
 assistance required to make any observations and measurements. Prior to placing any pile
 section in the leads, the Contractor shall make the pile section available for foot and inch
 marking by the Resident. When pile sections are placed in the leads prior to marking by the
 Resident, the Contractor shall mark the pile in foot and inch increments, or provide reasonable
 means of access to the pile for foot and inch marking. The order of placing individual piles in
 pile groups shall be either starting from the center of the group and proceeding outwards in both
 directions or starting at the outside row and proceeding progressively across the group.
 When driving is interrupted before final penetration is reached, data for the bearing
 resistance of the pile shall not be taken until at least 12 inches of pile penetration is attained after
 driving has been resumed, or pile refusal has been attained.
 
 5-4
 
 The heads of all piles shall be plane and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pile
 before the helmet is attached. Approval of the hammer relative to driving stress damage shall
 not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for piles damaged because of misalignment of the
 leads, failure of cushion materials, failure of splices, malfunction of the pile hammer, or
 improper construction methods. Piles damaged for such reasons shall be rejected and replaced
 at the Contractor’s expense when the Resident determines that the damage impairs the strength
 of the pile.
 Jetting Jetting shall be done only with the permission of the Resident and must be
 addressed in the Contractor’s Soil Erosion and Water Pollution Control Plan (SEWPCP). When
 water jets are used, the number of jets and the volume and pressure of the water at the nozzles
 shall be sufficient to erode freely the material adjacent to the piles. The plant shall have
 sufficient capacity to deliver at all times at least 100 pounds per square inch pressure at two ¾
 inch jet nozzles. Before the desired penetration is reached, the jets shall be withdrawn and the
 piles shall be driven with the hammer to the required penetration or bearing capacity.
 Vibratory Hammers When approved, non-displacement piles may be initially driven with a
 power-actuated vibratory hammer powered with electricity or hydraulics (hereinafter referred to
 as vibratory hammers). Vibratory hammers shall not be used for precast concrete piles due to
 pile damage and bending stress considerations. Vibratory hammers shall not be used to set piles
 which develop resistance primarily from friction with the surrounding soils through the pile
 length.
 Piles permitted to be initially driven using a vibratory hammer shall be subsequently driven
 to the required capacity in accordance with the approved stopping criteria and the QCP using a
 power hammer. Vibratory hammers, when permitted, may only be used to initially set a pile up
 to a distance of 20 feet above the expected tip elevation, at which point a power hammer shall be
 employed. Vibratory hammers will only be permitted to initially set production piles after the
 pile tip elevation is established by load testing and/or piles driven with an impact hammer and
 the ultimate pile resistance is verified. If the pile penetration rate is 12 inches or less per minute,
 the use of a vibratory hammer shall be discontinued and a power hammer employed. When a
 battered pile is initially set using a vibratory hammer, the hammer shall be mounted in a set of
 leads and/or kept in alignment using a driving frame/template.
 Preaugering When necessary to clear obstructions or to obtain the specified pile
 penetration, as approved by the Resident, the Contractor may preauger. When specified in the
 Contract documents, the Contractor shall preauger holes at pile locations and to the depths
 shown on the Plans. Preaugered holes shall be of a size smaller than the diameter of the
 diagonal of the pile cross section. If subsurface obstructions, such as boulders or rock layers are
 encountered, the hole diameter may be increased to the least dimension needed for pile
 installation. Any void space remaining around any type pile after driving shall be completely
 filled with sand or other approved material. The use of spuds, which are driven and removed to
 make a hole for inserting a pile, shall not be permitted in lieu of preaugering.
 
 5-5
 
 Pre-excavation When necessary to clear subsurface obstructions, such as boulders or rock
 layers, or to obtain the specified pile penetration, the Contractor may pre-excavate, with the
 approval of the Resident.
 Heaved Piles Piles that have heaved more than ¼ inch during the driving of other piles in a
 group shall be reseated to the required penetration or bearing capacity at the Contractor's
 expense.
 Location and Alignment Tolerance The Contractor will be responsible to hold the piles in
 place to allowable tolerances. Piles shall be driven with a variation of not more than ¼ inch per
 foot from the vertical or from the batter shown on the Plans. For piles that cannot be inspected
 for axial alignment internally after installation, an alignment check shall be made before
 installing the last 5 feet of pile, or after installation is completed, provided the exposed portion
 of the piles is not less than 5 feet in length. The Resident may require that driving be stopped in
 order to check the pile alignment. Pulling laterally on piles to correct misalignment, or splicing
 a properly aligned section of a misaligned section shall not be permitted.
 The cutoff elevation of piles for trestle bents and pile bent piers shall not be out of position
 by more than 2 inches from the dimensions shown on the Plans. The cutoff elevation of piles
 for integral abutments shall not be out of position from the dimensions shown on the Plans by
 more than 2 inches in any direction. The cutoff elevation of piles, other than for trestle bents and
 integral abutments, shall not be out of position by more than 6 inches. Actual embedment of the
 piles in the concrete shall be within 6 inches of that shown on the Plans. The as-driven centroid
 of load of any group at cutoff elevation shall be within 5 percent of the Plan location of the
 designated centroid of load. No pile shall be nearer than 4 inches from any edge of the pile cap.
 Any increase in size of the pile cap to meet this edge distance requirement shall be at the
 Contractor’s expense.
 501.044 Special Requirements for Steel Pipe Piles and Steel Casings Pipe piles shall be
 driven closed ended, unless otherwise specified. When open-ended pipe piles are specified or
 when the ends are not completely closed ended when driven, the inside of the pile shall be
 thoroughly cleaned out, and the inside walls cleaned by jetting or other means approved by the
 Resident. The sediment control required for the cleaning operations shall be covered in the
 Contractor’s SEWPCP.
 Pipe piles shall be inspected and approved by the Resident immediately before concrete is
 placed in them. They shall be free from rupture and undue deformation and shall be free from
 water unless the Resident determines that the concrete can be placed without damage to the pile
 and such that the discharged water will be contained. The Contractor shall provide lights and
 other equipment necessary to enable the Resident to inspect each pipe pile.
 Portland cement concrete for filling the pipe piles shall be placed in one continuous
 operation to fill the pile completely without causing water contamination. An internal type
 vibrator shall be used in the top 25 feet. Pile heads shall be protected and cured in accordance
 with Section 502, Structural Concrete.
 
 5-6
 
 The placing of concrete and the driving of piles shall be scheduled so that fresh and setting
 concrete will not be injured by the pile driving.
 Concrete shall not be placed in pipe piles until pile driving has progressed beyond a radius
 of 15 feet from the pile to be concreted. If pile heave is detected for pipe piles that have been
 filled with concrete, the piles shall be redriven to the original position after the concrete has
 attained sufficient strength and a proper hammer-pile cushion system, is in place and is
 satisfactory to the Resident.
 When a reinforcing steel cage is specified, it shall be placed inside the piles to allow for a
 minimum of 2 inches of concrete cover and the piles shall be filled with concrete to the
 elevation shown on the Plans.
 Full-length pipe piles and steel casings shall be used wherever practicable; however, splicing
 may be permitted when approved by the Resident. The method of splicing shall be as follows:
 a. Steel pipe piles and steel casings shall be spliced by full penetration butt joint welds.
 b. When the pipe piles and steel casings are to be spliced while in a vertical position,
 splicing shall be accomplished utilizing single-bevel groove welds with the use of back-up
 rings. When the pipe piles and steel casings are to be spliced while in a horizontal position,
 splicing shall be accomplished utilizing single-vee groove welds with the use of back-up
 rings.
 c. Welded joints shall conform to the Standard Details. Welding, including welder
 qualifications, shall comply with the requirements of AWS D1.1, Structural Welding Code Steel.
 All welding and welder qualifications shall be in conformance with Section 501.047, parts
 (d) and (e).
 501.045 Defective Piles and Corrective Measures Pile driving activities shall not result in
 damage to, or deformation of, the piles. Any pile damaged due to internal defects, improper
 driving, or driven below cutoff elevation, shall be considered defective and shall be corrected by
 and at the expense of the Contractor, by a method approved by the Resident.
 501.046 Driven Pile Resistance, Pile Testing, and Acceptance Pile testing will be required
 as shown on the Plans. Pile testing will be required to confirm that piles attain the required
 resistance and that the stresses in the piles do not exceed allowable limits during driving.
 A dynamic load test consists of mounting instruments on the pile and accurately recording
 the output during driving using dynamic pile load test equipment meeting the requirements of
 ASTM D4945. The stresses in steel piles during driving shall not exceed 90% of the yield
 stress, as determined by wave equation analyses or dynamic pile load testing. Piles which have
 
 5-7
 
 been overstressed, per wave equation or dynamic pile load testing, shall be replaced by the
 Contractor, at no additional cost to the Department.
 A static load test consists of the application of a known load to the pile or group of piles
 and the accurate measurement of the resulting displacement. The Contractor shall furnish all
 labor and equipment for static load testing.
 In the case of concrete filled steel pipe piles, no load shall be placed on the pile for at least 7
 days after the concrete has been placed in the pile.
 On completion of either static or dynamic load testing, any test or anchor piling, not a part
 of the finished structure, shall be removed or cut off at least 1 foot below either the bottom of
 the footing or the finished ground elevation, whichever is lower.
 Driven Pile Capacity - Wave Equation The piles shall be driven to the required resistance
 using the approved stopping criteria. The pile acceptance will be based on obtaining the blow
 count and hammer stroke from the approved stopping criteria at the required resistance. When
 the wave equation is used in conjunction with dynamic or static pile load testing, the stopping
 criteria shall be amended based on correlation with the testing method results, as determined by
 the Resident. Adequate pile penetration shall be considered to be obtained when the specified
 wave equation resistance criteria (approved stopping criteria) is achieved within 5 feet of the
 pile toe elevation, based on Contract lengths. Piles not achieving the specified required
 resistance within these limits shall be driven to penetration established by the Resident.
 The wave equation resistance criteria will not be considered valid under any of the
 following conditions:
 a. The hammer or striking part does not have a free fall.
 b. The head of the pile becomes broomed or crushed.
 c. The penetration is not reasonably quick and uniform.
 d. There is an appreciable bounce after a blow.
 e. The hammer is operated outside the parameters recommended by the manufacturer.
 Static Load Test When a static load test is specified in the Contract documents, load tests
 shall be performed by procedures set forth in ASTM D1143 using the quick load test method
 except that the test shall be taken to plunging failure or the capacity of the loading system.
 Testing equipment and measuring systems shall conform to ASTM D1143, except that the
 loading system shall be capable of applying 150% of the nominal pile resistance or 2,000 kips,
 whichever is less, and that a load cell and spherical bearing plate shall be used.
 The Contractor shall submit in the QCP, detailed plans, prepared by a licensed Professional
 Engineer, of the proposed loading apparatus. The apparatus shall be constructed to allow the
 various increments of the load to be placed gradually without causing vibration to the test pile.
 When the approved method requires the use of tension (anchor) piles, such tension piles shall be
 of the same type and diameter as the production piles and shall be driven in the location of
 
 5-8
 
 permanent piles when feasible, except that timber or tapered piles installed in permanent
 locations shall not be used as tension piles.
 The design load shall be defined as 50% of the failure load. The failure load for a pile shall
 be defined as follows:
 For piles 24 inches or less in diameter or width, the failure load of a pile tested under axial
 compressive load is that load which produces a settlement at failure of the pile head equal to:
 sf =
 
 + (0.15 + 0.008b)
 
 Where:
 sf = Settlement at failure in inches
 b = Pile diameter or width in inches
 = Elastic deformation of total unsupported pile length in inches
 For piles greater than 24 inches in diameter or width:
 sf =
 
 + b/30
 
 The top elevation of the test pile shall be determined immediately after driving and again
 just before load testing to check for heave. Any pile that heaves more than ¼ inch shall be
 redriven or jacked to the original elevation before testing. Unless otherwise specified in the
 Contract, a minimum 3-day waiting period shall be observed between the driving of any anchor
 piles or the load test pile and the commencement of the load test.
 Dynamic Pile Tests When dynamic load tests are specified in the Contract, dynamic
 measurements will be taken by the Contractor using procedures set forth in ASTM D4945.
 Dynamic testing shall be completed during the driving of piles designated on the Plans, or as
 designated by the Resident. Dynamic load tests will be performed for the full length of the test
 pile during initial drive. The Contractor’s representative performing the dynamic tests shall be
 an experienced pile testing engineer and have attained the dynamic pile load test Signatory
 Advanced level on the Foundation QA High Strain Dynamic Pile Testing Examination, or
 equivalent level of certification or training, or be a licensed Professional Engineer. The same
 Contractor’s representative conducting the wave equation analysis shall perform the dynamic
 load tests. Each test shall also include a numerical evaluation of static axial pile resistance using
 field dynamic measurements obtained per ASTM D4945 (also known as signal matching). The
 Contractor’s representative shall be experienced in the use of dynamic pile load test equipment
 and its purpose related to pile capacity determinations. Dynamic measurements shall be
 reported to the Resident and include items specified in Section 7 of ASTM D4945.
 Before placement of the pile in the leads, the Contractor shall make the designated pile
 available for obtaining wave speed measurements and for predrilling the required instrument
 attachment holes. The Contractor shall mark the designated pile in foot and inch markings. The
 
 5-9
 
 Contractor shall make provisions in ordered lengths of pile to account for an additional pile
 length, equal to three pile diameters or 5 feet, whichever is greater, for instrumentation
 attachment. Pre-driving wave speed measurements will not be required for steel piles. When
 wave speed measurements are made, the piling shall be in a horizontal position and not in
 contact with other piling. The Contractor will furnish the equipment, materials, and labor
 necessary for drilling holes in the piles for mounting the instruments. The instruments will be
 attached near the head of the pile with bolts placed through drilled holes on the steel piles or
 with wood screws for timber piles.
 The Contractor shall provide the Contractor’s dynamic testing technician with reasonable
 means of access to the pile for attaching instrumentation after the pile is placed in the leads. The
 Contractor shall furnish electric power for the dynamic test equipment. The power supply at the
 outlet shall be 10 amp, 115 volt, 55-60 cycle, A.C. only. Field generators used as the power
 source shall be equipped with functioning meters for monitoring voltage and frequency levels.
 With the dynamic testing equipment attached, the Contractor shall drive the pile to the
 depth at which the dynamic test equipment indicates that the required nominal resistance has
 been achieved or to the minimum tip elevation, whichever results in the greatest depth, as called
 for on the Plans, or as directed otherwise by the Resident. The stresses in the piles will be
 monitored during driving with the dynamic test equipment to ensure that the values determined
 do not exceed the allowable values specified in this Section. If necessary, the Contractor shall
 reduce the driving energy transmitted to the pile by using additional cushions or reducing the
 energy output of the hammer in order to maintain stresses at or below the allowable values. If
 non-axial driving is indicated by dynamic test equipment measurements, the Contractor shall
 immediately realign the driving system.
 When directed to restrike by the Resident, the Contractor shall wait a minimum of 24 hours,
 or as otherwise specified on the Contract Plans, and after the instruments are reattached, restrike
 the dynamic load test pile. A cold hammer shall not be used for the restrike. The hammer shall
 be warmed up before restrike begins by applying at least 20 blows to another pile. The
 maximum amount of penetration required during restrike shall be 6 inches, or the maximum
 total number of hammer blows required will be 50, whichever occurs first. After restriking, the
 Resident will either accept the re-driven pile or specify additional pile penetration and testing.
 The Contractor shall supply the Resident with a report of the test results of each dynamically
 tested pile, numerical evaluations of static axial pile resistance using dynamic field
 measurements (signal matching), and a driving criteria within 5 Working Days of the
 completion of testing. When directed by the Resident or required by the Contract Plans,
 numerical evaluations of static pile capacity using the field dynamic measurements and a driving
 criteria shall be supplied to the Resident within 24 hours of completing the testing.
 Hammer Performance If at any time during pile driving operations or dynamic testing the
 performance or efficiency of the power hammer is not in accordance with the Pile and Driving
 Equipment Data Form, the wave equation analyses, or the dynamic/static testing results, as
 determined by the Resident, the Contractor shall repair or replace the driving system. This may
 include, but not be limited to, rebuilding the hammer, or replacing the hammer with another
 
 5-10
 
 hammer. All costs and time associated with replacing the driving system, including additional
 wave equation analyses and dynamic/static testing, as determined by the Department, shall be
 borne by the Contractor.
 Required Pile Resistance Piles shall be driven by the Contractor to the penetration depth
 shown on the Plans or to a greater depth if necessary to obtain the required pile resistance. The
 required pile resistance shall be determined by the approved wave equation analysis or by the
 results of dynamic testing and numerical evaluations of static pile resistance using dynamic field
 measurements (signal matching).
 Piles shall not be driven to the required nominal pile resistance with a vibratory hammer.
 501.047 Splicing Piles Full-length piles shall always be used wherever practicable. When
 full-length piles cannot be used, the number of splices, locations, and details shall be noted in
 the QCP. Piles fabricated from multiple pieces will be acceptable only if they comply with the
 following:
 H-Beam Piles a

 Pile lengths less than 10 feet will not be spliced, except as the final (top) section of the pile.
 b
 Where pipe piles are used for pile bent piers, no splices will be allowed in the length of pile
 from the cutoff elevation to 2 feet below the channel bottom.
 When pre-planned splicing is approved, the pile piece of lesser length shall be placed at the
 tip of the pile (the first part of the pile that enters the ground).
 When splicing is approved, piles shall be spliced as follows:
 a. Damaged material shall be removed from the end of the driven pile. Lifting holes in
 H-piles shall be repaired or trimmed off. Lifting holes in pipe piles shall be trimmed
 off. The ends of both pieces to be spliced shall be cut off square with the
 longitudinal axis of the pile and beveled per the Standard Details. Except for minor
 trimming, all cutting shall be done with the use of a mechanical guide.
 b. The Contractor shall use an approved mechanical splicer or a full penetration butt
 weld for the entire cross section of the pile.
 c. Evaluation of mechanical splicers will be based on the submission of data
 demonstrating the capability of transferring the full pile strength in compression and
 tension and developing the bending moment capacity of the pile in both the x-x and
 
 5-11
 
 y-y axes. The splicers shall be installed and welded as recommended by the
 manufacturer with the additional requirements in d. and e., below.
 d. All welding shall comply with the requirements of Section 504, Structural Steel,
 except as modified hereinafter.
 1. Welding shall not be done when the temperature in the immediate vicinity of the
 weld is below 0°F; when the surfaces are damp or exposed to rain, snow, or high
 wind; or when the welders or welding operators are exposed to inclement
 conditions.
 2. The pile shall be preheated to and maintained at 150°F minimum within 6 inches
 from the weld during welding.
 3. Written welding procedures do not need to be submitted.
 e. Welders shall be prequalified in accordance with Section 504, Structural Steel.
 501.048 Prefabricated Pile Tips Steel H-beam piles tips shall be attached to the pile with a
 5/16 inch groove weld along each flange, or as specified by the manufacturer’s product data
 sheet welding requirements. Welding shall be done using low-hydrogen electrodes and the base
 metal shall be preheated to 150°F, minimum.
 Unless otherwise shown on the Plans, steel pipe piles shall have pointed cast steel pile tips.
 All welding and welder qualifications shall be in conformance with Section 501.047, parts (d)
 and (e).
 Pile tips for both H-beam and pipe piles shall be approved by the Resident.
 Pile tips may be welded to the piles either by the supplier of the piles or in the field by the
 Contractor, at its option.
 501.05 Method of Measurement
 a. Equipment Mobilization A lump sum price bid for mobilization shall include the cost
 of furnishing all labor, materials, and equipment necessary for the transporting, erecting,
 dismantling, and removing all pile driving equipment.
 b. Piles Furnished The unit of measurement for furnishing H-piles, pipe piles and steel
 casings shall be the linear foot. The quantity to be paid for will be the sum of the lengths in feet
 of the piles, of the types and lengths ordered in writing by the Resident. No allowance will be
 made for the length of piles, including test piles furnished by the Contractor, to replace piles that
 were previously accepted by the Resident, but are subsequently damaged prior to completion of
 the Contract. When additional lengths of piles are necessary, the additional length ordered in
 writing by the Resident will be included in the length of piling furnished. All piles must be
 cutoff at the cutoff elevation shown on the Plans.
 
 5-12
 
 c. Piles in Place Initiation of pile installation by use of a vibratory hammer,
 preaugering, jetting or other methods used for facilitating pile driving procedures will not be
 measured and payment shall be considered included in the unit price bid for the Piles, In Place,
 pay item.
 The quantity of H-beam, pipe pile or casings to be paid for will be the actual number of
 linear feet of H-pile, steel pipe piles or casings driven and left in place in the completed and
 accepted work. Measurements will be made from the tip of the H-beam pile, steel pipe pile or
 casing to the cutoff elevation as shown on the Plans.
 Unused pile cutoffs 10 feet or more in length, except those required to accommodate the
 Contractor’s construction method, as discussed herein, will remain the property of the
 Department and will be stored at a bridge maintenance yard nearest the project. Hauling and
 unloading of piles will be done by the Contractor or by the Department, depending upon
 availability of services.
 When hauling and unloading is done by the Contractor, payment will be made under the
 provisions of Section 109, Changes. There will be no separate payment to load piles at the
 project site; loading will be considered an incidental cost to the item.
 No separate measurement will be made for reinforcing steel, excavation, pre-excavation,
 drilling, cleaning of drilled holes, cleaning out of pipe piles, drilling fluids, sealing materials,
 concrete, required casing, and other items required to complete the Work.

 pile tests authorized and satisfactorily made. One dynamic test includes all data collected on one
 pile during both the initial pile driving and a restrike done a minimum of 24 hours after the
 initial driving, and numerical evaluation of static axial pile resistance using dynamic field
 measurements (signal matching).
 501.06 Basis of Payment The accepted quantities of piles and casings will be paid for at the
 Contract Unit Price per linear foot, delivered, and complete, in place. Such payment will
 include full compensation for any necessary excavation or backfilling required after driving, to
 bring the foundation area to the correct elevation.
 
 5-13
 
 Pile cutoffs and concrete for pipe piles and casings will not be paid for separately but will
 be considered as incidental to related Pay Items. Damaged pile lengths removed for pile splicing
 will be considered incidental to related Pay Items.
 Payment for all Work related to the following will not be made directly, but will be
 considered incidental to related Pay Items: Jetting; preaugering; pre-excavation; providing
 special driving tips or heavier sections for steel piles, or other work necessary to obtain the

 be stated in terms of aggregates in a saturated, surface dry condition and the batch weights will
 be adjusted by the Contractor for the actual moisture of the aggregate at the time of use.
 Self-consolidating concrete (SCC) may be used for Class A, LP or P mixes when approved
 by the Resident. SCC shall meet the requirements for strength, entrained air and permeability for
 the respective concrete Class. SCC shall be tested for slump flow in accordance with ASTM
 C1611; the visual stability index (VSI) shall be 0 or 1.
 No change in the source, proportions or character of the mix ingredients may be made without
 notice to the Department and no new mix ingredients shall be used until the Department has
 approved such ingredients and new mix proportions, if they change. The Contractor shall notify
 the Resident of any changes to the coarse aggregate blend prior to supplying concrete to the
 project.
 502.06 Batching Measuring and batching of materials for Structural Concrete shall be

 502.07 Mixing and Delivery
 A. All transit mixers used in the production and delivery of Structural Concrete shall be
 inspected annually by the Department. Delivery and discharge of the concrete from the mixer
 shall be completed within a maximum of 90 minutes from the time the cement is added to the
 aggregate, except that in hot weather when the concrete mix temperature exceeds 70°F, or under
 other conditions contributing to quick stiffening of the concrete, delivery and discharge from the
 mixer shall be completed within 60 minutes. When approved by the Resident, the use of a
 retarding admixture (Type D) may be used for increasing the 60 minutes discharge time to 90
 minutes, provided concrete temperatures are kept below 80ºF and conditions contributing to
 quick stiffening of the concrete are not present. With prior approval of the Resident, an
 approved hydration stabilizing admixture may be used to increase the discharge time. Use of
 hydration stabilizing admixtures will not be allowed for the sole purpose of increasing the
 discharge time limits.
 B. Concrete, which has been rejected for any reason, shall be removed immediately
 from the job site and disposed of properly.
 C. Concrete temperature, prior to discharge, shall not exceed 85°F.
 502.08 Cold Weather Concrete Concrete shall not be placed against frozen surfaces.
 All frost, ice, and snow shall be removed from all material that will be in contact with fresh
 concrete.
 Unless authorized by the Resident, the mixing and placing of concrete shall be discontinued
 when the atmospheric temperature is below 40°F in the shade and dropping and shall not be
 resumed until the atmospheric temperature is as high as 35°F in the shade and rising. If
 
 5-22
 
 authorization is granted for the mixing and placing of concrete under atmospheric conditions
 different from those specified above, the water shall be heated to a temperature not exceeding
 180°F. When either the aggregate or water is heated to above 120°F, they are to be combined
 first in the mixer before the cement is added. If the atmospheric temperature is below 25°F, the
 aggregate shall also be heated. Materials containing frost or lumps of frozen material shall not
 be used. Stockpiled aggregates may be heated by the use of dry heat or steam. Aggregates shall
 not be heated directly by gas or oil flame or on sheet metal over a fire. When aggregates are
 heated in bins, steam coil or water coil heating or other methods that will not be detrimental to
 the aggregates may be used. The heating apparatus shall be capable of heating the mass
 uniformly and preventing the occurrence of spots of overheated material. The minimum
 temperature of the mixed concrete shall be in accordance with Table 2, when it is placed in the
 forms. Salt, other chlorides or other unapproved chemicals shall not be added to the concrete for
 any reason whatsoever.

 MINIMUM CONCRETE TEMPERATURE AS PLACED
 When permitted by the Resident, footings may be protected by completely submerging them
 by admitting water inside the cofferdam. Until submersion takes place, the temperature of the
 concrete and its surface shall be controlled as specified above. Submersion shall proceed slowly
 and the temperature of the air or water shall be maintained sufficient to prevent ice from forming
 within the cofferdam for a period of 7 days after the placing of the concrete.
 When depositing concrete under water, there shall be no ice inside the cofferdam.
 Permission given to place concrete under the conditions mentioned above and as described
 in the Contractor's QCP shall not relieve the Contractor of its responsibility for obtaining
 satisfactory results. The Contractor shall be wholly responsible for the protection of concrete
 during cold weather operations and any concrete injured by frost action or overheating shall be
 removed and replaced at the Contractor's expense.
 502.09 Forms and False work
 A. Construction of Forms All forms shall be well built, substantial and unyielding,
 securely braced, strutted and tied to prevent motion and distortion while concrete is being placed
 in them. The forms shall be strong enough to safely support the weight of the concrete and all
 superimposed loads (such as runways, concrete buggy loads, workers, scaffolding, etc.) placed
 upon them.
 
 5-23
 
 Forms shall be built to conform to the dimensions, location, contours and details shown
 on the Plans. The faces of forms against which the concrete is to be placed shall be dressed
 smooth and uniform and shall be free from winds, twists, buckles and other irregularities.
 Stay-in-place forms of any type will not be permitted for any part of slab structures,
 unless otherwise indicated on the Plans.
 The placing of concrete in excavated pits and trenches without forms will not be
 permitted.
 All corners within the forms shall be fitted with chamfer strips mitered at their
 intersections, except that chamfer strips will not be required as follows: (1) on corners of slab
 blocking of interior steel beams and the inside of exterior steel beams; (2) on corners
 constructed transversely at the underside of the slab of superstructures which consist of a
 concrete slab on steel beams; (3) on footings not exposed to view; and (4) on all structures
 when more than 2 feet below the final finished grade line.
 Chamfer strips shall have a width across the diagonal face between ½ and ¾ inch. The
 size to be adopted for a given portion of the work shall depend upon the general dimensions.
 Except where special size chamfer strips are shown on the Plans, the size of chamfer strips shall
 be uniform on individual projects. Provision shall be made for the chamfering of the top edges
 of abutment bridge seats and wing walls, tops of piers and retaining walls, tops of through
 girders, roadway curbs, etc., by nailing chamfer strips inside the forms. Unless otherwise
 provided, all chamfer strips shall produce plain flat surfaces on the concrete.
 The forms for beams, girders and spandrel arches shall be so constructed as to permit the
 sides to be removed without disturbing the supports.
 All foreign matter within the forms shall be removed before depositing concrete in them.
 In all cases where metal or composite anchorages or ties within or through the face forms
 are required to hold the forms in their correct position, such anchorages or ties shall be of ample
 strength and shall be so constructed that the metal/composite work can be removed to a depth of
 not less than 1 inch from the face and back surfaces of the concrete without damaging such
 surfaces.
 Elevations will be taken on the top flanges of structural beams and girders for the
 purpose of determining the depth of blocking necessary for the construction of the forms for the
 concrete slab, after the following conditions have been satisfied:
 1. The satisfactory erection of the superstructure structural beams or girders,
 including any required flooring beams, stringers and intermediate diaphragms, unless
 an alternative plan is submitted by the Contractor and approved by the Department.
 2. All bolt tightening operations must be complete.
 
 5-24
 
 3. No foreign loads supported by the beams or girders are present.
 The Contractor shall submit working drawings for approval of the proposed forms and
 false work supporting the overhanging portion of the superstructure slab in accordance with
 Section 105.7. The working drawings shall show the size and location of the supporting
 members, the proposed loads and the weight of concrete forms to be carried by the members.
 In the construction of forms and false work for the portion of superstructure slabs
 overhanging the exterior members of beam and girder spans, forms and supporting devices
 resulting in point loadings on the exterior members shall not be used. Loads resulting from
 supporting devices shall be distributed directly to the flanges by means of brackets or braces.
 All forms shall be inspected and approved by the Department before the placing of any
 concrete within them.
 B. Surface Treatment of Forms The inside surfaces of forms shall be uniformly coated
 with form oil or other approved surface treatment. Form surfaces shall be treated before placing
 the reinforcing steel.
 C. Construction of False work All false work used for supporting reinforced concrete
 superstructures shall be comprised of members having ample structural sections to resist all
 loads imposed upon them, with deformations less than: (Span Length) / 360.
 When the vertical members of false work consist of piles or when framed or other false
 work is supported upon piles, the piles shall be driven to secure a safe load resistance.
 When false work is supported upon mud sills, the foundation pressures resulting from
 the imposed loads upon the mud sills (false work, forms, fresh concrete, scaffolding, etc.) shall
 not exceed the capacity of the on-site soils.
 All false work systems shall be designed to support all vertical loading and any
 differential settlement forces, all horizontal and longitudinal forces, and shall account for any
 temporary unbalanced loading due to the placement sequence of the concrete. Sufficient
 redundancy shall be designed into false work systems so that the failure of any member shall not
 cause a collapse. False work systems adjacent to and/or over traveled ways shall additionally be
 designed to resist any vibration forces due to traffic and shall incorporate sufficient protection
 against impact by errant vehicles.
 False work shall be so constructed that the forms will have a camber, the amount of which
 will depend upon the deflection anticipated in the design. Forms supported upon false work
 shall be provided with a satisfactory means for their adjustment in the event of settlement or
 deformation of the false work due to overloading or other causes. Provisions shall be made for
 the gradual lowering of false work and rendering the supported structure self-supporting.
 
 5-25
 
 All false work system computations, plans, and working drawings shall be designed and
 sealed by the Contractor’s Professional Engineer, who must be licensed in accordance with the
 laws of the State of Maine. Prior to concrete placement, the Contractor’s Professional Engineer
 responsible for the design of the false work system shall, after false work inspection, provide a
 sealed certification that the system was erected in conformance with the Professional Engineer’s
 plans and design details. This Professional Engineer may be directly employed, or otherwise
 retained, by the Contractor.
 No concrete shall be placed until the sealed design computations, plans and working
 drawings package and the sealed certification of erection of the false work have been submitted
 to the Resident. The Department shall have no obligation to review or comment on any design,
 construction, maintenance or removal of false work. No review or comment by the Department,
 or any lack of review or comment by the Department, shall relieve the Contractor of its
 responsibility to properly design, construct, maintain in good condition, and remove false work
 in accordance with the Contract, or shall shift any responsibility to the Department. The
 Contractor shall be responsible for all damages resulting from the failure of false work.
 The torsional effect of the false work on permanent structural members, which results from
 supporting cantilevered concrete sections, shall be analyzed by the Department. In the event that
 the Department finds that the torsional stresses imposed on any permanent structural member,
 due to the false work, is unacceptable, the Contractor shall redesign the false work in order to
 reduce the stresses to an acceptable level, at no additional cost to the Department.
 D. Removal of Forms and False work
 1. Location, weather conditions, cementitious materials used and the character of the
 structure involved shall be considered in determining the time for the removal of forms and false
 work. Forms and false work shall not be removed until concrete cylinders cured with the
 structure establish that the concrete has developed a minimum of 80 percent of design strength.
 The Contractor shall cast and break a sufficient number of cylinders to ensure that all concrete,
 associated with the forms and Falsework to be removed, has reached the minimum required
 strength; the test results from these cylinder breaks shall be furnished to the Resident before
 removal of the forms and false work.
 When approved by the Resident, the vertical forms and false work of footings, walls,
 columns and sides of beams and slabs may be removed 48 hours after completion of placement
 of concrete, exclusive of the time the ambient air temperature is below 45°F and provided the
 following conditions are met:
 Immediately after, or as otherwise allowed by the Resident, the forms are removed,
 defects in the concrete surface shall be repaired in accordance with Section 502.12 and the
 repaired area thoroughly dampened with water. The surfaces of exposed concrete shall be cured
 for the remainder of the 7-day curing period by the application of a curing compound listed on
 the Department’s Qualified Products List. The curing compound shall be applied continuously
 by approved mechanical pressure spraying or distributing equipment at a rate necessary to obtain
 
 5-26
 
 an even, continuous membrane, meeting the manufacturer’s recommendations but at a rate of
 not less than 1 gallon per 200 ft² of surface. At a minimum, two coats shall be applied using a
 pressurized sprayer, with the second coat being applied within 30 minutes and at right angles to
 the first. Hand-pump sprayers, rollers or brushes shall not be used.
 2. Forms and false work, including blocks and bracing, shall not be removed without
 the consent of the Resident. The Resident's consent shall not relieve the Contractor of its
 responsibility for the safety of the Work. In no case shall any portion of wood forms be left in
 the concrete. As the forms are removed, all projecting metal or composite devices that have
 been used for holding the forms in place shall be removed in accordance with Section
 502.09(A). The holes shall be filled as required in Section 502.12.
 502.10 Placing Concrete
 A. General Concrete shall not be placed until forms and reinforcing steel have been
 checked and approved by the Resident. The forms shall be clean of all debris. The method and
 sequence of placing the concrete shall be approved before any concrete is placed.
 All concrete shall be placed before it has taken its initial set and, in any case, as specified
 in Section 502.07. Concrete shall be placed in horizontal layers in such a manner as to avoid
 separation and segregation. A sufficient number of workers for the proper handling, tamping
 and operation of vibrators shall be provided to compact each layer before the succeeding layer is
 placed and to prevent the formation of cold joints between layers. Concrete shall not be placed
 against any surface coated with curing compound unless the curing compound has been
 removed. Care shall be taken to prevent mortar from spattering on structural steel, reinforcing
 steel and forms. Any concrete or mortar that becomes dried on the structural steel, reinforcing
 steel or forms shall be thoroughly cleaned off before the final covering with concrete. Following
 the placing of the concrete, all exposed surfaces shall be thoroughly cleaned as required, with
 care not to injure any surfaces.
 Concrete shall not come in direct contact with seawater during placing and for a period
 of 72 hours thereafter, except as follows:
 1. Concrete seals that are located entirely below low tide.
 2. Concrete footings constructed in the dry and located entirely below low tide or
 final ground elevation.
 3. Concrete Fill placed under water.
 Concrete in any section of a structure shall be placed in approximately horizontal layers
 of such thickness that the entire surface shall be covered by a succeeding layer before the
 underlying layer has taken its initial set. Layers shall not exceed 18 inches in thickness and be
 compacted to become an integral part of the layer below. Should the placement be unavoidably
 
 5-27
 
 delayed long enough to allow the underlying layer to take initial set or produce a so-called "cold
 joint", the following steps shall be taken:
 An incomplete horizontal layer shall be bulk-headed off to produce a vertical joint.
 Horizontal joints shall be treated as required in Section 502.10(F).
 The concrete in superstructures shall be placed monolithically except when construction
 joints are shown on the Plans or are authorized in accordance with approved details submitted
 by the Contractor. If the concrete in the stems of T-beams is to be placed independent of the
 slab section, the construction joint shall be located at the underside of the slab and the bond
 between stem and slab shall be a mechanical one. The bond shall be produced by embedding 2
 inch by 4 inch wooden blocks having a length approximately 4 inches less than the width of the
 stem and placed horizontally at right angles to the centerline of the beam in the top surface of
 the concrete immediately following the completion of the concrete placement. To provide for
 the uniform spacing of the blocks and their ready removal when the concrete has taken a set
 sufficient to hold its form, the blocks shall be firmly nailed upon a board at a distance of 1 foot
 center to center. The blocks shall be thoroughly oiled to facilitate their ready removal from the
 concrete.
 In arch spans, the order of construction or sequence of the work, as shown on the Plans,
 shall be followed in the placing of concrete.
 In no case shall the work on any section or layer be stopped or temporarily discontinued
 within 18 inches below the top of any face, unless the Plans provide for a coping having a
 thickness less than 18 inches, in which case, at the option of the Resident, the construction joint
 may be made at the underside of the coping. Concrete in columns shall be placed in one
 continuous operation, unless otherwise directed.
 If SCC has been approved for use, it shall be placed from a single discharge point to
 build hydraulic head and allow the SCC to progressively flow forward until the form is filled.
 The discharge point shall be moved as the SCC reaches the full height being cast, while
 maintaining a hydraulic head as the cast progresses. If subsequent loads of SCC are placed on
 top of a previous layer, a minimal amount of internal vibrating must be introduced to ensure the
 top layer blends with the previous layer.
 Fresh concrete threatened with rain damage shall be protected by approved means.
 Sufficient material for covering the work expected to be done in one day shall be on hand at all
 times for emergency use. The covering shall be supported above the surface of the concrete.
 Concrete Fill shall be placed at least to the pay limits shown on the Plans. Forms may be
 omitted at the Contractor’s option. Vibration of concrete will not be required. The Contractor
 has the option of placing Concrete Fill under water or in the dry.
 
 5-28
 
 B. Chutes, Troughs, Pipes and Buckets Sectional drop chutes or short chutes, troughs,
 pipes and buckets, when used as aids in placing concrete, shall be arranged and used in such a
 manner that the ingredients of the concrete do not become separated or segregated. Wood and
 aluminum chutes, troughs, pipes or buckets shall not be used.
 Dropping the concrete a distance of more than 6 feet, unless confined by closed chutes or
 pipe, will not be permitted. The concrete shall be deposited at, or as near as possible to, its final
 position.
 C. Vibrating Mechanical, high frequency internal vibrators shall be used, operating
 within the concrete, for compacting the concrete in all structures and precast and cast-in-place
 piles, with the exception of concrete placed under water. The vibrators shall have a frequency of
 between 5,000 and 12,000 vibrations per minute and shall be visibly capable of properly
 consolidating the designed mixture. For each type of vibrator used, a spare vibrator shall be
 available on the project at all times during the placing of concrete.
 Sufficient vibrators shall be used to consolidate the incoming concrete within 5 minutes
 after placing. Vibrators shall neither be held against forms or reinforcing steel, nor shall they be
 used for flowing the concrete or spreading it into place. Over-vibrating shall not be allowed.
 D. Dewatering Forms All forms shall be dewatered before concrete is placed in them.
 Pumping will not be permitted from the inside of forms while concrete is being placed. Moving
 water shall not be permitted to be exposed to fresh concrete.
 E. Depositing Concrete under Water No concrete shall be deposited under water except
 for cofferdam seals. Pumping will not be allowed within the cofferdam while concrete is being
 placed.
 The concrete shall be placed carefully in a compact mass in its final position by means of
 a tremie or by other approved means and shall not be disturbed after being deposited. Bottom
 dump buckets will not be permitted. Special care must be exercised to maintain still water at the
 point of deposit. Concrete shall not be placed in running water. The method of depositing
 concrete shall be so regulated as to produce approximate horizontal surfaces. Each seal shall be
 placed in one continuous operation.
 When a tremie is used, it shall consist of a tube not less than 10 inches in diameter. The
 means of supporting the tremie shall be such as to permit free movement of the discharge end
 over the entire seal and to permit its being lowered rapidly, when necessary to choke off or
 retard flow. The tremie shall be filled by a method that will prevent washing of the concrete.
 The discharge end shall be completely submerged in concrete at all times and the tremie tube
 shall be kept full to the bottom of the hopper. The flow shall be regulated by raising or lowering
 the tremie.
 When the horizontal area of the tremie seal is large, several tremie hoppers shall be
 provided and positioned strategically to allow placement of concrete near the point where it is
 
 5-29
 
 needed, to avoid moving concrete horizontally through the water.
 hoppers and the work plan shall be approved by the Resident.
 
 The number of tremie
 
 All laitance or other unsatisfactory material shall be removed from the surface of the seal
 before placing additional concrete. The surface shall be cleaned by scraping, chipping or other
 means that will not injure the concrete.
 The placing and dewatering of seal concrete within cofferdams shall be in accordance
 with Section 511 - Cofferdams.
 F. Construction Joints Construction joints shall be located where shown on the Plans or
 permitted by the Resident. When the concrete is in seawater, no horizontal construction joint
 will be permitted between extreme low tide and extreme high tide elevations, with the exception
 of concrete cores for stone masonry.
 At horizontal construction joints, temporary gage strips, having a minimum thickness of
 1-½ inches, shall be placed horizontally inside the forms along all exposed faces, to give the
 joints straight lines. The joint shall be so constructed that the surface of the concrete will not be
 less than ¼ inch above the bottom of the gage strip. Before placing fresh concrete, the
 temporary gage strip shall be removed, the surfaces of construction joints shall be thoroughly
 cleaned, drenched with water until saturated and kept saturated until the new concrete is placed.
 Immediately prior to placing new concrete, the forms shall be drawn tight against the concrete
 already in place. Concrete in substructures shall be placed in such a manner that all horizontal
 joints will be horizontal and, if possible, in locations such that they will not be exposed to view
 in the finished structure.
 Where vertical construction joints are necessary, reinforcing bars shall extend across the
 joint in such a manner as to make the structure monolithic. Construction joints through paneled
 wing walls or other large surfaces which are to be treated architecturally will not be allowed
 except as shown on the Plans. All vertical construction joints in abutments and retaining walls
 shall contain water stops as shown on the Plans. The water stops shall be one continuous piece
 at each location.
 All horizontal construction joints in abutments and retaining walls shall be constructed
 using a joint cover, as shown on the Plans.
 Construction joints in the wearing surface shall be located where called for on the Plans.
 No other construction joints will be allowed.
 All joints shall be formed in the manner detailed on the Plans. The forms shall not be
 treated with oil or any other bond breaking material that will adhere to the concrete.
 Sealing slots shall be provided at all joints in the wearing surface that are located directly
 over a slab construction joint.
 
 5-30
 
 Construction joints in the wearing surface not receiving a sealing slot shall be brushed
 with a neat cement paste immediately prior to making the adjacent concrete placement.
 After the concrete has been cured, sealing slots, when required, shall be sandblasted, or
 high-pressure (minimum of 8,000 psi) water cleaned, to remove all laitance and foreign material
 on the surfaces of the slots. The bottom of the sealing slots shall receive an approved bond
 breaker. The joint shall then be filled within ⅛ inch of the surface with an elastomeric concrete
 product listed on the Department’s Qualified Products List, in accordance with the
 manufacturer's recommendations.
 G. Bonding of Cast-In-Place Concrete Slabs Concrete wearing surface slabs placed on
 cast-in-place superstructure slabs, concrete wearing surface slabs placed on precast concrete
 superstructure elements, structural concrete slabs placed on precast concrete superstructure
 elements, or concrete leveling slabs placed on precast concrete superstructure elements shall be
 permanently bonded. Precast concrete superstructure elements include, but are not limited to,
 deck slabs, voided slabs, box beams, bulb tee girders and Northeast Extreme Tee (NEXT)
 beams.
 The structure supporting the cast-in-place slab shall be cleaned to remove all laitance,
 dust, dirt, debris, oil, grease, bituminous material, paint, and other foreign matter. When the
 supporting structure is composed of cast-in-place concrete, the Contractor shall scabble the
 entire surface of the structure and then sandblast, or high pressure (minimum of 8,000 psi,
 typical) water clean, the entire supporting structure. When the supporting structure is comprised
 of precast elements, the Contractor shall sandblast, or high pressure water clean, the entire
 surface of the supporting surface elements. The final cleaning of the supporting structure shall
 be performed within the 24 hour period preceding the placement of the cast-in-place slab. All
 debris resulting from the cleaning operation shall be thoroughly removed using compressed dry
 air from the cleaned surfaces and adjacent areas. Air lines shall be equipped with effective oil
 traps. Prepared areas of the supporting structure that have not received the cast-in-place slab
 within 36 hours of being cleaned shall be recleaned. No surface preparation of a new supporting
 structure shall begin before completion of the specified curing period.
 After cleaning of the structure supporting the cast-in-place slab has been satisfactorily
 completed, the supporting structure and all porous surfaces to be in contact with the new slab
 shall be thoroughly saturated with water for a minimum of 12 hours prior to placement of the
 slab. Remove all standing water immediately prior to placement with oil-free compressed air
 and protect the supporting structure from drying, so that the concrete remains in a saturated
 surface dry condition.
 The following is further required when placing concrete wearing surface slabs: In
 addition to the cleaning prescribed above for the supporting structure, the faces of curb and
 barrier walls, or other median devices, up to a height of one inch above the top elevation of the
 wearing surface, shall be cleaned to remove all curing compound, laitance, dust, dirt, debris, oil,
 grease, bituminous material, paint and all other foreign matter. The cleaning shall be performed
 by dry sand blasting or high pressure water cleaning.
 
 5-31
 
 Bonding grout for wearing surface slabs. All horizontal surfaces in contact with the
 wearing surface shall receive a coating of bonding grout. The vertical faces in contact with the
 wearing surface shall be broomed up to the elevation of the top of the wearing surface with
 bonding grout. Stiff bristled street brooms shall be used to brush the grout onto the surface.
 The coating shall not exceed ⅛ inch in thickness. The rate of progress in applying grout shall be
 limited so that the grout does not become dry before it is covered with new concrete. During
 delays in the surfacing operations, should the surface of the grout indicate an extensive amount
 of drying, the grout shall be removed by methods approved by the Resident and the area shall be
 regrouted. The bonding grout shall have Portland cement and fine aggregate proportioned 3 to
 1, respectively, by volume. The grout mix design shall be included in the QCP. The fine
 aggregate, from which the material larger than ⅛ inch has been removed, shall be the same
 source as used in the concrete. The cement and fine aggregate shall be measured separately in
 appropriately sized containers. The fine aggregate shall be deposited in an approved mechanical
 mortar mixer before adding cement. Water shall be added in sufficient quantity to allow flow of
 the grout without segregation of the grout ingredients. No water shall be added to the bonding
 grout after initial mixing. The grout shall not be allowed to separate before placement. The
 cement to water contact time of the grout shall not exceed 30 minutes before it is placed. Any
 grout that has dried or become unworkable before application, as determined by the Resident,
 shall not be incorporated into the work. The use of retarding admixtures for increasing the
 discharge time limits will be allowed. The Resident may approve the batching of bonding grout
 at an approved commercial concrete batch plant. In this case, mixing and delivery shall be in
 transit truck mixers.
 H. Concrete Slab Surface Evaporation Limitations No placement of structural concrete
 slab structures, including, but not limited to, concrete deck slabs, wearing surfaces, simple slab
 spans, and slabs on precast superstructures, shall be commenced if the combination of ambient
 air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and plastic concrete temperature result in a
 surface moisture evaporation rate theoretically equal to, or greater than, 0.1 lb/ft²/hr of exposed
 surface (Refer to the Rate of Evaporation from Concrete Surface Chart). If the surface moisture
 evaporation rate rises to 0.15 lb/ft²/hr of exposed surface, the Contractor shall implement the
 remedial action described in the approved QCP. The temperature of the concrete shall not
 exceed 75°F at the time the concrete is placed in its final position. The maximum temperature
 of the surface on which concrete will be placed shall be 90°F. The Contractor shall provide all
 equipment and perform all measurements and calculations in the presence of the Resident to
 determine the rate of evaporation, the cost of which shall be incidental to related items.
 
 5-32
 
 502.11 Expansion and Contraction Joints Expansion and contraction joints shall be located
 and constructed as shown on the Plans. Water stops shall be one continuous piece at each
 location. Joint cover, as shown on the Plans, shall be applied to all joints where water stops
 cannot physically be installed, as determined by the Resident.
 502.12 Repairing Defects and Filling Form Tie Holes in Concrete Surfaces After the forms
 are removed, all surface defects and holes left by the form ties shall be repaired.
 All fins and irregular projections shall be removed from the following: Surfaces which are
 visible in the completed work; surfaces to be waterproofed; and the portion of vertical surfaces
 of substructure units which is below the final ground surface to a depth of 12 inches, not
 including underwater surfaces.
 In patching surface defects, all coarse or fractured material shall be chipped away until a
 dense uniform surface, exposing solid coarse aggregate, is obtained. Feathered edges shall be
 saw cut away to form faces having a minimum depth of 1 inch perpendicular to the surface. All
 surfaces of the cavity shall be saturated thoroughly with water, after which a thin layer of neat
 cement paste shall be applied. The cavity shall then be filled with thick, reasonably stiff mortar,
 not more than 30 minutes old, composed of material of the same type and quality and of the
 same proportions as that used in the concrete being repaired. The surface of this mortar shall be
 
 5-33
 
 floated before initial set takes place and shall be neat in appearance. The patch shall be water
 cured for a period of five days.
 The holes left by form ties shall be filled with a mortar similar to that described above, but
 with the addition of a non-shrink additive.
 If the removal of defective concrete materially impairs the soundness or strength of the
 structure, as determined by the Resident, the affected unit shall be removed and replaced by the
 Contractor at its expense.
 The holes left by form ties, on the portions of substructure concrete that are to be
 permanently covered in the finished work, may be filled with an acceptable grade of plastic
 roofing cement. Holes in the bottom of slabs caused by supporting hangers need not be filled.
 502.13 Finishing Concrete Surfaces Neat cement paste, dry cement powder or the use of
 mortar for topping or plastering of concrete surfaces will not be permitted.
 A. Float Finish A float finish for horizontal surfaces shall be achieved by placing an
 excess of concrete in the form and removing or striking off the excess with a template or screed,
 forcing the coarse aggregate below the surface. Creation of concave surfaces shall be avoided.
 After the concrete has been struck off, the surface shall be thoroughly floated to the finished
 grade with a suitable floating tool. Aluminum and steel floats are not allowed.
 Float finish, unless otherwise required, shall be given to all horizontal surfaces except
 those intended to carry vehicular traffic and those of sidewalks.
 B. Structural Concrete Slab Structures Structural concrete slab structures include, but
 are not limited to, structural concrete deck slabs, wearing surfaces, slabs on precast
 superstructures, top and bottom slabs of box culverts, approach slabs, rigid frame structures and
 simple slab spans, as applicable. Screed rails shall be set entirely above the finished surface of
 the concrete and shall be supported in a manner approved by the Resident. Where shear
 connector studs are available, welding to the studs will be permitted. No welding will be
 permitted directly on the stringer flanges to attach either screed rail supports or form supports of
 any type.
 Screed rail supports set in the concrete shall be so designed that they may be removed to
 at least 2 inches below the surface of the concrete. Voids created by removal of the upper part
 of the screed rail supports shall be filled with mortar having the same proportions of sand and
 cement as that of the slab or wearing surface. The mortar shall contain an approved additive in
 sufficient proportions to produce non-shrink or slightly expansive characteristics.
 The rate of placing concrete shall be limited to that which can be finished without undue
 delay and shall not be placed more than 10 feet ahead of strike-off.
 
 5-34
 
 The Contractor shall furnish a minimum of two work bridges behind the finishing
 operation, supported on the screed rails, each of which shall be capable of spanning the entire
 width of the deck and supporting at least a 500 pound load without deflection to the concrete
 surface. These work bridges shall be used by the Contractor for touch-up and curing cover
 application and shall be available for inspection purposes. When the overall length of the
 structure is 60 feet, or less, only one work bridge will be required.
 An approved bridge deck finishing machine complying with the following requirements
 shall be used, except as otherwise specified, for finishing structural concrete slab structures.
 The finishing machine shall have the necessary adjustments, built in by the manufacturer, to
 produce the required cross section, line and grade. The supporting frame shall span the section
 being cast in a transverse direction without intermediate support. The finishing machine shall be
 self-propelled and capable of forward and reverse movement under positive control. Provisions
 shall be made for raising all screeds to clear the screeded surface for traveling in reverse. The
 screed device shall be provided with positive control of the vertical position.
 The finishing machine shall be self-propelled with one, or more, oscillating screeds or one,
 or more, rotating cylinder screeds. An oscillating screed shall oscillate in a direction parallel to
 the centerline of the structure and travel in a transverse direction. A rotating cylinder screed
 shall rotate in a transverse direction while also traveling in the same direction. Either type of
 screed shall be operated transversely in overlapping strips in the longitudinal direction not to
 exceed 6 inches. One, or more, powered augers shall be operated in advance of the screed(s)
 and a drag (pan type) float shall follow the screed(s). For concrete placements less than 6 inches
 in depth, vibratory pan(s) having a minimum of 3,000 vibrations/minute shall be operated
 between the oscillating screed(s) or rotating cylinder screed(s) and the power auger(s). For
 concrete placed in excess of 3 ½ inches in depth, hand-operated spud vibrators shall be used in
 addition to the machine vibratory pan(s).
 The transversely operated rotating cylinder(s) of the bridge deck finishing machine shall
 be rotated such that the direction of the rotation of the cylinder(s) at the surface of the concrete
 is in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
 Concrete immediately in front of the power auger(s) of a bridge deck finishing machine
 shall be placed or cut to a depth that is in close proximity to the center of the rotating auger(s).
 The advance auger(s) shall strike off the concrete to approximately ¼ inch above the final grade.
 The concrete shall then be consolidated with the vibrating pan(s) and then finished to final
 grade.
 If the drag float does not seal the surface of the concrete, an additional float finish shall
 be applied immediately following strike-off.
 A small handheld pan vibrator shall be required at edges and adjacent to joint bulkheads.
 In lieu of the handheld pan vibrator equipment, the Resident may approve small spud
 vibrator(s).
 
 5-35
 
 Lightweight, vibrating, screeds may be used on slab structures which are more than 12
 inches below the roadway finish grade or have a length of 30 feet or less, or where concrete
 placements are specified to be less than 16 feet in width, and shall have the following features:
 1. It shall be portable and easily moved, relocated, or adjusted.
 2. The power unit shall be operable without disturbing the screeded concrete.
 3. It shall be self-propelled with controls that will allow a uniform rate of travel and
 by which the rate of travel can be increased, decreased or stopped.
 4. It shall have controlled, uniform, variable frequency vibration, end to end.
 5. It shall be fully adjustable for flats, crowns, or valleys.
 6. The screed length shall be adjustable to accommodate the available work area.
 When a lightweight vibrating screed is utilized, the concrete shall be placed or cut to no
 more than ½ inch above the finished grade in front of the front screed. The screed shall be
 operated such that at least three feet of concrete is in position in front of the screed.
 Supporting slabs for bituminous wearing surfaces shall be finished in accordance with
 the recommendations of the waterproofing membrane manufacturer.
 On all concrete wearing surfaces, a one foot wide margin shall be finished adjacent to
 curbs and permanent barriers with a magnesium float.
 Immediately after screeding and floating, the surface of the concrete shall be tested for
 trueness, by the Contractor, with a 10 foot straightedge and all irregularities corrected at once in
 order to provide a final surface within the tolerance required in Table 3. The surface shall be
 checked both transversely and longitudinally.
 The straightedges shall be furnished and maintained by the Contractor. They shall be
 fitted with a handle and all parts shall be made of aluminum or other lightweight metal. The
 straightedges shall be made available for use by the Resident when requested.
 In the event of a delay during a concrete placement, all concrete that cannot receive the
 final curing cover shall be covered with wet burlap.
 No vehicles will be allowed, either directly or indirectly, on reinforcing steel before
 concrete placement.
 C. Curb and Sidewalk Finish on Bridges Curbs and sidewalks shall receive a float
 finish. Sidewalks shall, additionally, receive a light broom finish, perpendicular to the sidewalk.
 When a concrete curb is monolithic with a sidewalk, a 6 inch wide smooth margin shall
 be made along the top of the curb with a magnesium float.
 Unless shown on the Plans, the sidewalk area shall not be divided into sections by
 transverse grooves.
 
 5-36
 
 At all transverse construction and expansion joints, except where steel expansion dams
 are used, the edges of the joints, on the surface of the sidewalk, shall be finished with a sidewalk
 edging tool, 2 inches in width, with a ¼ inch radius lip. Finishing shall be completed within 15
 minutes of concrete placement.
 D. Form Surface Finish The character of the materials used and the care with which
 forms are constructed and concrete placed shall be considered in determining the amount of
 rubbing required. If concrete surfaces are obtained that are satisfactory to the Resident, then the
 Contractor may be relieved, in part, from the requirement of rubbing.
 1. Ordinary Finish An Ordinary Finish is defined as the finish left on a surface after
 the removal of the forms, the filling of all holes and the repairing of all defects. The surface
 shall be true and even, free from stone pockets and depressions or projections and of uniform
 texture. All formed concrete surfaces shall be given an ordinary finish unless otherwise
 specified.
 Repaired areas that do not meet the above requirements or areas that cannot be
 satisfactorily repaired to meet the requirements for ordinary finish shall be given a rubbed finish.
 When a rubbed finish is required on any part of a surface, the entire surface shall be given a
 rubbed finish.
 2. Rubbed Finish After removal of forms, the rubbing of concrete shall be started as
 soon as its condition will permit. Immediately before starting this work, the concrete shall be
 thoroughly saturated with water. Sufficient time shall have elapsed before wetting down to
 allow the mortar used in ordinary finish to become thoroughly set. Surfaces to be finished shall
 be rubbed with a medium coarse carborundum stone, using a small amount of mortar on its face.
 The mortar shall be composed of cement and fine sand mixed in proportions as used in the
 concrete being finished. Rubbing shall be continued until all form marks, projections and
 irregularities have been removed, all voids filled and a uniform surface has been obtained. A
 thin layer of paste produced by this rubbing shall be left on the surfaces.
 After all concrete above the surface being treated has been cast, the final finish shall
 be obtained by a second rubbing with a fine carborundum stone using only water. This rubbing
 shall be continued until the entire surface is of a smooth texture and uniform color. The paste
 produced by this second rubbing shall be carefully spread with a moist whitewash brush to form
 a very thin uniform coating upon the surface of the concrete.
 After the final rubbing is completed and the surface has dried, it shall be rubbed
 lightly with clean, dry, burlap to remove excess loose powder and shall be left free from all
 unsound patches, paste, powder and objectionable marks. This finish shall result in a surface of
 smooth texture and uniform color.
 No surface finishing shall be done in freezing weather or when the concrete contains
 frost. In cold weather, the preliminary rubbing necessary to remove the inert sand and cement
 
 5-37
 
 materials and the surface irregularities may be done without the application of water to the
 concrete surfaces.
 The following portions of concrete roadway grade separation structures shall be
 given a rubbed finish unless otherwise indicated in the Contract:
 (a) Retaining walls and the breast and wing walls of abutments-face surfaces to
 12 inches below the finished ground line.
 (b) Piers-All vertical surfaces and the underside of overhanging portions of caps,
 except that for overpass structures, the piers beyond the outside limits of the
 roadway pavement, the vertical surfaces on the back which are not visible
 from the roadway or sidewalk will not require a rubbed finish.
 If, in the opinion of the Resident, the general appearance of a concrete structure, due
 to the excellence of workmanship, cannot be improved by a rubbed finish, this requirement may
 be waived.
 E. Surface Finish After the concrete has cured the surface shall be tested with a 10 foot
 straightedge or a lightweight profiler.
 The straightedge shall be furnished and maintained by the Contractor. It shall be fitted
 with a handle and all parts shall be made of aluminum or other lightweight metal. The
 straightedges shall be made available for use by the Resident when requested. The lightweight
 profiler will be furnished by the Department.
 Areas found to not comply with the tolerance of Table 3 shall be brought into conformity
 by methods proposed by the Contractor and approved by the Resident at no additional cost to the
 Department.

 F. Transverse Saw Cut Grooving of Concrete Wearing Surfaces A transverse saw cut
 grooved finish shall be applied to concrete wearing surfaces. This work shall be performed using
 a multi-bladed diamond wet saw using circular saw blades. The Resident may allow the use of a
 single blade, circular saw tool, where it is determined that such equipment is necessary to
 complete the work, as required. The equipment the Contractor proposes to use will be subject to
 the approval of the Resident, prior to use.
 Saw cutting may begin only after the specified curing period has elapsed. Transverse
 grooves shall be cut perpendicular to the centerline of the roadway using a single pass. Cut all
 grooves in a rectangular shape conforming to the following dimensions:
 Width: 1/8 inch +/- 1/32 inch
 Depth: 1/4 inch +/- 1/16 inch
 Terminate grooves 12 inches away from the vertical face of curbs or parapets.
 The grooves shall be randomly spaced. The random spacing shall range from 1-1/4
 inches to 2 inches, with 50 percent of the spacings being less than, or equal to, 1-1/2inches. The
 Contractor shall submit a spacing pattern to the Resident for approval.
 An example of an acceptable random pattern is 1-1/4, 1-1/2, 1-3/8, 1-1/4, 1-3/4, 1-1/2, 2,
 2, 1-1/2, 1-1/4, 1-3/8, 2, 1-5/8, 1-1/4, 1-1/2, 1-1/2, 1-3/4, 2, and 1-5/8, with all spaces measured
 in inches. Spacings should not be based solely on multiples of 1/4 inch, because the result will
 not be truly random (e.g., do not use a pattern such as 1-1/4, 1-1/4, 1-3/4, 2, 1-1/2, 2, 2, etc.).
 During the grooving operations, the Resident will verify, at random, that the minimum
 grooved depth is being achieved. If the Resident determines that the minimum groove depth is
 not being achieved, then the Contractor shall stop grooving operations and make all adjustments
 necessary, as well as any repairs, as required by the Resident.
 The Contractor shall supply the Resident with two (2) accurate, easily readable, gauges
 with which to verify groove depth. Deliver the gauges and applicable manufacturer’s
 instructions for use no later than 7 Days prior to the anticipated start of grooving operations.
 Slurry, or debris, from the grooving operation will not be allowed to accumulate or
 harden and shall be prevented from flowing into drains, onto the roadway slopes or water bodies
 below or adjacent to the bridge. Residue shall be continuously removed. The slurry, or debris,
 shall be disposed of properly by the Contractor.
 502.14 Curing Concrete All concrete surfaces shall be kept wet with clean, fresh, water for a
 curing period of at least 7 days after concrete placing, with the exception of vertical surfaces, as
 provided for in Section 502.09(D) - Removal of Forms and False work, and sidewalks, as
 
 5-39
 
 provided for in this section. For concrete wearing surfaces and all concrete containing fly ash or
 slag, the temperature of the concrete shall be kept above 50°F for the entire seven (7) day period.
 All other concrete and its surfaces shall be kept above 50°F for the first four (4) days of the
 curing period and above 32°F for the remainder of the period.
 In the 24 hours following the end of the curing period, the temperature of the concrete shall
 be decreased on a gradual basis, not to exceed a total change of 40°F for moderate sections, such
 as abutments and pier bents, and 30°F for mass sections, such as massive piers.
 All slabs and wearing surfaces shall be water cured and kept continuously wet for the entire
 curing period by covering with one of the following systems:
 A. 2 layers of wet burlap,
 B. 2 layers of wet cotton mats,
 C. 1 layer of wet burlap and either a polyethylene sheet or a polyethylene coated burlap
 blanket,
 D. 1 layer of wet cotton mats and either a polyethylene sheet or a polyethylene coated
 burlap blanket.
 Except as otherwise specified, curing protection for slabs and wearing surfaces shall be
 applied within 15 minutes after the concrete is screeded and before the surface of the concrete
 has lost its surface "wetness" or "sheen" appearance. The burlap or the cotton mats shall be presoaked, prior to being applied. Polyethylene sheets shall not be placed directly on the concrete,
 but may be placed over the fabric cover to prevent drying.
 The covering of concrete wearing surfaces, decks, curbs, and sidewalks shall be kept
 continuously wet for the entire curing period by the use of a continuous wetting system and shall
 be located to insure a completely wet concrete surface for the entire curing period, except as
 noted below.
 The finished surfaces of sidewalks may be cured using a curing compound listed on the
 Department’s Qualified Products List. The curing compound shall be applied continuously by
 approved mechanical pressure spraying or distributing equipment at a rate necessary to obtain an
 even, continuous membrane, meeting the manufacturer’s recommendations, but at a rate of not
 less than 1 gallon per 200 ft² of surface. At a minimum, two coats shall be applied using a
 pressurized sprayer, with the first coat being applied within 15 minutes after finishing is
 complete, and the second coat being applied within 30 minutes of, and at right angles to, the
 first. Hand-pump sprayers, rollers or brushes shall not be used.
 All other surfaces, if not protected by forms, shall be kept thoroughly wet either by
 sprinkling or by the use of wet burlap, cotton mats or other suitable fabric until the end of the
 curing period, except as provided for in Section 502.09(D) - Removal of Forms and False work.
 
 5-40
 
 Polyethylene sheets shall not be placed directly on the concrete, but may be placed over the
 fabric cover to prevent drying.
 Use of evaporation retardants, finishing aids or water, to finish any concrete surfaces shall
 not be allowed.
 502.15 Loading Structures and Opening to Traffic No superstructure concentrated loads
 such as structural steel beams, girders and trusses shall be placed upon finished concrete
 substructures until the concrete has reached its design strength.
 No load or work will be permitted on concrete superstructure slabs or rigid frame structures
 until concrete cylinders cured with the slab establish that design strength has been reached.
 However, after a shorter period of time the Resident may permit handwork for form construction
 and setting stone bridge curb. No curbing or other materials shall be stored on the bridge during
 the 7 day curing period, except that if handwork is permitted, curb stones may be stored in a line
 near their final location until ready to be set.
 Neither traffic nor fill material shall be allowed on superstructures of concrete bridges or
 culverts until concrete cylinders cured with the slab establish that design strength has been
 reached, dependent upon conditions as specified in Section 502.09 and with the approval of the
 Resident.
 No traffic will be allowed on the cured concrete of a concrete wearing surface until 24 hours
 after the completion of the application of protective coating for concrete surfaces.
 Concrete approach slabs at the end of structures may be opened to traffic or backfilled if
 buried, when the design strength has been reached.
 Foundations for light bases, traffic signals and overhead signs must reach design strength
 prior to loading.
 502.16 Bridge Drains and Incidental Drainage All drains shall be accurately placed at the
 locations shown on the Plans, or authorized, and adequate means provided for securely holding
 them in the required positions during the placing of concrete.
 Bridge drains shall be galvanized in accordance with Section 711.04 - Bridge Drains. The
 Contractor shall furnish an insulator between surfaces of galvanized and weathering steels when
 erecting the bridge drain support assembly. Epoxy-coated washers shall be used when the
 support assembly attaches to weathering steel beam webs.
 Drains or weep holes through abutments and retaining walls shall be pipe of the size and
 shape shown on the Plans and shall be of Schedule 40 PVC pipe.
 For the purpose of providing drainage for any moisture that may collect between the deck
 slab and the hot mix asphalt roadway surface, approved one inch inside diameter plastic tube
 
 5-41
 
 drains shall be installed at the low points of the slab surface, adjacent to the end dam or dams.
 The exact location will be determined in the field by the Resident and the discharge from them
 shall be such as to clear the bridge seats and any other portion of the structure in their proximity.
 The tops of the drains shall be depressed ⅜ inch below the surface of the slab and the outlets
 shall project 2 inches below the underside of the slab. Care shall be exercised such that the
 drains are open after the installation of the membrane waterproofing, when it is installed.
 502.1701 Quality Control, Method A and B The Contractor shall control the quality of the
 concrete through testing, inspection, and practices which shall be described in the QCP,
 sufficient to assure a product meeting the Contract requirements. The QCP shall meet the
 requirements of Section 106, Quality, and this specification. No work under this item shall

 Additional QC testing will be required any time a process change occurs during a placement,
 including changes in type or dosage of admixture.
 502.1702 Quality Control, Method C The Contractor shall submit a QCP listing the
 mix design(s) to be used, the name and location of the production facility, a brief description
 of the placement and curing process and the name and qualifications of any QCT to be used.
 A QCT will be required. The Contractor shall provide a Certificate of Compliance for each
 truckload of concrete to the Department at the time of the load placement.
 502.1703 Acceptance Methods A and B The Department will determine the acceptability of
 the concrete through a quality assurance program.
 
 5-44
 
 The Department will take Acceptance samples a minimum of once per sublot on a
 statistically random basis. Samples will be taken at the discharge point, with pumped concrete
 sampling taken at the discharge end of the pump line. Acceptance tests will include compressive
 strength, air content and chloride permeability.
 Lot Size A lot size shall consist of the total quantity represented by each class of
 concrete in the Contract. A lot shall consist of a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 10 sublots. If
 a lot is comprised of more than 10 sublots, sized in accordance with Table 5, then this quantity
 shall be divided equally into 2, or more, lots, such that there is a minimum of 3 and a maximum
 of 10 sublots per lot. If there is insufficient quantity in a lot to meet the recommended minimum
 sublot size, then the lot shall be divided into 3 equal sublots.
 Sublot Size, General The size of each sublot shall be determined in accordance with
 Table 5. The Resident may vary sublot sizes based on placement sizes and sequence.
 Sublot Size, Unit Price Items Sublot sizes will initially be determined from estimated
 quantities. When the actual final quantity of concrete is determined: If there is less than onehalf the estimated sublot quantity in the remaining quantity, then this quantity shall be combined
 with the previous sublot, and no further Acceptance testing will be performed; if there is more
 than one-half the estimated sublot quantity in the remaining quantity, then this quantity shall
 constitute the last sublot and shall be represented by Acceptance test results. If it becomes
 apparent part way through a lot that, due to an underrun in quantity, there will be an insufficient
 quantity of concrete to comprise three sublots, then the Resident may adjust the sizes of the
 remaining sublots and select new sample locations based on the revised estimated quantity of
 concrete remaining in the lot.
 Sublot Size, Lump Sum Items Each lot shall be divided into sublots of equal size, based
 on the estimated quantity of concrete.

 Determination of the concrete cover over reinforcing steel for structural concrete shall be
 made prior to concrete being placed in the forms. Bar supports, chairs, slab bolsters, and side
 form spacers shall meet the requirements of the Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute (CRSI)
 Manual of Standard Practice, Chapter 3 Section 3.2.5 Class 1, Section 3.2.6 Class 1A, or Section
 3.4, All-Plastic Bar Supports. All supports shall meet the requirements for type and spacing as
 stated in the CRSI Manual of Standard Practice, Chapter 3. Concrete will not be placed until the
 placing of the reinforcing steel and supports have been approved by the Resident. If the
 Contractor fails to secure Department approval prior to placement, the Contractor’s failure shall
 
 5-45
 
 be cause for removal and replacement at the Contractor’s expense. The Contractor shall notify
 the Resident, at least 48 hours prior to the placement, when the reinforcing steel will be ready
 for checking. Sufficient time must be allowed for the checking process and any needed repairs.
 Compressive strength tests will be completed by the Department in accordance with
 AASHTO-T 22 and T 23 at 28 days, except that no slump will be taken. Two 4 inch x 8 inch
 cylinders will be cast per sublot placed. The average of two concrete cylinders per sublot will
 constitute a test result and this average will be used to determine the compressive strength for
 pay adjustment computations.
 Testing for Entrained Air in concrete, at the rate of one test per sublot, shall be in accordance
 with AASHTO T152.
 Rapid Chloride Permeability specimens will be tested by the Department in accordance
 with AASHTO T-277 at an age 56 days. Two 4 inch x 8 inch cylinders will be cast per
 sublot placed. The average of two concrete specimens per sublot will constitute a test result
 and this average will be used to determine the permeability for pay adjustment computations.
 Surface Tolerance, Alignment and Trueness, Plumb and Batter, Finish The Resident will
 measure the properties of surface tolerance, alignment and trueness, plumb and batter and finish
 to ensure they conform to the following criteria. If the concrete fails to meet any of these
 requirements and the Contractor fails to repair or mitigate the identified defects, to the
 satisfaction of the Resident, then there shall be no positive Quality Assurance Acceptance
 incentive payments on the respective lots.
 A. Surface Tolerance Surface tolerance of exposed horizontal and sloping portions
 of the substructure, superstructure slabs, wearing surface, sidewalks, barriers and wingwalls will
 be measured with a 10 foot straightedge. Surface tolerance limits are given in Table 3, Section
 502.13(E). The Contractor shall furnish the 10 foot straightedge.
 B. Alignment and Trueness Alignment and trueness will be measured longitudinally
 along any vertical surface of any portion of the structure and shall not exceed a deviation of ¼
 inch in 3 feet for structures up to 30 feet in length. Structures in excess of 30 feet in length will
 be subject to a maximum tolerance of 2 inches.
 C. Plumb and Batter Columns and other vertical surfaces that will remain exposed
 will be measured to determine actual batter and degree of verticality. Measurements will be
 taken subsequent to every placement. Vertical faces of columns will be measured at a minimum
 of two faces at right angles to each other. Other vertical surfaces will be measured once every
 15 feet along the face of longitudinal walls. All measurements will be made on a per placement
 basis and will be subject to a tolerance of ¼ inch in 10 feet.
 D. Finish Surface finish of concrete surfaces will be evaluated and repaired in
 accordance with Sections 502.09, 502.12, and 502.13, for each placement.

 Rejection by Resident For material represented by an Acceptance test with test results
 failing to meet the criteria specified in Table 1, the Department will, at its sole discretion:
 A. Require the Contractor to remove and replace the entire affected placement with
 concrete meeting the Contract requirements at no additional expense to the Department, or
 B. Accept the material, at a reduced payment as determined by the appropriate
 Quality Level Analysis specification formula.
 502.1704 Acceptance Method A A lot size shall consist of the total quantity represented by
 each class of concrete in the Contract. A lot shall consist of a minimum of 3 and a maximum of
 10 sublots.
 502.1705 Acceptance Method B A lot size shall consist of the total quantity represented by
 each class of concrete in the Contract. A lot shall consist of a minimum of 3 sublots.
 502.1706 Acceptance Method C The Department will determine the acceptability of the
 concrete through Acceptance testing. The Department reserves the right to waive tests at times
 deemed appropriate by the Resident. Acceptance tests will include compressive strength, air
 content and permeability. Method C concrete not meeting the requirements listed in Table 1
 shall be removed and replaced at no cost to the Department. At the Department’s sole discretion,
 material not meeting requirements may be left in place and paid for at a reduced price as
 described in Section 502.195.
 502.1707 Resolution of Disputed Acceptance Test Results The Contractor shall work
 cooperatively with the Resident in maintaining Control Charts, as outlined in Subsection
 106.4.3, in order to identify potential issues with any test results and take appropriate actions
 to address these issues before they become disputed issues. In cases where the Department
 may determine that removal of the affected placement is warranted or that the material is
 marginally acceptable and may remain in place and paid for at a reduced rate, in accordance
 with Section 502.1703, Acceptance Methods A and B, this Subsection provides recourse for
 the Contractor to contest the Department’s Acceptance test results as follows, at no additional
 cost to the Department:
 A. Compressive Strength There may be cases where the Department’s test results
 indicate that concrete must be removed and replaced, or that the material is maginally
 acceptable and my remain in place and paid for at a reduced rate. In these cases, and
 providing that the Contractor’s QC test results from a NETTCP certified laboratory for the
 same load are more than 500 psi higher than that of the Department’s test results, the
 following procedure concerning compressive strength may be undertaken by the Contractor
 and witnessed by the Department, within 36 days of the placement date (within 64 days of
 the placement date in the case where fly ash at 20%, or greater, pozzolan cement
 replacement is used in the concrete mix):
 
 5-47
 
 1. Drilled core specimens shall be retrieved from the concrete in question in
 accordance with the requirements of ASTM C42/C42M, Standard Test Method for
 Obtaining and Testing Drilled Cores and Sawed Beams of Concrete. The core strength
 acceptance and evaluation criteria included in ACI 318 shall not apply.
 2. Three drilled core specimens shall be taken from each sublot in question, from
 randomly selected locations to be representative of the entire volume of the sublot. The
 Resident and the Contractor’s representative shall agree on the sample locations prior to
 drilling. The specimens shall have a minimum diameter of 4 inches and a minimum
 length of 8 inches.
 3. The concrete cores shall be taken directly from the Project to the nearest
 MaineDOT laboratory for processing for testing. The cores shall be protected from
 drying during transport. The Contractor shall make arrangements with the appropriate
 MaineDOT laboratory for testing prior to beginning the coring process.
 4. Core test results will be evaluated by the Department. The test results of the
 three cored cylinders shall be averaged and then divided by a factor of 0.85. The
 resulting compressive strength shall be used by the Department in the final determination
 of the acceptability of the material in question and shall replace the contested test result
 in computing pay adjustments for the Lot in question. If coring is not done within the 36day time limit (or 64-day time limit, as applicable), the Department will not allow
 dispute testing of the sublot.
 5. If the Department concludes that the strength of the structural element in question
 is adequate as a result of the above procedure, then the concrete shall remain in place and
 payment will be adjusted using the test results from the above procedure. If the
 Department concludes that the strength of the structural element in question is
 unsatisfactory as a result of the above procedure, the original acceptance test result will
 remain in the lot and, the Department will direct the Contractor to take appropriate
 actions, as determined by the Department, and at no additional cost to the Department.
 B. Rapid Chloride Permeability In cases where the Department’s test results indicate
 that the material is subject to removal and replacement according to section 502.192, the
 following procedure concerning permeability may be undertaken by the Contractor and
 witnessed by the Department, within four calendar days of the receipt of the results:
 1. Drilled core specimens shall be retrieved from the concrete in question in
 accordance with the requirements of ASTM C42/C42M, Standard Test Method for
 Obtaining and Testing Drilled Cores and Sawed Beams of Concrete. Specimens shall
 have a diameter of 4 inches and a minimum length of 8 inches.
 2. Three drilled core specimens shall be taken from a location that would be from
 the same load as the original Department specimen for each sublot in question.
 
 5-48
 
 3. The concrete cores shall be taken directly from the Project to the nearest
 MaineDOT laboratory for processing for testing. The cores shall be protected from
 drying during transport. The Contractor shall make arrangements with the appropriate
 MaineDOT laboratory for testing prior to beginning the coring process.
 4. The cored cylinders will be tested by the Department in accordance with
 AASHTO T-277. The resulting permeability value shall be used by the Department in
 the final determination of the acceptability of the material in question and shall replace
 the contested test result in computing pay adjustments for the Lot in question.
 5. If the Department concludes that the permeability of the placement in question is
 adequate as a result of the above procedure, then the concrete shall remain in place and
 payment will be adjusted using the test results from the above procedure. If the
 Department concludes that the permeability of the affected placement in question is
 unsatisfactory as a result of the above procedure, the original acceptance test result will
 remain in the lot and the Department will direct the Contractor to take appropriate
 actions, as determined by the Department, and at no additional cost to the Department.
 C. Entrained Air In order to dispute the Department’s test results, the Contractor must
 test material from the same sample as the Department. If the difference between the
 Department’s and the Contractor’s air tests is equal to or greater than 0.6 percent, then the
 material shall be retested by both parties. If the difference between the retests is equal to or
 greater than 0.6 percent, the concrete placement will be suspended immediately. Both air
 meters will be checked for accuracy by either comparison to a third calibrated air meter or by
 use of an air meter calibration vessel. If either air meter is found to be out of calibration it
 shall be replaced immediately. Once it is demonstrated that the QC and Acceptance air
 meters are in agreement within 0.6 percent, the concrete placement may resume.
 502.18 Method of Measurement
 A. Structural concrete satisfactorily placed and accepted will be measured by the cubic
 yard, in accordance with the dimensions shown on the Plans or authorized changes in the Plans,
 or as one lump sum unit, as indicated in the Schedule of Items.
 Structural Concrete for any irregular shapes may be measured by the cubic yard as
 determined from the theoretical yield of the design mix or in the case of transit mixed concrete,
 by delivery ticket, as directed by the Resident.
 B. The limits to be used in determining the quantities of the aforementioned structural
 concrete items for arriving at a lump sum price will be as follows:
 1. Structural Concrete Superstructure Slabs, Structural Concrete Roadway and
 Sidewalk Slabs on Steel Bridges, Structural Concrete Roadway and Sidewalk Slabs on Concrete
 Bridges and Structural Concrete Superstructure T-beam Type The limits will be the entire

 or sidewalk, as shown on the Plans.
 9. Concrete Fill Will be measured for payment by the number of cubic yards of
 concrete, in place, to the vertical pay limits shown on the Plans. If the Contractor elects to omit
 forms, then any excavation or concrete placed beyond the pay limits indicated on the Plans shall
 not be paid for, but shall be at the Contractor’s expense.
 C. No deduction will be made for the volume of concrete displaced by structural steel,
 reinforcing steel, pile heads, expansion joint material, drains, chamfers on corners, inset panels
 of 1 ½ inches or less in depth, pipes, weep holes and authorized openings for utilities of ¼ yd³ or
 less in volume, when any of these items occur in structural concrete which is to be paid for on a
 cubic yard basis.
 D. When the bottom of foundations for concrete structures is required to be at a definite
 elevation within rock excavation, as shown on the Plans or otherwise designated, the quantity to
 be measured will be the number of cubic yards of concrete actually and satisfactorily placed
 above a plane at one foot below the above specified plan elevation and within the neat lines of
 
 5-50
 
 the structure as shown on the Plans or on authorized changes in the Plans. If the ledge rock is
 excavated below the plane at one foot below the plan elevation, without authorization, then this
 space shall be replaced with concrete of the same composition as required for the structure
 foundation but will not be measured for payment.
 E. For the purposes of making pay adjustments under Quality Level Analysis Method A
 or Method B, quantities of lots and sublots shall be determined as outlined under Section
 502.1703 - Acceptance Methods A and B, and under Section 502.19 - Basis of Payment.
 F. Transverse saw cut grooving of concrete wearing surfaces, complete and accepted,
 will be measured for payment as one lump sum.
 502.19 Basis of Payment The accepted work done under structural concrete, of the classes

 asphalt roll roofing (roofing felt), asphalt for painting or covering various type of joints, all
 required sandblasting, high-pressure water cleaning, bonding, curing and joint sealing and all
 incidentals necessary to complete the work satisfactorily. No direct payment will be made for
 concrete admixtures.
 No price adjustments will be made to the lump sum bid for the respective items that are bid
 lump sum, except when quantity changes are directed by the Department. It will be the
 responsibility of the Contractor to verify the estimated quantities prior to submitting bid
 documents.
 Transverse saw cut grooving of concrete wearing surfaces will be paid for at the Contract
 lump sum price, which shall be payment for furnishing all materials, labor and equipment,
 including depth gauges and all incidentals, to satisfactorily complete the work.
 Payment for structural concrete culvert connection shall include drilling and grouting the
 dowels into the existing headwall and excavation. Reinforcing will be paid for under Pay Item
 503.12, Reinforcing Steel, Fabricated and Delivered and Pay Item 503.13, Reinforcing Steel,

 Reinforcing steel, railings, stone curbing and any material that may be required for bridge
 lighting systems, will be measured and paid for separately as provided in the appropriate
 sections.
 Implementation of the QCP and costs associated with acceptance test sampling shall be
 incidental to related items.
 All costs associated with obtaining, testing and evaluating drilled core specimens for dispute
 resolution will not be paid for directly, but will be considered incidental to related items.
 
 5-51
 
 Pay adjustments will be made only for cast-in-place concrete. Pay adjustments shall be
 computed on the actual final quantity for unit price items. Pay adjustments shall be computed
 on the estimated quantity for lump sum items, except when precast deck panels are used, or
 when quantity changes are directed by the Department. When precast deck panels are used, the
 precast deck panel quantity, as computed from the Working Drawings, shall be deducted from
 the estimated lump sum quantity to determine the new estimated quantity that will be used to
 compute pay adjustments. When Department-directed quantity changes are made, this quantity
 shall be added to, or subtracted from, the estimated lump sum quantity to determine the new
 estimated quantity that will be used to compute pay adjustments. When precast deck panels are
 used and Department-directed quantity changes are made under the same lump sum item, the
 combined quantity change shall be added to, or subtracted from, the estimated lump sum
 quantity to determine the new estimated lump sum quantity that will be used to compute pay
 adjustments. Pay adjustments will be made according to the formula in Section 502.194. P, the
 unit value for pay adjustment purposes, is specified in Special Provision Section 502, Structural
 Concrete (QC/QA Acceptance Methods). P values, as specified in Special Provision Section
 502, reflect the price per cubic yard for all pay adjustment purposes.
 502.191 Pay Adjustment for Compressive Strength, Methods A and B Pay factors (PF)
 for pay adjustments for compressive strength will be determined using the Quality Level
 Analysis as specified in Section 106.
 502.192 Pay Adjustment for Chloride Permeability, Methods A and B Pay factors (PF) for
 pay adjustments for Chloride Permeability will be determined using the Quality Level Analysis
 as specified in Section 106.
 Values greater than 3,400 coulombs for Class A concrete or 3,000 coulombs for Class LP
 concrete shall be subject to rejection and replacement, at no additional cost to the Department.
 502.193 Pay Adjustment for Air Content, Methods A and B Pay factors (PF) for pay
 adjustments for air content will be determined using the Quality Level Analysis as specified in
 Section 106.
 502.194 Pay Adjustments for Compressive Strength, Chloride Permeability and Air
 Content, Methods A and B The Composite Pay Factor (CPF) for each lot of concrete shall be
 computed as follows:
 CPF = [(Compressive Strength PF-1)(0.20)] + [(Air Content PF-1)(0.40)]
 + [(Chloride Permeability PF-1)(0.40)]
 The pay adjustment for each lot of concrete shall be computed as follows:
 Lot Pay Adjustment = P x CPF x Lot Size
 There will be no positive pay adjustments for Method B Concrete.
 
 5-52
 
 502.195 Pay Adjustment Method C When the Department determines that Method C
 concrete which does not meet the specified limits may remain in place, payment will be
 reduced in accordance with Table 6. The quantity to which the pay reduction shall apply will
 be determined by the Resident.

 SECTION 503 - REINFORCING STEEL
 503.01 Description This work shall consist of furnishing and placing reinforcing steel bars
 (plain, galvanized, stainless, epoxy-coated, zinc and epoxy dual-coated, or low-carbon
 chromium), welded wire fabric and mechanical/welded reinforcing steel splices in accordance
 with these specifications and other applicable Contract Documents.
 503.02 Materials Materials shall meet the requirements of the following Sections of
 Division 700, Materials:
 Reinforcing Steel
 709.01
 Welded Steel Wire Fabric
 709.02
 
 5-54
 
 503.03 Schedule of Material When the Department does not furnish reinforcing steel
 schedules, the Contractor shall submit order lists, bending diagrams and bar layout drawings to
 the Resident for approval. The reinforcing steel shall not be ordered until these lists and
 drawings are approved. Approval shall not relieve the Contractor of full responsibility for the
 satisfactory completion of this item. When the Department allows the use of precast concrete
 deck panels, or any other significant changes that affect the quantity of reinforcing steel, the
 Contractor shall be responsible for revising the reinforcing steel schedule; the revised schedule
 shall be submitted to the Resident for approval.
 503.04 Protection of Material Reinforcement, either plain, galvanized, stainless, epoxycoated, zinc and epoxy dual-coated, or low-carbon chromium, shall be stored on skids or other
 supports a minimum of 12 inches above the ground surface and protected at all times from
 damage and surface contamination. The storage supports shall be constructed of wood or other
 material that will not damage the surface of the reinforcement or epoxy coating. Bundles of bars
 shall be stored on supports in a single layer. Each bundle shall be placed on the supports out of
 contact with adjacent bundles. Coated and uncoated steel reinforcing bars should be stored
 separately.
 Do not use carbon steel tools, chains, slings, etc. when fabricating or handling stainless
 steel reinforcing bars- use only nylon or polypropylene slings. Prior to shipping, ensure that all
 chains and steel bands will not come into direct contact with stainless steel reinforcing bars.
 Place wood or other soft materials (e.g., thick cardboard) under the tie-downs. Alternatively,
 use nylon or polypropylene straps to secure stainless steel reinforcing bars. When bundles of
 plain reinforcement steel and stainless steel reinforcing bars must be shipped one on top of the
 other, the stainless steel reinforcing bars should be loaded on top. Use wooden spacers to
 separate the two materials.
 If it is expected that epoxy-coated or zinc and epoxy dual-coated bars will be required to be
 stored outdoors for a period in excess of two months, then they shall be protected from
 ultraviolet radiation.
 503.05 Fabrication Bending of reinforcing bars and tolerances for bending of reinforcing
 bars shall be in conformance with the latest edition of the "Manual of Standard Practice of the
 Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute" and the "Detailing Manual of the American Concrete
 Institute". Unless otherwise specifically authorized, bars shall be bent cold.
 503.051 Epoxy Coating Reinforcing steel, specified on the design drawings to be epoxy
 coated or zinc and epoxy dual-coated, shall meet the requirements of AASHTO M284 (ASTM
 A775), Epoxy-Coated Steel Reinforcing Bars, or ASTM A1055, Zinc and Epoxy Dual-Coated
 Steel Reinforcing Bars as applicable and the following requirements:
 a. The Contractor shall furnish a written certification that, at the point of application of
 the coating and at the reinforcing steel fabrication shop, the coating, the coated bars, and the
 handling and packaging of the coated bars, meet all the requirements specified in Section 5.2.1

 #3 to #5 bars: 1 quart/15,000 ft. of bar, or fraction thereof
 #6 to #9 bars: 1 quart/8,000 ft. of bar, or fraction thereof
 #10 and up: 1 quart/6,000 ft. of bar, or fraction thereof
 c. All testing shall be as specified in AASHTO M284 (ASTM A775) or ASTM A1055 as
 applicable, except that the frequency of testing for adhesion of the coating shall be two bars of
 each size out of all bars coated with each individual batch or lot of epoxy resin, or two bars of
 each size out of all bars coated in an eight hour period, whichever is greater.
 d. If a reinforcing bar fabrication shop uses previously stockpiled bars to supply the
 requirements of this Contract, the fabrication shop shall furnish copies of all certificates required
 to be furnished by the coating applicator under a., above. The certificates furnished shall be
 directly traceable to the actual bars used through batch numbers, order numbers or similar
 information. If such certification is not available, the Department reserves the right to perform
 the tests specified under AASHTO M284 (ASTM A775) or ASTM A1055 as applicable, at the
 expense of the Contractor. For bars supplied from stock, the fabrication shop shall supply all
 patching material specified under b., above.
 e. The Contractor shall notify the Resident at least one week prior to the start of any
 coating application, so that the Resident, or their designated representative, may be present at the
 beginning of the application of the coating.
 503.052 Patching of Epoxy Coating Patching required at the point of application of the
 epoxy coating shall be done in conformance with the requirements of AASHTO M284 (ASTM
 A775). All patching related guidelines in ASTM A775 or A1055, Section X1, Guidelines for
 Job-Site Practices, shall be considered mandatory.
 At the reinforcing steel fabrication shop and at the job site, all nicks, cuts, scratches, cracks,
 abrasions, sheared ends etc., visible to the naked eye, shall be repaired using patching material
 supplied as specified under Section 503.051 b. To the greatest extent possible, repairs to each
 day's production at the fabrication shop and each day's placement at the job site shall be done
 before the end of each working day. If damaged areas do become rusted or contaminated with
 foreign matter, then these areas shall be cleaned by sandblasting, or an equally effective method,
 such that all visible rust and/or foreign matter is removed prior to patching.
 503.053 Zinc Coating Reinforcing steel, specified on the design drawings to be zinc-coated
 (galvanized) shall meet the requirements of ASTM A767, Zinc-Coated (Galvanized) Steel Bars
 for Concrete Reinforcement. Bars shall have a Class 1 coating per ASTM A767 and shall be
 
 5-56
 
 galvanized after fabrication. Bending of galvanized bars in the field shall not be allowed unless
 approved by the Resident. Damage to the zinc coating as a result of field-bending shall be
 repaired in accordance with Section 9 of ASTM A767.
 The Contractor shall furnish a written certification from the galvanizer that the material was
 manufactured and tested in accordance with ASTM A767, together with the report of the test
 results, at the time of shipment.
 503.054 Packaging and Handling of Epoxy-Coated and Zinc-Coated (Galvanized) Bars All
 handling of epoxy-coated, dual-coated, and galvanized reinforcing bars by mechanical means
 shall be done by equipment having padded contact areas, or by the use of nylon webbing slings.
 The use of chains or wire rope slings shall not be allowed, even when used with padding. All
 bundles of coated bars shall be lifted with a strong-back, spreader bar, multiple supports or a
 platform bridge to prevent bar-to-bar abrasion from sags in the bundles. Support points during
 lifting or transporting of bundled coated bars shall be spaced at a maximum of 15 feet.
 Bundled bars shall be strapped together with non-metallic or padded straps in a manner to
 prevent bar-to-bar abrasion due to relative movement between bars.
 Bars loaded for transport shall be loaded and strapped down in a manner that will prevent
 damage from motion and vibration, to the greatest extent possible. Bundles of bent bars shall be
 transported strapped to wooden platforms or shall be crated. All individual bundles and layers
 of bundles shall be separated, and supported by dunnage.
 Individual bars shall be handled in a manner that prevents damage to the coating due to
 abrasion or impact, and at no time shall any bar be moved by dragging over any surface,
 including other reinforcing bars. Sufficient personnel shall be assigned to assure that there is
 compliance with the above.
 All packaging and handling related guidelines in ASTM A775, A1055, or A767, Section
 X1, Guidelines for Job-Site Practices, shall be considered mandatory where not already covered
 by this specification.
 503.06 Placing and Fastening All steel reinforcement shall be accurately placed in the
 positions shown on the Plans and shall be firmly held there during the placing and setting of the
 concrete. Immediately before placing concrete, steel reinforcement shall be free from all foreign
 material, which could decrease the bond between the steel and concrete. Such foreign material
 shall include, but not be limited to, dirt, loose mill scale, excessive rust, paint, oil, bitumen and
 dried concrete mortar.
 Bars shall be fastened together at all intersections except where spacing is less than 1 foot
 in either direction, in which case, fastening at alternate intersections of each bar with other bars
 will be permitted, providing this will hold all the bars securely in position. This fastening may
 be done using tightly twisted wire or by welding, when permitted by the Fabrication Engineer.
 All welding shall be done in accordance with this specification. Welders must be qualified by
 
 5-57
 
 passing qualification tests for the process and position to be used in accordance with AWS D1.4
 Structural Welding Code – Reinforcing Steel. Welding shall only be done when performed in
 accordance with a welding procedure approved by the Fabrication Engineer. Weld area preheat
 shall comply with AWS D1.4. Weld areas shall be free of cracks, undercut or other deficiencies
 injurious to the reinforcing steel. Welds are not permitted within two bar diameters of a bend, if
 the bend radius is less than 16 bar diameters. Welds must comply with testing and sampling
 requirements in the Fabrication and Mechanical Properties sections of AASHTO M 54 (ASTM
 A184). Welds shall be able to withstand a static load of 150 pounds applied perpendicular to the
 reinforcing grid. Tension specimens must meet the material requirements of the type bar used
 when tested with a welded joint approximately at the center of the specimen. Frequency of
 testing shall be for every 75,000 square feet, or fraction thereof, of reinforcing grid fastened by
 welding. No welding for fastening or supporting reinforcing steel in areas of high tensile stresses
 will be permitted. Welding on epoxy-coated or dual-coated reinforcing steel will not be
 permitted under any condition.
 In general, no welding will be permitted on the main reinforcing steel of superstructures.
 Proper distances from the forms shall be maintained by means of chairs, stays, blocks, ties,
 hangers or other approved means. Chairs used for this purpose shall be plastic, plastic coated,
 epoxy coated or plastic tipped. Where stainless steel reinforcement is specified, the plastic
 tipped chairs shall be made of stainless steel conforming to the requirements of ASTM A493,
 Type 316 or 316L. Blocks used for this purpose shall be precast portland cement mortar blocks
 of approved shape and dimensions. Blocks shall not be used in cases where the blocks will be
 visible in the finished product. Layers of bars may be separated by precast portland cement
 mortar blocks or other approved devices. The use of pebbles, pieces of broken stone or brick,
 metal pipe or wooden blocks shall not be permitted. The placing of reinforcement as concrete
 placement progresses, without definite and secure means of holding the steel in its correct
 position, shall not be permitted except in the case of welded steel wire fabric or reinforcing bar
 grids.
 Epoxy-coated, dual-coated, or galvanized reinforcing bars supported on formwork shall rest
 on coated wire bar supports, or on bar supports made of dielectric material or other acceptable
 materials. Wire bar supports shall be coated with dielectric material for a minimum distance of
 2 inches from the point of contact with the reinforcing bars. Reinforcing bars used as support
 bars shall be epoxy-coated or zinc-coated as applicable. In walls, spreader bars shall be epoxycoated or zinc-coated as applicable.
 Tie wire for epoxy-coated, zinc and epoxy dual-coated, galvanized, stainless, or low-carbon
 chromium reinforcing steel shall be soft annealed wire that has been nylon, epoxy or plastic
 coated. Tie wire for stainless steel reinforcement may also be uncoated stainless steel
 conforming to the requirements of ASTM A493, Type 316 or 316L. 16 gauge (or heavier) blackannealed ferrous metal wire may also be used for low-carbon chromium or plain reinforcement.
 Stainless steel reinforcement shall not be tied to any other type of reinforcement, galvanized
 attachments or conduits, or any other dissimilar metal including concrete formwork hardware.
 
 5-58
 
 Direct contact is not acceptable. When stainless steel reinforcing must be near other steel
 reinforcing, galvanized metals, or dissimilar metal formwork hardware, a minimum of one inch
 clearance between the two metals shall be maintained. Where insufficient space exists to
 maintain this minimum, the least significant metal, subject to the Resident’s approval, may be
 sleeved with a continuous 1/8 inch minimum thickness polyethylene or nylon tube, extending at
 least one inch in each direction past the point of closest contact between the two dissimilar
 metals, and bound with nylon or polypropylene cable ties.
 When formwork for casting concrete is made of uncoated steel or stainless steel, the use of
 galvanized steel reinforcing bars shall require an electrical isolation of the formwork from the
 galvanized reinforcement. The Contractor is referred to Section X2 of ASTM A767, Guidelines
 for Use of Galvanized Reinforcing Bars with Non-Galvanized Steel Formwork, for more
 information.
 Field bending or cutting of epoxy-coated or dual-coated reinforcing bars will not be
 allowed, unless otherwise indicated on the Plans or permitted by the Resident. When field
 bending or cutting is allowed, all damaged coating areas shall be repaired in accordance with the
 patching requirements, Section 503.052. All placing and fastening related guidelines in ASTM
 A775 or A1055, Section X1, Guidelines for Job-Site Practices, shall be considered mandatory
 where not already covered by this specification.
 Bars in bridge seats shall be placed so as to clear anchor bolts.
 When specified on the Plans, reinforcing steel shall be anchored into drilled holes.
 The anchoring material shall be one of the products listed on the Maine Department of
 Transportation's Qualified Products List, Type 3 Anchoring Materials. Installation shall be in
 accordance with the manufacturer's published recommendations.
 At each anchor location, existing reinforcing shall be located to avoid drilling through
 existing bars. Where interferences are found to exist, location adjustments will be determined
 by the Resident.
 Minimum embedment lengths of reinforcing bars shall comply with the manufacturer’s
 published recommendations for the anchoring material selected. These embedment lengths shall
 be verified by the Resident before installation of the reinforcing bars. The reinforcing steel
 lengths indicated on the Plans may be reduced, at the Contractor's option, to the determined
 minimum embedment lengths.
 Reinforcement shall be inspected and approved by the Resident before any concrete is
 placed.
 503.07 Splicing Reinforcing bars shall be spliced in accordance with the requirements of
 this section, and in the locations shown on the Plans. No modifications of, or additions to, the
 splice arrangements shown on the Plans shall be made without the Resident's prior approval.
 
 5-59
 
 Any additional splices authorized shall be staggered as much as possible. All splices shall be
 made in a manner that will ensure that not less than 75 percent of the clear concrete cover and
 not less than 75 percent of the minimum clear distance to other bars will be maintained, as
 compared to the cover and clear distance requirements for the unspliced bar.
 Lapped splices shall be made by placing the bars in contact and wiring them together.
 Splice laps shall be made in accordance with the following table, unless otherwise noted on the
 Plans:

 Lap Splice lengths are based on the following parameters: Minimum center-tocenter spacing between bars of 6 inches; nominal yield strength of the reinforcing
 steel equal to 60 ksi (100 ksi for low-carbon chromium reinforcement, 75 ksi for
 stainless steel reinforcement); minimum 28-day compressive strength of concrete
 equal to 4,000 psi; Class B tension lap splice. When any of the preceding
 parameters are altered, appropriate minimum lap splice lengths will be as shown
 on the Plans. When lap splices are placed horizontally in an element where the
 concrete depth below the splice will be 12 inches, or more, the indicated lap
 splice lengths shall be multiplied by a factor of 1.4.
 
 Mechanical couplers may be used for splicing reinforcing bars, provided they are approved
 by the Resident and conform to the following requirements:
 a. Tension Couplers Couplers shall be able to develop 1.25 times the theoretical yield
 strength of the spliced bar in tension. Bolted and wedge-lock type couplers will not be
 allowed.
 b. Compression Couplers Couplers shall be capable of maintaining the spliced bars in
 alignment prior to and during concrete placement. For reinforcing bars designed to act in
 compression, the individual bar ends shall be within 1-½ degrees of being "square" to the
 final 12 inches of the bar. Additionally, abutting bar ends shall be in contact, and the angle
 of the gap between abutting bar ends shall be 3 degrees, or less.
 c. Mechanical Couplers Any mechanical couplers using a threaded splicer and dowel in
 combination, requiring a lapped splice with the reinforcing bars, shall have a minimum lap
 splice length as required by this Section.
 
 5-60
 
 Welded splices may be made by the "Thermit" process or, with the approval of the
 Resident, by the shielded metal arc welding process or the self-shielded flux-core arc welding
 process. The latter two processes shall be used in strict conformance with the requirements of
 the latest edition of AWS D1.4 "Structural Welding Code - Welding Reinforcing Steel" and any
 applicable provisions of Section 504, Structural Steel. The Contractor shall submit complete
 details of their proposed method of making welded splices for the Resident's approval.
 503.08 Lapping Sections of welded steel wire fabric shall be securely fastened to adjoining
 sections and overlapped. All laps for wire sizes D4 thru D20 shall be 14 inches.
 Reinforcing bar grids shall be spliced as required for the individual bars, per the table in
 Section 503.07, Splicing.
 503.09 Substitution Substitution of different size bars shall not be permitted except with
 the written authorization of the Resident.
 503.10 Method of Measurement Reinforcing steel bars, either plain, galvanized, stainless,
 epoxy-coated, zinc and epoxy dual-coated, or low-carbon chromium, shall be measured by the
 computed number of pounds or by the lump sum, of steel reinforcement authorized, as indicated
 in the Contract. Welded steel wire fabric shall be measured by the computed number of pounds
 or by the lump sum of fabric authorized, as indicated in the Contract. Splices made using
 mechanical devices or by welding, as shown on the Plans or required by the specifications, will
 be measured as the number of splices of each kind satisfactorily made and accepted.
 Weights will be computed in accordance with the following:
 For steel bars, either plain, galvanized, stainless, epoxy-coated, zinc and epoxy dual-coated,
 or low-carbon chromium, weights will be computed in accordance with the following table:

 No addition to, or deduction from, the theoretical weight per foot of the uncoated bars will
 be made because of additional requirements for blast cleaning and epoxy, zinc, or dual-coating
 of the bars.
 Lapped splices and splices made using mechanical devices or by welding, that are
 authorized at the Contractor's request, will not be measured for payment.
 503.11 Basis of Payment The accepted quantity of reinforcing steel, either plain, stainless
 or low carbon chromium, will be paid for at the Contract unit price per pound or by the lump
 sum, for each item involved, complete, and accepted.
 The accepted quantity of epoxy-coated, galvanized or zinc and epoxy dual-coated
 reinforcing steel will be paid for at the Contract unit price per pound or by the lump sum, for
 each item involved, complete and accepted, and all additional expenses that may be incurred by
 the Contractor or their suppliers as a result of the requirements in these specifications will be
 considered incidental to, and included in, the Contract unit price per pound or lump sum price.
 When reinforcing steel schedules are required, they shall be considered incidental to the
 related Contract items. Payment for work associated with revisions to the reinforcing steel
 schedule, required when the Department allows the use of precast concrete deck panels, or any
 other significant changes that affect the quantity of reinforcing steel, shall be considered
 incidental to related Contract items.
 The accepted quantity of welded steel wire fabric will be paid for at the Contract unit price
 per pound or by the lump sum, in place, complete and accepted.

 504.14 Materials for Bridges The grade of steel is designated on the Plans. Do not
 substitute material without the approval of the Fabrication Engineer.
 
 5-67
 
 504.15 Handling Material Handle material in a manner that prevents nicks, gouges or other
 damage from chains, wire ropes or other handling devices during all phases of fabrication.
 504.16 Plates for Fabricated Members Cut plates subject to calculated stress, including
 splice plates, so that the direction of rolling is parallel to the primary stresses. The direction of
 primary stresses for web and field splice material is parallel to the flanges unless otherwise
 shown. Transfer heat numbers to each primary member used in fabrication. Primary members
 include flanges, webs, splice plates, bearing stiffeners, connection plates and diaphragm material
 on curved bridges.
 504.17 Correcting Materials Correct material by a method that does not damage the
 material. If heating of the steel is required, submit a written procedure to the Fabrication
 Engineer for review. Do not use external force in conjunction with heating unless authorized in
 the procedure. Following corrective work, inspect the steel with nondestructive testing methods
 acceptable to the Fabrication Engineer. The presence of cracks or fractures will be cause for
 rejection of the material.
 504.18 Base Metal Repairs Make base metal repairs in accordance with the D1.5 Code.
 Submit an NCR to the Fabrication Engineer for review if the repair area exceeds the allowable
 limits for base metal repairs as specified in the D1.5 Code. Notify the QAI prior to beginning
 the repairs.

 * A radius of 5t is required if the plate is subject to calculated stresses
 (c) If a smaller radius is required, heat the bend line to a temperature between 1000º F
 and 1150º F before bending. Heat plates greater than 2 inches in thickness to a temperature
 of between 900º F and 1150º F before bending. Do not heat HPS70W without written
 approval of the Fabrication Engineer.
 504.23 Die Stamping Die stamp primary members (including splice material, diaphragms
 and cross frames on curved bridges) in no-stress locations. No-stress locations include the ends
 of girders within the cross-sectional area, web splice plates in the middle third of the plate height
 and outside the outermost row of bolt holes and flange splice plate ends between the outermost
 row of holes and the edge. Use blunt-nose, low-stress dies.
 504.24 Camber and Curvature When camber or curvature is required for stringers or girders,
 it will be specified on the Plans. Measure and record specified camber or curvature using the
 same ordinates shown on the reviewed shop drawings after all welding is complete. When no
 camber or curvature is specified, variations in straightness of rolled shapes, with and without
 cover plates, shall not exceed the tolerances of AASHTO M 160 (ASTM A 6).
 504.25 Heat Cambering and Curving Minor correction of camber or sweep of welded plate
 girders is considered part of ordinary shop fabrication practice and does not require an approved
 procedure, however, use the following guidelines:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 
 Notify the QAI prior to beginning heat correction
 Do not use hammers
 Have suitable temperature indicating crayons at the work station
 Do not exceed 1150º F
 Cool in still air to 600 º F. Below 600 º F compressed air may be used
 
 All cambering and curving operations that are not corrective shall meet the following:
 Use a camber/curving procedure reviewed by the Fabrication Engineer. The procedure shall
 include:
 1. The heating pattern and sequencing of heating
 2. Method of support of the member
 3. Proposed minimum and maximum base metal temperature
 4. Method of heating (fuel, nozzle size, etc.)
 Clean structural steel to SSPC SP-6 prior to heating. Heat both the flanges and the web using
 two torches (one torch on either side of the plate). Do not use restraint or jacking devices unless
 approved by the Fabrication Engineer. Submit calculations showing that the nominal bending
 stress in the member does not exceed 0.60 Fy if restraint or jacking is proposed.
 
 5-69
 
 The target temperature for all ASTM A709 steel is 1100º F. Steel heated in excess of 1200 F
 will be subject to rejection. Measure the temperature of the steel with temperature indicating
 crayons applied to the heated area 10-15 seconds after the torch is removed or with a pyrometer
 that has been calibrated within the past year. Provide temperature-indicating crayons in
 increments of 50 º F between 1050º F and 1250º F to each torch operator. Stop the
 cambering/curving operation if a torch operator fails to demonstrate the proper skill and
 technique necessary to prevent potential damage to the steel.
 Camber stringers and girders using a “V” pattern with a 10-15 degree included angle that
 extends the full web depth, less 2 inches at the apex. Heat the web first beginning at the apex of
 the triangle and proceeding toward the base. Begin heating the flange immediately after
 completion of the web.
 The Contractor may curve stringers and girders using a combination of line heats applied to the
 edge of both flanges simultaneously with automatic track torches and "V" heats. "V" heats shall
 have an included angle of 15-30 degrees and a minimum height of 65% of the flange width.
 Apply heat to adjacent areas on both flanges simultaneously.
 Perform all cambering and curving in the presence of the QAI. Heating a structural member
 without the QAI present shall be cause for rejection of the member. Measure and record camber
 and sweep after the steel has reached ambient temperature and all stiffeners and connection
 plates have been welded.
 504.26 Welding Qualify welders and Weld Procedure Specifications in accordance with the
 most recent edition of the D1.5 Code. Provide a list of qualified welders including process and
 position to the QAI prior to beginning fabrication. Submit the Weld Procedure Specifications to
 the Fabrication Engineer for review prior to beginning work. Weld Procedure Specifications
 previously reviewed and still valid in accordance with the D1.5 Code are acceptable without resubmission.
 The range of heat input for Complete Joint Penetration groove welds is between 40
 kilojoules/inch (kj/in) and 90 kj/in for single-arc processes. Fillet welds joining primary
 members shall have a minimum heat input of 35 kj/in. Make runoff tabs in accordance with the
 D1.5 Code.
 504.27 Welding Requirements Calibrate welding equipment at the intervals indicated in the
 D1.5 Code. Meters shall be accurate within 2% throughout the range of the WPS. Work done
 with equipment that is not properly calibrated will be rejected. Provide copies of the calibration
 records to the QAI. The QAI can require the Contractor to demonstrate the accuracy of the
 meters at any time.
 Display a copy of the applicable Weld Procedure Specification at each welding station. Weld
 within the parameters of the Weld Procedure Specification. Failure to display a Weld Procedure
 Specification at the welding station will make all welding performed at that station subject to
 rejection.
 
 5-70
 
 Perform all preheat, welding and postheat in accordance with the D1.5 Code and this
 Specification.
 Provide the appropriate temperature indicating crayons at each workstation to verify preheat.
 Calibrated digital thermometers may be used with the approval of the Fabrication Engineer
 instead of temperature indicating crayons.
 Weld flange plate and web plate butt joints, web to flange welds, stiffener and connection plate
 to web welds, and cover plate to flange welds using an automatic weld process.
 Make repairs with the same process used for the original welds, except that repairs less than 12
 inches in length may be made with a different process using an approved Weld Procedure
 Specification. Do not blend repair welds by grinding unless the original weld requires grinding.
 504.28 Welded Fabrication Each side of complete joint penetration welds, once begun, shall
 be welded to completion without interruption or a delay between passes except as necessary to
 maintain interpass temperature requirements. After backgouging, the groove and 3 inches on
 either side of the groove and through the thickness of the steel shall be preheated in accordance
 with the D1.5 Code immediately before the resumption of welding.
 Single-pass fillet welds may be qualified by a Fillet Weld Soundness Test performed in
 accordance with the D1.5 Code as modified herein. Perform the “T” test by welding the smallest
 fillet weld to be used in production on one side and the largest fillet weld used in production on
 the other side of the “T”. Macroetch the test specimens in accordance with the requirements of
 Clause 5, Method of Testing Specimens, of the D1.5 Code. Acceptance and re-testing, if
 required, shall be in accordance with Clause 5 Test Results Required and Retests, of the D1.5
 Code.
 The minimum heat input for single-pass fillet welds during testing and production shall be 35
 kilojoules/in.
 504.29 Welding ASTM A 709 HPS 70W Steel In addition to 504.28, use the most recent
 edition of the D1.5 Code and the Fab Guide as amended herein when welding ASTM A 709 Gr.
 HPS 70W. Use only consumables that produce weld metal with diffusible hydrogen of H8or
 less. Handle and store consumables in accordance with the requirements of Clause 12 of the
 D1.5 Code. Preheat in accordance with Clause 4 of the D1.5 Code through the thickness of the
 steel and three inches in all directions from the weldment. Failure to properly preheat the steel
 will result in rejection of the weld metal. Remove and re-weld rejected weldments.
 HPS 70W may be joined to Grade 50W steel using a Weld Procedure Specification qualified for
 Grade 50W steel if the diffusible hydrogen content of the deposited weld metal is H8 or less.
 Use minimum preheat temperature for Gr. HPS 70W in accordance with the D1.5 Code.
 
 5-71
 
 Make weld runoff tabs for Gr. HPS 70W in accordance with the D1.5 Code except make them
 six (6) inches long. Remove runoff tabs and grind butt welds prior to nondestructive
 examination.
 504.30 Nondestructive Testing Perform nondestructive testing in accordance with the D1.5
 Code and these Specifications. The QAI will witness nondestructive testing. Give the QAI
 adequate notice to facilitate the QAI’s presence. Failure to notify the QAI will result in retesting with the QAI present. Document nondestructive testing on the appropriate forms from
 Annex III of the D1.5 Code, or an equivalent form.
 504.31 Shop Assembly Assemble stringers and girders in accordance with the shop
 assembly drawings. Measure and record the bearing-to-bearing dimensions, the bearing-tofield-splice dimensions and the offset from the reference line dimensions as shown on the shop
 assembly drawings. Give the QAI the opportunity to verify the measurements prior to
 disassembly.
 504.32 Tolerances Dimensional tolerances for welded plate girders are described in the
 D1.5 Code. Dimensional tolerances for rolled shapes are described in AASHTO M 160
 (ASTM A6). The tolerance for the length of any primary bridge member is ±1/4 inch. The
 bearing-to-bearing tolerance is ±1/8 inch. The bearing elevation tolerance is ±1/8 inch. The
 offset tolerance for bolted field splices is ±3/4 inch.
 504.33 Match marking Match mark drill assembled or ream assembled field splice material
 prior to disassembly. Preserve the match marking through field erection.
 504.34 Holes for High Strength Bolts Oversize holes are not allowed unless noted on the
 Plans. Drill bolt holes full-size. Splice plates may be used as one-time templates to drill webs
 and flanges. The plates shall remain with the splice. Replace damaged plates used as a
 template. The Contractor may temporarily tack weld web splice plates to the web in the middle
 1/3 of the web only. Completely remove tack welds by grinding and MT the tack areas. Do not
 tack weld flange splice plates to flanges.
 Holes for cross frames, diaphragms and associated connection plates may be punched when the
 thickness of the plate is ≤ 3/8 inch. The diameter of the die shall not exceed the diameter of the
 punch by more than 1/16 inch. Holes shall be clean cut, without torn or ragged edges.
 Make holes cylindrical and perpendicular to the member. Remove burrs from parts after drilling
 or reaming. Remove all visible drilling oil, lubricants and coolants, including water soluble
 lubricants and coolants from faying surfaces in accordance with SSPC-SP 1-Solvent Cleaning.
 The Contractor may thermal cut holes in bearing base plates using an automatic process. Do not
 exceed a surface roughness of ANSI 1000 micro-inches.
 504.35 Accuracy of Holes Following the completion of the drilling of holes in a contiguous
 group, with all plies of a connection in their proper position for assembly, all bolt holes shall
 
 5-72
 
 accept a pin 1/32 inch smaller in diameter than the nominal bolt hole diameter. Provide a pin of
 the applicable diameter for inspection purposes.
 No finished bolt hole shall be located more than 1/8 inch from its theoretical location. The
 repair of mislocated holes shall be subject to the approval of the Fabrication Engineer.
 504.36 Shop Bolts Install shop bolts in accordance with this Specification except that
 adequately lubricated fastener assemblies that have been Rotational Capacity (Ro Cap) tested by
 the supplier do not need to be Ro Cap tested prior to installation. As an alternative, Tension
 Control (TC) bolts meeting the requirements of ASTM F1852 may be used with the approval of
 the Fabrication Engineer. Submit a tensioning procedure for TC bolts to the Resident for
 review.
 504.37 Bearings Finish bearings, base plates and other contact surfaces to the requirements
 of Section 523.
 504.38 Marking and Delivery Mark each piece as shown on the Shop Drawings. Place
 erection marks, match marks and piece marks where they will not be exposed on the finished
 structure.
 Notify the Fabrication Engineer after the girders and stringers have been loaded on trailers and
 prior to shipment. Furnish the Resident copies of shipping documents and erection diagrams.
 Package bolts of each length and diameter, along with the required number of nuts and washers
 in waterproof containers. Attach a list of the fastener assemblies, including the identifying
 shipping lot number and Rotational-Capacity lot number in a waterproof envelope to the outside
 of the container.
 504.39 Handling and Storing Materials Store beams and girders in an upright position on
 platforms, skids or other supports above the ground. Support material in a manner that will
 prevent damage due to excessive deflection and torsion. Do not use chains and wire rope slings
 in direct contact with fabricated members when being lifted or transported. Store bolts under
 sheltered conditions at all times.
 BRIDGE STEEL ERECTION
 504.40 Plans Provide the Resident with a steel erection plan for review prior to beginning
 steel erection. Schedule a pre-steel erection meeting at the jobsite prior to the delivery of the
 steel to discuss the erection plan, personnel qualifications, adequacy of tools and equipment and
 any other areas of concern to the Resident. If fabrication and erection of the Superstructure are
 done under separate contracts, the Department will furnish detailed Plans for the Bridge or
 Bridges to the Contractor.
 504.41 Methods and Equipment Submit plans for any false work and/or modifications to an
 existing structure necessitated by construction loading to the Fabrication Engineer. The false
 
 5-73
 
 work and/or modifications shall be designed, constructed and maintained for the loads placed
 upon it. False work calculations and design shall be stamped by a licensed Professional
 Engineer. The review by the Fabrication Engineer shall not relieve the Contractor of the
 responsibility for the safety of the method, equipment or from carrying out the work in
 accordance with the plans and Specifications. Do not build or erect false work until the
 Fabrication Engineer has reviewed and returned the plan.
 504.42 Bearings and Anchorages Finish bridge seats true to line and grade. Do not place
 bearings upon bridge seats that are improperly finished.
 Cast anchor rods in place or set them in drilled holes. If the anchor rods are set in drilled holes,
 use an anchoring material from the MDOT Qualified Products List. Anchor rods shall be
 capable of developing unconfined pullout strength of 30 Kips and 70 Kips for 1 inch and 1½inch anchor rods respectively.
 The Department reserves the right to perform in-place pullout tests. Replace bolts failing to meet
 the pullout strength requirements.
 Set bearings so that they are plumb or centered at 45 º F.
 504.43 Assembling Steel Clean all faying surfaces before assembly. Use drift pins in both
 the web and flange connections to assure alignment of all holes. Use a minimum of eight drift
 pins in each flange and web connection. Install and tension a minimum of 50% of the bolts in
 each contiguous group before the member is released from the crane. Tension field splices
 within 72 hours of bolt installation. Protect splices from rain or other conditions that will, in the
 opinion of the Resident, degrade the lubrication on the bolts.
 504.44 Connections Using High Strength Bolts Provide all necessary torque and power
 wrenches, calibration equipment, feeler gauges and labor required for the testing, calibration,
 installation and inspection of high strength bolts. Provide a tension-measuring device
 (Skidmore-Wilhelm or approved equal) and torque wrench, both of which have been calibrated
 within 12 months, and are in good condition. Provide calibration documentation. Both the
 tension-measuring device and the torque wrench shall remain at the job site during steel
 erection. The torque wrench shall have a maximum capacity that is approximately 100% greater
 than the anticipated job torque. Torque wrenches shall be equipped with a dial face gauge and a
 memory pointer that remains at the applied torque reading. Torque wrenches shall be graduated
 in increments not to exceed two percent of the maximum capacity of the wrench and shall be
 readable to one percent of the maximum capacity.
 504.45 Bolts, Nuts, Washers and Direct Tension Indicators Protect fasteners from dirt and
 moisture. Take only as many fasteners as anticipated to be installed during a work shift from
 protected storage. Return unused fasteners to protected storage at the end of the workday.
 Clean and lubricate rusty and dirty fasteners prior to installation with a lubricant recommended
 by the bolt supplier or manufacturer. Tension Control (TC) fasteners shall only be re-lubricated
 by the manufacturer.
 
 5-74
 
 Surfaces in contact with the bolt head and nut shall not have a slope more than 1 to 20 with
 respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis. Where an outer face of the bolted parts has a slope of
 more than 1 to 20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis, a hardened beveled washer
 shall be used. Bolted parts shall fit solidly together when assembled. All faying surfaces shall
 be free of mill scale, dirt, burrs, or other material that would prevent solid seating of the parts.
 Install bolts with a hardened washer under the element turned in tightening. Hardened washers
 are required over slotted and oversize holes.
 504.46 Fastener Assemblies for Testing Provide fastener assemblies (bolt, washer, nut and
 DTI, if required) to the Resident two weeks prior to beginning steel erection for testing.
 Randomly select and package four assemblies of each lot, length and diameter for independent
 verification testing. Identify each size fastener assembly separately with the lot numbers of the
 bolt/washer/nut/DTI combinations clearly marked. The cost of the assemblies is incidental to
 the appropriate contract items. Replace unacceptable fastener assembly lots.
 504.47 Verification Perform a Rotational Capacity Test (RCT) for each Rotational Capacity
 (R-C) lot at the job site immediately prior to installation. Do not use fasteners assemblies that
 have been used to perform the RCT in the final assembly of the steel.
 If DTI’s are used, perform a DTI Verification Test for each production lot immediately prior to
 installation.
 Give the Department adequate notification in order to witness both the RCT and DTI
 verification tests.
 504.48 Rotational Capacity Test The RCT is intended to verify the effectiveness of the
 lubricant and the compatibility of the components of the fastener assembly. The test shall be
 conducted using a tension-measuring device (Skidmore-Wilhelm or equivalent) and a torque
 wrench. Select two fastener assemblies of each length and diameter from each R-C lot. Perform
 the RCT in the following manner:
 1. Insert the fastener assembly in the tension-measuring device using enough hardened
 washers under the nut (a minimum of one) so that there is full nut engagement (threads flush
 with the end of the nut) and no more than 3 threads visible after the assembly is brought to a
 snug-tight condition with a hand wrench (approximately 10% of the Minimum Installation
 Tension from Table 1).
 2. Mark the faceplate of the tension measuring device with a line at 0º, 120º, 180º, and
 240º. Mark the torque wrench socket so that the total amount of nut rotation can be measured
 and recorded. Note: the lines are for measuring total rotation of the turned element and have
 nothing to do with minimum installation tension.
 
 5-75
 
 3. Bring the fastener assembly to at least the Minimum Installation Tension from Table 1
 using the torque wrench.
 4. At a point after the required Minimum Installation Tension has been achieved, measure
 and record the tension and the torque. Take the reading as close as possible to the Minimum
 Installation Tension from Table 1.

 6. Measure and record the tension after total rotation of the nut. The measured tension
 must be equal to or greater than the Turn Test Tension value shown in Table 1 for the diameter
 bolt being tested. If the measured tension is less than the required Turn Test Tension, the
 fastener assembly has failed.
 7. Upon completion of steps 1 through 6:
 (a) The torque measured in step 4 shall not exceed the value obtained by the
 following equation:
 Measured Torque ≤ 0.25PD Where:
 P = Measured Bolt Tension -pounds (Step 4)
 D = Nominal Bolt Diameter -feet
 (bolt diameter in Inches divided by 12)
 (b) If the torque measured in step 4 is greater than the torque calculated in step 7, the
 fastener has failed the test. Re-lubricate all fasteners in the lot and re-test.
 
 5-76
 
 (c) Disassemble each fastener assembly and run the nut down the full length of the
 threads excluding the grip length (the length between the bolt head and washer
 face of the nut). If evidence is found of torsional failure, shear failure or stripping
 of the threads, the assembly failed the test. Slight necking in the grip length is not
 a failure.
 (d) If either bolt assembly fails the test, the R-C lot has failed. Re-lubricate all
 bolts from that lot and perform the test again. If either bolt fails the second test,
 the R-C lot shall be rejected.
 8.
 
 Test bolts that are too short to fit in the tension-measuring device in a solid joint such
 as a bearing stiffener or connection plate. The hole in the joint may not be more than
 1/16 inch greater in diameter than the bolt being tested. Randomly select two fastener
 assemblies from each R-C lot. Mark the nut relative to the steel joint in such a
 manner that rotation can be measured. Snug tighten the bolt with a spud wrench using
 approximately the same effort used to snug-tighten longer bolts in a tension measuring
 device. Restrain the bolt with a wrench to prevent rotation. Rotate the nut from snug
 tight to 1/3 turn with a torque wrench. Record the torque required to reach that
 rotation while the turned element is in motion. If the measured torque exceeds the
 maximum torque listed in Table 3 the fasteners have failed the test. If the fasteners
 fail the first test, re-lubricate all fasteners from that R-C lot, randomly select two
 samples and re-test. If there is no stripping or fracture the fasteners pass. If the either
 fastener fails the second test, the R-C lot is rejected.

 9. Discard bolts used for the Rotational Capacity Test.
 504.49 DTI Verification Test Perform the DTI Verification Test for each production lot of
 DTIs in combination with each R-C lot of fasteners. If any of the three test assemblies fails,
 three additional samples from the same production lot shall be tested as the first. If any of the
 three samples fails the second test, the lot shall be rejected. Perform the test in TWO STEPS:
 1. Step 1 is a test to determine that the DTI’s are acceptable when the
 fastener is brought to the minimum allowable tension.
 a) Randomly select three fastener assemblies from each R-C lot.
 b) Install each bolt in the tension-measuring device with the bolt head bearing
 against the faceplate (the front of the tension-measuring device). Place the DTI under
 the bolt head with the protrusions bearing against the washer face of the bolt. This is

 done so that the DTI is accessible for inspection with a feeler gauge. Install the nut
 and hardened washer using a filler sleeve between the bolt bushing (the back of the
 tension-measuring device) and the hardened washer under the nut. Two or more
 hardened washers may be used under the nut instead of a filler sleeve if the washers
 do not interfere with the proper operation of the tension-measuring device. When the
 bolt is brought to snug-tight condition, there should be 3 to 5 threads visible.
 c) Using two wrenches, one to restrain the unturned element of the bolt assembly,
 tighten the nut to the Bolt Tension listed in Table 4. If an impact wrench is used,
 tighten the bolt to approximately 50% of the required tension and use a torque
 wrench to bring the fastener to the required tension.

 After completing step 1, the bolt shall be further tightened to the smallest gap to
 be used during installation. Normally, this is defined as a condition where all
 gaps refuse a 0.005 inch gage but at least one visible gap remains.
 
 b) Remove the bolt from the tension measuring device and turn the nut on the
 threads of the bolt by hand. If the nut can be run the length of the threads, excluding the
 thread run out, the DTI lot is acceptable. If the nut is unable to run the thread length at
 the smallest gap condition (defined in a) above), the test shall be performed again using a
 larger acceptance gap.

 504.50 Installation and Tensioning High Strength Bolts Select one of the methods listed
 below for installing and tensioning high strength bolts. Do not use standard torque determined
 by the use of tables or formulas that attempt to relate torque to tension.
 504.51 Installation Install a hardened washer under the turned element and a hardened
 washer on oversize holes. Install fasteners in all holes in a contiguous group, except for holes
 containing drift pins and bring them to a snug tight condition, progressing systematically from
 the most severely restrained location in a connection to the free edges. Do not remove the drift
 pins until a minimum of 50% of the fasteners have been tensioned. Do not force the bolts. If
 the bolts cannot be installed easily by hand, correct the hole alignment by installing more drift
 pins.
 504.52 Tensioning Install and tension bolts by: (1) the Calibrated Wrench method, (2) the
 Turn of Nut method, (3) with Direct Tension Indicators or (4) Alternative Design Fasteners.
 Tension the fasteners systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to the free edges.
 1. The Calibrated Wrench Method Adjustable pneumatic wrenches, adjustable hydraulic
 wrenches or torque wrenches may be used.
 Calibrate the wrench used for tensioning bolts at least once each shift with fastener assemblies
 of each diameter, length and R-C lot to be installed. Calibrate pneumatic wrenches any time a
 section of hose has been added or eliminated. Calibrate pneumatic wrenches any time the
 compressor is changed.
 Randomly select five fastener assemblies of each length and R-C lot for wrench calibration.
 Install each of the fastener assemblies in the tension measuring device and install enough
 washers so at least three but no more than five threads are showing. Install at least one hardened
 washer under the turned element. Snug the bolt using the same procedure to be used during
 installation.
 If the wrench is an adjustable pneumatic wrench or an adjustable hydraulic wrench, set the
 adjustment so that each of the three assemblies is tensioned to no less than the Minimum
 Installation Tension specified in Table 4 above.
 If a torque wrench is used, tension five randomly selected fastener assemblies to the minimum
 tension specified in Table 4. Record the torque readings. Discard the high and low torque
 reading. The job installation torque shall be the average of the three remaining torque values.
 When bolts are too short to fit in the tension-measuring device, install five randomly selected
 fasteners in a solid joint with a hole diameter no greater than 1/16 inch the nominal bolt
 diameter. Rotate each assembly 1/3 turn and record the torque. Discard the high and low torque
 reading. The job installation torque shall be the average of the three remaining torque values.
 Bolts used to calibrate wrenches may be re-used.
 
 5-79
 
 2. The “Turn of Nut” Method Perform the Turn of Nut calibration once, prior to fastener
 installation, for each diameter, length and R-C lot.
 Select a random sample of no less than three fastener assemblies of each diameter, length and RC lot. Install each assembly in a tension-measuring device. Bring the fastener assembly to snug
 tight (approximately 10% of the minimum installation tension from Table 4). Match mark the
 socket to reference points on the tension-measuring device in order to accurately determine nut
 rotation. Tighten the bolt to the required rotation specified in Table 6. Record the tensions for
 each diameter, length and R_C lot. The average of the three tension readings shall be no less
 than the Minimum Installation Tension specified in Table 4. If any of the three fastener
 assemblies does not achieve minimum installation tension at the specified rotation, select three
 more and re-test. Increase the minimum rotation if necessary.
 Snug all the bolts in a contiguous group. Rotate the turned element the appropriate amount
 rotation specified in TABLE 6. The unturned element shall be held by a wrench to prevent
 rotation during tightening.

 Nut rotation is relative to bolt, regardless of the element (nut of bolt) being turned.
 2
 For bolts tensioned with ½ turn or less, the tolerance shall be plus or minus 30 degree. For
 bolts tensioned with more than ½ turn, the tolerance shall be plus or minus 45 degrees.
 3
 No research work has been performed by the Research Council on Riveted and Bolted
 Structural Joints to establish the turn-of-nut procedure when bolt lengths exceed 12 diameters,
 therefore, the required rotation must be determined by actual tests in a suitable tensionmeasuring device simulating the actual condition.
 3. Tensioning Fastener Assemblies with DTI’s Tension fasteners using DTI’s so that a 0.005
 inch feeler gage is refused in at least the number of gaps shown in Table 7 and a minimum of
 one visible gap remains. Tightening beyond crushing the DTI shall be cause for rejection of the
 fastener assembly.

 4. Alternate Design Fasteners Alternate design fasteners that are designed to indicate bolt
 tension indirectly or tension bolts automatically may be used only with the approval of the
 Fabrication Engineer. Alternate design fasteners shall meet the chemical and mechanical
 requirements of AASHTO M 164M / M 164 (ASTM A 325/ A 325M) and shall have the same
 body diameter of similar traditional fasteners and not less than the same bearing area under the
 head and nut as a similar heavy hex fastener.
 Provide a detailed written installation procedure from the fastener manufacturer to the
 Fabrication Engineer for approval prior to beginning bolt installation. The Fabrication Engineer
 may modify or place restrictions on the installation procedure prior to approval.
 Calibrate three random samples in a tension-measuring device. Each fastener shall achieve the
 Minimum Bolt Tension from Table 4 when installed and tensioned in accordance with the
 approved installation procedure. If any of the three fasteners fails to achieve 100% of the
 Minimum Bolt Tension, a retest of five fastener assemblies from the same lot may be
 performed. If any of the five fastener assemblies fails to achieve 100% of the Minimum Bolt
 Tension, the lot shall be rejected. The Resident may require re-calibration of the fasteners if the
 condition of the fasteners has significantly changed.
 Tension alternate design fasteners immediately after installation. Alternate design fasteners are
 extremely dependent on proper lubrication and thread condition. Handle and store fasteners in
 accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. Fasteners that have been improperly
 handled or stored shall be rejected.
 504.53 Inspection Inspect all completed joints within 72 hours following completion of
 tensioning each joint or contiguous group of fasteners.
 Use the following inspection procedure:
 1. The Contractor, in the presence of the Resident shall use a calibrated torque wrench as an
 inspection tool.
 2.
 At least once each day, tighten a representative sample of five bolts from each diameter,
 length and Ro-Cap lot used in the work in the tension-measuring device to the Minimum Bolt
 Tension specified in Table 6. Place a washer under the turned element of each bolt assembly.
 The job inspection torque shall be the average of three values after rejecting the high and low
 values.
 
 5-81
 
 3. Bolts represented by the sample in the preceding paragraph which have been tightened in the
 structure shall be inspected by applying, in the tightening direction, the inspection wrench and
 the job inspection torque to a minimum of 10% of the bolts, but not less than two bolts, selected
 at random, in each connection. If any nut or bolt is turned more than five degrees
 (approximately one inch at a twelve inch radius) by the application of the job inspection torque,
 all bolts in the connection shall be tested. Alternatively, the Contractor or Erector may re-tighten
 all the bolts in the connection before the specified inspection.
 4. For joints using DTI’s, inspection will consist of verifying that the DTI has the minimum
 number of refusals required from Table 9 and the minimum gap allowed in the work (from the
 DTI Verification Test) remains in at least one space.
 5. At the Resident’s option, if the Quality Assurance Inspector witnesses the initial and final
 tensioning of fasteners in a joint using the “Turn of Nut” method and finds it acceptable, no
 further inspection will be required.
 504.54 Reuse of Bolts Reuse only black AASHTO M164M/M164 (ASTM A325/A325M)
 bolts. Do not reuse galvanized fasteners.
 504.55 Field Welding Welders shall have in their possession a valid certification for the
 process and position to be used in production from the American Welding Society or other
 organization acceptable to the Resident.
 Submit a written Weld Procedure Specification for each joint to the Fabrication Engineer for
 review. Provide the Weld Procedure Specification to the welder and Resident prior to beginning
 welding. Do not perform field welding without an approved Weld Procedure Specification.
 Power sources shall have meters indicating amperage/voltage that have been calibrated within 1
 year.
 Field welding and nondestructive examination of field welds shall be done in conformance with
 the requirements of the D 1.5 Code.
 504.56 Misfits The correction of misfits involving minor reaming will be considered a
 legitimate part of steel erection. Errors in shop fabrication or deformation from handling and
 transportation that prevents the proper assembling and fit-up of parts by the use of drift pins or
 by reaming (not to exceed 10% of the holes in a contiguous array) shall be reported immediately
 to the Resident. Provide a written proposal for correction to the Fabrication Engineer. Do not
 make any field corrections that involve cutting or welding without the permission of the
 Resident.

 A bonding material shall be used for bonding fresh concrete or patching material to existing
 hardened concrete. The bonding material shall consist of the following, except that, in the
 case where patching materials from the QPL are used in the repair areas, the manufacturer’s
 published recommendations regarding application and use of bonding materials shall take
 precedence:
 a) For repair of Upward Facing Surfaces, the bonding grout shall have Portland cement
 and fine aggregate proportioned 3 to 1, respectively, by volume. The fine aggregate
 shall be from the same source as that used in the repair concrete. All material greater
 than ⅛ inch shall be removed from the fine aggregate. The sand and cement shall be
 measured separately in equal sized containers. The sand shall be added prior to the
 cement. Water shall be added during the mixing process a little at a time until
 sufficient water has been added to result in a workable consistency. A workable
 consistency is defined as the minimum water necessary to allow flow of most of the
 grout without segregation of the grout ingredients. Alternately, the Contractor may
 use a product from the Department’s QPL of concrete bonding agents, in accordance
 with the manufacturer’s published recommendations.
 b) For repair of Vertical and Overhead Surfaces, the Contractor shall use a product from
 the Department’s QPL of concrete bonding agents, in accordance with the
 manufacturer’s published recommendations.
 518.03 Removal of Unsound Concrete Removal of existing concrete shall be accomplished
 without damage to the portion of the structure that is to remain. The deteriorated or delaminated
 concrete shall first be removed from areas designated by the Resident. The initial classification
 of an area as sound concrete does not prevent its subsequent reclassification upon further
 inspection. After the initial removal of unsound concrete, the Resident shall inspect the area
 again to determine whether additional areas of unsound concrete were revealed by removal
 operations and if additional concrete removal is required in the areas to be repaired. This
 process shall continue until additional areas of unsound concrete are not revealed. After the
 Resident has determined that the deteriorated concrete has been completely and satisfactorily
 removed, the perimeter of each cavity created by the removal of concrete shall be saw cut to a
 minimum depth of ⅝ inch, unless a lesser depth is required to avoid reinforcing steel. The saw
 cut shall be approximately perpendicular to the original surface. Edges of the cavity shall not be
 feathered.
 Unless otherwise approved by the Resident, the equipment used for removal of unsound
 concrete shall be chipping hammers weighing a maximum of 35 pounds and only chisel point
 bits will be allowed.
 
 5-121
 
 The surface area and depth of removal for concrete repairs shall be subject to the approval of
 the Resident.
 Deteriorated concrete shall be removed to one of the following depths, whichever is greatest:
 a) Sound substrate.
 b) To the minimum depth required per the manufacturer’s recommendations, when a
 material from the Department’s QPL for concrete patching materials is used.
 c) To the minimum depth indicated in the Thickness of Placement Table, when concrete
 is used, depending on the coarse aggregate gradation.
 d) When reinforcing steel is exposed or encountered, the minimum depth shall be 1 inch
 behind reinforcing steel for Upward Facing Surfaces and 1-½ inches behind reinforcing
 steel for Vertical and Overhead Surfaces.
 518.04 Reinforcing Steel All existing reinforcing steel exposed by concrete removal, which
 is to remain in the structure , shall be cleaned of all loose rust by sand blasting, wire brushing,
 machine wire brushing or other methods approved by the Resident. Where reinforcing steel is to
 remain in the structure, care shall be taken to prevent damage to the reinforcing steel or its bond
 to the surrounding concrete.
 All existing main reinforcing steel which is broken, or has lost 25 percent, or more, of its
 original cross sectional area, shall be supplemented with new reinforcing steel. The total area of
 supplemental bars plus existing bars with section loss shall have the same total area as the
 original bar. Supplementary reinforcing steel shall be lap spliced a minimum length of 30 bar
 diameters for bars with section loss of up to 75 percent of the original bar area, and per Section
 503, Reinforcing Steel, for all other bars. Reinforcing steel shall be wired to the existing steel
 or, where designated by the Resident, the existing reinforcing steel shall be cut and
 supplementary reinforcing steel spliced in with tension couplers.
 518.05 Surface Preparation The surfaces to receive repair material shall be free of oil,
 solvent, grease, dirt, loose particles and foreign matter. Cleaning of repair areas shall be
 performed by sandblasting or other methods approved by the Resident. All surfaces receiving
 new material are to be sandblasted not more than 36 hours ahead of the placement of the repair
 material, or as per the bonding agent manufacturer’s recommendations. Any sandblasted areas
 that have been rained on, exposed to high humidity or fog, or contaminated in any other manner
 shall be sandblasted again before the repair material is applied. All debris from the cleaning
 operations shall be thoroughly removed from the cleaned surfaces and adjacent areas using
 compressed, dry, air, prior to the application of repair materials. All air compressor lines used
 for cleaning of repair areas shall be equipped with effective oil traps.
 518.06 Application of Bonding Agent When bonding grout is used on repair of upward
 facing surfaces the following shall apply, except that, in the case where concrete patching
 
 5-122
 
 materials from the Department’s QPL are used in the repair areas, the manufacturer’s published
 recommendations regarding application and use of bonding materials shall take precedence.
 Once a workable consistency has been reached, additional water shall not be added. The grout
 must be used or discarded within 30 minutes of the time water is added to the mix. The grout
 shall be applied no greater than ⅛ inch thick with stiff bristled, nylon, street brooms. The
 Contractor shall prevent the grout from drying by beginning the grout application immediately
 prior to the concrete placement and limiting the area of grout application ahead of concrete
 placement. If the grout begins to dry prior to concrete placement, additional grout may be
 brushed on the area as directed by the Resident. Should the grout become thoroughly dry it shall
 be removed by sand blasting or other methods as approved by the Resident.
 When a bonding agent from the Department’s QPL is used, the product shall be applied
 in accordance with the manufacturer’s published recommendations.
 518.07 Placing Repair Materials When concrete is used as the repair material the provisions
 of Section 502 shall apply. Additionally, concrete shall not be placed when either the ambient
 air temperature or the existing concrete temperature is below 45 degrees Fahrenheit. When a
 patching material is used, the Contractor shall follow the manufacturer’s published
 recommendations for mixing and placing the material.
 Forms shall be erected to the neat lines of the existing structure and the new concrete placed.
 For overhead and vertical repair areas, sufficient concrete shall be removed to ensure that air
 within the area to be patched can effectively escape during the placement of the repair material.
 518.08 Curing Curing of concrete shall conform to the requirements of Section 502. For
 Overhead and Vertical Surfaces, curing compounds may be used, in accordance with the
 manufacturer’s requirements. Patching materials shall be cured in accordance with the
 manufacturer’s published recommendations.
 518.09 Inspection The Contractor shall make provisions to allow safe access to the work for
 the Resident in order to inspect the work, facilitate ongoing inspection of the work and to
 measure the work for payment purposes.
 518.10 Method of Measurement Repair of structural concrete is divided into repair areas
 less than 8 inches in depth and repair areas 8 inches in depth or greater. The repair depth shall
 be considered the average thickness of an individual repair area. The Resident shall make the
 final determination as to whether the average depth of repair is less than 8 inches, or 8 inches or
 greater.
 Concrete repair will be measured for payment by the square foot of all surfaces repaired
 where the average depth of repair is less than 8 inches, complete and accepted.
 Concrete repair will be measured for payment by the cubic yard for all repairs where the
 average depth of repair is 8 inches or greater, complete and accepted. The quantity will be
 
 5-123
 
 determined from the theoretical yield of the design mix, or in the case of transit mixed concrete,
 by delivery ticket, as directed by the Resident.

 transit mixer for temperature, air entrainment and slump flow for SCC, prior to placing the
 concrete in the forms.
 Perform all testing in the presence of the QAI. The QAI will designate the loads to be tested.
 Make cylinders used to determine release strength during the last one-third of the placement.
 Place the concrete as nearly as possible to its final location. Control the depth of each lift in
 order to minimize entrapped air voids. The maximum depth of an unconsolidated lift shall be
 18 inches. Vibrate the concrete with internal or internal and external vibrators. Do not use
 external vibrators, only. Insert internal vibrators vertically and penetrate the lower layer of
 concrete by at least 4 inches. Insert the vibrators in the concrete to assure that the radii of action
 of the vibrators overlaps. Hold the vibrators in position from 5 to 15 seconds; vibration time
 shall be reduced by 50 percent when placing SCC. Do not use vibrators to move concrete
 horizontally. Each lift of concrete shall have sufficient plasticity to be consolidated with
 subsequent lifts.
 
 5-168
 
 Do not re-temper the concrete with water after discharging has begun. The Contractor may add
 HRWR to the concrete after batching, if that practice conforms to the manufacturer's product
 data sheet. Discard concrete that becomes unworkable.
 Do not use water or water-based products to aid in finishing fresh concrete.
 After the concrete has been placed and finished, and before the forms are covered, remove all
 concrete from projecting reinforcing steel.

 standard cured. Record unit identification, entrained air content, water-cement ratio, slump flow
 and temperature of the sampled concrete at the time of cylinder casting. At least once per week,
 the Contractor shall make 2 concrete cylinders (6 cylinders when the Contract includes
 permeability requirements) for use by the Department; cylinders shall be standard cured in
 accordance with AASHTO T23 (ASTM C31).
 If the Contractor fails to make enough cylinders to demonstrate that the product meets the
 Contract requirements, the product will be considered nonconforming work.
 The compressive strength of the concrete will be determined by averaging the compressive
 strength of two test cylinders made from the same sample. For the purpose of detensioning
 prestressed products, neither of the test cylinders shall have a compressive strength less than the
 minimum required transfer strength. For the purpose of determining design strength, the
 average of two cylinders shall meet or exceed the design strength, and the difference in strength
 between the two shall be no more than 10 percent of the higher strength cylinder.
 Perform compressive strength testing to determine transfer and design strength in the presence
 of the QAI. Cylinder tests not witnessed by the QAI will not be acceptable.
 535.16 Curing by Moisture Retention Cure the concrete in accordance with MNL 116,
 Section 4.20. Moist cure the concrete until it has reached design strength.
 Do not use membrane- forming curing compounds without the approval of the Fabrication
 Engineer. If membrane-forming curing compounds are authorized, follow the requirements of
 MNL 116 and the curing compound manufacturer’s published recommendations.
 535.17 Accelerated Curing of Concrete (Optional) Cure the concrete in accordance with
 MNL 116, Section 4.19, except as modified herein.
 
 5-169
 
 After initial set, the temperature gain of the concrete shall not exceed 40 F per hour. Initial set
 shall be determined in accordance with ASTM C403, Standard Test Method for Time of Setting
 of Concrete Mixtures by Penetration Resistance; a strength gain of 500 psi indicates initial set.
 The maximum allowable concrete temperature shall be 160 F. Concrete temperature shall be
 measured near each end of the casting bed and at intervals not to exceed 100 feet. In order to
 qualify for accelerated cure, the concrete temperature shall attain a minimum temperature of
 120 F; that temperature shall be maintained for a minimum of 8 hours and the concrete shall
 achieve a minimum of 80 percent of design strength.
 Detension precast/prestressed products immediately after the completion of the curing cycle
 while the products are warm and moist. The accelerated curing cycle shall be considered
 complete when the method of supplying heat is stopped and/or the concrete temperature drops
 below 120°F. Two cylinders shall be tested immediately upon completion of the accelerated
 cure cycle. Products that have not achieved all of the above criteria shall be moist cured until
 the concrete has achieved design strength.
 If the precast/prestressed concrete products have achieved 80 percent of design strength during
 the accelerated curing cycle, no further curing will be required.
 535.18 Prestressing Tension the strands in accordance with MNL 116 and this
 Specification.
 Provide stressing calculations to the QAI prior to tensioning strands. Do not tension the strands
 until the QAI has reviewed the calculations. Apply initial force and final force to the strands in
 the presence of the QAI. The QCI shall be present to monitor and document the application of
 initial force, final force and the elongation of the strands.
 Tension strands in an orderly sequence to avoid snags and entanglements. When strands from
 two, or more, coils are used, identify the locations of the different strand lots. Calculate the
 elongation and adjusted gauge pressure readings for each modulus of elasticity and cross
 sectional area of the strands.
 Prior to tensioning, cycle the hydraulic jacking devices until the hydraulic fluid reaches normal
 operating temperature.
 After initial tensioning, establish a permanent and clearly visible reference mark on the strand to
 determine strand elongation after final tensioning. Measure the strand elongation to the nearest
 1/16 inch.
 If the strands have been tensioned for more than 48 hours without concrete being placed in the
 forms, test a minimum of 10 percent of the strands, but not less than two strands in each row and
 not less than two strands in draped strand arrays, by applying the theoretical force used during
 the final tensioning to each of the strands. If additional elongation is gained, subtract the
 amount gained from the theoretical elongation. If the result of the theoretical elongation minus
 the gain in elongation is less than the minimum allowable elongation for any of the strands
 
 5-170
 
 tested, apply the final force to all strands. Do not measure total elongation from the original
 reference mark. Accept properly tensioned strand based on the force applied to the strands.
 Measure and record the chuck-to-chuck distance on self-stressing beds after tensioning the first
 set-up and at any time the number of strands or strand array changes. Confirm that the
 measurement used in the stressing calculations is the same as the field measurement.
 535.19 Detensioning Detension the strands in accordance with MNL 116 and this
 Specification. Use a carburizing flame. Heat a minimum length of 6 inches of the strand slowly
 so that only one wire is released at a time. Cut both ends and any intermediate points
 simultaneously. Failure to maintain symmetry of cutting or causing sudden shock to the product
 will make it subject to rejection. Detension the strands in the presence of the QAI and QCI.
 Measure any strand slippage on all precast/prestressed concrete products. Mark all strands prior
 to detensioning. Measure a minimum of four strands per row. The QAI will choose the strands
 to be measured.
 535.20 Finishing Concrete and Repairing Defects Precast/prestressed concrete products
 fabricated under this Section shall meet Standard Grade finish requirements as defined in MNL
 116, except that the Contractor shall rub fascia units in accordance with Section 502 of the
 Standard Specifications. Abrasive blast fascia surfaces prior to finishing. The Contractor may
 use alternative methods of achieving an acceptable finish on fascia units, if approved by the
 Fabrication Engineer.
 Repair honeycombing, ragged or irregular edges and other non-structural or cosmetic defects
 using a patching material from the MaineDOT Qualified Products List (QPL). The repair,
 including preparation of the repair area, mixing and application and curing of the patching
 material, shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's product data sheet. Corners that are not
 exposed in the final product may be ground smooth with no further repair necessary if the depth
 of the defect does not exceed 1/2 inch. Remove form ties and other hardware to a depth of not
 less than 1 inch from the face of the concrete and patch the holes using a patching material from
 the MaineDOT QPL.
 Repair structural defects only with the approval of the Fabrication Engineer. Submit a
 nonconformance report (NCR) to the Fabrication Engineer with a proposed repair procedure.
 Do not perform structural repairs without an NCR that has been reviewed by the Fabrication
 Engineer. Structural defects include, but are not be limited to, exposed reinforcing steel or
 strand, cracks in bearing areas, through cracks and cracks 0.013 inch in width that extend more
 than 12 inches in length in any direction. Give the QAI adequate notice prior to beginning any
 structural repairs.
 Make chamfers and drip notches smooth and uniform. Sandblast keyways to remove mortar
 paste prior to shipping. Recess strand ends 1 inch and patch the holes with a patching material
 from the MaineDOT QPL. Coat the entire ends of the precast/prestressed concrete units with a
 
 5-171
 
 bituminous protective coating unless otherwise specified on the Plans or as directed by the
 Fabrication Engineer.
 535.21 Precast/prestressed Deck Panels Produce precast/prestressed deck panels in
 accordance with the Plans and Specifications. Cure the deck panels in accordance with Sections
 535.16 or 535.17.
 535.22 Tolerances Product dimensional tolerances shall be in conformance with the latest
 edition of MNL 116, Appendix B, as applicable to the particular product (e.g., slab, I-girder.
 box beam), the Plans and this Specification. Use Box Beam fabrication tolerances for voided
 slabs and use Double T tolerances for NEXT beams. In case of dispute, the Fabrication
 Engineer shall determine the allowable tolerance.
 535.23 Transportation and Storage Handle and store material using lifting devices. Handle
 and transport precast/prestressed units so that the reactions with respect to the unit shall be
 approximately the same during transportation and storage as in its final position. Do not
 transport units until the 28 day design strength has been attained.
 Support stored precast/prestressed units above the ground on dunnage in a manner to prevent
 twisting or distortion. Protect the units from discoloration and damage.
 Repair or replace precast/prestressed concrete units damaged by improper storing, hoisting or
 handling.

 shown on the Plans and in accordance with Section 523, Bearings, as applicable.
 Lift the units using the lifting devices cast into them. Support I-Girders at the abutments and
 piers to prevent overturning. Place beams and slabs in their final location in a manner that
 assures that the keyways are spaced properly and the post-tensioning ducts are in alignment.
 Use compressible gaskets around duct openings within keyways to prevent blocking of the duct
 with grout.
 Prior to grouting, initially post-tension slabs or beams to 5,000 lbs. force, per strand. Make a
 permanent and clearly visible reference mark on each strand after it has been initially posttensioned in order to determine strand elongation after final post-tensioning.
 Immediately prior to grouting, clean the keyways between slab or box units and soak the
 keyways with water in order to prevent absorption of water from the grout. Seal the bottom of
 the keyways to prevent the loss of grout.
 Fill longitudinal keyways between slabs or beams with a non-shrink, flowable, cementitious
 grout with a minimum design compressive strength of 6,000 psi at 28 days. The grout shall be a
 material for keyways from the MaineDOT QPL. Mix, place and cure the grout in accordance
 with the manufacturer's product data sheet. The Contractor may propose the use of an alternate
 
 5-172
 
 grout material supplied from a MaineDOT approved ready mixed concrete batch plant. Ready
 mixed grout shall achieve a design compressive strength of 6,000 psi at 28 days, have an
 entrained air content of between 6.0 and 9.0 percent, be non-shrink, flowable, and contain a nonshrink additive listed on the MaineDOT QPL for expansive cements. The proposed grout mix
 design shall be submitted to the Department for approval.
 Do not perform final post-tensioning of slabs or beams less than 24 hours after completion of
 the grouting operation. Final post-tension precast/prestressed concrete slabs or beams to 41,000
 lbs. force per strand, unless otherwise specified on the Plans. Provide a jacking device that has
 been calibrated in accordance with MNL 116. Provide calibration documentation, a calibration
 curve and stressing calculations to the Resident, allowing adequate time for review. Do not
 post-tension slabs or beams until the documentation has been reviewed by the Department.
 Post-tension the slabs or beams in the presence of the Resident. No vehicular traffic, including
 the Contractor’s equipment, shall be allowed on the bridge until post-tensioning is complete.
 Saw cut or abrasive cut the post-tensioning strand of slabs or beams no closer than 1-¼ inches
 from the wedges after tensioning is complete. Coat the strand ends and wedges with a corrosion
 inhibiting grease and cap the ends with a watertight cover.
 Pack and neatly finish the post-tensioning recesses of slabs or beams with a grout made of the
 same brand and type of cement used to cast the slabs or beams. Clean the post-tensioning
 recesses prior to packing the grout.
 535.25 Installation of Precast/Prestressed Deck Panels Erect deck panels as shown on the
 Plans or reviewed Working Drawings, as applicable. Adjust the bottom-of-slab elevation using
 threaded jacking devices cast into the panels, or by other means approved by the Resident.

 with these specifications and placed in conformity with the lines, grades and dimensions shown
 on the plans or established.
 601.02 Materials Materials shall conform to the requirements specified in the following
 Sections of Division 700 - Materials.
 Gabion
 Stones for Gabions
 Mattresses
 Stones for Mattresses
 
 711.02
 711.03
 711.07
 711.08
 
 601.03 Fabrication Gabions and mattresses shall be manufactured so that their sides, ends,
 lid, and diaphragm(s) can be assembled to form rectangular units of the specified dimensions.
 Gabions shall be of a single unit construction. The front, base, back and lid shall be woven
 into a single unit. The ends and diaphragm(s) shall be factory connected to the base.
 The base, sides, and two ends of mattresses shall be of a single unit construction woven into
 a single unit. Diaphragm(s) shall be factory connected to the base. The lid may be a separate
 unit.
 Perimeter edges of the mesh forming the gabion or mattress shall be securely fastened so that
 joints have at least the same strength as the wire mesh itself.
 The wire mesh shall be fabricated to be non-raveling. Non-raveling is defined as the ability
 to resist pulling apart at any of the twists or connections forming the mesh when a single wire in
 a section of mesh is cut and the section of mesh then subjected to the load test described in the
 materials specification.
 The gabion length shall be 1½, 2, 3, or 4 times its horizontal width. The horizontal width
 shall not be less than 36 in. However, all gabions furnished by the manufacturer shall be of
 uniform width. Where the gabion length exceeds 1½ times its horizontal width, the gabion shall
 be equally divided into cells by diaphragm(s) of the same mesh and gauge as the gabion body.
 Mattresses shall be at least 6 ft by 6 ft and equally divided by transverse diaphragms.
 
 6-1
 
 601.04 Assembling Gabions and mattresses shall be supplied folded flat, tied in pairs and
 packed in bundles. Single units shall be removed from the bundle; unfolded flat on the ground
 and all kinks and bends flattened.
 The units shall be assembled individually by erecting the front side, back side, ends, and
 diaphragm(s), assuring that all creases are in the correct position and the tops of all sides level.
 The four corners of each unit shall be laced first, followed by the edges of internal
 diaphragm(s) to the sides.
 The lacing procedures for lacing corners and units together shall consist of cutting a length
 of lacing wire approximately 1½ times the distance to be laced, not to exceed 5 ft, securing the
 wire terminal at the corner by looping and twisting, then proceeding to lace with alternating
 single and double loops at approximately 5 in intervals and securely fasten the other wire
 terminal.
 The mattresses shall not be assembled in their final location, except as required for lacing
 adjacent units together. This is to maintain a uniform bedding surface for installation as
 described in Section 601.051.
 At the option of the Contractor, approved locking wire fasteners may be used in lieu of
 lacing wire provided they are used in every mesh opening along the joint, each ring is formed
 such that the ends interlock and the fasteners be of stainless steel construction with a minimum
 thickness of 0.125 in, meeting the requirements of ASTM A213, Type 302.
 601.05 Installation of Gabions The assembled gabion units shall be placed in the proper
 location. All adjoining empty gabions shall be placed along the perimeter of the gabion contact
 surfaces to obtain a monolithic structure.
 Once the gabion units are laced together, they shall be stretched to effective alignment. This
 operation shall be carried out after several empty gabion units have been positioned. The first
 gabion in the line shall be partially filled to provide the necessary anchorage prior to stretching.
 Stretching shall be carried out using a means of stretching of at least 1 ton capacity.
 While under tension, the gabion shall be carefully controlled against any possible unraveling.
 Whenever gabion structures require more than one tier, the upper empty gabion tier, while
 under tension, shall be laced to the top of the lower one.
 601.051 Installation of Mattresses If the mattress is to be placed in the dry, the assembled
 unit shall be placed in the proper location after it is assembled as described in Section 601.04.
 Several empty units shall be laced together along the contact surfaces to obtain a monolithic
 structure. Care shall be taken to maintain a uniform surface on the bedding material.
 
 6-2
 
 If the mattresses are to be placed underwater, they may be laced together, filled in the dry,
 and then placed in final position.
 If the mattresses are polyvinyl chloride coated, they shall not be dragged, but shall be placed
 in a manner so as not to damage the coating.
 601.052 Filter Fabric A filter fabric in accordance with Section 722.02 - Drainage
 Geotextile, shall be placed on the subgrade, backslope, and sides of the excavation. If earthfill is
 to be placed over the gabions, filter fabric shall be placed top of the gabions before earthfill
 placement.
 601.06 Filling Gabions and mattresses shall be filled in strict accordance with the
 manufacturer’s recommendations, one copy of these recommendations will be supplied to the
 Resident. Care shall be taken when placing stones inside gabions and mattresses in an effort to
 prevent distortion and ensure proper alignment.
 Care shall be taken when placing fill material to assure that the sheathing on coated units
 will not be broken or damaged.
 Gabions shall be filled in layers, 1 ft at a time. Two connecting wires shall be placed
 between each layer in all cells along all exposed faces of the gabion structure. All connecting
 wires shall be looped around two mesh openings and the wire terminals shall be securely twisted
 to prevent their loosening.
 The cells in any row shall be filled in stages so that local deformation will be avoided. At no
 time shall any cell be filled to a depth exceeding 1 ft more than the adjoining cell.
 Along all exposed gabion faces, the outer layer of stone shall be carefully placed and packed
 by hand to ensure proper alignment and a neat, compact, square appearance. No sharp edges of
 stone shall protrude through the wire mesh. The last layer of stone shall be leveled with the top
 of the gabion or mattress to allow proper closing of the lid and provide an even surface for the
 next course.
 Gabions and mattresses shall be well packed and full without excessive bulging.
 601.061 Filling of Hand Filled Gabions The assembled gabion units shall be placed in the
 proper location. A form shall then be placed along the front face and any side face not adjacent
 to an already placed gabion, and anchored to formwork on the back face to provide a rigid frame
 rectangle before filling with stone.
 The forms shall be sufficiently braced and tied to prevent distortion while the stones are
 being placed.
 
 6-3
 
 On all exposed gabion faces, the outer layer of stone shall be carefully placed and packed by
 hand to ensure proper alignment and a neat, compact, square appearance. No sharp edges of
 stone shall protrude through the wire mesh.
 Care shall be taken when placing fill material to assure that the sheathing on coated units
 will not be broken or damaged.
 Gabions shall be filled by hand in 1 ft layers. Two connecting wires shall be placed between
 each layer in all cells along all exposed faces of the gabion structure. All connecting wires shall
 be looped around two mesh openings and the wire terminals shall be securely twisted to prevent
 their loosening.
 The cells in any row shall be filled in stages so that local deformation will be avoided. At no
 time shall any cell be filled to a depth exceeding 1 ft more than the adjoining cell.
 The last layer of stone shall be leveled with the top of the gabion or mattress to allow proper
 closing of the lid and provide an even surface for the next course.
 At no time will any stones be placed by machine.
 Complete gabions shall have a maximum deviation from the designated shape of 1 inch in 3
 ft. Gabions not meeting this tolerance will be emptied, adjustments made, and refilled.
 601.07 Lid Closing The lids shall be stretched tightly over the filling, using crowbars or lid
 closing tools, until the lid meets the perimeter edges of the front and end panels. The lid shall
 then be tightly laced along all edges, ends, and diaphragms in the same manner as described
 above for assembly.
 601.08 Cutting and Folding Mesh Where shown on the drawings or when otherwise
 directed, the mesh shall be cut, folded, and wired together to suit existing site conditions. The
 mesh must be cleanly cut and the surplus mesh cut out completely or folded back and neatly
 wired to an adjacent face. The cut edges of the mesh shall be securely laced together with lacing
 wire in the manner as described above for assembling.
 601.09 Method of Measurement Gabions and mattresses will be measured for payment by
 the cubic yard to the neat line dimensions shown on the plans.
 601.10 Basis of Payment Payment for gabions and mattresses will be made at the contract
 unit price per cubic yard in place. Payment will be full compensation for excavating to place
 gabions and backfill material, for preparing and fine grading the foundations area, for furnishing

 open drainage system, a run of culvert shall be considered from inlet to outlet.
 Option III polyvinylchloride (PVC) pipe shall only be used in closed drainage systems,
 between catch basins.
 603.0311 Corrugated Polyethylene and Polypropylene Pipe for Option III If inspection by
 the Resident reveals an unsatisfactory installation, the Resident may direct the contractor to test
 installed Smooth Lined Corrugated Polyethylene and Polypropylene Pipe for Option III to ensure
 
 6-6
 
 the vertical deflection does not exceed the maximum allowable deflection. Maximum allowable
 deflection shall be 5 percent of the sum of the nominal inside diameter minus a 1.5 percent
 undersize tolerance.
 Deflection tests shall not be performed until at least 30 days after completion of installation
 and compaction of backfill. The pipe shall be cleaned and inspected for offsets and obstructions
 before testing.
 For all pipes 24 inches and smaller, a mandrel shall be pulled through the pipe by hand to
 ensure the maximum allowable deflections have not been exceeded. The mandrel shall be
 certified by the Department prior to use. If the mandrel fails to pass through the pipe, the pipe
 will be deemed overdeflected.
 For pipes greater than 24 inches, deflections shall be determined by a method submitted and
 approved by the Department. If a mandrel is selected, the minimum diameter and length and
 other requirements shall conform to the dimensions and requirements stated below. If other
 methods are used the measurements shall meet the minimum mandrel diameter requirements.
 Any overdeflected pipe shall be uncovered and if not damaged as determined by the
 Department shall be allowed for reinstallation. Damaged pipe shall not be reinstalled and shall
 be removed from the work site.
 The mandrel shall be a rigid non-adjustable, odd numbered-leg (9 legs minimum) mandrel

 including mandrel and deflection testing, reinstallation of pipe and delays shall be the
 
 6-7
 
 responsibility of the Contractor. When deflection testing reveals satisfactory pipe, all costs for
 deflection testing will be paid for by the Department.
 603.032 Excavation Trenches shall be excavated in accordance with the requirements of
 Section 206 - Structural Excavation and wide enough to allow joining the culvert and
 compacting the bedding and backfill material under and around the culvert. Unless otherwise
 designated, trench walls shall be as nearly vertical as possible and the trench width no greater
 than necessary for installation of the culvert.
 603.04 Bedding Culverts, less than 42 inches in diameter, shall be bedded on a firm
 foundation of uniform density. After placing the culvert pipe, backfill material shall be placed
 along the bottom of the trench, thoroughly tamped against the lower portion of the pipe with
 special care taken not to move the bedded pipe.
 For culverts 42 inches in diameter and larger, the bottom of the trench shall be compacted to
 uniform density and shaped to fit a template with reasonable closeness for at least 10 percent of

 Flexible culvert section and metal end sections shall be firmly jointed by coupling bands.
 These bands shall meet the same applicable requirements as the flexible culvert being joined.
 603.07 Shop Strutting All flexible circular culvert pipe 48 inches in diameter and larger
 shall be elongated along the vertical diameter in accordance with one of the following two
 methods:
 a) The pipe shall be elongated by the manufacturer after fabrication by increasing the
 diameter along the vertical axis approximately 3 percent with a corresponding decrease
 along the horizontal axis. The elongation shall be obtained by installing rods and tightening
 the rods, uniformly from end to end of the pipe, obtaining approximately one quarter of the
 required elongation each time throughout the length of the pipe.
 The rods shall be ⅝ inch diameter threaded 7 inches at both ends with washers and nuts.
 The length of the rods shall be the diameter of the pipe plus 8 inches. The rods shall be
 placed on the horizontal axis of the pipe at 2 foot spacing and located halfway between the
 circumferential riveting. A block of soft wood 2 inches by 4 inches by 12 inches long, shall
 be placed over the rods at each end to provide contact against the outside of the pipe. The
 long dimension of the blocks shall be parallel with the horizontal axis of the pipe. The rods
 shall be left in the pipe until the fill is completed and compacted, unless for some unusual
 condition their removal is ordered. The rods shall be removed by cutting from the inside
 adjacent to the pipe.
 (b) The pipe shall be elongated by the manufacturer by increasing the diameter along the
 vertical axis approximately 5 percent with a corresponding decrease along the horizontal
 axis by applying sufficient pressure to the sides of the pipe after fabrication to produce the
 specified distortion. The elongation shall be maintained by drilling holes in the ends of the
 pipe sections and placing and tightening horizontal wires. After the pipe sections have been
 installed with coupling bands, the wires shall be removed.
 Helically corrugated culvert sections shall be match marked before being elongated by the
 manufacturer or before the ⅝ inch diameter rods are installed.
 603.08 Backfilling Culverts and Storm Drains After the pipe is installed, it will be
 inspected before any backfill material is placed. All pipe found to be out of alignment, unduly
 settled or damaged to the extent that full performance is impaired, shall be taken up and re-laid
 or replaced.
 Trenches shall be backfilled in accordance with Section 206.03 and as follows. The
 backfill material shall be thoroughly rammed under the haunches of the pipe with power or
 pneumatic operated hand tampers. The remainder of the backfill shall be thoroughly
 compacted with power tampers or vibratory compactors or other approved equipment or
 combination of equipment.
 
 6-9
 
 When the top of the pipe is exposed above the top of the trench, the embankment material
 around the pipe shall be placed and compacted on each side of the pipe in the aforementioned
 manner described for backfilling trenches, for a width of 5 feet measured from the outside
 diameter of the pipe. Only that portion of the embankment on each side and top of the pipe,
 for a minimum distance of 15 inches measured from the outside diameter of the pipe, must be
 of material conforming to the requirements described for backfilling in Section 206.03.
 Backfill material beyond these limits may contain stones larger than 3 inches but no greater
 than the thickness of the layer being placed. The embankment construction around the pipe
 shall continue up to an elevation 15 inches above the top of the pipe. Beyond these limits, the
 embankment shall be placed and compacted in accordance with the embankment construction
 requirements specified for the work except where the induced trench method is called for on
 the plans.
 When construction equipment is used or traffic is maintained the Contractor shall provide a
 minimum cover of 3 feet over all pipes, if possible. Whenever this cover extends above the
 subgrade the Contractor shall temporarily place earth, which shall be removed when necessary
 to complete the work in accordance with the plans, or as directed. Any deviation from this
 practice shall have prior approval.
 603.09 Induced Trench Under this method, for designated rigid pipes only, the embankment
 shall be completed as specified above, to a height above the culvert equal to the vertical outside
 diameter of the pipe plus 1 foot. A trench, equal in width to the outside horizontal diameter of
 the pipe, shall then be excavated to within 1 foot of the top of the pipe. Trench walls shall be as
 nearly vertical as possible. Hay bales shall be used to fill the lower 1/4 to 1/3 of the trench.
 Construction of the embankment above shall then proceed in a normal manner. The trench shall
 be loosely filled with highly compressible soil.
 603.10 Removing and Relaying Culverts The pipe shall be carefully removed from its
 existing location, transported to and installed in the new location in accordance with these
 specifications for the particular type of pipe involved. Pipe damaged by the Contractor shall be
 replaced with pipe of similar type by the Contractor without additional compensation.
 New metal bands or joint material shall be supplied and installed when necessary.
 603.11 Method of Measurement Culvert and storm drain pipe of the different types and
 sizes, both new and re-laid, will be measured by the length in linear feet along the invert, laid as
 directed, complete in place, and accepted. Pipe laid in excess of the authorized length will not
 be included.
 When the ends of a pipe are sloped or skewed, the amount to be included for payment shall
 be the length along the invert of the pipe.
 When elbows, tees, wyes, or other special fittings are required, each fitting shall be included
 for payment as 3 additional linear feet of the largest pipeline involved.

 603.12 Basis of Payment The accepted quantities of pipe for culverts and storm drains will
 be paid for at the contract unit price per linear foot, for the types and sizes specified, complete in
 place.
 No payment will be made for pipe ordered without written approval of the Resident when
 such pipe is not required to be installed for completion of the work.
 Excavation for culverts and storm drains, including excavation below the pipe, for induced
 trench and for bedding and backfilling will be considered incidental, except as provided in
 Section 206 - Structural Excavation.
 Whenever minimum cover material extends above the subgrade, removal of the cover
 material necessary to complete the work will not be paid for directly but shall be considered part
 of the work specified herein.
 Coupling bands and joint material will not be paid for separately but shall be considered
 included in the unit bid price for the type of pipe being used or re-laid.
 Existing culverts to be re-laid, salvaged, or wasted shall be removed and disposed of as
 directed. The excavation for removal of these culverts that is not paid for under other items or
 incidental to other items shall be paid for as Common Excavation.
 Inlet grate units will be paid for at the contract unit price each for the size specified,
 complete in place.
 The accepted quantity of concrete pipe ties will be paid for at the contract unit price per

 additional subbase material and compacted to the specified density. In stabilization
 applications, the use of vibratory compaction equipment is not recommended with the initial
 lift of subbase as it may cause damage to the geotextile.
 When fabric is to be used as a reinforcement geotextile, care shall be taken to tension the
 fabric before completely covering with aggregate. Cover material shall be placed starting on
 one edge of the fabric and progress toward the opposite edge, in order to maintain tension in
 the fabric.
 When sloped riprap is to be placed on fabric, the site shall be prepared to provide an
 undulating and uneven surface, as much as is practical. The fabric shall be placed loosely to
 prevent any bridging of the uneven surface. Fabric to be placed on slopes shall have the long
 direction oriented up and down the slope as shown on the Standard Detail.
 The armor system placement shall begin at the toe and proceed up the slope. Placement
 shall take place so as to avoid stretching and subsequent tearing of the geotextile. Riprap
 and heavy stone fill shall not be dropped from a height of more than 1 foot. Stone with a
 mass of more than 220 pounds shall not be allowed to roll down the slope. Slope protection
 and smaller sizes of stone filling shall not be dropped from a height exceeding 3 feet, or a
 demonstration provided showing that the placement procedures will not damage the
 geotextile. Following placement of the armor stone, grading of the slope shall not be
 permitted if the grading results in movement of the stone directly above the geotextile.
 For Separation Geotextile, when the fabric is to be placed in the roadway, the cover
 material shall be dumped on previously placed cover material or at the edges of the fabric
 and then pushed onto the fabric. The first layer of cover material shall be greater than 8
 inches and first compacted by a track bulldozer. At no time shall construction equipment be
 allowed on the fabric when the fabric is covered with less than 8 inches of compacted cover
 material. Ruts shall be filled with additional cover material to maintain the minimum 8 inch
 cover over the fabric. When fabric is placed in the roadway, the fabric roll widths shall be
 chosen so that there will be a minimum number of overlaps of parallel rolls. The total width
 of surface covered is shown on the Standard Details
 
 6-59
 
 B. Drainage Geotextile Trench excavation shall be done in accordance with details of
 the project plans. In all instances excavation shall be done in such a way as to prevent large
 voids from occurring in the sides and bottom of the trench. The graded surface shall be
 smooth and free of debris. The fabric shall be placed loosely with no wrinkles or folds and
 with no void spaces between the geotextile and the ground surface.
 Placement of the drainage aggregate should proceed immediately following placement of
 the geotextile. The geotextile shall be covered with a minimum of 1 foot of loosely placed
 aggregate prior to compaction. If a perforated collector pipe is to be installed in the trench, a
 bedding layer of drainage aggregate should be placed below the pipe, with the remainder of
 the aggregate placed to the minimum required construction depth. The aggregate should be
 compacted with vibratory equipment to a minimum of 95% Standard AASHTO density
 unless the trench is required for structural support. If higher compactive effort is required, a
 Class 1 geotextile as described in Section 722 - Geotextiles is needed.
 C. Erosion Control Geotextile The geotextile shall be placed in intimate contact with the
 soils without wrinkles or folds and anchored on a smooth graded surface approved by the
 Resident. The geotextile shall be placed in such a manner that placement of the overlying
 materials will not excessively stretch the geotextile, tearing it.
 Anchoring of the terminal ends of the geotextile shall be accomplished using key
 trenches or aprons at the crest and toe of slope. The geotextile shall be placed with the
 machine direction parallel to the direction of water flow which is normally parallel to the
 slope of erosion control runoff and wave action and parallel to the stream or channel in the
 case of stream bank and channel protection. When riprap or stone ditch protection is placed
 on fabric, the stones shall be placed so that they do not puncture or otherwise damage the
 fabric.
 When sloped riprap is to be placed on fabric, the site shall be prepared to provide an
 undulating and uneven surface, as much as is practical. The fabric shall be placed loosely to
 prevent any bridging of the uneven surface. Fabric to be placed on slopes shall have the long
 direction oriented up and down the slope as shown in the Standard Details.
 The armor system placement shall begin at the toe and proceed up the slope. Placement
 shall take place so as to avoid stretching and subsequent tearing of the geotextile. Riprap
 and heavy stone fill shall not be dropped from a height of more than 1 foot. Stone with a
 mass of more than 220 pounds shall not be allowed to roll down the slope. Slope protection
 and smaller sizes of stone filling shall not be dropped from a height exceeding 3 feet, or a
 demonstration provided showing that the placement procedures will not damage the
 geotextile. Following placement of the armor stone, grading of the slope shall not be
 permitted if the grading results in movement of the stone directly above the geotextile.
 In underwater applications, the geotextile and backfill material shall be placed the same day.
 All void spaces in the armor stone shall be backfilled with small stone to ensure full coverage.
 
 6-60
 
 620.04 Overlap Adjacent lengths of fabric shall be joined by overlapping a minimum of 18
 inches at the ends and sides except when sewing is specified or fabric is placed on slopes. All
 overlaps on slopes shall be placed as follows:
 A. For slopes steeper than 3H:1V - Sewn seams or minimum 3 foot overlaps with no
 pinning or staking allowed.
 B. For slopes flatter than 3H:1V - Sewn seams or minimum 18 inch overlaps and pins or
 stakes may be used to anchor the overlaps per the manufacturer’s recommended spacing.
 C. Overlaps shall be in the direction of flow.
 When fabric is placed in the roadway, the fabric roll widths shall be chosen so that there will
 be a minimum number of overlaps of parallel rolls. The total width of surface covered is shown
 on the Standard Details.
 A. Stabilization/Reinforcement and Separation Geotextile Adjacent geotextile rolls shall
 be overlapped shingle style, sewn, or joined as required in the plans. Overlaps shall be in the
 direction shown on the plans. On curves the geotextile may be folded or cut to conform to
 the curves. The fold or overlap shall be in the direction of construction and held in place by
 pins, staples, or piles of fill or rock. The following Table summarizes the minimum overlap
 for geotextiles in this application:
 AASHTO Classification
 Minimum Overlap
 A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4
 18 inches
 A-5, A-6, A-7
 3 feet or sewna
 All roll ends
 3 feet or sewna
 a
 Seams shall be sewn when the soils have a CBR equal to
 or less than 1, unless otherwise specified.
 B. Drainage Geotextile Successive sheets of geotextiles shall be overlapped a minimum
 of 1 foot, with the upstream sheet overlapping the downstream sheet. In trenches equal to or
 greater than 1 foot in width, after placing the drainage aggregate the geotextile shall be
 folded over the top of the backfill material in a manner to produce a minimum overlap of 1
 foot. In trenches of less than 1 foot but greater than 4 inches wide, the overlap shall be equal
 to the width of the trench. Where the trench is less than 4 inches, the geotextile overlap shall
 be sewn or otherwise bonded. All seams shall be subject to the approval of the Resident.
 C. Erosion Control Geotextile Adjacent geotextile sheets shall be joined by either
 sewing or overlapping shingle style. Overlapped seams of roll ends shall be a minimum of
 18 inches except where placed under water. In such instances the overlap shall be a
 minimum of 3 feet. Overlaps of adjacent rolls shall be a minimum of 18 inches in all
 instances. When overlapping, successive sheets of the geotextile shall be overlapped
 
 6-61
 
 upstream over downstream, and/or upslope over downslope. In cases where wave action or
 multidirectional flow is anticipated, all seams perpendicular to the direction of flow shall be
 sewn. For Erosion Control applications, the thread shall also be resistant to ultraviolet
 radiation.
 620.05 Seams When sewn seams are to be used, field or factory seaming by machine will be
 allowed. If a sewn seam is to be used for the seaming of the geotextile, the thread used shall
 consist of high strength polyethylene or polyester and shall have the same or greater durability as
 the geosynthetic being seamed. Nylon thread shall not be used. The thread shall be adjusted in
 the field to be sufficiently tight but not cut the geotextile. For Erosion Control applications, the
 thread shall also be resistant to ultraviolet radiation. The thread shall be of contrasting color to
 that of the geotextile itself. Flat/prayer seams or J-/Double J-type seams shall be used with
 double-locked stitches (Class 40l), except the "flat" seam may be used for repair of damaged inplace fabric. A stitch density of 70 to 140 per foot shall be used for lighter-weight geotextiles
 while heavier geotextiles shall have 50 to 70 per foot. All field seams shall be double stitched
 with two parallel passes and the 2 rows of stitching shall be approximately ½ in apart and shall
 not cross at any point. All stitching shall be at least 1 inch from the fabric edge.
 For seams that are sewn in the field, the Contractor shall provide at least a 6.5 foot length of
 sewn seam for sampling by the Resident before the geotextile is installed. For seams that are
 sewn in the factory, the Resident shall obtain samples of the factory seams at random from any
 roll of geotextile that is used on the project. For seams that are field sewn, the seams sewn for
 sampling shall be sewn using the same equipment and procedures as will be used for the
 production seams. If seams are sewn in both the machine and cross machine direction, samples
 of seams from both directions shall be provided.
 When sewn seams are required, the seam strength, as measured in accordance with ASTM D
 4632, shall be equal to or greater than 90 percent of the specified grab strength. The Contractor
 shall submit the seam assembly description along with the sample of the seam. The description
 shall include the seam type, stitch type, sewing thread, and stitch density. To facilitate
 inspection all seams shall be placed with the seam up so that repairs can easily be made if faulty
 seams are encountered during inspection, as shown on the Standard Detail. Procedures for
 testing sewn seams are given in ASTM D 4884 - Standard Test Method for Seam Strength of
 Sewn Geotextiles.
 620.06 Certification The Contractor shall provide to the Resident a certificate stating the
 name of the manufacturer, product name, style number, chemical composition of the filaments
 or yarns and other pertinent information to fully describe the geotextile. This information shall
 be furnished to the Resident for approval of the fabric before installation. The Manufacturer is
 responsible for establishing and maintaining a quality control program to assure compliance
 with the requirements of Section 722 - Geotextiles. Documentation describing the quality
 control program shall be made available upon request. The Manufacturer’s certificate shall state
 that the furnished geotextile meets Minimum Average Roll Value (MARV) requirements of the
 specification as evaluated under the Manufacturer’s quality control program. A person having
 
 6-62
 
 legal authority to bind the Manufacturer shall attest to the certificate. Either mislabeling or
 misrepresentation of materials shall be reason to reject those geotextile products.
 620.07 Sampling and Acceptance Geotextiles shall be subject to sampling and testing to
 verify conformance with this specification. Sampling for testing shall be in accordance with the
 most current ASTM D 4354, using the section titled, “Procedure for Sampling for Purchaser’s
 Specification Conformance Testing.” In the absence of purchaser’s testing, verification may be
 based on manufacturer’s certifications as a result of testing by the manufacturer of quality
 assurance samples obtained using the procedure for Sampling for Manufacturer’s Quality
 Assurance (MQA) Testing. A lot size for conformance or quality assurance sampling shall be
 considered the shipment quantity of the given product or a truckload of the given product,
 whichever is smaller.
 Testing shall be performed in accordance with the methods referenced in Section 722 Geotextiles for the indicated application. The number of specimens to test per sample is
 specified by each test method. Geotextile product acceptance shall be based on ASTM D 4759.
 Product acceptance is determined by comparing the average test results of all specimens within a
 given sample to the specification MARV. Refer to ASTM D 4759 for more details regarding
 geotextile acceptance procedures.
 620.08 Shipment, Storage, Protection, and Repair of Fabric Geotextile labeling, shipment
 and storage shall follow ASTM D 4873. Product labels shall clearly show the manufacturer or
 supplier name, style number, and roll number. Each shipping document shall include a notation
 certifying that the material is in accordance with the manufacturer’s certificate. Each geotextile
 roll shall be wrapped with a material that will protect the geotextile from damage due to
 shipment, water, sunlight and contaminants. The protective wrapping shall be maintained
 during periods of shipment and storage. During storage, geotextile rolls shall be elevated off the
 ground and adequately covered to protect them from the following: site construction damage,
 precipitation, extended ultraviolet radiation including sunlight, chemicals that are strong acids or
 strong bases, flames including welding sparks, temperatures in excess of 160°F, and any other
 environmental condition that may damage the physical property values of the geotextile.
 To prevent damaging the fabric, the Contractor shall exercise necessary care while
 transporting, storing, and installing the fabric. Atmospheric exposure of geotextiles to the
 elements following laydown shall be a maximum of 5 days to minimize damage potential. At
 no time shall riprap stones be rolled down the slope where fabric has been placed.
 Before installation, the fabric shall be protected from rain, from sunlight or other ultraviolet
 exposure and from dust, mud, debris, or other elements that may affect its performance. Fabric
 that is torn, punctured, or otherwise damaged shall not be placed. During installation, direct
 weather exposure of the fabric shall be limited to a maximum of 5 days, from laydown to
 covering of the fabric.
 A. Stabilization/Reinforcement Geotextile Before covering, the geotextile shall be
 inspected by the Resident to ensure that the geotextile has not been damaged during
 
 6-63
 
 installation. Damaged geotextiles, as identified by the Resident, shall be repaired
 immediately. Cover the damaged area with a geotextile patch that extends an amount equal
 to the required overlap beyond the damaged area. If placement of the backfill material
 causes damage to the geotextile, the damaged area shall be repaired as previously described.
 The placement procedure shall then be modified to eliminate further damage from taking
 place.
 B. Drainage Geotextile Should the geotextile be damaged during installation or drainage
 aggregate placement, a geotextile patch shall be placed extending beyond the damaged area
 by a distance of 18 inches, or the specified seam overlap, whichever is greater.
 C. Erosion Control Geotextile The geotextile shall be placed in such a manner that
 placement of the overlying materials will not excessively stretch the geotextile, tearing it.
 Care shall be taken during installation so as to avoid damage occurring to the geotextile as a
 result of the installation process. Should the geotextile be damaged during installation, a
 geotextile patch shall be placed over the damaged area extending 3 feet beyond the perimeter
 of the damage. When riprap or stone ditch protection is placed on fabric, the stones shall be
 placed so that they do not puncture or otherwise damage the fabric. Field monitoring shall
 be performed to verify that the armor system placement does not damage the geotextile.
 Any geotextile damaged during backfill placement shall be replaced as directed by the
 Resident at the Contractor’s expense.
 620.09 Method of Measurement The quantity of geotextile will be measured by the number
 of square yards of surface area covered and in direct contact with the cover material.
 Measurement will not be made for overlaps, patches and repairs of damaged geotextile unless
 additional overlap width is required by the Resident in which case measurement will be made
 for that added overlap area.
 620.10 Basis of Payment Geotextiles will be paid for at the contract unit price per square
 yard. Such payment shall be full compensation for furnishing and placing geotextile fabric; for
 all required surface preparation; for all labor, tools, materials and equipment; for repairing torn
 and damaged geotextile; and when required, for sewing seams and for furnishing and placing all
 pins or stakes or other hold down devices; for excavation for and furnishing and placing
 protective aggregate cushion; and for all other incidentals necessary to complete the work.

 SECTION 621 - LANDSCAPING
 621.0001 Description This work shall consist of the Contractor furnishing and planting
 trees, shrubs, vines, and other plants and shall include all planting operations and material as
 well as the care and replacement of the plants during the Maintenance Period, all in accordance
 with the specifications, Standard Details, planting plans and schedules and the directions of the
 Resident. Planting operations will be divided into two classes.
 a. Class A Planting will consist of planting into the existing soil that has been amended
 with organic humus, peatmoss, compost, and/or other standard horticultural soil
 amendments as approved by the Resident.
 b. Class B Planting will consists of planting into the existing soil without amendments.
 Unless otherwise specified, all planting shall be Class A.
 621.0002 Materials - General All non-plant material shall conform to the requirements
 specified in the following Sections of Division 700 - Materials.
 Fertilizer
 Mulch
 Organic Humus
 
 717.01
 717.04
 717.09
 
 Water shall be free from oil, acids, alkalines, salts, or any other substances harmful to
 plantings.
 621.0003 Plant Material-All Classes
 a. All plants shall conform to the current edition of the "American Standard for Nursery
 Stock" (ANSI Z60.1) unless otherwise indicated in the plans or specifications.
 b. All plants shall be first class representatives of their normal species or varieties,
 unless otherwise specified. All plants must have a good, healthy, well-formed upper growth
 and a large, fibrous, compact root system. Plants sheared into stiff or formal shapes will be
 rejected unless they have outgrown such shearing.
 Large-growing, deciduous trees shall have straight trunks and a single leader or as may
 be characteristic of the species. Tops shall be thickly branched, densely foliated, well
 balanced and in good proportion to the height of the tree. Trees with weak trunks, thinly or
 irregularly branched or with unnatural shape of proportions due to undesirable pruning or for
 
 6-65
 
 any other cause will be rejected. Trees with leaders or branches too severely cut back or
 with bottom limbs trimmed too high will be rejected.
 Small-growing deciduous trees shall be thickly branched with a well-balanced, natural
 shape. Plants which are poorly furnished or have grown or been pruned into unnatural
 shapes will be rejected.
 Tree "Clumps" shall have three or more main stems starting from the ground.
 c. All plants shall have been grown under climatic conditions similar to those in the
 locality of the site of the project under construction or have been acclimated to such
 conditions for at least two years. All plants must have been grown in a latitude north of
 Washington, D.C. The Resident may require a sworn affidavit from the contractor stating
 the source where all plants were grown. Payment for plants may be withheld until this
 affidavit is received.
 All plants shall be nursery grown unless otherwise stipulated. No plant will be
 considered nursery grown unless it has been transplanted at least once and has been growing
 in a nursery for at least 2 years. Where collected stock is allowed, all plants in addition to
 meeting all other requirements for nursery-grown stock, shall have a diameter of ball or root
 spread at least one-third greater than that required for nursery stock. Plants showing signs of
 lack of root pruning, cultivation or other proper nursery care will be classified as collected
 stock regardless of their source.
 d. All plants must be healthy and vigorous; free from disease, injurious insects and their
 eggs or larva, mechanical wounds, broken branches, decay, or any other defects.
 e. All plants shall be true to name. Each bundle or each plant when not tied in bundles
 shall be labeled legibly and securely. The current edition of "Standardized Plant Names"
 prepared by the Editorial Committee of the American Joint Committee on Horticultural
 Nomenclature shall be the authority for all plant names.
 Care shall be taken throughout the operation to keep each plant species or variety
 segregated and labeled. The Resident will reject any plants concerning any doubt or
 confusion arising about nomenclature, either at the time of delivery or at any subsequent
 time.
 f. The Contractor shall take all precautions that are customary in good trade practice to
 insure upon arrival at the planting site the plants are in good condition for successful growth.
 All plants must show appearance of normal health and vigor. Plants with loose or broken
 balls; dried out roots, twigs or needles; or plants which have become overheated in transit or
 are found not to comply with these specifications in any way will be rejected. The Resident
 will not assume responsibility for such rejected material.
 
 6-66
 
 The Resident reserves the right to plainly mark all rejected plants with paint or by other
 means to ensure that they are not used on the job. Rejected plants may not be used on the
 project, will not be paid for, and must be replaced by the contractor with approved plants. If
 plants with communicable diseases are not removed or destroyed immediately, upon
 discovery of the disease, all plants that were left in contact will also be rejected.
 621.0004 Plant Size and Root Balls
 Class A Plants The plant sizes specified in the "American Standards for Nursery Stock"
 are the minimum sizes acceptable. (ANSI Z60.1) Plants, which meet the sizes specified but
 do not have a normal shape and balance between height and spread, will be rejected. Thin,
 poorly branched, or sparsely rooted plants will be rejected, regardless of whether they meet
 the minimum technical requirements of the American Standard for Nursery Stock .
 Where bare roots are irregular, the size of the root spread will be the average root spread
 considering all sides of the plant and not the maximum root spread. The Resident may allow
 moderate deviations from exact sizes of plants that normally have irregular root systems.
 Coarse-rooted plants, which lack sufficient fibrous feeding roots, will be rejected.
 Recently cut stubs of large roots on either balled or bare root stock will be considered
 evidence of lack of proper nursery care and root-pruning and will be sufficient grounds for
 rejecting such plants or classifying them as collected stock. Acceptable roots will retain
 sufficient fibrous feeding roots.
 Where a size range with a maximum and minimum is given, an average size is required.
 At least 40 percent of the plants in a size range shall be at or above the average for this size
 range.
 A solid ball is referred to as one encompassing the roots of a plant. A solid ball shall
 consist of the soil in which the plant was originally grown. The ball shall have been dug up
 in such a manner as not to disturb the roots. Where such a ball is required the designation B
 and B, Balled and Burlapped, will be used. No B and B stock will be accepted if this solid
 soil ball has disintegrated or if loose soil apparently has been packed around the roots.
 Peat Balls and other fiber material will not be acceptable where B and B stock is called
 for, but said root balls may be furnished where bare root stock is called for if approved by
 the Resident.
 Per ASNS Standards, the caliper of trees shall be the diameter of the trunk taken 6 inches
 above the root collar for up to and including four-inch caliper size . If the caliper at 6 inches
 exceeds 4 inches in diameter, the caliper will be measured at 12 inches above the ground.
 
 Class B Plants Unless otherwise specified, plants used in Class B plantings shall be
 seedlings, plugs or lining out stock with heavy, fibrous, compact root systems. The
 
 6-67
 
 comparative size of the plants shall be as stated under the heading "Seedling Trees and
 Shrubs" in the "American Standard for Nursery Stock". All conifers must have dormant
 buds and secondary needles. Where B and B plants are designated, ball sizes shall be the
 same as Class A plants.
 621.0006 Inspection A preliminary check of the plants may be made at the time of delivery
 for condition of the plants and conformity to the specifications. The Contractor shall inform the
 Resident at least 48 hours in advance, as to what plants are to be planted and in what location.
 Inspection will continue throughout the life of the contract up to the time of Final Acceptance.
 Plants which are not true to name, do not conform to the specifications, show evidence of
 improper handling or lack of proper care or which appear to be in a seriously unhealthy
 condition must be removed by the Contractor at once and replaced by acceptable plants as soon
 as the planting season allows. Any unacceptable plants when pointed out to the Contractor by
 the Resident shall be removed at once. If this occurs during the planting season, these plants
 shall be replaced at once; if between planting seasons, they shall be replaced at the next
 subsequent planting season, unless conditionally directed by the Resident for evergreens and
 other preferred spring planted items.
 621.0017 General Construction Requirements Planting operations shall be performed in
 accordance with the plans and specifications and as directed by the Resident.
 621.0018 Layout The location of plants as shown on the plans shall be considered
 approximate only. The exact locations will be designated on the ground by the Resident,
 making such changes as may be required to adjust the planting to local conditions. Plant
 quantities may, in some cases, be increased or decreased as provided in Section 109.1 - Changes
 in Quantities. Locations for trees and shrubs shall be staked out on the ground by the Resident
 before herbicides are applied and any plant pits or beds are dug.
 The Contractor shall furnish the stakes for use in marking plant locations. Stakes shall be
 wire survey flags at least 21 inches tall. Layout stakes shall be approved by the Resident before
 the Contractor commences any work on the project.
 The Contractor shall mark the stakes legibly with indelible marking material and may also
 be required to furnish personnel, capable of locating plants from plans, to carry out the staking
 under the direction of the Resident.
 Before actively starting work on the project, the Contractor shall provide the Resident with a
 planting sequence schedule to be used in establishing priorities in staking plant locations. The
 Contractor shall give the Resident at least four days advance notice of any deviations from this
 schedule. The Resident will not be responsible for any delay or inconvenience caused by
 unfinished staking resulting from the Contractors failure to follow the above procedure.
 All stakes used to locate plants shall be replaced in the correct plant pits after each operation
 and shall remain there until the Resident directs their removal. When plants are set out in wrong
 locations due to stakes being misplaced during digging and planting operations, the Contractor
 
 6-68
 
 shall be required to move the misplaced plants to the proper location at their own risk and
 expense.
 621.0019 Plant Pits and Beds
 a. Plant Beds Areas designated as plant beds must have the entire surface cultivated,
 cleared of weeds and be completely covered with mulch. Actual mulch limit will extend 2½
 feet out from the center of plant or to the pavement edge, bridge wall, and roadside face of
 guardrail. Cultivation must include complete removal of all weed and grass roots, loose
 stones over 3 inches maximum diameter and any other debris. Approved herbicides are
 permitted for weed control in place of sod removal.
 b. Rock Excavation When ledge or boulders over ¼ yd³ in size are encountered in
 digging plant pits, the Contractor shall notify the Resident who will change the location of
 the plants. No excavation of ledge or boulders over ¼ yd³ in volume will be required and no
 extra payment will be made for rock excavation or for shifting of plant holes due to rock.
 c. Class A Planting Size of plant pits shall bear the following relationship to the spread
 of roots or root ball diameter of the plants to be planted in them:
 For all plant materials, the holes shall be 2 times the diameter of the ball or container
 size.
 The plant pit shall be deep enough so that when installed the top of the root ball is even
 with to ½ inch higher than the existing ground. In all cases, the depth shall be sufficient to
 contain all the roots of the plant without crowding.
 In certain areas of poor drainage or heavy soil, the Resident may require raising the plant
 elevation. When required, the raising of the plants shall be included as a part of the cost of
 the plant.
 Excavated soil mixed with organic humus shall be used as backfill around the roots.
 Stones larger than 2 inches in maximum diameter, large roots, roots or rhizomes of weeds
 or other injurious materials shall be removed and not used as backfill. Any additional
 material needed to fill plant pits to the level of the surrounding ground shall be loam
 (Section 615) furnished by the Contractor at their own expense.
 d. Class B Planting Class B plants will be planted in the existing soil. Plant holes must
 be deep enough to allow room, for the full depth of the root without doubling or folding and
 wide enough to allow room for its normal spread. Plants must be set straight and at the same
 depth at which they were previously growing. Soil must be firmly compacted about the
 roots leaving no air pockets.
 621.0020 Planting Seasons Seasons for planting, unless otherwise directed, shall be within
 the following dates:

 Plants will not be planted in frozen soil, soil that is excessively wet, or excessively dry.
 Preparations for planting may begin earlier than the specified season and planting work may
 continue beyond the specified time limits if approved by the Resident. However, the Resident
 may require that all plants planted out-of-season shall receive special attention as directed. Any
 out-of-season planting shall be at the Contractor's risk and expense.
 621.0023 Setting Plants
 a. Placement Plants shall be set plumb and straight in the prepared pits and beds and at a
 level such as will result, after settlement, in the top of the root ball being level with or to
 within 1 inch above the surrounding ground surface.
 b. Staking If the Resident or Landscape Architect determines a tree requires staking, the
 Landscape Contractor will provide staking incidental to the cost of the plant. Tree
 staking shall be done in accordance with horticultural industry standards; trees shall be
 staked to allow slight sway and movement all the way to the ground. Stakes shall not
 extend into tree branches. Stakes shall be driven into undisturbed soil and not permitted
 to penetrate root balls.
 Staked trees shall remain in a plumb position throughout the Maintenance Period.
 Staking materials shall be removed after one growing season or if longer time is needed
 at the end of the Maintenance Period.
 621.0024 Backfill Class A For all Class A plants backfill shall consist of 3 parts of soil
 excavated from the plant pit thoroughly mixed with one part of organic humus and/or
 horticultural amendments as approved by the Resident . Sods or clods may not be used as backfill.
 The backfill material shall be placed and compacted in the bottom of the planting pit and shall
 be worked around the roots and thoroughly compacted as the backfilling proceeds, leaving no air
 
 6-70
 
 pockets. The backfill shall be filled in around the root ball to half the depth of the ball, and the
 remaining wire basket shall be removed and the remaining burlap around the ball shall be
 loosened and spread out away from the plant or if it is too bulky, cut away and removed. The
 backfilling shall then be completed, watered and tamped firm. Plastic film wraps shall be
 completely removed during planting. Nursery containers shall be completely removed before
 planting. The roots of bare root plant materials shall be placed in their natural arrangement with
 the backfilling carefully performed to prevent damage to the plant's root system. Broken or
 bruised roots shall be pruned immediately, making a clean cut. Shallow basins or saucers of
 earth will be required to be placed around each plant. However, when drainage conditions are
 poor, as in heavy clay soil, the Resident may require that such saucers be omitted or used only
 temporarily. All plants shall be thoroughly watered and liquid fed the day they are planted and
 as often thereafter as necessary for the plants to become safely established.

 cultivation, pruning, mulching, spraying as needed, repair and restoration of damage caused by
 
 6-73
 
 the Contractor, etc. The Contractor shall provide sufficient labor and supervisory personnel to
 carry out this work without undue delay. Any delay in carrying out this phase of the work
 which, results either in danger to the health or growth of the plants or a poor appearance of the
 project from the point of view of the public will be considered due cause for withholding all or
 part of any payment due the Contractor for plants delivered and planted or for any other work
 done.
 Partial payments on the contract do not constitute approval or acceptance of any specific
 plants or work operations. The right is reserved to reject any plants or work, which are
 discovered to be unsatisfactory at any time before the end of the Maintenance Period..
 621.0036 Maintenance Period
 The acceptability of the plant material furnished and planted under this contract shall be at
 the end of the Maintenance Period, during which the Contractor, as necessary, shall employ all
 possible means to preserve the plants in a healthy and vigorously growing condition and to
 insure their successful establishment. During this period, the Contractor shall water, cultivate
 and prune the plants, and do any other work necessary to maintain the plants in a healthy
 growing condition. This shall include seasonal spraying with approved insecticides or
 fungicides as may be required. The Contractor shall also be responsible for protecting the plants
 from rodents. All dead or rejected plants shall be promptly removed from the project and
 replaced by live healthy plants meeting the same specifications. If such plants are declared
 unacceptable during the planting season, they shall be replaced during this planting season,
 otherwise, they shall be replaced during the next subsequent planting season.
 Such replacement plants are subject to the same requirements as the original plants and must
 be replaced in turn if they fail to meet the required standards. Plants designated for spring
 planting only, will be replaced only during the spring planting season unless otherwise directed
 by the Resident.
 The Maintenance Period shall commence after Physical Work Complete but not before the
 Landscape Warranty Bond has been received by the Resident if required by Special Provision
 and shall extend for two years after that date unless otherwise directed. Necessary replacements
 shall be made so that at the end of the Maintenance Period all plants shall be in a healthy,
 vigorous growing condition and free from sizable die-back.
 Replacements will be required for plants lost, damaged, or rejected, whatever the cause. The
 Contractor will be considered responsible for the plants until the end of the Maintenance Period.
 It shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor to replace any unsatisfactory plants on the
 project regardless of whether they are specifically designated by the Resident. In the case of
 individual doubtful plants, the Contractor may call upon the Resident to make a determination as
 to their acceptability, but it shall not be incumbent on the Resident to furnish the Contractor with
 exact lists of replacements.
 
 6-74
 
 All replacements of plants shall be completed by the end of the planting season before the
 end of the Maintenance Period. All replacement planting shall conform in every way to the
 requirements of the original planting. The Resident may require that any replacement plants that
 are not dormant, or that are planted late in the season, be sprayed, as directed with an approved
 anti-desiccant.
 621.0037 Method of Measurement The quantity of plants to be measured for payment will
 be the number of individual plants furnished and planted as required and accepted, excluding
 replacements.
 621.0038 Basis of Payment Each item of "Planting" will be paid for at the contract unit
 price for each accepted plant furnished and planted. Payment shall constitute full compensation
 for; furnishing and placing plants, digging, delivering, rodent protection, preparing plant pits,
 beds and drains; planting, watering, fertilizing, mulching, pruning, and the cleanup of planting
 areas; for all, fertilizer, mulch and other necessary materials; all labor, equipment, tools,
 Maintenance Period work, Replacement and Bonding (if required by Special Provision) and any
 other incidentals necessary to complete the work.
 When a bid item calls for a "Group" of trees, shrubs, vines or other plants, the Contractor

 d. Time of Transplanting Plants shall be dug and transplanted only when dormant,
 unless otherwise directed by the Resident. When dug, shrubs and hedges shall be moved
 directly to the final planting site and planted immediately, if possible. The rootball must be
 kept moist at all times during transplanting operations. If construction makes it impossible
 to replant the plants immediately after digging, the rootballs of the plants shall be kept
 completely covered with a thick layer of earth, straw, bark mulch, peat moss, or similar
 material which shall be kept moist at all times while the plants remain unplanted. Shrubs
 may be held in approved pots under conditions of delayed replanting.
 e. Pruning All pruning shall be done in accordance with the best horticultural practice.
 Dead, diseased, or injured shoots and branches shall be removed. In order to restore a
 normal balance between top and roots, deciduous shrubs shall be thinned by removing
 uniformly scattered, selected branches which shall be cut back to the main stem, as directed.
 The Resident may also require tip pruning. Tip pruning may also be required for evergreens.
 In the case of hedges, the Resident may require shearing to uniform, even surfaces.
 f. Watering As soon as the plants are planted they shall be thoroughly watered to the
 point where the roots and the surrounding earth are well saturated. The first application of
 liquid fertilizer shall be made during planting.
 
 6-76
 
 g. Mulching After removing all weeds and grass, the ground surface over the entire area
 of the planting pit shall be covered to a depth of 4 inches with bark mulch.
 622.04 Trees
 a. Digging All trees to be moved and replanted shall be dug with a solid ball of earth
 around the roots as is customary in good nursery practice. The diameter of the ball shall be not
 less than 10 times the diameter of the trunk of the tree measured 1 foot above the surface of the
 ground. Depth of the ball shall be not less than 60% of its diameter for balls up to 48 inch
 diameter. For balls over 48 inch diameter the ball shall have sufficient depth to maintain a solid
 structure and to encompass all the feeding roots under the ball area.
 b. Moving The ball must be maintained as a solid unit during the moving of the tree.
 The ball must be protected from breaking or cracking by careful handling and by being
 tightly bound with cord or rope over canvas, burlap, or similar wrapping. The ball shall be
 firmly attached to a tree platform of suitable size during moving operation, as required.
 c. Planting The trees shall be planted in the designated new location at the same depth in
 relation to the ground surface as before they were moved. Backfill consisting of 3 parts
 excavated soil and one part humus shall be placed under the ball and around the periphery
 of the ball. Backfill shall be puddled and firmed in place to eliminate all air pockets and
 give adequate support to the ball. Fertilizer shall be applied as specified in Section
 621.0025.
 d. Protection Every care shall be taken to prevent injury to the tree during the
 transplanting operation. All parts of the tree shall be carefully protected. Branches shall be
 tied out of the way of possible injury. No chain, cable, or heavy rope may be attached to the
 trunk or branches without protective padding adequate to prevent bruising or other injury.
 e. Time of Transplanting Trees shall be dug and transplanted only when dormant, unless
 otherwise directed. When dug, trees shall be moved directly to the final planting site and
 planted immediately if possible. The ball must be kept moist at all times during
 transplanting operations. If construction problems make it impossible to replant the tree
 immediately after digging, the ball of the tree must be completely covered with a thick layer
 of earth, bark mulch, peat moss or similar material which shall be kept moist at all times
 while the tree remains unplanted. Pruning, watering, fertilizing, mulching, and supporting
 shall be as specified in the applicable Sections of Section 621 - Landscaping.
 622.05 Maintenance It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to protect and care for
 transplants. They shall be watered weekly during dry weather or as otherwise directed. The
 Contractor shall take steps required to protect the plants from damage and from diseases and
 pests. Should damage occur it shall be repaired by the Contractor, according to the best
 horticultural practice. The Contractor shall be responsible for transplants through one growing
 season.
 
 6-77
 
 622.06 Replacement If the ball is badly broken or the plants are otherwise badly damaged or
 if, in the opinion of the Resident, during the life of the contract the plants show such signs of
 loss of health or appear to be in danger of dying, the Contractor will be required to replace the
 plants with others of the same size and variety or approved plants of equal value, at the proper
 season.
 622.07 Method of Measurement
 Transplanting shrubs or trees will be measured in place after transplanting by the single
 shrub or tree unit.

 626.034 Concrete Foundations
 If noted on the plans, the Department has completed an appropriate test boring program to
 evaluate subsurface conditions in the general vicinity of proposed foundations for traffic signal
 dual purpose and mast arm poles and highway sign bridge, cantilever, and butterfly support
 structures. The associated boring log(s), as well as foundation requirements and any foundationspecific information are provided on the plans. Unless another foundation type is specified on
 the plans, foundations shall consist of cast-in-place reinforced concrete drilled shafts. Supplier
 shall determine the bending moment, shear force, torsion and axial load at the top of each mast
 arm or dual purpose pole or sign support structure foundation. Foundation size (diameter and
 length) shall depend on the Bending Moment and Torsion at the top of the foundation and shall
 be taken off of the specified charts that are provided in Standard Detail 626, as set forth on the
 plans. The larger of the foundation sizes shown for Bending Moment or Torsion shall be the
 required foundation size. Length shall be added in accordance with the plans to account for
 embankment fill or sloping ground conditions. Lengths are depths below lowest adjacent
 (proposed) grade. Reinforcing shall be as specified on the associated chart in Standard Detail
 626.
 The Contractor is responsible for final design of the above-grade components of the mast arm or
 sign support structure. Design computations that are part of the Contractor’s design submittal
 shall include the actual loads (bending moment, shear force, torsion and axial load) at the top of
 each foundation. These actual design loads at the top of each foundation that are provided by
 the Contractor as part of their submittal will be used by the Department to check the
 Contractor’s proposed size of the drilled shafts. The Contractor shall not commence foundation
 construction prior to receiving approval from the Department’s geotechnical group.
 In the absence of design requirements being provided on the plans, the Contractor shall prepare
 and submit the foundation design(s) to the Department for approval. Likewise, the Contractor
 may propose an alternate shallow spread footing or drilled shaft configuration/ design than that
 
 6-84
 
 set forth on the drawings. In either case, any Contractor-prepared foundation design shall meet
 the design criteria of Section 13 of the current edition of AASHTO “Standard Specifications for
 Structural Supports for Highway Sign, Luminaires and Traffic Signals”, unless otherwise
 specified by the Department. Geotechnical design of the foundations shall be in accordance
 with Section 13 of the afore-mentioned AASHTO code and AASHTO Standard Specifications
 for Highway Bridges,17th Edition, as well as FHWA-IF-99-025, Drilled Shafts, Construction
 Procedures and Design Methods. In addition to other design requirements, foundation design
 shall account for Torsion for which a minimum Factor of Safety equal to 1.2 shall be achieved.
 In evaluating axial capacity and torsional resistance in cohesionless soils, load transfer
 coefficient or side resistance coefficient (beta, β) will be used in accordance with Subsection
 13.3.5.1 of FHWA-NHI-10-016, with beta determined in accordance with Equations 13-13 and
 13-11 for silty sands to sandy silts (with varying amounts of gravel). Reference is made to
 Illinois DOT for additional torsional design methodology. The design criteria for the resistance
 of drilled shaft and spread footing foundations against overturning, sliding and bearing capacity
 failure shall meet the requirements of Section 4 of AASHTO Standard Specifications, 17th
 Edition. The structural design of foundations shall meet the requirements of AASHTO Standard
 Specifications, 17th Edition. The Contractor shall submit to the Department for approval, three
 (3) copies of detailed plans and calculations, prepared by a State of Maine licensed Professional
 Engineer, of the proposed foundation. Construction of foundation(s) shall not commence until
 the Department has approved the foundation design.
 If a test boring program has not been completed by the Department, Contractor may use the
 assumed soil properties provided on the plans to develop foundation designs for the sole purpose
 of preparing a bid. Prior to construction, the Contractor shall engage a qualified geotechnical
 firm or person to complete test boring(s) in the vicinity of the foundations, including standard
 penetration tests and soil sampling, determine soil properties for use in the foundation design,
 and complete geotechnical analyses and geotechnical foundation design for review and approval
 by the Department. All costs associated with the work required to sample, classify and analyze
 the soil, design the foundation and prepare submittals shall be incidental to related Contract
 items. The Contractor shall submit 3 copies of all foundation design work, structural and
 geotechnical, together with computations and plans used for design purposes. The computations
 shall be sufficiently detailed to allow the Department to check and approve the computations.
 Design calculations that consist of computer generated output shall be supplemented with at
 least one hand calculation and graphic demonstrating the design methodology used. Design
 calculations shall provide thorough documentation of the sources of equations used and material
 properties. Design submittals not meeting these criteria will be rejected.
 Drilled shafts shall not be permanently cased, except for the top 3.0 feet; concrete shall be cast
 directly against the surrounding soil. Shallow spread footings shall be founded at least 5.0 feet
 below the lowest surrounding proposed grade for frost protection. If soil conditions differ
 materially from those described on the boring logs, the contractor shall stop work on that
 foundation and contact the Resident.
 All unsuitable material (including but not limited to peat, organic material, and material that has
 been disturbed and/or dumped) within the limits of a foundation shall be removed to the limits
 
 6-85
 
 directed by the Resident. Drilled shaft depths shall be increased as directed by the Department
 to account for the unsuitable material. Unsuitable material removed from below subgrade for
 spread footing foundations shall be replaced with compacted material, as set forth below for
 foundation backfill. Drilled shaft foundation holes, except in ledge, shall be excavated by auger
 method to the neat line of the outside dimensions of the footing without disturbing the soil
 around or below the proposed footing. Drilled shafts shall not be permanently cased, except for
 the top 3 feet; concrete shall be cast directly against the surrounding soil. In areas where rock or
 ledge is encountered above the proposed bottom of foundation, the Contractor will have the
 option of removing rock and placing the foundation at the design depth shown on the plans, or
 constructing a grouted rock-anchored foundation system. Rock-anchored foundations shall be
 constructed according to Standard Detail 626(06) Foundations for Traffic Signals, Highway
 Signing and Lighting, or as approved by the Department for drilled shafts greater than 30 inches
 in diameter.
 Concrete for drilled shafts shall be placed as soon after excavation as practicable to prevent
 debris from collecting in the excavated area. The Contractor shall provide temporary dewatering
 of excavations for foundations such that concrete is placed in the dry. Concrete for drilled shafts
 shall be placed by tremie methods as temporary casing is withdrawn to prevent debris from
 contaminating the foundation and to ensure concrete is cast against the surrounding soil.
 Concrete for drilled shafts and spread footings shall be Class A in accordance with Section 502 Structural Concrete. Precast foundations will not be permitted. Back fill for spread footing
 foundations shall be Gravel Borrow meeting the requirements of Section 703.20 - Gravel
 Borrow. Gravel Borrow shall be placed in layers not exceeding 8 inches in depth before
 compaction. Each layer of back fill shall be thoroughly compacted by use of power tampers to
 at least 95% of the material’s maximum dry density as measured in the field per AASHTO T191
 or by an approved method using calibrated nuclear device. All back filling and compacting shall
 be in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 206 – Structural Excavation.
 Before placing concrete, the required elbows of entrance conduits, reinforcing steel and anchor
 bolts shall be carefully positioned. The anchor bolt size and the bolt circle diameter shall be
 determined from data furnished by the supplier of the poles or as shown on the plans. Anchor
 bolts for use with breakaway couplings, longitudinally grooved-type, shall be 1 inch diameter
 and shall project between 2½ and 3 inches above the top of the foundation. All other anchor
 bolts shall be a minimum of 1 inch diameter and shall project sufficiently to accommodate the
 thickness of the base plus all nuts and washers. The bolt length shall also be sufficient to allow
 clearances of approximately ½ inch below the leveling nut and ¼ inch above the top nut. At
 least two threads on each anchor bolt shall project beyond the outside of the nuts holding the
 plumbed pole.
 All foundations shall be warranteed against leaning and corrosion for two years after
 the project is completed. If the lean is greater than 2 degrees from normal or the foundation is
 spalling within the first two years, the Contractor shall replace the foundation at no extra cost.
 The finished ground at each foundation shall be graded flush with the top of the foundation,
 except at locations where the foundation is protected by guardrail, by curb, or is outside the clear
 
 6-86
 
 zone. If required, approved backfill material shall be added to grade the slopes as specified.
 There will be no additional compensation for furnishing, placing and compacting material flush
 around the foundation. In all cases, the surface area around the foundations shall be graded to
 drain away from the foundation and loamed and seeded in accordance with the requirements of
 Section 615 and Section 618.
 Concrete foundations designated to be modified or removed shall be modified or removed as
 shown on the plans. Debris resulting from the modification or removal shall be removed from
 the project. Once removal has been completed, the area shall be brought to grade by addition of
 granular material and loam, or by loam only, depending on the extent of modification or
 removal. The area shall then be seeded in accordance with Section 618.
 The concrete portion of the foundations exposed to view shall have a troweled finish. A
 drainage groove shall be formed in the horizontal surface of the foundation. The top of the
 concrete foundation shall be horizontal.
 When the anchor bolt template is removed, the threads of the anchor bolts shall be greased
 and protected with a metal sleeve, held in position with nuts and washers to be furnished with
 the bolts. This thread protection shall remain in place until the pole or other equipment is
 installed.
 A copper-clad steel ground rod shall be installed when shown on the plans.

 Temporary pavement marking lines, defined in Special Provision Section 652, Maintenance
 of Traffic, Temporary Centerline, will be applied as many times as necessary to properly
 delineate traffic lanes for the safe passage of traffic. Bi-directional delineators may be used in
 place of temporary lines, except where specified otherwise in Special Provision 652
 Maintenance of Traffic, Temporary Centerline. Delineators will be applied at 40 foot intervals.
 In overnight lane closure areas that are not to be overlaid, temporary plastic lines or raised
 pavement markers shall be used through the length of the taper.
 Newly painted lines, markings and curb shall be protected from traffic by the use of cones,
 stationary vehicles or other approved methods until the paint is dry.
 627.05 Preparation of Surface Immediately before applying the pavement marking paint to
 the pavement or curb, the surface shall be dry and entirely free from dirt, grease, oil, or other
 foreign matter.
 Surface preparation for application of plastic markings shall conform to the manufacturer's
 recommendations.
 627.06 Application Prior to applying paint for final pavement lines, the Contractor shall
 perform a test for paint thickness by furnishing and placing a piece of smooth, clean metal with
 an area of at least 144 in² in the path of the striping truck. The striping truck shall be passed
 over the piece of metal, painting the surface as it passes, without applying beads. The result of
 this test will be used to determine the pressure setting and speed of the truck when applying
 paint to obtain the specified thickness. Additional paint thickness testing may be required on the
 final paint markings. The wet thickness of paint without beads on final pavement lines shall be
 a minimum of 16 mils.
 On other final pavement markings and on curb, where the paint is applied by hand painting
 or spraying, application shall be in two uniform covering coats, each at least 10 mils thick.
 Before the second coat of paint has dried, the glass beads shall be applied by a pressure system
 that will force the glass beads onto the undried paint as uniformly as possible.

 rate of 8 lbs./gal of paint and in sufficient quantity to assure complete and uniform coverage of
 hand painted surfaces.
 Temporary painted lines and markings shall be applied as specified for permanent painted
 lines, except that the thickness shall be a minimum of 16 mils.
 
 6-90
 
 Temporary pliant polymer marking material shall be used for temporary markings on the
 final pavement and on pavements not to be resurfaced when such pavement markings do not
 conform to the final pavement markings pattern.
 The plastic final pavement lines and markings shall be applied in accordance with the
 manufacturer's recommendations by the inlay method of application.
 627.07 Establishment Period Inlaid plastic pavement lines and marking material furnished
 and installed under this contract for final pavement markings shall still be subject to a six-month
 period of establishment.
 The period of establishment shall commence as soon as the plastic pavement lines and
 markings are complete and in place and shall continue for six months. At the end of the
 establishment period, a minimum of 95% of the plastic pavement lines and markings shall still
 be in place to be acceptable.
 If less than 95% of the plastic pavement lines and markings are in place after six months, the
 Contractor shall replace all unsatisfactory plastic pavement lines and markings on the project
 without additional payment. Plastic pavement lines and markings designated for replacement
 shall be installed according to these specifications, unless otherwise directed. Plastic pavement
 lines and markings replaced at the end of the six month establishment period will not be subject
 to a further establishment period.
 627.08 Removing Lines and Markings When it is necessary to remove pavement lines and
 markings, it shall be done by high pressure water, sand blasting, solvent or other acceptable
 means. The method chosen must be capable of completely eradicating the existing line or
 marking without damage to the pavement. Burning and grinding to remove temporary markings
 from final pavement or from existing pavement not to be resurfaced will not be permitted.
 627.09 Method of Measurement The quantity of permanent pavement marking lines
 measured for payment will be the number of feet shown in the Schedule of Items in the contract.
 This quantity will be considered final and no adjustments will be made except when changes
 resulting in increases or decreases are made by the Resident.
 Double yellow centerline, broken or solid, will be considered one line for measurement
 purposes. The measurement of broken lines will include the gaps when painted and will not
 include the gaps when plastic. Temporary pavement marking lines will be measured as one
 lump sum for work accepted. All other pavement markings will be measured by the square foot
 for work actually done.
 Reflectorized curb will be measured or computed by the square foot of curb surface actually
 painted and reflectorized.
 The accepted quantity of removing existing pavement markings will be measured by the
 square foot.
 
 6-91
 
 Temporary Bi-directional Yellow Delineators will be measured by each unit, complete in
 place, maintained, and accepted.
 627.10 Basis of Payment The accepted quantity of permanent pavement marking lines will
 be paid for at the contract unit price per foot. No adjustment will be made to the quantity for
 payment, except as described under Method of Measurement above. All other permanent
 pavement markings will be paid for at the contract unit price per square foot.

 submit modifications of the TCP to the Department for review, and shall implement these
 changes at no additional cost to the Contract. Nothing in this Section shall negate the
 Contractor’s obligations set forth in Section 110 - Indemnification, Bonding, and Insurance. The
 creation and modification of the TCP will be considered incidental to the related 652 items.
 652.3.4 General Prior to starting any work on any part of the project adjacent to or being
 used by the traveling public, the Contractor shall install the appropriate traffic control devices in
 accordance with the plans, specifications and the latest edition of Manual of Uniform Traffic
 Control Devices, Part VI. The Contractor shall continuously maintain the traffic control devices
 in their proper position, and they shall be kept clean, legible and in good repair throughout the
 duration of the work. If notified that the traffic control devices are not in place or not properly
 maintained, the Contractor may be ordered to immediately suspend work until all deficiencies
 are corrected.
 No equipment or vehicles of the Contractor, their subcontractors, or employees engaged in
 work on this contract shall be parked or stopped on lanes carrying traffic, or on lanes or
 shoulders adjacent to lanes carrying traffic, at any time, except as required by ongoing work
 operations. Contractor equipment or vehicles shall never be used to stop, block, or channelize
 traffic.
 The Contractor shall not store material or park equipment within 15 feet of the edge of the
 established travel lanes. Equipment parked overnight between 15 and 30 feet of the edge of the
 travel lane shall be placed behind positive barriers if feasible, or clearly marked by channelizing
 devices or other reflective devices.
 Channelization devices shall include Vertical Panel Markers, Barricades, Cones, and Drums.
 These devices shall be installed and maintained at the spacing determined by the MUTCD
 through the work area.
 Channelization devices consisting of barricades or drums, at a maximum spacing of 50 feet,
 shall be used in guardrail areas when neither the existing guardrail nor the new guardrail is in
 place.
 
 6-149
 
 The Contractor shall maintain existing guardrails and/or barriers until removal is necessary
 for construction. The Contractor shall use a temporary barrier or appropriate channelizing
 devices while the guardrails and/or barriers are absent. Permanent guardrails and barriers shall
 be installed as soon as possible to minimize risk to the public.
 All excavation areas adjacent to the roadway shall be channelized continuously in both
 directions for the length of the project in all areas where the centerline strip is not effective in
 accordance with the latest edition of the MUTCD.
 Where the roadway is adjacent to an area being excavated, a minimum 2 foot shoulder
 should be maintained and the effective slope of the earth excavation beyond the 2 foot shoulder
 shall not be steeper than a 1½ horizontal to 1 vertical. The effective slope of rock excavation
 shall not be steeper than 1 horizontal to 1 vertical beyond the 2 foot shoulder. In the case of cuts
 over 5 feet deep, an earth berm or other approved barrier shall be placed between the travel lane
 and the excavated area.
 In this instance, travel speeds shall be limited by specific advisory signing to 20 miles per
 hour in all cases. When excavation does not leave sufficient usable widths to maintain two-way
 traffic as provided in Section 105.4 - Maintenance of Work, one-lane traffic controlled by a
 traffic signal or continuous flagging may be considered. Closely spaced vertical panels, drums
 or other channelizing devices shall be used on any of these types of areas that are left exposed
 for short durations.
 When paving operations or shoulder grading leave a 3 inch or less exposed vertical face at
 the edge of the traveled way, channelization devices shall be placed 2 feet outside the edge of
 the pavement at intervals not exceeding 600 feet and a 48 inch by 48 inch W8-9 Low Shoulder
 sign shall be placed at a maximum spacing of ½ mile. When paving operations or shoulder
 grading leave greater than a 3 inch exposed vertical face at the edge of the traveled way, the
 Contractor shall place shoulder material for a width of at least 4 feet to meet the pavement
 grade, and place channelizing devices as above, before the lane is opened to traffic.
 Special Detours and temporary structures, if used, shall meet applicable AASHTO standards,
 including curve radii and grade.

 that the bottom of the sign is either 1) 12 inches or 2) greater than 5 feet above the traveled way.
 Post-mounted signs shall be erected so the bottom of the sign is no less than 5 feet above the
 traveled way, and 7 feet above the traveled way in business, commercial, and residential areas.
 Post-mounted signs must be erected so that the sign face is in a true vertical position. All signs
 shall be placed so that they are not obstructed in any manner and immediately modified to
 ensure proper visibility if obstructed. Signs may be mounted lower or higher to fit the situation
 when authorized by the Resident. Cones shall be either weighted or nailed. Tires will not be
 allowed as weights.
 
 6-150
 
 Vertical panel markers shall be mounted with the top at least 4 feet above the traveled way.
 Drums shall not be weighted on the top. Drain holes shall be provided to prevent water from
 accumulating in the drums. Drums may be weighted with up to 6 inches of loose dry sand.
 The Contractor shall operate and maintain the flashing arrow board unit and trailer and shall
 continuously supply fuel and lubrication for dependable service during the life of the contract.
 The units shall remain in continuous night and day service at locations designated until the
 Resident designates a new location or discontinuance of service.
 The Contractor shall maintain the devices in proper position and clean them as necessary.
 Maintenance shall include the covering and uncovering of all signs when no longer applicable
 (even if for a very short duration). The sign shall be considered adequately covered when no
 part of the sign face is visible either around or through the covering.
 The Contractor shall replace damaged traffic control devices with devices of acceptable
 quality, as directed by the Resident.
 652.3.6 Traffic Control The Contractor shall provide a minimum roadway width of 22 feet
 for two-way traffic and 11 feet for one-way traffic. The existing travel way width shall be
 maintained to the maximum extent practical. Vertical panel markers, drums, cones, or striping
 shall be used to clearly delineate the roadway through the construction area. Two-way traffic
 operation shall be provided at all times that the Contractor is not working on the project. Oneway traffic shall be controlled through work areas by flaggers, utilizing radios, field telephones,
 or other means of direct communication.
 The traffic control devices shall be moved or removed as the work progresses to assure
 compatibility between the uses of the traffic control devices and the traffic flow. Traffic control
 devices that become unnecessary shall be immediately removed from use.
 Pavement markings shall be altered as required to conform to the existing traffic flow
 pattern. Repainting of pavement marking line, if required to maintain the effectiveness of the
 line, shall be considered maintenance of traffic control devices. No separate payment will be
 made. Inappropriate existing pavement markings shall be removed whenever traffic is rerouted,
 and temporary construction pavement markings shall be placed. Obliteration and removal of
 non-applicable markings and placement of temporary construction pavement markings shall be
 considered maintenance of traffic control devices and will be paid for under the appropriate
 Contract item. Traffic changes shall not be made unless there is sufficient time, equipment,
 materials, and personnel available to complete the change properly before the end of the
 workday. This provision will not be required when traffic is rerouted for brief periods during

 used, and the flagger station shall be illuminated to assure visibility in accordance with 652.6.2.
 Flagger stations shall be located far enough in advance of the workspace so that approaching
 road users will have sufficient distance to stop at the intended stopping point. While flagging,
 the flagger should stand either on the shoulder adjacent to the traffic being controlled, or in the
 closed lane. At a spot obstruction with adequate sight distance, the flagger may stand on the
 shoulder opposite the closed sections to operate effectively. Under no circumstances shall the
 flagger stand in the lane being used by moving traffic or have their back to oncoming traffic.
 The flagger should be clearly visible to approaching traffic at all times and should have a clear
 escape route.
 When conditions do not allow for proper approach sight distance of a flagger or storage
 space for waiting vehicles, additional flaggers shall be used at the rear of the backlogged traffic
 or at a point where approaching vehicles have adequate stopping sight distance to the rear of the
 backlogged traffic. All flagger stations shall be signed, even when in close proximity. The
 signs shall be removed or covered when flagger operations are not in place, even if it is for a
 very short duration.

 SECTION 660 ON-THE-JOB TRAINING
 660.01 Description On-The-Job Training programs (OJT) are required as part of the
 Contractor’s equal employment opportunity affirmative action program. The primary objective
 of on the job training shall be to train and upgrade women, minorities, and disadvantaged
 workers toward journey worker status in the type of trade or job classification involved.
 660.02 Requirements Contractors shall begin training in accordance with OJT Special
 Provision 660 as follows for all projects with assigned trainee slots.
 Total number of trainee slots required will be the amount listed in the Schedule of Items.
 All On-The-Job Training will be performed in accordance with 23 CFR 230, Subpart A,
 Appendix B and MaineDOT On-The-Job Training Program Manual. Training classifications
 shall be distributed among work classifications needed by the Contractor in the skilled and semiskilled craft levels identified on the Letter of Intent. These classifications must be needed on
 
 6-169
 
 that specific project and have sufficient work hours available to meet the training plan activities
 and duration.
 The Contractor shall receive credit for training hours only after, the Department, or its
 representative, has approved the program. For this reason, contractors are reminded to register
 candidates at the onset of project work in order to guarantee the maximum training time for the
 enrollee to complete the OJT program. Contractors will be reimbursed for such approved
 trainee slots upon successful completion of the training.
 The Contractor shall make every effort to enroll minority and women trainees (e.g., by
 conducting systematic and direct recruitment through public and private sources likely to yield
 women, minorities, and disadvantaged trainees) to the extent that such persons are available
 within a reasonable area of recruitment. The contractor shall be responsible for demonstrating
 to the Department the steps taken in pursuance thereof, before determination as to whether the
 Contractor is in compliance with this program. These semi-skilled and skilled craft employment
 goals set by this office of Federal Contractor Compliance Programs are as follows: 6.9 percent
 women and 0.05 percent minorities, and 10 percent for women, and 0.05 percent for minorities
 in un-skilled classes respectively statewide. For this reason, whether a Contractor meets these
 goals or not, the Department will require all contractors to participate in the program until such
 time that the goals are met as a whole. If any Contractor falls below these standards, it shall
 immediately implement an Affirmative Action Program to increase the employment and
 retention of women, minorities and the disadvantaged.
 Trainees shall not be enrolled in a classification in which they have successfully completed a
 training course leading to journey-level status, or for which they have held employment as a
 journey level worker. No Contractor shall enroll trainees who possess post-secondary degrees,
 certification, or diploma without first securing written approval from the Civil Rights Office.
 Only individuals with non-construction oriented credentials, except those who are upgraded will
 be considered. Upgrades from semi-skilled to skilled crafts is acceptable but must be approved
 by the Department or its representative.
 The minimum length and type of training for each classification will be as established in the
 training program selected by the Contractor and approved by the Department. Nothing in this
 section limits a Contractor to only the curriculum found in the OJT Manual. The Department
 will consider a training curriculum if it meets the equal employment opportunity obligations that
 bring women, minorities, and the disadvantaged in to the industry and to retain them in the
 industry at the journey level of the classification of the training. Contractors are encouraged to
 examine training opportunities, which fit their needs for the project and for the company.
 The Contractor shall complete and forward to the Department’s OJT or its representative,
 the Letter of Intent, the OJT Registration Form, and the Workforce Breakdown Form for
 approval by the Department. The Contractor shall maintain records of trainee activities and
 performance and furnish the department or its representative with documentation of each
 trainee’s progress using the Weekly Evaluation Form. Requests for changes in the number of
 trainee’s shall be handled as other bid items. The Contractor must submit a change order with
 
 6-170
 
 justification to the resident. The Resident will then forward that request to the Civil Rights
 Office for consideration.
 Once an OJT is approved by the Department, The Contractor shall begin training at the onset
 of employment for the trade classification. Trainees are expected to remain in status as long as
 training opportunities exist in the work classification, or until the training program is completed.
 Section 660 shall be included directly in all contracts to subcontractors. Subcontractors are
 expected to comply with craft goals. As with other Sections applied to a Subcontractor, the
 Contractor retains obligations accordingly.
 660.03 Payment to the Trainee. Trainees will be paid at least 60 percent of the appropriate
 minimum journeyman's rate specified in the contract for the first half of the training period, 75
 percent for the third quarter of the training period, and 90 percent for the last quarter of the
 training period, unless apprentices or trainees in an approved existing program are enrolled as
 trainees on this project. In that case, the appropriate rates approved by the Departments of Labor
 or Transportation in connection with the existing program shall apply to all trainees being
 trained for the same classification who are covered by this Training Special Provision.
 The contractor shall furnish the trainee a copy of the program manual he will follow in
 providing the training. Once the Department has determined that the trainee has completed the
 required hours of training a certificate showing the type and length of training satisfactorily
 completed will be issued.
 660.04 Submittals The Contractor shall complete and forward to the Department’s OJT and
 Contract Compliance Consultant, the Letter of Intent, the OJT Registration Form, and the
 Workforce Breakdown Form. The Contractor shall maintain records of trainee activities and
 performance and furnish the department or its representative with documentation of each
 trainee’s progress using the Weekly Evaluation Form. Requests for changes in the number of
 trainee’s shall be handled as other bid items. The Contractor must submit a change order with
 justification to the resident. The Resident will then forward that request to the Civil Rights
 Office for consideration.
 660.05 Off-Site Training Some offsite training is permissible as long as the training is an
 integral part of an approved training program and does not comprise a significant part of the
 overall training. The Contractor must forward a completed Off-Site OJT Request/Approval
 Form with a cover letter explaining the intent of the transfer to the Civil Rights Office.
 Provided the Contractor has Department approval, training may be conducted off –site.
 Verification of training hours shall be determined for credit on off-site work by reviewing the
 Weekly OJT Evaluation Form.
 660.06 Method of Measurement The OJT item will be measured by the number of OJT
 trainees who successfully complete an approved training program. A trainee will be considered
 
 6-171
 
 successfully complete for purposes of payment when the trainee receives a certificate of
 completion from the Department.
 660.07 Basis of Payment to the Contractor. The OJT shall be paid for once successfully
 completed at the contract unit price per each. Payment will be made even though the Contractor
 may have received additional training program funds from other sources, provided such other
 source does not prohibit the Contractor from receiving other payment. No payment will be
 made for training not completed in accordance with this specification, the OJT Manual, and the
 Code of Federal Regulations. No payment will be made to the Contractor if the Department
 determines the Contractor failed to provide the required training. The Department shall work
 with any Contractor whose efforts have been deemed not consistent with the spirit or intent of
 the Program.
 660.08 Sanctions. When the Department determines the Contractor has not complied with
 this Section, the Department shall move within 10 days of the ruling to advise the Contractor, in
 writing, that documentation of good faith effort will be required. If the Department determines
 that good faith effort was not met, sanctions will be imposed as follows: the number of training
 hours remaining to be completed for each training hour required will be multiplied by the
 prevailing wage rate plus fringes for that particular trainee’s classification. The resulting figure
 may be deducted from any monies due the contractor, as determined by the Department. A
 corrective action plan may be developed in order to avoid similar future findings.

 The MSE walls shall be dimensioned so that the factored bearing pressure resistance of the
 foundation soils, as noted on the plans, is not exceeded. Requirements for over excavation of
 native foundation soils and replacement with compacted structural fill are detailed on the plans.
 The design by the wall system supplier shall consider the stability of the wall as outlined
 below and in the Contract Documents:
 (a) Failure Plane The theoretical failure plane within the reinforced soil mass shall
 be determined per LRFD Section 11 and be analyzed so that the soil stabilizing
 components extend sufficiently beyond the failure plane within the reinforced soil mass
 to stabilize the material. External loads which affect the internal stability such as those
 applied through piling, bridge footings, traffic, slope surcharge, hydrostatic, and seismic
 loads shall be accounted for in the design.
 (b) External Stability - Load and Resistance Factors Loads and load combinations
 selected for design shall be consistent with AASHTO LRFD. Application of load factors
 shall be taken as specified in AASHTO LRFD. Sliding resistance factors and bearing
 resistance factors shall be consistent with LRFD Section 10. Overturning provisions of
 LRFD Section 11 shall apply.
 MSE walls shall be designed to resist failure by instability of temporary construction
 slope. Passive pressure in front of the wall mass shall be assumed to be zero for design
 purposes. The factored applied bearing pressures under the MSE mass for each reinforced
 length shall be clearly indicated on the design drawing.
 (c) Internal Stability - Load and Resistance Factors Evaluation of reinforcement
 pullout, reinforcement rupture and panel connection pullout or rupture shall be consistent
 with LRFD Section 11. Loads, load combinations and load factors shall be as specified
 in LRFD Article 11.
 Resistance factors for internal design shall be consistent with
 LRFD Article 11. Maximum reinforcement loads shall be calculated using the Simplified
 Method approach. Calculations for factored stresses and resistances shall be based upon
 assumed conditions at the end of the design life. The design life of steel soil
 reinforcements shall comply with LRFD Section 11.
 (d) Backfill and Foundation Soils Parameters. The friction angle of the select
 backfill used in the reinforced fill zone for the internal stability design of the wall shall be
 assumed to be 34° unless noted otherwise. The friction angle of the foundation soils and
 random backfill shall be assumed to be 30° unless otherwise shown on the plans.
 (e) Reinforcement Length. The soil reinforcement shall be the same length from the
 bottom to the top of each wall section. The reinforcement length defining the width of
 the entire reinforced soil mass may vary with wall height. The minimum length of the
 soil reinforcement shall be 8 ft, but shall not be less than 70 percent of the wall height, H,
 for walls with level surcharges, or 70 percent of H1 for walls with a sloped surcharge or
 walls supporting an abutment. The mechanical wall height, H or H1, shall be the vertical
 
 6-201
 
 difference between the top of the leveling footing and the elevation at which the failure
 surface, as described above, intercepts the ground surface supported by the wall.
 (f) Steel Reinforcement For steel reinforcements, all structural connections,
 tie strips and loop inserts, the following galvanization and carbon steel loss rates
 shall be assumed:
 Zinc galvanizing (first 2 years)
 Zinc galvanizing (subsequent years to depletion):
 Carbon Steel (after zinc depletion to 100 yrs):
 
 Mil./year/side
 0.58
 0.16
 0.47
 
 Calculations for factored stresses and resistances in steel reinforcements and
 connections, including tie-strips and loop inserts, shall be based upon assumed
 conditions at the end of the design life. (or: The nominal long-term design
 strength in steel reinforcements and connections, including tie-strips and loop
 inserts shall be determined at the end of the service life.) The applied factored
 reinforcement loads shall be calculated in accordance with LRFD Section
 11.10.6.2, and shall be checked against the nominal tensile strength multiplied by
 a resistance factor per LRFD Table 11.5.7-1. Transverse and longitudinal grid
 members shall be sized in accordance with ASTM A 185.
 When the expected differential settlement normal to the wall exceeds 3 in,
 the lower level reinforcement facing connections shall be designed to
 accommodate the increased tensile forces due to settlement.
 (g) Facing Panel Requirements
 1. Facing panels shall be designed to resist compaction stresses that occur during
 wall erection.
 2. The minimum thickness for concrete panels in the zone of embedded
 connections shall be 5.5 in and 3.5 in elsewhere. The minimum concrete cover shall

 placed and compacted in such a manner as to avoid any damage or disturbance of the wall
 materials or misalignment of the facing panels or reinforcing elements. Any wall materials
 which become damaged during backfill placement shall be removed and replaced at the
 Contractor’s expense. Any misalignment or distortion of the wall facing panels due to
 placement of backfill outside the limits of this specification shall be corrected by the Contractor
 at his expense. Prior to the placement of the soil reinforcement, the backfill elevation after
 compaction shall be at the required elevation of the reinforcements. At each reinforcement
 level, the backfill shall be placed to the level of the connection. Backfill placement methods
 near the panels shall assure that no voids exist directly beneath the reinforcing element.
 Gravel borrow backfill shall be compacted in accordance with Subsection 203.12 except
 that the minimum required compaction shall be 92 percent of maximum density as determined
 by AASHTO T180, Method C or D (with oversize correction, as outlined in Note 7 of that test).
 If 30 percent or more of the backfill material is greater than 3/4 in. in size, AASHTO T180 is
 not applicable, and the acceptance criterion for control of compaction shall be either a minimum
 of 70 percent of the relative density of the material as determined by ASTM D4253 and D4254,
 or a method of compaction consisting of at least 4 (four) passes by a heavy roller.
 Where spread footings support bridge or other structural loads, the top 5 ft below the
 bottom of footing elevation shall be compacted to 98 percent of the maximum density as
 determined by AASHTO T180, Method C or D (with oversize correction, as outlined in Note 7
 of that test).
 The moisture content (determined in accordance with AASHTO T180, Method C or D) of
 the backfill material prior to and during compaction shall be uniformly distributed throughout
 each layer. Backfill materials shall have be placed at a moisture content not more than 2
 percentage points less than or equal to the optimum moisture content. Backfill material with a
 placement moisture content in excess of the optimum moisture content shall be removed and
 reworked until the moisture content is uniformly acceptable throughout the entire lift.
 At each reinforcing level, backfill shall be leveled before placing and bolting the
 reinforcing. The maximum lift thickness after compaction shall not exceed 12 in. The
 Contractor shall decrease this lift thickness, if necessary, to obtain the specified density.
 Heavy compaction equipment shall not be used to compact backfill within 3 ft of the wall
 face. Compaction within 3 ft of the back face of the wall shall be achieved by at least three (3)
 passes of lightweight mechanical tamper, lightweight roller, or vibratory system. The specified
 lift thickness shall be adjusted as warranted by the type of compaction equipment actually used.
 No vehicular equipment shall be operated within 3 ft of the panels.
 The frequency of sampling of the backfill material necessary to assure gradation control
 throughout construction shall be as directed by the Resident.
 
 6-210
 
 At the end of each day’s operation, the Contractor shall slope the last level of the backfill
 away from the wall facing to rapidly direct runoff away from the wall face. In addition, the
 Contractor shall not allow surface runoff from adjacent areas to enter the wall construction site.
 677.12 Reinforcement Placement Prior to placing the first layer of reinforcements (strips,
 mats or grids), backfill shall be placed and compacted in accordance with Subsection 677.11,
 Backfill Placement.
 Bending of reinforcements in the horizontal plane resulting in a permanent deformation in
 their alignment shall not be allowed. Gradual bending in the vertical direction that does not
 result in permanent deformations is allowable.
 Cutting of longitudinal or transverse reinforcement bars to avoid conflicts with utility
 obstructions or piles will not be allowed. A structural connection (yokes) from the wall panel to
 the reinforcement shall be used whenever it is necessary to avoid cutting or excessive skewing
 of reinforcement due to pile or utility conflicts.
 Soil reinforcements shall be placed normal to the face of the wall, unless otherwise shown
 on the plans or directed by the Resident. If skewing of the soil reinforcements is required due to
 obstructions in the reinforced fill, rotatable bolted connections shall be used and the maximum
 skew angle shall not exceed 15º from the normal position except in the case of acute corner
 where redundant reinforcements are used. The tensile capacity of splayed reinforcement shall be
 reduced by the cosine of the splay angle.
 677.13 Method of Measurement Mechanically Stabilized Earth Retaining Wall will be
 measured by the square foot of face area computed using the plan dimensions. No adjustment in
 the pay quantity will be made if the computed quantity, based on the working drawings, varies
 from the plan quantity.
 Vertical dimension limits will be from the top of leveling pad to the top of the wall facing
 units, as shown on the plans. The horizontal dimension limits will be from the edges of the
 facing units at each end of a wall, as shown on the plans. No field measurements will be made
 unless the Resident specifies, in writing, a change to the limits indicated on the plans.

 703.0201 Alkali Silica Reactive Aggregates. All coarse and fine aggregates proposed for
 use in concrete shall be tested for Alkali Silica Reactivity (ASR) potential under AASHTO T
 303 (ASTM C 1260), Accelerated Detection of Potentially Deleterious Expansion of Mortar
 Bars Due to Alkali-Silica Reaction, prior to being accepted for use. Acceptance will be based
 on testing performed by the Department. Sampling will be performed by the Department from
 stockpiles located at the Contractor’s/supplier’s ready mixed concrete plants. Aggregate
 approvals will be performed on a 3-year cycle, unless the source or character of the aggregate in
 question has changed within 3 years from the last test date.
 A list of pre-approved coarse aggregate and aggregate-cement/pozzolan blends is
 maintained by the Department and will determine the acceptability of concrete mix designs
 proposed for use.
 As per AASHTO T 303 (ASTM C 1260): Use of a particular coarse or fine aggregate will
 be allowed with no restrictions when the mortar bars made with this aggregate expand less than
 or equal to 0.10 percent at 30 days from casting. Use of a particular coarse or fine aggregate will
 be classified as potentially reactive when the mortar bars made with this aggregate expand
 greater than 0.10 percent at 30 days from casting. Use of this aggregate will only be allowed
 with the use of cement-pozzolan blends and/or chemical admixtures that result in mortar bar
 expansion of less than 0.10 percent at 30 days from casting.
 Acceptable pozzolans and chemical admixtures that may be used when an aggregate is
 classified as potentially reactive include the following:
 a. Class F Coal Fly Ash meeting the requirements of AASHTO M 295.
 b. Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (Grade 100 or 120) meeting the requirements
 of AASHTO M 302.
 c. Densified Silica Fume meeting the requirements of AASHTO M 307.
 d. Lithium Hydroxide Monohydrate (LiOH-H2O).
 Pozzolans or chemical admixtures required to offset the effects of potentially reactive
 aggregates will be incorporated into the concrete at no additional cost to the Department.
 Aggregates classified as potentially reactive by the requirements of this specification may be
 used if certified test results from an accredited independent laboratory utilizing the current
 AASHTO T 303 (ASTM C 1260) Accelerated Detection of Potentially Deleterious Expansion of
 Mortar Bars Due to Alkali-Silica Reaction, indicating an acceptable alkali-aggregate
 combination, are submitted to the Department.

 703.081 RAP for Asphalt Pavement Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP) may be introduced
 into hot-mix asphalt pavement at percentages approved by the Department according to the
 MaineDOT Policies and Procedures for HMA Sampling and Testing. If approved by the
 Department, the Contractor shall provide documentation stating the source, test results for
 average residual asphalt content, and stockpile gradations showing RAP materials have been
 sized to meet the maximum aggregate size requirements of each mix designation. The
 Department will obtain samples for verification and approval prior to its use.
 The maximum allowable percent of RAP shall be determined by the asphalt content, the percent
 passing the 0.075 mm sieve, and Coarse Micro-Deval loss values as tested by the Department.
 The numerical average of the percent passing the 0.075 mm sieve values will be used for the
 approval. The maximum percentage of RAP allowable shall be the lowest percentage as
 determined according to Table 4 below:

 For specification purposes, RAP will be categorized as follows:
 Class III – A maximum of 10.0 percent of Class III RAP may be used in any base,
 intermediate base, surface, or shim mixture. A maximum of 20.0 percent of Class III RAP
 may be used in hand-placed mixes for item 403.209.
 Class II – A maximum of 20.0 percent Class II RAP in any base, binder, surface, or shim
 course.
 Class I – A maximum of 20.0 percent Class I RAP may be used in any base, intermediate
 base, surface, or shim mixture without requiring a change to the specified asphalt binder. A
 maximum of 30.0 percent Class I RAP may be used in in any base or intermediate base
 mixture provided that a PG 58-28 asphalt binder is used. A maximum of 30.0 percent Class I
 RAP may be used in any surface or shim mixture provided that PG 58-34 or 52-34 asphalt
 binder is used. Mixtures exceeding 20.0 percent Class I RAP must be evaluated and approved
 by the Department.
 
 7-15
 
 The Contractor may use up to two different RAP sources in any one mix design. The total RAP
 percentage of the mix shall not exceed the maximum allowed for the highest classification RAP
 source used (i.e. if a Class I & Class III used, total RAP must not exceed 30.0%). The blended
 RAP material must meet all the requirements of the classification for which the RAP is entered
 (i.e. 10% Class III with 20% Class I, blend must meet Class I criteria). The Department may take
 belt cuts of the blended RAP to verify the material meets these requirements. If the Contractor
 elects to use more than one RAP source in a design, the Contractor shall provide an acceptable
 point of sampling blended RAP material from the feed belt.
 In the event that RAP source or properties change, the Contractor shall notify the Department of
 the change and submit new documentation stating the new source or properties a minimum of
 72 hours prior to the change to allow for obtaining new samples and approval.
 703.09 HMA Mixture Composition The coarse and fine aggregate shall meet the requirements of
 Section 703.07. The several aggregate fractions for mixtures shall be sized, graded, and combined
 in such proportions that the resulting composite blends, including RAP aggregate will meet the

 Woven Monofilament Erosion Control Geotextiles require Class 2 geotextile class
 designation. All other Erosion Control Geotextiles require Class 1 geotextile class designation.
 The Erosion Control Geotextile class selection is appropriate for conditions of equal or less
 severity than either of the following:
 a. Armor layer stone weights do not exceed 220 pounds, stone drop height is less than 3
 feet, and no aggregate bedding layer is required.
 b. Armor layer stone weighs more than 220 pounds, stone drop height is less than 3
 feet, and the geotextile is protected by a 6 inch thick aggregate bedding layer
 designed to be compatible with the armor layer. More severe applications require an
 assessment of geotextile survivability based on a field trial section and may require a
 geotextile of higher strength properties.
 The Resident may specify a Class 2 geotextile based on one or more of the following:
 a. The Resident has found Class 2 geotextiles to have sufficient survivability based on
 field performance of the geotextile.
 b. The Resident has found Class 2 geotextiles to have sufficient survivability based on
 laboratory testing and visual inspection of a geotextile sample removed from a field
 test section constructed under anticipated field conditions.
 c. Armor layer stone weighs less than 220 pounds, stone drop height is less than 3 feet,
 and the geotextile is protected by a 6 inch thick aggregate bedding layer designed to
 be compatible with the armor layer.
 d. Armor layer stone weights do not exceed 220 pounds and stone is placed with a zero
 drop height.

 Recommendations are for 6 to 12 inch initial lift thickness. For other initial lift thicknesses:
 12 to 18 inches: reduce survivability requirement one level;
 18 to 24 inches: reduce survivability requirement two levels;
 24 inches: reduce survivability requirement three levels.
 For special construction techniques such as prerutting, increase the geotextile survivability requirement one
 level. Placement of excessive initial cover material thickness may cause bearing failure of the soft subgrade.
