 extension amount, the unit price shall govern. The sum of the extension amounts will be the
 contract bid price.
 A pay item may be shown with a maximum allowable amount for the bid. The bidder shall
 enter an amount for the bid that is equal to or less than the maximum allowable amount. If the
 bid entered is greater than the maximum allowable amount the Department will adjust the bid
 price to the maximum allowable amount for that item and recalculate the total bid amount.
 14
 
 SECTION 102
 PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS
 A pay item may be shown with a minimum required amount for the bid. The bidder shall
 enter an amount for the bid that is equal to or greater than the minimum required amount. If the
 bid entered is less than the minimum required amount the Department will adjust the bid price to
 the minimum required amount for that item and recalculate the total bid amount.
 
 (c) Signing.
 The bidder's proposal must be signed with ink by the individual, by one or more members of
 the partnership, by one or more members or officers of each firm representing a joint venture, or
 by one or more officers of a corporation, or by an agent of the Contractor legally qualified and
 acceptable to the State. If the proposal is made by an individual, the individual’s name must be
 shown; by a partnership, the name of each partnership member must be shown; as a joint
 venture, the name of each member or officer of the firms represented by the joint venture must
 be shown; by a corporation, the name of the corporation and of its corporate officials must be

 Provider agrees that its digital signature constitutes an original signature.
 The proposal bid bond, if bid bond is tendered, shall be properly signed by the bidder and the
 surety.
 
 (d) Collusion.
 Bidders will be required to execute a collusion affidavit conforming to the requirements of
 the laws and regulations cited in Article 107.05. If prior to the award the low bidder fails to
 execute the collusion affidavit the bid will be rejected and the bid bond will be forfeited. If there
 is any reason for believing that collusion exists among the bidders, any or all proposals may be
 rejected, and those participating in such collusion may be barred from submitting bids on the
 same or other work with the Department until they have been reinstated as a qualified bidder.
 Only the affidavit form provided in the proposal will be acceptable.
 
 (e) Computer Bidding.
 The bidder shall use a bidding software program prescribed by the Department. It is the
 bidder's responsibility to gain access to computer equipment that will run the prescribed software
 program.
 The bidder may choose to download the computer file and any addenda from the
 Department’s website or the bidder may choose to utilize the Department’s approved Internet
 Bidding Service Provider to access the computer file and addenda. If the bidder chooses to
 download the computer file from the Department’s website and submit the bid using a digital
 storage medium, then the software program prescribed by the Department shall be used to
 prepare the bid and to print the official bid item sheets for submittal with the proposal form.
 If the bidder chooses to utilize internet bidding, the computer file is available at the
 Department’s approved Internet Bidding Service Provider’s website.
 The only entries permitted into the computer program when preparing the bid will be the
 unit or lump sum prices for itemsbid. The program will perform all extensions of the unit or lump
 sum prices, calculate the total bid, and print a complete set of bid item sheets including the total
 bid price and bid item signature sheet. Each bid item sheet will contain a check identification "ID"
 located in the bottom right corner of each bid item sheet corresponding to the check ID in the
 computer bid file.
 Bid item sheets generated from the computer program shall be printed on 8.5 X 11 inch
 {216 mm x 279 mm} paper.
 This set of bid item sheets, generated from the software program prescribed by the
 Department, along with a complete proposal package, will constitute the official bid. The
 computer generated bid item signature sheet and proposal shall be properly signed and delivered
 to the Department in accordance with Article 102.06(c), Signing, and Article 102.10, Delivery of
 Proposals.
 Onlybid item sheets printed from a software program prescribed by the Department will be
 accepted for the official bid. Failure to use and submit these bid item sheets will result in the bid
 being rejected. Bidders who choose to utilize internet bidding shall submit the bid as a computer
 file, including a digital signature, through the Department’s approved Internet Bidding Service
 Provider.
 All provisions of Subarticles (a) through (d) of this Article will apply to the preparation of bids
 that are submitted on computer program generated bid item sheets. Any necessary changes to
 15
 
 SECTION 102
 PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS
 entries on the computer program generated bid item sheets shall be made in accordance with
 Subarticle (b) of this Article.
 A digital storage medium containing the computer file downloaded from the Department’s
 website with the bidder’s prices shall be submitted with the proposal unless the bidder chooses to
 use the Department’s approved Internet Bidding Service Provider in which case the submittal of a
 digital storage medium is not required.
 In case of a discrepancy between the unit or lump sum prices submitted on the program
 printed bid item sheets and those contained in the computer file returned to the Department, the
 unit or lump sum prices submitted on the program printed bid item sheets shall prevail in all
 cases.
 Failure to submit a properly signed bid item signature sheet shall result in the bid being
 rejected.
 Failure to submit a bid item sheet(s), other than the bid item signature sheet, will result in
 the bid being considered irregular in accordance with Article 102.07(a). In the event a bid item
 sheet is missing from the proposal, the Department may replace this sheet with a copy produced
 from the computer file submitted with the proposal.
 The Department is not responsible for delay in completion of, or failure to timely submit, a
 bid due to an alleged website failure or failure of any service associated with the Department’s
 approved Internet Bidding Service Provider.
 
 102.07 Irregular Proposals.
 (a) General.
 Proposals will be considered irregular and may be rejected if they contain any omissions,
 alteration of form, additions not called for, incomplete bids (includes failure to enter a unit bid
 price on a bid item or, in the case of an alternate, the alternate being bid by the Contractor),
 interlineations, erasures or alterations not initialed by the person signing the proposal,
 inconsistent proposal control numbers on each computer bid item sheet and signature sheet, or
 other irregularities of any kind. Proposals may be rejected at any time prior to the execution of
 the contract by the Director.
 Any bidder using the same or different names for submitting more than one proposal upon any
 project will be disqualified from further consideration on that project. Evidence that any bidder is
 interested, as a principal, in more than one proposal for work contemplated (for example bidding
 in a partnership, as a joint partnership or association, and as a partnership, association, or
 individuals) will cause the rejection of any such proposal. A bidder, however, may submit a
 proposal as principal and as a Subcontractor to some other principal, or may submit a proposal as
 a Subcontractor to as many other principals as he desires, and by so doing will not be liable to
 disqualification in the intent of these Specifications.
 
 (b) Unbalanced Bidding.
 In order that no party of the contract will be financially hurt over changes in the estimated
 quantities, a proposal may be rejected if any of the unit prices are obviously unbalanced. The
 Department will decide whether any unit prices are unbalanced either excessively above or below
 a reasonable cost analysis value determined by the Engineer, particularly if these unbalanced
 amounts are substantial and contrary to the interest of the Department.
 
 102.08 Combination Bids.

 6. Contain a list of the project numbers included in the proposed combination bid.
 7. Unacceptable Combination Bids.
 A combination bid in which the bidder proposes that a lump sum be deducted from the
 final estimate is unacceptable. A combination bid in which the bidder proposes that a
 reduction in prices be made on a percentage basis is unacceptable. Unacceptable proposals
 for combination bids will be considered irregular by the Department and will be rejected.
 
 (b) City and County Financed Projects.
 Combination bids will not be accepted on any project or projects wholly or partially financed
 by a city unless all of the projects in the combination bid are city financed projects located in the
 same city.

 Bidders shall familiarize themselves with and shall comply with all Federal and State laws and
 local laws, ordinances, and regulations which may directly or indirectly affect the work or its
 prosecution, persons engaged in or employed on the work, and the equipment and tools used in
 the work. No adjustments or compensation will be allowed for losses caused by failure to comply
 with this requirement.
 1. Contractor’s Licensing for 100% State Funded Projects.
 Each bidder shall enter the General Contractors license number issued by the State
 Licensing Board on each submitted bid. Space is provided on the cover sheet of the proposal
 for the license number. Failure to enter the bidder’s license number on the bid submittal will
 result in the rejection of the bid.
 2. Contractor’s Licensing for Projects Funded with Federal Monies.
 Prior to being awarded a contract, bidders on projects that are partially or wholly
 funded with federal monies shall submit a copy of their license issued by the State Licensing
 Board for General Contractors. Bidders may satisfy this requirement by placing a copy of the
 license into the proposal of each submitted bid.
 3. Bidder’s Responsibility.

 Code, and amendments thereto to the date of the contract.
 
 (b) Labor Rates.
 Attention is called to the fact that the wage rates listed in the proposal are minimum
 required rates. Bidders therefore should investigate and determine the prevailing local wage rates
 which for certain classes may be higher than the listed minimum rates. Under no condition shall
 the Contractor pay less than the listed minimum rate but it may be necessary in some cases to pay
 more in order to secure the labor.
 18
 
 SECTION 103

 SECTION 103
 AWARD AND EXECUTION OF CONTRACT
 103.01 Consideration of Proposals.
 After the proposals are opened and read, they will be compared on the basis of the summation of
 the products of the approximate quantities shown in the bid schedule multiplied by the unit bid prices.
 The results of such comparisons will be available to the public. In the event of a discrepancy between
 unit bid prices and extensions, the unit bid price shall govern.
 The right is reserved to reject any or all proposals, to waive technicalities or to advertise for new
 proposals, if, in the judgment of the awarding authority, the best interest of the Department will be
 promoted thereby.
 A proposal will not be considered unless signed by the bidder or his authorized agent and
 accompanied by cashier’s check or properly signed bid bond as required by law.
 For the purposes of Section 103, if the final calendar day specified falls on a weekend or holiday,
 the next business day will be the final calendar day.
 
 103.02 Award of Contract.
 (a) General.
 The award of the contracts, if to be awarded, will be made within 30 calendar days after
 opening of proposals to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose proposals comply with
 the requirements of Section 102 and the invitation to bid (Notice to Contractors). Should no award
 be made within the 30 days, all proposals will be rejected unless the successful bidder agrees in
 writing to a stipulated extension in the time limit for award. The successful bidder will be notified
 by confirmed facsimile or letter mailed to the address shown on his proposal that his bid has been
 accepted and that he has been awarded the contract.
 After the opening of bids on work involving Federal funds, the award of the contract to the
 low bidder will be contingent upon said low bidder obtaining a license from the State Licensing
 Board for General Contractors in accordance with the existing State laws.
 
 (b) Bidder Low on More Than One Contract.
 Should any responsible bidder be low on more contracts or work than he is qualified to handle
 under his certificate of qualification issued by the Department, the State reserves the right to
 select from his submitted proposals those for award to him which are most advantageous to the
 State. His other submitted proposals will not be considered in making the awards.
 
 (c) Award Based on Bidder's Net Worth and Contracting Capacity.
 The award of the contract will be made in consideration of the bidder's net worth and the
 dollar value of the bidder's contracting capacity in accordance with the legal requirements for
 public work. The bidder's contracting capacity is indicated on the face of the bidder's
 Prequalification Certificate.
 The dollar value of the contracting capacity of a joint venture is the combined dollar value of
 the contracting capacity of each co-venturer.
 Prior to the award of a contract to a joint venture a letter shall be submitted to the
 Department by the joint venture in which is given an approximate percentage of the work that is
 assigned to each co-venturer. This letter shall be signed by the same individuals that signed the
 joint venture's bid proposal and shall be notarized. The approximate percentages of participation
 shall be rounded to the nearest 5 % with no co-venturer being assigned less than 20 % of the work.
 
 19
 
 SECTION 103
 AWARD AND EXECUTION OF CONTRACT
 After the award of a contract to a joint venture, the dollar value of outstanding work in that
 contract will be assigned at the designated percentages to each co-venturer in determining the
 remaining contracting capacity of each co-venturer.
 
 (d) Alabama Immigration Law
 By signing this contract, the contracting parties affirm, for the duration of the agreement,
 that they will not violate federal immigration law or knowingly employ an unauthorized alien

 provision shall be deemed in breach of the agreement and shall be responsible for all damages
 resulting therefrom.
 The Contractor shall submit a certificate of compliance form to the Department for each
 contract prior to award. This form must have an original signature, and the project will not be
 awarded without the form. The certificate of compliance form is available on ALDOT’s website
 (http://www.alletting.dot.state.al.us) and shall be furnished to the Alabama Department of
 Transportation by the apparent low bidder within ten (10) days of the letting at the following

 103.03 Cancellation of Award.
 The Director reserves the right to cancel the award of any contract at any time before the
 execution of the said contract by all parties, without any liability against the State. The Director may
 also reject the bid of the lowest bidder if any of the conditions for disqualification noted in Article
 102.02 are found to exist at any time prior to the execution of the contract by all parties. The Director
 may award the contract to the next lowest responsible bidder when it is determined to be in the best
 interest of the State.
 
 103.04 Return of Proposal Guaranties.
 All proposal guaranties, except those of the 3 lowest bona fide bidders, will be returned without
 undue delay after proposals have been checked, tabulated, and the relation to the proposals
 established. The proposal guaranty of the 3 lowest bona fide bidders will be returned as soon as the
 contract bonds and the contract of the successful bidder have been properly executed and approved.
 When the award is deferred for a period of time longer than 15 calendar days after the opening of the
 proposals, all proposal guaranties except those of the potentially successful bidders will be returned.
 Should no award be made, all guaranties will be returned. Should the successful bidder agree in writing
 to a stipulated extension in the time limit for award, the Director may, at his discretion, permit the
 successful bidder to substitute a satisfactory bidder's bond if a cashier’s check was submitted with his
 proposal as a proposal guarantee. The Director reserves the right to return all proposal guaranties by
 registered mail and his responsibility shall end upon the mailing thereof.
 
 103.05 Requirements of Contract Bonds.
 (a) Performance Bond.
 The bidder to whom the award is made shall, within 15 calendar days after the prescribed
 forms have been presented to him for signature (i.e. after date of award), furnish and file with
 the Transportation Director an acceptable surety bond on the form included in the proposal in an
 amount equal to 100 percent of the contract bid price of the contract as awarded. Said bond shall
 be furnished by a surety company qualified and authorized to make such bonds in the State of
 Alabama, and countersigned by an authorized agent resident in the State who is qualified to
 execute such instruments. The bond shall have attached thereto power of attorney of the signing
 official unless such power of attorney is already on file in the office of the Department. In case of
 default on the part of the Contractor, all expense incident to ascertaining and collecting losses
 suffered by the State under the bond, including engineering, direct administration, and legal
 services, shall be charged against the contract bond for performance of the work.
 
 (b) Labor, Materials, Services, Insurance, Feed Stuffs, or Supplies Bond.
 In addition thereto, the bidder to whom the award is made shall, within the same 15 calendar
 days, execute and file with the Director an acceptable surety bond payable to the State in an
 amount not less than 100 percent of the contract bid price, with the obligation that the
 20
 
 SECTION 103
 AWARD AND EXECUTION OF CONTRACT
 Contractor shall promptly make payment to all persons furnishing him or them with labor,
 materials, feed stuffs, services, insurance, bond, or supplies for or in the prosecution of the work,
 and for the payment of reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by successful claimants or plaintiffs in
 suits on said bond.
 
 (c) Continuous Bond Coverage.
 Surety bonds shall continue to be acceptable to the Director throughout the life of the
 contract. In event the surety executing the bonds, although acceptable to the Director at the time
 of execution of the contract, subsequently becomes insolvent, bankrupt, unreliable, or otherwise
 unsatisfactory due to any cause which becomes apparent after the Director's initial acceptance of
 the bonds, then the Director will require that the Contractor replace the bonds with like bonds
 drawn on a surety company which is acceptable to the Director. In such event, all costs of the
 premium for the new bonds will be borne by the Contractor.
 
 (d) Performance of Surety.
 The Department will not accept bonds from a surety that has failed to perform in accordance
 with the terms of any bond that the surety has submitted to the Department. Prospective bidders
 will be informed in the "Notice to Contractors" that a surety's bonds are unacceptable.
 
 103.06 Execution of Contract.
 The contract shall be executed by the bidder to whom award is made, on the form included in the
 proposal, and returned to the Director with satisfactory contract bonds within 15 calendar days after
 the prescribed forms have been presented to him for signature (i.e. after date of award). Should
 extenuating circumstances prevail, the Director may grant an extension in time not exceeding five
 calendar days for the return of the contract and bonds as provided herein and in Article 103.05.
 
 103.07 Approval of Contract.
 A period of 20 calendar days will be allowed for execution of the contract by the Director and
 approval of same by the Governor, after its presentation by the successful bidder, unless the successful
 bidder agrees in writing to a longer period. No contract is binding upon the State until it has been
 executed by the Director and approved by the Governor of the State. The date of the final execution of
 the contract shall be the date on which it is signed by the Governor.
 
 103.08 Failure to Execute Contract.
 If the successful bidder is awarded the contract and fails to execute the contract (including
 furnishing acceptable contract security) the bidder will be subjected to the following actions.
 The Director will obtain liquidated damages for the bidder's default. The amount of the damages
 will be the smaller of two possible amounts. The first possible amount is the total amount of the
 proposal guaranty. The second possible amount is the difference between the amount of the contract
 as awarded and the amount of the total bid of the next lowest responsible bidder. The damages will be
 recovered from the bidder's cashier's check guaranty or from the principal or the sureties if the
 guaranty is a bid bond.
 The Director will return the proposal guaranty intact to the estate of the deceased successful
 bidder in the event of the death of the successful bidder on the date of the opening of the bids or the
 death of the successful bidder during the following number of days allowed for the execution of the
 contract.
 The defaulted bidder will be prohibited from participating in any manner in the original contract,
 and will be prohibited from participating in any manner in any portion of that contract that may be
 removed and put into other contracts. These prohibitions shall apply to any other name under which
 the same person, affiliate, individual, partnership, company, firm, corporation, association,
 cooperative, or other legal entity may be operating in which the principal owners are involved. The
 prohibitions shall be:
 - Work will not be allowed as a subcontractor or in any other capacity or role on the project.
 - Bidding will not be allowed on the original contract if it is readvertised for letting.
 - Bidding will not be allowed on any subsequent contract which contains any portion of the
 original contract.

 SECTION 104
 SCOPE OF WORK
 
 SECTION 104
 SCOPE OF WORK
 104.01 Intent of Contract.
 The intent of the contract is to provide for the construction and completion of the work
 described. The Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, tools, transportation and
 supplies required to complete the work in accordance with the plans, specifications, and terms of the
 contract.
 When Item 680-A, Geometric Controls, is included on the plans and in the proposal, the Contractor
 shall also furnish all geometric controls (see Section 680).
 Special provisions covering any special conditions, materials, or construction not covered on the
 plans or in these specifications will be included in the bidders' proposals or in supplemental
 agreements.
 
 104.02 Alterations of Plans or Character of Work.
 (a) General.
 The Engineer reserves the right to make, in writing, at any time during the work, such
 changes in quantities and such alterations in the work as necessary to satisfactorily complete the
 project. Such changes in quantities and alterations shall not invalidate the contract nor release
 the surety, and the contractor agrees to perform the work as altered.
 If the alterations or changes in quantities significantly change the character of the work
 under the contract, whether such alterations or changes are in themselves significant changes to
 the character of the work or by affecting other work cause such other work to become
 significantly different in character, an adjustment, excluding anticipated profit, will be made to
 the contract. If the cost of the work does not change, then the adjustment will be zero. The basis
 for the adjustment shall be agreed upon prior to the performance of the work. If a basis cannot be
 agreed upon, then an adjustment will be made either for or against the contractor in such amount
 as the Engineer may determine to be fair and equitable.
 If the alterations or changes in quantities do not significantly change the character of the
 work to be performed under the contract, the altered work will be paid for as provided elsewhere
 in the contract.
 The term "significant change" shall be construed to apply only to the following circumstances:
 (1) When the character of the work as altered differs materially in kind or nature from that
 involved or included in the original proposed construction or
 (2) When a major item of work, as defined elsewhere in the contract, is increased in excess
 of 125 percent or decreased below 75 percent of the original contract quantity. Any
 allowance for an increase in quantity shall apply only to that portion in excess of 125
 percent of original contract item quantity, or in case of a decrease below 75 percent, to
 the actual amount of work performed. Changes in quantities for the items of Unclassified
 Excavation, Muck Excavation, Borrow Excavation, Pipe Underdrain, extra Concrete and
 Steel Reinforcement (for structure foundations), Piling, Bituminous Plant Mix leveling
 and widening material, and Bituminous Material used in plant mix bases and pavements,
 Disposal of Hydrocarbon Contaminated Soil, Underground Storage Tank (UST) Removal,
 and Removing and Disposing UST Contents shall be excluded in determining increases and
 decreases under the provisions of this paragraph, since it is understood that these items
 cannot be accurately determined before the work is done.
 No claims shall be made by the Contractor for any anticipated profits because of any such
 alteration, or by reason of any variation between the approximate quantities and the quantities of
 work as done.
 No allowance will be made on an item for which a fixed price is set in the proposal.
 Payment for work occasioned by changes or alterations will be made in accordance with the
 provisions set forth under Article 109.05. If the altered or added work is of sufficient magnitude as
 to require additional time in which to complete the project, such time adjustment may be made
 in accordance with the provisions of Article 108.09.
 
 22
 
 SECTION 104
 SCOPE OF WORK
 Under no circumstances shall alterations of plans or of the nature of the work involve work
 beyond the termini of the proposed construction except as may be necessary to satisfactorily
 complete the project.
 
 (b) Changed or Differing Site Conditions.
 During the progress of the work, if subsurface or latent physical conditions are encountered
 at the site differing materially from those indicated in the contract or if unknown physical
 conditions of an unusual nature, differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and
 generally recognized as inherent in the work provided for in the contract, are encountered at the
 site, the party discovering such conditions shall promptly notify the other party in writing of the
 specific differing conditions before they are disturbed and before the affected work is performed.
 Upon written notification, the Engineer will investigate the conditions, and if he determines
 that the conditions materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time
 required for the performance of any work under the contract, an adjustment, excluding
 anticipated profits, will be made and the contract modified in writing accordingly. The Engineer
 will notify the Contractor of his determination whether or not an adjustment of the contract is
 warranted.
 No contract adjustment which results in a benefit to the Contractor will be allowed unless the
 Contractor has provided the required written notice.
 The Contractor shall carry on the work promptly and diligently pending a decision.
 Any adjustment in compensation because of such change or changes will be made in
 accordance with the provisions of Article 109.05. Any adjustment in contract time because of such
 change or changes will be made in accordance with the provisions of Article 108.09.
 
 (c) Claims.
 If the Contractor does not agree with the Department’s decision concerning his request for
 extra compensation, he may file a claim following the procedures outlined in Section 110, Claims.
 
 104.03 Extra Work.
 (a) General.
 The Contractor, when so directed in writing, shall perform extra work for which there is no
 quantity or unit price in the contract and is deemed necessary or desirable in order to complete
 fully the work as contemplated. Such work shall be performed in accordance with the
 Specifications and as directed and will be paid for as provided under Subarticle 104.03(b). 
 
 (b) Supplemental Agreement or Force Account Order Required.
 Before any such extra work is started, a supplemental agreement shall be executed,
 describing the kind, location, and estimated quantities of the extra work to be done and
 specifying the unit prices or lump sum agreed upon, or a written order shall be issued for the
 work, stating that compensation will be on a force account basis. However, in an emergency, the
 Engineer may direct the immediate start of the extra work by letter containing this information.
 Such letter shall be superseded later by a supplemental agreement or force account order. If
 satisfactory unit prices or lump sum cannot be agreed upon, the Director may require that the
 extra work be performed on a force account basis as outlined in Subarticle 109.04(b) or he may
 direct that one or more of the items of the proposed extra work be omitted from consideration
 and performed by other agents.
 
 104.04 Maintenance of Traffic and Sequence of Construction.
 (a) General.
 1. Provision for Traffic.
 No highway or section of highway or bridge shall be closed to traffic and no construction
 operations that will for any reason render the roadway generally unsuitable for use of the
 traveling public shall be started until adequate provisions have been made to detour or
 by-pass the traffic in safety and comfort. Special reference is made to Article 107.07, "Public
 Convenience and Safety" and such is approved in writing by the Engineer.
 2. Pipelines and Public Utilities.
 The Contractor's attention is directed to the possible existence of pipe lines or other
 public utilities which may be buried within the limits of the work or adjacent thereto and
 which may or may not be shown on the plans. He shall be responsible for and shall take all
 23
 
 SECTION 104
 SCOPE OF WORK
 necessary precautions to protect and preserve any and all such existing drains, sewers, pipes,
 conduits, and other underground structures or parts thereof which may be affected by his
 operations on the work, and which, in the opinion of the Engineer, may be properly continued
 in use without any changes. He shall assume full responsibility for reimbursing the owners for
 any damage or injury to properties or interference with their service which may result from
 any of his operations or negligence during the period the contract is in force. Also, he shall be
 responsible for any damage to utilities above ground, regardless of their location, where such
 damage results from any of his operations or his negligence. Attention is directed to
 Subarticle 107.12(b).
 The Contractor shall repair, replace, relocate, extend, reconstruct or make any other
 change in any subsurface sewer or drain encountered in the prosecution of the work and
 unless otherwise provided in the contract, the cost of replacing or restoring or connecting any
 such sewer or drain substantially to its original location, when incidental to the construction
 shall be included in the contract unit prices for various pay items.
 3. Mail Delivery.
 Where mail delivery service is to be maintained during construction, mailboxes within
 the limits of operations shall be removed by the Contractor before work is begun and set
 temporarily where they will be accessible both to the mail carrier and the patron. As soon as
 the state of the work permits and the Engineer directs, all mailboxes shall be reset by the
 Contractor in permanent locations in compliance with U.S. Postal Service Regulations.
 Mailboxes or supports that have been damaged by the Contractor shall be replaced at his
 expense. The cost of removing and/or temporarily resetting mailboxes shall be included in
 the prices bid for the various pay items of work and no direct payment will be made for this
 work. Unless Item 209-A, Mailbox Reset, is included on the plans or in the proposal, no direct
 payment will be made for permanently resetting mailboxes.
 4. Lighting for Nightime Operations.
 When the Contractor performs any operations after daylight hours, he shall provide and
 maintain, at his expense, sufficient artificial lighting to permit proper construction and
 inspection.
 
 (b) Signs and Warning Lights.
 All signs, barricades, etc. used along the project shall be in accordance with the provisions of
 Part 6 of the MUTCD, the plan details and the following: Posts shall be appropriately sized for the
 sign of either timber (treated or painted) of not less than 4 inch by 4 inch {100 mm x 100 mm}
 (Nom.) cross section or metal (min. 2 lbs. {1 kg} "U" channel or equivalent) so spaced to rigidly
 support the sign.
 All signs, barricades, drums or other devices intended for use in controlling traffic shall be in
 accordance with the requirements of Part 6 of the MUTCD and the detailed plans, with
 reflectorization as noted therein. Reflectorization shall be accomplished using materials meeting
 the requirements of Article 880.02.
 All barricades, drums, signs and other devices shall be kept clean, legible, and in their proper
 position at all times. Damaged, defaced or dirty barricades, drums, signs and other devices shall
 be repaired or replaced immediately. The Engineer will insure compliance by periodic inspections
 and require replacements or repair as deemed necessary.
 In addition to the requirements of Article 107.10 where particular hazardous conditions exist
 or traffic volumes warrant, or where there is serious interference from extraneous light sources
 and a reflectorized sign is not likely to be effective, the Engineer may require any or all signs and
 barricades to be illuminated.
 Illumination of signs, barricades, etc. shall be accomplished by the use of 100 watt or
 greater, incandescent or equivalent fluorescent electric light bulbs, shielded to protect the driver
 from glare and so located that the sign shape and message is clearly visible to the driver. Street or
 highway lighting by itself is not regarded as meeting illumination requirements.
 
 (c) Sequence of Construction.
 Unless otherwise provided by plan details or special provisions included in the contract, the
 sequence of construction for the project shall be the Contractor's provided the following
 requirements are met to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 1. Provides for the orderly construction of the project within the time limit provided by the
 Contract.

 Provides for the preparation of any bridge sites as a first order of work.
 Provides for handling of traffic through the work in accordance with the details noted in
 Subarticle (d) of this Article.
 Provides for the working out of minor drainage problems and details of temporary or
 permanent access as they are encountered.
 Provides for the continuous prosecution of all paving work through the final wearing
 layer once planing (milling) operations, surface treatment operations, or paving
 operations have begun.
 
 (d) Handling of Traffic.
 Unless otherwise provided, the Contractor shall keep the road open to all traffic while
 performing the required improvements. The Contractor shall keep the portion of the project being
 used by public traffic, whether it be through or local traffic, in such condition that traffic will be
 adequately accommodated. He shall provide and maintain in a safe condition temporary
 approaches or crossings and intersections with trails, roads, streets, businesses, parking lots,
 residences, garages, and farms. Where so provided on the plans or approved by the Engineer, the
 Contractor may bypass traffic over an approved detour route.
 The Traffic Control Plan (TCP) has been developed by the Engineer in accordance with Part VI
 of the "Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices" (MUTCD). The Contractor shall furnish, erect,
 and maintain barricades, warning signs, delineators, flagmen, and pilot cars in accordance with
 the TCP. The TCP will be revised as directed by the Engineer if there is a need for traffic control
 that is not shown on the TCP.
 The need for maintaining the flow of traffic may cause the restriction of the movement and
 operation of the Contractor's construction equipment. Flagmen shall be furnished without
 additional compensation to direct traffic and protect the work as noted in Section 740.
 Construction adjacent to existing pavement will require the use of portable barricades,
 drums, signs, vertical sign panels, delineators, or other approved traffic control devices. Posts
 used for traffic control device supports shall be appropriately sized for the intended purpose and
 uniform in shape and color throughout the project.
 The above traffic control devices shall be supplemented as necessary with warning lights of
 the kind and type indicated by plan details, the proposal, or as directed by the Engineer. In
 addition, when deemed necessary by the Engineer, special warning lights shall be used on
 equipment working adjacent to traffic lanes to warn traffic. These special warning lights shall be
 either all purpose, 360°-2 sealed beams, revolving types of at least 8 inches {200 mm} in height,
 or electronic strobe beacons. These lights shall be amber or orange colored and mounted so as to
 be readily seen by traffic at a safe distance.
 
 104.05 Blank.
 104.06 Final Cleaning Up.
 Upon completion and before work will be finally accepted and final payment made, the Contractor
 shall perform the following work: (1) He shall clear and remove from the right of way and adjacent
 areas not owned by him, all falsework, equipment, surplus and discarded materials, temporary
 structures, rubbish, debris, and all other objectionable litter, and dispose of them in a satisfactory
 manner. (2) He shall not remove barricades, warning and direction signs, until directed by the
 Engineer. (3) He shall remove from the site of other operations such as pits, quarries, stream channels,
 structures sites, and storage yards, all weeds, portions of trees, discarded materials, machinery,
 temporary structures, and equipment and dispose of them in a satisfactory manner. Depositing such
 material on abutting property or adjacent to the right of way with or without the consent of the
 property owner, will not be accepted as satisfactory disposal. However, he may be allowed temporarily
 to store equipment, surplus material, usable forms, etc., in a neat manner on a well-kept site near the
 right of way. (4) He shall restore in an acceptable manner all property, public and private, damaged
 incident to the prosecution of the work, and shall leave the right of way and sites of structures in a
 neat and presentable condition satisfactory to the Engineer.
 
 104.07 Maintenance of Roads and Detours.
 (a) General.
 The Contractor shall maintain at his expense, except as explicitly outlined in this Article, all
 detours and haul roads, and all roads, streets, bridges, and intersections within the project limits.
 25
 
 SECTION 104
 SCOPE OF WORK
 This includes, but is not limited to, haul roads and detours constructed by the Contractor for his
 convenience. It also includes damage to the road, street, or structure caused by the Contractor's
 equipment.
 The Contractor shall regulate his loads as required by Article 105.12 and he and his surety
 shall be responsible for any specific damage that may result to the road, street, or structures from
 failure to observe regulations governing traffic thereon, or for negligence on his part.
 The Contractor shall perform required repairs without delay; otherwise, the State or County
 will perform the repairs and the cost thereof will be deducted from amounts due on the contract.
 The Contractor and his surety shall indemnify and hold harmless the State, the Director, and the
 Engineer for damages arising from the use of roads and streets in the performance of the contract.
 
 (b) Detours.
 Detours designed by the Engineer and constructed in an acceptable manner shall be
 maintained by the Contractor with payment made under the appropriate Pay Items or as Extra
 Work unless the State elects to perform the maintenance instead. Roads designated as detours by
 the plans or the Engineer shall be maintained as outlined in this paragraph.
 
 (c) Haul Roads.
 Unless the plans designate otherwise, the Contractor may use any State road as a haul road
 with the maintenance performed as specified in Subarticle 104.07(b) above as long as his loads are
 regulated as specified in Subarticle 104.07(a) above.
 Should the Contractor wish to use a county road or city street as a haul road, he shall meet
 with the local governing body, review the condition of the facility, and reach an agreement as to
 the maintenance thereof. No payment will be made for such maintenance or restoration thereof.
 
 (d) Roads and Bridges.
 Existing roads and bridges which have not been constructed or overlaid by the Contractor
 shall be maintained by the State unless the Contractor is directed to make repairs with payment
 to be made as specified in Subarticle 104.07(b).
 
 104.08 Value Engineering.
 (a) Purpose and Scope.
 Value Engineering (VE) applies to cost reduction proposals that are initiated, developed, and
 submitted in writing by the Contractor to the Department for modifying the plans, the
 specifications, or other contract requirements. This applies only to a proposed change which is
 identified as a Value Engineering proposal at the time it is submitted to the Department.
 VE proposals are those which would require a change in the contract and would result in a net
 savings over the contract cost without impairing essential functions and characteristics of the
 project, including but not limited to, service life, reliability, economy of operation, ease of
 maintenance, desired aesthetics, and safety.
 The intent of this provision is for the Department to share with the Contractor any cost
 savings generated on a project as a result of a proposal or proposals offered by the Contractor and
 approved by the Department. The purpose is to encourage the use of the Contractor's ingenuity
 and experience in arriving at alternate, lower cost construction methods than those reflected in
 the contract documents by the sharing of savings resulting therefrom. VE proposals based solely on
 deleted pay items will not be considered.
 Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the Department to consider or approve a VE
 proposal submitted hereunder; however, if a VE proposal is approved by the Department, the net
 savings resulting from the proposal will be shared by the Department and Contractor on a 50-50
 basis.
 
 (b) Submittal of Proposal.
 As a minimum, the following materials and information shall be submitted with each VE
 proposal, plus any additional information requested by the Department:
 1. A Statement that the proposal is being submitted as a Value Engineering proposal.
 2. A description of the difference between the existing contract requirements and the
 proposed change, and the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each, including
 considerations such as service life, economy of operations, ease of maintenance, desired
 appearance, and safety.

 SECTION 104
 SCOPE OF WORK
 A complete detailed cost analysis indicating the final estimate costs and quantities to be
 replaced by the proposal, the new costs and quantities generated by the proposal, and
 the cost effects of the proposed changes on operational, maintenance, and other
 considerations.
 Plans, specifications, and recommendations as to how the VE proposed changes are to be
 accomplished.
 A statement of the deadline for issuing a change order adopting the proposed change to
 obtain the maximum cost reduction during the remainder of the contract, noting any
 effect on the contract completion time or delivery schedule.
 A description of any previous use or testing of the proposal on another Department
 project, or elsewhere, and the conditions and results therewith. If the proposal was
 previously submitted on another Department project, indicate the date, project number,
 and the action taken by the Department.
 VE proposals may be submitted only by the prime Contractor. Subcontractors may not
 submit a proposal except through the prime Contractor.
 Six complete copies of all submittal data included in a VE proposal shall be submitted to
 the Department's Project Manager. All copies of the proposal will be forwarded through
 the Area Office to the Construction Engineer for further handling.
 
 (c) Conditions for Consideration of Proposal.
 1.
 
 The Contractor is cautioned not to base any bid prices on the anticipated approval of a
 VE proposal and to recognize that a proposal may be considered but not approved. In the
 event of rejection of the proposal, the Contractor shall complete the contract in
 accordance with the plans and specifications at the contract prices bid.
 2. The Department will not be liable to the Contractor for failure to accept or act upon any
 VE proposal submitted nor for any delays to the work attributable to any such proposal.
 3. The Contractor shall absorb all costs incurred in preparing a VE proposal for submission
 to the Department including the cost of final plan revisions. The Department will bear
 the cost of reviewing and administering the VE proposal.
 4. Until a proposal is approved by supplemental agreement, the Contractor shall remain
 obligated to the terms and conditions of the existing contract.
 5. All VE proposals, whether approved or not approved by the Department for use on a
 referenced project, become the property of the Department, and shall contain no
 restrictions imposed by the Contractor on their use or disclosure. The Department shall
 have the right to use, duplicate, and disclose in whole or in part any data necessary for
 the utilization of the proposal. The Department retains the right to utilize any accepted
 proposal or part thereof on any other or subsequent projects without any obligation to
 the Contractor. This provision is not intended to deny rights provided by law with respect
 to patented materials or processes.
 6. The proposal shall not be experimental in nature but shall have been proven to the
 Department's satisfaction under similar or acceptable conditions on another project or
 location.
 7. Proposed changes in the basic design of a bridge or pavement type, or which require
 different right-of-way limits, will not normally be considered as an acceptable VE
 proposal. Items of work which are specifically excluded from Value Engineering by the
 plans will not be considered as a VE proposal.
 8. If a supplemental agreement has not been executed by the date upon which the
 Contractor's proposal specifies that a decision should be made, or such other date as the
 Contractor may subsequently have specified in writing, such proposal shall be deemed
 rejected.
 9. If additional information is needed to evaluate proposals, such information shall be
 provided in a timely manner. Failure to do so will result in rejection of the proposal.
 10. If a VE proposal is accepted in whole or in part, such acceptance will be by a contract
 supplemental agreement. The supplemental agreement will incorporate the necessary
 changes in the plans and specifications to permit the proposal, or any part of it
 accepted, to be put into effect. If there is to be an extension or reduction in contract
 time, the supplemental agreement will so note. If the approval of the Department is
 conditional, the supplemental agreement will specify the conditions.
 27
 
 SECTION 105
 CONTROL OF WORK
 11. The Department will be the sole judge as to whether a proposal qualifies for
 consideration and evaluation. It may reject any proposal that requires excessive time or
 costs for review, evaluation, and/or investigations, or which is not consistent with the
 Department's design policies and basic design criteria for the project.
 
 (d) Value Engineering Payment.
 If a VE proposal is approved by the Department, the changes and payment therefore will be
 authorized by a supplemental agreement. Reimbursement to the Contractor will be made as
 follows:
 1. The changes shown on the VE proposal will be incorporated into the contract through
 plan revisions, changes in the quantities of unit bid items, newly agreed price items or
 by force account, as appropriate, in accordance with the specifications.
 2. The cost of the revised work will be paid for directly as determined from the above
 mentioned changes. In addition to such payment, the Department will pay to the
 Contractor, by a separate Lump Sum Item, an amount equal to one-half of the savings as
 reflected by the difference between the cost of the original contract work and the cost
 of the work performed under the approved VE proposal. Payments will be made on
 monthly estimates based on the estimated savings generated by the approved VE
 proposal. The amount to be paid on these estimates will be a percentage of the total
 estimated savings in proportion to the amount of the VE proposal work performed during
 that month. Upon completion of all work included in the VE proposal, the final total
 savings will be determined by comparing the cost of the work based on the original
 contract quantities and the cost of the actual VE work performed. The final payment for
 work performed under the VE proposal will make any necessary corrections in previous
 payments to reflect a total payment of 50% of the generated savings to the Contractor.
 3. The Contractor's costs for development, design, and implementation of the VE proposal
 are not eligible for reimbursement.
 4. The Contractor may submit VE proposals for an approved subcontractor but, if the
 proposal is approved, the reimbursement will be made by the Department to the
 Contractor.
 5. Payment will be made under item number:
 104-A Value Engineering Proposal No. ______ - per lump sum

 29
 
 SECTION 105
 CONTROL OF WORK
 If the review is not completed within the number of days allowed, and the delay is not
 the fault of the Contractor, the delay will be considered for an extension of contract time.
 6. Approval.
 The approval of drawings will not release the Contractor from being solely and fully
 responsible for the accuracy of the drawings. Extra work that may result from errors in the
 shop drawings shall be done without additional compensation.
 7. Beginning Fabrication upon Approval.
 Fabrication shall not begin until the drawings have been approved. There will be no
 compensation for, or acceptance of structural members and components that are fabricated
 prior to approval of the drawings.
 
 (c) Working Drawings.
 1. Preparation of Drawings.
 The Contractor shall prepare and submit working drawings to supplement the plans.
 Working drawings shall be prepared to provide a complete illustration of the construction
 methods and materials proposed for use by the Contractor. Design calculations shall be
 submitted with the drawings. The signature, seal, and date of signature shall be placed on all
 details and design calculations by a Professional Engineer that is licensed in the State of
 Alabama and not employed by the ALDOT.
 Working drawings and design calculations shall be submitted for:
 1. Cofferdams, sheeting and shoring near a railroad track;
 2. Cofferdams where "cofferdam and pumping" is required;
 3. Structural steel girder erection plans for continuous span bridges;

 Working drawings and design calculations shall be submitted for any other construction
 process where noted on the plans or shown to be required in these specifications.
 The Contractor shall be fully responsible for all of the costs of unacceptable construction
 work whether or not working drawings are submitted for the construction procedures and
 temporary materials that affect the quality of construction.
 2. Submittal.
 Six copies of working drawings and design calculations shall be submitted by the
 Contractor to the Construction Engineer. The drawings and calculations shall be submitted
 well in advance of the point in time when the work will be performed.
 Working drawings for work on or over the railroad right-of-way must have the approval of
 the railroad company before the work will be allowed to begin. The Contractor shall submit
 four extra sets of drawings and design calculations for use by the Construction Engineer in
 obtaining a review by the railroad company. The Contractor shall make the submittal far
 enough in advance of the need for the work to begin so that the railroad company will have
 ample time to review the drawings and design calculations.
 Working drawings and design calculations that have been submitted and distributed to
 ALDOT construction personnel by the Construction Engineer may be resubmitted for another
 project provided all requirements are identical in nature to the previous project. The
 resubmittal of working drawings and calculations shall be signed, sealed and dated again by
 the Professional Engineer that originally sealed the drawings. The Professional Engineer shall
 clearly indicate on the drawings and calculations that the resubmittal is applicable to the
 new work.
 3. Distribution.
 The drawings and design calculations will be checked for completeness. The drawings
 will be distributed to ALDOT construction personnel for inspection of the work. The
 30
 
 SECTION 105
 CONTROL OF WORK
 distribution of the drawings will not release the Contractor and the Professional Engineer
 from being solely and fully responsible for the accuracy and adequacy of the drawings. Extra
 work that may result from errors in the working drawings and design calculations shall be
 done without additional compensation.
 4. Beginning Work shown on Working Drawings.
 Construction shall not be performed on any item of work for which Working Drawings are
 required until the Engineer receives the drawings for inspection of the work. There will be no
 compensation for work that is performed prior to the point in time that ALDOT personnel
 have the drawings for use in inspecting the construction work.
 
 (d) Compensation for Drawings.
 There will be no direct payment for the preparation and submittal of shop drawings, working
 drawings and design calculations. The cost of the drawings and calculations shall be included in
 the contract unit prices for the items of work.
 
 105.03 Conformity with Plans and Specifications.
 All work performed and all materials furnished shall be in reasonably close conformity with the
 lines, grades, cross sections, dimensions and material requirements, including tolerances shown on the
 plans or indicated in the Specifications.
 In the event the Engineer finds the materials furnished, work performed, or the finished product
 not within reasonably close conformity with the plans and Specifications but that reasonably
 acceptable work has been produced, he shall then make a determination if the work shall be accepted
 and remain in place. In this event, the Engineer will document the basis of acceptance by contract
 modification which will provide for an appropriate adjustment in the contract price for such work or
 materials as he deems necessary to conform to his determination based on engineering judgement.
 Where definite tolerances are specified in the contract, such tolerances shall fix the limits of
 reasonably close conformity. Where tolerances are not specified in the contract, the Engineer will
 determine the limits of reasonably close conformity in each individual case and his decision shall be
 final and conclusive and mutually accepted by all parties.
 In the event the Engineer finds the materials furnished, work performed, or the finished product
 are not within reasonably close conformity with the plans and Specifications, the work shall be
 removed and replaced or otherwise satisfactorily corrected by and at the expense of the Contractor.
 
 105.04 Coordination of Plans, Specifications, and Special Provisions.
 (a) General.
 These specifications, the supplemental specifications, the plans, special provisions and all
 supplementary documents are essential parts of the contract, and a requirement occurring in one
 is as binding as though occurring in all. They are intended to be complimentary and to describe
 and provide for a complete work. In case of discrepancy, calculated dimensions, unless obviously
 incorrect, shall govern over scaled dimensions. Supplemental Specifications shall govern over the
 Standard Specifications. Plans shall govern over Standard Specifications and Supplemental
 Specifications. Special Provisions shall govern over Standard Specifications, Supplemental
 Specifications, and Plans.
 
 (b) Errors.
 The Contractor shall not take advantage of any apparent error or omission in the plans or
 specifications. In the event the Contractor discovers such an error or omission, he shall
 immediately notify the Engineer. The Engineer will then make such corrections and interpretations
 as may be deemed necessary for fulfilling the intent of the plans and specifications.
 
 105.05 Cooperation with Utilities and Non-Highway Public Facilities.
 It will be the State's duty to notify in writing all utility owners or other parties affected, of the
 date they may begin adjustments of their facilities. The State will endeavor to have all necessary
 adjustments of public or private utilities, or other appurtenances within or adjacent to construction
 limits, made as soon as practicable. The owners or operators of private or public utilities shall have
 access to the work for the installation, adjustment, or repair of main line and service facilities. All
 frames of openings for valves, manholes, catch basins, or other fixtures encountered in areas to be
 covered by a pavement, shall be adjusted to the proper elevation before the pavement is placed. The
 Contractor shall coordinate his activities with those of utility owners while utility adjustments are
 being made. Copies of utility agreements will be made available for the Contractor's inspection at the
 31
 
 SECTION 105
 CONTROL OF WORK
 Alabama Department of Transportation Area offices. The Contractor shall investigate conditions of
 existing utilities prior to submitting his bid for the purpose of coordinating the work to the greatest
 extent possible.
 The Contractor's attention is directed to any utilities that may be involved on this project and are
 designated in the Plan Assembly. In any event, it shall be the Contractor's responsibility to determine
 the exact location of all existing utilities, whether shown on the Plans or not. The relocation and/or
 adjustments of said utilities have been authorized and utility facilities have been cleared or adjusted;
 however, should additional points of conflict occur, they will, of necessity, be performed during the
 construction operation. Cooperation between the Contractor and the Utility Companies shall be
 expected in accordance with this Article.
 Any existing underground utilities, whether indicated on the plans or not, that have been
 abandoned by the Utility Companies within the limits of construction that require removing shall be
 removed by the Contractor. Any material removed in this manner shall become the property of the
 Contractor. Disposal of said material shall be at his discretion outside of the right-of-way limits. Cost of
 such work shall be paid for under applicable contract items of work or as Extra Work as outlined in
 Article 104.03.
 
 105.06 Cooperation by the Contractor.
 (a) General.
 The Contractor will be supplied with a minimum of two sets of approved plans and contract
 assemblies (except Standard Specifications) including Special Provisions. The Contractor shall
 purchase any required Standard Specifications from the Department.

 between sections of their work beyond each end of a structure.
 
 105.08 Construction Stakes, Lines, and Grades.
 (a) For Projects Containing Item 680-A, Geometric Controls, the Following Shall
 Apply:
 The furnishing of construction stakes, lines, and grades shall be as outlined in Section 680.
 
 (b) For Projects Not Containing Item 680-A, Geometric Controls, the Following Shall
 Apply:
 1. Determination of Lines and Grades.
 The Engineer will set construction stakes for the Contractor establishing all the lines,
 grades, and measurements necessary for the proper prosecution of the work. The location,
 alignment. and elevation of all parts of the work will be established by the Engineer, but the
 Contractor shall assume full responsibility for construction to the alignment, elevations, and
 dimensions as indicated by the stakes and/or plans. These stakes and marks shall constitute
 the field control by and in accordance with which the Contractor shall govern and execute
 the work. For all work, the Engineer will furnish the Contractor all lines, elevations, and
 bench marks needed to lay out the work correctly. No work shall be done without lines and
 grades having been given by the Engineer.
 For control of elevations of base and pavement layers, the Contractor will be furnished
 one set of control elevation stakes. These stakes will be set on grade at intervals of not more
 than 50 feet {20 meters} along and near each side of each roadbed, and at other points as
 needed for accurate grade control. It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to obtain from
 this one set of control stakes the proper elevations for each layer of subbase, base, and
 pavement.
 2. Contractor's Responsibility for Stakes.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for the preservation of all stakes and marks. If in the
 opinion of the Engineer, any of the construction survey stakes or marks have been carelessly
 destroyed or disturbed by the Contractor, the cost to the State of replacing them will be
 charged against him, and will be deducted from the payment for the work.
 3. Furnishing Stakes, Templates, etc.
 The Contractor shall furnish free of charge, all stakes, templates, and other materials
 necessary for marking and maintaining points and lines given, and shall furnish the Engineer
 such incidental labor as he may require in establishing points and lines necessary to the

 SECTION 105
 CONTROL OF WORK
 
 (b) Duties of the Inspector.
 Inspectors will be authorized to inspect all work done and materials furnished. Such
 inspection may extend to all or any part of the work and to the preparation, fabrication or
 manufacture of the materials to be used. The inspector will not be authorized to alter or waive
 the provisions of the contract. The inspector will not be authorized to issue instructions contrary
 to the plans and specifications, or to act as foreman for the Contractor; however, he shall have
 the authority to reject work or materials until any questions at issue can be referred to and
 decided by the Engineer.
 
 105.10 Inspection of Work.
 (a) Access to the Work for Inspection by the Engineer.
 All materials and each part or detail of the work shall be subject to inspection by the
 Engineer. The Engineer shall be allowed access to all parts of the work and shall be furnished with
 such information and assistance by the Contractor as is required to make a complete and detailed
 inspection.
 If the Engineer requests it, the Contractor, at any time before acceptance of work, shall
 remove or uncover such portions of the finished work as may be directed. After examination, the
 Contractor shall restore said portions of the work to the standard required by the specifications.
 Should the work thus exposed or examined prove acceptable, the uncovering, or removing, and
 replacing of the covering or making good of the parts removed will be paid for as extra work; but
 should the work so exposed or examined prove unacceptable, the uncovering, or removing, and
 the replacing of the covering or making good the parts removed, will be at the Contractor's
 expense.
 When any unit of government, political subdivision, utility company, or railroad corporation is
 to pay a portion of the cost of the work covered by this contract, its respective representatives
 shall have the right to inspect the work. Such inspection shall in no sense make any unit of
 government, political subdivision, utility company, or railroad corporation a party to this contract,
 and shall in no way interfere with the rights of all parties.
 
 (b) Failure of the Engineer to Discover and Reject Defective Materials and Work.
 The Contractor shall bear the costs of replacing defective materials and work including the
 occurrence of the Engineer failing to promptly discover and reject defective materials and work.
 
 105.11 Removal of Unacceptable and Unauthorized Work.
 All work which does not conform to the requirements of the contract will be considered as
 unacceptable work.
 Unacceptable work, whether the result of poor workmanship, use of defective materials, damage
 through carelessness or due to any other cause, shall be removed immediately and replaced in an
 acceptable manner.
 Work done contrary to the instructions of the Engineer, work done beyond the lines shown on the
 plans, work performed without sublet approval by the Engineer if the work is performed by forces
 other than the Contractor's forces, or any extra work done without authority will be considered as
 unauthorized. If the quality of the unauthorized work is acceptable to the Engineer, the work may be
 left in place without payment. If the quality of the unauthorized work is unacceptable, the work shall
 be removed and replaced.
 Upon failure on the part of the Contractor to comply forthwith with any order of the Engineer
 made under the provisions of this Article, the Engineer will have authority to cause unacceptable work
 to be remedied or removed and replaced and unauthorized work to be removed and to deduct the costs
 from any monies due or to become due the Contractor. Continued failure on the part of the Contractor
 to comply shall be considered sufficient cause for the Director to declare the contract in default and to
 proceed to have the work completed in accordance with Article 108.12.
 
 105.12 Oversize/Overweight Vehicle Permit and Load Restrictions.
 (a) Oversize/Overweight Vehicle Permit.
 An Oversize/Overweight Vehicle Permit may be required for moving oversized and overweight
 loads. The Vehicle Permit Office of the ALDOT should be contacted to obtain information
 concerning the special requirements (such as police escorts) for moving these loads.
 
 34
 
 SECTION 105
 CONTROL OF WORK
 
 (b) Load Restrictions.
 The Contractor shall comply with all legal load restrictions in the hauling of materials on
 public roads beyond the limits of the project. In the hauling of materials on city streets or county
 roads, it shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to regulate his loads so that damage does not
 occur, regardless of the legal or posted load limit. Maintenance of public roads shall be as outlined
 in Article 104.07. A special permit will not relieve the Contractor of liability for damage which
 may result from the moving of material or equipment.
 Within the project limits, loads shall be so regulated that damage will not occur to base or
 pavement layers and structures, but in no case shall loads exceed the legal load limit unless
 permitted in writing by the Engineer under special conditions. No loads will be permitted on base,
 pavement or structures before the expiration of any required curing period. The Contractor shall
 be responsible for all damage by his hauling and other construction equipment within the project
 limits.
 Gross weight {mass} tickets for loads delivered to the project will be verified by the Engineer
 that all loads incorporated in the project are within the legal load limit. Required information for
 verification will be secured at the time of delivery; however, verification of weights {masses} may
 be made at any time during the course of the project. Loads over the legal load limit and which
 have been incorporated in the project by the Contractor will not be paid for as outlined in the last
 paragraph of this Article.
 On loads of materials not accompanied by a gross weight {mass} ticket, the Contractor shall
 furnish, upon request of the Engineer, the tare weight {mass} of any truck delivering such
 materials to the project. These truck tare weights {masses}, along with appropriate volumes and
 conversion factors, will be used by the Engineer in determining approximate quantities of
 materials which may be hauled to the project and still remain within the legal load limit. At such
 times as the Engineer feels that the legal load limit is being exceeded, he will order the
 Contractor to verify the weight {mass} of designated loads at an approved truck scale. Loads over
 the legal load limit which are incorporated into the project by the Contractor will not be paid for
 as outlined in the last paragraph in this Article.
 No payment will be made for any materials placed in the project for which the delivered
 gross weight {mass} exceeds the legal load limit. No payment will include the total amount of the
 delivered load at the full contract unit price for the item of work under which the material is
 used.
 
 105.13 Maintenance of the Work.
 (a) General.
 The Contractor shall maintain the work during construction until the entire project is
 completed and accepted. This maintenance shall constitute continuous and effective work
 prosecuted day by day, with adequate equipment and forces to the end that the roadway or
 structures are kept in satisfactory condition at all times.
 In the case of a contract for the placing of a course upon a course or subgrade previously
 constructed, the Contractor shall maintain the previous course or subgrade during all construction
 operations.
 The Contractor's attention is directed to Article 104.07 for maintenance of roads and detours,
 and compensation thereof.
 
 (b) Compensation.
 All cost of maintenance work during construction and before the project is accepted shall be
 included in the unit prices bid on the various pay items and the Contractor will not be paid an
 additional amount for such work.
 
 105.14 Failure to Maintain Work.
 If the Contractor, at any time, fails to comply with the provisions of Article 105.13, the Engineer
 will immediately notify the Contractor of such non-compliance. If the Contractor fails to remedy
 unsatisfactory maintenance within 24 hours after receipt of such notice, the Engineer may immediately
 proceed to maintain the project, and the entire cost of this maintenance will be deducted from monies
 due or to become due the Contractor on his contract.

 105.15 Acceptance.
 (a) Construction Acceptance Inspection.
 Whenever the Engineer considers the work provided for and contemplated by the contract is
 nearing completion, or within two weeks of written notice of presumptive completion of the
 entire project by the Contractor, the Area Operations Engineer and all pertinent personnel (such
 as Area construction, project, county transportation, and maintenance personnel, FHWA, county,
 municipal or other owner representatives as applicable) will inspect all the work in the contract.
 The Contractor should not presume completion of the entire project until permanent vegetation is
 established. If the Area Operations Engineer finds that the work has not been satisfactorily
 completed at the time of such inspection, the Contractor will be advised in writing as to the work
 to be done or the particular defects to be remedied to place the work in condition for acceptance
 for maintenance purposes. The Contractor will have a maximum of four weeks to correct and
 complete the items listed. Time charges should resume if the work is not completed in the four
 weeks.
 
 (b) Partial Acceptance for Maintenance.
 When requested by the Contractor in writing, the Engineer may consider accepting a portion
 of the contract for maintenance prior to all items of work being completed. This will apply to
 specific items or operations of being restricted by seasonal limitations or check periods in
 accordance with 108.07c or 108.09 or work as directed by the Engineer. All other contract items
 of work shall be satisfactorily complete.
 The Engineer will notify the contractor that they will assume maintenance of specific items or
 operations of work and will also indicate which items are not accepted. The partial acceptance
 letter to the contractor should also detail the disposition of time charges for the remaining work.
 Additional costs for completing the remaining items of work as a consequence of a partial
 acceptance such as traffic control and remobilization shall be borne by the Contractor. Partial
 acceptance shall in no way void or alter any terms of the contract.
 Once the remaining items of work have been satisfactorily completed, the Engineer will
 accept the portion of work and assume maintenance of the project henceforth.
 
 (c) Final Acceptance.
 1. General.
 Upon due notice from the Contractor of presumptive completion of the remaining items
 of work in Subarticles (a) and (b) above, the Area Operations Engineer and all pertinent
 personnel will make an inspection. If all construction provided for and contemplated by the
 contract is satisfactorily completed, that inspection shall constitute the final inspection.
 2. Vegetation Bonds.
 When directed by the Engineer, the Contractor shall provide a vegetation bond covering
 sustained growth of established or planted vegetation. The bond shall be of sufficient value
 to cover all costs associated with the replanting or reestablishment of the vegetation should
 it become necessary. The dollar amount of the bond shall be the costs for the labor,
 materials and equipment required for traffic control, temporary erosion and sediment
 control, and permanent vegetation establishment. The period of time covered by the bond
 will not be required to be greater than 12 months unless shown otherwise on the plans.
 Vegetation bonds should not be used as a substitute for established vegetation of a
 permanent species.
 3. Acceptance for Maintenance.
 Upon satisfactory completion of the work as noted in Item 105.15(c)1 above, the Area
 Operations Engineer will notify the Construction Engineer that the Contractor has completed
 all work required by the contract. After the Construction Engineer has concurred with the
 Area Operations Engineer’s recommendation, the Construction Engineer will advise the
 Contractor in writing that the work has been accepted and the Department will assume the
 maintenance thereof subject to the "record check" of materials and workmanship.
 4. NPDES Termination
 Within 10 days of Acceptance for Maintenance, the Engineer will request NPDES Permit
 Termination as outlined in Subarticle 107.21(e). The Contractor shall be responsible for

 erosion and offsite sedimentation deposition during this time.
 5. Contractor's Advertisement of Completion.
 The Contractor, immediately after receiving Notice of Acceptance for Maintenance, shall
 give notice of said completion by an advertisement for a period of four successive weeks in
 some newspaper in general circulation published within the county in which the project is
 located. If the project is located in more than one county, an advertisement shall be given in
 a newspaper of general circulation published within each county in which the project is
 located. Proof of publication of said notice shall be made by the Contractor to the Director,
 by affidavit of the publisher. If a newspaper is not published in a county where work is done,
 the notice may be given by posting at the Court House for 30 days and proof of same shall be
 made by the Probate Judge or Sheriff and the Contractor.
 6. Written Notice of Final Acceptance.
 After completion of all requirements noted in this Article and Article 109.12, the
 Engineer will process the Final Estimate for payment. At this time, the Construction Engineer
 will give the Contractor written notice that the project is completed, and will specify that
 date as Final Acceptance.

 (a) General.
 Attention is directed to Section 800, Materials, which includes additional Specifications for
 materials.
 The materials furnished for use in the work shall be new unused materials, unless otherwise
 specified, meeting all quality requirements of the contract. In order to expedite the inspection
 and testing of materials, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer of his proposed sources of
 materials prior to delivery. At the option of the Engineer, materials may be approved at the
 source of supply before delivery is started. If it is found after trial that sources of supply for
 previously approved materials do not produce uniform and satisfactory products, or, if the product
 from any source proves unacceptable at any time, the Contractor shall furnish acceptable
 materials from other approved sources. The Engineer shall have the right to reject the entire
 output of any source from which he finds it is impracticable to secure a continuous flow of
 uniformly satisfactory materials.
 1. Federal Participating Projects.
 a. Steel and Iron Products.
 Steel/iron materials from the initial melting and mixing of these materials and all
 manufacturing processes including the stage of applying a coating to these materials
 (epoxy coating, galvanizing, painting, or any other coating that protects or enhances the
 value of the coated material) that are permanently incorporated into the completed
 project shall be produced domestically (in the United States, its territories, or
 possessions). If any part of the project (defined by and including the NEPA document) is
 funded by Federal-aid, then the entire project must meet the Buy America provisions,
 including utility relocation reimbursements for Federal-aid funds authorized after
 October 1, 2012.
 If the dollar amount of the foreign source steel/iron is less than $2,500 or 0.1% of
 the contract amount, whichever is greater, the foreign source steel/iron can be used in
 the project.
 The Contractor shall provide certification that the steel/iron is domestically
 produced.
 b. Convict Produced Materials.

 SECTION 106
 CONTROL OF MATERIALS
 Materials produced after July 1, 1991, by convict labor are prohibited from being
 incorporated in the work unless such materials have been:
 • Produced by convicts who are on parole, supervised release, or probation
 from a prison or
 • Produced in a qualified prison facility and the cumulative annual production
 amount of such materials for use in Federal-aid highway construction does
 not exceed the amount of such materials produced in such facility for use in
 Federal-aid highway construction during the 12-month period ending July 1,
 1987. "Qualified prison facility" means any prison facility in which convicts,
 during the 12-month period ending July 1, 1987, produced materials for use
 in Federal-aid highway construction projects.
 c. Cargo Preference Act.
 Materials or equipment that are acquired solely for a Federal-aid project must
 comply with the requirements of 46 CFR 381. Clauses 46 CFR 381.7(a)-(b) are hereby
 incorporated into these Specifications by reference.
 2. Non-Federal Participating Projects.
 On projects financed entirely by the State of Alabama or any political subdivision
 thereof, the Alabama Legislature has passed Acts that require the exclusive use of American
 materials, products, and supplies as follows:
 a. Steel Products.
 The content of Alabama Code Section 39-3-4 is as follows: "(a) Any contractor for a
 public works project, financed entirely by the State of Alabama or any political
 subdivision thereof, within this state shall use steel produced within the United States
 when specifications in the construction contract require the use of steel and do not limit
 its supply to a sole source under subsection (f) of Section 39-2-2. If the awarding
 authority decides that the procurement of the above mentioned domestic steel products
 becomes impractical as a result of a national emergency, national strike, or other cause,
 the awarding authority shall waive the above restriction. (b) In the event the contractor
 violates the domestic steel requirements of subsection (a), and domestic steel is not
 used, there shall be a downward adjustment in the contract price equal to any realized
 savings or benefits to the contractor."
 b. Non-Steel Materials, Supplies and Products.
 The content of Alabama Code Section 39-3-1 is as follows: "(a) The awarding
 authority contracting for a public works project to be financed entirely by the State of
 Alabama or any political subdivision of the state, shall stipulate or cause to be stipulated
 in the contract a provision whereby the person, firm, or corporation undertaking the
 project agrees to use in the execution of the contract materials, supplies, and products
 manufactured, mined, processed, or otherwise produced in the United States or its
 territories, if the same are available at reasonable and competitive prices and are not
 contrary to any sole source specification implemented under subsection (f) of Section 392-2. (b) In the event the contractor breaches the agreement to use domestic products,
 and domestic products are not used, there shall be a downward adjustment in the
 contract price equal to any realized savings or benefits to the contractor."
 c. Sole Source Reference [Alabama Code Subsection 39-2-2(f)].
 In the rare case that a sole source material is required from a non-domestic source
 the Department will make the determination of what the Contractor will be required to
 furnish.
 
 (b) Clearances and Acknowledgments for the Use of Offsite Areas.
 1. Types of Regulatory Clearances and Acknowledments.
 The regulatory clearances and acknowledgements shown in the following table are
 required for material pits, waste areas, haul roads, material stockpiles, long term equipment
 parking areas and other offsite areas selected by the Contractor to utilize in the construction

 2. Submittal of Copies of Regulatory Clearances and Acknowledgments.
 The Contractor shall submit copies of clearances and acknowledgements as verification
 that regulatory authorities are aware of the offsite activity and that the activity will not
 adversely impact natural resources.
 Clearances and acknowledgements will not be required for offsite areas used for short
 term parking, staging or material stockpiling where the activity does not require clearing or
 grading. Only a copy of applicable ADEM permitting will be required for offsite areas
 commercially owned and operated by a third party that is not an ALDOT contractor or
 subcontractor.
 
 (c) Operation of Offsite Pits and Waste Areas.
 The operations of any material pit or waste area shall be so conducted that it will blend into
 the surrounding landscape. Pit sites and waste areas shall be dressed to obliterate any unsightly
 appearance and treated in such a manner that erosion will not occur and result in the pollution of
 the watershed area. In general, sources will not be permitted at locations where resulting scars
 are visible from any highway. However, when approved, adequate space for conservation of
 existing natural screenings or to permit the installation of screen planting between the road
 surface and the disturbed area shall be provided.
 The Contractor shall accept full responsibility for the quality of the materials used. The
 Contractor shall make all necessary arrangements with the owners of the materials; pay the
 purchase price or royalty directly to the owners and bear all the expense of procuring and
 delivering the materials complete in place, including cost of ingress and egress, and including the
 cost of opening, developing, and operating such sources.
 If the Contractor submits a written request to the Department asking that the Department
 run samples or analyses on the materials, the Department may, at its option, run such samples or
 analyses, but a charge will be made for the tests and the cost deducted from the next monthly
 estimate due the Contractor.
 Where access to a material source or waste area requires removal of fencing, the removal
 and replacement of fence, together with the protection of any livestock affected, shall be the
 responsibility of the Contractor without direct compensation.
 Use of existing public roads for hauling materials to be used in the work shall be governed by
 Article 104.07.
 
 (d) Blank.
 (e) Blank.
 (f) Use of Materials with Special Acceptance Requirements.
 The Alabama Department of Transportation maintains several lists of materials, sources, and
 devices, which have undergone some form of preliminary evaluation. These lists are established
 both as reference for Contractors and as methods to eliminate some of the lengthy time delays
 required in evaluating certain products. Each list is unique in requirements and job control
 acceptance. Users of these lists should read all requirements carefully before using products on
 them. When materials or products shown on these lists are used, they shall be selected from the
 most current applicable list at the time of installation, regardless of the materials and products
 that may have been shown on the lists prior to the date of installation. These lists are published in
 the Department's manual "MATERIAL, SOURCES, AND DEVICES WITH SPECIAL ACCEPTANCE
 REQUIREMENTS" (MSDSAR), which is available on the Department’s website.
 The lists are not a blanket approval and do not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of
 furnishing quality materials. The Project Manager will inspect the material, and if doubt exists,
 39
 
 SECTION 106
 CONTROL OF MATERIALS
 job control samples will be taken. If these job control samples indicate failing test results, one of
 the following actions will be taken depending on the detrimental effects to the project:
 1. Previously installed materials may be ordered replaced with passing materials at no cost
 to the Department.
 2. Previously installed materials, which are of a temporary nature, may be left in place
 with the Contractor maintaining the failing materials for the duration of their use at his
 expense.
 3. Previously installed materials may remain in place with an agreed price reduction.
 After failing job control results are received, no further installation of the failing material
 will be allowed and a determination will be made by the Department as to the removal of the
 product from the list.
 The lists are established and maintained by the individual sections within the Department of
 Transportation who are primarily concerned with the products. Lists are divided into five general
 categories of similar requirements. They are:
 1. Qualified Sources of Materials
 2. Approved Materials
 3. Qualified Materials
 4. Approved Traffic Control Devices and Materials
 5. Qualified Traffic Control Devices and Materials
 The Alabama Department of Transportation Product Evaluation Board has final authority for
 addition or removal of products from these lists. The Bureau of Materials and Tests duplicates and
 disseminates these lists.
 General information concerning materials, sources, and devices with special acceptance
 requirements is contained in ALDOT-355. Information concerning items on these lists or how to get
 an item onto one of these lists may be obtained by contacting:

 Inspection and testing shall be in accordance with the current Departmental Testing Manual. Any
 work in which untested materials are used without approval or written permission of the Engineer
 shall be performed at the Contractor's risk. Materials found to be unacceptable and unauthorized
 will not be paid for and, if directed by the Engineer, shall be removed at the Contractor's expense.
 The Engineer may permit use prior to sampling and testing of certain materials accompanied by a
 signed materials guaranty on the form furnished by the Department guaranteeing the material
 conforms to Departmental Specifications. Such material may be tested at any time and, if found
 unsatisfactory, shall be removed and replaced with satisfactory material at no additional cost to
 the Department. The Engineer reserves the right to refuse permission for use of materials on the
 guaranty basis at any time.
 The Contractor shall furnish the Department, free of charge, ample quantities of such
 samples as are necessary or required by the Engineer to test adequately any and all materials. Any
 damage caused by in-place testing when such is specified shall be repaired by the Contractor
 without additional compensation. Samples will be taken by or under the supervision of a
 representative of the Engineer. Required or designated tests will be made by and at the expense
 of the State unless otherwise noted on the plans or in the specifications, in accordance with the
 most recent standard, interim, or tentative standard methods of ALDOT, AASHTO, ASTM or F.S.S.
 in force and on file with the Department at the date of advertisement for bids, indicated date of
 adoption notwithstanding, except where standard or special drawings are included in the plans.
 Then the AASHTO, ASTM, or F.S.S. in effect on the date of the latest revision to the drawing shall
 govern.

 (b) Storage of Materials.
 Materials shall be so stored as to assure the preservation of their quality and fitness for the
 work. Stored materials, even though approved before storage, may again be inspected prior to
 their use in the work. Stored materials shall be located so as to facilitate their prompt inspection.
 Approved portions of the right of way may be used for storage purposes and for the placing of the
 Contractor's plant and equipment, but any additional space required therefor must be provided by
 the Contractor at his expense. Private property shall not be used for storage purposes without
 written permission of the owner or lessee, and if requested by the Engineer copies of such written
 permission shall be furnished him. All storage sites shall be restored to their original condition by
 the Contractor at his expense. This shall not apply to the stripping and storing of topsoil, or to
 other materials salvaged from the work.
 
 106.06 Unacceptable Materials.
 All materials not conforming to the requirements of the Specifications shall be considered as
 unacceptable and all such materials will be rejected and shall be removed immediately from the site of
 
 42
 
 SECTION 106
 CONTROL OF MATERIALS
 the work unless otherwise instructed by the Engineer. No rejected material, the defects of which have
 been corrected, shall be used until approval has been given.
 In case of failure by the Contractor to comply promptly with any order by the Engineer to remove
 rejected materials, the Engineer shall have authority to have such rejected materials removed by other
 means and to deduct the expense of such removal from any monies due or to become due the
 Contractor.
 
 106.07 Department Furnished Material.
 The Contractor shall furnish all materials required to complete the work, except those specified to
 be furnished by the Department.
 Material furnished by the Department will be delivered or made available to the Contractor at the
 points specified in the special provisions.
 The cost of handling and placing all materials after they are delivered to the Contractor shall be
 considered as included in the contract price for the item in connection with which they are used.
 The Contractor will be held responsible for all material delivered to him, and deductions will be
 made from any monies due him to make good any shortages and deficiencies, from any cause
 whatsoever, and for any damage which may occur after such delivery, and for any demurrage charges.
 
 106.08 Rights In and Use of Materials Found on the Right of Way.
 The Contractor, upon his written request and written approval of the Engineer, may use on the
 project, sand, gravel, rock, or other materials determined suitable by the Engineer as may be found in
 the limits of the regular excavation. The Engineer will make a study of the Contractor's request and
 shall submit to the Contractor a written statement of the guidelines under which the request is
 approved. This statement shall include a detailed analysis of the pay item, or items, under which the
 Contractor will receive payment for the work performed. The intent is not to preclude payment for
 both the item of removal and the item under which the materials are used, if, in the opinion of the
 Engineer payment under both items are justified, but to allow the Department to share in any savings
 realized by the Contractor in the use of such materials.
 The Contractor shall not excavate or remove any material from within the highway location that is
 not within the grading limits, as indicated by the slope and grade lines, without written authorization
 from the Engineer.
 Any coal or other valuable mineral found within the construction limits as defined by the slope and
 grade lines considered to be unsuitable for reuse on the project shall be removed by the Contractor. In
 no case shall any coal or other mineral be removed from outside the slope lines or below subgrade
 except that removed as unsuitable material as directed by the Engineer (not to exceed 30 inches
 {750 mm} below subgrade), unless otherwise shown by plan details or with written authorization of the
 Transportation Director. The Contractor shall assume full responsibility and liability for insuring that
 any legal rights due the holder of the mineral rights are satisfied prior to the disposition of any
 mineral. By agreement with the owner of the mineral rights, the Contractor may dispose of this
 material by direct sale and payment of royalty to the owner or by stockpiling for immediate removal by
 the owner. The Contractor shall hold the State harmless in all matters pertaining to the disposition of
 any mineral.
 
 106.09 Quality Control and Quality Assurance (QC/QA) Requirements for Hot Mix
 Asphalt (HMA) Pavement.
 (a) General.
 The following modifications apply only to the materials and work performed under Sections
 327, 410, 420, 423 and 424.
 In all cases, the Department's testing will be separate from the Contractor's testing and both
 shall be conducted by certified technicians.
 All Quality Control aspects of this provision shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.
 Quality Control is defined as the activities that are related to the production of Hot Mix Asphalt
 Pavement which meet all the requirements of the Specifications, including mix design, process
 control testing, sampling and acceptance testing (when so designated by the Department) for
 determination of Pay Factors, and necessary adjustments to the production process.
 All Quality Assurance aspects of this provision shall be the responsibility of the Department
 and will be accomplished in the following ways:
 
 43
 
 SECTION 106
 CONTROL OF MATERIALS
 1. By conducting assurance/verification testing, on a random basis, of independent samples
 obtained by the Department, at a frequency of one or more per day;
 2. By periodically observing tests performed by the Contractor;
 3. By monitoring required Contractor control charts exhibiting test results of control
 parameters.
 All Superpave Gyratory Compactors shall have their angle of gyration verified by the Engineer
 following the procedure in AASHTO T 344, "Standard Method of Test for Evaluation of Superpave
 Gyratory Compactor (SGC) Internal Angle of Gyration Using Simulated Loading". This includes all
 design, quality control, and quality assurance SGCs. The compactors shall tilt the specimen molds
 at an average internal angle of 20.2 ± 0.35 mrad (1.16± 0.02 degrees).
 
 (b) Quality Control.
 The Contractor shall provide and maintain a quality control system that will provide
 reasonable assurance that all materials, products, and completed construction submitted for
 acceptance conform to contract requirements whether manufactured or processed by the
 Contractor or procured from subcontractors or vendors. Quality control managers, laboratory
 technicians and roadway technicians will be certified by the Department as outlined in ALDOT374, "Certification Requirements for Hot Mix Asphalt Technicians". This quality control system shall
 conform to ALDOT-370, Quality Control and Quality Assurance Procedures and Responsibilities for
 Asphalt Plant Mix Production.
 The sampling and testing frequencies shall conform to the requirements given in Table 1 for a
 pay item when the accumulated amount of asphalt mix placed for that pay item exceeds 250 tons
 {250 metric tons}. The accumulated amount of asphalt mix shall be the current total amount of
 asphalt mix that has been placed beginning from the start of construction. The sampling and
 testing frequencies given in Table 1 may be waived by the Area Materials Engineer and the asphalt
 mix may be accepted by visual observation for a maximum accumulated asphalt mix placement
 quantity of 250 tons {250 metric tons} or less for any individual pay item. The Engineer will record
 the results of the acceptance of the asphalt mix on form BMT-16 if sampling and testing is not
 required.

 *X* Testing in accordance with the requirements given in Section 410 is only required for Job Mix Formulas that have greater than 25 % RAP. Mix
 shall be tested by an AASHTO accredited laboratory.
 
 (c) Quality Assurance.
 1. Acceptance Procedures.
 All materials will be evaluated for acceptance and payment through the Department's
 Acceptance Procedures specified herein. The Department will be responsible for determining
 the acceptability and pay factor of the construction and materials incorporated therein.
 The Department will utilize the Contractor’s QC System test results for liquid asphalt
 binder content and laboratory compacted air void content for pay purposes except where:
 a. The Department’s Quality Assurance testing, as described in Item 3 below and
 Subarticle 410.08, does not validate the quality of the material.
 b. QC sampling and testing was not performed in accordance with specified
 procedures.
 The Department will determine the sample locations.
 The sampling and testing frequencies shall conform to the requirements given in Table 1
 for a pay item when the accumulated amount of asphalt mix placed for that pay item exceeds
 250 tons {250 metric tons}. The accumulated amount of asphalt mix shall be the current total
 amount of asphalt mix that has been placed beginning from the start of construction. The
 sampling and testing frequencies given in Table 1 may be waived by the Area Materials
 Engineer and the asphalt mix may be accepted by visual observation for a maximum
 accumulated asphalt mix placement quantity of 250 tons {250 metric tons} or less for any
 individual pay item. The Engineer will record the results of the acceptance of the asphalt mix
 on form BMT-16 if sampling and testing is not required.
 All conforming and nonconforming inspections and test results will be monitored in
 accordance with ALDOT-370 and shall be recorded on approved forms and charts which shall
 be kept up to date and complete and shall be available at all times to the Department during
 the performance of the work. Only those tests designated by the Department in advance as
 acceptance tests will be utilized in the computation of pay factors. Test properties shall be
 charted on forms that are in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Department.
 A copy of each chart and form to be used by the Contractor will be furnished by the
 Department. The Contractor shall furnish his own supply of the charts and forms. The
 Contractor or Producer may design their own forms and charts; however, these must be
 approved by the Engineer prior to their use.
 A LOT is normally defined as 2,800 tons {metric tons} for Section 327, 423 and 424
 mixes, and 2,000 tons {metric tons} for Section 420 mixes, consisting offour QC test sets of
 laboratory tests (liquid asphalt binder content and laboratory air voids or gradation), unless
 specifically stated otherwise in this item or elsewhere in the specifications.A LOT will usually
 consist of at least four density tests; however, a LOT may have fewer than four density tests.
 The Engineer will round a testing increment or a LOT to the nearest truckload of material.
 A LOT lasting longer than thirty calendar days or a LOT with inactivity for longer than 30
 calendar days will be terminated. Mix produced after the completion of the last full LOT, a
 terminated LOT, and small production projects will be evaluated and pay factors computed
 and may be accepted on the basis of less than four laboratory tests (liquid asphalt binder
 content and laboratory air voids or gradation).

 LOT. If the production process is considered out of control (any individual test result for
 asphalt content, gradation (single sieve), or air voids has a pay factor equal to 0.80 computed
 from the “1 Test” row in Table II and Table III, or the “1 Test” column in Table VI, of
 Subarticle 410.08 whichever is appropriate), production shall be suspended and corrections
 made as outlined in Subarticle 410.08. Gradation pay factors are normally computed on each
 screen tested and then averaged, however, if any individual screen has a pay factor of 0.80
 (before being averaged with the other screen(s)), the process is considered out of control.
 The Contractor may voluntarily terminate a LOT when the pay factor will be less than
 0.90 when calculated using the one test row of Table II and Table III and the one test column
 of Table VI in Section 410. If the Contractor terminates a LOT, production shall be suspended
 and corrections made as outlined in Subarticle 410.08. The voluntary termination of a LOT
 may only be done once per pay item, per project.
 All sampling, testing and computations for a LOT will be completed and pay factors
 provided the Contractor as soon as possible.
 All sampling and testing of materials, including frequency of samples and tests for the
 Contractor's Quality Control and the Department's verification, shall be performed in strict
 conformance with the Department's Testing Manual as modified in Table I. This Manual
 (available on the ALDOT Internet Site) contains guidance for sampling and testing procedures
 from AASHTO, ASTM, and ALDOT procedures.
 2. Acceptance or Rejection.
 The decision of the Engineer will be final as to the acceptance, rejection, or acceptance
 at an adjusted payment of each LOT. Rejected LOTS shall be removed at no cost to the
 Department and replaced at the contract unit bid price.
 3. Sampling of Lots and Sublots.
 It is the intent of these specifications that each LOT (for mixture testing) and each
 SUBLOT (for mat density testing) will meet specification requirements at the time of initial
 evaluation. No resampling or retesting (other than referee testing described below) will be
 allowed. The Department will, however, perform at least one liquid asphalt binder content,
 one maximum specific gravity, one mixture gradation, and one set of laboratory compacted
 samples for air void content tests per day per Lot, as specified in Table I, to verify the
 Contractor's test results. If the Contractor is not required to perform a test that day (the
 tonnage calculated by the random number is not reached), the Department will not run a
 verification test. The Department will perform a verification test for each LOT, even where
 there is more than one LOT per day.
 The Contractor will be notified by the Engineer at the point in production to procure
 mixture acceptance samples. The Contractor shall sample the mixture and split it into two
 samples: the Contractor's primary sample and a referee sample. The portions of mixture for
 the referee sample shall be bagged, labeled, and stored for testing, if required. All referee
 samples will be kept by the Department until they are tested (if required).
 The Contractor shall obtain a verification testing sample from each LOT each day for
 testing by the Department. The verification testing samples shall be taken at locations
 directed by the Engineer. These locations will be different from the Contractor’s mixture
 acceptance sample locations. The Contractor may take half of each sample for verification
 testing. The Department will compare the verification sample to the closest (in tonnage)
 Contractor’s primary sample. The sampling of Hot Mix Asphalt is outlined in ALDOT-380,
 Forms and Examples for Sampling and Computing Pay Factors for Hot Mix Asphalt.
 4. Testing and Lot Verification.
 Air voids shall be computed on the Contractor’s sample by using the running average of
 the Contractor’s last four maximum specific gravities. If slag is used as an aggregate in the
 mixture, the running average of the Contractor’s four most recent determinations for the
 bulk specific gravity of the compacted mixture shall be used in the computation of the air
 voids for the Contractor’s sample. The calculation of the running averages of both maximum
 specific gravity and bulk specific gravity shall start with the first LOT. The test strip is
 independent of the LOTs. Air voids shall be computed on the Department’s sample by using
 the Department’s individual maximum specific gravity and bulk specific gravity. The
 Department and the Contractor shall compare test results with each other for the above
 48
 
 SECTION 106
 CONTROL OF MATERIALS
 mentioned testing increments. If there are no differences or if the differences are within the
 tolerances listed in Tables V or VI, Section 410, for each parameter, no further testing and
 analysis will be necessary and the Contractor’s test values will be used in the computation of
 the appropriate LOT pay factor.
 If the Contractor’s air voids do not compare with the Department’s test results, the
 Contractor shall re-compute test results using the individual maximum specific gravity for
 that particular testing increment and re-compare with the verification test result. If the
 results compare within the tolerances in Table V, Section 410, using the individual maximum
 specific gravities, no further testing will be required and the Contractor’s running average of
 the last four maximum specific gravities will be used to compute air voids for pay factor
 determination.
 Also, if the Contractor’s air voids do not compare with the Department’s test results,
 and the Contractor is using slag as an aggregate, the Contractor shall re-compute test results
 using the individual bulk specific gravity for that particular testing increment and re-compare
 with the verification test result. If the results compare within the tolerances in Table V,
 Section 410, using the individual bulk specific gravity, no further testing will be required and
 the Contractor’s running average of the last four bulk specific gravities will be used to
 compute air voids for pay factor determination.
 If the results of the Department’s verification test and the Contractor’s test do not
 compare within the tolerances in Tables V or VI, Section 410, but yield the same pay factor
 for the LOT when the Department’s result is substituted for the Contractor’s result, no
 further testing will be required. Where the Contractor’s test results and the Department’s
 test results do not compare and cannot be resolved by the above mentioned methods but the
 pay factor dispute is between 1.00 and 1.02 the Contractor may elect to accept the 1.00 pay
 factor and waive referee testing.
 When differences between test results of the verification samples are not within the
 tolerances listed in Tables V or VI, Section 410, and cannot be resolved by the above
 mentioned methods, referee testing will be required.
 All referee samples will be tested by the Bureau of Materials and Tests, Central
 Laboratory, 3704 Fairground Road, Montgomery, AL 36110. The Bureau of Materials and Tests
 Central Laboratory is an AASHTO accredited laboratory (see AASHTO R 18, Recommended
 Practice for Establishing and Implementing a Quality System for Construction Materials
 Testing Laboratories).
 5. Referee Testing
 a. Laboratory:
 All testing increments of the referee samples for the entire LOT shall be tested in
 the Bureau of Materials and Tests Hot Mix Laboratory forthe pay factor parameter(s)
 (liquid asphalt binder content, laboratory compacted air voids, or gradation) in question.
 The Contractor’s results (using the individual air voids and maximum specific gravities)
 will be compared to the Bureau of Materials and Tests results (using Materials and Tests
 individual bulk and maximum specific gravities) for each testing increment in the LOT.
 When the Contractor’s results and the Bureau of Materials and Tests results are within
 the tolerances listed in Tables V or VI, Section 410, the Contractor’s results will be used.
 When the Contractor’s results are not within the tolerances listed in Tables V or VI,
 Section 410, the Bureau of Materials and Tests Central Laboratory results will be used for
 final pay factors. The Bureau of Materials and Tests Central Laboratory will record the
 Contractor’s field results and the Central Laboratory’s results of the parameter(s) in
 question on form BMT-135.
 For each testing increment these results, either the Contractor’s or the Bureau of
 Materials and Tests’, will be used in the computation of the appropriate LOT pay factor.
 Should differences between test results, that are not within the tolerances listed in
 Table V or VI, Section 410, for liquid asphalt binder content, air voids, or gradation
 continue for two consecutive days, operations shall be halted until testing discrepancies
 can be resolved. The Bureau of Materials and Tests will monitor testing procedures by
 Department and Contractor technicians until consistent test results are achieved.
 
 49
 
 SECTION 106
 CONTROL OF MATERIALS
 b. Cores:
 If the Contractor believes that the core density values determined by the State are
 in error, the Contractor shall notify the Area Materials Engineer in writing that referee
 testing is requested. Using the original cores, the Area will again determine the densities
 of the cores in question using a technician different from the technician who originally
 determined the core density. If these new densities result in a different pay factor, the
 new pay factor shall be applied to the tonnage in question (this may increase or
 decrease the Contractor’s pay adjustment).
 6. Adjusted Payment for Deficiencies.
 The payment for each LOT will be adjusted on the basis of acceptance test results in
 accordance with the requirements given in this Section. Accurate records shall be kept of the
 quantity (tonnage) of plant mix in each LOT.
 Pay factors shall be determined for each LOT from the values given in Tables II, III, IV,
 and VI, Section 410, in accordance with the following:

 The lowest numerical pay factor in a Lot will be applied to the contract price for the
 total tonnage {metric tonnage} in the LOT. This will result in an adjustment to the
 compensation for the Lot that will be shown in a separate line item on the payment
 estimates.
 Pay factors above 1.00 will not be applied to mixes that are tested on fewer than three
 characteristics or when there are less than four laboratory tests (percent liquid asphalt binder
 and laboratory air voids or gradation) per characteristic; it is not necessary to obtain four
 roadway densities to obtain a pay factor above 1.00. When the pay factor is calculated to be
 greater than 1.00, a pay factor of 1.00 will be applied.
 Pay factors above 1.00 will not be applied to mixes where the roadway density
 requirement has been lowered below 94%.
 
 (d) Adjustment Period.
 During start-up operations, an adjustment period (test strip) as described below shall be
 required when producing a new job mix formula. The purpose of the adjustment period will be to
 permit the Contractor to adjust his production process and for Contractor QC personnel and ALDOT
 QA personnel to calibrate and coordinate their testing procedures. The Contractor has the option
 of running a test strip or waiving the test strip, if the proposed job mix formula has been produced
 satisfactorily on previous projects. The waiver of a test strip shall be in writing to the Project
 Manager and the Area Materials Engineer prior to any production and placement of the previously
 produced job mix design. The Contractor assumes the risk of milling and relaying unacceptable
 mix with no additional compensation if the test strip is not utilized.
 A test strip of not more than 500 tons {500 metric tons} shall be constructed. If the
 placement of a test strip is not completed the same day it is begun, the Contractor shall construct
 a new test strip. Production shall stop until the Contractor has completed one liquid asphalt
 binder content, one air void content, and four mat density tests for mixes other than 327 and 420.
 For 327 and 420 mixes the Contractor shall complete one liquid asphalt binder content and one
 gradation. The pay factors for liquid asphalt binder content, air void content, and gradation will
 be calculated using the one test row of Table II and Table III and the one test column of Table VI,
 and the pay factor for mat density will be calculated using the four test column of Table IV in
 Section 410. The production point at which the mix shall be sampled shall be determined by the
 Contractor. This sample does not have to be randomly selected, but should be representative of
 the mix produced. Contractor mat density tests shall be performed with non-destructive density
 testing devices, meeting the requirements of Section 306, which have been calibrated for the
 layer being placed according to ALDOT-222, ALDOT-350, or Section 306. The Contractor shall cut
 cores at these locations and immediately turn the cores over to the Department for density
 measurements and determination of the pay factor. The Department will conduct the same tests
 for verification at the same time the Contractor is conducting his tests. If a pay factor of less than
 1.00 is obtained using the one test row of Table II and Table III and the one test column of Table
 50
 
 SECTION 107
 LEGAL RELATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC
 VI, and using the four test column of Table IV in Section 410, a second test strip consisting of 200
 tons {200 metric tons} shall be constructed. If a pay factor of less than 1.00 is obtained using the
 one test row of Table II and Table III and the one test column of Table VI, and using the four test
 column of Table IV in Section 410 in the second test strip, additional 200 ton {200 metric ton} test
 strips shall be constructed until pay factors are equal to 1.00, at which time production can begin.
 A test strip is determined to be complete when the results of the tests are known.
 The Engineer may require any test strip to be removed and replaced at no cost to the
 Department if the pay factor determined from the four test row for mat density or the one test
 row for other tests is 0.80. For actual payment purposes, a pay factor of 1.00 will be used for all
 first and second test strips allowed to remain in place. Pay factors will be applied to the third and
 all subsequent 200 ton test strips at the average of the computed rate (using the one test row)
 and 1.00. 

 107.11 Use of Explosives.
 (a) General.
 It is the intent of this Article to provide general guides for the handling and use of explosives.
 The Contractor shall use all precaution, control, and safety features outlined by this Article as
 well as any additional requirements felt necessary to insure the safety of life or property in the
 area of operations.
 
 (b) Control.
 When the use of explosives is necessary for the prosecution of the work, the Contractor shall
 use the utmost care not to endanger life or property. Blasting operations shall be performed under
 the most skilled supervision. Where necessary and at any point of special danger, the Contractor
 shall use suitable mats or other approved methods to smother his blast. No loaded hole shall be
 left unattended.
 Where blasting is to be done in streams, the Contractor shall notify the Conservation
 Department sufficiently in advance to permit on-the-site observation by Conservation Department
 personnel at the time of the blast.
 Where blasting is performed in urban areas or areas that are heavily populated, extreme care
 shall be taken to minimize the amount and degree of ground vibration, noise, overpressure, and
 flying debris.

 SECTION 107
 LEGAL RELATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC
 
 (c) Storage of Explosives.
 All explosives shall be stored in a safe manner, in compliance with local, State, and Federal
 laws and ordinances.
 
 (d) Warning of Blasting.
 The Contractor shall warn each utility company having structures in proximity to the blasting
 area of his intentions to use explosives. Such warning shall be sufficiently far in advance of
 blasting to enable the company to protect its property. Such warning, however, shall not relieve
 the Contractor of responsibility for any damage resulting from blasting. The Contractor shall erect
 suitable signs on all roads in the immediate vicinity of blasting operations, warning of blasting
 activity. The signs shall also include warning that all portable radio transmitters should be turned
 off while in the vicinity. If required, the Contractor shall control traffic by use of flagmen and
 guards in the danger zone of blasting.
 In all urban areas, and other heavily populated areas when designated by the plans or
 proposal, the Contractor or his insurer shall conduct a pre-blast survey of all structures to
 determine the existing or preblasting condition, such survey being a written description with
 special emphasis on defects and documented with appropriate photographs. This survey is
 intended to serve as a basis of comparison for any post-blast claims that may arise. The Contractor
 or his insurer shall obtain the services of a competent vibration or seismologist consultant to
 conduct both blast noise, vibration and overpressure surveys at periodic intervals during the
 progress of the blasting operations. It is the intent of this Section to serve as protection to the
 Contractor to minimize the post-blast claims and not to require unwarranted work. The Contractor
 shall use every precaution available and practical to minimize ground vibration, noise and
 overpressure.
 The Contractor and his surety shall indemnify and save harmless the State, the Director and
 all its representatives from all claims for damages arising out of the use, transportation, or
 storage of explosives.
 
 107.12 Protection and Restoration of Property, Landscape and Utility Facilities.
 (a) Property and Landscape.
 The Contractor shall not enter upon private property for any purpose without permission first
 being obtained from the owners and lessees. The Contractor shall be responsible for preservation
 of all public and private property, utilities, monuments, highway signs, etc. on or adjacent to the
 highway. He shall not remove, injure, or destroy without proper authority trees or plants that are
 shown on the plans or ordered by the Engineer to remain on or adjacent to the right of way. The
 Contractor shall protect from disturbance all land markers until an authorized agent has witnessed
 or referenced the locations and shall not move them until directed. The Contractor shall notify
 the Engineer immediately upon discovery of artifacts or other articles of possible archeological
 value revealed by his operations, and shall carefully preserve them and prevent disturbance of the
 site until the Engineer has had opportunity to arrange appropriate disposal. Highway signs and
 markers shall be carefully removed as the grading operations progress and stored in a manner to
 keep them clean and dry.
 When the work affects the foundation support of any building along the work, the Contractor
 shall give property owners and lessees direct and sufficient notice to support such buildings. The
 Contractor and his surety shall hold the State, the County, the Municipality, the Director, and the
 Engineer harmless from any damage resulting from undercutting any such buildings.
 The Contractor shall be solely and exclusively responsible for any and all restoration, repair
 or replacement of public and private property due to, caused by, or as a result of any act,
 omission, negligence or misconduct of the Contractor. The Contractor shall provide an appropriate
 remedy as approved by the Engineer.
 Failure on the part of the Contractor to satisfy the requirements given in this Subarticle, shall
 result in the Engineer affecting an appropriate remedy at the Contractor’s expense.
 
 (b) Utilities.
 1. Where the Contractor's operations are adjacent to utilities or other property, damage to
 which might result in expense, loss, or inconvenience, work shall not be begun until all
 arrangements necessary for property protection has been made.
 The Contractor shall be responsible to the owners and operators of such property for any
 damage, loss, or inconvenience. He and his surety shall defend any suits, actions, or claims of any
 55
 
 SECTION 107
 LEGAL RELATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC
 character brought due to injuries or damages resulting from performance of the work under this
 contract. If required by the Director, he shall furnish a certificate of his public liability and
 property damage insurance to each utility company or individual owning or operating any of the
 properties affected in the guarantee of this responsibility.
 2. The Contractor shall cooperate with the owners of any utilities in their removal and
 rearrangement operations so that the utility companies may conduct their operations in a
 reasonable manner with a minimum of duplication of the work and interruption of services. The

 107.16 Opening Sections of Project to Traffic.
 Opening of sections of the work to traffic prior to completion of the entire contract may be
 desirable from a traffic service standpoint, or may be necessary due to conditions inherent in the work,
 or by changes in the Contractor's work schedule, and may be necessary due to conditions or events
 unforeseen at the time of the contract. Such openings as may be necessary due to any of the foregoing
 conditions shall be made when so ordered by the Engineer. Under no condition shall such openings
 constitute acceptance of the work or a part thereof, or a waiver of any provisions of the contract.
 The plans and/or special provisions shall state, insofar as possible, which sections shall be opened
 prior to completion of the contract. On any section opened by order of the Engineer, whether covered
 on the plans or in the special provision or not, the Contractor shall not be required to assume any
 expense entailed in maintaining the road for traffic. Such expense shall be borne by the Department,
 or compensated for in a manner provided in Article 109.04. On such portions of the project which are
 ordered by the Engineer to be opened for traffic, in the case of unforeseen necessity which is not the
 fault of the Contractor, compensation for additional expense, if any, to the Contractor and allowance
 of additional time, if any, for completion of any other items of work on the portions of the project
 ordered by the Engineer to be opened in the event of such unforeseen necessity, shall be as set forth in
 a change order mutually agreed on by the Engineer and the Contractor as set forth herein.
 If the Contractor is dilatory in completing shoulders, drainage structures, or other features of the

 which the work should be completed. If the Contractor is dilatory or fails to make a reasonable effort
 toward completion in this period of time, the Engineer may then order all or a portion of the project
 opened to traffic. On such sections which are so ordered to be opened, the Contractor shall conduct
 the remainder of his construction operations so as to cause the least obstruction to traffic and shall not
 receive any added compensation due to the added cost of the work by reason of opening such section
 to traffic.
 On any section opened to traffic under any of the above conditions, whether stated on the plans
 or in the Special Provisions or opened by necessity of Contractor's operations, or unforeseen necessity,
 any damage to the highway not attributable to traffic which might occur on such section (except slides)
 shall be repaired by the Contractor at his expense. Slide corrections performed by the Contractor shall
 be compensated for in accordance with the provisions of Article 210.10.
 
 107.17 Contractor's Responsibility for Work.
 Until final written acceptance of the project by the Engineer, the Contractor shall have the charge

 nonexecution of the work. The Contractor shall rebuild, repair, restore and make good all injuries or
 damages to any portion of the work occasioned by any of the above causes before final acceptance and
 shall bear the expense thereof except damage to the work due to unforeseeable causes beyond the
 control of and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, including but not restricted to acts of
 God such as earthquake, tidal wave, tornado, hurricane or other cataclysmic phenomenon of nature, or
 acts of the public enemy or of governmental authorities.
 Where a roadway is open to traffic, damage caused by public traffic to any acceptably installed
 permanent item(s) of work shall be repaired by the Contractor before final acceptance. Damage to
 59
 
 SECTION 107
 LEGAL RELATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC
 portable impact attenuators shall be repaired by the Contractor as necessary. If the damage to these
 items was not caused by the fault or negligence of the Contractor, then the Contractor will be
 compensated for the repair work either at the contract unit bid price(s) of the original item(s) of work
 or as extra work, as determined by the Engineer.
 In case of suspension of work, the Contractor shall be responsible for the project, provide for
 normal drainage and shall erect any necessary temporary structures, signs, or other facilities at his
 expense. During such period of suspension of work, the Contractor shall properly and continuously
 maintain in an acceptable growing condition all living material in newly established plantings,
 seedings, and soddings furnished under his contract, and shall take adequate precautions to protect
 new tree growth and other important vegetative growth against injury.

 understood that in all such matters they act solely as agents and representatives of the State.
 
 107.20 No Waiver of Legal Rights.
 Upon completion of the work, the Department will expeditiously make final inspection and notify
 the Contractor of acceptance. Such final acceptance and processing of the final estimate, however,
 shall not preclude or estop the Department from correcting any measurement, estimate, or certificate
 made before or after completion of the work, nor shall the Department be precluded or estopped from
 recovering from the Contractor or his surety, or both, such overpayments as it may sustain, or by
 failure on the part of the Contractor to fulfill his obligations under the contract. A waiver on the part
 of the Department of any breach of any part of the contract shall not be held to be a waiver of any
 other or subsequent breach.
 The Contractor, without prejudice to the terms of the contract, shall be liable to the Department
 for latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as may amount to fraud, or as regards the
 Department's rights under any warranty or guaranty.

 SWTS by the Project QCI.
 If the NPDES permit is held by the LPA, the reports shall be written using ADEM’s Form 23
 11/11 or Form 25 11/11 (if applicable) by the LPA QCI. Formal inspections shall be reported
 to ADEM by the Permittee in accordance with NPDES permit requirements. Copies of all draft
 reports shall be provided to the Engineer no later than 24 hours after the inspection. Copies
 of signed reports shall be submitted to the Engineer no later than 5 days after the inspection.
 3. QCP Site Evaluations.
 The Permittee’s Qualified Credential Professional (QCP) shall personally perform site
 evaluations in accordance with the NPDES General Permit at least once per every six months.
 These evaluations shall consist of an onsite inspection of all erosion, sediment, and turbidity
 control best management practices being implemented to determine adequacy and
 consistency with site conditions and shall include a review of the CBMPP to ensure proper
 maintenance. The resulting inspection reports shall be submitted to ADEM by the Permittee’s
 QCP. For ALDOT held NPDES permits, the resulting inspection reports will be entered into the
 Department’s SWTS by the Project QCP.
 4. Corrective Actions.
 If an inspection report reveals anything outside of regulatory compliance, the NPDES
 General Permit requires immediate corrective action shall be taken by the Contractor and
 completed prior to the next storm event but no later than 5 days after the inspection unless
 prevented by unsafe weather conditions. Additional inspections shall be performed until the
 observed deficiency is corrected and in compliance with the NPDES General Permit. Should
 discharges from construction activity cause or contribute to instream turbidity exceeding
 background turbidity by more than 50 nephelometric turbidity units (NTUs), or cause
 substantial visible contrast with background turbidity, the Contractor shall suspend
 construction activity in the drainage area discharging to the affected Stormwater Discharge
 Point until effective corrective actions are implemented and instream turbidity decreased to
 acceptable levels. The suspension of construction activities includes all operations that are
 not directed toward correction of erosion, sediment, and turbidity control best management
 practices, permanent stabilization, or returning the project to regulatory compliance. ALDOT
 has the right to require the suspension of similar construction activities throughout the
 project should conditions and actions by the Contractor be deemed unacceptable by the
 Engineer.

 3. The drawing shall also include details and dimensions of the pipes, bridges, or other
 facilities allowing the passage of water. It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor
 to ensure the opening under or through the drainage facilities is adequately sized to
 allow for normal seasonal flows.
 4. A description of the sequence of placement and eventual removal of any temporary
 fill.
 5. The type and estimated volume in cubic yards {cubic meters} and tons {metric tons} of
 any fill material proposed to be placed.
 6. Provisions required to prevent fill from being eroded and measures for recovering and
 removing any fill material that is eroded.
 US Army Corps of Engineers or other regulatory approval and notice may be required for the
 encroachment into streams, water bodies and wetlands. Corps of Engineers approval that is not given
 to the ALDOT or to the County holding the Nationwide Permit for the project will not be accepted as
 being adequate regulatory authorization for the encroachment.
 All encroachments into streams, water bodies and wetlands shall be done in accordance with the
 requirements of regulatory permitting, approvals and conditions. Encroachments shall be done in a
 manner that will minimize the adverse affect on the quality of the water. Maintenance shall be
 performed as necessary to ensure water passage and to ensure that neither fill nor water is
 contaminated by equipment fluids or by loose materials falling from equipment.
 The methods and materials proposed for temporary encroachments into streams, water bodies and
 wetlands and the protection of water quality during an encroachment shall be done by the Contractor
 with no direct payment unless shown otherwise on the plans.
 
 107.24 Permits for Pesticide Application.
 All pesticide (including herbicide) applications shall be done under the on-site, direct supervision
 of a person possessing a Commercial Pesticide Application Permit and a Professional Services Permit
 (turf and ornamentals category) or a Commercial Applicator Permit and a Custom Applicator Permit
 (right-of-way pest control category) issued through the Alabama Department of Agriculture and
 Industries. Proof of the possession of these permits shall be furnished to the Engineer prior to the
 commencement of work. Any work performed without the on-site, direct supervision of these
 permitted individuals will be subject to rejection by the Engineer.
 
 SECTION 108
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 108.01 Subletting and Assignment.
 (a) Subletting.
 1. Limitations of the Extent of Subletting.
 64
 
 SECTION 108
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 The Contractor shall not sublet the contract or any portion thereof, or of his right, title,
 or interest therein, without written consent of the Engineer. If such consent is given, the
 Contractor will be permitted to sublet a portion of the work, but shall perform with his own
 organization, work amounting to not less than 30 percent of the total contract cost. A
 Contractor that does not perform at least 30 percent of the work with his own organization
 may be disqualified from further bidding and may not be approved for work in any role or
 capacity on an ALDOT project.
 Upon default of the Contractor, the surety will be permitted to have all of the work
 performed under sublet approval.
 Work performed without sublet approval will be designated as unauthorized work as
 noted in Article 105.11.
 Any items designated in the contract as "specialty items" may be performed by
 subcontract and the cost of such specialty items performed by subcontract may be deducted
 from the total cost before computing the amount of work required to be performed by the
 contractor with his own organization. No subcontracts, or transfer of contract, shall relieve
 the Contractor of his liability under the contract and bonds.
 The Department reserves the right to disapprove a request for permission to sublet when
 the proposed Subcontractor has been disqualified from bidding for those reasons listed in
 Subarticle 102.02(b).
 2. Subcontractor's Status.
 A Subcontractor shall be recognized only in the capacity of an employee or agent of the
 Contractor and his removal may be required by the Engineer, as in the case of an employee.
 
 (b) Assignment.
 The performance of the contract may not be assigned, except upon the written consent of
 the Director. Consent will not be given to any proposed assignment which would relieve the
 original Contractor or his surety of their responsibilities under the contract nor will the Director
 consent to any assignment of a part of the work under the contract.
 The Contractor may assign moneys due or to become due him under the contract, if such
 assignment is approved by the Director, to the extent permitted by law, but any assignment of
 moneys shall be subject to all proper set-offs in favor of the Department and to allow deductions
 provided for in the contract and particularly all money withheld, whether assigned or not, shall be
 subject to being used by the Department for the completion of the work in the event that the
 Contractor should be in default therein.
 An assignment by operations of law or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the
 bankruptcy of the Contractor, shall not vest any right in this contract in the Trustee in
 bankruptcy, the Contractor's creditors, or the agent of the creditors.
 In no case will the Department make the warrant payable to anyone other than a party to the
 contract and; therefore, if the contractor assigns the proceeds of his contract to a bank or other
 individual or company, approval of the assignment by the Director only constitutes an agreement
 to make the warrants payable to the contractor and for it to be mailed to the address of the party
 to which the contract is assigned.
 
 108.02 Notice to Proceed.
 (a) General.
 A notice to proceed shall be issued by the Engineer within 15 calendar days after final
 execution of the contract by the Director and approval by the Governor, unless both parties agree
 in writing to a stipulated extension in time for the issuance of a notice to proceed. Unless the
 Contractor is otherwise notified in writing, it shall be understood that the mailing or the delivery
 to the Contractor or his authorized agent, of a copy of the executed and approved contract and
 bonds or the mailing of written notice by the Engineer or receipt of telegraphic notice from the
 Engineer, that the contract has been approved by the Governor, shall constitute the notice to
 proceed. If the Contractor is notified in writing that none of the above shall constitute notice to
 proceed, he shall not commence work until receipt of a written notice to proceed signed by the
 Engineer.
 
 (b) Time of Beginning Work.
 Unless otherwise directed in writing by the Engineer, the Contractor will be expected to
 begin work within 15 calendar days after issuance of notice to proceed.
 65
 
 SECTION 108
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 
 108.03 Progress Schedule of Operations.
 Prior to the Preconstruction Conference, the Contractor shall submit a satisfactory,
 comprehensive bar graph schedule of operations to the Area Construction Engineer on all projects
 which have a contract time in excess of 90 working days or 180 calendar days. This schedule shall be on
 Form C-10 furnished by the Department at the time of contract award. Said schedule of operation shall
 provide a bar for each major phase of construction such as, but not limited to, clearing and grubbing,
 grading, drainage structures, bridges, base, shoulders, paving, etc. with an estimated start and
 completion date for each bar and an overall project completion date, all within the specified contract
 time. In lieu of the Form C-10, the Contractor will be allowed to submit their Critical Path Method
 schedule of operations as a pdf file if the above information is included. The Engineer may order the
 submittal of a bar graph schedule of operation on any project which has a contract time less than that
 specified above should he deem such necessary for project control.
 A revised bar graph schedule and completion update may be required within ten days of the
 occurrence of any one of the following conditions: (1) at each major change from the original
 submitted, (2) when a time extension is granted, and (3) when a revised bar graph schedule is
 requested by the Engineer.
 When an electronic Critical Path schedule is required in the proposal, this schedule will be used in
 lieu of the bar graph schedule of operation in evaluating work progress. In such case, the same time
 frame noted in this Article for the original submittal along with the update requirements will apply.
 The Engineer's approval of the aforementioned Schedule of Operations does not waive any
 contract requirements.
 
 108.04 Prosecution of Work.
 (a) Preconstruction Conference.
 The Contractor and Subcontractors shall attend a preconstruction conference scheduled by
 the Engineer and shall describe how the work will be prosecuted.
 The preconstruction conference will be held after the award of the contract and prior to the
 commencement of any work.
 
 (b) Soil Erosion and Stormwater Management.
 1. Compliance and Progress.
 If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of the National Pollutant
 Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit, the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan
 (ESCP), the Construction Best Management Practices Plan (CBMPP), the accepted Stormwater
 Management Plan (SWMP), other contract documents, or the directions of the Engineer, the
 Engineer may order the Contractor to discontinue all operations except work in managing
 erosion, sediment transport, turbidity, and construction stormwater discharge until the
 requirements are met. Temporary cessation of operations for environmental compliance does
 not and shall not constitute a delay or qualify for consideration of an extension of contract
 time. Failure of ALDOT to observe the work of the Contractor does not relieve the Contractor
 of its contractual responsibility for the prevention of soil erosion and the control of sediment.
 The Permittee’s QCP is responsible for mitigation of damage to public or private property.
 The Contractor shall not commence any activities within a drainage area that disturb the
 soil or expose it to erosive forces until fully prepared to continuously pursue work until
 permanent soil stabilization is achieved. The installation of temporary soil erosion and
 sediment control Best Management Practices (BMPs) shall be performed in coordination with
 the installation of the permanent erosion control features to assure effective continuous
 erosion control throughout the life of the project. The Contractor will be required to
 construct, install and maintain all permanent erosion control features as grading advances.
 2. Manufacturer Recommendations for Manufactured Products and Devices.
 The Contractor shall furnish the manufacturer's recommendations for material selection,
 installation and maintenance of any manufactured BMP or manufactured component of a BMP
 to the Engineer prior to installation.
 3. Contractor’s Stormwater Management Plan.
 The Contractor shall prepare a Stormwater Management Plan (SWMP) for all projects.
 The SWMP is required regardless of the type of work, funding or regulatory permitting. The
 SWMP is required regardless of whether or not an “Erosion and Sediment Control Plan” is
 shown in the plans. The most recent version of ALDOT’s electronic SWMP template shall be
 66
 
 SECTION 108
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 used to create the Contractor’s SWMP. The Contractor and the erosion and sediment control
 Subcontractor, if applicable, shall sign and certify the SWMP. Submitted SWMPs will not be
 considered complete if the provided template has been modified. Three copies of the SWMP
 shall be submitted to the Area Construction Engineer at least 7 days prior to the
 preconstruction conference.
 The SWMP shall provide sequences and details of all erosion and sediment control work,
 clearing and grubbing operations, grading operations and operations establishing permanent
 erosion control features. The SWMP shall include operational details and identification of
 personnel and equipment that will be dedicated to implementing the plan at all phases of the
 work. The SWMP shall include a project specific weather preparedness and recovery plan
 based on the requirements of Subarticle 107.21(d). Work shall not begin until the SWMP has
 been accepted as complete by the Engineer.
 Written acknowledgement of NPDES permit coverage from ADEM and other required
 clearances and acknowledgements required by Subarticle 106.01(b) for any offsite waste
 areas or pits shall be submitted with or included in the SWMP. The details for proposed
 temporary encroachments into streams, water bodies and wetlands required by Article 107.23
 shall be submitted with or included in the SWMP. Requests to store fuel tanks or other
 chemicals on ALDOT right of way and applicable spill prevention plans required by Article
 107.22 shall also be submitted with or included in the SWMP.
 4. Fuel Tanks.
 Any requests to store a fuel tank on the project right of way shall be accompanied by a
 Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan and both shall be submitted with
 or included in the SWMP as required in Article 107.22. The use of onsite fuel storage tanks
 will not be allowed if this is shown to be prohibited on the plans.
 5. Erosion and Sediment Control Plan.
 When an “Erosion and Sediment Control Plan” (ESCP) is included in the plans, it is
 considered to be a part of the ALDOT CBMPP. The Contractor shall comply with the
 requirements of the design details as shown therein. The Contractor may submit requested
 modifications to the ESCP as part of the SWMP for acceptance or rejection by the Engineer.
 The ESCP may also be modified by the Engineer as field conditions warrant. The Contractor
 shall install BMPs in an effective manner and at all locations directed or permitted by the
 Engineer, regardless of the BMP quantities and locations depicted on the ESCP. All
 modifications made to the ESCP will be documented in the CBMPP by the Permittee’s QCI and
 certified by the Permittee’s QCP.
 6. Qualified Credentialed Professionals.
 The Department may assign a full-time Qualified Credentialed Professional (Project QCP)
 to the project. Otherwise another ALDOT QCP, typically the Area Stormwater Coordinator,
 will perform most of the Project QCP duties. The Project QCP will report to the Project
 Manager and will be guided by the Area Stormwater Coordinator. The Project QCP will
 oversee Contractor compliance with the NPDES General Permit, the CBMPP, the Erosion and
 Sediment Control Plan, and the Contractor’s SWMP. To accomplish this, the Project QCP
 duties include:

 8. Erosion and Sediment Control Crew.
 When required by the plans, the Contractor shall provide a full-time, dedicated Erosion
 and Sediment Control Crew. The crew shall be under the supervision of the Contractor QCP or
 superintendent, who shall be assisted by the Contractor QCIs. There will be no direct
 compensation for the Erosion and Sediment Control Crew.
 For all projects, the Contractor shall provide sufficient personnel and appropriate and
 sufficient equipment and materials on the project at all times to meet the daily erosion and
 sediment control plan implementation requirements. Additional personnel, equipment, and
 materials shall be readily available to assist with implementation of the weather
 preparedness and recovery plan within the timeframe allowed by the NPDES General Permit.
 Erosion and sediment control materials shall be stored on the project and protected from
 precipitation, runoff, and sunlight.
 9. Stormwater Meeting.
 A Stormwater Meeting shall be held after the preconstruction conference and prior to
 the beginning of work. The meeting shall convene at the project site. ALDOT construction
 personnel, including the Area Stormwater Coordinator and/or the Project QCP, the Project
 Manager, the Project QCI, the Contractor QCP (if applicable), the Contractor QCI, the
 Contractor’s superintendent and any subcontractors that will be involved in clearing,
 earthwork, seeding or erosion and sediment control operations shall attend. The ESCP, the
 CBMPP, the SWMP, clearing limits and sequence of construction shall be among the items
 discussed. Project discharge points, adjacent property and water bodies should be observed
 and discussed during the meeting. Any existing stormwater problems or issues should also be
 discussed and documented. The Contractor shall notify all subcontractors of the meeting and
 require their attendance. ALDOT will notify all applicable regulatory agencies.
 10. Limit Of Exposure Of Erodible Material.
 No more than 17 acres {7.0 ha} of erodible material shall be exposed at any time unless
 otherwise indicated on the plans by a project note that has been specifically approved by the
 State Construction Engineer. No increase in the limit of exposure will be considered after
 letting. If it is noted on the plans that the area of erodible material will be allowed to be
 greater than 17 acres {7.0 ha}, the Contractor shall include as part of the SWMP project
 specific details addressing management of the increased acreage during clearing and
 69
 
 SECTION 108
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 grubbing, excavation and embankment, vegetation establishment, temporary erosion and
 sediment control, drainage and construction of stormwater operations. Any approval to
 increase the area of exposure, including that shown on the plans, may be rescinded if the
 project is found by the Engineer to be noncompliant with the NPDES General Permit or
 environmental related contract requirements.
 All areas of exposed erodible material will be considered as contributing to the limit of
 exposure until final required stabilization is installed or applied and erosion is controlled to
 the maximum extent practicable. The Contractor may submit a request for review and
 approval by the State Construction Engineer to exclude areas of exposure which are outside
 of the control of the Contractor and have been temporarily stabilized.
 Requests for approval for unnecessary clearing may be considered only if provisions for
 erosion and sediment control are proposed to be implemented at the Contractor’s expense.
 
 (c) Notice of Intention to Start Work.
 The Contractor shall provide the Engineer written notice of his intention to start work at least
 72 hours in advance of beginning work and at least 24 hours in advance of beginning particular
 features of construction, such as driving piles, placing concrete, et cetera. Should prosecution of
 the work be discontinued by the Contractor with the consent of the Engineer, the Contractor shall
 give the Engineer at least 48 hours notice in writing before resuming operations.
 
 (d) Continuous Prosecution of the Work.
 The Contractor shall prosecute the work continuously and diligently in the order and manner
 set out in his schedule or prescribed by the Engineer. He shall provide sufficient satisfactory
 materials, labor, and equipment to guarantee the completion of the project in accordance with
 the plans and specifications within the time specified in the contract.
 Should the Contractor fail to maintain a satisfactory rate of progress, the Engineer will
 require that additional forces and equipment be placed on the work to bring the project up to
 schedule and maintain it at that level. Failure to maintain the quality and progress of the work
 shall be cause for the Engineer to withhold all estimates which are or may become due, until
 satisfactory quality and progress are maintained; or the contract may be defaulted as provided in
 Article 108.12.
 
 (e) Unsatisfactory Progress.
 Should the Contractor fail to maintain a satisfactory rate of progress in performance of the
 work, prior to expiration of the contract, the following regulation shall apply:
 After preparation of the Contractor's monthly estimate, the Department will review the
 progress of the work. The dollar amount of the work performed will be the total dollar amount
 that has been paid minus the dollar amount of partial payments for stored materials. The
 percentage of work performed will be based on the dollar amount of work performed and the total
 contract amount. This will be compared to the percentage of contract time elapsed. If the
 percentage of thework performed, as compared to the percent of contract time elapsed, is
 behind by more than 25 percentage points, a warning notice of possible disqualification will be
 sent to the Contractor by certified mail, return receipt requested (appropriate credit will be
 allowed for any extension previously approved in conformity with Article 108.09). The warning
 notice will describe the unsatisfactory progress revealed by the computation and that ten days will
 be allowed from the date of receipt of the warning in which to bring his progress within the
 allowed 25 percent, complete the project, or furnish acceptable reasons why the Contractor
 should not be given a final notice of disqualification. At the end of the 10-day period, if the
 Contractor's progress is not within the allowed percentage, nor has acceptable reason been
 furnished to waive final disqualification, the Department will issue a final notice of
 disqualification. 
 
 108.05 Limitation of Operation.
 The Contractor shall conduct the work at all times in such a manner and in such sequence as will
 insure the least interference with traffic. He shall have due regard to the location of detours and to
 the provisions for handling traffic. The Engineer may require the Contractor to finish a section on
 which work is in progress before work is started on any additional section if the opening of such section
 is essential to public convenience.
 
 70
 
 SECTION 108
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 
 108.06 Character of Workmen, Methods, and Equipment.
 The Contractor shall at all times employ sufficient labor and equipment for prosecuting the
 several classes of work to full completion in the manner and time required by these specifications.
 All workmen shall have sufficient skill and experience to perform properly the work assigned to
 them. Workmen engaged in special work or skilled work shall have sufficient experience in such work
 and in the operation of the equipment required to perform all work properly and satisfactorily.
 Any person employed by the Contractor or by any Subcontractor who, in the opinion of the
 Engineer, does not perform his work in a proper and skillful manner or is intemperate or disorderly
 shall, at the written request of the Engineer, be removed forthwith by the Contractor or Subcontractor
 employing such person, and shall not again be employed in any portion of the work without the
 approval of the Engineer.
 Should the Contractor fail to remove such person or persons as required above, or fail to furnish
 suitable and sufficient personnel for the proper prosecution of the work, the Engineer may suspend the
 work by written notice until compliance with such orders.
 All equipment which is proposed to be used on the work shall be of sufficient size and in such
 mechanical condition as to meet requirements of the work and to produce a satisfactory quality of
 work. Equipment used on any portion of the project shall be such that no injury to the roadway,
 adjacent property, or other highways will result from its use.
 When the methods and equipment to be used by the Contractor in accomplishing the construction
 are not prescribed in the contract, the Contractor is free to use any methods or equipment that he
 demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Engineer will accomplish the contract work in conformity with
 the requirements of the contract.
 When the contract specifies the use of certain methods and equipment, such methods and
 equipment shall be used unless others are authorized by the Engineer. If the Contractor desires to use
 a method or type of equipment other than those specified in the contract, he may request authority
 from the Engineer to do so. The request shall be in writing and shall include a full description of the
 methods and equipment proposed and the reasons for desiring to make the change. If approval is given,
 it will be on the condition that the Contractor will be fully responsible for producing work in
 conformity with contract requirements. If, after trial use of the substituted methods of equipment, the
 Engineer determines that the work produced does not meet contract requirements, the Contractor
 shall discontinue the use of the substitute method or equipment and shall complete the remaining
 construction with the specified methods and equipment. The Contractor shall remove the deficient
 work and replace it with work of specified quality, or take such other corrective action as the Engineer
 may direct. No change will be made in basis of payment for the construction items involved nor in
 contract time as result of authorizing a change in methods or equipment under these provisions.
 
 108.07 Temporary Suspension of Work.
 (a) Authority to Suspend.
 The Engineer shall have the authority to suspend the work wholly or in part by written order
 to the Contractor for such period or periods as he may deem necessary due to either of the
 following reasons:
 1. Failure on the part of the Contractor to carry out orders given or to perform any
 provision of the contract in which case time will be charged and no time extension will
 be granted, or
 2. Unsuitable weather or other essential conditions of a highly unusual or unpredictable
 nature which he considers unfavorable for the suitable prosecution of the work in which
 case either time charges will be suspended or a time extension will be granted.
 Upon suspension, the work shall be put in proper and satisfactory condition, carefully covered
 and properly protected, as directed by the Engineer. Reference is made to Article 105.13.
 
 (b) Legal Stoppage or Termination.
 Should the progress of the work be stopped by a temporary injunction, court restraining
 order, process of judgment of any kind directed to either of the parties hereto, then such period
 of delay will not be charged against the contract time. The State shall not be liable to the
 Contractor for the said legal delays of 120 calendar days or less, or for termination of the contract
 because of a legal order except as provided in Subarticle 108.14(b). Consideration will be given to
 properly documented added costs for a legal delay in excess of 120 calendar days, if submitted in
 accordance with Section 110, Claims. If a herein noted delay is of such duration as not to be in the
 71
 
 SECTION 108
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 best interest of the State, as determined by the Director, he may, by written order, terminate the
 contract in the same manner prescribed in Subarticle 108.14(c) for termination of a contract.
 
 (c) Automatic Time Suspension.
 Time will be suspended on calendar day projects during periods when no work can be
 performed on the project due to operational check periods or seasonal limitations when such
 periods are required by the specifications. Time will also be suspended for specification mandated
 curing periods for placement of permanent traffic stripe when all other work has been completed
 and the traveling public has full use of the highway.
 
 (d) Suspension Considerations.
 If the performance of all or any portion of the work is suspended or delayed by the Engineer
 in writing for an unreasonable period of time (not originally anticipated, customary, or inherent to
 the construction industry) and the Contractor believes that additional compensation and/or
 contract time is due as a result of such suspension or delay, the Contractor shall submit to the
 Engineer in writing a request for adjustment within seven calendar days of receipt of the notice to
 resume work. The request shall set forth the reasons and support for such adjustment.
 Upon receipt, the Engineer will evaluate the Contractor's request. If the Engineer agrees that
 the cost and/or time required for the performance of the contract has increased as a result of
 such suspension and the suspension was caused by conditions beyond the control of and not the
 fault of the Contractor, its suppliers, or subcontractors at any approved tier, and not caused by
 weather, the Engineer will make an adjustment (excluding profit) and modify the contract in
 writing accordingly. The Engineer will notify the Contractor of his determination whether or not
 an adjustment of the contract is warranted.
 No contract adjustment will be allowed unless the Contractor has submitted the request for
 adjustment within the time prescribed.
 No contract adjustment will be allowed under this clause to the extent that performance
 would have been suspended or delayed by any other cause, or for which an adjustment is provided
 for or excluded under any other term or condition of this contract.
 
 108.08 Determination of Contract Time.
 (a) General.
 The number of working days or calendar days allowed or the calendar date specified for
 completion of the work included in the contract will be fixed by the Department, will be stated in
 the proposal and contract, and will be designated as the contract time.
 
 (b) Beginning and End of Contract Time.
 Contract time charges shall begin when the Contractor begins work on a pay item or on
 incidental work that will interfere with traffic, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after
 date of issue of "notice to proceed." Time charges shall end upon satisfactory completion of all pay
 items in the contract.
 
 (c) Days Work Not Permitted.
 The Contractor shall not permit work on any pay item to be done on Sundays and the
 following holidays: National Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and
 Christmas Day, except with written permission of the Engineer.
 
 (d) Monthly Statement and Time Charges.
 1. Contracts on a Work Day Basis.
 For projects on a working day basis, the Engineer will furnish the Contractor a monthly
 time statement for the preceding month. This time statement will show the number of
 working days charged as outlined in the definition of Working Day in Subarticle 101.01(b), the
 number of working days in the contract, and the number of working days remaining to
 complete the contract.
 Under the provisions of Article 105.01, the Engineer will determine the controlling item
 or items of work based on consideration of the Contractor's approved Schedule of Operations
 and the operations that should be in progress at the time to provide for the orderly
 completion of the work within the contract time. Consideration to not charging time will be
 given when delays of six hours or more occur when the causes for delays may be due to, but
 not restricted to the following:

 1. Unavoidable causes beyond the control of the Contractor, without fault or
 negligence on his part.
 2. Contractor's proof (in form of letters from suppliers) of inability to obtain materials
 due to a regionwide shortage of such materials.
 3. Failure on the part of a utility company to diligently perform work not under the
 control of the Contractor.
 4. Acts of the Department.
 5. Recovery Time.
 6. Strikes.
 A working day will not be charged when the placement of hot mix asphalt is the
 controlling item of work and the start up operation is in an adjustment period unless the
 plant resumes production.
 Upon receiving the monthly time statement, the Contractor shall review the statement
 and compare the time charges with his records. If the Contractor disagrees with the time
 charges on the statement, he shall file a written protest setting forth the reasons why he
 considers the monthly time statement incorrect. The Contractor is encouraged to file any
 such protest as soon as possible after receiving the time statement.
 2. Contracts on a Calendar Day or Date Basis.
 For projects on a calendar day or calendar date basis a similar statement will be
 furnished the Contractor indicating the number of calendar days remaining in the contract.
 
 108.09 Extension of Contract Time.
 (a) General.
 An extension of contract time will be granted in the event the total cost of the completed
 work exceeds the total contract bid price. For the purpose of this item, the following costs will be
 excluded from the computation for total cost:
 • Supplemental agreements, regardless of whether or not time extensions are allowed
 on the agreements ;
 • Bituminous material price adjustments;
 • Adjustments due to the cost of construction fuel for HMA production;
 • Liquidated damages;
 • Incentive or disincentive payments;
 • Price adjustments for pavement smoothness;
 • Compensation for delay claims.
 • Overruns of pay items included in Sections 665 and 672.
 The extension of contract time shall be in the same ratio as the increase in the total cost.
 If the Contractor finds it impossible for reasons beyond his control to complete the work
 within the contract time as specified or as extended in accordance with the provisions of this
 Article, he may at any time prior to the expiration of the contract time as extended, make a
 written request to the Engineer for an extension of time setting forth therein the reasons which he
 believes will justify the granting of his request. The Contractor's plea that insufficient time was
 specified is not a valid reason for extension of time. If the Engineer finds that the work was
 delayed because of conditions beyond the control and without the fault of the Contractor, he may
 extend the time for completion in such amount as the conditions justify. The extended time for
 completion shall then be in full force and effect the same as though it were the original time for
 completion. If the Contractor disagrees with the decision of the Engineer, he may appeal directly,
 in writing, to the Director. The Director shall have final authority to approve or disapprove the
 request for an extension of time. The Director may, at his discretion, refer the appeal to the
 Claims Committee for a recommendation before making his decision. Reference is made to Section
 110, Claims. Time extension requests will not be referred to the Claims Appeal Board.
 
 (b) Contracts on a Working Day Basis.
 When the time set for completion of the work is a number of working days, extensions of
 contract time will be handled as outlined in Subarticle (a) above.
 
 73
 
 SECTION 108
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 
 (c) Contracts on a Calendar Day or Calendar Date Basis.
 When the time set for completion of the work is a number of calendar days or a calendar
 date, working days are not applicable. Extension of time beyond the said calendar days or date
 will be made as follows:
 When the notice to proceed is delayed more than 15 calendar days after execution of the
 contract, the date of completion will be extended the number of calendar days in excess
 of 15 days between the date of execution of the contract and the date of actual issuance
 of the notice to proceed.
 Where work is suspended by order of the Engineer due to no fault of the Contractor, and time
 is not suspended, a time extension will be granted for the number of calendar days the
 work is so suspended.
 A time extension will be granted as provided in Subarticle 107.08(b).
 A time extension will be granted as outlined in the first paragraph of Subarticle (a) above.
 The following are valid reasons for time extensions when delays due to these causes are
 considered by the Department of Transportation to be beyond the control of the Contractor:
 1. Utility Work being performed by others not under the Contractor's control that prohibit
 the Contractor's construction operations from proceeding with the normal working forces
 he would otherwise employ in performing the controlling item, or items, of work which
 normally would be in progress at the time said Utility work is being accomplished.
 2. Recovery time as defined in Article 101.01.
 3. If in the course of work material delivery time is in excess of that normally anticipated
 due to demands beyond the supplying industries' capabilities provided such materials are
 necessary for the prosecution of the controlling items of work at that time and such can
 be substantiated by the Contractor in the form of letters from suppliers, the Department
 will consider a time extension for the delay caused by the lack of available materials.
 4. If in the course of this project the Contractor feels he has been unjustly penalized
 because of delays in Departmental decisions, he may submit for consideration by the
 Engineer written specific data covering the item or items and the time element involved.
 The Department will consider only an extension for the actual work delay caused by the
 delay in obtaining a decision.
 5. If in the course of the work, strikes occur while the Contractor is working in good faith
 and such was not caused by action of the Contractor, the Department will consider a
 time extension for the delay caused by the strike.
 When allowing a time extension under the provisions noted in this Subarticle, consideration in
 determining the adjusted completion date for the work will be given to allow additional time to
 compensate for seasonal conditions, weather and other factors not under control of the
 Contractor. Should the Contractor, after exercising a concerted effort to diligently prosecute the
 work taking full advantage of every available work day, not be able to complete the work within
 the adjusted completion time because of non-availability of days in which work can be performed,
 the Department may consider an additional extension of time for the work.
 
 108.10 Failure to Complete Work Within Contract Time.
 Should the Contractor, or in case of default, the surety, fail to complete the work within the time
 stipulated in the contract or the adjusted time as granted under the provisions of Article 108.09, a
 deduction for each calendar day or work day that any work shall remain uncompleted, an amount
 indicated by the Liquidated Damages Schedule shown in Article 108.11 or provided in the contract
 documents shall be deducted from any monies due the Contractor on monthly estimates. Any
 adjustments due to approved time extensions or overruns in the contract amount will be made on the
 monthly, semi-final or final estimate as may be appropriate.
 Liquidated damages assessed as provided in these Specifications is not a penalty, but is intended
 to compensate the State for increased time in administering the contract, supervision, inspection and
 management, particularly that management and inspection which requires maintaining normal field
 project management forces for a longer time on any construction operation or phase than originally
 contemplated when the contract period was agreed upon in the contract.
 Permitting the Contractor to continue and finish the work or any part of it after the time fixed for
 its completion, or after the date to which the time for completion may have been extended, will in no
 way operate as a waiver on the part of the Department of any of its rights under the contract.

 108.12 Default of Contract.
 If the Contractor:
 1. Fails to begin the work under the contract within the time specified in the "Notice to
 Proceed," or
 2. Fails to perform the work with sufficient workmen and equipment or with sufficient materials
 to assure the prompt completion of said work, or
 3. Performs the work unsuitably or neglects or refuses to remove materials or to perform anew
 such work as may be rejected as unacceptable and unsuitable, or
 4. Discontinues the prosecution of the work, or
 5. Fails to resume work which has been discontinued within a reasonable time after notice to do
 so, or
 6. Becomes insolvent or is declared bankrupt, or commits any act of bankruptcy or insolvency,
 or
 7. Allows any final judgement to stand against him unsatisfied for a period of 10 days, or
 8. Makes an assignment without the consent of the surety and approval of the Department, or
 9. Fails to furnish documentation necessary for final acceptance and payment, or
 10. Fails to carry out provisions of the contract, or
 11. For any other cause whatsoever, fails to carry on the work in an acceptable manner,
 the Engineer will give notice in writing to the Contractor and his surety for such delay, neglect, or
 default.
 If the Contractor or surety, within a period of 10 days after such notice, does not proceed in
 accordance therewith, then the Department will, upon written notification from the Engineer of the
 fact of such delay, neglect or default and the Contractor's failure to comply with such notice, have full
 power and authority without violating the contract, to take the prosecution of the work out of the
 hands of the Contractor. The Department may appropriate or use any or all materials and equipment
 on the ground as may be suitable and acceptable and may enter into an agreement for the completion
 of said contract according to the terms and provisions thereof, or use such other methods as in the
 opinion of the Engineer will be required for the completion of said contract in an acceptable manner.
 All costs and charges incurred by the Department, together with the cost of completing the work
 under contract, will be deducted from any monies due or which may become due said Contractor. If
 such expense exceeds the sum which would have been payable under the contract, then the Contractor
 and the Surety shall be liable and shall pay to the Department the amount of such excess.
 Notice to the Contractor shall be deemed to be served when delivered to the person in charge of
 any office used by the Contractor, to his representative at or near the work, or by certified letter,
 return receipt requested, addressed to the Contractor at his last known place of business.
 In addition to the provisions provided in this Article, failure of the Contractor to sign the final
 estimate within the time limits prescribed in Subarticle 109.12(d) will be classified as a default.

 108.14 Termination of Contractor's Responsibility.
 (a) General.
 The Contract will be considered complete when all work has been finished, the final
 inspection made by the Engineer, the project accepted by the Department, the necessary
 advertisements published, all in accordance with the provisions of Article 105.15, and the final
 estimate paid. Upon completion of the above, the Contractor's responsibility will then cease,
 except as set forth in his bonds.
 
 (b) Special Conditions.
 Should the Department find that the Contractor is unable to complete his contract work due
 to the inability to obtain specified materials or satisfactory substitutes therefor or labor, because
 of laws, rules or regulations placed into effect or the inability of industry to produce specified
 materials within a reasonable time; the Director may, by written notice, relieve the Contractor
 from that portion of the contract which cannot be performed. Also, should the State determine
 that further prosecution of the work on a project will not be in the best interest of the public, the
 Director may, by written order, eliminate or delete any or all remaining items of work on a
 contract.
 The deletion or elimination of work under the above conditions will in no way affect the unit
 prices bid in the contract. Work actually performed will be paid for at the contract unit prices.
 Should relief from performance of the contract or any portion thereof directly cause the loss of
 any work or materials already furnished under the terms of the contract, the Contractor will be
 reimbursed for the actual cost of salvaging the materials or as mutually agreed to.
 Materials obtained by the Contractor, which have been inspected, tested and accepted by the
 Engineer but not incorporated into the work may, at the option of the Engineer, be purchased in
 accordance with the provisions of Article 109.06.
 If, by the deletion of work items, the volume of work completed is too small to compensate
 for the organization and moving of equipment to and from the work, consideration will be given to
 reimbursement for actual costs thereof; the intent being that an equitable settlement be made;
 compensation for this, however, shall not exceed the percentage differentiation between plan
 quantities and actual quantities performed, and if 75% of the estimated work was performed, no
 compensation for the organization and moving of equipment to and from the work will be allowed.
 In no event will a claim for loss of anticipated profits be considered. The deletion or elimination
 of work under the above conditions shall in no way relieve the Contractor from his responsibility
 for work actually performed nor any just claims as a result thereof.
 Final termination of the contract shall be as noted in Subarticle (a) above, for the work
 completed.
 
 (c) National Emergency.
 The Director may, by written order, terminate the contract or a portion thereof when the
 Contractor is prevented from proceeding with the construction contract as a direct result of an
 Executive Order of the President with respect to the prosecution of war or in the interest of
 national defense.
 When contracts, or any portion thereof, are terminated before completion of all items of
 work in the contract, payment will be made for the actual units or items of work completed at the
 contract unit price bid, or as mutually agreed for items of work partially completed or not started.
 No claim for loss of anticipated profits will be considered.
 Reimbursement for organization of the work and moving equipment to and from the job will
 be considered where the volume of work completed is small to compensate the Contractor for
 these expenses under the contract unit prices, the intent being that an equitable settlement will
 be made with the Contractor.
 Acceptable materials, obtained by the Contractor for the work, that have been inspected,
 tested, and accepted by the Engineer, and are not incorporated in the work may, at the option of
 the Engineer, be purchased from the Contractor in accordance with the provisions of Article
 109.06.
 Final termination of the contract shall be as noted in Subarticle (a) above, for the work
 completed.

 SECTION 109
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 
 SECTION 109
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 109.01 Measurement of Quantities.
 (a) General.
 All work acceptably completed under the contract will be measured by the Engineer
 according to United States Standard Measures and Weights, unless otherwise provided on the plans
 or in the special provisions. No local rules or customs will be followed or considered.
 When standard manufactured items are specified such as fence, wire, plates, rolled shapes,
 pipe conduit, lumber, etc., and these items are identified by gage, weight {mass}, section,
 dimensions, etc., such identification will be considered to be nominal weights {masses} and
 dimensions. Unless more stringently controlled by tolerances in cited specifications,
 manufacturing tolerances established by the industries involved will be accepted.
 
 (b) Base Layer and Pavement Areas.
 All longitudinal measurements for computing area of base layers and pavements will be made
 along the actual surface of the roadway and not horizontally and no deductions will be made for
 individual fixtures in the roadway having an area of nine square feet {one square meter} or less.
 For all transverse measurements for area of base layers and pavements, the dimensions to be used
 in calculating the pay area shall be the neat dimensions shown on the plans or directed.
 
 (c) Structures.
 Structures will be measured according to neat lines shown on the plans or as ordered in
 writing, unless otherwise provided elsewhere in the specifications or in the special provisions.
 
 (d) Excavation.
 In computing volume of excavation, embankment and borrow, the average end-area or other
 acceptable method will be used. It is stipulated and agreed that the electronic computer and/or
 planimeter shall be considered as instruments of precision adapted to the computation and
 measurement of these volumes and areas. Completed final cross sections and computed quantities
 will be made available to the Contractor upon request but shall not be removed from the
 Engineer's office.
 
 (e) Linear Measurements.
 All items which are measured in linear measurement by the foot {meter}, such as pipe
 culverts, guardrail, underdrains, etc., will be measured parallel to the base or foundation upon
 which such structures are placed, unless otherwise shown on the plans or indicated in these
 specifications.
 
 (f) Gage.
 The term "Gage", when used in connection with the measurement of plates, shall mean the
 U.S. Standard Gage; when used with wire, shall mean U.S. Steel wire gage.
 
 (g) Blank.
 (h) Weight {Mass} Measurements.
 1. General.
 The term "ton" shall mean the short ton {metric ton} consisting of 2,000 pounds
 avoirdupois {1000 kg}.
 Scales for measuring materials shall be furnished by the Contractor at agreed locations
 and without extra compensation. Scales shall be suitable for the type of service for which
 they are to be used and shall be operated by a competent, qualified operator. Scales for
 quarry run materials shall be sensitive to 20 pounds {10 kg}; all other scales shall be sensitive
 to 10 pounds {5 kg} or less. For items being paid for by the ton {metric ton}, weights {masses}
 may be recorded on the weight {mass} ticket to the nearest 20 pounds {10 kg} except that
 weights {masses} for quarry run materials may be recorded to the nearest 100 pounds {45 kg}.
 Electronic load cell weight {mass} systems shall be equipped with automatic zeroing
 devices. The maintenance tolerance of scales shall be 0.2 percent of the range in which they
 are to be used. The acceptance tolerance, applied to a new device or a device which has
 been condemned and repaired to be placed back in service, shall be 0.1 percent of the range
 in which they are to be used.
 77
 
 SECTION 109
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 Scales shall be checked and serviced by a reputable scales company registered with the
 Alabama Department of Agriculture. The time between checks shall not exceed four months,
 except that checks for scales used in proportioning the component materials for Portland
 cement concrete shall not exceed six months. In addition, any time a plant is moved or
 substantially modified, the scales shall be checked. A copy of the check shall be sent to the
 Area in which the scale is located. It is the Contractor's responsibility to maintain suitable
 acceptable scales and any time a check indicates the scales to be inaccurate, the Engineer
 will reject them for use on the project until such time as they are recertified. Weights
 {Masses} above the acceptable capacity of a set of scales will not be acceptable.
 2. Weight {Mass} Measure for Pay Purposes.
 If material is shipped by rail, the car weight {mass} may be accepted provided that only
 the actual weight {mass} of material is paid for and is certified by a car weight {mass}
 obtained from a certified scale after the unloading. However, car weights will not be
 accepted for steel reinforcement, structural steel or materials that are to pass through a
 mixing plant.
 Trucks used to haul material being paid by weight shall be measured empty daily, with
 the driver in the truck, to establish a daily tare weight. Each truck shall also bear a plain
 legible identification number.
 Commercial materials, except reinforcing steel and structural steel, which are measured
 by weight {mass} for pay purposes shall be measured by a qualified "Weighmaster*" using
 acceptable weight tickets. As a minimum, the weight ticket shall contain the following:
 1) Name of the Contractor and material producer.
 2) Project Number and County.
 3) Truck number.
 4) Contract item number and item name.
 5) Date and time of loading.
 6) Gross, tare, and net weights.
 7) Weighmaster’s signature. (May be electronically generated).
 8) Any additional information as required of the Contractor or material producer for
 participation as a Qualified Source as given in the Department’s “Materials,
 Sources and Devices with Special Acceptance Requirements” manual unless
 furnished on a separate applicable BMT Certificate of Compliance.
 For measurement systems capable of measuring net weight directly from the measuring
 hopper, the gross and tare weights will not be required. In lieu of bulk weight, the
 Department will accept weights of materials normally sold in bagged form (i.e. fertilizers,
 cement, etc.).
 The Engineer will make at least one unannounced independent weight check for every
 three months of operation with at least one per project for each material delivered under the
 weighmaster program. Each check will include a check of both the gross and the tare weights
 {masses}. For these weight checks, the Contractor shall make necessary arrangements,
 meeting the approval of the Engineer, for the use of independent scales certified in
 accordance with Item 109.01(h)1.
 It shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor to insure that a weight {mass} ticket
 is delivered to the project with each load. Weight tickets will not be accepted after the truck
 has left the project.
 *Weighmasters must be qualified in accordance with the provisions of Section 8, Chapter
 16, of the Code of Alabama, 1975, or in case of material purchased out of State complying
 with the appropriate State laws, rules and regulations for Weighmasters of the State involved.
 A copy of the "Weighmaster's Certificate" shall be furnished the Engineer and additionally a
 copy shall be displayed in a conspicuous place in the vicinity of the measuring operations.
 3. Weight {Mass} Measurement for Proportioning, etc. of Materials.
 Scales used for proportioning mixtures within mixing plants shall comply with the
 following unless otherwise noted:
 
 78
 
 SECTION 109
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 a. Asphalt Mixing Plants.
 Scales may be either springless dial, multiple beam, or electronic load cell type. For
 multiple beam scales, a tare beam for balancing and a telltale device for accurate
 measuring, visible to the plant inspector on the mixing platform, shall be provided.
 b. Concrete Mixing Plants or Units.
 For obtaining weight {mass} of materials at a central plant, beam, springless dial, or
 electronic load cell scales, suitable for this class of service, shall be used. Unless
 separate measuring units are used for each kind of material measured, the scales shall
 be equipped with a multiple measuring beam with enough beams so that the required
 weight {mass} of each material to be measured can be separately set off and all material
 measured without changing the settings. Separate scales shall be provided for bulk
 cement and for bulk fly ash, as provided in Article 815.11.
 Scales of the suspended hopper type shall have a telltale dial, tare beam, or other
 device that indicates to the operator the approach of not less than the last 50 pounds
 {25 kg} of the required hopper load for structure concrete plants or the last 200 pounds
 {90 kg} for concrete pavement plants. Telltale dials shall clearly show when overload is
 on the scale, and suitable provisions shall be made for disconnecting such dials, when
 necessary for balancing the scales and again connecting the dial without affecting the
 dead load balance.
 Dial faces shall be of a material not affected by moisture and shall have a suitable
 transparent protective cover for the dial face and dial indicator. An acceptable method
 of marking the correct dial indicator position when predetermined loads are in the
 hopper shall be provided. Plants with operational automatic cutoff devices shall be an
 acceptable substitute for providing markings for predetermined loads.
 For obtaining the weight {mass} of materials at the work site, scales shall be of
 appropriate capacity and shall meet the requirements noted above; however, for small
 structures in difficult locations use of platform scales suitable for measuring
 wheelbarrows will be permitted.
 Scales for obtaining the weight {mass} of wheelbarrows shall have beams so
 arranged that the weight {mass} of the wheelbarrow may be set separately from the
 weight {mass} of the material. Separate scales shall be used for each aggregate, for bulk
 cement and for fly ash, unless the multiple beam type is used, with a separate beam for
 each material and release levers to throw each beam out of service.
 Suspended hopper measuring equipment shall be of an approved type complying
 with the requirements of this Article.
 c. Base Course Mixing Plants.
 Measuring equipment shall meet the requirements of Subitem b. above with
 separate bins for each size aggregate and separate bins and scales for additives (calcium
 chloride, cement, etc.).
 
 (i) Loose Measurement (Volumetric).
 All materials to be measured by the cubic yard {cubic meter}, "loose measurement" or
 "measured in the vehicle", shall be hauled in approved vehicles and will be measured therein at
 the point of delivery. No allowances will be made for the settlement of material in transit.
 Approved vehicles for this purpose may be of any size or type acceptable to the Engineer,
 provided that the body is of such shape that the actual contents may be readily and accurately
 determined. Each approved vehicle must bear a plainly legible identification mark indicating the
 specific approved capacity. All approved vehicles shall be loaded to not less than their water level
 capacity when they arrive at the point of delivery. Loads not hauled in approved vehicles or of a
 quantity less than the specifically approved quantity for the hauling vehicle, measured as
 specified herein, will be rejected and shall be removed from the work. If rejected, no
 compensation will be allowed for the rejected load.
 
 (j) Conversion of Weight {Mass} to Volume.
 When requested by the Contractor and approved in writing, material specified to be
 measured by the cubic yard {cubic meter} may have its weight {mass} determined and such weight
 {mass} will be converted to cubic yards {cubic meters} for payment purposes. Ratios for conversion
 from weight {mass} measurement to volume measurement will be determined periodically by the
 79
 
 SECTION 109
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 Engineer. Each ratio as determined shall be agreed to by the Contractor before such method of
 measurement will be used.
 
 (k) Timber.
 Timber will be measured by the thousand feet board measure (MBM) {cubic meter} actually
 incorporated in the structure with no allowance for any waste except beveled ends. Measurement
 will be based on nominal widths and thickness and the extreme length of each piece.
 
 (l) Lump Sum.
 The term "lump sum" when used as an item of payment will mean complete payment for the
 work described in the contract.
 When a complete structure or structural unit (in effect, "lump sum" work) is specified as the
 unit of measurement, the unit will be construed to include all necessary fittings and accessories.
 
 109.02 Measurement of Asphaltic Material.
 (a) Weight {Mass}.
 Asphaltic materials shall be measured in tons {metric tons} or gallons {liters} as specified on
 the plans or in the proposal. If measured by weight {mass}, each tank truck, drum or distributor
 shall have its weight {mass} obtained as the material is delivered to the location of the work, and
 the container vehicle shall have its weight {mass} obtained immediately after emptying; except
 that when this method cannot be used other means of accurately measuring the material may be
 substituted with permission of the Engineer.
 
 (b) Gallonage {Liters}.
 When specified on the plans or in the proposal, bituminous material will be measured by the
 gallon {liter} in the railroad car, tank truck, distributor tank, or drums. Each railroad tank, tank
 truck, drum or distributor tank of bituminous material delivered for the project will be measured.
 The measurement shall be taken when the bituminous material is of a uniform temperature and
 free from air bubbles.
 
 (c) Temperature Correction.
 The volumetric measurement of the bituminous material will be based upon a temperature of
 60 °F {16 °C}, using the following correction factors:
 0.00035 per degree F {0.00063 per degree C} for petroleum oils having a specific gravity
 above 0.966 at 60 °F/60 °F {16 °C/16 °C};
 0.00040 per degree F {0.00072 per degree C} for petroleum oils having a specific gravity
 between 0.850 and 0.966 at 60 °F/60 °F {16 °C/16 °C};
 0.00025 per degree F {0.00045 per degree C} for emulsified asphalts.
 
 109.03 Scope of Payment.
 (a) Quantities.
 The quantities listed in the bid schedule do not govern final payment. Payments to the
 Contractor for contract items will be made for the actual quantities of these items performed in
 accordance with the plans and specifications. If upon completion of the construction these actual
 quantities show an increase or decrease from those in the proposal, the contract unit prices will
 still govern except where modified by supplemental agreement or allowance made as provided in
 Articles 104.02 and 104.03. Quantities included in supplemental agreements will be paid for as
 stipulated therein. Force account work will be paid for as provided in Article 109.04.
 
 (b) Basis of Payment.
 The Contractor shall accept the compensation as herein provided, in full payment for
 furnishing all materials, labor, tools, equipment and incidentals necessary to the completed work
 and for performing all work contemplated and embraced under the contract; also for all loss or
 damage arising from the nature of the work, or from the action of the elements except as noted in
 Article 107.17, or from any unforeseen difficulties which may be encountered during the
 prosecution of the work and until its final acceptance; also for all risks of every description
 connected with the prosecution of the work.
 
 (c) Unit Price Coverage.
 In cases where the basis of payment clause in the specifications relating to any unit price in
 the bid schedule requires that the said unit price cover and be considered compensation for
 certain work or materials essential to the item, this same work or materials will not be measured
 80
 
 SECTION 109
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 or paid for under any other pay item which may appear elsewhere in the specifications. Reference
 is made to Item 101.01(c)1.
 
 (d) Repair or Renewal of Defective Work.
 The payment of any current estimate shall in no way affect the obligation of the Contractor
 to repair or renew any defective parts of the construction or to be responsible for all damages due
 to such defects.
 
 (e) Bituminous Material Price Adjustments.
 1. Asphalt Index.
 The contract unit prices for bituminous materials shall be based on the asphalt prices at
 the time of opening bids. The Department will establish a monthly "Asphalt Index" to address
 fluctuations in the cost of the bituminous materials during the life of the project.
 The index will be composed of the following four entries:
 • PG Asphalt (for all grades without polymer);
 • PG Asphalt with Polymer (for all grades with polymer);
 • Emulsified Asphalt (for all grades without polymer and cutback asphalts);
 • Emulsified Asphalt with Polymer (for all grades with polymer).
 2. Usage and Payment.
 Adjustments in compensation will be computed each month that bituminous materials
 are used in the work. Bituminous plant mix bases and pavements, surface treatments and
 tack coat are the only types of bituminous materials for which a price adjustment will be
 computed. Adjustments in compensation will be based on an index that is a monthly price per
 gallon for the bituminous material.
 Before the expiration of contract time (plus approved time extensions) the dollar amount
 of adjustment will be determined by multiplying the increase or decrease of the current
 (current estimate month) index from a "base index" by the number of gallons of bituminous
 material used in the work during the period covered by the monthly estimate. The base index
 will be the value of the index for the month in which the project is let. This same index will
 apply to bituminous materials added to the contract by supplemental agreement after
 letting.
 After the expiration of contract time (plus approved time extensions) two calculations of
 a potential price adjustment will be made. The first calculation will be made using the
 current index and the base index. The second calculation will be made using the index during
 the month that contract time (plus approved time extensions) expired and the base index.
 The amount of the price adjustment for the current estimate period will be the smallest
 amount of an increase in compensation if both calculations are an increase in compensation.
 The amount of the price adjustment will be the largest amount of a decrease in compensation
 if both calculations are a decrease in compensation. The amount of the price adjustment will
 be the decrease in compensation if one of the calculations is an increase in compensation and
 the other calculation is a decrease in compensation.
 The amount of asphalt will be calculated as follows:
 • Bituminous Plant Mix Bases and Pavements - the number of gallons {liters} of new
 bituminous material required by the approved job mix formula. A conversion factor
 of 8.51 pounds per gallon {1.02 kg/L} will be used for figuring quantities. No
 measurement for adjustment will be made for the amount of asphalt rejuvenator
 used or for the amount of bituminous material recovered and used in surface
 recycling operations.
 • Surface Treatments - actual gallons {liters} of asphalt used within specification
 requirements with volumetric correction to 60 °F {16 °C} as per Subarticle 109.02(c).
 • Tack Coat - actual gallons {liters} of asphalt used within specification requirements
 with volumetric correction to 60 °F {16 °C} as per Subarticle 109.02(c).
 
 (f) Adjustments Due to Cost of Construction Fuel for HMA Production.
 Changes in the compensation due the Contractor will be made by the Engineer to address
 changes in the cost of fuel required for the production of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) in a plant. The
 changes in compensation will be made based on a monthly index of the cost of fuel determined by
 the Department.
 81
 
 SECTION 109
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 A monthly HMA production fuel index will be established based on the average area terminal
 price reports for No. 2 fuel and No. 6 (3.0 % S) fuel of the "Platts Oilgram Price Report" published
 during the week in which the first day of the month occurs.
 Before the expiration of contract time (plus approved time extensions) the dollar amount of
 adjustment will be determined by multiplying the increase or decrease of the current (current
 estimate month) index from the base index by the number of gallons of fuel that are used in the
 production of the HMA during the period covered by the monthly estimate. The number of gallons
 of fuel required for the production of the HMA shall be 2.0 gallons per ton {8.3 L per metric ton} of
 HMA produced during the estimate period. The base index will be the value of the index for the
 month in which the project is let.
 After the expiration of contract time (plus approved time extensions) two calculations of a
 potential price adjustment will be made. The first calculation will be made using the current
 index and the base index. The second calculation will be made using the index during the month
 that contract time (plus approved time extensions) expired and the base index. The amount of the
 price adjustment for the current estimate period will be the smallest amount of an increase in
 compensation if both calculations are an increase in compensation. The amount of the price
 adjustment will be the largest amount of a decrease in compensation if both calculations are a
 decrease in compensation. The amount of the price adjustment will be the decrease in
 compensation if one of the calculations is an increase in compensation and the other calculation is
 a decrease in compensation.
 Changes in compensation will be made for the number of tons {metric tons} of HMA placed
 and paid for in accordance with the requirements given in the following Sections:
 Section 327, Plant Mix Bituminous Base;
 Section 404, Paver-Laid Surface Treatment;
 Section 420, Polymer Modified Open Graded Friction Course;
 Section 423, Stone Matrix Asphalt;
 Section 424, Superpave Bituminous Concrete Base, Binder, and Wearing Surface Layers.
 
 109.04 Extra and Force Account Work.
 (a) General.
 The Contractor will receive and accept payment for work performed under his contract either
 as contract items of work or as extra work. Contract items of work will be paid for at the unit
 prices stipulated in the contract. Extra work will be paid for at the unit prices or lump sum
 stipulated in supplemental agreement, or on a force account basis. Supplemental agreements shall
 be executed in accordance with Subarticle 104.03(b). When prices are negotiated for payment by
 supplemental agreement, satisfactory proof of administrative markups for profit, overhead, and
 other costs may be required by the engineer. Extra work performed on a force account basis will
 be compensated for in the following manner.
 
 (b) Force Account Basis.
 1. Labor.
 For all labor, foremen, and superintendents, employed on the force account work, the
 Contractor shall receive the agreed hourly wages or scale for the number of hours the said
 laborers, foremen, and superintendents were actually engaging in or directly supervising such
 work. No allowance will be made for general superintendence. Hourly wages for salaried
 employees will be based on a 40-hour work week. The wages or scale shall be comparable to
 the wages or scale paid by the Contractor for work of a like nature on his contract pay items
 and shall be agreed upon in writing by the Contractor and Engineer before the said force
 account work is begun.
 To this sum shall be added an amount equal to 25 percent thereof.
 No additional pay beyond the agreed hourly scale will be allowed for "overtime work"
 unless such overtime work is authorized in writing by the Engineer.
 Labor costs will be allowed for travel time to and from the jobsite when that travel is
 specifically for the purpose of accomplishing force account work. Travel time shall be
 established and approved by the Engineer prior to beginning of the work. Travel time costs
 shall be validated with certified payrolls.
 
 82
 
 SECTION 109
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 Per diem or daily subsistence will be allowed when those costs are directly related to
 force account work and a part of the Contractor’s usual and customary expenses. An
 additional 5 percent will be added to the per diem or daily subsistence costs.
 2. Bond, Insurance and Tax.
 For public liability and property damage insurance and workmen's compensation
 insurance premiums, increased bond premiums, unemployment insurance contributions and
 social security taxes, the Contractor shall receive the actual cost, to which no percent shall
 be added; in addition on projects which the State Gross Receipt Tax is applicable, may
 include said tax. The Contractor shall furnish satisfactory evidence of the rates paid for such
 bond, insurance, and tax.
 3. Materials.
 For materials accepted by the Engineer and used, the Contractor shall receive the actual
 cost of such materials delivered on the work (exclusive of machinery rentals as herein set
 forth) to which cost 15% will be added.
 4. Equipment.
 For rental rates of equipment (other than small tools) authorized by the Engineer for use
 on force account work, the Engineer will use the latest publication of EquipmentWatch Cost
 Recovery (formerly Rental Rate Blue Book), by EquipmentWatch, a division of Penton Business
 Media, Incorporated to determine payment to the Contractor. Payment will be made for the
 actual time that the authorized equipment is in operation on the force account work,
 including travel time to and from the jobsite, when that travel is specifically for the purpose
 of accomplishing force account work. The hourly rate for each piece of equipment will be the
 monthly rate shown in the equipment table divided by 176. Weekly and daily rates will not be
 used. In addition, for equipment solely dedicated to the force account work, consideration
 will be given to paying standby cost. Operating rates and standby rates for computing the
 equipment payment will be determined as follows:
 Operating rates. The hourly rate will be multiplied by the appropriate rate adjustment
 factor and regional factor shown in the Rate Adjustment Table and on the Regional
 Adjustment Map, respectively, to obtain the adjusted hourly rate. The estimated
 operating cost/hour from the equipment table will be added to the adjusted hourly
 rate to establish the operating rate.
 Standby rates. The use of a standby rate is appropriate when equipment has been
 ordered to be available for force account work but is idle for reasons which are not
 the fault of the Contractor. The standby rate will be determined by multiplying the
 adjusted hourly rate by 0.50.
 Operating rates will be used only when the equipment is actually being used. Standby
 rates will be used under the following conditions:
 a. The equipment must be totally dedicated to the force account work and not used
 intermittently on other work.
 b. Standby cost will not be considered until after the equipment has been operated on
 the force account work.
 c. If the equipment is dedicated for force account for a full calendar work week, the
 standby time will be 40 hours minus the operating time for the week. If the
 difference in these two figures is zero or less, there will be no payment for standby.
 d. If the equipment is dedicated for force account for a partial week, the standby time
 will be computed on a daily basis. The standby time per day will be 8 hours minus
 the operating time for the day. If the difference in these two figures is zero or less,
 there will be no payment for standby.
 The above will apply without further adjustment if overtime work is approved by the
 Engineer.
 The above shall be full compensation for all equipment costs except operator cost.
 Payment for operators will be under Item 109.04(b)1, Labor.
 If equipment is required that is not listed in the Rental Rate Blue Book, then payment
 will be made for that equipment based on a certified or paid invoice for the period of time
 covered by the invoice. In this case, the equipment must be totally dedicated to the force
 account work and no distinction will be made between operating cost and standby cost. If this
 83
 
 SECTION 109
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 equipment is owned by the Contractor, then rental rates for operating and standby costs shall
 be agreed upon between the Contractor and Engineer prior to its use.
 5. Professional Services
 Compensation for professional services shall be on an invoice basis. Labor and
 equipment costs will not be calculated separately for professional services.
 6. Costs Not Allowed.
 No allowance shall be made for general superintendence, the use of small tools, or other
 costs for which no specific allowance is herein provided.
 7. Administrative Allowance.
 When force account work is accomplished by an approved subcontractor or professional
 service, the Contractor shall receive, as compensation for administration costs, an amount
 equal to five percent of the total amount paid under items 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this Subarticle for
 force account work accomplished by an approved subcontractor or professional service.
 8. Compensation.
 The compensation as set forth in this Subarticle shall be received by the Contractor as
 payment in full for extra work done on a force account basis. Said compensation shall cover
 all work, profit, administrative costs, and incidental costs of whatever nature incurred in the
 work whether performed by the Prime Contractor or an approved subcontractor. At the end
 of each day, the Contractor's representative and the Inspector shall compare records of the
 cost of work done as ordered on a force account basis.
 9. Statements.
 No payment will be made for work performed on a force account basis until the
 Contractor has furnished to the Engineer duplicate itemized statements of the cost of such
 force account work, detailed as to the following:
 a. Name, classification, date, daily hours, total hours, rate, and extension for each
 laborer and foreman.
 b. Designation, dates, daily hours, total hours, rental rate and extension for each truck
 and other unit of machinery and equipment.
 c. Quantities of materials, prices, and extensions.
 d. Transportation of materials.
 e. Travel time for equipment.
 f. Cost of public liability and property damage insurance and workmen's compensation
 insurance premiums, increased bond premiums, unemployment insurance
 contributions, and social security tax.
 Statements shall be accompanied and supported by original receipted invoices for all
 materials used and transportation charges, provided that, if materials used on the force
 account work are not specifically purchased for such work but are taken from the Contractor's
 stock, then in lieu of the original invoices the statements shall contain or be accompanied by
 an affidavit of the Contractor certifying that such materials were taken from his stock, that
 the quantity claimed was actually used, and that the price and transportation claimed
 represent the actual cost to the Contractor.
 
 109.05 Compensation for Altered Quantities.
 When the accepted quantities of work vary from the quantities in the bid schedule, the
 Contractor shall accept as payment in full, so far as contract items are concerned, payment at the
 original contract unit prices for the actual quantities of work done. No allowance or other adjustment,
 except as provided in Article 104.02, will be made for any increased expense, loss of expected
 reimbursement, or loss of anticipated profits suffered or claimed by the Contractor resulting either
 directly from such alterations or indirectly from unbalanced allocation among the contract items of
 overhead expense on the part of the bidder and subsequent loss of expected reimbursement therefor
 or from any other cause.
 Additional work caused by alterations of plans or changes in character of work will be paid for by
 supplemental agreement or on a force account basis.
 
 84
 
 SECTION 109
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 
 109.06 Omitted Items and Cancelled Work.
 (a) Elimination of Items.
 Should any items contained in the proposal be found unnecessary for the proper completion
 of the work contracted, the Engineer may eliminate such items from the contract, and such action
 shall in no way invalidate the contract and no allowance will be made for items so eliminated in
 making final payment to the Contractor except for such actual work as may have been done,
 materials actually purchased and bona fide equipment costs incurred for such eliminated item
 prior to notification of the elimination of the items.
 
 (b) Unused Materials.
 For materials ordered and delivered for the unfinished portion of such cancelled or omitted
 items, the State will pay actual certified cost (material and handling or transporting cost) plus
 fifteen percent for both overhead and gross receipt tax charges; no anticipated profit will be
 considered. Material paid for shall become the property of the State and shall be disposed of as
 directed by the Engineer.
 
 109.07 Partial Payment.
 Once each month the Engineer will make an appropriate estimate on the regulation form of the
 work or portion of the work completed and the value thereof based on the contract Unit Prices, or
 proportional part thereof for Lump Sum items, less any assessed liquidated damages or other
 designated deductions.
 This estimate may, if requested in writing by the Contractor and approved by the Engineer,
 include cost of certain commercial non-perishable items such as, but not limited to, base aggregates,
 reinforcing steel, bridge piling, structural steel, prefabricated bridge components, traffic signal
 equipment, electrical equipment, fencing materials, sign materials and others as may be authorized by
 the Engineer within the following limitations:
 1. The location of the storage site shall be at the project site or other designated location in the
 vicinity of such construction whenever practical. Off-site storage may be approved if the
 Engineer considers off-site storage to be more practical. In either case, all conditions of this
 Article concerning stored (stockpiled) material shall be met. Departmental Form C-21 will be
 used to document all payments for stored material.
 2. All material approved for payment in storage must be manufactured for specific use on the
 project. It shall be stored in accordance with good construction practices, and shall be
 separated from other materials where it can be inventoried at any time. No payment will be
 made on any material which does not conform with the requirements of the plans and
 specifications. The Contractor will be responsible for the security of all storage sites.
 3. An individual payment and the accumulated payment, unless otherwise provided under a
 specific item of work, shall be the smaller of the following two dollar amounts:
 •
 
 4.
 
 5.
 
 100% of the certified invoice cost (including applicable taxes) plus gross receipts tax for
 the materials actually delivered to the approved storage site or;
 • 75% of total bid price for the item of which the material is a part.
 An invoice or an accumulation of invoices for each eligible pay item must total $2,500 or
 more before consideration will be given for making partial payment. All invoices shall be
 certified by the Contractor or the supplier of the material. The certification shall be shown
 on the invoice and shall read as follows: "I do hereby certify that this is a true and correct
 invoice." This wording shall be followed by the signature of an authorized representative of
 the Contractor or the supplier.
 After payments are placed on monthly estimates, the Contractor shall furnish the Project
 Manager with copies of certified paid invoices from the suppliers of the materials. The
 certification shall be shown on each invoice and shall read as follows: "I do hereby certify
 that this is a true and correct invoice and has been paid." This wording shall be followed by
 the signature of an authorized representative of the supplier. Failure to furnish these
 certified paid invoices within thirty (30) days from the date of issuance of the monthly
 payment (check) covering the estimate for which the payment of materials was made by the
 State will result in the deletion of the payment from the next estimate following the
 expiration of said 30-day period.
 As stockpiled materials are incorporated into the work, proportional deductions will be made
 in the monthly estimate for such partial payments.
 85
 
 SECTION 109
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 6. Partial payment for materials on hand will not constitute acceptance and any faulty material
 will be rejected even though previous payment may have been made. The Contractor shall be
 solely responsible for furnishing and incorporating acceptable materials into the work and for
 any loss or damage regardless of the cause, for any material on which partial payment is
 made.
 7. Transportation charges for delivery of eligible materials to the approved storage site may be
 included in partial payments for stockpiled materials if properly documented. Such charges
 may be included in the materials invoice or handled as a separate invoice, whichever is
 appropriate.
 The estimate, less any payments previously made, will be certified by the Director for payment
 provided progress and quality of work is satisfactory and in conformity with Subarticle 108.04(b).
 No monthly payment will be required to be made when the amount due on the project is less than
 $2,500. A statement of any sum due the State or County for equipment, labor, or supplies furnished
 under the provisions of these Specifications will be furnished along with the estimate and the amount
 of same will be deducted from the estimate before payment is made by the State.
 The payment of any monthly estimate for any portion of the work as provided in the Specifications
 shall in no way affect the obligation of the Contractor to complete the work in accordance with the
 contract
 
 109.08 Payments to Subcontractors.
 Retainage shall not be withheld from payments owed to subcontractors or lower tier
 subcontractors.
 The Prime Contractor shall make payment to all subcontractors, for the portion of the work
 satisfactorily performed by the subcontractors, within 7 calendar days, not counting Saturdays and
 Sundays, of the Contractor's receipt of a partial payment from the ALDOT.
 The Prime Contractor shall submit to the Project Manager a notarized certification of payment
 signed by an authorized company representative, for each estimate period. This certification shall read
 "Company's Name paid all subcontractors active on the project for Estimate Period No.
 within 7
 calendar days, not counting Saturdays and Sundays, of the receipt of the partial payment covering said
 estimate period." The certification shall be submitted within sixty calendar days of the close of the
 estimate period for which it applies. Failure to furnish the certification in a timely manner may result
 in the withholding of further monthly payments or other punitive action until the delinquent
 certifications have been submitted. Should an ALDOT audit reveal that the Contractor did not make
 payments as stated in the certification, ALDOT will take punitive action against the Contractor. This
 action may include disqualification from bidding for a minimum period of six months.
 
 109.09 Payment for Work.
 Payment for work will be made by the State by warrants drawn against State funds that are legally
 available for such work.
 All monies payable under the contract, or any part thereof, will be paid to the Contractor in
 accordance with the provisions of these specifications, and no assignment or order executed by the
 Contractor directing payment of any portion or all of such funds to any other person or persons will be
 recognized by the State unless such assignment or order specifies the amount to be so paid and the
 purposes for which the assignment or order is given. Such assignment or order shall have attached
 thereto, by endorsement or otherwise, the consent of the surety. No such assignment or order will be
 binding on the State.
 
 109.10 Disputed Claims for Extra Compensation.
 Claims shall be handled as provided in Section 110, Claims.
 
 109.11 Time Limit for Final Adjustment.
 It is understood that the Director will not be bound to consider applications for correction of
 estimates and payments, including assessed liquidated damages, after the Contractor has signed his
 final estimate, or after 30 days from the date when the final estimate is submitted to the Contractor
 for his signature or approval, unless in the latter case the Contractor submits written request within
 the 30-day period for adjustment of estimates and payment, including assessed liquidated damages.
 
 86
 
 SECTION 109
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 
 109.12 Final Payment.
 (a) Final Quantities.
 Within 60 calendar days after the final inspection as outlined in Article 105.15, the Engineer
 will prepare the list of final quantities for the various items of work performed. The Engineer will
 submit by certified letter, return receipt requested, the list of final quantities to the Contractor
 for his review and concurrence.
 The Contractor will have 45 calendar days from the date of receipt to submit either written
 concurrence of the final quantities or a written statement of disagreement. The written statement
 of disagreement shall contain a list, item by item, of the quantities that the Contractor does not
 agree with and his reasons for disagreement on each item's final quantity. Failure by the
 Contractor to furnish the written statement within 45 calendar days shall be prima facie evidence
 that the Contractor considers the submitted final quantities to be satisfactory and waives any
 further consideration of the final quantities.
 Upon notice from the Contractor of a dispute in quantities, the Engineer will promptly
 attempt to resolve the differences. If the Engineer is not able to reach an agreement with the
 Contractor the matter will be referred to the Director for resolution. The Director may refer the
 dispute to the Claims Committee for a recommendation before making a final decision. Issues of
 disputed quantities will not be referred to the Claims Appeal Board.
 If the Contractor requests the Department to make a resurvey which will require additional
 field and/or office work, the Director may grant the request with the understanding that the
 Contractor will be paid the final survey and/or computed quantities whether they be more or less
 than the original final quantities. If a resurvey is made at the Contractor's request, the Contractor
 and the Department shall share equally the additional cost of the resurvey and the Contractor's
 portion of this cost will be deducted from the final estimate.
 
 (b) Claims.
 All claims for extra compensation will be handled in accordance with Section 110, Claims.
 
 (c) Final Estimate Documentation.
 Prior to submission of the final estimate voucher to the Contractor for his signing, the
 Contractor shall furnish the following documentation, as applicable:
 1. A non-resident contractor must provide a certified "statement of good standing" from the
 State Department of Revenue and the appropriate County and/or City authority. This
 statement certifies that the non-resident contractor had paid all taxes due and payable
 to the State of Alabama or any political subdivision thereof. See Section 39-2-12 of the
 Alabama Code.
 2. Proof of publication of advertisement of project completion as per Item 105.15(c).
 3. A signed affidavit attesting that all known debts for labor and materials used on the
 project and all approved subcontractual obligations associated with the construction of
 the project have been paid or will be paid within 5 days after final payment. The
 affidavit shall be on a standard form furnished by the Department.
 Failure by the Contractor to furnish any of the above documentation will be cause for the
 Engineer to declare the Contractor to be in default as per Article 108.12.
 
 (d) Payment.
 Upon resolution of the final quantities, all claims, and receipt of the above listed
 documentation, and written notice of final acceptance, the final estimate voucher will be
 prepared taking into consideration all prior partial payments. The Engineer will submit by certified
 letter, return receipt requested, the final estimate voucher to the Contractor for his signing. The
 Contractor shall have 30 calendar days after receipt of the voucher to sign and return the same for
 processing for final payment. Should the Contractor fail to sign and return the voucher within the
 30 days, he will be declared in default in accordance with Paragraph 5 of Article 108.12.
 Upon receipt of the signed final estimate voucher or default action taken per Paragraph 5 of
 Article 108.12, the Department will issue a warrant in the amount due the Contractor. The final
 warrant will be issued to the Surety in cases where the Contractor is placed in default under
 Article 108.12 and the contract is placed in the hands of the Surety. By agreement it is hereby
 stipulated that the Contractor and the Surety are forever barred and estopped from any recovery
 of claims whatsoever against the Department under the terms of the contract.

 SECTION 110
 CLAIMS
 
 SECTION 110
 CLAIMS
 110.01 General.
 When filing a claim, the Contractor shall follow the procedures set forth in this Section.
 
 110.02 Notice of Intent.
 In any case where the Contractor deems that extra compensation is due him for additional cost
 not clearly covered in his contract and not ordered by the Engineer as extra work as defined herein,
 the Contractor shall notify the Project Manager in writing, with copy to the Construction Engineer, of
 his intention to make claim for such extra compensation.
 The written notice of intent shall be furnished to the Engineer prior to the time the contested
 work is started. Oral notification by the Contractor and confirmed in writing by the Contractor within
 three calendar days, will be accepted as complying with this requirement.
 The written notice of intent shall set forth the reasons the Contractor believes additional
 compensation will be due, the nature of cost involved and insofar as possible the total amount of the
 claim.
 The Contractor hereby agrees to waive any claim for additional compensation if notification, as
 provided in the foregoing, is not furnished or the Engineer is not provided facilities by the Contractor
 for keeping account of actual costs.
 Such notice by the Contractor, and the fact that the Engineer has kept account of the cost as
 aforesaid, is not evidence of the validity of the claim. A separate determination of the validity of the
 claim will be made by the ALDOT.
 
 110.03 Record Keeping.
 After giving the ALDOT a notice of intent to file a claim, the Contractor shall keep daily records of
 all costs incurred for affected operations. These daily records shall identify each operation affected,
 the specific locations where work is affected, and the potential effect to the project’s schedule. The
 ALDOT's Project Manager will also keep records of all labor, material, and equipment applicable to
 affected operations. On Monday, or the first work day, of each week following the date of the notice of
 intent to file a claim, the Contractor shall provide the ALDOT’s Project Manager with the daily records
 for the preceding week. If the Contractor's records indicate costs greater than those kept by the
 ALDOT, the ALDOT will meet with the Contractor and present its records to the Contractor at the
 meeting. The Contractor shall notify the Engineer in writing within three work days of any inaccuracies
 noted in, or disagreements with, the ALDOT's records. The Engineer will review the matter, correct any
 inaccuracies he finds in the ALDOT’s records, and notify the Contractor in writing of his decision.
 Refusal or failure by the Contractor to attend the aforementioned meetings and present his
 records shall constitute a waiver by the Contractor of his claim.
 To protect the integrity of the independent records maintained by ALDOT for comparison with
 those submitted by the contractor, ALDOT records, other than those mentioned above, will not be
 made available to the Contractor until after ALDOT’S receipt of the Contractor’s complete records
 documenting the claim, ALDOT will retain possession of the records and provide copying facilities with
 the contractor reimbursing the ALDOT for the expense of the copying. No amendment to the claim shall
 be made following receipt of the ALDOT’s records.
 
 110.04 Claims Process.
 (a) General.
 After the work has been completed on the disputed item(s) of work, the Contractor shall have
 90 calendar days to submit his claim. Any claim not submitted within this 90 calendar day period is
 waived. The Contractor shall submit six copies of the claim, containing the required
 documentation listed in Article 110.03, to the Project Manager. Once the claim is received, a joint
 review of the claim will be made by the Area and the Construction Bureau and a written response
 to the Contractor will be made within 90 calendar days. If the Contractor does not agree with this
 decision, he may request to make a presentation to the Claims Committee. This written request,
 along with six additional copies of the original claim, shall be made to the Project Manager, by
 certified mail, within 30 calendar days from the date of the ALDOT’s response. Failure to make
 
 88
 
 the request within the required time period shall constitute
 Contractor.
 
 SECTION 110
 CLAIMS
 waiver of the claim by the
 
 (b) Claims Committee.
 The Claims Committee will be composed of ALDOT employees, appointed by the Director,
 who were not involved in the design or construction of the project. For Federal Aid projects, the
 FHWA will be invited to send an observer. The presentation will convene at the mutual
 convenience of the ALDOT and the Contractor. Issues not specifically presented in the claim
 package acted upon by the Construction Bureau and the Area are not subject to consideration by
 the Claims Committee. Following the presentation, the Claims Committee will provide a written
 recommendation to the Director. The Claims Committee's recommendation may be accepted,
 modified or denied by the Director. If accepted, the Director's decision shall be final, nonappealable, and not subject to judicial or other review except as provided in these Specifications.
 If the Contractor does not accept the decision of the Director, he may request to make a
 presentation to the Claims Appeal Board. This request shall be made in accordance with Item
 110.04(c)2. below.
 
 (c) Claims Appeal Board.
 1.
 
 Composition and Appointment.
 The Claims Appeal Board is a standing committee created to receive a presentation
 regarding a claim. The Claims Appeal Board will hear claims for additional monetary
 compensation which may include a request for a time extension; however, stand-alone time
 extension requests will not be considered by the Board. The Board consists of three primary
 members who are normally appointed for two-year terms. A three-member pool of alternates
 will be selected from which to provide a substitute for the primary member in the event that
 the primary member is unable to serve at a particular time or in the event that the Director
 declares the position vacant due to unfitness, death, illness, incapacity, conflict of interest
 or any other circumstance which would make service on the Board by that member
 impossible, difficult or unobjective. The three primary members of the Board and three
 alternates are appointed in the following manner. The Transportation Director appoints the
 primary and one alternate for one position. The Alabama Road Builders' Association appoints
 the primary and one alternate for a second position. The Transportation Director and the
 Alabama Road Builders' Association jointly appoint the primary and one alternate for a third
 position. The jointly appointed primary member will be the Board Chairman. The jointly
 appointed alternate will be the alternate Board Chairman. At least one Board Member must
 be a licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Alabama.
 In the event that an alternate member is elevated to permanently replace a primary
 member of the Board, then a new alternate shall be appointed in the same manner as was
 the departing alternate. Such will also be the case if an alternate position is declared vacant
 by the Director due to death, illness, incompetence or other reasons. In the event that both
 the primary member and the alternate member are unable to serve or must recuse
 themselves due to conflict of interest, etc., on a particular claim(s) hearing, a new member
 of the Board will be appointed in the same manner as the primary member to sit for that
 particular hearing.
 The ALDOT will notify the Contractor in writing of the date of the presentation and the
 names of the Board members. The Contractor will have ten calendar days from receipt of the
 letter to file with the Director, by certified mail, an objection as to the composition of the
 Board which specifically details the nature of the objection. The Director shall have final
 authority in determining the composition of the Board.
 Each Board member will be paid $60 per hour for actual time spent on reviewing the
 plans, specifications, and claim; attending the presentation and for preparing the report to
 the Director. This payment will cover all compensation and expenses.
 2. Presentations.
 The Contractor may initiate a request for a Board presentation bysubmission of a
 written notice by certified mail to the Director within 30 calendar days from the date of the
 Director’s decision on the recommendation of the Claims Committee. Failure to make the
 request within the required time period shall constitute waiver of the claim by the
 Contractor. The Board presentation will convene at the mutual convenience of the Board, the
 Department, and the Contractor. Issues not specifically presented in the original claims
 89
 
 SECTION 110
 CLAIMS
 package are waived and are not subject to consideration by the Board. The Contractor shall
 not contact or have any discussions with members of the Claims Appeal Board while the claim
 is pending except during the formal presentation.
 The FHWA will be invited to send an observer for Federal Aid projects.
 The Contractor shall pay for 50 percent of the expenses of a Board presentation. The
 written recommendation of the Board will be sent to the Director following the presentation.
 The Claims Appeal Board's recommendation may be accepted, modified, or denied by the
 Director. After receiving the recommendation of the Claims Appeal Board, the Director has 45
 calendar days to report his decision to the Contractor.
 The Director's decision in the resolution of any and all claims shall be final,
 non-appealable and not subject to judicial or other review. The decision of the Director is

 SECTION 111
 DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE (DBE)
 111.01 Goals.
 This contract contains a specific goal for the participation of certified DBEs. The goal is expressed
 as the percentage of the total amount of the contract that is required for DBE participation and is
 given in the proposal. This type of participation is defined as Race Conscious.
 If no specific percentage is indicated in the proposal, then any DBE firm utilized for work in this
 contract is defined as Race Neutral. The requirements listed in Article 111.08 and 111.09 still apply to
 contracts with no specific goal. In addition, any participation by DBEs above the required goal is also
 defined as Race Neutral.
 
 111.02 Certification.
 The Department maintains a current listing of certified DBE firms by categories of work. The
 Department’s certification extends only to the requirements of 49 CFR 26 with regard to business size,
 disadvantaged status, and ownership and control of business. The certification does not attest in any
 way to the capabilities or capacity of any business to perform satisfactorily.
 DBE firms that are not on the current certification list must seek approval prior to tendering an
 offer on any project.
 
 111.03 Low Bidder Submittal DBE Utilization Plan.
 This contract will be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. The apparent low bidder must
 submit within five calendar days of the letting date the following information in writing on Form OE110 (DBE Utilization Plan) provided by the Department:
 • The name and address of the DBE firm or firms;
 • The description of the work to be subcontracted;
 • The dollar amount of the work;
 • A written commitment from the bidder to use the DBE;
 • A written confirmation from the DBE that it is participating in the contract as provided in
 the commitment.
 
 111.04 Failure by Low Bidder to Meet DBE Goal.
 In the event the apparent low bidder cannot meetthe DBE goal, the low bidder must provide
 documentation that good faith efforts were made to meet the goal.
 92
 
 SECTION 111
 DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE (DBE)
 
 111.05 Good Faith Efforts by Low Bidder.
 (a) Solicitation of DBE Participation.
 A good faith effort is soliciting through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance
 at pre-bid meetings, advertising, written notices, corresponding with the ALDOT’s DBE Program
 Coordinator, placing postings on the Small Business Network of Bid Express) the interest of all
 certified DBEs who have the capability to perform the work of the contract. The bidder must
 solicit this interest within sufficient time to allow the DBEs to respond to the solicitation. The
 bidder must determine with certainty if the DBEs are interested by taking appropriate steps to
 follow up initial solicitations.
 
 (b) Selecting Portions of the Contract Work to Facilitate DBE Participation.
 A good faith effort is selecting portions of the work to be performed by DBEs in order to
 increase the likelihood that the DBE goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate,
 breaking out contract work items in to economically feasible units to facilitate DBE participation,
 even when the bidder might otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces.
 
 (c) Providing Information About Contract Requirements.
 A good faith effort is providing interested DBEs with adequate information about the plans,
 specifications, and requirements of the contract in a timely manner to assist them in responding
 to a solicitation.
 
 (d) Negotiating in Good Faith.
 A good faith effort is negotiating in good faith with interested DBEs. It is the bidder’s
 responsibility to make a portion of the work available to DBE subcontractors and suppliers and to
 select those portions of the work or material needs consistent with the available DBE
 subcontractors and suppliers, so as to facilitate DBE participation. Evidence of such negotiation
 includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of DBEs that were considered; a
 description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work
 selected for subcontracting; and evidence as to why additional agreements could not be reached
 for DBEs to perform the work.
 A bidder using good business judgment would consider a number of factors in negotiating with
 subcontractors, including DBE subcontractors, and would take a firm’s price and capabilities as
 well as contract goals into consideration. However, the fact that there may be some additional
 costs involved in finding and using DBEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a bidder’s failure to
 meet the contract DBE goal, as long as such costs are reasonable. Also, the ability or desire of a
 bidder to perform the work of a contract with its own organization does not relieve the bidder of
 the responsibility to make good faith efforts. Bidders are not, however, required to accept higher
 quotes from DBEs if the price difference is excessive or unreasonable.
 
 (e) Investigating the Capabilities of a DBE to Perform the Work.
 A good faith effort is establishing sound reasons (based on a thorough investigation of the
 capabilities of a DBE to perform the work) for rejecting a DBE as being unqualified. The bidder’s
 standing within its industry, and membership in specific groups, organizations, or associations and
 political or social affiliations (for example union vs. nonunion employee status) are not legitimate
 causes for the rejection or nonsolicitation of bids in the bidder’s efforts to meet the project goal.
 
 (f) Providing Assistance in Obtaining Bonding, Credit, and Insurance.
 A good faith effort is providing assistance to interested DBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of
 credit, or insurance as required by the DBE or bidder.
 
 (g) Providing Assistance in Obtaining Equipment, Supplies, and Materials.
 A good faith effort is providing assistance to interested DBEs in obtaining necessary
 equipment, supplies, materials, or related assistance or services.
 
 (h) Utilizing Industry, Governmental, and Service Groups.
 A good faith effort is effectively using the services of available minority/women contractors’
 groups; local, State, and Federal minority/women business assistance offices; and other
 organizations as allowed on a case-by-case basis to provide assistance in the recruitment and
 placement of DBEs.
 
 111.06 Evaluation of Low Bidder’s Good Faith Efforts.
 The Department has established a “Good Faith Efforts Committee”.
 93
 
 SECTION 111
 DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE (DBE)
 If the Good Faith Efforts Committee determines the information and documentation from the
 bidder are satisfactory, the bid will be declared responsible. Acceptable good faith efforts may include
 activities in addition to those that are described in Article 111.05 and 49 CFR Part 26 Appendix A. A low
 bidder's good faith efforts on other ALDOT construction contracts may be considered in determining the
 acceptability of the low bidder's good faith efforts to meet current participation goals.
 If the information and documentation are unsatisfactory, the bidder will be notified in writing
 within five days. The bidder will be given the opportunity to appear before the Department’s
 Transportation Director to present additional evidence of good faith efforts. The bidder will then be
 given a written decision on the outcome of the consideration of this evidence.
 Failure to meet the contract goal or demonstrate good faith efforts will result in the bid being
 declared to be in default and the bid bond shall be forfeited.
 
 111.07 DBE Termination After Award of the Contract.
 (a) Notification of Termination.
 A prime contractor cannot terminate a DBE subcontractor listed on the DBE Utilization Plan
 for convenience and then perform the work of the terminated subcontract with its own forces or
 those of an affiliate, without the Department’s prior written consent. If a listed DBE subcontractor
 fails to perform, or performs unsatisfactorily, the prime contractor will notify the Project Manager
 in writing, with a copy to the Construction Engineer, stating the reasons for termination with
 supporting documentation.
 
 (b) Substitution of New DBE for Terminated DBE.
 If the reasons for termination are satisfactory, the prime contractor will be required to obtain
 a substitute DBE and submit a revised DBE Utilization Plan, or demonstrate good faith efforts as
 described in Articles 111.05 and 111.06 in trying to obtain a substitute DBE. If the prime
 contractor fails or refuses to comply, the Department reserves the right to issue a warning letter
 as defined in the DBE Violations (Article 111.09) and/or an order stopping all or part of the
 payment and work until satisfactory action has been taken.
 
 111.08 Credit for Work Assigned to Meet the DBE Goal.
 (a) Value of Work Performed by a DBE.
 1. Work Done Directly by DBE Forces.
 The dollar amount of that portion of a construction contract that is performed by the
 DBE's own forces will be counted towards meeting the DBE goal. This dollar amount shall
 include the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the DBE for the work of the contract,
 including equipment leased by the DBE. This dollar amount shall not include supplies,
 materials, and equipment the DBE purchases or leases from the prime contractor or affiliates
 of the prime contractor. (The term "affiliates" is defined in Subarticle 102.02(a)).
 2. Fees and Commissions Charged by a DBE.
 The dollar amount of fees or commissions charged by a DBE firm for providing a service,
 such as professional, technical, consultant, or managerial service, or for providing bonds or
 insurance specifically required for the performance of the contract will be counted towards
 meeting the DBE goal. The fee shall be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees
 customarily paid for similar services.
 3. DBE Obtaining a Subcontract with Lower Tier Subcontractor.
 When a DBE subcontracts part of the work of its subcontract to another firm, the value
 of this work will be counted toward the DBE goal if the DBE's subcontractor is a DBE.
 Work that a DBE subcontracts to a non-DBE firm will not be counted toward the DBE
 goal.
 
 (b) Joint Venture.
 When a DBE performs as a participant in a joint venture, the dollar amount of the contract
 equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the contract that the DBE performs
 with its own forces will be counted toward DBE goal.
 
 (c) Commercially Useful Function.
 1. Requirement for a Commercially Useful Function.
 The dollar amount of contract work performed by a DBE will only count towards meeting
 the DBE goal if the DBE performs a "commercially useful function".
 94
 
 SECTION 111
 DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE (DBE)
 2. Definition of a Commercially Useful Function.
 A DBE performs a commercially useful function when it is responsible for execution of
 the work of the contract and is carrying out its responsibilities by actually performing,
 managing, and supervising the work involved. To perform a commercially useful function, the
 DBE must also be responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for
 negotiating price, determining quality and quantity, ordering the material, and installing
 (where applicable) and paying for the material itself. The determination of whether or not a
 DBE is performing a commercially useful function will be based on the amount of work
 subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the firm is to be paid under the
 contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing, and the DBE credit claimed
 for its performance of the work, and other relevant factors.
 3. Extra Participation (Not a Commercially Useful Function).
 A DBE does not perform a commercially useful function if its role is limited to that of an
 extra participant in a transaction, contract, or project through which funds are passed in
 order to obtain the appearance of DBE participation. The determination of whether or not a
 DBE is an extra participant will be based on similar transactions, particularly those in which
 DBEs do not participate.
 4. Insufficient Participation (Not a Commercially Useful Function).
 If a DBE does not perform or exercise responsibility for at least 30 % of the total cost of
 its contract with its own work force, or the DBE subcontracts a greater portion of the
 workthan would be expected on the basis of normal industry practice for the type of work
 involved, the DBE is not performing a commercially useful function.
 5. Consideration of Trucking as a Commercially Useful Function.
 The following factors will be given consideration in determining whether or not a DBE
 trucking company is performing a commercially useful function:
 a. Responsibility for Management and Supervision of Trucking.
 The DBE must be responsible for the management and supervision of the entire
 trucking operation for which it is responsible on a particular contract, and there cannot
 be a contrived arrangement for the purpose of meeting DBE goals.
 b. Truck Ownership and Operation.
 The DBE must own and operate at least one fully licensed, insured, and operational
 truck used on the contract.
 c. Credit for Transportation Services.
 The DBE will receive credit for the total value of the transportation services it
 provides on the contract using trucks it owns, insures, and operates using drivers it
 employs.
 d. Leasing from DBE Firm.
 The DBE may lease trucks from another DBE firm, including an owner-operator who
 is certified as a DBE. The DBE who leases trucks from another DBE will receive credit for
 the total value of the transportation services the lessee DBE provides on the contract.
 e. Leasing from Non-DBE Firm.
 The DBE may also lease trucks from a non-DBE firm, including an owner-operator.
 The DBE who leases trucks from a non-DBE is entitled to credit only for the fee or
 commission it receives as a result of the lease arrangement. The DBE does not receive
 credit for the total value of the transportation services provided by the lessee, since
 these services are not provided by a DBE.
 f. Exclusive Use of Truck During Lease.
 To receive credit for trucking, it must be clearly shown on a lease that the DBE has
 exclusive use of, and control over the truck. This does not preclude the leased truck
 from being used for work for others during the term of the lease with the consent of the
 DBE, so long as the lease gives the DBE absolute priority for use of the leased truck.
 Leased trucks must display the name and identification number of the DBE.
 g. Lease Agreement Documentation
 A copy of each lease agreement, both for DBE firms and non-DBE firms, must be
 submitted with the DBE Utilization Plan if the DBE Trucking company intends on utilizing
 95
 
 SECTION 111
 DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE (DBE)
 a this type of trucking participation or with the first Form DBE-10 submittal after the
 lease agreement is executed and utilized on the contract.
 6. Consideration of Appeal by DBE that Work is a Commercially Useful Function.
 When it is determined that a DBE is not performing a commercially useful function the
 prime contractor and the DBE will be given the opportunity to provide documentation to
 rebut this determination.
 The Department's decisions concerning commercially useful functions are subject to
 review by other entities but are not administratively appealable to the USDOT.
 
 (d) Materials and Supplies Counted Toward Meeting the DBE Goal.
 1. DBE Manufacturer.
 If the materials or supplies are obtained from a DBE manufacturer, 100 % of the cost of
 the materials or supplies will be counted toward meeting the DBE goal.
 A DBE manufacturer shall be defined as a firm that operates or maintains a factory or
 establishment that produces, on the premises, the materials, supplies, articles, or equipment
 required under the contract.
 2. DBE Regular Dealer.
 If the materials or supplies are purchased from a DBE regular dealer, 60 % of the cost of
 the materials or supplies will be counted toward meeting the DBE goal.
 A DBE regular dealer shall be defined as a firm that owns, operates, or maintains a store,
 warehouse, or other establishment in which the materials, supplies, articles or equipment of
 the general character described by the specifications and required under the contract are
 bought, kept in stock, and regularly sold or leased to the public in the usual course of
 business.
 To be a DBE regular dealer, the firm must be an established, regular business that
 engages, as its principal business and under its own name, in the purchase and sale or lease
 of the products in question.
 A person may be a DBE regular dealer in such bulk items as petroleum products, steel,
 cement, gravel, stone, or asphalt without owning, operating, or maintaining a place of
 businessif the person both owns and operates distribution equipment for the products. Any
 supplementing of regular dealers' own distribution equipment shall be by a long-term lease
 agreement and not on an ad hoc or contract-by-contract basis. In addition, the regular
 dealer, with the exception of steel, must be certified in accordance with the Department’s
 program for the Materials, Sources and Devices with Special Acceptance Requirements
 Manual.
 Packagers, brokers, manufacturers' representatives, or other persons who arrange or
 expedite transactions are not DBE regular dealers.
 3. Brokers
 With respect to materials or supplies purchased from a DBE which is neither a DBE
 manufacturer nor a DBE regular dealer,the entire amount of fees or commissions charged for
 assistance in the procurement of the materials and supplies, or fees or transportation charges
 for the delivery of materials or supplies required on a job site, will count toward the DBE goal
 if the fees are reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for
 similar services.
 The cost of the materials and supplies will not be counted toward the DBE goal.
 
 (e) Certification at the Time of the Execution of the Contract.
 If a firm is not currently certified as a DBE at the time of the execution of the contract, the
 firm's participation in the contract will not be counted toward the DBE goal.
 When a prime contractor has made a commitment to using an ineligible firm (one decertified
 by the Department) and a subcontract has not been executed before the Department issued the
 decertification notice, work by the ineligible firm does not count toward the contract goal. The
 prime contractor must meet the contract DBE goal with an eligible DBE firm or demonstrate that
 he has made good faith efforts to do so.
 If a prime contractor has executed a subcontract with an ineligible firm before the
 Department issued the decertification notice, the prime contractor may continue to use the firm
 on the contract and may continue to count the firm’s participation toward the contract DBE goal.
 
 96
 
 SECTION 111
 DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE (DBE)
 
 (f) Payments Considered Applicable to the DBE Goal.
 The participation of a DBE subcontractor toward meeting the DBE goal will only be counted
 toward the goal after the compensation for the work has been has been paid to the DBE.
 
 (g) Reporting DBE Performance.
 1. Monthly Estimate Report.
 To document the DBE participation for the contract, the prime contractor shall furnish
 the Project Manager an ALDOT FORM DBE-10 for each estimate period. In the case of
 contracts with more than one project, a Form DBE-10 shall be submitted for each project
 estimate. The prime contractor shall provide the required data for each DBE active on the
 project during the estimate period. If no DBE was active during the time period, such
 indication should be made on the form.
 Form DBE-10 shall be submitted on all Federal aid projects regardless of whether or not
 the contract contains a specific DBE goal.
 The Form DBE-10 shall be submitted within sixty calendar days of the close of the
 estimate period for which it applies. Failure to furnish the Form DBE-10 in a timely manner
 may result in the withholding of further monthly estimates until the delinquent information
 has been submitted.
 2. Monthly Estimate Documentation.
 For DBE Manufacturers, Dealers, and Broker (including any fee/commission service
 work), a copy of the paid invoice shall be submitted with the DBE-10 form work for which the
 work performed and services provided applies. For DBE Truckers who haul materials from a
 commercial facility such as a quarry to the plant for stocking purposes for the production of
 materials for the contract, a copy of each haul ticket shall be provided to the Project
 Manager with the DBE-10 form. This documentation is to verify the work performed for this
 contract.
 3. Final Report.
 Prior to the submission of the final estimate voucher for signing, the prime contractor
 shall furnish a final Form DBE-10 for each DBE subcontractor. This final Form DBE-10 shall be
 submitted to document any changes in the quantities of work performed by the DBE since the
 project completion due to the final quantities review and resulting payment adjustments.
 This form shall be submitted with the information required in Subarticle 109.12(c).
 4. Certification of Actual Payments Form.
 Prior to the submission of the final estimate voucher for signing, the prime contractor
 shall furnish a Certification of Actual Payments to DBE Firms form for each DBE
 subcontractor. This form shall be submitted with the signature of an authorized
 representative of the DBE in order to document the total amount paid to the DBE firm as
 indicated on the final Form DBE-10. In the event that the DBE firm has gone out of business
 and is unavailable to sign the form, the prime contractor shall submit copies of the
 subcontractor estimates and cancelled checks verifying the amount paid to the DBE firm.
 This form shall be submitted with the information required in Subarticle 109.12(c).
 
 111.09 DBE Violations.
 (a) Descriptions of Violations.
 1. Violations by Bidders and Prime Contractors.
 Possible violations by bidders and prime contractors include, but are not limited to,
 failure to provide the DBE Utilization Plan within five calendar days of the letting date,
 failure to meet the contract goal, failure to make good faith efforts, deleting DBE
 subcontractors for convenience, improper DBE participation credit reports, continued failure
 to furnish Form DBE-10 reports, failure to comply with Department decisions and directives
 concerning DBE activities, and fraud.
 2. Violations by DBE Subcontractors.
 Possible violations by DBE subcontractors include those listed in 49 CFR Part 26.107 as
 well as failure to fulfill contract commitments and negotiations.
 3. Determination of Violations.
 
 97
 
 SECTION 111
 DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE (DBE)
 These violations are only possible examples and not all inclusive. The Department
 reserves the right to determine exact violations and the extent of each violation on a caseby-case basis.
 
 (b) Violations Prior to Award of the Contract.
 Failure by the apparent low bidder to provide the DBE Utilization Plan within the time frame
 specified, or failure of the apparent low bidder to make and document good faith efforts will
 result in the contract not being awarded to that bidder and forfeiture of its bid bond.
 The next low bidder will become the new low bidder and will have five calendar days from
 notification by the Department to provide the DBE Utilization Plan. Failure to provide the required
 DBE Utilization Plan or to make and document good faith efforts will result in the contract not
 being awarded to that bidder and forfeiture of its bid bond.
 If the contract is awarded to the next low bidder, the original low bidder will be prohibited
 from doing any work relating to the contract either as subcontractor or in any other capacity.
 These restrictions shall apply to any other name under which the same person, individual,
 partnership, company, firm, corporation, association, cooperative, affiliate, or other legal entity
 may be operating, and in which the principal owner(s) are involved.
 
 (c) Violations While the Contract is in Effect.
 For the first violation of the DBE requirements, a letter will be written to the prime
 contractor and/or the DBE, if applicable, citing the violation and warning that failure to rectify
 the violation or further violations will result in disqualification as outlined in Subarticle 102.02(b).
 The second violation will result in the prime contractor and/or the DBE subcontractor being
 disqualified as outlined in Subarticle 102.02(b) for an indefinite period. The disqualification may
 be reviewed each six months, if requested in writing by the disqualified firm.
 The third violation will result in the prime contractor and/or the DBE subcontractor being
 disqualified as outlined in Subarticle 102.02(b) for an indefinite period. The disqualification will
 be for at least one year. It may be reviewed after one year, if requested in writing by the
 disqualified firm.
 An exception to the above is that an open and flagrant violation. The
 prime contractor and/or the DBE subcontractor will not be issued a warning letter, and the prime
 contractor and/or DBE subcontractor will be summarily disqualified as outlined in Subarticle
 102.02(b) for at least six months. The disqualification may be reviewed after such time, if
 requested in writing by the disqualified firm. If applicable, the DBE subcontractor's continued
 status as a certified DBE will be recommended to the Department's DBE Review Committee for
 review.

 or aggregate backfill that may be required to meet regulatory requirements for backfilling
 abandoned septic tanks.
 If the removal of septic tanks is not shown to be required on the plans, and the tanks are
 required to be removed by the Engineer, payment for the removal will be made as Extra Work
 in accordance with the requirements given in Article 109.04.
 
 (c) Relocation of Structures.
 1. General.
 No structure under this classification shall be relocated until it has been inspected by the
 Engineer in company with the Contractor and the owners and/or lessees and its actual
 condition determined. An itemized written report of the condition of the structure at the
 time of such inspection shall be prepared by the Contractor and signed by the Engineer,
 Contractor, owners and/or lessees and a copy given to all parties concerned. Photographs,
 from negatives, not less than 4 inches {100 mm} by 5 inches {125 mm} in size shall be made of
 the structure as directed by the Engineer. Prints of the photographs shall be attached to and
 become a part of each copy of the report before the report is signed. Once a Contractor
 begins moving a structure, he shall vigorously and continuously prosecute its moving and
 re-establishment in such a manner that the owner or lessee will be inconvenienced the
 shortest time possible. If the work is not expedited, the Engineer may order all work stopped
 or withhold estimates until the work on the structure in question is satisfactorily completed.
 Structures that are moved to new locations or elevations shall be set upon substantial
 foundations conforming to the new elevations and sites. Sound materials salvaged from the
 same unit may be used, supplemented by necessary new materials similar to those in the
 103
 
 SECTION 205
 REMOVAL AND RELOCATION OF STRUCTURES
 existing foundations. Any damage or injury occasioned by moving shall be repaired by the
 Contractor without additional compensation.
 Certain structures may be designated to be cut off and re-established at the right of way
 line. Care shall be taken to avoid damage to the remainder of the structure and any damage
 thereto shall be repaired by the Contractor without additional compensation. The cutoff
 portion of the building outside the right of way shall be braced and refaced along the right of
 way line as directed, using new or suitable materials salvaged from the same unit.
 The closure of a septic tank shall be done in accordance with the requirements given for
 "Removal of Structures".
 Established shrubs and lawns, along with designated trees, are considered a part of a
 structure relocation, hence, they shall be either transplanted or replaced in kind.
 Transplanting procedures shall be consistent with details noted in these specifications for
 transplanting trees and shrubs and for grassing work.
 2. Structure Release.
 Structures and appurtenances shall not be considered satisfactorily relocated until the
 Contractor has furnished the Engineer with a release from the owners and lessees (if
 applicable) prepared on the form prescribed by the Department for the purpose. This release
 from the owners and the lessees shall not preclude the Engineer from inspecting the moved
 structure and requiring any corrective work to be done that he considers necessary. No
 disposition or modification of the structure, other than that shown on the plans, will be made
 by any agreement between the Contractor and owner without the prior written approval of
 the Engineer.
 If the owners or lessees of any structure refuse to execute a release for the Contractor
 and, if after inspection, the Engineer determines that the Contractor has done all that could
 be reasonably expected to be done to affect a satisfactory removal and re-establishment of
 the structure, the Engineer may certify such upon the Department's form, which will be
 sufficient to release monies due to the Contractor; however, such certification and release of
 monies to the Contractor will in no way be construed as a release of the liability or
 responsibility of the Contractor under Subarticle 107.14(a), but shall be a release only for the
 purpose of releasing monies to the Contractor.
 
 (d) Disposal of Debris and Cleanup of Site after Removal and Relocation.
 Disposal of debris and materials not allowed for reuse shall be done in accordance with the
 requirements for disposal given in Subarticle 201.03(d). After the removal of a structure has been
 completed the Contractor shall grade the area of removal to produce a stable uniform ground
 surface. When clearing and grubbing is not a part of the contract, the Contractor shall obtain
 approval from the Engineer to cut trees that interfere with structure removal or relocation.
 If allowed by the Engineer, stone, bricks, broken concrete, concrete blocks, and concrete
 masonry of all types may be used to fill low areas, basements, and other depressions except
 abandoned septic tanks.

 EXCAVATION AND EMBANKMENT
 
 SECTION 210
 EXCAVATION AND EMBANKMENT
 210.01 Description.
 The work under this Section shall cover the excavation, hauling, disposal, or compaction of all
 material not being removed under some other item which is encountered within the limits of the work
 and is necessary for all construction in accordance with these specifications and in reasonably close
 conformity with the lines, grades, thickness, and typical cross sections shown on the plans or
 established by the Engineer. All excavation covered in this section will be classified as "Unclassified
 Excavation", "Muck Excavation", "Channel Excavation", or "Borrow Excavation", as described in this
 Section.
 Attention is directed to the fact that the roadbed must be treated by one of the methods specified
 in Section 230, 231 or 232 before the placement of an overlying subbase, base, or paving structure will
 be permitted.
 
 210.02 Materials.
 (a) General.
 All excavation within the right of way or easement limits will be known as Roadway and
 Drainage Excavation and will be classified as "Unclassified Excavation", "Muck Excavation" or
 "Channel Excavation". Excavation outside of the right of way or easement limits will be classified
 as "Borrow Excavation."
 
 (b) Roadway and Drainage Excavation.
 Soils data indicated on the plans is for estimating purposes only and the Department does not
 guarantee the accuracy thereof. Material designated for removal under embankment areas will be
 reclassified according to its condition at the time of removal.
 1. Unclassified Excavation.
 Unclassified Excavation shall consist of the excavation of all materials of whatever
 character encountered in the work, except Channel Excavation or Muck Excavation when such
 items are included as separate pay items in the plans or proposal.
 2. Channel Excavation.
 Channel Excavation shall consist of the excavation, removal, and disposition as noted or
 directed of all material necessary to provide inlet and outlet ditches or channels for drainage
 structures in accordance with plan details. However, unless specifically designated by plan
 details, such excavation will be classified as Unclassified Excavation.
 3. Muck Excavation.
 Material unsuitable for immediate reuse due to organic content, saturated to the extent
 it is somewhat fluid, and must be moved by dragline, dredge, or other similar type equipment
 which operates outside the area being excavated, will be classified as muck.
 Unless explicitly authorized otherwise by the Engineer, before material is classified by
 the Engineer as muck, the Contractor will be required to demonstrate that the material
 cannot be removed by conventional methods and equipment normally used in the unclassified
 excavation operation. Conventional equipment includes all types of scrapers and dozers. If no
 item for Muck Excavation is provided in the plans or proposal, such excavation will be
 classified as Unclassified Excavation and payment will be made as outlined in
 Item 210.10(a)1.
 
 (c) Borrow Excavation.
 Prior approval of all borrow sources must be given; however, this does not relieve the
 Contractor from the full responsibility for the quality and quantity of the material used. Materials
 for borrow shall be in accordance with the following:
 1. Embankment.
 Materials furnished for embankments above water and below subgrade shall be any
 stable material which can be compacted to the specified density.
 2. Improved Roadbed.
 
 110
 
 SECTION 210
 EXCAVATION AND EMBANKMENT
 Materials furnished for the improved roadbed shall be any stable material meeting the
 requirements of Soil Classification A-1, A-2, A-3, or A-4, as determined by AASHTO M 145,
 within the following limitations.
 a. Materials in the A-2 or A-4 Classification shall shall be submitted to the Central
 Materials and Tests Soils Laboratory for a Resilient Modulus test. The Resilient
 Modulus test results will then be evaluated by the Materials and Tests Engineer to
 determine the suitability for use as Improved Roadbed.
 b. Materials of the cherty or float gravel type which have a maximum of 50% passing
 the Number 8 {2.36 mm} sieve and 100% passing the 4 inch {100 mm} sieve will not
 be required to conform to the Soil Classification noted above.
 c. Industrial waste, a residue from a manufacturing operation, may be used provided
 the material is taken from "cold" piles which are approved by the Materials and
 Tests Engineer and the material is broken down by roadway operations or pit
 operations or crushing methods to allow approximately 100 percent passing the 4
 inch {100 mm} sieve. However, isolated oversize particles up to a maximum
 diameter of 1 inch {25 mm} less than the thickness of the compacted layer may be
 used, provided such does not exceed 10 percent of the weight {mass} based on 1
 square yard {1 m²}, 6 inches {150 mm} deep. The weight {mass} of 1 square yard {1
 m²} will be calculated on the weight {mass} per cubic foot {cubic meter} of the
 material. This material shall have a unit weight {mass} of not less than 100 pounds
 per cubic foot {1600 kg/m³}, dry as determined by AASHTO T 99, Method "A" or "C",
 and conform to the following Composition Table:
 Composition Sieve

 Liquid Limit (L.L.)
 25 Max.
 Plasticity Index (P.I.)
 6 Max.
 CBR
 12 Min.
 Material meeting this specification will not be required to conform to any Soil
 Classification noted above.
 3. Underwater Backfill Material.
 Material for underwater backfill shall be selected sandy material of an A-3 Classification
 or an approved A-1 or A-2 material of which not more than 15 percent passes the Number 200
 {75 µm} sieve. A rocky material that will form a firm foundation when deposited under water
 may also be acceptable.
 4. Underwater Embankment Materials.
 Material for underwater embankment shall be secured from quarries designated on the
 plans or from other approved sources, producing equally satisfactory material. The material
 shall consist of 1/2 cubic yard {0.5 m³}, and smaller, size stone taken from approved natural
 rock formations. The material shall be free from earth or other foreign material consisting of
 predominantly larger size stones. Material to be used for choking or blanketing the surface of
 the underwater embankment shall be of sandy or fragmentary nature, such as stone spalls or
 screenings, float gravel, or gravel. Material that will slake or become plastic in water shall
 not be used as choking material or in the blanket course. NOTE: Certain materials within the
 roadway excavation limits may be authorized for use as improved roadbed material,
 underwater backfill, or underwater embankment; however, such authorization shall be in
 accordance with the provisions of Article 106.08.
 
 210.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) General.
 Prior to beginning excavation and embankment operations in any area, all necessary clearing
 and grubbing of the area shall have been performed in accordance with the provisions of Section
 201, Clearing and Grubbing. Grading operations should commence as soon as possible after the
 beginning of the clearing and grubbing operations. Once grading operations begin, the work shall
 be continuous towards completing excavation and embankment unless approved otherwise in
 writing by the Engineer. Exposed erodible cuts shall be final dressed, topsoil shall be placed, and
 the ground surface shall be stabilized with mulch and permanent seeding. The mulch and
 permanent seeding shall be placed in vertical increments not exceeding 20 feet {6 m} as the work
 111
 
 SECTION 210
 EXCAVATION AND EMBANKMENT
 progresses. Embankments shall be constructed with temporary earth berms to divert runoff to cut
 slopes or temporary pipe as the work progresses. Final grading and permanent stabilization
 measures shall be initiated for cut slopes within 48 hours of meeting the limits of vertical grading
 increments or upon suspension or completion of grading operations in a given area. Final grading
 and permanent stabilization of embankments shall be initiated within 48 hours of reaching
 subgrade.
 Special attention is directed to the requirements given in Section 665 and Sections 651
 through 659 pertaining to the establishment of temporary and permanent erosion and sediment
 control measures.
 The excavation and embankment for the work shall be constructed and maintained so as to
 properly drain and have reasonably smooth and uniform surfaces. The final subgrade elevation and
 section of both cuts and fills shall be in reasonably close conformity to that specified by the plans
 or directed (i.e. plus or minus 1 inch {25 mm} from the designated grade and slope elevations). No
 material shall be wasted without permission of the Engineer. Excavation operations shall be so
 conducted that material outside of the limits of the slopes will not be disturbed.
 Choice of equipment to perform the work shall be that of the Contractor. The type and
 number of units shall be such as to perform the excavation and embankment operations in
 conformity with these specifications and secure the density specified. Supplemental equipment
 shall be furnished as necessary to keep the work properly shaped.
 When the Contractor's excavation operations encounter artifacts of historical or archeological
 significance, the operations shall be temporarily discontinued. When directed by the Engineer, the
 Contractor shall excavate the site in such a manner as to preserve the artifacts encountered and
 allow for their removal. Such excavation, unless otherwise provided, will be considered and paid
 for as extra work.
 Where portions of existing pavement are to remain and join the surface of the new work,
 they shall be cut to a neat line with a vertical face using saws or other equipment that will not
 damage the retained portion of the work.
 
 (b) Roadway Excavation.
 1. General.
 All intersecting roads, approaches, entrances, and driveways shall be graded and
 completed concurrently with the roadway grading and shall be kept passable at all times.
 During the grading operation, the area being graded shall be maintained reasonably smooth
 and well drained. Material used as directed by the Engineer for temporary surface to permit
 public use of the project will be paid for at the contract unit price of the materials so used.
 The Contractor shall maintain this temporary surface.
 Cuts may be widened and the slopes varied as directed during construction, according to
 the stability of the material encountered and the need for embankment material; however,
 benching of backslopes in order to obtain material will not be permitted unless authorized in
 writing. If widening of a cut is necessary after the backslope is completed, a width sufficient
 to accommodate normal grading equipment will be allowed. Unauthorized excavation beyond
 the required slope will not be paid for.
 Old roadways within the Right of Way shall be obliterated as directed. Roadway
 obliteration will be paid for as Unclassified Excavation, unless otherwise designated on the
 plans.
 2. Removal of Topsoil.
 Topsoil within the construction limits shall be removed in the areas and to the depth as
 directed by the Engineer. Topsoil may include sod, but not tall vegetation or other debris,
 and shall be kept free from subsoil. It shall be stockpiled in approved locations with each
 stockpile not less than 4 feet {1.2 m} high, and containing not less than 200 hundred cubic
 yards {150 m³}. Each stockpile shall be shaped as necessary to permit accurate cross sections.
 The work of removal and stockpiling of topsoil will be paid for as Unclassified Excavation.
 Temporary or permanent seeding, mulching and other erosion control measures shall be
 applied as directed by the Engineer and will be paid for under the appropriate items of work.
 3. Selective Grading.
 Certain designated zones or portions of cuts which afford the more suitable soils for
 roadbed construction shall be reserved as directed for use in forming the upper graded earth
 layer or layers for embankments or cuts, for backfilling, and for other purposes. Should it
 112
 
 SECTION 210
 EXCAVATION AND EMBANKMENT
 become necessary to stockpile selected material for use below the subgrade elevation of the
 same cut, it may be stockpiled nearby so that the excavated material can be measured for
 payment for the rehandling.
 4. Undercutting.
 a. Soil.
 Unless noted otherwise on the Plans, cuts in soil shall be undercut 1 foot {300 mm}
 where improved roadbed is required. Undercut areas shall be further undercut if the
 Engineer determines that this is necessary for the removal of soft or yielding areas. The
 areas of increased undercutting shall be shaped to drain, backfilled with a suitable
 material and uniformly compacted to the density specified for embankment.
 The length of a section of undercutting shall be a minimum of 25 feet {7.5 m}.
 Areas where improved roadbed is not required shall also be undercut if the Engineer
 determines that this is necessary for the removal of soft or yielding areas. These areas
 shall also be shaped to drain, backfilled with suitable material and uniformly compacted
 to the density specified for embankment.
 All depressions in undercut sections shall be cleaned out and provisions shall be
 made for drainage. The depressions shall be backfilled and compacted with selected
 materials approved by the Engineer.
 Undercutting will be measured and paid for as Unclassified Excavation.
 b. Rock.
 Cuts in rock shall be undercut 1 foot {300 mm} only where the rock does not extend
 above the subgrade across the full width of the improved roadbed.
 All depressions in cuts in rock shall be cleaned out and provisions shall be made for
 drainage. The depressions shall be backfilled with a crushed aggregate base material
 meeting the requirements of Section 825 or a quarry crusher-run material suitable for
 the intended purpose. The backfill shall be compacted as directed by the Engineer.
 There will be no direct payment for the material required to fill depressions made
 in rock cuts where the depressions resulted from the removal of rock.
 5. Excavation and Backfill of Muck.
 Excavation and backfill of muck areas shall be performed in a manner, acceptable to the
 Engineer, that will not permit the entrapment of muck within the backfill. The backfilling of
 the excavated area shall follow immediately behind the excavation so that any soft material
 that is pushed ahead of the backfill can be removed. After muck removal, the Contractor
 shall allow the Engineer adequate time to take all elevations and measurements necessary for
 determining the volume removed.
 Normally, the material used to backfill the excavated muck areas will be selected
 Unclassified Excavation or Borrow Excavation, Item 210-A or 210-D, as shown on the plans or
 directed by the Engineer.
 When directed in writing by the Engineer, the material used to backfill the excavated
 muck areas will be Borrow Excavation (Underwater Backfill or Underwater Embankment),
 Item 210-E or 210-F, meeting the requirements of Subarticle 210.02(c).
 Backfill material placed in water shall be so deposited that its weight {mass} will
 displace and force any remaining muck outward and ahead of the backfill, and prevent
 trapping of muck pockets. Back-pressure from displaced muck against the toe of the
 advancing backfill shall be relieved promptly by excavating the displaced muck as fast as it
 accumulates. Dikes ordered constructed within the right of way limits for controlling the
 muck will be paid for as Unclassified Excavation.
 In addition to the requirements of Article 210.05 for disposal areas, where directed,
 dikes shall be built (without extra compensation) to keep the deposited muck within the
 limits of the designated areas and as soon as the surface condition of the deposited material
 will permit, the Contractor shall remove all visible stumps, roots, logs, and other debris from
 the waste pile and shall dispose of them as specified in Subarticle 201.03(e) without extra
 compensation. Before acceptance of the work, all parts of the waste pile shall be drained and
 dressed to a pleasing and reasonably uniform surface and any necessary erosion control work
 performed, all as directed by the Engineer.
 
 113
 
 SECTION 210
 EXCAVATION AND EMBANKMENT
 6. Excavation of Rock.
 Unless otherwise shown on the plans, the Contractor shall use the presplitting technique
 to split the face of the rock cut in a relatively smooth plane along the designated backslope,
 prior to shooting the interior portion of the cut. Presplitting shall be accomplished by drilling
 holes at intervals of approximately 1.5 feet {500 mm} to 3 feet {1 m} to the proper depth
 along the designated slope, loading and stemming such holes with an appropriate light charge
 of explosive and detonating all holes simultaneously. The Contractor will not be required to
 presplit on slopes flatter than one to one. In the event the cut is too deep for the presplitting
 to be done in one operation, an 18 inch {450 mm} offset will be allowed for the subsequent
 presplitting operations after the initial presplitting and interior blasting.
 Any material outside the designated side slopes that has been loosened or shattered by
 blasting shall be removed to provide a reasonably smooth and uniform slope. No rock shall
 project more than 1 foot {300 mm} inside the designated slope. Payment will be made for
 overbreakage and necessary backfill material for a distance not to exceed 1 foot {300 mm}
 outside the designated slopes or 1 foot {300 mm} below the designated elevation for
 undercutting; however, where presplitting is required, no overbreakage on side slopes will be
 paid.
 All overbreakage in excess of the noted limits shall be removed and necessary backfill
 performed by the Contractor without additional compensation.
 When authorized in writing, rock from roadway excavation may be used under other
 sections of the Specifications. In such event, payment will be made under the appropriate
 Section for which the rock is so used, and as provided in Section 106 for the replacement of
 materials for use in the embankment.
 All rock that is not required for other construction shall be placed in embankment,
 insofar as possible, in accordance with the provisions for embankments. Large rock or
 boulders that cannot be used in embankment shall be disposed of by the Contractor.
 7. Benching.
 In cuts where unstable soil conditions occur, the plans may designate or the Engineer
 may direct the use of benching. The benching shall be accomplished by suitable drilling and
 blasting equipment when so directed. This benching will be measured and paid for as
 Unclassified Excavation.
 Benching may also be ordered to provide a more stable foundation for heavy
 embankment. Benching shall be accomplished by excavating horizontally along the hillside
 down to or into rock or other suitable undisturbed foundation material, forming a series of
 stepped benches. Each bench shall be in excavation for its entire width. The benches
 generally shall parallel contour lines. They shall be constructed at least 10 feet {3 m} wide
 and may be required to be wider for better support of embankment. Benching of
 embankment will be measured and paid for as Unclassified Excavation only if it is required to
 be loaded onto equipment and hauled to another location.
 
 (c) Borrow Excavation.
 All stumps, logs, brush, roots, and other debris resulting from clearing and grubbing work in
 borrow pits shall be removed and disposed of as specified in Subarticle 201.03(e). No separate
 payment will be allowed for this operation.
 Material unsuitable for use in the work shall be disposed of in a satisfactory manner and the
 amount of such deducted or eliminated from quantities measured for pay purposes.
 All borrow areas shall be bladed and left in such shape as to permit accurate measurements
 after excavating has been completed. The Contractor shall notify the Engineer in sufficient time
 before beginning excavation so that the necessary cross sections may be taken. The finished
 borrow areas shall be left in a condition satisfactory to the Engineer and the property owner.
 Attention is directed to Subarticle 106.01(b) for conditions governing local pit operations.
 The selection of areas of the source for use and sequence of excavation shall be as directed
 by the Engineer in order that material of the best available gradation and soil characteristics may
 be secured.
 
 (d) Embankment.
 1. General.
 Only suitable, approved materials shall be used in the work. The Engineer shall be the
 sole judge of the suitability of materials and may require such selection of materials as may
 114
 
 SECTION 210
 EXCAVATION AND EMBANKMENT
 be necessary to insure a satisfactory embankment. Sandy or rocky materials available shall be
 used to the extent practical across wet areas to form a floor for supporting the required
 embankment.
 After clearing and grubbing of the embankment areas is complete, all cavities and
 irregularities shall be enlarged to permit use of compaction equipment, backfilling and
 compacted as required. Foundation preparation shall consist of the work required to provide
 a stable foundation for the embankment. This may consist of undercutting and backfilling,
 flooring sufficient to support equipment, or other work as may be directed. Foundation
 preparation and compaction will be as directed by the Engineer.
 Where embankment is to be placed on old concrete pavements or pavements having
 concrete bases, the treatment of the old concrete shall be as specified on the plans. Where
 embankment is to be placed on any other type of roadway pavement or surface, the existing
 pavement or surface shall be scarified to the extent necessary to provide ample bond
 between old and new material.
 2. Embankment Formation.
 Rocks, broken concrete, or other solid materials shall not be placed in embankment
 areas where piling is to be placed or driven.
 Roadway embankment of earth material shall be placed in reasonably uniform layers not
 exceeding 8 inches {200 mm} (loose measurement) and, insofar as practical, the full width of
 the embankment section. Each layer shall be compacted as specified before the next
 overlying layer is placed. Care shall be taken during the compaction operations so that
 uniform density is obtained.
 When the excavated material consists predominantly of rock fragments of such size that
 the material cannot be placed in layers of the thickness prescribed without crushing,
 pulverizing, or further breaking down of the pieces resulting from excavation methods, such
 material may be placed in the embankment as directed in layers not exceeding 2 feet {600
 mm} in thickness. Each layer shall be leveled and smoothed with suitable leveling equipment
 and by distribution of spalls and finer fragments or earth. These type lifts shall not be
 constructed above an elevation of two feet {600 mm} below the finished subgrade. The
 balance of the embankment shall be composed of suitable material (no material larger than 4
 inches {100 mm}) smoothed and placed in layers not exceeding 8 inches {200 mm} in loose
 thickness and compacted as specified for embankments.
 Placing of large stones, up to two-thirds the remaining embankment height at the point
 of placement, will be allowed provided they are spaced so as to permit free access of proper
 equipment to compact the intervening fill in normal layers. Other large stones may be placed
 on fill slopes as directed.
 When new embankment is to be placed against existing embankments, or when
 embankment is built one-half width at a time and slopes are steeper than 4:1 {1:4} when
 measured at right angles to the embankment, the old embankment shall be continuously
 benched and the new work brought up in layers. Benching shall be of sufficient width to
 permit operations of placing and compacting equipment, but in no case less than 6 feet {2
 m}. Material thus cut out shall be recompacted along with the new embankment material at
 the Contractor's expense.
 Underwater backfill and underwater embankment shall be deposited in one layer for the
 full width of the embankment, or as directed, to the elevation designated on the plans or
 directed. In the formation of underwater embankment, the rock shall be fully choked with a
 blanket of approved choking material before placement of the remaining embankment.
 Embankment over, under, and around structures (pipes, culverts, arches, bridges and
 like), except pipes and arches 48 inches {1200 mm} or less in diameter, shall be selected
 embankment material placed and compacted or tamped as noted herein in a manner and by
 methods that will avoid unbalanced loading, cause movement, or place undue strain on any
 structure. Attention is directed to Section 530 for pipes and arches 48 inches {1200 mm} or
 less in diameter. The Contractor shall be solely responsible for protecting the structures and
 any damage to any part of a structure due to not providing proper protection shall be cause
 for ordering its replacement without additional compensation.
 3. Embankment Compaction.
 Layers of embankment shall be compacted as specified in Subarticle 306.03(b). Strict
 moisture control will not be required; however, it will be the Contractor's responsibility to
 115
 
 SECTION 210
 EXCAVATION AND EMBANKMENT
 maintain the moisture content necessary to satisfactorily compact the material. Compaction
 in a semi-dry condition will not be permitted.
 Where improved roadbed design is specified, the layers up to the bottom of the
 improved roadbed shall be compacted as noted above and finished true to required line,
 grade, and cross section. The improved roadbed layers shall then be constructed as provided
 in Article 230.03.
 Where improved roadbed design is not specified, the embankment layers shall be
 continued up to subgrade elevation with the same compaction requirement as noted herein.
 Just before placing a subbase or other material on this graded earth roadbed, the top 6
 inches {150 mm} shall be reconstructed as provided in Subarticle 230.03(c) of these
 specifications.
 No compaction or density test will be required for underwater embankment or
 underwater backfill.
 
 210.04 Use of Materials.
 All suitable materials removed from the Roadway Excavation shall be used, insofar as practicable,
 in the formation of the embankment, roadbed, base layers, shoulders, slopes, bedding, and backfill for
 culverts, and for such other purposes and places as directed. Suitable materials shall be defined as
 those suitable for any of the above listed uses.
 No excavated material shall be wasted unless permitted in writing by the Engineer but shall be
 used uniformly to widen embankments, to adjust grades, to flatten slopes, or shall be deposited in
 such places and for such other purposes as may be directed. Such material shall be handled as follows:
 1. Suitable Material.
 Suitable material shall be used at the time of excavation for any of the purposes outlined
 herein in this Article. It is not intended to stockpile suitable material unless ordered in
 writing by the Engineer. Payment for second handling will be made only when reused from
 stockpiles previously ordered by the Engineer.
 2. Unsuitable Material.
 Unsuitable material that cannot be used at the time of excavation may, at the option of
 the Contractor, be temporarily stockpiled within the right-of-way, or the Contractor may
 make written request for disposal as waste in an approved area on or off the right-of-way.
 Payment for the second handling of stockpiled unsuitable material will be made only when
 ordered in writing for use by the Engineer for a specific pay item. The remainder of the
 stockpiled material may be used to widen embankments, flatten slopes, etc. as allowed by
 the Engineer, with no payment for the second handling, or shall otherwise be disposed of off
 the right-of-way with no payment for the second handling.
 No payment will be made for the second handling of unsuitable material deposited
 outside the construction limits at the time of excavation and later spread onto a fill slope,
 etc. by use of a dozer or similar equipment.
 3. Channel Excavation.
 Channel Excavation shall be used to fill old channels, in the construction of
 embankments, the flattening of slopes, or shall be disposed of as approved by the Engineer. If
 permitted by the Engineer, waste channel excavation may be spread in uniform layers, neatly
 leveled, shaped, and grassed with sufficient openings provided to permit surface drainage of
 adjacent lands; however, in no case will waste material piles be permitted to remain within
 10 feet {3 m} of the edge of any ditch, channel, or cut. No payment will be made for any
 necessary rehandling of Channel Excavation material unless ordered for use by the Engineer
 from stockpiles for a specific pay item.
 
 210.05 Disposal Areas for Surplus Material.
 If no disposal areas are shown on the plans, the Contractor shall provide at his own expense
 disposal areas and submit along with the permission of the property owner a plan for treatment of the
 area which is acceptable to the Engineer. Said plan shall provide for dressing, grassing, or other
 treatment to avoid unsightly appearance and not create a public nuisance or incur future maintenance
 problems.
 Disposal areas will not, in general, require clearing and grubbing or compaction of the waste pile;
 however, if clearing and grubbing or compaction is required, such will be designated by plan details or
 in the proposal.
 116
 
 SECTION 210
 EXCAVATION AND EMBANKMENT
 Reference is made to Item (f) of paragraph 3 of Article 107.13 concerning handling of waste
 material and treatment of areas.
 
 210.06 Finishing and Dressing.
 All the completed work shall be dressed and maintained substantially to the lines, grades, and
 cross sections shown on the plans or as directed by the Engineer. Slopes shall be shaped, rounded,
 finished, or trimmed in a neat workmanlike manner to conform to the slope lines shown on the plans or
 as modified by the Engineer. Care shall be exercised that no material be loosened beyond the required
 slopes.
 Compensation for all such finishing and dressing shall be included in the contract unit prices and
 no direct payment will be made for this work.
 
 210.07 Erosion Control.
 The Contractor shall incorporate into the work all permanent erosion control features provided in
 the contract at the earliest practical date. In addition, temporary erosion control features may be
 ordered by the Engineer to facilitate protection until the permanent control features can be installed.
 Particular attention is directed to Section 665 and Article 107.21 of these Specifications.
 
 210.08 Blank.
 210.09 Method of Measurement.
 (a) General.
 Measurement for all accepted Excavation, except for Borrow Excavation for Underwater
 Embankment, will be either by the cubic yard {cubic meter} of the material in its original position
 computed from cross sections by the average end area method or per ton {metric ton} as specified
 by the unit measure of the pay item.
 Measurement for Borrow Excavation for Underwater Embankment will be either by the ton
 {metric ton} or by the cubic yard {cubic meter}, loose volume, of the material in the hauling
 vehicle at the point of use as specified by the unit measure of the pay item.
 Embankment will not be measured for payment. All of the operations required for
 embankment formation described herein shall be considered necessary work incidental to and for
 which compensation is included in the contract unit prices for the pay items of the materials
 composing the embankment.
 Muck excavation as described in Subarticle 210.03(b) will require the use of the following
 modified cross section and average end area method. The volume will be measured between
 theoretical vertical side slopes, a station or substation at a time, immediately after completion of
 muck excavation and before backfill is placed. No measurement or allowance will be made for
 necessary excavation of material for sloughing, subsidence, flattening sides, slumps, or rehandling
 materials or for shaping and dressing disposal areas. The sloughing, subsidence, flattening, or
 slump of side slopes in muck will not be classed as slides.
 
 (b) Measurement Limitations.
 Measurement of pay quantities will not include any excavated material used for purposes
 other than those designated except as provided under Article 106.08. Where material has been
 excavated beyond the designated slope line and wasted, the unauthorized wasted material will be
 measured and deducted from the excavation quantities. Any material excavated prior to the
 staking out and cross sectioning of the borrow sources by the Engineer, or in excess of that
 ordered for the work, will not be included in the quantity measured for payment. If the Contractor
 places more borrow than is necessary, thereby causing a waste of excavation, the amount of such
 waste will be deducted from the borrow excavation as measured in the borrow source. When a
 borrow area is adjacent to the right of way, the dividing line between unclassified excavation and
 borrow excavation shall be either a vertical plane through the right of way line or the proposed
 backslope as shown on the plans, whichever is most economically advantageous to the State.

 214.04 Method of Measurement.
 (a) Structure Excavation.
 1. Quantity of Excavation.
 The quantity of excavation will be the number of cubic yards {cubic meters}, measured
 in its original position, that is excavated in accordance with the details shown on the plans
 and the following limitations.
 
 121
 
 SECTION 214
 STRUCTURE EXCAVATION AND BACKFILL FOR DRAINAGE AND MINOR STRUCTURES
 2. Masonry Structures other than Culverts.
 For masonry structures other than culverts, measurement will be made of material
 removed from the area bounded by vertical planes 1 foot {300 mm} outside of the neat lines
 of the foundation or footing plan and parallel thereto, and to the elevations shown on the
 plans or directed by the Engineer to provide installation on a suitable foundation. No
 measurement or payment will be made for material excavated outside these limits.
 3. Excavation for Culverts.
 For box, arch, and pipe culverts with wing walls or headwalls or other minor structures
 including storm sewers, measurement will be made of the material removed in accordance
 with the following:
 The excavation shall be considered to be a trench with vertical sidewalls. No separate
 measurement for minor structures (inlets, junction boxes, catch basins, manholes, etc.) other
 than noted below, such being considered incidental to work.
 The length of the excavation shall be the actual length of the structure (including inlets,
 junction boxes, etc.) measured along the flowline plus 1 foot {300 mm} at each end. When
 headwalls or wing walls are used, the length shall be the average net length of the structure,
 tip to tip of wings.
 The width of the excavation shall, in the case of pipe structures, be considered the
 inside diameter of the pipe plus 3 feet {1 m}. For box culverts, the width shall be the outside
 width of the barrels plus 4 feet {1.2 m}. On all culvert structures, no allowance will be made
 for wing flares or toe walls.
 4. Depth of Excavation.
 The depth of excavation will be as deep as required to install the structure on a suitable
 foundation to the flowline indicated. This depth shall then be measured in accordance with
 the following:
 a. Pipe of inside diameter of 48 inches {1200 mm} or less shall be laid in a trench
 extending at least 1 foot {300 mm} above the elevation of the top of the pipe. The
 depth of excavation shall be measured from a point 1 foot {300 mm} above the top
 of the pipe, or from subgrade elevation in cut sections.
 b. For box culverts and pipe larger than 48 inches {1200 mm} in diameter, cross
 sections of the original ground will be taken at major breaks in the ground line
 profile and at changes in the culvert barrel widths along the length of the culvert as
 defined in Item 2 above.
 5. Computation of the Volume of Excavation.
 The average end area method shall be used in computing the volume and no
 measurement for payment will be made for material excavated outside of the limits noted
 above.
 6. Excavation For Side Drain Pipe.
 No measurement or payment will be made for excavation for side drain pipe of any size
 or for side drain culverts unless so provided by plan details. The cost of such excavation shall
 be included in the price bid for the items; however, pipe designated on the plans as storm
 sewer pipe will not be classified as side drain.
 
 (b) Foundation Backfill.
 Foundation backfill will not be measured directly but the volume will be fixed at 150 percent
 of the volume of the excavation which it replaces that lies between the bottom of the structure
 and the bottom elevation of the trench ordered excavated. Where satisfactory structure
 foundation is provided by the normal process of removing and backfilling unsuitable material
 under fill areas, none of such backfill will be classified as foundation backfill.
 
 214.05 Basis of Payment.
 (a) Structure Excavation.
 Payment will be made for the number of cubic yards {cubic meters}, measured as detailed
 above, at the contract unit price bid for Structure Excavation.
 Such payment shall be payment in full for furnishing all materials, equipment, tools, labor,
 pumping, bailing, draining, and all incidentals necessary to complete the work and shall include
 installation and removal of any cribs, cofferdams, shoring, sheeting, or other protection, the

 SECTION 215
 EXCAVATION FOR BRIDGES
 215.01 Description.
 The work under this Section shall cover foundation excavation for bridge structures which includes
 the removal of all material, of whatever nature, necessary for the construction of foundations and
 substructures, including backfill, all in accordance with the plans or as directed by the Engineer. It
 shall, unless otherwise stipulated by the plans or proposal, include the furnishing of all necessary
 equipment and the construction of all sheeting and shoring, cribs, cofferdams, caissons, dewatering,
 etc., which may be necessary for the execution of the work. It shall also include the subsequent
 removal of these items and the placement of all necessary backfill as hereinafter specified. It shall also
 include the disposing of excavated material, not required for backfill, in a manner and in locations as
 approved by the Engineer.
 The item of Cofferdam and Pumping, when specified on the plans, shall not be covered under this
 Section. Attention is directed to Section 503 for the requirements of this item.
 
 215.02 Classification of Material.
 Excavation for bridges shall include all material removed except water or other liquids. Excavation
 of material for bridges not within the classification of roadway or drainage excavation will be
 Unclassified Bridge Excavation.
 
 215.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) Inspection.
 1. Notification.
 The Contractor shall notify the Engineer a sufficient time in advance of the beginning of
 the excavation for each structure, so that elevation and measurements may be taken of the
 existing ground. No payment will be made for material removed or excavated before these
 measurements have been taken.
 2. Approval.
 Ample opportunity shall be given the Engineer for the inspection of foundation pits and
 the measurement of material removed. In no case shall a foundation be closed to view until it
 has been inspected and approved.
 3. Change in Foundation Elevations.
 When in the Contractor's opinion, rock, or other firm foundation material of equal
 bearing value is encountered at an elevation above that shown for the footing, and at a
 location not subject to erosion or scour, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer in order that
 he may investigate and determine if it is advisable to raise the bottom of the footing.
 When the excavation for a footing has been completed to the approximate elevation
 shown on the plans without encountering satisfactory foundation material, the Contractor
 shall notify the Engineer in order that he may make an inspection and investigation, such
 investigation to consist of drilling, probing or jetting by the Contractor, a maximum of 4 holes
 per footing, each hole a maximum depth of 20 feet {6 m}. No direct payment will be made for
 this operation. If additional holes are required they will be paid for as provided in Article
 123
 
 SECTION 215
 EXCAVATION FOR BRIDGES
 104.03. The Engineer will then fix the proper elevation of the footing or decide upon its
 treatment.
 4. Drilling or Probing.
 When apparently satisfactory foundation material has been reached, the Contractor shall
 drill or probe not more than 4 exploratory holes to a maximum depth of 10 feet {3 m}. The
 drilling will not be required if a note is shown on the plans to waive this requirement. No
 direct payment will be made for this operation. If additional holes are required, they will be
 paid for as provided in Article 104.03.
 
 (b) Depth and Size of Excavation.
 The excavation for the bottom of the footing shall be carried to the depth as shown on the
 plans or as designated. The design and elevation of footings are based on soundings taken at
 certain points for design purposes only. These soundings may or may not be representative of the
 actual conditions encountered during construction. Bidders must assume the risk of having to
 excavate to a greater or lesser depth without altering the contract unit prices in the proposal,
 except as hereinafter set forth, and the footing elevations shown on the plans shall be considered
 as approximate only. The Engineer may order in writing such changes in dimensions or elevations
 of footings as may be necessary to secure satisfactory foundations for the structure.
 The size of the excavation shall in all cases be ample to accommodate necessary forms down
 to rock, marl, Selma chalk or similar hard material suitable for embedment of footings; excavation
 in such materials shall be as near as possible to the neat lines of the footings and the footings
 poured without the use of forms. In hard materials which cannot be cut to neat lines with a
 pneumatic spade, line drilling along the neat lines not to exceed 9 inch {230 mm} centers will be
 required. In dry soils, suitable for footing embedment, capable of providing stable, neat footing
 lines, permission may be given to allow pouring of footings without the use of forms; otherwise,
 the excavation shall be sufficient for forming the foundations.
 The horizontal limits of excavation shall not extend beyond what is required for sheeting,
 bracing, forms and reinforcing cages.
 
 (c) Cofferdams or Sheeting and Shoring.
 Cofferdams or sheeting and shoring will be required in foundation excavation work when work
 is adjacent to pavement, sidewalks, railroad tracks, utilities, etc., when the material encountered
 is unstable, when such excavation will present a hazardous or undesirable condition, or when
 necessitated due to water conditions. Materials and design to be used for this work will be
 determined by the Contractor.
 Working drawings and design calculations will only be required if the foundation work is
 within an area adjacent to the trackline. These areas are where a railroad company will require
 adequately designed cofferdams, sheeting and shoring to protect the stability of the trackline
 during construction. The Contractor shall contact the railroad company to obtain the design
 requirements for the cofferdams, sheeting and shoring. Working drawings and design calculations
 for cofferdams, sheeting and shoring shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements
 given in Article 105.02.
 If a seal is required in a cofferdam covered under this Section, it shall meet all of the
 requirements, and be measured for payment in accordance with Section 503.
 
 (d) General Backfill.
 All material used for backfill shall be soil of an acceptable quality.
 All spaces excavated and not occupied by abutments, piers or other permanent work shall be
 backfilled. Backfill around all units of a structure shall be completed as soon as practical after the
 unit has obtained the required strength. Bracing, forms and rubbish shall be removed from the
 excavated area before backfilling is commenced.
 Backfill within the limits of the roadway shall be as required by Section 210; all other
 backfill, except that placed below water level, shall be tamped and compacted as required by the
 Engineer.
 
 (e) Foundation Backfill.
 If the surface upon which the footing is to be placed becomes soft or muddy and will not dry
 out after the excavation has been dewatered, the Engineer may direct that a foundation course of
 approved free draining commercial material, as specified in Subarticle 214.02(b), be used under
 the footing.
 124
 
 SECTION 215
 EXCAVATION FOR BRIDGES
 If this soft and muddy condition occurred through no fault or negligence of the Contractor,
 the Engineer, at his discretion, may order payment to be paid under Item No. 214-B, Foundation
 Backfill, Commercial. If this Item is not in the contract, then payment will be made as Extra Work
 as specified in Article 104.03 and Article 109.04.
 When the above condition was the result, in the opinion of the Engineer, of negligence on the
 part of the Contractor, no payment will be made for the required foundation backfill. Compaction
 shall be as directed by the Engineer.
 
 (f) Preservation of Stream Banks and Channel.
 The natural ground adjacent to the structure shall not be disturbed without permission of the
 Engineer. Unless otherwise specified, no excavation shall be made outside of caissons, cribs,
 cofferdams, steel piling or sheeting. The natural stream bed adjacent to the structure shall not be
 disturbed without permission from the Engineer. If any excavation or dredging is permitted at the
 site of the structure before caissons, cribs or cofferdams, or piling are placed, the Contractor
 shall, without extra compensation and after the foundation is in place, backfill all such
 excavations to the original or established ground surface or stream bed with satisfactory material.
 No material or debris shall be deposited in any designated navigation channel during construction
 except with the approval of the Engineer. Such material or debris shall be removed to the normal
 navigation channel depth prior to completion and acceptance of the contract. Any material or
 debris resulting from the Contractor's operations deposited outside any designated navigation
 channel or other streams during construction except such fill as may be ordered as a permanent
 part of the work shall be removed and the channel freed from all obstructions before completion
 of the work.
 
 (g) Disposal of Surplus and Unsuitable Material.
 Surplus excavated material, after piers and abutments are backfilled, shall be used to
 obliterate construction scars at or near the bridge site, to smooth out depressions in and near the
 stream banks or as otherwise directed by the Engineer.
 
 215.04 Method of Measurement.
 (a) Unclassified Bridge Excavation.
 When listed as a pay item in the contract, the quantity of Unclassified Bridge Excavation will
 be the number of cubic yards {meters} of material excavated, measured and calculated in its
 original position, subject to the following limitations:
 a. The volume measured will be that actually removed (except for seal concrete footings);
 however, no measurement will be made for material removed outside of the area
 bounded by vertical planes 1 foot {300 mm} outside of the footing and parallel thereto
 down to hard material described in Subarticle 215.03(b) or for material excavated
 outside neat lines of footings in such hard material. For stepped footings the volume will
 be measured and computed separately for each step. When the size of a footing is
 reduced after the Contractor excavated for a larger footing as directed, the excavation
 will be measured based on the larger footing.
 b. Water or other liquid will not be classed as excavated material and no measurement or
 direct payment will be made for their removal.
 c. No measurement or payment will be made for excavation in pile abutments nor for any
 pile encasements.
 d. No measurement or payment will be made for the excavation required for the
 construction of abutment caps on drilled shaft foundations.
 e. No measurement will be made for material removed below the elevation designated to
 be the bottom of the footing, unless removal of said material is ordered. Excavation
 necessary and incidental to the cleaning or excavating of crevices in the floor of a
 foundation pit below the established footing elevation will not be measured for
 payment.
 f. No measurement will be made for the removal of material raised by driving piles or for
 the removal of material that flows through or over cofferdams or caissons.
 
 125
 
 SECTION 215
 EXCAVATION FOR BRIDGES
 g. The measurement of the volume of excavation for a seal concrete footing shall be
 calculated from the following:
 L = Length of footing shown on contract plans (feet {meters});
 W = Width of footing shown on contract plans (feet {meters});
 D = Final approved elevation of the bottom of the footing (feet {meters});
 B = Average elevation of the mud line or groundline (river bottom) at the
 cofferdam (feet {meters});
 Ve = Volume of excavation for which payment will be made (cubic yards {cubic
 meters}).
 Ve = L x W x ( B - D ) / 27 {Ve = L x W x ( B - D )}
 Excavation outside of these limits of measurement may be required for the construction
 of a seal concrete footing, depending on the details of construction selected by the
 contractor. No direct payment will be made for any excavation outside of the footing
 plan dimensions shown on the contract plans.
 
 (b) Cofferdams or Sheeting and Shoring.
 Each accepted Cofferdams or Sheeting and Shoring unit will be measured for payment as a
 lump sum unit. A unit shall consist of all piers, bents, and abutments on a specific bridge which
 are not designated by the plans for Item 503-B, Cofferdam and Pumping. Partial payments will be
 allowed on monthly estimates in accordance with Subarticle 215.05(a)2.
 
 215.05 Basis of Payment.

 SPECIAL PROTECTION FOR ROCK SLOPES
 217.01 Description.
 This Section shall cover the work of providing special treatments to rock slopes for protection
 against excessive weathering, popouts, and other detrimental conditions which may endanger the
 highway roadbed.
 In general the following methods, used as directed by the Engineer, shall be applied to exposed
 rock surfaces or rock surfaces exposed by the construction.
 • Rock Bolting - This work shall cover the anchoring of large blocks of rock which may be
 bounded by joints or cracks that might prove unstable by bolting them to more solid
 sections of rock.
 • Seam Sealing - This work shall cover the partial removal of relatively thin seams of very
 soft unsatisfactory material and the resealing of the seams with a durable cap of concrete.
 • Asphalt Surfacing - This work shall cover the surfacing of relatively flat horizontal sections
 of rock berms with an asphalt surface to prevent excessive wear or weathering of soft,
 unstable rock.
 • Pneumatic Concrete Blanket - This work shall cover the construction of a protective
 blanket layer of concrete over an area of broken or loose boulders and/or unstable rock to
 prevent fallouts from erosion and weathering.
 Special attention is directed to the fact that the items of work provided under this section are
 estimated and cannot be accurately determined until the work is exposed; therefore, only the amounts
 actually used will be measured for payment and no claims will be considered for extra compensation
 due to overruns or underruns of the items covered by this Section.
 
 217.02 Materials.
 (a) General.
 All materials furnished for use under this Section shall conform to the applicable sections of
 Division 800, Materials, unless noted herein or provided on the plans.

 SECTION 217
 SPECIAL PROTECTION FOR ROCK SLOPES
 
 217.03 Construction Details.
 (a) Rock Bolting.
 1. General.
 Rock bolts shall be installed at the direction of the Engineer at any point where the
 stability of the rock cut is questionable. When bolting is deemed desirable, it shall be done as
 quickly as possible. Rocks should be kept tight and not pulled back into place once it has been
 loosened by successive blasting or construction operations. The holes for the rock bolts shall
 be drilled as closely as possible to the diameter recommended by the manufacturer of the
 wedge or shell.
 2. Torque.
 The diameter and length of the rock bolt to be used shall be determined by the
 Engineer. All installations shall be in accordance with the recommended procedure or method
 as given by the manufacturer of the rock bolts. When directed by the Engineer, proper tests
 will be made to determine what torque the rock can withstand. If the tests show that the
 highest torque practical is of a certain value for a particular grade of rock, then torque shall
 be applied to the rock bolt provided the torque does not exceed the maximum recommended
 by the manufacturer of the rock bolts. It is recognized that any over-application of torque
 will only destroy the anchorage in the rock and in due time destroy the initial tightness of the
 bolt. It is desired that a minimum torque of 125 foot pounds {170 N•m} be applied in all cases
 where the rock will withstand such pressure.
 3. Installation Details.
 Extreme care shall be taken to keep the drill hole aligned perpendicular to the plate
 bearing surface. The diameter of the drill hole shall be as recommended by the manufacturer
 for the type of expansion unit to be used for anchorage into the rock. Expansion units shall
 not be used in holes larger than that for which they are designed. When slotted type rock
 bolts are used, the bolt with wedge shall be inserted in the hole until the wedge hits the
 bottom of the hole. The bolt shall then be driven into the hole with an air-percussion hammer
 forcing the wedge into the slotted end of the bolt, thus anchoring the bolt in the hole. The
 plate and nut shall then be installed on the collar end of the bolt and the nut tightened to
 the torque recommended by the manufacturer.
 
 (b) Seam Sealing.
 1. General.
 The seam designated by the Engineer for sealing shall be examined carefully during the
 grading operations for evidence of seepage which will require construction of weep holes in
 the sealing cap as well as for the best method for placing the sealing cap.
 2. Cleaning of the Seam.
 The material in the seam to be treated shall be routed out or otherwise removed to a
 depth at least equal to the thickness of the seam or layer to be treated or to a depth which
 will give firm support to the sealing material.
 3. Sealing the Seam,
 The clean seam shall be sealed or packed with one of the following types of concrete
 mixes. The method of packing or placing the sealant shall be left to the Contractor provided
 the method used produces the desired results and presents an acceptable appearance. Weep
 holes, when deemed necessary, shall be placed as directed.
 a. Low Slump - Class A concrete as provided by Section 501 of the Standard
 Specifications.
 b. Pneumatic Concrete of an approved mix of cement, additives, aggregates, and
 water applied pneumatically. (Mix designed by the Contractor to produce a 28 day
 cylinder strength of 5000 psi {35 Mpa})
 c. Retempered - Class A concrete.
 
 (c) Asphalt Surfacing.
 1. General.
 An Asphalt Surface shall be placed on areas designated by the Engineer to prevent
 excessive erosion from surface runoff over relatively soft and erodible materials.
 128
 
 SECTION 217
 SPECIAL PROTECTION FOR ROCK SLOPES
 2. Preparation of Surface.
 The surface to receive the asphalt surfacing shall be fairly uniform, without excessive
 high and low spots, suitable for coverage with asphalt. The surface shall be clean and free
 from loose rock fragments before applying the surfacing material.
 3. Surfacing Material.
 The surfacing material shall be Asphalt Cement Grade 40 or an approved equal. The
 bituminous material shall be applied at the rate of 1.25 gallons per square yard {5 L/m²}. The
 method of application shall be that of the Contractor's provided it is approved by the
 Engineer and it produces the desired results and presents a pleasing appearance.
 
 (d) Pneumatic Concrete Blanket.
 1. General.
 The exposed surface designated by the Engineer to receive this type treatment shall be
 carefully examined to determine the installation procedure which will be necessary to
 conform to the reinforcing details shown on the plans.
 2. Cleaning the Area to be Treated.
 The area to be treated shall be cleaned of all loose scaly rock or soil fragments by the
 use of pressurized water and air jets or other approved means as directed by the Engineer.
 3. Placement of the Protective Blanket.
 a. Reinforcement shall be placed in accordance with the details shown on the plans or
 as directed. Anchorage of the reinforcement to the slope shall be accomplished by
 the use of the anchor bolts of the size and shape shown by plan details.
 b. The pneumatic concrete blanket shall consist of an approved mix of cement,
 additives, aggregates, and water pneumatically applied to the surface to be
 treated. (The mix shall be designed by the Contractor so as to produce a 28 day
 cylinder strength of 5000 psi {35 Mpa}). Placement of the pneumatic concrete shall
 be in accordance with the supplying producer’s recommendations, provided the
 method used produces the desired results and presents an acceptable appearance.
 (Note - It is not the intent of this specification to require a uniform surface, but to
 provide a fairly uniform layer of concrete of not less than the depth shown on the
 plans, which in general parallels the surface being treated.)
 
 217.04 Method of Measurement.
 (a) Rock Bolting.
 The measurement for rock bolts will be the linear feet {meter} of the specific size designated
 by the Engineer, complete in place and accepted.

 136
 
 SECTION 230
 ROADBED PROCESSING
 designated on the plans or (2) Modified Roadbed whenever Improved Roadbed is not specified on the
 plans. This Section covers the additional work above that required for regular earthwork construction
 specified under Section 210.
 Improved Roadbed. Improved roadbed shall require the top layer, or layers, of the graded earth
 of both cuts and fills, with the upper surface at subgrade elevation, to be constructed of selected
 material from Unclassified Excavation or Borrow. Each layer of the plan designated thickness shall be
 processed and compacted as specified in Article 230.03.
 Modified Roadbed. Modified roadbed shall require that the existing top layer of the graded earth
 of both cuts and fills below subgrade elevation be processed and compacted as specified in Article
 230.03. This procedure is to establish a proper subgrade before constructing an overlying layer.
 
 230.02 Materials.
 (a) Improved Roadbed Materials from Unclassifed Excavation.
 Materials for Improved Roadbed that are from Unclassified Excavation shall be the best
 available materials, as determined by the Engineer, meeting the requirements given in Item
 210.02(c)2.
 
 (b) Improved Roadbed Materials from Borrow Excavation.
 Materials for Improved Roadbed that are from Borrow Excavation shall meet the requirements
 given in Item 210.02(c)2.
 
 230.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) General.
 Choice of equipment to perform the work required under this Section shall, in general, be
 that of the Contractor, provided such produces the desired results.
 Construction of the roadbed shall be conducted so that earth or other material does not
 prevent immediate drainage of water to the side ditches.
 
 (b) Improved Roadbed.
 1. Preparation of Roadbed.
 Both cuts and fills shall be graded to the elevation designated on the plans, below
 subgrade elevation in accordance with the requirements of Section 210, and to the Typical
 Section shown on the plans or directed. No selected roadbed material shall be placed until
 the graded earth surface is satisfactory to grade, cross section, and density in accordance
 with Section 210. If a contract requires an improved roadbed to be placed on an earth surface
 constructed under a previous contract, the surface shall be repaired to the extent directed.
 Additional material required will be paid for under the proper classification of the material
 directed to be used.
 2. Placement and Processing of Selected Roadbed Material.
 After preparation as noted above, the roadbed shall be brought up to subgrade elevation
 in maximum 6 inch {150 mm} layers using the designated selected materials. Each of these
 layers, except those specified in this Subarticle, shall be processed, utilizing the item
 Roadbed Processing, by thoroughly pulverizing, blending, and mixing until uniform in texture
 and appearance, insofar as practical, as determined by the Engineer. Each layer shall be
 compacted to the density noted in Subarticle 230.03(d) for improved roadbed layers. The
 section and density shall be maintained until placement of the next overlying improved
 roadbed, subbase, base, or other layer.
 3. Special Conditions.
 In grading contracts which do not provide a subbase, base, or other overlying layer, the
 upper improved roadbed layer will not be processed as outlined above for Roadbed
 Processing, but shall be brought to the required elevation, typical section, and density, that
 specified in Subarticle 230.03(d). The required section shall be maintained until final
 acceptance; however, maintenance of the density will not be required.
 
 (c) Modified Roadbed.
 1. Preparation of Roadbed.
 The graded earth shall have been constructed to subgrade elevation in accordance with
 Section 210 or may, by previous contract, have been constructed as an improved roadbed. No
 roadbed shall be processed, as outlined in this Subarticle, until the graded earth surface is
 137
 
 SECTION 230
 ROADBED PROCESSING
 satisfactory to elevation and typical section. If a contract requires roadbed processing on an
 earth surface constructed under a previous contract, the surface shall be repaired to the
 extent directed. Additional material required will be paid for under the proper classification
 of the material directed to be used.
 2. Processing of the Roadbed Material.
 After preparation as noted above, the top six inch {150 mm}, minimum, layer, except for
 those layers specified in this Subarticle, of the entire width of both cuts and fills shall be
 processed, utilizing the item Roadbed Processing, by thoroughly pulverizing, blending, and
 mixing until uniform in texture and appearance, insofar as practical, as determined by the
 Engineer. Each layer shall be compacted to the density noted in Subarticle 230.03(d) for
 modified roadbed. The section and density shall be maintained until placement of the next
 overlying subbase, base, or other layer.
 3. Special Conditions.
 The work described for a modified roadbed is for the establishment of a proper subgrade
 before constructing an overlying subbase, base, or pavement layer or temporary surfacing. In
 grading contracts which do not provide for one of the above, the upper 6 inch {150 mm} layer
 of subgrade will not be processed as outlined above for Roadbed Processing, but shall be
 brought to the required elevation, typical section, and density, that specified in Section 210.
 The required section shall be maintained until final acceptance; however, maintenance of the
 density will not be required.
 In addition to the above, Roadbed Processing will not be required for those roadbeds
 which are to be stabilized as specified in Section 231 or Section 232.
 
 (d) Density Requirements.
 Density for the layers of both improved and modified roadbed shall be as specified in Section
 306 for each type layer.
 
 (e) Surface Requirements.
 The graded earth surface and the finished subgrade surface, after being properly compacted,
 shall be checked by the use of blue-tops, strings, and template and all portions not within the
 following tolerances shall be corrected: Variations from the designated grade up to plus 1/2 inch
 {13 mm} or minus 1 inch {25 mm} will be allowed provided the variation does not increase or
 decrease more than 1/2 inch {13 mm} in 100 feet {40 m}; however, at bridge structures a plus
 tolerance will require additional fine grading to prepare a suitable grade tie. The finished surface
 shall not vary at any point more than 1/2 inch {13 mm} in any 25 foot {7.5 m} section from a taut
 string applied parallel to the surface and the roadbed centerline, or more than 1/2 inch {13 mm}
 from a template placed at right angles to the roadbed centerline. The template shall be of a rigid
 frame, adjustable metal type, accurately set, and at least as long as the width of roadbed being
 checked up to 30 feet {9 m}. Additional widths may be checked by the use of string and level. The
 Contractor shall furnish template, string, and necessary personnel to handle same under the
 direction of the Engineer. No subbase or other layer shall be placed on the roadbed until it meets
 specified requirements for alignment, grades, cross section, and density.
 Where a Permeable Asphalt Treated Base (PATB) layer is to be placed (Pay Item 327-E), the
 finished subgrade elevations shall not vary from design by more than 0.03 feet {10mm} based on
 rod and level survey readings taken at a minimum of five locations across each lane (edge, outer
 wheel path, midlane, inner wheel path, and inside edge of lane) at longitudinal intervals not
 greater than 50 feet {15 m}. Surface irregularities shall not exceed 1/4 inch {7 mm} between two
 points longitudinally or transversely using a 10-foot {3 m} straightedge.
 
 (f) Protection and Maintenance of Roadbed.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for the protection and maintenance of any existing
 roadbed or any roadbed constructed during the contract. The roadbed shall be maintained free
 from ruts and other depressions, in a smooth and compacted condition, and true to lines and
 grades. Any of the Contractor's hauling and other equipment used in such a way as to cause
 excessive rutting or raveling of the roadbed material shall either be removed from the work or
 suitable runways shall be provided to prevent rutting.
 No payment will be made for the protection and maintenance of the roadbed, such being
 considered incidental to the work. However, if a contract requires an improved roadbed to be
 placed on an earth surface constructed under a previous contract, the surface shall be repaired to
 the extent directed under the requirements of Section 210.

 SECTION 232
 LIME STABILIZED ROADBED
 
 SECTION 232
 LIME STABILIZED ROADBED
 232.01 Description.
 This Section shall cover the work of preparing a roadbed for an overlying base and paving structure
 by stabilizing it with a lime treatment.
 The work shall consist of scarifying the roadbed, incorporation of lime, and the necessary
 processing thereof in accordance with one of the following methods to the proper grade, section, and
 density.
 Class 1 Lime Stabilization shall consist of spreading and incorporating the specified percentage of
 lime in two increments in the following sequence: spreading the first increment, initial mixing,
 mellowing, spreading the second increment, final mixing, compacting, and finishing in accordance with
 these specifications. Mellowing is defined as the process of softening to a loamy consistency.
 Class 2 Lime Stabilization shall consist of spreading the specified percentage of lime, initial
 mixing, mellowing, final mixing, compacting, and finishing in accordance with these specifications.
 Class 3 Lime Stabilization shall consist of spreading the specified percentage of lime, mixing,
 compacting, and finishing in accordance with these specifications.
 
 232.02 Materials.
 All material furnished for use shall comply with the requirements of the appropriate Sections of
 Division 800, Materials. Water shall meet the requirements of Article 807.03; lime shall meet the
 requirements of Section 817.
 The soil used in the stabilization shall consist of existing roadbed material or material added as
 directed. Particles of aggregate larger than those passing the 3 inch {75 mm} sieve, and deleterious
 substances such as roots, stumps, grass turfs, and other vegetable matter shall be removed from the
 soil.
 
 232.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) General.
 The basic requirement for work under this Section is to obtain a completed layer or layers of
 roadbed material containing a uniform lime mixture, with a smooth, closely knit surface, free
 from cracks, loose or segregated areas, and constructed to the proper depth, width, and surface
 requirement as specified.
 Quantities and percentages of lime shown on the plans and proposal are based on preliminary
 soil investigation and dry laboratory sample tests. The actual application rate will be established
 from dry density tests made just prior to beginning stabilization work. The initial tests are based
 on Hydrated lime. If Quicklime is used and placed directly on the roadbed in pebble form, the
 percentage will be adjusted by the Engineer based on a factor of 0.833 times the hydrated lime
 percentage required. While either hydrated lime or quicklime may be used on different segments
 of the project, a second application of lime must be of the same type used in the first application.
 It is necessary to the quality of lime treated materials that all such materials be kept moist at
 all times. It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to provide sufficient equipment and keep all
 partially constructed or completed lime stabilized layers sufficiently and continuously moist until
 a succeeding layer has been placed thereon or until final acceptance of the project.
 
 (b) Equipment.
 Choice of equipment to perform the work required under this Section shall, in general, be
 that of the Contractor provided such produces the desired results.
 
 (c) Preparation of the Roadbed.
 The roadbed shall have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Section 210. The
 roadbed shall be scarified to the depth required for the stabilization prior to the lime application.
 The depth of scarification shall be carefully controlled so that the surface of the roadbed below
 the scarified material shall remain undisturbed and conform to the established cross-section. The
 scarified material shall be partially pulverized and all existing unsuitable material and material
 retained on a 3 inch {75 mm} sieve shall be removed.
 
 141
 
 SECTION 232
 LIME STABILIZED ROADBED
 
 (d) Application of Lime.
 The rate of application of lime shall be as specified by the Engineer. When the lime is to be
 placed in two applications as designated for Class 1 Lime Stabilization and the design percentage
 equals 5 %, 3 % shall be placed in the first application unless noted otherwise on the plans. When
 the lime is to be placed in two applications as designated for Class 1 Lime Stabilization and the
 design percentage equals 7 %, at least 3 % but not more than 3.5 % shall be placed in the first
 application unless noted otherwise on the plans.
 No lime shall be applied between October 1 and April 1 without written authorization of the
 Construction Engineer.
 Application of the lime shall be accomplished by either an approved "dry application" or
 "slurry application" method. The slurry application method shall be used unless shown otherwise
 on the plans.
 "Dry Application" - Lime applied by this method shall be spread uniformly and shall be
 sprinkled with water sufficient to prevent loss of lime by wind. Spreading of the
 lime when wind and weather conditions are unfavorable will not be permitted nor
 will spreading of the lime by motor patrol be acceptable.
 "Slurry Application" - Lime applied by this method shall be mixed with water in approved
 agitating equipment and applied to the roadbed as a thin water suspension of slurry.
 The distributing equipment shall be equipped to provide continuous agitation from
 the mixing site until applied on the roadbed. The proportion of lime shall be such
 that the "Dry Solids Content" shall be at least 30 percent by weight {mass}.
 NOTE: When quicklime is used, it shall be turned under by an approved means prior to
 application of water so as to reduce the harmful exposure to the heat of hydration
 by the quicklime.
 The distribution of lime at the rate specified shall be attained by successive passes over a
 measured section until the specified percentage of lime has been spread. After each successive
 pass, the material shall be incorporated into the soil with the mixing equipment. Additional water,
 if necessary, shall be added and mixed into the mass to hasten mellowing.
 Payment will not be made for any lime that has been spread and exposed before mixing for a
 period of six hours or more. Such areas shall be treated again with the full required rate of
 application. Additional lime shall be added at the Contractor's expense to any section on which
 excessive loss has occurred due to washing or blowing prior to mixing.
 The quantity of lime applied on any section shall be spread uniformly and shall not vary more
 than plus or minus five percent of the quantity ordered for that section. No payment will be made
 for lime application exceeding the five percent plus tolerance. When the quantity applied is
 deficient by more than the allowable minus tolerance, additional lime shall be applied prior to
 mixing.
 
 (e) Mixing.
 1. Initial Mixing.
 The lime and water shall be incorporated uniformly into the soil. The mixing and
 watering operation shall be continued until a homogeneous mixture that will pass a 3 inch {75
 mm} sieve is obtained. After satisfactory mixing is obtained, the layer shall be reshaped to
 approximate line, grade and section and sealed with a light roller, if mellowing is required.
 For Class 1 and 2 stabilization, the mixture shall be left to mellow for a minimum period
 of three days but not to exceed 21 days. During this period the entire surface of the
 stabilized layer shall be kept moist by sprinkling and at no time allowed to become dry or
 dusty.
 For Class 3 stabilization, the moisture content during the mixing operation shall not vary
 more than two percent, plus or minus, from the laboratory specified optimum moisture. After
 mixing this material shall be compacted and finished as specified in Subarticles (f) and (g)
 below.
 2. Final Mixing.
 After the required mellowing period (Class 1 and 2), the layer shall be scarified and in
 the case of a Class 1 treatment, the second application of lime added. The layer shall then be
 remixed as prescribed in the initial mixing operations adding water. Mixing shall be continued
 until 100 percent of material by dry weight {mass}, exclusive of gravel and stone, will pass a 2
 inch {50 mm} sieve and 60 percent will pass a Number 4 {4.75 mm} sieve. The percent
 142
 
 SECTION 232
 LIME STABILIZED ROADBED
 moisture shall not vary more than two percent, plus or minus, from the laboratory specified
 optimum moisture during this mixing operation. If mixing cannot be completed in the same
 day begun, the surface of the layer shall be sealed by rolling with a rubber-tired roller before
 suspending that day's operation and the processing continued the following day, weather
 conditions permitting.
 
 (f) Compaction.
 Compaction of the mixture shall begin immediately after the required mixing operation noted
 above has been completed.
 Compaction operations shall be completed within 72 hours after it was begun and so
 conducted as to provide uniform compaction from bottom to top of the layer. The mixture shall be
 aerated or watered as necessary to obtain the specified moisture content within two percent, plus
 or minus, of the laboratory specified optimum moisture. If compaction cannot be completed in the
 same day started, the surface shall be sealed by rolling with a rubber-tired roller before
 suspending that day's operation and the compaction continued the following day.
 Throughout the entire compaction operation, depressions, defective areas, or soft spots
 which develop shall be corrected immediately by scarifying the area, adding lime when required,
 or removing the material and reshaping and compacting in accordance with these specifications at
 the expense of the Contractor.
 Density requirements will be as specified in Section 306. Standard weights {masses} will be
 established on the project using material from the completed mixture, as directed by the
 Materials and Tests Engineer. The standard weight {mass} sample will be obtained and the
 standard weight {mass} established the same working day as the compaction tests are run.
 If compaction cannot be obtained within the 72 hour limit noted herein in this Subarticle, the
 section involved shall be reprocessed adding additional lime in the increment directed by the
 Engineer and the compaction operation restarted, all of which shall be at the sole expense of the
 Contractor.
 
 (g) Finish and Testing.
 The surface of the layer shall be smooth and conform to the lines, grades, and cross sections
 shown on the plans or established by the Engineer. Surface requirements shall be as specified in
 Subarticle 230.03(e).
 The thickness of the lime stabilized layer will be determined from measurements taken at
 intervals not to exceed 200 feet {60 m}. The thickness of the entire layer(s) shall not vary more
 than 1 inch {25 mm} plus or minus from that shown on the plans. Any section deficient by more
 than 1 inch {25 mm} shall be reconstructed immediately in accordance with these specifications.
 Any section exceeding the 1 inch {25 mm} tolerance shall have additional lime added to correct
 the deficiency and shall be remixed to the specified depth and width in accordance with these
 specifications. In each case, such reconstruction and additional lime added shall be at the sole
 expense of the Contractor.
 
 (h) Protection, Curing and Maintenance.
 Upon completion of the compaction and finishing of each layer, no vehicles or equipment
 other than watering equipment shall be permitted on the finished layer for a period of seven days
 unless otherwise authorized. During this curing period, the surface of the layer shall be lightly
 watered at frequent intervals to prevent drying.
 The Contractor may, on a layer to be covered by a conventional base or subbase layer,
 substitute at his expense an acceptable prime coat in lieu of watering during the curing period
 noted above.
 Regardless of the method of curing used, the Contractor shall be responsible for the
 protection and maintenance of the treated layer until it is covered by another layer or the
 completion of the project. Any damage to the treated layer due to other phases of construction or
 any cracking or other defects that may occur due to any cause or reason before being covered by
 the next layer shall be repaired without additional compensation.
 
 232.04 Method of Measurement.
 The actual area of the roadbed stabilized as ordered, for each specified compacted depth,
 completed to the thickness and cross-section shown on the plans or directed, will be measured in
 square yards {square meters}. All calculations of areas measured for payment shall be based on
 measurements made to the nearest 0.1 yard {0.1 meter} with areas calculated to the nearest square
 143
 
 SECTION 235
 DETOUR BRIDGES
 yard {square meter}. The length will be measured along the surface of the completed roadbed at its
 center point. The width will be the top surface width of the completed roadbed specified on the plans
 or directed, measured perpendicular to the center line of roadbed. Additional areas required for cross
 overs, turnouts, etc., shall be measured by length and width along the surface of area processed.
 Lime actually incorporated in the work will be measured by the ton {metric ton}. In cases where

 301.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) General.
 The roadbed must be in an approved condition before placement of any base or subbase will
 be permitted. Approval shall be based on satisfactory completion of the roadbed in accordance
 with the requirements of Sections 210 and 230 and, if required by the plans or proposal, the
 additional modification of the roadbed in accordance with the provisions of either Section 231 or
 232.
 The roadbed shall be checked carefully for elevations established by the Engineer and shall
 be true to alignment and grade within the limits specified in Subarticle 230.03(e). Control
 elevation stakes will be set as provided in Article 105.08.
 On a contract for base and pavement only, the roadbed, in addition to the check for
 continuity of grades, shall be checked for density as required by the process used in construction
 of the subgrade (Section 230, 231 or 232). Loss of density shall require reprocessing of the top
 layer (6 inches {150 mm}) of the subgrade in accordance with Section 230 by the method
 prescribed by the plans for the roadbed treatment. Low areas shall be corrected by the addition of
 material and reprocessing under the method prescribed for the roadbed treatment; minor high
 spots shall be eliminated during the dressing of the processed roadbed. Material ordered used for
 the correction of low areas in the subgrade shall be measured and paid for under the appropriate
 classification of the material ordered used. If no item for an acceptable type material is provided
 in the contract, such shall be furnished under the provisions of Article 104.03.
 A base of up to 6 inch {150 mm} plan designated compacted thickness may be constructed in
 one layer. Unless otherwise shown on the plans, a base of over 6 inch {150 mm} thickness shall be
 constructed in approximately equal layers each of not over 6 inch {150 mm} compacted thickness.
 Protection of base layers during construction shall be the Contractor's responsibility.
 
 (b) Equipment.
 In general, it shall be the Contractor's responsibility to select and furnish the proper size and
 amount of equipment that will produce and deliver to the roadbed, mix, spread, shape, and
 compact the base material.
 When cement or lime additives are required, all equipment necessary for the proper
 prosecution of the work shall be assembled on the site, approved and in good working order
 before permission to start processing the layer will be given.
 All equipment approved for use will be on a trial basis, and if after a short test section the
 equipment should prove unsatisfactory, it shall be removed, replaced, or supplemented as
 deemed necessary to accomplish the desired work.
 
 (c) Mixing.
 1. General.
 There are three methods of mixing base and subbase materials; they are road mixing,
 yard mixing, and plant mixing. Yard and plant mixing are considered as premixing. The
 Contractor may substitute yard or plant mixing in lieu of road mixing, or plant mixing in lieu
 of yard mixing, if so requested in writing.
 All mixing shall be performed in such a manner that all materials or component parts are
 thoroughly blended and mixed to a uniform gradation and color, with equipment and
 operation thereof producing consistently satisfactory results. Mixing water shall be added in a
 manner that will provide uniform blending with the material being mixed.
 Soft or unsatisfactory spots shall be removed and/or repaired as directed by the Engineer
 at no expense to the Department.
 2. Road Mixing.
 a. General.
 Roadmixing shall be performed by a motor grader supplemented, if necessary, by
 other approved mixing equipment that will produce consistently satisfactory results.
 Base materials may be dumped directly on the subgrade, subbase, or underlying
 layer. The Contractor is encouraged, but not required, to use adjustable aggregate
 spreaders to place and spread commercial or crushed aggregates.
 The dumping operation shall be limited to the amount of materials which can be
 mixed by the end of the next day. This material shall be shaped and compacted no later
 153
 
 SECTION 301
 SOIL, SOIL AGGREGATE, AND AGGREGATE,
 BASE AND SUBBASES
 than the day after mixing. In no instance shall the shaping and compacting be later than
 the second day after the dumping operation. No deviation from the above will be
 allowed without written permission of the Engineer.
 The bottom layer shall be mixed without disturbing more than 1 inch {25 mm} of the
 roadbed or underlying layer. Mixing of subsequent layers shall include scratching lightly
 of the surface of the underlying layer for bonding effect.
 Mixing shall be sufficiently performed to distribute all component parts of the layer
 uniformly throughout the mass producing a material of uniform color and gradation
 throughout the depth, width, and length, insofar as practical as determined by the
 Engineer, of the layer. Mixing shall include, but not be limited to, the windrowing and
 blading of the material as necessary to obtain the required consistency. Water shall be
 applied as necessary during the mixing operation to provide, at the time of compacting,
 a uniform moisture content within two percentage points of optimum as established by
 the required laboratory test. The material shall be aerated as often as necessary to
 correct excess moisture conditions by scarifying, plowing, harrowing, blading, or by using
 special, suitable equipment.
 b. Stabilization Using Additives.
 (1) General.
 It is necessary to the quality of the stabilization operation that careful control
 of the volumes of the base material, the additive, and moisture be exercised and
 that equipment furnished be capable of producing the desired results within the
 time frame noted herein of the type treatment involved; otherwise, the resultant
 product will be unsatisfactory. It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to provide
 suitable equipment, adequately sized and in sufficient numbers to process the
 materials as required.
 Each layer of base or subbase with an additive shall be processed through a test
 section utilizing equipment and methods noted for the type treatment involved.
 This test section shall be used to establish acceptability of the Contractor's
 equipment and processing technique along with determining the correct volume of
 material(s) necessary to obtain the required depth shown on the plans or ordered in
 writing. The length of the test section shall be determined by the Engineer to best
 fit the required type of processing specified by the plans or proposal, but shall not
 exceed one-half mile {800 m} nor be less than 500 feet {150 m}. The material shall
 be placed and spread, mixed if not premixed, and processed through the entire
 operation normally required for the type of layer involved. The layer shall then be
 checked for proper additive content, density, and depth, and any deficiencies
 corrected as provided in Article 301.05. Satisfactory completion and acceptance of
 the test section will be required before the remaining work on the layer being
 tested is permitted. The data thus obtained from the test section shall be applied to
 the placement procedure of the remainder of the layer involved.
 (2) Placing and Mixing.
 All materials, except the additive, shall be placed as noted in Subitem a.
 above.
 Placement of the additive will be allowed only after the initial mixing and
 blending described in Subitem a. above has been accomplished.
 Upon completion of the above operation, the additive shall be spread uniformly
 over the area to be treated using approved methods and equipment. The additive
 shall then be incorporated with the material to be treated in such a manner as to
 provide uniform distribution of the additive throughout the designated width and
 depth of treatment.
 Control of moisture shall be so exercised that the optimum moisture content
 (± 2%) is present during the initial mixing of the materials to be treated and the
 additive.
 
 154
 
 SECTION 301
 SOIL, SOIL AGGREGATE, AND AGGREGATE,
 BASE AND SUBBASES
 The use of lime and cement additives require special handling in accordance
 with the following:
 Lime Treatment.
 Lime treatment shall not be performed between October 1 and April 1
 without written permission of the Engineer. Lime shall be spread only on that
 area which can be processed in the same working day. Any lime that has been
 spread and exposed to the air before mixing for a period of six hours or more,
 or any section of the work on which excessive loss of lime has occurred due to
 washing or blowing will not be accepted for payment. Such areas shall be
 treated again with the full required rate of application before acceptance.
 After preparation of the material to be treated has been accomplished,
 the application of the lime shall be accomplished by either the "dry
 application" or the "slurry application" method described in Subarticle
 232.03(d) except that the "dry application" method shall not be used where the
 resultant dust from the dry method would affect the visibility of the traveling
 public or affect adjacent property owners.
 The actual rate of application of the lime will be set by the Engineer
 based on the standard density of the material to be treated as determined by
 AASHTO T 180.
 The quantity of lime applied on any section shall be spread uniformly and
 shall not vary more than plus or minus five percent of the quantity ordered for
 that section. No payment will be made for lime application exceeding the five
 percent plus tolerance. When the quantity applied is deficient by more than
 the allowable minus tolerance, additional lime shall be applied and the
 deficient section reconstructed in accordance with these specifications for the
 full depth and width at no extra compensation.
 The mixing of the lime with the base materials shall be accomplished
 utilizing traveling mixers capable of handling the required depth of material
 (loose), the lime, and the water necessary to provide the designated optimum
 moisture content. The blended material shall then be processed in the same
 manner noted in Item 301.03(d)3 for lime treated bases.
 Deficiencies in the thickness of the lime stabilized layer in excess of those
 specified in Subarticle 301.05(d) shall be reconstructed immediately adding
 additional lime if deemed necessary by the Engineer. Any additional lime and
 such reconstruction shall be at the sole expense of the Contractor.
 Cement Treatment.
 Cement treatment shall not be performed when the ambient ground
 temperature in the shade is below 40 °F {4 °C}. Should the air temperature
 drop below 35 °F {2 °C} after incorporation of the cement, protection shall be
 provided to prevent damage of the processed layer. Cement shall only be
 spread on the area that can be processed in the same working day. Any cement
 that has been spread and exposed to the air before mixing in excess of six
 hours or more, or any section on which excessive loss of cement has occurred
 due to wind or rain, will not be accepted for payment. Such areas shall be
 reconstructed with the required rate of treatment before acceptance at the
 sole expense of the Contractor.
 After the placement and processing of the base material to be treated,
 the cement shall be spread utilizing equipment specially designed for the
 purpose. The actual rate of application of the cement will be set by the
 Engineer based on the standard density of the material to be treated as
 determined by AASHTO T 180. The quantity of cement shall be spread
 uniformly over the area to be treated and shall not vary more than five percent
 from the specified rate. Care shall be exerted to prevent loss of cement due to
 wind or other unfavorable conditions.
 The mixing of the cement with the base material shall be restricted to
 traveling mixers capable of handling the required depth of material (loose), the
 cement, and the water necessary to provide the designated optimum moisture
 155
 
 SECTION 301
 SOIL, SOIL AGGREGATE, AND AGGREGATE,
 BASE AND SUBBASES
 content. When the mixer will handle only a part of the roadbed width, the
 successive increments shall be of such length that the full width of material
 may be promptly mixed, compacted, and finished with not more than 30
 minutes between mixing adjacent widths (lanes). The base and cement mix
 shall then be processed in the same manner noted in Item 301.03(d)2 for the
 cement treated bases.
 Should the thickness of treatment be found to be outside the tolerance
 noted in Subarticle 301.05(d) within two hours after completion of compaction
 and shaping, the Engineer may allow the reprocessing of the section provided
 additional cement is added in an amount to be designated by the Engineer
 without additional cost to the Department or handled as noted in Item
 301.05(d)3.
 3. Yard Mixing.
 Unless otherwise provided on the plans, the mixing yard shall be furnished by the
 Contractor.
 Yard mixing shall be accomplished by spreading each component in a layer of uniform
 width and thickness before placing the next component; then thoroughly mixing the materials
 by means of a motor grader supplemented, if necessary, by other approved mixing equipment
 that will produce consistently satisfactory results. The mixing shall be sufficient to combine
 all components into a mixture of uniform color and gradation adding water as necessary to
 obtain a uniform moisture content within two percentage points of optimum as established by
 the required laboratory test. The mixture shall then be loaded into transporting vehicles by
 means that will prevent segregation of materials.
 If calcium chloride or another similar additive is specified as a component of the mix,
 the additive shall be spread in the amount specified in the proper mixing sequence and
 mixing continued until the additive has been thoroughly mixed uniformly into the mixture.
 4. Plant Mixing.
 a. General.
 All of the following construction procedures are required for the base and subbase
 materials to be classified as Plant Mixed materials: mixing material in a plant or pugmill;
 dumping material directly into a truck; hauling material to the project site; and dumping
 material directly into a spreader that will spread the material into uniform layers of the
 required cross sections and thicknesses.
 Material that is dumped, stockpiled, and/or rehandled prior to spreading will be
 classified as Road Mixed or Yard Mixed material.
 b. Mixing Plant Requirements.
 The mixing plant requirements are as follows; however, any other mixing plant
 equipment developed that will produce equally satisfactory results will be acceptable for
 use with the approval of the Engineer.
 (1) The plant shall be an approved contra-rotating twin-shaft pug-mill type
 central mixing plant of proven performance and adequate capacity. The plant shall
 be equipped to proportion accurately by volume or weight {mass}.
 If proportioned by volume, component materials shall be fed onto a primary
 belt by a separate secondary belt for each component. Accurate proportioning shall
 be secured by positive control of secondary belt speed or by adjustable locking
 gates feeding onto the belt, The mixed materials shall be discharged through a
 surge hopper of at least 1 cubic yard {1 m³} capacity. The mixer also shall have an
 approved, accurate, mechanically-fed device for adding cement or other additive at
 a specified rate when such components are required.
 If proportioned by weight {mass}, equipment used to determine the weight
 {mass} of aggregates shall meet the requirements of Article 109.01. Weight {Mass}
 type mixers shall be equipped with a locking batch timer, adjusted for a minimum
 30 second net mixing time.
 (2) The controls that operate the mixing plant shall be positioned so that the
 operator will have unobstructed vision of all phases of the operations that affect the
 proportioning of materials. The plant shall be equipped with an approved device for
 156
 
 SECTION 301
 SOIL, SOIL AGGREGATE, AND AGGREGATE,
 BASE AND SUBBASES
 signaling the control operator to stop the plant when any malfunction occurs in the
 feed-in system.
 (3) The mixer shall be equipped with an accurate adjustable water meter
 device for controlling moisture content.
 (4) Storage bins shall be equipped with overflow pipes or chutes, and shall be
 so partitioned that there can be no spill-over into adjacent bins. Storage bins for
 calcium chloride, lime, or cement shall be water tight.
 c. Mixing Plant Operation.
 (1) During the mixing operation the aggregate shall be introduced into the
 mixer in a way that will insure the proportion of each type of material to be used
 will be in the final mixture.
 (2) Water shall be added to the mix in an amount that will produce a uniform
 moisture content, based on dry weight {mass} of the mixture, within two
 percentage points of optimum as established by the required laboratory test.
 (3) When required, cement shall be added to the other components of the mix
 in the proportions as directed, except that the Engineer may vary the amount of
 cement by as much as 20 percent, plus or minus. After the required amount of
 cement has been set by the Engineer, the rate shall not vary more than 5 pounds {2
 kg}.
 When required, lime shall be added to the other components of the mix in the
 proportions as directed. The quantity and percentage of lime shown on the plans or
 proposal are based on preliminary investigations and dry laboratory samples. The
 actual rate or amount to be added will be determined from density tests made just
 prior to beginning mixing operations. After the required amount of lime has been
 set by the Engineer, the rate shall not vary more than five percent.
 (4) When directed to be used, calcium chloride shall be added during the
 mixing operation by an approved metering device, or by separate scales as required
 for cement, at the rate of approximately 10 pounds {5 kg} per loose cubic yard
 {cubic meter} of mixture, based upon flake form. If other forms of calcium chloride
 are used, proportionate adjustment of rate of use and payment will be made. The
 amount of calcium chloride may be reduced or eliminated entirely as directed by
 the Engineer when weather conditions do not justify its use. No calcium chloride
 shall be added when cement is used.
 (5) If other additives are specified, they shall be added as directed.
 (6) The mixing plant shall not be operated at a speed or capacity that exceeds
 the manufacturer's rated capacity, established before mixing begins.
 (7) After the plant has been set and calibrated, the Contractor shall give the
 Engineer sufficient notice in advance of starting operations, and shall make
 available sufficient skilled operators for checking the calibrations before actual
 start of operations. Materials and personnel used in checking the calibration shall be
 furnished without additional compensation.
 
 (d) Placing of Base Materials.
 1. General.
 The operational procedure must be such that placement and processing of a layer will
 not damage the underlying layer or layers. Any material to be paid for by the cubic yard
 {cubic meter} shall be hauled in dump trucks whose volume may be readily determined.
 Premixed base and subbase materials shall be placed and spread by spreading equipment that
 will produce uniform layers of the required cross sections and thickness.
 2. CEMENT TREATED BASES.
 Cement treated bases and subbases shall be delivered and spread within 45 minutes
 after mixing. Mixtures containing cement that have not been shaped (except for final
 finishing) and compacted within three hours after mixing will be rejected and shall be
 removed promptly from the roadway and replaced at the Contractor's expense. For each base
 layer, the surface and thickness testing required in Article 301.05 shall be performed
 immediately upon compaction of the layer, and any variations from requirements shall be
 corrected immediately as specified in Article 301.05. All such base layers shall be kept moist
 157
 
 SECTION 301
 SOIL, SOIL AGGREGATE, AND AGGREGATE,
 BASE AND SUBBASES
 enough for proper curing until covered by the next layer or the prime. The top layer shall be
 primed as soon as the compacting, shaping, thickness, and surface requirements have been
 met and in no case later than the next day after the surface is approved by the Engineer,
 unless weather conditions prevent. Prime shall be applied in accordance with Section 401,
 except that Item 401.03(b)2 will not apply.
 Base material containing cement shall not be placed when the ground temperature in
 the shade is below 40 °F {4 °C}.
 3. Lime Treated Bases.
 Lime treated bases and subbases shall be delivered, spread, shaped, and compacted in
 the same day mixing occurs. Materials not compacted in the same day it is placed shall be
 reprocessed as directed at no additional cost to the State. Each base layer shall be tested for
 surface and thickness immediately after compaction in accordance with the provisions of
 Article 301.05 and any variations corrected as noted therein. The base layers shall be kept
 moist until covered by the next layer. Any cracking or other defects that may occur due to
 any cause or reason in any layer prior to being covered by the next plan layer shall be
 corrected immediately at no extra compensation.
 Base materials containing lime shall not be placed where the ground temperature in the
 shade is below 40 °F {4 °C} unless authorized by the Engineer.
 
 (e) Watering and Compaction.
 Each layer of base and subbase shall be compacted to density as specified in Section 306.
 Where base and shoulder layers are constructed separately, the Contractor shall select and
 employ whatever method or procedure is necessary to produce required density at the edges of
 the base layers and to prevent lateral movement of the base material during compaction.
 Compaction tests will be made on each base layer, and each layer shall be brought to required
 density before the next layer is placed. Additional watering in connection with compaction will be
 required to obtain required density at a uniform moisture content within two percentage points of
 optimum as determined by the required laboratory test, except that the moisture content for
 crushed aggregate base layers shall be a minimum of five percent or as directed.
 
 301.04 Shoulder Construction Requirements.
 (a) General.
 Shoulder construction requirements will be the same as provided for in Article 301.03 except
 as noted in this Article. Shoulders will be of two general types; standard or special design.
 Shoulder construction shall be so conducted that the base, shoulder, and adjacent side ditch will
 drain freely at all times. The shoulder slopes and ditches shall be dressed to reasonably close
 conformity to the designated lines, grades, and cross section.
 
 (b) Standard Shoulders.
 This type shoulder, where shown on the plans, shall be constructed by extending each
 subbase and base layer the full width from front slope to front slope in one operation. Materials
 and construction details for layers placed in the shoulder area will be the same as for base layers.
 
 (c) Special Design Shoulders.
 This type shoulder will consist of one or more layers of specified materials placed separately
 from the roadway base layers. This type shoulder may also include a drainage plane layer or a
 bituminous pavement or both. The composition and gradation of the materials and the width,
 thickness, and number of layers shall be as specified on the plans.
 The sequence of the construction for the layers placed in the shoulder area will be at the
 option of the Contractor provided such will accomplish the desired results and is kept abreast of
 roadway base construction.
 The drainage plane layer and the bituminous base and/or pavement shall be constructed in
 compliance with Section 315 and the appropriate Sections for the bituminous base or pavement.
 The layers placed in the shoulder area shall be constructed in compliance with specifications
 for base layers of the same materials.
 In spreading the next overlying layer of shoulder material on a drainage plane layer, special
 precaution shall be taken to prevent displacement of, or mixing with, the drainage plane material.
 This layer shall be placed by a spreader that will not touch or otherwise disturb the drainage plane
 layer. In order to accomplish the above, multiple passes will be permitted on wide shoulders.
 158
 
 SECTION 301
 SOIL, SOIL AGGREGATE, AND AGGREGATE,
 BASE AND SUBBASES
 Placement of this layer shall be so controlled that not more than 2000 feet {600 m} of drainage
 plane material will remain uncovered at any time. Use of any equipment that might mix the
 shoulder material into the underlying drainage plane layer will not be permitted.
 Layers placed in the shoulder area shall be compacted to the density specified in Section 306.
 
 301.05 Sampling and Testing.
 (a) General.
 All sampling and testing, except in-place density, will be performed on the complete in-place
 base or subbase layers after final mixing and spreading on the roadway has been completed except
 as noted in Subarticle 301.05(c) for cement treated base material. In-place density will be
 performed on the layers after final shaping and compacting has been completed.
 Any necessary sample holes, etc., required to satisfactorily establish the acceptability of any
 base layer shall be repaired by the Contractor immediately with like material. The cost of such
 repairs is considered to be incidental to the work and shall be performed without additional
 compensation.
 
 (b) Surface Requirements.
 The finished surface of each subbase or base layer shall not vary more than 1/2 of an inch {13
 mm} in any 25 foot {8 meter} section from a taut string applied parallel to the surface and
 roadbed centerline at the following locations: 1 foot {300 mm} inside the edges of subbase or
 base, at the centerline, and at other points as designated. The finished surface shall not vary
 more than 3/8 of an inch {10 mm} from the required section measured with a template placed at
 right angles to the roadbed centerline. The template shall be of a rigid frame adjustable metal
 type, accurately set, and at least as long as the width of base layer being checked up to 24 feet
 {7.2 m}. Additional widths may be checked by the use of string and Engineer's level. The
 Contractor shall furnish template, string, and necessary personnel to handle same under the
 direction of the Engineer.
 Where a Permeable Asphalt Treated Base (PATB) layer is to be placed (Pay Item 327-E), the
 finished base layer elevations shall not vary from design by more than 0.03 feet {10 mm} based on
 rod and level survey readings taken at a minimum of five locations across each lane (edge, outer
 wheel path, midlane, inner wheel path, and inside edge of lane) at longitudinal intervals not
 greater than 50 feet {15 m}. Surface irregularities shall not exceed 1/4 inch {7 mm} between two
 points longitudinally or transversely using a 10-foot {3 m} straightedge.
 
 (c) Gradation and Density.
 Testing for compliance will be made as specified in Subarticle 301.05(a) except that a layer
 with a cement additive will require the pretesting of the blended components prior to the addition
 of the cement additive on the primary belt at the mixing plant.
 The gradation of each layer will be checked at intervals as currently scheduled by the
 Department to determine compliance with the material specifications. Material falling outside of
 the specified bands of the general composition table shall be evaluated in accordance with the
 following: for each failing test, the price reduction will be five percent plus one percent for each
 percent for which the material failed to meet the required specifications. This applies to each
 sieve, percent clay, liquid limit (LL), or plasticity index (PI) requirement. These percentages are
 cumulative and apply to all material represented by that sample. If the resulting reduced unit
 price is less than 80% of the original unit price, the contractor will be given the option of
 modifying the in place material or removing and replacing the material. In either case, the
 gradation of the material will be re-tested for compliance with the material specifications.
 The density of each layer will be checked at intervals as currently scheduled by the
 Department to verify compliance with specification requirements. Density requirements are
 specified in Section 306.
 
 (d) Thickness.
 The thickness of each layer will be checked at intervals as currently scheduled by the
 Department and at closer intervals if necessary to determine the limits of any section found to be
 outside of the tolerance limits.
 1. For a layer placed under a "square yard " {"square meter"} item, the compacted thickness
 of the layer shall not be more than 1/2 of an inch {13 mm} less nor 1 inch {25 mm} more
 than the thickness specified on the plans or directed. A thickness greater than the 1 inch
 159
 
 SECTION 301
 SOIL, SOIL AGGREGATE, AND AGGREGATE,
 BASE AND SUBBASES
 {25 mm} tolerance may be accepted if uniform over a sufficient length to not materially
 affect the riding surface or reduce any required clearances and is within surface
 smoothness tolerances specified in Subarticle 301.05(b).
 2. For a layer placed under a "cubic yard" {"cubic meter"} item, the compacted thickness of
 the layer shall not exceed eight percent of each layer, plus or minus, of the designated
 thickness. Excess thickness above the eight percent noted above may be permitted to
 remain in place provided the riding surface is not affected and any required clearances
 are maintained, The excess material above the eight percent tolerance allowed will be
 deducted from the pay quantities.
 3. If the base layer contains cement, areas below required thickness or elevation shall be
 corrected by increasing the thickness of the next layer; or for the top layer, the surface
 may be brought to proper elevation and thickness with layers of bituminous plant mix of
 appropriate gradation where the pavement is to be a bituminous type. These leveling
 layers shall be placed ahead of a plant mix pavement layer or after a liquid surface
 treatment layer, if any. These layers shall be placed without additional compensation, or
 the Contractor may at his option remove and replace the deficient areas at his own
 expense. Low areas in the subgrade under concrete pavement shall be corrected as
 specified under Subarticle 450.03(c).
 
 (e) Width.
 The widths shown on the plans, or directed, shall be the widths used for determining the area
 for pay purposes of square yard {square meter} layers. Widths in excess of the designated width
 may be acceptable if not detrimental to the appearance or design of the project; however, no
 deviation in excess of 0.3 feet {90 mm} less than the designated dimension for each side of a
 roadway will be acceptable.
 
 301.06 Maintenance of the Work.
 Each base layer shall be maintained as provided herein without extra compensation until it is
 covered by a succeeding layer or acceptance of the contract. The surface shall be kept free of ruts,
 ridges, holes, and substantially true to profile, grade, and cross-section. Each base layer must have the
 required density and moisture at the time it is covered by another layer. However, maintenance
 requirements for moisture will be waived for Crushed Aggregate Base after the layer has been properly
 compacted with proper moisture content. No layer of base shall be covered by another layer or primed
 until it has been approved by the Engineer.
 Special attention is directed to the fact that lime or cement treated bases require special care to
 insure proper curing. Daily watering, rolling, or maintenance of curing material is considered an
 integral part of the work until the treated layer is covered by another layer or completion of the
 contract.
 The Engineer may re-test a primed base layer where he suspects that it does not have the
 required density and moisture. All areas found deficient shall be corrected by the Contractor, at his
 expense, prior to the placement of the next overlying layer.
 It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to protect the base from damage and to protect the
 prime from being picked up or damaged by traffic and to replace promptly any base or prime so
 damaged.
 
 301.07 Method of Measurement.
 (a) Base Materials.
 Measurement of base materials will be made in accordance with the particular item provided
 in the contract in accordance with the following:
 1. Square Yards {Square Meters}.
 Measurement by the square yard {square meter} will be made of a completed accepted
 layer of base constructed to the thickness and cross section shown on the plans or directed.
 All calculations of areas for payment shall be based on computations made to the nearest 0.1
 of a square yard {0.1 square meter}. The length will be measured along the surface of the
 layer at the centerline of the roadbed to the nearest 0.1 of a foot {0.1 m}. For transitions in
 thickness, the thickness will be measured to the midpoint of the transition. The width will be
 the top surface width of the layer as specified on the plans or directed. Each layer of
 crossovers, turnouts, and the like will be measured in square yards {square meters} by lengths
 160
 
 SECTION 301
 SOIL, SOIL AGGREGATE, AND AGGREGATE,
 BASE AND SUBBASES
 and widths along the top surface of the layer involved. No measurement will be made for the
 necessary bevel or wedge of material shown on the plans along the edge of each layer.
 Where the Engineer directs in writing that the thickness of a layer be changed from that
 specified on the plans, the accepted layer shall have an adjusted unit price derived by
 arriving at an increase or decrease to the contract unit price bid in direct proportion to the
 increased or decreased thickness of the adjusted layer. No payment shall be made for a layer
 completely eliminated.
 2. Cubic Yards {Cubic Meters}.
 Measurement by the cubic yard {cubic meter} will be the loose volume of the material
 measured in the hauling vehicle at the point of use.
 3. Tons {Metric Tons}.
 Measurement by the ton {metric ton} will be the quantity of material placed in a
 completed accepted layer of base constructed to the thickness and cross section shown on
 the plans or directed and measured in accordance with the provisions of Subarticle 109.01(h).
 
 (b) Cement.
 Measurement of cement will be by the ton {metric ton} for cement actually used in the work
 as directed, except cement used to repair or replace defective work.
 
 (c) Lime.
 Measurement of lime will be by the ton {metric ton} for lime actually used in the work as
 directed, except for lime used to repair or replace defective work.
 
 301.08 Basis of Payment.
 (a) Unit Price Coverage.
 1. The contract unit price bid shall be full compensation for furnishing or producing all
 component material, except cement and lime, in whatever proportions necessary to produce and
 place the base material, in accordance with the requirements specified, complete in place on the
 roadbed. It includes all costs for procurement, operations, compaction, watering, equipment,
 tools, labor, and incidentals necessary to complete the work. Cement and lime used as directed,
 in completed and accepted layers, will be the only other item for which separate payment will be

 401.01 Description.
 (a) General.
 The work covered by this Section consists of basic bituminous treatments such as prime coat,
 asphalt flush coats, liquid seals, and bituminous surface treatments.
 This Section also covers the work of applying a bituminous surface treatment containing a
 polymer additive.
 Each bituminous treatment shall consist of one or more hot applications of bituminous
 material and, except for prime coats, includes a specified cover aggregate which shall be spread
 after each bituminous application.
 The work also includes the cleaning of the existing surfaces as well as furnishing and applying
 all materials, and necessary incidental work thereto, all in accordance with plan details and these
 Specifications.
 
 (b) Bituminous Treatment Table.
 The following table shows the amount of bituminous material and the size and amount of
 cover aggregate required for the various types of bituminous treatments. The types are designated
 in the table by letters of the alphabet such as A, B, C, D, etc. The proposal will designate in the
 pay item description which of the various types are to be used. The kind of bitumen may also be
 specified or, if none is specified, the Contractor may select one of the kinds, if not in conflict with
 other provisions of these Specifications, permitted by the table. All other requirements of the
 tabular line opposite the type designation shall apply.
 (Example: A bituminous treatment Type AKG, specifies a prime coat with the quantities
 specified on line "A", covered by a single surface treatment with the quantities specified on line
 "K", covered in turn by a seal treatment with the quantities shown on line "G".)
 Bituminous materials shall be placed within the tolerance specified by the table for the type
 treatment involved, unless otherwise ordered by the Engineer in writing. Any variation outside of
 the designated limits shall be cause for ordering the treatment to be removed and replaced or
 corrected as directed by the Engineer, all without additional cost to the Department.
 The rate of aggregate coverage shown by the table is the approximate rate found to produce
 an acceptable coverage when properly applied. Regardless of the rate shown, the Contractor shall
 provide aggregate in sufficient quantities and so spread the aggregate that the bitumen is
 uniformly and evenly covered.
 The Engineer will notify the Contractor in writing should it become advisable to change the
 amounts of any material from the limits specified in the table. In such event an adjustment in the
 contract unit price will be made as specified in Subarticle 401.06(a).

 3. Aggregate Spreader.
 A self-propelled aggregate spreader with mechanically actuated spreading attachments
 and adjustable widths of satisfactory design and performance will be required; however,
 when the area to be processed is of such size or shape that to require the use of a mechanical
 spreader would be impractical, the Engineer may permit the aggregate to be spread
 manually.
 4. Rollers.
 A self-propelled steel wheel roller having a weight {mass} between 5 tons {4 metric tons}
 and 8 tons {7 metric tons} shall be required immediately behind the aggregate spreader
 followed by a self-propelled pneumatic tired roller. Only one coverage shall be made with the
 steel wheel roller.
 
 (b) Temperature and Weather Limitations For Placement Of Surface Treatments.
 All bituminous treatments shall be applied in strict conformity with the following:
 1. Seasonal
 No Bituminous Surface Treatment, which will be exposed to traffic, including shoulder
 paving, shall be placed between the dates of October 1 and May 1 in North Alabama and
 between the dates of November 1 and April 1 in South Alabama regardless of weather
 conditions. For the purpose of identification, South Alabama shall be referred to for projects
 lying partly or wholly in the area of the State lying south of latitude 33°N and with North
 Alabama encompassing the remaining or northern portion of the State. This seasonal
 limitation will not apply to Prime Coat.
 2. Weather.
 Bituminous surface treatments shall not be placed on a wet surface or when the Engineer
 will not allow the placement due to existing unfavorable weather conditions. They shall not
 be placed when the temperature is expected to fall below freezing during the night
 regardless of daytime temperature, when the ground is frozen, or when the surface

 It is recommended that, in general, liquid asphalt binders be used June through
 September and either emulsified asphalt or cutback be used the remainder of the season.
 Emulsified Petroleum Resin prime will not be required to be heated and shall be applied
 at ambient temperature. No Emulsified Petroleum Resin prime shall be placed when the
 ambient temperature is below freezing.
 3. Application of Bitumen.
 The bitumen shall be applied uniformly over the area to be treated. Where the
 treatment width is 26 feet {8 m} or less, the entire width shall be treated in one application,
 unless otherwise directed. Where only a partial width is treated in one application, extreme
 care shall be used to insure a slight overlap of adjacent treatments, but not in excess of 4
 inches {100 mm}.
 The spray bar shall be adjusted to the proper height for exact single or double overlap of
 spray area without partial overlap. Uniformity of discharge shall be checked before beginning
 application and at other times as directed. Streaked areas and any other areas lacking
 uniform distribution shall immediately be made uniform. In all cases the distributor shall be
 stopped before the application begins to run light (just before the distributor tank is
 completely empty). A method of making joints shall be used that will insure that in beginning
 181
 
 SECTION 401
 BITUMINOUS SURFACE TREATMENTS
 and ending the distribution of each load, a proper junction is made with the preceding and
 succeeding work without excessive bituminous material at the joints.
 In applying bituminous materials, the Contractor shall use effective means to protect
 structures, walls, curbs, etc. from discoloration or spattering.
 4. Special Details.
 Before applying a prime coat, the surface shall be prepared as provided in Subarticle
 401.03(c) above and, if necessary, it shall be sprinkled with water.
 After the prime coat has been applied, the contractor shall keep all traffic off the road
 until, in the opinion of the Engineer, the prime coat is dry and cured. When directed, the
 Contractor shall, without extra compensation, spread the minimum necessary amount of
 approved clean, coarse sand over the bituminous prime to prevent its breaking up under
 traffic or to speed up curing.
 No overlying surface shall be placed until the prime coat has been approved by the
 Engineer.
 The Contractor shall, without extra compensation, maintain the prime treatment and
 the surface of the base intact until it is covered by an application of a surfacing material.
 Maintenance shall include satisfactory repair to all holes, ravels, depressions, and areas
 deficient in prime so that the prime surface shall be smooth and of uniform texture before
 placing of an overlying surface.
 
 (e) Spreading and Embedding Aggregate.
 The size and amount of aggregate used shall be in accordance with provisions of Subarticle
 401.01(b) for the type treatment required by the plans or proposal.
 Spreading of aggregate shall follow application of bituminous material as closely as
 practicable using mechanical aggregate spreaders; inaccessible areas shall be covered as directed.
 Sufficient aggregate to cover each distributor load, in loaded trucks along with an adequate crew
 of workmen equipped with brooms standing by, shall be at the site before bituminous application
 begins.
 Spreading of the aggregate shall begin and continue immediately behind the application of
 the bituminous material. However, if excessive rolling of the aggregate occurs during spreading,
 the Engineer may allow the chip spreader to delay slightly in order to hold aggregate rolling to a
 minimum.
 Rolling shall begin immediately behind the spreading operation. Sufficient rollers shall be
 furnished to insure that the initial pass of the roller is made within five minutes of the spreading
 of the aggregate. Rolling shall be continuous, providing coverage of the entire area of treatment
 to insure thorough embedment of the aggregate.
 Unless a sufficient number of rollers are in operation to complete the above requirement, the
 next load of bituminous material shall not be applied until the rolling of the previous application is
 completed.
 When the Engineer determines the aggregate has been thoroughly embedded, rolling shall
 cease and the Contractor shall, without delay, remove all excess aggregate from the treatment
 area.
 
 (f) Special Construction Requirements for placing of Bituminous Treatment "L".
 When placing surface treatment "L", special emphasis will be placed on not allowing either
 public or construction traffic over the work while placing of the treatment; if this cannot be
 avoided, it shall be well controlled and kept to a minimum.
 The sequence of placement of the material shall be as follows:
 1st Step - Cleaning of surface and applying the first application of bitumen at the rate shown
 in Subarticle 401.01(b).
 2nd Step - Placement of cover aggregate so as to have a uniform cover in contact with the
 asphalt. The surface should then be rolled with a light roller to key the aggregate with
 the asphalt.
 3rd Step - Place dry choke aggregate and continue rolling and brooming until voids are filled.
 4th Step - Apply 2nd application of hot bitumen at rate shown in Subarticle 401.01(b).
 5th Step - Apply 2nd application of aggregate and continue brooming and rolling until the
 voids are filled and the aggregate is keyed to the asphalt.

 401.04 Maintenance and Protection of Surface and Traffic.
 Maintenance shall include immediate repair of any failures or defects that occur, repeated as
 often as is necessary to keep the surface continuously intact and acceptable. Maintenance shall be
 performed without direct compensation.
 Unless otherwise specified on the plans or in the proposal, the Contractor shall handle traffic
 through the work and over the surface except while bituminous material is actually being applied and
 covered with aggregate. It shall be his responsibility to take whatever steps are necessary or directed
 to protect both the work and the traveling public.
 
 401.05 Method of Measurement.
 Measurement will be made of the number of square yards {square meters} of accepted bituminous
 treatment, complete in place.
 The length shall be the actual length measured along the surface of the treatment. The width
 shall be the designated width of completed surface. Where the pay item specifies a prime coat plus an
 overlying treatment, the measurement will not include the additional width of the prime coat. Where
 the pay item specifies a prime coat only, the width will be the specified width of the prime coat.
 
 401.06 Basis of Payment.

 box at a rate sufficient to dampen the surface without any free flowing water ahead of the
 spreader box.
 
 (c) Application.
 The paving mixture shall be spread on the prepared surface in such a way as to leave a
 uniform finished surface. Care shall be taken when filling ruts to restore the designed profile of
 the pavement cross section. Excess crowning or overfilling of the rut area will not be permitted.
 The Contractor shall use squeegees and lutes to spread the mixture in areas inaccessible to the
 spreader box and areas requiring hand spreading. A sufficient amount of material shall be carried
 at all times in all parts of the spreader box to ensure complete coverage. No lumping, balling or
 unmixed aggregate shall be permitted. No segregation of the emulsion and aggregate fines from
 the coarse aggregate will be permitted. If the coarse aggregate settles to the bottom of the mix,
 the mix will be removed from the pavement. The paving mixture shall have proper consistency so
 that excessive splattering and excessive free water is avoided. The paving mixture shall be
 applied based on dry aggregate weight as specified on the plans.
 Adjustments to the additive will be permitted if necessary to provide a slower setting time
 when hand spreading is needed. If hand spreading is necessary, the mixture shall be poured in a
 small windrow along one edge of the surface to be covered and then spread uniformly by a hand
 squeegee or lute. A smooth, neat seam shall be provided where two passes meet. Excess material
 shall immediately be removed from ends of each run.

 SECTION 409
 TRIPLE LAYER BITUMINOUS SURFACE TREATMENT
 The distributor shall be equipped with a spray bar of adjustable height, hand hose, and
 nozzle.
 3. Aggregate Spreader.
 A self-propelled aggregate spreader with mechanically actuated spreading attachments
 and adjustable widths of satisfactory design and performance will be required; however,
 when the area to be processed is of such size or shapes that to require the use of a
 mechanical spreader would be impractical, the Engineer may permit the aggregate to be
 spread manually.
 4. Rollers.
 A self-propelled steel wheel roller having a weight {mass} between 3 tons {3 metric tons}
 and 8 tons {7 metric tons} shall be required immediately behind the aggregate spreader
 followed by a self-propelled pneumatic tired roller. The Contractor shall ensure that the
 roller weights within these limits can properly seat the aggregate without fracturing the
 aggregate. Only one coverage shall be made with the steel wheel roller.
 A self-propelled, two axles, pneumatic-tired rollers with smooth-tread rubber tires
 aligned such that gaps between the tires on one axle are covered by the tires of the other
 axle shall be required. The Contractor shall ensure that all tires are of the same size and ply
 rating and inflated to a minimum of 60 psi {415 kPa}. The Contractor shall maintain tire
 pressure such that the difference in pressure between any two tires does not exceed 5 psi {35
 kPa}.
 
 (b) Temperature and Weather Limitations for Placement of Surface Treatments.
 All bituminous treatments shall be applied in strict conformity with the following:
 1. Seasonal.
 No Bituminous Surface Treatment, which will be exposed to traffic, including shoulder
 paving, shall be placed between the dates of October 1 and May 1 in North Alabama and
 between the dates of November 1 and April 1 in South Alabama regardless of weather
 conditions. For the purpose of identification, South Alabama shall be referred to for projects
 lying partly or wholly in the area of the State lying south of latitude 33°N and with North
 Alabama encompassing the remaining or northern portion of the State.
 2. Weather.
 Bituminous surface treatments shall not be placed on a wet surface or when the Engineer
 will not allow the placement due to existing unfavorable weather conditions. They shall not
 be placed when the temperature is expected to fall below freezing during the night
 regardless of daytime temperature, when the ground is frozen, or when the surface
 temperature is less than 32°F {0°C}.

 SECTION 409
 TRIPLE LAYER BITUMINOUS SURFACE TREATMENT
 
 (d) Application of Bituminous Material.
 1. General.
 No bituminous material or treatment shall be applied until the base or underlying surface
 has been approved.
 2. Preparation of Bituminous Material.
 Bituminous materials used for each treatment shall be heated as previously noted. The
 material shall be maintained within the specific temperature range during application. Any
 material which has not been maintained within the specified range shall be rejected. The
 application temperature (°F {°C}) range for the Emulsified Asphalt with polymer additive
 shall be 140 °F – 180 °F {60°C - 80°C}.
 The bitumen shall be applied uniformly over the area to be treated. Where the
 treatment width is 26 feet {8 m} or less, the entire width shall be treated in one application,
 unless otherwise directed. Where only a partial width is treated in one application, extreme
 care shall be used to insure a slight overlap of adjacent treatments, but not in excess of 4
 inches {100 mm}.
 The spray bar shall be adjusted to the proper height for exact single or double overlap of
 spray area without partial overlap. Uniformity of discharge shall be checked before beginning
 application and at other times as directed by the Engineer. Streaked areas and any other
 areas lacking uniform distribution shall immediately be made uniform. In all cases the
 distributor shall be stopped before the application begins to run light (just before the
 distributor tank is completely empty). A method of making joints shall be used that will
 insure that in beginning and ending the distribution of each load, a proper junction is made
 with the preceding and succeeding work without excessive bituminous material at the joints.
 In applying bituminous materials, the Contractor shall use effective means to protect
 structures, walls, curbs, etc. from discoloration or spattering.
 3. Application of Bituminous Materials.

 Spreading of aggregate shall follow application of bituminous material as closely as
 practicable using mechanical aggregate spreaders; inaccessible areas shall be covered as directed.
 Sufficient aggregate to cover each distributor load, in loaded trucks along with an adequate crew
 of workmen equipped with brooms standing by, shall be at the site before bituminous application
 begins.
 Spreading of the aggregate shall begin and continue immediately behind the application of
 the bituminous material.
 201
 
 SECTION 410
 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 Rolling shall begin immediately behind the spreading operation. Sufficient rollers shall be
 furnished to insure that the initial pass of the roller is made immediately behind the spreading of
 the aggregate. Rolling shall be continuous, providing coverage of the entire area of treatment a
 minimum of three (3) passes for each layer of aggregate to insure thorough embedment of the
 aggregate.
 Unless a sufficient number of rollers are in operation to complete the above requirement, the
 next load of bituminous material shall not be applied until the rolling of the previous application is
 completed.
 When the Engineer determines the aggregate has been thoroughly embedded, rolling shall
 cease and the Contractor shall, without delay, remove all excess aggregate from the treatment
 area.
 The Contractor shall stage his day’s work such that all three layers are placed at the end of
 each day’s work.
 
 409.04 Maintenance and Protection of Surface and Traffic.
 Maintenance shall include immediate repair of any failures or defects that occur, repeated as
 often as is necessary to keep the surface continuously intact and acceptable. Maintenance shall be
 performed without direct compensation.
 Unless otherwise specified on the plans or in the proposal, the Contractor shall handle traffic
 through the work and over the surface except while bituminous material is actually being applied and
 covered with aggregate. It shall be his responsibility to take whatever steps are necessary or directed
 to protect both the work and the traveling public. Both the first application layer and the second
 application layer shall be completed before opening the road to traffic. Traffic control shall be
 established such that traffic is not allowed to sit on the newly applied bituminous surface treatment.
 
 409.05 Method of Measurement.
 Measurement will be made of the number of square yards {square meters} of accepted triple layer
 bituminous treatment, complete in place.
 The length shall be the actual length measured along the surface of the treatment. The width
 shall be the designated width of completed surface. Where the pay item specifies a prime coat plus an
 overlying treatment, the measurement will not include the additional width of the prime coat.
 
 409.06 Basis of Payment.
 (a) Unit Price Coverage.
 Payment for accepted triple layer bituminous surface treatment, Pay Item No. 409-A Triple
 Layer Bituminous Treatment, measured as provided above, will be paid for at the contract unit
 price per square yard {square meter} complete in place; except that adjustments in the contract
 unit price shall be made as follows: When changes in amounts of treatment materials are ordered
 as provided in Article 409.01, the contract unit price will be adjusted upward or downward
 accordingly. Adjustment will be based on the increase or decrease in amounts per square yard
 {square meter}, at the verified cost, f.o.b. delivery point plus 2 cents per gallon {0.5 cent per
 liter} for the bitumen, and the verified cost per square yard {cubic meter} for the aggregate
 delivered to the spreader. The contract unit price or adjusted contract unit price for the accepted
 area complete in place shall be payment in full for furnishing all material, placement of materials,
 maintenance thereof and for all equipment, tools, labor, and incidentals necessary to complete
 the work.

 SECTION 410
 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 410.01 Description.
 The work under this Section covers the general requirements that are applicable to all types of hot
 and warm mix asphalt pavements of the plant mix type. Deviations from these general requirements
 202
 
 SECTION 410
 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 will be indicated in the specific requirements for various types of mixes noted in the following sections
 of these Specifications.
 This work shall consist of one or more courses of hot and warm mix asphalt plant mix constructed
 in accordance with these specifications and the specific requirements of the type of mixture required
 and in reasonably close conformity with the lines, grades, thicknesses, and typical cross sections shown
 on the plans or established by the Engineer. The Contractor may use either hot mix or warm mix for all
 Superpave ESAL Range mixes in Section 424. Warm mix asphalt shall be defined as the use of an
 approved warm mix technology in the plant mix at the time of production.
 This work shall also include the preparation of the underlying surface on which the plant mix is to
 be placed, including patching and/or leveling as shown on the plans or directed by the Engineer.
 In addition, this work shall also include the placing of widening at locations shown on the plans
 and/or directed by the Engineer. In general, widening shall consist of (1) narrow width build-ups, three
 feet or less {one meter or less}, required for widening existing pavement, (2) paving for turn-outs
 beyond three feet {one meter} from the edge of pavement, (3) pavement crossovers, and (4) turning
 lanes of less than 200 feet {60 m} for crossovers. Paving used on turn-outs for intersecting paved roads
 and shoulder paving will not be considered as widening unless shown on the plans.
 Surface layers and wearing layers are defined as those layers where the pay item contains the
 wording “Wearing Surface”.
 All ALDOT procedures referenced are applicable to both hot and warm mix asphalt.
 
 410.02 Materials.
 (a) Applicable Sections of Specifications.
 Materials shall conform to requirements given in Sections 327, 420, 423 and 424.
 
 (b) Products and Processes for the production of Warm Mix Asphalt.
 Warm Mix Asphalt products and processes shall be selected from List II-27, “Warm Mix Asphalt
 Products and Processes” of the Department's manual titled "Materials, Sources, and Devices with
 Special Acceptance Requirements". Information concerning this list is given in Subarticle 106.01(f)
 and ALDOT-355.
 
 (c) Anti-Stripping Agents.
 All warm mix asphalt mixtures shall include an anti-stripping agent. The warm mix additive
 supplier may certify that an anti-stripping agent is an integral part of the warm mix additive.
 All hot mix asphalt mixtures except 327 and 420 shall be tested during design to determine if
 an anti-stripping agent is needed. During design and production, all other mixes shall have a
 tensile strength ratio (TSR) of at least 0.80 when tested in accordance with AASHTO T 283 as
 modified by ALDOT-361. If any TSR value falls below the minimum specified above, plant
 operations shall cease until corrective measures are taken. However, if any visual stripping occurs
 in the design or field production, an anti-stripping agent shall be required if deemed necessary by
 the Engineer. Should it become necessary for the Contractor to include an anti-strip agent in the
 mix due to the occurrence of visual stripping during field production of the mix after the design
 tests indicated that the same mix met the above listed TSR requirement, such work will be paid
 for as Extra Work as defined by Article 104.03. Additional payment for the anti-strip agent will not
 be made in cases where the same mix has been previously used in field production and visual
 stripping occurred.
 1. Amines.
 For amine based materials, the amount of anti-stripping agent, when required, shall be
 0.25 to 1.0 % by weight {mass} of the liquid asphalt binder content for liquid agents and 0.5
 to 2.0 % by weight {mass} of the total aggregate for powdered agents. Liquid anti-stripping
 agent shall be added to the liquid asphalt binder within 10% of the specified rate, either at
 the refinery or the Contractor's mixing plant, using approved on-line blending equipment.
 2. Hydrated Lime.
 For hydrated lime materials the amount of anti-stripping agent, when required,
 shall be 0.5 to 2.0 % by weight {mass} of the total aggregate for powdered agents. Hydrated
 lime materials shall meet the requirements as given in Section 805.
 3. OrganoSilanes.
 For organosilane based materials the amount of anti-stripping agent, when required,
 shall be 0.05 to 0.1 % by weight {mass} of the liquid asphalt binder content for liquid agents.
 203
 
 SECTION 410
 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 Liquid anti-stripping agent shall be added to the liquid asphalt binder by approved on-line
 blending equipment either at the refinery or the Contractor's mixing plant within 10% of the
 specified rate.
 4. Silicone
 Silicone may be used in liquid asphalt binder, not to exceed 2 ounces per 5000 gallons {3
 ml per 1000 L}. Except when producing Warm Mix Asphalt, other additives shall not be added
 to the liquid asphalt binder unless expressly authorized in writing by the Materials and Tests
 Engineer.
 The use of any unauthorized additive will be cause for rejection of the mixture.
 
 (d) Composition of Mixtures.
 1. Adjustments to Rate of Placement.
 The project designated rate per square yard {square meter} of the plant mix layers are
 designed assuming a compacted mix unit weight {mass} of not greater than 158 pounds per
 cubic foot {2530 kg/m3} for dense graded mixes (light weight aggregates excepted.) Hence, a
 correction to the plan designated rate per square yard {square meter} will be made in
 accordance with the following:
 • If the compacted mix density as determined in the job mix formula design exceeds
 158 , or is below 130, pounds per cubic foot, {2530 kg/m 3, or is below 2080 kg/m3},
 the correction will be based on the formula: x = ab/158 {x = ab/2530}, where
 x = corrected rate per square yard {square meter},
 a = laboratory compacted mix unit weight in pounds per cubic foot {density in
 kilograms per cubic meter} as shown in the job mix formula, and
 b = project designated rate per square yard {square meter} of plant mix as
 shown on the job plans.
 • If the laboratory compacted density is between 130 pounds per cubic foot and 158
 pounds per cubic foot {2080 kg/m3 and 2530 kg/m3}, no correction will be made to
 the pounds per square yard {kilograms per square meter} designated by the plans or
 proposal.
 • If the plans provide for the use of lightweight aggregate (expanded clay or shale),
 the pounds per square yard {kilograms per square meter} of the layer shown by the
 plans or proposal will not be adjusted.
 • If the plans provide for the use of an "Open Graded" plant mix layer, the pounds per
 square yard {kilograms per square meter} of the layer shown by the plans or proposal
 will not be adjusted.
 2. Requirement for Approved Job Mix Formula (JMF).
 Work shall not be started under this Section on a specific project until the Contractor
 has submitted and received approval of a job mix formula from the Materials and Tests
 Engineer and the job mix formula has been checked by the Area Materials Engineer for use on
 the project.
 A change in aggregate sources will require a new job mix formula before the new
 material is used. A change in liquid asphalt binder source and anti-stripping agent will be
 allowed without a new job mix formula provided the design criteria is met by a one-point
 check of the mixture. The one-point check shall include the Air Void content, VMA, Stability,
 Flow, and TSR (Tensile Strength Ratio) and may be determined during the production of the
 mix. However, no change in the grade of liquid asphalt binder will be allowed without the
 written approval of the Materials and Tests Engineer.
 3. Contractor's Responsibility for Job Mix Formula.
 Designs for all mixes shall be the responsibility of the Contractor and shall be submitted
 by the Contractor for approval. Refer to applicable Sections (420, 424, etc.) for design
 criteria. The submitted formula shall have been designed by a certified technician (Level III Designer) in a laboratory that has been certified by the Department.
 4. Approval of Job Mix Formula by Materials and Tests Engineer.
 The Contractor shall submit to the Materials and Tests Engineer, for approval, a Job Mix
 Formula (JMF) for each mixture to be supplied from a specific plant. The Contractor shall
 allow at least four weeks for the evaluation and approval of the job mix formula.
 204
 
 SECTION 410
 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 The submitted formula shall include any additive by type and trade name and be
 accompanied by samples from the material sources the Contractor proposes to use in
 producing the mix. The job mix formula for each mixture shall establish a single percentage
 of aggregate passing each required sieve size, a single percentage of liquid asphalt binder to
 be added to the aggregate, a single percentage of any additive, and a mixing temperature
 range suitable for the type, grade, etc. of liquid asphalt binder to be used in the mix. Each
 job mix formula shall be accompanied by a test report from an approved laboratory certifying
 that all current Departmental design test parameters have been met (copies of the
 Departmental current design test parameters may be obtained from the office of the
 Materials and Tests Engineer). There will be no charge for the Department's checking of the
 Contractor's job mix formula.
 The approved job mix formula for each mixture shall be in effect for a maximum of four
 years from the approval date on the job mix formula or until the Materials and Tests Engineer
 withdraws approval by written order.
 5. Approval of Job Mix Formula by Area Materials Engineer.
 At least two full working days prior to beginning the production of asphalt mix for a
 specific project, the Contractor shall submit a mix design (approved by the Materials and
 Tests Engineer) to the Area Materials Engineer. The project number shall be inserted on the
 approved job mix formula. The Area Materials Engineer will review the mix design to
 determine if the job mix formula is appropriate for the specific project. If the job mix
 formula is appropriate for the project, the Area Materials Engineer will sign the mix design as
 being approved, will note the date of approval, and will distribute copies for inspection of
 the asphalt production.
 A copy of this approved job mix formula with the Materials and Tests Engineer's approval
 and the Area Materials Engineer's approval (with the date of approval) shall be available at
 the plant any time material is being delivered to the State.
 6. Establishment of Delivery Temperature.
 The Engineer will check and record the temperature of the mixture upon delivery to the
 project site. The minimum delivery temperature for warm mix asphalt shall be 220 °F {104
 °C}. The minimum delivery temperature for hot mix asphalt shall be 250 °F {121 °C}. The
 Engineer should monitor the work to ensure that there is not high variability in the delivery
 temperatures or isolated loads of temperature differentials that appear extreme. For pay
 items that do not require density as a pay factor (patching, widening, etc.) and for mixes that
 do not require density as a pay factor (OGFC, PATB, etc) the Contractor shall provide a +/- 25
 o
 F {11 oC} delivery temperature range.
 No loads will be accepted at a temperature greater than 350 °F {177 °C} for hot mix or
 warm mix asphalt.
 7. Conformance to Approved Job Mix Formula.
 All mixtures furnished for use on the project shall conform to the approved job mix
 formulas within the following ranges of tolerances:
 • All liquid asphalt binders used shall meet the requirements given in Section 804. See
 appropriate pay factor table for liquid asphalt binder content requirements.
 • The mixing temperature shall not exceed 350 F {177 C}.
 • Tolerances for 327, 420 and 424 mixes:
 - Plus or minus 7 % for the #4 {4.75 mm} and larger sieve requirements.
 - Plus or minus 4 % for the #8 through #100 {2.36 mm through 150 m} sieve
 requirements.
 - Plus or minus 2.0 % for the #200 {75 m} sieve requirement.
 See Section 423 for gradation requirements for 423 mixes.
 The initial setting of the controls for all materials shall be those amounts shown on the
 job mix formula. The above tolerances are provided for slight variations inherent in job
 control applications. The Contractor shall make changes as necessary to ensure that the
 mixture produced is as close as practical to the job mix formula.
 8. Consistency of Mix Design in Placement of Wearing Layer.
 More than one job mix formula may be submitted and approved for a layer of pavement.
 The placement of the entire wearing layer shall be from the same job mix unless otherwise
 205
 
 SECTION 410
 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 approved in writing by the Engineer. For layers other than the wearing layer, the Contractor
 shall notify the Engineer in writing of the mix design change prior to changing production.
 
 (e) Recycled Asphalt Plant Mix (RAP) and Reclaimed Asphalt Shingles (RAS).
 1. Compliance with ALDOT-372.
 On all projects utilizing recycled/reclaimed material in the mixture, the Contractor's
 paving operation and RAP and RAS processing shall conform to the requirements given in
 ALDOT-372. The recycled hot and warm mix asphalt shall be a homogeneous mixture of
 reclaimed material, new aggregate (fine or coarse aggregate, or a mixture of fine and coarse
 aggregate) and new liquid asphalt binder material.
 2. Allowable Usage of RAP and RAS.

 RAP used in 3/8 inch {9.5 mm} Section 424 "Superpave" maximum aggregate size mix
 shall be processed so that 100 % of the RAP passes the 1/2 inch {12.5 mm} sieve. For all other
 mixes, the maximum size of the aggregate in the RAP shall meet the maximum size for the
 mix specified. The aggregate in the RAP shall meet the aggregate requirements of the mix it
 is used in and the requirements given in Sections 801 and 802 (no gravel in Section 327 PATB,
 Section 420 and Section 423 mixes). RAP used in Section 327 PATB and Section 420 mixes
 shall be processed so that 100 % of the RAP is retained on the No. 4 {4.75 mm} sieve.
 4. Reclaimed Asphalt Shingles (RAS).
 Reclaimed Asphalt Shingles (RAS) shall be handled, stored, and used in accordance with
 the requirements given in ALDOT 372 and the following requirements.

 (f) Liquid Asphalt Binder Draindown.
 1. Fiber Stabilizer.
 A fiber stabilizer is required for some mix types (Section 420, 423, etc). A fiber
 stabilizer may be used on other mix types where asphalt binder cement draindown is a
 problem. Where RAS is included in the job mix formula, fiber stabilizer shall not be required
 provided the draindown requirements of 0.30% or less are met when tested at 325°F {163°C}
 and 350°F {176°C} in accordance with AASHTO T305.
 When fiber is used, the dosage rate shall produce a maximum liquid asphalt binder
 cement draindown of 0.30 % or less when tested at 325°F {163°C} and 350°F {176°C} in
 accordance with AASHTO T305. When fiber is used, the sampling and testing frequency for all
 mixes for both Contractor and Department testing during production shall be one test for
 each 5000 tons {metric tons} or portion thereof. The fiber shall be listed on List II-23, Fibers
 for use in Hot Mix Asphalt (from the Materials, Sources, and Devices with Special Acceptance
 Requirements (MSDSAR) manual). If pelletized fibers are used, the fiber within the pellet
 shall be listed on List II-23. All fibers listed on List II-23 shall meet the requirements of either
 Item 2, 3, or 4 of this Subarticle.
 2. Cellulose Fibers.
 The maximum length of the fiber shall be 0.25 inches {6.35 mm}. A representative
 3 gram sample, when heated in a crucible between 1100 and 1200 F {595 and 650 C} for at
 least 2 hours, shall show between 13 % and 23 % non-volatiles. A representative 5 gram
 sample, when stirred into 100 ml of distilled water, shall have a pH between 6.5 and 8.5 after
 sitting for 30 minutes. A representative 5 gram sample, when saturated with mineral spirits
 for 5 minutes and then sieved for 10 minutes on a No. 40 {425 m} sieve, shall absorb
 between 4 % and 6 % its own weight of mineral spirits. A representative 10 gram sample,
 when weighed and placed into a 250 F {121 C} oven for two hours, shall lose less than 5 % by
 weight when weighed immediately upon removal from the oven.
 Sieve analysis of the cellulose fiber shall be either of the following methods:
 • Using an Alpine Air Jet Sieve (Type LS), a representative 5 gram sample of the fiber
 is sieved for 14 minutes at a controlled vacuum of 11 psi {75.8 kPa}. The fibers
 remaining on the screen are weighed. The results of this analysis shall indicate that
 60 % to 80 % of the fiber passes the No. 100 {150 m} sieve. Or:
 • Using a Mesh Screen Analysis, a representative 10 gram sample of the fiber is sieved
 using a shaker with two nylon brushes on each screen. The results of this analysis
 shall indicate that the fiber has the following amounts passing the specified
 screens: 75 % to 95 % on the No. 20 {850 m} sieve, 55 % to 75 % on the No. 40 {425
 m} sieve, and 20 % to 40 % on the No. 140 {100 m} sieve.
 3. Mineral Fibers.
 When tested in accordance with the Bauer-McNett Classifier (BCM) fractionation method
 process procedure, the fiber length shall have a maximum mean test value of 0.25 inches
 {6.35 mm}. By using a phase contrast microscope, and a representative test sample of at least
 200 fibers, the fiber diameter shall have a maximum mean test value of 0.0002 inches {5.1
 m}. The shot content passing the No. 60 {285 m} sieve shall be 85% to 95%. The shot
 207
 
 SECTION 410
 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 content passing the No. 230 {65 m} sieve shall be 60 % to 80 %. This is a measure of nonfibrous material determined on vibrating sieves (for further information see ASTM C 612).
 4. Synthetic Fibers.
 Synthetic fibers shall include but are not limited to one or a combination of the
 following: polyolefins (such as polyethylene and polypropylene) and aramids (such as Kevlar,
 Twaron and Nomex). Fibers shall be twisted fibrillated, flat fibrillated or monofilament with a
 maximum fiber length of 0.75 inches {19 mm}
 5. Placing Fiber in Mix.
 a. Manual Method.
 Provided it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Engineer that the proper
 dosage of the fibers is uniformly distributed into the mix, manual introduction of fibers is
 acceptable when a batch plant is used to make the mix. When the fibers are available in
 prepackaged (weighed) containers, proper dosage may be pre-determined per batch. A
 device is required to interrupt mixture production and warn the plant operator if the
 operator manually feeding the fiber fails to introduce it properly. Dry mixing time shall
 be increased at least five seconds to insure adequate blending. Wet mixing time shall be
 increased at least five seconds for cellulose fibers and up to five seconds for mineral
 fibers. Manual introduction of fibers shall not be used in drum plants.
 b. Automatic Method.
 Methodology and equipment for metering bulk loose and pelletized fiber into
 asphalt plants has been developed by the fiber suppliers. Whenever the fiber supplier’s
 recommendations are more stringent than this specification, the fiber supplier’s
 recommendations are controlling. This specification requires specialized equipment that
 can accurately proportion and meter, by weight {mass}, the proper amount per batch
 (for batch plants) or continuously, in a steady uniform manner (for drum plants). Fiber,
 pelletized or loose, shall not be fed through the cold feed bins or through the rap bin.
 These proportioning devices shall be interlocked with the plant system and
 controlled to +/-10% of the weight of the fibers required so as to maintain the correct
 proportions for all production rates and batch sizes. During the test strip, an equipment
 calibration check which shows the fiber is being accurately metered and uniformly
 distributed into the mix shall be performed to the satisfaction of the Engineer. These
 metering devices shall provide in process high flow (+ 10% or more) and low flow (-10% or
 less) plant operator notification and interrupt the mix production where the fiber rate is
 not properly controlled. The fiber metering system shall also provide a record of feed
 rate (weight or mass per time) and include a section of translucent pipe for visual
 confirmation of consistent flow rates. Care shall be taken to insure that the fibers are
 not entrained in the plant’s exhaust system. If there is any evidence of fiber in the baghouse or wet-washer fines, the liquid asphalt binder line and/or the fiber line shall be
 relocated so that the fiber is captured by liquid asphalt binder spray and incorporated
 into the mix. If there is any evidence of clumps of fibers or pellets at the discharge
 chute, the contractor shall increase the mixing time and/or intensity. This may entail
 extending the liquid asphalt binder and fiber feeding lines further into the drum.
 
 (g) Sampling and Inspection.
 Aggregates will be accepted in stockpiles in accordance with the Department's Testing Manual
 provided there is no segregation or contamination, but production of required gradation in the mix
 shall be the Contractor's responsibility.
 Liquid asphalt binder will be accepted in accordance with the requirements given in ALDOT243.
 The right is reserved to take samples, including aggregates from stockpiles, plant mix from
 the hot elevator, plant mix from the spreader, liquid asphalt binder from storage tanks at the
 plant, etc., and to make further tests as needed as a basis for continued acceptance of the
 materials.
 Samples of the mixture in use will be taken and tested in accordance with Subarticle
 106.09(b).
 When directed, the Contractor shall use mechanical equipment to cut samples for testing
 from the compacted pavement. Samples not smaller than 4 inches {100 mm} square or 4 inches
 {100 mm} in diameter for the full depth of the course to be tested shall be taken at the locations
 208
 
 SECTION 410
 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 directed by the Engineer. Furnishing of suitable approved cutting equipment, the cutting of the
 samples, and the immediate repair of the sample holes with similar type of material shall be
 performed by the Contractor without extra compensation.
 A laboratory shall be furnished for the control of each hot and warm mix asphalt plant in
 accordance with the provisions of Section 601.
 
 410.03 Construction Requirements.

 return uniformly to the aggregate mixture all or any part of the material collected.
 2. Scales.
 A digital recorder shall be installed as part of the platform truck scales. The recorder
 shall produce a printed digital record on a ticket of the gross and tare weights {masses} of the
 delivery trucks along with a time and date print for each ticket. Provisions shall be made so
 that scales may not be manually manipulated during the printing process, and so interlocked
 as to allow printing only when the scale has come to rest. The scales and recorder shall be of
 sufficient capacity and size to accurately determine the weight {mass} of the heaviest loaded
 truck or tractor trailers that are used for the delivery of the hot and warm mix asphalt from
 that plant.
 In lieu of plant and truck scales, the Contractor may provide either (1) an approved
 automatic printer system which will print the weights {masses} of the material delivered
 (evidenced by a weight {mass} ticket for each load), provided the system is used in
 conjunction with an approved automatic batching and control system, or (2) an electronic
 load cell weight {mass} determination system with associated computer hardware and
 automated printing system.
 The Contractor may provide a "weigh {mass} batcher" system utilizing a weigh {mass}
 hopper equipped with load cells that determine the net amount of mix delivered from the

 The Contractor shall use a hopper insert with a material remixing device if Pay Item
 410-H is included in the contract. On projects where Pay Item 410-H is not included in
 the contract, use of a hopper insert is preferred, but not required.
 4. Asphalt Pavers or Spreaders.
 Asphalt pavers or spreaders shall be self-contained and of sufficient size, power, and
 stability to receive, distribute, and strike off the asphalt material at rates and widths
 consistent with the specified typical section requirements and details shown on the plans and
 noted in Item 410.03(f)2.
 All asphalt pavers or spreaders used for mainline paving, including shoulders and
 interchange ramps, shall be equipped with a full width vibratory, or other compactive type,
 screed. The augers used to move the material across the width of the screed shall extend
 within 1.5 feet {450 mm} of the edge of the screed. It will be permissible to use a
 hydraulically extendable strikeoff for paving turnouts and short sections of pavement
 including variable width sections and crossovers.
 When laying mixtures, the paver shall be capable of being operated at forward speeds
 consistent with satisfactory laying of the mixture, providing a finished surface of the required
 evenness and texture without tearing, gouging, or shoving of the mixture.
 All asphalt paving machines shall be operated with automatic grade and slope controls
 unless otherwise directed by the Engineer. The automatic grade controls shall be a contact
 ski, a mobile stringline, or non-contact sonic averaging sensors. The effective length of these
 controls shall be a minimum of 24 feet {7.3 m}. In the event of a malfunction of the
 automatic control system, the spreading operation shall be discontinued after one hour until
 the equipment is repaired.
 If shown to be required on the plans, special attachments to the pavers and spreaders
 will be required to shape and finish the pavement.
 5. Compaction Equipment.
 Compaction equipment shall be capable of compacting the mixture to the required
 density throughout the depth of the layer while it is still in a workable condition without
 damage to the material. The Contractor shall be responsible for the selection of the types
 and number of rollers to be used.
 
 (b) Daylight, Wet Weather, and Temperature Limitations.
 1. Operations in Daylight.
 Placement and compaction operations shall be performed during daylight hours unless
 noted otherwise on the plans or directed otherwise by the Engineer. (The requirements for
 lighting for nighttime work are given in Subarticle 104.04(a)).
 2. Wet Weather.
 The mixture shall be laid only upon an approved underlying course, which is dry, and
 only when weather conditions are suitable. The Engineer may, however, permit work of this
 character to continue when overtaken by sudden rains, up to the amount which may be in
 transit from the plant at the time, provided the surface just ahead of the placement is swept
 clear of water and the mixture is within the allowable temperature tolerances. The layer
 placed under such conditions shall be at the Contractor's risk and shall be removed and
 replaced by the Contractor without extra compensation should it prove unsatisfactory.
 3. Cold Weather Restrictions.
 Hot mix asphalt (HMA) layers of 200 pounds per square yard {110 kg/m 2} or less shall not
 be placed when the surface or air temperature is below 40 ºF {4 ºC}; air temperature shall be
 40 ºF {4 ºC} before the spreading operation is started. Spreading operations shall be stopped
 when the air temperature is below 45 ºF {7 ºC} and falling.For HMA layers over 200 pounds
 per square yard {110 kg/m2}, the above temperature may be lowered 5 F {2 C}. Unless
 otherwise stated in the plans and specifications, polymer modified HMA layers of 200 pounds
 per square yard {110 kg/m2} or less shall not be placed when the surface or air temperature is
 below 60 oF {15 oC}; for layers over 200 pounds per square yard {110 kg/m2}, the above
 temperature may be lowered 10 F {5 C}.
 
 211
 
 SECTION 410
 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 Warm mix asphalt (WMA) layers of 200 pounds per square yard {110 kg/m 2} or less shall
 not be placed when the surface or air temperature is below 32 ºF {0 ºC}; air temperature shall
 be 32 ºF {0 ºC} before the spreading operation is started. Spreading operations shall be
 stopped when the air temperature is below 35 ºF {2 ºC} and falling.For WMA layers over 200
 pounds per square yard {110 kg/m2}, the above temperature may be lowered 5 F {2 C}.
 Unless otherwise stated in the plans and specifications, polymer modified WMA layers of 200
 pounds per square yard {110 kg/m2} or less shall not be placed when the surface or air
 temperature is below 50 oF {10 oC}; for layers over 200 pounds per square yard {110 kg/m 2},
 the above temperature may be lowered 10 F {5 C}.
 With the exception of Section 420 "Polymer Modified Open Graded Friction Course" layers
 and any asphalt mixes containing RAS, the Contractor may place HMA and WMA layers at
 temperatures lower than the cold weather limits. The Contractor is warned that other factors
 such as wind speed and percent humidity may increase the heat loss from the HMA and WMA
 layers. All other requirements for the installation and quality of the HMA and WMA layers
 shall be applicable to the work even when the restrictions against placement of the HMA and
 WMA during cold weather are not followed. The layers placed under such conditions shall be
 at the Contractor's risk and shall be removed and replaced without extra compensation if they
 are unacceptable. There will be no direct payment for additional costs associated with the
 placement of HMA and WMA during cold weather.
 
 (c) Preparation of Underlying Surface.
 1. General.
 The underlying surface must be approved by the Engineer before the placement of a
 plant mix application will be allowed. The underlying surface, whether an old surface or a
 new surface, shall be thoroughly cleaned of all foreign or loose material and maintained in
 such condition in advance of the placement operations.
 Failures in existing pavement or base shall be corrected, as noted in Item 410.03(c)2, in
 advance of the placement of an overlying layer.
 A prime coat, when required, shall be placed in accordance with Section 401. Tack coat
 shall be placed in accordance with Section 405.
 2. Patching.
 When patching of an existing surface is provided by the plans, the Engineer will examine
 the pavement surface and designate the area to be patched. The designated areas shall be
 trimmed to the depth of the unstable material as directed. The loose faulty material shall be
 picked up and removed from the area. The newly exposed patch area shall be cleaned and
 treated with prime or tack material as directed before placement of patching material. The
 hot and/or warm mix asphalt patching material shall be placed and compacted by methods
 approved by the Engineer until the patch area is filled to the elevation of the surrounding
 surface. Compaction of the patching material shall be to the degree that further
 consolidation of the patching material is not anticipated and is acceptable to the Engineer.
 3. Leveling.
 When leveling of an existing pavement or base is provided by the plans, the surface shall
 be brought to required grade and cross section with plant mix material. The surface to be
 treated shall be prepared as noted herein and approved before placing the new material. The
 plant mix material shall be spread in accordance with the provisions of Item 410.03(f)2.
 Leveling shall include superelevating when so directed. 
 4. Widening.
 When widening is provided by the plans, the widening shall be placed at the locations
 designated by the plans and/or as directed by the Engineer. The requirements for placing the
 widening shall be the same, as far as practical, as for the placing of the normal roadway.
 Compaction of the widening material shall be to the degree that further consolidation of the
 widening material is not anticipated and is acceptable to the Engineer.
 
 (d) Preparation of Mixtures.
 1. Liquid Asphalt Binder.
 The liquid asphalt binder material shall be heated in a manner that insures the even
 heating of the entire mass under efficient and positive control at all times. Any liquid asphalt
 binder material which, in the opinion of the Engineer, has been damaged shall be rejected.
 212
 
 SECTION 410
 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 2. Aggregate.
 a. Aggregate Used for Batch Mixing and Continuous Mixing Operations.
 All aggregates shall be dried so that the moisture content of the hot and warm mix
 asphalt at the point of sampling is less than 0.20 % by weight {mass} in accordance with
 ALDOT-130. The temperature of the aggregate at the dryer shall not exceed 600 ºF {315
 ºC}.
 When more than two ingredients enter into the composition of the mineral
 aggregate, they shall be combined as directed.
 The aggregate, immediately after being heated, shall be screened into three or
 more sizes and conveyed into separate bins, ready for batching and mixing with liquid
 asphalt binder material. However, for mixes using aggregate of 1/2 inch {12.5 mm}
 maximum size, the number of bins may be reduced to two.
 b. Aggregates for Dryer Drum Mixing Operations.
 Maintenance of a uniform aggregate gradation is essential for a dryer drum
 operation; hence, caution and care shall be exercised in stockpiling of materials to avoid
 segregation.
 3. Mixing.
 a. Mixing Temperature.
 The mixing temperature of HMA and WMA shall be in accordance with the refineries’
 recommendations, based upon the temperature-viscosity curve, and shall be adequate to
 produce a mixture in accordance with the specification requirements. The mixing
 temperature shall not exceed 350 F {177 C}.
 The mixing temperature for HMA and WMA shall be continuously recorded and
 delivered to the Engineer on the next working day.
 b. Batch Mixing.
 The dried mineral aggregate, and measured mineral filler when used, prepared as
 prescribed above, shall be combined in uniform batches by determining the weight
 {mass} of and conveying into the mixer the proportionate amounts of each aggregate
 required to meet the job mix formula. The largest size aggregate shall be introduced
 first, then smaller sizes progressively, with mineral filler last, or all mineral components
 may be added simultaneously. The mineral components shall be thoroughly mixed. The
 required quantity of liquid asphalt binder material for each batch shall be measured by
 weight {mass} using scales or a liquid asphalt binder material metering device attached
 to the liquid asphalt binder material bucket.
 After the mineral components have been mixed, the liquid asphalt binder material
 shall be added and the mixing continued for a period of at least 45 seconds, or longer if
 necessary to produce a homogeneous mixture. However, if a check by ASTM D 2489 (Ross
 Method) shows that 95% plus coating is obtained, a shorter mixing time will suffice. The
 Engineer may then give written permission for a change. Each batch must be kept
 separate throughout the weight {mass} determining and mixing operations.
 The mixture shall be uniform in composition, free from lumps or balls of material
 containing an excess quantity of asphalt, or from pockets deficient in asphalt.
 c. Continuous Mixing.
 Components shall be introduced and proportioned volumetrically by continuous
 methods utilizing equipment specified herein for continuous plants. Amounts of
 aggregate and liquid asphalt binder material entering the mixer, and the rate of travel
 through the mixer, shall be so coordinated that a uniform mixture of specified gradation
 and liquid asphalt binder content will be produced.
 d. Dryer-Drum Mixing.
 Components shall be proportioned by weight {mass} as noted herein in Item
 410.03(a)1 for this method of mixing. Amounts of aggregate and liquid asphalt binder
 material entering the mixer, and the rate of travel through the mixer, shall be so
 coordinated that a uniform mixture of specified gradation and liquid asphalt binder
 content will be produced. An anti-stripping agent may be required to insure adequate
 coating of the aggregates, if so directed by the Engineer.
 
 213
 
 SECTION 410
 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 4. Recycled Mixtures.
 a. New Aggregate Temperature.
 The new aggregate shall be super-heated to a temperature such that, when
 combined with the reclaimed material, the specified discharge temperature is produced;
 however, in no case shall the temperature of the new aggregate exceed 600 F {315 C}.
 b. Mixing.
 The plant shall be designed and operated so that heat transfer will take place in the
 mixing unit without damage to, or vaporization of, the liquid asphalt binder material.
 For batch type plants, a minimum dry mixing cycle of 15 seconds shall be required for
 the new aggregate and reclaimed material before introduction of the new liquid asphalt
 binder material. All environmental regulations shall be met as required by Article
 107.22.
 
 (e) Transporting the Mixture.
 The mixture shall be transported in haul trucks meeting the requirements of Item 410.03(a)3.
 The equipment shall be in sufficient numbers to deliver the material to the roadbed without delay
 in the quantity required. Loads shall not be delivered too late in the day to be spread, compacted,
 and finished during daylight hours, unless nighttime work is allowed as shown on the plans or
 directed by the Engineer. Loads shall not be delivered at a temperature greater than 350 F
 {177 C} , or less than 220 °F {105 °C} without written permission of the State Materials and Tests
 Engineer.
 
 (f) Placing the Mixture.
 1. Rate of Placement.
 The placement rate of plant mix will be specified by the plans; however, this rate may
 require correction to adjust for the compacted mix unit weight {density} as determined in the
 job mix formula design as outlined in Subarticle 410.02(b). The Engineer may direct in writing
 that the designated weight {mass} be increased or decreased in certain areas. It shall be the
 Contractor's responsibility to place and spread the material uniformly and compact it to such
 a thickness that will produce the specified rate, separately for each layer of base, binder,
 and surface, and to maintain a continuing check on tonnage {mass} and yardage {area}
 throughout the day's operation to insure uniform specified rate.
 The unit for checking the average rate shall be approximately 5000 square yards
 {5000 m2} to the nearest even truck load. If the last check performed in any day or any
 section of roadway is between 2000 and 5000 square yards {2000 and 5000 m 2}, this section
 shall be classified as a unit; if less than 2000 square yards {2000 m 2}, this section shall be
 added to the previous unit and the revised unit rechecked. When the initial day's operation is
 less than 2000 square yards {2000 m2}, this initial section will be carried over to subsequent
 days' operations to make a unit of approximately 5000 square yards {5000 m2}.
 In any unit checked, the average rate shall not vary from the specified rate by more than
 10 pounds per square yard {5 kg/m2} for layers of 225 pounds per square yard {120 kg/m 2} or
 less, and 15 pounds per square yard {8 kg/m2} for layers greater than 225 pounds per square
 yard {120 kg/m2}. On the first applied layer of resurfacing where there is no required milling
 or leveling, this tolerance is increased to 15 pounds per square yard {8 kg/m 2} for layers of
 225 pounds per square yard {120kg/m2} or less, and 25 pounds per square yard {13 kg/m 2} for
 layers greater than 225 pounds per square yard {120 kg/m2}. This tolerance is for providing
 leeway in equipment adjustment only. A consistent and uncorrected variation from the
 specified rate, even within this tolerance, will not be allowed without the Engineer's written
 approval. This tolerance does not apply to patching, leveling, and widening.
 If the average rate of any unit is found deficient by more than the above referenced
 tolerance, the Engineer will determine (1) whether the Contractor shall remove and replace
 the deficient unit without payment for the removal or the material removed, or (2) whether
 the Contractor may leave the deficient unit in place and cover it with a layer of the same mix
 of adjusted maximum size aggregate of not less than 80 pounds per square yard {45 kg/m 2}
 average. In case (2), the surface layer shall not be feather-edged at the end of the overlay
 layer, but a sufficient amount of the surface beyond the ends of the deficient unit shall be
 removed, to a neat line across the pavement, to allow placing the full 80 pounds per square
 yard {45 kg/m2} and to make a joint that will meet the surface requirements. There will be
 214
 
 SECTION 410
 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 no payment for any portion of the overlay needed to bring the total up to the designated
 average rate for that unit.
 If the average rate of any unit is found to exceed the above referenced tolerance, the
 tonnage {metric tonnage} in the unit that is in excess of the specified rate will be paid for as
 specified in Subarticle 410.09(a).
 Unless otherwise provided in the following sections of these specifications, or shown on
 the plans, the average rate placed and compacted in one layer shall not exceed 350 pounds
 per square yard {200 kg/m2} for base or binder layers, and 225 pounds per square yard {120
 kg/m2} for surface layers. Where the amount to be placed exceeds these limits, it shall be
 placed and compacted in two or more approximately equal layers or as shown on the plans.
 2. Spreading.
 a. General.
 Spreading of the hot and warm mix asphalt mixture shall be performed by
 equipment meeting the requirements of Item 410.03(a)4, except as noted in this Item.
 Approved specialized equipment may be employed to spread the hot and warm mix
 asphalt material where standard full scale equipment is impractical due to size and
 irregularity of the area to be paved.
 Spreading operations shall be correlated with plant operations and hauling
 equipment such that the spreading operation, once begun, shall proceed at a speed as
 uniform and continuous as practical. The continual forward movement of the spreader
 requires the use of hauling vehicles capable of supplying the spreader with hot and warm
 mix asphalt material while the spreader is in motion. Repetitive interruptions or stopping
 of the spreader shall be cause for the Engineer to suspend the work until the Contractor
 evaluates the cause of the stoppage and has provided a definite action plan for
 correction of the interruptions. Any interruption will require the thorough check of the
 area immediately under the spreader and any variances shall be corrected immediately
 or the material removed and replaced, as directed, without additional compensation.
 Material placed in the spreader shall be immediately spread and screeded to a
 uniform depth so that the specified rate of the mixture required is achieved. Alignment
 of the outside edges of the pavement shall be controlled by preset control lines, and
 shall be finished in conformity with these controls.
 Any spreading operation, which cannot produce acceptable joints within the surface
 tolerances and density requirements, shall be cause for requiring the Contractor to
 modify his operations to include additional spreading equipment.
 b. Spreading by Motor Grader.
 For areas of a hot and warm mix asphalt plant mix surface inaccessible to the
 mechanical spreader, patching of pot holes and correcting failures in existing pavement,
 the plant mix may be dumped in low areas in the amounts directed, windrowed, spread,
 and compacted to bring the elevation and section to the desired level.
 If shown on the plans, the Contractor shall use a motor grader or a motor grader
 equipped with a dragbox to perform the spreading for the leveling operation. The motor
 grader shall be equipped with smooth faced tires. The dragbox, when required, shall be
 of sufficient size and weight {mass} to effectively shape and level the plant mix and shall
 be approved by the Engineer prior to use.
 c. Spreading by Hand.
 For areas inaccessible to mechanical spreading equipment, and when patching
 potholes and minor pavement failures, hand spreading of the hot and warm mix asphalt
 mixture may be permitted. The mixture shall be distributed immediately into place by
 means of suitable tools and spread in a uniformly loose layer.
 
 (g) Compacting.
 As soon as the mixture has been spread and has set sufficiently to prevent undue cracking or
 shoving, rolling shall begin. A delay in the initial rolling will not be tolerated and the initial or
 breakdown rolling should in general be performed by rolling longitudinally, beginning at the sides
 and proceeding toward the center of the surface.
 When initially constructing any leveling layers, the Contractor, as part of his QC plan, shall
 establish a rolling pattern using the nondestructive testing devices approved in Section 306 of the
 Specifications. The device shall either be calibrated to roadway cores or gage counts and shall be
 215
 
 SECTION 410
 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 used to determine the rolling pattern producing maximum density. Contractor QC personnel shall
 be on site throughout each day to perform periodic checks and verify that the rolling pattern
 continually produces the maximum density that is achievable.
 When paving abuts a previously placed lane, the longitudinal joint shall be rolled in the first
 pass. On superelevated curves rolling shall begin at the low side and progress toward the high
 side.
 If any displacement occurs during rolling, it shall be corrected at once. To prevent adhesion
 of surface mixture to the rollers, the wheels shall be kept adequately moistened with water and a
 non-foaming detergent, but an excess of water will not be permitted.
 Adequate precaution shall be taken to prevent dropping of gasoline or oil on the pavement. In
 places inaccessible to a roller, compaction shall be obtained with hand or mechanical tampers
 that produce adequate pressure to obtain the required density.
 When the roller is in contact with a bridge deck, vibratory mode shall be turned off and the
 roller shall operate in static mode only.
 Throughout the process of compacting, tests for surface smoothness as required by Article
 410.05 and density as required by Section 306 shall be made continuously.
 
 (h) Joints.
 1. General.
 Placing of hot and warm mix asphalt paving layers shall be as continuous as possible. All
 joints shall be constructed in such a way as to provide a smooth, well–bonded, and sealed
 joint meeting the density and surface requirements of Articles 410.04 and 410.05. Failure to
 meet requirements noted above shall be cause for ordering the removal and reconstruction of
 the joint without additional compensation.
 The contact surface of concrete structures shall be treated with a thin coat of liquid
 asphalt binder material, tack material, or the liquid asphalt binder material used in the mix,
 prior to construction of the joint. When directed by the Engineer, the same treatment noted
 above shall be used on cold asphalt joints.
 2. Longitudinal.
 Longitudinal joints in the wearing surface shall conform with the edges of proposed
 traffic lanes, insofar as practical. Any necessary longitudinal joints in underlying layers shall
 be offset so as to be at least 6 inches {150 mm} from the joint in the next overlying layer.
 3. Transverse.
 Transverse joints shall be carefully constructed. Rollers shall not pass over the
 unprotected edge of the freshly laid mixture unless laying operations are to be discontinued.
 To facilitate the expeditious removal of the plant mix joint when laying operations are
 resumed, the Contractor shall place a heavy wrapping paper on the underlying surface across
 the joint and place plant mix on top of the paper.
 Upon resumption of the work, a neat vertical joint shall be formed into the previously
 laid material to expose the full depth of the layer. The fresh mixture shall be raked and
 tamped to provide a well-bonded and sealed joint meeting surface and density requirements.
 
 410.04 Density Requirements.
 Density requirements shall be as specified in Table IV, Subarticle 410.08(e).
 
 410.05 Surface and Edge Requirements.
 (a) Surface Smoothness Requirements.
 1. General.
 Surface smoothness and roadway section will be checked by the use of string, Engineer's
 level, and straight edge.
 The Contractor shall furnish string, straightedges, and the necessary personnel to handle
 them under the supervision of the Engineer.
 Surface smoothness tests shall be made continuously during and immediately after
 rolling so that irregularities may be eliminated to the extent possible by rolling while the
 material is still workable; otherwise, deficiencies shall be corrected as provided in Article
 410.06.
 
 216
 
 SECTION 410
 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 2. Perpendicular to Centerline of Roadway.
 The finished surface of all base, binder, and wearing surface layers shall not vary more
 than 1/4 of an inch {6 mm} from a 10 foot {3.0 m} straightedge placed perpendicular (at a
 right angle) to the centerline of the roadway anywhere on the surface.
 Unless shown otherwise on the plans, the slope shall not vary by more than 0.20 % from
 the required slope in any 10 foot {3.0 m} distance over which the slope is measured without
 the Engineer's written approval. (If, for example, a 2.0 % slope is required, the measured
 slope shall not be greater than 2.2 % or less than 1.8 %.)
 3. Parallel to Centerline of Roadway.
 The surface shall not vary more than 1/4 of an inch {6 mm} from a 16 foot {4.8 m}
 straightedge placed parallel to the centerline anywhere on the surface. A 16 foot {4.8 m}
 rolling straightedge, equipped with marking capability, may be used in lieu of the fixed
 straightedge if approved by the Engineer.
 The finished surface shall not vary more than 3/8 of an inch {9 mm} in any 25 foot {8 m}
 section from a taut string applied parallel to the surface at the following locations: 1 foot
 {300 mm} inside of the edges of pavement, at the centerline, and at other points designated
 by the Engineer. The variance from the designated grade shall not increase or decrease by
 more than 1/2 of an inch {12 mm} in 100 feet {30 m}.
 
 (b) Edge Requirements.
 Unless shown otherwise on the plans, surface, binder, and leveling pavement edges not
 confined by curbing or other structures may be lightly tamped behind the placement operation as
 a preventative measure against cracking and bulging during the rolling process. This procedure
 shall also be required on the initial edge of a longitudinal cold joint. These edges shall be neatly
 shaped to line behind the breakdown roller and shall be trimmed as necessary after final rolling,
 to an accurately lined string or wire providing a maximum tolerance of 2 inches {50 mm} outside
 the theoretical edge of pavement, with a maximum variation from a true line of 1/2 of an inch {12
 mm} in 10 feet {3 m} and a slope not flatter than 1:1. Edges that are distorted by rolling shall be
 corrected promptly.
 
 (c) Smoothness Requirements.
 The smoothness requirements and testing covered in this Subarticle shall apply for pay factor
 adjustments as indicated in the table below only if Item 410-I Smoothness Testing – Certified
 Inertial Profiler is included on the plans or in the proposal.
 1. Testing Device.
 a. Description.
 The testing device shall be an inertial profiler that satisfies the requirements of
 ALDOT-448, “Evaluating Pavement Profiles,” including the portable storage device(s)
 referenced herein. Portable storage devices containing profile measurements shall
 become the property of the Department at the time the measurements are taken.
 b. Equipment Requirements.
 The inertial profiler shall be a certified, non-contact, laser-based device capable of
 simultaneously measuring both wheelpaths meeting all the requirements of ALDOT-448.
 Portable storage device(s) for the inertial profiler shall be furnished in sufficient
 quantities for all calibration, test runs, and actual tests deemed necessary by the
 Engineer. Unless approved in advance by the Engineer, all portable storage devices
 provided by the Contractor will take the form of commonly available 2G USB flash drives.
 2. Testing Procedure.
 a. Description.
 The testing device shall be an inertial profiler that satisfies the requirements of
 ALDOT-448, “Evaluating Pavement Profiles,” including the portable storage device(s)
 referenced herein. Portable storage devices containing profile measurements shall
 become the property of the Department at the time the measurements are taken.

 Smoothness testing shall be performed and reported daily until the contractor
 demonstrates the ability to achieve a Mean Roughness Index (MRI) value of less than 65
 in/mile. If the Contractor demonstrates the ability to achieve a MRI value of less than 65
 in/mile then the Contractor may elect to perform and report the smoothness testing at a
 frequency he determines but not to exceed 5 working days production.
 b. Smoothness Requirements.
 The results of the inertial profiler tests shall be evaluated by Department personnel
 as outlined in ALDOT-448.
 If a Mean Roughness Index (MRI) value of 120 inches per mile {2.0 m/km} is
 exceeded in any test section of any daily paving operation, the paving operation will be
 suspended as soon as possible after results of the unacceptable test section are
 obtained. The paving will not be allowed to resume until corrective action is taken by
 the Contractor.
 When the MRI is more than 65 inches per mile {1.0 m/km}, per section, a unit price
 reduction will be assessed. When the MRI is less than 40 inches per mile {0.6 m/km} per
 section, a unit price increase will be added. The price adjustments are given in Table 1.

 For Pay Item 410-I, any price adjustment for smoothness considerations will be
 applied to the theoretical tonnage {metric tonnage}, calculated using the plan specified
 rate of placement, placed in those sections testing under 40 in/mile, or more than 65
 inches/mile {0.6 m/km, or more than 1.0 m/km} per section.
 
 410.06 Correction of Deficiencies and Defects.
 Deficiencies in surface smoothness as determined in Subarticle 410.05(a) shall be remedied to the
 extent practicable by rolling while the material is still workable. Otherwise the layer shall be removed
 and replaced as necessary to obtain required smoothness. "Skin patching" of a surface layer to correct
 low areas or heating and scraping to correct high areas will not be permitted. Overlays of not less than
 80 pounds per square yard {45 kg/m2} may be authorized by the Engineer for surface smoothness
 deficiencies provided all material in the overlay is without additional cost to the Department.
 Deficiencies in thickness shall be remedied as specified in Item 410.03(f)1.
 All areas containing excessive or deficient amounts of liquid asphalt binder, all areas showing
 unacceptable segregation of materials, and all areas unbonded after rolling shall be removed and
 replaced at no cost to the Department. Unacceptable segregation of a hot and warm mix asphalt mat is
 defined as any area in which two six inch {150 mm} cores are taken and the average percent liquid
 asphalt binder content of the cores have an absolute difference greater than 0.50 percentage points of
 the design liquid asphalt binder content, or the combined gradation analysis of the two cores on
 218
 
 SECTION 410
 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 selected sieves has anabsolute difference greater than 10 percentage points from the job mix
 formula. All testing shall be in accordance with ALDOT-389, "Evaluation of Segregated Areas in Hot Mix
 Asphalt Pavement." The location of all cores taken for segregation evaluation will be determined by the
 Department. All coring and traffic control required by ALDOT-389 shall be conducted/supplied by the
 Contractor at no cost to the Department; however, the Contractor will be reimbursed $500.00 per core
 when core results are within tolerances and the coring operations require additional traffic control.
 At any time that segregation is determined to be unacceptable, work shall be automatically
 suspended if positive corrective action is not taken by the Contractor to prevent further segregation in
 the mat. Upon suspension, the Contractor shall place a test section not to exceed 500 tons {500 metric
 tons} of the affected mixture for evaluation by the Engineer. However, if after a few loads it is
 apparent that the corrective actions were not adequate, work shall again be suspended and the
 segregated areas evaluated in accordance with ALDOT-389. Likewise, if after 500 tons {500 metric tons}
 it is apparent that the problem has been solved, work will be allowed to continue.
 When correcting subsurface mixtures (base and binder layers), the removal and replacement may
 be limited to the actual defective areas or the full mat width within the limits of individual defective
 areas as directed by the Engineer. Removal and replacement of hot and warm mix asphalt wearing
 surface layers shall be a minimum of the full mat width and 10 feet {3 m} in length. All surface
 tolerance requirements shall apply to the corrected areas for both subsurface and surface mixes.
 Areas found deficient in density shall be removed and replaced or immediately re-rolled until
 density is acceptable.
 All work specified in this Article shall be performed without additional compensation.
 
 410.07 Maintenance and Protection.
 Sections of newly finished work shall be protected from all traffic until properly hardened.
 Maintenance shall include immediate repairs of any defects that may occur on the work; such repairs
 shall be repeated as often as necessary to maintain the work in a continuously satisfactory condition.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for the protection of the work and protection of any traffic using
 the work. No additional compensation will be paid for maintenance and protection.
 
 410.08 Method of Measurement.
 (a) General.
 The accepted quantity of hot and warm mix asphalt plant mix used as directed will be
 measured in tons of 2000 pounds {metric tons} in accordance with the following:
 When the laboratory compacted density as determined in the job mix formula design exceeds
 158 pounds per cubic foot {2530 kg/m3}, the actual total tonnage {metric tonnage} of mix placed
 will be adjusted for pay purposes in accordance with the following formula (this shall not apply to
 Section 327 PATB and Section 420 OGFC):
 y = 158 c / a { y = 2530 c / a}, where
 y = total tonnage {metric tonnage} of plant mix for pay purposes;
 c = actual tonnage {metric tonnage} of plant mix measured and placed, except items
 subject to pay factor adjustment under the QC/QA provisions. On items subject to pay
 factor adjustment, the adjusted tonnage {metric tonnage} (after pay factor adjustment)
 will be used;
 a = laboratory compacted mix unit weight in pounds per cubic foot {density in kilograms
 per cubic meter} as shown in the job mix formula.
 No adjustments to the actual total tonnage {metric tonnage} placed will be made where the
 laboratory compacted mix density is below 158 pounds per cubic foot {2530 kg/m 3}.
 No adjustments to the actual tonnage {metric tonnage} placed will be made when the use of
 lightweight aggregate (expanded clay or shale) is designated.
 For determining weight {mass}, each load of hot and warm mix asphalt mixture shall have its
 weight {mass} determined on approved certified scales, as specified in Article 109.01, furnished by
 the Contractor without direct compensation.
 The weight {mass} measurement shall include all components of the mixture. No deductions
 will be made for any of the components, including the liquid asphalt binder material, contained in
 the mixture.
 The laboratory compacted density requirements for OGFC are given in Section 420. Section
 327 PATB does not have a laboratory compacted density requirement because a layer thickness
 (typically 4 inches {100 mm}) is required instead of a rate of placement.
 219
 
 SECTION 410
 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 
 (b) Acceptance of the Mixture.
 The hot and warm mix asphalt mixture will be evaluated at the planton a LOT to LOT basis.
 The material will be tested for acceptance in accordance with the provisions of Section 106 and
 the following requirements. However, any load or loads of mixture, which, in the opinion of the
 Engineer, are obviously unacceptable, will be rejected for use in the work.
 The Contractor shall control all operations in the handling, preparation, and mixing of the hot
 and warm mix asphalt plant mix so that the percent liquid asphalt binder and voids in laboratory
 compacted samples or gradation will meet the approved job mix formula within the tolerances
 shown in Tables II, III, and VI for the 1.00 pay factor. In recognition of the fact that the drying
 and screening operations may generate additional dust over that shown in the approved mix
 design, the Contractor's attention is directed to the fact that the dust must be controlled in order
 to control VMA and voids in the total mix.
 Acceptance of the mixture will be in accordance with Subarticle 106.09(c).
 LOT pay factors for asphalt content and air voids will be determined from Table II for Section
 423 mixes and from Table III for a Section 424 mix after the requirements of Item 106.09(c)3 are
 satisfied. LOT pay factors for asphalt content will be determined from the top half of Table II for
 Section 327 and 420 mixes after the requirements of Item 106.09(c)3 are satisfied. Air voids are
 not a pay factor for Section 327 and 420 mixes. Gradation is shown as a pay factor for Section 420
 mixes in Table VI. The pay factor values determined for each sieve noted in Table VI will be
 averaged. This average will then be compared to the asphalt content pay factor. The lowest of
 these two pay factors will be applied to the mix.
 Calculations for the acceptance test results for asphalt content and voids in total mix shall be
 carried to the thousandths (0.001) and rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.01). Calculations for
 averages shall be carried to the thousandths (0.001) and rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.01)
 in accordance with ASTM E 29 rules of rounding. LOT pay factors will be calculated to the nearest
 hundredth (0.01).
 Payment for Section 327 and423 mixes will be on the basis of Table II Acceptance Schedule
 for Payment. Payment for a Section 424 mix will be on the basis of Table III Acceptance Schedule
 for Payment. Payment for Section 420 mixes will be on the basis of Table II and Table VI.
 
 (c) Suspension and Voluntary Termination of Lots.
 The production process will be considered out of control when any individual test result
 (asphalt content, gradation, or air voids) from a LOT has a pay factor equal to 0.80 computed from
 the "1 Test" row in Table II, the “1 Test” row in Table III, or the “1 Test” column in Table VI,
 whichever is appropriate. When gradation is a pay factor, a 0.80 result for an individual screen
 (before averaging) is considered out of control. If any single gradation for the 327 mixes falls
 outside of the gradation band shown in Section 327 the process is considered out of control. When
 this happens, production shall be suspended. If mix from the suspended LOT is contained in
 storage/surge bins, that mix will be considered part of the suspended LOT, and shall not be placed
 on any State project.
 When production is suspended as described above, or when the contractor voluntarily
 terminates a lot, production shall not be re-started until after all of the following has been
 accomplished:
 (1) the Contractor shall notify the Project Manager immediately that the process is out of
 control, or that the LOT has been terminated voluntarily, and that production has been
 suspended;
 (2) the Contractor shall determine the appropriate adjustments to make in order to bring the
 process under control and inform the Project Manager in writing of these adjustments;
 (3) after adjustments, the Contractor shall produce a trial batch of mix (approximately 25 to
 35 tons {25 to 35 metric tons}) and test for control characteristics (asphalt content,
 gradation, and air voids);
 (4) adjustments, trial batches, and tests shall be repeated as many times as necessary until
 pay factors forasphalt content, gradation, and air voids equal 1.00, minimum, at which
 time production may be re-started. Mix utilized as a trial batch shall not be used on the
 project.

 The comparison value for ALDOT and Contractor testing for the 3/8" {9.5 mm} and No. 8 {2.36 mm}
 sieves is +/- 2.0%.
 * If approved by the Department, the Contractor may accept the indicated LOT partial pay. The
 Department may require removal and replacement. If the LOT pay factor is greater than 0.80, the
 Contractor has the option to remove at no cost to the Department and to replace at contract unit
 bid price rather than accepting the reduced LOT payment.
 
 (e) Acceptance of the Roadway Density.
 For paving that is not mainline paving (paving for patching, widening, and crossovers and
 leveling), in-place density pay factors will not be applied. For mainline paving (including
 shoulders, ramps, and acceleration/deceleration lanes), in-place density pay factors will be
 applied as specified herein unless otherwise noted on the plans or in the specifications.
 After the hot and/or warm mix asphalt mixture has been placed and compacted, it shall be
 evaluated for density. A core for mat density determination shall be taken by the Contractor on
 each 3000 foot {900 m} segment of roadway lane of asphalt mixture placed. The location of each
 test will be designated by the Department. The core shall meet a minimum thickness for use in
 determining the roadway density. If the core’s average thickness in inches {millimeters} is not at
 least 0.008 times the rate in pounds per square yard {0.375 times the rate in kilograms per square
 meter}, another core shall be taken (as close a practical to the original location) where the
 Engineer believes the pavement is thick enough for roadway density determination. The core’s
 average thickness shall be determined by measuring the core’s thickness at six equidistant
 locations around the circumference of the core. The Department will take immediate possession
 of the core and will make a density determination of the core in accordance with AASHTO T 166,
 Method A. The density values of the cores will be used to compute the pay factor for that sublot.
 Testing locations will be selected with the random number method outlined in ALDOT-210.
 Contractors are allowed, but not required, to take cores anywhere, anytime for quality control.
 This includes taking cores from the wearing layer. The contractor must have the permission of the
 Engineer to take cores from a PATB (327) or OGFC (420) mix. All core holes shall be promptly
 repaired at the contractor’s expense. For purposes of evaluation, a LOT will be as defined in Item
 106.09(c)1. A SUBLOT for evaluation of density will be equal to 12,000 feet {3600 m} (4 test
 results) or fraction of a 12,000 foot {3600 m} length as applicable. For instance, a 27,000 foot
 {8100 m} LOT would be divided into two 12,000 foot {3600 m} SUBLOTS and one 3000 foot {900 m}
 SUBLOT.
 The in-place density will be expressed as a percentage of the theoretical maximum density
 (TMD) of the mix with the following relationship:
 222
 
 SECTION 410
 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 
 In Place Density
 Maximum Mix Density
 
 % TMD =
 
 X 100
 
 Maximum mix density is equated to maximum mix specific gravity as measured with AASHTO T
 209, Flask determination with dry back. The maximum mix specific gravity used will be the
 average of the values from the four most recent determinations using Contractor data.
 The appropriate pay factor for each SUBLOT will be determined from Table IV for the
 appropriate number of test results. The pay factor for the LOT will be determined by computing
 the weighted average of the SUBLOTS:
 LOT Pay Factor (PF) =
 
 PF SUBLOT 1 (Length SUBLOT 1) + PF SUBLOT 2 (Length SUBLOT 2) + …
 Length SUBLOT 1 + Length SUBLOT 2 + …
 
 Calculations for the acceptance test results for in-place density will be carried to the
 hundredths (0.01) and rounded to the nearest tenth (0.1). LOT and SUBLOT pay factor
 calculations will be carried to the thousandths (0.001) and rounded to the nearest hundredth
 (0.01) in accordance with ASTM E 29 rules of rounding.
 The low rates of placement at which minimum density does not apply are given in Section
 306. Density pay factors will not be applied to pavement layers placed at these rates.

 approved by the Area Materials Engineer prior to beginning any concrete placement.
 9. Probing Method for Determining Concrete Pavement Thickness.
 The Engineer will select using ALDOT-210 a minimum of two longitudinal locations within
 the pavement testing unit to be measured. The Engineer will then select using ALDOT-210
 two transverse locations within the width of the pavement at each of the longitudinal
 locations selected. The Contractor shall use a probing device to determine the concrete
 thickness of the freshly placed concrete at each of the locations selected. The thickness
 measurements shall be recorded to the nearest ⅛ of an inch. The two measurements at each
 longitudinal location constitute one set. The Contractor shall submit the record of all reading
 as well as the exact location, including the station number and offset, of each reading to the
 Engineer by the end of the day. The average of all the measurements within a pavement
 testing unit will be used by the Engineer to determine the thickness of the pavement testing
 unit.
 10. Verification of Contractor’s Determination of Concrete Pavement Thickness.
 The Department will use the Magnetic Imaging Technology (MIT) Scan-T2 to verify the
 Contractor’s measurements of the concrete pavement thickness.
 The engineer will set targets within one foot from the location of the Contractor’s
 measurements. The Engineer will take two readings at each target location. The average of
 all the MIT Scan-T2 readings within a pavement testing unit will be used by the Engineer to
 verify the thickness of the pavement testing unit. The Engineer will record the station
 number and offset of the location the thickness measurements are taken.
 If the Contractor’s average thickness of the pavement testing unit varies from the
 verification thickness done by the Department by ± 0.10 inches, a referee core sampled in
 accordance with AASHTO T 24 will be extracted at a location selected using ALDOT-210 from
 all the measured points. The core will be measured by the Department for thickness in
 248
 
 SECTION 450
 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 accordance to AASHTO T 148. If the referee core thickness agrees with the Department’s
 verification result, the Contractor will bear the cost of coring and repairing of the core hole.
 If the referee core thickness agrees with the Contractor’s result, the Department will bear
 the cost of coring and repairing of the core hole. All voids resulting from coring operations
 shall be filled and consolidated with the same concrete mixture used during paving. Voids
 shall be filled on the same day that the cores are extracted using the same concrete mixture
 used for paving.

 The slip form method shall be used when the total amount of concrete pavement
 required to be placed is greater than 10,000 square yards. The slip form method may be used
 instead of fixed forms when the total amount of concrete pavement required to be placed is
 less than 10,000 square yards.
 2. Slip Form Paver.
 The slip form paver shall be designed to spread, consolidate, screed, and float-finish the
 freshly placed concrete in one complete pass of the paver. Concrete shall be placed so that
 only minor hand finishing will be necessary to provide a dense and homogeneous concrete
 pavement.
 The paver shall vibrate the concrete for the full width and depth of the strip of
 pavement being placed. The vibration shall be accomplished with the required vibration
 equipment.
 The sliding forms shall be rigidly held together, laterally to prevent spreading of the
 forms, and shall trail behind the paver for such a distance that no appreciable slumping of
 the concrete will occur.
 The paver shall be operated with a continuous forward movement. All operations of
 mixing, delivery, and spreading concrete shall be coordinated as to provide uniform progress
 with stopping and starting of the paver held to a minimum. If, for any reason, it is necessary

 avoid damage to the pavement. After the forms have been removed, the ends of all joints shall be
 cleaned, after which the sides of the slab shall be covered with earth or other approved curing
 agent.
 As soon as the side forms have been removed, any defective work shall be removed and
 replaced in accordance with the details shown on the plans. Any area or section so removed shall
 be not less than 10 feet in length and not less than the full width of the lane involved. If the area
 to be removed extends to a point less than 10 feet {3 m} from a joint, it shall be extended on to
 the joint.
 
 (p) Reinforced Bridge End Slabs.
 Special pavement slabs, reinforced as shown on the plans, shall be constructed adjacent to
 bridges using concrete of the same type and proportions that are in the adjoining concrete
 pavement. No direct payment will be made for reinforcing steel used in the bridge end slabs.
 The end slabs shall be constructed in the same manner required for the construction of
 concrete pavement. Where the bridge end slab will be covered with a bituminous overlay, the
 final screeding of the surface of the concrete shall be done by any means that will leave a slightly
 roughened surface. Where the bridge end slab will not have a bituminous overlay, the final
 screeding of the surface of the concrete shall be done with a mechanical longitudinal screed and
 the hardened surface of the concrete shall be machine grooved in accordance with the
 requirements given for grooving the surface of concrete bridge decks.
 
 (q) Protection of Pavement.
 The Contractor shall protect the pavement and its appurtenances against both public traffic
 and traffic caused by his own employees and agents. Any material deposited on the pavement
 considered detrimental to the surface shall be removed immediately. This requirement shall
 include erection and maintenance of warning signs, lights, watchmen to direct traffic, pavement
 bridges, or crossovers, etc., as needed or directed by the Engineer.
 
 (r) Opening Pavement to Traffic.
 The Contractor shall protect the concrete pavement from vehicular traffic during the curing
 period. Completed portions of the concrete pavement may be opened tolight construction traffic
 only (small pick-up trucks with four wheels and cars) when the compressive strength of the
 concrete pavement reaches 3000 psi but not earlier than 72 hours. Traffic shall not be parked on
 the pavement during the curing period and any curing compound and/or moisture removed by the
 traffic tires shall be replaced immediately.
 The Contractor may utilize "Maturity Meter" measurements for the determination of the
 compressive strength of the concrete. The compressive strength required for opening the
 pavement to traffic shall be determined by tests of standard concrete cylinders cured under the
 same climatic and moisture conditions as the slab unless maturity meters are used.
 The pavement may be opened to unrestricted traffic after 7 days if the 28-day compressive
 strength has been achieved and the Engineer has accepted the pavement without restriction.
 If the ambient temperature drops below 40 ºF, the period of time that the temperature is
 below 40 ºF will be added to the minimum time to opening. Any part of the pavement damaged
 by traffic or other causes prior to its final acceptance shall be repaired or replaced at no
 additional cost to the Department in a manner acceptable to the Engineer.

 450.04 Smoothness Requirements.
 (a) Testing Device.
 1. Description.
 The testing device shall be an inertial profiler that satisfies the requirements of ALDOT448, “Evaluating Pavement Profiles,” including the portable storage device(s) referenced
 herein. Portable storage devices containing profile measurements shall become the property
 of the Department at the time the measurements are taken.
 b. Equipment Requirements.
 The inertial profiler shall be a certified, non-contact, laser-based device capable of
 simultaneously measuring both wheelpaths meeting all the requirements of ALDOT-448.
 Portable storage device(s) for the inertial profiler shall be furnished in sufficient
 quantities for all calibration, test runs, and actual tests deemed necessary by the Engineer.
 Unless approved in advance by the Engineer, all portable storage devices provided by the
 Contractor will take the form of commonly available 2G USB flash drives.
 
 (b) Testing Procedure.
 1. Description.
 Smoothness testing shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements given in
 ALDOT 448. The Contractor shall furnish the necessary certified personnel to operate the
 inertial profiler.
 The smoothness test shall be performed as soon as practical after the pavement hardens
 sufficiently to prevent damage to the surface finish but no later than the next work day after
 placement of the concrete, unless otherwise authorized by the Engineer.
 The smoothness test is considered a part of the paving operation and will be performed
 immediately in the proper sequence, in a satisfactory manner, even to the exclusion of other
 work.
 Smoothness testing shall be performed and reported daily until the contractor
 demonstrates the ability to achieve a Mean Roughness Index (MRI) value of less than 65
 in/mile. If the Contractor demonstrates the ability to achieve a MRI value of less than 65 in/mile
 then the Contractor may elect to perform and report the smoothness testing at a frequency he
 determines but not to exceed 5 working days production.
 2. Smoothness Requirements.
 The results of the inertial profiler tests will be evaluated by Department personnel as
 outlined in ALDOT-448.
 If a Mean Roughness Index (MRI) value of 120 inches per mile {2.0 m/km} is exceeded in
 any test section of any daily paving operation, the paving operation will be suspended as soon
 as possible after results of the unacceptable test section are obtained. The paving will not be
 allowed to resume until corrective action is taken by the Contractor.
 The contractor will be allowed to diamond grind any test section whose Mean Roughness
 Index exceeds 65 inches per mile. All diamond grinding shall be performed with no additional
 compensation from the Department. Diamond grinding may be separate locations of grinding
 or continuous grinding within a test section. Diamond grinding at any location shall be for the
 full width of the pavement test section.
 If diamond grinding is performed the measurement of pavement thickness for acceptance
 and payment will be made after diamond grinding is completed. The determination of the
 pavement thickness will be by coring a location determined by the Engineer using ALDOT-210.
 The Contractor will be responsible for cost of coring and repairing the core hole. All voids
 resulting from coring operations shall be filled and consolidated with the same concrete
 mixture used during paving. Voids shall be filled on the same day that the cores are
 extracted using the same concrete mixture used for paving. Price adjustments will be made
 for smoothness after the diamond grinding is completed. All test sections of pavement where
 the Mean Roughness Index remains greater than 120 inches per mileshall be removed and
 replaced (in accordance with the details shown on the plans) by the Contractor without
 additional compensation.
 The price adjustments for smoothness are given in Subarticle 450.08(b).

 SECTION 450
 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 
 450.05 Tolerance in Pavement Thickness.
 Pavement (main roadway, shoulders, intersections, entrances, crossovers, ramps, etc.) thicknesses
 will be checked by the Department for compliance with required thickness by measuringthe length of
 cores or by the use of MIT Scan T2 device. Pavement with deficient thickness will be paid for on an
 adjusted unit price as described in Subarticle 450.08(b). Thickness measurements shall be made after
 all operations, if applicable, have been performed to improve smoothness.
 Pavement that is deficient from the required thickness by more than 0.75 inches shall be replaced
 in accordance with the details shown on the plans at no cost to the Department.
 
 450.06 Acceptance of Concrete Based on Compressive Strength.
 Concrete cylinders, 6 inches x 12 inches in size, will be made by the Department from randomly
 selected concrete batches in each pavement testing unit as designated by the Engineer.
 The compressive strength shall be the average of two cylinder test results. If the average
 compressive strength of the cylinders is equal to or greater than 100 % of the required 28-day
 compressive strength, the concrete will be accepted with no price reduction. If the average
 compressive strength of the cylinders is 85 % or greater but less than 100 % of the required 28-day
 compressive strength, a price adjustment will be applied to the applicable pay item for the increment
 of pavement represented by the low break. The formula for the determination of the price adjustment
 is given in Subarticle 450.08(b).
 If the average compressive strength of the cylinders is less than 85 % of the required strength, the
 concrete pavement shall be removed and replaced in accordance with the details shown on the plans
 without additional compensation.
 
 450.07 Method of Measurement.
 The amount of concrete pavement to be paid for under this section shall be the number of square
 yards {square meters} of pavement completed and accepted, measured in place and calculated to the
 nearest square yard {square meter}. The width will be the width of the pavement shown on the typical
 cross section of the plans plus additional widening where called for, or directed by the Engineer in
 writing. The width will be the outside to outside measurement of the pavement including any area
 covered by integral curb or concrete median strip. The length will be measured along the surface of
 the centerline.
 Reinforced concrete bridge end slabs will be measured in square yards {square meters} and will be
 paid for separately.
 The number of profilographs measured for payment will be the actual number of units ordered and
 accepted.
 
 450.08 Basis of Payment, Price Adjustments and Pavement Replacement.

 provided above, will be paid for at the contract unit price bid per square yard {square meter},
 which payment shall be full compensation for furnishing and placing all materials, including any
 reinforcing steel and supports, anchor concrete, sleeper slab concrete, structural steel (except
 bridge joint armor plates), dowels, and all other joint material, any additives, and for all
 materials, equipment, tools, labor, and incidentals required to complete the work (including the
 finishing, grooving, or tining of the surface).
 No additional payment over the contract unit bid price will be made for any pavement which
 has an average thickness in excess of that shown on the plans.
 Integral curb, measured as provided above, will be paid for at the contract unit price per
 linear foot {meter} which shall be payment in full for all materials and work required in
 completing the item.
 The ordered and accepted profilographs, measured as noted above, will be paid for at the
 contract unit price bid which shall be full compensation for furnishing the unit and includes all
 equipment, tools, labor, calibration, maintenance, services, supplies, chart paper, and incidentals
 necessary to complete these items of work.

 the various materials composing the grout. When volume is used, the weight per cubic foot
 {mass per cubic meter} of the materials will be determined and mix proportions adjusted
 accordingly.
 g. A batch type mixer, capable of thoroughly mixing the various components of the
 grout. A high speed, colloidal type mixer will be required for grout mixes containing only
 cement and fly ash.
 h. A positive action pump capable of forcing grout through a drilled hole into voids and
 cavities beneath the pavement slab. The pump shall be capable of supplying adequate
 pressure at the end of the discharge pipe to insure filling of all voids at the required hole
 spacing. A gage shall be located on the discharge side of the pump to measure the pumping
 pressure.
 i.
 A flow cone with all necessary components so that the Engineer may make an
 accurate field determination of the consistency of the grout. The flow cone shall conform to
 the dimensions and other requirements of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Test Method No.
 CRD-C79-58.
 
 (b) Jacking of Pavement Slabs.
 1. Weather Limitations.
 Unless approved otherwise by the Engineer in writing, all slabjacking shall be performed
 between the dates of April 1 and November 1.
 Slabjacking operations may not be started unless the air temperature, in the shade and
 away from artificial heat, is at least 35 °F {2 °C} and rising. Slabjacking shall stop if the
 temperature is 40 °F {4 °C} and falling or when the subgrade contains an abnormal amount of
 moisture as evidenced by standing water on the pavement or in joints or cracks.
 To accelerate setting and provide early strength to mixes utilizing Type I cement,
 calcium chloride shall be used in the proportions tabulated below for respective temperature
 ranges.

 2. Preparation of Grout Mixture.
 The mixtures used in slabjacking shall consist of the proportions tabulated in Table I.
 The consistency may be varied by the addition of water and/or other additives. The quantity
 by weight {mass} of equivalent 100 % pure calcium chloride to be included in the mixture
 shall be in accordance with Item 1 above. The calcium chloride, when required, shall be
 thoroughly pre-mixed in the approximate quantity of mixing water required for a
 pre-determined batch size before combining with the other ingredients. The consistency of
 the grout shall be determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Test Method No.
 CRD-C79-58. The quantity of mixing water used shall be that which will produce a grout of
 such consistency that the time of efflux from the flow cone will be a minimum of eighteen
 seconds and a maximum of twenty-five seconds for slabjacking. After the initial introduction
 of a sufficient amount of water into the mixture to obtain the necessary consistency, no
 additional water shall be added. The grout shall be used within one and one-half hours after
 introduction of water into the mixture.
 Dry ingredients may be added to a mixed batch only in the amounts necessary to bring a
 too thin mixture to the required consistency. In this case the added dry ingredients shall be in
 the specified ratio. Grout which fails to meet the flow requirements specified above shall not
 be used in jacking operations.
 A grout mixture shall be selected by the Contractor from the mixtures shown in Table I
 below. The Engineer reserves the right to specify a different mixture if the one chosen by the
 Contractor fails to produce the desired results.

 3. Construction.
 a. General.
 Except as specifically outlined in these specifications, the techniques involved in
 the slabjacking operation shall be the option of the Contractor as long as the desired
 results are achieved.
 Hole drilling patterns for pavement jacking shall be determined by the Contractor in
 the field based on conditions such as the size or length of the pavement area to be
 raised, the elevation difference, subgrade and drainage conditions, location of joints and
 cracks, and similar local circumstances. Extra holes may be required during the jacking
 process to apply additional pressure in a local area.
 Holes may be washed with water or blown with air to create a small hole from
 which the grout slurry can then spread. The injection holes shall be drilled through
 treated base so the base may be lifted with the pavement.
 Before slabjacking begins at a location, the Engineer will furnish the Contractor
 with the profile grade to be attained along with a nearby referenced point of elevation.
 
 262
 
 SECTION 452
 SLABJACKING OF PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 The Contractor shall pump in a pattern and in the amount required to raise the
 pavement to within 1/4 of an inch {6 mm} of the designated grade.
 b. Jacking.
 During the jacking operation, the discharge end of the grouting apparatus shall not
 extend below the lower surface of the concrete pavement. Continuous pressures up to
 200 psi {1.5 Mpa} will be permitted. Pressures to 300 psi {2.0 Mpa} will be allowed only
 for short periods. If the pavement is bonded to the subgrade, brief bursts of pressure to
 600 psi {4.0 Mpa} will be allowed.
 After slabjacking has been completed in a hole and the discharge pipe removed, the
 hole shall be plugged immediately with wooden plugs tapered to fit in the hole to retain
 the pressure of the grout and stop any waste or return flow of the mixture. When
 slabjacking to the desired elevation has been accomplished, the temporary plugs shall be
 removed and the hole filled with an approved stiff cement grout or concrete mixture.
 Unless approved otherwise by the Engineer, slabjacking operations shall cease as
 early as necessary to permit the grout to harden at least three hours prior to allowing
 traffic back on the grouted slab before first darkness.
 Lifting shall be done using sufficiently sized increments and change in injection
 locations to keep slab stresses to a minimum and to avoid cracking. Slabs which, in the
 opinion of the Engineer, have been damaged by the Contractor's operation or lack of
 control such that their repair or replacement is necessitated shall be repaired or
 removed and replaced at no cost to the Department.
 c. Overjacking.
 Any part of the pavement raised above the tolerances listed in Subitem
 452.03(b)3.a. above shall, if so directed by the Engineer, be brought to grade by
 grinding. Should the overjacking be greater than 0.1 foot {30 mm}, the Department at its
 option may require removal and replacement of the pavement without cost to the
 Department and to its satisfaction with regard to area involved, method and time of
 replacement, and materials involved.
 d. Radial Cracks.
 Cracks emanating radially from the grout injection holes will be presumed to have
 been caused by improper injection techniques by the Contractor. For each 5 feet {1.5 m}
 of such crack measured, the Contractor's pay quantity shall be reduced by 0.25 bag of
 cement.
 e. Unanticipated and Changed Conditions.
 Should the Engineer deem that continued grout injection at any specific location is
 no longer economically feasible, he may direct the Contractor to cease grout injection at
 that location. The Contractor will be paid at the unit bid price for the material used up
 to that point. The Engineer, at his discretion, may delete any location or may add a new
 location to be raised. Due to unknown conditions and the experimental nature of this
 type work, variations of any size in the plan quantity will not be considered cause for
 any increase or decrease in the unit contract bid price.
 
 452.04 Surface Requirements.
 After the slabjacking has been completed at a location, and before cleaning and sealing of cracks,
 the pavement surface shall be tested with a 15 foot {4.5 m} straightedge placed on the surface parallel
 to the centerline of the lane at points as directed across the width of the pavement and lapping 1/2
 the length of the straightedge progressing longitudinally along the pavement or with an approved
 rolling straightedge. The Contractor shall furnish the straightedge and personnel to operate it under
 the direction of the Engineer. Areas showing high spots of more than 1/4 of an inch {6 mm}, but less
 than 1/2 of an inch {13 mm}, under the 15 foot {4.5 m} straightedge shall be ground down with
 approved grinding equipment until the high spot is less than 1/4 of an inch {6 mm} high. If the area is
 more than 1/4 of an inch {6 mm} low or 1/2 of an inch {13 mm} high under the 15 foot {4.5 m}
 straightedge, the pavement in the affected area shall be repaired to the Engineer's satisfaction without
 additional compensation; such repair may require removal and replacement of the affected area. Any
 area so removed shall not be less than 8 feet {2.5 m} in length nor less than the full width of the lane
 involved. If the area to be removed extends to a point less than 8 feet {2.5 m} from a joint, it shall be
 extended to the joint.

 452.05 Opening To Traffic.
 Unless specifically authorized otherwise, no traffic, including construction equipment, will be
 permitted on the jacked slabs until at least three hours after the grouting has ceased. When Type III
 cement is used, traffic will be prohibited until initial set occurs. Initial set shall be defined as 800 psi
 {5.5 MPa} when tested in accordance with AASHTO T 197.
 Slabs that have been removed shall be replaced the same day they are removed. No traffic,
 including construction equipment, will be permitted on the replaced slab until at least six hours after
 the slab has been poured.
 Traffic shall be placed on grouted slabs before first darkness of the same day that the slabs were
 grouted; traffic shall be placed on replaced slabs no later than the morning following the day the slabs
 were replaced.
 
 452.06 Method of Measurement.
 Portland cement pressure grout for slabjacking will be measured for payment by the bag (94
 pounds {42 kg}) of Portland cement used in the grout; all other ingredients required in the grout will
 not be measured for payment.
 No other work under this Section will be measured for payment; this includes all hole drilling and
 any slab repair, removal, replacement, or grinding which may become necessary due to the slabjacking
 operation.
 
 452.07 Basis of Payment.
 (a) Unit Price Coverage.
 Portland cement pressure grout for slabjacking, measured as noted above, will be paid for at
 the contract unit price bid per bag of cement used in the grout. This price shall be full
 compensation for furnishing of the grout, including all ingredients for the type mix designated, for
 mixing, for pumping of the grout, for all holes drilled, for any and all slab repair, removal,
 replacement, or grinding, and all equipment, tools, labor, and incidentals necessary to complete
 this item of work.

 SECTION 453
 PRESSURE GROUTING AND REPAIR OF PORTLAND
 CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 453.01 Description.
 The work covered by this Section consists of the stabilization of existing unstable concrete
 pavement slabs by pressure pumping of a specified grout under the slabs along with the removal and
 replacement of designated shattered paving slabs or sections of slabs. The word slab in this Section
 shall mean not only a slab, or a portion of a slab, in a jointed concrete pavement system, but also a
 portion of a continuously reinforced concrete pavement.
 Pressure pumping of grout or subsealing of the pavement slabs is intended to stabilize the slab by
 filling voids and cavities under the slabs with a grout mixture that will form a hard insoluble mass.
 Removal and replacement of concrete pavement shall be as directed by the Engineer.
 Cracking in concrete pavement is defined as follows:
 Hairline cracks - Small, tight cracks which in width resemble shrinkage cracks. No corrective
 repair procedure is required.
 Low severity cracks - Wider than hairline cracks with the crack opening clearly visible. The
 concrete on both sides of the crack is acting with interlock between the cracked pieces
 limiting movement of the individual pieces.
 Medium severity cracks - The concrete on both sides of the crack is acting with partial
 interlock between the cracked pieces allowing potential or actual small movement of the
 individual pieces.
 High severity cracks - The concrete on both sides of the crack is acting independently
 allowing unrestricted movement of the individual pieces.

 If the crack does not have the same severity level along the entire length, the crack will be rated
 as the highest severity level present.
 Appropriate repair procedures for the various types of cracked slabs in a jointed pavement are as
 follows:
 Low severity cracking will not require the removal of pavement. These cracks will be routed
 and sealed under Item 454-A.
 Medium severity cracking will require the removal and replacement of at least a portion of
 the concrete slab. The entire slab is to be removed and replaced if broken into four or
 more pieces by at least medium severity cracks.
 High severity cracking will require the removal and replacement of at least a portion of the
 concrete slab. The entire slab is to be removed and replaced if it is broken into three or
 more pieces of high severity cracks.

 (b) Pressure Grouting of Pavement Slabs.
 1. Weather Limitations.
 Unless approved otherwise by the Engineer in writing, all pressure grouting shall be
 performed between the dates of April 1 and November 1.
 Pressure grouting operations may not be started unless the air temperature, in the shade
 and away from artificial heat, is at least 35 °F {2 °C} and rising. Pressure grouting shall stop if
 the temperature is 40 °F {4 °C} and falling or when the subgrade contains an abnormal
 amount of moisture as evidenced by standing water on the pavement or in joints or cracks.
 To accelerate setting and provide early strength to mixes utilizing Type I cement,
 calcium chloride shall be used in the proportions tabulated below for respective temperature
 ranges. Normal traffic flow may be resumed three hours after grouting.

 When Type III cement is used, 0-2% calcium chloride may be required as needed to
 accelerate setting in cold weather. Grouted slabs may be opened to traffic in accordance
 with Subarticle 453.03(d).
 2. Preparation of Grout Mixture.
 The mixtures used in pressure grouting shall consist of the proportions tabulated in Table
 I. The consistency may be varied by the addition of water and/or other additives. The
 quantity by weight {mass} of equivalent 100% pure calcium chloride to be included in the
 mixture shall be in accordance with Item 1 above. The calcium chloride, when required, shall
 be thoroughly pre-mixed in the approximate quantity of mixing water required for a
 predetermined batch size before combining with the other ingredients. The consistency of
 the grout shall be determined in accordance with ALDOT-338. The quantity of mixing water
 used shall be that which will produce a grout of such consistency that the time of efflux from
 the flow cone will be a minimum of 14 seconds and a maximum of 22 seconds for
 undersealing. After the initial introduction of a sufficient amount of water into the mixture to
 obtain the necessary consistency, no additional water shall be added. The grout shall be used
 within 90 minutes after introduction of water into the mixture.
 Dry ingredients may be added to a mixed batch only in the amounts necessary to bring a
 too thin mixture to the required consistency. In this case the added dry ingredients shall be in
 the specified ratio. Grout which fails to meet the flow requirements specified above shall not
 be used in grouting operations.
 A grout mixture shall be selected by the Contractor from the mixtures shown in Table I
 below. The Engineer reserves the right to specify a different mixture if the one chosen by the
 Contractor fails to produce the desired results.

 3. Construction.
 Selected slabs designated by the Department for pressure grouting shall be drilled as
 indicated on the plans or designated by the Engineer. For holes nearest the edges of the slab,
 the joints, or a major crack, a maximum of 3 inches {75 mm} from the precise marked
 location is considered to be reasonable. For other holes, a maximum 6 inch {150 mm}
 267
 
 SECTION 453
 PRESSURE GROUTING AND REPAIR OF PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 tolerance is considered to be reasonable. Should it become necessary or desirable to drill
 holes at locations other than those shown on the plans, such holes shall be drilled only as
 approved by the Engineer. In no instance shall holes be drilled in the wheel paths of a lane.
 The drills shall be rotated to avoid cracking the pavement and to provide satisfactory holes of
 the proper diameter for effective operations in pressure grouting. When drilling holes, the
 drills shall be held as nearly perpendicular to the pavement surface as possible. Holes which
 cannot be satisfactorily used in pressure grouting shall be filled with grout and not measured
 for pay; new holes shall be drilled.
 After the holes are drilled, and just prior to pressure grouting, a high pressure air pipe
 may be required to clean the hole, if deemed necessary by the Engineer, to facilitate
 introduction of the grout.
 After the holes are cleaned, the discharge hose on the pressure grout pump shall be
 connected to the hole in a manner that will provide adequate seal to maintain pressure past
 the connection. The discharge end of the pipe shall not extend below the lower surface of
 the concrete pavement.
 To fill all voids, pumping of grout will be required in holes designated by the Engineer.
 The maximum pressure allowed during the grouting operation will be 200 psi {1.5 Mpa}. A
 gage shall be located on the discharge side of the pump to measure the pumping pressure.
 Normally, indication that grout is flowing out of an adjacent hole or joint or the edge of the
 slab is sufficient evidence that all cavities or voids are filled within the range of the hole
 being grouted and pumping in such hole shall cease. Additional evidence that grouting should
 cease is a rapid rise of the slab, or indications of a rise of the adjacent shoulder. A minimal
 lifting of the slab will be allowed but not to exceed 0.05 of an inch {1 mm} per grouting pass.
 Care shall be taken not to crack slabs by differential lifting. Any slab or portion of slab or
 shoulder which is raised more than 0.05 of an inch {1 mm} each grouting will require
 corrective action, without payment, by the Contractor. Such corrective action shall consist of
 grinding or other methods approved by the Engineer.
 After grouting has been completed in a drill hole, the discharge pipe shall be withdrawn
 and latent grout removed. The hole shall not be plugged unless authorized otherwise by the
 Construction Engineer. Patching of the hole shall begin after the grout has taken an initial
 set. The grout shall be removed to a minimum depth of 4 inches {100 mm} below the
 pavement surface. A low slump concrete mix consisting of 1-part Type I or Type III cement
 and 2-parts No. 100 concrete sand by volume shall then be placed in the hole, rodded and
 leveled with the pavement surface. Filled holes that later shrink below the finished surface,
 ravel out, or otherwise become damaged before project completion shall be repaired.
 Corrective measures shall be taken in case stooling occurs by making proper adjustment
 in the stiffness of the grout being used. In case stooling does occur, additional holes shall be
 provided as directed and a more fluid grout shall be pumped through these new holes to fill
 the voids between the stools.
 At least 24 hours, but no later than 5 days, after a slab has been grouted, it shall be
 tested for movement between the hours of 3:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. On cool, cloudy days, this
 time frame may be extended if approved by the Engineer. The test rolling equipment shall be
 rubber-tired and of sufficient weight {mass} to give a 20,000 pounds {90 kN} single axle load
 with a minimum of 10,000 pounds {45 kN} per side (a properly loaded dump truck may be
 used).
 Each slab shall be tested by making one or more passes over it with the test roller. The
 rolling shall be slow enough to allow an observer to measure the movement and mark the slab
 if regrouting is needed. If the slab moves 0.03 of an inch {0.8 mm} or more during the test
 rolling, new holes shall be drilled and the slab regrouted. All slabs which have been regrouted
 shall be retested as outlined above for the initial testing.
 After two returns for regrouting, should the slab fail the test rolling, the Engineer will
 make the decision to leave the slab as is, continue regrouting, or remove and replace the
 slab. Payment will be made under the appropriate pay items for the additional drill holes and
 grout used in the regrouting operation. The cost of test rolling shall be absorbed in other
 items of work.
 The construction methods outlined above may be modified by the Engineer as field
 conditions indicate.
 268
 
 SECTION 453
 PRESSURE GROUTING AND REPAIR OF PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 Pressure grouting operations shall cease at least three hours before sundown, except
 that on cloudy days pressure grouting operations shall cease earlier as necessary to permit
 grout to harden at least three hours prior to allowing traffic back on the grouted slab before
 first darkness. First darkness shall be defined as that time of day the average traveling public
 vehicle would first begin to use its headlights.
 
 (c) Removal and Replacement of Pavement Slabs.
 1. Removal.
 The extent of removal shall be as shown on the plans or directed by the Engineer. The
 slab section designated for removal shall be sawed as shown on the plans. The Contractor
 shall not oversaw the slab within 2 feet {600 mm} of another oversaw or within 2 feet {600
 mm} of any type of joint. Transverse cuts for removal and the placing of new steel tie bars
 shall be performed as shown by plan details. The sections of pavement to be removed may be
 removed in any manner approved by the Engineer which does not damage the underlying base
 layer, adjacent concrete slabs, or the joint steel. Any damage to the underlying base or
 adjacent slabs shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the Engineer. Joint steel shall be
 cleaned and reconditioned to provide the same load transfer and/or tie as in the original
 pavement design. Any damaged or destroyed steel, which in the opinion of the Engineer
 would not function properly, shall be replaced in kind and retied to the old pavement by
 drilling an appropriate size hole of the proper depth and anchoring the new bar with an
 approved adhesive material. This replacement also includes steel damaged or destroyed
 previous to the removal operation. All tie bars and dowel bars tied to the old pavement shall
 be anchored into place with an approved adhesive material in such a manner as to meet a
 7200 pound {32 kN}, minimum, pull-out requirement. The Department will perform the
 pull-out tests in accordance with ALDOT-366. The Contractor shall supply the equipment
 necessary to perform the pull-out test.
 Slabs shall be removed and replaced during the same day. Preparation for removal,
 including sawing the slab into smaller pieces, may be done the day prior to removal, but
 traffic shall be maintained on the slab the night before removal.
 2. Concrete Pavement Replacement.
 After completion of removal operation, the joint steel and/or reinforcing steel shall be
 reconditioned or replaced (reconditioned means the cleaning and straightening of the steel
 bars and the cleaning, painting, greasing, replacement, etc. of the dowels), new tie bars
 placed as detailed by the plans, and the base cleaned and repaired as directed, and then the
 slab shall be poured.
 The Contractor shall provide gang drills or templates that will provide the proper
 alignment for holes drilled for dowels or tie bars. The size of the drilled hole shall be 1/8 of
 an inch {3 mm} greater in diameter than the diameter of the dowel or tie bar being installed
 therein. The drill used shall not cause any spalling of the existing concrete around the face of
 the drill hole.
 The Contractor shall provide a device that will place the adhesive in the back of the
 drilled hole first and then proceed toward the front. After the dowels or tie bars are
 anchored in place, the Contractor shall allow time for the adhesive to set and then allow
 sufficient time for any required pull-out tests to be performed prior to pouring the
 replacement slab.
 The concrete paving slab shall be poured in accordance with the provisions of Section
 450 except that Structural Portland Cement Concrete meeting the requirements of Section
 501 for a Class A concrete utilizing either Type III cement or Type I cement with a
 non-chloride accelerator, shall be used and a full paving train will not be required. Unless
 shown otherwise by the plans, the surface finish and slope of the new pavement shall be the
 same as the adjoining pavement slabs. If the pavement is to be covered by a bituminous
 overlay, a wood float finish and straight slope will be acceptable. All joints, except
 expansion joints, with adjacent pavement shall be butt type tied construction joints.
 Expansion joints shall be reconstructed so that the continuity of existing expansion joints are
 retained utilizing similar joint filler and sealed with the type sealer specified on the plans.
 Other reconstructed joints which require sealing shall be sealed with the specified type
 sealer. When a joint is completely removed, new materials shall be used throughout the
 
 269
 
 SECTION 453
 PRESSURE GROUTING AND REPAIR OF PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 joint. All materials necessary to repair or reconstruct the joints in or adjacent to the
 concrete pavement replacement is considered incidental to said replacement.
 All joints shall be constructed in accordance with the provisions of Subarticle 450.03(j)
 except as noted herein. Due to the requirement for the use of either an accelerator or Type
 III cement in the concrete mix, extreme care shall be taken to see that joints are saw cut
 before uncontrolled shrinkage cracking begins.
 Slabs that have been removed shall be replaced the same day they are removed.
 The Contractor shall use such approved methods as necessary to keep all pavement
 surfaces adjacent to this operation reasonably clean of excess grout or other materials at all
 times.
 
 (d) Opening to Traffic.
 No traffic, including construction equipment, will be permitted on the grouted slabs until at
 least three hours after the grouting has been completed.
 No traffic, including construction equipment will be permitted on the replaced slab until at
 least six hours after the slab has been poured.
 Traffic shall be placed on grouted slabs before first darkness of the same day that the slabs
 were grouted; traffic shall be placed on replaced slabs no later than the morning following the day
 the slabs were replaced.
 
 453.04 Method of Measurement.
 Each drill hole through the concrete paving slab ordered by the Engineer and placed in accordance
 with the requirements noted herein in this Section and properly filled after satisfactory use will be
 measured for payment.
 Portland cement concrete grout will be measured for payment by the bag (94 pounds {42 kg}) of
 Portland cement used in the grout; all other ingredients required in the grout will not be measured for
 payment.
 Concrete pavement removed will be measured in square yards {square meters} computed from
 surface measurements taken to the nearest 0.1 foot {0.1 meter}.
 Concrete pavement replacement slabs will be measured by computing the theoretical cubic yards
 {cubic meters} of concrete necessary to replace the removed slab. The thickness used in computing the
 theoretical cubic yards {cubic meters} will be the average thickness necessary to replace the slab and
 to fill any voids, except those caused by the Contractor, underneath the slab.

 SECTION 454
 CLEANING AND SEALING JOINTS AND CRACKS IN
 CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 454.01 Description.
 This Section shall cover the work of cleaning and sealing joints and cracks in existing concrete
 pavement. The shape of the joints shall be restored by sawing the concrete to allow the proper sealing
 of the joints. Cracks shall be sealed by the routing of a groove at the crack for the placement of
 sealant.
 The cleaning and sealing of joints and cracks will be classified by "Type" in accordance with the
 following:
 Type I: Cleaning and sealing of joints and cracks that will not be covered by a bituminous
 overlay.
 Type II: Cleaning and sealing of joints and cracks that will be covered by a bituminous
 overlay.
 
 454.02 Materials.
 The sealant shall be either a Hot Applied Joint Sealant or a Cold Applied Joint Sealant as shown on
 the plans. Joint sealants shall meet the requirements given in Section 832 for joint and crack sealants.
 
 454.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) Submittal of Equipment Data.
 The Contractor shall submit descriptions of all equipment proposed for use in sawing the
 joints, routing the cracks, cleaning the joints and cracks and placing the sealant. The submittal
 shall also consist of the operational guidelines from the equipment manufacturer. The Contractor
 shall deliver the submittal to the Engineer for review. The Engineer will not approve the submittal
 but will review it for completeness. The Engineer will prohibit the use of equipment that may
 damage the pavement or result in a joint or crack that cannot be sealed. Equipment shall not be
 brought to the worksite until the Engineer informs the Contractor that the submittal is complete.
 
 (b) Preparation of Joints for Sealant.
 The old joint sealant material and other debris shall be removed from the joint. Material
 placed to form an expansion joint during the original construction of the pavement shall not be
 removed.
 The joint shall then be cut with a concrete saw to provide the shape and size of joint shown
 on the plans. The concrete saw shall be a saw that is designed for cutting concrete. If water is
 used to facilitate cutting, the resulting slurry shall be completely removed from the joint and the
 pavement surfaces before it dries. Removal of the slurry shall be by flushing the joint and
 pavement surface with a jet of water under pressure and by the use of other tools as required by
 the Engineer.
 After the sawing, and flushing if necessary, the joint shall then be cleaned of loose material
 by the use of compressed air.
 If further cleaning is required prior to sealing, one or more of the following cleaning methods
 shall be used:
 271
 
 SECTION 454
 CLEANING AND SEALING JOINTS AND CRACKS IN CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 Wire Brush and Muriatic Acid: The joints shall be thoroughly cleaned with a mechanical
 wire brush and other tools as necessary. All harmful materials such as oil, asphalt,
 curing compound, paint, rust and other debris shall be completely removed. After
 brushing, a solution of 10 % commercial muriatic acid shall be applied to the
 surfaces of the joint. After the foaming action of the acid has ceased, the joint shall
 be thoroughly flushed with water and thoroughly brushed again. After flushing and
 rebrushing, the joint shall be blown out with compressed air.
 Sand Blasting: The joints shall be thoroughly cleaned with a sand blaster and other tools
 as necessary. All material such as oil, asphalt, curing compound, paint, rust and
 other debris shall be completely removed. After blasting, the joint shall be blown
 out with compressed air.
 High Pressure Water Jet: The joints shall be thoroughly cleaned of all debris including
 old sealant.
 Air compressors used for cleaning joints shall be equipped with traps and filters capable of
 removing water and oil in the compressed air. This compressed air will be checked by the Engineer
 for contamination. The air compressor shall be replaced if the air contains water or oil.
 
 (c) Preparation of Cracks for Sealant.
 Cracks shall be prepared for sealant by the cutting of a groove in the concrete with a rotary
 router. The groove shall be cut along the centerline of the crack to the shape and size shown on
 the plans. After the crack has been routed, it shall be cleaned and dried using the same
 procedures that are required for cleaning and drying joints.
 
 (d) Sealing of Joints and Cracks.
 Surfaces shall be clean and dry before the placement of the sealant. Immediately before the
 joint sealant is placed compressed air having a pressure of at least 90 psi {600 kPA} shall be used
 to blow out the joint and remove all traces of dust.
 If a primer is recommended by the manufacturer of the sealant, it shall be used in
 accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
 The sealant shall not be placed when the air temperature is less than 50 °F {10 °C} or is 50 °F
 {10 °C} and falling, unless allowed by the Engineer.
 The sealant may be applied by a mechanical device or by manual pouring or trowelling, unless
 recommended otherwise by the manufacturer. When applied mechanically or by pouring, a nozzle
 or pouring spout shall be shaped to fit inside the joint or crack to introduce the sealant from
 inside the joint or groove.
 After a joint or crack has been sealed, all surplus primer or sealant on the pavement surfaces
 shall be promptly removed.
 Traffic shall not be permitted over sealed joints or cracks until the sealant is tack free.
 In addition, the sealant shall be placed and worked to provide the shape of sealed joint or
 crack shown on the plans.
 
 (e) Spalls.
 Spalls adjacent to joints and cracks that are smaller than 3 square inches {2000 mm²}
 measured across the surface of the pavement shall be cleaned with the cleaning of the joint or
 crack. The spall shall then be filled with sealant when the sealant is placed in the joint or crack.
 (The full depth of the slab may be designated for replacement in accordance with the
 requirements given in Section 453 where the spall is larger than 3 square inches {2000 mm²}.)
 
 454.04 Method of Measurement.

 Said grinding is intended to substantially correct joint faulting, surface drainage, skid resistance,
 riding characteristics and/or removal of excessive surface material.
 
 455.02 Materials.
 N/A
 
 455.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) General.
 It is intended that areas of the pavement surface designated by the plans or Engineer to be
 processed shall be ground to eliminate joint or crack faults and to provide a constant pavement
 cross slope within the designated grinding limits in each lane. Adjacent sides of longitudinal joints
 or crack shall be in the same plane. Adjacent sides of transverse joints or cracks in excess of 1/16
 of an inch {2 mm} shall be reground until flush.
 If a progress schedule for the grinding operation is not shown on the plans, the Contractor
 may select his own grinding operation schedule. The grinding operation shall be expeditiously
 performed in a continuous operation on a traffic lane before grinding begins on a succeeding lane.
 The residue created by the grinding operation shall be satisfactorily removed as the grinding
 operation proceeds.
 
 (b) Equipment.
 Grinding equipment shall be a self-propelled unit specifically designed to grind Portland

 will not be allowed when Type “F” chemical admixtures are used.
 In no case shall the water to total cementitious material ratio specified be exceeded in
 order to increase the slump and/or adjust the mixture.
 Slump shall be measured in accordance with the requirements given in AASHTO-T-119.
 10. Concrete Production.
 During the progress of the work, the relative proportions between the fine and coarse
 aggregates, and between aggregate and water, may be varied as needed for best results, but
 the water to total cementitious material ratio shall not be changed except as noted below:
 If it is impossible to produce concrete having the desired consistency the total amount of
 cementitious material may be increased to achieve the desired consistency provided that the
 maximum water to total cementitious material ratio is not exceeded and there is no
 additional cost to the Department.
 If the Engineer finds it advisable to increase the minimum design strength of the
 concrete and orders the cementitious factor increased, the State will reimburse the
 Contractor for the actual amount only of the additional cementitious material used, based on
 actual f.o.b. destination, with the additional quantity calculated from the theoretical
 cementitious factor determined by the Engineer and not from count of bags or weight {mass}
 used.
 The concrete mixture designs shall use Type I, II, or Type I/II portland cement unless
 otherwise specified. The Contractor may, for his own convenience and without additional
 compensation, substitute Type III portland cement, provided prior approval is given by the
 Materials and Tests Engineer.
 It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to carry out uniform construction practices,
 which will produce concrete with the specified plastic concrete properties and of not less
 than the minimum specified compressive strength. Concrete with compressive strength
 below the minimum specified compressive strength will be investigated in accordance with
 ALDOT-170 prior to repairing or removing the affected concrete. Should low compressive
 strength occur consistently, the Materials and Tests Engineer may order corrective action as
 deemed necessary, without additional cost to the Department.
 Where the conditions require the use of low tricalcium aluminate cement, the plans or
 proposal will designate Type II portland cement. In such case, if requested and approved in
 writing, Type I or Type I/II portland cement containing a maximum of eight percent
 
 283
 
 SECTION 501
 STRUCTURAL PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 tricalcium aluminate may be used. Should Type III portland cement be permitted, a
 maximum of eight percent tricalcium aluminate shall still apply.
 
 (d) Sampling and Inspection.
 Production of required aggregate gradation in the concrete mixture shall be the Contractor's
 responsibility.
 Cement, aggregates, water, and chemical and mineral admixtures shall be accepted on the
 basis of requirements currently listed in the Department's Testing Manual.
 The Department reserves the right to take samples of aggregates from stockpiles,
 cementitious materials from storage bins, and chemical admixtures from storage tanks at the
 mixing or batching plant and to make further tests as needed as the basis for continued
 acceptance of the materials.
 The Contractor shall furnish, without extra compensation, samples of the materials and the
 concrete mixture for making tests and test specimens as required to comply with the Department's
 Testing Manual. Additional testing may be required if deemed necessary by the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall furnish, without extra compensation, a protected environment for all
 concrete test cylinders produced incidental to any placement of concrete. This shall be
 accomplished by supplying a cylinder curing box with a minimum capacity of 22 test cylinders 6" X
 12" {150 mm X 300 mm} in size, equipped with heating/cooling capabilities, automatic
 temperature control, and a maximum/minimum (high/low) temperature readout. The protective
 environment shall be capable of protecting all specimens within the following specification
 requirements and it shall be available at each site when concrete is placed and then maintained
 until such time that all specimens have been transported from the project to the testing facility.
 The Engineer, prior to beginning any concrete placement, shall approve each protective
 environment.
 Immediately after being struck off, the concrete test specimens shall be moved to the
 protective environment where they shall remain for an initial curing period of not less than 24
 hours or more than 48 hours. During the initial curing period, the specimens shall be stored in a
 moist environment at a temperature range between 60 ºF to 80 ºF {16 ºC to 27 ºC}, preventing any
 loss of moisture for up to 48 hours. At all times the temperature in and between concrete
 specimens shall be controlled by shielding the specimens from cooling/heating devices and direct
 rays of the sun.
 A temperature record of the specimens shall be established by means of maximum/minimum
 (high/low) thermometers supplied by the Contractor. Only plastic molds shall be used for concrete
 specimens to be immersed in water.
 Concrete specimens that are to be transported to the laboratory for standard curing within 48
 hours shall remain in the molds in a moist environment, until they are received in the laboratory,
 removed from molds, and placed in standard curing.
 Concrete specimens that are not transported to the laboratory for standard curing within 48
 hours shall be removed from the molds within 24 ± 8 hours and standard curing used until
 transported to the laboratory. During the standard curing period, the specimens shall be stored at
 a temperature of 73 ± 3 ºF {23 ± 2 ºC} using the cylinder curing box defined above. Standard curing
 shall comply with AASHTO T 23 “Making and Curing Concrete Test Specimens in the Field”,
 Standard Curing section.
 
 501.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) General.
 All materials, labor, equipment, tools, and machinery necessary for forming, mixing, placing,
 finishing, and curing shall be available as required and all necessary equipment for the proper
 construction and completion of any section of the work shall be in satisfactory working condition
 before the Contractor will be permitted to start placing concrete.
 All concrete batching plants supplying concrete shall be on List I-7, "Portland Cement
 Concrete Producers", of the MSDSAR manual. The concrete producer shall submit a valid BMT-75
 and proof of NRMCA certification to the Area Materials Engineer prior to batching concrete.
 All batching plants shall meet the requirements of theSpecifications and ALDOT-352.
 Producers who request that their batching plants be placed on the list of evaluated ready-mix
 concrete plants will be charged afee as specified by ALDOT-355, "General Information Concerning
 Materials, Sources, and Devices With Special Acceptance Requirements".
 284
 
 SECTION 501
 STRUCTURAL PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 
 (b) Equipment.
 1. General.
 The Contractor shall furnish equipment capable of producing concrete meeting the
 requirements noted in this Section in sufficient quantities to provide for orderly construction
 of the project. All equipment must be in good working order and so maintained throughout
 the requirement for its use.
 Specific requirements for certain types of equipment are designated in subsequent items
 of this Subarticle.
 2. Mixing and Transporting Equipment.
 Concrete for all major structure work (bridges, culverts, retaining walls, etc.) shall be
 "ready-mixed" concrete. Ready-mixed concrete is defined as portland cement concrete
 manufactured for delivery and delivered to the work site in accordance with AASHTO M 157
 “Ready-Mixed Concrete” Modified* and the requirements written herein in other parts of
 these specifications. In case of discrepancy these specifications shall govern.
 *Modification of AASHTO M 157. The requirements of Paragraph 8.1 shall include the
 following: “Should this method of measuring fly ash or other cementitious materials
 cumulatively with cement produce unsatisfactory results, it shall be discontinued and
 separate scales and hoppers provided for these ingredients.”
 Concrete for minor structure work (headwalls, inlets, junction boxes, and other
 miscellaneous individual concrete units requiring three cubic yards {3 cubic meters} or less of
 concrete, along with such items as slope paving, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, and combinations
 thereof) may be mixed in mixers as noted above or an approved type of mobile mixing plant
 designed with separate bins for fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, cement, water, additives,
 etc. that will automatically proportion all concrete aggregates either by weight {mass} or
 volume and be capable of combining the ingredients into a uniform mass and discharging such
 without segregation. It shall have approved equipment that will determine the volume of
 concrete dispatched. Said alternate type mobile mixing plant shall be capable of providing
 concrete complying with the mixture design requirements noted in Article 501.02. Prior
 written approval of such alternate equipment shall be obtained before it is allowed on the
 project. Basis for this approval will be upon the satisfactory performance of the equipment
 when checked in accordance with the provisions of AASHTO M 241 "Concrete Made by
 Volumetric Batching and Continuous Mixing". The costs of all materials and labor furnished to
 perform the above mentioned test shall be absorbed by the Contractor,
 If the Contractor requests to use portable concrete mixers equal or less than 15 cubic
 feet {0.5 cubic meter}, the Materials and Tests Engineer may approve their use and will
 furnish written requirements covering such mixers.
 All mixing and transporting equipment shall be supplied in sufficient amounts to provide
 continuous delivery of the concrete as needed for an acceptable, satisfactory operation. The
 volume of concrete mixed or transported in a concrete truck mixer shall not be less than 15%
 of the gross volume of the drum.
 Concrete transit mixers shall be equipped with either an in-line water meter or a sight
 gauge to accurately measure the amount of water discharged into the drum. In-line water
 meters shall be accurate to within ±1.0% of the designated quantity; sight gauges shall be
 accurate to within ±1.0 gallon. Water measuring devices shall be considered acceptable if the
 truck has been certified by NRMCA as part of their Delivery Fleet Inspection. The NRMCA
 Delivery Fleet Certification Card shall be affixed in a prominent location on the truck, such as
 the windshield or driver’s side door. Trucks shall be recertified annually, in accordance with
 NRMCA policy. The concrete producer shall maintain a record of their NRMCA certified trucks,
 available for review by the Department at any time. Additionally, the accuracy of water
 meters and sight gauges shall be verified in accordance with ALDOT-407, “Verification of
 Water-Measurement Devices for Concrete Delivery Vehicles”.
 Each transit mixer shall be equipped with an approved automatic counter that will
 record the number of drum revolutionsregardless ofthe drum speed.
 3. Vibrators.
 Vibrators shall be of an approved internal vibrating type and design, unless the Engineer
 gives special authorization for other types. Vibrators shall be capable of transmitting
 vibrations to the concrete at frequencies of not less than 4500 impulses per minute. The
 285
 
 SECTION 501
 STRUCTURAL PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 Contractor shall provide a sufficient number of vibrators to properly compact each batch
 immediately after it is placed in the forms. At least one standby vibrating unit in workable
 order shall be available before the start of any placement of concrete.
 
 (c) Addition of Water at Jobsite.
 Field addition of water to concrete shall be allowed only upon arrival of the truck at the
 jobsite, if slump tests indicate the mix is too stiff. If water is added, the drum shall be turned an
 additional 30 revolutions prior to discharging any more concrete. In no instance shall the maximum
 water-cementitious ratio of the mixture design, or the maximum slump be exceeded. Tests for
 slump, total air content, temperature & compressive strength shall be run after the addition of
 water at the jobsite, regardless of any previous testing.
 
 (d) Time, Light and Weather Limitations.
 1. Time of Hauling and Placing Concrete.
 The delivery and placement of ready-mixed concrete shall be completed within the time
 frames listed in the following table. These times are measured from the time at which water
 is added to the cement until the time at which placement of the load is completed.

 If Type III portland cement is used, the time limits shall be reduced by 15 minutes. If
 requested, and approved in writing by the Materials and Tests Engineer, a hydration stabilizer
 can be used to extend the retardation of set time of concrete.
 The Materials and Tests Engineer may permit mixing and the adding of the cement and
 additives at the work site in truck mixers, in order to meet the time limitation requirements.
 When a ready-mixed truck is used for concrete delivery, the concrete shall be
 completely discharged from the mixing drum before the truck mixer has completed 300
 revolutions and or before the above time limitations for placement have been exceeded;
 whichever happens first.
 2. Light.
 All concrete shall be placed and finished during daylight hours, unless written permission
 to the contrary is given. Such permission will not be given unless an adequate approved
 lighting system is available for all operations after sundown.
 3. Weather.
 a. General.
 The temperature of the concrete, at the time of placing in the forms shall not be
 less than 50 °F {10 °C} nor more than 95 °F {35 °C}, except that for bridge deck slabs
 the temperature of the concrete at the time of placing shall not be more than 90 ºF {32
 ºC }, unless otherwise provided or directed.
 b. Cold Weather Operations.
 No concrete shall be placed when the ambient air temperature is below40 °F
 {5 °C}without written permission of the Engineer. If the Contractor proposes to place
 concrete during seasons when there is a probability of temperatures lower than 40 °F
 {5 °C}, the Contractor shall have available on the project such suitable approved
 equipment and materials as necessary to enclose the uncured concrete and keep the air
 temperature inside the enclosure within the following ranges and for the minimum times
 noted hereinafter.
 If there are indications there will be temperatures below 40 °F {5 °C} during the
 first three days after placement of concrete, it shall be protected from cold
 temperatures by keeping the surface at a temperature above 50 °F {10 °C} for the first
 72 hours after placement and above 32 °F {0 °C} an additional 72 hours. However, the
 
 286
 
 SECTION 501
 STRUCTURAL PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 protective covering shall be retained in place until the temperature inside the protective
 covering reaches that of the surrounding atmosphere.
 When the Contractor is permitted to place concrete at temperatures below 40 °F
 {5 °C}, the aggregates and/or mixing water shall be heated as necessary to keep the
 temperature of the plastic concrete above 50 °F {10 °C} from the time of placement to
 the time of initial set; however, in no case shall the materials be heated in excess of 150
 °F {65 °C}, nor shall aggregates from frozen stockpiles be incorporated into the mixture.
 Materials entering the mixer shall be free from ice, snow, or frozen lumps. Salts,
 chemicals, or other materials shall not be incorporated in the concrete to prevent
 freezing. Care shall be taken to heat all materials uniformly and avoid hot spots that
 will burn or overheat the materials.
 The Contractor shall assume all risk and added cost connected with mixing, placing
 and protecting of concrete during cold weather. Permission given by the Engineer to
 place concrete during such time will in no way relieve the Contractor of responsibility
 for satisfactory results. Should it be determined at any time that concrete placed under
 such conditions is found to be unsatisfactory, it shall be removed and replaced with
 satisfactory concrete by the Contractor without extra compensation.
 c. Hot Weather Operations.
 The following hot weather operations practices shall be followed for all concreting
 done between June 1 and September 15 of each year, and any other time when the
 temperature of the concrete may be above 95 ºF {35 ºC} or 90 ºF {32 ºC} for bridge deck
 slabs.
 The Contractor shall submit in writing aproposed plan for controlling the concrete
 mixture temperature during hot weather operations. The hot weather concrete plan
 shall outline the Contractor’s procedures to maintain the temperature of the concrete at
 or below the temperature requirements noted above, and the Contractor’s procedures
 for transporting, handling, placing, finishing, and curing concrete during hot weather.
 The hot weather concrete plan shall be submitted at the pre-construction conference to
 the Area Materials Engineer for approval before any concrete placement is allowed.
 During hot weather operations an approved retarder admixture shall be used in the
 concrete mixture, and the concrete shall be properly placed and finished with the
 procedures previously submitted by the Contractor. Cooling of the mixing water and/or
 aggregates or placement during the cooler part of the day may be required to meet the
 above maximum temperature requirements. In no instance shall a concrete bridge deck
 slab mixture be placed when the temperature of the plastic concrete is above 90 °F
 {32 °C}. When the temperature of the steel is greater than 120 ºF {50 ºC}, the steel
 forms and reinforcement steel shall be cooled prior to concrete placement. Conveying
 and placing equipment shall be cooled if necessary to maintain proper concrete placing
 temperature.
 
 (e) Handling and Placing Concrete.
 1. General.
 In preparation for the placing of concrete, all sawdust, chips, and other construction
 debris and extraneous matter shall be removed from the interior of forms. Temporary struts,
 stays, or braces serving to hold the forms in place until the concrete is placed shall be
 removed prior to being encased in the concrete. All permanent struts, stays, or braces shall
 be precast concrete struts or, at the Contractor's option, approved steel struts; no wooden
 struts shall be permitted.
 During the placing of concrete, the Contractor shall continuously check the alignment of
 forms and immediately correct any yielding of the forms or falsework.
 Concrete shall be deposited continuously for each monolithic section of the work by
 placing the fresh concrete in horizontal layers of approximately 12 inches {300 mm} in
 thickness. Each additional layer shall be placed and compacted before the preceding layer
 has taken its initial set, 45 minutes for mixtures without retarder and 60 minutes for mixtures
 with retarder.
 For vertical members the maximum height of concrete placement shall not exceed 20
 feet {6 m}, except for underwater concrete or when steel forms are used. When structurally
 sound steel forms are used, concrete placement may be made up to 30 feet {9 m} in height
 287
 
 SECTION 501
 STRUCTURAL PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 provided that an approved mortar tight downspout of sufficient length to reach within 5 feet
 {1.5 m} of the bottom of the placed concrete and a vibrator of sufficient length to provide
 good consolidation throughout the concrete placement are used. Any vertical member
 exceeding 20 feet {6 m} in height shall be broken into two or more approximately equal
 concrete placements unless the preceding requirements are met.
 When succeeding concrete placements are necessary, the next concrete placement will
 not be permitted until the concrete in the underlying placed concrete has aged at least 12
 hours or attained a minimum compressive strength of 2400 psi {17 MPa} from cylinders
 prepared in conformity with AASHTO T 23. When a set retarding admixture is used in the
 preceding concrete placement, the next concrete placement shall not be permitted until a
 2400 psi {17 MPa} cylinder strength is attained.
 The forms shall not be jarred nor shall any strain be placed on reinforcing bars partially
 encased in concrete that will cause damage to bond. All accumulations of mortar splashed on
 the reinforcing steel and surfaces of forms shall be removed before the next concrete
 placement.
 When it is necessary to pump water from the excavation during placing of concrete to
 deposit the concrete in the dry, the sump for the intake hose shall be located outside the
 forms.
 The use of aluminum pipes, chutes, or other devices made of aluminum that come into
 direct contact with the concrete shall not be utilized in the handling and placing operations.
 a. Use of Chutes, Pipes or Belts.
 Concrete shall not be dropped a distance of more than 5 feet {1.5 m} unless
 confined in an approved mortar tight downspout of not less than 4 inches {100 mm} in
 diameter. Downspouts shall be equipped with suitable hoppers at their inlet end and
 shall be provided in sectional lengths that will permit adjustment of the level of the
 outlet during placement.
 The number of downspouts furnished shall be sufficient to ensure the concrete
 placement in horizontal layers. Depositing large quantities of concrete at one point in
 the form and running, flowing, or working the concrete along the forms will not be
 permitted.
 In wall sections where a 4 inch {100 mm} downspout cannot be utilized without
 displacing the reinforcing steel, the concrete may be dropped in excess of the 5 feet {1.5
 m} previously noted, provided such does not displace the reinforcing steel nor produce
 segregation of the concrete.
 (1) Chutes, pipes, or power belts may be used to convey concrete from the
 concrete mixer or transporting vehicle to the forms, and they shall convey it to
 its final position without segregation and without displacing the reinforcing
 steel. If the use of this equipment results in honeycombed or otherwise
 substandard concrete, the Engineer will require it to be changed or its use
 discontinued.
 (2) Chutes, pipes, and power belts shall be flushed with water after each run and
 this water shall be discharged free of the freshly placed concrete. All hardened
 concrete shall be promptly removed.
 b. Pumping.
 Direct placement of concrete by an approved pumping device will be permitted.
 The equipment shall be so arranged that no vibration result that might damage freshly
 placed concrete. The operation of the pump shall be such that a continuous stream of
 concrete without air pockets is produced. When pumping is completed, the concrete
 remaining in the pipeline, if it is to be used, shall be ejected in such a manner that there
 will be no contamination of the concrete or separation of the ingredients. After each
 placement the equipment shall be cleaned to prevent improper results on subsequent
 operations.
 c. Compacting and Vibrating.
 Concrete, except underwater concrete, shall be thoroughly compacted by
 mechanical vibration applied internally, during, and immediately after depositing.
 The application of a vibrator or vibrators shall be at points uniformly spaced and not
 farther apart than twice the radius over which the vibration is visibly effective. Vibrators
 288
 
 SECTION 501
 STRUCTURAL PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 shall be manipulated so as to thoroughly work the concrete around the reinforcement
 and embedded fixtures and into the corners and angles of the forms. Vibration shall be
 supplemented by as much spading as is necessary to ensure smooth surfaces and dense
 concrete.
 The vibrators shall be methodically inserted and withdrawn from the concrete. The
 vibration shall be of sufficient duration and intensity to thoroughly compact the
 concrete, but vibrators shall be withdrawn before segregation and localized areas of
 grout result.
 Vibration shall not be applied directly or through reinforcement to sections or layers
 of concrete that have hardened to the degree that the concrete ceases to be plastic
 under vibration. Vibrators shall not be used to make concrete flow in the forms over
 distances so great as to cause segregation.
 2. Culverts.
 See Section 524 for specific details not covered in this Section.
 3. Retaining Walls.
 See Section 529 for specific details not covered in this Section.
 4. Bridges.
 See Section 510 for specific details not covered in this Section.
 5. Depositing Concrete Under Water.
 a. General.
 Concrete shall not be deposited in water unless provided for on the plans, or
 authorized as provided in Subarticle 503.03(g). Concrete placed under water shall be
 placed as hereinafter provided.
 b. Control.
 Seal concrete shall be placed continuously from start to finish ensuring the concrete
 placement being monolithic. The surface of the concrete shall be kept as nearly
 horizontal as practicable at all times. To ensure bonding, each succeeding layer of seal
 or foundation concrete shall be placed before the preceding layer has initially hardened.
 All laitance or other foreign matter shall be removed from the top surface of the
 concrete, and bonding of construction joints performed in accordance with the
 requirements given elsewhere in this Section.
 c. Placing Methods.
 Concrete specified to be deposited in water shall be seal concrete as provided in
 Article 501.02. To prevent segregation, it shall be carefully placed in a compact mass in
 its final position by means of a tremie, a bottom dump bucket, pumping, or other
 approved method. Concrete shall not be disturbed after being deposited. Still water
 shall be maintained at the point of deposit as nearly as practical.
 (1) Use of Tremie.
 A tremie shall consist of a rigid, watertight tube of sufficient strength to
 withstand the stress to which it is subjected and be at least 8 inches {200 mm} in
 diameter. The tremie shall be supported so as to permit rapid lowering when
 necessary to retard or stop the flow of concrete. The tremie shall be plugged at the
 start of work with an approved device capable of separating the concrete from the
 water until the tube is filled with concrete. The tremie tube shall be kept partially
 filled with concrete at all times during the concrete placement. When a batch is
 dumped into the hopper, the flow of concrete shall be induced by slightly raising
 the tremie, always keeping the discharge end in the deposited concrete. The flow
 shall be as nearly continuous as possible and in no case shall it be intentionally
 interrupted until the entire seal concrete foundation work is completed.
 (2) Use of Bottom Dump Bucket.
 The bottom dump bucket shall have a capacity of not less than 0.5 cubic yards
 {0.5 m³} and be mechanically equipped to prevent dumping until it rests on the
 foundation or previously placed concrete. The bucket shall be completely filled and
 lowered very carefully until it rests upon the foundation or concrete already placed
 so as not to get a wash over the bucket top. It shall then be raised very slowly
 during the discharge travel, the intent being to maintain as nearly as possible, still
 289
 
 SECTION 501
 STRUCTURAL PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 water at the point of discharge and to avoid agitating the mixture; also to allow the
 concrete to be deposited by the time the bucket emerges from the concrete already
 on the foundation.
 (3) Pumping.
 In addition to the requirements given elsewhere in this Section, the following
 shall also apply for placing concrete under water by pumping. Concrete may be
 pumped into a tremie, or directly to the point of placement. If the concrete is
 pumped directly to the point of placement, a rigid pipe shall be provided that must
 extend a minimum of 5 feet {1.5 m} above the water level when resting on the
 bottom of the excavation. A flexible hose suitable for pumping concrete may be
 used from the top of the rigid pipe to the concrete pump. The method of placing
 and handling the concrete shall be as described elsewhere in this Section.
 
 (f) Construction Joints.
 1. General.
 Construction joints shall be placed only at the locations shown on the plans or as
 directed. In case of an emergency, if a construction joint is permitted, it shall be placed as
 approved by the Engineer.
 2. Horizontal Joints.
 Generally, horizontal joints shall be made by placing the concrete slightly above the
 grade of the construction joint, and after the surface has reached its final set, the surface
 shall be prepared as outlined in Item 4 below. Insert formwork shall be used to obtain neat,
 horizontal lines.
 3. Vertical Joints.
 Vertical joints shall be formed with substantial bulkheads or headers as required.
 Feather-edged joints will not be permitted.
 4. Bonding.
 Before placing concrete against any construction joint, the surface of the hardened
 concrete shall be scarified in such a manner that all foreign matter, laitance, and loose
 material is removed to expose sound concrete. The prepared concrete at the construction
 joint shall be kept wet for a minimum of one hour prior to placing concrete against it. An
 approved epoxy, listed in the MSDSAR manual, List II-7, "Epoxy Resin Systems for Use with
 Portland Cement Concrete", shall be placed for bonding freshly mixed concrete to hardened
 concrete. Keyways and dowels shall be placed as shown on the plans or directed.
 5. Water Stops.
 Water stops shall be furnished and placed as required by the plans. They shall form
 continuous watertight joints.
 
 (g) Expansion Joints.
 All joints shall be constructed according to details shown on the plans, providing the design
 width designated for the expansion joint. The insertion and removal of joint forming material shall
 be accomplished without chipping or breaking the corners of the concrete. Expansion material,
 when required, shall be placed as shown on the plans.
 
 (h) Forms.
 1. General.
 Reference is made to Article 105.02 concerning working drawings and other details that
 require submission.
 Forms shall be substantial and unyielding and so designed and constructed that the
 finished concrete will conform to the plan dimensions and contours within tolerances listed in
 other portions of these Specifications.
 Basic bridge plan design is for removable forms and plan concrete quantities computed
 accordingly. Hence, removable forms are to be used unless stay-in-place forms are allowed by
 contract plan notes and details. When shown by contract plan details, the Contractor will be
 allowed the option of using permanent steel forms under deck slabs between girders, beams
 or stringers provided the cost of extra concrete and materials required by this type of form is
 at the Contractor's expense.
 2. Design.
 290
 
 SECTION 501
 STRUCTURAL PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 a. Removable Forms.
 All removable forms shall be designed so that they may be removed without damage
 to the concrete. Forms shall be so constructed that portions where finishing is required
 can be removed for that purpose without loosening supports or disturbing portions of
 forms that must still remain in place.
 b. Permanent Steel Bridge Deck Forms.
 The forms and supports shall be zinc coated (Galvanized) steel conforming to ASTM
 A 653 with coating Class of G165 according to ASTM A 525 and shall otherwise meet all
 requirements relevant to permanent steel forms and the placing of concrete as specified
 herein and as noted on the plans. Miscellaneous fastener hardware (bolts, nuts, metal
 screws, and washers) shall be common stock hardware items galvanized to provide a zinc
 coating equal to or better than that required by ASTM B 633.
 The following criteria shall govern the design of permanent steel bridge deck forms:
 (1) The steel forms shall be designed on the basis of dead load of form,
 reinforcement, and plastic concrete plus 50 pounds per square foot {2.4
 kN/m²} for construction loads. The unit working stress in the steel shall not be
 more than 0.725 of the specified minimum yield strength of the material
 furnished, but not to exceed 36,000 pounds per square inch {250 MPa}. The
 uncoated thickness of the forms shall not be thinner than 0.0359 inch {0.9
 mm}.
 (2) Deflection under the weight {mass} of the forms, the plastic concrete, and
 reinforcement shall not exceed 1/180 of the form span or 0.5 inches {13 mm},
 whichever is less, but in no case shall this loading be less than 120 pounds per
 square foot {5.7 kN/m²} total.
 The permissible form camber shall be based on the actual dead load condition.
 Camber shall not be used to compensate for deflection in excess of the
 foregoing limits.
 (3) The design span of the form sheets shall be the clear span of the form plus
 2 inches {50 mm} measured parallel to the form flutes.
 (4) Physical design properties shall be computed in accordance with requirements
 of the American Iron and Steel Institute Specification for the Design of Cold
 Formed Steel Structural Members, latest published edition.
 (5) The plan dimensions of both layers of primary deck reinforcement from the top
 surface of the concrete deck shall be maintained. A minimum concrete cover of
 1 inch {25 mm} shall be maintained for the bottom slab steel.
 (6) Forms shall not be welded to any part of the structural steel main members
 (the definition of "main members" is given in Section 836. The installation of
 forms may be done by welding attachment straps together if backing plates are
 installed under the straps. The backing plates shall be thick enough to prevent
 burn-through. The width of the backing plates shall be at least one inch wider
 than the width of the welded attachment straps so that the backing plates
 extend out at least one half inch beyond each edge of the welded straps.
 3. Construction.
 a. Removable Forms.
 (1) Forms shall be mortar tight and placed and maintained true to designated lines
 and grades until the concrete has been placed and hardened. Forms found
 unsatisfactory in any respect shall not be used and, if rejected, shall be
 removed from the immediate work site.
 (2) All moldings, panel work, and bevel strips shall be straight and true with neatly
 mitered joints and all corners in the finished work shall be true, sharp, and
 clean cut and of good workmanship. Forms shall be filleted and chamfered at
 all sharp corners except where angles exceed 90°, such as at the face of bridge
 curbs and deck overhangs. Unless otherwise shown on the plans, the equal
 sides on triangular molding or chamfer shall be 0.75 inches {19 mm}, except
 that for small members the width shall be 0.5 inches {13 mm}.
 (3) For narrow walls, columns, et cetera, the Engineer may require daylight and
 inspection holes at vertical intervals as directed.
 291
 
 SECTION 501
 STRUCTURAL PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 (4) Bolts or ties shall be used to prevent forms from spreading. All such bolts or
 ties shall be arranged so that at least 1 inch {25 mm} of that part adjacent to
 the concrete surface can be removed or broken off.
 (5) Anchor devices may be cast in the concrete for later use in supporting forms
 only if they are detailed on approved formwork or falsework plans.
 (6) The inside of all forms shall be coated with a non-staining oil or other approved
 material to prevent the concrete adhering to them. Extreme care shall be
 exercised to ensure that form oil does not come in contact with structural or
 reinforcing steel.
 (7) The forms shall be inspected before placing the concrete and the interior
 dimensions carefully checked to ensure that the concrete will be of the form
 and dimensions shown on the plans. The inside faces of the form shall be
 thoroughly examined and any projections, ridges, depressions, offsets, spaces
 or other unevenness corrected so that the surface of the concrete will be
 smooth, even and true, and mortar tight. All forms shall be wetted
 immediately prior to placing the concrete, but no excess water shall remain in
 the forms.
 (8) To permit proper surface finishing, forms shall be removed as soon after the
 concrete has set as is practicable and safe. In the determination of the time for
 the removal of forms, except those listed elsewhere in this Section,
 consideration shall be given to the location and character of the structure, the
 weather and other conditions influencing the setting of the concrete, and the
 material used in the mixture. Methods of form removal likely to cause
 over-stressing of the concrete shall not be used. Forms shall not be removed
 without the approval of the Engineer.
 b. Permanent Steel Bridge Deck Forms.
 (1) All forms shall be installed in a manner acceptable to the Engineer.
 (2) On steel members, form sheets will not be permitted to rest directly on the top
 of the stringer or floor beam flanges. Sheets shall be securely fastened to form
 supports and shall have a minimum bearing length of 1 inch {25 mm} at each
 end. Form supports shall be placed in direct contact with the flange of stringer
 or floor beam.The installation of attachment straps, shelf angles, and forms
 shall be carefully monitored to make sure that no welding (weld, arc strike,
 etc.) is done to the structural steel.
 On concrete girders, form supports to be cast into the girders shall be shown on
 the shop drawings. All attachments to form supports shall be made by
 permissible welds, bolts, clips, or other approved means. Attachment by
 welding to form supports may be performed by non-ALDOT qualified welders
 with welding electrodes recommended by the form manufacturer.
 All form welds shall be cleaned of slag and wire brushed just prior to placing of
 the deck concrete.
 (3) Any permanently exposed form metal where the galvanized coating has been
 damaged shall be thoroughly cleaned, wire brushed, and painted with two
 coats zinc oxide-zinc dust primer, Federal Specification TT-P-641, Type II, no
 color added, to the satisfaction of the Engineer. Minor heat discoloration in
 areas of welds need not be touched up.
 (4) Transverse construction joints shall be located at the bottom of a flute and
 0.375 inch {10 mm} weep holes shall be field drilled at not more than 12 inches
 {300 mm} apart along the line of the joint. If a bridge is on a skew, or in a
 curve, a weep hole shall be drilled in the bottom of each flute the joint
 crosses.
 
 (i) Falsework.
 1. Design and Construction.
 a. General.
 For the purpose of this specification, falsework shall be divided into two classes as
 follows:
 292
 
 SECTION 501
 STRUCTURAL PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 Class 1 - Common or simple falsework such as temporary bracing to provide stability
 for bridge girders, permanent steel bridge deck forms, deck overhang
 supports, screed rail support systems, or substructure supports attached to
 permanent parts of the structure (i.e. drilled shafts, columns, caps, etc.).
 Class 2 - Unique or complex falsework such as that required for box girder
 construction, RCDG construction, structural cofferdams, or any falsework used
 in connection with steel erection.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for designing and constructing safe and
 adequate falsework which provides the necessary strength and rigidity, supports all loads
 imposed, and produces a finished structure with lines and grades shown on the plans.
 Falsework shall be designed and constructed to withstand all imposed loads during
 erection, construction, usage, and removal.
 The Contractor shall submit to the Construction Engineer working drawings and
 design calculations for falsework in accordance with Article 105.02.
 For both classes of falsework drawings, the Construction Engineer will verify that
 the licensed Professional Engineer signature and stamp requirements of Subarticle
 105.02(d) are met. Class 1 drawings will be stamped for distribution and then
 distributed. Class 2 drawings will be forwarded to the Bridge Engineer for review to
 determine if the results of the licensed Professional Engineer’s calculations are in
 compliance with design criteria. If the design criteria are met, the submittal will be
 returned to the Construction Engineer to be stamped for distribution and then
 distributed.
 All falsework will be inspected by the Project Manager using the distributed
 drawings. For all Class 2 falsework, the licensed Professional Engineer who signed the
 falsework submittal shall verify that the falsework as constructed meets all design
 criteria prior to any load being placed thereon. A signed statement from the licensed
 Professional Engineer covering the verification shall be furnished to the Project Manager
 by the Contractor.
 When falsework of either class is to be used over highway, pedestrian, or railroad
 traffic, additional details will be required to provide for special protection to prevent
 debris from falling on the traffic below. These additional details will be required for
 both removal and construction work.
 All falsework drawings shall include a description and size of all members,
 connections, and miscellaneous hardware. When pre-manufactured assemblies are used,
 all parts shall be easily identified as those shown on the drawings.
 All falsework shall be designed and constructed to provide the necessary rigidity and
 to support the loads without appreciable settlement or deformation. Screw jacks and/or
 hardwood wedges shall be used to take up any settlement in the formwork either before
 or during the placing of concrete.
 Any part of the permanent structure to which falsework will be attached shall attain
 a minimum compressive strength of 2400 psi {17 MPa} from cylinders prepared in
 conformity with AASHTO T 23 prior to the attachment.
 Falsework that cannot be founded on a satisfactory footing shall be supported on
 piling, which shall be spaced, driven, and removed in an approved manner.
 All spans shall be given a temporary camber to allow for deflection, shrinkage, and
 settlement. Bridges shall have a permanent camber only where so shown on the plans or
 directed.
 b. Design Criteria.
 Falsework shall be designed to withstand all imposed loads during erection,
 construction, usage, and removal. Designs shall be based on minimum loads, maximum
 stresses and deflections, and conditions in the following paragraphs. Allowable stresses
 are based on use of undamaged, high quality materials. The contractor shall reduce
 stresses if lesser quality materials are used.
 Design Loads for falsework shall consist of the sum of dead and live vertical loads
 and assumed horizontal loads. Minimum total design load for any falsework shall not be
 less than 100 pounds per square foot {4.8 kN/m²} for the combined live and dead load
 regardless of slab thickness.
 293
 
 SECTION 501
 STRUCTURAL PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 Dead Loads shall include weight {mass} of concrete, reinforcing steel, forms, and
 falsework. Weight {mass} of concrete, reinforcing steel, and forms shall not be assumed
 to be less than 160 pounds per cubic foot {25 kN/m³}.
 Live Loads shall consist of the actual weight {mass} of any equipment to be
 supported by falsework applied as concentrated loads at the points of contact and a
 uniform load of not less than 20 pounds per square foot {0.960 kN/m²} applied over the
 area supported plus 75 pounds per linear foot {1.1 kN/m} applied at the outside edge of
 deck overhangs.
 Horizontal Loads applied shall be the sum of the actual horizontal loads due to
 equipment, construction sequence, or other causes and an allowance for wind, but in no
 case shall the design horizontal load to be resisted in any direction be less than two
 percent of the total dead load. Falsework shall be designed of sufficient rigidity to resist
 the design horizontal load prior to placement of concrete.
 Falsework Foundations shall be designed to carry the loads imposed on them
 without exceeding allowable soil bearing values and anticipated settlements.
 Maximum allowable stresses, loadings, and deflections used in design of falsework
 shall be as follows:
 TIMBER
 Compression perpendicular to the grain
 450 psi {3 MPa}
 (Dense Select Structural Grade Southern Pine)
 Compression parallel to the grain but not to
 480,000/(L/D)2 psi {3300/(L/D)2 MPa}
 exceed 1600 psi {11 MPa}
 Flexural stress reduced to 1500 psi {10 MPa} for
 members with a nominal depth of 8 inches 1800 psi {12 MPa}
 {200 mm} or less.
 Horizontal shear (Dense Select Structural Grade
 90 psi {0.620 MPa}
 Southern Pine)
 1/240 of clear span irrespective of the fact that
 Deflection due to weight {mass} of concrete.
 the deflection may be compensated for by
 camber strips.
 Timber piles, maximum loading
 24 tons {213 kN}
 (12 inch {300 mm} Butt Diameter)
 STEEL
 Deflection due to weight {mass} of concrete
 irrespective of the fact that the deflection may
 1/240 of clear span
 be compensated for by camber strips.
 Stresses shall not exceed those specified in the Manual of Steel Construction as published by the
 AISC. When the grade of the steel cannot be positively identified, design stresses shall conform to
 either those specified in said AISC Manual for ASTM A 36 steel or the following:
 Tension, axial and flexural.
 22,000 psi {152 MPa}
 Compression, flexural (But not to exceed 22,000
 12,000,000 / (LD/bt) psi {83 000/ (LD/bt) MPa}
 psi {152 MPa})
 Compression, axial.(Except L/r shall not exceed 16,000 - 0.38(L/r)2 psi
 120.)
 {110 - 0.38(L/r)2 MPa}
 Shear on gross section of the web of rolled
 14,500 psi {100 MPa}
 shapes.
 Web crippling for rolled shapes
 27,000 psi {186 MPa}
 In the foregoing formulas, L is the unsupported member length, D is the least
 dimension of rectangular columns, or the width of a square of equivalent cross sectional
 area for round columns, or the depth of beam, b is the width of member, t is the
 thickness of the compression flange and r is the radius of gyration of the member. E,
 modulus of elasticity, used for timber shall be 1.6 X 106 psi {11 GPa} and for steel shall
 be 30 X 106 psi {200 GPa}.
 Any additional design criteria, which may be needed, shall be developed by the
 Contractor's licensed Professional Engineer designer and included with the calculations of
 the falsework submittal.
 294
 
 SECTION 501
 STRUCTURAL PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 Falsework over or adjacent to roadways or railroads which are open to traffic during
 construction shall be designed and constructed such that it is stable if subjected to
 vehicular impact or features shall be provided to protect falsework supports from
 vehicular impact. Protection shall be designed such that it does not present a hazard to
 vehicular traffic.
 Design criteria for permanent steel bridge deck forms shall be as shown elsewhere
 in this Section.
 2. Removal of Falsework.
 No falsework supporting concrete shall be removed or wedges loosened without the
 consent of the Engineer.
 If adequate test cylinders have been made, falsework may be removed when the
 cylinders indicate that the concrete has developed a minimum compressive strength of 2400
 psi {17 MPa}, otherwise falsework shall be removed according to the following time
 limitations.
 Falsework may be removed after expiration of 14 days exclusive of days when for four
 hours or more the temperature is below 40 °F {5 °C}. Falsework under slabs of less than 6
 foot {2 m} span may be removed after seven days with the same temperature limitations.
 Falsework shall be gradually and uniformly released in such a manner as to avoid
 injurious stresses in any part of the structure. Wedges shall be removed first under slabs and
 transverse beams, starting at the center of the span and working both ways; then wedges
 under longitudinal girders and beams shall be removed also starting at the center of the span
 and working both ways simultaneously.
 All falsework piles, at the time of removal or cleanup, shall be pulled out or cut off at an
 elevation not more than 6 inches {150 mm} above the bed of the stream. Piles not in water
 shall be removed or cut off flush with or below the ground surface of stream bed. Piles within
 roadbed limits shall be cut off at least 3 feet {1 m} below subgrade elevation. Other piles
 within roadway limits shall be cut off at least 12 inches {300 mm} below the finished surface
 of the front slope, ditch, or backslope.
 
 (j) Curing Concrete.
 1. Exposed Surfaces.
 Whenever the Engineer determines that weather conditions are such that evaporation
 from the surface may cause shrinkage cracking, a fog or mist spray may be required at
 intervals as needed during and after finishing until curing material can be applied so that the
 surface will be at all times damp but not excessively wet.
 The Contractor shall give careful attention to the proper curing of the concrete. All
 surfaces not covered by forms shall be protected with an approved membrane curing
 compound, from List II-30 of the MSDSAR manual, dampened burlap, Polyethylene Film*
 (White Opaque), White Burlap -Polyethylene Sheet*, cotton mats, or wetted sand, as soon
 after placing the concrete as possible without marring the surface, except for bridge deck
 slabs which shall be treated as noted in Item 2 below. Immediately upon removal of forms,
 other surfaces shall be treated by one of the approved curing methods.
 Unless membrane curing compound is used, all curing materials shall be kept wet and
 shall remain in place for seven days, except that small portions may be temporarily removed
 during actual finishing operations.
 *Note: When polyethylene film or white burlap-polyethylene sheeting is used, it shall be
 installed and maintained in such a manner that a complete, moisture-tight
 enclosure over the surface to be cured will be provided. These materials shall
 meet the requirements noted in Section 830.
 2. Bridge Deck Slabs.
 a. General.
 Prior to placing a bridge deck slab, the evaporation rate shall be determined by use
 of the graph in Figure 1, “Evaporation Rate of Surface Moisture”, and recorded on form
 BMT-171, “Evaporation Rate Record”. The Contractor shall furnish the equipment
 necessary to measure the air temperature (ambient), wind velocity, and humidity. The
 equipment or a manufacturer's certificate of calibration showing the equipment’s model
 number and serial number shall be submitted to the Area Materials Engineer no less than
 295
 
 SECTION 501
 STRUCTURAL PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 14 days prior to their use. The equipment shall consist of the following instruments with
 the following specifications.
 (1) Anemometer:
 Range – 0-25mph {0-40 km/hr}.
 Accuracy – plus or minus 1.5%.
 Units – U.S. Customary and Metric.
 (2) Hygrometer:
 Range – 10-95% relative humidity.
 Accuracy – plus or minus 1.5%.
 Units - U.S. Customary and Metric.
 Certified and traceable to N.I.S.T.
 (3) Thermometer:
 Range – 0-140 F {0-60 C}.
 Accuracy – plus or minus 2 F {plus or minus 1 C}
 Units - U.S. Customary and Metric.
 Combination instruments such as anemometer and thermometer or hygrometer and
 thermometer will be accepted provided they meet the above requirements.
 If the placement is expected to last more than two hours, the evaporation rate shall
 be checked and recorded on form BMT-171 at two-hour intervals or less. To prevent
 plastic shrinkage cracking, the expected evaporation rate shall not exceed 0.2 pounds
 per square foot per hour {1.0 kg/m2/hour}. When the evaporation rate exceeds this
 amount, the Contractor shall be required to effectively reduce the rate to within the
 allowable limits by taking one or more of the following actions:
 (1) Construct windbreaks or enclosures to effectively reduce the wind velocity
 throughout the area of placement.
 (2) Use fog sprayers or sprinklers upwind of the placement operation to effectively
 increase the relative humidity.
 (3) Reduce the temperature of the concrete.
 The Department will evaluate plastic shrinkage cracks that occur. Remedial
 measures shall be performed as directed by the Engineer. Plastic shrinkage cracks shall
 never be troweled over or filled with slurry.
 
 296
 
 SECTION 501
 STRUCTURAL PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 
 FIGURE 1.
 
 Evaporation Rate of Surface Moisture
 
 b. Evaporation Control After Screeding.
 Continuous fogging or an evaporation barrier (monomolecular) material shall be
 used for all bridge deck curing beginning immediately after the screeding operations
 have been completed for sections of the deck not to exceed five feet from the starting
 location.
 If fogging is to be used, a continuous fog or mist spray shall be maintained until the
 moist curing procedures described elsewhere in this Section begin. Intermittent fogging
 is not acceptable if there is drying of the concrete surface. If water begins to pond on
 the deck, the Contractor shall adjust the rate of fogging to minimize the ponding of
 water.
 297
 
 SECTION 501
 STRUCTURAL PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 If an evaporation barrier material is to be used, it shall be applied immediately
 behind the screeding operation and in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 recommendations. The entire top portion of the concrete slab shall be covered with the
 barrier material applied under pressure at a rate of one gallon {liter} to not more than
 200 square feet {5 m2} of fresh concrete. Application shall be done with an industrial
 type sprayer in such a manner as to cover the surface being treated with a uniform film.
 c. Moist Curing After Finishing.
 Immediately after the finishing operation, concrete bridge decks shall be moist
 cured for seven days by maintaining a moist condition for the entire curing period. This
 may be accomplished by one of the following methods:
 (1) Fog spraying or sprinkling with nozzles or sprinklers. When using this method,
 the Contractor shall maintain a complete and continuous moist condition of the
 concrete surface. Intermittent sprinkling is not acceptable. Care shall be taken
 that erosion of the surface does not occur.
 (2) Saturated burlap, saturated plastic coated burlap, or cotton mats. These curing
 materials shall be clean and free from any injurious substances that can cause
 deleterious effects to the concrete or cause discoloration. The burlap or cotton
 shall be completely saturated before being placed on the concrete and shall be
 maintained in that condition for the entire curing period. Should tears or holes
 appear in the mat sheets, they shall be repaired immediately. All edges of
 burlaps and mats shall extend at least 18 inches {450 mm} beyond the concrete
 surface. Where two individual sheets join, their edges shall overlap at least 12
 inches {300 mm}. All edges and overlaps shall be secured to ensure that the
 concrete surface is completely covered during the entire curing period. These
 curing materials shall be kept in contact with the concrete surface at all times.
 Alternate cycles of wetting and drying shall be avoided because this may result
 in pattern cracking.
 Prior to the start of the curing operation, the contractor shall have an approved
 curing system that ensures continuous moist curing of the concrete for 24 hours per day.
 If water or the chosen curing material stains or discolors concrete surfaces, which
 are permanently exposed, the contractor shall be responsible for cleaning the surfaces.
 When wooden forms are left in place during curing, they shall be kept wet at all times.
 If steel forms are used in hot weather, non-supporting vertical forms shall be broken
 loose from the concrete and curing water continually applied in this void. If the forms
 are removed before the end of the curing period, curing shall be carried out as on
 unformed surfaces.
 3. Protection of Concrete during Curing.
 Green concrete shall be protected against jarring or other movement that might cause
 damage. No traffic or other superimposed load will be permitted over bridges or culverts until
 the following criteria have been met:
 (1) Bridges - The concrete shall have reached a minimum 4000 psi {28 MPa} compressive
 strength as determined from test cylinders.
 (2) Culverts - The culvert concrete shall have reached a minimum of 4000 psi {28 MPa}
 compressive strength as determined from test cylinders or 28 days have passed
 since the last concrete was placed exclusive of days when for 4 hours or more the
 temperature is below 40 °F {5 °C}.
 
 (k) Finishing Concrete.
 1. General.
 The details set forth hereinafter in this Subarticle cover the requirements for the several
 classes of surface finishes which shall be applied to the various parts of concrete structures.
 These various classes of surface finishing will be used in accordance with the following:
 Class 1 - required on all concrete surfaces except wearing surfaces and surfaces placed
 in direct contact with natural ground or embankment.
 Class 2 - required on all exposed concrete surfaces within the requirements noted
 elsewhere in this Section unless another class is specified.
 298
 
 SECTION 501
 STRUCTURAL PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 Class 3 - may be used on designated bridge structures when specified by plan details.
 Wearing surface finish for bridge deck travelway shall be as specified in Subitem
 510.03(c)6.c. and for sidewalks as specified in Item 510.03(c)7.
 Exposed surfaces or sidewalks, driveways, curbs, and gutters shall have a textured finish
 obtained by the use of a burlap or cotton drag, brush, or broom so that a uniform gritty
 texture is obtained. Exposed surfaces of concrete flumes and slope paving shall have a float
 finish.
 2. Class 1 Finish (Ordinary Surface Finish).
 This class finish will require the concrete surface to be free from objectionable
 projections, swells, fins, ridges, depressions, waves, holes, and other defects. This will
 require that immediately after the forms are removed, metal ties shall be removed for a
 minimum depth of 1 inch {25 mm} from the face of the concrete. All cavities or depressions
 resulting from this removal, or from other causes, shall be carefully filled and pointed with a
 mortar of sand and cement, and the surface left smooth and even. The proportion of cement
 to sand, measured by volume, shall be one to two unless otherwise specified. The surface
 film of all pointed areas shall be carefully removed before setting occurs. Any fins, ridges, or
 projections shall be struck off smooth with the surface of the concrete. Particular care shall
 be taken throughout the progress of this operation to use one of the curing methods covered
 elsewhere in this Section.
 If a Coated Surface Finish is to be applied in a later finishing operation, the coating
 material may be used in lieu of mortar to fill small air holes in the concrete surface;
 however, this must be given time to take a set prior to applying the Coated Surface Finish.
 3. Class 2 Surface Finish.
 a. General.
 This class surface finish requires that, in addition to a Class 1 finish, the exposed
 surfaces of bridges, culverts, headwalls, inlets, etc. as defined in the Subitem d. below,
 receive an additional surface finish in accordance with the following:
 If only one brand and type of cement from the same mill is used in a structure or
 unit (substructure or superstructure), the Contractor may elect to either apply a Rubbed
 Surface Finish or apply an approved coated Surface Finish.
 If more than one brand of cement is used in a structure, the Contractor shall apply a
 Coated Surface Finish.
 The same type of surface finish shall be used throughout the entire structure unless
 otherwise authorized in writing by the Engineer.
 b. Rubbed Surface Finish.
 As soon as the Class 1 surface finish has been completed and the pointing has set
 sufficiently to permit it, the entire surface except chamfers shall be wetted with a brush
 and rubbed with a No. 16 carborundum stone or an abrasive of equal quality, bringing
 the surface to a paste. The rubbing shall be continued sufficiently to remove all form
 marks and projections, producing a smooth dense surface without pits or irregularities.
 The material, which in the above process has been ground to a paste, shall then be
 carefully spread or brushed uniformly over the entire surface and allowed to take a
 reset. Curing shall continue on this surface as noted to be required elsewhere in this
 Section.
 The final finish shall be obtained by a complete rubbing with a No. 30 carborundum
 stone or an abrasive of equal quality. This rubbing shall continue until the entire surface
 is of a smooth texture and uniform in color.
 c. Coated Surface Finish.
 Only Departmental approved coated finishing materials may be used. The coating
 material shall be one of the coating materials shown on List III-3, "Surface Coatings for
 Portland Cement Concrete". This list is given in the Department’s Manual, “Materials,
 Sources, and Devices with Special Acceptance Requirements”.
 The application of the coating shall be in an approved manner (normally in
 accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations) by competent and experienced
 personnel. The overall coated finish shall be uniform in coverage, texture, and color
 after the coating material has taken set and cured. Failure to obtain uniformity of
 299
 
 SECTION 501
 STRUCTURAL PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 coverage, texture, and color shall be cause for the Engineer to require such remedial
 action as deemed necessary to obtain the desired results.
 The following actions shall be taken before the application of any coated finish:
 A Class 1 surface finish shall be applied and all pointing completely set.
 Surface shall be cleaned and free from foreign matter.
 If membrane curing compound was used to cure the concrete, the curing compound
 shall have weathered for a minimum time period of six weeks. Special care shall be
 taken to ensure that areas not to be treated are protected to prevent treatment from
 overlapping onto these designated areas.
 d. Exposed Surfaces.
 Exposed surfaces for this class finish is defined as all surfaces, including bottom
 chamfers and fillets except (1) the wearing surface of roadway slabs and sidewalks, (2)
 those surfaces having immediate contact with embankment or excavation, (3) those
 surfaces below low water level and/or below newly established ground line after
 backfilling excavation or excavated channels, (4) underside and interior faces of girders,
 beams, and slabs, and underside of sidewalks where the edge beam extends 3 inches {75
 mm} or more below the bottom of the sidewalks, (5) top and bottom surfaces of all type
 caps, and (6) those parts of minor structures, box culverts, and bridge culverts that are
 not readily visible from a travelway.
 4. Class 3 Surface Finish.
 This class surface finish requires that, in addition to the Class 1 surface finish, only the
 designated exposed surfaces of a bridge structure noted below be given an additional finish of
 either a rubbed or coated finish in accordance with the requirements given elsewhere in this
 Section.
 Exposed surfaces shall be defined as the inside, top, and outside surfaces of barrier rail
 to bottom of slab overhang, and all portions of the bridge abutments outside the edge of the
 exterior girders that are not in immediate contact with embankment or excavation. All other
 structure surfaces, exposed and unexposed, shall receive a Class 1 finish immediately after
 the forms are removed.
 
 (l) Concrete for Precast Non-Prestressed and Prestressed Members.
 Concrete for precasting shall meet the requirements given in this Section unless amended by
 concrete requirements given in other Sections.
 Additional requirements are given in Section 512 and ALDOT-367 for the concrete required
 for precast non-prestressed concrete bridge members. Additional requirements are given in
 Section 513 and ALDOT-367 for the concrete required for precast prestressed concrete bridge
 members.
 
 501.04 Inspection.
 (a) General.
 The Contractor shall give the Engineer sufficient advance notice before starting to place
 concrete in any section of a structure to permit the inspection of forms, placing of steel
 reinforcements, and of preparation for placing. Any defective falsework or forming shall be
 corrected, or removed and replaced as necessary to the satisfaction of the Engineer, all at the
 expense of the Contractor.
 Authorization of the Engineer shall be secured before concrete is placed in any portion of a
 structure. Any concrete placed in violation of this provision, or in the absence of the Inspector,
 shall be removed and replaced at no additional cost to the State.
 
 (b) Removable Forms.
 After the forms have been removed, any defective work discovered shall be removed and
 replaced in a satisfactory manner. If the surface of the concrete is bulged, sagged, uneven, or
 honeycombed to such an extent that it cannot be satisfactorily repaired, the entire section shall
 be removed and replaced, at no additional cost to the State.
 
 (c) Stay In Place Steel Forms.
 After the deck concrete has been in place for a minimum period of two days, the concrete, if
 deemed necessary by the Engineer, shall be tested for soundness and bonding of the forms by
 sounding with a hammer as directed by the Engineer. The number and locations of the forms to be
 300
 
 SECTION 501
 STRUCTURAL PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 tested shall be as selected by the Engineer. If areas of doubtful soundness are disclosed by this
 procedure, the Contractor will be required to remove the forms from such areas for visual
 inspection after the concrete has attained a minimum compressive strength of 2400 psi {17 MPa}.
 Care shall be exercised to distinguish the sound of broken bond from the sound of defective
 concrete.
 At locations where sections of the forms are removed, the Contractor will not be required to
 replace the forms, but the adjacent metal forms and supports shall be repaired to present a neat
 appearance and assure their satisfactory retention. As soon as the forms are removed, the
 concrete surfaces will be examined for cavities, honeycombing, and other defects. If irregularities
 are found, and in the opinion of the Engineer these irregularities do not justify rejection of the
 work, the concrete shall be repaired as the Engineer may direct. If the concrete where the forms
 are removed is unsatisfactory, additional forms, as necessary, shall be removed to inspect and
 repair the slab, and the Contractor's methods of construction shall be modified as required to
 obtain satisfactory concrete in the slabs. All unsatisfactory concrete shall be removed or repaired
 as directed by the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall provide all facilities as are reasonably required for the safe and
 convenient conduct of the Engineer's inspection procedures. No additional compensation will be
 allowed the Contractor for compliance with the above inspection procedures.
 
 501.05 Acceptance of Concrete.
 (a) General.
 Certified Concrete Technicians, as required by the Department, shall perform all concrete
 inspections and testing. Procedures for technician certifications and laboratory qualifications are
 described in ALDOT-405, "Certification and Qualification Program for Concrete Technicians and
 Concrete Laboratories".
 Fresh concrete will be accepted on the basis of slump, total air content, and temperature
 meeting the requirements specified for the Class of concrete.
 Hardened concrete shall be accepted on the basis of compressive strength meeting the
 requirements specified in Item 501.02(c)2 for that Class of concrete.
 Compressive strength from concrete cylinders will be accepted when the average of two
 consecutive cylinder test results, obtained at the same age, equals or exceeds the specified 28day compressive strength, and neither cylinder test result is below 95% of the specified 28-day
 compressive strength.
 
 (b) Substandard Concrete.
 1. General.
 The Department will investigate any concrete not meeting the acceptance requirements
 outlined in Subarticle 501.05(a). Concrete investigations will be used to determine the
 suitability of potentially substandard concrete. This investigation may include any or all of
 the procedures outlined in ALDOT-170.
 The combined results of the Department’s investigations will be used to assess the
 acceptability or rejection of potentially substandard concrete.
 If the investigation results show that the concrete fails to meet the contract
 requirements, the Contractor shall be responsible for the cost of the investigation to include,
 but not limited, to per-diem, travel expenses, and sampling and testing.
 2. In-Place Compressive Strength.
 If the Department deems it necessary to evaluate only the in-place compressive strength
 of substandard concrete, a core investigation as described in ALDOT-170 will be performed.
 Price adjustments will be applied to the applicable pay item for the number of cubic
 yards represented by the low cylinder breaks and will be determined as follows.
 If the average compressive strength of the cores is equal to or greater than 100% of the
 specified 28-day compressive strength, the concrete will be accepted with no price
 adjustment.
 If the average compressive strength of the cores is 85% or greater but less than 100% of
 the specified 28-day compressive strength, and the Bridge Engineer deems the concrete to be
 structurally acceptable, the concrete will be accepted with a price adjustment. The price

 Reinforcing bars shall be butt spliced only when shown on the plans. The butt splice shall
 be a mechanical coupling splice.
 The mechanical coupling shall be made with a coupler that can develop, in tension, at
 least 125 percent of the specified yield strength (fy) of the bar. The Contractor shall prepare
 three test splices using the proposed method of splicing and reinforcing bars obtained from
 the supplier of the reinforcing steel. These test splices and two unspliced bars will be tested
 by the Alabama Department of Transportation's Bureau of Materials and Tests. The tension
 tests will be performed on full cross section specimens in accordance with ASTM E 8 {E 8M},
 using a gage length that spans the extremities of the connector. Complete details of the
 mechanical splice and the methods and equipment proposed for use in making the splice shall
 be submitted to the Department for approval.
 
 502.04 Method of Measurement.
 (a) Lump Sum Unit Measurement.
 The steel reinforcement required for a bridge superstructure will be measured for payment as
 a lump sum unit.
 
 (b) Theoretical Unit Weight {Mass} Measurement.
 The theoretical unit weight {mass} in pounds {kilograms} shall be used as the method of
 measurement for steel reinforcement where no other method of measurement is given for
 payment purposes. The weight {mass} of steel paid for shall be the number of pounds {kilograms}
 of steel, acceptably placed as shown to be required on the plans or as directed by the Engineer.

 SECTION 503
 STRUCTURE FOUNDATIONS
 
 SECTION 503
 STRUCTURE FOUNDATIONS
 503.01 Description.
 The work under this Section shall cover preparing foundations for bridges, box culverts and other
 miscellaneous structures.
 These foundations shall be built in accordance with the details shown on the plans and the
 provisions providedin this Section.
 
 503.02 Materials.
 Materials used in the work required under this Section shall conform to the applicable
 requirements provided elsewhere in these Specifications.
 
 503.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) General.
 In the construction of foundations, it is the intent that the foundations be constructed in the
 dry insofar as practical. Excavation shall be in accordance with Section 214 or 215, whichever is
 applicable.
 Where excavation is near a railroad track, the Contractor shall install such shoring and
 sheeting as deemed necessary by the Engineer and the Chief Engineer of the railroad company
 involved. Provisions of Article 107.08 shall govern.
 Where the excavation is near a building, utility or other property, the Contractor shall install
 shoring and sheeting and perform such other work as shown on the plans for proper protection of
 the property, and, in addition, shall comply fully with the requirements of Article 107.12
 regarding protection of property.
 
 (b) Depth and Size of Footings.
 The elevation of the bottoms of footings, as shown on the plans, shall be considered as
 approximate only and the Engineer may order, in writing, such changes in dimensions or elevations
 of footings as may be necessary to secure a satisfactory foundation.
 
 (c) Preparation of Foundations for Footings.
 1. General.
 All rock or other hard foundation material shall be freed from all loose material, cleaned
 and cut to a firm surface, either level, stepped, or roughened, as may be directed by the
 Engineer.
 Where seams, voids, cracks, or crevices exist, they shall be cleaned out and filled as
 directed by the Engineer. In rock, the openings shall be filled with subfooting concrete (Class
 A concrete) if the concrete can be placed in the dry. (Refer to Articles 503.04 and 503.05
 concerning measurement and payment.) If the concrete cannot be placed in the dry, the
 Contractor shall propose a method for filling the openings for review and approval by the
 Engineer. In hard, dry material other than rock, the Engineer may allow the use of Item
 214-B, Foundation Backfill, or direct the use of subfooting concrete.
 When the footing is to rest on an excavated surface other than rock, special care shall be
 taken not to disturb the bottom of the excavation and the final removal of the foundation
 material to grade shall not be made until just before the footing is to be placed.
 2. Stable Material.
 Where rock or hard foundation material is available, excavation for the footing shall be
 to neat lines and the concrete poured against the excavated walls without forms, unless
 otherwise approved by the Engineer. Concrete used to replace rock or hard foundation
 material excavated outside of the neat lines will not be measured for payment.
 3. Unstable Material.
 If the material encountered at the elevation shown on the plans for the bottom of
 footing is of a soft and unstable nature lacking in the required bearing value, and tests show
 the existence of satisfactory material of sufficient thickness and bearing value at a depth of
 less than 10 feet {3 m} below the elevation shown on the plans for such footing, the Engineer
 
 306
 
 SECTION 503
 STRUCTURE FOUNDATIONS
 may order that the footing be lowered into the satisfactory material and/or that the
 dimensions of the footing be increased.
 4. Pile Footing.
 The excavation of each pit shall be completed before the piles are driven. After driving
 is completed, all loose and displaced material shall be so removed as to leave a smooth solid
 bed to receive the footing.
 5. Foundation Backfill.
 Foundation backfill shall be used as directed by the Engineer. Attention is directed to
 Section 214 or 215, whichever is applicable.
 6. Adjustment in Footings.
 The construction adjustments permitted above shall not be considered as materially
 altering the original plans and shall not be a waiver of any condition of the contract nor
 invalidate any of the provisions thereof.
 
 (d) Cofferdam and Pumping.
 1. General.
 In the construction of footings and substructures, the item of Cofferdam and Pumping
 shall be used on all piers or bents where so designated on the plans. Working drawings and
 computations shall be submitted in accordance with Article 105.02. Attention is directed to
 Section 215 for piers and bents not designated to receive the item of Cofferdam and
 Pumping.
 2. Details.
 Interlocking, steel sheet piling of 3/8 inch {9.5 mm} minimum web thickness shall be
 used in all cofferdam work. The tops of the cofferdams shall be well above the normal water
 stages and their bottoms shall be carried to a depth that will prevent flow of materials into
 the excavation. They shall be constructed in a substantial manner, capable of resisting earth,
 water or concrete without appreciable displacement, distortion or leakage. Interior clear
 dimensions of cofferdams shall be such as will provide sufficient clearance for construction
 and removal of forms and for a sump outside the footing where footings are to be poured in
 the dry. No excess excavation and seal concrete will be paid for where the Contractor elects
 to use an oversized cofferdam for his convenience.
 
 (e) Removal of Cofferdams.
 Cofferdams shall not be removed until after the substructure has been constructed above
 normal water elevation or above the ground lines, whichever is applicable, and after the Engineer
 has inspected the work. Care shall be taken in removing the temporary construction so as not to
 damage the footings and columns. Any damage as a result of the cofferdam removal shall be
 replaced or repaired without additional compensation from the Department. Cofferdam sheet
 piling shall remain permanently in-place and undisturbed if this is shown to be required on the
 plans.
 
 (f) Pumping.
 All substructure concrete shall be placed in the dry unless otherwise provided on the plans.
 Pumping during the placing of foundation concrete shall be done from a suitable sump separated
 from the concrete work and shall be so conducted that there will be no water currents inside the
 forms or inside the excavation if no forms are required. Pumping equipment shall in all cases be of
 ample capacity to keep the excavation practically free of water until all the concrete is in place.
 Water that originates in the footing area or that is necessary to come through or across the footing
 area shall be handled in approved pipes or conduits to the pump sump. Cofferdams shall be
 dewatered for inspection purposes without additional compensation when requested.
 
 (g) Seal Concrete.
 1. General.
 Seal concrete shall be used by the Contractor only when required by plan details as a
 structural footing or when directed by the Engineer in accordance with the following
 conditions. If the material encountered at the designed elevation of the bottom of the
 footing is so porous that water enters at such a rate that it is impractical to lower water level
 to this elevation by pumping, or if the material is so plastic that it cannot be prevented from
 flowing into the excavation by driving sheeting to reasonable depths, the Engineer may
 307
 
 SECTION 503
 STRUCTURE FOUNDATIONS
 require the Contractor to seal the cofferdam with concrete. The seal concrete shall be placed
 in the manner prescribed in Section 501. After placement of seal concrete, the cofferdam
 shall not be dewatered for seven days or until concrete has, by test, indicated a compression
 strength of 2000 psi {14 MPa}. Immediately prior to placing seal concrete on a rock surface,
 the footing floor shall be cleaned by airlift or other acceptable methods. After cleaning, any
 mud, silt, etc., which is impossible to remove shall be agitated by means of compressed air
 jet so that this material will be suspended in the water during the placing of seal concrete.
 All footings which are to receive seal concrete, except pile footings, will require an
 underwater inspection by the Department prior to placing the seal unless approved otherwise
 by the Engineer. The Contractor shall give at least a 48 hour notice prior to the need for an
 underwater inspection. The Contractor shall provide transportation to the cofferdam cell and
 a work station for the diver and his equipment. If the footing floor is found to be
 unacceptable another underwater inspection will be required after corrections are made.
 2. Core Drilling of Seal Concrete Footings.
 Pile footings will not be required to be cored unless noted otherwise on the plans or
 ordered by the Engineer. All other seal concrete footings shall be cored in accordance with
 the following procedure.
 Cores shall be taken by the Contractor for use by the Engineer in determining the quality
 of the seal concrete. Two cores shall be taken if only one tremie pipe is used for the
 placement of the seal concrete in the footing. Four cores shall be taken if more than one
 tremie pipe is used for the placement of the seal concrete in the footing.
 After dewatering the cofferdam, the Engineer will inform the Contractor of the location
 of holes to be cored in the seal concrete in each footing to determine its quality. An accurate
 log of cores shall be kept and the cores shall be placed in a crate and properly marked
 showing the footing depth and elevation at each interval of core recovery. The cores, along
 with three copies of the coring logs, shall be transported undisturbed to the Materials & Tests
 Bureau, Montgomery, Alabama, for inspection. No further concrete shall be poured inside the
 cofferdam until approval is received from the Construction Bureau.
 Because it is necessary to obtain a high percentage of core recovery for visual inspection
 and compressive strength testing, the core bit used for core drilling shall be warranted by the
 manufacturer to be capable of coring the strength of concrete in the seal footing. The
 Engineer may require a new bit or replacement of the core barrel at any time inspection
 indicates that the equipment is incapable of coring as required. The minimum core diameter
 shall be 3.0 inches {76 mm}.
 If the quality of the seal concrete footing is determined to be unacceptable the Engineer
 may require the drilling of additional cores without compensation, If the seal concrete is
 unacceptable the Contractor shall construct another foundation or perform corrective work as
 required by the Department. This foundation or the corrective work shall be constructed
 without compensation from the Department. The details of the replacement foundation shall
 be submitted in accordance with the requirements given in Article 105.02 for Working
 Drawings.
 Unless otherwise directed by the Engineer, all footings shall be cored to a point 6 inches
 {150 mm} above the bottom of the seal concrete footing.
 
 (h) Class of Concrete.
 The class of concrete required for the specific type of work involved shall be in accordance
 with the provisions of Section 501.
 
 (i) Construction Joints.
 In general, each footing shall be constructed as a monolith. If construction joints are
 required, they shall be constructed as provided in Section 501.
 
 (j) Finish.
 Concrete surfaces shall be finished in accordance with the provisions of Section 501 for Class
 1 with exposed surfaces receiving a Class 2 finish unless otherwise specified by the proposal or by
 plan requirements.
 
 308
 
 SECTION 503
 STRUCTURE FOUNDATIONS
 
 503.04 Method of Measurement.
 (a) Seal Concrete.
 The measurement of the volume of seal concrete in a footing shall be calculated from the
 following:
 L = Length of footing shown on contract plans (feet {meters});
 W = Width of footing shown on contract plans (feet {meters});
 T = Final approved elevation of the top of the seal footing (feet {meters});
 D = Final approved elevation of the bottom of the seal footing (feet {meters});
 Vs = Volume of seal concrete for which payment will be made (cubic yards {cubic
 meters}).
 Vs = L x W x ( T - D ) / 27
 {Vs = L x W x ( T - D )}
 Seal concrete outside of these limits of measurement may be required for the construction of
 a seal concrete footing, depending on the details of construction selected by the Contractor. No
 direct payment will be made for any seal concrete outside of the footing plan dimensions shown
 on the contract plans.
 
 (b) Cofferdam and Pumping.
 When items for cofferdam and pumping for individual piers or bents are provided by the plans
 and/or proposal, such will be measured in individual lump sum items for the pier or bent
 designated.
 
 (c) Excavation and Backfill.
 Excavation and backfill when provided by the plans, proposal, or directed will be measured
 and paid for under the applicable provisions of Sections 214 and 215.
 
 (d) Core Drilling.
 The actual depth of each core hole drilled at the location directed will be measured in feet
 {meters} to the nearest 0.1 of a foot {meter}.
 
 (e) Subfooting Concrete.
 Concrete ordered and accepted for filling voids, cracks, and crevices, as required in Item
 503.03(c)1, will be measured by the cubic yard {cubic meter} delivered to the work site and
 acceptably placed, minus any concrete wasted.
 
 503.05 Basis of Payment.
 (a) Unit Price Coverage.
 1. Seal Concrete.
 Accepted seal concrete, used as directed and measured as noted above, will be paid at
 the contract price, which shall be full compensation for the concrete complete in place
 exclusive of reinforcing steel.
 2. Cofferdam and Pumping.
 When Cofferdam and Pumping has been provided for a designated pier or bent, the lump
 sum item shall be full compensation for the furnishing and installation of all material,
 dewatering, maintenance, removal, satisfactory clean up of the area, and for all tools,
 equipment, labor and incidentals necessary to complete the work.
 Partial payment after installation of cofferdam will be made based on the following:
 Cofferdam complete in place
 80%
 Excavation performed and columns poured to
 90%
 elevation above normal water elevation
 Cofferdam work complete and sheet piling removed
 100%
 3. Core Drilling.
 Payment for the length of core drilling shall be full compensation for all materials,
 equipment, tools, labor and incidentals necessary to complete the work.
 Should the quality of the concrete be questionable based on the first cores taken from
 the footing, the Engineer may order additional cores to be taken from the footing. All
 additional coring shall be at the Contractor's expense if the footing is determined to be
 unsatisfactory. If the footing is determined to be satisfactory, the cost of the additional
 coring will be paid for at the contract unit price bid per linear foot.

 The Engineer will make the final determination of whether the construction of a piling
 encasement should be done in either a wet or dry condition. An encasement must be constructed
 in the wet condition if the pile encasement site cannot be dewatered by pumps.
 The required lengths of encasement shown in the listing of quantities on the Plans are
 approximate. The actual required lengths of encasement may vary from the approximate lengths
 shown on the plans.
 The Contractor shall abide by the rules of navigation so as to permit the orderly passage of
 marine traffic at the site.
 The Contractor shall repair, without compensation, all damage done to the bridge due to
 performance of this work.
 The Contractor shall perform no work, except the pumping of the concrete, from the deck of
 the bridge.
 Forms shall not be removed until after the concrete has cured to a compressive strength of
 2500 psi {17 MPa}. All forms shall be completely removed to allow the inspection of the
 encasement. An unacceptable encasement shall be removed and replaced with an acceptable
 encasement without additional compensation.
 All materials at a work site (forms, old encasement materials, swaybracing, tools, equipment,
 etc.) that are not required as a permanent part of the bridge structure shall be removed.
 
 (b) Cleaning of Piling.
 All steel pile surfaces to be encased shall be thoroughly cleaned of all marine growth, heavy
 rust, foreign materials, oil, grease, dirt, etc. Cleaning may be done either by high pressure water
 jet (8700 psi {60MPa} or more) or by other mechanical methods approved by the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall repaint all sections of piling where paint was removed during cleaning.
 
 (c) Placement of Steel Reinforcement.
 All steel reinforcement shall be placed in accordance with plan details using non-metallic
 spacers to provide the required concrete cover over the reinforcing steel and pilings. All tie
 wiresshall be turned toward the pile.
 
 (d) Encasements Constructed in Wet Conditions.
 1. Underwater Inspection.
 The Department’s divers will inspect the encasement work. The inspection shall be as
 follows:
 • The Contractor shall complete all of the excavation, cleaning and placement of
 reinforcing steel for all of the encasements required for at least one Bent.
 • At the completion of all of the excavation, cleaning and placement of reinforcing
 steel for all of the encasements required for at least one Bent, the Contractor
 shall notify the Engineer of the need for an inspection.
 • The Contractor shall notify the Engineer, and the Engineer will notify the ALDOT
 Underwater Inspection Team Supervisor at least 48 hours prior to the need for the
 inspection.
 • The Department’s divers will also perform other inspections as needed and a final
 inspection of the completed encasement work.
 2. Placement of Concrete.
 The bottom of an encasement form shall be tightly sealed with epoxy mortar to prevent
 the concrete placed to fill a form from flowing out of the form. Care shall be taken to not
 block the bottom pumping port with the concrete or epoxy mortar seal at the bottom of a
 form.
 The filling of an encasement form shall be done by pumping concrete through ports
 installed on the form. Lubricating agents placed in a pump hose shall not be pumped into an
 encasement form. The concrete shall be pumped until undiluted concrete is present in all
 areas of the encasement.
 
 311
 
 SECTION 505
 PILING
 
 (e) Encasements Constructed in Dry Conditions.
 The filling of an encasement form may be done by pumping concrete through ports installed
 on the form or by tremie. Lubricating agents placed in a pump hose shall not be pumped into an
 encasement form.
 
 504.04 Method of Measurement.
 The quantity of steel piling encasement measured for payment will be the total linear feet
 {meters} of encasement, measured to the nearest tenth of a foot {meter}, from the top of the
 encasement to the bottom, including any partial encasement where existing concrete is covered.
 
 504.05 Basis of Payment.
 (a) Unit Price Coverage.
 Accepted steel piling encasement, measured as noted above, will be paid for at the contract
 unit price bid per linear foot {meter} of encasement. This bid price shall include the cost of the
 cleaning and scarifying or partial removal of steel piling encasements, pile cleaning, excavation,
 concrete, reinforcement steel, forming, labor, equipment, tools, and incidentals necessary to
 complete the work.
 
 (b) Payment will be made under Item No.:

 SECTION 505
 PILING
 505.01 Description.
 This Section shall cover the work of furnishing and driving foundation piles of the type and
 dimensions designated including cutting off or building up foundation piles, when required. Piling shall
 be furnished and installed in accordance with the requirements given in these specifications at the
 location, tip elevation, penetration and/or bearing shown on the plans or as directed by the Engineer.
 
 505.02 Materials.
 All materials shall meet the requirements specified in applicable portions of Section 834, Piling.
 
 505.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) Hammers for Driving Piles.
 1. General.
 Piles shall be driven with air, steam, diesel and hydraulic hammers with the exception
 that prestressed concrete piles 20 inches {510 mm} and larger shall not be driven with diesel
 hammers unless approved by the Engineer. All hammers shall be furnished with a means for
 adjusting the amount of energy that is delivered to the pile.
 Gravity hammers will be allowed if approved in writing by the Engineer.
 2. Gravity Hammers.
 When gravity hammers are permitted, the ram shall weigh between 3000 and 4000
 pounds {have a mass between 1360 kg and 1815 kg} and the height of drop shall not exceed
 10 feet {3 m}.All gravity hammers shall be equipped with hammer guides to insure
 concentric impact on the drive head.
 3. Steam and Air Hammers.
 The plant and equipment furnished for steam and air hammers shall have sufficient
 capacity to maintain, under working conditions, the volume and pressure specified by the
 manufacturer of the hammer. The plant and equipment shall be equipped with accurate
 pressure gages which are easily accessible to the Engineer. The weight {mass} of the striking
 parts of air and steam hammers shall not be less than 1/3 the weight {mass} of the drive head
 and pile being driven, and in no case shall the striking parts weigh {have a mass} less than
 2750 pounds {1250 kg}.
 4. Diesel Hammers.
 312
 
 SECTION 505
 PILING
 Open-end (single acting) diesel hammers shall be equipped with a device such as rings on
 the ram or a scale (jump stick) extending above the ram cylinder to permit the Engineer to
 visually determine hammer stroke at all times during pile driving operations. Closed-end
 (double acting) diesel hammers shall be equipped with a bounce chamber pressure gauge in
 proper working order, mounted near ground level so as to be easily read by the Engineer.
 5. Hydraulic Hammers.
 Hydraulic hammers shall have a built-in monitoring system which determines the ram
 velocity just before impact. The contractor shall verify that the correct ram weight is
 entered in the monitoring system.
 
 (b) Driving Appurtenancies.
 1. Blow Count Monitoring Equipment.
 Equipment shall be furnished by the Contractor for displaying the blow count rate and
 stroke height during driving with all hammers except gravity and double acting hammers. This
 equipment shall be operated at ground level to allow the Engineer to monitor the blow count
 rate.
 2. Hammer Cushion.
 Where required by the hammer manufacturer, impact pile driving equipment, except
 gravity hammers, shall be equipped with a suitable thickness of hammer cushion material to
 prevent damage to the hammer or pile and to insure uniform driving behavior. Hammer
 cushions shall be made of durable, manufactured materials, provided in accordance with the
 hammer manufacturer’s guidelines except that all wood, wire rope, and asbestos hammer
 cushions are specifically disallowed and shall not be used. A striker plate, as recommended
 by the hammer manufacturer, shall be placed on the hammer cushion to insure uniform
 compression of the cushion material. The hammer cushion shall be inspected in the presence
 of the Engineer when beginning pile driving at each structure and after each 100 hours of pile
 driving. A hammer cushion whose thickness has been reduced to less than 75 percent of the
 original thickness shall be replaced by the Contractor before driving is permitted to continue.
 3. Pile Drive Head.
 Piles driven with impact hammers require an adequate drivehead to distribute the
 hammer blow to the pile head. The drive head shall be axially aligned with the hammer and
 the pile. The drive head shall be guided by the leads and not be free-swinging. The drive
 head shall fit around the pile head in such a manner as to prevent transfer of torsional forces
 during driving while maintaining proper alignment of hammer and pile.
 For steel piling, the pile heads shall be cut squarely and a drive head, as recommended
 by the hammer manufacturer, shall be provided to hold the axis of the pile in line with the
 axis of the hammer.
 For prestressed concrete piles, the pile head shall be plane and perpendicular to the
 longitudinal axis of the pile to prevent eccentric impacts from the drive head.
 For special types of piles, appropriate driving heads, mandrels or other devices shall be
 provided in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations so that the piles may be
 driven without damage.
 4. Pile Cushion.
 A concrete pile’s head shall be protected by a wooden pile cushion. The minimum
 thickness placed on the pile head prior to driving shall not be less than 4 inches {100 mm}. A
 new pile cushion shall be provided for each pile. In addition the pile cushion shall be replaced
 if during the driving of any pile, the cushion is either compressed more than one-half the
 original thickness or begins to burn to the extent that flame is visible. The pile cushion
 dimensions shall equal or exceed the cross sectional area of the pile top, and shall be
 appropriately sized to fit the dimensions of the pile cap.
 5. Leads.
 Piles shall be supported in line and position with leads while being driven. Pile driver
 leads shall be constructed in a manner that affords freedom of movement of the hammer
 while maintaining alignment of the hammer and the pile to insure concentric impact for each
 blow. Leads may be either fixed or swinging type. Swinging leads, when used, shall be fitted
 with a pile gate at the bottom of the leads. The pile section being driven shall not extend
 above the leads. The leads shall be adequately embedded in the ground or the pile
 313
 
 SECTION 505
 PILING
 constrained in a structural frame such as a template to maintain alignment. The leads shall
 be of sufficient length to make the use of a follower unnecessary and shall be so designed as
 to permit proper alignment of batter piles.
 
 (c) Driving Aids.
 1. General.
 Driving aids such as jets, pilot holes and followers shall not be used unless either
 specifically permitted in writing by the Engineer or stated in the contract documents. When
 permitted, driving aids shall be used for installing production piles only after the pile tip
 elevation for safe support of the pile load is established by load testing and/or test piles
 driven with the same aids and methods. The Contractor shall perform, at his cost, any extra
 load tests and/or extra work required to drive test piles as determined by the Engineer as a
 condition of approval of the driving aids.
 2. Jetting.
 Jetting shall only be permitted if approved in writing by the Engineer or when
 specifically stated in the contract documents. The Contractor shall determine the number of
 jets and the volume and pressure of water at the jet nozzles necessary to freely erode the
 material adjacent to the pile without affecting the lateral stability of the final in-place pile.
 The jetting plant shall have sufficient capacity to permit installation to the required
 elevation, location, and alignment within specification tolerances. The Contractor shall
 decide when jetting should be discontinued above the prescribed tip elevation so that the
 pile will attain the required capacity at the required tip elevation established in the plans
 when driven with the approved hammer.
 The Contractor shall control, treat if necessary, and dispose of all jet water in a manner
 satisfactory to the Engineer and in compliance with all regulatory guidelines.
 Upon completion of jetting a pile, any voids around the pile shall be filled with clean
 sand and saturated with water (unless driven under water). The Contractor shall be
 responsible for all damage to the site caused by unapproved or improper jetting operations.
 When driving concrete piles, if 240 blows per foot {300 mm} (20 blows per inch {25 mm})
 is reached before the concrete pile reaches the required minimum tip elevation, then jetting
 may be used, when approved in writing by the Engineer, to facilitate the advancement of the
 concrete pile. Jetting shall be performed in a manner that allows the pile to continue on the
 previously established linear path of advancement by eroding the material adjacent to the
 concrete pile. Jetting a concrete pile may be done through internal pipes cast in the pile.
 Internal jet pipes shall be steel pipes for a pile that is solid concrete for the full length of the
 pile. Internal jet pipes shall be either steel or PVC for a pile that is cast with a void in the
 interior of the pile.
 Once driving of the concrete pile resumes, the lowest stroke of the hammer shall be
 used until the Contractor and Engineer are satisfied that the original driving resistance has
 resumed. Under no circumstances shall driving and jetting concrete piling be allowed
 simultaneously.
 3. Pilot Holes.
 Augering, wet-rotary drilling or other methods of boring pilot holes shall be used only
 when approved by the Engineer or shown on the plans. When permitted, such procedures
 shall be carried out in a manner which will not impair the load bearing capacity of the piles
 already in place or the safety of existing adjacent structures. Pilot holes shall be of a size
 smaller than the diameter or diagonal of the pile cross section that is sufficient to allow
 penetration of the pile to the specified depth. If subsurface obstructions, such as boulders or
 rock layers are encountered, the hole diameter may be increased to the least dimension
 which is adequate for pile installation. The use of spuds, a short strong driven member which
 is removed to make a hole for inserting a pile, shall not be permitted in lieu of pilot holes.
 After a pile is placed in a pilot hole the voids around the pile shall be filled with clean
 sand before the pile is driven. After driving, additional sand shall be added to the hole to fill
 the voids left by the settlement of the sand during driving. Water shall then be added to the
 hole to saturate the final placement of sand. Pilot holes that terminate in rock shall be
 backfilled to the top of the rock with substructure concrete after seating the pile. The
 remainder of the hole may be filled with either sand or concrete.
 314
 
 SECTION 505
 PILING
 The Contractor shall decide when the pilot hole will be terminated above the prescribed
 tip elevation so that the pile will attain the required bearing capacity at the required tip
 elevation established in the plans when driven with the approved hammer. Where piles are to
 be end-bearing on rock or hardpan, pilot holes may be carried to the surface of the rock or
 hardpan unless otherwise noted on the plans. The piles shall then be driven with an impact
 hammer to insure proper seating.
 If the Engineer determines that pre-excavation has disturbed the load bearing capacities
 of previously installed piles, those piles that have been disturbed shall be restored to
 conditions meeting the requirements of this specification by redriving or by other methods
 acceptable to the Engineer. Redriving or other remedial measures shall be instituted after
 pilot hole excavation operations in the area have been completed. The Contractor shall be
 responsible for the costs of any necessary remedial measures unless the pilot hole excavation
 method was specifically included in the contract documents and properly executed by the
 Contractor.
 4. Followers.
 Followers shall only be used when approved in writing by the Engineer or when
 specifically stated in the contract documents. In cases where a follower is permitted, the
 first pile in each bent and every tenth pile driven thereafter shall be driven full length,
 without a follower, to verify that adequate pile length is being attained to develop the
 desired pile capacity. The follower and pile shall be held and maintained in equal and proper
 alignment during driving. The follower shall be of such material and dimensions to permit the
 piles to be driven to the length determined necessary from the driving of the full-length piles.
 The final position and alignment of the first two piles installed with followers in each
 substructure unit shall be verified to be in accordance with the location tolerances given in
 this Section before additional piles are installed.
 
 (d) Approval of Pile Driving Hammer.
 1. General.
 The Contractor shall submit proposed pile driving equipment data for evaluation no less
 that 30 calendar days prior to the date that the equipment is proposed for use. This data shall
 be submitted to allow the Materials & Tests Engineer to evaluate the proposed driving
 equipment. The Contractor shall send the submittal directly to the Materials and Tests
 Engineer. The Contractor shall also send a copy of the submittal to the Engineer (Project
 Manager) at the same time that the submittal is sent to the Materials and Tests Engineer. The
 proposed driving equipment submittal shall be:
 - Pile hammer operator's manuals from the hammer manufacturers.
 - Completed Pile and Driving Equipment Data Form (Form C-14) for each proposed
 hammer.
 - Charts from the hammer manufacturers shall be submitted with the data form for
 diesel hammers. For single acting diesel hammers, data equating stroke, blows per
 minute, and potential energy shall be shown on the charts. For double acting diesel
 hammers, data equating bounce chamber pressure to either equivalent energy or
 stroke of the hammer shall be shown on the charts. The measurements required for
 the calibration data shown on the charts for double acting diesel hammers shall have
 been made no more than 90 calendar days prior to the beginning of the driving of the
 piles.
 - If more than one hammer is submitted to drive the same size piling, the hammers
 shall be prioritized in the order of probable use.
 Initial approval of pile driving equipment will be given by the Materials & Tests Engineer
 after an evaluation (usually a wave equation analysis) of the pile driving equipment data.
 Final approval will be based on the satisfactory performance of the equipment and successful
 installation of representative test piles. The representative test pile shall be the first
 production pile if payment for a test pile is not included in the contract. The pile driving
 equipment shall not be used until approval of the Engineer (Project Manager) has been given
 in writing.
 Pile driving equipment shall be maintained in proper working condition and shall be sized
 so that the piles are driven with reasonable effort to the required penetration without
 damage.
 315
 
 SECTION 505
 PILING
 Any change in the driving system will only be considered after the Contractor has
 submitted a revised Pile and Equipment Data Form for a revised wave equation analysis. The
 Engineer will notify the Contractor of the acceptance or rejection of the revised driving
 system within 7 calendar days of receipt of a revised Pile and Driving Equipment Data Form.
 The time required for submission, review, and approval of a revised driving system shall not
 constitute the basis for a contract time extension to the Contractor.
 2. Wave Equation Analysis Program (WEAP).
 The Department, or the Consultant Engineer provided by the Department, will perform
 all WEAP analyses for each pile driving hammer that the contractor may propose to use. The
 Department will use the information provided by the Contractor on the Pile and Driving
 Equipment Data Form to run a wave equation analysis. A Pile and Driving Equipment Data
 Form will be included in the contract documents or supplied by the Engineer.
 The hammer shall be capable of driving the pile to the required tip elevation with a
 blowcount of less than 240 BPF {blows per 300 mm}. The tensile and compressive driving
 stresses shall be less than the following maximum values:
 Pile Type
 Maximum Allowable Compressive Stress
 Maximum Allowable Tensile Stress
 Steel
 0.90 Fy
 0.90 Fy
 Prestressed
 (3 times the square root of f'c) +
 0.85 f'c – (effective prestress).
 Concrete
 effective prestress
 The effective prestress may be obtained from the approved shop drawings.
 If the hammer is approved, a blow count/bearing capacity graph with an acceptance
 criteria will be provided. The blowcount and hammer stroke required to achieve the required
 minimum bearing capacity (equal to twice the design load) will be given with the blow
 count/bearing capacity graph.
 During pile driving operations, the Contractor shall use the system submitted and
 reviewed by the Department. The submitted hammer must successfully install test piles. If
 the hammer does not successfully install the representative piles, the Engineer will require
 the Contractor to repair that hammer or submit another pile driving hammer with the
 analyses as outlined above. No variations in the driving system will be permitted without
 notifying the Engineer in writing, with the exception of increasing the pile cushion thickness
 and reducing the energy delivered to the pile to control driving stresses. Any changes in the
 driving system will only be considered after the Contractor has submitted a revised Pile and
 Driving Equipment Data Form. If changes are made to the driving system, the Contractor shall
 perform a load test at no additional cost to the Department unless this requirement is waived
 by the Materials & Tests Engineer.
 In such cases where a WEAP analysis can not be performed, a dynamic load test will be
 required to verify that the pile driving hammer is capable of successfully installing a
 representative test or production pile to the required depth without damage.
 
 (e) Pile Driving Preparation
 1. Location and Alignment Tolerance.
 Piles shall be driven as nearly as possible in the exact position designated; however, a
 maximum deviation of 1.5 inches {40 mm} from exact position will be permissible in pile
 trestle bents and pile abutments, and a maximum deviation of 3 inches {75 mm} from exact
 position will be allowed for a foundation pile in footings of piers or abutments. Care shall be
 taken during driving to prevent and correct any tendency of concrete or steel piles to twist or
 rotate. Footings and encasements shall be formed around the piles to give at least the
 minimum concrete cover shown on the plans. Piles that are to be swaybraced shall be aligned
 as necessary so that swaybracing can be properly welded to the piles. After all piling in a
 bent are aligned within the specified tolerances, the bent cap shall be placed on the piles in
 exact position.
 If the location or alignment tolerances are exceeded, the error will be evaluated by the
 Bridge Engineer. The Engineer will require corrective work by either:
 - stipulating what will be required by the Bridge Engineer for the corrective work or;
 - requiring the submittal from the Contractor of proposed details and design
 calculations for the corrective work. The signature, seal, and date of signature shall
 be placed on all submittal details and design calculations by a Professional Engineer
 that is licensed in the State of Alabama and not employed by the ALDOT.
 316
 
 SECTION 505
 PILING
 Corrective work shall not be performed until allowed by the Engineer after the Bridge
 Engineer has either stipulated what will be required, or has approved the Contractor's
 proposed repair. There will be no payment for the cost of corrective work, including the costs
 of submittals and delay costs.
 2. Installation Sequence.
 The order of placing individual piles in pile groups shall be starting from the center of
 the group and proceeding outwards in both directions, unless an alternate installation
 sequence is approved by the Engineer. If starting the installation from the center and
 proceeding outwards cannot be done because of battered piles, the Contractor shall submit a
 proposed sequence of installation to the Engineer for approval.
 3. Inspection.
 The Project Manager shall be given 24 hour notice before the driving of any test pile or
 production pile. No pile shall be driven except in the presence of a Department Inspector. An
 accurate driving record will be kept by the Engineer on Form C-16. Each production pile
 driving record will be kept by the Engineer and entered into the Engineer’s daily log book.
 The Test Pile Driving Record Form C-15 will be completed by the Engineer each time a test
 pile is driven. This form includes the number of hammer blows per foot {300 mm} for the
 entire driven length, the driven length, cutoff elevation, penetration in ground, driving
 problems, significant time delays, whether or not the test pile was dynamically monitored
 and any other pertinent information obtained by the Engineer. If a redrive is necessary, the
 Engineer will record the number of hammer blows per inch {25 mm} of pile movement.
 
 (f) Pile Driving.
 1. General.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for driving piles with the approved equipment and in
 accordance with the procedures approved by the Engineer.
 2. Test and Production Piles.
 A representative test pile shall be driven in the designated location and loaded to verify
 the minimum bearing capacity. The minimum bearing capacity shall be verified by static
 testing methods. Correlation between static and dynamic test results will be required prior
 to using a dynamic test to verify minimum bearing capacity of other test and production
 piles. The correlation shall also consist of applying a dynamic restrike to the test pile within
 48 hours after completion of the static load test using the approved hammer system.
 The capacity determined by either test method is assumed to represent the minimum
 bearing capacity for each of the production piles that the test pile represents. A test pile
 represents a specific group of production piles that have the same size, design loading and
 site soil conditions. The test pile locations and the groups of production piles that each test
 pile represents will be shown on the plans.
 Test piles shall be driven at the locations shown on the plans unless the locations are
 changed in writing by the Materials & Tests Engineer. Unless otherwise directed, test piles
 shall be driven at such locations as will permit their use in the finished structure. In no case
 shall test piles driven out of permanent pile locations be pulled and redriven as production
 piles. Test piles specified to be used as permanent piles in a structure shall have sufficient
 length to be cut off at plan grade for top of pile. In general, the specified length of test piles
 will be greater than the estimated length of production piles in order to provide for variation
 in soil conditions. Precast concrete test piles shall be a minimum of 10 feet {3 m} longer than
 the estimated length of piling shown on the plans. Steel piles shall be provided such that 10
 additional feet {3 additional meters} of driving would not require an additional splice.
 Upon completion of the load testing, any test or anchor piling not a part of the finished
 structure shall be removed or cut off at least 1 foot {300 mm} below either the bottom of
 footing or the finished ground elevation (if not loaded within the footing area).
 The driving equipment, aids and methods used for driving test piles shall be identical to
 that which the Contractor proposes to use on the production piling. Approval of driving
 equipment shall conform with the requirements of these specifications. If piling are to be
 driven in a pile footing, then the Contractor shall excavate the ground at each test pile
 footing location to the elevation of the bottom of the footing, before the pile is driven,
 unless shown on the plans or directed otherwise by the Engineer.
 317
 
 SECTION 505
 PILING
 3. Test Pile with Static Load Testing.
 Test piles shall be driven to the minimum tip elevation when provided. Test piles shall
 be driven to a hammer blow count given on the blow count/bearing capacity graph. This
 graph shall be used as an estimate of the test pile’s bearing capacity which uses the required
 minimum bearing capacity (equal to twice the design load) and stroke to obtain the required
 blow count for the test pile. Once the required blow count (and minimum tip elevation, when
 provided) is reached, the bearing capacity shall be proven (after a 7 day wait for concrete
 piles and a 36 hour wait for steel piles) with a Static Load Test. This blow count and stroke,
 or the equivalent blow count and stroke, recorded during the last foot {300 mm} of driving of
 a passing Static Load Test Pile shall be used as the acceptance criteria for the production
 piling represented by this test pile. A revised bearing graph will be provided by the Materials
 & Tests Engineer that reflects the actual capacity of the test pile which shall be used to
 determine the bearing capacity of all production piles represented by this test pile.
 The Static Load Test indicates a failure if the bearing capacity determined from the load
 test is not equal to or greater than the required minimum bearing capacity. If the load test is
 a failure, the test pile shall be redriven. The blow count for the redrive shall be obtained by
 determining the blow count required for a theoretical increased bearing capacity. The blow
 count for the redrive shall be taken from the blow count/bearing capacity graph in
 accordance with the following formula:
 Load For Obtaining Redrive Blow Count = [2 X (A – B)] + A
 A = Minimum Bearing Capacity, B = Load At Failure
 The test pile shall then be reloaded. This process shall be repeated as many times as
 necessary until the load test is determined to be a passing load test.
 Test piles driven to plan grade and not having the hammer blow count required may also
 be spliced and driven until the required bearing is obtained. Concrete splices must be
 approved by the Engineer.
 4. Test Pile with Dynamic Load Testing.
 Dynamic load testing may be used to supplement static load testing. All dynamic load
 tests shall be correlated by a minimum of one representative static load test.
 If shown on the plans or in the proposal or a change is requested by the contractor and
 approved by the Materials and Tests Engineer, dynamic measurements will be taken by the
 Engineer during the driving of piles designated as dynamic load test piles.
 The Contractor shall notify the Engineer when the Contractor is ready to drive a dynamic
 test pile seven days in advance of driving the test pile. If the Contractor changes or delays
 the date of the dynamic testing, then the Contractor shall pay for all costs associated with
 the time delay to the dynamic testing Engineer.
 Test piles shall be driven to the minimum tip elevation when provided. Test piles shall
 be driven to the depth at which the dynamic test equipment indicates the required minimum
 bearing capacity (equal to twice the design load) has been achieved unless directed otherwise
 by the Materials and Tests Engineer. The stress in the piles will be monitored during driving
 with the dynamic testing equipment to insure that the values determined do not exceed the
 values in Item 505.03(d)2. If deemed necessary by the Engineer, the Contractor shall reduce
 the driving energy transmitted to the pile by using additional cushions, reducing the energy
 output of the hammer, or other appropriate methods in order to maintain stresses below the
 values in Item 505.03(b)2. If non-axial driving is indicated by dynamic test equipment
 measurements, the Contractor shall immediately realign the hammer system. The Engineer
 will notify the Contractor or their pile driving Subcontractor if their pile driving procedures
 violated any of the referenced requirements during the installation of the dynamically tested
 pile.
 The Materials & Tests Engineer may use dynamic measurements to adjust tip elevations
 after insuring that minimum tip requirements are satisfied. The Materials & Tests Engineer
 will review the dynamic test data and provide the acceptance criteria for the production
 piling that are represented by the test pile. A revised bearing graph will be provided by the
 Materials & Tests Engineer that reflects the actual capacity of the test pile which shall be
 used to determine the bearing capacity of all production piles represented by this test pile.
 For correlation of a static load test with a dynamic load test the Contractor shall, within
 48 hours of the static load test, perform a restrike dynamic load test. A cold hammer shall
 not be used for the restrike. The hammer shall be warmed up before restrike begins by
 318
 
 SECTION 505
 PILING
 applying at least 20 blows to another pile. The sequence shall consist of striking the
 designated pile for 50 blows or until the pile penetrates an additional three inches {75 mm},
 whichever occurs first. In the event the pile movement is less than 1/4 inch {6 mm} during
 the restrike, the restrike may be terminated after 20 blows. After restrike, the Materials and
 Tests Engineer will either accept the tip elevation or specify additional pile penetration and
 testing.
 5. Restrike for Production Piles
 If dynamic load tests have been correlated to at least one static load test then dynamic
 load testing may be used to perform a re-strike to verify minimum bearing capacity of
 production piles.
 The Materials & Tests Engineer will direct the Contractor (after waiting seven days for a
 concrete pile and 36 hours for a steel pile) to perform a restrike dynamic load test. A cold
 hammer shall not be used for the restrike. The hammer shall be warmed up before restrike
 begins by applying at least 20 blows to another pile. The sequence shall consist of striking the
 designated pile for 50 blows or until the pile penetrates an additional three inches {75 mm},
 whichever occurs first. In the event the pile movement is less than 1/4 inch {6 mm} during
 the restrike, the restrike may be terminated after 20 blows. Dynamic load test restrike for
 production piles may be used to verify minimum bearing capacity of piles that fail to achieve
 the required blow counts determined by test pile installation and static load testing.
 6. Driving to Refusal.
 No test pile is required for a pile to be driven to refusal, unless shown on the plans. The
 only exception is when a pile will be dynamically monitored because of an inability to
 perform a WEAP analysis. Refusal is defined as 240 blows per foot {300 mm} (20 blows per
 inch {25 mm}). Refusal shall only be used when rock is expected to be encountered. A load
 test will be required for all other situations.
 7. Heaved Piles.
 Level readings to check on pile heave after driving shall be made at the start of pile
 driving operations and shall continue until the Engineer determines that such checking is no
 longer required. Level readings shall be taken immediately after the pile has been driven and
 again after piles within a radius of 15 feet {5 m} have been driven. If pile heave is observed,
 accurate level readings referenced to a fixed datum shall be taken on all piles immediately
 after installation and periodically thereafter as adjacent piles are driven to determine the
 pile heave range. All piles that have been heaved more than 0.25 inches {6 mm} shall be
 reseated by driving to original position prior to heave. Reseating shall be done without
 additional compensation. Reseated piles shall be driven to the required resistance or
 penetration. Concrete shall not be placed in pile casings until pile driving has progressed
 beyond a radius of 15 feet {3 m} from the pile to be encased.
 
 (g) Loading Methods
 1. Static Load Testing Method
 a. Description.
 Static load testing shall be used to verify the axial load bearing capacity of pile
 groups or individual piles. Static load testing should be used after a test pile has been
 driven to the minimum tip elevation (if shown on the plans) and has met the bearing
 capacity estimate based on blow count and hammer stroke from the provided bearing
 curves. A static load test may also be used in conjunction with a dynamic load test when
 verifying axial load bearing capacity of piling.
 b. General.
 When required, the length of piles to be driven shall be determined by the actual
 loading tests of any designated pile (Test or Production) in the structure. The test shall
 be performed as defined by ASTM D 1143, Standard Test Method for Piles Under Static
 Axial Compressive Load using the Quick Load Test Method. In general, these tests shall
 consist of the incremental application and removal of static pressure exerted on the pile
 through approved rigging, together with suitable apparatus for accurately determining
 the superimposed weight {mass} of pressure and pile settlement under each increment of
 load. The safe allowable load shall be determined by the Engineer from the settlement
 
 319
 
 SECTION 505
 PILING
 versus load curve generated by the incremental loading based on Davisson’s failure
 criterion, explained in Subitem 505.03(g)1.c.
 A minimum 7 day waiting period shall be observed between the driving of a
 concrete load test pile and the commencement of the load testing unless otherwise
 specified in the contract or authorized by the Materials and Tests Engineer. For piles
 other than concrete this waiting period shall be 36 hours. The Contractor may extend the
 waiting period as deemed necessary before performing a static load test to allow for
 maximum soil set up time.
 If the Quick Load Test is performed using adjacent production piles as reaction piles
 for the test pile, the involved production piles should be checked for any permanent
 upward displacement. If any upward displacement is found, then all production piles
 used as reaction piles for the Quick Load Test shall be redriven as necessary to correct
 any possible axial load bearing capacity problem with the involved piles. This redrive
 shall be performed at the Contractor's expense.
 c. Static Load Test Procedure.
 The apparatus for applying the load shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer
 and have a capacity of 1000 tons {8900 kN} or 300 percent of the design load, whichever
 is less. Incremental loads of 10% of the design load shall be placed on the pile at 2.5
 minute intervals until continuous jacking is required to maintain the incremental load or
 the capacity of the load frame is reached.
 All loading tests will be continually inspected by the Engineer. Time, load, and
 settlement data will be recorded on Form C-15B immediately before and after the
 application of each load increment and at intermediate time intervals as specified. When
 the maximum load has been applied, readings will be taken and recorded when jacking
 has stopped. Additional readings will be taken after 2.5 minutes and again at 5 minutes.
 If a longer holding period is specified, additional readings will be taken as required. The
 load shall be removed after the required holding period in 4 equal parts, with time and
 rebound readings taken at each unloading increment. Readings will be taken
 immediately following each load removal, allowing 2.5 minutes between increments.
 Upon removal of the entire load, time and rebound readings will be taken and recorded.
 Additional time and rebound readings will be taken after 2.5 minutes and again at 5
 minutes.
 Load test data will be plotted by the Engineer in the form of settlement in inches
 {millimeters} (ordinate, positive down) versus applied load in kips {kN} (abscissa).
 Ultimate capacity predictions will be based upon Davisson’s failure criterion as applied
 to the aforementioned settlement curve, as per FHWA’s Manual on Design and
 Construction of Driven Pile Foundations. In this method, the elastic shortening of the pile
 (QL/AE, in inches {millimeters}) is superimposed on the settlement curve. In the elastic
 shortening equation, “Q” represents load in kips {kN}, “L” represents length of pile from
 settlement instrumentation to tip elevation in inches {meters}, “A” represents crosssectional area in square inches {square meters} (at voided section, if a void is present),
 and “E” represents elastic modulus in ksi {MPa} (elastic modulus for concrete piles is
 preferably obtained from dynamic load testing, but may be calculated as 60,000 {5000}
 times the square root of the design compressive strength, in psi {MPa}, when dynamic
 load testing is not performed. The elastic modulus for steel piles may always be assumed
 as 29,000 ksi {200,000 MPa}).
 The aforementioned elastic shortening curve is then increased or offset, by
 0.15+D/120 in inches {3.81+D/120 in millimeters} (where D = pile diameter or width in
 inches {mm}). The point in which the offset elastic shortening curve intersects the
 settlement curve is considered the ultimate pile capacity.
 d. Hydraulic Jacks and Load Gages.
 When hydraulic jacks and gages are to be used for the superimposed load, the
 jacks, gages and hydraulic pumps shall have been calibrated with each other within the
 last 6 months by an independent laboratory that has been approved by the Materials and
 Tests Engineer or by a Department laboratory. If multiple jacks are to be used with one
 gage, the calibration shall be performed at an approved independent laboratory. All jack
 calibrations shall be conducted in accordance with ALDOT-358 and shall be valid for a
 period of 6 months from the date of calibration; however, should the Engineer have any
 320
 
 SECTION 505
 PILING
 doubt of their accuracy he may require a check of their calibration using ALDOT
 equipment. All calibration checks shall be within 5% of the applied load. When a jack,
 gage and hydraulic pump are calibrated they shall be used as a unit, and changing any
 one of the three components shall require a recalibration. Gages shall be of the size that
 will provide ease of reading (approximately 4.5 inch {115 mm} diameter) with gradations
 for 2 tons {18 kN} or less for loads under 100 tons {890 kN} and gradations of 5 tons {44
 kN} or less for loads over 100 tons {890 kN}.
 Calibrated jacks, gages and pumps shall have identifiable serial numbers to insure
 traceability to calibration tests.
 2. Dynamic Load Testing Method.
 a. Description.
 Dynamic Load Testing shall be used to verify that the pile (test or production) is not
 overstressed while being driven and to determine the axial load bearing capacity. A
 Dynamic Load Test may also be used in conjunction with a Static Load Test when
 verifying the axial load bearing capacity of piling.
 b. General.
 When required, the length of piles to be driven shall be determined by the actual
 Dynamic Loading Test of any pile (test or production) in the structure. The test shall be
 performed as defined by AASHTO T 298, Standard Method of Test for High-Strain Dynamic
 Testing of Piles. Dynamic measurements shall be taken by the Engineer during the
 driving of piles designated as dynamic load test piles and/or production piles. In general,
 Dynamic Load Testing involves attaching two strain transducers and two accelerometers
 to the pile approximately 2 to 3 pile diameters below the pile head before initial driving
 (or at a convenient location during restrike dynamic load testing). The dynamic test is
 performed during actual pile driving. Dynamic load testing shall be performed, when
 required, on test or production piles only after a WEAP analysis has been performed.
 When directed by the Engineer, the Contractor shall (after waiting seven days for a
 concrete pile and 36 hours for a steel pile) perform a restrike dynamic load test. A cold
 hammer shall not be used for the redrive. The hammer shall be warmed up before
 redrive begins by applying at least 20 blows to another pile or other fixed object. After
 redriving, the Engineer will either accept the tip elevation or specify additional pile
 penetration and testing.
 c. Process
 Prior to placement in the leads, the Contractor shall make each designated concrete
 pile available for taking of wave speed measurements and for predrilling the required
 instrument attachment holes. Since there must be room on either side of the pile to drill
 instrumentation holes, the Contractor may be required to move piles to attain adequate
 clearance. Predriving wave speed measurements will not be required for steel piles,
 however steel piles must be available for predrilling instrument attachment holes. When
 wave speed measurements are made, the piling shall be in a horizontal position and not
 in contact with other piling. When required, the Contractor will furnish the equipment,
 materials, and labor necessary for drilling holes in the piles for mounting the
 instruments. The instruments will be attached near the head of the pile with bolts
 placed in masonry anchors for concrete piles or through drilled holes on steel piles. In no
 case shall the pile to be dynamically tested be picked up before the pile has been
 predrilled.
 The Contractor shall provide the Engineer with a safe, stable access to the top of
 the pile installed in the leads. The access shall conform to OSHA requirements. The
 access system shall be assembled and/or operated by the Contractor and shall provide a
 working area of not less than 16 square feet {1.5 square meters}. The Contractor shall
 furnish the Engineer details of the access system with the aforementioned Pile and
 Driving Equipment Data Form submittal.
 The Contractor shall furnish electric power for the dynamic test equipment. The
 power supply at the outlet shall be 10 Amp, 115 Volt, 55-60 cycle, A.C. only. Field
 generators used as the power source shall be equipped with functioning meters for
 monitoring voltage and frequency levels.

 SECTION 505
 PILING
 
 (h) Piling Length.
 1. Estimated Lengths of Piles.
 The estimated length of piles shown on the plans and in the proposal are for bid
 purposes only. The Contractor shall be responsible for providing the lengths of these piles
 necessary to obtain the bearing and penetration required as determined from results obtained
 in driving representative test piles or other pertinent data. It is expected that there will be
 variations in final tip elevations due to differences in driving resistance because of differing
 soil conditions.
 2. Pile Tip Elevation.
 The final tip elevation of each pile will be determined by the Engineer during the driving
 operation but in general, the minimum penetration for any pile shall be not less than 10 feet
 {3 m} into natural ground and not less than 1/3 the length of the pile. When minimum tip
 elevations are specified by contract documents, the Contractor shall drive piles to a depth
 that satisfies this requirement in addition to required minimum bearing capacity.
 3. Proposed Pile Lengths.
 a. Steel Piles.
 The Contractor shall furnish to the Engineer, for review, the proposed steel pile
 lengths for use in each bent of a structure before driving the piles.
 b. Concrete Piles.
 The Contractor shall furnish to the Engineer, for review, the proposed concrete pile
 lengths for use in each bent of a structure before casting the piles. The lengths of
 concrete piles will be approved by the Engineer before the casting of the piles.
 
 (i) Unsatisfactory Piles.
 Approval of a pile hammer relative to driving stress damage shall not relieve the Contractor
 of responsibility for the piles damaged because of misalignment of the leads, failure of the cap
 block or cushion material, failure of splices, malfunctioning of the pile hammer, pile
 manufacturer’s errors, or other improper construction methods. Piles damaged for such reasons
 shall be rejected and replaced at the Contractor’s expense when the Engineer determines that the
 damage impairs the strength of the pile.
 The method used in driving piles shall not subject the piles to excessive or undue abuse
 producing crushing, cracking, or spalling of concrete or deformation of the steel. Misaligned piles
 shall not be forced into proper position. Any pile damage during driving by reason of internal
 defects, or by improper driving, or driven out of its proper location, or driven below the
 designated cutoff elevation shall be corrected at the Contractor's expense by a method approved
 by the Engineer.
 Piles which have been bent during installation shall be considered unsatisfactory unless the
 bearing capacity is proven by load tests performed at the Contractor’s expense. If such tests
 indicate inadequate capacity, corrective measures as proposed by the contractor and approved by
 the Bridge Engineer, shall be taken such as installation of additional piles, strengthening of bent
 piles, or replacement of bent piles.
 A concrete pile will be considered defective if a visible crack or any defect is observed which,
 as determined by the Engineer, affects the strength or life of the pile.
 
 (j) Splicing Piles.
 1. General.
 Full length piles shall be used wherever practical. When splicing is necessary and cannot
 be avoided, the approved method shown on the plans shall be used. If details are not shown
 on the plans, the contractor’s proposed method of pile splicing shall be submitted to the
 Bridge Engineer for review and distribution.
 2. Precast Prestressed Concrete Piles.
 When necessary, the contractor shall submit proposed pile splicing details and design
 calculations to the Bridge Engineer for review and distribution. The details shall be checked,
 stamped approved, and signed by a Professional Engineer licensed by the Alabama Board of
 Licensure for Professional Engineers. This Professional Engineer shall not be an employee of
 the ALDOT. Any driving splice for a concrete pile will require dynamic testing during the
 
 322

 furnished. Welded connections for splices shall be used. All work shall be done with approved
 methods, materials, and experienced personnel who have been ALDOT certified 3F
 (qualification for fillet welding in a vertical position). Welding shall be in accordance with the
 Department’s current Welding Specification.
 Not more than three pieces (two splices) of steel pile will be permitted in making up one
 full length of proposed pile. In no case shall there be more than two splices exposed to view
 in any length of piling after driving is completed. In addition to meeting the requirements of
 the Specifications, the Contractor shall submit documentation of the identification (heat
 numbers for steel piles) of all portions of a built-up pile.
 
 (k) Pile Points.
 Pile points shall be furnished and installed as shown on the Plans or as directed by the

 and 11 mm minimum for HP360 piles}. The width of weld at the outside face of the
 pile flange shall be the same as the beveled depth.
 • E70XX welding rods shall be used.
 • All welds shall be made in the flat position. The welder shall be ALDOT certified 1G
 (qualification for groove welding in flat position). Welding shall be in accordance with
 the Department’s current Welding Specification.
 
 (l) Cut-Off Lengths.
 The tops of all permanent piles and pile casings shall be cut-off at the elevation shown on the
 plans or as ordered by the Engineer. All cut-off lengths not used in the structure shall become the
 property of the Contractor and shall be removed by the Contractor from the site of the work.
 
 (m) Pile Painting and Protection.

 accordance with the current AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges.
 The piling shall be driven to an adequate depth and/or so braced or tied back as to protect
 the work from damage and workmen from danger of injury and to also protect the newly
 constructed work from failure.
 
 (p) Protection of Existing Structures and Utilities.
 The Contractor shall control his operations to prevent damage to existing structures and
 utilities as outlined in Article 107.12. Preventive measures shall include, but are not limited to,
 selecting construction methods that will limit ground disturbance such as vibrations from pile
 driving operations and other construction related activities. Photographic, video and other surveys
 of surrounding structures and utilities could be made prior to driving to serve as documentation of
 the conditions prior to driving.
 
 505.04 Method of Measurement.

 loading tests ordered and completed in conformity with this Specification. If the pile does not
 carry the load satisfactorily after the load is placed according to the Specifications, and it
 becomes necessary to redrive the pile and place another load, this will be deemed an additional
 stage of loading. Each time the pile is driven to additional penetration and load tested again, each
 loading will be measured as an additional stage of loading, not as an additional loading test.
 
 (c) Dynamic Loading Tests.
 The number of dynamic loading tests measured will be the actual number of accepted
 dynamic loading tests ordered and completed in conformity with the specifications. There will be
 no additional payment for a restrike dynamic loading test performed on a designated test pile.

 in linear feet {meters} from the joint at the bottom of the build-up to the top of the pile. The
 linear feet {length in meters} of build-up will be included in the quantity of Concrete Piling
 Furnished. The splicing of this build-up will be measured as 30 additional linear feet {10 additional
 meters} of Concrete Piling Furnished.
 The build-up and splicing of a pile, where the pile will be driven with the build-up, will not
 be measured for payment under a contract pay item but will be paid for as Extra Work.
 
 (j) Concrete Pile Cut-Off.
 Each cut-off of a concrete pile will be measured as 6 additional linear feet {2 additional
 meters} of Concrete Piling Furnished.

 Pilot holes will be measured for payment by the linear foot {meter}. Pilot Holes will be
 measured from the top of the material where the auger or drill begins the excavation to the
 bottom of the hole.
 
 (m) Temporary Steel Sheet Piling.
 Temporary steel sheet piling will be measured for payment in units of square feet {square
 meters}. This square foot {square meter} quantity will be determined from the length and width of
 individual sheet piles. The length of a sheet pile will be measured from the embedded tip to 1
 foot {300 mm} above the existing ground or placed fill, whichever is appropriate. The width of a
 sheet pile will be the distance from centerline of the interlock on one side to the centerline of the
 interlock on the other side. The width of a sheet pile will be measured along the line of the
 sheets, not adding for bends or corrugations. The square foot {square meter} quantity for which
 payment will be made will be the sum of the square foot {square meter} areas of the individual
 sheet piles.
 
 505.05 Basis of Payment.

 Type II cement shall be used.
 The cementitious content shall be composed of no less than 20% nor more than 30% by
 weight {mass} of Class F fly ash additive. In lieu of fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace
 slag may be substituted for cement up to a minimum substitution rate of 35% and a maximum
 substitution rate of 50% by weight {mass}.
 4. Additional criteria applicable to Class DS3 concrete:
 Type II cement shall be used.
 The cementitious content shall be composed of 20% by weight {mass} of Class F fly ash
 and 10% by weight {mass} of microsilica additives. In lieu of the percentages of fly ash and
 microsilica, the cementitious content may be composed of 50% by weight {mass} substitution
 of ground granulated blast furnace slag and 5% by weight {mass} addition of microsilica
 additives.
 
 (c) Slurry.
 When use of slurry is either shown to be required in the contract documents or selected by
 the Contractor, mineral slurries shall be used unless another type of slurry is proposed for use by
 the Contractor and approved by the Engineer. The following minimum requirements apply to
 material components used in slurries:
 1. Approved Minerals.
 Sodium Bentonite or Attapulgite shall be used as the principal mineral constituents of
 slurry. The Engineer may approve use of other minerals upon receipt of demonstrated proof
 that the requested alternate mineral insures shaft stability at the applicable shaft
 construction site.
 2. Mixing Water.
 Mixing water shall be capable of meeting drinking water standards as outlined in Section
 807.
 3. Sand.
 Clean, locally available sand meeting the requirements of Section 802 (not to exceed

 DRILLED SHAFT CONSTRUCTION
 
 506.03 Construction Methods and Equipment.
 The Contractor shall perform excavations required for shafts through whatever materials are
 encountered, to the dimensions and elevations shown in the plans or otherwise required by the
 specifications and special provisions. The Contractor's methods and equipment shall be suitable for the
 site conditions and materials encountered. The permanent casing method shall be used only at
 locations shown on the plans or authorized by the Bridge Engineer.
 Actual cores recovered from the test borings are available for inspection at the Bureau of
 Materials and Tests.
 
 (a) General Requirements.
 1. Contractor Qualifications.
 The Contractor shall submit descriptions of the drilled shaft construction projects
 completed in the last three years to serve as evidence of the capability to construct drilled
 shafts. The descriptions of the drilled shaft projects shall contain names and telephone
 numbers of owners' representatives who can verify the Contractor's participation on those
 projects. These descriptions shall be submitted with the Installation Plan and will be
 evaluated by the Engineer.
 The evaluation of the Contractor's capability for constructing drilled shafts will have a
 bearing on the decision by the Engineer to require the construction of a Trial Drilled Shaft.
 2. Installation Plan.
 a. Installation Plan Requirements.
 No later than 30 days after the date of the Notice to Proceed, the Contractor shall
 submit an installation plan for review by the Engineer. This plan shall provide
 information on the following items as applicable:
 • Name and experience record of the drilled shaft superintendent in charge of
 drilled shaft operations for this project;

 bailing buckets, final cleaning equipment, desanding equipment, slurry
 pumps, core sampling equipment, tremies, concrete pumps, casing, etc.;
 • Details of the overall anticipated construction operation sequence and the
 proposed sequence of shaft construction;
 • Details of planned shaft excavation methods;
 • Details of the methods to be used to insure shaft stability (i.e. prevention of
 caving, bottom heave, etc., using temporary casing, slurry or other means)
 during excavation and concrete placement. This shall include a review of
 method suitability to the anticipated site and subsurface conditions. If
 casings are proposed or required, casing dimensions and detailed procedures
 for permanent casing installation, and temporary casing installation and
 removal shall be provided.
 • When use of slurry is required or proposed, details of the methods for
 mixing, circulating and desanding slurry;
 • Details of methods to clean the shaft excavation;
 • Details of reinforcement placement including support and centralization
 methods;
 • Details of concrete placement method required or proposed including

 • The method used to fill or eliminate all voids between the plan shaft
 diameter and excavated shaft diameter, or between the shaft casing and
 surrounding soil, if permanent casing is specified.
 • Details of the material, equipment, and procedures proposed to accomplish
 the required load testing.
 b. Evaluation of Installation Plan.
 The Engineer will evaluate the drilled shaft installation plan for conformance with
 the plans and specifications. Within 15 days following receipt of the installation plan,
 the Construction Engineer will return the plan for corrections, distribute the plan for
 construction inspection, or contact the Contractor to establish a mutually agreeable date
 and time for a meeting to discuss the installation plan. If a meeting is held to discuss the
 329
 
 SECTION 506
 DRILLED SHAFT CONSTRUCTION
 installation plan the Contractor and his drilled shaft project superintendent shall be in
 attendance. The Contractor will be notified of changes in the submitted installation plan
 deemed necessary by the Construction Engineer within seven days after the
 aforementioned meeting. Shaft construction shall not begin until the installation plan
 has been distributed by the Construction Engineer for construction inspection.
 Distribution of the installation plan for construction inspection shall not relieve the
 Contractor of the responsibility to satisfactorily complete the work as detailed on the
 plans and in the specifications.
 c. Modification of Installation Plan.
 Any proposed modification of the installation plan during construction shall be
 submitted to the Construction Engineer for review and distribution.
 3. Protection of Existing Structures and Utilities.
 The Contractor shall control his operations to prevent damage to existing structures and
 utilities as outlined in Article 107.12. Preventive measures shall include, but are not limited
 to, selecting construction methods and procedures that will prevent caving of the shaft
 excavation, monitoring and controlling the vibrations from construction activities such as the
 driving of casing or sheeting, drilling of the shaft, or from blasting, if permitted.
 4. Construction Sequence.
 a. Excavation to the bottom of shaft elevation shall be completed before shaft
 construction begins unless otherwise noted in the contract documents or approved by the
 Engineer. Any disturbance caused by shaft installation to a planned drilled shaft area shall be
 repaired by the Contractor prior to the shaft construction.
 b. When drilled shafts are to be installed in conjunction with embankment placement,
 the Contractor shall construct drilled shafts after the placement of fills unless shown
 otherwise in the contract documents or approved by the Engineer.
 c. Substructure concrete shall not be placed on a drilled shaft until the concrete in the
 shaft reaches a minimum of 80% of the required 28-day compressive strength and until all CSL
 test results (when required) are accepted and the CSL tubes have been dewatered and
 grouted.
 
 (b) Methods of Construction.
 1. Dry Method.
 The dry construction method shall be used only at sites where the groundwater level and
 soil conditions are suitable to permit construction of the shaft in a relatively dry excavation,
 and where the sides and bottom of the shaft may be visually inspected by the Engineer prior
 to placing reinforcement and concrete. The dry method consists of drilling the shaft
 excavation, removing accumulated water and loose material from the excavation, placing the
 reinforcing cage, and concreting the shaft in less than 3 inches of water.
 2. Wet Method.
 The wet construction method may be used at sites where a dry excavation can not be
 maintained for placement of the shaft concrete. This method consists of using water or
 mineral slurry to maintain stability of the hole perimeter while advancing the excavation to
 final depth, placing the reinforcing cage, and concreting the shaft. Where drilled shafts are
 located in open water areas, exterior casings shall be extended from above the water
 elevation into the ground to protect the shaft concrete from water action during placement
 and curing of the concrete. The casing shall be installed in a manner that will produce a
 positive seal at the bottom of the casing so that no seepage of water or other materials
 occurs into or from the shaft excavation.
 3. Casing for Dry or Wet Construction Methods.
 Permanent or temporary casing may be used when shown on the plans or at sites where
 the dry or wet construction methods are inadequate to prevent caving or excessive
 deformation of the hole. In this method the casing may be either placed in a predrilled hole
 or advanced through the ground by twisting, driving or vibration before being cleaned out.
 Casing which is going to be installed by predrilling and permanently left in rock for the
 purpose of shielding voids, shall be installed in not more than a 2 inch {50 mm} oversized drill
 hole. When downsizing of permanent casing is required, no more than six feet of overlap of
 casing will be allowed.
 330
 
 SECTION 506
 DRILLED SHAFT CONSTRUCTION
 When the casing method is required but not shown on the plans, the Contractor shall
 submit details of the proposed casing method (including casing lengths and diameters) and
 the proposed procedures of casing installation to the Bridge Engineer for review in the
 installation plan. If the need is determined after work on the shafts has begun, a revised
 plan proposing this method must be submitted for review.
 
 (c) Excavation Procedures.
 1. Excavation Location, Coordination and Time Constraints.
 Shaft excavations shall be made at locations and to the elevations, geometry and
 dimensions shown in the contract documents or as directed by the Engineer.
 A shaft shall not be excavated as long as an adjacent shaft in the same substructure unit
 is open unless authorized in writing by the Construction Engineer. Blasting and vibrating
 casings in place will not be allowed until the concrete in adjacent shafts has reached 80 % of
 the required 28-day compressive strength.
 Once the excavation of a shaft has been started, the excavation shall be conducted in a
 continuous operation until the excavation is completed.
 When an excavation is performed with any type of drilling fluid (i.e. slurry, water, etc.)
 used to stabilize the excavation, the placement of concrete shall begin within 36 hours from
 the start of excavation and within 12 hours from the start of the excavation of the bottom 5
 feet {1.5 m} of the shaft. If the Contractor exceeds these time limits, additional work may be
 required to insure that the condition of the excavation is adequate to result in an acceptable
 load carrying capacity in the completed drilled shaft. The Contractor may be required to over
 ream the entire depth of excavation (or the bottom 5 feet {1.5 m} if the 12 hour time limit is
 exceeded), increase the depth of the excavation or perform other work that may be required
 by the Engineer to provide an acceptable excavation. There will be no compensation for this
 additional work.
 The minimum width of over reaming shall be 1/2 inch {13 mm} and the maximum width
 shall be 3 inches {75 mm}.
 2. Excavation Log.
 The Contractor shall maintain an excavation log during shaft excavation. The log shall
 contain information such as: the description and approximate top and bottom elevation of
 each soil or rock material encountered during shaft excavation, elevations at which seepage
 or groundwater flow are encountered, and remarks. The type of tools used for the excavation
 shall be shown on the log. All changes in the type of tools used for excavation shall be shown
 on the log. The Engineer will monitor these operations and the logs will be used as a basis of
 measurement for payment. The Contractor shall resolve all discrepancies on the log noted by
 the Engineer at the end of each work day. Two copies of the legible, final log shall be
 furnished to the Engineer within 24 hours after a shaft excavation is completed and accepted.
 3. Handling Excavated Material.
 Excavated materials which are removed from shaft excavations shall be disposed of by
 the Contractor in accordance with Subarticle 215.03(g).
 4. Excavation Safety.
 The Contractor shall not permit workers to enter the shaft excavation for any reason
 unless: suitable casing has been installed, the water level has been lowered and stabilized
 below the level to be occupied, and adequate safety equipment and procedures have been
 provided to protect workers entering the excavation. The Contractor is responsible for
 compliance with applicable State and Federal safety regulations.
 
 (d) Types of Drilled Shaft Excavation.
 1. Drilled Shaft Excavation.
 The excavation of the shaft using conventional earth drilled shaft excavation tools will
 be designated as "drilled shaft excavation".
 2. Special Drilled Shaft Excavation.
 The excavation of the shaft requiring rock tools and/or procedures to accomplish hole
 advancement will be designated as "special drilled shaft excavation". This excavation will be
 for the removal of rock or other hard material within the planned shaft.
 
 331
 
 SECTION 506
 DRILLED SHAFT CONSTRUCTION
 
 (e) Excavating and Drilling Equipment.
 1. General.
 Excavation and drilling equipment shall have adequate capacity including power, torque
 and down thrust to excavate a hole of both the maximum specified diameter and to a depth
 of twenty (20) percent beyond the depths shown on the plans when operated at rated
 capacity.
 2. Rock Tools and Equipment.
 When the material encountered cannot be drilled using conventional earth drilling tools
 and equipment, the Contractor shall provide rock drilling equipment including air tools,
 approved blasting materials, and other equipment as necessary to construct the shaft
 excavation to the size and depth required. Concurrence of the Engineer shall be obtained
 prior to switching from earth to rock drilling tools and equipment. Approval of the Engineer is
 required before excavation by blasting is permitted.
 3. Overreaming.
 a. Sidewall overreaming shall be required when the sidewall of the hole is determined to
 have either softened due to excavation methods, swollen due to delays in concreting, or
 degraded because of slurry cake buildup. Overreaming thickness shall be a minimum of 1/2
 inch {13 mm} and a maximum of 3 inches {75 mm}.
 b. Overreaming may be accomplished with a grooving tool, overreaming bucket or other
 approved equipment. The thickness and extent of sidewall overreaming shall be as directed
 by the Engineer. The Contractor shall bear all costs associated with both sidewall
 overreaming and additional shaft concrete placement.
 4. Lost Tools.
 Drilling tools which are lost in the excavation shall not be considered obstructions and
 shall be promptly removed by the Contractor without compensation. All costs due to lost tool
 removal shall be borne by the Contractor including costs associated with correcting hole
 degradation due to removal operations and time delays.
 
 (f) Exploratory Shaft Excavation.
 1. General.
 The Contractor will be required to perform some type of exploratory shaft excavation
 (soil samples, rock cores or drilling or probing) below the bottom elevations shown on the
 plans unless this requirement is noted on the plans as being deleted. The Contractor shall
 extend drilled shaft tip elevations when the Engineer determines that the material
 encountered during this exploratory excavation is unsuitable and/or differs from that
 anticipated in the design of the drilled shaft.
 2. Rock Cores and Soil Samples.
 The Contractor shall take 2.0 inch {51 mm} minimum diameter rock cores and/or soil
 samples at locations as designated on the plans or as directed by the Engineer to determine
 the character of the material directly below the completed shaft excavation. The soil
 samples shall be extracted with a split spoon sampler or undisturbed sample tube in
 accordance with AASHTO T 206 and T 207. The methods and equipment used for the rock
 coring shall be those given in Subarticle 506.10(b) for the core drilling of drilled shaft
 concrete. The cores and/or soil samples shall be taken to a minimum of 10 feet {3 m} below
 the bottom of the drilled shaft excavation unless otherwise noted on the plans or directed by
 the Geotechnical Engineer. The Engineer may require this depth to be extended up to a total
 depth of 20 feet {6 m} below the bottom of the shaft. The Contractor may choose to take
 these cores and/or soil samples prior to excavating for the drilled shafts, however, payment
 will only be considered for that portion of the cores taken below the bottom elevation of the
 shafts shown on the plans.
 Rock core and soil test samples shall be measured, visually identified and described on
 the Contractor's log. The samples shall be placed in suitable containers, identified by shaft
 location, elevation and project number and delivered to the Central Laboratory in
 Montgomery with the Contractor's field logwithin 24-hours after the exploration is
 completed. The Engineer will inspect the samples/cores and determine the final depth of
 required excavation based on his evaluation of the sampled materials suitability.
 3. Drilling or Probing.
 332
 
 SECTION 506
 DRILLED SHAFT CONSTRUCTION
 At all drilled shaft locations where rock cores and/or soil samples are not designated,
 the Contractor will be required to drill or probe an exploratory holebelow the bottom
 elevation of the shaft to determine if any voids or crevices are present. The exploratory hole
 shall be taken to a depth of 10 feet {3 m}, unless noted otherwise on the plans. Exploratory
 drilling or probing will not be required if it is noted on the plans that this requirement is not
 necessary. No direct payment will be made for this operation.
 
 (g) Obstruction Removal.
 Surface and subsurface obstructions at drilled shaft locations shall be removed by the
 Contractor. Such obstructions may include man-made materials such as old concrete foundations
 and natural materials such as boulders. Special procedures and/or tools shall be employed by the
 Contractor in the event the hole cannot be advanced using conventional augers fitted with soil or
 rock teeth, drilling buckets and/or underreaming tools. Special procedures/tools may include but
 are not limited to: chisels, boulder breakers, core barrels, air tools, hand excavation, temporary
 casing, and increasing the hole diameter. Blasting shall not be permitted unless specifically
 approved in writing by the Engineer. Removal of obstructions will be classified as "special drilled
 shaft excavation".
 
 (h) Trial Drilled Shaft Installation.
 1. General.
 The Engineer will require the construction of a trial shaft if the submittal of descriptions
 of previous drilled shaft construction projects does not, in the opinion of the Engineer,
 substantiate the Contractor's capability for constructing the drilled shafts on this project. The
 Engineer may also require the construction of a trial shaft to verify the adequacy of unusual
 construction methods and/or equipment proposed for use in the construction of the
 production shafts.
 The trial drilled shaft shall be constructed if required by special note on the plans.
 2. Location and Depth.
 The trial shaft(s) shall be positioned as indicated on the plans or as directed by the
 Engineer. Unless otherwise indicated, shafts shall be drilled to the maximum depth of any
 production shaft shown on the plans.
 3. Failure to Demonstrate Ability.
 Failure of the Contractor to demonstrate the adequacy of his equipment, methods
 and/or expertise shall be reason for the Engineer to require alterations necessary to
 eliminate unsatisfactory results. Additional trial shafts required to demonstrate correction of
 deficiencies shall be at the Contractor's expense.
 4. Trial Shaft Approval.
 Once approval has been given to construct production shafts, no changes will be
 permitted in the personnel, methods or equipment that were used to construct the
 satisfactory trial shaft without written approval of the Engineer.
 5. Site Restoration.
 Unless otherwise shown in the contract documents, the trial shaft holes will be filled
 with non-reinforced concrete in the same manner that production shafts will be constructed.
 The concreted trial shafts shall be cutoff 2 feet {600 mm} below finished grade or at the
 mudline if in water. The disturbed areas at trial shaft holes shall be restored as nearly as
 practical to their original condition. No direct payment will be made for cutting off the top of
 the trial shaft or for the site restoration.
 
 506.04 Encased Excavations.
 (a) General.
 The outside diameter of casings shall not be less than the specified shaft size. No extra
 compensation will be allowed for concrete required to fill an oversized casing or excavation. All
 casings, except permanent casing, shall be removed from shaft excavations.
 
 (b) Temporary Casing.
 1. General.
 All casing shall be considered temporary unless specifically shown as permanent casing in
 the contract documents. The Contractor will be required to remove temporary casing before
 333
 
 SECTION 506
 DRILLED SHAFT CONSTRUCTION
 completion of concreting the drilled shaft. Telescoping, predrilling with slurry, and/or
 overreaming to beyond the outside diameter of the casing may be required to install casing.
 2. Size Substitution.
 If the Contractor elects to remove a specified diameter or length of casing and substitute
 a longer or larger diameter casing through caving soils, the excavation shall be either
 stabilized with slurry or backfilled before the new casing is installed. Other methods, as
 approved by the Engineer, may be used to control the stability of the excavation and protect
 the integrity of the foundation soils.
 3. Bound or Fouled Casings.
 Temporary casings which become bound or fouled during shaft construction and cannot
 be practically removed shall constitute a defect in the drilled shaft. The Contractor shall be
 responsible for correcting such defective shafts to the satisfaction of the Engineer. Correction
 may consist of, but is not limited to: removing the shaft concrete and extending the shaft
 deeper to compensate for loss of frictional capacity in the cased zone, providing straddle
 shafts to compensate for capacity loss, or providing a replacement shaft. All corrective
 measures including redesign of shafts caused by defective shafts shall be done to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer without compensation or an extension of the completion date of
 the project. In addition, no compensation will be paid for casing remaining in place.
 4. Removable Casing.
 When the shaft extends above ground or through a body of water, the portion exposed
 above ground or through a body of water may be formed with suitable, removable casing
 except when permanent casing is specified. Removable casing shall be stripped from the shaft
 in a manner that will not damage the concrete. Casings can be removed when the concrete
 has attained a compressive strength of not less than 2500 psi {20 MPa} as determined from
 concrete cylinder breaks provided: curing of the concrete is continued for the full period in
 accordance with specifications and the shaft concrete is not exposed to salt water or moving
 water for seven days.
 
 (c) Permanent Casings.
 1. General.
 Permanent casing shall be used when shown in the contract documents. The casing shall
 be continuous between top and bottom elevations prescribed in the plans. After installation is
 complete, the permanent casing shall be cut off at the prescribed elevation and the shaft
 completed by installing necessary reinforcing steel and concrete in the casing.
 Exterior surfaces of permanent casings shall be cleaned and coated with the prime coat
 only of a System 1A Coating in accordance with the requirements given in Section 521 and as
 shown on the plans. The exterior surfaces shall be coated prior to the installation of the
 casings. After the installation of the casings, all damage to the coated surfaces of the casings
 exposed to the air shall be repaired by a repeated application of the same prime coat. When
 not shown in the contract documents, permanent casing may be used if determined to be
 necessary by the Engineer and if approved by the Bridge Engineer.
 2. Multiple Casings.
 In cases where special temporary casings are shown on the plans or authorized in writing
 by the Engineer, the Contractor shall maintain alignment of both the temporary outer and
 permanent inner casing, and a positive, watertight seal between the two casings during
 excavation and concreting operations.
 
 506.05 Use of Slurry.
 (a) General.
 Slurries shall have a mineral grain size that will remain in suspension and sufficient viscosity
 and gel characteristics to transport excavated material to a suitable screening system. The
 percentage and specific gravity of the material used to make the suspension shall be sufficient to
 maintain stability of the excavation and allow proper concrete placement.
 
 (b) Mixing and Storage.
 The mineral slurry shall be premixed thoroughly with clean fresh water and adequate time
 allotted for hydration prior to introduction into the shaft excavation. Slurry tanks of adequate
 334
 
 SECTION 506
 DRILLED SHAFT CONSTRUCTION
 capacity will be required for slurry circulation, storage, and treatment. Excavated slurry pits will
 not be allowed in lieu of slurry tanks without the written permission of the Engineer.
 
 (c) Desanding.
 Desanding equipment shall be provided by the Contractor as necessary to control slurry sand
 content at less than 4 percent by volume at any point in the borehole. Desanding will not be
 required for setting temporary casing, sign post, or lighting mast foundations unless required by
 the plans or special provisions.
 
 (d) Required Fluid Level.
 1. General.
 During construction, the level of the slurry shall be maintained at a height sufficient to
 prevent caving of the hole. In the event of a sudden significant loss of slurry in the hole, the
 construction of that foundation shall be stopped until methods to stop slurry loss or an
 alternate construction procedure have been approved by the Engineer.
 2. Required Head.
 Mineral slurry in a shaft excavation shall be maintained at a level not less than 4 feet
 {1.2 m} above the highest expected static water surface along the depth of the shaft. If at
 any time the Engineer determines the slurry construction method fails to produce the desired
 final results, the Contractor shall discontinue this method and propose an alternate method
 for approval of the Engineer.
 
 (e) Control of Slurry.
 1. Setup Prevention.
 The Contractor shall take all steps necessary to prevent the slurry from "setting up" in
 the shaft. Such methods may include but are not limited to: agitation, circulation and/or
 adjusting the properties of the slurry.
 2. Control Testing.
 Control tests using suitable apparatus shall be carried out on the mineral slurry by the
 Contractor to determine density, viscosity and pH. An acceptable range of values for these
 physical properties is shown in the following table:

 SECTION 506
 DRILLED SHAFT CONSTRUCTION
 
 (f) Testing of Slurry.
 1. Frequency.
 Tests to determine density, viscosity and pH value shall be done during the shaft
 excavation to establish a consistent working pattern. A minimum of four sets of tests shall be
 made during the first 8 hours of slurry use. When the results show consistent behavior the
 testing frequency may be decreased to one set every four hours of slurry use.
 2. Test Reports.
 Reports of all tests required above, signed by an authorized representative of the
 Contractor, shall be furnished to the Engineer on completion of each drilled shaft.
 
 (g) DISPOSAL.
 Disposal of all slurry shall be done off site by the Contractor.
 
 506.06 Excavation Measurement and Cleaning.
 (a) General.
 The Contractor shall provide equipment and personnel for checking the dimensions and
 alignment of each permanent shaft excavation. The dimensions, depth and alignment shall be
 determined under the direction and to the satisfaction of the Engineer after final cleaning.
 
 (b) Cleaning.
 Unless otherwise stated in the contract, a minimum of 50 percent of the base of each shaft
 will have less than 1/2 inch {13 mm} of sediment at the time of concrete placement. The
 maximum depth of sediment or any debris at any place on the base of the shaft shall not exceed
 1.5 inches {40 mm}. Shaft cleanliness will be determined by visual inspection for dryshafts. For
 wet shafts the bottom of the shaft shall be sounded with an airlift pipe, a tape with a heavy
 weight {mass} attached to the end of the tape or other means acceptable to the Engineer. In
 addition, for dry excavations the maximum depth of water covering the bottom of the excavation
 shall not exceed 3 inches {75 mm} prior to concrete pour.
 
 506.07 Reinforcing Steel Construction and Placement.
 (a) General.
 The reinforcing steel cage, consisting of longitudinal and transverse bars, ties, cage
 stiffeners, spacers, centralizers, and other necessary appurtenances, shall be completely
 assembled and placed as a unit immediately after the shaft excavation is inspected and accepted,
 and prior to concrete placement. The reinforcing steel in the shaft shall be securely tied and
 supported so that the reinforcing steel will remain within allowable tolerances given in Subarticle
 506.11(c) of this Specification.
 
 (b) Spacers.
 1. Concrete spacers or other approved noncorrosive spacing devices shall be used at
 sufficient intervals near the bottom, and at intervals not exceeding 10 feet up the shaft, to insure
 concentric spacing for the entire cage length.
 2. Spacers shall be constructed of approved material equal in quality and durability to the
 concrete specified for the shaft. The spacers shall be of adequate dimension to insure the proper
 annular space between the outside of the reinforcing cage and the side of the excavated hole
 and/or permanent casing as detailed on the plans or proposed in the installation plan. If not
 detailed on the plans, a minimum 4 inch {100 mm} annular space will be required.
 
 (c) Cage Supports.
 Cylindrical concrete feet (bottom supports) shall be provided to insure that the bottom of the
 cage is maintained at the proper distance above the base as specified by the project plans.
 
 (d) Cage Extension.
 If the drilled shaft excavation is extended to an elevation lower than the plan bottom
 elevation, reinforcing cage length shall also be extended by the same amount. Cages may be
 extended at the plan bottom elevation by lap splicing additional longitudinal bars, per planned
 cage requirements, of sufficient length to provide a compression splice, 4.17 feet {1270 mm} in
 length, plus the required extension. Hoops for the extension shall be spaced the same as shown for
 other hoops. Any additional splices of the cage above the plan bottom elevation and not shown on
 
 336
 
 SECTION 506
 DRILLED SHAFT CONSTRUCTION
 the plans, must have prior approval of the Bridge Engineer. Stiffeners, spacers and other
 appurtenances shall also be extended as required.
 
 506.08 Concrete Placement Requirements.
 (a) General.
 Concrete used for drilled shaft construction shall meet the requirements of Subarticle
 506.02(b).
 After the reinforcing steel has been placed and before the concrete is ordered, the bottom of
 the drilled shaft must be resounded to verify cleanliness.
 
 (b) Concrete Placement Time Limitations.
 1. General.
 Concrete shall be placed as soon as possible after the reinforcing steel has been placed
 and the bottom of the shaft has been resounded. The concrete placement shall be continuous
 from the bottom to the top elevation of the shaft.
 The elapsed time from the beginning of concrete placement in the shaft to the
 completion of placement shall not exceed 2 hours except as allowed by the Engineer. The
 Engineer may allow the concrete placement time to exceed 2 hours if the Contractor
 adequately demonstrates that the slump of the concrete will not be less than 4 inches {100
 mm} during the entire time of concrete placement.
 2. Slump Loss/Time Relationship.
 a. General.
 The Contractor may choose either a laboratory test or a field test to demonstrate
 the slump loss/time relationship. Adjustments to chemical admixture dosages will be
 allowed for the sole purpose of extending the time of concrete placement provided that
 the admixtures are included in the approved concrete mix design. A new slump loss test
 will be required if changes are made to the concrete mix, including adjustments to
 chemical admixtures.
 b. Laboratory Test.
 The Contractor shall demonstrate by trial mix and slump loss tests that the slump of
 the concrete will not be less than 4 inches {100 mm} during the longer placement time.
 These tests shall be conducted by an independent testing laboratory, approved by the
 Department as per ALDOT-405, and in the presence of a Department representative. The
 slump loss tests shall be performed at intervals not to exceed 30 minutes and shall be
 made from a trial mix proportioned from the approved concrete mix design. The
 temperature of the trial mix shall be kept at a level representative of construction site
 conditions.
 c. Field Test.
 The Contractor shall demonstrate by construction site slump loss tests that the
 slump of the concrete will not be less than 4 inches {100 mm} during the longer
 placement time. The slump loss tests shall be performed at intervals not to exceed 30
 minutes and shall be made from the first batch of concrete that is placed in a trial
 drilled shaft. The concrete used for these slump loss tests shall be sampled at the trial
 drilled shaft site and shall be kept covered during testing. If a trial shaft is not required
 then a field test may be performed at the construction site prior to the beginning of the
 work. The slump test shall be performed by the contractor’s Concrete Technician,
 certified by the Department as per ALDOT-405, in the presence of a Department
 representative.
 
 (c) Placement through Slurry and/or Encased Excavations.
 1. General.
 The Contractor shall insure that a heavily contaminated slurry suspension, which could
 impair the free flow of concrete, has not accumulated in the bottom of the shaft.
 2. Required Slurry Sampling.
 Prior to placing concrete in a slurry filled shaft excavation, the Contractor shall take
 slurry samples using a sampling tool. Slurry samples shall be extracted from the base of the
 shaft and at intervals not exceeding 10 feet {3 m} up the shaft, until two consecutive samples
 337
 
 SECTION 506
 DRILLED SHAFT CONSTRUCTION
 produce acceptable values for density, viscosity, pH, and sand content as noted in Subarticle
 506.05(c) and Item 506.05(e)2, respectively.
 3. Unacceptable Sampling Results.
 When any slurry samples are found to be unacceptable, the Contractor shall take
 whatever action is necessary to bring the mineral slurry within specification requirements.
 Concrete shall not be poured until resampling and testing results produce acceptable values.
 4. Required Concrete Level During Placement.
 The level of fresh concrete placed into a casing shall be a minimum of 5 feet {1.5 m}
 above either the hydrostatic water level or the level of drilling fluid whichever is higher. As a
 temporary casing is withdrawn, care shall be exercised to maintain an adequate level of
 concrete within the casing so that fluid trapped behind the casing is displaced upward and
 discharged at the ground surface without contaminating or displacing the shaft concrete.
 
 506.09 Concrete Placement Methods.
 (a) General.
 If a method of concrete placement has not been specifically identified in the contract
 documents, the Contractor may use any of the placement methods described hereafter. If a
 concrete pump is used to move the concrete to the drilled shaft, a standby pump shall be
 immediately available to pump the concrete if there is a pump failure. Details pertaining to
 compliance with this specification shall be presented as part of the Contractors "Installation Plan"
 as outlined in Item 506.03(a)2.
 Concrete placement shall continue after the shaft excavation is full until good quality
 concrete is evident at the top of the shaft. Any overflow of concrete at the top of the shaft shall
 be removed to maintain a uniform appearance and the proper dimensions of the shaft.
 
 (b) Free Fall Placement.
 1. General.
 The free fall placement of concrete shall only be permitted in dry vertical shafts where
 the clear opening (inside the reinforcing cage) is not less than 24 inches {610 mm} in
 diameter. The height of free fall placement shall not exceed 75 feet {22 m}. Concrete placed
 by free fall shall fall directly to the placement location without contacting either the
 reinforcing cage or the shaft sidewall.
 The Engineer will observe the falling of the concrete within the shaft. If the concrete
 strikes the reinforcing cage or sidewall, or if there is excessive spatter from the impact of the
 falling concrete, the Contractor shall reduce the rate of concrete placement, reduce the
 height of free fall or provide a drop chute for concrete placement as directed by the
 Engineer.
 2. Drop Chute Requirements.
 a. General.
 Drop chutes shall consist of a smooth tube of either one piece construction or
 sections which can be added and removed. Concrete may be placed through either a
 hopper at the top of the tube or side openings as the drop chute is retrieved during
 concrete placement.
 b. Chute Support.
 The drop chute shall be supported so that the free fall of the concrete measured
 from the bottom of the chute to the point of deposition is less than 75 feet {22 m}. If
 concrete placement causes the shaft excavation to cave or slough, or if the concrete
 strikes the rebar cage or sidewall, the Contractor shall reduce the height of free fall
 and/or reduce the rate of concrete flow into the excavation.
 3. DISQUALIFICATION OF FREE FALL METHOD.
 If in the opinion of the Engineer, placement cannot be satisfactorily accomplished by the
 free fall and drop chute method, the Contractor shall change to either tremie or pumping
 methods to accomplish the pour.
 
 (c) Tremie Concrete Placement.
 Tremies may be used for concrete placement in either wet or dry holes.
 1. Tremie Requirements.
 338
 
 SECTION 506
 DRILLED SHAFT CONSTRUCTION
 a. General.
 Tremies shall consist of a tube of sufficient length, weight {mass}, and diameter to
 discharge concrete at the shaft base elevation. The tremie shall not contain aluminum
 parts which will have contact with the concrete. The tremies inside diameter shall be at
 least 6 times the maximum size of aggregate used in the concrete mix but shall not be
 less than 10 inches {250 mm}.
 b. Tremie Tube Wall.
 Inside and outside surfaces of the tremie shall be clean and smooth to permit both
 flow of concrete and unimpeded withdrawal during concreting. The wall thickness of the
 tremie shall be adequate to prevent crimping or sharp bends which restrict concrete
 placement.
 c. Concrete Placement.
 The tremie used for wet concrete placement shall be watertight. Underwater
 placement shall not begin until the tremie is placed to the shaft base elevation. Valves,
 bottom plates or plugs may be used to insure concrete discharge begins within one
 tremie diameter of the base. Plugs shall either be removed from the excavation or be
 made of a material which will not cause a defect in the shaft if not removed. The
 discharge end of the tremie shall be constructed to permit the free radial flow of
 concrete during placement operations.
 2. Placement Requirements.
 a. General.
 The tremie discharge end shall be immersed at least 5 feet {1.5 m} in concrete at
 all times after starting the flow of concrete. The flow of the concrete shall be
 continuous. The concrete in the tremie shall be maintained at a positive pressure
 differential at all times to prevent water or slurry intrusion into the shaft concrete.
 b. Defective Shafts.
 If at any time during the concrete pour, the tremie line orifice is removed from the
 fluid concrete column and discharges concrete above the rising concrete level, the shaft
 shall be considered defective. In such case, the Contractor shall either:
 • remove the reinforcing cage and concrete, complete any necessary sidewall
 removal directed by the Engineer, and repour the shaft or,
 • the tremie shall be replugged, recharged with concrete and inserted a
 minimum of 5 feet {1.5 m} below the existing top level of concrete prior to
 continuing the pour. The contractor shall be responsible for correcting any
 defect caused by this procedure without additional compensation.
 All costs for replacement of defective shaft concrete shall be the responsibility of
 the Contractor.
 
 (d) Pumped Concrete Placement.
 Concrete pumps and lines may be used for concrete placement in either wet or dry
 excavations.
 1. Equipment Requirements.
 Pump lines shall have a minimum diameter of 4 inches {100 mm} and shall be
 constructed with watertight joints. Except as modified herein, requirements pertaining to
 tremie lines as stated in Item 506.09(c)1, also apply to pump lines and their use. The
 concrete pump unit shall have sufficient power to insure continuous placement of concrete
 under all foreseeable placement conditions.
 2. Placement Requirements.
 a. Discharge Orifice Location and Pressure.
 The discharge orifice shall remain at least 5 feet {1.5 m} below the surface of the
 fluid concrete. When lifting the pump line during concreting, the Contractor shall
 temporarily reduce the line pressure until the orifice has been repositioned at a higher
 level in the excavation.
 b. Defective Shafts.
 If at any time during the concrete pour the pump line orifice is removed from the
 fluid concrete column and discharges concrete above the rising concrete level, the shaft
 339
 
 SECTION 506
 DRILLED SHAFT CONSTRUCTION
 shall be considered defective. In such case, the Contractor shall remove the reinforcing
 cage and concrete, complete any necessary sidewall removal directed by the Engineer,
 and repour the shaft. All costs for replacement of defective shaft concrete shall be the
 responsibility of the Contractor.
 
 506.10 Testing Requirements For Drilled Shafts.
 (a) Crosshole Sonic Logging of Drilled Shafts.
 1. General Requirements.
 The nondestructive testing method called Crosshole Sonic Logging (CSL) shall be used on
 all production and trial drilled shafts (a) when constructed with the placement of concrete
 underwater or through slurry, (b) when required by special note on the plans, (c) when a full
 length temporary casing is used to prevent water from entering the shaft, or (d) when
 determined to be necessary by the Engineer. The testing shall not be conducted until 72
 hours after the placement of all concrete in a shaft and must be completed within 20
 calendar days after placement.
 The CSL tests shall be conducted by an experienced independent testing consultant
 approved by the Engineer prior to testing.
 The CSL tests measure the time it takes for an ultrasonic pulse to travel from a signal
 source in one access tube to a receiver in another access tube. In uniform, good quality
 concrete, the travel time between equi-distant tubes will be relatively constant and
 correspond to a reasonable concrete pulse velocity from the bottom to the top of the
 foundation. In uniform, good quality concrete, the CSL test will also produce records with
 good signal amplitude and energy. Longer travel times and lower amplitude/energy signals
 indicate the presence of irregularities such as poor quality concrete, void, honeycomb and
 soil intrusions. The signal will be completely lost by the receiver and CSL recording system for
 the more severe defects such as voids and soil intrusions.
 2. Preparation for Testing.
 A number of tubes shall be installed in each shaft to permit access for CSL. The number
 of tubes installed will depend on the diameter of the shaft as specified below:
 
 Shaft Diameter D
 
 Minimum Number of Tubes
 
 D < 4.5 feet {1372 mm}
 4
 4.5 feet {1372 mm} < D < 5.5 feet {1676 mm}
 5
 5.5 feet {1676 mm} < D < 6.5 feet {1981 mm}
 6
 6.5 feet {1981 mm} < D < 7.5 feet {2286 mm}
 7
 7.5 feet {2286 mm} < D < 8.5 feet {2591 mm}
 8
 8.5 feet {2591 mm} < D < 9.0 feet {2743 mm}
 9
 9.0 feet {2743 mm} < D < 10.0 feet {3048 mm}
 10
 10.0 feet {3048 mm} < D < 11.0 feet {3353 mm}
 11
 11.0 feet {3353 mm} < D < 12.0 feet {3658 mm}
 12
 The tubes shall have a 1.5 inch {40 mm} inside diameter and shall be schedule 40 steel
 pipe. The pipes shall have a round, regular internal diameter free of defects or obstructions,
 including any at pipe joints, in order to permit the free, unobstructed passage of a 1.3 inch
 {30 mm} diameter source and receiver probes. The tubes shall be watertight and free from
 corrosion with clean internal and external faces to ensure passage of the probes and a good
 bond between the concrete and the tubes.
 The pipes shall each be fitted with a water tight shoe on the bottom and a removable
 cap on the top. The pipes shall be securely attached to the interior of the reinforcement cage
 with a minimum cover of 4 inches {100 mm}.The tubes shall be installed in each shaft in a
 regular, symmetric pattern such that each tube is equally spaced from the others around the
 perimeter of the cage. The Contractor shall submit to the testing organization his selection of
 tube size, along with his proposed method to install the tubes, prior to construction. The
 tubes shall be as near to parallel as possible. The tubes shall extend from 6 inches {150 mm}
 above the shaft bottoms to at least 3 feet {1 m} above the shaft tops. If the shaft top is
 sub-surface, the tubes shall extend at least 2 feet {600 mm} above the ground surface. Any
 joints required to achieve full length tubes shall be made watertight. Care shall be taken
 during reinforcement installation operations in the drilled shaft hole so as not to damage the
 tubes. As the cage is being lowered into the shaft, the tubes shall be checked to assure that
 340
 
 SECTION 506
 DRILLED SHAFT CONSTRUCTION
 they are vertical and parallel and that all connections are water tight. After placement of the
 reinforcement cage, the tubes shall be filled with clean water as soon as possible. After the
 tubes are filled with water, the tube tops shall be capped or sealed to keep debris out of the
 tubes prior to concrete placement.
 The pipe caps or plugs shall not be removed until the concrete in the shaft has set. Care
 shall be exercised in the removal of caps or plugs from the pipes after installation so as not to
 apply excess torque, hammering, or other stresses which could break the bond between the
 tubes and the concrete.
 3. Typical CSL Test Equipment.
 Typical CSL test equipment consists of the following components:
 • A microprocessor based CSL system for display of individual CSL records,
 analog-digital conversion and recording of CSL data, analysis of receiver
 responses and printing of CSL logs.
 • Ultrasonic source and receiver probes for 1.5 inch {40 mm} ID pipe, as
 appropriate.
 • An ultrasonic voltage pulser to excite the source with a synchronized triggering
 system to start the recording system.
 • A depth measurement device to determine and record depths.
 • Appropriate filter/amplification and cable systems for CSL testing.
 4. CSL Logging Procedures.
 Before the placement of concrete, a minimum of one tube per shaft shall be plumbed
 and the tube length recorded, including a notation of the stickup of the tubes above the shaft
 tops. Information on the shaft bottom and top elevations and/or length, along with
 construction dates shall be provided to the Engineer and the approved testing organization
 before the CSL tests are performed.
 The CSL tests shall be carried
 out with the source and receiver probes in the same horizontal plane unless test results
 indicate potential defects in which case the questionable zone may be further evaluated with
 angled tests (source and receiver vertically offset in the tubes). CSL measurements shall be
 made at depth intervals of 2 inches {50 mm} or less, and shall be done from the bottom of the
 tubes to the top of each shaft. The probes shall be pulled simultaneously, starting from the
 bottoms of the tubes, over a depth measuring device. Any slack shall be removed from the
 cables prior to pulling to provide for accurate depth measurements of the CSL records.
 Prior to leaving the job site, the approved testing organization shall notify the Engineer
 that all data was collected satisfactorily or if there were discrepancies in the supplied CSL
 tube lengths, difficulties in obtaining the data or if tube access was obstructed anywhere in
 the supplied lengths. CSL tests shall be conducted between pairs of tubes. The approved
 testing organization shall test at least two diagonals through the center and between each
 tube pair around the perimeter of all tested shafts. Two diagonal tests shall be as close as
 possible to being at right angles to each other. Additional logs shall be conducted at no
 additional cost in the event anomalies are detected.
 The Contractor shall attempt to clear all tube obstructions reported to the Engineer so
 that tubes can be retested to full depth while the approved testing organization is on site. If
 obstructions cannot be cleared in a tube the approved testing organization shall conduct the
 CSL test in the adjacent pair of unobstructed tubes so that the measurements are made as
 close as possible to the obstructed tubes.
 Any anomalies indicated by longer pulse arrival times and significantly lower
 amplitude/energy signals shall be reported to the Engineer and further tests such as fan
 shaped tests, tests with probes raised at a fixed offset distance, or other topographical
 techniques shall be conducted as required to evaluate the extent of such anomalies.
 Additional NDT methods which may be used to evaluate possible defects include Singlehole
 Sonic Logging, Gamma-Gamma Nuclear Density Logging, and/or Surface Sonic Echo and
 Impulse Response tests.
 
 341
 
 SECTION 506
 DRILLED SHAFT CONSTRUCTION
 5. CSL Testing Results.
 The CSL results shall be presented to the Engineer in a report. This report shall include
 recommendations as to the acceptability, unacceptability, soundness, etc., of the drilled
 shaft. The report shall be checked, stamped approved, and signed by a Professional Engineer
 licensed by the Alabama Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers. This Professional
 Engineer shall not be an employee of the ALDOT. The report shall be submitted directly to
 the Materials and Tests Engineer with a copy to the Project Manager. The test results shall
 include CSL logs with analyses of:
 • Initial pulse arrival time versus depth
 • Pulse energy/amplitude versus depth
 A CSL log shall be presented for each tube pair tested with any defect zones indicated on
 the logs and discussed in the test report as appropriate.
 6. Evaluation of CSL Test Results.
 The Engineer will evaluate the CSL test results and determine whether or not the drilled
 shaft construction is acceptable. This evaluation will be completed within 14 calendar days of
 the date of receipt of the report by the Materials & Tests Engineer.
 If the Engineer determines that the drilled shaft is acceptable, the CSL tubes shall be
 dewatered and grouted. The grout shall be of the same strength or higher than the strength
 of the concrete used in the original drilled shaft. The contractor may use any of the grout
 mixes listed in Table 1 of Item 453.03(b)2. with the exception that calcium chloride will not
 be allowed. The contractor may submit another design mix for approval.
 If the Engineer determines that the drilled shaft is unacceptable, the shaft shall be
 cored in accordance with the requirements given in Subarticle 506.10(b) to allow further
 evaluation of the shaft. Cores shall be taken without additional compensation unless the
 testing of the cores indicates that the concrete in the shaft meets all specification
 requirements. If the testing of the cores indicates that the concrete meets specification
 requirements, the cost of the coring will be paid for as Extra Work.
 
 (b) Core Drilling Of Drilled Shaft Concrete.
 Production or trial drilled shafts that are determined to be unacceptable by the CSL tests may
 be cored to determine the quality of the shaft. The required number and depth of cores will be
 determined by the Engineer.
 Because it is necessary to obtain a high percentage of core recovery for visual inspection and
 compressive strength testing, the core bit used for core drilling shall be warranted by the
 manufacturer as being capable of coring the concrete as strong as could possibly be present in the
 shaft. A new bit or new core barrel will be required at any time the Engineer determines that the
 equipment may not be capable of obtaining good quality cores. The minimum diameter of the
 cores shall be 3.0 inches {76 mm}.
 An accurate log of cores shall be kept and the cores shall be placed in a crate and properly
 marked showing the shaft depth at each interval of core recovery. The cores along with three
 copies of the coring log shall be transported to the ALDOT Bureau of Materials and Tests,
 Montgomery, Alabama, for inspection.
 Construction shall not proceed above a drilled shaft until the quality of the shaft, as
 represented by the core samples, is determined to be acceptable and notification to continue
 construction is given by the Construction Engineer.
 If the Engineer determines that the drilled shaft is acceptable, the core holes and the CSL
 tubes shall be dewatered and grouted. The grout shall be of the same strength or higher than the
 strength of the concrete used in the original drilled shaft. The contractor may use any of the
 grout mixes listed in Table 1 of Item 453.03(b)2. with the exception that calcium chloride will not
 be allowed. The contractor may submit another grout design mix for approval.
 If the quality of thedrilled shaft is determined to be unacceptable then the Contractor shall
 construct another foundation to carry the load that will be placed on the shaft or perform
 corrective work as required by the Department. This foundation or the corrective work shall be
 constructed without compensation from the Department. The details of the replacement
 foundation shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements given in Article 105.02 for
 Working Drawings.

 mortar has been allowed to set for at least 96 hours in a well moistened condition
 throughout this period. Prior to erecting girders, the top plate shall be rotated to fit the
 grade of the girder and the bearing plate shall be adjusted for temperature so that it
 will be centered on the masonry plate at 70 °F {20 °C}.
 e. Anchor Bolt Installation.
 The reinforcing steel in the concrete shall be adjusted as directed by the Engineer
 prior to pouring in order to permit the correct placement of the anchor bolts.
 If the required details of the anchor bolt installation are not given on the plans the
 Contractor shall have the following options for installing the bolts:
 - supporting the bolts with a template during the placement of concrete;
 - casting anchor bolt wells in the concrete;
 - drilling holes in the concrete after the concrete has cured.
 The Contractor shall notify the Engineer in writing of the option selected for the
 installation of the bolts.
 Anchor bolt wells shall be large enough to allow adjustments to the location of the
 bolts to fit adjustments to the superstructure unit but shall not exceed 4 inches {100
 mm} in diameter unless approved otherwise by the Bridge Engineer. The form for the
 anchor bolt wells shall be removed before wells are filled. Water shall not be allowed to

 installed so that the centerline of the anchor bolt aligns with the center of the slotted
 hole of the expansion bearing at 70 °F (20 °C).
 3. Handling Members.
 All members shall be carefully handled to prevent damage to them and in a manner that
 any camber put into them will not be changed. One pick-up point will be permitted on pieces
 50 feet {15 m} or less in length. Two pick-up points, located at or between the 1/4 and 1/3
 points, will be required on pieces over 50 feet {15 m} in length. Calculations showing that the
 pieces will not be damaged, along with erection plans, will be required when pick-up points
 are requested to be located outside of these areas. This data shall be submitted in
 accordance with Subarticle 105.02(d). Reference is made to Article 836.17.
 4. Erection Assembly.
 The parts shall be accurately assembled as shown on the plans and any match marks shall
 be strictly followed. Splices and field connections shall have at least 50% of the holes filled
 using bolts (either erection or untorqued permanent bolts) and an adequate number
 (Minimum 10%) of forged barrel or drift type erection pins for fit up and alignment. The
 diameter of the erection pins shall be 1/32 inch {1 mm} larger than the diameter of the bolts.
 Splices and connections carrying traffic during erection shall have 75% of the holes so filled.
 Erection bolts shall be tightened to snug tight condition. Snug tight is defined as the tightness
 that exists when the plies of the joint are in firm contact. This may be attained by a few
 impacts of an impact wrench or the full effort of a person using an ordinary spud wrench.
 Before beginning high strength bolting, the structure shall be adjusted to correct grade and
 alignment.
 Bolts and nuts for bolted beam and girder splices shall be placed so that (1) flange
 splices have nuts on the exterior face of the splice, (2) web splices have bolt heads on the
 outside face of exterior beams or girders.
 Filler plates for bolted beam and girder splices have been based on theoretical
 dimensions, the thickness of the plates shall be adjusted in the shop to take care of any
 difference greater than 1/16 inch {1.6 mm} between the theoretical and actual dimensions.
 Splices in members of the same theoretical size will require filler plates if the actual
 dimensions vary more than 1/16 inch {1.6 mm}.
 5. Defective or Damaged Material.
 Any material that is damaged, distorted or in any way defective and is considered to be
 repairable shall be corrected by means approved by the Central Office. The Contractor shall
 submit a detailed proposed procedure for approval prior to making any corrections. Minor
 misfits involving occasional reaming of a hole will not require Central Office approval.
 Wholesale reaming of holes will require Central Office approval.
 6. High Strength Bolting.
 a. General.
 High tensile strength heavy hex bolts shall be used for all field fasteners unless
 otherwise noted on the plans or in the proposal. The bolts, nuts, washers and direct
 tension indicators shall conform to the requirements of Article 836.33. All requirements
 for testing of materials and for calibration of equipment shall be met prior to
 installation.
 b. Bolted Parts.
 Surfaces of bolted parts in contact with the bolt head and nut shall not have a slope
 of more than 1:20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis. Bolted parts shall fit
 solidly together when assembled and shall not be separated by gaskets or any other
 interposed compressible material.
 349
 
 SECTION 508
 STRUCTURAL STEEL AND MISCELLANEOUS METALS
 When assembled, all joint surfaces, including those adjacent to the washers, shall
 be free of scale. They shall be free of dirt, loose scale, burrs, and other defects that
 would prevent solid seating of the parts. Contact surfaces within friction-type joints
 shall be free of oil, paint, lacquer, or galvanizing unless noted otherwise on the plans or
 in the proposal.
 c. Bolt Assemblies.
 The Contractor shall take special care in storing the bolt assemblies (bolts, nuts,
 washers and direct tension indicators) to prevent them from rusting. Any components of
 the bolt assemblies that are rusted shall be thoroughly cleaned or replaced prior to
 installation. Bolts that have been cleaned shall be lubricated in the field prior to
 installation. Plain (ungalvanized) bolts shall be "oily" to the touch when installed.
 Galvanized nuts shall be lubricated with a lubricant (Beeswax or equivalent)
 containing a visible dye so that a visual check can be made for proper lubrication prior to
 installation. Special care shall be taken in storing galvanized bolts with water soluble
 lubricants.
 d. Installation.
 Galvanized nuts shall be checked to verify that a visible lubricant is on the threads.
 High strength fasteners, plain and galvanized, shall be subjected to jobsite
 rotational-capacity tests performed in accordance with Item 836.33(c)4. prior to the
 start of any bolt installation. Washers are required as part of the test. A
 Skidmore-Wilhelm Gage or equivalent, a standard torque wrench, a suitable steel joint
 (to conduct test on short bolts if needed) and any other miscellaneous tools or materials
 required for this test shall be provided by the Contractor. This test shall be performed by
 the Contractor and witnessed by the Engineer.
 Prior to beginning the tensioning operation each day, a minimum of one
 rotational-capacity test shall be performed to verify that the bolt assemblies are still
 properly lubricated. The bolt assembly to be tested will be determined by the Engineer
 and may come from any that are in question, including erection bolts which have been
 placed, but not tensioned. If this test fails, any assemblies which have been subjected to
 similar conditions as the failing sample shall be either cleaned and lubricated or
 replaced prior to tensioning. Additional rotational-capacity tests may be required at the
 discretion of the Engineer.
 Bolts shall be installed with a hardened washer under the nut or bolt head,
 whichever is the element turned in tightening. If the markings on the nuts are raised
 then the nuts shall be installed with the markings to the outside. A flat washer may be
 used when the abutting surface adjacent to the bolt head or nut does not have a slope of
 more than 1:20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis. Where an outer face of
 the bolted parts has a slope of more than 1:20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt
 axis, a smooth beveled washer shall be used to compensate for lack of parallelism.
 Before tightening the bolts to the required minimum tension, all bolts shall first be
 tightened to snug tight condition, progressing from the most rigid part of the joint
 towards the free edges. See Item 508.03(d)4. for a definition of snug tight condition. At
 snug tight, all joining pieces shall be in firm contact. All bolts shall then be tightened to
 give the minimum tension values shown in Table 1. Tightening shall be done by either
 the Calibrated Wrench Method, Turn-Of-Nut Method or Direct Tension Indicator Method.
 The element not being turned (bolt or nut) shall be held with a wrench during tightening
 to prevent rotation of the fixed element.

 e. Calibrated Wrench Method.
 The Contractor shall furnish all wrenches necessary to install the high strength
 bolts. He shall also furnish a calibration device (Skidmore-Wilhelm Calibrator or
 equivalent) and use it to calibrate the wrenches used for bolt installation and inspection.
 The calibration device shall be calibrated by the State Testing Laboratory or other
 approved laboratory prior to being used. The calibration results will be valid for a period
 of six (6) months after the date of calibration under normal conditions. The Engineer
 may require that the calibration device be recalibrated at any time.
 Wrenches shall be calibrated on the project at least once daily and for each lot of
 nuts and bolts to be used. Calibration shall be accomplished by the tightening in the
 calibration device of not less than 3 typical bolts of each lot to be installed. Power
 wrenches shall be adjusted to stall or cutout at a tension slightly greater than the
 minimum required. If manual torque wrenches are used, the torque indication
 corresponding to the calibration tension shall be noted and used in the installation of all
 bolts of the tested lot. Nuts shall be in tightening motion when torque is measured.
 When using calibrated wrenches to install several bolts in a single joint the wrench shall
 be returned to touch up bolts previously tightened, which may have been loosened by
 the tightening of subsequent bolts, until all are tightened to the prescribed amount.
 Impact wrenches shall be of adequate capacity and sufficiently supplied with air to
 perform the required tightening in approximately 10 seconds.
 The Contractor shall spot check the completed bolt assembly installations at the
 direction and under the supervision of the Engineer. The spot checking shall be done to
 insure that the minimum bolt tension has been achieved in all of the bolts in the
 completed connection. The spot checks shall be made with a manual torque wrench that
 has been furnished by the Contractor and calibrated as noted herein to measure the
 minimum required bolt tension.
 f. Turn-Of-Nut Method.
 All bolts shall first be brought to snug tight condition as described in Item
 508.03(d)4. The element being turned (bolt or nut) shall then be turned an additional
 fraction of a turn as specified in Table 2. Where the exterior faces of the members to be
 joined are sloped from normal to the bolt axis up to a 1:20 slope and beveled washers
 are not specified, a minimum 3/4 turn from snug tight is required for all bolts.
 The Contractor shall furnish a calibration device (Skidmore-Wilhelm Calibrator or
 equivalent) and manual torque wrench. This equipment shall be calibrated and used to
 spot check the completed bolt assemblies as required under the Calibrated Wrench
 Method.

 Structural Joints to establish the turn-of-nut procedure when bolt lengths exceed 12
 diameters. Therefore, the required rotation must be determined by actual tests in a
 suitable tension device simulating the actual conditions.
 g. Direct Tension Indicator Method.
 The Contractor shall furnish direct tension indicator washers (also called load
 indicator washers) to be installed as a part of the final bolt assembly. He shall also
 furnish the gap measuring devices (feeler gages) to be used for inspection purposes. The
 direct tension indicator washers, noted herein as DTI washers, shall be installed by one
 of the following methods, however, they shall not in any case be installed in a position
 where the extrusions or cleats are in contact with the pieces being joined:
 Plain Finished Bolts:
 The nut is the turned element, the hardened washers are placed adjacent to
 the nuts, and the extrusions or cleats on the DTI washers are placed in contact with
 the bolt heads.
 The nut is the turned element, the hardened washers are placed adjacent to
 the nuts, and the extrusions or cleats on the DTI washers are placed in contact with
 the hardened washers.
 The bolt head is the turned element, the hardened washers are placed
 adjacent to the bolt heads, and the extrusions or cleats on the DTI washers are
 placed in contact with the hardened washers.
 Galvanized Bolts:
 The nut is the turned element, the hardened washers are placed adjacent to
 the nuts, and the extrusions or cleats on the DTI washers are placed in contact with
 the bolt heads.
 All bolts shall first be brought to snug tight condition as described in Item
 508.03(d)4. The bolts shall then be tightened to compress the extrusions on the DTI
 washers. The DTI washers shall be compressed to the point that the gap between the DTI
 washer (on the extrusion side of the washer) and the adjacent element is reduced to
 that shown in Table 3. The maximum allowable gap (minimum allowable bolt tension) is
 352
 
 SECTION 508
 STRUCTURAL STEEL AND MISCELLANEOUS METALS
 the condition where the feeler gage can be entered to the shank of the bolt in only one
 half of the number of places where inserted around the circumference of the washer.
 The minimum allowable gap is the condition where the feeler gage cannot be entered in
 one half or more of the applied places and the gap is not completely closed.
 The Contractor shall furnish a calibration device (Skidmore-Wilhelm Calibrator or
 equivalent) to be used at the job site to determine the acceptability of the DTI washers.
 This calibration device shall be calibrated as noted under the Calibrated Wrench Method.
 Three bolt assemblies of each diameter, length and grade shall be checked at the job
 site in the calibration device. These bolt assemblies shall be installed in the calibration
 device in the same manner as the intended installation in the structure and shall be
 tightened with the same equipment intended for job use. A calibration test shall be
 conducted by tensioning a bolt assembly to the point that the maximum allowable gap is
 present between the DTI washer and the adjacent element. At this point the tension
 reading taken from the calibration device shall not be less than five percent greater than
 the tension required.
 The Engineer will use the feeler gages to spot check the completed bolt assembly
 installations.
 The Contractor shall furnish a manual torque wrench which shall be calibrated and
 used to spot check the completed bolt assemblies as required under the Calibrated
 Wrench and Turn-Of-Nut Methods.

 h. Correction of Deficiencies.
 All deficiencies found during calibration, installation and spot checking of the bolt
 assemblies shall be corrected by the Contractor.
 i. Cleaning.
 All exposed surfaces of bolt assemblies shall be cleaned prior to painting with a
 cleaning solvent such as mineral spirits or turpentine. This cleaning shall not damage the
 existing primer coats of paint.
 7. Bolted Connections.
 The bolt length used shall be such that the end of the bolt is flush with but does not
 extend more than ¼” beyond the outer face of the nut when properly installed. In bolted
 connections, other than high strength steel bolts, the bolts shall be drawn up tight and the
 threads burred at the face of the nut with a pointed tool.
 8. Welded Shear Connector Studs.
 In compliance with OHSA safety requirements structural steel bridges which would
 require welded shear connector studs shall have the studs installed on all steel girder top
 flanges at the project site after formwork has been totally installed between all completely
 set and erected girder lines, thus minimizing fall hazards for workers. The required locations
 of the studs shall be marked at the bridge fabrication shop. The fabricator shall center punch
 the steel at the center of all stud locations to provide a durable marking. A highly visible
 indelible paint marker shall also be applied over the center punch points prior to shipment of
 girders to the project.
 The Contractor shall notify the Project Manager of the date that installation of the studs
 will begin in the field. This notification shall be given a minimum of five calendar days prior
 to the date of installation. The Project Manager will notify the Bridge Engineer of the
 installation date so that the inspection of the installation can be made by a representative of
 the Bridge Engineer. Studs shall not be installed until the representative of the Bridge
 Engineer is given the opportunity to inspect the preparation of base metal, layout and the
 353
 
 SECTION 508
 STRUCTURAL STEEL AND MISCELLANEOUS METALS
 location of the studs including the studs and ceramic ferrules to be used in the operations.
 The fusion areas on the top flange to which studs are to be welded shall be cleaned to bright
 metal before welding. The fusion area of the studs should be clean and free of rust. Once the
 stud welding operations are underway one stud out of every tenth row of studs on each girder
 line will require bend testing to 30° from its original axis for assurance that the studs are
 being applied properly. Any stud that exhibits a failure will be replaced with a new stud after
 the base metal location of the failed stud is repaired by grinding to bright and sound metal.
 Studs shall be one of those shown in List II-4 of the ALDOT manual "MATERIALS, SOURCES,
 AND OTHER DEVICES WITH SPECIAL ACCEPTANCE REQUIREMENTS".
 Studs shall be attached in accordance with the requirements given in the AASHTO/AWS
 D1.5M/D1.5:2015, Bridge Welding Code, Seventh Edition.
 9. Painting.
 Painting shall conform to requirements of Section 521.
 10. Name Plates.
 No permanent plates or markers other than those shown on the plans or approved will be
 permitted on any structure. Any marks or signs painted on structural steel by the fabricator
 or contractor shall be obliterated prior to applying the first field coat by cleaning and/or
 painting over the marks or signs with paint of the same type used for the shop coat.
 
 (e) Field Inspection.
 All work shall be subject to the inspection of the Engineer who shall be given all facilities
 required for all necessary inspection. Material and workmanship not previously inspected will be
 inspected after its delivery to the site of the work. Whether shop inspection is made or not,
 workmanship and materials which do not conform to the Specifications may be rejected at any
 time prior to acceptance of the project.
 
 (f) Cleaning up of Worksite.
 Upon completion and before final acceptance, the Contractor shall remove all falsework and
 other temporary construction, and shall leave the site in a condition acceptable to the Engineer.
 
 508.04 Method of Measurement.
 (a) Items No. 508-A, and 508-D.
 The theoretical poundage {mass} of accepted metal in the per pound {kilogram} price items,
 complete in place, will be computed in conformity with the following:
 1. The weight {mass} of steel shall be assumed at 0.2833 pounds per cubic inch {7850
 kg/m³}. The weight {mass} of cast iron shall be assumed at 0.26 pounds per cubic inch
 {7200 kg/m³}. The weight {mass} of bronze shall be assumed at 0.315 pounds per cubic
 inch {8150 kg/m³}.
 2. The weights {masses} of rolled shapes in the completed structure, shall be calculated on
 the basis of their theoretical weights {masses} and dimensions given in the handbooks of
 the mills rolling the various sections and shapes. The weights {masses} of steel plates
 shall be computed on the basis of their detailed dimensions as shown on the approved
 shop drawings. Weights shown on the approved shop drawings shall not be used for
 payment purposes.
 3. The weight {mass} of castings shall be calculated from the detail dimensions shown on
 the approved shop drawings, with an addition of 10 percent for fillets, overrun and
 finishing.
 4. Only the weight {mass} of materials used in the completed, permanent work will be
 measured for payment.
 5. No allowance in weight {mass} will be made for shop or field paint.
 6. For the purpose of measurement and payment, incidentals such as bearing plates,

 SECTION 510
 BRIDGES
 3. Steel Girders.
 See Section 508.
 4. Prestressed Concrete Bridge Members.
 See Section 513.
 5. Cast-in-Place Concrete Girders,
 See Sections 501 and 502. Camber due to dead load and vertical curvature shall be put

 on the plans.
 6. Reinforced Concrete Bridge Decks.
 a. Pre-Pour Conferences.
 Pre-pour conferences shall be held between the Contractor and Project Manager
 prior to placing any bridge deck concrete. As a minimum, this conference shall include a
 discussion of the rate of pour, personnel and equipment to be used, type of finish, and
 curing details.
 b. Placing Concrete.
 In addition to the requirements given in Section 501, the following shall also apply.
 The rate of pour shall be controlled so that all concrete between construction joints can
 be placed and compacted in a continuous operation before initial set takes place in
 contiguous portions of the concrete. In case of breakdown of equipment or other reasons
 necessitating suspension of placing and compacting the concrete for a period in excess of
 45 minutes for mixes without retarders or 60 minutes for retarded concrete, and part of
 the work involved is such that a construction joint will not be permitted, all of the
 previously placed concrete in that section shall be removed and replaced by the
 Contractor without extra compensation.
 A deck pour shall not be started when it is raining or threatening rain. Should
 inclement weather develop during the pour, it will be the Contractor's responsibility to
 protect the plastic concrete so that placing and finishing operations can be satisfactorily
 completed without damage to the concrete or concrete surface. Should damage occur,
 the concrete shall be removed and replaced at the Contractor's expense. The placing of
 skin patches (the scabbing on of the concrete or grout) on a bridge deck will not be
 permitted.
 All concrete deck slabs shall be placed full thickness in one operation. Unless
 otherwise shown on the plans, on R.C.D.G. spans, concrete in the girders and slab shall
 be placed in one operation.
 Webwalls may be poured and allowed to set up prior to pouring the bridge deck. If a
 longitudinal screed is to be used for finishing the concrete in the bridge deck, the
 concrete for the bridge deck shall not be placed until the webwall concrete has reached
 a minimum compressive strength of 2400 psi {17 MPa} as determined from the testing of
 cylinders.
 On all continuous spans, a pouring sequence will be shown on the plans. All lower
 numbered or lettered pours shall be made prior to proceeding to the next higher
 numbered or lettered pour. Adjacent pours shall not be made until after the previously
 placed concrete has reached an age of 24 hours.
 Simple spans shall be constructed in one pour, except on simple spans over 50 feet
 {15 m} in length transverse slab construction joints will be permitted. On simple spans
 over 80 feet {25 m}, transverse slab construction joints will be required. Where slab
 construction joints are used on simple composite spans, construction joints shall be
 placed at approximately the quarter points of the span; after pouring the center portion
 of the span and when the concrete has reached a compressive strength of 2400 psi {17
 MPa} by cylinder tests, or after four days, the end slab portions of the span may be
 poured.
 Consideration will be given to reducing the number of construction joints specified
 above where transverse screeding is to be employed; however, all requests for changes
 to pouring sequences must be submitted in writing to the Construction Engineer for
 approval. If the number of construction joints is reduced, a minimum pour rate of 30
 cubic yards {23 m³} per hour may be required, and an approved retarder may be
 required in the deck concrete.
 360
 
 SECTION 510
 BRIDGES
 During the placing operation, the concrete shall be placed in strips just ahead of the
 screed for the entire length or width of the pour, whichever applicable. A small roll of
 grout shall be kept on the leading edge of the screed so that all depressions ahead of the
 screed will be filled.
 c. Finishing.
 (1) General Screed Requirements.
 All screeds shall be mechanically operated. Screeds and screed supports shall
 be designed so that they may be pre-set to provide the finish grade and
 cross-section of the concrete deck surface shown on the plans. They shall be of
 substantial construction so that the proper settings will be maintained throughout
 the pour. Screed supports shall be placed and adjusted to properly provide for the
 deflection of forms, falsework, and structural supporting members which will occur
 during the placement of concrete. Immediately before concreting operations are
 started, the screed shall be operated over the full length and width of the bridge
 segment to be paved. This test run shall be made with the screed adjusted to its
 finishing position. While operating the screed during this test, all aspects of the
 screed and supports shall be checked for proper adjustments. After the Contractor
 has satisfied himself that the finishing equipment has been adjusted to conform
 with plan and specification requirements, another test run shall be made for the
 Engineer for the purpose of recording slab thickness and steel clearance
 measurements prior to the pour being made.
 (2) Longitudinal Screeds.
 Longitudinal screeds shall be supported at the ends by transverse headers or by
 a section of slab previously poured. Screeds must be long enough to span the entire
 pour as required by the plans and specifications. Intermediate screed supports
 between approved construction joints will not be permitted. Screeding shall be
 accomplished by working the longitudinal screed parallel to the centerline of the
 road (from low side to high side on superelevated curves) in such a manner that
 laitance, surplus water, and inert materials are removed from the surface.
 (3) Transverse Screeds.
 Transverse screeds shall be of sufficient weight {mass} to strike off the plastic
 concrete placed in front of the screed without "riding up" on the concrete.
 Transverse screeds shall be supported by vertically adjustable rails set a sufficient
 distance from the gutter line to allow free movement of the screed from gutter line
 to gutter line. Supports for the screed rail shall be located a maximum of 18 inches
 {450 mm}, center-to-center, with the slab overhang support brackets located a
 maximum of 24 inches {600 mm}, center-to-center. Exceptions to the maximum
 allowable screed rail and support bracket spacing will be considered if the increased
 spacing is adequately addressed in the design calculations that are required as a
 part of the Working Drawings (for falsework). Satisfactory means of load distribution
 with minimum rail deflection shall be provided. The screed rails for any deck pour
 shall be completely in place for the full length of the pour and shall be firmly
 secured prior to making test runs and subsequently placing deck concrete. In making
 the test runs, a "tell-tale" device attached to the screed carriage may be used to
 check the proper clearance on the top mat of the reinforcing steel.
 (4) Work Bridges.
 Portable work bridges shall be provided and used to perform finishing and
 inspection work on the bridge deck after the screeding operation. Surface tolerance
 as described in Subitem 510.03(c)6.d shall be accomplished before grooving the
 deck surface.
 (5) Final Finishing.
 The final finish behind longitudinal screeds shall be obtained by wood floating
 or by broom finish. The final finish behind transverse screeds shall be obtained by
 either wood floating, broom finish or burlap drag. Brooms for broom finishing shall
 have medium to stiff nylon bristles. The final texture shall be obtained by the
 cutting of transverse grooves in the cured concrete.
 361
 
 SECTION 510
 BRIDGES
 The bridge decks shall be grooved perpendicular to the centerline. The
 grooving operation shall not be started until the bridge deck has been cured in
 accordance with the requirements given in Section 501.
 The grooves shall be cut into the hardened concrete using a mechanical saw
 device which will leave grooves approximately 1/8 inches {3 mm} wide and 1/8
 inches {3 mm} deep. The grooves shall be unevenly spaced and randomly varying
 between 5/8 inches {15 mm} and 1.125 inches {30 mm}. The grooved finish shall be
 at right angles to the centerline of the bridge deck, regardless of skew, and shall
 extend across the roadway from 2 feet {600 mm} inside the face of the curb or
 barrier rail to 2 feet {600 mm} inside the face of the opposite curb or barrier rail.
 Each pass of the grooving machine shall be adjacent to the previous pass without
 overlapping.
 All residue, slurry and other waste resulting from the grooving operation shall
 be continuously removed from the bridge deck so that there is never a build-up of
 these waste materials. Upon approval by the Engineer, these waste materials may
 be disposed in earthwork when earthwork is a part of the bridge construction
 project. The waste materials may be tilled into the earthwork so that water run-off
 will not transport these materials from the construction site. If the Engineer does
 not approve of the disposal of the waste material on the construction site, the
 Contractor shall remove the waste material from the project and dispose of it in
 accordance with all applicable laws and ordinances for disposal.
 d. Surface Tolerance.
 The floor shall be constructed to correct elevation, including vertical curvature,
 within a tolerance of 1/8 inch {3 mm}, except that camber in spans 100 feet {30 m} and
 longer may exceed the designated amount by 1/4 inch {6 mm} at the midpoint of span. A
 slight excess of camber is preferred. As soon as the surface has set sufficiently, it shall
 be straight-edged by the Contractor under the direction of the Engineer and all areas
 exceeding 1/8 inch in 10 feet {3 mm in 3 m} from the longitudinal and transverse lines
 shown on the plans shall be marked and corrected by approved methods. The 10 foot {3
 m} straight-edge shall be lapped at least 5 feet {1.5 m} over the prior 10 foot {3 m}
 check.
 e. Curing.
 The requirements for curing are given in Section 501.
 f. Drainage.
 Deck drains or scuppers shall be installed in the gutters at locations and in
 accordance with details shown on the plans.
 g. Slab Overhang.
 The under surface of overhanging slabs shall be provided with a continuous "V"
 groove 3/4 of an inch {20 mm} in depth at a point not more than 6 inches {150 mm} from
 the outside face for the purpose of arresting the flow of water, and thus, preventing
 staining,
 h. Expansion Joints.
 Plates, channels, or other structural shapes shall be accurately shaped, in the shop,
 to conform to the section of the concrete floor. The fabrication and painting shall
 conform to the requirements of these specifications and/or the plans covering those
 items. Care shall be taken to insure that the surface in the finished plane is true and
 free from warp. Positive methods shall be employed in placing the joints to keep them in
 correct position during the placing of the concrete. Unless otherwise shown on the plans,
 the joint opening shown on the plans is the opening when the temperature of the
 structure is 70 °F {20 °C}. Special care shall be taken to insure that all expansion joint
 devices and expansion joint openings are correctly set prior to pouring the concrete
 adjacent to the joint.
 Expansion joints shall be so constructed as to permit freedom of movement of the
 spans. Open joints shall be cleared of all mortar and other obstructions as soon as
 possible after pouring the spans.
 Sealing of joints, if required, shall be in accordance with plan details.
 i. Blank.
 362
 
 SECTION 510
 BRIDGES
 j. Barrier Rails Placed By Slip Forming.
 Bridge barrier rails constructed by the use of a slip form extrusion machine shall be
 well compacted dense concrete meeting all the requirements of Section 501, except for
 the requirement for fixed forms. The forming portion of the extrusion machine shall be
 readily adjustable vertically during the forward motion of the machine so that the top of
 the barrier can be maintained at the required grade.
 Open joints shall be located as required on Standard Drawing No. I-131. Longitudinal
 bars shall be cut at joint locations to provide for 2 inch {50 mm} end cover. The
 Contractor shall be responsible for marking these locations in advance of placement of
 concrete so that sawed joints will be properly located.
 The joints shall be sawed as soon as the concrete has hardened to the degree that
 tearing and raveling is not excessive, and before uncontrolled shrinkage cracking begins.
 This time may be as short as four hours or even less in extremely warm weather, but not
 over 12 hours unless authorized by the Engineer. If extreme conditions exist which make
 it impractical to prevent uncontrolled cracking by early sawing, the procedure shall be
 revised immediately to adjust the sequence of sawing.
 A minimum saw cut width of 5/16 of an inch {8 mm} shall be maintained. On the
 inside of the barrier, the saw cut shall extend from the top to the bottom of the rail to
 the point of intersection with the bridge deck. On the outside of the barrier, the saw cut
 shall extend from the top to within 11 inches {280 mm} of the bottom of the rail.
 k. Placement of Cranes on Bridge Decks.
 A crane shall not be placed on a bridge deck until Working Drawings for the
 placement and operation of the crane are distributed by the Department. Working
 Drawing shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements given in Section 105.
 The Working Drawing submittal shall include:
 (1) Specifications of the crane and/or equipment to be placed on the structure.
 (2) Mobilization (wheel location) diagram of the crane (with respect to centerline of
 structure) as it is being mobilized for final positioning on the structure.
 (3) Final positioning/usage diagram once the crane is on the structure showing the
 location of the outriggers, and timber mat requirements (i.e. mat thickness,

 515.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) Class A Waterproofing.
 1. Preparation of Surface.
 The surface to be waterproofed shall have cured for at least seven days and shall be
 reasonably smooth and free from projections or depressions which might cause puncture of
 the membrane. The surface shall be dry, so as to prevent the formation of steam when the
 hot asphalt is applied, and immediately before the application of the waterproofing, the
 surface shall be thoroughly cleaned of dust and loose material.
 No waterproofing shall be done in wet weather nor when the temperature is below 60 ºF
 {15 ºC}, without special authorization from the Engineer.
 2. Application.
 The surface to be waterproofed shall be given a complete coat of primer which shall be
 permitted to set before the first mop coat is applied.
 Asphalt shall be heated to a temperature between 300 ºF {150 ºC} and 350 ºF {175 ºC}
 with frequent stirring to avoid local overheating. Heating kettles shall be equipped with
 thermometers and oil jackets.
 In all cases, the waterproofing shall begin at the low point of the surface to be
 waterproofed so that water will run over and not against or along the laps.
 The first strip of fabric shall be of half width; the second shall be full width, lapped the
 full width of the first sheet; and the third and each succeeding strip shall be full width and
 lapped so that there will be two layers of fabric at all points with laps not less than 2 inches
 {50 mm} wide. All end laps shall be at least 12 inches {300 mm}.
 Beginning at the low point of the surface to be waterproofed, a section of about 20
 inches {500 mm} wide and the full length of the surface shall be mopped with the hot asphalt
 and there shall be rolled into it, immediately following the mop, the first strip of fabric, of
 half width, which shall be carefully pressed into place so as to eliminate all air bubbles and
 obtain close conformity with the surface. This strip and an adjacent section of the surface of
 a width equal to slightly more than half the width of the fabric being used shall then be
 mopped with hot asphalt and a full width of fabric shall be rolled into this, completely
 covering the first strip, and pressed into place as before. This second strip and an adjacent
 section of the concrete surface shall then be mopped with hot asphalt and the third strip of
 fabric shingled on so as to lap the first strip not less than 2 inches {50 mm}. This process shall
 be continued until the entire surface is covered, each strip of fabric lapping at least 2 inches
 {50 mm} over the second preceding strip. The entire surface shall then be given a final
 mopping of hot asphalt.
 The completed waterproofing shall be a firmly bonded membrane, composed of an
 asphalt prime coat, a mopping of asphalt, and two alternating layers of fabric and moppings
 of asphalt. Under no circumstances shall one layer of fabric touch another layer at any point
 379
 
 SECTION 515
 WATERPROOFING AND DAMPPROOFING
 or touch the surface of concrete, as there must be at least three complete moppings of
 asphalt.
 In all cases the mopping on concrete shall completely cover the surface and on cloth it
 shall be sufficiently heavy to completely conceal the weave. On horizontal surfaces not less
 than 12 gallons {5 L} of asphalt shall be used for each 100 square feet {each square meter} of
 finished work and on vertical surfaces not less than 15 gallons per 100 square feet {6 L/m²}
 shall be used. The work shall be so regulated that at the close of a day's work all cloth that is
 laid shall have received the final mopping of asphalt. Special care shall be taken at all laps to
 see that they are completely sealed down.
 3. Details.
 At the edges of the membrane and at any points where it is punctured by such
 appurtenances as drains or pipes, suitable provisions shall be made to prevent water from
 getting between the waterproofing and the waterproofed surface.
 All flashing at curbs and against girders, spandrel walls, et cetera, shall be done with
 separate sheets lapping the main membrane not less than 12 inches {300 mm}. Flashing shall
 be closely sealed either with a metal counter flashing or by embedding the upper edges of
 the flashing in a groove poured full of joint filler.
 Joints which are essentially open joints, but which are not designed to provide for
 expansion, shall be caulked with oakum and lead wool and then filled with an approved
 bituminous material before the membrane is placed.
 Expansion joints, both horizontal and vertical, shall be provided with sheet copper in "U"
 or "V" form and premolded joint filler as called for on the plans. Expansion joints shall be
 sealed on the face adjacent to the membrane with an approved bituminous material. The
 membrane shall be carried continuously across all expansion joints.
 At the ends of the structure the membrane shall be carried well down on the abutments
 and suitable provision made for all movement.
 4. Damaged Membrane Patching.
 Care shall be taken to prevent injury to the finished membrane. Any damage which may
 occur shall be repaired by patching, utilizing original waterproofing methods as set forth
 above. Patches shall extend at least 12 inches {300 mm} beyond the outermost damaged
 portion and the second ply shall extend at least 3 inches {75 mm} beyond the first.
 5. Backfilling.
 No backfilling shall be done without the permission of the Engineer, and in no case, until
 the final mop coat has hardened. Backfill shall be placed in such a manner that the
 waterproofing will not be damaged. No stones, broken concrete, bricks, or other material
 likely to damage the Membrane Shall Be Placed Adjacent To Waterproofed Surfaces.
 
 (b) Class B Waterproofing.
 In addition to the requirements for Class A Waterproofing noted in Subarticle (a) above, Class
 B Waterproofing shall require a mortar protection layer as follows:
 Mortar Protection Layer.
 Over the waterproofing membrane constructed as specified in Subarticle (a) above,
 there shall be constructed a protection layer which, unless otherwise specified or shown on
 the plans, shall be a 2 inch {50 mm} thickness of Portland cement mortar. This mortar layer
 shall be reinforced midway between its top and bottom surfaces with wire netting of 6 inch
 {150 mm} mesh and 12 gage {2.7 mm} wire or its approved equivalent. The top surface shall
 be troweled to a smooth, hard finish and, where required, true to grade.
 On undercut surfaces (the underside of surfaces making an angle of less than 90° with a
 horizontal plane) the membrane shall be protected with a layer of 3-ply roofing felt laid in
 hot asphalt in lieu of the mortar covering. The asphalt used for this purpose shall be the same
 as that used in building up the membrane.
 The construction of the protection course shall follow the waterproofing so closely that
 the latter will not be exposed without protection for more than 24 hours.
 The protection course shall be cured in accordance with the requirements for curing
 concrete, Section 501.
 No backfilling shall be done until the protection course has been in place seven days.

 there shall be constructed a protection layer of plain asphalt plank 1.25 inches {32 mm} thick,
 Whole planks, in regular, straight courses, shall be used except as required to make closures
 and trim around openings and obstructions. Closing and trimming pieces shall be carefully cut
 to size. The entire surface of the membrane shall be covered with the plank. Before laying,
 all surplus talc or other powder shall be removed from the plank with a stiff brush or broom.
 Each plank shall be laid in a mopping of hot asphalt and the edge and end of planks in place
 shall be coated with hot asphalt before the next plank is placed. The asphalt used for this
 purpose shall be the same as that used in building up the membrane. Each individual plank
 shall be crowded tightly against the adjacent plank and the completed work shall have a
 uniform smooth surface without open cracks or spaces.
 
 (d) Class D Waterproofing.
 Waterproofing materials for Class D Waterproofing shall be installed in accordance with the
 manufacturer's requirements.
 No backfilling shall be done without the permission of the Engineer. Backfill shall be placed in
 such a manner that the waterproofing will not be damaged. No stones, broken concrete, bricks, or

 521.04 Blast Cleaning, Mechanical Cleaning and Surface Roughness.
 (a) Potential Hazardous Waste from Cleaning Existing Steel Surfaces.
 Historically the results of testing performed on existing coatings shows that there is a strong
 likelihood that the blast waste will be hazardous due to the presence of the heavy metals lead
 and/or chromium. Existing coatings may be tested, prior to bidding, for potential hazardous
 materials. The results of this testing, should it be performed, will be provided to potential bidders
 by plan notes or other supplementary documentation that will be included in the bidding proposal.
 All cleaning waste (blast waste, mechanical cleaning waste, etc.) shall be handled as hazardous
 waste until appropriate testing (Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure TCLP, EPA Test Method
 1311 test given in the EPA manual SW-846) has been conducted and a determination has been
 made to the contrary.
 The Contractor shall be fully responsible for all expenses that may be due to the handling and
 disposal of hazardous waste that is generated from cleaning existing steel bridge surfaces.
 
 (b) Blast Cleaning Surface Preparation for Coating Systems 1 and 2.
 Unless noted otherwise on the plans, the surfaces that are to be coated with Coating System
 1 shall be blast cleaned to conform to the requirements given in Steel Structures Painting Council
 Specification SSPC-SP 10 "Near-White Blast Cleaning".
 Unless noted otherwise on the plans, the surfaces that are to be coated with coating system
 System 2 shall be blast cleaned to conform to the requirements given in Steel Structures Painting
 Council Specification SSPC-SP 6 "Commercial Blast Cleaning". 

 SECTION 530
 ROADWAY PIPE CULVERTS
 
 530.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) General.
 1. Pipe Inspection.
 Pipe shall be laid only in the presence of the Engineer or his authorized representative,
 and shall not be covered until approved. Pipe installed contrary to this requirement will be
 rejected and shall be replaced by the Contractor without additional compensation.
 2. Grade and Alignment.
 The pipe shall be laid with ends abutting and with not more than a 1 inch {25 mm}
 variation from established alignment at the vertical centerline or from grade at the flowline.
 The Engineer will provide in the designated grade sufficient camber to prevent development
 of sag or reverse slope due to foundation settlement under embankment load.
 3. Pipe Culvert Extensions.
 The Contractor shall extend existing pipe culverts using the same construction methods
 and materials required for the installation of new pipe culverts. A pipe that extends from an
 existing manhole, inlet, or junction box, and a pipe that is extended from the installation of a
 collar shall be a pipe extension. A pipe that is extended from the installation of a new
 junction box is not a pipe extension and will be considered to be just a roadway pipe.
 4. Depth of Fill.
 The fill height for determining the class or wall thickness of pipe will be the distance
 from the elevation of the top of the pipe to elevation at the top of the base course.
 5. Coated, Paved Invert, and Concrete Lined Pipe.
 In the installation of coated, paved invert, or concrete lined pipe, care shall be taken
 not to damage the protective coating, lining, or the paved invert. Any damage shall be
 repaired with approved material or replaced as directed.
 6. Corrugated Steel or Corrugated Aluminum Pipe.
 Where aluminum pipe is to be connected to galvanized or other metal pipe, the surfaces
 shall be separated from contact by an approved type of gasket.
 7. Galvanized Pipe.
 Any damage to galvanizing shall be painted with two coats of approved galvanizing repair
 paint, Section 855, or approved zinc spelter paint.
 
 (b) Excavation of Trench.
 Details of trenching and bedding of pipe will be shown on the plans. All pipe 48 inches {1200
 mm} or less in horizontal diameter shall be laid in a trench extending at least 1 foot {300 mm}
 above the elevation of the top of the pipe. For such pipe, where the ground surface is less than 1
 foot {300 mm} above the elevation of the top of the pipe, the Contractor shall first construct and
 compact the fill to a minimum height of 1 foot {300 mm} above the elevation of the top of the
 pipe and for a minimum distance of 10 feet {3 m} in each direction from the outside edge of the
 pipe. The trench shall then be excavated as specified in Section 214. Caution shall be used to keep
 the sides of the trench vertical and to specified dimensions. Extra wide excavation to
 accommodate pans or other unsuitable excavating equipment will not be permitted. Excavation
 above subgrade will be classified and paid for as roadway excavation. Excavation below subgrade
 will be classified and paid for as structure excavation except that no payment will be made for
 excavating that part of a fill section placed more than 1 foot {300 mm} above the top of the pipe.
 For pipe over 48 inches {1200 mm} in horizontal diameter, trenching will be required only
 where the original ground is above the elevation of the bottom of the pipe, and backfilling shall be
 performed as specified in Item 210.03(d)2.
 Should the material encountered at the elevation of the trench floor not be suitable to
 support the structure, removal of unsuitable material and placement of foundation backfill shall
 be performed and will be paid for as specified in Section 214. Temporary drainage necessary for
 proper installations shall be provided by the Contractor without additional compensation.
 
 (c) Pipe Bedding.
 1. General.
 All pipe culverts placed under this Section shall be placed in a prepared bed of one of
 the types noted herein. Unless otherwise provided, a Class "C" Bedding shall be used.
 401
 
 SECTION 530
 ROADWAY PIPE CULVERTS
 2. Class A Bedding.
 The pipe culvert shall be bedded in a continuous concrete cradle conforming to plan
 details.
 3. Class B Bedding.
 The pipe shall be bedded with ordinary care in a prepared foundation bed to a depth of
 not less than 30 percent of the vertical diameter of the pipe plus 4 inches {100 mm}. The
 thickness of the foundation bed shall be a minimum of 4 inches {100 mm} in thickness and
 shall be shaped to fit the pipe for at least 15 percent of the vertical outside diameter.
 Recesses in the trench bottom shall be shaped to accommodate the bell of the pipe when bell
 and spigot type pipe is used.
 "Ordinary" care in this Article shall mean sufficient care to insure that the permissible
 variations listed in Item 530.03(a)2 will not be exceeded.
 The bedding material shall be sand or an approved selected sandy soil.
 4. Class C Bedding.
 The pipe shall be bedded with ordinary care in a loosened soil foundation shaped to fit
 the lower part of the pipe exterior with reasonable closeness for at least 10 percent of its
 overall height. Use of a template for shaping will not be required. The shaped foundation
 shall be loosened by pulverizing the soil to a minimum depth equal to 0.125 times the
 diameter of the pipe or 3 inches {75 mm} maximum. "Ordinary care" in this Article shall mean
 sufficient care to insure that the permissible variations listed in Item 530.03(a)2 will not be
 exceeded.
 Where ledge rock, rocky or gravelly soil, hard pan, or other unyielding foundation
 material is encountered at a culvert site, the pipe shall be bedded as follows: The hard
 unyielding material shall be excavated below the elevation of the bottom of the pipe, or pipe
 bell, for a depth of at least 12 inches {300 mm}, or 1/2 inch for each foot {40 mm for each
 meter} of fill over the top of the pipe, whichever is greater, but not more than 24 inches {600
 mm}. Payment for this material shall be made under Structure Excavation. The width of the
 excavation shall be 12 inches {300 mm} greater than the outside diameter or span of the pipe
 and shall be filled with selected fine compressible material, such as silty clay or loam taken
 from selected grading operations or areas beyond the right of way and paid for as Foundation
 Backfill. This material shall then be lightly compacted in 6 inch {150 mm} compacted lifts and
 shaped as specified above.
 
 (d) Placing Pipe.
 1. General.
 Proper facilities shall be provided for lowering the sections of pipe into the prepared
 trench.
 The pipe laying shall begin at the downstream end of the pipe line. The lower segment
 of the pipe shall be in contact with the shaped bedding throughout its full length. Bell or
 groove ends of rigid pipe and outside circumferential laps of flexible pipe shall be placed
 facing upstream. Flexible pipe shall be placed with longitudinal laps or seams at the sides.
 Paved invert pipe shall be laid so that the longitudinal center line of the paved segment
 coincides with the designated flow line.
 All flexible (C.S. or C.A.) pipes 48 inches {1200 mm} or larger in diameter shall be shop
 elongated or field strutted except for arch pipe and concrete lined pipe. Details for field
 strutting shall be as provided by the plans and shall be accomplished prior to placing any
 embankment adjacent to the structure. Only horizontal ties shall be used in strutting paved
 invert pipe. The pipe shall be laid in the trench with the separate sections firmly joined
 together and with outside laps of circumferential joints pointing up stream and with
 longitudinal laps on the sides. Any metal in joints which is not protected by galvanizing shall
 be coated with suitable asphaltum paint. If headwalls are to be placed, the ends of the pipes
 laid on a skew shall be neatly cut off parallel with the centerline of the highway and flush
 with the outside face of the headwalls.
 2. Multiple Pipe Culverts.
 Where multiple lines of pipe are used, they shall be spaced far enough apart to permit
 thorough tamping of earth between adjacent lines. To this end the adjacent sides of circular
 pipe shall be at least 0.5 times the nominal pipe diameter apart, or 3 feet {1 m}, whichever is
 less. Spacing for arch pipe shall be as shown on the plans.
 402
 
 SECTION 530
 ROADWAY PIPE CULVERTS
 3. Joining Pipe.
 a. Rigid Pipe (Concrete, C.I.)
 Rigid pipe may be of bell and spigot, tongue and groove, or other approved design
 unless a specific type is specified. The method of joining pipe sections shall be such that
 the ends are fully entered and the inner surfaces are reasonably flush and even.
 Joints shall be sealed with bituminous plastic cement, preformed flexible sealant,
 rubber gaskets, or other type sealers that may be approved. Joints shall be thoroughly
 cleaned before being sealed and shall be sealed for the full circumference of the joint
 unless otherwise directed.
 When joining round R.C. pipe, only rubber gaskets shall be used unless otherwise
 approved by the Engineer.
 When bituminous plastic cement is used, the interior surface of the hub, beginning
 at the lip of the normal interior surface of the pipe, shall be coated with a layer of
 sealing material that will cover at least 0.33 times the distance, measured along the
 surface of the hub, parallel to the normal length of the pipe. The thickness of the mastic
 placed shall be such that it will provide a uniform seal between the edges of the pipe
 sections being joined (approximately 1/2 of an inch {10 mm} on the inside shoulder of
 the hub and approximately 1/8 of an inch {3 mm} of material on the remaining area to
 be covered).
 When Pre-formed flexible sealant is used it shall be placed according to the
 manufacturers requirements.
 No joint shall be considered satisfactory when the space between the edges of the
 pipes being joined exceeds 1/2 of an inch {10 mm} for more than 0.33 times the
 circumference of the pipe. The inside of the joint shall be wiped and finished smooth.
 Rubber or other types of gaskets shall be installed as recommended by the
 manufacturer,
 b. Flexible Pipe (C.S., C.A.)
 Flexible pipe shall be firmly joined by coupling bands of an approved type. Joints
 shall be thoroughly cleaned before being joined and shall be sealed for the full
 circumference of the joint with an approved sealer unless otherwise directed.
 4. Inspection.
 All pipe shall be inspected before any backfill is placed. Any pipe found to be out of
 alignment, unduly settled, or damaged shall be taken up and relaid or replaced.
 
 (e) Backfilling Pipe.
 1. General.
 After the pipe has been installed, the pipe trench shall be backfilled with the best of the
 suitable material excavated from the trench; if none of this excavated material is suitable,
 material from the roadway shall be used and paid for as such, or suitable material shall be
 hauled in and used with payment being made under the classification of the material ordered
 used. For backfilling above a point 1 foot {300 mm} above the top of the pipe, material from
 the trench may be used unless unsuitable for embankment.
 Backfilling will not be permitted until authorized by the Engineer.
 2. Placing and Compaction of Backfill.
 The backfill material shall be compacted at near optimum moisture content, in layers
 not exceeding 6 inches {150 mm} compacted thickness, to a density of not less than 95
 percent of AASHTO T 99 density by methods detailed in Section 210. Mechanical tampers shall
 be used unless another method of compaction is approved in writing; inundation or jetting
 will not be permitted unless specified on the plans. Care shall be exercised to thoroughly
 compact the backfill under the haunches of the pipe and to insure that the material is in
 intimate contact with the pipe. The backfill shall be brought up evenly in layers on both sides
 of the pipe for its full length until the trench is filled or up to subgrade elevation if the
 trench is in cut.
 When the plans require stone or aggregate backfill, the material will be compacted (in
 layers not exceeding 6 inches) to the satisfaction of the Engineer. Mechanical tampers or
 vibrator plate compactors shall be used unless another method of compaction is approved in
 writing.
 403
 
 SECTION 530
 ROADWAY PIPE CULVERTS
 When the top of the pipe is exposed above the top of the trench, embankment material
 shall be placed and compacted for a width on each side of the pipe equal to at least twice
 the horizontal inside diameter of the pipe, or 12 feet {4 m} whichever is less. The
 embankment on each side of the pipe, for a distance equal to the horizontal inside diameter
 of the pipe, shall be of the same material and compacted in a normal manner. All pipe, after
 being bedded and backfilled as specified in this Section, should be protected by a 3 foot {0.6
 m} cover of fill before heavy equipment is permitted to cross during construction of the
 roadway.
 3. Protection of Pipe.
 The Contractor shall exercise necessary care in installing and backfilling pipe, and it
 shall be his responsibility to see that the pipe is not damaged by lateral forces during
 backfilling, by heavy loads operating over the pipe, or by other causes. All damaged pipe shall
 be replaced or repaired by the Contractor at his own expense at the option of, and to the
 satisfaction of, the Engineer.
 Any pipe not true to designated alignment and grade within specified tolerances, or any
 pipe that shows settlement due to faulty installation, shall be relaid or replaced by the
 Contractor without additional compensation. Any pavement that settles or breaks over a pipe
 shall be replaced or repaired by the Contractor, at the option of the Engineer, without
 additional compensation. All pipe lines shall be thoroughly cleaned out prior to final
 acceptance.
 
 (f) Jacking (Boring) Pipe.
 For pipe sizes less than 42 inches {1050 mm} in diameter, the tunneling equipment used in
 the jacking (boring) operation shall have a steerable cutting head equipped with a grade indicator.
 For pipe sizes 42 inches {1050 mm} in diameter and greater, the tunneling equipment used in the
 jacking (boring) operation shall be a laser-guided tunnel boring machine (TBM). The use of
 unguided auger-type boring equipment will not be permitted. The tunneling equipment shall also
 be equipped with a closed-face cutting head or otherwise equipped to prevent unstable soils from
 entering the tunnel.
 The tolerance for grade control shall be plus or minus 0.020 feet per 100 feet {20 mm per
 100 m} of length. The tolerance for line shall be 0.20 feet per 100 feet {200 mm per 100 m} of
 length.
 Smooth steel pipe shall be continuously welded at joints to form a rigid, watertight
 installation. Any coating disturbed during the welding procedure shall be repaired, both inside and
 outside, in a manner acceptable to the Engineer.
 
 530.04 Method of Measurement.
 The accepted length of pipe culverts laid as ordered will be measured along the bottom flowline,
 or invert, of the pipe complete in place. Measurements will be made between inside walls of
 designated structures (junction boxes, inlets, etc.) and along the centerline of the flowline of special
 fittings (elbows, wyes, etc.). The above applies to round or arch, beveled or unbeveled, pipe.
 However, in no case will measurement be made for lengths greater than the sum of the nominal laying
 lengths of the pipe sections used or for lengths greater than the length of culvert ordered by the
 Engineer. No separate measurement for payment will be made for the excavation and/or backfill
 volume needed to reroute water for temporary drainage which might be necessary for the proper
 installation of the pipe or to perform the imperfect trench method of installation.
 Structure excavation and foundation backfill, including that necessary for the installation of
 roadway pipe of a temporary nature, when ordered will be measured and paid for as prescribed in
 Section 214.
 The accepted length of pipe culverts jacked (bored) as ordered and acceptably installed will be
 measured along the bottom flowline, or invert, of the pipe complete in place. The limits of
 measurement of jacked (bored) pipe under this Section will not exceed the length along the flowline of
 the pipe from face to face of the boring pit or the length shown on the plans, except as otherwise
 directed in writing by the Engineer, whichever is less. There will be no separate measurement for

 three days after grouting operations are complete.
 Load tests shall be performed in accordance with ASTM D1143, “Standard Test Methods
 for Deep Foundations Under Static Axial Compressive Load”, using Procedure A – Quick Test.
 The axial compressive load shall be applied with a calibrated hydraulic jack. Apply the
 test load in increments of 5% of the anticipated failure load to maximum of a 200 percent of
 the foundation load shown on the Bridge Layout. Add load increments until reaching a failure
 load, but do not exceed the maximum testing load (200% of the foundation load). During each
 load interval, maintain load increments for 5 min and record test readings taken at 0.5, 1, 2
 and 4 min after completing the application of each load increment. Use the same time
 interval for all loading increments through the test. Creep tests shall be performed at the
 test interval equal to 130 percent of the design load. Remove the load in six approximately
 equal increments. Keep the load constant for 5 min using the same time intervals for all
 unloading decrements. Record test readings taken at 1 and 4 min after completing each load
 decrements. Take and record readings at 1, 4, 8 and 15 min after removing all loads. Refer to
 a constant elevation benchmark for readings of settlements and rebounds. Record them to
 0.01 in. for each increment or decrement of load.
 Test piles will be considered acceptable if results meet the following criteria:
 •
 
 No failure occurs.
 425
 
 SECTION 546
 MICROPILES
 •
 
 The ultimate pile capacity from the load test is not less than 200 percent of its
 design load.
 
 •
 
 The measured total pile head movement for the required load hold at 130
 percent of the design load does not exceed 0.04 inches between one and five
 minutes, the micropile shall be considered acceptable with respect to creep.
 For verification load tests where the measured total movement exceeds this
 criteria, the load shall be held for an additional 55 minutes. If the measured
 total movement over this additional time period does not exceed 0.08 inches
 between six and 60 minutes, the micropile shall be considered acceptable with
 respect to creep.
 If the test pile fails, the contractor shall modify the design and/or the construction
 procedure and install and test another pile at no additional expense to the Department. Any
 design modifications that require changes to the micropile type or to the structure shall be
 submitted in writing to the Bridge Engineer for review and acceptance. Any micropile
 production price increases due to design modifications and/or changes in the construction
 procedure shall be incurred by the Contractor.
 2. Proof Load Testing of Production Micropiles.
 Load capacity proof load testing shall be performed on production micropiles to ensure
 that the Contractor’s construction procedure has remained constant and that the micropiles
 have not been placed in a soil zone not represented by the test pile verification testing.
 Proof load testing shall be performed on a minimum of five percent (1 in 20) of the
 production micropiles with a minimum of one proof load test per footing. The Engineer will
 randomly select the micropile locations for testing as outlined in ALDOT-210.
 Proof load test shall be performed as described in Item 546.04(c)1. except that
 micropiles shall be tested to a maximum load of 130 percent of the design load and the test
 shall be performed in accordance with the requirements given in ASTM D3689, “Standard Test
 Methods for Deep Foundations Under Static Axial Tensile Load”, using Procedure A – Quick
 Test.
 A test pile that acceptably passes the verification test shall not be considered equivalent
 to a proof load test micropile and shall not be used in determining the number required proof
 load tests.
 Proof load tests shall be considered acceptable if results meet the following criteria:
 •
 
 •
 
 No pull out failure occurs at or before the maximum load. Pullout failure is
 defined as the load at which attempts to further increase the test load result in
 continued pullout movement of the micropile.
 
 The measured total pile head movement for the required load hold at 130
 percent of the design load does not exceed 0.04 inches between one and five
 minutes, the micropile shall be considered acceptable with respect to creep.
 For verification load tests where the measured total movement exceeds this
 criteria, the load shall be held for an additional 55 minutes. If the measured
 total movement over this additional time period does not exceed 0.08 inches
 between six and sixty minutes, the micropile shall be considered acceptable
 with respect to creep.
 If a proof load test on a production pile fails, the Contractor will be directed to proof
 test another nearby micropile. The failed micropile test will not be considered for the
 minimum five percent requirement for proof load testing of production micropiles. For failed
 micropiles and further construction of other micropiles, the Contractor shall modify the
 design, the construction procedure, or both. Modifications may include installing replacement
 micropiles, incorporating additional micropiles of reduced load capacities, modifying
 installation methods, increasing the bond length, or changing the micropile type. Any design
 modifications that require changes the micropile type or to the structure shall be submitted
 in writing to the Bridge Engineer for review and acceptance. Any micropile production price
 increases due to design modifications and/or changes in the construction procedure shall be
 incurred by the Contractor.
 3. Allowable Tolerances.
 • Centerline of piling shall not be more than two inches from the indicated plan
 position.

 SOIL NAIL RETAINING WALL
 diameter of the drill holes to meet the performance requirements specified herein or as shown on the
 plans.
 Soil nail walls used for temporary shoring and which will have a service life less than 18 months
 may be designed with the less design stringent criteria outlined in Section 570.09 below.
 The requirements for the construction of shotcrete facing for the wall are given in Section 571.
 
 570.02 Materials.
 (a) Steel Bars for Soil Nails.
 The steel bars shall be straight, solid or hollow core and continuous (without splices). The
 bars shall conform to the requirements given in AASHTO M 31, for Grade 60 or 75, or the
 requirements given in ASTM A 722 for Grade 150.
 The bars shall be either deformed bars (deformations for the anchorage coupling), reinforcing
 bars that are threaded at the end for the anchorage coupling or continuous spiral deformed bars.
 Bars shall be threaded a minimum of 6 inches at the wall anchorage to allow proper
 attachment of a bearing plate and nut. The threading for the anchorage may also be the
 continuous spiral deformed ribbing of bar deformations designed for coupling, or threads that are
 cut into a reinforcing bar. If threads are cut into a reinforcing bar, the threaded portion of the bar
 shall be 6 inches long and the Contractor shall install the next larger sized bar above the size of
 the required bar. Larger bars shall be furnished without extra compensation.
 
 (b) Coating and Encapsulation of Steel Bars for Soil Nails.

 shall replace damaged encapsulated bars.
 3. Sampling of Bars.
 The Contractor shall arrange for the Engineer to select a sample of one bar of each
 diameter bar for testing after epoxy coating or after encapsulation if encapsulation is
 required.
 
 (c) Sacrificial Steel Loss.
 If epoxy coating and/or encapsulation are not shown as required in the Plans, the soil nail
 bars shall be designed for sacrificial steel loss. The following procedure shall be used to calculate
 the effective bar properties for design:
 
 1. Obtain the values of cross sectional area, Ac, nominal (average) inner diameter,
 di, nominal yield strength, FY, and nominal ultimate strength, FU, from the
 manufacturer's data.
 2. Calculate the outer diameter, do, as do = [(4Ac/π) + (di2)] 0.5
 3. Reduce the value of do by the 0.315 inches. Call this the effective diameter deff.
 428
 
 SECTION 570
 SOIL NAIL RETAINING WALL
 
 4. Calculate the effective area, Aceff, by using deff instead of do as Aceff = (π/4) (deff2 –
 di2)
 5. Calculate the effective section modulus, Seff, and the effective moment of
 inertia, Ieff, for the
 6. reduced section as follows: Seff = [(π/32) (deff4 – di4)]/deff ; Ieff = (π/64) (deff4 – di4)
 7. Calculate the effective nominal yield strength, FYeff, and effective nominal
 ultimate strength, FUeff, as follows: FYeff = FY (Aceff/Ac) ; FUeff = FU (Aceff/Ac)
 The reduction in steel thickness shall also be taken into account for the couplers and nuts.

 Other soil nail wall specialty Contractors will be given consideration for approval. Consideration
 for approval will be given to specialty Contractors that can provide documentation that they have
 successfully designed and constructed at least 3 projects in the last 3 years where the construction of
 permanent soil nail retaining walls totals at least 1000 square yards of wall face area and at least 500
 permanent soil nails.
 
 570.06 Construction Requirements.
 (a) Site Drainage Control.
 The Contractor shall control all surface water that will affect construction of the soil nail
 retaining wall. The Contractor shall maintain all pipes or conduits used to control surface water
 during construction. Damage caused by surface water shall be repaired without extra
 compensation. Upon substantial completion of the wall, surface water control pipes or conduits
 shall be removed from the site as directed by the Engineer. Alternatively, with the approval of the
 Engineer, pipes or conduits that are left in place may be fully grouted and abandoned or left in a
 way that protects the structure and all adjacent facilities from the migration of fines through the
 pipe or conduit creating potential ground loss.
 Localized areas of perched water seepage may be encountered during excavation at the
 interface of geologic units or from localized groundwater seepage areas.
 The Contractor shall immediately notify the Engineer if unanticipated existing subsurface
 drainage structures are discovered during excavation. The work shall be suspended in these areas
 until remedial measures meeting the Engineer’s approval are implemented. The cost of remedial
 measures required to capture and dispose of water resulting from encountering unanticipated
 subsurface drainage structures will be paid for as Extra Work.
 All surface water runoff flows and flows from existing subsurface drainage structures shall be
 captured and directed separately from the wall drainage network. These flows shall be conveyed
 to an outfall structure or storm sewer, as directed by the Engineer.
 
 (b) Excavation.
 1. Safety During Excavation and Compliance With Wall Construction Drawings.
 The Contractor shall carefully monitor the excavation work to make sure that the soil
 nail wall is safely constructed. The wall construction and excavation sequence shall be
 performed in accordance with the requirements shown on the submitted Wall Construction
 Drawings as distributed by Engineer. Excavations that are steeper or deeper than those shown
 on the Wall Construction Drawings shall not be made without written approval of the
 Engineer.
 2. Excavation and Wall Alignment Survey Control
 The Contractor shall provide all the necessary survey and alignment controls for all
 excavation work. The Contractor shall locate and drill each drill hole within the allowable
 tolerances.
 The excavation shall be performed in a manner which will allow the construction of the
 shotcrete construction facing to the required minimum thickness and to the required lines
 and grades.
 433
 
 SECTION 570
 SOIL NAIL RETAINING WALL
 Where the as-built location of the front face of the shotcrete exceeds the allowable
 tolerance from the wall control line shown on the Wall Construction Drawings, the Contractor
 shall be responsible for determining and bearing the cost of remedial measures necessary to
 provide proper attachment of nail head bearing plate connections and satisfactory placement of
 the final wall facing.
 3. Coordination of General Roadway Excavation with Wall Excavation.
 The Contractor shall complete the clearing, grubbing, grading and excavation above and
 behind the wall before beginning the wall excavation. The initial excavation shall not extend
 beyond the original ground elevation behind the wall or at the ends of the wall or beyond the
 limits shown on the soil nail Wall Construction Drawings.
 Due to the close coordination that is required between the work of the soil nail wall
 design-build specialty Contractor and the forces performing the excavation work, the
 excavation shall be performed as directed by the Engineer. The Engineer will be advised by
 the soil nail wall specialty Contractor of the need for setting the limits of excavation to allow
 the construction of the wall as proposed by the specialty Contractor.
 For any required rock blasting within 200 feet of the soil nail wall the contractor shall
 submit a plan for the blasting using controlled blasting techniques. The plan shall be designed
 by a qualified Blasting Consultant deemed qualified for this work by the Engineer. Blasting
 shall not begin until the Engineer informs the Contractor that the blasting plan is adequate to
 describe the blasting and the Contractor accepts complete responsibility for the results of the
 blasting. Blasting shall not damage completed soil nail work or disrupt the areas where soil
 nails are required to be installed and shotcrete placed for the wall. The contractor shall
 repair any damaged areas without compensation.
 General roadway excavation shall be done in coordination with the soil nailing work.
 4. Soil Nail Wall Structure Excavation.
 The Contractor shall perform the excavation to the final wall face using procedures that:
 • Prevent over excavation;
 • Prevent ground loss, swelling, air slaking, or loosening;
 • Prevent loss of support for completed portions of the wall;
 • Prevent loss of soil moisture at the face;
 • And prevent ground freezing.
 There will be no extra payment for costs associated with additional thickness of
 shotcrete or concrete or other remedial measures required due to irregularities in the cut
 face, excavation overbreak or inadvertent over excavation.
 The exposed unsupported final excavation face cut height shall not exceed the vertical
 nail spacing plus the required reinforcing lap or the short-term stand-up height of the ground,
 whichever is less. The Contractor shall complete excavation to the final wall excavation line
 and complete the application of the shotcrete in the same work shift unless approved
 otherwise by the Engineer. Application of shotcrete may be delayed up to 24 hours if the
 Contractor can show that the delay will not adversely affect the stability of the excavation
 face of the wall. Placement of a polyethylene film over the face of the excavation may be
 required by the Engineer to reduce degradation of the cut face caused by changes in
 moisture. Damage to existing structures or completed portions of the wall structure shall be
 repaired without extra compensation where approval is given by the Engineer for the
 extended face exposure period.
 At the Contractor’s option, during each excavation lift, nails may be drilled and installed
 through a temporary stabilizing berm if this is shown on the Wall Construction Drawings. The
 purpose of the stabilizing berm is to prevent or minimize instability or sloughing of the final
 excavation face due to ground conditions and drilling action. The stabilizing berm geometry
 shall be such that the top of berm extending horizontally out from the bottom front face of
 the overlying shotcrete a distance of 1 foot and cut down from that point to the base grade
 for that excavation lift at the slope not steeper than 1H:1V. The Contractor may use different
 berm geometry, upon satisfactory demonstration that the different geometry provides
 satisfactory performance.
 Following the installation of nails in that lift, the Contractor shall excavate the

 excavation face of all loose materials, mud and other foreign matter which could prevent or
 434
 
 SECTION 570
 SOIL NAIL RETAINING WALL
 reduce shotcrete bond. The Contractor shall ensure that installed nails and corrosion
 protection are not damaged during excavation of the stabilizing berm. The Contractor shall
 repair or replace nails or corrosion protection that are damaged or disturbed during
 excavation of the stabilizing berm as directed by the Engineer without extra compensation.
 The Contractor shall not excavate the stabilizing berm until the nail grout has achieved a
 compressive strength of 1500 psi but not before 24 hours. Hardened nail grout protruding
 from the final wall excavation line more than 2 inches shall be removed in a manner that
 prevents the fracturing of the grout at the nail head. Sledge hammer removal of grout is not
 allowed. The use of hand held rock chippers is acceptable provided their use does not
 damage or disturb the remaining grout at the nail head, the nail bar or corrosion protection.
 Alternate excavation and soil nail installation methods that meet these objectives may be
 submitted to the Engineer for consideration by the Engineer.
 Excavation to the next lift shall not proceed until nail installation, reinforced shotcrete
 placement, attachment of bearing plates and nuts and nail testing has been completed and
 accepted in the current lift. Nail grout and shotcrete shall have cured for at least 72 hours
 and shall have a minimum compressive strength of 1500 psi before the excavation of the next
 underlying lift.
 The Contractor shall notify the Engineer immediately if raveling or local instability of the
 final wall face excavation occurs. Unstable areas shall be temporarily stabilized by means of
 buttressing the exposed face with an earth berm or other methods. The Contractor shall
 suspend work in unstable areas until remedial measures are developed.
 5. Wall Discontinuities.
 Where the Contractor’s excavation and installation methods result in a discontinuous
 wall along any nail row, the ends of the constructed wall section shall extend beyond the
 ends of the next lower excavation lift by at least 10 feet. Slopes at these discontinuities shall
 be constructed to prevent sloughing or failure of the temporary slopes. If sections of the wall
 are to be constructed at different times, prevent sloughing or failure of the temporary slopes
 at the end of each wall section.
 6. Excavation Face Protrusion, Voids, or Obstructions.
 The Contractor shall remove all or portions of cobbles, boulders, rubble or other
 subsurface obstructions encountered at the wall final excavation face which will protrude
 into the design shotcrete facing. The Contractor shall be responsible for determining the
 method of removal of face protrusions, including the method required to safely secure
 remnant pieces left behind the excavation face and for promptly backfilling voids resulting
 from removal of protrusions. The Contractor shall notify the Engineer of the proposed method
 for removal of face protrusions at least 24 hours prior to beginning removal. Voids, overbreak
 and excessive excavation beyond the wall excavation line shall be backfilled with shotcrete.
 Removal of face protrusions and backfilling of voids and areas of excessive excavation shall
 be incidental to the work of constructing the wall.
 
 (c) Shotcrete.
 Shotcrete shall be placed in accordance with the requirements given in Section 571. Where
 shotcrete is used to complete the top ungrouted zone of the nail drill hole near the face, the
 nozzle shall be placed in the mouth of the drill hole to completely fill the void. The contractor
 shall attach a bearing plate and nut to each nail head as shown on the Wall Construction Drawings.
 While the shotcrete is still plastic the bearing plate shall be uniformly seated on the
 shotcrete by hand wrench tightening of the nut. If uniform contact is not achieved between the
 plate and shotcrete, the nut shall be tightened by hand wrench tightening after the shotcrete has
 achieved initial set at 500 psi. (Initial set of the shotcrete is defined in Section 571.) The plate
 shall be set in a bed of grout where uniform contact between the plate and shotcrete cannot be
 provided. The nut shall be tightened by hand wrench tightening after the grout has achieved 1500
 psi but not before 24 hours. If headed studs are required on the anchor plates they shall be
 located within the tolerances shown on the Wall Construction Drawings.
 
 (d) Nail Installation.
 1. Contractor's Responsibility for Soil Nail Configuration.
 The Contractor shall determine the required drill hole diameters, soil nail orientation,
 drilling method, grout composition and installation method necessary to achieve the nail
 pullout resistances shown in the Wall Construction Drawings.
 435
 
 SECTION 570
 SOIL NAIL RETAINING WALL
 2. Load Verification Testing.
 Drilling and installation of production nails will not be permitted in any soil or rock strata
 unit until successful load verification testing of nails is complete in that unit and the results
 are acceptable to the Engineer. If requested in writing, the Contractor may begin installation
 of production soil nails before verification testing is complete if approved in writing by the
 Engineer. If verification testing results in a change to the original soil nail design, then the
 Contractor will be responsible at no additional cost to the Department for the installation of
 any additional soil nails required to meet the new soil nail design requirements.
 Load verification test nails shall be installed using the same equipment, methods, nail
 inclination and drill hole diameter as planned for the production nails. The number and
 location of the verification test nails shall be as shown on the Wall Construction Drawings.
 Verification test nails may be installed through the existing slope face prior to start of
 wall excavation, drill platform work bench, stabilization berm or into slot cuts made for the
 particular lift in which the verification test nails are located. Slot cuts shall only be large
 enough to safely accommodate the drill and test nail reaction set up. If approved by the
 Engineer, verification test nails may also be installed at angle orientations other than
 perpendicular to the wall face or at different locations than required, as long as the
 Contractor can demonstrate that the test nails will be bonded into the ground which is
 representative of the ground at the verification test nail locations designated on the Wall
 Construction Drawings.
 3. Allowable Placement of Facing Before Installation of Soil Nails.
 At the request of the Contractor, and with the Engineer's approval, the shotcrete facing
 may be placed before drilling and installing the nails. A blockout shall be provided through
 the shotcrete facing at drill hole locations using PVC pipe or other suitable material, to
 prevent damage to the facing during drilling. As part of the required design submittals, the
 Contractor shall provide the Engineer with acceptable structural design calculations
 demonstrating that the facing structural capacity will not be reduced and that the bearing
 plates are adequate to span the nail drill hole blockout through the construction facing. If
 the presence of a blockout requires larger size bearing plates or additional reinforcement
 beyond that shown on the Wall Construction Drawings, there will be no extra compensation
 for this work.
 4. Optional Sealing Layer for Protection of Face Of Excavation.
 Where necessary for stability of the excavation face, the Contractor shall have the
 option of placing a sealing layer (flashcoat) of unreinforced shotcrete or steel fiber reinforced
 shotcrete or of drilling and grouting of nails through a temporary stabilizing berm of native
 soil to protect and stabilize the face of the excavation. There will be no extra compensation
 for a sealing layer.
 5. Adjustments to Number and Location of Soil Nails.
 The Engineer may add, eliminate, or relocate nails to accommodate actual field
 conditions. Cost adjustments associated with these modifications shall be made as Extra
 Work. There will be no extra compensation for the cost of any redesign, additional material,
 or installation modifications resulting from actions of the Contractor.
 6. Orientation and size of Drilled Holes for the Soil Nails.
 The drill holes for the soil nails shall be made at the locations, orientations, and lengths
 shown on the Wall Construction Drawings as directed by the Engineer. The Contractor shall
 select the drilling equipment and methods suitable for the physical properties of the ground
 where the nails will be installed.
 The Contractor shall set the diameter of the drill hole that will result in the required
 load capacity of the nail and to also provide a minimum of 1/2 inch grout cover over the soil
 nail bars.
 7. Removal of Drill Cuttings.
 Drilling muds such as bentonite slurry shall not be used to assist in drill cutting removal.
 Compressed air may be used for cutting removal.
 The Contractor may be allowed to use water, neat cement grout, or foam flushing upon
 successful demonstration to the Engineer that the installation method provides adequate nail
 pullout resistance.
 436
 
 SECTION 570
 SOIL NAIL RETAINING WALL
 If caving ground is encountered, the Contractor shall use cased drilling methods or other
 suitable means to support the sides of the drill holes.
 8. Drilling through Hard Materials.
 Where hard drilling conditions such as rock, cobbles, boulders, or obstructions are
 expected or encountered during drilling, percussion or other suitable drilling equipment
 capable of drilling and maintaining stable drill holes through these materials shall be used.
 If percussion drilling is used the drilling operations shall be immediately suspended or
 modified if ground subsidence is observed, if the soil nail wall is adversely affected, or if
 adjacent structures are damaged. The Contractor shall immediately stabilize the excavation,
 wall and adjacent structures if adverse conditions occur. This stabilization shall be done
 without extra compensation.
 9. Placement of Soil Nail Bars in Drilled Holes.
 Centralizers shall be spaced along each soil nail so that the maximum spacing does not
 exceed 10 feet between the centers of the centralizers. Centralizers shall also be located 2
 feet from the top and bottom of the drill hole. Centralizers shall be securely attached to the
 bar so they will not shift during handling or insertion into the drill hole. Centralizers shall be
 oriented to allow grout tremie pipe insertion to the bottom of drill hole and allow the grout
 to flow freely up the hole.
 Each soil nail bar shall be inspected before installation and shall be repaired or replaced
 if the encapsulation is damaged. Uncased drill holes shall be checked for cleanliness prior to
 insertion of the soil nail bar. The Contractor shall provide a light source capable of
 adequately illuminating the bottom of each soil-nail drill hole. The light source shall be
 provided for the exclusive use of the Engineer.
 Soil nail bars shall be inserted without forcing the insertion in a way that may damage
 the drill hole or the soil nail bar. Partially inserted soil nail bars shall not be driven into the
 drill hole. Soil nails which cannot be fully inserted to the required depth shall be removed
 and the drill hole shall be cleaned to allow unobstructed installation.
 When using cased or hollow stem auger drilling equipment which does not allow for the
 centralizers to pass through the casing or auger stem, the Contractor may delete the
 centralizers if the grout pumped through the casing is placed using grout pressures greater
 than 150 psi or if the grout placed through the stem of the auger has a consistency of less
 than 125 % when tested in accordance with the requirements given in ASTM C 1107, "Standard
 Specification for Packaged Dry, Hydraulic-Cement Grout (Nonshrink)".
 10. Soil Nail Installation Tolerances.
 Soil nails shall not extend beyond the right-of-way or easement limits shown on the
 Plans.
 The allowable deviation of the soil nail head location shall be a maximum of 6 inches in
 any direction. The allowable deviation in the soil nail inclination shall be a maximum of 3
 degrees. Location tolerances are applicable to only one nail and are not accumulative over
 large wall areas.
 The soil nail bars shall be centered within 1 inch of the center of the drill hole.
 Soil nails that are not installed within the allowable tolerances due to the Contractor’s
 installation methods shall be replaced without extra compensation.
 11. Abandoned Drill Holes.
 Drill holes where unanticipated obstructions are encountered during drilling shall be
 relocated, as directed by the Engineer. The cost of drilling and backfilling drill holes
 abandoned due to unanticipated obstructions will be paid as Extra Work.
 There will be no extra compensation for the cost of drilling and backfilling drill holes
 abandoned due to errors made by the Contractor.
 
 (e) Grouting.
 1. Testing of Grout placed for Anchorage.
 Grout placed for the anchorage of the soil nails shall have a minimum compressive
 strength of 1500 psi at 3 days, and a minimum compressive strength of 3000 psi at 28 days
 when tested in accordance with the requirements given in AASHTO T 106.
 The Contractor shall make arrangements for an ALDOT approved testing laboratory to
 make specimens and test the grout each day that grout is being placed. Three cubes (2 inch
 437
 
 SECTION 570
 SOIL NAIL RETAINING WALL
 x2 inch) for each test age shall be produced at a frequency of at least once per every 30
 cubic yards, or fraction thereof, of grout placed. Cubes shall be molded and cured in
 accordance with the requirements of AASHTO TP 83, “Sampling and Fabrication of 50-mm
 (2in.) Cube Specimens Using Grout (Non-Shrink) or Mortar”, and tested in accordance with the
 requirements given in AASHTO T 106. Test reports shall be delivered to the Engineer within
 24 hours from testing.
 2. Grouting Equipment.
 Grout equipment shall produce a uniformly mixed grout free of lumps and shall be
 capable of continuously agitating the mix. A positive displacement grout pump shall be used.
 The grout pump shall be equipped with a pressure gauge which can measure at least twice
 but not more than three times the intended grout pressure. The grouting equipment shall be
 sized to enable the entire nail to be grouted in one continuous operation.
 3. Time of Placing Grout.
 Grout shall be placed within 60 minutes after mixing. Grout not placed in the allowed
 time limit will be rejected.
 4. Grouting Methods.
 Each drill hole shall be grouted during drilling or within 2 hours of completion of drilling,
 unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 Grout shall be injected through a tremie, casing, hollow-stem auger, or drill rods at the
 lowest point of each drill hole. The outlet end of the conduit delivering the grout shall be
 kept below the surface of the grout as the conduit is withdrawn to prevent the creation of
 voids.
 The drill holes shall be filled in one continuous operation. Cold joints in the grout
 column are not allowed except at the top of the test bond length of proof load tested
 production nails. At the Contractor’s option, the tremie may remain in the hole provided it is
 filled with grout. Grouting before insertion of the nail is allowed provided the nail bar is
 immediately inserted through the grout to the specified length without difficulty.
 During casing removal for drill holes advanced by either cased or hollow-stem auger
 methods, a sufficient level of grout shall be maintained within the casing to offset the
 external groundwater and soil pressure and prevent hole caving. The grout head or grout
 pressures shall be maintained to ensure that the drill hole will be completely filled with grout
 and to prevent unstable soil or groundwater from contaminating or diluting the grout. The
 grout pressures shall be recorded for soil nails installed using pressure grouting techniques.
 Grout pressures shall be controlled to prevent excessive ground heave or fracturing. The
 grout pressure gauge shall be capable of measuring at least twice but not more than three
 times the intended grout pressure.
 The grout and soil nail shall be removed if grouting is suspended for more than 30
 minutes or grouting is not in compliance with the general requirements for grouting. Fresh
 grout and an undamaged soil nail bar shall be placed without extra compensation if the
 grouting is unacceptable.
 
 (f) Wall Drainage Network.
 The contractor shall install and secure all elements of the wall drainage network as shown on
 the Wall Construction Drawings or as required by the Engineer to suit the site conditions. The
 drainage network shall consist of installing geocomposite drain strips, connection pipes and wall
 footing drains as shown on the Wall Construction Drawings or as directed by the Engineer.
 Exclusive of the wall footing drains, all elements of the drainage network shall be installed prior
 to shotcreting.
 Unanticipated subsurface drainage features exposed in the excavation cut face shall be
 captured independently of the wall drainage network and shall be mitigated prior to shotcrete
 application. Costs due to the required mitigation will be paid for as Extra Work.
 Geocomposite Drain Strips shall be installed with the drain strips centered between the
 columns of nails as shown on the Wall Construction Drawings. The drain strips shall be at least 12
 inches wide and shall be placed with the geotextile side against the ground. The contractor shall
 secure the strips to the excavation face and prevent shotcrete from contaminating the ground side
 of the geotextile. Drain strips shall be vertically continuous. Splices shall be made with a 12 inch
 minimum overlap so that the flow of water will not be impeded. The contractor shall repair any
 damage to the geocomposite drain strip, which may interrupt the flow of water.
 438
 
 SECTION 570
 SOIL NAIL RETAINING WALL
 The contractor shall install footing drains at the bottom of each wall shown on the Wall
 Construction Drawings. The drainage geotextile shall envelope the footing drain aggregate and
 pipe and shall conform to the dimensions of the trench. The drainage geotextile shall overlap the
 top of the drainage aggregate as shown on the Wall Construction Drawings. The contactor shall
 repair or replace damaged or defective drainage geotextile without extra compensation.
 Connection pipes, as shown on the Wall Construction Drawings, shall direct water from the
 geocomposite drain strips into the footing drain or to the exposed face of the wall. The connection
 pipes shall be connected to the drain strips using either prefabricated drain grates as shown on the
 Wall Construction Drawings or the alternate method of connection. The drain grate shall be
 installed per the manufacturer’s recommendations. The joint between the drain grate and the
 drain strip and the discharge end of the connector pipe shall be sealed to prevent shotcrete
 intrusion.
 An alternative method for connecting the connector pipe to the drain strip shall be cutting a
 hole slightly larger than the diameter of the pipe into the strip plastic core but not through the
 geotextile. The contractor shall wrap both ends of the connection pipe in the geotextile in a
 manner that prevents migration of fines through the pipe. The connector pipe inlet end where it
 penetrates the drain strip and the discharge end shall be taped or sealed in a manner that
 prevents penetration of shotcrete into the drain strip or pipe. To assure passage of groundwater
 from the drain strip into the connector pipe, the contractor shall slot the inlet end of the
 connector pipe at every 45 degrees around the perimeter of the pipe to a depth of 0.25 inches.
 Weepholes shall be provided through the construction facing to drain water from behind the
 facing. Weepholes shall be installed as shown on the Wall Construction Drawings. Drainage outlet
 pipe shall be used to form the weephole through the shotcrete. The end of the pipe contacting the
 soil with the drainage geotextile shall be covered. Intrusion shall be prevented into the discharge
 end of the pipe.
 
 (g) Load Testing of Soil Nails.
 The Contractor shall perform both load capacity verification testing prior to the installation
 of production nails and proof load testing of designated production test nails. Load capacity
 verification tests shall be performed on sacrificial test nails at the locations shown on the Wall
 Construction Drawings. Proof load tests shall be performed on production nails at locations
 selected by the Engineer. The required load test data will be recorded by the Engineer.
 
 (h) Verification Testing of Sacrificial Test Nails.
 1. Purpose and Extent of Load Capacity Verification Tests.
 Load capacity verification testing shall be performed prior to installation of production
 nails as a means to validate the theoretical nail pullout resistance. It shall also be a
 demonstration of the Contractor’s installation methods.
 A minimum of 2 verification tests shall be performed in each different soil or rock strata
 and for each different drilling or grouting method proposed to be used.
 Tension loads shall be applied to a sacrificial test nail in increasing increments. The
 movement of the nail due to the increasing load will be monitored. The load in the nail and
 the corresponding movement of the nail will be used in evaluating the proposed construction
 methods and details. Excessive movement of the nail due to the loading is evidence that the
 details of the soil nail are inadequate to carry the load of the wall.
 Verification test nails shall be sacrificial and shall not be incorporated as production
 nails. The bars installed for testing shall be epoxy coated and encapsulated, if epoxy coating
 and/or encapsulation is required, in the same manner as the production bars.
 2. Submittal of Details of Load Capacity Verification Tests.
 The Contractor shall submit the details of the verification testing arrangement including
 the method of distributing test load pressures to the excavation surface (reaction frame),
 test nail bar size, grouted drill hole diameter and reaction frame dimensioning. Testing
 equipment shall include dial gauges, dial gauge support, a jack and pressure gauge, an
 electronic load cell, strain gauges, and readout panels. The load cell is required for the creep
 test portion of the verification test.
 Where temporary casing of the unbonded length of test nails is proposed, the details
 shall be submitted to show how the casing will be prevented from reacting with the grouted
 bond length of the nail and the testing apparatus.
 439
 
 SECTION 570
 SOIL NAIL RETAINING WALL
 The Engineer will review the submittal for completeness. The requirement for this
 submittal is given with the requirements for the submittal of the details of the wall. The
 testing shall not begin until the Engineer informs the Contractor that the submittal is
 complete.
 3. Instrumentation Details of Load Capacity Verification Tests.
 The Contractor shall instrument the verification test nails to obtain direct measurements
 of axial strains and evaluate the load transfer along the length of the nails. The
 instrumentation shall be installed within both the bonded and unbonded portions of the
 verification nails. The gauges shall be installed either along the length of the nail or, in the
 case of hollow bar soil nails, within the hollow portion of the bar, after final grouting.
 The Contractor shall develop an instrumentation plan which shall be submitted with the
 Wall Construction Drawings. The instrumentation shall be installed by a qualified geotechnical
 instrumentation specialist having experience in the design and installation of instrumentation
 systems on at least 3 similar projects. The Contractor shall submit the experience record(s)
 of the individual(s) responsible for instrument installation and testing. The requirement for
 this submittal is given with the requirements for the submittal of the details of the wall
 design and drawings.
 At the completion of each verification nail test, the Contractor shall supply the Engineer
 with a plot of the load versus depth along the length of the nail, along with calculations of
 bond stresses along the bond zone of the tested nail. The Engineer will verify that the load
 transfer values used in the design are valid based on the verification test results.
 4. Load Capacity Verification Test Equipment.
 The reaction frame shall be sufficiently rigid and of adequate dimensions so that
 excessive deformation of the testing equipment does not occur. If the reaction frame will
 bear directly on the shotcrete facing, it shall be designed to prevent cracking of the
 shotcrete. The reaction frame shall be supported independently of the soil nail and shall be
 configured to allow the placement of the jack over the nail bar so that the bar does not carry
 the weight of the testing equipment.
 The configuration of the testing apparatus shall be designed so that the jack, bearing
 plates, and stressing anchorage will not need to be repositioned during a test.
 The load shall be applied with a hydraulic jack and measured with a pressure gauge.
 The pressure gauge shall be graduated in 75 psi increments or less. The jack and pressure
 gauge shall have a load range not exceeding twice the anticipated maximum test pressure.
 Jack ram travel shall be sufficient to allow the test to be done without resetting the
 equipment. All jacks, pressure gauges, pumps and load cells shall have been calibrated with
 each other within the last 6 months by an independent AASHTO accredited laboratory or by a
 Department laboratory. Calibrated jacks, gages, pumps and load cells shall have identifiable
 serial numbers to insure traceability to calibration tests.
 The nail head movement shall be measured with a dial gauge capable of measuring the
 movement to an accuracy of 0.001 inch. The dial gauge shall have a travel sufficient to allow
 the test to be done without having to reset the gauge. The dial gage shall be designed to be
 aligned parallel with the axis of the nail. The dial gage shall be supported independently from
 the jack, wall and reaction frame. Two gages will be required when the load reaction is
 placed on the face of a soil cut.
 5. Installation of Sacrificial Test Nail for Load Verification Tests
 The Contractor shall install the sacrificial test nails using the same equipment,
 installation methods, nail inclination, and drill hole diameter that is proposed for the
 production nails. Changes in the drilling or installation method will result in the requirement
 for additional verification testing as determined by the Engineer. Additional verification
 testing shall be performed by the Contractor without extra compensation. Payment for
 additional verification tests required due to differing site conditions, if determined by the
 Engineer, will be made at the contract unit price for this work.
 6. Required Strength of Nail Grout and Shotcrete Prior to Load Testing.
 Verification load testing shall not be performed until the nail grout and shotcrete facing
 have cured for at least 72 hours and have attained the required compressive strength of 1500
 psi.
 440
 
 SECTION 570
 SOIL NAIL RETAINING WALL
 Load testing in less than 72 hours may be allowed if the Contractor submits compressive
 strength test results showing that the compressive strength of the grout and shotcrete is 1500
 psi, but no load test shall be performed before 24 hours regardless of the strength of the
 grout and shotcrete. The Contractor shall make arrangements for an ALDOT approved testing
 laboratory to test the grout.
 7. Bonded and Unbonded Lengths of Sacrificial Test Nails.
 Load verification test nails shall have both bonded and unbonded lengths. The bonded
 length of the nail shall be grouted prior to testing. The bonded length shall be determined
 based on the nail bar grade and size and the theoretical pullout resistance of the nail.
 The bonded length shall not be less than 10 feet. The unbonded length shall not be less
 than 3 feet.
 8. Allowable Load on Bar of Sacrificial Test Nail.
 A test load shall be determined based on the theoretical pullout resistance of the soil or
 rock that a production nail will be embedded in. This test load shall not be greater than the
 allowable tensile stress of the bar. The allowable tensile stress during testing shall not be
 greater than 90 % of the yield strength for Grade 60 and Grade 75 bars, or 80 % of the
 ultimate strength for Grade 150 bars.
 Loads larger than the load capacity of the production bars may be required to safely test
 the theoretical pullout resistance where the minimum 10-foot bonded length is required. The
 Contractor shall provide larger verification test bar sizes if a larger bar is required to safely
 apply the load required for the measurement of the movement of the test nail under load.
 9. Determination of the Maximum Bonded Length of a Sacrificial Test Nail.
 A maximum bonded length shall be constructed for the verification test of a sacrificial
 test nail.
 The maximum bonded length shall first be calculated based on the strength of the
 production soil nail bar and the pullout resistance of the soil or rock. The required test load
 shall then be calculated based on the bonded length of the test nail and the pullout
 resistance.
 If the maximum bonded length from the initial calculation is less than 10 feet the
 required maximum bond length shall be 10 feet. The required test load shall then be
 calculated based on the bonded length of the test nail and the pullout resistance of the 10
 foot bonded length. The load carrying capacity of the nail bar shall then be checked. A larger
 size bar shall be furnished if this is required to carry the test load.
 The following equation shall be used for determining the verification test nail maximum
 bonded length:
 LBV = C
 •
 •
 •
 
 fy As/2 Qd, or 120 inches, whichever is greater;
 LBV = Maximum Verification Test Nail Bonded Length (inches);
 C = 0.9 for Grade 60 and 75 bars and 0.8 for Grade 150 bars;
 fy = Bar Yield or Ultimate Stress (pounds per square inch); (Note: fy = 60,900
 psi, 75,400 psi and 150,100 psi respectively for grade 60, 75 and 150 bars);
 • As = Bar Steel Area (square inches);
 • 2 = Pullout resistance safety factor;
 • Qd = Allowable pullout resistance (pounds per inch) of grouted nail.
 
 10. Determination of the Verification Test Load.
 The following equation shall be used for determining the Verification Test Load (VTL):
 VTL = LBV X Qd;
 • VTL = Verification Test Load (pounds).
 11. Verification Loading of a Sacrificial Test Nail.
 Verification test nails shall be incrementally loaded to a maximum load of 200 % of the
 Verification Test Load (VTL) in accordance with the following loading schedule. The soil nail
 movements shall be recorded at the end of each load increment.

 The alignment load (AL) shall be applied to align the testing apparatus and shall not
 exceed 5 % of the Verification Test Load (VTL). Dial gauges for measuring the movement of
 the test nail shall be set to “zero” after the alignment load has been applied.
 Each load increment after the alignment load shall be held for at least 10 minutes
 except for the creep test load increment. The verification test nail shall be monitored for
 creep for a minimum of 60 minutes at the 1.50 VTL load increment.
 Nail movement shall be recorded during the creep portion of the test at 1 minute, 2, 3,
 4, 5, 6, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 60 minutes. The load during the creep test shall be maintained
 within 2 % of the required load by use of the load cell.
 
 (i) Proof Load Testing of Production Soil Nails.
 1. Purpose and Extent of Proof Load Testing.
 Load capacity proof load testing shall be performed on production nails to make sure
 that the actual installation of these nails is adequate to support the soil nail wall structure.
 Proof load testing shall be performed on at least 5 % (1 in 20) of the production nails in
 each nail row or a minimum of 1 nail per row. Prior to soil nail installation on each row, the
 testing locations will be selected with the random number method outlined in ALDOT-210.
 The Contractor shall proof load the soil nails selected by the Engineer.
 A verification test nail that acceptably passes the verification test shall not be
 considered equivalent to a proof load test nail and shall not be used in determining the
 number required proof load tests.
 Tension loads shall be applied to a proof load test nail in increasing increments. The
 movement of the nail due to the increasing load will be monitored. The load in the nail and
 the corresponding movement of the nail will be used in evaluating the acceptability of the
 soil nails that are represented by the proof load test nail. Excessive movement of the nail due
 to the loading is evidence that the installed soil nails are inadequate to carry the load of the
 wall.
 2. Submittal of Details for Proof Load Testing.
 The Contractor shall submit the details of the proof load testing apparatus. The Engineer
 will review the submittal for completeness. The requirement for this submittal is given with
 the requirements for the submittal of the details of the wall. The testing shall not begin until
 the Engineer informs the Contractor that the submittal is complete. Most of the testing
 equipment should be the same, or be very similar to the equipment required for the load
 capacity verification tests.
 3. Required Strength of Nail Grout and Shotcrete prior to Proof Load Testing.
 Proof load testing shall not be performed until the nail grout and shotcrete have reached
 the strengths required for the grout and shotcrete when performing a load capacity
 verification test.
 4. Bonded and Temporary Unbonded Lengths of Proof Load Test Nails.
 Proof load test nails shall have both bonded and temporary unbonded lengths. The
 bonded length of the nail shall be grouted prior to testing. The bonded length shall be
 determined based on the production nail bar grade and size and the theoretical pullout
 resistance of the nail.
 The bonded length shall not be less than 10 feet for soil nails that are 13 feet long and
 longer. The bonded length may be less than 10 feet for soil nails that are shorter than 13 feet
 442
 
 SECTION 570
 SOIL NAIL RETAINING WALL
 long. The temporary unbonded length shall not be less than 3 feet unless otherwise approved
 by the Engineer.
 5. Allowable Load on Bar of Proof Test Nail.
 The allowable tensile stress during testing shall not be greater than 90 % of the yield
 strength for Grade 60 and Grade 75 bars, or 80 % of the ultimate strength for Grade 150 bars.
 6. Determination of the Maximum Bonded Length of a Proof Load Test Nail.
 A maximum bonded length shall be constructed for the proof load test of a production
 soil nail.
 The maximum bonded length shall first be calculated based on the strength of the
 production soil nail bar and the pullout resistance of the soil or rock. The required test load
 shall then be calculated based on the bonded length of the test nail and the pullout
 resistance.
 If the maximum bonded length from the initial calculation is less than 10 feet and the
 bar is 13 feet long or longer the required maximum bond length shall be 10 feet. If the
 maximum bonded length from the initial calculation is less than 10 feet and the bar is shorter
 than 13 feet long, the required maximum bond length shall be the length determined from
 the calculation. The required test load shall then be calculated based on the bonded length
 of the test nail and the pullout resistance of the bonded length.
 The following equation shall be used for determining the proof test nail maximum
 bonded length:
 LBP= C fY AS/ 1.5 Qd, or 120 inches if the bar is 13 feet long or longer;
 • LBP= Maximum Proof Load Test Nail Bonded Length (inches);
 • C = 0.9 for Grade 60 and 75 bars and 0.8 for Grade 150 bars;
 • fY = Bar Yield or Ultimate Stress (pounds per square inch); (Note: fy = 60,900
 psi, 75,400 psi and 150,100 psi respectively for Grade 60, 75 and 150 bars);
 • AS = Bar Steel Area (square inches);
 • 1.5 = Pullout resistance safety factor;
 • Qd = Allowable pullout resistance (pounds per inch) of grouted nail.
 7. Determination of the Proof Test Load.
 The following equation shall be used for determining the Verification Test Load (VTL):
 PTL = LBV X Qd;
 • PTL = Proof Test Load (pounds).
 8. Proof Loading of a Test Nail.
 Proof tests shall be performed by incrementally loading the proof load test nail to a
 maximum test load of 150 percent of the Proof Test Load (PTL) in accordance with the
 following loading schedule. The nail movement shall be recorded at the end of each load
 increment. At load increments other than the maximum load, the load shall be held long
 enough to obtain a stable reading.

 The alignment load (AL) should be the minimum load required to align the testing
 apparatus and should not exceed 5 percent of the Proof Test Load (PTL). Dial gauges for
 measuring the movement of the test nail shall be set to “zero” after the alignment load has
 been applied.
 All load increments shall be maintained within 5 percent of the intended load.
 Depending on performance, either 10 minute or 60 minute loading duration creep tests shall
 be performed at the maximum test load (1.50 PTL). The creep test period shall start as soon
 443
 
 SECTION 570
 SOIL NAIL RETAINING WALL
 as the maximum test load is applied and the nail movement shall be measured and recorded
 at 1 minutes, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 10 minutes. Where the nail movement between 1 minute and 10
 minutes exceeds 0.04 inches, the maximum test load shall be maintained an additional 50
 minutes and movements shall be recorded at 20 minutes, 30, 50, and 60, minutes.
 
 (j) Acceptance Criteria for Verification and Proof Load Testing.
 1. Verification Test Acceptance Criteria for Creep Test.
 The test is acceptable when the total creep movement is less than 0.08 inches per log
 cycle of time between the 6 and 60 minute readings measured during creep testing and the
 creep rate is linear or decreasing throughout the creep test load hold period.
 2. Proof Load Test Acceptance Criteria for Creep Test.
 The test is acceptable when a total creep movement of less than 0.04 inches is measured
 between the 1 and 10 minute readings or a total creep movement of less than 0.08 inches is
 measured between the 6 and 60 minute readings and the creep rate is linear or decreasing
 throughout the creep test load hold period.
 3. Verification and Proof Load Test Acceptance Criteria for Elongation.
 The test is acceptable when the total measured movement at the maximum test load
 exceeds 80 percent of the theoretical elastic elongation of the test nail unbonded length.
 4. Verification and Proof Load Test Failure due to Pullout.
 The test is acceptable when a pullout failure does not occur at the maximum test load.
 Pullout failure shall be defined as the load at which attempts to further increase the test load
 simply result in continued pullout movement of the test nail. The pullout failure load shall be
 recorded as part of the test data.
 
 (k) Criteria for Incorporating Proof Load Tested Nails as Production Nails.
 Proof loaded test nails that meet the acceptance criteria may be incorporated as production
 nails if:
 • The unbonded length of the test nail drill hole has not collapsed during testing;
 • The minimum required drill hole diameter has been maintained;
 • The specified corrosion protection is provided and;
 • The test nail length is equal to or greater than the scheduled production nail length.
 Proof loaded test nails meeting these requirements shall be completed by satisfactorily
 grouting up the unbonded test length. The Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining the
 temporary unbonded test length for subsequent grouting. If the unbonded test length of
 production proof load test nails cannot be satisfactorily grouted subsequent to testing, the proof
 test nail shall become sacrificial and shall be replaced with an additional production nail installed
 without extra compensation.
 
 (l) Work Required to Address the Failure of a Load Verification Test.
 The Engineer will evaluate the results of each verification test. Propose installation methods
 which do not result in acceptable load verification tests will be rejected. The Contractor shall
 proposed alternative methods and shall install replacement verification test nails. Replacement
 test nails shall be installed and tested without compensation.
 
 (m) Required Work After Failure of a Proof Load Test.
 The Engineer may require the Contractor to replace some or all of the installed production
 nails between a failed proof load test nail and the adjacent passing proof test nail. Alternatively,
 the Engineer may require the installation and testing of additional proof test nails to verify that
 adjacent previously installed production nails have sufficient load carrying capacity. Contractor
 modifications may include, but are not limited to; the installation of additional proof test nails;
 increasing the drill hole diameter to provide increased capacity; modifying the installation or
 grouting methods; reducing the production nail spacing from that shown on the Plans and
 installing more production nails at a reduced capacity; or installing longer production nails if
 sufficient right-of-way is available and the pullout capacity behind the failure surface controls the
 allowable nail design capacity. The nails may not be lengthened beyond the temporary
 construction easement or the permanent right-of-way shown on the Plans. Installation and testing
 of additional proof load test nails or installation of additional or modified nails as a result of proof
 load test nail failure(s) shall be done without compensation.

 charge of drilling the ground anchor holes, placing the permanent ground anchors and grout,
 and tensioning and testing the permanent ground anchor.
 2. (representing the Department) The Project Engineer, key inspection personnel, and
 representatives from Materials and Tests.
 
 (b) Installation of Soldier Piles.
 The Contractor shall either drive piles or excavate holes for the placement of the soldier
 piles, concrete and flowable fill. Piles installed by driving shall be installed in accordance with the
 requirements given in Section 505. The location and alignment of the soldier piles shall be in
 accordance with the working drawings. The Contractor shall be fully responsible for all costs for
 replacing misaligned piles and lagging that will not properly fit into the flanges of the soldier
 piles.
 For soldier piles installed in excavated holes the Contractor shall use equipment that will drill
 through soil, rock, boulders and debris that may be encountered during drilling. Blasting is not
 permitted to advance excavations. Blasting for rock core removal may be allowed upon written
 approval of the Materials and Tests Engineer. The Contractor shall provide the means and
 materials necessary to keep the sides of the excavated holes from collapsing. Casing drilling mud
 shall be used to stabilize a hole if it is unstable.
 During construction the Contractor shall control drainage in the vicinity of the soldier pile
 wall. The Contractor shall direct run off away from the soldier pile wall and areas above and
 behind the wall.
 A soldier pile shall be installed with a minimum clearance of 3 inches within the excavated
 hole and shall be within 1.5 inches of the horizontal location shown on the working drawings. The
 installed soldier pile shall be vertical within a tolerance of 1 %.
 A soldier pile shall be installed in the drilled hole and braced against movement prior to the

 455
 
 SECTION 572
 SOLDIER PILE RETAINING WALL
 hole prior to the final placement of concrete to help stabilize the pile during final placement of
 the concrete. The pile shall be centered in the hole so that there is uniform coverage of concrete
 around the pile.
 Concrete shall be placed through a tremie to the bottom of the hole if drilling mud is used to
 stabilize the excavation.
 
 (c) Excavation of the Soil in front of the Wall.
 The Contractor shall perform the excavation using procedures that prevent ground loss,
 swelling, and loosening of the soil that will be retained by the wall. Concrete and flowable fill
 placed in the holes to brace the soldier piles shall be cured a minimum of 7 days before beginning
 excavation at the face of the wall. The Contractor shall excavate in lifts not to exceed 5 feet in
 height.
 If the excavation face becomes unstable at any time, the Contractor shall suspend soldier pile
 wall construction and temporarily stabilize the face by immediately placing an earth berm against
 the unstable face. Soldier pile wall construction may not proceed until remedial measures are
 proposed by the Contractor and accepted by the Engineer.
 All drainage materials shall be installed in accordance with the working drawings.
 
 (d) Ground Anchor Fabrication.
 Ground anchors may be either shop or field fabricated. Ground anchors shall be fabricated as
 shown on the approved Working Drawings.
 The Contractor shall select the type of tendon to be used. The tendon shall be sized so the
 factored design load does not exceed 80 percent of the minimum guaranteed ultimate tensile
 strength of the tendon. In addition, the tendon shall be sized so the maximum test load does not
 exceed 80 percent of the minimum guaranteed ultimate tensile strength of the tendon.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for determining the bond length and tendon bond length
 necessary to develop the factored design load indicated in the Plans in accordance with Item
 572.05(g)1 and Item 572.05(g)2. The minimum bond length shall be 10 feet in rock and 15 feet in
 soil.
 The tendon bond length portion of the tendon shall be corrosion protected by encapsulating
 the tendon in a grout-filled corrugated tubes. The tendons can be grouted inside the
 encapsulation prior to inserting the tendon in the drill hole or after the tendon has been placed in
 the drill hole. Expansive admixtures can be mixed with the encapsulation grout if the tendon is
 grouted inside the encapsulation while outside the drill hole. The tendon shall be centralized
 within the bond length encapsulation with a minimum of 0.20 inches of grout cover. Spacers shall
 be used along the tendon bond length of multi-element tendons to separate the elements of the
 tendon so the prestressing steel will bond to the encapsulation grout.
 Centralizers shall be used to provide a minimum of 0.5 inches of grout cover over the tendon
 bond length encapsulation. Centralizers shall be securely attached to the encapsulation and the
 center-to-center spacing shall not exceed 10 feet. In addition, the upper centralizer shall be
 located a maximum of 5 feet from the top of the tendon bond length and the lower centralizer
 shall be located a maximum of 1 foot from the bottom of the tendon bond length.
 The centralizer shall be able to support the tendon in the drill hole and position the tendon
 so that a minimum of 0.5 inches of grout cover is provided and shall permit free flow of grout.
 Centralizers are not required on encapsulated, pressure-injected ground anchor tendons if
 the ground anchor is installed in coarse grained soils (more than 50 percent of the soil larger than
 the number 200 sieve) using grouting pressures greater than 150 psi.
 Centralizers are not required on encapsulated, hollow-stem-augered ground anchor tendons if
 the ground anchor is grouted through and the hole is maintained full of a stiff grout (8-inch slump
 or less) during extraction of the auger.
 The minimum unbonded length of the tendon shall be 15 feet or as shown in the Plans.
 Corrosion protection of the unbonded length shall be provided by a sheath completely filled
 with corrosion inhibiting grease or grout. If grease is used under the sheath, provisions shall be
 made to prevent the grease from escaping at the ends of the sheath. The grease shall completely
 coat the tendon and fill the voids between the tendon and the sheath. The Working Drawings shall
 show how the Contractor will provide a transition between the tendon bond length and the
 unbonded tendon length corrosion protection.
 
 456
 
 SECTION 572
 SOLDIER PILE RETAINING WALL
 If the sheath is not fabricated from a smooth tube, a separate bond breaker shall be
 provided. The bond breaker shall prevent the tendon from bonding to the anchor grout
 surrounding the tendon unbonded length.
 The total anchor length shall not be less than that indicated in the Plans or the approved
 Working Drawings.
 Anchorage devices shall be capable of developing 95 percent of the minimum guaranteed
 ultimate tensile strength of the prestressing steel tendon. The anchorage devices shall conform to
 the static strength requirements of Section 3.1 of the Post Tensioning Institute, “Specification for
 Unbonded Single Strand Tendons, First Edition – 1993.”
 Non-restressable anchorage devices may be used except where indicated in the Plans.
 Restressable anchorages shall be provided on those ground anchors that require reloading.
 The post-tensioning supplier shall provide a restressable anchorage compatible with the posttensioning system provided.
 The bearing plates shall be sized so the bending stresses in the plate do not exceed the yield
 strength of the steel when a load equal to 95 percent of the minimum guaranteed ultimate tensile
 strength of the tendon is applied, and the average bearing stress on the concrete does not exceed
 that recommended in Section 3.1.3 of the Post Tensioning Institute, “Specification for Unbonded
 Single Strand Tendons, First Edition – 1993.”
 The trumpet shall have an inside diameter equal to or larger than the hole in the bearing
 plate. The trumpet shall be long enough to accommodate movements of the structure during
 testing and stressing. For strand tendons with encapsulation over the unbonded length, the
 trumpet shall be long enough to enable the tendon to make a transition from the diameter or the
 tendon in the unbonded length to the diameter of the tendon at the anchor head without
 damaging the encapsulation. Trumpets filled with corrosion-inhibiting grease shall have a
 permanent rubber seal, as approved by the Engineer, provided between the trumpet and the
 tendon unbonded length corrosion protection. Trumpets filled with grout shall have a temporary
 seal provided between the trumpet and the tendon unbonded length corrosion protection or the
 trumpet shall overlap the tendon unbonded length corrosion protection.
 
 (e) Tendon Storage and Handling.
 Tendons shall be handled and stored in such a manner as to avoid damage or corrosion.
 Damage to the prestressing steel as a result of abrasions, cuts, nicks, welds and weld splatter will
 be cause for rejection by the Engineer. The prestressing steel shall be protected if welding is to be
 performed in the vicinity. Grounding of welding leads to the prestressing steel is forbidden.
 Prestressing steel shall be protected from dirt, rust, and deleterious substances. A light coating of
 rust on the steel is acceptable. If heavy corrosion or pitting is noted, the Engineer will reject the
 affected tendons.
 The Contractor shall use care in handling and storing the tendons at the site. Prior to
 inserting a tendon in the drill hole, the Contractor and the Engineer will examine the tendon for
 damage to the encapsulation and the sheathing. If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the
 encapsulation is damaged, the Contractor shall repair the encapsulation in accordance with the
 tendon supplier’s recommendations and as approved by the Engineer. If, in the opinion of the
 Engineer, the smooth sheathing has been damaged, the Contractor shall repair it with ultra high
 molecular weight polyethylene (PE) tape. The tape shall be spiral wound around the tendon so as
 to completely seal the damaged area. The pitch of the spiral shall ensure a double thickness at all
 points.
 
 (f) Installing Permanent Ground Anchors.
 The Contractor shall select the drilling method, the grouting procedure, and the grouting
 pressure used for the installation of the ground anchor.
 When caving conditions are encountered, no further drilling will be allowed until the
 Contractor selects a method to prevent ground movement. The Contractor may use a temporary
 casing. The Contractor’s method to prevent ground movement shall be approved by the Engineer.
 The casings for the anchor holes, if used, shall be removed. The drill hole shall be located so the
 longitudinal axis of the drill hole and the longitudinal axis of the tendon are parallel. The ground
 anchor shall not be drilled in a location that requires the tendon to be bent in order to enable the
 bearing plate to be connected to the supported Structure. At the point of entry the ground anchor
 shall be installed within plus or minus 3 degrees of the inclination from horizontal shown in the
 Plans or the approved Working Drawings.
 457
 
 SECTION 572
 SOLDIER PILE RETAINING WALL
 The tendon shall be inserted into the drill hole to the desired depth. When the tendon cannot
 be completely inserted without difficulty, the Contractor shall remove the tendon from the drill
 hole and clean or redrill the hole to permit insertion. Partially inserted tendons shall not be driven
 or forced into the hole.
 The grout equipment shall produce a grout free of lumps and undispersed cement. A positive
 displacement grout pump shall be used. The pump shall be equipped with a pressure gauge near
 the discharge end to monitor grout pressures. The pressure gauge shall be capable of measuring
 pressures of at least 150 psi or twice the actual grout pressures used by the Contractor, whichever
 is greater. The grouting equipment shall be sized to enable the grout to be pumped in one
 continuous operation. The mixer shall be capable of continuously agitating the grout.
 The grout shall be injected from the lowest point of the drill hole. The grout may be pumped
 through grout tubes, casing, or drill rods. The grout can be placed before or after insertion of the
 tendon. The quantity of the grout and the grout pressures shall be recorded. The grout pressures
 and grout takes shall be controlled to prevent excessive heave in soils or fracturing of rock
 formations.
 After grouting, the tendon shall not be loaded for a minimum of 3 days.
 No grout shall be placed above the top of the bond length during the time the bond length
 grout is placed. The grout at the top of the drill hole shall not contact the back of the Structure or
 the bottom of the trumpet. Except as otherwise noted, only nonstructural filler shall be placed
 above the bond length grout prior to testing and acceptance of the anchor. The Contractor may
 place structural grout above the bond length grout prior to testing and acceptance of the anchor
 subject to the following conditions:
 1. The anchor unbonded length shall be increased by 8 feet minimum.
 2. The grout in the unbonded zone shall not be placed by pressure grouting methods.
 The corrosion protection surrounding the unbonded length of the tendon shall extend up
 beyond the bottom seal of the trumpet or 1 foot into the trumpet if no trumpet seal is provided. If
 the protection does not extend beyond the seal or sufficiently far enough into the trumpet, the
 Contractor shall extend the corrosion protection or lengthen the trumpet.
 The corrosion protection surrounding the no load zone length of the tendon shown in the
 Plans shall not contact the bearing plate or the anchor head during testing and stressing. If the
 protection is too long, the Contractor shall trim the corrosion protection to prevent contact.
 The bearing plate and anchor head shall be placed so the axis of the tendon and the drill hole
 are both perpendicular to the bearing plate within plus or minus 3 degrees and the axis of the
 tendon passes through the center of the bearing plate at the intersection of the trumpet and the
 bearing plate when fully seated with the alignment load.
 The trumpet shall be completely filled with corrosion inhibiting grease or grout. Trumpet
 grease can be placed anytime during construction. Trumpet grout shall be placed after the ground
 anchor has been tested. The Contractor shall demonstrate to the Engineer that the procedure
 selected by the Contractor for placement of either grease or grout produces a completely filled
 trumpet.
 All anchorages permanently exposed to the atmosphere shall be covered with a corrosion
 inhibiting grease-filled or grout-filled cover. The Contractor shall demonstrate to the Engineer
 that the procedures selected by the Contractor for placement of either grease or grout produces a
 completely filled cover. If the Plans require restressable anchorages, corrosion inhibiting grease
 shall be used to fill the anchorage cover and trumpet.
 
 (g) Testing and Stressing.
 Each ground anchor shall be tested. The test load shall be simultaneously applied to the
 entire tendon. Stressing of single elements of multi-element tendons will not be permitted. The
 Engineer will record test data.
 The testing equipment shall consist of a dial gauge or vernier scale capable of measuring to
 0.001 inch and shall be used to measure the ground anchor movement. The movement-measuring
 device shall have a minimum travel equal to the theoretical elastic elongation of the total anchor
 length plus 1 inch. The dial gauge or vernier scale shall be aligned so that its axis is within 5
 degrees from the axis of the tieback. A hydraulic jack and pump shall be used to apply the test
 load.
 All jacks, pressure gauges, pumps and load cells shall have been calibrated with each other
 within the last 6 months by an independent AASHTO accredited laboratory or by a Department
 458
 
 SECTION 572
 SOLDIER PILE RETAINING WALL
 laboratory. Calibrated jacks, gages, pumps and load cells shall have identifiable serial numbers to
 insure traceability to calibration tests.
 The pressure gauge shall be graduated in increments of either 100 psi or 2 percent of the
 maximum test load, whichever is less. The pressure gauge will be used to measure the applied
 load. The pressure gauge shall be selected to place the maximum test load within the middle ⅔ of
 the range of the gauge. The ram travel of the jack shall not be less than the theoretical elastic
 elongation of the total anchor length at the maximum test load plus 1 inch. The jack shall be
 independently supported and centered over the tendon so that the tendon does not carry the
 weight of the jack. The Contractor shall have a second calibrated jack pressure gauge at the site.
 Calibration data shall provide a specific reference to the jack and the pressure gauge.
 The loads on the ground anchors during the performance and verification tests shall be
 monitored to verify consistency of load where the test load is maintained within 5% of the
 specified value. Performance test loads, and verification test loads when specified, sustained for 5
 minutes or less, and all proof test leads, shall be monitored by the jack pressure gauge alone.
 Performance test loads, and verification test loads when specified, sustained for longer than 5
 minutes shall be monitored with the assistance of an electric or hydraulic load cell. The
 Contractor shall provide the load cell and a readout device. The load cell shall be mounted
 between the jack and the anchor plate. The load cell shall be selected to place the maximum test
 load within the middle ⅔ of the range of the load cell. The stressing equipment shall be placed
 over the ground anchor tendon in such a manner that the jack, bearing plates, load cell and
 stressing anchorage are in alignment.
 The permanent ground anchor load monitoring procedure for performance test loads, and
 verification test loads, sustained for longer than 5 minutes shall be as follows:
 Step 1: For each increment of load, attainment of the load shall be initially established and
 confirmed by the reading taken from the jack gauge.
 Step 2: Once the permanent ground anchor load has been stabilized, based on the jack gauge
 reading, the load cell readout device shall immediately be read and recorded to establish
 the load cell reading to be used at this load. The load cell reading is intended only as a
 confirmation of a stable permanent ground anchor load, and shall not be taken as the actual
 load on the permanent ground anchor.
 Step 3: During the time period that the load on the permanent ground anchor is held at this
 load increment, the Contractor shall monitor the load cell reading. The Contractor shall
 adjust the jack pressure as necessary to maintain the initial load cell reading. Jack pressure
 adjustment for any other reason will not be allowed.
 Step 4: Permanent ground anchor elongation measurements shall be taken at each load
 increment as specified in Item 572.05(g)1.
 Step 5: Steps 1 through 4 shall be repeated at each increment of load, in accordance with the
 load sequence specified in Item 572.05(g)1.
 1. Performance Testing.
 Performance tests shall be done in accordance with the following procedures. Five
 percent of the ground anchors and at any other locations as determined by the Engineer shall
 be performance tested. The Engineer will select the ground anchors to be performance
 tested. The initial three production anchors shall be performance tested.
 The performance test shall be made by incrementally loading and unloading the ground
 anchor in accordance with the following schedule, consistent with the Contractor design. The
 load shall be raised from one increment to another immediately after a deflection reading.

 335; Mooresville, North Carolina 28117;
 • Vibro-Pier; Hayward Baker Corporation; 515 Nine North Court Alpharetta, GA 30004.
 Other aggregate foundation specialty Contractors will be given consideration for approval.
 Consideration for approval will be given to specialty Contractors that can provide documentation that
 they have successfully designed and constructed at least 3 projects in the last 3 years where the
 construction of permanent aggregate foundation totals at least 50 foundations.
 
 573.06 Construction Requirements.
 (a) Compliance with the Submittal of Details and Construction Procedures.
 The foundation excavation, construction and testing shall be performed in accordance with
 the requirements shown on the submittal of foundations details and construction procedures
 distributed by the Engineer.
 
 (b) Daily Progress Reports.
 The Contractor shall furnish a complete and accurate record of aggregate foundation
 installation to the Engineer. The record shall indicate the foundation location, length, drilled
 diameter, average lift thickness, and final elevations of the base and top of the foundations. The
 record shall also indicate the type and size of the densification equipment used. The Contractor
 shall immediately report any unusual conditions encountered during installation to the Engineer.
 
 (c) Excavation, Sheeting and Shoring.
 Excavation shall be extended if the Engineer determines that further excavation is necessary
 for the removal of soft or yielding areas that may be uncovered. Sheeting and shoring may be
 required to protect the site of the excavation. Excavation will be paid for under other items of
 work (Section 210). Sheeting and shoring will also be paid for under other items of work (Section
 215).
 
 (d) Construction Tolerances.
 Aggregate foundations shall be installed so that each completed foundation (column) will be
 continuous throughout its length. The center of the completed foundation (column) shall be
 within 6 inches from the required horizontal location. The vertical alignment tolerance shall be a
 maximum of 2 inches horizontal for every 10 feet vertical of depth. The completed aggregate
 foundation diameter shall not be less than 10 percent smaller than the required diameter. The top
 of the ground improvement provided by the aggregate foundations shall be within 6 inches of the
 required elevation. Aggregate foundations shall be installed in a sequence that will minimize
 ground heave. Any heaving shall be re-compacted or excavated as directed by the Engineer prior
 to wall or embankment construction and be considered incidental to aggregate foundation
 construction.
 
 (e) Modulus Test.
 A modulus test shall be performed to verify the performance values selected for design. A
 telltale shall be installed at the bottom of a test foundation so that the deflection at the bottom
 of the column can be measured. The modulus test shall be conducted at a location where the
 bottom of the column terminates in soil. Acceptable performance is when the deflection of the
 bottom of the foundation is no more than 20 % of the deflection at the top of the foundation at
 the design stress level.
 ASTM D-1143 general test procedures shall be used to establish load increments, load
 increment duration, and load decrements.
 With the exception of the load increment representing approximately 115 % of the design
 maximum foundation stress, all load increments shall be held for a minimum of 15 minutes, a
 maximum of 1 hour, and until the rate of deflection reduces to 0.01 inches per hour or less.
 The load increment that represents approximately 115 % of the design maximum stress on the
 foundation shall be held for a minimum of 15 minutes, a maximum of 4 hours and until the rate of
 deflection reduces to 0.01 inches per hour or less.
 
 464
 
 SECTION 573
 AGGREGATE FOUNDATIONS
 A seating load equal to 5 % of the total load shall be applied to the loaded steel plate prior to
 application of load increments and prior to measurement of deflections to compensate for uneven
 surface conditions.
 The location of the modulus test will be determined by the Engineer.
 
 (f) Bottom Stabilization Verification Test.
 After completion of the construction of the bottom of the foundation, or at any time during
 the process of constructing the foundation a bottom stabilization verification test may be
 performed as required by the Engineer. These tests shall be performed when a new soil formation
 is encountered, at the beginning of a project to provide quantitative information on foundation
 stabilization, and on 10 % of production foundations.
 Bottom stabilization tests shall be performed by placing a reference bar over the excavated
 cavity, marking the tamper shaft, applying energy to the tamper for an additional 15 seconds, and
 observing the downward deflection of the tamper shaft by observing the deflection of the mark on
 the tamper shaft.
 Acceptable performance is indicated if the movement of the shaft is less than 150 % of the
 vertical movement measured at the bottom of the foundation during the modulus test. If the
 measured vertical movement exceeds 150 % of the value measured during the modulus test, added
 energy shall be applied to further compact the aggregate. The procedure for measuring the
 movement shall then be repeated. If there is still movement greater than 150 % of that achieved
 during the modulus test and the movement is greater than 0.5 inches, a lift of loose aggregate
 may be placed on top of the compacted aggregate, and the verification test may be performed on
 this next lift after it is densified. If there is excessive movement on this lift, another lift may be
 placed and tested. Movement must be limited to below 150 % of the movement determined from
 the modulus test before completion of 2/3 of the depth of the foundation.
 
 573.07 Method of Measurement.
 The Aggregate Foundations will be measured in units of cubic yards. The pay quantity for
 Aggregate Foundations shall be the volume calculated by multiplying the plan area of improvement by
 the average depth of the aggregate foundations installed during construction.
 
 573.08 Basis of Payment.
 (a) Unit Price Coverage.
 The Aggregate Foundations will be paid for at the contract unit price. This payment shall be
 full compensation for all submittals, labor, equipment, tools, materials, material tests, field tests
 and incidentals necessary to acceptably construct the foundations.

 SECTION 607
 PAVING GEOTEXTILES
 607.01 Description.
 (a) General.
 This section shall cover the work of furnishing and placing a geotextile between pavement
 layers for the purpose of incorporating a waterproofing and stress relieving membrane within the
 pavement structure. This specification is applicable to geotextile membranes used for full
 480
 
 SECTION 607
 PAVING GEOTEXTILES
 coverage of the pavement, or as strips over transverse and longitudinal pavement joints. It is not
 intended to describe membrane systems specifically designed for pavement joints and localized
 (spot) repairs.
 
 607.02 Materials.
 (a) Paving Geotextiles.
 The geotextiles used in this work shall be constructed of non-woven synthetic fibers meeting
 the requirements of AASHTO M 288 for Paving Fabric, Class 2, and Section 810 of these
 specifications. The geotextile shall be selected from List II-3, of the Department's manual titled
 "Materials, Sources, and Devices With Special Acceptance Requirements". Information concerning
 this list is given in Subarticle 106.01(f) and ALDOT-355.
 
 (b) Asphalt Sealant.
 The material used to impregnate and seal the geotextile, as well as bond it to both the base
 pavement and overlay, shall be a paving grade asphalt recommended by the geotextile
 manufacturer and approved by the Engineer.
 Cutbacks and emulsions which contain solvents shall not be used. Uncut asphalt cements or
 cationic and anionic emulsions may be used provided these emulsions are used as outlined in
 Article 607.04 of these specifications.
 
 (c) Aggregate.
 If the ambient temperature is high enough to cause a bleed-through of the asphalt sealant,
 washed concrete sand may be spread over asphalt-saturated geotextiles to facilitate movement of
 equipment during construction or to prevent tearing or delamination of the geotextile. Excess
 quantities shall be removed from the geotextile prior to placing the surface course. A hot asphalt
 mix broadcast in front of construction vehicle tires may also be used.
 
 607.03 Equipment.
 (a) Asphalt Distributor.
 The distributor shall be capable of spraying the asphalt sealant at the prescribed uniform
 application rate. No streaking, skipping, or dripping will be permitted. The distributor shall also be
 equipped with a hand spray having a single nozzle and positive shut-off valve.
 
 (b) Geotextile Handling Equipment.
 Mechanical or manual laydown equipment may be used provided the laydown is smooth and
 without wrinkles or creases.
 
 (c) Miscellaneous Equipment.
 Stiff bristle brooms or squeegees shall be provided to smooth the geotextile, scissors or
 blades for cutting same, and brushes for applying asphalt sealant at the geotextile overlaps.
 When the ambient temperature is so low that the normal wicking of the asphalt sealant into
 the geotextile does not occur, a pneumatic roller may be used to ensure geotextile bond to the
 adjoining pavement layers, especially where thin lifts or chip seals are being placed.
 
 607.04 Construction Requirements.
 (a) Weather Limitations.
 Neither the asphalt sealant nor geotextile shall be placed when weather conditions, in the
 opinion of the Engineer, are not suitable. Air and pavement temperatures shall be sufficient to
 allow the asphalt sealant to hold the geotextile in place. For asphalt cements, the minimum air
 temperature shall be 50 °F {10 °C} and rising. When using asphalt emulsions, the minimum air
 temperature shall be 60 °F {15 °C} and rising.
 
 (b) Surface Preparation.
 The surface on which the geotextile is to be placed shall be free of dirt, water, vegetation, or
 other debris. Cracks exceeding 1/8 inch {3 mm} in width shall be filled with a rubberized joint
 sealer meeting the requirements of ASTM D 6690, for Type II sealant. Potholes shall be properly
 repaired as directed by the Engineer. The joint sealer shall be allowed to cure prior to geotextile
 placement.
 
 (c) Application of Asphalt Sealant.
 The asphalt sealant shall be spray applied uniformly to the prepared dry pavement surface at
 the rate of 0.20 to 0.30 gallons per square yard {0.9 to 1.36 L/m²} or as recommended by the
 481
 
 SECTION 607
 PAVING GEOTEXTILES
 geotextile manufacturers and approved by the Engineer. The recommended application for asphalt
 cements is 0.20 gallons per square yard {0.9 L/m²} with rough and ravelled surfaces requiring a
 higher application. When using emulsions, the application rate shall be increased to offset the
 water content of the emulsion.
 Application of the sealant shall be by distributor spray bar, with hand spraying kept to a
 minimum. Temperature of the sealant shall be sufficiently high to permit a uniform spray pattern.
 For asphalt cements, the minimum temperature shall be 290 °F {143 °C}. To avoid damage to
 the geotextile, however, distributor tank temperatures shall not exceed 325 °F {163 °C}. Spray
 patterns for asphalt emulsion can be improved by heating. Temperatures in the 130 to 150 °F {54
 to 71 °C} range are recommended. A temperature of 160 °F {71 °C} shall not be exceeded since
 higher temperatures may break the emulsion.
 The target width of asphalt sealant application shall be 6 inches {150 mm} wider than the
 geotextile width. The sealant shall not be applied any farther in advance of geotextile placement
 than the distance which the Contractor can maintain free of traffic.
 Asphalt spills shall be cleaned from the road surface to avoid flushing and geotextile
 movement.
 When asphalt emulsions are used, the emulsion shall be cured (essentially no water
 remaining) prior to placing the geotextile and final wearing surface.
 
 (d) Geotextile Placement.
 The geotextile shall be placed into the asphalt sealant with minimum wrinkling prior to the
 time the asphalt has cooled and lost tackiness. As directed by the Engineer, wrinkles or folds in
 excess of 1 inch {25 mm} shall be split and laid flat. Brooming and/or pneumatic rolling will be
 required to maximize geotextile contact with the pavement surface.
 Overlap of geotextile joints shall be sufficient to ensure full closure of the joint, but should
 not exceed 6 inches {150 mm}. Transverse joints shall be lapped in the direction of paving to
 prevent edge pickup by the paver. A second application of asphalt sealant to geotextile overlaps
 will be required, if in the judgement of the Engineer, additional asphalt sealant is needed to
 ensure proper bonding of the double geotextile layer. Removal and replacement of damaged
 geotextile will be the responsibility of the Contractor.
 Trafficking the geotextile will be permitted for emergency or construction equipment only.
 
 (e) Asphalt Overlay.
 Placement of the hot mix overlay shall closely follow geotextile laydown. The temperature of
 the mix shall not exceed 325 °C {163 °C}. In the event asphalt bleeds through the geotextile
 causing construction problems before the overlay is placed, the affected areas shall be blotted by
 spreading sand or hot-mix. To avoid movement or damage to the geotextile membrane, turning of
 the paver and other vehicles shall be gradual and kept to a minimum.
 
 (f) Seal Coats.
 Prior to placing a seal coat (or thin overlay such as an open-graded friction course), the
 geotextile shall be lightly sanded at a spread rate of 1.5 to 2.0 pounds per square yard {0.8 to
 1.1 kg/m²} and pneumatically rolled so as to embed the geotextile tightly into the sealant.
 
 607.05 Method of Measurement.
 The paving geotextile will be measured by the square yard {square meter}.
 Asphalt sealant for the paving geotextile will be measured by the gallon {liter}.
 
 607.06 Basis of Payment.
 (a) General.
 The accepted quantities of paving geotextiles will be paid for at the contract unit price per
 square yard {square meter} in place. Accepted quantities of asphalt sealant for the paving
 geotextile will be paid for at the contract unit price per gallon {liter} complete in place.

 608.01 Description.
 This section shall cover the furnishing and placing of geotextiles for use as a permeable separator
 to prevent mixing of dissimilar materials such as subgrades and surfaced and unsurfaced pavement
 structures, zones in embankments, foundations, and select fill materials. The geotextiles shall be
 designed to allow passage of water while retaining in situ soil without clogging.
 When used as a soil stabilizer, a detailed design process shall be followed taking into consideration
 the separation function of the geotextile, along with its filtration and reinforcement functions.
 
 608.02 Materials.
 The geotextile shall meet the requirements of AASHTO M 288 for Separation Applications, Class 2,
 and Section 810 of these Specifications. The geotextile shall be selected from List II-3, of the
 Department's manual titled "Materials, Sources, and Devices With Special Acceptance Requirements".
 Information concerning this list is given in Subarticle 106.01(f) and ALDOT-355.
 
 608.03 Construction Requirements.
 The installation site shall be prepared by clearing and grading the area as required. All sharp
 objects and large stones shall be removed and trees and shrubs shall be cut flush with the subgrade.
 The removal of top soil and vegetation is not necessary.
 When appropriate, soft spots and unsuitable areas shall be identified during site preparation or
 subsequent proof rolling. These areas shall be excavated and backfilled with select material which is
 compacted to a depth such that the area provides equal stability as the adjacent area. Stabilization of
 these areas may be enhanced by use of a geotextile at the bottom of the excavation before backfill.
 
 608.04 Installation.
 The geotextile shall be unrolled as smoothly as possible on the prepared subgrade in the direction
 of the construction traffic. Adjacent geotextile rolls shall be overlapped in the direction of subbase
 placement using the following guide:
 Required Overlaps
 Soil Strength
 Unsewn Overlap

 The geotextile may be held in place prior to subbase placement by pins, staples, or piles of fill or
 rock. Geotextiles may be folded or cut to conform to any curvature of the area. A fold or overlap shall
 be in the direction of construction and held in place as prescribed above.
 
 608.05 Seams.
 Both factory and field sewn or sealed seams shall conform to the strength requirements of Table 1
 as outlined in AASHTO M 288 for Separation Applications. All seams shall be subject to the approval of
 the Engineer.
 
 608.06 Subbase Placement.
 The subbase shall be placed by end dumping onto the geotextile from the edge of the geotextile,
 or over previously placed subbase aggregate. On subgrades having a CBR of 1, the subbase aggregate
 shall be spread simultaneously with dumping to minimize the potential of a localized subgrade failure.
 Direct traffic on the geotextile, along with any sudden stops, starts, or turns on the subbase material
 by construction equipment, shall be avoided where possible. Using whatever means, the subbase
 material shall be spread from the back dumped pile. Except in the case of low volume roads (ADT <
 200), a minimum thickness of 6 inches {150 mm} shall be maintained. In the case of low volume roads,
 this thickness shall be 4 inches {100 mm}. A smooth drum roller shall be used to achieve the specified
 density. Any ruts occurring during construction shall be filled with additional subbase material and
 483
 
 SECTION 609

 609.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) Preparation of Surface.
 The slope to be treated shall be prepared by removing vegetation, topsoil, and dressing the
 slope to reasonable line and grade. The surface shall then be compacted, if necessary, by the use
 of mechanical tampers to the satisfaction of the Engineer before placement of the geotextile
 filter and aggregate blanket. The dressing and preparation of the slope shall be considered
 incidental to the placement of the Aggregate Protection Blanket and no direct payment for such
 will be made.
 Where grading has been completed under another contract and regrading is necessary to
 obtain the desired uniform slope, such regrading shall be considered incidental to the placement
 of the aggregate protection blanket and no direct payment for such will be made.
 
 (b) Placement of Geotextile Filter.
 The geotextile filter, if required, shall be placed in the manner and at the locations shown on
 the plans or as directed by the Engineer. Exposure of the geotextile to the elements between lay
 down and cover shall be a maximum of 14 days to minimize damage potential. At the time of
 installation, filter shall be rejected if it has defects, rips, holes, flaws, deterioration, or damage
 incurred during manufacture, transportation, or storage. The filter shall be placed with the long
 dimension horizontal with the natural ground line, unless otherwise directed by the Engineer, and
 shall be laid smooth and free of tension, stress, folds, wrinkles or creases. The strips shall be
 placed to provide a minimum width of 3 feet {1 m} of overlap for each joint. Overlap joints and
 seams shall be measured as a single layer of cloth. Securing pins with washers shall be inserted
 through both strips of overlapped cloth at not greater than the following intervals along a line
 through the midpoint of the overlap.
 Pin Spacing

 The filter shall be turned down and buried approximately 12 inches {300 mm} at all exterior
 limits.
 Additional pins, regardless of location, shall be installed as necessary to prevent any slippage
 of the geotextile filter. Each securing pin shall be pushed through the filter until the washer bears
 against the filter and secures it firmly to the foundation. The filter shall be protected at all times
 during construction from contamination by surface runoff and any filter so contaminated shall be
 removed and replaced with uncontaminated filter. Any damage to the filter during its installation
 or during placement of riprap shall be replaced by the Contractor. The work shall be scheduled so
 that 30 days does not expire between placement of the filter and the covering of the filter with
 the graded aggregate. Aggregate shall not be dropped on the filter from a height greater than 1
 foot {300 mm}. Greater drop heights will be permitted if the Contractor provides a cushioning
 layer of sand on top of the filter before dumping of stone. The combination of drop height for
 stone and sand cushion layer thickness to be approved shall be demonstrated to not puncture or
 damage the filter. No measurement or separate payment shall be made for a sand cushion layer
 placed for the purpose of allowing an increased drop height of stones. Any damage to the
 geotextile filter during placement of aggregate shall be corrected prior to proceeding with the
 work.
 
 (c) Placement of Aggregate.
 The method of placement of the aggregate shall be at the option of the Contractor provided
 it produces uniform coverage and depth without damaging the geotextile filter, if present.
 485
 
 SECTION 610

 SECTION 610
 RIPRAP
 Slopes which require a geotextile blanket under the riprap shall, in addition to the above, be
 prepared as noted in Subarticle (b) below.
 Placement of any riprap on a filter blanket shall be by such means that will not damage or
 destroy the blanket. Any damage to the blanket shall be repaired without additional
 compensation.
 Unless otherwise authorized or directed by the Engineer, riprap protection for bridge ends
 shall be placed immediately following the grading operations. The bridge Contractor shall protect
 any slope protection material in place during the bridge construction and shall be responsible for
 any damage due to negligence on the part of his operations.
 If directed by the Engineer or shown by plan details, all outer edges and the top of riprap
 where the riprap terminates shall be formed so that the surface of the riprap will be embedded
 and even with the surface of the ground and/or slope.
 All riprap construction shall begin at the bottom of the slope and progress upward.
 
 (b) Filter Blanket.
 1. General.
 Unless otherwise specified by the plans or ordered in writing, the Contractor may select
 one of the filter blanket materials provided in Article 814.03 for construction of the filter
 blanket except that a geotextile blanket will not be allowed for soils with 85% by weight
 {mass} passing the #200 {75 µm} sieve.
 If an aggregate blanket is used, the blanket shall be constructed using the designated
 material to a minimum thickness of 6 inches {150 mm}, unless otherwise shown by the plans,
 all in accordance with the provisions noted in this Subarticle and the plan details.
 If a geotextile filter is used, it shall conform with Article 610.02 of this Section.
 2. Foundation Preparation.
 Areas on which filter blankets are to be placed shall be uniformly trimmed and dressed
 to conform to cross sections shown by the plans within an allowable tolerance of plus or
 minus 3 inches {75 mm} from the theoretical slope lines and grades.
 3. Placement.
 a. Aggregate Blankets (Gravel or Crushed Stone).
 Filter blanket material shall be spread uniformly on the prepared base, in a
 satisfactory manner, to a thickness of not less than 1/2 of an inch {10 mm} from that
 specified and to neat lines as indicated on the plans. Placing or spreading of material by
 methods which will tend to segregate particle sizes within the filter layer will not be
 permitted. Any damage to the surfaces of the filter blanket foundation during the
 placing of the filter blanket shall be repaired before proceeding with the work.
 Compaction of the filter material will not be required, but shall be finished to present a
 reasonably even surface free from mounds, depressions, or windrows.
 b. Geotextile Filter.
 Exposure of geotextiles to the elements between lay down and cover shall be a
 maximum of 14 days to minimize damage potential.
 The geotextile shall be placed and anchored on a smooth graded surface approved
 by the Engineer. The geotextile shall be placed in such a manner that placement of the
 overlying materials will not excessively stretch or tear the filter. Anchoring of the
 terminal ends of the geotextile shall be accomplished through the use of key trenches or
 aprons at the crest and toe of the slope. In certain applications, 18 inch {450 mm} long
 anchoring pins, placed on 2 to 6 foot {1 to 2 m} centers, depending on the slope of the
 covered area, should be used to expedite construction.
 Successive geotextile sheets shall be overlapped in such a manner that the upstream
 sheet is placed over the downstream sheet and/or upslope over downslope. In
 underwater applications, the geotextile and required thickness of backfill material shall
 be placed the same day. The backfill placement shall begin at the toe and proceed up
 the slope.
 Riprap and heavy stone filling shall not be dropped onto the geotextile from the
 height of more than 1 foot {300 mm}. Slope protection and smaller sizes of stone filling
 shall not be dropped onto the geotextile from a height exceeding 3 feet {1 m}. Any
 
 487
 
 SECTION 610
 RIPRAP
 geotextile damaged during placement shall be replaced as directed by the Engineer at
 the Contractor's expense.
 The geotextile shall be joined by either sewing or overlapping. All seams shall be
 subject to the approval of the Engineer.
 Overlapped seams shall have a minimum overlap of 12 inches {300 mm} except
 where placed underwater where the overlap shall be a minimum of 3 feet {1 m}.
 A geotextile patch shall be placed over the damaged area and extend 3 feet {1 m}
 beyond the perimeter of the tear or damage.
 
 (c) Stone Riprap.
 1. General.
 Unless otherwise shown by the plan details or directed, stone riprap shall not be placed
 on slopes steeper than the natural angle of repose of the riprap material.
 Placement of stones may, unless otherwise noted in this Subarticle, be placed by
 methods and equipment approved by the Engineer suitable for the purpose of placing the
 riprap in accordance with the requirements for the class riprap involved without damaging
 any existing facility or construction feature.
 2. Class 1.
 Class 1 riprap is essentially designed for hand placement and use with minimal water
 currents. Stones shall be laid with close broken joints and resting on the embankment slope.
 The stones shall be of such shape and shall be so laid as to produce a single layer of stone of
 the thickness shown on the plans, measured perpendicular to the slope. The bottom course
 shall be laid in a trench excavated to such depth below the toe of the slope that all parts of
 the bottom course will be 3 feet {1 m} below the toe. Trenching will not be required where
 the toe of the slope is below water level. The back of the trench shall be on the same slope
 as the fill. The laying of the courses shall progress upward, the larger stones being placed in
 the lower courses. The individual pieces of stone in each horizontal course shall be laid so
 that they will break joints with the stones in the course below the tops sloped to drain away
 from embankment. Open joints shall be filled with spalls, or small stones in such manner that
 all stones are tightly wedged or keyed. The finished surface shall present a reasonably
 uniform appearance and shall not vary more than 6 inches {150 mm} from the average
 surface. The finished surface at the ends of the riprap shall be flush with the adjacent earth
 fill surface.
 3. Class 2 and 3.
 Class 2 and 3 riprap is designed for use in areas with minimal to medium water currents
 and wave action. The stones shall be placed in such a manner as to produce a reasonably well
 graded mass of rock with the minimum practical percentage of voids. The riprap shall be
 constructed to the lines, grades and thickness shown by the plans or directed within a
 tolerance of plus 15 inches {375 mm} or minus 3 inches {75 mm} from the designated finish
 surface of the riprap, except that either extreme of such tolerance shall be reached as a
 uniform rate over an area greater than 200 square feet {19 m²}. Riprap shall be placed in its

 be occupied by the concrete. The subgrade shall be moist but not wet or muddy. After
 mixing, the concrete shall be placed in the forms and shall be tamped, spaded, or vibrated
 sufficiently to produce a dense homogeneous mass and to bring the mortar to the surface.
 Particular attention shall be given to spading the concrete along and against the surface of
 the forms to prevent honeycombing and secure a smooth, uniform surface.
 2. Strike-Off and Finishing.
 When the forms are filled, the concrete shall be struck off with a template, cut to the
 curb edge design. The exposed concrete surface shall then be finished smooth with a wooden
 float in a manner that will compact the mass and produce a true, even top surface. Plastering
 with mortar to build up or finish will not be permitted. The surface of the gutter and the face
 and top of the curb shall be checked with a 10 foot {3 m} straightedge and any irregularities
 more than 1/4 of an inch in 10 feet {6 mm in 3 m} corrected. The alignment and grade shall
 not at any point vary more than 1/2 of an inch {10 mm} from that established by the
 elevation control stakes. Excessive troweling with a steel trowel will not be permitted. A
 textured finish shall be provided on the exposed surface just before the concrete becomes
 nonplastic by the use of a burlap or cotton fabric drag, brush, or broom which will produce a
 uniform gritty texture along the length of the curb, gutter, or combination curb and gutter.
 The upper edges of curb and gutter shall be rounded with an approved edging tool to the
 radius shown on the plans. The joint templates shall be set during the placing of the concrete
 and allowed to remain in place until the concrete has set sufficiently to hold its shape, but
 shall be removed while the forms are still in place.
 The forms shall be left in place until the concrete has set sufficiently so that they can be
 removed without damage to the work, but, unless otherwise directed, they shall be removed
 within 24 hours after the concrete has been placed. Immediately after the removal of the
 forms, the repair of any minor defective areas shall be accomplished.
 
 (i) Placing and Finishing Concrete - Machine Laid.
 The requirements of Subarticle 623.03(h) are applicable except that fixed forms are not
 required.
 
 (j) Curing and Protection.
 Immediately after the finishing operation is completed, the concrete shall be cured as
 provided by Subarticle 450.03(m). If mats are used, they shall be kept continuously moist for a
 period of at least 72 hours. During this period, and until completion and acceptance of the work,
 it shall be protected from damage by the elements or other cause.

 GUARDRAIL OR BARRIER RAIL RELOCATED
 The intent of this specification is that each guardrail or barrier rail installation erected under
 traffic be completed, including end anchors and/or attenuating devices, before nightfall of the
 day on which work on that installation began. In the event that unforeseen conditions prevent the
 completion of an installation before nightfall, the Contractor will be required, at his expense, to
 protect and delineate the uncompleted installation by the use of reflectorized devices or other
 acceptable means. The minimum requirement for this protection and delineation will be one or
 more reflectorized drums with a Type B warning light on each drum.
 If the existing guardrail or barrier rail is to be removed and reset, replaced, or relocated,
 then only one installation ahead of the placing operation may be removed. At any site where the
 rail has been removed and the new installation has not been completed, the Contractor will be
 required at his expense to protect the site with reflectorized drums, with a Type B warning light
 on each drum, as shown on the plans or directed by the Engineer.
 
 630.04 Method of Measurement.
 Posts will not be measured for payment separately. The length of the beam guardrail or barrier
 rail constructed and accepted will be measured in linear feet {meters} to the nearest 0.1 foot {0.1 m}
 from the end of each continuous installation, exclusive of designated anchor assemblies along the
 centerline of the top of the rail posts for guardrail and of the rail element for barrier rail.
 Standard guardrail installations cover one rail element, its supports (post) and accessories. When
 installations are to cover special installations such as double faced rail (two rail elements) mounted on
 a single post, a separate pay item will be provided and the special condition so noted in the description
 of the pay item.

 After grading and topsoil placement and prior to ground preparation, the Contractor
 shall remove all boulders, stumps, roots, or other objects with any dimension larger than 2
 inches {50 mm}. Topsoil shall meet the requirements given in Section 650.
 Ground preparation shall consist of cultivating the topsoil to a loose depth of at least 4
 inches {100 mm} except on slopes 2:1 or steeper. The plowing, harrowing, cultivating, and all
 other operations shall be performed with proper equipment and in such a manner as to break
 up all clods.
 The ground shall be plowed to the required depth and then cultivated with a rotary tiller
 or disk harrow, in crossing directions if necessary, until the result is a smooth, uniform, loose,
 and well broken soil providing a suitable bed for seed. In small or inaccessible areas the use
 of hand tools will be permitted. The Contractor shall add water as necessary to provide
 sufficient soil moisture to prepare the ground.
 All trash and other debris shall be removed from the cultivated topsoil. All pieces of
 wood, rocks and unbroken clumps of earth with any dimension larger than 2 inches {50 mm}
 shall be removed from the planting area.
 2. Initial Soil Amendments.
 The initial fertilization shall be a commercial fertilizer that will provide at least 120
 pounds {135 kg} of N, 120 pounds {135 kg} of P 2O5, and 120 pounds {135 kg} of K2O per acre
 {hectare}, as computed from the nominal contents of fertilizer elements. Only one half of
 this rate shall be applied when the required seeding is Annual Ryegrass.
 Agricultural
 limestone (lime) shall be applied prior to seeding at a rate of two tons per acre {4.5 metric
 tons per hectare}. Lime may be applied in dry, pelletized or slurry form. The rate of
 application is required regardless of the form of application.
 The required rates of placement of fertilizer and lime may increase as directed by the
 Engineer based on the results of the testing of the Topsoil from Stockpiles as described in
 Article 650.02. Additional fertilizer and lime for Topsoil from Stockpiles will be paid for
 separately in accordance with the requirements given in Article 652.05. Reductions in rates
 will result in a price adjustment for seeding.

 (f) Preparation and Planting on Steep Slopes (2H:1V or Steeper).
 1. Ground Preparation.
 Planting operations may proceed without further ground preparation after topsoil
 spreading and tracking if the planting can be accomplished within 72 hours after the tracking
 operations. Tracking is the mechanical roughening of the slope surface. Tracking shall be
 accomplished by the movement upslope and downslope (not along the slope) of heavy
 equipment that operates on tracks.
 2. Initial Soil Amendments.
 One half of the fertilizer and all of the lime required for the initial fertilization of soft
 soil shall be applied hydraulically. 
 3. Sowing.
 The sowing of seeds shall be in accordance with the requirements given for this work in
 soft soil with the exception that hydraulic seed application is required.
 4. Mulching.
 Mulching shall be applied in accordance with the requirements given in Section 656.
 Seeded areas shall be covered with mulch within 48 hours after seeding. Mulching will be
 measured and paid for separately in accordance with the requirements given in Section 656.
 5. Second Application of Fertilizer after Mulching.
 Half of the fertilizer required for the initial fertilization of soft soil shall be applied
 hydraulically approximately 40 calendar days after mulching.
 6. Third Application of Fertilizer.
 A third application of fertilizer shall be made approximately 40 calendar days after the
 second application of fertilizer. This application shall be placed hydraulically as a uniformly
 applied top dressing of 500 pounds {560 kg} of 8-8-8 fertilizer per acre {hectare} or equivalent
 approved by the Engineer.
 
 (g) Seeding in Stubble.
 The seeding in stubble method of planting shall be used to establish permanent species when
 initial vegetation establishment occurs during a season that is not optimal for the permanent
 planting. Dates for seeding in stubble are designated in the seed mix tables in Section 860.
 This method requires that the existing vegetation be mowed to a height of approximately 3
 inches {75 mm} or sprayed with an approved herbicide, or both, to retard further growth. The
 area shall then be lightly scarified by disking or other approved method to prepare a suitable
 seedbed. The initial fertilization, sowing of the seeds, covering of the seeds, and fertilization
 after growth of the seeds shall be in accordance with the requirements given for this work in soft
 soil. Additional agricultural lime application will not be required for seeding in stubble. Mulch
 may be applied to bare areas if requested by the Contractor and approved by the Engineer. Mulch
 shall be furnished and paid for in accordance with the requirements given in Section 656.
 
 (h) Establishment and Acceptance.
 All work shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements given in Section 665 as well
 as the requirements given in this Section.
 The Contractor shall provide plant establishment of the required species of permanent
 vegetation prior to final acceptance of the project. Plant establishment shall consist of preserving,
 protecting, reseeding, or replanting and other such work and at such time as may be necessary to
 keep the vegetated areas in a satisfactory condition.All of the above work shall be performed
 without additional compensation, unless otherwise specified.
 The acceptance of designated seeded areas will be based upon verification of a satisfactory
 stand of vegetative cover in the season for each species required for establishment. If a
 satisfactory stand of desired vegetation is not established, the area shall be re-seeded after
 appropriate soil preparation and re-established without additional cost to the Department.
 A satisfactory stand of vegetative cover shall be defined as a cover of living plants, after true
 leaves are formed, of the required seed species designated for establishment. Generally an 85 %
 coverage will be considered acceptable. Should the Contractor protest the determination of
 satisfactory stand based on visual analysis, a random sampling of 5 samples per acre {0.4 ha} using
 a square yard {meter} template may be executed to determine the percent coverage. There
 should be no areas void of the required species larger than 4 square feet {0.4 square meter}.
 Payment for seeding, fertilizer, and agricultural limestone and mulch will be made in full upon
 549
 
 SECTION 652
 GROUND PREPARATION, VEGETATION ESTABLISHMENT AND MOWING
 satisfactory application. Payment for additional fertilizer and agricultural limestone will be made
 in accordance with the requirements given in Article 652.05. Payment for seeding may be
 withdrawn for areas where vegetative cover is not established or not satisfactorily maintained and
 fertilized after establishment.
 Every effort should be made to establish vegetation of permanent species in accordance with
 the seasonal requirements shown for each species in Section 860. Areas where the season and
 required seed mix causethe method of seeding in stubble to be necessary for the establishment
 of a permanent plant will not be considered acceptable until vegetation of a permanent species is
 satisfactorily established. The project will not be accepted for maintenance prior to acceptable
 establishment of vegetation after seeding in stubble.
 Payment will not be made for areas of unsatisfactory stands of vegetative cover, the repair
 of areas damaged by the Contractor, or for the repair of washes in areas where sufficient erosion
 control measures are available to the Contractor.

 The Contractor shall mow all seeded areas of medians, shoulders and front slopes as directed
 or permitted by the Engineer. The Contractor shall mow when the vegetation becomes a hazard to
 motorists and as necessary to promote growth of the required permanent plant. Mowing shall be
 performed in a manner that will not cause unnecessary damage to desirable vegetation. Mowing of
 lespedezas and tall fescue shall not be done until after these plants have produced mature seed.
 Mowing shall generally be done twice each year as directed or permitted by the Engineer and
 when vegetation has grown to a height of 16 inches. If the project is being considered for
 acceptance for maintenance by the Department and has been mowed within the last 2 months,
 additional mowing will not be required.
 The Contractor shall mow, cut and trim as close as practicable to all fixed objects, exercising
 extreme care not to damage trees, plants, shrubs, delineators and other appurtenances. Damage
 to trees, plants, shrubs, delineators or other appurtenances shall be repaired or replaced
 immediately by the Contractor at no cost to the Department. The Engineer will determine if the

 656.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) Mulching Operations.
 Seeded areas shall be covered with mulch within 48 hours after seeding. Mulch shall be
 applied at the rates required below for the type of mulch used. Mulch shall be furnished to
 effectively control erosion and promote the establishment of vegetation.
 Dry blown mulch shall be stabilized by crimping, by the application of a tackifier adhesive, or
 by anchoring with a mulch control netting, with the following exceptions: crimping shall only be
 allowed on slopes 3:1 or flatter, and tackifier adhesive shall be required for applications within 10
 feet {3 meters} of traffic. During crimping operations, care shall be taken to follow as closely as
 possible to the contours of the mulched surface. Crimping shall result in the mulch being securely
 lodged into the soil providing both erosion protection and promotion of vegetation establishment.
 Tackifier adhesive shall be applied at the rate recommended by the manufacturer.
 Hydraulic Mulch products shall be applied in accordance with manufacturer
 recommendations, typically in opposing directions to provide a solid blanket of mulch product.
 Hydraulic Mulches may be used within 10 feet {3 meters} of traffic as an alternate to dry blown
 mulch with tackifier adhesive. Hydraulic Mulches shall not be installed in areas subject to
 channelized flow or areas having a potential to flood during a local 2 year, 24 hour storm event.
 
 (b) Rate of Mulch Application.
 Dry blown mulch shall be applied at a rate of not less than 2 tons per acre {4500 kg/ha}.
 Proof of material weight shall be provided to the Engineer by the Contractor upon delivery of the
 materials to the project site. The weight ticket shall contain all items required in Item 109.01(h)2.
 with the exception of the name of the producer and the truck number.
 Hydraulic Mulch products shall be applied at the rate designated by the manufacturer for the
 specific slope where they are being applied to provide a solid blanket of the mulch product with
 no soil showing. In no case shall the applied rate be less than 1 ton per acre {2250 kg/ha} for
 hydraulically applied mulches.
 The application rate will be verified by using the air dry weight {mass} per pound {kilogram}
 and dividing by the surface dimensions of the area covered.
 
 (c) Equipment.
 Dry blown mulch shall be applied with a mechanical mulch spreader designed to break up
 balls or clusters of mulch. If a tackifier adhesive is used to secure the mulch, the mulch spreader
 shall be equipped to apply the adhesive effectively to the mulch to form a uniform, porous and
 stable mulch blanket held in place by the adhesive. The adhesive may also be applied
 hydraulically after mulch application.
 Crimpers shall be roller-type devices equipped with flat, uncupped, dull edged disks. The
 disks shall have a minimum width of 1/4 of an inch {6 mm} and shall be placed a maximum of 8
 inches {200 mm} apart along the axle or shaft. Crimpers shall be specially designed so that by
 adding weight {mass} or using hydraulic force from the tractor the mulch will be imbedded a
 minimum of 2 inches {50 mm} into the ground. The diameter of the disks shall be large enough to
 prevent the axle or shaft from dragging or in any way disturbing the mulch or soil. Under no
 circumstances shall a disc harrow be used to perform the crimping operation.

 periods of drought or when the ground is frozen. These seasonal limits may be changed only on
 written orders from the Engineer.
 Any rock or underground obstructions shall be removed to the depth necessary to permit
 planting according to the plans and Specifications unless other locations for the planting are
 approved. Explosives may be used only where and as expressly approved.
 
 (b) Planting Operations for Vines, Shrubs and Trees.
 1. Row Planting.
 a. Furrows or trenches shall be opened in the locations designated to a depth at least
 6 inches {150 mm} greater than the depth of the roots or ball when extended in their normal
 position, and in no case less than 12 inches {300 mm} for vines and shrubs. The width of
 furrows or trenches shall be at least 12 inches {300 mm} greater than the spread of the roots
 when extended in their normal position, and in no case less than 12 inches {300 mm} for vines
 and 18 inches {450 mm} for shrubs.
 b. The furrows or trenches shall then be partially filled with prepared plant topsoil and
 the vines or shrubs placed so that the crown, bud or base of the tops, as the case may be, is
 at or slightly below the previous growing level and the roots are in a natural spread. After the
 roots have been completely covered with plant topsoil, the commercial fertilizer 8-8-8 shall
 be evenly scattered over the surface of the plant topsoil at the rate of approximately 0.1
 pound per foot {0.15 kg per meter} of furrow or trench, followed by a satisfactory watering.
 After the water has soaked in and the plant topsoil is no longer muddy, additional plant
 topsoil shall be added and firmly compacted. Compaction shall stop when the compacted
 plant topsoil is 2 inches {50 mm} below the finished grade. The balance of the furrow or
 trench shall then be filled with loose plant topsoil until it is slightly lower than the finished
 grade.
 2. Spot Planting.
 Planting operations shall be in accordance with the specifications for row planting as far
 as applicable. Commercial fertilizer, 8-8-8, shall be applied at a rate of 0.1 pound per square
 yard {0.05 kg per square meter}. Pits for trees and shrubs shall not be less than 18 inches {450
 mm} deep and 3 feet {900 mm} in diameter unless otherwise shown on the plans. If the trees
 to be planted are larger than 2 inches {50 mm} in caliper or 10 feet {3 m} in height, the size
 of the pits shall be increased in proportion to the increase in size of the trees. For shrubs the
 pit shall be 12 inches {300 mm} greater than the ball diameter or root spread. The bottom of
 all planting pits for trees shall have the soil loosened at least 6 inches {150 mm} deeper than
 excavated. The side walls of all planting pits shall be vertical and the bottoms flat. Sloping
 walls of pits or crowding of root systems will be cause for rejection of the planting.
 3. Drainage.
 Tile or pipe underdrain subsoil drainage shall be installed as provided by the plans or
 directed. Such tile pipe shall meet the requirements of Section 853. Trenches shall be not
 less than 18 inches {450 mm} below finished grades. Drain tile shall be connected with a
 suitable outlet.
 4. Disposal of Excess Soil.
 Excess soil shall be disposed of as directed.
 5. Plant Topsoil.
 Unless otherwise provided by the plans, plant topsoil shall be used in preparation and in
 the backfill of plant pits in connection with row planting and spot planting.
 6. Setting Plants.
 a. All plants shall be set plumb at such a level that after settlement they bear the
 same relation to the level of the surrounding ground as they bore to the ground from which
 they were dug. All plants shall be planted in plant topsoil which shall be settled by watering
 when required and by tamping. For spring planting, a shallow saucer capable of holding water
 shall be formed about each plant by placing a mound of soil around the edge of each pit,
 unless otherwise directed. Care shall be taken in setting plants to protect adjacent planting
 from damage.
 b. Balled and burlapped plants or balled platform plants (BB, BP) are to be planted
 with plant topsoil carefully tamped around and under the base of each ball to fill voids.

 SECTION 666
 PEST CONTROL
 666.01 Description.
 The work covered by this Section shall consist of furnishing and applying designated chemicals to
 control certain destructive pests, namely, Armyworm, Fall Armyworm, Cutworm, Spittlebug, White
 Grubs and Pine Bark Beetles.
 Because of the destructive nature of the action of these pests to trees and ground cover with the
 possible result of erosion and ultimate siltation of areas, control of these pests is a necessity.
 Both the Engineer and the Contractor have the responsibility of continually observing the planted
 areas for possible pest damage. The Contractor should, upon observing any of these pests, report such
 to the Engineer, both verbally and in writing.
 The Engineer will verify any reports of this type of pest and direct appropriate treatment to be
 taken.
 The following brief descriptions are provided for ease in recognizing these pests:
 Armyworm: A medium size caterpillar of dark green color with white stripes on sides and
 down the middle of the back, Size, approximately 1 inch {25 mm} in length. This worm usually
 feeds only at night destroying foliage.
 Fall Armyworm: A medium size caterpillar of dark green color with white stripes on sides and
 down the middle of the back with a distinctive yellow inverted "Y" on the head capsule. Size,
 approximately 1 inch {25 mm}. This worm will feed both day and night destroying foliage.
 Cutworm: A fat bodied caterpillar with a greasy appearance, color mostly greybrown or
 mottled on top and lighter color underneath. Size, approximately 1 to 2 inches {25 to 50 mm} in
 length when full grown. This worm hides during the day and feeds at night, destroying foliage.
 Spittlebug: Most easily identified by a frothy mass of plant juice at the forks of plant stems
 resembling spittle. This pest lives inside the spittle mass.
 White Grubs: The immature (larval) stage of June or May beetles. Length, 0.5 to 1.5 inches
 {13 to 38 mm}, have three pairs of legs near the head, and characteristically rest in a C-shaped
 position. Their heads and rear ends are brown. Green June Beetle grubs crawl on their backs with
 their legs up.
 Pine Bark Beetles: These beetles are distinguished from other bark beetles in that the
 rearward end of the abdomen is scooped out and spined (4 to 6 spines on each side). The southern
 pine beetle and black turpentine beetle have a more rounded abdomen. The black turpentine
 beetle is the larger of the two, being about 1/4 inch {6 mm} long . The southern pine beetle is
 572
 
 SECTION 666
 PEST CONTROL
 about 1/8 {3mm} inch long. All of the pine bark beetles are roughly cylindrical and are dark brown
 to black.
 
 666.02 Material.
 The treatments to be used under this Section shall be as per the current Alabama Pesticide
 Handbook or Guidelines as may be issued by the Alabama Cooperative Extension Service. As new
 pesticide materials are approved by the State Department of Agriculture and Industries, the Bureau of
 Construction may allow their use upon written request by the Contractor.
 All chemicals shall be a product of a reputable manufacturer, processed in accordance with all
 State and Federal regulations for such manufacture.
 
 Restricted Use of Insecticides
 Whenever the State Department of Agriculture and Industries or other Federal or State
 agency restricts the use of any insecticide on highway right-of-way, its initial or continued use
 shall require the approval of the Construction Engineer. It is illegal to place herbicides in a
 manner that is not consistent with the requirements shown on the insecticide container labeling.
 
 666.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) General.
 The Engineer after verification of the pest occurrence and identification of the type pest
 shall direct the use of treatments as noted in Article 666.02 in accordance with the following:
 Equipment used in the application shall be designed for the application method to be
 used and approved by the Engineer for use.
 The application of pesticides shall be performed by or under the direct supervision of a
 licensed pesticide applicator, licensed in the area of right-of-way pest control. Uniform
 coverage is required. If uniform coverage is not obtained, the Contractor shall retreat the
 entire area in such a manner that uniform coverage is obtained. Retreatment because of
 uneven coverage shall be without additional cost to the State. Retreatment shall not be
 performed within seven days of the original treatment. All treatments shall be at the
 direction of the Engineer.
 In all treatments, dilutions of liquids and technical material dosage applied shall follow
 label instructions, these Specifications and be verified by the Engineer.
 Any change to the dilution rates of a specific chemical or the substitution of chemicals
 other than those meeting the requirements of Article 666.02 must have prior written approval
 of the Construction Engineer and any such approved change must be without additional cost
 to the State.
 
 (b) Safeguards.
 Safeguards in applying insecticides are the responsibility of the Contractor, and he shall be
 responsible for any damage to humans or wildlife incurred during application operations.
 The following are minimum basic safeguards to be observed.
 1. Avoid drift of any spray or dust material on adjacent property.
 2. Confine Sprays or Dust to areas that will not contaminate streams or lakes adjacent
 to the Right-of-Way.
 3. Carbaryl (Sevin) and Malathion are highly toxic to bees; therefore, if spraying or
 dusting is carried out near bee yards, give advance notice to beekeeper so that he
 can protect his bees.
 4. In general, spraying with ground equipment is the least hazardous to wildlife;
 therefore, all treatment shall be applied by approved ground driven equipment
 unless approved otherwise by the Engineer.
 5. Operators of spraying or dusting equipment must wear the recommended apparel
 for specific insecticides being applied in executing this work.
 6. Only qualified personnel will be permitted to engage in this type operation. The
 Contractor or subcontractor shall submit, if required by the Alabama Department of
 Transportation, a list of the roads, railroads, or other areas that he has treated.
 This list must be certified by the official for whom the work was performed.
 7. Normally, pesticide spraying will be restricted to roadside areas which are under
 construction, and subsequently, are not open to the public. However, should areas
 such as scenic overlooks, rest areas, etc., be ordered treated, precautions for the
 protection of the public must be taken; namely, by keeping pedestrians off the area
 573
 
 SECTION 668
 PRE-EMERGENT HERBICIDE TREATMENT
 until the insecticide dissipates from the turf area to a point that it is no longer an
 area of concern in accordance with the product labeling.

 SECTION 672
 STORMWATER TURBIDITY CONTROL
 672.01 Description.
 This Section shall cover active and passive treatment methods of reducing the turbidity level of
 construction stormwater. Turbidity is typically the result of fine soil particles of erodible material
 exposed during construction, dislodged by precipitation and runoff, and subsequently suspended in
 stormwater. Conventional means of erosion and sediment control are not designed to remove turbidity
 from construction stormwater. Additional measures must be implemented to remove the suspended
 materials from the water. Chemical flocculants are used to increase the particle size of suspended
 materials making them easier to remove. Prior to discharging construction stormwater, flocculated
 materials should be removed to the maximum extent practicable.
 Active treatment should be used as a supplement to passive treatment for stormwater discharges
 that do not meet water quality standards. Active treatment typically employs mechanical pumping of
 captured stormwater as the means of introducing flocculant prior to mechanical filtering of flocculated
 materials.
 Passive treatment typically employs precipitation and runoff as the means of introducing
 flocculant prior to physical settling of flocculated materials, typically by means of filtering devices and
 sedimentation basins.
 
 672.02 Materials.
 (a) Active Treatment System.
 The Active Treatment System shall be designed to treat and reduce the turbidity level of
 construction stormwater discharges to meet state water quality standards and the requirements of
 the NPDES Construction General Permit at the flowrate required in the plans. The Active
 Treatment System flowrate specified is designed to dewater the basin within 10 hours. Typical
 equipment and materials may include pumps, manifolds, flocculants, filter bags, sand media
 filters and other items designed to remove suspended materials from construction stormwater.
 The Contractor shall submit to the Engineer the proposed Active Treatment System for review as
 part of the Contractor’s Stormwater Management Plan that is described in Subarticle 108.04(b).
 
 (b) Flocculant.
 Flocculant shall be of the type that is manufactured for use in reducing turbidity caused by
 soil erosion and sediment transport. All forms of Flocculant utilized on a project shall be
 580
 
 SECTION 672
 STORMWATER TURBIDITY CONTROL
 compatible and shall be provided from a single manufacturer. Flocculant may be in the form of
 blocks, powder, sock sets or other non-liquid forms. Liquid forms of Flocculant may only be
 utilized in a monitored active treatment system. The Contractor shall be responsible for the
 testing of the project soil and potential sediment and for the proper selection of those Flocculants
 that have a soil specific chemical makeup. Flocculant application rates shall be per the
 manufacturer’s recommendations.
 A list of acceptable Flocculants (LIST II-24 “TEMPORARY EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
 PRODUCTS”) is given in the ALDOT manual titled “Materials, Sources, and Devices with Special
 Acceptance Requirements”. For Flocculants without prior acceptance, Contractor shall submit to
 the Engineer three copies of documentation of the effectiveness of the Flocculant, Material Safety
 Data Sheets, and the manufacturer's 7-day Chronic Ceriodaphnia Reproduction Testing for review
 and approval by the State Construction Engineer prior to use on the project.
 
 (c) Contractor Retained Turbidimeters.
 Turbidimeters shall be devices capable of measuring the nephelometric turbidity units (NTU)
 of construction stormwater that meets the following requirements:
 • Portable waterproof device that meets USEPA Method 180.1 with a 0-1000 NTU
 range;
 • Sample Tubes, Calibration Kit, and Protective Carrying Case;
 • Rechargeable Battery, USB Interface, Cable, and Computer Software.
 A list of equipment acceptable for use in this application (List II-24 “TEMPORARY EROSION
 AND SEDIMENT CONTROL PRODUCTS”) is given in the ALDOT manual titled “Materials, Sources, and
 Devices with Special Acceptance Requirements”. Information concerning this list is given in
 Subarticle 106.01(f).
 
 672.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) Active Treatment.
 The Contractor shall provide an Active Treatment System at the locations given in the plans
 or as directed by the Engineer. Treated construction stormwater discharges that do not meet state
 water quality standards or that do not meet the requirements of the NPDES Construction General
 Permit (CGP) will not be allowed.
 Active Treatment Systems will typically be utilized for the dewatering of sedimentation
 basins. Valves located on the outlet pipe of the basin dewatering device shall remain closed until
 such time that the potential discharge meets state water quality standards and the requirements
 of the NPDES CGP. If discharge standards are not met and the sedimentation basin volume reaches
 2/3 full or there is forecasted rain, the Engineer will determine if the basin should be dewatered
 by means of the Active Treatment System. Weather permitting, discharges may be recirculated
 into sedimentation basins in an effort to achieve discharge standards. The Engineer may also
 direct dewatering by means of the Active Treatment System to facilitate sedimentation basin
 maintenance. The Contractor shall ensure proper Flocculant dosing of the Active Treatment
 System per the manufacturer’s dosing recommendations to prevent the discharge of any harmful
 levels of Flocculant. The turbidity level of the Active Treatment System discharge and the
 effectiveness of the Flocculant shall be monitored by the Contractor and will be verified by the
 Engineer.
 
 (b) Passive Treatment.
 The Contractor shall apply Flocculant at the locations given in the plans or as directed by the
 Engineer. Flocculant shall be introduced to flowing stormwater at locations such as ditch checks,
 temporary slope drains and forebays of sedimentation basins, prior to retention BMPs intended to
 promote settling and capture of flocculated material. Heavy sediment and sand should be
 captured prior to the location of the Flocculant application. Flocculant shall never be applied
 directly to live streams or waters of the state. Flocculant shall be applied in accordance with the
 Flocculant manufacturer's dosing recommendations and the requirements shown on the plans for
 construction stormwater turbidity reduction. The effectiveness of the Flocculant will be monitored
 by the Engineer. ALDOT and Contractor QCIs shall inspect Flocculant applications after each rain
 event to determine if the reapplication of Flocculant is needed.

 Type B: Consists of a single post with two mile {kilometer} markers mounted back to back on
 the post so as to be seen by traffic in each direction.
 In general, the mile {kilometer} posts will be established for the Federal and State Highways
 beginning at the south or west State Line, or at junctions where routes begin. The mile {kilometer}
 posts will then proceed continuously north and east along the routes through the State.
 
 709.02 Materials.
 Materials furnished for use under this Section shall comply with the requirements of Article
 710.02, the detailed plans and the following:
 • Sign panels shall be limited to aluminum with reflective sheeting.
 • Posts shall be of the type designated on the plans. If the plans offer a choice and once
 this choice is made and erection begun, the Contractor will not be permitted to change
 to another type without written permission of the Engineer.
 Reset units shall utilize existing material insofar as possible. Any replacement parts necessary
 shall comply with the requirements specified above in this Article.
 
 709.03 Construction Details.
 Construction details shall be as follows:
 All signs shall be erected and supported in accordance with these specifications and as shown
 on the plans. Horizontal edges of signs shall be level and faces of signs shall be vertical.
 The Engineer will mark the location and designate the numerical number for each mile
 {kilometer} post.
 If man-made obstructions are encountered at the measured marker location (such as
 underground obstructions), the Engineer may direct one of the following:
 1. Shifting of the mile {kilometer} post location not to exceed 50 feet {10 m} either
 forward or backward to a more suitable location.
 604
 
 SECTION 709
 MILE {KILOMETER} POSTS
 2. If underground obstructions occur which cannot be by-passed by the method noted
 next above, the Engineer may order the deletion of the mile {kilometer} post from
 the contract.
 However, regardless of which of the two methods noted above are used, no more than one
 marker may be omitted and the succeeding mile {kilometer} post shall be located, based on the
 established mile {kilometer} post location and not on any adjusted location.
 If current construction in progress is at such a stage to warrant delaying installation, the
 Engineer may direct the delivery of the complete mile {kilometer} post assembly to the District
 Engineer's office. Under this condition, payment for the mile {kilometer} posts will be made in
 accordance with the provisions of Subarticle 109.06(b) of the Standard Specifications.
 As soon as the work begins, it shall be prosecuted continuously until the work is complete.
 Positioning of the mile {kilometer} post relative to the pavement or shoulder edge shall be as
 shown on the plans.
 After installation of the posts and checking for position (horizontal and vertical), the sign
 faces shall be secured to the posts in the manner provided by the plans.
 No sign posts shall be left standing without a sign face after daylight hours unless warning
 markers, reflectors, etc., are provided to warn the traveling public. In the same manner, no holes
 or other hazardous condition shall be left without proper warning markers and delineation.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for any damage done to the signs or posts which occur
 from any cause prior to acceptance as mentioned in Article 709.05. Signs and posts are to be
 stored under cover and protected from the weather and other damage until they are erected.
 Mile {kilometer} post assemblies designated to be reset shall be carefully removed and
 reinstalled at the designated new location. Removal methods will, in general, be at the option of
 the Contractor provided such does not damage the assembly. Any damage caused by the
 Contractor's operation or on account of carelessness negligence, loss of materials or failure to
 conduct the work properly shall require replacement in kind at no additional cost. Reinstallation
 shall be in the same manner as for new installation as noted above in this Article.
 
 709.04 Public Convenience and Safety.
 The Contractor's attention is directed to Article 107.07 and the following:
 No highway will be closed to traffic for the purpose of erecting mile {kilometer} posts. The
 Contractor will be required, without extra compensation, to provide adequate and acceptable
 warning signs, temporary guide markers and/or flagmen for directing traffic during working hours.
 All of the above shall be in accordance with Part VI of the current MUTCD.
 Traffic may be shifted to one 12 foot {3.6 m} lane, allowing the Contractor temporary use of
 one 12 foot {3.6 m} lane for the loading and unloading of materials. No loading or unloading of any
 kind will be permitted along the lane or lanes designated for highway traffic, nor will equipment
 be allowed to traverse roadways or lanes against normal traffic flow.
 In addition, should the Contractor's equipment damage the shoulders, ditches, slopes or
 pavement during the performance of this work, he shall restore said areas to the original condition
 without cost to the State.
 
 709.05 Acceptance of Contracts for Mile {Kilometer} Posts Only.
 As soon as the installation of all mile {kilometer} posts on a route to be marked has been
 completed in accordance with the plans and specifications and to the satisfaction of the Engineer, the
 Engineer may make final acceptance of such work. After final acceptance of the mile {kilometer} posts
 on a particular route has been made, the Contractor will be relieved of any further maintenance of the
 mile {kilometer} posts for that particular route. Final acceptance of the entire contract will be made as
 soon as all work required by the contract has been completed and accepted.
 
 709.06 Method of Measurement.
 The measurement of Mile {Kilometer} Posts will be made for the actual number of complete mile
 {kilometer} post assemblies of each designated type, installed complete in place.
 The measurement of Mile {Kilometer} Posts Reset will be made for the actual number of complete
 mile {kilometer} post assemblies, regardless of type, removed and reinstalled, complete in place.

 (c) Methods of Fabrication.
 In addition to the Classes noted above, signs will be designated by the method of fabrication
 as follows:
 1. Flat Panel.
 
 607
 
 SECTION 710
 ROADWAY SIGNS
 A sign face which can be fabricated from a single sheet of material normally not in
 excess of 4 feet {1200 mm} in width.
 2. Multiple Flat Panel.
 A sign face which because of size can not be fabricated from a single sheet of material.
 These panel sections shall be fabricated from sheets not less than 4 feet {1200 mm} in width,
 except that only one sheet for any one sign may be cut to less than 4 feet {1200 mm} in width
 to fabricate signs which are not multiples of 4 feet {1200 mm} in width. Multiple flat panel
 sign sections shall run from top edge to bottom edge of sign face without horizontal joints,
 except that signs greater than 11 feet {3.4 m} in height may have a horizontal joint but no
 sign shall have more than one horizontal joint.
 The use of material sheets of greater width than the minimum 4 feet {1200 mm} noted to
 form sign panels will be acceptable; however, the backing, support, etc. must conform to the
 plan requirements for this classification of panel.
 All panel joints shall be provided with backing strips firmly affixed to the sign to keep
 the panel sections in proper alignment as detailed on the plans.
 3. Multiple Extruded Panels
 Multiple panel signs may be made of extruded sections. All extruded sections shall be 12
 inches {300 mm} wide mounted horizontally and shall have no vertical joints. All panels shall
 be flat and straight. Multiple extruded panel signs shall be limited to Class 6 and Class 2A
 signs. Exceptions will be made to allow 6 inch {150 mm} wide extruded sections in cases
 where the height of a sign or exit panel dictates. There shall not be more than one 6 inch
 {150 mm} wide panel allowed per individual sign or exit panel.
 4. Aluminum Laminated Panels.
 These sign face panels shall consist of sheet aluminum laminated to a honeycomb core,
 sealed completely around the perimeter with an extruded aluminum frame to form a surface
 of the length, width and depth required.
 5. Aluminum Louvered Panels.
 These sign face panels shall consist of aluminum louvers assembled in such a manner as
 to provide a rigid sign panel which will have a wind loading normal to the face of the sign of
 at least 50 percent less than that of a solid panel of the same size and yet provide an opaque
 background when viewed from an angle of 10 or less below the horizontal line of sight.
 
 710.02 Materials.
 All materials furnished for use shall comply with the appropriate requirements of Division 800,
 Materials, and the requirements noted herein in this Section. Special reference is made to Section 880
 for Sign Materials, Section 501 for Concrete, Section 502 for Steel Reinforcement, and Section 508 for
 Structural Steel.
 Sampling and inspection of sign materials will be done in accordance with the requirements given
 in ALDOT-245, "Procedures for Sampling and Inspection of Roadway Signs and Overhead Sign
 Structures."
 Design drawings covering details for legend and message layouts for sign panels will be shown on
 the plans.
 Any deviation from details shown in the plans or furnished the successful bidder must be approved
 by the Engineer.
 Letter series shall be the modified series E as approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation,
 Federal Highway Administration, unless otherwise provided by plan details.
 Unless otherwise noted by plan details, the corners of Class 1, 2 and 6 signs may be square, but the
 borders shall be rounded with radius as shown on the plans, Class 3, 4 5, 7 and 8 signs shall have rounded
 corners in accordance plan details unless otherwise provided.
 In the event the plans do not contain a detailed layout for a specific sign, such as a route marker,
 the layout shall be as approved by the Engineer.
 
 710.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) General.
 1. All signs shall be erected and supported in accordance with these specifications and as
 shown on the plans. Horizontal edges of sign shall be level and faces of signs shall be vertical.
 
 608
 
 SECTION 710
 ROADWAY SIGNS
 2. After being authorized by the Department to proceed with the work, the Sign Contractor
 shall be required to begin with the erection of signs, on that portion of the project that, as
 determined by the Engineer, will best serve the traveling public.
 In most instances sign work will of necessity be performed while the roadway is open to
 traffic. It is not intended that any section of road be left unmarked or in a hazardous condition;
 therefore, the Contractor shall plan his operation in such a manner as to accomplish the following,
 all of which shall be considered an integral part of the work required under this section.
 a. Work shall be performed in such a manner as not to be hazardous to the traveling
 public.
 b. Existing signs shall not be removed until the new replacement signs are installed
 and completed.
 c. No sign posts, particularly adjacent to the shoulders, shall be left standing without
 a sign face after daylight hours unless warning markers, etc. are provided to warn
 the traveling public. In the same manner no holes or other hazardous condition shall
 be left without proper warning markers or delineation.
 d. Once the work of installation of a sign structure is begun, the work shall be
 diligently prosecuted until its completion.
 3. When a section of a project is completed to the state of use, the Contractor may be
 required to begin erection of signs within ten days after receipt of notice from the Engineer, even
 though the work on the roadway may not be completed and accepted by the State.
 4. The contractor shall be responsible for any damage done to signs or posts which may
 occur from any cause, save an unavoidable natural cause, until the work is complete and accepted
 by the State. Signs and posts are to be stored under cover and protected from the weather and
 other damage until they are erected.
 5. The plans indicate the extent and general arrangement of signs. The plans are to be used
 for the general guidance of the Contractor and any commission or omission shown or implied shall
 not be the cause for deviating from the intent of the plans and specifications. If any departures
 from the plans and specifications are deemed necessary by the Contractor, details of such
 departures and the reasons therefore shall be submitted to the Engineer for approval. The
 decision of the Engineer shall be final and mandatory.
 
 (b) Staking Out Signs.
 The Contractor shall not order posts until the length has been established in the field. If
 Geometric Controls are not set up, the Engineer shall stake out the location of each sign along the
 work. The Contractor, however, will be required to check all dimensions and clearances measured
 from such stakes and shall thereafter become responsible for orientation, elevation, offset and
 level of all signs erected. If Geometric Controls are set up, the contractor shall stake out the
 location of each sign along the work. The Contractor shall not order posts until the Engineer has
 reviewed the sign locations as staked. The Contractor will be required to provide all dimensions
 and clearances measured from such stakes and shall thereafter become responsible for
 orientation, elevation, offset and level of all signs erected
 
 (c) Positioning of Sign Faces.
 Positioning of sign faces shall be such as to eliminate or minimize specular (mirror like)
 reflection and provide maximum readability.
 Ground mounted signs shall be erected so that the face is truly vertical and at an angle to the
 roadway centerline as detailed by the plans unless otherwise directed by the Engineer. On curves,
 sign faces shall be oriented so as to be most effective, both day and night, to avoid specular
 reflection.
 Overhead signs shall be erected so that the sign face is at the vertical angle with the roadway
 indicated by the plans or directed and is in the proper position over designated traffic lanes.
 All sign panels shall be so mounted that the tops of panels or the messages on shaped panels
 are truly horizontal. Vertical and horizontal positioning of sign faces shall be as detailed by the
 plans or directed to provide the clearance and height required by MUTCD or noted on the plans.
 
 (d) Installation of Ground Mounted Sign Supports.
 1. General.
 The size, number and type of supports shall be shown on the plans. The support shall not
 extend above the sign panel, but in no case shall the support be less than 3 inches {75 mm}
 above the uppermost stringer mounting bolt. Cutting steel supports to length after they have
 609
 
 SECTION 710
 ROADWAY SIGNS
 been galvanized will be permitted provided the cutting is limited to sawing and the damaged
 area is regalvanized as shown on the plans or directed.
 2. Erection of Posts.
 a. General.
 Posts shall be installed as indicated by plans. The length of the posts or supports
 shall be determined as noted in this Section.
 Installation shall be accomplished in such a manner that the entire post is installed
 as one unit, unless shown otherwise by the plans, to insure proper alignment, etc. of the
 post. All posts shall be checked with a spirit level for vertical alignment. Posts with
 breakaway features may be adjusted slightly by the use of special shims as indicated by
 plan details; major adjustments shall require removal and resetting.
 When breakaway features are incorporated into post assemblies, the requirements
 noted in this Item shall be complied with to insure their functioning properly under field
 conditions.
 All Tubular posts after installation shall be provided with a proper cap.
 b. Foundations.
 When foundations require the use of concrete encasements, the posts shall be
 installed in pre-dug holes and backfilled with Class A concrete. Reinforcement, if
 required, shall be as detailed on the plans.
 When plans and soil conditions permit the installation of posts by driving, a method
 of driving will be required that will not damage the posts. Any damage in driving shall be
 cause for rejecting the post and requiring it to be replaced. In lieu of driving, the
 Contractor may elect to install the posts by pre-dug holes and backfilling with sand. The
 sand backfill shall be thoroughly flooded with water to insure good compaction. If solid
 rock is encountered, the posts shall be placed in drilled holes and backfilled with
 concrete to the top of the rock as shown on the plans or directed and the remainder
 backfilled as noted above.
 c. Breakaway Features.
 (1) General.
 Unless otherwise noted in the detailed plans, all bolts, nuts and washers used
 in the breakaway features shall be High Strength galvanized complying with the
 requirements of Article 836.33.
 The functioning of the breakaway design is dependent upon the proper
 installation of these bolts so that the residual tension specified by the plans is
 obtained. To accomplish this, the following requirements shall apply:
 All bolts, nuts and washers of each diameter bolt required in the work
 shall be from the same manufacturer. Bolts used in each type connection
 (hinge, fuse or base) shall be so sized that all bolts for a particular type
 connection in a support structure are of the same length. Said length shall be
 the minimum plan specified length plus any additional length necessary to
 provide at least two exposed threads on the bolt after the connection has been
 properly tightened.
 The torque necessary to obtain the residual bolt tension required by the
 plans shall be determined by a "bolt-tension calibrator." The Department will
 provide the "bolt-tension calibrator" for calibration of the Contractor's torque
 wrench for the various sizes of bolts.
 The Contractor shall supply five sets of bolts, nuts and washers of each
 diameter to be used in the work for determination of the bolt torque necessary
 to obtain the residual bolt tension specified by the plans.
 (2) Setting of Bolt Tension.
 All posts and sign panels shall be in place prior to setting of the bolt tension for
 the base connections and the post fuse and hinge plates.
 After completion of the sign panel installation, all bolts, nuts and washers used
 in the hinge plates, fuse plates and base connections during the shipping and
 installation of the support assembly shall be removed and replaced with approved
 High Strength bolts, nuts and washers.
 610
 
 SECTION 710
 ROADWAY SIGNS
 Prior to use of the H.S. bolts, etc. they shall be checked to insure they are free
 turning and are lubricated with a bee's wax based lubricant approved by the
 Engineer (some commercial wax products have proven satisfactory). Installation of
 the bolts, etc., may then proceed using the appropriate calibrated torque wrenches
 for the size bolt being installed. All lubricating and torquing of the H.S. bolts and
 nuts shall be performed in the presence of an inspector. Any bolt not installed in
 the presence of an inspector shall be removed and examined to insure the nut is
 free turning for the full thread length (any binding shall be cause for rejection),
 lubricated and re-installed as noted.
 
 (e) Erection of Framework and Sign Panels.
 Framework for erecting sign panels shall be assembled and attached to the ground supports
 as provided on the approved drawings. All horizontal members of supporting frames shall be truly
 horizontal and at correct height so that the bottom of the sign shall be at the height above
 pavement specified and proper horizontal position.
 Erection of sign panels shall be done in a neat and workmanlike manner. Sign panels shall be
 attached to the supporting frames in accordance with the recommendations of the sign panel
 manufacturer. All nuts, bolts, screws and set screws shall be tightened securely.
 Signs shall be inspected at night by the Engineer, and if specular (mirror like) reflection is
 apparent on any signs, its positioning shall be adjusted by the Contractor.
 When sign panels are noted to be re-installed on another support assembly, removal of the
 old panel from its supports shall be done in such a manner as to prevent damage to the panels;
 remounting shall be accomplished in the same manner noted for new panels. It is intended to
 allow the use of dismantled hardware in remounting of the old panels; however, if the old
 hardware is unusable, the Contractor shall provide the appropriate new hardware necessary to
 install the panel.
 
 (f) Removal of Existing Signs.
 The Contractor shall dismantle and remove all existing signs designated to be removed;
 however, when they are to be replaced with another sign, the new sign shall be in place before
 the old sign is removed unless otherwise ordered by the Engineer.
 Unless noted otherwise on the plans, the Contractor will be allowed to keep all sign panels
 that are designated for removal.
 All materials to be retained by the State (panels, supports and hardware) shall be removed in
 such a manner as to prevent undue damage and the materials stacked and stored at a site on the
 project designated by the Engineer, for later pickup by others. Care shall be taken during
 removal, handling and storage to protect the treated surfaces; especially sign faces; hardware
 shall be bagged or boxed; posts, especially those with breakaway features, shall be removed so
 that the bases are kept intact insofar as practical. Any damage to or loss of removed materials due
 to negligence on the part of the Contractor's removal methods shall be cause for ordering
 replacement in kind for the damaged or lost items.
 Any posts or mounting supports to be removed shall either be pulled or removed or, at the
 discretion of the Contractor, cut off and removed to a depth of not less than 1 foot {0.5 m} below
 the actual ground surface and the area backfilled with suitable material. The area shall be
 cleaned and dressed out in a manner consistent with the surrounding area.
 
 (g) Cleanup of Area.
 The Contractor shall be required to remove all rejected and unused materials and debris from
 the right of way. He shall restore shoulders and slope, including grass, to the original condition.
 Excess excavation will be disposed of off the right of way at the Contractor's expense, unless
 otherwise authorized by the Engineer, and other cleaning up as may be necessary to insure the
 effectiveness and neat appearance of the work.
 
 (h) Inspections.
 Attention is directed to the fact that sign panels as well as supports must be approved before
 installation will be permitted.
 In addition to normal inspections particular attention will be directed to inspection of the
 unit after installation to insure that any damage caused by the installation operation or any defect
 which will affect the serviceability is promptly corrected.
 Attention is directed to the special inspection requirements noted in Subitem 710.03(d)2c
 when setting base plate, hinge plate and fuse plate bolt tensions.

 their supports.
 Any replacement or new materials required shall comply with the appropriate requirements of
 Article 710.02.
 
 711.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) General.
 The relocation of existing signs shall in general require the removal of a complete sign
 assembly (panel or panels and supports) and the re-installation of the assembly at a new
 designated location.
 The method of removal shall be basically that of the Contractor provided such does not
 damage the assembly, Any damage shall require replacement of the damaged parts using materials
 complying with the provisions of Article 710.02 or repair of the parts as directed, without
 additional compensation.
 Care shall be taken in removing the concrete from the support stubs so as to preclude undue
 damage to the stub. Any damage which will affect the reinstallation procedure shall be repaired
 as directed. Note is made of the fact that the shoe assemblies are matched plates and must be
 retained as such, otherwise the unit will not function as designed. In addition, the shoe assembly
 shall be reinstalled in the same manner prescribed in Subarticle 710.03(d).
 Any support foundation which can not be satisfactorily removed may be left in place provided
 it will not be in the way of construction and it is removed to a depth of not less than 1 foot {0.5
 m} below the actual ground surface and the area backfilled as directed with suitable material.
 The renovation of existing roadway signs may include work to the existing sign, sign structure,
 or sign appurtenances. The plans will show the signs, and the work to be done to each sign,
 included under the renovation item.
 Any dismantling of the sign assembly as well as reassembly to be done under either the
 relocation or renovation shall be performed in such a manner as to preclude damaging of the
 assembly materials.
 The Sign Panels are essential for traffic control, hence, unless the road is closed to traffic,
 they shall not be down more than eight hours and in no case overnight. This may require the use
 of temporary supports during the relocation of the permanent supports. Any temporary support
 must be approved before use.
 
 (b) Installation of Sign Assemblies.
 The installation of the relocated supports and panels shall be as prescribed in Article 710.03
 for new signs.
 The existing supports may be reused provided they are not damaged during removal
 operations, or the Contractor may furnish new supports at his option.
 After completion of the re-installation, the sign panels shall be cleaned with approved
 cleaning material.
 
 711.04 Method of Measurement.
 Measurement of relocated ground mounted roadway signs will be on a lump sum basis for all signs
 designated to be relocated.

 756.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) General.
 All construction and installation of electrical conduits shall be done under direction of
 specially qualified supervisors. All workmanship shall be in accordance with the latest accepted
 standard of the industry, as determined by the Engineer.
 Upon completion of the contract, the Contractor shall deliver to the Engineer a corrected
 plan showing in detail the actual location and depth of conduits.
 Improvements, such as sidewalks, curbs, gutters, Portland cement concrete and asphaltic
 concrete pavement, bituminous surfacing, base material, and any other improvements broken or
 damaged by the Contractor, shall be replaced or reconstructed with the same kind of materials as
 found on the work, or with materials of equal quality. The new work shall be left in a serviceable
 condition satisfactory to the Engineer.
 Whenever a part of a square or slab of existing concrete sidewalk or driveway is broken or
 damaged, the entire square or slab shall be removed and the concrete reconstructed as above
 specified.
 The outline of all areas to be removed in Portland cement concrete sidewalks and pavements
 shall be cut to a minimum depth of 1.5 inches {40 mm} with a saw, prior to removing the sidewalk
 and pavement materials. Cut for the remainder of the required depth may be made by a method
 satisfactory to the Engineer. Cuts shall be neat and true with no shatter outside the removal area.
 
 (b) Open Trench Method.
 The excavations required for the installation of conduits shall be performed in such a manner
 as to cause the least possible injury to the street, sidewalks, and other improvements. The
 trenches shall not be excavated wider than necessary for the proper installation of the electrical
 appliances and foundations. Excavating shall not be performed until immediately before
 installation of conduit and other appliances. The material from the excavation shall be placed in a
 position where the least damage and obstruction to vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and the least
 interference with the surface will occur.
 664
 
 SECTION 756
 ELECTRICAL CONDUITS UNDER ROADWAYS
 All surplus excavated material shall be removed and disposed of by the Contractor, as
 directed by the Engineer.
 Excavations after backfilling shall be kept well filled and maintained in a smooth and well
 drained condition until permanent repairs are made.
 At the end of each day's work and at all other times when construction operations are
 suspended, all equipment and other obstructions shall be removed from that portion of the
 roadway open for public travel.
 Coordination of this type work with regular roadway or bridge work will be of prime
 importance to prevent undue damage to completed items of work or existing facilities. Any
 damage to existing facilities caused by the installation of the ducts shall be repaired by the
 Contractor at no additional cost to the State.
 
 (c) Jacking or Boring Method.
 All conduits installed under paved areas shall be encased in steel pipe. Installation of the
 casing shall be made prior to placement of the pavement or it shall be jacked or bored through
 the roadbed under the pavement providing a minimum cover of 30 inches {750 mm}.
 The jacking or boring procedure and equipment shall be such that placement of the casement
 shall be accomplished without producing an unsupported opening through the roadbed between
 the established ends of the required length of casing. In no event should casing lengths be less
 than the distance between shoulder limits of a roadway.
 The drilling and mud bore method will be acceptable provided the requirements noted in
 Subarticle 730.03(a) are complied with.
 
 (d) PRECISION DIRECTIONAL BORING METHOD.
 All conduits installed under paved areas shall be encased in HDPE duct. Installation of the
 casing shall be made prior to placement of the pavement or it shall be precision directional bored
 through the roadbed under the pavement at the depth shown on the plans or as approved by the
 Engineer.
 The precision directional boring procedure and equipment shall be such that placement of the
 casement shall be accomplished without producing an unsupported opening through the roadbed
 between the established ends of the required length of casing. In no event should casing lengths
 be less than the distance between shoulder limits of a roadway.
 The casing shall be installed by drilling a hole with an open type bit that leaves the cuttings
 in place. A gel-forming colloidal drilling fluid consisting of at least 20%* high grade carefully
 processed Bentonite may be used to consolidate cuttings of the cutting bit, seal the walls of the
 hole and furnish lubrication for subsequent removal of cuttings and installations of the casing
 immediately thereafter. In this method, when drilling through a dense formation, cuttings may be
 partially removed from the hole in 3 foot {0.9 m} plugs by use of compressed air as drilling
 progresses. However, in low density soils of a sandy or silty nature, a plug shall be installed in the
 mouth of the bore (hole) to prevent the movement of any cuttings from the hole until immediately
 before installation of the casing. No bit larger than 3 inches {76.2 mm} in diameter shall have
 holes therein larger than 5/16 inches {8 mm} in diameter through which drilling fluid is forced
 during boring. The casing shall be installed immediately after the casing hole is completed. In no
 case will water be used to flush cuttings from the drill hole. The cuttings shall remain in the bore
 hole except as previously provided for as drilling progresses so as to consolidate them to support
 the bore wall. The filter cake which is formed by the cuttings and drilling fluid prevents cave-in or
 sloughing of the drill hole. On completion of the boring, the hole will be swabbed out by pulling
 through the hole the casing attached to a suitable swab. Violation of any of the above provisions
 by the Contractor will result in the suspension of work.
 * NOTE: By Volume. For instance, 20 gallons {20 L} Bentonite to 80 gallons {80 L} of water.
 
 756.04 Method of Measurement.
 The accepted amount of electrical conduit of the type installation required shall be measured by
 the linear foot {meter} to the nearest foot {0.1 m}.
 
 756.05 Basis of Payment.

 time, the inspection operation will be suspended until the producer shall have regraded
 his stock or revised his production methods to produce material uniformly conforming
 with the specifications.
 When sampling stockpiles of aggregates, base materials, etc., the average of all samples
 must be within the gradation band required for the size aggregate specified. In no case
 will stockpiles be acceptable if more than 20% of the total samples fall outside the
 gradation band. In addition, any failing sample must be within 20% of the range specified
 for any designated sieve.
 In case the stock has not been properly prepared or separated before calling an
 Inspector, or in case of delay in replacement of rejected material, the extra inspection
 cost occasioned by such delay will be charged against the Contractor for whom the
 material is being produced and will be deducted from any sums due or which may
 become due the Contractor.
 Where a Contractor's producer or jobber requests inspection of material for warehouse
 stock or for use in plants where stocks of materials inspected and accepted for use in
 highway construction or maintenance cannot be kept separated from materials which are
 667
 
 SECTION 800
 MATERIALS
 to be used on other work, the cost of inspection of those materials which have been
 approved for highway work, but are later diverted to other uses not connected with the
 Department's highway construction or maintenance, will be charged to the Contractor
 who requested such inspections.
 
 800.03 Testing, General.
 Where maximum and minimum specification limits are given, it is intended and expected that
 materials having approximately mean values will be furnished under the respective specifications. The
 established allowances for variations in the determination of these values are considered in
 establishing the limits and no tolerances in excess of the established variation allowances will be
 permitted unless so specifically stated in the proposal or on the plans.
 Unless otherwise specified in the test procedure or material specification, all test results will be
 rounded off in accordance with ASTM E 29 and reported to the same number of places as the
 specification.
 Where material is fabricated of or treated with another material or any combination of materials
 is assembled to form a product, any or all of which are covered by these specifications, the failure of
 any of the components of the product to comply with the designated specifications shall be deemed
 sufficient cause for the rejection of the whole.
 The sieves used for testing materials shall be woven wire cloth conforming to ASTM E 11.
 
 800.04 Tests for Concrete Materials.
 Preliminary samples of fine aggregate, water, and cement shall be subject to both 7 and 28 day
 tests or their equivalent and acceptance based thereon. During the progress of the work, these
 materials may be accepted on the basis of the 7 day test, except that Type III cement may be accepted
 on the basis of the 3 day test.
 
 800.05 Bituminous Mixture Stability and Density Test.
 These tests shall conform to the current methods as described in ALDOT-307 or ALDOT-344,
 depending on the maximum aggregate size.

 801.12 Lightweight Aggregates for Bituminous Work.
 Lightweight Aggregates of expanded clays or shales produced by the Rotary Kiln Method shall meet
 the requirements noted herein in this Section except the maximum dry rodded weight {mass} shall be
 55 pounds per cubic foot {880 kg/m³} and the L.A. Abrasion Test (AASHTO T 96) shall be modified to
 compensate for lightweight aggregate by the use of the following method.
 Modification to AASHTO T 96 for Lightweight Aggregate:
 To avoid the excessive volume of material in the testing machine which will occur when the
 lightweight aggregate sample is prepared according to AASHTO T 96, it is necessary to reduce the
 weight {mass} proportionately to obtain an equal volume of lightweight aggregate comparable to
 that normally obtained with a conventional aggregate sample.
 The abrasive charge must also be reduced in a similar manner.
 1. Determine the unit weight {mass} (U L) of the lightweight aggregate by AASHTO T 19.
 2. Assume an average unit weight {mass} of conventional aggregate to be 97.0 pounds
 per cubic foot {1554 kg/m³}.
 3. Reduce the lightweight aggregate sample.

 cause for the Engineer to order verification of design camber and/or repair of the beam or girder.
 All structural materials shall be examined by shop personnel and/or quality control, at the earliest
 possible time for evidence of any defects. If pitting or other defects are plainly visible during early
 stages of fabrication prior to any required surface preparation (sand or shot blasting), evaluation shall
 be required. Information regarding actual material thickness, amount of area affected and end use of
 material being evaluated will be submitted to the Engineer for acceptability. Any required conditioning
 will be allowed only when in compliance with ASTM A 6 {A 6M}.
 The above shall also apply to pitting of fabricated material stored prior to shipment and to
 material delivered to the bridge site. Attention is called to Subarticle 106.05(b).
 Preparation and shipment of fabricated pieces shall conform to the following:
 Loose Members.

 cambered as shown on the plans. Material with sharp kinks or bends may be rejected. If straightening is
 necessary it shall be done by methods that will not injure the metal and must be approved by the
 709
 
 SECTION 836
 STRUCTURAL STEEL, FASTENERS AND MISCELLANEOUS METALS
 Engineer. Heat straightening will be permitted provided the metal is not heated above 1100°F
 {590 °C}. (controlled by the use of heat crayons furnished by the Fabricator or other approved means).
 After heating, the metal shall not be artificially cooled until after naturally cooling to 600 °F {315 °C}
 or less. The method of artificial cooling is subject to the approval of the Engineer. Water or water
 spray misting shall not be used as a means of artificial cooling. After straightening, the surface of the
 metal shall be carefully inspected for evidence of fracture.
 
 836.19 Workmanship and Finish.
 (a) General.
 Workmanship and finish shall be first class in every respect. Materials at the shop shall be
 kept clean and protected from the weather insofar as practical. Shearing, burning, chipping and
 grinding shall be neatly and accurately done in a workmanlike manner.
 Damage incurred to members or the surfaces of members for any reason shall be cause for
 the Engineer to order the damage repaired or to reject the member in accordance with the
 following:
 1. Except as noted in paragraph 2 below, damage to surfaces of plates that does not reduce
 the plate thickness below the permissible minimum thickness allowed by ASTM A 6 {A 6
 M} or the thickness of structural shapes in excess of 1/32 inch {0.8 mm} for material less
 than 3/8 inch {9.5 mm} in thickness, 1/16 inch {3.2 mm} for materials 3/8 inch to 2
 inches {9.5 mm to 50 mm} inclusive in thickness or 1/8 {3.2 mm} in for material over 2
 inches {50 mm} thick are considered repairable. Damage in excess of the limits noted
 will be evaluated by the Engineer as to whether to reject or allow repair of member.
 2. Surface indentation of members caused by lifting devices shall be evaluated by the
 Bridge Engineer’s representative to determine if the damage is repairable and if
 repairable, the repairs necessary for acceptance. Continued use of lifting devices that
 cause damage, especially that which reduces the specified thickness by more than 1/16
 inch {1.6 mm}, will be cause for the rejection of all such members so damaged.
 3. In general, when allowed, repair work will consist of welding and/or grinding of the
 surfaces; however, when evaluation of base metal defects becomes necessary, such
 evaluation shall be done in the presence of the Bridge Engineer’s representative. The
 type of evaluation shall be determined by the fabricators quality control personnel
 subject to the approval of the Bridge Engineer's Representative. After evaluation of such
 defects and where welding is necessary on rolled surfaces, stringer beads shall be placed
 parallel to the direction of stress. All welding shall be performed by competent welders
 using low hydrogen welding electrodes and/or welding consumables listed in an ALDOT
 approved welding procedure (WPS). The Engineer shall be the sole judge as to the
 acceptability of the repair work; any unacceptable work shall be cause for rejection of a
 member.
 4. A form of buffer and/or shield shall be utilized during fitting operations to protect base
 materials from damage caused by fitting tools or devices. If evidence of base metal
 damage appears due to misuse of such devices, the material may be deemed
 unacceptable.
 
 (b) Details.
 1. Bends and crimps shall conform to wood or metal templates. All bending or crimping
 shall be done to the bend lines shown on the plans by a mechanically operated press without
 avoidable or unnecessary decrease in section.
 2. All material shall be bent cold when practical. Cold bending of rolled steel plates shall
 conform to the following:
 a. They shall be so taken from the stock plates that the bending line will be at right angles
 to the direction of rolling.
 b. The radii of bends, measured to the concave face of the metal, shall not be less, and
 preferably shall be greater, than shown in the following table.

 will require a written procedure approved by the Engineer. Said procedure shall utilize the lowest
 temperature possible but not in excess of 1100 °F {590 °C} as evidenced by infrared thermometers
 or heat crayons.
 Horizontal curving of built-up girders shall be accomplished by cutting flange plates to the
 radii shown by the plan details from wider plates, unless the heat up-set method is allowed by the
 plans or proposal. When the heat up-set method is allowed, such will require a written procedure
 approved by the Engineer. Said procedure shall utilize minimum temperatures not to exceed
 1100°F {590 °C} as evidenced by infrared thermometers or heat crayons.
 After heating of metals as noted, the metal shall not be artificially cooled until after
 naturally cooling to 600°F {315 °C}. or less. The method of artificial cooling must be acceptable to
 the Engineer. Water or water spray misting shall not be used as a means of artificial cooling. Any
 material that is heated above the temperature limit noted will be rejected until tests and
 investigations reveal the material is suitable for use. The Fabricator shall be solely responsible for
 providing any test data or other information deemed necessary by the Engineer to evaluate the
 acceptability of the material at no cost to the Department.
 The fabricator's Quality Control Inspector shall furnish verification certificates of the actual
 measurements of the camber, overall length and horizontal sweep placed in each beam or girder.
 Actual measurements shall be verified and recorded by the Fabricator's Quality Control Inspector.

 punched hole may be entered perpendicular to the face of the member, without drifting, in at
 least 75 percent of the contiguous holes in the same surface or in like proportion for any group of
 holes. If this requirement is not fulfilled, the badly punched pieces will be rejected. If any hole
 will not pass a pin 3/16 inch {4.8 mm} smaller in diameter than the nominal size of the punched
 hole, this will be cause for rejection.
 
 (c) Shop Assembly.
 Bolted trusses, arches, continuous beam spans and plate girders shall be assembled in the
 shop either in an upright position or on their side. After the members have been adjusted to line
 and fit with proper camber and rigidly fastened (i.e., drift pinned) together, the holes for field

 {1.6 mm} larger than the nominal diameter of the fastener. Reaming shall be done after all the
 pieces to be connected are assembled and firmly fastened together. Reaming of fastener holes
 shall be done with twist drills or with short taper reamers. Where practicable, reamers shall be
 directed by mechanical means. Burrs resulting from reaming or drilling shall be removed.
 
 (d) Accuracy of Reamed or Drilled Holes.
 Reamed or drilled holes shall be cylindrical and perpendicular to the member and their
 accuracy shall be the same as provided for punched holes (Subarticle 836.22(b)) except that, after
 reaming or drilling, 85 percent of the contiguous holes in the same surface, or in like proportion
 for any group of holes, shall not show an offset greater than 1/32 inch {0.8 mm} between adjacent
 thickness of metal. There shall be no drifting in the shop or field to enlarge mismatched holes. If
 any holes must be enlarged to admit the fastener, they shall be reamed.

 860.02 Grass Sprigs.
 (a) General.
 This Article is based on the use of sprigs; however, should the Contractor elect to use plugs of
 sod, the same basic requirements are applicable except that harvesting shall be in accordance
 with the provisions of Article 860.05 for solid sod, which in turn shall be cut to proper size (at
 least 2 inches by 2 inches {50 mm by 50 mm}) by an acceptable procedure before use.
 Grass sprigs or plugs of sod turfs shall be common or Tiflawn Bermudagrass, Centipede, Myers
 Zoysia, Zoysia Matrella, or other perennial running grasses that may be indicated by the plans. All
 grass shall be native or adaptable to the locality of the work and shall be live, fresh, vigorous, and
 uninjured at the time of planting and until completion and acceptance of the work. The sprigs
 shall have well formed and developed root systems and shall be in clusters or tufts at least 1 inch
 {25 mm} in diameter unless otherwise directed. Sprigs containing Johnsongrass, Bahiagrass,
 Dallasgrass, or other objectionable grasses or weeds will not be accepted.
 
 (b) Procuring and Handling Sprigs.
 Before harvesting, the Engineer shall be notified of the source of sprigs for purposes of
 inspection. Approval of sources on such examination shall not be construed as an acceptance of
 747
 
 SECTION 860
 ROADSIDE IMPROVEMENT MATERIALS
 the material. Unless the grass area has been grazed closely, it shall be mowed to height of 3
 inches {75 mm} maximum before harvesting. The sprigs shall be harvested with a sod-cutter,
 turning plow, or other approved implements in such a manner that at least 2 inches {50 mm} of
 the root system will be lifted intact. Raking and otherwise harvesting sprigs that remain on the
 surface after digging and have been allowed to dry out, will not be permitted. Solid sod specified
 in Article 860.05 may be pulled apart and used as sprigs.
 The properly harvested sprigs shall be loaded within one hour after they are dug then
 transported to the place where they are to be planted. They shall be kept cool, moist and shaded
 at all times after digging, while being transported to the sprigging site, after being unloaded, and
 until planted. Small quantities of sprigs left over at the end of the work day or at time of heavy
 rains may be stocked in thin covered piles and may be used the next day or not over three days
 later, provided sprigs in the pile are still acceptable. The sprigs will be subject to inspection
 during the planting period, and any material which has been permitted to dry out or to freeze, or
 which is not moist and viable, will be rejected.
 When large pieces of sprigs are to be broken down into smaller pieces for sprigging, this
 operation shall be done by hand or by such other means that will avoid severing the roots from the
 tops of the sprigs.
 After unloading, accepted sprigs shall be carried to the planting site in moist cloth or burlap
 bags and kept therein until ready to be dropped into the furrows.
 
 860.03 Mulching Material.
 (a) Dry Blown Mulch.
 Dry blown mulch shall be hay or straw applied at rates required in Section 656. Hay shall be
 native hay or Sudan grass, broom straw, coastal bermudagrass, or other materials approved by the
 Engineer. Straw shall be threshed straw of oats, wheat, or rye. Mulch materials shall not contain
 an excessive quantity of matured seeds or noxious weeds or a species which would constitute a
 menace to the planted species and to surrounding farm land. Mulch shall not be too fresh, or
 excessively brittle, or so decomposed as to retard growth of grass.
 The moisture content of the mulch shall not exceed 15 % at the time that the mulch is
 weighed. Moisture content will be checked as directed by the Engineer.
 The moisture content of the mulch will be checked in accordance with ALDOT Procedure 240,
 "Determination of Moisture Content in Mulching Materials".
 Acceptable Tackifier Adhesives are listed on List II-20, “TACKIFIERS, MULCH CONTROL
 NETTING, AND HYDRAULIC MULCH PRODUCTS”, of the Department's manual "Materials, Sources,
 and Devices with Special Acceptance Requirements". Tackifiers shall be used at the manufacturer's
 recommended rates when chosen for mulch stabilization. Tackifiers shall be harmless to fish,
 wildlife, and plants, and shall be non-toxic and non-combustible as documented through Material
 Safety Data Sheets and a 7 day chronic Ceriodaphnia reproduction test report. Asphalt adhesives
 are not acceptable for use.
 Acceptable Mulch Control Netting products are listed on List II-20, “TACKIFIERS, MULCH
 CONTROL NETTING, AND HYDRAULIC MULCH PRODUCTS”, of the Department's manual "Materials,
 Sources, and Devices with Special Acceptance Requirements". Mulch Control Netting shall be 100%
 biodegradable, be of a uniform, open, plain weave and meet the following requirements:
 • Minimum Mass per Unit Area of 9 ounces per square yard (ASTM D 5261)
 • Minimum Tensile Strength (Machine Direction, Dry) of 300 pounds per foot (ASTM D
 4595)
 • Minimum Tensile Strength (Transverse Direction, Dry) of 125 pounds per foot (ASTM
 D 4595)
 • Minimum 50% Open Area as determined by physical measurement.
 
 (b) Hydraulic Mulch Products.
 Hydraulic Mulch Products shall consist of natural fibers with or without tackifier adhesives
 and/or binding agents. It shall be processed in such a manner that it will contain no growth or
 germination inhibiting factors and shall be dyed an appropriate color to facilitate a uniform spread
 of the slope by visual inspection. It shall be manufactured in such a manner that after addition
 and agitation in slurry tanks with soil amendments, the fibers in the material will become
 uniformly suspended to form a homogeneous slurry; and that when hydraulically sprayed on the
 ground, the material will form a ground cover; and which after application will allow the
 748
 
 SECTION 860
 ROADSIDE IMPROVEMENT MATERIALS
 absorption of moisture and allow rainfall or mechanical watering to percolate to the underlying
 soil.
 Hydraulic Mulch Products shall have a maximum RUSLE Cover Factor (C-Factor) of 0.20
 defined as the ratio of the soil loss from a slope protected by the product to the soil loss from an
 unprotected or bare soil slope. At a minimum, one slope test replicate of ASTM D 6459-07 shall be
 conducted at an independent laboratory accredited by the Geosynthetic Institute’s, Geosynthetic
 Accreditation Institute’s-Laboratory Accreditation Program (GAI-LAP) for this test. The Hydraulic
 Mulch Product shall have a minimum 200 % Vegetation Enhancement compared to the control and
 shall be measured in accordance with the requirements given in ASTM D 7322.
 Acceptable Hydraulic Mulch Products are listed on List II-20, “TACKIFIERS, MULCH CONTROL
 NETTING, AND HYDRAULIC MULCH PRODUCTS”, of the Department’s manual "Materials, Sources,
 and Devices with Special Acceptance Requirements". All packaging of the mulch shall be clearly
 marked with the lot or batch number, material specifications, and application recommendations.
 Weight {mass} specifications of this material shall refer only to air dry weight {mass} of the fiber
 material.
 
 860.04 Grassy Mulch Material.
 (a) General.
 Grassy mulch shall be obtained from the sources of the Contractor's selection and meeting the
 approval of the Engineer. The Contractor shall furnish such material and construct and maintain
 hauling roads necessary for obtaining the material, all without extra compensation.
 The grass contained in the grassy mulch material shall be live growing grass as provided in
 Article 860.02 and shall be procured from areas where the soil is fertile as indicated by vigorous
 growth. The grass shall have a healthy virile root system of dense, thickly matted roots. It shall be
 reasonably free from obnoxious weeds or other grasses, and shall not contain any matter
 deleterious to its growth or which might affect its subsistence or hardiness when transplanted.
 The soil part of the mulch shall be the topsoil in which grass is growing and may include the 2
 inches {50 mm} immediately underlying the root system provided it is identical topsoil and no part
 of the less friable subsoil is taken.
 
 (b) Harvesting and Handling Grassy Mulch.
 1. Harvesting Operations.
 Grassy mulch shall be taken only from an approved source. The grassy mulch shall be
 procured only when the soil is in a moist, friable condition. During extremely dry periods it
 may be necessary to water the areas from which mulch is to be taken. Previous to any other
 manipulations, these areas shall be grubbed clear of any bushes or stubs and closely mowed
 and raked to remove all weeds and long standing stems. The material thus cleaned from the
 sites shall be burned. Such cleaning is deemed a necessary part of this Item and not
 considered under the Item of "Clearing and Grubbing." If directed, this operation may be
 omitted if the grass is sufficiently short and the area satisfactorily cleared of obstructions.
 After grubbing, mowing and raking, and sprinkling, if considered necessary, the grass shall be
 disced until the sod has been well mangled and the topsoil loosened to the depth it is to be
 taken. After discing, the grassy mulch shall be cast into windrows by an approved
 tractor-drawn or motor-powered blade grader.
 2. Loading.
 The well mixed topsoil and grass roots shall be loaded into trucks by hand shovels, power
 shovels, drag lines, or other mechanical loading devices. No grassy mulch shall be loaded
 which has been disced, but not windrowed, more than six hours or which has been windrowed
 more than 24 hours unless the loading operations have been interrupted by rain in sufficient
 quantity to wet the grassy mulch and make work impracticable. Loading shall be resumed as
 soon as practicable after such rain ceases. All material windrowed prior to such rain shall be
 loaded and placed within 24 hours after such rain ceases. In no case shall grassy mulch be
 used in which the grass has soured, mildewed or started to decay.
 
 749
 
 SECTION 860
 ROADSIDE IMPROVEMENT MATERIALS
 
 860.05 Solid Sod.
 (a) General.
 Solid sod shall be obtained from sources of the Contractor's selection meeting with the
 approval of the Engineer. The Contractor, without extra compensation, shall furnish such material
 and construct and maintain hauling roads necessary for obtaining the material.
 The sod shall be of common Tiflawn Bermudagrass, Centipede, Myers Zoysia, Zoysia Matrella,
 or other approved types of native or adaptable grasses, suitable for growing in the locality of the work.
 
 (b) Procuring and Handling Sod.
 1. General.
 All sod shall be procured from areas where the soil is fertile and contains a high
 percentage of loamy topsoil and where the grass is well rooted and full grown and from areas
 that have been grazed or mowed sufficiently to form a dense turf. (Approximately 2 inches
 {50 mm} in height at the time of lifting). The soil shall be free from obnoxious weeds or other
 grasses and shall not contain any matter deleterious to its growth. Solid sodding shall be
 living or seasonally dormant during the cold or dry season and have an established root
 system capable of continued growth. Solid sodding grown with a geotextile backing is
 acceptable for use at the Contractor’s option with no additional compensation. Solid sodding
 used in channel applications shall be rolled sod.
 2. Harvesting.
 Mechanical devices, such as sod cutters, may be used for cutting the sod into strips,
 blocks or rolls at least 12 inches {300 mm} wide, except when sod strips are specified, then
 they shall be at least 3 inches {75 mm} wide. Depth of sod cutting shall be such that
 approximately 3/4 of an inch {19 mm} of soil is removed with the turf. Care shall be exercised
 at all times to retain the native soil on the roots of the sod during the process of excavating,
 hauling, and planting.
 3. Handling.
 Sections of sod shall be cut away below the root line and shall be lifted and loaded in
 such a manner that no tearing or breaking will occur, and unloaded by hand or approved
 mechanical method. Dumping from vehicles will not be permitted. All broken or dried sod
 shall be rejected and removed from the job.
 4. Control.
 The sod shall, in general, be transplanted within three days from the time it is
 harvested. However, if held in temporary storage, the sod shall be spread in a shady location
 with the grass side up. The sod shall be sprinkled with water when and as directed. If
 required, it shall be covered with moist burlap, straw, or other acceptable material. Any sod
 permitted by the Contractor to dry out may be rejected whenever, in the judgment of the
 Engineer, its survival, after placing, shall have been rendered doubtful and no payment for
 such sod shall be made.
 In no event shall more than 10 days elapse between the cutting and planting of the sod.
 Prior to permitting sod planting, the Engineer will inspect the sod stacks for retention of
 native soil. Such may be accomplished by measuring the stack height and determining the
 average layer thickness (3/4 of an inch {19 mm} minimum).
 
 860.06 Vines, Shrubs and Trees.
 (a) General.
 1. The scientific and common names of plants shall be in conformity with the approved
 names in "Standardized Plant Names" (current edition) prepared by the American Joint Committee
 on Horticultural Nomenclature.
 2. Plants shall be in accordance with the American Standards for Nursery Stock (current
 edition), except as provided on the plans. All plants shall have normal habit of growth and shall be
 typically characteristic of the particular variety and species. All plants shall conform to the
 measurements provided, which are the minimum acceptable sizes. They shall be measured before
 pruning with branches in normal position. When a minimum and maximum size is provided, an
 average size is required. Deciduous trees shall be measured by approved calipers. Plants which
 hare been cut back from larger grades to meet these Specifications will not be acceptable. Plants
 shall be nursery grown and shall bear evidence of proper top and root pruning unless otherwise
 750
 
 SECTION 860
 ROADSIDE IMPROVEMENT MATERIALS
 provided. No cold storage plants will be accepted. Plants shall have been growing for a period of
 at least one year under the same climatic conditions as exist at the location to be planted. Where
 the Specifications or plans permit, planting stock which has been collected, such stock shall be
 clean, sound stock free from decayed or decaying stumps and from fire injury.
 3. For purpose of inspection, the Contractor shall give notice to the Engineer 48 hours in
 advance of the delivery of plant material. The Contractor shall be responsible for all certificates
 of inspection of plant materials that may be required by Federal, State or other authority to
 accompany shipments of plants. All plants shall be subject to inspection and approval by the
 Engineer at any place and at any time. Plants may be inspected where growing, but approval at
 place of growth shall not preclude the right of subsequent rejection of plants not fully meeting
 the requirements of the Specifications. After the award is made, the Engineer reserves the right to
 place Department seals on any and all materials selected, but such tagging and approval shall
 cover the type and body quality of the plant only, but not final acceptance. The removal and
 replacement of rejected plants shall be effected by the Contractor in compliance with the
 Specifications and shall be without extra compensation.
 4. Plants and plant qualities other than those named in the Specifications will be accepted
 only if approved.
 5. Legible labels shall be attached to all separate plants or boxes, bundles, bales, or other
 containers, indicating the name, size, age, or other necessary detailed information and the
 quantity contained in the individual bundles, boxes or bales.
 
 (b) Planting Limitations.
 Normal planting season for vines, shrubs, and trees is between December 1 and February 15
 and the Contractor shall make every effort to accomplish the planting during this period. Should,
 however, the contract time be such that plants cannot be placed during this period, the Engineer
 shall direct the placement of the plants at the earliest possible time the plant areas can be made
 available. Under conditions that require or if the Contractor elects to place the plants out of the
 normal planting season, all plants shall be container grown or pre-cured and planted in accordance
 with the following:
 Container Grown.
 Container grown plants shall have been grown in its container for a minimum of eight
 months.
 After plants are moved to their permanent location, they shall be watered in as
 specified, mulched, etc. Syringing down of the leaf areas shall be performed as necessary to
 prevent wilting, dehydration, and excessive shedding of new or old growth. This will require a
 period of thirty days or longer to assure that a given plant has been successfully
 transplanted.
 Pre-Cured.
 Pre-curing of plants is a technique that allows the planting of balled or burlap plant
 materials during period other than in the dormant period of planting season specified. The
 following procedure shall generally be followed to precure or hardening off a plant.
 1. Specified plants shall be dug and placed unpruned in a lath or green house.
 2. The ball shall be covered with well rotted sawdust.
 3. Humidity shall be maintained to such a degree that wilting or dehydration does
 not occur.
 4. Spray nozzles shall be of mist type, connected to suitable interrupter devices if
 necessary, so that water logging of the plant balls does not occur.
 5. After root hairs have formed, as evidenced by their emergence through the
 burlap, and with new and old top growth in a health, turgid condition, the
 plants shall be transplanted to their permanent location.
 6. This pre-curing period shall be a minimum of thirty days.
 7. Leaf drop or defoliation shall be limited to one-fourth the total leaves.
 8. After plants are moved to their permanent location, they shall be watered,
 mulched, etc. Syringing down of the leaf areas shall be performed as necessary
 to prevent wilting, dehydration, and excessive shedding of new or old growth.
 This will require a period of 30 days or longer to assure that a given plant has
 been successfully transplanted.
 
 751
 
 SECTION 860
 ROADSIDE IMPROVEMENT MATERIALS
 Any plantings accomplished outside of the normal planting season shall be inspected
 regularly and any plant found defective shall be removed and immediately replaced with the
 same size and kind in the same manner as originally provided.
 Any additional cost involved in planting out of season due either to the Contractor's
 inability to schedule his work properly or contract time requirements shall be considered
 incidental to the work and no additional compensation will be allowed.
 Planting will not be permitted during periods when the ground is frozen.
 
 (c) Digging and Transportation.
 1. All plants shall be dug with reasonable care and skill immediately before shipping,
 avoiding all possible injury to, or loss of roots. Plants shall be of the size, and with balls or roots
 spread, as shown on the plans. After plants are dug, their roots shall not be permitted to dry out,
 and they shall not be exposed to artificial heat or freezing temperatures.
 2. During transportation, all plants shall be packed or protected in such a manner as to
 insure adequate protection from sun, wind, and climatic or seasonal injuries. All bare-root plants
 shall have their roots carefully protected by wet straw, moss, or other suitable material.
 Tarpaulins or other covers shall be placed over plants when transported by truck or in an open
 freight car. Shipments made in box cars shall be adequately ventilated to prevent sweating. The
 head of each tree shall be tied in carefully to prevent fracturing or cracking the branches.
 3. Previous to shipment and after delivery to the project, all plants shall be properly
 protected. Bare-root plants shall be heeled-in in trenches with the bundles opened and the plants
 spaced separately and all roots covered. Balled and burlapped, and balled and platformed plants,
 shall have their earth balls protected by earth or wet cloth or straw. Where possible all plants
 shall be stored in a well-ventilated and shaded place and protected from wind and sun.
 
 (d) Trees.
 1. Trees shall be of the size and kind designated by the plans, have a straight trunk with a
 well-branched, symmetrical top, and with leader intact. Trees shall have no fresh cuts of limbs
 over 3/4 of an inch {19 mm} which have not completely calloused over, no cut back trees, and no
 abrasions of the bark. Trees must be free from insect and disease injury. Trees injured in transit
 or delivered in an unsatisfactory manner will be rejected. Trees must have good fibrous root
 systems. All root cuts must be cleanly cut.
 2. At the time of digging, bare-root trees (B.R.) must be puddled in a clay solution of
 proper consistency to coat and adhere to all parts of the root system. Any tree may be supplied
 balled and burlapped instead of bare-root at the unit price bid.
 3. Balled and burlapped trees (B & B) shall be adequately balled with firm, natural balls of
 sufficient size to insure the growth of the plants or cut to size shown on the plans. Balls shall be
 firmly wrapped with burlap or other approved strong cloth and firmly tied with rope or other
 satisfactory material. No balled plant will be acceptable if cracked or broken before or during the
 process of planting, and no plant will be acceptable which is handled by the plant itself and not by
 the ball. All fibrous and pliable roots encountered in trenching around the ball shall be cut off
 flush with the outer side of the trench, the ground in the trench loosened with spading fork, and
 the flexible roots shall be immediately wrapped in burlap, moss, or straw and bound against the
 side of the ball. Only stiff roots may be cut off flush with the ball. The ball of earth for each tree
 shall be of sufficient depth to include all lateral roots.
 4. Balled and platformed trees (B & P) shall be balled as provided for balled and burlapped
 trees. Platforms shall be square or octagonal shaped in a size slightly larger than the diameter of
 the bottom of the soil weight {mass}, inserted under each ball and securely lashed to the ball by
 means of ties from the platform corners to the rope collar on top of the ball.
 
 (e) Shrubs.
 Shrubs shall be of the size and kind designated by the plans. Bare-root shrubs shall have good
 fibrous root systems. Balled and burlapped shrubs shall be vigorous, well furnished plants of
 uniform quality and must have fibrous root systems. Plants provided as sods or clumps shall be
 collected from good soil which has produced a fibrous root system typical of the nature of the
 plant. The sods shall be dug with earth and incidental vegetation adhering to the roots. If the soil
 or habit of the root growth is such that the roots are not adequately protected, the sods shall be
 wrapped in burlap or other suitable material.
 
 752
 
 SECTION 860
 ROADSIDE IMPROVEMENT MATERIALS
 
 (f) Vines and Perennials.
 Vines and perennials shall be of the size and kind designated by the plans. Bare-root vines
 shall be vigorous, well furnished plants with good vigorous root systems, puddled before delivery
 or otherwise protected by an acceptable method. Pot-grown plants (P.G.) shall be vigorous
 well-developed plants, well established in pots with sufficient roots to hold the earth together
 intact after removal from containers and at the same time not to be root-bound. Upon permission
 of the Engineer due to lateness of planting in the spring season causing a hold-over of the planting
 of vines to the next season, the Contractor may furnish and plant potted plants of the kinds of
 vines designated as bare-root, provided the potted plants are at least one year old, the pots 2.5
 inches {63 mm} minimum diameter, and two plants for the one ordered are furnished and planted
 in the same pocket holes or beds as specified. The two plants will be paid for at the unit price for
 one plant. Balled and burlapped vines shall be vigorous, well-developed plants. Perennials shall be
 field grown unless otherwise provided.
 
 (g) Pine Seedlings.
 Pine seedlings shall be Loblolly Pine for the North Alabama Planting Zone and Slash Pine in
 South Alabama Planting Zone, unless otherwise shown on the plans or in the proposal. Seedlings
 shall be approximately one year old and 6 to 12 inches {150 to 300 mm} high, except that any
 longleaf seedlings shall be root pruned and needle clipped.
 Pine seedlings that are shipped in bales shall be protected from the sun, wind, and freezing
 weather at all times before planting. The bales shall be stacked loosely to permit free circulation
 of air and not more than two bales high. They shall be watered on arrival and every two days
 thereafter, or as directed. Seedlings from damaged or broken bales shall be "heeled in" by cutting
 V-bottom trenches approximately 6 inches {150 mm} deep, spreading the pines along the trench
 with the roots down. Roots shall be covered with fine soil, leaving the tops exposed. Seedlings
 shall be watered frequently enough to keep the soil moist.
