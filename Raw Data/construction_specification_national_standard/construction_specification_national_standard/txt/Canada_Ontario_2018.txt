 Appendix 201-A, November 2011 FOR USE WHILE DESIGNING MUNICIPAL CONTRACTS
 
 Note:
 
 This is a non-mandatory Commentary Appendix intended to provide information to a designer, during the design stage of a contract, on the use of the OPS specification in a municipal contract. This appendix does not form part of the standard specification. Actions and considerations discussed in this appendix are for information purposes only and do not supersede an Owner's design decisions and methodology.
 
 Designer Action/Considerations
 
 The designer should specify the following in the Contract Documents:
 
 - Areas identified for clearing, close cut clearing, grubbing, removal of surface boulders and removal of piled boulders, and mechanical stump cutting, in addition to those areas required by this specification. (201.07)
 
 - Areas identified as being environmentally sensitive. (201.07.01)
 
 - Areas for clearing and close cut clearing within Crown Land. (201.07.01)
 
 - Areas where cut trees are to be stacked. (201.07.01)
 
 - The areas where work is to be done in or near waterbodies or waterbody banks. (201.07.01)
 
 - Review crown land clearing with Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) to determine volume of marketable timber available. (201.07.01)
 
 - Identify holders of sustainable forest licences and their addresses from the MNR and make them available to the Contractor. (201.07.01)
 
 - Method of measurement for clearing, close cut clearing, and grubbing. (201.09.01.01)
 
 When surface boulders and piled boulders are to be removed that are outside the general grading limits, the Removal of Surface Boulders and Removal of Piled Boulders items should be used.
 
 Swamp excavation areas do not require grubbing, therefore, designers should not include a grubbing quantity in the Contract Documents for these areas.
 The designer should include an additional quantity for individual boulders over 1 m3 in the rock excavation quantity. (201.10.01)

 Acceptance Criteria for Strength and Thickness
 
 350.08.01.01
 
 General
 
 Acceptance of the concrete pavement or concrete base for each lot will be based on the mean and standard deviation of the lot measurements for core compressive strength and slab thickness. The Contract Administrator will calculate the Percent Within Limits for each criteria as described in LS-101.
 
 350.08.01.02
 
 Core Compressive Strength and Slab Thickness
 
 The slab thickness will be determined based on core length for each sublot, each core shall be measured for length prior to trimming. Four measurements rounded to the nearest millimetre shall be made around the perimeter of the core to determine the actual concrete thickness. These measurements shall be taken at the ends of two perpendicular diameters.
 
 Cores will be tested for compressive strength when the concrete is 30 to 42 days old. If the contractor elects to core prior to 28 days, the compressive strength tests will be performed within two days of coring. The cores shall be stored in the laboratory at an ambient air temperature of  15C and  25C and moisture conditioned for 40 - 48 hours prior to testing. The testing shall be according to CSA A23.2-9C.
 
 If the lot PWL is greater than or equal to 90%, the lot is acceptable for the criteria. If the lot PWL is greater than 90%, the lot will be accepted with a bonus for the criteria. If the lot PWL is less than 90% and greater than or equal to 50%, the lot is accepted for the criteria with a price adjustment. If the lot PWL is less than 50%, the lot is rejectable and shall be subject to repair and reassessment.
 
 Notwithstanding the overall PWL, if any individual core compressive strength or if any individual length is less than 60% of the specified compressive strength or specified slab thickness, the Contractor shall repair the sublot.
 
 For calculation of PWL, the lower limit is 30 MPa for compressive strength. The lower limit for thickness shall be specified as the design thickness minus 5 mm.
 
 350.08.01.03
 
 Lot Size
 
 350.08.01.03.01
 
 Compressive Strength and Thickness
 
 A lot shall consist of the total quantity of concrete pavement or concrete base on the contract of the same specified thickness.
 
 Each lot will be divided into 1000 m2 sublots or a minimum of three sublots for compressive strength and thickness. The Owner will test one core from each sublot to determine the core compressive strength and slab thickness.
 
 350.08.01.04
 
 Re-testing
 
 350.08.01.04.01
 
 Compressive Strength and Thickness
 
 The Contractor or the Contract Administrator may question an individual test result within three working days of receiving the test result for that sublot. The Contractor shall notify the Owner of his intention to re-core. A new core shall be obtained from locations adjacent to the location of the original set of cores. The new core shall be obtained at a maximum age of 56 days and tested not later than 7 days after the coring. The lot will be re-evaluated as specified under basis of payment.

 Removal of Unacceptable Concrete
 
 If individual sublot results for core compressive strength or thickness of concrete pavement or concrete base dictates removal and replacement of a sublot, additional cores shall be taken by the Contractor to establish the extent of the deficient area.
 
 The cores shall be taken at 3 m intervals along the length of the pavement in both directions starting 3 m from the location of the original core.
 
 The area to be removed shall be bounded by the nearest contraction joint and longitudinal joint or concrete pavement or concrete base edge outside the deficient area so that there shall be no additional joints.
 
 Where the overall sublot results dictate removal and replacement, the Contractor shall remove and replace the entire sublot.
 
 350.08.01.06
 
 Cracking in Concrete Pavement
 
 All cracking, in excess of one third the depth of the slab thickness shall be repaired as a full depth repair according to OPSS 360.
 
 Cracks less than one-third the thickness of the slab shall be repaired according to OPSS 364.

 Appendix 361-A, November 2011 FOR USE WHILE DESIGNING MUNICIPAL CONTRACTS
 
 Note:
 
 This is a non-mandatory Commentary Appendix intended to provide information to a designer, during the design stage of a contract, on the use of the OPS specification in a municipal contract. This appendix does not form part of the standard specification. Actions and considerations discussed in this appendix are for information purposes only and do not supersede an Owner's design decisions and methodology.
 
 Designer Action/Considerations
 
 Other concrete pavement rehabilitation treatments should be considered prior to specifying rubblizing. For effective rubblizing, the concrete slab shall be free of delamination and material deterioration.
 
 This specification is written as a method specification identifying a unique process incorporating a resonant frequency pavement breaker. Gradation control of the final product is based on visual assessment of the rubblized material. When greater gradation control is required of the final product, full depth removal of the concrete pavement and off-site crushing is recommended.
 
 All overlying bituminous material shall be fully removed prior to rubblizing. Payment for removal of bituminous material shall be under separate items.
 
 The designer should ensure that areas previously repaired with full depth asphalt are removed to ensure uniform performance of the rubblized material.
 
 Proper subgrade support for the rubblizing operation shall be assessed during precontract engineering.
 
 Granular A material for backfill purposes may be substituted with an alternate crushed granular material. When paving directly on the rubblized surface, a hot mix asphalt levelling course is recommended. If an alternate material is required, this must be indicated in the Contract Documents.
 
 The designer should identify the thickness of the concrete slab to be rubblized and identify the type of embedded steel in the concrete slab.
 
 Pavement drainage systems including ditch, sub-drains, and outlets are to be staged so that they are installed and operational prior to rubblizing operations beginning.
 
 Operations should be staged so that the lateral pavement edge support remains in place until the rubblizing operations are completed. This is to ensure that the maximum impact energy is transferred to the concrete slab.
 
 Since only construction traffic is permitted on the rubblized surface, traffic staging should be shown in the Contract Documents.
 
 The designer should ensure that the General Conditions of Contract and the 100 Series General Specifications are included in the Contract Documents.

 Cement Mortar Lining
 
 462.07.10.07.01
 
 General
 
 The lining shall consist of a one-course application of pre-mixed cement mortar, 5 mm  1.5 mm thick, and shall be placed by a machine projecting the mortar against the wall of the pipe and long radius bends, by centrifugal force, without injurious rebound and with sufficient velocity to cause the mortar to be densely packed and to adhere in place.

 Mortar that has attained its initial set shall not be used.
 
 Mortar of improper consistency that does not provide a dense homogenous lining that holds itself firmly against the pipe surface and all waste materials, spatter, etc., shall be removed from the pipe. Only mortar of suitable consistency and applied with sufficient velocity to adhere firmly to the surface of the pipe shall form the lining.
 
 If any section of the lining fails or shows evidence of failure or unusual irregularity, the faulty section of lining shall be removed to the extent indicated by the Contract Administrator and the pipe re-cleaned and the lining replaced.
 
 462.07.10.07.02
 
 Trowelling
 
 The interior surface of the pipe shall be mechanically trowelled to produce a smooth surface.
 
 462.07.10.07.03
 
 Hand Work
 
 Edges of linings at openings or ends of lined sections shall be neatly finished. Edges shall be rounded or beveled so as to avoid sharp angles or abrupt changes in sections. Surfaces of cement mortar lining to which additional mortar is to be placed shall be moistened just before the mortar is applied.
 
 Hand finishing work in a section of the pipe shall be completed within 24 hours following the machine application of the mortar lining.
 
 462.07.10.08
 
 Closing of Pipe
 
 Immediately upon completion of the cement mortar lining of a section of pipe, all openings in the pipe shall be closed in accordance with the Bulkheads on Open Pipe Ends clause to prevent circulation of air.
 
 462.07.10.09
 
 Curing
 
 As soon as practical, without damaging the cement mortar lining, water shall be introduced into the section of pipe between bulkheads in order to maintain a moist environment.
 
 462.07.10.10
 
 Backflushing
 
 When the lining has achieved sufficient set, all services shall be backflushed with water or another method approved by the Contract Administrator to remove any mortar deposited in them.
 
 462.07.10.11
 
 Obstruction in the Water Services
 
 Should any water service be partially or fully obstructed, the obstruction shall be removed in a manner approved by the Contract Administrator.

 Appendix 463-A, November 2015 FOR USE WHILE DESIGNING MUNICIPAL CONTRACTS
 
 Note:
 
 This is a non-mandatory Commentary Appendix intended to provide information to a designer, during the design stage of a contract, on the use of the OPS specification in a municipal contract. This appendix does not form part of the standard specification. Actions and considerations discussed in this appendix are for information purposes only and do not supersede an Owner's design decisions and methodology.
 
 Designer Action/Considerations
 
 This specification was written to encompass the majority of pipe bursting operations for small and medium sized projects. However, the basic design considerations should always include properly planned entry and exit points, grade of existing host pipe, adjacent Utilities, and connection requirements.
 
 The International Pipe Bursting Association (IPBA) normally assigns pipe bursting work to one of three classifications. These following classifications (January 2012 version) are intended for use as general guidelines when considering replacement of existing pipe by pipe bursting techniques. The classification should be determined based on the more stringent parameter in the table below.
 
 IPBA Classification and Degree of Difficulty
 A - Minimal

 Incompressible Constricted soils outside trench geometry trench. (width less than or equal to outside diameter of bursting head).
 
 D - Developmental
 
 The designer may consider a pre-qualification process to ensure that the contractor(s) possess the required capabilities and qualifications to undertake the work required under the contract.
 The designer should include the following in the Contract Documents:
 
 Page 9
 
 Rev. Date 11/2015 OPSS 463
 
 Appendix 463-A
 - Pipe type, class, pressure rating, and size. (463.05.01)
 - Valve type, class, pressure rating, and size. (463.05.02)
 - Product ovality. (463.07.01)
 - Service connection work. (463.07.12.03)
 - Benching restoration. (463.07.14)
 - Testing of product joining and installation. (463.07.15)
 - Verification record requirements. (463.07.16)
 - Acceptance criteria. (463.08.01)
 The designer should determine if the following are required and, if so, they should be specified in the Contract Documents:
 - Exposing existing facilities. (463.07.03)
 - Use of temporary potable water supply services. (463.07.09)
 - Product by-pass. (463.07.10)
 - Joining and pulling product as one length. (463.07.12.01)
 - Use of a weak link, breakway connector, or load monitor. (463.07.13)
 - Wall restoration. (463.07.14)
 - Completion of a CCTV inspection. (463.07.15)
 The designer should give consideration, in consultation with the pipe manufacturer, to minimum allowable product bending radii commensurate with the pipeline's strength.
 The designer should give special consideration to the required grades at the entry and exit points. The designer may undertake a CCTV inspection and location analysis prior to pipe bursting to review the existing line and grade to determine if deviations are acceptable.
 Product upsizing by using a pipe bursting technique may induce stresses in the surrounding soil resulting in potential damage to nearby Utilities and foundations. The degree of distortion on the zone of influence is a function of the degree of upsizing, the pipe material of a nearby Utility, the location of nearby Utilities in relation to the pipe burst pipe, and the soil conditions. The designer may consider exposure of critical services by non-destructive methods to monitor the pipe bursting progress and impacts.
 The designer should consider the need for product bypass, temporary potable water supply services, or temporary flow stoppage or blockage with inflatable plugs during the pipe bursting operation. The designer may require that during the execution of the work, the flow shall be bypassed around the product being replaced and the continuity of service to each facility connected to the affected section of product be maintained. The designer should consider what should be done if there is an extended service disruption.
 
 Page 10
 
 Rev. Date 11/2015 OPSS 463
 
 Appendix 463-A
 For certain product installations, the designer may consider the requirement of a weak link, breakaway connector, or load monitor to prevent excess pulling force from damaging the product.
 The designer should consider the type of interface and the degree of continuity between the product and the existing structure to ensure appropriate anchoring and seals in order to prevent product retraction or inadvertent leaks to the new system.
 The designer may specify the completion of a CCTV inspection of the product after installation, particularly when grade thresholds are critical. In smaller diameter product installations when the designer elects to complete a CCTV survey, the designer may wish to specify a lighter interior colour of the product installation, if available.
 Testing of product joining and installation may include hydrostatic, air, BACT-T, etc.
 Verification record requirements may include such information as reporting information available from the pipe bursting machine, daylighting, installation of tracer wire with the product, the use of acoustic or magnetic locating equipment, etc.
 Acceptance criteria requirements may include such considerations as successful bursting operation from entry to pull back location; CCTV inspection, removal of extra coupon pipe length from the pull back pit to view for stresses, grade verification, etc.
 The designer may consider including a process regarding payment for failed pipe bursting attempts in the Contract Documents.
 The tender item description for Product Installation by Pipe Bursting should include reference to one or more of the attributes shown (i.e., type of product, diameter of product, and use of product) to be complete.
 The designer should ensure that the General Conditions of Contract and the 100 Series General Specifications are included in the Contract Documents.

 Appendix 492-A, November 2015 FOR USE WHILE DESIGNING MUNICIPAL CONTRACTS
 
 Note:
 
 This is a non-mandatory Commentary Appendix intended to provide information to a designer, during the design stage of a contract, on the use of the OPS specification in a municipal contract. This appendix does not form part of the standard specification. Actions and considerations discussed in this appendix are for information purposes only and do not supersede an Owner's design decisions and methodology.
 
 Designer Action/Considerations
 
 The designer should specify the following in the Contract Documents:
 
 - Levels, grades, and contours for rough grading. (492.07.02)
 
 - Lines and elevations for final grading. (492.07.02)
 
 - Requirements for temporary roadway. (492.07.03)
 
 - Type of granular subbase and base courses and surface course. (492.07.03)
 
 - Dimensions of the granular subbase and base courses and surface course. (492.07.03)
 
 - OPSS 310 or OPSS 313 for asphalt pavement. (492.07.03, a))

 When temporary potable water supply services are used on full right-of-way reconstruction projects, the temporary potable water supply service piping shall also be buried at all sidewalks, driveways, and walkways.
 
 When temporary potable water supply services are used on projects when the road surface is not being reconstructed, the temporary service piping shall be buried only at all road crossings. When temporary watermains or temporary potable water supply services cross a driveway or a sidewalk, asphalt or another acceptable material shall be mounded over the pipe. A polyethylene sheet shall be placed as a barrier on concrete or interlocking driveways. If the work performed or material used is not to the satisfaction of the Contract Administrator, action shall be taken to rectify the problem. Safety flashers and barricades, as may be required, shall be furnished and maintained. In general, the temporary potable water supply service pipe shall be laid where it causes the least obstruction and is least likely to be damaged.
 
 The Contractor shall protect the temporary potable water supply services installed across all road crossings, sidewalks, driveways, and walkways during the extent of the construction schedule. This shall include earth excavation, backfill, asphalt reinstatement, and ramping material required as directed by the Contract Administrator.
 
 The Contractor shall provide adequate signage at locations where hoses are exposed and may present a public safety hazard, such as blow off hoses at catchbasins.

 Flushing and Disinfecting Temporary Watermains and Services
 
 Flushing and disinfecting operations shall be conducted in the presence of the Contract Administrator. The Contract Administrator shall be notified at least 2 Business Days in advance of the proposed date on which flushing and disinfecting operations are to commence. Watermains shall be flushed in a sequence approved by the Contract Administrator. All temporary watermains and services shall be flushed at a flow velocity adequate to remove any foreign debris and until the discharged water runs clear.
 
 After flushing is completed, water from the existing distribution system shall be allowed to flow at a controlled rate into the new temporary watermain. Liquid chlorine solution shall be introduced so that the chlorine is distributed throughout the section being disinfected at chlorine concentration of 50 mg/litre minimum throughout the section. The system shall be left charged with the chlorine solution for 24 hours.

 Rev. Date: 11/2015 OPSS 493
 
 Sampling and testing for chlorine residual shall be carried out in the presence of the Contract Administrator. The chlorine residual shall be tested in the section after 24 hours. If tests indicate a chlorine residual of 25 mg/litre minimum, the section shall be flushed completely and recharged with water normal to the operation of the system. If the test does not meet the requirements, the chlorination procedure shall be repeated until satisfactory results are obtained.
 
 Twenty-four hours after the system has been recharged and ready for operation, the Contract Administrator shall ensure that samples are taken for bacteriological tests. Samples shall be collected from every 350 m of the new watermain plus one sample from each end of each line and at least one sample from each branch. If there is indication of contamination, the disinfection procedure shall be repeated.
 
 The temporary water supply service shall not be put into operation or the existing watermain removed from operation until approval has been given by the Contract Administrator.
 
 Regular sampling and testing for chlorine residual shall be carried out by the Contract Administrator.

 Appendix 493-A, November 2009 FOR USE WHILE DESIGNING MUNICIPAL CONTRACTS
 
 Note:
 
 This is a non-mandatory Commentary Appendix intended to provide information to a designer, during the design stage of a contract, on the use of the OPS specification in a municipal contract. This appendix does not form part of the standard specification. Actions and considerations discussed in this appendix are for information purposes only and do not supersede an Owner's design decisions and methodology.
 
 Designer Action/Considerations
 
 The designer may consider including soil boring data, a geotechnical report, a subsurface report, or a soils report in the Tender Documents.
 
 The designer should include the following in the Contract Documents:
 
 - Pipe size, type, and class. (493.05.01)
 
 - Temporary hydrant requirements. (493.05.04)
 
 - Temporary potable water supply services connection requirements to buildings other than single residential units. (493.07.01)
 
 - Time requirements for restoring the temporary potable water supply service should it fail. (493.07.01)
 
 - Temporary potable water supply services to buildings other than single residential units, including flow to maintain fire protection systems. (493.07.03)
 
 - Temporary hydrant and the necessary valves and fittings to be installed and maintained. (493.07.04)
 
 Where conditions of high ground water exist, external fluids may enter via air release and air/vacuum release valves, therefore, appropriate measures shall be taken.
 
 The designer should ensure that the General Conditions of Contract and the 100 Series General Specifications are included in the Contract Documents.

 Appendix 753-A, November 2013 FOR USE WHILE DESIGNING MUNICIPAL CONTRACTS
 
 Note:
 
 This is a non-mandatory Commentary Appendix intended to provide information to a designer, during the design stage of a contract, on the use of the OPS specification in a municipal contract. This appendix does not form part of the standard specification. Actions and considerations discussed in this appendix are for information purposes only and do not supersede an Owner's design decisions and methodology.
 
 Designer Action/Considerations
 
 The designer should specify the following in the Contract Documents:
 
 - Connecticut Impact Attenuation System locations. (753.07.01)
 
 The designer should determine to which standard Connecticut Impact Attenuation Systems should be installed and specify it in the Contract Documents:
 
 a) The Connecticut Impact Attenuation System should only be installed at a 10 skew to the centreline of the roadway when the length of the median hazard and the median width can accommodate a Connecticut Impact Attenuation System at each end of the hazard within the limits specified in OPSD 923.245. In this case, the designer should specify that the system be installed according to OPSD 923.245.
 
 b) The Connecticut Impact Attenuation System should only be installed at a 0 skew to the centreline of the roadway when the length of the median hazard is too long and the median width is too narrow to accommodate a Connecticut Impact Attenuation System at each end of the hazard within the limits specified in OPSD 923.245. In this case, the designer should specify that the system be installed according to OPSD 923.244.
 
 Wherever possible, the designer should eliminate the use of curb with gutter, in advance of and along the length of end treatments and crash cushions. See the MTO Roadside Safety Manual for additional information.
 
 The designer should ensure that the General Conditions of Contract and the 100 Series General Specifications are included in the Contract Documents.

 Appendix 902-A, November 2010 FOR USE WHILE DESIGNING MUNICIPAL CONTRACTS
 
 Note:
 
 This is a non-mandatory Commentary Appendix intended to provide information to a designer, during the design stage of a contract, on the use of the OPS specification in a municipal contract. This appendix does not form part of the standard specification. Actions and considerations discussed in this appendix are for information purposes only and do not supersede an Owner's design decisions and methodology.
 
 Designer Action/Considerations
 
 The designer should specify the following in the Contract Documents:
 
 - Geotextile requirements. (902.05.04)
 
 - Neat lines of excavations for footings, working slabs, and granular pads. (902.07.05.02)
 
 - Neat lines of excavation for backfill and frost tapers. (902.07.05.03)
 
 - Grade of backfill around abutments, piers, and other permanent work. (902.06.01)
 
 - Lines and grades for granular materials. (902.06.01)
 
 - Measurement units for granular material. (902.09.01.02)
 
 The designer should determine if the following is required and, if so, it should be specified in the Contract Documents:
 
 - Clay seals and dimensions for clay seals. (902.07.07)
 
 OPSS 902 contains information written for provincial contracts. To ensure completeness of municipal Contract Documents, the designer should invoke Appendix 902-B. The appendix contains supplemental requirements that modify OPSS 902 so it can be used by a municipality in its contracts.
 
 The designer should ensure that the General Conditions of Contract and the 100 Series General Specifications are included in the Contract Documents.

 AL, 0.25 DL, 0.50 DL, 0.75 DL, 1.00 DL, 1.20 DL, 1.33 DL, AL, and adjust to lock-off load
 
 Where: AL = alignment load DL = specified working load of anchorage
 
 At the test load of 1.33 DL, the load shall remain constant for 10 minutes and the total movement shall be recorded at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 minutes. If the difference between the total movements at 1 minute and 10 minutes exceeds 1 mm, the test load shall be maintained for an additional 50 minutes, and the movements readings shall be recorded at 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes. The anchor shall be returned to AL after holding the load at test load for 50 minutes and the residual movement recorded.
 
 The hydraulic pressure during the load hold period shall not deviate by more than 0.35 MPa and the load shall be returned to the test load prior to taking the movement reading. The total movements at each load increment shall be recorded.
 
 942.07.12.06.04
 
 Lock-Off Procedure
 
 After testing has been completed, the load in the tendon shall be such that, after seating losses (wedge seating), the specified lock-off load has been applied to the anchor tendon.
 
 The magnitude of the lock-off load shall be 1.10 DL or as specified by the Contract Administrator and shall not exceed 70% of the ultimate load of the tendon or bar (Fpu).
 The wedges shall be seated at a minimum load of 50% of Fpu. If the lock-off load is less than 50%, shims shall be used under the wedge plate and the wedges seated at 50% of Fpu. The shims shall then be removed to reduce the load in the tendon to the desired lock-off load. Bar tendons may be locked off at any load less than 70% of Fpu.

 Lift-Off Tests
 
 A minimum of three lift-off tests shall be conducted at each site. The location of the anchor to be tested and the time of test shall be as determined by the Quality Verification Engineer. The lift-off test shall not be performed until 48 hours has elapsed after transferring the lock-off load. The method of testing shall be as detailed on the Working Drawings.
 
 The lift-off test shall be performed after transferring the load to the anchor and prior to removing the jack from its location. The lift-off load shall be determined by re-applying the load to the tendon or bar to lift off the wedge plate or anchor nut without unseating the wedges or turning the anchor nut.
 
 942.07.12.07
 
 Acceptance Criteria
 
 An anchor shall be considered acceptable when all three of the following acceptance test criteria are satisfied:
 
 a) The total creep movement at test load during the last log time cycle is less than 1.5 mm.
 
 b) The apparent free stressing length based on the elastic movement at the test load is not less than 80% of the designed free stressing length.
 
 c) The load measured during the lift-off test is within 10% of the designed lock-off load.
 
 942.07.12.08
 
 Unacceptable Stressing Results
 
 For the anchorages that do not meet the acceptance criteria for the performance test or the proof test, the Contractor shall submit one of the following alternatives as a proposal to the Contract Administrator for approval:
 
 a) Abandon the deficient anchor and install a new anchor.
 
 b) Lock-off the anchors at no more than 50% of the accepted test load sustained during test or as determined by the Contract Administrator and install an additional anchor to compensate for the deficiency.
 
 c) Post grout the anchor at a grouting pressure not exceeding 3.6 MPa or as recommended by the Contract Administrator and then conduct a proof test and apply the acceptance criteria to the test results. The post grouting shall be terminated immediately if any distress on the ground surface is observed during grouting.
 
 d) Readjust the transfer load to 1.10 DL for an anchor that does not meet the lift-off criteria and repeat the test after a minimum of 48 hours. If the anchor does not meet the lift-off test criteria after completing this procedure, it shall be considered unacceptable.
