 SECTION 101 – GENERAL INFORMATION
 101.01 INTRODUCTION
 The 2007 Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction are written to the Bidder before Award and to the
 Contractor after Award. Sentences that are written as commands are directed to the Contractor. For example, a
 requirement to construct a cofferdam would be expressed as, “Construct cofferdams to ensure the stability of the
 excavation and to keep the excavation free of water,” rather than “The Contractor shall construct cofferdams to ensure
 the stability of the excavation and to keep the excavation free of water.”
 Titles and headings of sections and subsections are for convenience and do not bear on the meaning of the text.
 Whenever any Section, Subsection, Subpart, or Subheading is amended in the Special Provisions by such terms as
 changed to, deleted, or added, it is construed to mean that it amends that Section, Subsection, Subpart, or Subheading of
 the Standard Specifications.
 When a publication is specified or referenced, if no issue or effective date for the publication is specified, use the issue or
 version of the publication that is current at the opening of bids.

 101.04. The Bidder shall evaluate subsurface conditions to determine how these conditions may affect the methods and
 cost and time of construction. The Bidder shall evaluate, with respect to possible material sources, the quality and
 quantity of material available, applicable regulatory requirements, and the type and extent of processing that may be
 required to produce material conforming to the requirements of the Contract. It is understood and agreed that the Bidder
 
 8
 
 has considered in its bid all of the permanent and temporary utilities in their present, new, or relocated positions to the
 extent required by the Contract and as revealed by its own investigations. It is also understood and agreed that the
 Bidder is aware that a Utility’s service demands, field conditions, and emergencies may affect the Utility’s ability to
 comply with the proposed schedules for utility work.
 Items 1 through 3 below are not a part of the Contract and are made available for information only. The boring logs and
 pavement cores are part of the Contract, but any reports or interpretations of them are provided for information only.
 The Department makes no representation, warranty, or guarantee, expressed or implied, by making reports or
 interpretations available. It is the Bidder’s responsibility to obtain the following information:
 1.
 
 Evaluation of Subsurface and Surface Conditions. The Bidder may inspect the records of the
 Department’s subsurface investigation through the Department’s Engineering Documents Unit, 1035 Parkway
 Avenue, P.O. Box 600, Trenton, NJ 08625-0600. This investigation is not a substitute for the Bidder’s own
 evaluation or judgment in preparing a bid. The Bidder should not rely on any estimates or quantities included
 in these investigations. The conditions indicated by such investigations or records thereof, and as shown by
 the cross-sections in the Plans may not be representative of those existing throughout such areas. The Bidder
 may encounter materials other than, or in proportions different from, those indicated.
 The soil and rock descriptions shown on the boring logs are determined by a visual inspection of samples
 from the various explorations, unless otherwise noted. The Department may make these samples available for
 nondestructive examination. The observed water levels and other water conditions indicated on the boring
 logs are as recorded at the time of the exploration. These levels and other conditions may vary considerably,
 with time, according to the prevailing climate, rainfall, and other factors. If a generalized soil profile is
 described in the text, it is intended to convey trends in subsurface conditions. The boundaries between strata
 are approximate and idealized and have been developed by interpretations of widely spaced explorations and
 samples.
 The Bidder is charged with knowledge of the State’s physical geography and geology, and in performing its
 Project Limit evaluation is fully aware of the available publications on that subject matter.
 
 2.
 
 Utility Agreements. In addition to what is specified in 105.07, the Bidder may inspect or request the Utility
 agreements, modifications, and orders relating to the Contract through the Department’s Division of Project
 Management, 1035 Parkway Avenue, P.O. Box 600, Trenton, NJ 08625-0600. The Bidder shall obtain
 information regarding existing utilities, proposed construction of utilities, or relocation of utilities through the
 respective Utility.
 
 3.
 
 Existing Plans and As-Builts. The Department will provide a list of existing structures within the Project on
 the Plans. The Department will list the existing plans and as-builts used in the development of the Contract in
 the Special Provisions. The Bidder may inspect as-built plans of Department-owned facilities or order copies
 upon written request through the Engineering Documents Unit. Contour maps may be available for some
 Projects. Bidders may inspect such maps, or the Bidder may obtain copies for their use upon written request
 to the Engineering Documents Unit. The Bidder shall obtain plans of municipality-owned or county-owned
 facilities through the municipality or county. The Bidder shall verify information obtained from the existing
 documents with regard to its application to bidding and performing the Contract.
 
 Submission of a bid is confirmation that the Bidder has made an independent evaluation and examination and is fully
 aware of the requirements of the Contract, including all restrictions. Further, the Bidder warrants that the bid prices
 include all costs to complete the Work.
 102.05 INTERPRETATION OF QUANTITIES IN THE PROPOSAL
 The quantities appearing in the Proposal are estimates. The Department has a right to increase or decrease the quantities
 of Work, or has the right to eliminate Items in their entirety, at its sole discretion.
 The Department will pay only for the quantities of work completed as specified in the Contract.
 102.06 “IF AND WHERE DIRECTED”
 The Proposal may include Items for which the Department has designated quantities as “if and where directed.” The
 estimated quantities set out in the Proposal for “if and where directed” quantities are presented for the purpose of
 
 9
 
 obtaining a representative bid price, but are not indicative of the Department’s intent regarding incorporation into the
 Project. The RE has the right to direct the Contractor to perform work using “if and where directed” quantities.
 102.07 PREPARATION OF THE BID
 The bid is the completed Proposal documents that are submitted by the Bidder to the Department at the time for the
 opening of bids. The Bidder shall submit a bid produced from the software that was downloaded from the Department’s
 electronic bidding website. The Bidder shall include all addenda in the bid. The Bidder shall specify a price in numerals
 for each Item. The Bidder shall insert the price in the box provided for the lump sum Item under the column designated
 as “Amounts.” For unit price Items, the Bidder shall insert the per unit price under the column designated “Unit Price”
 in the appropriate box at the location provided therefore. When the Bidder intends to bid zero ($0.00) for an Item, the
 Bidder shall insert a “0” in the “Unit Price” and “Amounts” columns for unit price Items or in the “Amounts” column for
 lump sum Items.
 Where no numeral is provided by the Bidder in either the “Unit Price” or the “Amount” columns for one or more Items,
 or where no figure is provided in the “Amount” column for one or more lump sum Items, the Department will consider
 the amount bid to be zero ($0.00) for that Item.
 When the Proposal contains alternate Items, the Bidder shall insert only the unit price and amount for the lowest priced
 alternate Item. When alternate Items in the Proposal have a lump sum pay quantity, the Bidder shall insert only the
 amount for the lowest priced alternate Item. The Bidder shall construct the alternate Item for which a price has been
 provided. When the Proposal contains groups of alternate Items, the Bidder shall insert only the unit price and amount
 for each Item within the lowest priced alternate group. The Bidder shall construct the alternate group of Items for which
 a price has been provided.
 The only entries permitted in the bid are the unit or lump sum prices for Items to be bid. The software will perform all
 extensions of the unit or lump sum prices and calculate the total bid amounts.
 The Bidder shall check the bid before submission using the software. The Bidder shall select “tools” and then select
 “check bid” and ensure that there are no errors before submitting the electronic bid. For bids submitted by Joint
 Ventures select “tools” from the software menu and mark the electronic bid as “Joint Bid.” The Bidder may print a
 completed bid for its records after completing the bid.
 102.08 BALANCED BIDS
 The Bidder shall reflect in the bid price for each Item the cost the Bidder anticipates incurring for the performance of that
 Item, together with a proportional share of the Bidder’s anticipated profit, overhead, and costs to perform work for which
 no Item is provided.
 102.09 PROPOSAL BOND
 The Proposal Bond guarantees execution of the Contract by the Bidder receiving Award.
 With the bid submission, the Bidder shall complete the electronic bond form. The Proposal Bond must be satisfactory to
 the Department and for a sum of 50 percent of the total bid amount.
 The Bidder shall ensure that the Proposal Bond is properly completed and furnished by a surety authorized to do
 business in the State as are listed in the current US Treasury Department Circular 570 as of the date for opening of bids
 for the particular Contract and are authorized to issue bonds in at least the amount of the Proposal Bond.
 The Bidder shall ensure that the Proposal Bond has a power of attorney executed by the Surety. The power of attorney
 shall set forth the limits of authority of the attorney-in-fact who has signed the bond on behalf of the Surety to bind the
 company and shall further certify that such power is in full force and effect as of the date of the bond.
 The Department will not accept Proposal Bonds that do not comply in all respects with the provisions of N.J.A.C. 16:445.1(d) and that are not substantiated by a valid power of attorney executed by the Surety.
 102.10 SUBMISSION OF BIDS
 Once the Bidder has completed its bid and made all desired changes, the Bidder shall submit the electronically signed bid
 via the internet using the appropriate software. An authorized representative of the Bidder is required to digitally sign
 
 10
 
 the bid. Information regarding digital signatures is available on the Department’s website. The Department may reject
 internet bids that are not digitally signed by the authorized representative of the Bidder with an approved digital
 signature.
 The Bidder shall ensure delivery of its bid with all required components and attachments, including, but not limited to
 the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 6.
 7.
 
 Schedule of Items.
 Updated Financial Statement (Form DC-74B).
 Proposal Electronic Bidding File with Bidder’s Certification.
 For wholly State funded contracts, acknowledgement of compliance with the registrations specified in 102.01.
 For wholly State funded contracts, acknowledgement of compliance with N.J.S.A. 19:44A-20.13, et seq.
 Proposal Bond form.
 Other related documents as specified in the Contract.
 
 When the Bidder submits bids for 2 or more Contracts that the Department will open on the same day, the Bidder may
 submit a single Updated Financial Statement instead of a separate statement for each Contract.
 The Bidder is solely responsible for any and all errors and for timely submission of the bid, all components thereof, and
 all attachments thereto, through the electronic bidding system; the Department assumes no responsibility for any claim
 arising from the failure of any Bidder or of the electronic delivery system to cause any bid, bid component, or attachment
 to not be delivered to the Department on or before the time set for the opening of bids.
 102.11 WITHDRAWAL OF BIDS
 A Bidder may withdraw a bid after it has been submitted to the Department, provided the request for such withdrawal is
 received by the Department on the Request for Withdrawal of Bids Form, in writing or by fax, before the time set for bid
 opening. The Bidder may obtain the Department’s Request for Withdrawal of Bids Form from the electronic bidding
 website.
 102.12 PUBLIC OPENING OF BIDS
 The Department will open and read bids publicly at the time and place indicated in the advertisement or such other time
 and place as established by addenda. The Department invites Bidders, their authorized agents, and other interested
 parties to be present.
 102.13 CONSIDERATION OF BIDS
 The Department reviews bids for conformity with the Contract and compares bids on the basis of the correctly
 determined summation of the correctly determined products of all the quantities for Items shown in the bid multiplied by
 the unit prices bid together with the sums bid for lump sum Items. The Department will make the total bid amount for
 all bids available.
 102.14 IRREGULAR BIDS
 The Department will consider a bid irregular and will reject it if the Department determines that the bid contains a
 material defect.
 102.15 DISQUALIFICATION OF BIDDERS
 The Department will disqualify a Bidder and reject a bid submitted by that Bidder if the Bidder is determined by the
 Department to lack responsibility. Factors demonstrating a lack of responsibility include, but are not be limited to:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 Evidence of collusion among Bidders.
 Uncompleted work, which in the opinion of the Department, might hinder or prevent completion of additional
 work if awarded.
 Failure to satisfy the pre-award requirements for DBE or ESBE as specified in the Special Provisions for
 Federally funded contracts.
 Failure to satisfy the pre-award requirements for SBE as specified in the Special Provisions for wholly State
 funded contracts.
 
 11
 
 5.
 
 Submission of a materially unbalanced bid. A materially unbalanced bid is a bid where there is a reasonable
 doubt that award to the Bidder submitting a mathematically unbalanced bid, which is structured on the basis
 of nominal prices for some work and inflated prices for other work, will result in the lowest ultimate cost to
 the Department.
 6. Lack of competency or lack of adequate machinery, plant, or other equipment.
 7. Unsatisfactory performance on previous or current contracts.
 8. Questionable moral integrity as determined by the Attorney General of New Jersey or the Department.
 9. Any other outward actions or lack of action that demonstrates the Bidder is not responsible.
 10. Disqualification, suspension, or debarment of an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, or any
 combination as required by N.J.S.A. 16:44-8.1.
 102.16 REJECTION OF ALL BIDS
 The Department has the right to reject all bids when the Department deems it advisable to do so in the best interest of the
 State or public.
 
 SECTION 103 – AWARD AND EXECUTION OF CONTRACT
 103.01 AWARD OF CONTRACT
 The Department will award the Contract to the lowest responsible Bidder whose bid conforms in all respects to the
 requirements set forth in the Contract. The Department will award the Contract based on the Total Contract Price. The
 Department will award the Contract or reject all bids within 30 State Business Days after the bids are received. The
 Department may conditionally award the Contract pending the approval of the Federal Government, another State
 governmental body, or private party. If the Department does not award the Contract or conditionally award the Contract
 within 30 State Business Days, all Bidders have the right to withdraw their bids. However, the Department, with the
 agreement of the lowest responsible Bidder, the second lowest responsible Bidder, or both Bidders, may extend the time
 that the Department may make an Award or Conditional Award by mutual consent.
 At the time of Award or Conditional Award, if the Bidder is not a resident of the State, such Bidder shall appoint, on the
 form provided by the Department, a proper agent located in the State on whom service of process can be made in the
 event of litigation of any type arising under the Contract or as a result of performance of the Contract. Said agency shall
 remain in effect during the performance of the Contract and for 6 years following Acceptance.
 The Award or Conditional Award is not binding upon the Department until the Department has executed the Contract.
 No person shall perform any Work in furtherance of the Contract until notified that the Contract has been executed, and
 then only as specified in 108.02.
 The term “State Business Day” as used in this Subsection is synonymous with the term “Working Day” as used in
 N.J.S.A. 27:7-31 and N.J.S.A. 27:7-33 and is any day exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, State recognized legal holidays,
 and such other holidays or State office closings as declared by the State.
 103.02 CANCELLATION OF AWARD
 The Department reserves the right to cancel an Award or Conditional Award at any time before the execution of said
 Contract by all parties without incurring any liability of any kind.
 103.03 RELEASE OF PROPOSAL BOND
 The Department will release all Proposal Bonds except those of the 2 lowest Bidders within 5 days after opening of bids.
 The Department will release the Proposal Bond of the lowest and next lowest Bidders when the Contract and
 performance bond and payment bond have been executed and delivered as specified in 103.04, or, if not executed, when
 other disposition of the matter has been made by the Department.
 
 12
 
 103.04 EXECUTION OF THE CONTRACT
 Within 14 days of the date of Award or Conditional Award, the Bidder shall properly and duly execute the Contract and
 deliver to the Department the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 6.
 
 If escrowing bid documents, the custody agreement as specified in 103.05.
 Performance bond and payment bond as specified in 151.03.01.
 Request for Authorization Form for the New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System 5G3 –
 Construction Activity Stormwater General Permit (NJG0088323) when required as shown on the Plans.
 Proof of the registrations specified in 102.01 for the Department of Treasury and the Department of Labor.
 For wholly State funded projects, all completed Certification/Disclosure Forms for compliance with N.J.S.A.
 19:44A-20.13, et seq.
 If the case of non-resident Bidders, the completed form regarding “Appointment of Agent” for compliance
 with N.J.S.A. 14A:15-2, et seq.
 
 If the Contract is not executed by the Department within 60 days following receipt from the successful Bidder of the
 signed Contract and the performance bond and payment bond, the successful Bidder may withdraw its bid without
 penalty. Where the Bidder chooses not to withdraw its bid before the Department executes the Contract, the Bidder shall
 be deemed to have waived any claim for additional payment or for an extension of time. The Contract does not become
 effective until it has been fully executed by all parties.
 103.05 ESCROW OF BID DOCUMENTS
 A.
 
 Purpose. The bid documents are the supporting information, calculations, quotes, and other information used to
 prepare the bid. The Department may use the Contractor’s bid documents to negotiate changes and claims if they
 are escrowed and a signed custody agreement is provided. The information contained in the bid documents does
 not modify the terms and conditions of the Contract. If the Contractor fails to escrow bid documents within the
 time specified in 103.04, the Department will not make payment for a disproportionate allocation of costs for work
 for which no Item is provided in the Contract, as specified in 102.08, in the renegotiation of costs of Items when
 there is a major decrease in quantity as specified in 104.03.03.
 
 B.
 
 Stipulations and Acknowledgements. Escrowed bid documents are the property of the Contractor and are not
 public records. If a third party requests a copy of the escrowed bid documents, the Contractor, and not the
 Department, must take the legal steps needed to defend the confidentiality of the escrowed bid.
 
 C.
 
 Form and Contents. The Department will consider escrowed bid documents reliable only if information is
 provided for all Items, and the total cost shown in the bid documents for each Item equals the bid price for the Item.
 The Contractor may submit escrowed bid documents in its usual cost-estimating format. It is not the intent of the
 Department to cause the Contractor to expend additional effort in preparing its bid.
 
 D.
 
 Custody. Escrow bid documents in sealed boxes with a custody agent, and provide a copy of the fully executed
 custody agreement provided by the Department. Include with the custody agreement a certification that the
 escrowed bid documents have not been modified, corrected, or otherwise revised in any manner after the opening
 of bids.
 The Department may access the escrowed bid documents with the Contractor’s written authorization.
 After Acceptance and upon request from the Contractor, the Department will provide a release for the bid
 documents provided that there are no pending claims.
 
 103.06 FAILURE TO EXECUTE CONTRACT
 Failure on the part of the Bidder, to whom the Contract has been awarded, to execute the Contract as specified in 103.04,
 in the manner and within the time specified, is just cause for annulment of the Award or Conditional Award and for the
 exclusion of the Bidder from bidding on subsequent projects for such period as the Department deems appropriate. If the
 Award is annulled, the Proposal Bond, as specified in 102.09, is forfeited, and the Department has the right to recover
 under the terms and provisions of the Proposal Bond. The Department has the right to award the Contract to the next
 lowest responsible Bidder, or to readvertise and construct the Work under the Contract, or otherwise, as the Department
 decides in its sole discretion.
 
 13
 
 The successful Bidder may file with the Department a written notice, signed by the Bidder or the Bidder’s authorized
 representative, stating that the Bidder refuses to execute the Contract. The filing of such notice has the same force and
 effect as the failure of the Bidder to execute the Contract and furnish a performance bond and payment bond within the
 time specified in 103.04.
 103.07 ACQUISITION OF DOCUMENTS
 After the Award, additional sets of the Plans or additional copies of the Special Provisions are available to subscribers
 through the Department’s website or upon request to the Department’s Engineering Documents Unit, at a charge
 according to the Department rate.
 
 SECTION 104 – SCOPE OF WORK
 104.01 INTENT
 The intent of the Contract is for the Contractor to construct the Work to be functionally complete and aesthetically
 acceptable. Perform work that may be reasonably inferred from the Contract as being required to produce the intended
 result under the Items of the Contract. Perform the Work using the best construction practices and provide materials and
 workmanship of the first quality to meet the Contract requirements.
 Perform the Work to ensure the least possible obstruction to traffic, while adhering to the highest safety standards, and
 with the least inconvenience to local residents and the general public.
 104.02 VALUE ENGINEERING
 104.02.01 Purpose and Scope
 The intent of value engineering (VE) is to promote Contractor innovation, for which the Department will share with the
 Contractor 50 percent of the value of cost savings generated as a result of a Department approved VE proposal.
 The Department will only consider VE proposals that produce a cost savings to the Department without, in the sole
 judgment of the Department, impairing essential functions or characteristics of the Project. Essential functions that
 cannot be adversely impacted include, but are not limited to, safety, service life, economy of operation, ease of
 maintenance, environmental compliance, and desired appearance. The Department will not consider VE proposals that
 change the Project’s original design criteria; merely eliminate work; are based on an unknown factor; do not show a cost
 savings; or extend Contract Time.
 104.02.02 Conditions
 The Department will consider VE proposals only after Award of the Contract and only in accordance with the following
 terms and conditions:
 1.
 2.
 
 3.
 
 In the event that the Department rejects a VE proposal during any step of the process, the Contractor is
 required to complete the Work as specified in the Contract. The Contractor recognizes that the Department
 has the right to reject VE proposals and cannot base its bid on the anticipated approval of a VE proposal.
 All VE proposals, approved or not approved by the Department for use in the Contract, apply only to the
 ongoing Contract or Contracts referenced in the VE proposal. The VE proposals shall become the property of
 the Department and shall contain no restrictions imposed by the Contractor on their use or disclosure. The
 Department will have the right to use, duplicate, and disclose in whole or in part any data necessary to use the
 VE proposal. The Department retains the right to use any accepted VE proposal or part thereof on any other
 or subsequent project without any obligation to the Contractor. This provision is not intended to deny rights
 provided by law with respect to patented materials or processes.
 If the Department already has under consideration certain revisions to the Contract that are subsequently
 incorporated in a VE proposal, the Department will reject the Contractor’s VE proposal and has the right to
 proceed with such revisions without obligation to the Contractor.

 The RE will determine whether a VE proposal qualifies for consideration and evaluation by the Department,
 including whether the savings generated by the VE proposal are sufficient to warrant review and processing.
 The Department may still reject a final VE proposal after approval of the initial VE proposal.
 The RE has the right to reject all or any portion of work performed according to an approved VE proposal if
 the RE determines that results do not meet the requirements of the VE proposal or the Contract. The RE has
 the right to direct the removal of such rejected work and require the Contractor to proceed according to the
 original Contract. If the Contractor is directed to proceed according to the original Contract, the Department
 will not make payment for the rejected work performed under the VE proposal, or for its removal. The
 Contractor is responsible for the consequential costs arising from the rejected work to complete the work as
 proposed under the original Contract, including the cost to Others.
 The Contractor may only submit VE proposals based on Items scheduled to be performed by the Contractor.
 The Department will not consider anticipated cost savings based on revisions to utility relocations or other
 work to be performed by Others. The Contractor is responsible to obtain the concurrence of Utilities, property
 owners, governing bodies, and agencies for any work affected by the VE proposal. The Department has the
 right to reject VE proposals that may increase the time or cost of work done by Others.
 In calculating the value of cost savings, the Department has the right to disregard the Contract bid prices, if
 such prices do not represent the value of the work to be performed or to be deleted, and has the right to
 calculate the savings based on reasonable costs for such work.
 Ensure that VE proposals are designed according to the Department design manuals and other Department
 standards for the proposed work.
 If additional information is needed to evaluate VE proposals, provide this information in the Department
 specified time period, otherwise the Department will reject the VE proposal. Additional information may
 include, where design changes are proposed, results of field investigations and surveys, design computations,
 and field change sheets.
 The Department will not deduct the Department’s costs for review and processing of the VE proposal from
 the cost savings.
 The Department will not make payment for the Contractor’s costs for development and submission of the VE
 proposal. The Contractor waives its right to claim for costs or delays incurred due to the Department’s review
 or rejection of a VE proposal. These costs include, but are not limited to, development costs, loss of
 anticipated profits, or increased material or labor costs resulting from delays in the review of such VE
 proposal.
 The Department will not use the value of cost savings for: additional vehicle operating and delay costs
 incurred by the traveling public, compared to normal operating conditions, resulting from the establishment of
 construction, maintenance, or rehabilitation work zones (road user costs), or for costs to oversee the Project
 (construction engineering costs).
 The Contractor may submit VE proposals for an approved Subcontractor, provided that payment is made by
 the Department to the Contractor and that the terms of the payment to the Subcontractor are satisfactorily
 negotiated and accepted before the proposal is submitted to the Department. Submit revised agreements as
 specified in 108.01.1. Subcontractors may only submit a VE proposal through the Contractor.
 
 104.02.03 Submittals
 The Contractor may submit VE proposals electronically.
 attachments and a printed copy.
 
 With electronic submissions, submit the appropriate
 
 If the initial VE proposal is only submitted in printed form, provide at least 3 sets of documents. If the final VE proposal
 is only submitted in printed form, the Department will designate the required number of sets of documents.
 Submit initial and final VE proposals as follows:
 1.
 
 Initial VE Proposal. Submit to the RE an initial VE proposal outlining the general technical concepts
 associated with the VE proposal and the estimated savings that will result.
 The Department will review the initial VE proposal and, if found to be conceptually acceptable, will grant
 approval to submit a final VE proposal. A finding of conceptual acceptability of the initial proposal in no way
 obligates the Department to approve the final VE proposal.
 
 15
 
 2.
 
 Final VE Proposal. The Department will consider a final VE proposal only after the approval of the initial
 VE proposal. With each final VE proposal, submit, at a minimum, to the RE the following information:
 1.
 2.
 
 3.
 4.
 5.
 6.
 7.
 8.
 
 9.
 
 A statement that the final VE proposal is submitted as a VE proposal with a reference to the
 approval of the initial VE proposal.
 A description of the differences between the existing Contract requirements and the proposed
 change, and the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each. Document the effects on
 safety, service life, economy of operations, ease of maintenance, environmental requirements, and
 desired appearance.
 Complete plans, specifications, and calculations showing the proposed changes relative to the
 original Contract features and requirements. Ensure that plans and engineering calculations are
 signed and sealed by a Professional Engineer.
 A complete cost analysis indicating the final estimated costs and quantities to be replaced by the
 VE proposal, the new costs and quantities generated by the final VE proposal, and the cost effects
 of the proposed changes on operational, maintenance, and other considerations.
 An evaluation of the effect the final VE proposal has on Contract Time, including a revised
 schedule and a time impact evaluation as specified in 108.11.01.C.
 A description of any previous use or testing of the final VE proposal on another Department project
 or elsewhere and the conditions and results. If the final VE proposal was previously submitted on
 another Department project, indicate the date, the project, and the action taken by the Department.
 A letter of concurrence to the VE proposal from Others that are affected.
 The specific date that the Change Order adopting the final VE proposal must be executed to obtain
 the maximum cost reduction. Ensure that this date allows the Department ample time, usually a
 minimum of 60 days, for review and processing a Change Order. If the Department finds that there
 is insufficient time available for review and processing, it has the right to reject the final VE
 proposal solely on such basis. If the Department fails to respond to the final VE proposal by the
 date specified, the Contractor shall consider the final VE proposal rejected and shall make no claim
 against the Department as a result thereof.
 Additional information requested by the Department.
 
 104.02.04 Final Documents
 If the final VE proposal is approved, submit working drawings for approval. The Department will designate the number
 of sets to be submitted.
 104.02.05 Payment
 If the VE proposal is approved, the Department will issue a Change Order incorporating the VE proposal and
 establishing payment for the cost savings.
 The Department will make payment to the Contractor for 50 percent of the cost savings from the VE proposal. It is
 understood that the payment includes all costs resulting as a consequence of the change, including but not limited to
 quantity increases to Items, and unanticipated work or expenses arising out of the change.
 104.03 CHANGES TO THE CONTRACT
 104.03.01 Authority to Make Changes
 The Department has the right to make changes to the Work at any time, including altering the Contract, altering the
 requirements of an Item, increasing or decreasing the quantities of any Item, or deleting any Item. Such changes neither
 invalidate the Contract, nor release the Surety. The Contractor agrees to perform the Work as changed.
 The Contractor may request changes to the Contract.
 The Department will direct changes using a written Field Order or Change Order as follows:
 1.
 
 Field Orders. The RE has the right to unilaterally direct Contractor performance with a written Field Order.
 Upon receipt of a Field Order, proceed as directed by the Field Order. A Field Order will state whether the
 
 16
 
 directions provided by the Field Order are eligible for payment or modification of Contract Time. The
 Department will provide such payment or modification to Contract Time in a subsequent Change Order.
 2.
 
 Change Orders. The Department will modify the Contract with a Change Order.
 The Department has the right to unilaterally make the following changes: make minor increases or decreases
 in quantity; modify Contract Time as specified in 108.11; direct New Work to be performed on a force
 account basis; and establish payment modifications for damages, credits, bonuses, and penalties provided for
 in the Contract.
 For changes that require the Contractor’s assent, the RE will negotiate the terms of the change and the
 Department will offer a Change Order. If the Contractor accepts the offer, the Contractor will sign the
 Change Order, whereupon the Department may approve and issue the Change Order. By signing a Change
 Order, the Contractor agrees that the Change Order constitutes the full extent of the agreement between the
 Department and the Contractor, including the full extent of payment and modified Contract Time for the work
 and for any effects upon all and any part of the Work, and supersedes any prior written or oral agreement
 between the parties. Additionally, the Contractor acknowledges the sufficiency and propriety of the
 consideration for the work detailed in the Change Order, and understands that the agreement is binding.
 Upon receipt of an approved Change Order, proceed as directed by the Change Order.
 
 Do not deviate from the requirements of the Contract unless and until a Field Order is issued by the RE or a Change
 Order is approved by the Department.
 Notwithstanding the issuance of a Field Order or Change Order, do not expend or cause to be expended any sum in
 excess of the Contract’s current authorized funding amount. The Department will notify the Contractor when the
 authorized funding amount for the Contract has been modified. Any expenditure by the Contractor that exceeds the
 Contract’s authorized funding amount is at the Contractor’s risk and the Contractor waives any right to recover from the
 Department any sum in excess of the amount appropriated.
 104.03.02 Protests to Change Orders
 If the Contractor disagrees with any terms or conditions set forth in a Change Order, submit a written protest to the
 Department within 15 days after the date of receipt of the Change Order.
 A protest is notice that the terms and conditions for proposed work are not in accordance with the Contract, quantity
 adjustments are incorrect, or that the modification for Contract Time is incorrect. A protest is not a substitute for notice
 as specified in 104.03.04. Providing a protest within 15 days after the date of the receipt of a Change Order may not
 meet the requirements of 104.03.04 or N.J.S.A 59:13-5 and the Department will not make payment for the costs of a
 claim if recovery is barred by other provisions in the Contract.
 In the protest, list the points of disagreement, and, if possible, the specification references, quantities, and costs involved.
 Ensure that the protest is a specific, detailed statement of the points of disagreement. The Department will reject general
 protests. If the Department rejects a protest for being a general protest, provide a specific, detailed statement within 7
 days of such rejection.
 If an acceptable written protest is not submitted within 15 days after the date of receipt of the Change Order or within 7
 days of the initial rejection, the Department will make payment and modify Contract Time as set forth in the Change
 Order. Such payment is full payment for all work included or required by the Change Order and is conclusive as to any
 Contract Time modifications provided for therein or in establishing that no Contract Time modification was warranted.
 For Change Orders that require the Contractor’s assent, if the Department processes the Change Order within 15 days of
 receiving the Contractor’s signature, the Contractor is barred from protesting the approved Change Order.
 Protest does not relieve the Contractor from the obligation to proceed with work directed by an approved Change Order.
 104.03.03 Types of Changes
 The Department will address all changes under one or a combination of the following types:
 1.
 
 Quantity Increases and Decreases. The Department has the right to increase or decrease the quantities of
 work to be performed. If the quantity of an Item is cumulatively increased or decreased by 25 percent or less
 
 17
 
 from the Proposal quantity, the Department will consider the quantity adjustment to be a minor change in
 quantity. If the quantity of an Item is cumulatively increased or decreased by more than 25 percent from the
 Proposal quantity, the Department will consider the quantity adjustment a major change in quantity. For the
 purpose of this subsection, the term “Proposal quantity” is the quantity indicated in the Proposal less the
 quantities designated on the Plans as “if and where directed.”
 For minor changes in quantity, the Department will make payment for the quantity of the Item performed at
 the bid price for the Item.
 For major increases in quantity, the Department or the Contractor may request to renegotiate the price for the
 quantity in excess of 125 percent of the Proposal quantity. For Items that are measured by Unit, the
 Department will not renegotiate a price for a fraction of a Unit, rather a Unit is eligible for renegotiation if it
 causes the quantity to be in excess of 125 percent of the Proposal quantity. If a mutual agreement cannot be
 reached on a renegotiated price, the Department will make payment by force account as specified in
 104.03.08.
 For major decreases in quantity, the Department or the Contractor may request to renegotiate the price for the
 quantity of work performed. If a mutual agreement cannot be reached on a renegotiated price, the Department
 will make payment by force account as specified in 104.03.08. However, the Department will not make
 payment in an amount that exceeds 75 percent of the value of the bid price multiplied by the Proposal
 quantity.
 The Department will consider making payment for costs attributed to a disproportionate allocation of costs for
 work for which no Item is provided in the Contract if the Contractor has escrowed its bid documents as
 specified in 103.05. The Department will not make payment for lost anticipated profits.
 If the cost (C) is less than $5000, the Department will not make a modification, and will make payment for the
 quantity of the Item performed at the bid price. Calculate C as follows:
 C = Q × (PB – PR)
 Where:
 C = Cost.
 PB = Bid price.
 PR = Renegotiated price.
 Q = Quantity of work performed at the renegotiated price.
 
 If a change results in a major change in quantity and results in a renegotiated price for the quantity in excess
 of 125 percent from the Proposal quantity, the RE will determine the locations of which work is to be
 performed at the renegotiated price and which locations of work is performed at the bid price. For subsequent
 increases in quantities, perform the work at the renegotiated price. However, if the quantities of subsequent
 increases exceed 25 percent of the Proposal quantity and 25 percent of the adjusted quantity for the Item at the
 renegotiated price, either party may request to re-renegotiate the price for the excess quantity. When the
 locations of the work to be performed at a renegotiated price are established, subsequent decreases in
 quantities of work at the bid price will not affect the quantity of work at the renegotiated price.
 Deleted work is work deleted from the Contract by decreasing the quantity of an Item, except the provisions
 for deleted work do not apply to quantities designated as “if and where directed.”
 If the Department deletes work from the Contract, immediately cancel orders for materials for that Item. If
 the Contractor has ordered acceptable material for work deleted from the Contract before the date the RE
 notified the Contractor that the work was deleted and the material cannot be returned to the vendor, the
 Department will make payment based on the cost of the material, as evidenced by paid invoices. In that event,
 the Department becomes the owner of the material, and the Contractor will deliver the material to a location
 as directed by the RE. The Department will only make payment for material that meets the requirements of
 the Contract.
 If the Contractor has ordered acceptable material for work deleted from the Contract before the date the RE
 notified the Contractor that the work was deleted, the material is returnable to the vendor, and the RE directs
 the material be returned, the Contractor shall return the material. The Department will make payment for
 actual vendor charges for returning and restocking the material.

 For deleted work, the Department will make payment for material costs and vendor restocking charges as
 specified in 104.03.08; except that the Department will not apply profit, and the total payment may not exceed
 the bid price multiplied by the deleted quantity. If the Department directs the material to be delivered to a
 designated location, the Department will make payment for the associated handling and delivery costs. If a
 price for these handling and delivery costs cannot be agreed upon, the Department will make payment by
 force account as specified in 104.03.08.
 When the entire quantity of an Item is designated “if and where directed,” and is increased by more than 100
 percent of the Proposal quantity, the Department or the Contractor may request to renegotiate payment for the
 quantity in excess of 200 percent of the Proposal quantity. If a mutual agreement for a renegotiated price
 cannot be achieved, the Department will make payment by force account as specified in 104.03.08.
 When the entire quantity of an Item is designated “if and where directed,” and is decreased by any amount,
 the Department will make payment for work performed at the rate of the bid price. When the entire quantity
 of an Item is designated “if and where directed,” and is deleted, the Department will not make a modification,
 and will not make payment for the quantity of the Item performed at the bid price.
 2.
 
 New Work. When requested by the RE, submit to the RE a detailed cost proposal for performance of New
 Work. If a price for a New Work cannot be mutually agreed upon, the Department will make payment by
 force account as specified in 104.03.08.
 
 3.
 
 Changes in the Character of Work. A change in the character of work is a change that causes the work to
 substantially differ in kind or nature from the original proposed construction. The Department may make
 payment for a change in the character of work whether the change directly causes a change in the character of
 the work or causes other work to become significantly different in character. Efficiencies or inefficiencies
 resulting from minor increases or decreases in quantities of work are not a change in the character of work. If
 a change in the character of the work results in a decreased cost to perform the work, the RE will revise the
 price to reflect this reduced cost.
 For changes in the character of work, the Department will base the modification on the difference between
 what the actual cost to perform the work of the Item or portion thereof involved would have been if there were
 no change, and the actual cost of performing the work or portion of work as changed. The modification shall
 only apply to the portion of the work for an Item actually affected by the change.
 If a modification cannot be reached by agreement, the Department will make payment by force account as
 specified in 104.03.08.
 Specific changes in character of work have the following requirements:
 a.
 
 Differing Site Condition. A condition is considered to be a Type 1 Differing Site Condition when a
 subsurface or latent physical condition at the site differs materially from those specified in the Contract.
 A condition is considered to be a Type 2 Differing Site Condition when unusual conditions are
 encountered that differ materially from those ordinarily encountered or is generally recognized as
 inherent in the work that could not have been reasonably anticipated from the pre-bid examination as
 specified in 102.04 or from the preparation of the bid as specified in 102.07.
 The Department will make payment for increased costs resulting from a Type 1 or Type 2 Differing Site
 Condition as a change in the character of work; however, the Department will not consider payment for a
 differing site condition unless the resulting change in cost exceeds the amounts as specified in Table
 104.03.03-1. If the change in cost exceeds these amounts, the Department will base the modification on
 the total cost of the change. The Department will not deduct the amounts shown in Table 104.03.03-1
 from the cost of the change. If the same differing site condition is encountered subsequently, the
 Department will consider the cumulative total value towards meeting the requirements of Table
 104.03.03-1.
 Table 104.03.03-1

 Up to $2,000,000
 Over $2,000,000
 
 $5000
 $25,000
 
 19
 
 b.
 
 Constructive Acceleration. The Department will make payment for costs resulting from constructive
 acceleration as a change in the character of work if there was an excusable compensable delay for which
 the Department improperly rejected the Contractor’s notice requesting an extension of Contract Time,
 and for which the Contractor incurred additional costs. Payment for constructive acceleration may not
 exceed the cost of liquidated damages saved by the actions of constructive acceleration. The Department
 will not make payment for claims for constructive acceleration if the Contractor fails to have an
 approved progress schedule as specified in 153.03.
 Before constructively accelerating, provide the RE with a plan detailing the methods and activities of the
 constructive acceleration. Include how the plan accelerates the Work relative to the current approved
 progress schedule. Do not deviate from the submitted plan without providing the RE with a revised
 plan.
 
 c.
 
 Inefficiencies. If the source of the loss of productivity cannot be isolated and priced separately, the
 Department will consider making payment for inefficiency costs based on a Measured Mile analysis
 comparing the productivity of work impacted by a change to the productivity of similar work under
 unimpacted conditions.
 If the source of the inefficiency is working out of the scheduled sequence, use the current approved
 progress schedule to show that the work was performed out-of-sequence.
 
 d.
 
 Delays. The Department will modify Contract Time as specified in 108.11. The Department will make
 payment for delay damages resulting from excusable, compensable delays as specified in 104.03.09.
 
 104.03.04 Contractual Notice
 It is the responsibility of all parties to promptly provide written notice to the other party when circumstances are believed
 to constitute a change to the Contract.
 Immediately provide written notice to the RE of any circumstances that are believed to be a change to the Contract. If
 notice is not provided on Contractual Notice (Form DC-161), include the following in the initial written notice:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 
 A statement that this is a notice of a change.
 The date when the circumstances believed to be a change were discovered.
 A detailed and specific statement describing the nature and circumstances of the change.
 If the change will or could affect costs to the Department.
 If the change will or could affect Contract Time as specified in 108.11.01.C.
 
 The Department will not modify the Contract for work performed or for expenses incurred due to a change before the
 date notification is provided to the RE. The Contractor waives its right to file a claim for costs incurred before providing
 notice to the RE.
 Following submission of written notice, diligently continue with the unaffected work to the maximum extent possible. If
 a Type 1 or Type 2 Differing Site Condition is encountered, do not disturb the existing site condition until directed by
 the RE.
 Within 5 days after receipt of each written notice, the RE will respond in writing with one of the following:
 1.
 
 2.
 3.
 
 4.
 
 Reject the notice for providing insufficient information. The Department will not accept general notices. The
 RE may request resubmission of the notice with additional information. If the Department rejects the written
 notice for insufficient information, the Department will deem the Contractor to have not provided notice even
 if the RE issues directions based on the information provided.
 Reject the notice because the Contractor failed to submit the notice within the specified time frames of
 N.J.S.A 59:13-5, or 104.03.02.
 Acknowledge that notice has been provided, and state that the Department has not determined whether the
 circumstances constitute a change that may be eligible for additional payment or time or both. If necessary,
 the RE may direct the mode of further performance. The RE may require the Contractor to submit additional
 information within a specified time period.
 Acknowledge that notice has been provided, and confirm that the circumstances constitute a change that may
 be eligible for additional payment or time or both. If necessary, the RE may direct the mode of further
 
 20
 
 performance. The RE may require the Contractor to submit additional information within a specified time
 period.
 104.03.05 Unrecoverable Costs

 expenses, consultant’s fees and expenses, and litigation expenses.
 Interest.
 Reimbursement for home office overhead in excess of that provided by the Contract.
 
 104.03.06 Unacceptable Cost Calculation Methods
 The Contractor has the burden of substantially proving entitlement to and quantifying its costs. The Department will not
 make payment for costs calculated using the following methods:
 1
 
 Total Cost Method. Method based on calculating costs as the difference between the Contractor’s bid for the
 Work from the Contractor’s calculation of costs for the Work.
 
 2.
 
 Modified Total Cost Method. Method based on calculating damages as the difference between the
 Contractor’s bid for a portion of the Work and the Contractor’s calculation of cost for that portion of the
 Work.
 
 3.
 
 Productivity Factors. Costs for inefficiency based on industry productivity factors such as those provided by
 the Mechanical Contractors Association of America (MCAA) Factors Affecting Labor Productivity.
 
 4.
 
 Eichleay Formula. Eichleay and other formulas or approaches to calculating home office overhead costs due
 to delay other than as specified in 104.03.08.
 
 104.03.07 Tracking Costs
 For all work directed to be paid for by force account, and for all costs for which the Contractor will pursue
 reimbursement through a claim, track and maintain complete records to provide a clear distinction between the costs for
 that work and the costs of other operations. On a daily basis, submit for review by the RE a daily work report for the
 work involved in the force account or claim, signed by the Contractor’s authorized representative. For days with
 multiple shifts of work, submit a separate report at the completion of each shift. Provide the following in the daily or
 shift work report:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 For labor, provide the name, classification, date, daily hours, and whether the hours are straight time or
 overtime for each worker and foreperson.
 For equipment, provide the description, dates, daily hours worked, daily hours idle, and whether each unit of
 equipment or component thereof is rented or Contractor-owned.
 For materials, provide the description, quantities delivered and placed, and whether the materials were for
 temporary use or permanent construction.
 Indicate the description of work associated with the force account or claim performed for that day or shift.
 
 If there are separate instances of work being tracked, provide separate daily or shift reports for each instance.
 Submit in writing to the RE for review before using special equipment, materials, or labor. The Department will not
 make payment for costs that the Contractor fails to document as required in the daily work report.
 104.03.08 Force Account
 Payment made for the work directed to be performed by force account represents full payment for that work. Upon
 request, submit to the RE a detailed cost estimate of the work to be paid by force account using the electronic format
 provided by the Department. Submit daily or shift reports for force account costs as specified in 104.03.07. For work
 directed to be paid for by force account, and when approved by the RE in the daily or shift reports, the Department will
 make payment for the following:
 
 21
 
 1.
 
 Direct Labor. The Department will make payment for all necessary direct labor and the supervising
 foreperson of the specific operation, whether the employer is the Contractor, or subcontractor, based on the
 gross rate of wage paid to the employee as shown in its certified payrolls for each and every hour that said
 labor and foreperson are actively engaged in such work.
 For specific extraordinary operations, the Department may allow supervising or other special types of
 employees, which would usually be considered as overhead, to be considered direct labor, but only for that
 time allowed by the RE. Submit justification in writing for the RE’s approval before using such employees.
 
 2.
 
 Labor Fringe Benefits. The Department will make payment for the cost of benefits paid by the Contractor
 on direct labor costs allowed under 104.03.08.1, to or on behalf of, workers when required by collective
 bargaining agreements or other employment contracts generally applicable to the classes of labor employed on
 the work.
 
 3.
 
 Indirect Labor Costs. The Department will make payment for the cost of FICA, Workers Compensation
 Insurance, Federal and State unemployment insurance and other payroll taxes paid by the Contractor on direct
 labor costs allowed under 104.03.08.1.

 Insurance. The Department will make payment for the actual increased cost of insurance, necessarily and
 directly resulting from the force account work, as evidenced by certified documentation of insurance rates and
 premiums.
 
 5.
 
 Materials. The Department will make payment for the cost of materials and shipping charges as evidenced
 by paid invoices, except as follows:
 1.
 2.
 
 3.
 
 4.
 
 If a cash or trade discount is offered by the actual supplier or available to the purchaser, credit the
 Department notwithstanding the fact that such discount may not have been taken.
 If materials are procured by the purchaser by any method that is not a direct purchase from and a
 direct billing by the actual supplier to such purchaser, the cost of such materials is the price paid to
 the actual supplier as determined by the RE, plus the costs, if any, incurred in the handling of such
 materials.
 If in the opinion of the RE the cost of such materials is excessive, then the Department will limit
 the cost of such materials to the prevailing market price for such materials as are available in the
 quantities concerned, delivered to the Project Limits, and deducting any discounts as specified in
 104.03.08.5.1.
 For materials not incorporated into the permanent construction, the Department will deduct the
 reasonable salvage value of the material after the performance of the work.
 
 The Department will only allow sales tax on materials that are not permanent and do not qualify for an
 exemption under the Sales and Use Tax Act.
 The Department reserves the right to furnish materials, and the Department will not make payment for costs
 and markup on such materials.
 6.
 
 Extraordinary Expenses. The Department will make payment for permit and disposal fees, if approved
 before incurring the cost and evidenced by paid invoices. If the cost is, in the opinion of the RE, excessive,
 then the Department will limit the payment for such expenses to reasonable costs as available in the prevailing
 market.
 
 7.
 
 Equipment. The Department will make payment for Contractor-owned or rented equipment required for the
 force account work. The Department will not provide payment for equipment that is determined to be
 unsuitable by the RE for the force account work or that is inoperable due to breakdown or during periods of
 repair. In the event the Contractor proposes to use equipment of a higher cost than that suitable for the work,
 the Department will make payment at the rate applicable to the suitable equipment. The Department will
 make payment for Contractor-owned or rented equipment as follows:
 a.
 
 Contractor-Owned Equipment. For equipment owned directly by the Contractor or by entities that are
 divisions, affiliates, subsidiaries, or in any other way related to the Contractor or its parent company,
 submit in writing to the RE for approval the type of equipment and proposed cost before starting the
 work. The Department will make payment for equipment rental, operating, and idle time costs based on
 
 22
 
 the calculated cost. The Department will determine the calculated cost using the Rental Rate Blue Book
 (Blue Book), published by Equipment Watch, as follows:
 1.
 
 2.
 3.
 
 4.
 5.
 
 The Department will calculate the “rental” hourly rates by dividing the monthly rate by 220.
 The Department will not use weekly, daily, or hourly rates. The Department will apply rental
 hourly rates for every hour the equipment is in active use, except that for any 30-day period,
 the Department will limit the total amount paid for each piece of equipment to a maximum of
 80 percent of the monthly rate.
 The Department will apply the operating cost rate for every hour the equipment is active.
 The Department will apply the rental and operating rates that are current on the first day that
 the equipment is in use for the force account work throughout the next 6 months that the force
 account is in progress. The Department will apply updated rates for every following 6 month
 period the force account is in progress. Submit to the RE documentation establishing the Blue
 Book rates for the equipment proposed and the age of the equipment. The Department will
 adjust rates for each 6-month period thereafter.
 The Department will not permit area adjustments. The Department will adjust rental rates for
 equipment age adjustments according to the rate adjustment tables.
 The Department will not make payment for idle time for equipment required for only portions
 of the force account work, except where the equipment has been held on the work site on a
 standby basis at the request of the RE and, but for this request, would have left the work site.
 Portions of the work include hours when the equipment is inactive within a working day. For
 the idle time for each piece of equipment, the Department will make payment at one-half the
 rate established as specified in 104.03.08.7.a.1. Idle time is limited to the Contractor’s normal
 working hours. Idle time is further limited to a maximum of eight hours a day and a
 maximum of 176 hours in a 30-day period.
 
 The payment established is full payment for all equipment costs, including the cost of fuel, oil,
 lubrication, supplies, attachments, repairs and maintenance of any kind, depreciation, storage, and all
 incidentals. Furthermore, the payment established above is also full payment for all costs (including
 labor and equipment) for transporting equipment to, on, and away from the work site.
 If a rate is not established in the Blue Book for a particular piece of equipment, the RE will establish a
 rate for that piece of equipment that is consistent with its cost and use in the industry.
 b.
 
 8.
 
 Rented Equipment. In the event that the Contractor does not own a specific type of equipment and
 must obtain it by rental, submit in writing to the RE for approval the need to rent the equipment and the
 rental rate for that equipment before using it on the work. The Department will make payment for the
 rental of the equipment as specified in the rental agreements and as evidenced by paid invoices for the
 time that the equipment is used to accomplish the work, plus the cost of moving the equipment to, on,
 and away from the work site.
 
 Profit. The Department will make payment for profit at the rate of 10 percent applied on the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 9.
 
 Total direct labor cost as specified in 104.03.08.1.
 Total labor fringe benefit costs as specified in 104.03.08.2.
 Total material cost as specified in 104.03.08.5 excluding transportation, shipping, handling, and
 taxes.
 
 Overhead. The Department will make payment for overhead at the rate of 15 percent applied on the
 following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 Total direct labor cost as specified in 104.03.08.1, except for the direct labor cost of any
 extraordinary supervisory or special employees.
 Total labor fringe benefit costs as specified in 104.03.08.2.
 Total material cost as specified in 104.03.08.5 excluding transportation, shipping, handling, and
 taxes.
 
 23
 
 The above 15 percent allowance is full compensation for the Contractor’s field and home office overhead
 including, but not limited to, the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 Salaries and expenses of executive officers, supervising officers, or supervising employees, except
 as provided for specific extraordinary operations under 104.03.08.1.
 Salaries and expenses of clerical and administrative employees.
 Charges for minor equipment, such as small tools, including shovels, picks, axes, saws, bars,
 sledges, lanterns, jacks, cables, pails, wrenches, and other miscellaneous supplies and services; and

 Costs for preparing documents and records, including reproduction and mailing costs.
 
 10. Subcontractors. The Department will make payment for work performed by subcontractors in the same
 manner as for the Contractor as specified in 104.03.08.
 The Department will make payment for markup on subcontracted work at the rate of 5 percent applied on the
 total amount of all costs for subcontracted force account work. The markup on subcontracted work may not
 exceed $5000.
 104.03.09 Delay Damages
 If the Department grants an extension of Contract Time for excusable, compensable delays, as specified in 108.11.01,
 beyond the completion time requirements specified in 108.10, the Department will make payment for the following:
 1.
 
 Non-Productive Activity. The Department will make payment for the following non-productive activities:
 a.
 
 Direct Labor. For all necessary non-productive labor and supervising forepersons of specific operations
 who must remain on the Project during such periods of delay due to collective bargaining contracts or
 other reasons approved by the RE and cannot be assigned to other work not affected, the Department
 will make payment at the prevailing rate of wage as shown in its certified payrolls. This includes the
 necessary labor required for maintenance within the Project Limits, maintenance of traffic control
 devices, maintenance of SESC measures, and similar activities resulting from the delay and approved by
 the RE. This rate is inclusive of all employee contributions to taxes, insurance, and other benefits.
 
 b.
 
 Labor Fringe Benefits. The Department will make payment for the costs for benefits paid by the
 Contractor on direct labor costs allowed under 104.03.09.1.a to or on behalf of, workers when required
 by collective bargaining agreements or other employment contracts generally applicable to the classes of
 labor employed on the work.
 
 c.
 
 Indirect Labor. The Department will make payment for the costs for FICA, Workers Compensation
 Insurance, Federal and State Unemployment Insurance and other payroll taxes paid by the Contractor on
 direct labor costs allowed under 104.03.09.1.a.
 
 d.
 
 Insurance. The Department will make payment for the actual increased cost for insurance, necessarily
 and directly resulting from the delay, as evidenced by certified insurance rates and premiums.
 
 e.
 
 Equipment. If as the result of the delay, equipment cannot be used for any active work, and is directed
 by the RE to remain on the work site during the delay, the Department will make payment as specified in
 104.03.08.7.a.6. If as the result of the delay, equipment cannot be used for any active work, and the RE
 determines that it is not necessary for the equipment to remain on the work site, the Department will
 make payment for labor and equipment costs to remove the equipment and to return it to the work site at
 the end of the delay period.
 If equipment is required for additional maintenance within the Project Limits, maintenance of traffic
 control devices, maintenance of SESC measures, and similar activities resulting from the delay and
 approved by the RE, the Department will make payment as specified in 104.03.08.7.
 
 f.
 
 Contractor’s Field Office. If the Contractor has a field office dedicated for the Project, and if the
 extension of time is for more than one month, the Department will make payment for the costs to
 maintain the Contractor’s field office, as evidenced by paid invoices. These costs may include property
 rent or leases, trailer rentals, utility and sanitation services, and fixed monthly telephone services
 required for a field office directly established for the Project.
 
 24
 
 2.
 
 g.
 
 Profit. The Department will not make payment for profit.
 
 h.
 
 Overhead. The Department will make payment for overhead at a rate of 15 percent of the sum of labor
 and labor fringe benefits. This is full payment for all field and home office overhead and general
 superintendence.
 
 Labor Escalation. If, as the result of the delay, an activity, which had a planned late-finish date occurring
 before a labor rate increase date, is required to start after the labor rate increase date, the Department will
 make payment for the following:
 a.
 
 Increased Direct Labor. For all necessary non-salaried labor and supervising forepersons of the
 specific activity, the Department will make payment for the difference between the gross rate of wage
 paid to the employee as shown in its certified payrolls and the gross rate of wage for the planned period
 of performance, for each and every hour that the employee was actively engaged in such work.
 
 b.
 
 Increased Labor Fringe Benefits. The Department will make payment for the increased costs for
 benefits paid by the Contractor on direct labor costs allowed in 104.03.09.2.a, to, or on behalf of,
 workers when required by collective bargaining agreements or other employment contracts generally
 applicable to the classes of labor employed on the work.
 
 c.
 
 Increased Indirect Labor Costs. The Department will make payment for the costs for FICA, Workers
 Compensation Insurance, Federal and State Unemployment Insurance, and other payroll taxes paid by
 the Contractor on increased direct labor costs allowed under 104.03.09.2.a.
 
 d.
 
 Profit. The Department will make payment for profit at the rate of 10 percent applied on the following:
 1.
 2.
 
 e.
 
 Overhead. The Department will not make payment for overhead for labor escalation costs. Provide the
 RE with the following documentation for all labor escalation costs:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 3.
 
 Total direct labor cost as specified in 104.03.09.2.a.
 Total labor fringe benefit costs as specified in 104.03.09.2.b.
 
 A breakdown of costs by Item, activity, and date detailing the labor classification and hours
 for each.
 For each activity, an analysis demonstrating that the entire activity was forced to be
 performed when labor costs were higher than the labor rates in effect on the planned latefinish date.
 Collective bargaining agreement information detailing the increase in direct wages and fringe
 benefits.
 
 Material Escalation and Storage. If the delay forces the Contractor to purchase material when material
 costs are higher than the cost of material would have been for the planned late-finish dates of an activity using
 the material, or if the Contractor incurs additional storage costs as a result of the delay, provide the RE with
 the following documentation:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 A breakdown of costs by Item, activity, and date the material cost was incurred.
 Cost basis for the material at the time of an activity’s late start date as evidenced from documented
 vendor quotes.
 The cost of materials and transportation charges as evidenced by paid invoices.
 An analysis demonstrating that the activity or portions of the activity were forced to be performed
 when material costs were higher than those that were in effect on the planned late-finish date.
 
 For such material escalation and storage, the Department will make payment as follows:
 a.
 
 Increased Material Costs. The Department will make payment for the difference between the costs of
 materials, as specified in 104.03.08.5, and the cost of such materials that were available for the planned
 late-start to late-finish dates of an activity using the material. However, the cost of unacceptable
 material, and cost increases for fuel and asphalt are not eligible for payment. Furthermore, the
 Department will not make payment for quantities in excess of the amount necessary for construction,
 except where lesser quantities cannot be economically purchased and the excess has no significant reuse
 value. If the cost basis of materials is, in the opinion of the RE, excessive, the Department will establish
 the cost of the materials from market prices.
 
 25
 
 b.
 
 Increased Storage Costs. Obtain the RE’s approval before storing materials. The Department will
 make payment for additional storage costs as evidenced by certified vendor quotes detailing the terms of

 Overhead. The Department will make payment for overhead at the rate of 15 percent applied on the
 following:
 1.
 2.
 
 Total increased material costs as specified in 104.03.09.3.a.
 Total increased storage costs as specified in 104.03.09.3.b.
 
 From the total value of delay damages, when the Total Adjusted Contract Price cost is greater than the Total Contract
 Price, the Department will deduct the amount of 10 percent applied to the difference between the Total Adjusted
 Contract Price and the Total Contract Price. If this deduction is greater than the total value of delay damages, the
 Department will not deduct the difference from the Contractor.
 
 SECTION 105 – CONTROL OF WORK
 105.01 AUTHORITY OF THE DEPARTMENT
 105.01.01 RE
 The RE has the authority to direct work and the Contractor has an obligation to proceed as directed. The RE has the
 authority to reject work that is not in conformance with the Contract and direct its removal and replacement. If the
 Contractor fails to promptly remove or replace defective work as directed by the RE, the RE has the authority to direct
 Others to remove or replace the work. The Department has the right to recover costs incurred for such removal and
 replacement from the Contractor.
 Unless otherwise specified, send correspondence with the Department to the RE. Where correspondence is specified to
 be directed to persons other than the RE, send a copy to the RE. Ensure that correspondence complies with the
 following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 Assign every correspondence sent to the Department a unique correspondence serial number in the subject
 line, numbered sequentially beginning with Contractor Correspondence No. 1.
 If the correspondence includes a request for information or asks for an interpretation of the Contract, also
 assign a unique RFI serial number in the subject line numbered sequentially beginning with RFI-1.
 If the correspondence constitutes a notice of change as specified in 104.03.04, assign a unique change notice
 serial number in the subject line numbered sequentially beginning with Change Notice No. 1. For subsequent
 correspondence referring to a change notice or to the events that are the subject of a previous change notice,
 refer in the subject line to the original change notice number.
 
 The RE will decide questions that arise concerning the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 
 Quality and acceptability of the work.
 Progress of the Work.
 Interpretation of the Contract.
 Modifications to the Contract.
 The percentage for partial payments made in Estimates, as specified in 109.05.
 
 The RE has the authority to suspend the Work wholly or in part and to suspend Estimates, as specified in 109.05, for
 failure of the Contractor to correct conditions unsafe for the workers or the general public, for failure to carry out
 provisions of the Contract, or for failure to comply with RE direction. The RE also has the authority to suspend the
 Work wholly or in part for unsuitable weather, for conditions considered unsuitable for the prosecution of the Work or
 portion of the Work, or for any other condition or reason deemed to be in the interest of the public.
 
 26
 
 105.01.02 Inspection
 Inspectors employed or contracted by the Department are authorized to inspect work. Inspection may extend to the
 preparation, fabrication, or manufacture of the materials to be used. The inspector is not authorized to waive the
 provisions of or modify the Contract. The inspector is not authorized to act as foreman or perform other duties that are
 the responsibility of the Contractor. The inspector has the authority to reject work subject to confirmation by the RE.
 Each part or detail of the Work is subject to inspection by the Department. If the Department determines that work
 requires special inspection, testing, or approval not specified in the Contract, the Department will perform such
 inspection, testing, or approval.
 If an agency or entity financially participates in the Contract or has jurisdiction over portions of the Work, the agency or
 entity also has the right to inspect the Work. Such financial participation or inspection does not make an agency or entity
 a party to the Contract.
 Provide safe access for inspection to all parts of the Work. Provide the necessary assistance, including but not limited to
 traffic control, lighting, and scaffolding in order to allow a complete and detailed inspection. When the Department is
 within the Project Limits, the Department is an invitee of the Contractor.
 At any time before Acceptance, the RE has the right to direct the Contractor to expose specified portions of the finished
 work. If the exposed work is unacceptable, correct the work and restore the exposed area. Also, if subsequent work
 prevents inspection of the previous work, the RE has the right to direct the Contractor to remove and replace the
 subsequent work. The Department will not make payment for exposing, correcting, or restoring work or removing and
 replacing nonconforming work and any subsequent work that was required to be removed.
 The Department will make payment and may modify Contract Time for exposing the work and restoring the area as
 Extra Work if all of the following conditions are met:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 The exposed work was acceptable as specified in the Contract.
 The daily communications, as specified in 108.03, were given to the Department reasonably before the
 exposed work was originally performed.
 The work was not covered by subsequent work if the RE directed that such subsequent work not be
 performed.
 
 The Contractor is responsible for carrying out the provisions of the Contract at all times and for control of the quality of
 the Work regardless of whether an authorized inspector is present or not. Neither the observations of the RE in the
 administration of the Contract, nor inspections, tests, or approvals relieve the Contractor from its obligation to perform
 the Work in accordance with the Contract.
 105.02 RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR
 105.02.01 Labor and Equipment
 Provide labor and equipment sufficient to prosecute the Work, as specified in the Contract, to Completion. Ensure that
 the labor and equipment used to prosecute the Work do not cause damage to public or private property. Provide labor
 and equipment as follows:
 1.
 
 Labor. Employ workers that have sufficient skill and experience to properly perform the work assigned to
 them. Do not engage or employ current Department employees or workers that would cause the worker to be
 in violation of N.J.S.A. 52:13D-17.
 Upon written direction by the RE, the Contractor will remove Contractor employees or subcontractor
 employees who, in the opinion of the RE, are not performing the Work in a proper or skillful manner, or are
 intemperate, disorderly, or create a hostile environment. Do not allow the removed employee to be reemployed to perform any portion of the Work without written approval by the RE.
 
 2.
 
 Equipment. Provide equipment of sufficient size and mechanical condition to meet the requirements of the
 Contract. Ensure that each piece of equipment has an automatic audible warning signal when operating in
 reverse.
 Do not provide equipment that is owned or operated by firms or individuals suspended or debarred by the
 Department or included in the State of New Jersey Consolidated Debarment Report as maintained by the
 
 27
 
 Department of the Treasury, Division of Building and Construction, Bureau of Contractor Prequalification or
 in the Federal Government’s General Services Administration document titled “List of Parties Excluded from
 Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs (GSA List).”
 Equip construction equipment powered by an internal combustion engine with a properly maintained muffler.
 Fit air-powered equipment with pneumatic exhaust silencers. Ensure air compressors meet EPA noise
 emission standards. Do not operate stationary equipment powered by an internal combustion engine within
 150 feet of noise sensitive sites without portable noise barriers placed between the equipment and the noise
 sensitive sites. Noise sensitive sites include but are not limited to residential buildings, motels, hotels,
 schools, churches, hospitals, nursing homes, libraries, and public recreation areas.
 Whenever automatically-controlled equipment is specified and a breakdown or malfunction of the automatic
 controls occur, the Contractor may operate the equipment manually for the remainder of the day provided
 such operation produces results that comply with the Contract. Repair or replace the equipment so that it is
 controlled automatically before starting construction operations the next day.
 105.02.02 Superintendent
 Provide a competent, English-speaking superintendent and alternate who are experienced in the type of construction
 being performed and are capable of reading and understanding the Contract.
 Ensure that the superintendent and alternate have the authority to represent the Contractor. Ensure that the
 superintendent and the alternate have the authority to execute orders or direction from the RE, without delay, and to
 promptly supply materials, equipment, tools, labor, and incidentals as necessary.
 Ensure that the superintendent gives the Work the constant attention necessary to ensure its successful prosecution.
 Ensure that the superintendent cooperates with the RE, the Department inspectors, and Others. Ensure that the
 superintendent or the alternate is present at the work site at all times while the Work is in progress.
 The RE has the right to suspend the Work if the superintendent or the alternate is not present at the work site. The
 Department will not modify Contract time or make payment for such suspensions.
 105.02.03 Subcontracted Work
 Consent of the Department to allow work to be subcontracted, as specified in 108.01, does not relieve the Contractor of
 its responsibility for the Work, nor does it relieve the Surety of its obligations under the bond. The Contractor is
 responsible for the work of subcontractors. Ensure that the work performed by subcontractors conforms to the Contract.
 The Department’s consent to subcontract any part of the Work shall not be construed as approval of the subcontract or its
 terms, but only as approval of the Contractor’s request to subcontract to its chosen subcontractor.
 105.02.04 Fabricators and Suppliers
 If the Contractor is not the owner of the place where fabrication, preparation, or manufacture is in progress, the owner
 thereof is deemed to be the agent of the Contractor.
 105.03 CONFORMITY WITH CONTRACT
 The Contract is comprised of complementary documents that together describe the requirements of the Project.
 Requirements occurring in one are as binding as though occurring in all. Keep one set of Plans, Special Provisions,
 addenda, Change of Plan, Right of Way Plans, Standard Specifications, and Standard Details within the Project Limits at
 all times.
 In the event the Contractor discovers a discrepancy, error, omission, or ambiguity in the Contract, or if the Contractor
 has any doubt or question as to the intent or meaning of the Contract, the Contractor must immediately notify the RE as
 specified in 104.03.04. Do not take advantage of a discrepancy, error, omission, or ambiguity in the Contract. The
 Department will promptly make, in writing, interpretations or corrections if necessary. The Contractor is not relieved of
 the obligation to complete work because of a discrepancy, error, omission, or ambiguity. Do not make changes to the
 Work without written direction from the Department.
 If the RE determines that work is not in conformance with the Contract or RE direction, remove and replace the work.
 The Contractor may request RE approval to perform corrective action rather than remove and replace nonconforming
 
 28
 
 work. Submit a plan detailing a proposed method of performing corrective action to the RE for approval. Approval of a
 corrective action plan does not relieve the Contractor from providing work that is in conformance with the Contract.
 The Department will not make payment or modify Contract Time to correct or replace nonconforming work.
 If the RE identifies work that, while not in full conformance with the Contract, is reasonably acceptable, the RE will
 determine if the work may remain in place. The RE and the Contractor will negotiate an appropriate reduction in the
 Contract price. If the Department loses Federal funding for the nonconforming work, on the basis of permitting
 nonconforming work to remain, the Department will not pay for the work permitted to remain in place. If an appropriate
 modification cannot be negotiated, remove and replace or otherwise correct the work. Processing an Estimate or making
 payment, as specified in 109.05, does not imply or establish that the work is in conformance with the Contract.
 105.04 PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS
 Perform work in conformity with the lines, grades, cross-sections, dimensions, material requirements, and to the
 tolerances specified in the Contract. Whenever a slope is indicated in the Specifications, it is given in horizontal to
 vertical dimensions. The horizontal is indicated with an “H” and the vertical is indicated with a “V.” In case of
 discrepancy, calculated dimensions will govern over scaled dimensions; Plans will govern over Specifications;
 Department issued documents will govern over Contractor-submitted documents, ROW Plans will govern over Plans
 when setting monuments; Special Provisions will govern over Standard Specifications, and Project-specific Plans will
 govern over Standard Details.
 105.05 WORKING DRAWINGS
 When working drawings are specified, submit methods of construction, material designations, design calculations,
 catalogue cuts, illustrations, schedules, performance charts, brochures, and other information necessary to construct the
 work as specified in the Contract. Do not submit working drawings that are repetitious or duplicative of Items specified
 or detailed within the Contract or that change the Plans or Specifications.
 Ensure that working drawing submissions also conform to the Department design manuals and other Department
 standards for the proposed work. After Award, the Department will provide additional formatting information, the
 number of copies required, and the designated design unit to which the Contractor shall submit working drawings.
 Submit working drawings on 22 × 36-inch sheets or 8-1/2 × 11-inch sheets. Submit design calculations required for the
 working drawings on 8-1/2 × 11-inch paper. Submit 7 copies of the working drawings to the designated design unit for
 review with a copy of the transmittal letter to the RE. For railroad-carrying structures, submit 4 additional copies to the
 designated design unit. Submit an additional copy for each outside testing agency or authority involved in the Project.
 For 22 × 36-inch sheets, locate the title block in the lower right-hand corner of each sheet. For 8-1/2 × 11-inch sheets,
 provide a cover sheet with the title block. Do not include the title block on subsequent 8-1/2 × 11-inch sheets. Include
 in the title block the following minimum information:

 Review, sign, and submit working drawings in an orderly sequence so as not to delay the Work, or the work performed
 by Others. By submitting working drawings for review and approval, the Contractor certifies that it has verified all field
 measurements and that all dimensions shown conform to the Contract. The Contractor further certifies that catalog
 numbers, field construction criteria, materials, and other criteria have been coordinated with the requirements of the
 Contract and the Work for each submitted working drawing. Working drawing notes regarding materials do not satisfy
 the requirements for materials approval as specified in 106.04. The certification or approval of working drawings does
 not constitute an approval of any materials noted.
 The Department’s certification or approval of working drawings signifies only that the drawings are in general
 conformance with the Contract. The Department’s certification or approval of working drawings does not relieve the
 Contractor from responsibility for errors and omissions in the working drawings and their correction.

 1.
 
 Wholly State-Funded Projects. Comply with N.J.S.A. 52:32-1 and N.J.S.A. 52:33-1, et seq., which
 prohibits the use by the Contractor or subcontractors of farm products or materials produced or manufactured
 outside of the United States on public work. The Department may allow exceptions if its enforcement would
 be inconsistent with the public interest, where the cost of enforcing the prohibition would be unreasonable, or
 where the material in question is not of a class or kind mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.
 
 2.
 
 Federal Aid Projects. Comply with the Federal statutes and regulations that establish the “Buy America”
 requirements applicable to the Project. These Federal requirements, which are contained in 23 CFR 635.409
 and 23 CFR 635.410, mandate among other things that manufacturing processes for iron and steel materials
 and all iron and steel coatings must be performed in the United States.
 
 If the use of foreign materials is allowed, the Department may require the Contractor to deliver the material to a
 Department-approved site for sampling, inspection, and testing. Do not use or incorporate the foreign material into the
 Work before the Department approves the material.
 If the Department finds the Contractor failed to comply with the Federal or State provisions regarding foreign materials,
 the Department may require the unapproved foreign material be removed and replaced with acceptable material. If the
 Department decides not to remove the unapproved foreign material, the Department will not make payment for the Item
 incorporating unapproved foreign material, and will make the findings, including the Contractor’s name, public.
 106.04 MATERIALS QUESTIONNAIRE
 At least 30 days before shipment of a material, and at least 30 days before fabrication of structural steel, precast concrete,
 and prestressed concrete Items, notify the RE of the proposed source of materials using the Materials Questionnaire form
 provided by the Department. For soil aggregate and dense graded aggregate (DGA) material, submit a copy of recently
 performed test results for washed gradation test, proctor test, and other tests, as specified in 901.11, for the source with
 the Materials Questionnaire. For ITS systems as specified in Section 704, obtain approval of system working drawings
 before submitting the materials on the Materials Questionnaire.
 The Department will approve the source of material based on conformance of the source or material with the
 requirements of the Contract. If the material is required by the Contract to be listed on the QPL, the Department will
 base approval on the QPL. A material is not approved for use solely because the product is on the QPL; the Contractor
 must submit the material for approval. Do not order, fabricate, or procure materials before obtaining material source
 approval by the Department.
 Approval by the ME of a proposed source of aggregate materials does not constitute approval of materials delivered to
 the Project Limits from that source, but is permission to select and use materials from that source only so long as they
 conform to the Specifications. As the work progresses, ensure that materials selected from approved sources continue to
 conform to the Specifications.
 
 35
 
 The Department will not approve material from firms and individuals suspended or debarred by the Department,
 included in the State of New Jersey Consolidated Debarment Report as maintained by the Department of the Treasury,
 Division of Building and Construction, Bureau of Contractor Prequalification, or in the Federal Government’s General
 Services Administration document titled “List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement
 Programs (GSA List).”
 106.05 MATERIALS INSPECTIONS, TESTS, AND SAMPLES
 All materials being used are subject to inspection and testing at any time before Acceptance. For materials that are
 stored, locate the materials so that the Department may promptly and conveniently inspect them. The Department’s test
 results are the official test results for acceptance or rejection of materials. The Department will base acceptance or
 rejection on acceptance testing results or Certifications of Compliance for the various materials as specified in the
 respective methods of test or in the Subsections applicable to that particular material or work. After inspection, store
 materials to ensure the preservation of their quality. The Department has the right to re-inspect or retest materials
 regardless of previous approvals.
 The Department may require additional samples to determine the quality and suitability of materials for their intended
 uses. The provisions in Section 106 do not limit the rights of the Department to order special inspections or tests as
 specified in 105.01.02.
 Submit to the RE a request for HMA plant and field inspection, concrete plant and field inspection, and in-place testing
 for soil aggregate by 1:00 p.m. of the day before the requested inspection, or by 1:00 p.m. of the previous Friday for
 inspections requested for a Monday. With the request, provide the RE with the locations, estimated quantities, and
 estimated start times for each type of material. If the start time for a material delivery is delayed by more than 2 hours,
 the Department has the right to cancel the request, and require the Contractor to submit a new request.
 The Department will not pay for unapproved materials, and the Contractor shall remove and replace unapproved
 materials at no cost to the Department.
 When the Department performs testing on materials, the Department will bear the expense of the testing except as
 otherwise specified.
 For aggregates that do not meet the requirements of the Contract for gradation or density or are not used in the Work, the
 Department has the right to charge the Contractor for the cost of sampling and testing at Departmental rates. The
 Department will charge $300.00 per failing sample tested for gradation and $200.00 per failing lot or sub-lot tested for
 density.
 106.06 PLANT INSPECTION
 The ME has the right to inspect the materials at the source and has the right to inspect manufacturing plants periodically
 for compliance with specified manufacturing methods. The ME may obtain material samples for laboratory testing for
 compliance with materials quality requirements at the plant or may use plant inspection as the basis for the acceptability
 of manufactured materials.
 In the event plant inspection is undertaken, meet the following conditions:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 Ensure that the ME has the cooperation and assistance of the Contractor and the producer.
 Ensure that the ME has full access at all times to such parts of the plant as may concern the manufacture or
 production of the materials being furnished.
 If required for the use of the ME, provide office space located conveniently in or near the plant.
 Ensure that adequate safety measures for the ME are provided and maintained.
 
 The Department reserves the right to retest or re-inspect materials that have been approved at the source of supply after
 they have been delivered and to reject materials which, when retested or re-inspected, do not meet the requirements of
 the Contract.
 106.07 CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE
 The Department will accept materials, as specified, on the basis of Certificates of Compliance stating that the materials
 or assemblies fully comply with the requirements of the Contract.
 
 36
 
 The Department has the right to sample and test materials or assemblies accepted on the basis of Certificates of
 Compliance at any time. The Department will reject materials or assemblies, whether in place or not, if found not to be
 in conformance with the Contract requirements.
 Ensure that 4 copies of the manufacturer’s Certificates of Compliance are provided with each delivery of materials,
 components, and manufactured items that are accepted by certification. Retain 1 copy and submit 3 copies to the RE.
 With the Certificate of Compliance, provide a transmittal identifying the Item for which it is submitted. Ensure that
 Certificates of Compliance contain the following information:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 6.
 7.
 
 Project Name.
 Name of the Prime Contractor.
 Material description.
 Quantity of material represented by the certificate.
 Means of identifying the consignment, such as label marking and seal number.
 Date and method of shipment.
 A statement that the material conforms to the Contract material requirements and that representative samples
 have been sampled and tested.
 8. If the submission is for an assembly of materials, a statement that the assembly conforms to the Contract.
 9. Signature of a person having legal authority to bind the supplier.
 10. Signature attested to by a notary public or other properly authorized person.
 The Department will not make payment for work for which material is accepted on the basis of a Certificate of
 Compliance until the RE has received the required Certificate of Compliance and inspected and accepted the material or
 assembly.
 106.08 UNACCEPTABLE MATERIAL
 Materials, whether in place or not, that do not conform to the requirements of the Contract, are considered unacceptable.
 The Department will reject unacceptable materials. Immediately remove rejected materials, unless approved by the RE
 as specified in 105.03. Do not use rejected material, for which the defects have been corrected, until approval has been
 given by the RE.
 106.09 SUBSTITUTES FOR PROPRIETARY ITEMS
 If material or equipment is specified in the Contract by using the name of a proprietary item or the name of a particular
 supplier, the Contractor may propose a substitute except when the Special Provisions state that no substitution is
 permitted. To request approval for using a substitute item of material or equipment, submit a written request to the RE
 including the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 6.
 
 Certification that the proposed substitute performs the functions and achieves the results called for by the
 design, is similar and of equal substance to that specified, and is suited to the same use as that specified.
 Details or catalogue cut sheets on the material properties of the substitute.
 A statement that the evaluation and approval of the proposed substitute does not hinder the Contractor’s
 ability to complete the Contract as specified in 108.10.
 A statement that the proposed substitute for use in the Work does not change or modify the Contract.
 Difference between the proposed substitute from that specified.
 Manufacturer’s recommendations, maintenance requirements, and repair or replacement requirements for the
 substitute.
 
 Submit additional information as requested by the Department to assist the Department’s evaluation. The Department
 will evaluate the request and notify the Contractor in writing of approval or rejection of the proposed substitute. The
 Department has the right to require the Contractor to provide, at no cost to the Department, a special performance
 guarantee or other bond with respect to a substitute.
 If, during the use of the substitute material or equipment, the RE determines that the work produced is not in
 conformance with the Contract, immediately discontinue the use of the substitute and complete the remaining work with
 the specified material or equipment. Remove the deficient work and replace it, or take corrective action as directed by
 the RE. The Department will not make payment or modify Contract Time to remove and replace work resulting from an
 authorized substitution.

 SECTION 107 – LEGAL RELATIONS
 107.01 LEGAL JURISDICTION
 107.01.01 Applicable Law
 This Contract shall be construed and governed by the Constitution and laws of the State. It is the Contractor’s
 responsibility to be aware of and comply with Federal, State, and local laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations, and
 orders and decrees of bodies or tribunals having jurisdiction or authority that affect those engaged or employed on the
 Work, or that affect the conduct of the Work. The Contractor shall observe and comply with, and ensure the
 Contractor’s agents and employees observe and comply with, laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders, and decrees.
 Defend and indemnify the State and its representatives against any claim or liability arising from or based on the
 violation of any such law, ordinance, regulation, order, or decree, whether by the Contractor or the Contractor’s agents or
 employees, subcontractors of any tier, or suppliers. If discrepancies or inconsistencies are discovered between any
 document of the Contract and any law, ordinance, regulation, order, or decree, immediately notify the RE in writing.
 107.01.02 Permits, Licenses, and Approvals
 Procure permits, grants, licenses, authorizations, certifications, and other approvals for the prosecution of the Work,
 except where the Department has procured such permits, grants, licenses, authorizations, certifications, and other
 approvals.
 For existing permits previously obtained by the Department, submit proposed modifications to the permits to the
 Department for approval before submitting them to the regulatory agencies having jurisdiction and interest. After
 receiving the Department’s approval, obtain the necessary approvals from the appropriate regulatory agencies. Do not
 begin work covered by the proposed permit modification until the necessary approvals are obtained from the designated
 regulatory agencies. Before beginning the work affected by the modification, provide a copy of the approval,
 authorization, or modification to the RE.
 Keep copies of current permits, grants, licenses, authorizations, certifications, other approvals, and modifications within
 the Project Limits. Clearly post a copy of each so that it is publicly available for inspection. Before beginning work that
 requires Contractor-procured permits, grants, licenses, authorizations, certifications, or other approvals, provide a copy
 to the RE.
 If the Contractor is not in compliance with required permits, grants, licenses, authorizations, certifications, or other
 approvals, the Contractor shall take corrective actions immediately. The RE has the right to suspend the Work as
 specified in 108.13, until the Contractor is in full compliance. Provide to the RE, whenever requested, documentation
 pertaining to the noncompliance and related corrective actions taken. The Department will not make payment for or
 modify Contract Time for performing corrective and remedial work required to bring the Contractor into compliance.
 The Contractor is responsible to pay fines levied against the Contractor, its agents, employees, and subcontractors that
 arise out of or are alleged to arise out of noncompliance with permits, grants, licenses, authorizations, certifications, or
 other approvals. The Department will recover from the Contractor costs due to fines levied against the Department that
 arise out of, or are alleged to arise out of, noncompliance by the Contractor, its agents, employees, and subcontractors
 with permits, grants, licenses, authorizations, certifications, or other approvals. The Department may hold the Contractor
 responsible for all engineering, inspection, and administration costs (including overhead) incurred as a result of the
 Contractor’s noncompliance.
 107.01.03 Sovereign Immunity
 The Department, by entering into this Contract, does not waive its Sovereign Immunity, except as provided under
 N.J.S.A. 59:13-1, et seq. The rights or benefits provided the Contractor in this Contract that exceed those provided under
 N.J.S.A. 59:13-1, et seq., are contractual in nature, and do not expand the waiver of Sovereign Immunity provided under
 N.J.S.A. 59:13-1, et seq.
 107.02 DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ON PUBLIC WORKS
 Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 10:2-1, the Contractor agrees that in the hiring of persons for the performance of work under the
 Contract or any subcontract, or for the procurement, manufacture, assembling, or furnishing of materials, equipment,
 
 38
 
 supplies, or services to be acquired under the Contract, the Contractor, subcontractor, or any person acting on their behalf
 shall not discriminate against any person who is qualified and available to perform the work to which the employment
 relates by reason of race, creed, color, national origin, age, ancestry, marital status, gender, or affectional or sexual
 orientation.
 The Contractor, subcontractor, or any person acting on their behalf shall not, in any manner, discriminate against or
 intimidate any employee engaged in the performance of the Work under the Contract or any subcontract hereunder, or
 engaged in the procurement, manufacture, assembling, or furnishing of any such materials, equipment, supplies, or
 services to be acquired under such Contract, by reason of race, creed, color, national origin, age, ancestry, marital status,
 gender, or affectional or sexual orientation.
 The Department has the right to deduct a penalty of $50.00 for each person for each day that the person is discriminated
 against or intimidated in violation of the provisions of the Contract pursuant to N.J.S.A. 10:2-1. The Department has the
 right to terminate the Contract, and any monies due the Contractor under the Contract may be forfeited, for any violation
 of this Subsection occurring after notice to the Contractor from the Department of any prior violation of this Subsection.
 107.03 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES, OR EMERGING SMALL
 BUSINESS ENTERPRISE
 It is the public policy of the State and of the United States that no individual, group, firm, or corporation working on or
 seeking to work on a Public Works Project should be discriminated against on the basis of race, creed, color, national
 origin, age, ancestry, nationality, marital or domestic partnership status, gender, disability, liability for military service,
 affectional or sexual orientation, atypical cellular or blood trait, or genetic information (including the refusal to submit to
 genetic testing). The Department has developed Affirmative Action, Disadvantaged Business Enterprise, or Emerging
 Small Business Enterprise Programs to implement this policy, and the regulations and requirements applicable to the
 Contract are contained in the Special Provisions. The Department will resolve conflicts between these regulations and
 requirements and the other provisions of the Contract to further the above stated public policy.
 107.04 NEW JERSEY CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY ACT
 The Contractor agrees to be responsible for compliance with N.J.S.A. 59:13-1, et seq. The Contract does not in any way
 waive or amend the Contractor’s duties under N.J.S.A. 59:13-1, et seq.
 The various notice provisions specified in the Contract are contractual obligations that are in addition to the Contractor’s
 notice obligations under N.J.S.A. 59:13-1, et seq. The Contractor must submit a fully completed Contractual Notice
 Form in order to comply with the notice requirements of N.J.S.A. 59:13-5, et seq.
 The Contractor acknowledges that it will be forever barred from recovering against the State if it fails to give timely
 notice in accordance with N.J.S.A. 59:13-1, et seq., on the Contractual Notice Form, of any happening of an event, thing,
 or occurrence or of an act or failure to act, by the Department, and that the Contractor is solely responsible for complying
 with the various notice requirements and the timeliness of a claim as set forth under N.J.S.A. 59:13-1, et seq.
 For purposes of determining the date of “completion of the contract” pursuant to N.J.S.A. 59:13-5, “completion of the
 contract” occurs on the date that the Contractor provides written notice to the Department of Acceptance or conditional
 Acceptance of the Proposed Final Certificate or the 30th day after the Department issues the Proposed Final Certificate,
 whichever event occur first.
 Subcontractors, suppliers, manufacturers, and fabricators are barred from making claims against the Department as a
 matter of law by N.J.S.A. 59:13-1, et seq.
 107.05 LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY
 Regarding any claim arising from a breach of Contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, the State will not be
 liable to the Contractor for any special, consequential, incidental, or penal damages, including, but not limited to, loss of
 profit or revenues, loss of rental value for contractor-owned equipment, damages to associated equipment, cost of capital,
 or interest, except as permitted by N.J.S.A. 59:13-8.
 
 39
 
 107.06 PERSONAL LIABILITY OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS
 There shall be no liability upon the Department or authorized representatives of the Department, either personally or as
 officials of the State, in carrying out any of the provisions of the Contract or in exercising any power or authority granted
 to them by or within the scope of the Contract, it being understood that in all such matters they act solely as agents and
 representatives of the State. Similarly, for projects on county or local roads, there shall be no liability, either personally
 or in an official capacity, upon the Board of Chosen Freeholders of the county or counties, or upon the governing body
 of the municipality or municipalities within the Project Limits.
 107.07 ASSIGNMENT
 Do not assign the performance of the Contract.
 Do not transfer or assign to any party any Contract funds, due or to become due, or claims of any nature the Contractor
 has against the Department, without obtaining the written approval of the Department. The Department, by sole
 discretion, may grant or deny such approval.
 107.08 NON WAIVER
 Provisions of the Contract do not waive other provisions of the Contract unless specifically stated.
 If the Department waives a provision of the Contract for a particular occurrence, this waiver does not constitute a
 continued waiver by the Department of that provision or any other provision of the Contract.
 107.09 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR
 The relationship of the Contractor to the State is that of an independent contractor, and the Contractor, shall conduct
 itself consistent with such status. It shall neither hold itself out, as nor claim to be, an officer or employee of the
 Department by reason hereof. Do not make a claim, demand, or application to or for the rights or privileges applicable to
 an officer or employee of the Department, including, but not limited to, Workers Compensation Insurance,
 unemployment insurance benefits, social security coverage, or retirement membership or credit.
 107.10 NON-THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY CLAUSE
 No provision of the Contract is intended to make the public or any member thereof a third party beneficiary, or to
 authorize anyone not a party to the Contract to maintain a suit for personal injuries or property damage pursuant to the
 terms or provisions of the Contract.
 It is the further intent of the Department and the Contractor in executing the Contract that no individual, firm,
 corporation, or any combination thereof, that supplies materials, labor, services, or equipment to the Contractor for the
 performance of the Work becomes thereby a third party beneficiary of the Contract. The Department and the Contractor
 understand that such individual, firm, corporation, or combination thereof, has no right to bring an action in the courts of
 this State against the Department, by virtue of this lack of standing, and also by virtue of the provisions of N.J.S.A.
 59:13-1, et seq., which allows suit against the State in Contract only on the basis of express contracts or contracts
 implied in fact.
 107.11 RISKS ASSUMED BY THE CONTRACTOR
 The Contractor shall take every precaution, as allowed by the Contract, against injury or damage to any part of the
 Project by the action of the elements, the traveling public, vandalism, or from any other cause, whether arising from the
 execution or the non-execution of the work.
 The Contractor cannot impute the negligence of consultants, other contractors, Utilities (other than the Department),
 other public entities, persons or entities to the Department.
 The Contractor assumes the following distinct and several risks, whether they arise from acts or omissions, whether
 negligent or not, and whether such risks are within or beyond the control of the Contractor, as specified in 107.11.1 to
 107.11.4. Excepted from this assumption of risks are only those risks that arise from solely affirmative acts by the State
 subsequent to the execution of the Contract with actual and willful intent to cause loss, damage, or injury. The risks are
 assumed by the Contractor as follows:
 
 40
 
 1.
 
 Damage Caused by the Contractor. The Contractor bears the risk of all loss or damage caused by the
 Contractor, the Contractor’s agents or employees, subcontractors of any tier, suppliers, or agents making
 deliveries. Protect and preserve public and private property from damage or loss in the prosecution of the
 Work. Promptly repair or replace such damage or loss as directed by the RE. The Department will not make
 payment or modify Contract Time for such repair or replacement.
 If the Contractor damages the Department’s fiber optic network, the Contractor shall immediately notify the
 RE and the Traffic Operations Center. The Contractor shall include in the notification if the Contractor shall
 perform the repairs or if it is necessary for the Department to perform the repairs. If the Contractor can not
 complete the repairs in the time specified by the RE, the Department has the right to repair the damage and
 recover the cost for the repair from the Contractor. The Department will assess liquidated damages for lost
 services at the rate of $1000 per hour.
 
 2.
 
 Risks of Loss or Damage to the Construction. Until Acceptance, the Contractor bears the risk of all loss or
 damage to materials and to construction performed under the Contract. Promptly repair or replace such
 damage or loss. The Department will not make payment or modify Contract Time for repairing or replacing
 loss or damage.
 The Contractor shall not bear such risk of loss or damage for the repair or replacement of any permanent
 element of work if the element of the work damaged is completed and is serving its intended function, is
 subsequently damaged by a public traffic accident, and the Contractor provides the RE satisfactory evidence
 that such damage was caused by a public traffic accident. Satisfactory evidence is limited to:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 Accident reports filed with the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission.
 Documents supporting the damage issued by police agencies or insurance companies.
 Statements by reliable, unbiased eye witnesses.
 Identification of the vehicle involved in the accident.
 
 The Contractor shall not bear the risk of loss or damage that arises from acts of war, floods, tidal waves,
 earthquakes, cyclones, tornadoes, hurricanes, or other cataclysmic natural phenomenon, unless such loss or
 damage is covered by the Contractor’s insurance.
 3.
 
 Risks of Claims on Account of Injury, Loss, or Damage. The Contractor bears the risk of claims, just or
 unjust, by third persons made against the Contractor or the State, on account of injuries (including wrongful
 death), loss, or damage of any kind whatsoever arising or alleged to arise out of or in connection with the
 performance of the Work. The risk of claims, whether or not actually caused by or resulting from the
 performance of the Work or out of or in connection with the Contractor’s operations or presence at or within
 the Project Limits, whether such claims are made and whether such injuries, loss, and damages are sustained,
 applies at any time both before and after Acceptance.
 
 4.
 
 Risks of Loss to Property of Those Performing the Work. The Contractor bears the risk of loss or damage
 to any property of the Contractor, and of claims made against the Contractor or the State for loss or damage to
 any property of subcontractors, workers, and others performing the Work, and to lessors. Said risk occurs at
 any time before removal of such property from the Project Limits, the State’s ROW, or any other property
 procured by the Contractor for the Project.
 
 Defend and indemnify the State from any and all claims or alleged claims described in 107.11.3 and 107.11.4, and for all
 expense incurred by the State in the defense, including legal and related costs, settlement, or satisfaction thereof. If so
 directed by the State, the Contractor shall at its own expense defend against such claims, in which event it shall not,
 without obtaining express advance permission from the State, raise any defense involving in any way jurisdiction of the
 tribunal, immunity of the State, governmental nature of the State, or the provisions of any statutes respecting suits
 against the State.
 The provisions of this Subsection are also for the benefit of the State, its agents, officers, and employees so that they
 have all the rights that they would have under this Subsection if they were named at each place above at which the State
 is named, including a direct right of action against the Contractor to enforce the foregoing indemnity except, however,
 that the State may at any time in its sole discretion and without liability on its part cancel the benefit conferred on any of
 them by this Subsection, whether or not the occasion for invoking such benefit has already arisen at the time of such
 cancellation.
 
 41
 
 Except as specified in 107.11.2, Acceptance, the Final Certificate, or Termination does not release the Contractor from
 its obligations under this Subsection.
 The enumeration in this Subsection or elsewhere in this Contract of particular risks assumed by the Contractor or of
 particular claims for which it is responsible shall not be deemed:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 To limit the effect of the provisions of this Subsection or of any other provision of the Contract relating to
 such risks or claims; or
 To imply that the Contractor assumes or is responsible for risks or claims only of the type enumerated in this
 Subsection; or
 To limit the risks that the Contractor would assume or the claims for which the Contractor would be
 responsible in the absence of such enumerations.
 
 The Contractor expressly understands and agrees that any insurance protection required by the Contract, or otherwise
 provided by the Contractor, in no way limits the Contractor’s responsibility to defend and indemnify the State. Such
 insurance requirements are designed to provide greater assurance to the State that the Contractor is financially able to
 discharge its obligations under this Subsection and as to the risks assumed elsewhere in the Contract, and are not in any
 way construed as a limitation on the nature and extent of such obligations.
 107.12 THE CONTRACTUAL CLAIM RESOLUTION PROCESS
 107.12.01 Satisfying the Notice Requirements
 If the Contractor has provided the RE notice of change as specified in 104.03.04, the RE and the Contractor may
 negotiate a resolution, even if the full impact has not been determined. If a notice of change has not been resolved, the
 Contractor may initiate the contractual claims resolution process.
 To initiate the contractual claims resolution process, submit to the RE a Contractual Notice Form for the claim. At a
 minimum, include the following information with the Contractual Notice Form:
 1.
 
 A detailed factual statement of the claim providing all necessary dates, locations, and Items affected by the
 claim.
 2. The date on which facts arose that gave rise to the claim.
 3. A copy of notice given to the Department pursuant to any other Subsection of the Contract that relates to the
 matter giving rise to the claim.
 4. The name, function, and activity of each individual involved in or knowledgeable about the claim.
 5. The specific provisions of the Contract that support the claim and a statement of the reasons why the
 provisions support the claim.
 6. A detailed factual statement of the actions taken by the Contractor to mitigate the claim.
 7. If the claim relates to a decision of the Department that the Contract leaves to the Department’s discretion or
 as to which the Contract provides that the Department’s decision is final, the Contractor shall set out in detail
 the facts supporting its contention that the decision of the Department was fraudulent, arbitrary, or capricious.
 8. The identification of documents and the substance of communications relating to such claim.
 9. If an extension of Contract Time is sought, the specific days sought and the basis for the claim, supported by
 the Contractor’s approved baseline progress schedule and updates, as well as relevant fragnets. Include a time
 impact evaluation of the delay as specified in 108.11.01.C.
 10. If additional payment is sought, provide a breakdown of the amount sought in the manner specified in
 104.03.08, or other calculations and basis of the amount sought.
 11. If additional payment is sought, the Contractor may provide the bid documents when escrowed with an
 escrow custody agent, as specified in 103.05.
 12. The Contractor must state in writing that all documentation in support of the claim has been provided to the
 Department and that the Contractor has requested that the review process begin.
 If the Department determines that the submitted Contractual Notice Form does not provide sufficient information, the
 Department will consider the Contractual Notice Form incomplete for the purpose of processing the claim under the
 Contractual Claim Resolution Process, and the Department will notify the Contractor of the missing components
 required to start the process. The Department will not initiate formal discussions or meetings concerning a claim
 submitted on an incomplete Contractual Notice Form.
 The Department will review alleged liability and damages at the same time.
 
 42
 
 107.12.02 Steps
 The Department will not process or review claims submitted by a subcontractor or supplier at any tier. Claims submitted
 by the Contractor are eligible only for payment when there is an obligation or liability on the part of the Contractor and
 shall not be a pass through of a claim by a subcontractor or by a supplier.
 A Contractor may initiate the Contractual Claims Resolution Process up to 30 days after the issuance of the proposed
 Final Certificate.
 The Contractual Claims Resolution Process may continue beyond the “completion of the contract” as defined in 107.04;
 however, the Contractual Claims Resolution Process will not extend any statute of limitation that may apply to a claim.
 The Contractual Claims Resolution Process is sequential in nature and is composed of the following steps:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 Step I – Review by the RE.
 Step II – Review by the Dispute Review Board.
 Step III – Review by the Claims Committee.
 Step IV – Non-Binding Mediation.
 
 The Department will not allow a claim to proceed to the next level of review unless and until the claim has been
 reviewed at the preceding step. Additionally, the Department will not allow the claim to proceed to the next level until
 the Contractor indicates in writing that the decision of the previous step is unacceptable and requests that the claim be
 forwarded to the next step within the specified timeframe. If during any step in the process, a claim is resolved, the
 Contractor must sign an unconditional release, provided by the Department, as to all matters arising from the claim.
 The Contractor is limited to the documentation provided to the Department at the beginning of Step I throughout all steps
 of the Contractual Claims Resolution Process. Submission of additional information by the Contractor at any subsequent
 step is cause for the claim to be returned by the Department to Step I for review. The Department will inform the
 Contractor in writing if the claim is returned to Step I. If a claim is returned, it must proceed through all completed steps
 in the process again.
 The Department will not pay interest on the amount of any payment made in resolution or settlement of a claim resolved
 through the Contractual Claims Resolution Process.
 When the value of the claim submitted by the Contractor is $20,000 or less, the Step II review will be the final step in the
 Contractual Claims Resolution Process. For such claims, the decision of the Dispute Review Board is final and
 terminates the Contractual Claims Resolution Process.
 Where there has been a determination at Step I or Step II that the Contract does not provide a basis for the claim or that
 the Contractor has failed to timely submit a notice of claim pursuant to N.J.S.A. 59:13-1, et seq., the Department reserves
 the right to terminate the Contractual Claims Resolution Process at the end of Step II. For such claims, the Secretary of
 the Department Claims Committee will provide the Contractor with the reasons for the termination of the Contractual
 Claims Resolution Process and the rejection of the claim. The review of a claim at any step does not constitute a waiver
 by the Department of its defenses that the Contract does not provide a basis for the claim or that the Contractor failed to
 timely submit a notice of claim pursuant to N.J.S.A. 59:13-1, et seq.
 When the Contractual Claims Resolution Process is terminated for a claim as a result of the Contractor’s act or failure to
 act, the Contractor waives its rights to further participation in the Contractual Claims Resolution Process for that claim.
 The Contractual Claims Resolution Process is as follows:
 1.
 
 Step I, RE. The RE will render a written decision regarding the claim presented by the Contractor within 20
 days after the RE has determined that sufficient information was provided by the Contractor on the
 Contractual Notice Form as specified in 107.12.01. This time limit may be extended by mutual agreement of
 the parties.
 Within 10 days of the receipt of the decision by the RE, the Contractor shall either accept or reject the
 decision in writing; or upon failure to accept or reject the decision in writing, the Department will terminate

 107.13 LITIGATION OF CLAIMS BY THE CONTRACTOR
 The Contractual Claims Resolution Process is not an administrative procedure but is contractual in nature, intended to
 review properly filed and documented claims. The exhaustion of the Claims Resolution Process is not a prerequisite to
 the filing of a legal action against the Department. The Contractor, however, must fully comply with all of the terms and
 conditions of N.J.S.A. 59:13-1, et seq. before commencing a legal action. Therefore, where a Contractor brings a legal
 action, arising out of a Contract, against the Department, its agents, officers, or employees, arising out of or related,
 directly or indirectly, to a claim pending against the Department, the Contractual Claims Resolution Process, at any step,
 shall terminate as to that claim(s) or related claims being litigated, no matter which level of review the claim may be at
 when the legal action is filed. The Department will, thereafter, resolve such claim(s) under the legal action, subject to
 the provisions of N.J.S.A. 59:13-1, et seq. The Contractor may submit claims to the Department for processing through
 the Contractual Claims Resolution Process that are unrelated to pending litigation, subject to the terms of the Contract
 and N.J.S.A. 59:13-1, et seq.
 In a legal action, the Contractor’s remedy for additional payment or an extension of Contract Time shall not exceed the
 actual additional costs incurred by the Contractor resulting directly from the change. In addition, the damages sought by
 the Contractor shall not exceed the amount allowed by force account as specified in 104.03.08. The Contractor bears the
 burden of proving compliance with the requirements of the Contract, and must maintain all records required under the
 Contract.

 used in the Work, obtain permission for such use by suitable legal agreement with the patentee or owner. Pay the costs
 for the use of patented materials, equipment, devices, or processes used on or incorporated in the Work. Defend and
 indemnify the State and the Department, affected third parties, or political subdivision from any and all claims filed
 against the State or Department for infringement of patented designs, devices, materials, or processes, or any trademark
 or copyright. The Contractor is responsible for all costs, expenses, and damages that the Contractor may be obliged to
 pay by reason of an infringement during the performance of the Work or after Acceptance.
 107.15 TAXES
 N.J.S.A. 54:32B-9 provides that any sale or service to the State, or any of its agencies, instrumentalities, public
 authorities, public corporations (including a public corporation created pursuant to agreement or compact with another
 state), or political subdivisions where the State is the purchaser, user, or consumer, is not subject to the sales and use
 taxes imposed under the Sales and Use Tax Act. N.J.S.A. 54:32B-8 provides that sales of materials, supplies, or services
 made to contractors, subcontractors, or repairmen for exclusive use in erecting structures, or building on, or otherwise
 improving, altering, or repairing real property of the above listed bodies are exempt from the tax on retail sales imposed
 by the Sales and Use Tax Act. The sales tax exemption does not apply to equipment used for Contract work or for force
 account work whether the equipment is to be purchased or rented. The Contractor may obtain the required Contractor’s
 Exemption Purchase Certificate (Form No. ST-13) to apply for the exemption, by writing or calling the New Jersey
 Division of Taxation, Tax Information Services, P.O. Box 269, Trenton, New Jersey 08625, or any New Jersey Division
 of Taxation Regional Office.
 Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:49-19, et seq., and notwithstanding any provisions of the law to the contrary, whenever a
 taxpayer, partnership, or S-corporation under contract to provide goods, services, or construction projects to the State or
 its agencies or instrumentalities, including the legislative and judicial branches of the State government, is entitled to
 payment for those goods or services at the same time a taxpayer, partner, or shareholder of that entity is indebted for any
 State tax, the Director of the Division of Taxation will seek to set off the necessary payment to satisfy the indebtedness.
 
 45
 
 The amount set off shall not allow for the deduction of any expense or other deductions that might be attributable to the
 taxpayer, partner, or shareholder subject to set-off under this act.
 The Director of the Division of Taxation will give notice of the set-off to the taxpayer, partner, or shareholder and will
 provide an opportunity for a hearing within 90 days of the notice under the procedures for protests established under
 N.J.S.A. 54:49-18. No request for conference, protest, or subsequent appeal to the tax court from any protest, shall stay
 the collection of the indebtedness. The Department will stay interest that may be payable by the State to the taxpayer,
 pursuant to N.J.S.A. 52:32-32, et seq.

 Provide 5 foot-candles for the indicated lighting area outside the limits for 10 foot-candles to a minimum of 100 feet
 ahead and 100 feet behind equipment
 
 Ensure that lighting equipment is in good operating condition, and in compliance with applicable NEC and
 NEMA codes. Use freestanding portable or trailer-mounted towers capable of being moved as needed to keep
 pace with construction operations.
 For moving operations, ensure that lighting and illuminance requirements are maintained where the work is in
 progress and that lighting keeps pace with the operation. Provide sufficient fuel, spare lamps, generators, and
 qualified personnel to ensure that required illuminance levels are maintained continuously during night
 
 52
 
 operations. If at any time minimum illuminance levels are not met, cease night operations until the required
 illuminance levels are attained.
 2.
 
 Visibility Requirements for Workers and Equipment. Ensure that workers wear a 360° high-visibility
 retroreflective orange safety garment meeting ANSI/ISEA Class 3, Level 2 standards.
 Uniformly light the hopper, auger, and screed areas of pavers as well as the operator’s controls on all
 machines.
 Conventional vehicle headlights do not meet illuminance requirements. Ensure that moving lighting
 equipment used for night operations has lights directed ahead and behind the equipment.
 Equip moving equipment with 2-inch wide, alternating red and white, conspicuity tape meeting the National
 Highway Transportation Safety Administration standards. Equip off-road equipment with conspicuity tape
 along the full length of all 4 sides. Equip on-road vehicles, including trailers and trailer-mounted devices,
 with conspicuity tape along the full length of both sides, excluding the cab, and across the rear of the vehicle.
 
 Prevent or minimize glare that may interfere with traffic or disturb local residents. Perform glare control to the RE’s
 satisfaction. Glare control may require relocating, aiming, or adjusting lights or providing screens, shields, visors or
 louvers on lights.
 108.07 TRAFFIC CONTROL
 108.07.01 Interference
 Do not occupy a lane, shoulder, median, or sidewalk area adjacent to traffic with equipment, material, personnel, or
 employee vehicles without the RE’s approval.
 Schedule and perform the Work so that successive construction operations and lane or roadway openings follow
 preceding operations as closely as possible. Confine construction operations adjacent to traffic to one side of the
 roadway at a time unless otherwise specified by the Contract. Where the Work is performed in stages adjacent to traffic,
 ensure that the road opened to traffic adequately accommodates traffic. Do not interfere with existing traffic access,
 except when required to perform the Work or as approved by the RE.
 Do not work above vehicular or pedestrian traffic, except as specified in the Contract. Where construction interferes
 with existing pedestrian access, provide temporary pedestrian access as directed by the RE. Where necessary, install and
 maintain temporary sidewalks and curb ramps. Remove temporary access measures when no longer required.
 Provide temporary approaches to maintain traffic access to private and public property as directed by the RE. When the
 work interferes with property owners’ normal passage, provide written notice to the RE and the property owners at least
 3 days before beginning work.
 The RE has the right to reject or rescind approval of lane or shoulder closures because of the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 Weather conditions.
 The closure is unnecessary to perform the work.
 Emergency conditions either on or off the Project that result in an unacceptable impact to the traveling public.
 
 The Department will only make payment for delays or costs arising from the RE’s rejecting or rescinding of lane or
 shoulder closure resulting from emergency conditions.
 If the Work is stopped for more than 7 days or if the Work is suspended, restore excavated areas within or adjacent to the
 traveled way as directed by the RE.
 108.07.02 Changes to the Traffic Control Plan (TCP)
 Submit requests for changes to the TCP to the RE for approval at least 40 days before the change is needed. Include a
 written description of the requested TCP change and detailed plan sheets signed and sealed by a Professional Engineer.
 When proposing detours, include a copy of the signed agreement with the local government authority having jurisdiction.
 The signed agreement shall document the local government authority’s approval of the proposed detour and indicate that
 the Contractor is solely responsible for the maintenance and restoration of the roadway.
 
 53
 
 The Department will not make payment for furnishing, installing, or maintaining additional traffic control devices.
 Remove traffic control devices when no longer required. If detours were used, restore the roadway to its original
 condition or as required by the agreement with the local government. The Department will not make payment for costs
 to restore the roadway.
 108.08 LANE OCCUPANCY CHARGES
 The lane closure schedule is the time period for allowable lane closures as specified in the Contract. If the Contractor’s
 lane closures exceed these time periods, the Department will deduct from the monthly estimate a lane occupancy charge
 for the use and occupancy of each such lane or lanes beyond the permitted lane closure schedule until such time that the
 lane or lanes are reopened to traffic or until such time that the lane closure is allowed to take place again under the lane
 closure schedule.
 The RE will keep record of each occurrence as well as the cumulative amount of time that a lane is kept closed beyond
 the lane closure schedule and provide the record to the Contractor. The Department will calculate the lane occupancy
 charge by multiplying the length of time of the delayed opening, in minutes, by the rate of $10 per minute per lane. The
 total amount per day for the lane occupancy charge that the Department will collect will not exceed $10,000.00.
 The Department will waive the lane occupancy charge where a lane or lanes are not re-opened as specified in the lane
 closure schedule directly and solely by reason of extraordinary, exigent circumstances not under the control of or
 reasonably foreseeable by the Contractor. Equipment breakdowns, supplier deliveries, and weather related hindrances
 are not extraordinary, exigent circumstances. However, the Department has the right to assess a lane occupancy charge
 for any period of time that a lane or lanes are closed beyond the reasonable period of time needed by the Contractor to
 open the lane or lanes closed due to an extraordinary, exigent circumstance.
 108.09 MAINTENANCE WITHIN THE PROJECT LIMITS
 Continuously perform maintenance requirements within the Project Limits until Acceptance. The Project Limits to be
 maintained include the limits of all temporary and permanent construction, excluding those sections of highways, streets,
 and roads where only signs are placed. Maintenance includes but is not limited to the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5
 
 Picking up and disposing of trash and debris, including trash and debris not generated by the Contractor.
 However, the Contractor is not responsible for the disposal of dead animals.
 Keeping the roadway clear of dust, soil, and cleaning up non-hazardous spills.
 Maintaining a safe and unobstructed passageway through the construction area for public traffic, including but
 not limited to constructing escape ramps at the edges of pavement.
 Maintaining surface drainage, including the removal of debris, ice, and snow around inlets, to ensure that it is
 functioning as intended.
 Removal of ice and snow from bridge sidewalks open to pedestrian access.
 
 Provide for maintenance and repairs beyond the Project Limits for reasonable continuance to restore the required
 functional operation of any systems that are impacted within the Project Limits such as drainage, utilities, and electrical.
 The Contractor is not responsible for removal of ice and snow from sections of the roadway opened to traffic. For
 critical safety repairs, the Department has the right to complete the necessary repairs if the Contractor has not responded
 to the RE’s notice to complete the repairs in the time frames given in the notice. The Department will recover costs
 incurred for having to make such repairs from the Contractor.
 If the Contractor at any time fails to fully perform maintenance, the RE will immediately notify the Contractor of the
 noncompliance, and direct a time by which the Contractor must perform the maintenance. If the Contractor fails to
 remediate unsatisfactory maintenance within the time directed by the RE after receipt of such notice, the Department has
 the right to proceed to maintain the Project and recover costs incurred for this maintenance from the Contractor.
 108.10 CONTRACT TIME
 Time is of the essence as to all time frames stated in the Contract. Complete the work required for Interim Completion
 and Completion requirement as specified in the Special Provisions.
 When Contract Time is specified in working days, the RE will provide the Contractor with a weekly statement showing
 the number of days charged to the Contract for the preceding week and the number of days of Contract Time remaining.
 If the Contractor has dismissed its crew due to unfavorable conditions that affect the controlling operations on a day
 54
 
 where the contractor was prepared to begin work at the regular starting time of a scheduled shift, the Department will not
 charge a Working Day to the Contract.
 108.11 MODIFICATIONS TO CONTRACT TIME
 108.11.01 Extensions to Contract Time
 A.
 
 Qualifications for Extensions. The Department will only extend Contract Time if an excusable delay, as specified
 in 108.11.01.B.2 or 108.11.01.B.3, delays work on the critical path beyond the Contract Time as specified in
 108.10 using the approved progress schedule that is current at the time the delay occurred.
 The Department will not extend Contract Time due to Extra Work or other type of delay unless an approved
 progress schedule and updates are current as specified in 153.03. The Department will not make payment for delay
 damages, as specified in 104.03.09, unless an approved progress schedule and updates are current as specified in
 153.03.
 The Department will not extend Contract Time for failure of the RE to furnish interpretations of the Contract unless
 such request for an interpretation of the Contract is reasonable and made in good faith, and was provided more than
 5 days after the written request was received by the RE and the failure to respond within this 5-day period was
 unwarranted.
 The Department will not extend Contract Time for a delay that was or should have been anticipated by the
 Contractor at the time the Contract was awarded.
 
 B.
 
 Types of Delays. The Department recognizes the following types of delays:
 1.
 
 Non-Excusable Delays. Non-excusable delays are delays that are the Contractor’s fault or responsibility.
 The Department will not extend Contract Time or make payment for delay costs incurred due to nonexcusable delays.
 
 2.
 
 Excusable, Non-Compensable Delays. Excusable, non-compensable delays are delays that are not the
 Contractor’s or the Department’s fault or responsibility. The Department will extend Contract Time but will
 not make payment for the delay costs incurred by the Contractor for the following excusable, noncompensable delays:
 a.
 
 Others. Delays caused by work done by Others, excluding the Department.
 
 b.
 
 Utilities. Delays caused by Utilities, excluding the Department, when the actual duration to complete
 the utility work is more than 30 percent greater than the estimated duration specified in 105.07.02. The
 duration includes both the advance notice and the completion of the work by the Utility.
 
 c.
 
 Extreme Weather. The Department will only extend Contract Time for weather if the Contractor
 cannot perform work on the controlling activity on the critical path due to weather and the cumulative
 delay due to weather each month exceeds the number of days specified in Table 108.11.01-1. The work
 on the controlling activity on the critical path is considered delayed if the Contractor is prevented from
 proceeding on such activity for at least 60 percent of the total daily time planned for the activity for all
 shifts scheduled for that day. Submit daily documentation, as specified in 108.03, for activities that are
 delayed by weather.

 For leap years, the number of days restricted is 29.
 
 d.
 
 Cataclysmic Natural Phenomena. Delays caused by lightning strikes, wild fires, floods, tidal waves,
 earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, or other cataclysmic phenomena.
 
 e.
 
 Sovereign Acts of the State. Delays caused by the State in its sovereign capacity, including but not
 limited to epidemic or quarantine restrictions, states of emergency, and State shutdowns.
 
 f.
 
 War and Unrest. Delays due to war or civil disturbances.
 
 g.
 
 Labor Disputes. Delays due to strikes or labor disputes beyond the control of the Contractor.
 
 h.
 
 Shortage of Materials. Extraordinary delays in material deliveries that the Contractor or suppliers
 cannot foresee or forestall resulting from freight embargos, government acts, or area wide material
 shortages. Shortage of materials applies only to raw and fabricated materials, articles, parts, or
 equipment that are standard and does not apply to materials, parts, articles, or equipment that are
 processed, made, constructed, fabricated, or manufactured to meet the specific requirements of the
 Contract. The Department will only consider the physical unavailability of the material as constituting a
 shortage, and shall not consider cost factors as constituting a shortage. Provide documented proof that
 every effort to obtain the materials from all known sources within a reasonable distance from the Project
 Limits was made. Also provide proof that the inability to obtain such materials when originally planned,
 could not be remedied by revising the sequence of the construction operations.
 
 If approved excusable, non-compensable delays exceed a total of 180 days, the time in excess of 180 days will
 become excusable and compensable as specified in 108.11.01.B.3.
 
 C.
 
 3.
 
 Excusable, Compensable Delays. Excusable, compensable delays are delays that are the Department’s fault
 or responsibility. For excusable, compensable delays, the Department will grant an extension of Contract
 Time and will make payment for delay damages as specified in 104.03.09.
 
 4.
 
 Concurrent Delays. Concurrent delays are separate delays on the critical path that occur at the same time.
 When an excusable, non-compensable delay is concurrent with an excusable, compensable delay, the
 Department will grant an extension of Contract Time but will not make payment for delay damages as
 specified in 104.03.09. When a non-excusable delay is concurrent with an excusable delay, the Department
 will not grant an extension of Contract Time or make payment for delay damages.
 
 Submitting Time Impact Evaluation. If an excusable delay occurs, notify the RE, as specified in 104.03.04,
 detailing how the event or cause is affecting the approved progress schedule that is current at the time the delay
 occurred. When the full extent of the impact on the approved progress schedule can be determined, submit a
 request for an extension of Contract Time to the RE with a Time Impact Evaluation Form and a CPM fragnet
 diagram including all additional work, and the fragnet’s relationship to the approved progress schedule that is
 
 56
 
 current at the time the delay occurred. Clearly identify how each change or delay is represented by an activity or
 group of activities. Ensure that the fragnet shows logic revisions, duration changes, and new activities, including
 the predecessor and successor relationships.
 The Contractor is considered to have waived its rights to claim an extension of Contract Time, if the Contractor
 fails to provide written notice as specified in 104.03.04 or fails to provide the time impact evaluation.
 The RE will evaluate the time impact evaluation. The Department will only extend Contract Time when delay
 causes the work to be extended beyond the scheduled Contract Time as specified in 108.10. If the Contractor is
 already behind schedule and an excusable delay delays the work beyond the Contract Time as specified in 108.10,
 the Department will only extend Contract Time for the amount of time that directly results from the excusable
 delay. If the Department determines that an extension of Contract Time is warranted, the Department will extend
 Contract Time by a Change Order.
 For excusable, compensable delays, submit a request for and documentation supporting the entitlement to
 compensable delay damages associated with the delay as specified in and limited by 104.03.09.
 108.11.02 Reductions to Contract Time
 If the Work required is reduced or altered such that less time is needed to meet Contract Time, the Department has the
 right to reduce Contract Time by analyzing the current approved progress schedule.
 108.12 RIGHT-OF-WAY RESTRICTIONS
 The Special Provisions will indicate ROW that has not been secured and the anticipated dates of availability. Review the
 ROW Plans and obtain from the RE all other information regarding ROW parcels, easements, temporary easements, and
 temporary access to parcels acquired for the Project as well as the nature and type of title acquired.
 Temporary easements and temporary access to parcels will in most cases contain a limitation as to the length of time that
 they are in force and effect. Schedule the Work, as specified in 153.03, to accommodate the time limitations associated
 with each parcel.
 Provide written notice to the RE at least 30 days before entering a parcel with a temporary easement or entering a parcel
 with temporary access. Do not enter a parcel until the RE provides written notice to the property owner.
 If the Contractor needs to occupy a temporary easement or parcel beyond the time period provided by the temporary
 easement or access, provide a written request to the RE at least 15 days before the time period expires. Do not enter or
 continue to occupy the easement or parcel unless approved by the RE.
 108.13 SUSPENSION OF WORK
 The RE has the right to suspend the Work, wholly or in part, for such period as deemed necessary for the following:
 1.
 
 Contractor Fault. Contractor fault includes but is not limited to: failure to carry out Contract requirements;
 failure to correct unsafe conditions; or, failure to carry out the directions of the RE.
 
 2.
 
 Unsuitable Weather. Unsuitable weather is a weather condition that prevents the Contractor from
 performing work as specified in the Contract. The RE also has the right to suspend work for a potential
 weather condition.
 
 3.
 
 Convenience of the Department. For the convenience of the Department, the RE may direct, in writing, the
 Contractor to suspend all or any portion of the Work for the period of time that the RE determines to be
 appropriate.
 
 If the RE suspends a portion of the Work, Contract requirements governing work on continuing portions of the Project
 remain in effect. When the RE suspends the Work or portions of the Work, the Contractor is still responsible for the
 following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 Maintaining the Project Limits as specified in 108.09.
 Maintaining SESC measures as specified in 158.03.02.
 Maintaining traffic control devices as specified in 159.03.
 Protecting the work already performed, and preventing damage and deterioration.
 
 57
 
 5.
 6.
 
 Protecting stored materials.
 Complying with additional direction by the RE to secure the Project Limits and safeguard the public.
 
 If, during suspension, the Contractor at any time fails to comply with items 1 to 6 above, the RE will immediately notify
 the Contractor of the noncompliance. If the Contractor fails to remediate unsatisfactory conditions within 24 hours after
 receipt of such notice or within the time otherwise specified, the Department has the right to remediate the unsatisfactory
 conditions and recover the cost of this remediation from the Contractor.
 Resume work when directed by the RE. Within 7 days of receiving notice to resume work, provide the RE a written
 request for payment for the costs and for a modification of Contract Time for the number of days sought resulting from
 the suspension.
 108.14 DEFAULT AND TERMINATION OF CONTRACTOR’S RIGHT TO PROCEED
 The Department will provide written notice to the Contractor and the Surety of the cause for default, and demand
 elimination of such cause for default, if the Contractor does any of the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 6.

 opportunity requirements.
 Is a party to fraud.
 For any other cause whatsoever, fails to carry out the Work in an acceptable manner.
 
 If the Contractor or Surety, within a period of 10 days after such notice, does not proceed as specified in the notice, then
 the Department has full power and authority, without violating the Contract, to declare the Contractor in default and
 notify the Contractor to discontinue the Work. The Department will provide, in writing, the declaration of default to the
 Contractor and Surety. The Department has the right to appropriate any or all materials and equipment within the Project
 Limits to complete the Contract. The Department has the right to direct the Surety to complete the Contract or may enter
 into an agreement for the completion of the Contract with the Surety or another contractor, or use such other methods
 required for the completion of the Contract, including completion of the Work by the Department.
 The Contractor and Surety are not relieved of the assessment of liquidated damages, as specified in 108.20, because of
 the Contractor’s default.
 The Department will recover the costs and charges incurred by the Department, together with the cost of completing the
 Work from the Contractor or Surety.
 The rights and remedies of the Department are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under the
 Contract and the bonds.
 If, after declaration of default, the Department determines for any reason that the Contractor was not in default or that the
 delay was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties are the same as if the Department had issued an order of
 termination for convenience as specified in 108.15.01.
 If, after declaration of default, a court determines for any reason that the Department’s default of the Contract was
 legally improper, the rights and obligations of the parties are the same as if the Department had issued an order of
 termination for convenience as specified in 108.15.01.
 
 58
 
 108.15 TERMINATION OF CONTRACT
 108.15.01 For Convenience
 The Department has the right to, by written order, terminate the Contract for convenience.
 Upon receipt of an order of termination for convenience, only perform the work required in the order of termination.
 The Department may add work in order to secure the Project. Perform the work required in the order of termination as
 specified in the Contract. The Department has the right to declare the Contractor in default, as specified in 108.14, if the
 Contractor fails to carry out the conditions set forth in an order of termination for convenience.
 When the Department orders termination for convenience, the Department will make payment for the Items completed as
 of the date of termination at the Contract price. The Department will make payment for the work in the order of
 termination, including work that was not in the Contract.
 108.15.02 For Cause
 The Department has the right to, by written order, terminate the Contract for cause after determining the Contractor has
 been declared in default as specified in 108.14.
 Upon receipt of an order of termination for cause, only perform the work required in of the order of termination. The
 Department may add work in order to secure the Project. Perform the work required in the order of termination as

 the Department will recover the costs and charges incurred by the Department, together with the cost of completing the
 Work from the Contractor or Surety.
 The rights and remedies of the Department are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under the
 Contract and the bonds.
 When the Department orders termination for cause, the Department will make payment for the Items completed as of the
 date of termination at the Contract price. The Department will make payment for the work in the order of termination
 including work that was not in the original Contract.
 The Department will not make payment for profit and overhead not included in the Contract price for Items for work
 completed or partially completed except that the Department may make payment for profit and overhead on force
 account work as specified in 104.03.08.
 If the Department’s termination for cause is found by a court to be legally improper, the Department will rescind the
 termination for cause and order a termination for convenience. The Department will then make payment as if the
 termination for cause had been a termination for convenience as specified in 108.15.01.
 108.16 PARTIAL ACCEPTANCE
 If the Contractor completes a portion of the Work, the Contractor may request that the RE inspect that portion. If the RE
 finds that the portion has been completed, as specified in the Contract, the Department may accept that portion as being
 completed. If the portion is accepted, the Department may relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of maintaining that
 portion of the Work as specified in 108.09. The RE may reject the request made by the Contractor if the RE determines
 that the portion of the Project should not be subject to partial acceptance.
 108.17 INTERIM COMPLETION
 When an Interim Completion requirement is specified, notify the RE in writing when the work for the milestone is
 complete. If the RE determines that the work for the milestone appears to be complete, the RE will notify the
 Contractor. If the RE determines that the work for the milestone has not been completed, the RE will give the Contractor
 the necessary instructions to correct or complete the Work to meet the Interim Completion requirement. Notify the RE
 upon compliance with the RE’s instructions. Repeat this procedure until the RE determines that the work for a milestone
 has been completed.
 
 59
 
 108.18 SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION
 Notify the RE, in writing, when the Work is substantially complete. When the RE receives written notice, the
 Department will perform an inspection. If the inspection indicates that the Work is not substantially completed to the
 Department’s satisfaction, the RE will respond within 14 days and provide the Contractor the necessary instructions for
 completion and correction. Upon completion and correction of the Work, the Contractor shall renotify the RE that the
 Work is substantially complete, and the RE will perform another inspection. Repeat this procedure until the Department
 determines that the Work is substantially complete.
 The date of the Contractor’s acceptable notice is the date of Substantial Completion.
 108.19 COMPLETION AND ACCEPTANCE
 Notify the RE, in writing, when the Work is complete. When the RE receives written notice, the Department will
 perform an inspection. If the Department determines that the Work is complete, the Department will issue a Certificate
 of Completion.
 If the Department determines that the Work is not complete, the RE will respond within 30 days and provide the
 Contractor with the necessary instructions for completion and correction. Complete the Work and renotify the RE.
 Repeat this procedure until the Department issues a Certificate of Completion.
 The date of the Contractor’s acceptable notice is the date of Completion.
 The Department will notify the Contractor of the date of Acceptance. After Acceptance, the Contractor is relieved of the
 duty of maintaining and protecting the Project. In addition, the Contractor is relieved of its responsibility for damage to
 the Work that may occur after Acceptance.
 The Contractor, without prejudice to the terms of the Contract, is liable to the Department at any time, both before and
 after Acceptance, for latent defects, fraud, such gross mistakes as may amount to fraud, or actions affecting the
 Department’s rights under any warranty or guarantee.
 108.20 LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
 The Contractor and the Department recognize that delays to Contract Time result in damages to the Department
 including the effect of the delay on the use of the Project, public convenience and economic development of the State,
 and additional costs to the Department for engineering, inspection, and administration of the Contract. Because it is
 difficult or impossible to accurately estimate the damages incurred, the parties agree that if the Contractor fails to
 complete the Contract or portion of the Contract within the Contract Time, the Contractor shall pay the Department the
 liquidated damages specified in the Special Provisions.
 The Department will assess liquidated damages for each and every day that the Contractor has failed to complete the
 Work or portion of the Work within the Contract Time requirements as specified in 108.10. If the Department discovers
 that the work required to meet an Interim Completion requirement is unacceptable after the RE notified the Contractor
 that the work appeared to be complete, the Department has the right to assess liquidated damages for the time period
 required to correct the unacceptable work.
 108.21 WARRANTIES
 Enforce all subcontractors’, manufacturers’, fabricators’, and suppliers’ warranties, express or implied, respecting any
 work or materials, at the direction of the RE, for the benefit of the Department. Obtain the warranties that
 subcontractors, manufacturers, fabricators, and suppliers would give in normal commercial practice. If directed, require
 the warranty to be executed in writing to the Department. The RE has the right to direct the Contractor to undertake
 litigation to enforce a warranty.

 SECTION 109 – MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 109.01 MEASUREMENT OF QUANTITIES
 The Department will use the United States customary units to measure work completed under the contract. The
 Department will determine quantities of Work performed under the Contract using measurement methods and
 computations conforming to good engineering practice.
 The Department will designate Items as Measured Items or as Proposal Items by having a suffix of P or M in the Item
 number respectively. The Department will measure quantities of Measured Items for payment.
 For measured quantities, the Department will measure to the significant figure as specified in Table 109.01-1.
 Table 109.01-1
 Item Price
 
 Significant Figure
 
 <$50.00
 $50.00 to $500.00
 >$500.00
 
 1
 0.1
 .01
 
 For measured quantities that are measured by area, and where areas contain fixtures that are not part of the Item, the RE
 will only deduct the areas of individual fixtures having an area of greater than nine square feet.
 For measured quantities that are measured by volume, the Department will calculate volumes using the end area method.
 For measured quantities that are measured by weight, the Department will calculate weight using the net certified weight
 tickets corrected for any loss or waste.
 Whenever the phrase “Contract quantity” is used in this Subsection, it is the quantity in the Proposal adjusted by Change
 Orders.
 The Department will not measure quantities for Proposal Items, except quantities designated on the Plans as “if and
 where directed,” for payment except at the request of the Contractor or the RE. If making a request, submit drawings,
 calculations, and other information demonstrating the as-built quantity. If the difference between the measured quantity
 and the Contract quantity is less than or equal to 10 percent of the Proposal quantity, the Department will make payment
 based on the Contract quantity. If the difference is more than 10 percent of the Contract quantity, the Department will
 make payment based on the measured quantity. For each Item that the Contractor requests a Proposal item be measured,
 and it is determined that the difference between the quantity measured and the Contract quantity is less than or equal to
 10 percent of the Proposal quantity, the Department will deduct $500. The Department will measure quantities for
 Proposal Items that are designated on the plans as “if and where directed” for payment when the RE directs work using
 the “if and where directed” quantity.
 109.02 SCOPE OF PAYMENT
 The Department will make payment for the elements of work described under the “Construction” or “Procedure”
 subsection under the corresponding Item in the “Measurement and Payment” Subsection. The Items included under the
 “Measurement and Payment” Subsection are full payment for the materials described under the “Materials” Subsection
 and the work described under the corresponding “Construction” or “Procedure” Subsection. The Department will not
 make additional or separate payment for work or portion of work unless specifically provided for in the “Method and
 Measurement” Subsection. For Items subject to payment modification based on quality requirements, the Department
 will make the payment modification as specified.

 109.05 ESTIMATES
 The Department will make monthly payments to the Contractor for work performed and for materials delivered, as
 specified in 109.06. The RE will calculate the payment in an Estimate consistent with the provisions of the Contract. If
 not otherwise described in the Contract, the RE will be the sole judge of the amount of progress payment due for
 partially completed work. The quantities provided in the Estimate may be approximations and may not be based on asbuilt quantity measurements. The Department will establish the date of the month that the Estimate is processed.
 
 62
 
 The RE will provide a summary of the Estimate to the Contractor. Before the issuance of each payment, certify, on
 forms provided by the Department, that:
 1.
 2.
 
 Each subcontractor or supplier has been paid the amount due from the previous progress payment and shall be
 paid the amount due from the current progress payment and no retainage is being withheld from any
 subcontractor on Federally funded projects; or
 There exists a valid basis under the terms of the subcontractor’s or supplier’s contract to withhold payment
 from the subcontractor or supplier, and therefore payment is withheld.
 
 If the certification indicates that the Contractor has withheld or will withhold payment from a subcontractor or supplier,
 provide written notice, according to N.J.S.A. 52:32-40 and N.J.S.A. 52:32-41, of such non-payment to the subcontractor
 or supplier. Provide a copy of the notice to the Department and to the Surety that holds the performance bond. Include
 the reason for withholding payment and state the amount of payment withheld in the notice.
 The date that the Department receives the certification will initiate the 20-day approval period under N.J.S.A. 2A:30A-1,
 et seq. The Department will not accept the certification before being requested by the RE.
 If no valid basis exists for withholding payment, N.J.S.A. 52:32-40 and N.J.S.A. 52:32-41 authorize any subcontractor or
 supplier from whom payment is withheld to receive from the Contractor, in addition to any amount due, interest at a rate
 equal to the prime rate plus one percent if the subcontractor or supplier is not paid within 10 days after receipt by the
 Contractor of payment by the Department for completed work that is the subject of a subcontract or a material supply
 agreement. This interest begins to accrue on the tenth day after receipt of payment by the Contractor.
 If court action is taken by a subcontractor or supplier to collect payments withheld by a Contractor and it is determined
 that a valid basis existed for the withholding of those payments, the subcontractor or supplier shall be liable for any court
 costs incurred by the Contractor in connection with the action.
 The Department will not make payment for an Estimate having a value less than $5000, unless it is for the Final
 Certificate.
 From the total Estimate amount, excluding amounts for subcontracted work on Federally funded projects, the
 Department will deduct and retain 2 percent until Substantial Completion.
 In the first Estimate following Substantial Completion, the Department will reduce the retainage withheld to one percent
 of the total adjusted Contract price, excluding subcontracted work on Federally funded projects, unless it has been
 determined by the Department that the withholding of additional retainage is required. If retainage is held in cash
 withholdings, the reduction is to be accomplished by payment under the next Estimate. If retainage is held in bonds, the
 Department will authorize a reduction in the escrow account.
 The RE has the right to not process an Estimate when, in the judgment of the RE, the work is not performed or
 proceeding as specified in the Contract or following the Department giving the Contractor and Surety notice of default as
 specified in 108.14.
 The Department’s processing or payment of an Estimate is not an approval of defective or improper work. The
 Department, upon determining that any payment under a previous Estimate was improper or unwarranted for any reason,
 has the right to recover erroneous payment from the Contractor.
 109.06 MATERIALS PAYMENTS AND STORAGE
 The Contractor may request payment for the cost of materials, including the storage cost, not incorporated into the Work.
 If approved by the RE, the Department will make payment for the cost of materials, including storage costs; however, the
 amount of payment may not exceed 85 percent of the bid price for the associated Item. The Department will not make
 payment for such materials until the RE is satisfied that:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 The Contractor has properly stored and protected materials within the Project Limits or at locations owned or
 leased by the Contractor or the Department within the State, except that the Contractor may store structural
 steel outside the State with the prior approval of the Department.
 The ME has inspected the materials and they appear to be acceptable based upon available supplier’s
 certification and materials test reports.
 The Contractor has provided the RE with the paid invoice or paid bill of sale for the materials and a fully
 executed Release of Liens for Materials Stored for Incorporation in Department of Transportation Project
 Form, including the transfer of ownership to the Department.
 
 63
 
 4.
 
 5.
 
 For material stored on property not belonging to the Department, the material is stored in a fenced area with
 access limited to the Department and the Contractor. Additionally, the Contractor has posted a sign at the
 location clearly identifying, and printed in large letters, that the materials are without encumbrances and are to
 be solely used for the Project.
 When materials are stored in a leased area, the lease is made out to the Contractor and provides that it shall be
 canceled only with the written permission of the Department. Submit a copy of the lease to the RE.
 
 Payment for materials does not constitute Department approval or Acceptance of the materials or work. If materials paid
 for are damaged, stolen, or prove to be unacceptable, the Department has the right to recover the costs from the
 Contractor. The Department will not make payment for plant materials until they are planted or installed.
 109.07 BONDS POSTED IN LIEU OF RETAINAGES
 The Contractor may deposit negotiable bonds of the State or any of its political subdivisions, which have been approved
 by the Department, in an escrow account to secure release of all or a portion of the retainage withheld as specified in
 109.05. Establish the account under the provisions of an escrow agreement to be entered into between the Contractor,
 the Department, and a bank located in the State that is an authorized depository and with a trust department. Pay the
 charges of the bank for services rendered according to the terms and conditions of the escrow agreement.
 The Contractor may obtain agreement forms and a list of approved bonds from the Department. Obtain bonds that have
 a rating of at least “B A A” by Moody’s Investor Service or “B B B” by Standard and Poors Corporation.
 If the market value of the bonds on deposit in the escrow account falls below the amount of retainage required by the
 Contract, deposit additional bonds of sufficient value in the escrow account to secure the release of retainage, or the
 Department will deduct from current payments amounts sufficient to ensure that the total bond value on deposit plus
 retainage withheld will equal the total retainage requirement for the Contract.
 Ensure that the bonds deposited in the escrow account remain acceptable to the Department. If the Contractor does not
 replace unacceptable bonds with acceptable bonds, the Department will withhold from future payments amounts equal to
 the amount of retainage, the release of which was based upon the value of the now unacceptable bonds.
 In the event of a declaration of default or an Order of Termination of the Contract, the Department will notify the bank in
 writing of the declaration of default or the Order of Termination. Following said written notification, the bank shall not
 dispose of, release, or compromise any bonds or the proceeds of called or mature bonds, without written instructions
 from the Department. If directed by the Department, the bank shall sell any bonds in the escrow account and pay the
 proceeds of such sale or the proceeds held in the account from called or matured bonds to the Department or to any
 payee designated by the Department. The Department will send a copy of the instructions to sell to the Contractor.
 109.08 AS-BUILT QUANTITIES
 Following Substantial Completion, the RE will finalize as-built quantities for all Items and provide a list to the
 Contractor for review. Accept or reject the proposed as-built quantities within 20 days of receipt. If rejecting, submit
 the disputed quantities and supporting calculations with a notice of rejection. The RE will review supporting
 calculations within 20 days, and will accept or reject, in part or in whole, the disputed as-built quantities.
 If the Contractor fails to respond or fails to provide supporting calculations with a notice of rejection within the 20-day
 period, the Department will deem the Contractor to have accepted the proposed as-built quantities and will deem the
 Contractor to have waived any claim regarding the proposed as-built quantities.
 109.09 AUDITS
 All claims filed and force account work are subject to audit at any time following the filing, whether or not part of a suit
 pending in the courts of this State pursuant to N.J.S.A. 59:13-1, et seq. The audit may begin after the Department has
 given 15-day notice to the Contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. If an audit is to be commenced more than 60 days after
 Acceptance, the Department will provide the Contractor with reasonable notice of the time when such audit is to begin.
 Provide adequate facilities that are acceptable to the Department for such audit during normal business hours. Make a
 good faith effort to cooperate with the auditors. Failure to retain and maintain sufficient records to allow the
 Department’s auditor to verify a claim submitted by the Contractor, subcontractor, or supplier constitutes a waiver of
 such claim and bars any recovery; if the Department has already made payment, the Contractor shall refund to the
 Department the amount so disallowed.

 Where payment for materials or labor is based on the cost thereof to forces other than the Contractor, the Contractor shall
 ensure that the cost records of such other forces are open to inspection and audit by the Department on the same terms
 and conditions as the records of the Contractor.
 109.10 CONTRACTOR’S COMPLIANCE WITH N.J.S.A. 34:11-56.25, ET SEQ.
 Provide the RE with a written statement on a form provided by the Department certifying that all employees employed
 by the Contractor or by any subcontractor have been paid wages not less than those required by the Contract in
 compliance with N.J.S.A. 34:11-56.25, et seq.
 109.11 FINAL PAYMENT AND CLAIMS
 The Final Certificate may result in either a Final Payment to the Contractor or a credit (payment) due the Department.

 the Proposed Final Certificate to the Contractor.
 Within 30 days after receiving this Proposed Final Certificate, submit a release or conditional release to the Department
 on a payment voucher provided by the Department. If the Contractor has no reservation of claims and accepts the
 Proposed Final Certificate, provide a written release stating the following:
 In consideration of the above payment, I hereby release the State of New Jersey, Commissioner of
 Transportation, the Department, their agents, officers, and employees from all claims and liability of
 whatsoever nature for anything done or furnished or in any manner growing out of the performance of
 the Work.
 
 65
 
 If the Contractor has a reservation of specific claims, but otherwise has released all claims not specifically reserved and
 accepts the Proposed Final Certificate, state the following:

 Transportation, the Department, their agents, officers, and employees from all claims and liability of
 whatsoever nature for anything done or furnished in any manner growing out of the performance for
 the Work except for____________________.
 Include in the release the specific monetary amounts and the specific nature of the claims being reserved. Failure to state
 specific monetary amounts and the specific nature of the claim shall result in a waiver of such claims. The Contractor
 may reserve only those claims properly filed with the Department as specified in 107.12 and not previously resolved. If
 the Contractor reserves claims, proceed as specified in 107.12. The Contractor waives all claims for which the required
 notice has not been filed with the Department.
 The Contractor’s failure to submit written release or conditional release within said 30 days constitutes acceptance of the
 Proposed Final Certificate without exception and a wavier of all claims.

 release, or when the Contractor fails to provide written acceptance of the Proposed Final Certificate within 30 days of
 issuance, the Department will pay the entire sum due there under as provided by the N.J.S.A. 52:32-32, et seq., provided
 the Final Certificate indicates a payment is due the Contractor. However, where the Final Certificate indicates a credit
 (payment) is due the Department, the Contractor shall remit said credit (payment) to the Department.
 If the Contractor fails to remit the credit due the Department, as indicated on the Proposed Final Certificate, within 30
 days of issuance of the Proposed Final Certificate, the Department has the right to recover the credit from the Contractor.
 109.12 ETHICS STANDARDS AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

 SECTION 153 – PROGRESS SCHEDULE
 153.01 DESCRIPTION
 This Section describes the requirements for providing a progress schedule to monitor Contract progress and to evaluate
 impacts on Contract Time.
 153.02 MATERIALS
 (Intentionally Blank)
 153.03 PROCEDURE
 153.03.01 CPM Progress Schedule
 Provide a detailed CPM schedule in XER format using the NJDOT Capital Program Management Construction
 Scheduling Standard Coding and Procedures for Designers and Contractors Manual, and the NJDOT Scheduling
 Template. The manual and template are available from the Department’s website.
 Determine the most feasible work sequence that meets the Contract requirements. Ensure that the schedule includes
 ROW availability dates, permits, submittals, working drawings, procurement, fabrication, delivery of materials,
 construction, and other activities necessary to complete the Work. Schedule the Work according to the staging
 requirements specified by the Contract. The Contractor may simultaneously perform work designated as part of separate
 stages where allowed by the Contract or approved by the RE.
 The Contractor may propose alternate staging. Ensure that proposed alternate staging does not interfere with work done
 by Others. The Department may reject the proposed alternate staging if it causes an increase to the cost of work done by
 Others. The Contractor is responsible for the cost of changes or additional work required as a result of completing the
 work according to the proposed alternate staging.
 If the Contractor proposes alternate staging, submit a plan detailing the proposed alternate. Submit a schedule showing
 the original staging and a schedule showing the proposed alternate staging. The RE may extend its review of the
 schedule submissions by a reasonable length of time. The Department will not grant time extensions or make payment
 for delays to construction resulting from extended review time of the proposed alternate staging by the RE, regardless of
 whether the Department accepts or rejects it. The RE may require the Contractor to submit the proposed alternate
 staging as a VE proposal as specified in 104.02.
 Ensure that the schedule submission conforms to the following:
 1.
 
 Provide 1 activity for each discrete component of each Item scheduled in the Proposal. The RE may allow
 grouping of similar Items into 1 activity. For certain Items, the RE may require the Contractor to provide
 additional detail for each component to be included in the progress schedule.
 2. Provide activity descriptions to ensure that the start, completion, and intermediate status of the Work is readily
 identifiable. Do not use nonspecific activity descriptions like “Start,” “Continue,” “Complete,” “X percent,”
 “Y percent,” “Z percent,” or similar.
 3. Use activity codes to identify responsibility, class, type, and WBS. Use area activity codes to distinguish the
 location of work, such as stationing and structure number.
 4. For each activity, indicate the calendar used. Ensure that no activity has a duration of less than 1 workday.
 5. Ensure that no construction activity has a duration greater than 30 days, unless approved by the RE.
 6. Ensure that activity logic and durations are consistent with the Contract.
 7. Ensure that all activities, except the project start milestone and project completion milestone, have
 predecessors and successors. The start of an activity shall have a start-to-start or finish-to-start relationship
 with preceding activities. The completion of an activity shall have a finish-to-start or finish-to-finish
 relationship with a succeeding activity. Do not use start-to-finish relationships.
 8. Indicate time frames when work is restricted in sensitive areas, including wetlands, floodplains, waterbodies,
 and parklands, to ensure that appropriate staging and seasonal constraints are reflected.
 9. Ensure that seasonal constraints are reflected for Items of work such as stripping, seeding, and planting.
 10. Indicate time frames when work is restricted by work performed by Utilities or by Others.
 11. Indicate time frames, as specified in 105.05, for the Department to review working drawings.
 
 72
 
 12. Identify the start and finish dates of stages with Finish Milestones.
 13. Identify the Completion and interim completion dates specified in 108.10 with Finish Milestones with a Late
 Finish Constraint.
 14. Use constraint dates only for Completion and interim completion milestones, unless approved by the RE.
 15. Calculate the CPM schedule in working days. Ensure that the working day to calendar date relationship is
 based upon the Contractors proposed work week with allowance for weekends, legal holidays and any special
 requirements of the Contract.
 16. Do not use resource loaded schedules.
 The progress schedule does not constitute notice and does not satisfy the notice requirements as specified in 104.03.04.
 Approval of the schedule by the RE does not modify the Contract or constitute Acceptance of the feasibility of the
 Contractor’s logic, activity durations, or assumptions used in creating the schedule. If the schedule reflects a completion
 date different than that specified in 108.10, this does not change the specified completion date. If the RE approves a
 schedule that reflects a completion date earlier than that specified as the Contract Time, the Department will not accept
 claims for additional Contract Time or compensation as the result of failure to complete the Work by the earlier date
 shown on the CPM schedule. Float is the amount of time that an activity may be delayed from its early start without
 delaying Completion. Float belongs to the Project and is not for the exclusive use of the Contractor or the Department.
 Submit the preliminary schedule and baseline schedule as follows:
 1.
 
 Preliminary Schedule Submission. Within 15 days after executing the Contract, submit 1 electronic copy of
 the preliminary schedule to the RE for review and approval. For contracts with a Total Contract Value of less
 than $40 million, provide the schedule for at least the first 90 days of the Project. For contracts with a Total
 Contract Value of more than $40 million, provide the schedule for at least the first 120 days of the Project.
 Provide a summary activity network for the remainder of Contract Time. Include a written narrative detailing
 the calendars, the use of multiple shifts per day, and the anticipated production rates.
 The RE may require 3 paper copies of the preliminary schedule, Gantt Chart, as specified in 153.03.02.2.e,
 and a network diagram (PERT) printed on 36 × 22-inch plans detailing the activity relationships.
 Ensure that the preliminary schedule includes milestone activities expected to be completed or partially
 completed before submission and approval of the baseline schedule.
 Do not begin construction operations until the RE approves the preliminary schedule. Allow 14 days for the
 RE to review and approve or reject and return the preliminary schedule submission. If the preliminary
 schedule submission is rejected by the RE, revise and resubmit to the RE for approval within 7 days.
 
 2.
 
 Baseline Schedule Submission. Ensure that the baseline schedule depicts the work plan for the entire
 Contract Time. Submit, as specified in Table 153.03.01-1, 1 electronic copy of the baseline schedule to the
 RE for approval. The RE may require the Contractor to submit 3 paper copies of the baseline schedule.

 and character of the proposed labor force for each operation.
 The RE may require 3 paper copies of the tabular reports, as specified in 153.03.02.2, and a printed
 network diagram (PERT) on 36 × 22-inch sheets detailing the activity relationships.
 
 73
 
 Within 14 days, the RE will review the baseline schedule and approve or reject the submission. If rejected,
 revise and resubmit the baseline schedule, within 7 days, to the RE for review and approval. The RE will
 review the revised baseline schedule submission and approve or reject the resubmission within 7 days.
 153.03.02 CPM Progress Schedule Updates
 The RE will designate the due date for the first schedule update when the baseline schedule is approved. The first update
 is due approximately 2 months following the baseline schedule approval. The RE will designate the data date to be used
 for each schedule update.
 Schedule progress review meetings to be held approximately 14 days before the schedule update due date. Prepare
 activity progress in advance of each meeting. Revise the logic to reflect the actual sequence of work. Do not submit
 schedules showing work performed out of sequence. Provide the RE with a report detailing actual start and actual finish
 dates of activities in progress during the previous 2 months. At the progress review meeting, present and review the
 progress during the previous 2 months for incorporation into the schedule.
 Within 14 days from the date of the progress review meeting, submit the schedule update to the RE for approval with the
 agreed upon changes. Within 14 days, the RE will review the update schedule and approve or reject the submission. If
 rejected, revise and resubmit the schedule update, within 14 days, to the RE for review and approval. The RE will
 review the revised schedule update submissions and approve or reject the resubmission within 14 days.
 Update and submit the subsequent schedule update even if the RE has not approved the previous schedule update.

 158.03 CONSTRUCTION
 158.03.01 Environmental Manager
 Assign a supervisory-level employee experienced in all aspects of soil erosion and sediment control, water quality
 control, and work site waste control. Submit the name and applicable experience of this employee to the RE for approval
 at least 15 days before beginning any construction operations, except construction layout, on the Project. Submit written
 notification and obtain approval from the RE before changing the environmental manager.
 The environmental manager shall have the responsibility and sufficient authority for implementing the approved SESC
 and water quality methods of operations. The environmental manager shall coordinate, oversee, and supervise SESC and
 water quality operations on the Project. This includes both on-site and off-site activities, including those involving
 subcontractors. The environmental manager shall oversee and supervise all site waste control operations for the Project.
 The environmental manager shall attend SESC and water quality meetings. The environmental manager, with the RE,
 shall inspect SESC and site waste control measures at least weekly. Perform additional inspections immediately after
 precipitation and other weather events that may damage SESC measures or cause uncontrolled erosion to occur. During
 extended periods of precipitation, perform inspections every 24 hours until the precipitation has ended. Submit original
 Environmental Compliance Check List and Inspection Form to the RE the same day that the inspection is performed.
 Perform corrective actions, if required, within 24 hours of the inspection, and resubmit the Environmental Compliance
 Check List and Inspection Form to the RE within 2 days indicating that the corrective action has been completed.
 158.03.02 SESC Measures
 Construct SESC measures, as required, before starting construction operations. With the approval of the RE, the
 Contractor may fell trees or cut other vegetation using hand methods before constructing SESC measures. Coordinate
 temporary SESC measures with the permanent measures and with other construction operations to ensure effective and
 continuous erosion and sediment control. Construct temporary SESC measures to correct unforeseen conditions that
 develop during construction. If the Contractor fails to comply with SESC or site waste control provisions, the RE will
 suspend the Work as specified in 108.13.
 Maintain SESC measures regardless of construction season or other times when the Project is closed down or suspended
 to ensure that the SESC measures function properly. Immediately correct or replace non-functioning SESC measures to
 meet the specified functionality. If the Contractor fails to maintain SESC or site waste control measures, the RE will
 suspend the Work as specified in 108.13.
 Ensure that clearing and grubbing does not interfere with the construction of permanent SESC measures or other
 operations. When unstabilized areas caused by site development, grading, or other soil disturbing activities exist beyond
 14 days, seed and mulch the disturbed areas. The RE may limit the size of unstabilized areas due to clearing, grubbing,
 grading, or other soil disturbing activities based on site conditions and the Contractor’s ability to install and maintain
 SESC measures. Upon completion of soil disturbing activities, permanently stabilize disturbed areas within 7 days as
 specified in 807.03.01. If seasonal limitations preclude permanent stabilization, provide temporary SESC measures as
 approved by the RE.
 When excavation or embankment construction reaches the finished subgrade, areas where pavement is to be placed are
 exempt from the above stabilization requirements. Roadways and haul roads actively used for daily conveyance of
 equipment, as well as areas between temporary berms, except median areas, are also exempt.
 Employ construction methods to minimize airborne dust and prevent soils and other materials from being deposited on
 existing roadways. Apply water or other RE approved materials to unpaved areas to control dust caused by hauling or
 other construction operations. Reuse, as specified in 202.03.07.A, dirt and other materials that have been spilled,
 washed, or tracked onto existing roadways by hauling or other construction operations.
 Remove temporary SESC measures when necessary to allow for the installation of permanent measures, or as permanent
 measures become functional. Notify the RE 10 days before removing temporary SESC measures. Between Substantial
 Completion and Completion, remove temporary SESC measures unless the RE directs that specific Items remain in
 place.
 
 87
 
 Construct SESC measures as follows:
 1.
 
 Caution Fence. Install caution fence at locations shown on the plans to delineate wetlands and other
 environmentally sensitive areas. Space posts at least every 10 feet.
 
 2.
 
 Silt Fence. Install silt fence with geotextile buried securely in the existing soil. Join sections of the geotextile
 so that they work effectively as a continuous fence. The Contractor may install haybales instead of silt fence
 when approved by the RE.
 
 3.
 
 Heavy-Duty Silt Fence. Install heavy-duty silt fence with geotextile securely buried in the existing soil. Join
 sections of the geotextile so that they work effectively as a continuous fence. Install fence posts at a slight
 angle toward the anticipated runoff source. Install the color of heavy-duty silt fence in locations as shown in
 the Plans. Do not substitute orange for black or black for orange.
 
 4.
 
 Haybale. Embed haybales in the ground and place end to end to form a continuous line without gaps.
 Anchor haybales in place with wood stakes.
 
 5.
 
 Haybale Check Dams With Temporary Stone Outlets. Embed haybales into the ground and anchor in
 place with wood stakes. Place temporary riprap in the center of each flow line. Place temporary No. 2 coarse
 aggregate immediately upgrade of each stone outlet. Place temporary riprap and No. 2 coarse aggregate on
 geotextile. When joining sections of geotextile, overlap the sections a minimum of 18 inches in the direction
 of flow.
 
 6.
 
 Temporary Stone Check Dams. Construct temporary stone check dams in ditches to reduce flow velocity.
 Place No. 2 temporary coarse aggregate immediately upgrade of each check dam. Place temporary riprap and
 No. 2 coarse aggregate on the geotextile. When joining sections of the geotextile, overlap the sections a
 minimum of 18 inches in the direction of flow.
 
 7.
 
 Temporary Slope Drains. Install temporary slope drains on embankment slopes to intercept surface runoff
 where concentrated runoff will cause excessive erosion of the slope. Stake the drainpipe to the slope or secure
 it with temporary riprap to prevent movement or displacement. Attach a flared end section at each end of the
 pipe, and install elbows that conform with the existing changes in slopes.
 Construct a temporary berm using suitable material, and place haybales at the top of slope in the vicinity of
 the slope drain to intercept runoff and channel the runoff to the slope drain. Embed the haybales into the
 ground, and anchor them with wood stakes.
 Place temporary riprap loosely on geotextile at both ends of the pipe to prevent scour. Drape the geotextile
 over the top of the earth berm and anchor it as necessary. When joining sections of the geotextile, overlap the
 sections a minimum of 18 inches in the direction of flow.
 
 8.
 
 Inlet Filters. Provide Type 1 and Type 2 inlet filters as follows:
 a.
 
 Type 1. For new inlet structures, mold welded steel wire fabric around the inlet frames and grates, or
 inlet structures, and extend a minimum of 6 inches down each side of the new structures. Secure
 geotextile to the welded wire fabric. Place No. 2 coarse aggregate against the inlet structures to hold the
 inlet filter in place
 For existing inlet structures, place geotextile under the grates, over the curb pieces, and extend a
 minimum of 6 inches beyond. Place No. 2 coarse aggregate behind each curb piece and on the geotextile
 to secure the fabric in place.
 For existing or new inlets with curb pieces, wrap the geotextile around a piece of lumber. Place the
 lumber against the vertical opening to allow for flood overflow.
 Remove inlet filters within 12 hours of a paving operation.
 
 b.
 
 Type 2. Remove the inlet grate and place the inlet filter in the opening, holding out approximately 6
 inches of the filter outside the frame. Replace the inlet grate to hold the filter in place. Empty the filter
 according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. When removing the filter, ensure that sediment does
 not enter into the drainage system. Clean out the filter, dispose of the sediment as specified in
 202.03.07.B, rinse and return the filter to its original shape, and replace the filter inside the inlet.
 
 88
 
 9.
 
 Temporary Inlet Sediment Traps. Construct temporary inlet sediment traps when the elevation of the
 surface runoff is lower than the inlet structure. Create a 6-inch diameter opening in the inlet and place a 3 ×
 3-foot piece of Type 1 inlet geotextile and No. 2 coarse aggregate over the opening to prevent sediment from
 entering the inlet. Place temporary inlet sediment traps in each flow line upgrade of the inlet structure.
 Before raising the elevation of the surface runoff, remove and dispose of the temporary inlet sediment trap and
 repair the opening in the inlet.
 
 10. Temporary Stone Outlet Sediment Traps. Construct temporary stone outlet sediment traps with temporary
 basins and riprap spillways, within existing, new, and temporary ditches. Place No. 2 coarse aggregate
 immediately upgrade of the spillways. Place the riprap stones and coarse aggregate on geotextile that is
 anchored in the soil. If sections of geotextile need to be joined, overlap the sections a minimum of 18 inches
 in the direction of flow.
 11. Floating Turbidity Barriers. At least 10 days before installation, submit floating turbidity barrier design and
 placement locations for Department approval. Install floating turbidity barrier in streams or other waterbodies
 to contain discharge from drainage pipes and construction operations before beginning work in that area.
 Install floating turbidity barriers radially from the point of discharge of drainage pipes, or from construction
 operations that could potentially impact the waterbody. Install floating turbidity barriers parallel and as close
 to the shore as possible while still enabling it to float. Ensure that at least 5 feet of each end of the floating
 turbidity barrier is anchored on shore.
 Clean out floating turbidity barriers and keep them free from debris. Ensure floating turbidity barriers remain
 in place until all of the work in the area is completed, the cofferdam is removed (if applicable), and the
 adjacent ground area has established a firm stand of vegetation (if applicable). Remove floating turbidity
 barriers in such a manner as to minimize the release of sediment and debris.
 12. Dewatering Basin. At least 10 days before installation, submit to the RE for approval a plan detailing the
 size, materials, and location for all dewatering basins. Size dewatering basins to contain the expected
 discharge of water and sediment based on the flow rate of the pump to be used and the volume of area to be
 dewatered. Contain the turbid discharge from dewatering activities in a dewatering basin to control sediment
 and provide water filtration. As specified in N.J.A.C 7:9B or other applicable jurisdictional regulations,
 provide filtration to release clean and clear water into adjacent streams or other waterbodies. Install floating
 turbidity barriers where the basin outfall flows into a receiving waterbody. Ensure that the outfall of the basin
 does not cause erosion to or scour of the area onto which the water is being discharged.
 At the end of dewatering operations, remove the dewatering basin. Restore the disturbed area to the original
 condition.
 13. Sediment Control Bag. At least 10 days before installation, submit to the RE for approval a plan detailing
 the size, location, details of aggregate base, anticipated discharge flow, and manufacturer’s catalog cuts. If
 the outfall of the sediment control bag flows into receiving waterbody, ensure that floating turbidity barriers
 are installed as specified in 158.03.02.11.
 Install and maintain sediment control bags according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Size sediment
 control bags to accommodate anticipated sediment and flow rates. Place the sediment control bag on the slope
 to allow water to flow downhill through the bag. Place the discharge hose into the neck of sediment control
 bag and fasten to ensure that water does not leak at the connection. To increase the efficiency of filtration,
 place the bag on an aggregate bed to maximize water flow through the surface area of the bag. Size aggregate
 to prevent puncture of sediment control bags. Ensure that the discharge from the sediment control bag does
 not cause erosion to, or scour of, the area onto which the water is being discharged.
 When the sediment control bag is 90 percent full, can no longer efficiently filter sediment, or does not allow
 water to pass at a reasonable rate, remove and replace.
 Remove sediment control bags according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and dispose as specified in
 202.03.08. Restore the disturbed area to the original condition.
 14. Sediment Control Tank. At least 10 days before installation, submit sediment control tank design and
 proposed location for Department approval. Design sediment control tanks to contain or control the expected
 discharge of water and sediment based on the flow rate of the pump to be used, the volume of area to be
 
 89
 
 dewatered, and the frequency of removal of water, sediment, or both. Provide a sediment control tank to
 capture sediment and floating debris from dewatering activities. Provide filtration to release clean and clear
 water into adjacent streams or other waterbodies. Relocate the tank as needed to dewater other locations.
 Inspect the tank daily for level of sediment, debris, and water. Remove tank contents before the tank reaches
 50 percent of its capacity or when the tank no longer efficiently captures sediment or floating debris. Dispose
 of tank contents as specified in 202.03.07.B. If water from the tank is being discharged into a waterbody,
 install floating turbidity barriers to corral the discharge area. Protect the discharge area from erosion and
 scour.
 15. Construction Driveway. To minimize tracking of dirt and other materials onto existing roadways, provide a
 construction driveway at each location where vehicles exit the work site as approved by the RE. Construct
 driveways using No. 2 coarse aggregate placed on geotextile. Ensure that the driveway is at least 15 feet
 wide. The Contractor may make driveways wider if approved by RE. Maintain the driveway by top dressing
 or by excavating and top dressing, as directed by the RE, with additional No. 2 coarse aggregate. When the
 driveway is no longer required, remove the driveway, backfill to the adjacent ground elevation, and restore the
 disturbed area to the original condition.
 16. Concrete Washout System. At least 10 days before the first concrete placement, submit to the RE for
 approval a plan for the concrete washout system. Design the concrete washout system to fully contain the
 concrete washout needs, concrete slurry, and the Department’s concrete testing of the Work.
 Ensure that each concrete washout facility prevents discharge from concrete trucks and equipment cleaning
 from entering into inlets and into surface or groundwater. Ensure that the location of concrete washout
 facilities are no closer than 50 feet from environmentally sensitive areas such as streams, wetlands, or other
 areas shown on the Plans. Use signs to designate concrete washout areas. Ensure that concrete washout
 facilities are limited to the designated areas.
 Ensure that the concrete washout system is in place before delivery of concrete to the site. Ensure that a
 secure, non-collapsing, non-water collecting cover over each concrete washout facility is in place during
 precipitation so that precipitation does not accumulate and cause the washout areas to overflow. If the
 concrete washout facility becomes 50 percent full, discontinue pouring concrete until the concrete washout
 facility is cleaned out. Remove hardened concrete and reuse as specified in 202.03.07.A. Allow slurry to
 evaporate, or dispose of as specified in 202.03.07.B.
 If a lined basin is used, replace the liner if it becomes damaged or compromised. Remove concrete washout
 facilities when no longer needed. Restore the disturbed area to original condition.
 17. Absorbent Boom. Install the absorbent boom inside turbidity barrier or as shown on Plans to ensure that oil
 products do not escape the work site. If an oil spill occurs, remove absorbent boom after absorption of oil and
 dispose of as specified in 202.03.08. Replace as necessary to continually protect the waterbody.
 18. Oil-Water Separator. At least 10 days before beginning the work, submit to the RE for approval a plan
 detailing the size, location, anticipated discharge flow and manufacturer’s catalog cuts of the oil-water
 separator before installation. Provide an oil-water separator for removal of free product generated in
 dewatering excavations in each area of petroleum contaminated groundwater.
 Use a self-contained factory assembled oil-water separator meeting the following requirements:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 Capable of removing free petroleum product as required by Contractor-obtained discharge permits.
 Designed for intermittent, varied, or continuous flows of water, oil, or combinations of nonemulsified oil-water mixtures.
 Designed to minimize solids buildup in the separator’s oil-water collection chamber.
 Capable of being moved about within the Project Limits as needed.
 
 Dispose of oils and sediments collected in the oil-water separators as specified in 202.03.08.
 19. Oil-Only Emergency Spill Kit. Before start of construction operations, place oil-only emergency spill kits
 within the Project Limits, with each kit capable of cleaning up at least 95 gallons of spill. Include the
 following:
 1.
 2.
 
 An instruction manual and emergency response guide.

 94
 
 159.03.04 Temporary Pavement Markers
 Apply temporary pavement markers with butyl adhesive pads to clean, dry pavement surfaces free of cracking, checking,
 or spalling. If the layout locates a marker at a joint or defect, relocate the marker longitudinally at least 2 inches beyond
 the joint or defect. Replace lost or damaged temporary pavement markers.
 Only remove temporary pavement markers that will be replaced by striping in the same day. If striping cannot be
 finished in the same day, reinstall temporary pavement markers before opening the road to traffic.
 159.03.05 Temporary Pavement Marking Tape
 Install tape according to the manufacturer’s recommendations when the weather is favorable as determined by the RE.
 Immediately before marking the pavement surface, clean the surface of dirt, oil, grease, and foreign material, including
 curing compound on new concrete. Clean the surface 2 inches beyond the perimeter of the marking to be placed.
 Install tape on dry surfaces having a surface temperature between 50 °F and 150 °F, when the ambient temperature is at
 least 50 °F and rising. When splicing is required, install the tape using butt splices. Do not overlap the tape.

 The RE may direct the Contractor to sawcut existing HMA pavement to the depth of the area to be repaired. Sawcut
 lines parallel and perpendicular to the roadway baseline and 3 inches away, at the closest point, from the damaged area to
 be repaired. Remove loose material within the boundary of the repair, and clean the area. Reuse removed material as
 specified in 202.03.07.A. Ensure that the remaining pavement is not damaged.
 Apply polymerized joint adhesive or tack coat to the vertical surfaces of the openings. Ensure that the temperature of the
 HMA when placed is at least 250 °F. Place HMA in 4-inch maximum lifts, and compact with a vibratory drum. For
 small areas, the RE may approve hand compacting methods. Compact until the top of the patch is flush with the adjacent
 pavement surface.
 159.03.08 Traffic Direction
 A.
 
 Flagger. Provide a flagger that has received formal training in flagging operations and the proper use of the
 STOP/SLOW paddle. The flagger must meet MUTCD qualifications and, when requested, demonstrate
 competency to the RE. Immediately replace flaggers who fail to demonstrate competency with a competent
 flagger. Ensure that flaggers wear a 360 °high-visibility retroreflective orange safety garment meeting ANSI/ISEA
 Class 3, Level 2 standards. Ensure that the flagger is equipped with a STOP/SLOW paddle meeting MUTCD
 requirements and follows MUTCD flagging procedures.
 
 B.
 
 Police. Unless designated as local police at the preconstruction conference, police will be on-duty New Jersey
 State Police. Police are either provided by the RE as employees of the State, or by the local government as a
 vendor to the State. The use of police services by the RE does not relinquish or diminish the Contractor’s
 responsibilities for work zone safety.
 Submit a request for police services to the RE 72 hours before beginning construction operations that require police
 services. Activities requiring police services include:
 1.
 2.
 
 Traffic direction through signalized intersections, where the integrity of the existing traffic signal system
 is impacted or where an override of the signal is required.
 Rolling slow-down or temporary closure of all lanes on state highways and interstates.
 
 95
 
 Emergency situations may prevent police from arriving at the scheduled date or time. The RE will not permit
 construction operations that, by law, require police services if police are unavailable. The Department will not
 accept claims for interruptions or delays resulting from any failure of police to arrive as requested.
 The Contractor may request police services to enhance the TCP. Submit a request for police services to the RE
 72 hours before beginning construction operations that require police services. The RE will determine the need for,
 and direct the use of, police for the following activities.
 1.

 SECTION 160 – PRICE ADJUSTMENTS
 160.01 DESCRIPTION
 This Section describes the requirements for price adjustments for fuel and asphalt usage.
 160.02 MATERIALS
 (Intentionally Blank)
 160.03 PROCEDURE
 160.03.01 Fuel Price Adjustment
 The Department will make monthly price adjustments for fuel usage for Items listed in Table 161.03.01-1. The
 Department will calculate fuel price adjustments based on the monthly pay quantities of listed Items using the fuel usage
 factors listed in Table 161.03.01-1.
 Price adjustments may result in an increased payment to the Contractor for increases in the price index and may result in
 a reduction in payment for decreases in the price index.
 If the as-built quantity of an Item listed in Table 161.03.01-1 differs from the sum of the quantities in the monthly
 Estimates, and the as-built quantity cannot by readily distributed among the months that the Item listed in Table
 161.03.01-1 was constructed, then the Department will determine fuel price adjustment by distributing the difference in
 the same proportion as the Item’s monthly Estimate quantity is to the total of the item’s monthly estimates.

 If an item listed in Table 161.03.01-1 has a payment unit which differs from that listed in Table 161.03.01-1, the
 Department will apply an appropriate conversion factor to determine the number of gallons of fuel used.
 The Department will calculate fuel price adjustment on a monthly basis using the following formula:
 F = (MF − BF) × G
 Where:
 F = Fuel Price Adjustment
 MF = Monthly Fuel Price Index
 BF = Basic Fuel Price Index
 G = Gallons of Fuel for Price Adjustment
 
 The Department will post the monthly fuel price index every month on the Department’s website:
 http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/business/trnsport/PriceIndex.shtm
 The basic fuel price index is the previous month’s fuel price index before receipt of bids. The Department will use the
 fuel price index for the month before the regular monthly estimate cut off date as the Monthly Fuel Price Index. If the
 Monthly Fuel Price Index increases by 50 percent or more over the Basic Fuel Price Index, do not perform any work
 involving Items listed in Table 161.03.01-1 without written approval from the RE.

 160.03.02 Asphalt Price Adjustment
 The Department will make monthly price adjustments for asphalt binder usage. The Department will calculate asphalt
 price adjustments based on the quantities of Items containing asphalt binder constructed during a given month.
 Price adjustments may result in an increased payment to the Contractor for increases in the price index and may result in
 a reduction in payment for decreases in the price index.
 The Department will calculate the asphalt price adjustment by the following formula:
 A = (MA − BA) × T
 Where:
 A = Asphalt Price Adjustment
 MA = Monthly Asphalt Price Index
 BA = Basic Asphalt Price Index
 T = Tons of New Asphalt Binder1
 1. The Department will determine the weight of asphalt binder for price adjustment by multiplying the percentage of new asphalt
 binder in the approved job mix formula by the weight of the item containing asphalt binder.
 
 For TACK COAT and PRIME COAT, the Department will calculate asphalt price adjustments by the following formula:
 A = B × [(MA − BA)/BA] × C × M × G
 Where:
 A = Asphalt Price Adjustment
 B = Bid Price for Tack Coat/Prime Coat
 MA = Monthly Asphalt Price Index
 BA = Basic Asphalt Price Index
 C = Petroleum Content of the Tack Coat and Prime Coat in Percent by Volume:
 Use 100% for cutbacks
 90% for inverted emulsions
 60% for RS or similar type emulsions
 M = Percentage of Bid Price Applicable to Materials Only: Use 82%
 G = Gallons of Tack Coat and Prime Coat Furnished and Applied
 
 The monthly asphalt price index, as determined by the Department, will be the average of quotations from suppliers
 serving the area in which the Project is located, and will be determined by the Department each month. The Department
 will post the monthly asphalt price index every month on the Department’s web site
 http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/business/trnsport/PriceIndex.shtm.
 The basic asphalt rice index is the asphalt price index for the month before the opening of bids. The Department will use
 the asphalt price index for the month before the regular monthly estimate cut off date as the monthly asphalt price index.
 If the monthly asphalt price index increases 50 percent or more over the basic asphalt price index, do not perform work
 on Items containing asphalt binder without written approval from the RE.

 cylinders, drums, above ground and underground heating oil tanks, asbestos, and garbage from the building
 according to applicable Federal, State, and local laws, rules, and regulations. Remove and recycle materials
 that are required to be recycled by the Federal, State, and local laws, rules, and regulations. Before beginning
 demolition operations, pump out and clean basements, wells, cesspools, and outbuildings within the areas to
 be cleared in a sanitary manner. After being disinfected as required by the health authorities, backfill to
 adjacent ground level as specified in 201.03.07.5.
 Maintain wells, cisterns, cesspools, and other openings in the ground outside the area to be cleared without
 hindering their functionality. Cap well casings securely and permanently as specified in 201.03.06, and cut
 off and cap pipes leading into or out of the well.
 Leave adjacent buildings in a safe condition, and do not deface, mar, or jeopardize them in any way. Repair
 or restore damaged buildings to the satisfaction of the RE.
 Ensure that the phases of demolition are performed within the designated limits and without hazard to
 adjacent properties or to the public. Do not set any structure on fire.
 Do not demolish or disturb chimneys common to adjacent properties other than to give them the necessary
 support for their continued stability. If necessary, repoint and cap them.
 When demolishing a portion of a building, shore, brace, and support the remaining part so that the integrity
 and support of all remaining walls, floors, roofs, and their supporting members are maintained and continued
 in such a way that shoring, bracing, and support is outside the ROW. Board up and seal the remaining portion
 of such a partially demolished building along the ROW, and weatherproof the new closure and its connections
 to the remaining portion of the severed building. Material for closure shall consist of adequately braced
 studding of 2 × 4-inch timbers placed no more than 16 inches on center with wood facing, or equal, nailed to
 the studding and without any holes appearing therein. Cover the wood facing with 2 layers of smoothfinished, 65 pounds per roll, roofing material according to ASTM D 224 and having an overlap of at least
 4 inches.
 
 5.
 
 Backfilling. Backfill and compact subsurface areas including cellars using the directed method as specified in

 of stripping with the RE based on field conditions. Temporarily store in stockpiles, as specified in 202.03.03.B, stripped
 material including excess that is determined suitable for the future use of the Department. The Department will sample
 and analyze stripped material in stockpiles to determine suitability for use as topsoil. Store suitable stripped material
 within the Project Limits until placement. Reuse or dispose of unsuitable stripped material as specified in 202.03.07.
 202.03.02 Excavating Test Pits
 Before beginning Construction Operations, locate existing subsurface structures and utilities that may be affected by or
 interfere with the proposed construction. Obtain utility locations as specified in 105.07. If directed by the RE, excavate
 to obtain the utility location.
 Excavate as specified in 202.03.03 and as directed by the RE. Excavate test pits or portions of a test pit by hand when in
 close proximity to utilities or when directed. Backfill test pits with excavated material in 6-inch lifts, and compact using
 the directed method as specified in 203.03.02.C.
 202.03.03 Excavating Unclassified Material
 A.
 
 Excavating. The Department, as the generator, is solely responsible for the designation of excavated material.
 Unclassified excavation consists of excavation and management of material of whatever nature encountered, except
 for regulated material or acid producing soil.
 Excavate using equipment and methods that remove material to the specified excavation limits without disturbing
 the material outside of the excavation limits. While excavating, protect facilities and structures from damage and
 disturbance. Ensure that material outside excavation limits is not disturbed. If any material outside the excavation
 limits becomes disturbed, restore the area as directed by the RE. Excavate and grade to ensure proper drainage.
 Do not excavate more than 15 feet in depth without stabilizing the slope either by temporarily seeding and
 mulching, or by topsoiling, permanently seeding, and mulching as specified in 806.03.01. Submit alternate
 methods for stabilizing slopes when seeding is not allowable due to seasonable constraints. Obtain RE approval of
 alternate methods before beginning embankment construction. Repair damaged seeded areas as specified in
 806.03.01.
 Notify the RE if excavation to the finished grade section results in unstable subgrade or slopes. Obtain RE
 approval before removing unstable material and backfilling the area with suitable material. Backfill with excavated
 material and compact using the directed method as specified in 203.03.02.C.
 If a slope failure develops during excavation, immediately cease operations. Determine the limits of unstable
 material, and start backfilling immediately. Once the slope has been stabilized, resume excavation by RE approved
 methods.
 
 108
 
 The RE will check elevations of the roadbed subgrade as specified in 202.03.03.C. Ensure that the elevation is
 within ±1/2 inch of the specified elevation.
 Use excavated material on the Project, as directed by the RE, or as specified in 202.03.07.
 1.
 
 Wet Areas. If required, submit a dewatering plan including method of dewatering and controlling sediment
 and contaminants from entering adjacent waterbodies, wetlands, and environmentally sensitive areas. Obtain
 RE approval for dewatering operations before beginning the work. Excavate wet areas down to firm bottom
 within the lateral limits. Test the bottom of the excavation area at frequent intervals as the excavation
 progresses, by taking soundings, samples, or other tests, to determine when firm bottom is reached. The
 Department may require the Contractor to take additional borings or samples to determine if unsuitable
 material remains or is entrapped within the excavation limits.
 Excavate using equipment and methods \to the specified elevation without disturbing the material below that
 elevation. If the methods and equipment disturb the material below the specified elevation, immediately stop
 operations. Resume excavation using alternate methods and equipment as approved by the RE.
 The RE may allow the use of dikes, well points, or other means for dewatering the excavation areas if
 cofferdams are not shown on the Plans. If permits are required for this work, submit a copy of approvals, as
 specified in 107.01.02, to the RE before proceeding with the work.
 
 2.
 
 Foundation and Bridge Areas. Excavate for footings to the limits shown in the plans causing minimal
 disturbance to the remaining embankment. If the underlying material is disturbed, compact it using the
 directed method as specified in 203.03.02.C. Backfill and compact the remaining excavated area using the
 density control method as specified in 203.03.02.D. Restore the embankment to the final section.
 Remove boulders or rock fingers projecting into the bottom of the excavation to a minimum depth of 6 inches
 below the bottom of footing. Backfill the space with coarse aggregate, and compact it using the directed
 method as specified in 203.03.02.C.
 In areas where the footing rests partly on soil and partly on rock, excavate the rock to 2 feet below the footing.
 Backfill the space with coarse aggregate, and compact it using the directed method as specified in
 203.03.02.C.
 In areas where the footing rests entirely on rock, excavate to a firm, level, roughened surface. Clean out
 seams, and fill them with concrete or mortar before placing concrete for foundations.
 If shale is encountered at the bottom of the footing and the footing is not poured the same day, leaving the
 shale exposed to air or water, undercut the shale at least 4 inches. Seal the undercut with the same class of
 concrete as the overlying footing to the bottom of the footing elevation, and provide a rough finish.
 If during the course of the excavation, rock is shattered below the foundation elevation, remove the shattered
 rock and fill the void with the same class of concrete as the overlying footing.
 The RE may order, in writing, changes in dimensions or elevation of footings as necessary to secure an
 acceptable foundation.
 After completing the excavation to the elevation of the bottom of the footing, obtain the RE’s approval before
 beginning footing construction or placement of coarse aggregate.
 When specified, place coarse aggregate following the completion of the excavation. Shape the material on
 which the coarse aggregate is to be placed to an even surface. Place coarse aggregate in 6-inch lifts and
 compact using the directed method as specified in 203.03.02.C.
 
 3.
 
 Rock Areas. The Contractor may remove entire boulders extending beyond the specified limits of
 excavation. Backfill and compact space created outside the specified limits by such boulder removal using
 the directed method as specified in 203.03.02.C. Ensure that undrained pockets are not left in the surface of
 the rock.
 After completing the excavation of each lift of rock slope construction and before beginning the next lift, scale
 the completed slopes to remove loose rock fragments. The RE will examine rock slopes during the excavation
 to identify possible unstable conditions and to determine the need for stabilization. Provide assistance and
 equipment necessary for such examination.
 
 109
 
 If it is determined that in-place stabilization is required, use rock bolting or other stabilization techniques as
 directed. Before drilling and blasting, remove existing overburden to the top of rock. Take necessary
 precautions in drilling and blasting operations to preserve the rock remaining in the specified finished slope in
 a natural undamaged condition. Conduct blasting operations according to the following:
 a.
 
 Blasting Plan. Submit a blasting plan at least 14 days before commencing drilling and blasting
 operations and before each subsequent shot thereafter. Include the full details of the drilling and blasting
 patterns and controls to be used for both the presplitting and production blasting. Additionally, include
 the following minimum information:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 6.
 7.
 8.
 9.
 
 Station limits of proposed shot.
 Plan and section views of proposed drill pattern, including free face, burden, blasthole
 spacing, diameters and angles, lift height, and subdrill depth.
 Loading diagram showing type and amount of explosives, primers, initiators, and location and
 depth of stemming.
 Manufacturers’ data sheets for explosives, primers, and initiators to be employed.
 Initiation sequence of blastholes including delay times and delay system.
 Planned security measures for storage of explosives.
 Safety plan for personnel and public.
 Copy of blasting license.
 Name and qualifications of blasting supervisor.
 
 The blasting plan submittal is for quality control and record keeping purposes. A review of the blasting
 plan does not relieve responsibility for the accuracy and adequacy of the plan when implemented in the
 field.
 b.
 
 Blasting Test Sections. Before commencing full-scale blasting operations, demonstrate the adequacy of
 the proposed blasting plan by drilling, blasting, and excavating short test sections, up to 100 feet in
 length, to determine which combination of method, hole spacing, and charge works best. The RE may
 direct additional test sections when field conditions warrant.
 Conform to the requirements for controlled and production blasting operations when blasting in
 conjunction with the test shots.
 Do not drill ahead of the test shot area until the test section has been excavated and the results evaluated.
 If the results of the test shots are unsatisfactory, revise methods to achieve the required results.
 Unsatisfactory test shot results include an excessive amount of fragmentation beyond the shown lines
 and grade, excessive flyrock, or violation of other requirements.
 If, at any time during the progress of the work, the methods of drilling and blasting do not produce the
 desired result of a uniform slope and shear face, within the tolerances specified, drill, blast, and excavate
 in short sections, not exceeding 100 feet long, until a technique is arrived at that produces the desired
 results.
 
 c.
 
 Safety. Handle explosive materials and conduct blasting operations as specified in 105.10. Use only
 standard explosives, blasting agents, detonating cord, delays, blasting caps, and other blasting
 accessories prepared and packaged by explosive manufacturing firms.
 Restrict access to the entire blast area for a minimum of 5 minutes following a blast to guard against
 rock fall before commencing work in the cut.
 The RE will prohibit or halt the blasting operations if it is apparent that through the methods being
 employed, the required slopes are not being obtained in a stable condition, or the safety and convenience
 of the traveling public is being jeopardized.
 
 d.
 
 Methods of Drilling and Blasting.
 (1) Presplitting. Presplitting is a controlled blasting method for constructing a shear plane along a
 specified cut slope through the controlled use of explosives and accessories in properly aligned and
 spaced drill holes.
 
 110
 
 After removing the overburden and weathered rock, drill slope holes for presplitting along the line
 and in the plane of the cut slope. Drill slope holes between 2-1/2 and 3 inches in diameter. Control
 operations to ensure that the drill holes do not deviate from the plane of the slope by more than 6
 inches and do not deviate within the plane of the slope by more than 6 inches.
 Ensure that the drilling equipment for drilling the presplit holes has mechanical devices affixed to
 accurately determine the angle at which the drill steel enters the rock. The RE will not allow
 presplit hole drilling if these devices are either missing or inoperative. Do not space slope holes
 more than 3 feet on centers, and adjust spacing as required to produce a uniform and stable shear
 plane between slope holes. Under certain conditions, to produce a uniform and stable shear plane,
 the RE may also require auxiliary holes, which are identical to the slope holes but are not loaded
 with explosives.
 The Contractor may extend the length of the slope holes to the full depth of the cut, to a maximum
 of 50 feet, if hole alignment is maintained. Otherwise, drill and blast slope holes in lifts. If
 presplitting in lifts, the RE will allow a maximum offset of 6 inches to accommodate the drill head.
 Arrange lifts so that the toe of the finished cut slope coincides with the toe of slope. Before placing
 explosives or blasting agents, ensure that the hole is free of obstructions for its entire depth.
 Provide explosives for use in presplit holes with a maximum diameter less than 1/2 the diameter of
 the presplit hole, and ensure that explosives do not touch the side of the hole. Use only standard
 explosives manufactured especially for presplitting in presplit holes, unless otherwise approved.
 Do not load bulk ammonium nitrate and fuel oil in the presplit holes.
 Use an amount of explosives in the presplit hole that produces the shearing without causing
 overbreak. Ensure that the top of the load is far enough below the collar to avoid overbreak at the
 surface. Extend the detonator cord downline from the collar to the bottom of the bore hole and
 from the collar to the detonator trunkline or electric blasting caps. Prime the explosive charge
 according to the recommendations of the manufacturer of the commercial explosive or blasting
 agent.
 If using fractional portions of standard explosive cartridges, firmly affix them to the detonating
 cord so that the cartridges do not slip down the detonating cord or bridge across the hole. Do not
 space fractional cartridges along the length of the detonating cord farther than 30 inches on center.
 Adjust spacing to give the desired results.
 Assemble continuous column cartridge type of explosives used with detonating cord, and affix
 them to the detonating cord according to the explosive manufacturer’s recommendations. Provide
 a copy of these instructions to the RE.
 The Contractor may make the bottom charge of a presplit hole larger than the line charges but not
 so large as to cause overbreak. Place the top charge of the presplitting hole far enough below the
 collar, and reduce the charge sufficiently, to avoid overbreaking and heaving.
 Stem the upper portion of presplit holes, from the topmost charge to the hole collar. Stemming
 materials shall consist of drill cutting or 3/8-inch clean stone chips.
 The Contractor does not need to stem below the topmost charge unless the Department determines
 that the rock is very seamy and incompetent, in which case, the Contractor may need to full stem
 such zones.
 The Contractor may detonate presplit holes instantaneously or on short delays between each hole.
 Ensure that delay detonating does not exceed 25 milliseconds between holes. Detonate presplit
 holes before detonating any production holes.
 Extend presplitting a minimum of 50 feet ahead of the production blasting limits, but not more than
 100 feet beyond the exposed presplit face.
 (2) Production Blasting. Production blasting is a method of drilling and blasting to produce a high
 degree of fragmentation of the rock mass to be excavated.
 
 111
 
 Drill the adjacent line of production holes inside the presplit lines so as to avoid damage to the
 presplit face. If necessary, the Contractor may drill the first line of production holes parallel to the
 presplit face to reduce overbreak of this face.
 The Contractor may vary hole diameter, spacing, delay patterns, explosives, blasting agents, and
 other variables to obtain a fragmentation acceptable to the RE, provided that the existing presplit
 face is not damaged.
 B.
 
 Temporarily Storing. Temporarily store soil in stockpiles in well-drained areas no closer than 50 feet from
 streams, wetlands, floodplains, other waterbodies, and as shown on the Plans. Construct stockpiles on polyethylene
 sheeting. Overlap joints in the underlying polyethylene sheeting a minimum of 12 inches. Contain stockpiles with
 haybales or silt fence placed continuously at the perimeter of the stockpiles. Construct stockpiles to heights not
 exceeding 15 feet and with side slopes no steeper than 2H:1V. Segregate material of differing types and levels of
 contamination depending on reuse or disposal.
 Protect and maintain the stockpile and embankment until reuse or disposal. Provide protection for the stockpile to
 control the stormwater run-off, erosion, and unauthorized contact. Where the material in the stockpile is saturated,
 pitch the bottom polyethylene sheeting towards a discharge basin to collect water drained from the stockpile.
 Manage the collected water in the same manner as that generated during dewatering operations.
 Maintain the polyethylene sheeting or replace it as needed for as long as the stockpile remains. Periodically inspect
 stockpiles to ensure that material is not released into the surrounding environment.
 When temporarily storing soil is not possible within the Project Limits, the Contractor may temporarily store soil at
 a site provided by the Contractor outside the Project Limits as approved by the RE and meeting the requirements of
 105.08 and 108.04.
 If the stockpile remains exposed for more than 15 days, temporarily seed, as specified in 806.03.01, and mulch
 stockpiles as specified in 809.03.01 or 809.03.02.
 When the stockpile is removed, restore the area to the original condition.
 
 C.
 
 Measuring Elevation. Using Contractor established grade stakes set outside the pavement box and at breaklines,
 the RE will check elevations within the roadbed limits using a stringline drawn taut between these stakes. Ensure
 that grade stakes indicate the vertical cut or fill measurement referenced to the finish grade. The RE will check
 elevations longitudinally every 50 feet and transversely at the edges, breaklines, and the center of each lane and
 shoulder. The RE may direct additional grade stakes in areas with rapid changes in grade so that intermediate
 longitudinal checks can be made.

 courses full depth parallel to the centerline of the joint for the width designated. Use a saw capable of providing a neat
 cut for the full depth in a single pass.
 
 115
 
 Do not use equipment that involves a ball, weight, or punch to break or remove the concrete within 5 feet of a transverse
 joint or within 3 feet of any structure or pavement that is to remain in place. Break up or remove the concrete within
 restricted areas so as not to damage the adjacent joint structure, pavement, or other structure that is to remain.
 Contain debris from the breaking of concrete base and concrete surface courses within the work site. Use necessary
 containment devices to protect adjacent vehicular or pedestrian traffic from flying debris. Reuse or dispose of material
 as specified in 202.03.07.
 202.03.07 Reuse or Disposal of Excess Material
 A.
 
 Reuse. Before using other excess materials, reuse regulated material as shown on the Plans or with RE approval.
 The Contractor may use excavated material, if the requirements specified in 901.11 are met, to construct Items
 requiring soil aggregates. Submit written notification at least 15 days before reuse.
 With approval, reuse excavated soil to widen or flatten slopes of embankment, to fade embankments into cuts, or as
 approved at other locations.
 The Contractor may reuse broken concrete, HMA pieces, and millings in the lower portion of I-14 soil aggregate.
 Spread out pieces in layers, with the pieces lying flat and not arching, with spaces between the pieces filled with
 soil. Use pieces with a maximum individual size of 2 cubic feet, with a 2-foot maximum dimension on any side.
 Do not place the broken concrete, HMA pieces and milling within 2 feet of the final subgrade, less than 2 feet
 above the highest seasonal high ground water table or within 2 feet of any underground utility. Compact material
 using the directed method as specified in 203.03.02.C.
 Dispose of excavated material that will not be reused as specified in 202.03.07.B.
 
 B.
 
 Disposal. Dispose of excess regulated material as specified in 202.03.08. Dispose of excess APS at approved
 landfills according to applicable Federal, State, and local laws, rules, and regulations. For excavation not
 designated as regulated material or APS, provide the following before removing the excess excavation from the
 Project Limits.
 1.
 
 2.
 
 At least 10 days before disposing, submit the disposal procedure and location to the RE for approval. Do
 not dispose of excavation on property proposed to be or used for parks, playgrounds, and other
 recreational purposes; educational facilities; environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands; historic
 sites; or within sight of a State highway during all seasons.
 On a Department provided form, obtain the property owner’s notarized authorization of the acceptance
 of the excess material and where it is being placed.

 This Section describes the requirements for constructing embankments and for preparing areas on which embankments
 are placed.
 203.02 MATERIALS
 203.02.01 Materials
 Provide materials as specified:
 Soil Aggregate (I-9, I-10, I-11, I-13, and I-14) ................................................................................................... 901.11
 203.02.02 Equipment
 Provide equipment as specified:
 Pneumatic-Tired Compactor ............................................................................................................................. 1002.01
 Dynamic Compactor ......................................................................................................................................... 1002.02
 Steel Wheel Roller ............................................................................................................................................ 1002.03
 Padfoot Roller ................................................................................................................................................... 1002.04
 203.03 CONSTRUCTION
 203.03.01 Constructing Embankment
 Before beginning embankment, excavate and stabilize side ditches, and install perimeter SESC measures as specified in
 158.03.02. Ensure that the ground surface is not frozen and is free from snow, ice, and mud before constructing
 embankment.
 Do not backfill or begin constructing embankment against a structure until the forms can be removed as specified in
 504.03.02.G. Where existing pipes and conduit have insufficient soil cover during embankment construction, protect the
 pipes and conduit from damage by the equipment and operations.
 Backfill and compact low areas, holes, channels, and ditches using the directed method, as specified in 203.03.02.C,
 before constructing embankment.
 When placing more than 15 inches of embankment on existing pavement, break the pavement into pieces that are a
 maximum of 2 feet in any dimension.
 When constructing an embankment against an existing slope or when constructing an embankment in stages, bench the
 existing slope against which the embankment is to be placed as the embankment is constructed in lifts. For each lift,
 bench a minimum of 6 feet into the existing slope to allow the new embankment to integrate with the existing slope.
 Compact benched areas with the new embankment.
 If the RE determines that the moisture content of the existing ground, previously constructed embankment, or
 embankment material may adversely affect embankment construction, cease embankment construction until the moisture
 content is corrected.
 
 119
 
 Construct embankment to ensure adequate surface drainage is provided at all times. Construct the center of the roadbed
 higher than the sides, and keep the surface uniformly graded and compacted. At the end of each working day, construct
 temporary stabilized berms and slope drains along the top edges of the embankment to intercept surface runoff.
 During embankment construction, allocate adequate space in the embankment for excavated material. Begin
 constructing embankment by placing initial lifts in the deepest portion of the embankment. Continue placing lifts
 approximately parallel to the finished pavement grade line. If constructing embankments with material that is obtained
 from more than 1 source, do not co-mingle materials.
 When constructing embankment for the specified materials, the following apply:
 1.
 
 Concrete or HMA. The Contractor may use concrete or HMA pieces to construct embankment if approved
 by the RE. Ensure that HMA or concrete pieces are at least 2 feet above the water table when constructing
 embankment.
 
 2.
 
 Soil Aggregate and Rock. If I-14 soil aggregate is composed of soil aggregate and rock, fill the rock voids
 with soil aggregate. If constructing embankments outside the ROW or easement, construct the top 30 inches
 with I-14 soil aggregate that contains no aggregate exceeding 2 inches in any dimension.
 
 3.
 
 Rock. Obtain RE approval before placing rock in embankments. Do not place rock in embankment in areas
 where piles or guide rail posts are to be driven, or drainage structures or utilities are to be constructed.
 Before placing rock on compacted embankment constructed of soil, grade the existing embankment surface to
 slope from the centerline to the sides at the rate of approximately 1 inch to the foot, and thoroughly compact
 the surface of the embankment.
 Place rock to form the base of embankments for the full width of the embankment. Place rock in uniform lifts
 to a depth that does not exceed 1-1/2 times the approximate size of the largest rock, but limited to a maximum
 lift depth of 3 feet. Reduce the size of rocks larger than 2 feet in any dimension. Distribute rock by blading
 or dozing to ensure proper placement in the embankment and to keep voids, pockets, and bridging to a
 minimum. Do not dump rock in final position.
 Ensure that the exterior 1-foot portion of the top and sides of rock in embankment contains no rock exceeding
 8 inches in any dimension. Fill voids in the exterior 1-foot portion with granular material. Do not place rock
 in embankment within 2 feet of the finished subgrade elevation.
 When planting trees in the embankment, ensure that the exterior 2-foot portion of the top and sides of rock in
 embankment contains no rock exceeding 8 inches in any dimension. Fill voids in the exterior 2-foot portion
 with granular material.
 Construct the balance of the embankment with soil aggregate. Place and grade material in lifts not exceeding
 8 inches, and then compact using the directed method as specified in 203.03.02.C.
 
 When constructing embankment abutting structures before the abutments and wingwalls are completed, allow ample
 space for construction of the abutting structure. Construct the embankment abutting the structure at a slope of 5H:1V, or
 flatter. When the abutting structure is complete, finish placing the embankment to the structure. Place embankment
 around and adjacent to arches, rigid frame bridges, culverts, and piers simultaneously on both sides to the same
 elevation. Do not place embankment with pieces larger than 6 inches in any dimension within 2 feet of structures,
 utilities, and drainage facilities.
 Place and compact material used for embankment as specified in Table 203.03.01-1:

 During embankment construction, route construction equipment, both loaded and empty, over the lifts with the travel
 distributed evenly over the entire width of the embankment. Before placing subsequent lifts, regrade and compact areas
 rutted by traffic.
 The RE will check the elevation of the subgrade as specified in 202.03.03.C. The allowable tolerance from the shown
 elevations is ±1/2 inch.
 Stabilize slopes either by temporarily seeding and mulching, or by topsoiling, permanently seeding, and mulching as
 specified in 806.03.01. Do not construct embankment more than 15 feet high without stabilizing the slope. Submit
 alternate methods for stabilizing slopes when seeding is not allowable due to seasonable constraints. Obtain RE approval
 of alternate methods before beginning embankment construction.
 203.03.02 Placing and Compacting Methods
 A.
 
 End-Dumping Method. Do not begin end-dumping until the RE tests the bottom of the excavation to determine
 that the wet material has been removed down to firm bottom or the lower limit as shown on the Plans. Do not
 interrupt end-dumping except as necessary to allow for testing and measuring. When interrupted for more than 24
 hours, do not end-dump until the RE retests the bottom of the excavated area and determines it to be in satisfactory
 condition.
 Sequence excavation and end-dumping to ensure that wet material does not re-enter the excavated area. End-dump
 the embankment material only to an elevation that allows the use of compacting equipment. Construct the
 remainder of the embankment using the control fill method as specified in 203.03.02.B.
 Fill and advance the embankment wedge so that the remaining wet material is forced to the sides of the excavation
 and is not entrapped under the embankment. Remove wet material that accumulates at the sides of the excavated
 area as the embankment wedge advances. Remove wet material spilled or otherwise deposited on the top or sides
 of the embankment during this operation.
 When widening an existing embankment, place embankment material along and outward from the existing
 embankment in close coordination with the excavation to prevent entrapping wet material between the existing and
 new sections of embankment and displacing unstable materials that may be under the existing embankment.
 Prevent settlement of or damage to existing roadways, utilities, or other facilities. Repair or replace roadways,
 utilities, or other facilities to the preconstruction condition.
 
 B.
 
 Control Fill Method.
 1.
 
 Control Strip. Construct a control strip to determine compaction requirements. Construct a new control strip
 for each change in the character or source of the material or for any change in the compaction equipment.
 Each control strip is to remain in place and become a portion of the completed embankment.
 Obtain RE approval of the subgrade or course upon which a control strip is to be constructed before
 constructing the control strip. Construct a 400-square yard or greater control strip consisting of 3 equally
 thick lifts not exceeding 12 inches each.
 Compact each of the first 2 lifts of the control strip using the directed method as specified in 203.03.02.C.
 Compact the third lift of the control strip with a minimum of 2 passes of the compaction equipment. Continue
 compacting until additional passes result in no appreciable increase in density. The ME will determine
 density of the control strip according to AASHTO T 310 (Direct Transmission Method). Provide a final lift
 surface that is smooth, dense, and free from ruts and roller marks.
 After the Contractor completes compaction of the control strip, the ME will perform a minimum of 10 tests at
 random locations to determine the average in-place dry density of the control strip. If the average dry density
 of the material in the control strip is equal to or greater than 95 percent of its maximum density as determined
 according to AASHTO T 99, Method C, including the replacement option, then the RE will approve the
 compaction equipment and its method of use for compaction of embankment of the same materials and
 thicknesses on the Project. If the control strip fails to achieve the required density, remove and construct a
 new control strip. Revise compaction operations for subsequent control strips to achieve the required density.
 
 2.
 
 Embankment. Continue constructing the embankments in the same manner as the approved control strip. If
 an area is inaccessible to the compacting equipment used to construct the control strip, compact each lift to a
 121
 
 density of at least 95 percent of the maximum density as determined according to AASHTO T 99, Method C.
 The ME will determine the density of such inaccessible areas from the average of 5 randomly located
 measurements according to AASHTO T 310 (Direct Transmission Method).
 C.
 
 Directed Method. Place embankment materials, except rock, in lifts not exceeding 8 inches thick. Place rock as
 specified in 203.03.01.3. Compact each lift as specified in Table 203.03.02-1.

 If an area is inaccessible to the compacting equipment specified in Table 203.03.02-1, compact each lift following
 the density control method as specified in 203.03.02.D.
 D.
 
 Density Control Method. If required, submit a dewatering plan including the method of dewatering and
 controlling sediment and contaminants from entering adjacent waterbodies, wetlands and environmentally sensitive
 areas. Dewater areas according to the dewatering plan before and during embankment construction if areas are
 below the water table. Construct embankment in lifts not exceeding 12 inches thick after compaction. Do not
 blend I-9 soil aggregate to meet gradation requirements at the placement site. Compact embankment materials to a
 density of at least 95 percent of maximum density. For bridge foundations without piles, determine maximum
 density according to AASHTO T 180, Method D, including the replacement option. For other instances, determine
 maximum density according to AASHTO T 99, Method C, including the replacement option. The ME will
 determine the compacted density of embankments by taking the average of 5 randomly located measurements for
 each course or at a minimum of each 3-foot increment of elevation according to AASHTO T 310 (Direct
 Transmission Method).
 If any individual measurement is less than 90 percent of the maximum density, or the average is less than 95
 percent of the maximum density, continue compaction or take corrective action until the ME verifies that the
 required density is achieved.

 301.03 CONSTRUCTION
 301.03.01 Subbase
 A.
 
 Preparing Subgrade. Before placing subbase, ensure that the subgrade has been graded and compacted to within
 a tolerance of ±1/2 inch of the required elevation. The RE will check elevations of the roadbed subgrade as
 specified in 202.03.03.C. Do not prepare the subgrade during freezing weather, when frozen, or when it is
 unstable. Correct damage to the subgrade caused by construction activities and maintain the corrected subgrade
 until the subsequent course is placed.
 
 B.
 
 Spreading and Grading. Do not place subbase material when the subgrade is frozen or unstable. Notify the RE if
 the finished subgrade is unstable and obtain RE approval before removing unstable material. Backfill the area with
 suitable material and compact using the directed method as specified in 203.03.02.C.
 Spread the subbase material with equipment except in limited or restricted areas where the use of hand spreading is
 allowed. If approved by the RE, end-dump the subbase material. Spread the subbase material in a manner that
 does not break down material and eliminates segregation, ruts, and ridges.
 
 C.
 
 Compacting. Place the subbase in 8-inch maximum lifts and compact within a tolerance of ±1/2 inch of the
 required elevation. For subbase courses greater than 8 inches thick, construct the subbase course in 2 or more lifts
 of approximately equal thickness.
 Begin compacting at the sides and gradually progress to the center. On superelevated curves, compact from the
 lower to the upper edge, parallel to the centerline, and uniformly overlap each preceding track until the entire
 surface has been compacted.
 If constructing concrete base or surface courses directly on subbase, the ME will measure the compaction using the
 density control method as specified in 203.03.02.D. If constructing aggregate base course or HMA on the subbase,
 the ME will measure compaction using the control fill method as specified in 203.03.02.B.
 Correct damage to the subbase caused by construction activities, and maintain the corrected subbase until the
 subsequent course is placed. Do not allow traffic on the subbase. Remove all standing storm water and obtain the
 RE’s approval before constructing subsequent courses.

 302.03 CONSTRUCTION
 302.03.01 Aggregate Base Course
 A.
 
 Preparing Subgrade or Subbase. Before placing base course on subgrade or subbase, prepare surfaces as
 specified in 301.03.01.
 
 B.
 
 Density Control Strip. Obtain RE approval of the underlying surface before constructing the density control strip.
 Before constructing the aggregate base course, construct a density control strip using the same type of material
 from the same source as the aggregate base course. Construct additional density control strips if a change is made
 in the type or source of material, if a significant change occurs in the composition of the material from the same
 source, or if a change is made in the type of compaction equipment used, as determined by the ME. Provide at least
 400 square yards for each density control strip. Construct a density control strip for each thickness specified for the
 aggregate base course. Ensure that the moisture content for the test strip material is within 2 percent of its optimum
 moisture content according to AASHTO T 99, Method C, including replacement option.
 Place and spread aggregate base course as specified in 301.03.01.B. Place the base course and compact within a
 tolerance of ±1/2 inch of the required elevation. Ensure that no compacted lift exceeds a thickness of 8 inches. For
 base courses greater than 8 inches thick, construct the base course in 2 or more lifts of approximately equal
 thickness.
 Compact the density control strip using the same type and weight of equipment that will be used for compaction of
 the aggregate base course. Compact the density control strip with a minimum of 2 passes of the compaction
 
 124
 
 equipment. A pass is defined as 1 passage of each compacting element in use of the compaction equipment over
 the entire surface of the course. After each pass of the compaction equipment transverses the density control strip,
 the ME will make 3 density determinations according to AASHTO T 310. Continue compacting until no
 appreciable increase in density is obtained by additional passes.
 After the Contractor completes compaction of the control strip, the ME will take at least 10 density tests at random
 locations to determine the average in-place dry density of the density control strip. If the average density of the
 material in the density control strip is equal to or greater than 95 percent of its maximum density, as determined
 according to AASHTO T 99, Method C, including replacement option, then use the value of this average as the
 reference maximum density for courses of the same materials and thicknesses. Establish a density control strip
 satisfying the 95 percent density requirement, according to AASHTO T 99, Method C, before constructing
 additional base courses. If this density level in the density control strip is not achieved, the RE will reject the
 compaction equipment, its method of use, or both. If approved by the RE, the density control strips may remain in
 place and become a portion of the completed base course.
 The RE will check elevations, as specified in 202.03.03.C, of the roadbed base course to ensure that base course
 elevations are within ±1/2 inch.
 C.
 
 Aggregate Base Course Placement. Construct the aggregate base course in the same manner as the approved
 density control strip.
 If less than 500 contiguous square yards of aggregate base course is being constructed, place and spread the
 aggregate base course as specified in 301.03.01.B. Place the base course and compact within a tolerance of ±1/2
 inch of the required elevation. Compact the base course areas as specified in 203.03.02.D and ensure that no
 compacted lift exceeds a thickness of 8 inches. For base courses greater than 8 inches thick, construct the base
 course in 2 or more lifts of approximately equal thickness.
 
 D.
 
 Thickness Requirements. The RE will measure thickness, by test holes or by calculating the difference in
 elevations between the base course and the underlying layer. Refill test holes with base course material and
 recompact using the directed method as specified in 203.03.02.C.
 If the total thickness of base course differs from specified thickness by more than 1/2 inch, correct deficient areas as
 follows:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 E.
 
 Scarify the base course to a depth of 3 to 4 inches.
 Ensure that remaining material is contaminant free.
 Add or remove base course material to obtain the required grade while the existing surface is in a loose,
 scarified condition.
 Compact using the same method used for the density control strip.
 
 Compaction Acceptance Testing. The ME will divide the base course into lots of approximately 5000 square
 yards or 1000 cubic yards. The ME will test each lot of completed base course for compliance. The ME will
 determine the 5 locations for density tests using a table of random numbers. The ME will make 1 density
 determination at each of the selected locations. To determine acceptability, use the following procedure:

 305.03 CONSTRUCTION
 305.03.01 Rubblizing
 A.
 
 Existing Subsurface Facility Investigation. Obtain RE approval of the method of inspecting existing subsurface
 facilities for existing conditions. Inspect the existing subsurface facilities within the limits of rubblization.
 
 B.
 
 Installing Drainage System. Ensure that the entire underdrain system is installed at least 15 days before beginning
 rubblization.
 
 C.
 
 Removing Existing HMA Surfaces. Before beginning rubblization, remove existing HMA overlays and HMA
 surface patches from the concrete pavement surfaces to be rubblized. Remove existing full-depth HMA repairs and
 fill the void with DGA.
 
 D.
 
 Sawcutting Joints. If the limit of the rubblization is not at an existing joint, or if the concrete being rubblized
 abuts concrete pavement to be rubblized in a subsequent stage, sawcut the concrete full-depth.
 
 E.
 
 Rubblization Plan. Submit a rubblization plan to the RE 15 days before beginning rubblizing operations that
 includes the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 6.
 7.
 8.
 
 Condition of existing subsurface facilities as determined in 305.03.01.A.
 Rubblization method and associated equipment.
 Seating method and associated equipment.
 Rubblizing and paving sequence for the Project.
 Method for locating grade corrections and placing DGA as specified in 305.03.01.J.
 Method for protecting subsurface facilities.
 Dust mitigation measures.
 Method for performing a survey of the condition of the existing subsurface facilities after the
 rubblization operations.
 
 Do not begin test strip until the RE accepts this plan. Submit an adjusted rubblization plan before making
 adjustments to the operation.
 F.
 
 Test Strip. Before beginning rubblization, the RE will designate a 500-foot long, full lane width, or an area of
 approximately 600 square yards, for the test strip. Rubblize the test strip using varying intensities of energy until a
 technique is established that will rubblize the pavement as specified. At a location determined by the RE, excavate
 a full depth, 3-foot wide test pit for the full width of the test strip to determine that the breaker is producing pieces
 of the specified sizes. The RE may require additional test holes. Use DGA to backfill excavated areas. Place DGA
 in lifts and compact using the density control method as specified in 203.03.02.D.
 If required results are not being obtained, cease rubblizing operations and submit an alternate rubblization plan
 capable of obtaining the specified results to the RE. Resume rubblizing operations upon acceptance of the alternate
 plan. Repeat this procedure as necessary to obtain the specified results.
 
 G.
 
 Rubblizing. Rubblize the pavement full-depth in a manner that eliminates all slab action by fracturing into pieces
 3 inches or less in any dimension in the top third of the pavement and 12 inches or less in any dimension in the
 bottom two-thirds of the pavement. Prevent rubblized debris from entering an active traffic lane.
 Rubblize in partial widths when necessary to maintain traffic as shown on the plans. In areas where the roadway
 must be overlaid 1 lane at a time, extend initial rubblization a minimum of 6 inches beyond the width of the
 pavement to be overlaid.
 For the resonant method begin at a free edge or previously broken edge and progress toward the opposite shoulder
 or longitudinal centerline of the road. When necessary, overlap passes to achieve rubblization.
 Continuously monitor rubblization to ensure that the operation is achieving the specified results. Notify the RE of
 adjustments that may be required. The RE may require additional test holes to ensure that pieces are free of bond
 with reinforcement and to ensure that the pavement is being rubblized to the specific dimensions.
 
 H.
 
 Seating. Seat rubblized pavement with rollers operating at a speed not exceeding 2-1/2 miles per hour. Seat
 rubblized pavement using the applicable method:
 
 129
 
 1.
 
 Resonant Method. Roll the rubblized pavement with a minimum of 3 passes over the entire width of the
 rubblized pavement with a vibratory roller.
 
 2.
 
 Multi-Head Method. Roll the entire width of the rubblized pavement with 2 passes of a “Z-Grid” roller,
 followed by 2 passes of a smooth drum vibratory roller.
 
 The RE may require additional passes in order to seat the rubblized pavement and provide a smooth surface that is
 ready for the HMA overlay. If the rubblized pavement becomes unstable due to excess moisture, cease rolling until
 the RE allows the operation to resume.
 I.
 
 Removing Exposed Reinforcement Steel and Transverse Joint Assemblies. For reinforced concrete pavement,
 leave debonded reinforcement steel in place unless exposed. Cut exposed reinforcement steel 1 inch below the
 surface and remove. Remove exposed transverse joint assemblies. Remove exposed joint filler, expansion
 materials, or other similar items. Patch deficiencies left by removing joint assemblies as specified in 305.03.01.J.
 
 J.
 
 Patching and Leveling with DGA. At the direction of the RE, remove unstable material full depth and replace
 with DGA. Compact DGA in lifts using the directed method as specified in 203.03.02.C.
 If the seated rubblized pavement is more than 1-1/2 inch below grade, correct with DGA as approved by the RE.
 Place DGA and compact using the directed method as specified in 203.03.02.C.
 
 K.
 
 Repairing Subsurface Facilities. If damage occurs to subsurface facilities during rubblization, immediately cease
 operations, notify the RE, and repair the damage as directed by the RE.
 
 L.
 
 Final Subsurface Facility Survey. Perform a final survey of the subsurface facilities after completion of
 rubblization and submit to the RE. Repair damage as directed by the RE.
 
 M. Protecting Rubblized Pavement from Damage. Protect the rubblized pavement from contamination and damage.
 Correct areas of the rubblized pavement damaged by construction operations or contamination before placing
 HMA. Only allow equipment on the rubblized pavement that is necessary for the construction of the subsequent
 pavement course.
 Ensure that no more than 48 hours elapse between rubblizing the pavement and the placement of the first lift of the
 HMA overlay. If precipitation occurs before placing the HMA overlay, the RE may extend the time restriction to
 allow the rubblized pavement to dry.

 401.03 CONSTRUCTION
 401.03.01 Preparing Existing Pavement
 A.
 
 Milling of HMA. Mill HMA to the specified depth, profile, and cross slope. Operate milling machine to produce
 milled material that passes a 3-inch sieve. Use automatic grade controls to control the line and grade of the milling
 machine. Use either a stringline or ski reference system. Replace teeth in the milling drum that become dislodged,
 broken, or unevenly worn. Perform milling operation, including removal of the milled material, in a manner that
 prevents dust and other particulate matter from escaping into the air.
 
 131
 
 Ensure that the milled area is free from gouges, continuous grooves, ridges, and delaminated areas and has a
 uniform texture consisting of discontinuous longitudinal striations. Ensure that the striations do not deviate more
 than 1 inch in 200 feet from a line parallel to the center of the traveled way and do not exceed 3/8 inch in depth.
 Check at least every 25 feet to ensure that the depth of milling is within 1/4 inch of the indicated depth.
 Mill HMA to the depth specified without damaging underlying HMA. If HMA below the specified milling level
 becomes dislodged or delaminated, remove and replace.
 When profile milling, ensure the cutting depth is sufficient to remove ruts and corrugations and to scarify the
 remaining surface.
 Using a mechanical sweeper, clean the milled area before opening to traffic and before subsequent construction or
 resurfacing. Reuse millings and sweepings as specified in 202.03.07.A.
 If the milled area is opened to traffic, ensure that water can drain from the surface and does not become trapped. If
 the longitudinal edge height of a milled surface exceeds 2 inches, slope the edge to provide a smooth transition
 from the milled surface to the remaining pavement. At transverse edges of milled areas, provide a smooth
 transition from the milled surface to the remaining pavement.
 In areas inaccessible to the milling machine, remove HMA with other equipment.
 The Department will provide the time interval for resurfacing the milled areas in the Special Provisions.
 B.
 
 Milling of Concrete. Mill concrete pavement to 1-inch depth at the locations shown on the Plans without
 damaging the underlying pavement. Ensure that the milled area is free from gouges, continuous grooves, ridges,
 and delaminated areas and has a uniform texture consisting of discontinuous longitudinal striations. Ensure that the
 striations do not deviate more than 1 inch in 200 feet from a line parallel to the center of the traveled way and do
 not exceed 3/8 inch in depth. Perform milling operations, including removal of the milled material, in a manner
 that prevents dust and other particulate matter from escaping into the air.
 Mill 1 inch of concrete and any remaining HMA not removed by previous milling operations at locations shown on
 the Plans. Based on the condition of the remaining pavement, the RE may direct additional areas to be milled.
 If milling transition areas for HMA overlays, mill the transition from 0 to 1 inch in depth over a length of 100 feet.
 Construct a keyway at the terminal transverse limit of the area to be milled by sawcutting and removing the
 material within this area by hand methods so as to produce a vertical face.
 Using a mechanical sweeper, clean the milled area before opening to traffic and before subsequent construction or
 resurfacing. Reuse millings and sweepings as specified in 202.03.07.A.
 If the milled area is opened to traffic, ensure that water can drain from the surface and does not become trapped. If
 the longitudinal edge height of a milled surface exceeds 2 inches, slope the edge to provide a smooth transition
 from the milled surface to the remaining pavement. At transverse edges of milled areas, provide a smooth
 transition from the milled surface to the remaining pavement.
 In areas inaccessible to the milling machine, remove concrete with other equipment.
 
 C.
 
 Sealing Cracks in HMA Surface Course. Seal cracks that are 1/4 inch wide or wider. Clean cracks to a depth of
 1 inch using a random crack saw, carbide-tipped, rotary-impact router, commercial power-driven wire brush, or by
 other RE approved means. Provide acceptable protective screening if the cleaning operation causes damage to or
 interference with traffic in adjacent lanes.
 Immediately before applying sealant, clean cracks and dry further with a hot-air lance.
 At least 10 day before beginning the work, submit to the RE a copy of the manufacturer’s recommendations for
 heating and applying the sealant. Seal cracks with hot-poured joint sealant according to the manufacturer’s
 recommendations. Cut sealant into small pieces to facilitate slow and uniform melting with constant stirring.
 Ensure that the temperature of the sealant in the field application equipment does not exceed the recommended safe
 heating temperature. Do not heat sealant material at the pouring temperature for more than 6 hours and do not
 reheat.
 Pour sealant into the cracks so that, upon completion of the work, the surface of the sealant is flush with or not
 more than 1/4 inch lower than the surface of the adjacent HMA surface course. If the sealant subsides to a lower
 level, perform another pouring. When more than 1 pour is required to fill the cracks, perform succeeding pours
 132
 
 immediately after shrinkage of the previous pouring. If spilling or overfilling occurs, immediately squeegee the
 crack. If the RE determines that the overfilled crack or spilled sealant creates a slippery, hazardous, or otherwise
 undesirable condition, initially correct the area by sprinkling a light application of abrasive (sand or grit material) to
 absorb the excess material, restore skid-resistance, and abate the condition caused by the overpour. After the
 excess material has been absorbed, hand sweep the area clean, and restore to its original condition or texture to the
 RE’s satisfaction.
 Do not allow traffic or construction equipment over the poured cracks until the sealant has hardened sufficiently to
 resist pickup. The RE may direct sprinkling of dry sand over poured areas to provide additional pickup resistance.
 D.
 
 Repairing HMA Pavement. Sawcut existing HMA pavement to a maximum depth of 10 inches, or to the full
 depth of bound layers, whichever is less. Sawcut lines parallel and perpendicular to the roadway baseline and 3
 inches away, at the closest point, from the damaged area to be repaired. For larger areas, the Contractor may use a
 milling machine for removal of HMA pavement.
 Remove material within the boundary of the sawcuts to form rectangular openings with vertical sides, and clean the
 area. Shape and compact the underlying surface to produce a firm, level base. Ensure that the remaining pavement
 is not damaged.
 Apply polymerized joint adhesive or tack coat to the vertical surfaces of the openings. Backfill with HMA as
 specified for the roadway surface. Ensure that the temperature of the HMA when placed is at least 250 °F, and
 compact as specified in 401.03.03.F. Compact areas not accessible to rollers with a vibratory drum. Compact until
 the top of the patch is flush with the adjacent pavement surface.
 Reuse removed material as specified in 202.03.07.A.
 
 401.03.02 Tack Coat and Prime Coat
 Clean the surface where the HMA is to be placed of foreign and loose material. Immediately before beginning paving
 operations, ensure that the surface is dry. Do not place tack coat or prime coat unless the weather restrictions, as
 specified in 401.03.03.B, are met.
 Do not apply tack coat or prime coat to asphalt-stabilized drainage course.
 For curbs, gutters, manholes, and other similar structures, do not apply tack coat or prime coat. Clean the exposed
 surfaces of these structures and apply a uniform coating of polymerized joint adhesive to contact surfaces before paving.
 In areas inaccessible to distributor spray bars, use hand spraying equipment for tack and prime coat. Do not allow traffic
 on tack coated or prime coated surfaces. Treat surfaces as follows:
 1.
 
 Tack Coat. Uniformly spray tack coat when placing HMA on paved surfaces. Apply tack coat only to areas
 to be paved in the same day. Apply tack coat as specified in Table 401.03.02-1:

 Correct uncoated or lightly coated areas. Blot areas showing an excess of tack coat with sand or other similar
 material. Remove blotting material before paving. Ensure that the material is not streaked or ribboned.
 Before paving, allow tack coat to cure to a condition that is tacky to the touch.
 2.
 
 Tack Coat 64-22. When precipitation has occurred within 24 hours before application, the RE will determine
 whether to allow the work to proceed, or to wait until the surface is completely dry. Only apply tack coat that
 can be paved over in the same day. Apply tack coat 64-22 at a rate of 0.06 to 0.14 gallons per square yard and
 
 133
 
 at a spraying temperature of 325 °F. Adjust the spraying temperature and application rate to produce a
 uniform coating, with no excess material.

 Apply prime coat at least 12 hours before placement of the HMA and when the base courses are not saturated
 or frozen. Unless the prime coat is under asphalt-stabilized drainage course, the RE may waive the
 application of prime coat if more than 5 inches of HMA is placed on the unbound aggregate course before the
 roadway is opened to traffic. Take measures to prevent prime coat from entering into the drainage system or
 extending beyond the area to be paved.

 When placing HMA, ensure that the base temperature meets the minimum temperature requirements specified in
 Table 401.03.03-1.

 Test Strip. Construct a test strip for contracts with more than 5500 tons of HMA. Test strips are not necessary for
 temporary pavement. Ensure that the tack coat or prime coat has been placed as specified in 401.03.02, before
 placing HMA. Transport and deliver, spread and grade, and compact as specified in 401.03.03.D, 401.03.03.E, and
 401.03.03.F, respectively, and according to the approved paving plan. Construct a test strip for the first 700 to
 1200 square yards placed for each job mix formula. While constructing the test strip, record the following
 information and submit to the RE:
 1.
 
 Ambient Temperature. Measure ambient temperature at the beginning and end of each day’s paving
 operation.
 
 2.
 
 Base Temperature. Measure the surface temperature of the existing base before paving.
 
 3.
 
 HMA Temperature. Measure the temperature of the HMA immediately after placement.
 
 4.
 
 Roller Pattern. Provide details on the number of rollers, type, and number of passes used on the test strip.
 
 5.
 
 Nuclear Density Gauge Readings. Obtain the maximum density from the plant, and input it into the nuclear
 density gauge. Use the nuclear density gauge to read the bulk density and percent air voids.
 
 6.
 
 Quality Control Core Density Test Results. Take 5 randomly selected quality control cores to test for the
 bulk specific gravity and the maximum specific gravity.
 Use drilling equipment with a water-cooled, diamond-tipped, masonry drill bit that shall produce 6-inch
 nominal diameter cores for the full depth of the pavement. Remove the core from the pavement without
 damaging it. After removing the core, remove all water from the hole. Fill the hole with HMA or cold
 patching material, and compact the material so that it is 1/4 inch above the surrounding pavement surface.
 Compare the nuclear density gauge readings and the core test results to establish a correlation. Use this
 correlation as a guide for the continued use of the nuclear density gauge for density control.
 
 Upon completion of the test strip, the Contractor may continue paving. If the Contractor does not continue paving,
 the Department will accept the test strip as 1 lot regardless of size.
 If the test strip does not meet requirements, make adjustments and construct a second test strip. If the second test
 strip does not meet requirements, suspend paving operations until written approval to proceed is received.
 Before making adjustments to the paving operations, notify the RE in writing.
 D.
 
 Transportation and Delivery of HMA. Deliver HMA using HMA trucks in sufficient quantities and at such
 intervals to allow continuous placement of the material. Do not allow trucks to leave the plant within 1 hour of
 sunset unless nighttime lighting is provided as specified in 108.06. The RE will reject HMA if the HMA trucks
 meet the requirements specified in 1009.02. The RE will suspend construction operations if the Contractor fails to
 maintain a continuous paving operation. Before the truck leaves the plant, obtain a weigh ticket from a fully
 automatic scale. Before unloading, submit for each truckload a legible weigh ticket that includes the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 6.
 7.
 
 Name and location of the HMA plant.
 Project title.
 Load time and date.
 Truck number.
 Mix designation.
 Plant lot number.
 Tare, gross, and net weight.
 
 A certified weighmaster shall sign and affix a seal to the weigh tickets.
 In the event of breakdown of an automatic printer system, the RE will accept weigh tickets showing the tare, gross,
 and net weight of each truck, as entered and certified by a weighmaster for a period not exceeding the necessary
 repair time as certified by a licensed repairman.
 When using an automated batching plant, obtain weigh tickets from the printer used in conjunction with an
 automated batching and mixing system. The printed ticket shall show the individual weights of the various
 components of the HMA in a batch, the total weight of each batch, and the sum of all batch weights in the
 truckload. At the completion of each day’s work, a producer’s representative shall certify that the total net weight
 supplied to each Contract was correct.
 135
 
 E.
 
 Spreading and Grading. If using a stringline reference system, ensure that the system is in place and approved by
 the RE before placing HMA. Ensure that the underlying surface meets line and grade as specified in 202.03.03.C.
 Before placing HMA, ensure that the tack coat or prime coat has been placed as specified in 401.03.02. Obtain RE
 approval of the underlying surface far enough in advance of spreading HMA to allow 1 day’s paving operations.
 Ensure that the certified APCT is present during paving operations.
 Ensure that an MTV independently delivers HMA from the HMA trucks to the HMA paver.
 Before beginning, ensure that the temperature of the screed on the HMA paver is heated to at least the laydown
 temperature of the HMA. Using the MTVs and HMA pavers, construct paving courses in lifts of at least 4 times
 the nominal maximum aggregate size of the HMA being constructed. Ensure that the grade and profile are
 maintained.
 Where directed, use HMA having a nominal maximum aggregate size of 3/8 inch or less in transition (run out)
 areas. On areas where irregularities or unavoidable obstacles make use of a paver impractical, spread, rake, and
 lute HMA with hand tools. For these areas, dump, spread, and screed the HMA to obtain the required compacted
 thickness.
 Construct joints as follows:
 1.
 
 Longitudinal Joints. Perform paving with the spring-loaded end plates of the paver in the “down” position.
 The longitudinal joint in 1 lift shall offset that in the lift immediately below by approximately 6 inches. Offset
 the joint in the surface course from the lane lines by 6 inches. When constructing a joint between lanes of
 opposing traffic, offset the joint by 6 inches into either lane.
 a.
 
 Echelon Paving. If a single paver does not spread the HMA the entire width of the roadway, use 2 or
 more pavers in echelon. Ensure that the trailing paver follows within 300 feet of the lead paver. Extend
 the screed and end gate of the trailing paver 1 inch over the uncompacted HMA placed by the lead paver.
 Ensure that the uncompacted HMA elevation from the trailing paver is equal to that from the lead paver
 at the joint. The Contractor may construct either a butt joint or a wedge joint. Do not rake the joint.
 
 b.
 
 Cold Joint Paving. If echelon paving is not possible, construct the pavement using cold longitudinal
 joints. When constructing the first lane, compact so the line and grade of the edges of the HMA are not
 displaced. Construct longitudinal joints parallel to the centerlines within a tolerance of ±3 inches per
 100 linear feet. If this tolerance is not met, trim or mill the edge of the HMA mat as necessary. Before
 paving the abutting lane, ensure longitudinal joints are free from dust and debris.
 For surface course only, uniformly apply polymerized joint adhesive to longitudinal cold joint. Apply a
 1/8-inch thick coating of polymerized joint adhesive over the entire joint face. Apply slowly to ensure
 an even coating thickness.
 When maintaining traffic with a lift thickness greater than 2-1/4 inches, construct a wedge joint. The RE
 will permit a butt joint for lift thickness 2-1/4 inches or less when maintaining traffic, or for lift thickness
 greater than 2-1/4 inches when maintaining traffic is not required. Maintain a uniform width and depth
 of overlapped material at all times. Position the paver so that the HMA overlaps the edge of the lane
 previously placed by 1 to 2 inches. Leave the material sufficiently high to allow for compaction. Lute
 back overlapped material, pushing the material off of the cold HMA and onto the hot HMA mat directly
 over the joint. Remove excess material instead of broadcasting it across the new lift.
 When compacted, ensure that the new mat at the joint is even or slightly higher (maximum 1/8 inch)
 than the previously placed adjoining mat. If the newly compacted mat results in a depression at the joint
 of 1/8 inch or more lower than the previously placed adjacent HMA lift, suspend all paving operations
 until corrective action is taken to prevent reoccurrence.
 
 2.
 
 Transverse Joints. Construct transverse joints to provide a smooth riding surface. When using a bulkhead to
 form the joint, ensure that the bulkhead forms a straight line and vertical face. If a bulkhead is not used to
 form the joint, make the joint by sawing the compacted HMA for a sufficient distance behind the end of the
 placement to ensure full thickness and a smooth surface at the joint. Remove the full lift thickness of HMA
 ahead of the sawed joint. In either case, paint the joint face with polymerized joint adhesive before the fresh
 material is placed against it. Unless prohibited by field conditions, cross roll to obtain thorough compaction
 of these joints.
 
 136
 
 F.
 
 Compacting. Compact with the minimum number of rollers as specified in the Table 401.03.03-2.
 Table 401.03.03-2 Compaction Requirements

 Orient the drive axles of the roller towards the paver during compaction operation. Operate rollers at a slow,
 uniform speed not exceeding 2-1/2 miles per hour. If necessary to prevent adhesion of the HMA to the rollers, keep
 the wheels moistened with water mixed with very small quantities of detergent.
 Begin compacting at the sides and progress gradually to the center. On superelevated curves, compact from the
 lower to the upper edge parallel to the centerline and uniformly overlap each preceding track until the entire surface
 has been compacted.
 Continue rolling until roller marks are eliminated and the air voids conform to the specified requirements.
 Along forms, curbs, headers, walls, and other places not accessible to the rollers, compact the HMA by a vibratory
 drum compactor.
 Remove and replace HMA that becomes loose, broken, or otherwise defective or that shows an excess or deficiency
 of asphalt binder material.
 When paving in echelon, keep the rollers for the first lane approximately 6 inches from the unconfined edge
 adjacent to the second paving operation. After HMA from the second paver is placed against the uncompacted
 edge of the mat from the first paver, compact the HMA on both sides of the joint.
 Prevent lateral or vertical displacement of the unconfined edge during the compaction operation. Ensure that the
 edge of the drums of the rollers extends over the free edge of the mat by at least 6 inches.
 When compacting the butt or wedge joint, while paving the adjacent lane, place the roller on the newly placed
 HMA and overlap the joint by approximately 6 inches.
 If a test strip was not required, establish a correlation between the nuclear density gauge and the cores as specified
 in 401.03.03.C.6. To adjust correlation with the thin lift nuclear density gauge, take 1 additional core every week
 during the paving operation. The RE may approve additional coring with valid cause presented by the Contractor.
 On a weekly basis, provide results of both the nuclear density and core testing to the RE. Provide core and nuclear
 density results that include the bulk specific gravity, the maximum specific gravity according to AASHTO T 209,
 and the percent air voids. Failure to submit the core and nuclear density test results from the previous week’s
 paving will result in suspended paving operations.
 G.
 
 Opening to Traffic. Remove loose material from the traveled way, shoulder, and auxiliary lanes before opening to
 traffic. Open HMA courses to traffic or construction equipment, including paving equipment, only after the surface
 temperatures meet the following requirements:
 1.
 2.
 
 H.
 
 When using PG 64-22 or PG 70-22, do not allow traffic or construction equipment on the HMA course
 until the surface temperature is less than 140 °F.
 When using PG 76-22, do not allow traffic or construction equipment on the HMA course until the
 surface temperature is less than 170 °F.
 
 Air Void Requirements. Mainline lots are defined as the area covered by a day’s paving production of the same
 job mixed formula between 1000 and 4000 tons for the traveled way and auxiliary lanes. The RE will combine
 daily production areas less than 1000 tons with previous or subsequent production areas to meet the minimum lot
 requirements. When the maximum lot requirement is exceeded in a day’s production, the RE will divide the area of
 HMA placed into 2 lots with approximately equal areas.
 Ramp pavement lots are defined as approximately 10,000 square yards of pavement in ramps. The RE may
 combine ramps with less than the minimum area into a single lot. If 2 or more ramps are included in a single lot,
 the RE will require additional cores to ensure that at least 1 core is taken from each ramp.
 
 137
 
 Other pavement lots are defined as approximately 10,000 square yards of pavement in shoulders and other
 undefined areas.
 The ME will calculate the percent defective (PD) as the percentage of the lot outside the acceptable range of 2
 percent air voids to 8 percent air voids. The acceptable quality limit is 10 percent defective. For lots in which
 PD < 10, the Department will award a positive pay adjustment. For lots in which PD > 10, the Department will
 assess a negative pay adjustment.
 The ME will determine air voids from 5 cores taken from each lot in random locations. The ME will determine air
 voids of cores from the values for the maximum specific gravity of the mix and the bulk specific gravity of the
 core. The ME will determine the maximum specific gravity of the mix according to NJDOT B-3 and AASHTO T
 209, except that minimum sample size may be waived in order to use a 6-inch diameter core sample. The ME will
 determine the bulk specific gravity of the compacted mixture by testing each core according to AASHTO T 166.
 The ME will calculate pay adjustments based on the following:
 1.

 Outlier Detection. The ME will screen all acceptance cores for outliers using a statistically valid procedure.
 If an outlier is detected, replace that core by taking an additional core at the same offset and within 5 feet of
 the original station. The following procedure applies only for a sample size of 5.
 
 138
 
 1.

 The ME will arrange the 5 core results in ascending order, in which X1 represents the smallest
 value and X5 represents the largest value.
 If X5 is suspected of being an outlier, the ME will calculate:
 R =

 If X1 is suspected of being an outlier, the ME will calculate:

 If R > 0.642, the value is judged to be statistically significant and the core is excluded.
 
 6.
 
 Retest. If the initial series of 5 cores produces a percent defective value of PD ≥ 30 for mainline or ramp lots,
 or PD ≥ 50 for other pavement lots, the Contractor may elect to take an additional set of 5 cores at random
 locations chosen by the ME. Take the additional cores within 15 days of receipt of the initial core results. If
 the additional cores are not taken within the 15 days, the ME will use the initial core results to determine the
 PPA. If the additional cores are taken, the ME will recalculate the PPA using the combined results from the
 10 cores.
 
 7.
 
 Removal and Replacement. If the final lot PD ≥ 75 (based on the combined set of 10 cores or 5 cores if the
 Contractor does not take additional cores), remove and replace the lot and all overlying work. The
 replacement work is subject to the same requirements as the initial work.
 
 Thickness Requirements. Thickness requirements will apply when full-depth, uniform-thickness HMA pavement
 construction is shown. The size and the assigned number of thickness lots will match those of the surface course
 air void lots. The RE will not include areas consisting of different HMA mixtures or thicknesses in the same lot.
 The ME will test for thickness using the full-depth cores taken for surface course air voids, evaluated according to
 NJDOT B-4. The ME will base acceptance on total thickness and thickness of the surface course.
 1.
 
 Total Thickness. The ME will calculate the percent defective (PD) as the percentage of the lot that is less
 than the design thickness. The ME will consider 10 percent defective as the acceptable quality limit. For lots
 where PD < 10, the Department will award a positive pay adjustment. For lots where PD > 10, the
 Department will assess a negative pay adjustment.
 The Department will base total thickness acceptance on the percentage of the lot estimated to fall below the
 specified thickness as follows:
 a.
 
 Sample Mean ( X ) and Standard Deviation (S) of the N Test Results (X1, X2,..., XN). Calculate as
 specified in 401.03.03.H.1.
 
 b.
 
 Quality Index (QI).
 QL = ( X − Tdes)/S, and Tdes is the design thickness.
 
 c.
 
 Percent Defective (PD). Using NJDOT ST for the appropriate sample size, determine the percentage of
 material (PD) falling below the design thickness associated with QL (lower limit).
 
 d.
 
 Percent Pay Adjustment (PPA). The Department will determine the pay adjustment based on the
 quantity of the surface course × PPA.

 Retest. If the initial series of 5 cores produces a percent defective value of PD ≥ 30, the Contractor may
 elect to take an additional set of 5 cores at random locations chosen by the RE. Take the additional cores
 within 15 days of receipt of the initial core results. If the additional cores are not taken within the 15
 139
 
 days, the ME will use the initial core results to determine the PPA. If the additional cores are taken, the
 ME will recalculate the PPA using the combined results from the 10 cores.
 f.
 
 2.
 
 Removal and Replacement. If the final lot PD ≥ 75 (based on the combined set of 10 cores or 5 cores
 if the Contractor does not take additional cores), remove and replace, or mill and overlay, the lot. The
 replacement work is subject to the same requirements as the initial work.
 
 Surface Course Thickness. The ME will evaluate the surface course solely to determine whether a removeand-replace or an overlay condition exists, not for pay adjustment. The ME will calculate the percent
 defective (PD) as the percentage of the lot that is less than the allowable thickness for the nominal maximum
 aggregate used in the surface course. The ME will accept pavement lots with PD ≤ 10 and will reject
 pavement lots with PD > 10.
 The ME will base surface thickness acceptance on the percentage of the lot estimated to fall below the
 allowable thickness as follows:
 a.
 
 Sample Mean ( X ) and Standard Deviation (S) of the N Test Results (X1, X2,..., XN). Calculate using
 the formula as specified in 401.03.03.H.1.

 take an additional 5 cores at random locations determined by the ME. Take the additional cores within
 15 days of receipt of the initial core results. If the additional cores are not taken within the 15 days, the
 ME will use the initial core results to determine the PPA. When the additional cores are taken, the ME
 will recalculate the PPA using the combined results from the 10 cores to obtain the total PD.
 
 e.
 
 Removal and Replacement. If the surface course fails to meet the acceptance requirement, the
 Department will require removal and replacement of the lot. The replacement work is subject to the
 same requirements as the initial work.
 
 Ride Quality Requirements. The Department will evaluate the HMA surface course using the International
 Roughness Index (IRI) according to ASTM E 1926. The Department will use the measured IRI to compute the
 appropriate pay adjustment (PA). The PA may be positive for superior quality work or negative for defective work.
 The Department will calculate the PA as specified in Table 401.03.03-7 and will base PA on lots of 0.01mile length
 for each lane, ramp, and shoulder.
 1.
 
 Smoothness Measurement. The Department will test the longitudinal profile of the HMA surface course for
 ride quality with a Class 1 Inertial Profiling System according to AASHTO MP 11 approved according to
 AASHTO PP 49.
 The Department will test the full extent of the pavement in the direction of travel in each wheel path. The
 single IRI value reported for each 0.01-mile lot of pavement is the average of 3 runs.
 
 2.
 
 Control Testing. Perform control testing during HMA placement to ensure compliance with the ride quality
 requirements specified in Table 401.03.03-7.
 
 3.
 
 Preparation for IRI Testing. Provide the necessary traffic control when the Department performs IRI
 testing. Perform required mechanical sweeping of the surface course before IRI testing. To facilitate auto
 triggering on laser profilers, place a single line of preformed traffic marking tape perpendicular to the
 
 140
 
 roadway baseline at the beginning and end of each lane, shoulder, and ramp to be tested. Submit the actual
 stationing for each traffic marking tape location to the RE.
 4.
 
 Acceptance.
 following:
 a.
 
 The Department will determine acceptance and make payment adjustments based on the
 
 Pay Adjustment. The pay equations in Table 401.03.03-7 express the pay adjustment in dollars per lot
 of 0.01 mile. For lots of any other length, the Department will scale the pay adjustment up or down in
 proportion to the actual length of the lot. IRI numbers are in inches per mile.

 Retest provision. After testing, if the IRI exceeds the Remove and Replace value (RRV) in Table
 401.03.03-7, the Department will retest the lot. The Department will average the IRI values from the
 initial test and the retest to determine the final result.
 If there is definitive evidence that the initial test is invalid, the Department will disregard the initial test
 and will consider the retest as the initial test. If there is no evidence that the original test was invalid, the
 Department will average the IRI values from the initial test and the retest to determine the final result.
 
 141
 
 c.
 
 Removal and Replacement. If the average IRI is greater than the RRV after a retest is performed,
 remove and replace the lot. Any replacement work is subject to the same requirements as the initial
 work.
 On contracts where only a small percentage (less than 8 percent) of paving lots falls under the RRV, the
 Department may allow the Contractor to submit a plan for corrective action. If the Contractor’s plan for
 corrective action is not approved, the Department may require removal and replacement, or may allow
 the lot to remain in place and the lot will be subject to the pay adjustment as computed in Table
 401.03.03-7. If the Contractor’s plan for corrective action is approved and the lot is reworked, the
 Department will test and evaluate it as a new lot that must meet the same requirements as the initial
 work. Corrective action locations are not eligible for bonus payments.
 
 401.03.04 Sawcutting and Sealing of Joints in HMA Overlays
 Before paving over concrete pavement, identify joint locations and maintain references throughout paving operations.
 Ensure that the HMA overlay is sawcut directly over the existing concrete pavement joints. Make sawcuts between 1
 and 5 days after placement of the overlay.
 Existing transverse joints that are offset at the longitudinal joint by more than 1 inch, measured between the centers of
 the joints, require separate sawcuts terminating at the longitudinal joint. For full-depth HMA replacement of an
 underlying concrete slab, sawcut the overlay directly over the HMA/slab interfaces.
 Sawcut as specified in Table 401.03.04-1:
 Table 401.03.04-1 Sawcuts in HMA Overlays
 Total Overlay Thickness (t), inches
 
 Width of cut, inches
 
 Depth of cut, inches
 
 t<6
 t≥6
 
 1/4 to 3/8
 1/4 to 3/8
 
 2
 4
 
 Sawcut the transverse joints the full width of the traveled way and 3 feet into the shoulder.
 If the surface course is not to be constructed within 30 days of placing the base or intermediate course, within 5 days,
 make a 1/8-inch wide sawcut 2 inches deep over the joints. The RE will not require sealing or cleaning of these sawcuts.
 When placing the surface course, make a 1/4 to 3/8-inch sawcut the full depth of the surface course. If cracks appear in a
 base or intermediate course before placing the surface course, sawcut the surface course directly over the crack, rather
 than directly over the joint.
 After sawcutting, immediately collect the slurry from the sawcut cavity and surrounding pavement surface and dispose
 of as specified 201.03.09. Clean sawcuts with a 150-pounds-per-square-inch water blast to remove remaining debris in
 the sawcut cavity, and then blow sawcuts with a hot-air lance to provide a dry surface. Immediately after blowing, seal
 sawcuts.
 Seal joints with hot-poured joint sealer prepared according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Do not heat joint
 sealer at the pouring temperature for more than 6 hours and do not reheat. Fill the sawcuts so that after cooling the level
 of the sealer is not more than 1/4 inch above, or less than 1/8 inch below, the surface. Do not spread sand or other fine
 material on the sealed joints. Before opening to traffic, allow joint sealer to cure to prevent pickup.
 401.03.05 Core Samples
 Upon completion of an HMA lot, drill cores at random locations determined by the RE at least 12 hours after paving.
 Take cores in the presence of the RE.
 Use drilling equipment with a water-cooled, diamond-tipped, masonry drill bit that shall produce 6-inch nominal
 diameter cores for the full depth of the pavement. Remove the core from the pavement without damaging it. After
 removing the core, remove all water from the hole. Fill the hole with HMA or cold patching material, and compact the
 material so that it is 1/4 inch above the surrounding pavement surface.
 For test strip lots and the first traveled way lot, deliver cores within 48 hours of completing the lot. Deliver all other
 acceptance cores within 7 days of completing the lot.
 
 142
 
 After each air void lot is placed, drill cores so that the full depth of the course is recovered for air void acceptance
 testing. If thickness acceptance testing is required as specified in 401.03.03.I, drill the surface course air void cores for
 the full depth of pavement. The Department will test the full-depth cores for surface course air voids, surface course
 thickness, and total thickness.
 Mark the Department assigned core number on the side of the sample. Place cores and corresponding forms in a
 ventilated container capable of being locked and sealed by the RE. Ensure that the container provides protection to
 prevent damage during transit. Before sealing the container, the RE will record the seal number on the laboratory form.
 Transport the sealed boxes to the Department Laboratory.
 The Department will not accept damaged cores for testing. If the Department rejects any core, drill a replacement core at
 the same offset and within 5 feet of the original station and deliver to the laboratory within 48 hours.

 405.03.01 Underlayer Preparation
 When placing concrete on an aggregate base or subbase, prepare the underlying surface to ±1/2 inch of the required
 elevation within 3 days of placing concrete. Do not grade and compact the underlying surface when the ambient
 temperature is below 34 °F, when frozen, or when it is unstable. Compact using the directed method, as specified in
 203.03.02.C, to produce a firm and even surface. The RE will check the elevations as specified in 202.03.03.C. Correct
 damage to the underlying surface and maintain the corrected surface until the concrete is placed.
 Immediately before placing concrete, spray the underlying surface with water to ensure that the underlying surface is
 damp to a depth of at least 1/2 inch without forming wet or unstable spots.
 405.03.02 Concrete Surface Course

 B.
 
 Weather Limitations. Comply with the limitations of placing as specified in 504.03.02.C, except do not place
 concrete when the ambient temperature is above 85 °F. If within the 12 hours preceding the scheduled concrete
 placement the National Weather Service (refer to http://www.nws.noaa.gov/) locally forecasts a 40 percent chance
 or greater of precipitation during the scheduled concrete placement, postpone the placement of bridge decks and
 pavement.
 
 C.
 
 Installing Longitudinal Joint Ties. If paving adjacent to existing concrete pavement, drill 9-inch-deep holes into
 the side of the existing slab. Clean holes with a 150-pounds-per-square-inch water blast to remove remaining
 
 149
 
 debris in the drilled cavity, and then blow out holes with a hot-air lance to provide a dry surface. Immediately after
 blowing, fill the hole with epoxy grout and insert the joint ties according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Support the joint ties in position until the grout has set.
 D.
 
 Concrete Placing Methods. Appoint sufficient number of personnel, who are certified by the NJACI as Concrete
 Construction Technologist or by ACI as Concrete Transportation Construction Inspectors, to monitor daily
 operations for concrete placement. The certified personnel are responsible for ensuring proper dimensions of
 forms; position of reinforcement steel; proper handling, placement, consolidation, and finishing of concrete; and
 proper curing of the concrete.
 When placing concrete on asphalt-stabilized drainage course, spread sand over the surface to ensure that the surface
 voids are filled.
 1.
 
 Fixed Form Method.
 a.
 
 Setting Forms, Ties Bars, and Joint Assemblies. Set forms, tie bars, and joint assemblies for the entire
 area to be paved at least 1 day before placing concrete. Set forms at grade in full contact with the
 underlying surface. Ensure that concrete does not seep beneath the form. Stake forms into place with at
 least 3 pins for each 10-foot section. Lock form sections together to prevent movement in any direction.
 Install longitudinal tie bars through the forms and secure in place. Ensure that concrete does not seep
 around the bar. If longitudinal joint ties cannot be installed before placing concrete, install joint ties as
 specified in 405.03.02.C or use tie bolts as an alternate.
 Install joint assemblies and secure in place with anchor stakes. Ensure that devices for contraction joint
 assemblies are capable of holding dowels firmly in place during the entire construction operation. Place
 dowels across joint assemblies, parallel to and level with the surface course.
 Place 1/2-inch preformed joint filler along curb and around structures and other objects protruding into
 the slab.
 Check the alignment and grade elevations of the forms and joint assemblies and make corrections before
 placing the concrete. Ensure that the forms do not deviate from the required alignment by more than
 1/4 inch. Reset, or remove and replace, forms that settle or deflect under the spreading and finishing
 equipment. Clean the top and face of forms, and oil the face before placing concrete.
 
 b.
 
 Placing Concrete. Obtain RE approval of forms and joint placement before placing concrete. Place
 concrete across the formed area to minimize rehandling. Ensure that concrete is not discharged into
 windrows or piles. Continuously place concrete between transverse joints without the use of
 intermediate bulkheads. If a slab is not completed from transverse joint to transverse joint, remove the
 incomplete slab and replace. Terminate each day’s paving at a transverse joint. If concrete becomes
 segregated during placement, suspend operations and correct handling operations.
 To prevent bowing or misalignment of the transverse joints, place concrete simultaneously on both sides
 of transverse joints without disturbing the joints.
 
 c.
 
 Consolidation, Strike Off, and Finishing. Consolidate concrete using vibrators. Ensure that
 consolidating operations do not segregate the concrete or disturb the transverse joint assemblies, joint
 ties, the underlying surface, or side forms.
 Immediately after consolidating the concrete, strike off the surface to ensure that a uniform ridge of
 concrete, of between 2 and 6 inches, is maintained in front of the screed along the entire width of the
 pavement.
 Immediately after strike off, begin finishing operations to achieve the specified line and grade of the
 surface. Ensure that the finishing equipment is maintained true without lift, wobble, or other
 disturbances that could affect the specified line and grade. Use hand methods to finish variable-width
 areas or areas that would make the use of finishing equipment impractical. If the finishing equipment
 breaks down, the Contractor may use hand methods to screed and finish the concrete to the next joint
 assembly.
 At expansion joint assemblies, advance the finishing equipment, avoiding damage to or misalignment of
 joint assemblies. If advancing the finishing equipment over expansion joints causes concrete segregation
 
 150
 
 or damage to, or misalignment of, the joint assemblies, stop the finishing equipment when the screed is
 approximately 8 inches from the joint assembly. Remove segregated concrete from the joint; lift the
 screed and set directly on top of the joint, and resume advancement of the finishing equipment.
 If screeding operations produce a surface containing voids, bubbles, or other imperfections, then hand
 finish the surface with a metal float. Do not add water to the surface of the concrete to assist in finishing
 operations.
 Texture the surface of shoulders with a broom after finishing the concrete.
 
 2.
 
 d.
 
 Control Testing and Surface Correction. After advancing finishing equipment, check the concrete
 surface with a straightedge parallel to the centerline of the traveled way. Correct surface deviations
 determined by control testing before the concrete sets. Correct major deviations using the finishing
 equipment. Correct minor deviations and any defects caused by the control testing using a metal float.
 Do not add water to the concrete surface to assist in surface correction.
 
 e.
 
 Removing Forms. Remove forms no sooner than 12 hours after completing concrete placement. If
 using mineral admixtures in the concrete, remove forms no sooner than 24 hours after completing
 concrete pavement. Repair voids and honeycombed areas.
 
 Slip-Form Method. The Contractor may construct concrete pavement using the slip-form paving method.
 To control the operation of the slip-form paver, 1 day before placing concrete, set string lines at least 25 feet
 beyond the length to be paved. Mark joint locations of the entire area to be paved 1 day before placing
 concrete.
 Install and anchor each joint assembly before placing concrete, and ensure that each joint assembly is
 sufficiently secured to the underlying surface to prevent movement during paving. Place 1/2-inch preformed
 joint filler along the curb and around structures and other objects protruding into the slab.
 Place the concrete for the full depth of the slab with a slip-form paver in 1 pass of the machine. Consolidate
 the concrete for the full width and depth of the concrete pavement. Before finishing the concrete, install
 longitudinal tie bars and joint ties. Ensure that surface deformations caused by the installation of longitudinal
 tie bars and joint ties is corrected by the finishing operation. Finish the concrete in such a manner that a
 minimum of hand finishing is necessary to provide a dense and homogeneous concrete pavement.
 Operate the slip-form paver with a continuous forward movement, and coordinate all operations of mixing,
 delivering, and spreading concrete to provide uniform progress and to minimize stopping and starting of the
 paver. Texture the surface of shoulders with a broom after finishing the concrete.
 Continuously place concrete between transverse joints without the use of intermediate bulkheads. If a slab is
 not completed from transverse joint to transverse joint, remove the incomplete slab and replace. Terminate
 each day’s paving at a transverse joint.
 Correct concrete edge deformities greater than 1/4 inch before the concrete has taken initial set. Modify
 operations to prevent recurrence.
 
 E.
 
 Curing. Ensure that the concrete is not exposed for more than 30 minutes after finishing. The RE will direct a
 suspension, as specified in 108.13, of concrete operations if the curing procedure is delayed or is not followed.
 Apply curing compound as specified in 504.03.02.F.1, or wet burlap and white polyethylene sheeting as specified
 in 504.03.02.F.2. Maintain the curing material for 7 days.
 
 F.
 
 Protecting Concrete Surface Course. Protect concrete, as specified in 504.03.02.I, for the duration of the curing
 period. Construct wood bridging for pedestrian crossovers at street intersections and at other established pedestrian
 crosswalks.
 
 G
 
 Sawcutting Relief Joints. Relief joints are a preliminary step in the construction of transverse and longitudinal
 joints. The Contractor may begin sawcutting relief joints as soon as hardened concrete can support operations
 without spalling and must finish within 18 hours of placing concrete. Sawcut transverse relief joints above the joint
 assembly and sawcut longitudinal relief joints if more than 1 lane was paved in 1 paving operation. Sawcut 1/8inch wide relief joints to a depth of 1/3 of the thickness of the concrete pavement. Do not sawcut expansion joints
 or butt joints created by 2 separate paving operations.
 
 151
 
 H.
 
 Sawcutting and Sealing Joints. After completion of diamond grinding operations as specified in 405.03.04 and
 before opening to traffic as specified in 405.03.02.K, sawcut 3/8-inch-wide transverse and longitudinal joints to a
 depth of 1/2 inch at relief joints and butt joints. After sawcutting, immediately remove sawing slurry from the
 sawcut cavity and surrounding pavement surface. Clean sawcuts with a 150-pounds-per-square-inch water blast to
 remove remaining debris in the sawcut cavity, and then blow sawcuts with a hot-air lance to provide a dry surface.
 Seal sawcuts immediately after blowing.
 Seal joints with joint sealer before opening to traffic. Seal joints when the ambient temperature is between 50 and
 80 °F. Pour joint sealer in the sawcuts, ensuring that joint sealer is not spilled on the surface of the concrete. If
 spillage occurs, immediately remove spilled joint sealer from the surface of the concrete. Fill joints to ensure that
 the joint sealer is 1/8 to 1/4 inch below the adjacent surface. Do not allow traffic over the poured joints until the
 joint sealer has hardened to resist pickup.
 
 I.
 
 Thickness Requirements. The ME will divide the concrete pavement into lots of approximately 5000 square
 yards. The ME will divide each lot into 5 equal sections. The RE will direct the Contractor to drill 1 core, as
 specified in 405.03.03, from a randomly selected location within each section. The ME will test these cores for
 thickness as specified in ASTM C 174.
 The Department will determine conformance with thickness requirements as follows and will assess the greater of
 the 2 pay reductions or direct the Contractor to remove and replace the lot:
 1.
 
 Average Core Thickness. If the average core thickness is greater than or equal to the specified core
 thickness, the Department will not apply a payment reduction. If the average thickness is less than the
 specified thickness, but is greater than or equal to the specified thickness minus 1/2 inch, the Department will
 determine payment reduction by the following formula:
 PPR =
 
 TS − TA
 TS
 
 Where:
 TS = Specified thickness.
 TA = Average thickness.
 PPR = Percent payment reduction
 
 2.
 
 Individual Core Thickness. When more than 2 individual cores in the lot are less than the specified
 thickness minus 1/4 inch, the Department will reduce the payment for the lot by 2 percent.
 
 3.
 
 Remove and Replace. If the average thickness is less than the specified thickness minus 1/2 inch, the RE
 will require that the lot be removed and replaced.
 
 J.
 
 Ride Quality Requirements. Ensure that diamond grinding is completed before testing ride quality. The
 Department will evaluate ride quality acceptance as specified in 401.03.03.J using the Other Roadways equations.
 
 K.
 
 Opening to Traffic. Ensure that diamond grinding is completed before opening to traffic. The RE will determine
 when the concrete surface is to be opened to traffic or construction equipment. Do not allow construction vehicles
 or equipment on the concrete pavement within 10 days of placing, or until the concrete has achieved a compressive
 strength of 3000 pounds per square inch as determined by 2 test cylinders that are field cured according to
 AASHTO T 23. For concrete containing fly ash, opening to traffic is governed solely by the 3000-pounds-persquare-inch compressive strength requirement and not by time elapsed.
 
 405.03.03 Core Samples
 Drill cores before performing diamond grinding operations. Drill cores in the concrete pavement at locations as directed
 by the RE for thickness testing. Drill 3-inch diameter cores through the entire thickness of the concrete pavement. Use a
 water-cooled, diamond-tipped, masonry-type drill bit capable of obtaining a valid test sample through the entire
 pavement thickness. Identify each core by painting the RE supplied number on the side of the sample, and accompany
 each with a laboratory form supplied by the RE. Transport samples to the Department Laboratory.
 After removing the core from the pavement, pump water from the hole, and use a quick-setting patch to fill the hole flush
 with the adjacent pavement surface.
 
 152
 
 405.03.04 Diamond Grinding
 Perform wet grinding operations in a longitudinal direction that is parallel to the pavement centerline. Do not overlap
 longitudinal passes more than 2 inches. Continuously remove grinding slurry from the pavement surface.
 Ensure that the surface of the ground pavement has a corduroy texture consisting of grooves between 1/16 and 1/8 of an
 inch in width. Ensure that the peaks of the ridges are between 1/32 and 1/8 of an inch in width and are approximately
 1/16 of an inch higher than the bottoms of the grooves.
 Using a mechanical sweeper, clean the area before opening to traffic and before subsequent construction or resurfacing.
 Dispose of slurry and sweepings as specified in 201.03.09.

 451.03 CONSTRUCTION
 451.03.01 Pozzolan Grout
 A.
 
 Weather Limitation. Do not perform slab stabilization when the pavement surface temperatures are below 32 °F
 or if the subgrade or base course is frozen. If proper slab stabilization cannot be achieved due to excessive
 temperatures or direct sunlight, perform work at night.
 
 B.
 
 Drilling Holes. Drill the hole pattern for grout injection as noted in the plans or as determined by the RE in
 consultation with the Contractor. Drill a minimum of 3 holes on either side of the transverse joint. Drill holes
 between 1 and 2 inches in diameter, vertically and round, to a depth sufficient to penetrate the concrete pavement.
 Ensure that the subbase penetration does not exceed 3 inches. Clean holes with air or water to create a small cavity
 or remove obstructions caused during drilling, allowing initial spread of grout.
 
 C.
 
 Testing of Grout. The RE will perform flow cone testing of the grout at the beginning of pumping and at random
 times throughout pumping. Ensure that the grout is mixed so that the flow cone test result is 9 to 16 seconds.
 
 D.
 
 Void Filling. Ensure that the movement of the concrete slab does not exceed 0.10 inch. If the pavement has been
 lifted in excess of the specified amount, the RE may require removal and replacement or grinding to the correct
 grade.
 Pump grout into each hole until the maximum pressure is built up or material is observed flowing from hole to hole.
 Ensure that the maximum pressure is 58 pounds per square inch. Monitor the pressure using a gauge in the grout
 line. Protect the gauge from the grout slurry.
 Ensure that mixed material is not held in the mixer or pump hopper for more than 1 hour after initial mixing.
 Dispose of material held longer than 1 hour as specified in 201.03.09. The RE may reduce this time if the grout
 becomes unsuitable for use in less than 1 hour.
 
 154
 
 Ensure that water displaced from the void structure by the grout is allowed to flow out freely. Excessive loss of the
 grout through cracks or joints or from back pressure in the hose or in the shoulder area will not be allowed.
 If it is determined that continued grout injection at a specific location is no longer feasible due to major voids, the
 RE may direct the Contractor to cease grout injection at that location.
 Upon completion of undersealing, fill drill holes full depth with a Type 1A quick-setting patch material. Ensure
 that the patch is flush with the surface of the pavement.
 Do not allow traffic on the slabs for 1 hour after initial set.
 E.
 
 Repairing Cracks. If transverse cracks develop between adjacent injection holes, the RE may direct repair of the
 cracks using retrofit dowel bars, as specified in 454.03.01, or removal and replacement of the entire panel.
 If radial cracks develop from the injecting holes, immediately cease work and correct the operation. The RE may
 require repair or replacement of the damaged panel.
 
 451.03.02 High-Density Polyurethane Grout
 A.
 
 Contractor’s Experience. At the preconstruction meeting, submit the name, experience, and material
 manufacturer’s certification of a manufacturer’s representative to the RE. Ensure that experience includes a
 minimum of 5 projects on which slab stabilization operations were successfully completed using high-density
 polyurethane. Ensure that the manufacturer’s representative is at the work site during all high-density polyurethane
 slab stabilization. The Contractor may not begin the work until the RE approves the manufacturer’s representative.
 
 B.
 
 Weather Limitations. Do not perform slab stabilization if the underlying material is frozen.
 
 C.
 
 Drilling Holes. Drill the hole pattern for grout injection as noted in the plans or as determined by the RE in
 consultation with the Contractor. Drill a minimum of 2 holes per side of transverse joint. Ensure that the minimum
 horizontal distance between holes is between 2 and 4 feet. Ensure that holes do not exceed 5/8 inch in diameter,
 drilled vertically and round, to a depth sufficient to penetrate below the concrete pavement and into the voids, and
 subbase beneath the slabs. Ensure that base penetration does not exceed 3 inches. Clean holes to remove any
 obstructions caused during drilling to allow flow of high-density polyurethane.
 
 D.
 
 Slab Stabilization. During stabilization operations, ensure the upward movement of the pavement does not exceed
 0.10 inch. If the pavement has been lifted in excess of the allowable amount, the RE may require removal and
 replacement or grinding to the correct grade.
 After drilling the holes, inject high-density polyurethane under the slabs. As the polyurethane chemically reacts, it
 will expand and harden to create the necessary lifting forces. Using the pumping equipment, control the amount of
 rise by regulating the rate of injection of the material. When the nozzle is removed from the hole, remove any
 excessive material from the area, and seal the holes with high-density polyurethane.
 Immediately clean up material extruded during the pumping operations as the work progresses.
 Do not allow traffic on the slabs for 1 hour after initial set.
 
 E.
 
 Slab Lifting. When lifting concrete pavement to correct surface defects, such as faulted and settled concrete slabs,
 lift the concrete slab in increments of 0.25 inch until the pavement is raised to the required elevation.
 
 F.
 
 Repairing Cracks. If transverse cracks develop between adjacent injection holes, the RE may direct repair of the
 cracks using retrofit dowel bars, as specified in 454.03.01, or removal and replacement of the entire panel.
 If radial cracks develop from the injecting holes, immediately cease work and correct the operation. The RE may
 require repair or replacement of the damaged panel.
 
 451.03.03 Deflection Testing
 Perform deflection testing of joints between midnight and 10 a.m. The RE may stop testing earlier if there is evidence of
 slab lockup due to thermal expansion of the slabs. The RE may allow testing to continue after the hour specified if the
 slabs are not interlocked or under compression.
 Perform deflection testing after stabilization to determine the success of grouting. Use an applied load of between 7500
 and 9500 pounds-force. Place the center of the loading plate within 9 inches of the slab corner. Ensure that the
 
 155
 
 deflections are normalized to a 9000-pound nominal load. If joints and cracks have deflection values greater than 10
 mils, regrout an additional time in an attempt to reduce the deflection to below 10 mils. The RE may require deflection
 testing before grouting.

 452.03.01 Partial Depth Concrete Pavement Repair
 A.
 
 Preparation. Sawcut repair areas to a depth of 1 inch around the perimeter of each repair area before removing the
 deteriorated concrete. Remove loose and disintegrated concrete from the areas to expose a sound concrete surface.
 Remove at least 1/4 inch of sound concrete. Clean and roughen the area by sandblasting. Ensure that the
 remaining concrete is not damaged. Use only pneumatic or hand tools to remove the disintegrated material and to
 prepare and shape the areas to be repaired. Do not use hammers that exceed 30 pounds. Remove concrete adjacent
 to exposed reinforcement steel by hand chipping. Do not damage or debond the reinforcement steel.
 If corroded reinforcement steel is uncovered, clean the steel by sandblasting, waterblasting or wire brushing. If the
 concrete is debonded from the reinforcement steel or the steel is exposed, remove the concrete adjacent to the
 reinforcement steel to provide a 1/2-inch clearance.
 If, during removal of concrete, more than 1/3 of the slab depth is removed, cease operations at that repair and
 immediately notify the RE. The RE may then direct that a full depth concrete pavement repair be constructed.
 
 156
 
 B.
 
 Concrete Placement. Place and consolidate patch materials as specified for concrete in 405.03.02.D.1.b and
 405.03.02.D.1.c except that mechanical finishing is not required. Float finish and texture with a broom.
 Cover the repair with white polyethylene sheeting. Overlap sections of white polyethylene sheeting at least 18
 inches. Extend the polyethylene sheeting 2 feet beyond the edges of the repair.
 
 C.
 
 Opening to Traffic. Do not open repair to traffic until compressive strength as measured by the average of 2 test
 cylinders is more than 2000 pounds per square inch. If the required compressive strength is not met by the time the
 roadway must be opened to traffic, open to traffic. Remove and replace the repair during the next available

 453.03 CONSTRUCTION
 453.03.01 Full Depth Repair Using Concrete
 A.
 
 Preparation. Sawcut full depth at the limits of the repair. Remove existing concrete or composite pavement using
 the lift out method. Do not use in-place breaking to remove concrete. Ensure that spalling of the remaining
 concrete does not occur during the lifting. Reuse removed pavement as specified in 202.03.07.A. The Contractor
 may sawcut the slab and drill the lift out holes up to 5 days before the concrete removal. Only remove concrete that
 can be replaced during the workday. Repair any damage to remaining pavements.
 After the existing concrete has been removed, the RE will examine underlying material to determine its condition.
 If water or excess moisture exists in the area, remove the underlying material to the depth specified by the RE.
 Place and compact coarse aggregate using the directed method as specified in 203.03.02.C. Grade the underlying
 surface so that the thickness of the repair matches the existing slab thickness.
 
 B.
 
 Placing Limitations. Comply with the concrete placing limitations specified in 504.03.02.C.
 For Class V concrete, do not place concrete if the ambient temperature or the surface temperature of the underlying
 layer falls below 50 °F. Ensure that the temperature of the Class V concrete is at least 80 °F at the time of
 placement.
 
 C.
 
 Setting Forms, Joint Ties, and Dowels. For the sides of repair areas that are not in contact with sound concrete,
 set forms for the entire area of the repair before placing concrete. Set forms at grade in full contact with the
 underlying surface. Ensure that concrete does not seep beneath the form. Stake forms into place with at least
 3 pins for each 10-foot section. Lock form sections together to prevent movement in any direction.
 Place 1/2-inch preformed joint filler along curb and around structures and other objects protruding into the slab.
 For repairs that are 15 feet or shorter, do not install longitudinal joints ties. Coat the edge of existing slabs with
 cutback asphalt (MC-250) before placing concrete.
 For repairs that are longer than 15 feet, install longitudinal joint ties in the abutting concrete face. Drill holes into
 the face of the existing concrete pavement not more than 1/4 inch in diameter greater than the maximum measured
 dimension of the joint tie.
 For transverse joints abutting concrete pavement to remain, drill holes into the face of the existing concrete
 pavement not more than 1/4 inch in diameter greater than the dowels. Use a gang drill to install the dowels in the
 face of the slab. Maintain vertical and horizontal alignment during drilling and do not damage existing concrete
 surrounding the hole.
 Before installing dowels and joint ties, clean the holes of cement dust, standing water, and materials that interfere
 with proper bonding of the epoxy grout.
 Mix the epoxy grout according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Introduce the epoxy grout by low-pressure
 injection through a polyethylene tube, reaching to the end of the hole. Slowly withdrawn the tube as the hole is
 filled. Fill the holes to approximately 70 percent of their depth. Install plastic grout-retention disks to prevent the
 escape of grout. Insert the dowel or joint tie into the hole slowly and twist 1 full revolution to evenly distribute the
 
 158
 
 grout, ensuring that no bubbles are introduced within the grout. Ensure that there is sufficient epoxy grout so that it
 rises to the surface and overflows from the sides of the disk upon introduction of the dowel or joint tie. Spread
 overflow epoxy grout on the concrete face. Provide temporary support for dowels and joint ties after insertion to
 prevent movement and damage to the bond. Ensure that the dowels and joint ties are not disturbed before the final
 cure of the grout is achieved. Lightly coat the exposed end of the dowel bars with form oil or light grease. Do not
 coat joint ties.
 When replacing portions of slabs greater than 20 feet in length, install joint assemblies and secure in place with
 anchor stakes. Ensure that devices for contraction joint assemblies are capable of holding dowels firmly in place
 during the entire construction operation. Place dowels across joint assemblies, parallel to and level with the surface
 course. Set joint assemblies in line with existing, adjacent joints and perpendicular to the existing longitudinal
 joint. Space additional joint assemblies equidistantly between transverse joints between 13 and 20 feet apart and
 perpendicular to the existing longitudinal joint.
 Check the alignment and grade elevations of the forms and joint assemblies and make corrections before placing
 the concrete. Ensure that the forms do not deviate from the required alignment by more than 1/4 inch. Reset, or
 remove and replace, forms that settle or deflect under the spreading and finishing equipment. Clean the top and
 face of forms, and oil the face before placing concrete.
 D.
 
 Placing, Consolidating, and Finishing Concrete. Place concrete as specified in 405.03.02.D.1.b. Consolidate,
 strike-off, and finish concrete as specified in 405.03.02.D.1.c, except for the following:
 1.
 2.
 
 3.
 E.
 
 The Department will only require mechanical finishing equipment for repairs longer than 50 feet
 Place concrete in 2 layers with the first layer placed to such a depth that the surface of the layer is at the
 proper elevation to receive the reinforcement steel. Place the reinforcement steel followed by the next
 layer of concrete. Remove and replace the lower layer concrete if it has developed initial set or has been
 in place more than 30 minutes before being covered with the next layer.
 Texture the surface using a stiff broom.
 
 Curing. Ensure that the concrete is not exposed for more than 30 minutes after finishing. The RE will direct a
 suspension, as specified in 108.13, of concrete operations if the curing procedure is delayed or is not followed.
 Except for Class V, apply curing compound as specified in 504.03.02.F.1, or wet burlap and white polyethylene
 sheeting as specified in 504.03.02.F.2. Maintain the curing material for 3 days.
 For Class V, cure the concrete using wet burlap as specified in 504.03.02.F.2 and cover with an insulation blanket
 to retain the heat from hydration. Ensure that insulation blankets are secured to prevent lifting. When the concrete
 surface temperature exceeds 120 °F, remove the insulating blanket.
 
 F.
 
 Sawcutting and Sealing Joints. Sawcutting relief joints may begin as soon as hardened concrete can support
 operations without spalling, and must be completed within 18 hours of placing concrete and before opening to
 traffic. Sawcut transverse relief joints above joint assemblies. Sawcut 1/8-inch-wide relief joints to a depth of 1/3
 of the thickness of the concrete repair.
 Sawcut 3/8 inch wide transverse and longitudinal joints to a depth of 1/2 inch at relief joints and butt joints. After
 sawcutting, immediately remove all sawing slurry from the sawcut cavity and surrounding pavement surface.
 Clean sawcuts with a minimum of 150-pounds-per-square-inch water blast to remove remaining debris in the
 sawcut cavity, and then blow sawcuts with a hot-air lance to provide a dry surface. Seal sawcuts immediately after
 blowing.
 Seal joints with joint sealer when the ambient temperature is between 50 and 80 °F. Pour joint sealer in the
 sawcuts, ensuring that joint sealer is not spilled on the surface of the concrete. If spillage occurs, immediately
 remove spilled joint sealer from the surface of the concrete. Fill joints so that the joint sealer is 1/8 to 1/4 inch
 below the adjacent surface. Do not allow traffic over the sealed joints until the joint sealer has hardened to resist
 pickup.
 
 G.
 
 Opening to Traffic. For Class V concrete, do not open repair to traffic until flexural strength as measured by
 flexural beams is more than 350 pounds per square inch. For Class A and E concrete, do not open repair to traffic
 until compressive strength as measured by the average of 2 cylinders is more than 3000 pounds per square inch.
 If the required strength is not met by the time the roadway must be opened to traffic, open to traffic. Remove and
 replace the repair during the next available roadway closure.

 454.03.01 Retrofit Dowel Bars
 Demonstrate the method of sawcutting slots and placing the dowels or tie bars for the RE’s approval. Sawcut slots in the
 pavement to a depth that allows placing the center of the dowel at mid-depth in the concrete slab. Perform multiple cuts
 parallel to the longitudinal joint to remove material from the slot. Use small demolition hammers with a weight less than
 30 pounds to break loose the concrete. Sand blast and then clean exposed surfaces in the slot to provide an acceptable
 bonding surface.
 Immediately before placing the dowel bar, caulk the existing transverse joint or crack at the bottom and the sides of the
 slot. Place the caulking to provide a smooth level surface and tight fit for the foam core insert and to prevent any of the
 quick setting patch from entering the joint or crack.
 
 160
 
 Place dowel bar end caps on each end of the dowel to provide a 3/4 inch long void for expansion. Lightly coat the dowel
 bar with form oil or light grease, and place the foam core insert around the middle of the dowel.
 Place the dowel bar at the mid-depth of the slab, parallel to the longitudinal joint, and parallel to the pavement surface.
 For cracks that are skewed more than 45 degrees, place the dowel bar perpendicular to the crack. Ensure that the foam
 core insert fits tightly around the dowel and to the bottom and edges of the slot. Install the filler material so that it
 remains in a vertical position and tight to all the edges during placement of the quick setting patch.
 Place quick setting patch to the bottom of the dowel bar. Hand-tamp the quick setting patch in place. Check the position
 of the dowel bar to ensure that it is parallel to the pavement surface and the longitudinal joint. Place and hand-tamp
 quick setting patch to fill the slot. Finish the surface flush with the pavement surface.
 If the foam core insert shifts during placement of the quick setting patch, remove and replace the dowel bar. Ensure that
 the foam core insert is cut flush to the surface.

 Clean joints to be sealed to a depth of at least 2 inches by use of a rectangular plow, a diamond blade saw, or other
 suitable equipment. Remove joint material, incompressibles, rubble, and other extraneous materials present in the joint
 or adhering to the face of the adjacent concrete slabs. Clean both faces of the joint by sandblasting to the depth of the
 proposed sealer, leaving the faces clean and free of existing joint sealer and other contaminants. Blow the joint with a
 hot-air lance to provide a dry surface.
 Insert the backer rod only in transverse expansion joints at a depth equal to the joint width plus 1/4 inch for the recess.
 Install the backer rod with a doublewheeled steel roller without stretching or puncturing the backer rod. Ensure that the
 backer rod is firmly seated to support the joint sealer in the joint.
 Melt the joint sealer according to the manufacture’s recommendations. Ensure that the application temperature of the
 joint sealer is approximately 295 °F, except do not exceed the manufacturer’s safe heating temperature. Seal joints when
 the ambient temperature is above 40 °F.
 Discard the first gallon of material to flow from the applicator wand. Pour joint sealer in the joints, ensuring that joint
 sealer is not spilled on the surface of the concrete. If spillage occurs, immediately remove spilled joint sealer from the
 surface of the concrete. Fill joints so that the joint sealer is 1/8 to 1/4 inch below the adjacent surface.
 
 162
 
 Remove the joint sealer for the full slab width and full seal depth from joints that are filled to within 1/8 inch of the
 elevation of the adjacent concrete. Completely clean and reseal the joints the same day as the joint overfilling occurred.
 Do not allow traffic over the poured joints until the joint sealer has hardened to resist pickup.

 502.03 CONSTRUCTION
 502.03.01 Furnishing Pile Driving Equipment
 Perform a wave equation analysis program (WEAP) for each pile type and hammer combination. Ensure that the
 number of required hammer blows at the ultimate pile resistance indicated by the WEAP analysis is between 3 and 10
 blows per inch. Also ensure that the compressive and tensile pile stresses are within the allowable limits.
 Submit 4 copies of the WEAP analysis, signed and sealed by a Professional Engineer, and 4 copies of the NJDOT Pile
 and Driving Equipment Data Form to the Department for approval 30 days before delivery of the equipment to the
 Project Limits. Submit a separate WEAP analysis and NJDOT Pile and Driving Equipment Data Form for each pile type
 and hammer combination.
 502.03.02 Preboring Holes
 When preboring holes for round piles, use an auger with a diameter that is between 2 inches smaller than the average
 nominal diameter of piles. When preboring holes for steel H-piles, use an auger with a diameter that is 4 to 6 inches less
 than the nominal diagonal dimension of the piles. Backfill the void between the piles and the prebored holes with
 granular material.
 502.03.03 Driving Piles
 A.
 
 Wave Equation Analysis Program (WEAP). When Dynamic Pile Load Tests will not be performed, the RE will
 determine the ultimate bearing capacity of the pile, the anticipated number of hammer blows per inch, and the
 anticipated compressive and tensile pile stresses at the required ultimate pile capacity using the wave equation
 analysis.
 
 B.
 
 Methods of Driving. Do not drive piles in embankments until the embankment work, including placement,
 compaction, and removal of surcharge has been completed. Do not drive piles within 200 feet of concrete that is
 being placed or has been placed within the previous 24 hours unless approved by the RE. When driving piles in
 groups, start from the center of the group and proceed outward in both directions, or start from the end of the group
 and proceed to the opposite end of the group.
 When using followers in driving, drive 1 long pile in each group of 10 without a follower as a test pile to determine
 the average bearing capacity of the group.
 Do not install precast and prestressed concrete piles for at least 21 days after fabrication. If at any point precast and
 prestressed concrete piles are cured at 40 °F or below, the RE may require additional curing time before the
 installation of the piles. Additionally, do not install precast and prestressed concrete piles in seawater, brackish
 water, or sulfate soils for at least 30 days after fabrication.
 The Contractor may use vibratory pile drivers, with the approval of the RE, to advance steel bearing piles. Obtain
 RE approval before jetting piles. The RE will require use of an impact pile driver for at least the final 10 feet of
 penetration.
 Drive piles as follows:
 1.
 
 Accuracy of Driving. Ensure that piles are driven within 1/4 inch per foot from the vertical or batter. Ensure
 that the driven piles are within 6 inches of the specified position. Ensure that piles for trestle bents are driven
 
 167
 
 within 1/2 inch per foot from the vertical or batter. Ensure that the driven trestle bent piles are within 2 inches
 of the specified position.
 The RE will prohibit excessive manipulation of the piles to force them into proper position.
 
 C.
 
 2.
 
 Penetration. At least 10 days before beginning the work, submit a plan to the RE for approval for the types
 of piles, including those whose tip elevation is noted, for jetting, blasting, or the use of spuds and other work
 necessary to obtain the penetration required.
 
 3.
 
 Rock Bearing Piles. Drive steel H-piles or other steel piles that are intended to bear on rock to the refusal
 necessary to penetrate the rock sufficiently to provide uniform and adequate bearing. The pile is considered
 as reaching refusal when a penetration of not less than 5 blows per 1/4 inch has been achieved.
 
 Test Piles. The RE will determine the length of the test pile. Excavate the ground at each footing location to the
 elevation of the bottom of the footing before the pile is driven. Drive the test piles with the same type of equipment
 that will be used for driving production piles. Drive the test piles at the designated locations to the specified
 bearing capacity or hammer blow count, and tip elevation. Perform the following tests when shown on the Plans:
 1.
 
 Static Pile Load Test. Obtain the services of a professional testing laboratory, or Professional Engineer with
 satisfactory pile load test experience, to conduct the load test, to record data, and to provide reports of the test
 results to the RE.
 Determine the top elevation of the test piles immediately after driving and again just before static load testing
 to check for heave. Redrive or jack piles that heave more than 1/4 inch relative to the original elevation prior
 to testing. Allow at least 3 days to pass between the driving of any anchor piles or the load test pile and the
 commencement of the load test.
 If pipe walls are not of adequate strength to sustain the static test loading when empty, place the required
 reinforcement and concrete before loading. Do not apply loads for static load tests for cast-in-place concrete
 piles until the concrete in the test pile has set at least 7 days. Refer to the Special Provisions to determine the
 total static test load to be applied to piles.
 Perform static load tests according to ASTM D 1143, using the quick load test method for individual piles,
 except perform the test to plunging failure or the capacity of the loading system. Provide testing equipment
 and measuring systems according to ASTM D 1143, except ensure that the loading system is capable of
 applying 150 percent of the ultimate pile capacity or 1000 tons, whichever is less. At least 20 days before
 beginning the work, submit detailed plans of the proposed loading apparatus, prepared by a Professional
 Engineer, to the RE for approval. Construct the apparatus to allow the various increments of the load to be
 placed gradually without causing vibration to the test pile. When the approved method requires the use of
 anchor piles that will be used as production piles, drive anchor piles of the same type and diameter as the
 production piles in the location of the production piles when feasible.
 Remove the loads after the completion of the tests. The RE may allow the test piles to become part of the
 structure if approved. If any pile is found unsatisfactory for use in the structure, the RE will direct removal of
 the pile or cutoff of the pile below the ground line or footing.
 Upon completion of each test, submit to the RE for approval 4 copies of the static load test records/reports
 signed and sealed by a Professional Engineer.
 
 2.
 
 Dynamic Pile Load Tests. At least 30 days before beginning the work, submit verification to the RE that the
 components of the apparatus for obtaining dynamic measurements and the apparatus for recording, reducing,
 and displaying data have been calibrated by the equipment manufacturer within the past 12 months. Submit
 the name, qualifications, and previous experience of the person performing the dynamic pile load tests to the
 RE for approval.
 Perform dynamic testing according to ASTM D 4945. Take dynamic measurements while driving the piles
 specified as dynamic load test piles. Using pile analyzer instruments, determine the ultimate capacity of the
 pile. Monitor the stresses in the pile during driving operations to ensure that the pile is not damaged by
 excessive compressive or tensile stresses. Monitor the driving of test piles during the full length of driving
 and during restriking. Drive piles to the depth at which the dynamic equipment indicates that the required
 ultimate bearing capacity has been achieved and to the required tip elevation. If needed to maintain
 
 168
 
 acceptable stresses in the piles, modify the driving method. If the dynamic test equipment measurements
 indicate non-axial driving, immediately realign the driving system.
 If restrike is specified in the Special Provisions or directed by the RE, wait a minimum of 24 hours and then
 reattach the instruments before restriking the dynamic load test pile. Warm up the hammer by applying at
 least 20 blows to another pile before restriking. Terminate the restrike when the ultimate capacity of the pile
 is reached; when the amount of penetration reaches 6 inches; or when the total number of hammer blows
 reaches 50, whichever occurs first. If the established hammer blow count is not attained on restrike, the RE
 may direct the Contractor to drive a portion of or all of the remaining test pile length and repeat the restrike
 procedure. After restrike, the RE will determine whether additional pile penetration and testing is required.
 The RE may require splicing of a test pile driven to plan grade that does not meet the required hammer blow
 count. Drive the spliced pile until the required bearing is obtained.
 Within 48 hours of the completion of each test, submit 4 copies of the pile dynamic monitoring report to the
 RE. Include the Pile Dynamic Analyzer (PDA) test results, the Case Pile Wave Analysis Program
 (CAPWAP) results, and an interpretation of the data that is signed and sealed by a Professional Engineer.
 D.
 
 Production Pile Lengths. When test piles or load tests are specified, the RE will use the data obtained in
 conjunction with other available geotechnical information to determine the lengths of production piles to be
 furnished. The RE will not prepare the order list for any portion of the foundation until the required test data has
 been completed.
 The Contractor may increase the length of the production piles to be furnished to provide fresh heading or to suit
 the Contractor’s method. Complete test piles before driving any production piles unless approved by the RE.
 
 E.
 
 Cut-Offs and Cappings. Ensure that the tops of foundation piles are embedded in the concrete footing at least 1
 foot. At locations where tremie concrete is used, ensure the piles project at least 12 inches above the top of the
 tremie concrete. Ensure that the length of pile cut-off is sufficient to allow the removal of all injured material.
 Ensure that the distance between the edge of a pile to the nearest edge of the footing is at least 9 inches. When the
 cut-off elevation for a precast concrete pile is below the elevation of the bottom of the cap, build up the pile from
 the butt of the pile to the elevation of the bottom of the cap with a reinforced concrete extension.
 Cut-off piles at right angles to the axis of the pile at the designated elevation. Make the cuts in clean, straight lines.
 
 F.
 
 Painting Steel Piles and Pipe Shells. When steel piles or pipe shells in the completed structure extend above the
 original ground line or finished ground surface, protect the piles or pipe with coal tar epoxy paint as specified in
 511.03.01.C. Ensure the coating extends from an elevation 3 feet below the bed of waterbody or finished ground
 surface to the top of the exposed steel.
 
 G.
 
 Defective Piles. Ensure that the pile driving procedure does not subject the piles to excessive and undue abuse,
 producing crushing and spalling of the concrete, injurious splitting, splintering and brooming of the wood, or
 deformation of the steel. Correct damaged or defective piles using 1 of the following methods:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 Withdraw the pile and replace it with a new and, if necessary, longer pile.
 Drive a second pile adjacent to the defective pile. Remove the defective pile to at least 24 inches below
 cut-off elevation, and fill the hole with sand if it is a cast-in-place pile.
 Splice, build up the pile, or extend a sufficient portion of the footing to properly embed the pile.
 
 Re-drive piles that heave by more than 1/4 inch as a result of the driving of adjacent piles or any other cause. If a
 pile cannot be driven as specified due to an obstruction, the RE will determine when adequate penetration has been
 achieved.
 502.03.04 Splicing Piles
 Use full length steel piles, pipes, shells, precast concrete piles, and prestressed concrete piles. Do not splice partial pile
 lengths to achieve the production pile length unless directed. At least 10 days before beginning the work, submit the
 method of splicing, splice location for each pile, and name of certified welder to the RE for approval. Do not splice
 timber piles.
 502.03.05 Pile Shoes
 Attach pile shoes as shown on the Plans.

 Ensure that equipment used for final bottom cleaning does not have a centralizing guide at the tip.
 Use excavation and drilling equipment having adequate capacity, including power, torque, and down thrust to excavate a
 hole of both the maximum specified diameter and to a depth of 20 percent beyond the depths shown on the plans when
 operated at rated capacity.
 Provide Crosshole Sonic Logging (CSL) test equipment that includes the following components:

 The RE will schedule a review meeting between the Contractor, designer, and the Department after reviewing the
 installation plan and at least 15 days before the start of work.
 Within 30 days after receipt of the plan, the RE will notify the Contractor of any additional information required and
 changes that may be necessary.
 If the RE rejects the plan or a part of the plan, submit revisions to the RE for reevaluation. The RE will notify the
 Contractor within 10 days after receipt of proposed changes of their acceptance or rejection.
 503.03.02 Demonstration Drilled Shaft Installation
 The Department will require a demonstration drilled shaft to verify the Contractor’s methods. Locate the demonstration
 shaft as shown on the Plans or as directed by the RE. Excavate the demonstration shaft to the depth of the deepest
 
 172
 
 production shaft shown on the Plans. Construct the demonstration shaft as specified in 503.03.06. Include CSL as
 specified in 503.03.04.
 Cut-off the concreted demonstration shafts 2 feet below finished grade or 3 feet below the mudline if in water. Restore
 disturbed areas at demonstration shaft holes to their original condition.
 Once approval has been given to construct production shafts, do not change the personnel, methods, or equipment that
 were used to construct the approved demonstration shaft without written approval of the RE.
 503.03.03 Load Tests
 A.
 
 O-Cell Installation. Ensure that the installation and execution of the O-cell load tests are supervised by a
 Professional Engineer. Ensure that the O-cell, vibrating wire strain gauges, hydraulic supply, and other attachments
 are assembled according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Provide a reinforcement steel cage, as specified
 in 503.03.06.K, to attach the O-cell. Excavate using the approved method at the location shown on the Plans. After
 excavating a test drilled shaft, and obtaining approval from the RE, place a seating layer of concrete in the base of
 the drilled shaft. While the seating concrete is still plastic, install the reinforcement steel cage with the O-cell in the
 test shaft so that the O-cell rests firmly in the concrete.
 After seating the O-cell assembly, place concrete in the drilled shaft as specified in 503.03.06.M. The ME will take
 at least 6 concrete compression test cylinders from the concrete used in the test shaft. At least 1 day before the load
 test, the ME will test at least 1 of the cylinders. The ME will test at least 2 cylinders on the day of the load test. Do
 not perform the O-cell test until 7 days after placing the concrete and the concrete achieves the specified
 compressive strength.
 
 B.
 
 Load Testing and Reporting. Perform load tests according to ASTM D 1143. If the test apparatus shows signs of
 negative effects due to the construction activities, immediately cease testing and do not resume until the conditions
 are favorable for testing. Apply loads in increments equaling 10 percent of the maximum test load for the drilled
 shaft.
 Take direct movement indicator measurements of the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 Downward drilled shaft end-bearing movement (1 indicator required).
 Upward top-of-drilled shaft movement (minimum of 3 indicators required).
 Vibrating wire strain gauges (minimum of 8 per test required).
 
 Apply loads at the specified intervals until the maximum test load shown on the Plans is reached in either end
 bearing or side shear or until the maximum capacity or maximum stroke of the O-cell is reached. In addition to the
 requirements of ASTM D 1143, at each load increment, or decrement, take readings of the movement indicators at
 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 minute intervals while holding the load constant. Ensure that strain gauge readings are concurrent
 with shaft movement readings. The RE may direct additional cycles of loading and unloading using similar
 procedures following the completion of the test cycle.
 Ensure that dial gauges or Linear Variable Displacement Transducers (LVDTs) used to measure end bearing, side
 shear movement, and shaft compression have a minimum travel of 8 inches and are capable of being read to the
 nearest 0.0001 inch division. The Contractor may alternately monitor end bearing movement using LVDTs capable
 of measuring the expansion of the O-cell (6 inches). Ensure that the reference beam has a minimum length equal to
 6 times the drilled shaft diameter. Monitor the reference beam for movement during load testing using a surveyor’s
 level.
 Provide the performance results of each load test to the RE the day after performing the load tests. Provide a report
 of the load test results to the RE within 10 days of completing the test. Ensure that the report includes data readings
 and plots of the readings, the details of the load test and set-up, and a determination of the end bearing and
 friction/adhesion of the rock and soil. Within 20 days, the Department will notify the Contractor if revisions to the
 foundation lengths and installation procedures will be made based on the results of the load tests. Do not begin
 construction of production drilled shafts without the Department’s approval.
 C.
 
 Post-Test Grouting Procedures. Grout the interior of the O-cell and annular space around the outside of the Ocell according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The Contractor does not have to grout test shafts that will
 not be used as production shafts.
 
 173
 
 503.03.04 Crosshole Sonic Logging (CSL)
 A.
 
 CSL Tube Installation. Begin Crosshole Sonic Logging (CSL) on all production and demonstration drilled shafts
 48 hours after placing concrete in the shaft. Ensure that the testing is completed within 20 days after placing
 concrete.
 Ensure that the CSL tubes are watertight and have a round, regular, internal diameter free of defects or obstructions,
 including any at tube joints, to allow the free, unobstructed passage of 1.3-inch diameter source and receiver
 probes.
 Ensure that each pipe is fitted with a watertight shoe on the bottom and a removable cap on the top. Attach the
 pipes securely to the interior of the reinforcement cage with a minimum cover of 4 inches. The RE may allow the
 Contractor to install tubes on the outside of the cage if adequate cover and clearance are available. Install the tubes
 as near to parallel as possible.
 Ensure that the tubes extend from 6 inches above the shaft bottoms to at least 3 feet above the shaft tops. If the
 shaft top is sub-surface, extend the tubes at least 2 feet above the ground surface. Ensure that joints required to
 achieve full-length tubes are watertight.
 Ensure that the tubes are not damaged during reinforcement steel cage installation. As the cage is being lowered
 into the shaft, monitor the tubes to ensure that they are vertical and parallel, and that connections are watertight.
 After installing the reinforcement cage, immediately fill the tubes with clean water. After the tubes are filled with
 water, cap or seal the tube tops.
 Before placing concrete, plumb at least 1 tube per shaft and record the tube length. Note the stickup of the tubes
 above the shaft tops.
 Do not remove the seals or caps until the concrete in the shaft has set. Remove the caps or plugs after installation
 and ensure not to apply excess torque, hammering, or other stresses that could break the bond between the tubes
 and the concrete.
 
 B.
 
 CSL Testing and Reporting. Perform CSL tests between pairs of tubes. Perform the CSL tests with the source
 and receiver probes in the same horizontal plane, unless the tests indicate potential defects. Take CSL
 measurements at depth intervals of 2 inches or less, from the bottom of the tubes to the top of each shaft. Pull the
 probes simultaneously, starting from the bottoms of the tubes, over a depth measuring device. Remove slack from
 the cables before pulling to provide for accurate depth measurements of the CSL records. Test 2 principle
 diagonals through the center and between each tube pair around the perimeter of tested shafts.
 If the tests indicate potential defects, the RE may direct the Contractor to evaluate questionable zone using
 tomography (source and receiver vertically offset in the tubes). Report defects indicated by longer pulse arrival
 times and significantly lower amplitude/energy signals to the RE, and conduct additional tests as required to
 evaluate the extent of such defects.
 The RE will reject a shaft based on conclusive evidence that a defect exists in the shaft that will result in inadequate
 or unsafe performance under service loads. If the CSL records are complex or inconclusive, the RE may require
 additional testing to confirm the location of the defect. The RE may require coring to verify shaft conditions.
 Submit to the RE a report, signed and sealed by a Professional Engineer, that includes recommendations as to the
 acceptability, unacceptability, and soundness of the drilled shaft. Include in the report a CSL log for each tube pair
 tested with analyses of:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 Initial pulse arrival time versus depth.
 Pulse energy/amplitude versus depth.
 Defect zones.
 
 The Department will evaluate the CSL test results and determine whether or not the drilled shaft construction is
 acceptable. If the Department determines that the drilled shaft is acceptable, dewater the CSL tubes and grout.
 503.03.05 Core Drilling of Drilled Shaft Concrete
 The Contractor may core drill drilled shafts that are determined to be unacceptable based on the CSL tests. The RE will
 determine the number and depth of cores required. Drill cores at a minimum diameter of 3 inches.
 
 174
 
 Keep an accurate coring log, properly mark cores with the depth at each interval of core recovery, and place the cores in
 a crate. Deliver the cores and 3 copies of the coring log to the Department Laboratory.
 If the RE determines that the drilled shaft is acceptable, dewater and grout the core holes and the CSL tubes.
 If the Department determines that the drilled shaft is unacceptable, submit working drawings for approval proposing
 corrective measures. Do not begin corrective measures until the Department approves the working drawings.
 Do not proceed with construction above a drilled shaft until the quality of the shaft, as represented by the core samples,
 is determined to be acceptable and the RE provides notification to continue construction.
 503.03.06 Constructing Drilled Shafts
 A.
 
 Installation Plan. Submit the installation plan, as specified in 503.03.01. Do not begin constructing drilled shafts
 until the RE approves the plan.
 
 B.
 
 Location and Alignment. Construct drilled shafts within 3 inches of plan position in the horizontal plane at the
 elevation of the top of the shaft. Ensure that the vertical alignment of a shaft excavation does not vary from the
 plan alignment by more than 1/4 inch per foot of depth. Ensure that the alignment of a battered shaft excavation
 does not vary from the plan alignment by more than 1/2 inch per foot of depth.
 
 C.
 
 Construction Sequence Limitations. Excavate to the bottom of the footing elevation before beginning shaft
 construction. When constructing drilled shafts and placing embankment, construct drilled shafts after the
 placement of embankment. Repair disturbances caused by shaft installation to a subsequent drilled shaft area
 before beginning shaft construction.
 Do not excavate a shaft if an adjacent shaft in the same substructure unit is open unless the RE’s written approval is
 obtained. Do not perform blasting or vibrate to place casings until the concrete in adjacent shafts has reached 80
 percent of the required 28-day compressive strength. Once the excavation of a shaft has begun, do not stop the
 excavation until the excavation is completed. If the excavation is stopped for more than 24 hours, maintain shaft
 stability as detailed in the installation plan.
 
 D.
 
 Excavation Log. Maintain an excavation log during shaft excavation that includes the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 Description and approximate top and bottom elevation of each soil or rock material encountered during
 shaft excavation.
 Elevations at which seepage or groundwater flow are encountered, and remarks.
 The type of tools used for the excavation.
 Changes in the type of tools used for excavation.
 
 Ensure that discrepancies noted on the log by the RE are resolved by the end of each day. Provide 2 copies of the
 final log to the RE within 24 hours after a shaft excavation is completed and approved.
 Reuse excavated material as specified in 202.03.07.A.
 E.
 
 Excavating. Use the appropriate method for constructing drilled shafts as follows:
 1.
 
 Dry Method. Only use the dry method where the groundwater level and soil conditions allow construction of
 the drilled shaft in a relatively dry excavation, and where the sides and bottom of the shaft may be visually
 inspected by the RE before placement of reinforcement and concrete. The dry method will consist of drilling
 the shaft excavation, removing any accumulated water and loose material from the excavation, placing the
 reinforcement cage, and concreting the shaft in less than 3 inches of water.
 
 2.
 
 Wet Method. Construct drilled shafts using the wet method where dry excavation cannot be maintained. The
 wet method will consist of using water or slurry, as specified in 503.03.06.G, to maintain stability of the
 drilled shaft perimeter while excavating to finished depth, placing the reinforcement cage, and concreting the
 shaft. The Contractor may use the static or circulation process of the wet method.
 
 When the material encountered cannot be drilled using conventional earth drilling tools and equipment, provide
 rock drilling equipment, including air tools, approved blasting materials, and other equipment as necessary to
 construct the shaft excavation to the size and depth required. Obtain the RE’s approval before switching from earth
 to rock drilling tools and equipment. Obtain the RE’s approval before blasting.
 
 175
 
 The Contractor may overream with a grooving tool, overreaming bucket, or other RE approved equipment. The RE
 will direct the thickness and extent of sidewall overreaming.
 The Department will require sidewall overreaming between 1/2 and 3 inches when the sidewall of the hole has
 either softened due to excavation methods, swollen due to delays in concreting, or degraded because of slurry cake
 buildup.
 Immediately remove drilling tools that are lost in the excavation.
 F.
 
 Constructing Using Casings. Construct drilled shafts using casings where shown on the Plans or where the dry or
 wet construction methods are inadequate to prevent caving or excessive deformation of the hole. The Contractor
 may either place casings in a predrilled hole or advance casings through the ground by twisting, driving, or
 vibrating. When installing casings that are left in rock for the purpose of shielding voids, ensure that the predrilled
 hole is not more than 2 inches bigger than the casing diameter. When downsizing of permanent casing is required,
 do not overlap more than 6 feet of casing.
 When constructing drilled shafts in open water, extend the exterior casings from above the water elevation into the
 ground to protect the shaft concrete from water action during placement and curing of the concrete. Install the
 casing to ensure a positive seal at the bottom of the casing so that no seepage of water or other materials occurs into
 or from the shaft excavation.
 When casings are not shown on the Plans, but the Contractor believes that casings are necessary, the Contractor
 shall submit, in the installation plan, details of the proposed casing method (including casing lengths and diameters)
 and the proposed procedures of casing installation to the RE for review. If the Contractor does not determine the
 need for casings until after work on the shafts has begun, the Contractor shall submit to the RE for review a revised
 installation plan proposing the casing installation method for review.
 Ensure that casings are clean, round, straight, and free of weld breaks and holes that would allow passage of water
 or plastic concrete. With RE approval, the Contractor may provide casings larger in diameter than shown on the
 Plans.
 1.
 
 Temporary Casings. Casings are temporary unless shown as permanent casings on the Plans. Telescoping,
 predrilling with slurry, and overreaming to beyond the outside diameter of the casing may be required to
 install casing.
 Remove temporary casing before completing concrete placement in the drilled shaft. Before withdrawing the
 casing, ensure that the level of plastic concrete in the casing is at least 5 feet above either the hydrostatic water
 level in the formation or the level of drilling fluid in the annular space behind the casing, whichever is higher.
 As the casing is withdrawn, maintain an adequate level of concrete within the casing so that fluid trapped
 behind the casing is displaced upward and discharged at the ground surface without contaminating or
 displacing the shaft concrete.
 If the Contractor removes a specified diameter or length of casing and substitutes a longer or larger diameter
 casing through caving soils, the Contractor shall stabilize the excavation using a slurry or backfill before the
 new casing is installed.
 If temporary casings become bound or fouled during shaft construction and cannot be practically removed, the
 Department will designate the drilled shaft defective. Submit working drawings for approval proposing
 corrective measures. Do not begin corrective measures until the Department approves the working drawings.
 
 2.
 
 Removable Casing. When the shaft extends above ground or through a body of water, the Contractor may
 use suitable, removable casing for the portion exposed above ground or through a body of water except when
 permanent casing is specified. Strip removable casing from the shaft and ensure that the concrete is not
 damaged.
 The Contractor may remove casings when the concrete has attained a strength of at least 2800 pounds per
 square inch as determined from 2 concrete cylinders field cured according to AASHTO T 23, provided that
 curing of the concrete is maintained, as specified in 504.03.02.F. Do no expose the shaft concrete to salt
 water or moving water for 7 days.
 
 176
 
 3.
 
 Permanent Casings. When not shown on the Plans, the Contractor may use permanent casing if approved by
 the RE. Ensure casings are continuous between the top and bottom elevations shown on the Plans. After
 installation is complete, cut off the permanent casing at the specified elevation.
 After installing the casings, repair damage to coated surfaces of the casings exposed to the air by applying an
 organic zinc prime coat from the same manufacturer as the shop-applied inorganic zinc prime coat.
 
 G.
 
 Constructing Using Slurries. When using slurry to construct drilled shafts, the Contractor may use mineral or
 polymer slurries. During construction, maintain the level of the slurry at a height sufficient to prevent caving of the
 shaft excavation. Use a temporary surface casing in the upper soils. Maintain the slurry level inside the shaft
 above the groundwater level during installation and cleaning out. In the event of a sudden significant loss of slurry
 to the hole, cease the construction until either a method to stop slurry loss or an alternate construction procedure has
 been approved by the RE.
 Pump slurry into holding tanks to ensure that no slurry spills or contaminates the site. Provide physical or chemical
 treatment of the slurry according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 During construction, maintain the level of mineral slurry in the shaft at least 4 feet above the highest expected
 piezometric pressure head that is along the depth of the shaft. Maintain the level of polymer slurry at least 5 feet
 above the highest expected piezometric pressure head that is along the shaft. If the selected slurry construction
 method fails, in the opinion of the RE, to produce the desired final results, cease this method and propose an
 alternate method to the RE for approval.
 Ensure that a heavily contaminated slurry suspension, which could impair the free flow of concrete, has not
 accumulated in the bottom of the shaft. Before placing concrete for shaft excavation, take slurry samples using a
 sampling tool approved by the RE. Take slurry samples from the bottom of the shaft and at intervals not exceeding
 10 feet up the slurry column in the shaft, until 2 consecutive samples produce acceptable values for density,
 viscosity, sand content, and pH at each sampling depth.
 When slurry samples are unacceptable, take corrective actions. Do not place concrete until the slurry is re-sampled
 and test results are approved.
 If the slurry remains in the shaft for more than 12 hours or if caking develops, roughen or re-ream the shaft with
 appropriate new bottom cleaning and slurry testing before concreting. Place concrete on the same day as the
 completion of the excavation of the drilled shaft to the bottom elevation.
 1.
 
 Mineral Slurry. Premix mineral slurry with water and allow time for hydration according to the
 manufacturer’s recommendations before using during shaft excavation. Provide slurry tanks of adequate
 capacity for slurry circulation, storage, and treatment. Do not substitute excavated slurry pits with slurry
 tanks without obtaining approval from the RE. Do not mix the slurry in the shaft.
 Monitor the properties of the pre-mixed slurry as it is introduced into the borehole and periodically thereafter,
 including a final check of a bottom sample before placing concrete to verify that the density and sand content
 are within the limits for the proper slurry displacement during concreting. Use desanding equipment to
 control slurry sand content to less than 4 percent by volume at any point in the borehole at the time the slurry
 is introduced.
 Perform control tests on the mineral slurry in the presence of the RE to determine density, viscosity, and pH.
 Adjust the slurry to meet the requirements shown in Table 503.03.06-1:
 
 177

 Standard measurements are in seconds per quart. One sec/quart = 1.06 sec/liter.
 a. Perform tests when the slurry temperature is above 40 °F.
 b. Ensure that the sand content does not exceed 4 percent (by volume) at any point in the borehole as determined by
 the API sand content test when the slurry is introduced.
 Perform tests to determine density, viscosity and pH value during the shaft excavation to establish a consistent
 working pattern. Perform a minimum of 4 sets of tests during the first 8 hours of slurry use. When the results show
 consistent behavior, the Contractor may decrease the testing frequency to 1 set per every 4 hours of slurry use.
 
 Polymer Slurry. Provide a slurry management plan to the RE that includes a set of the slurry manufacturer’s
 written recommendations and results of the following tests, as a minimum:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 Density Test (API 13B-1, Section 1).
 Viscosity Test (Marsh funnel and cup, API 13B-1), Section 2.2 or approved viscometer.
 pH Test (pH meter, pH paper).
 Sand Content Test (API sand content kit, API 13B-1, Section 5).
 
 Also include the tests to be performed, the frequency of those tests, the test methods, and the maximum and
 minimum property requirements that must be met to ensure that the slurry meets its intended functions.
 Ensure that all test reports are signed, and provide them to the RE on completion of each drilled shaft.
 H.
 
 Removing Obstructions. The RE will determine if an object is considered an obstruction. Remove surface and
 subsurface obstructions at drilled shaft locations. The Contractor may need to use special procedures and tools
 when the drilled shaft excavation cannot be advanced using conventional augers fitted with soil or rock teeth,
 drilling buckets or underreaming tools. Special procedures and tools may include: chisels, boulder breakers, core
 barrels, air tools, hand excavation, temporary casing, and increasing the hole diameter. Do not blast without
 obtaining written approval from the RE.
 
 I.
 
 Rock Socketing. The RE will determine the top of rock sound enough for the Contractor to begin the socket based
 on the existing borings and observations during shaft drilling. The RE will not consider weathered or highly
 fractured rock as the top of rock socket.
 Prepare rock socket for concrete placement by roughening with drilling tools or by overreaming as directed by the
 RE. Rotate roughening tools against the rock socket area to remove accumulated slurry cake, to scale off loose
 rock fragments, and to roughen the finished rock socket surface.
 
 J.
 
 Excavation Cleaning and Verification. Unless otherwise approved by the RE, ensure that at least 50 percent of
 the base of each shaft has less than 1/2 inch of sediment at the time of concrete placement. Ensure that the
 maximum depth of sediment or debris at any place on the base of the shaft does not exceed 1-1/2 inches.
 In the presence of the RE, determine the cleanliness of the bottom of the shaft by the use of sounding, probe data,
 video camera, tape with weight, or other methods approved by the RE. After final cleaning, determine the
 dimensions, depth, and alignment as directed by the RE.
 
 K.
 
 Constructing Reinforcement Steel Cages. Immediately after the shaft excavation has been inspected and
 approved, assemble and place the reinforcement steel cage, consisting of longitudinal and transverse bars, ties, cage
 
 178
 
 stiffeners, spacers, centralizers, and other necessary appurtenances before placing concrete. Remove internal
 stiffeners as the cage is placed in the drilled shaft hole before placing concrete.
 Use concrete spacers or other approved noncorrosive spacing devices at sufficient intervals near the bottom, and at
 intervals not exceeding 10 feet up the shaft, to ensure concentric spacing for the entire cage length. If the size of
 the spacers is not shown on the Plans, provide spacers that will create a minimum 3-inch annular space.
 Provide cylindrical concrete supports to ensure that the bottom of the cage is maintained at the specified distance
 above the base.
 L.
 
 Concrete Placement Time Limitations. Place concrete according to the limitations specified in 504.03.02.C.
 Continuously place concrete from the bottom to the top elevation of the shaft.
 Ensure that the concrete placement is completed within 2 hours. The RE may allow the concrete placement time to
 exceed 2 hours if the Contractor demonstrates that the slump of the concrete will not be less than 4 inches during
 the entire time of concrete placement.
 
 M. Concrete Placement Methods. The Contractor may request 1 additional set of cylinders to be taken for
 determining strength for early form removal as specified in 504.03.02.G. If additional cylinders are requested,
 notify the RE at least 24 hours before placing.
 When using SCC to construct drilled shafts, only place SCC using the tremie method.
 When using a concrete pump to place concrete for the drilled shaft, provide a standby pump that is immediately
 available if there is a pump failure.
 Check the elevation of the top of the steel cage before, during, and after concrete placement. If the final upward
 displacement of the rebar cage exceeds 2 inches or if the downward displacement exceeds 6 inches per 20 feet of
 shaft length, the RE will reject the drilled shaft. Correct the shaft to the satisfaction of the RE. Do not construct
 additional shafts until the rebar cage support system is corrected.
 1.
 
 Tremie Method. Ensure that tremie tubes are of sufficient length, weight, and diameter to discharge concrete
 at the shaft base elevation. Ensure that the inside and outside surfaces of the tremie are clean and smooth to
 allow the flow of concrete during concrete placement and an unimpeded withdrawal of the tremie tube after
 concrete placement. Ensure that the tremie tube’s inside diameter is at least 6 times the maximum size of
 aggregate used in the concrete mix. Do not use tremie tubes less than 10 inches in diameter. Ensure that the
 tremie tube thickness is adequate to prevent crimping or sharp bends. Do not use tremie tubes that have
 aluminum parts that will come in contact with concrete. Ensure that the tremie tube is watertight.
 Do not begin placing concrete underwater until the tremie is placed to the shaft base elevation. The
 Contractor may use valves, bottom plates, or plugs to ensure concrete discharge begins within one tremie
 diameter of the base. Remove plugs from the excavation or construct them using a material that will not cause
 a defect in the shaft if not removed. Construct the discharge end of the tremie to allow the free radial flow of
 concrete during placement operations.
 Ensure that the tremie tube discharge end is immersed at least 5 feet in concrete at all times after starting the
 flow of concrete. Maintain a continuous flow of the concrete at a positive pressure differential to prevent
 water or slurry intrusion into the shaft concrete.
 If the tremie tube discharge end is removed from the plastic concrete and discharges concrete above the rising
 concrete level, the RE will consider the drilled shaft defective. To correct this defect, the Contractor may:
 remove the reinforcement cage and concrete, complete necessary sidewall removal directed by the RE, and
 replace the shaft; or, the Contractor may replug the tremie tube, recharge with concrete, and insert a minimum
 of 5 feet below the existing top level of concrete before continuing placing concrete.
 
 2.
 
 Pumped Method. Ensure that pump lines have a minimum diameter of 4 inches and are constructed with
 watertight joints.
 Ensure that the discharge end remains at least 5 feet below the surface of the plastic concrete. When lifting
 the pump line during concreting, temporarily reduce the line pressure until the discharge end has been
 repositioned at a higher level in the excavation.
 
 179
 
 If at any time during the concrete pour the pump line discharge end is removed from the fluid concrete
 column and discharges concrete above the rising concrete level, consider the shaft defective. In such case,
 remove the reinforcement cage and concrete, complete any necessary sidewall removal directed by the RE,
 and replace the shaft.
 Ensure that waste concrete overflows the full top circumference of the casing evenly. Waste concrete is the top 24
 inches of the initial concrete placed, plus the height of additional volume of waste concrete deposited in the shaft
 where concrete placement was halted and restarted, plus any additional amount necessary to produce full strength,
 non-segregated concrete at the plan shaft top level. Continue placing concrete until the waste concrete is pushed
 upward and ejected completely out of the top of the casing and wasted; or, place an additional 24 inches of concrete
 above the planned shaft top level and allow to cure in place for removal later. Remove waste concrete at the top of
 the shaft to maintain a uniform appearance and to meet the specified dimensions of the shaft.
 Do not channel or bleed off waste concrete using notches, holes, or cuts in the casing top. The Contractor may
 remove or pump out plastic concrete in the casing that is above the top elevation of the drilled shaft after ejecting
 waste concrete to the top elevation.
 N.
 
 Approval. Compare the computed theoretical volume of the excavation with the actual volume of concrete placed,
 and create a plot of depth versus volume. Provide results to the RE.
 After placing the concrete, ensure that the top of the reinforcement steel cage is within −3 inches and +6 inches of
 the Plan elevation. Ensure that the top elevation of the completed drilled shaft is within −3 inches and +1 inch of
 the Plan elevation.
 The RE may reject drilled shafts because of damage; failure to advance through; mislocation, misalignment, or
 failure to install the drilled shaft to the proper bearing stratum; or results of CSL testing indicating defects.
 For each rejected drilled shaft, submit to the RE for approval a plan showing how to correct the problem and
 prevent its reoccurrence. Repair, augment, or replace the drilled shaft. If the RE rejects a drilled shaft, the
 Contractor shall cease the construction of all other drilled shafts until the Contractor demonstrates the ability to
 construct an approved drilled shaft.
 Within 10 days after completing the installation of all drilled shafts, and before removing the drilled shaft
 installation equipment from the Project Limits, provide the RE with a plan certified by a land surveyor registered in
 the State of New Jersey showing the as-installed location of drilled shafts. The RE will analyze the total loads on
 individual drilled shafts based on the survey data. If the load on any drilled shaft exceeds 10 percent of the
 specified load capacity, correct the drilled shaft as directed by the RE. The corrections may include installation of
 additional drilled shafts.
 Do not place substructure concrete on a drilled shaft until the concrete in the shaft reaches a minimum of 80 percent
 of the required 28-day compressive strength and until all CSL test results are approved and the CSL tubes have
 been dewatered and grouted.

 504.03 CONSTRUCTION
 504.03.01 Reinforcement Steel
 A.
 
 Handling. Store reinforcement steel above ground level. When unloading coated reinforcement steel, minimize
 scraping of the bundles, bar-to-bar abrasion, and sags in the bundles. For coated reinforcement steel, do not skid
 the bundles from the truck bed to the ground. Ensure that equipment used for handling the bars is equipped with
 nylon slings. Do not use wire rope slings or chains. Lift bundles of bars to ensure that sagging does not occur.
 Ensure that coated bars or bundles of coated bars are not dropped or dragged during handling.
 
 B.
 
 Storing. Coordinate deliveries of coated reinforcement bars to the work site with the placing of the bars in the
 structure. Store reinforcement steel as close as possible to the area where it will be placed to minimize handling.
 Store the bars above the ground on timbers or other suitable protective cribbing and space the dunnage to prevent
 sags in the bundles. When storing a large quantity of bars in a small area, stack bundles of straight bars with
 adequate blocking placed between the layers of bundles to provide stability and prevent sagging.
 Do not store reinforcement bars at the work site for more than 60 days unless approved by the RE. If long term
 storage is approved, protect non-metallic tags on the bundles or attach additional galvanized metal tags on all
 bundles of bars to maintain identification. If long term storage is approved, cover the bars with white polyethylene
 sheeting or other suitable protective material. For stacked bundles, drape the white polyethylene sheeting over the
 sides of the bundles around the perimeter of the stack. Secure the covering and provide air circulation around the
 bars to prevent condensation under the polyethylene sheeting.
 
 C.
 
 Field Cutting. Obtain RE approval before field cutting reinforcement steel. Do not flame cut epoxy-coated
 reinforcement steel. If coated reinforcement bars are cut in the field, coat the cut ends and repair damage to the
 coating as specified in 504.03.01.G.
 
 D.
 
 Field Bending. Obtain RE approval before field bending reinforcement steel. Use the cold method to make minor
 adjustments to reinforcement steel bars in the field. Do not bend galvanized reinforcement steel more than 10
 degrees. With the approval of the RE, the Contractor may use the heat method to perform minor adjustments to
 uncoated bars. Preheat the bar to between 1000 and 1200 °F, and then gently bend in a gradual arc. For bars
 partially embedded in concrete, ensure that the concrete is not damaged by heating the bars.
 
 E.
 
 Placing and Fastening. When placing, ensure that reinforcement steel is free of dirt, detrimental scale, paint, oil,
 or other foreign substances. Tie bars at all intersections except where spacing is less than 12 inches in each
 direction, in which case tie alternate intersections. Use stays, blocks, ties, hangers or chairs, to maintain the
 specified concrete cover. If using blocks, ensure that the blocks are precast concrete. Ensure that blocks are not
 used where they are exposed in a finished surface.
 When using galvanized reinforcement steel, ensure that all miscellaneous hardware that comes in contact with or is
 used to support, position, or fasten the reinforcement steel are also galvanized according to AASHTO M 232.
 When using epoxy-coated reinforcement steel, use only plastic-coated or epoxy-coated tie wires and ensure that all
 miscellaneous hardware used to support, position, or fasten the reinforcement are dielectric, plastic-coated, or
 epoxy-coated.
 If using welded wire reinforcement, overlap sheets at least 1 grid in width. Fasten overlaps securely at the ends and
 edges.
 Repair damage to epoxy-coating or galvanized coating as specified in 504.03.01.G. Do not place concrete before
 inspection and approval of the reinforcement steel.
 
 F.
 
 Splices. When splicing is not specified, submit a plan for splicing to the RE for approval. Include size, location,
 and splicing method.
 The Contractor may use mechanical coupling devices listed on the QPL. When using galvanized reinforcement
 steel, ensure that mechanical coupling devices are galvanized according to AASHTO M 232. When using epoxycoated reinforcement steel, ensure that mechanical coupling devices are epoxy coated according to AASHTO
 M 284.
 When using mechanical connections, remove the coating from the ends of the reinforcement steel over the length of
 the sleeve and at least 2 inches from the ends of the sleeves, or more if recommended by the Supplier.
 
 182
 
 Repair damage to epoxy-coating or galvanized coating as specified in 504.03.01.G.
 G.
 
 H.
 
 Field Repairing of Coatings. The RE will allow field repair when there are less than 6 damaged areas in any 10foot length of bar. The RE will reject material with more than 6 damaged areas within a 10-feet span and any
 material with a damaged area more than 4 square inches in size. Repairable damage is any bare or loose spots, or
 breaks in the coating that affect an area smaller than 4 square inches. Ensure that grease, dirt, mortar, concrete, mill
 scale, injurious rust, or any other foreign substance is removed before repairing.
 1.
 
 Epoxy-Coating. Repair damage to epoxy-coating according to AASHTO M 317.
 
 2.
 
 Galvanized-Coating. Repair damage to the galvanized coating according to ASTM A 780.
 
 Protecting Exposed Reinforcement Steel. When non-coated embedded reinforcement steel is partially exposed at
 construction joints for more than 30 days, protect the exposed portion of the bar with a coat of neat cement mixed
 with water within 5 days of the initial concrete placement. Remove loose coating by lightly tapping within 5 days
 of the subsequent concrete placement.
 
 504.03.02 Constructing Concrete
 A.
 
 Falsework. When forms and concrete require support, construct falsework on sills resting on foundations capable
 of carrying the loads without settlement. If falsework cannot be founded on solid footings, support with falsework
 piling.
 Construct the falsework to support the forms and the structure so that there is no deflection. Provide camber in the
 falsework and forms to allow the joints to tighten in the forms and supporting falsework.
 When constructing centering for arches, correct any deflection due to placing the concrete by jacking, as the
 concrete is being placed.
 
 B.
 
 Forms. Construct forms that are true to line and grade; that are mortar tight; and that provide a smooth, even
 concrete surface. Ensure that forms are rigid to prevent distortion. Prevent the opening of the joints or movement
 in any direction. Ensure that all bolts are countersunk on the face forming the concrete surface.
 Ensure that forms are free from rust, grease, and other foreign matter. Clean the top and face of forms, and oil the
 face before erecting. Ensure that the form oil does not discolor the concrete.
 Provide a system to monitor settlement or movement in the falsework and forms. Check the alignment and
 elevation of the forms and make corrections before placing the concrete. Reset or remove and replace forms that
 deviate from the specified line and grade.
 Provide a chamfer to form edges as shown. Ensure that all chamfer strips are straight, of uniform width, and
 dressed.
 Construct forms so that they can be removed without damaging the waterstops. Splice, weld, or solder metallic
 waterstops, as necessary, to form continuous, watertight joints. Install nonmetallic waterstops in continuous strips,
 without splices. The RE will allow splices at changes in direction when necessary. Splice nonmetallic waterstops
 according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. When splicing PVC waterstops, ensure that the heat used is
 sufficient to melt but not char the plastic. Secure waterstops to prevent movement during concrete placement.
 When epoxy-coated reinforcement steel is used, use epoxy-coated or galvanized metal ties. When metal ties and
 anchorages remain in the forms, remove to a depth of at least 1 inch from the face without damaging the concrete.
 Provide cones if using wire ties.
 The Contractor may use manufactured fiber tubes as column forms for round columns of concrete. Ensure that
 fiber tubes are rigid and circular in section. Store fiber tubes above ground on supports in a dry area. Ensure that
 fiber tubes are not exposed to moisture before use. When erecting column forms, hold forms in a vertical position
 to prevent distortion during concrete placement.
 
 C.
 
 Limitations of Placing. At least 30 days before placing concrete, submit to the RE for approval a plan for hot and
 cold weather concreting. Include the method that will be used to ensure that the temperature of the concrete is
 between 50 and 90 °F during mixing and placing.
 
 183
 
 Do not place concrete when precipitation is imminent as determined by the RE. If it begins precipitating during
 concrete placement, the RE may direct the Contractor to suspend placement operations and protect the plastic
 concrete as specified in 504.03.02.I. If placement cannot be resumed within 30 minutes, the RE may direct the
 construction of a construction joint.
 If, during the concrete placement or within the 24 hours preceding the scheduled concrete placement, the National
 Weather Service http://www.nws.noaa.gov/ locally forecasts the ambient temperature to be below 40 °F or above
 75 °F during the scheduled concrete placement or curing period, follow the appropriate temperature condition
 procedure. Do not place concrete when the ambient temperature is below 20 °F or above 100 °F.
 1.
 
 Cold Weather Concreting. The RE will prohibit the placement of concrete when the ambient temperature is
 below 40 °F, unless all surfaces in contact with the concrete placement are preheated to between 50 and 80 °F
 and access is provided for measuring the temperature of the in-place concrete. For access, establish a 1/2 inch
 diameter hole that is 6 inches deep at a 45 degree angle by placing a greased bolt through the forms prior to
 concrete placement.
 Use 1 or more of the following protective measures to maintain the concrete temperature:
 a.
 
 Insulated Forms. Before placing concrete, construct insulated forms to protect concrete. Ensure that
 the forms are free of ice, snow, and frost at time of placing concrete.
 
 b.
 
 Insulated Blankets. Use insulated blankets to protect concrete.
 polyethylene sheeting within 30 minutes of placing concrete.
 
 c.
 
 Heating and Housing. Before placing concrete in the forms, provide housing for the section of concrete
 to be placed so that the temperatures specified can be maintained within the enclosure. Construct the
 enclosures to allow removal of forms and finishing of concrete surfaces without interruption of the
 heating.
 
 Place the blankets on top of
 
 Maintain the heating system to provide uniform heating within the enclosure. Ensure that the heating
 system has been operating so that the temperature of form surfaces, reinforcement steel and abutting
 construction to be in contact with the concrete is between 50 and 80 °F before placing the concrete.
 Provide a sufficient number of back-up heaters at the Project Limits to maintain the temperature of the
 housing in the event of a breakdown of the primary heating system. In the event of a breakdown,
 operate the back-up heaters until the primary heating system is repaired.
 Maintain the protective measures for arches, culverts, deck slabs, and approaches for at least 7 days. For other
 concrete placements, maintain for at least 5 days. Ensure that the temperature of the concrete is maintained
 between 60 and 160 °F for 5 days after placement. The RE will check the temperature of the concrete in the
 established hole. If the temperature of the concrete falls below 60 °F within 5 days after placing, maintain the
 protective measures in place for an additional 5 days. If the temperature of the concrete rises above 160 °F,
 the RE may direct the forms to be loosened or protective measures to be removed. If the temperature of the
 concrete falls below 32 °F or rises above 180 °F within 5 days of placement, the RE will direct that the
 concrete be removed and replaced. After the concrete temperature has been maintained for 5 days at a
 minimum of 60 °F, ensure that the temperature of the concrete does not fall more than 10 °F in 12 hours.
 2.
 
 Hot Weather Concreting. When the ambient temperature reaches 75 °F, use the following procedures
 before and during concreting operations.
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 Schedule work so that concrete can be placed continuously. If necessary, start concrete placement
 at night or early morning.
 Use a water-reducing admixture or a water-reducing and retarding admixture as specified in
 903.02.02 and according to the manufacturer’s recommendation.
 Prevent absorption by sprinkling the underlying material and the wood forms just before concrete
 placement so that they do not absorb water from the mix.
 Begin curing within 5 minutes after finishing.
 
 If the temperature of the plastic concrete reaches 85 °F, take immediate steps to cool either the mixing water
 or the aggregates, or both, according to the plan of action. Do not place concrete when its temperature in the
 plastic state exceeds 90 °F at the time of placement.
 
 184
 
 D.
 
 Placing and Consolidating Concrete. The Contractor may request 1 additional set of cylinders to be taken for
 determining strength for early form removal as specified in 504.03.02.G. If additional cylinders are requested,
 notify the RE at least 24 hours before placing.
 Appoint sufficient number of personnel, who are certified by the NJACI as Concrete Construction Technologists or
 by ACI as Concrete Transportation Construction Inspectors, to monitor daily operations for concrete placement.
 The certified personnel are responsible for ensuring proper dimensions of forms; position of reinforcement steel;
 proper handling, placement, consolidation, and finishing of concrete; and proper curing of the concrete.
 Ensure that all forms, joints, and reinforcement steel have been placed, inspected, and approved before placing
 concrete. Ensure that utilities, pipe, conduit, ducts and any other items to be encased in concrete are in place and
 secure before placing concrete. Secure or provide rigid bracing for items to be encased in concrete during concrete
 placement to prevent their displacement. Ensure that forms for weep holes through concrete are PVC or
 unreinforced concrete drain pipe.
 Do not place concrete until all laitance and loose, deleterious material on reinforcement bars and previously placed
 concrete has been removed. Clean forms of all debris immediately before placing concrete. Wet the surfaces not
 treated with oil, paraffin, or epoxy bonding compound.
 Do not place concrete that is below 60 °F or above 90 °F. Begin placing concrete at the lowest elevation and
 proceed upgrade. Place the concrete so that segregation does not occur and there is no displacement or movement
 of reinforcement and forms using 1 of the following methods:
 1.
 
 Chutes and Troughs and Other Conveyances. Do not dump or drop concrete from a distance greater than 5
 feet, unless using closed chutes or pipes to confine concrete. Ensure that buggies, chutes, troughs, and pipes
 used for placing concrete are kept clean and free from coatings of hardened concrete.
 
 2.
 
 Pumped Concrete. At least 30 days before beginning operations, submit a plan to the RE according to ACI
 304.2R. Include the method and procedures along with a list of adequate descriptions of equipment and
 manpower proposed for use, including contingency equipment and manpower. The RE will prohibit the use
 of aluminum alloy pipe as a conveyance for the concrete or for any pieces of equipment in contact with the
 concrete. For flatwork concrete, ensure that the pipeline is horizontal for at least 6 feet at the discharge end.
 If the concrete remaining in the pipeline is to be used, discharge the concrete in such a manner that there is no
 contamination or segregation.
 Take samples of the plastic concrete according to AASHTO T 141 from the discharge end of the pipeline.
 Immediately deliver the samples to the ME for testing. If the RE determines that this is not feasible, the ME
 will sample the concrete before and after pumping and will develop adjustment factors for slump and air
 content. The ME will use the adjustment factors to determine the acceptability of slump and air content.
 
 When using spreaders to separate forms, remove spreaders while placing the concrete. If the reinforcement steel or
 forms settle or move, cease placing concrete and immediately notify the RE. Place concrete uniformly to avoid
 rehandling. After initial placement of the concrete, do not jar forms or place strain on the ends of projecting
 reinforcement.
 Consolidate the concrete using internal mechanical vibrators. When required, supplement vibrating by hand
 spading to ensure proper and adequate consolidation. Provide at least 1 additional standby vibrating unit for
 individual concrete placements in excess of 10 cubic yards.
 Use vibrators to work the concrete around the reinforcement steel and embedded fixtures and into corners and
 angles of the forms. Ensure proper vibration of the concrete to avoid honeycombing and voids. Do not use
 vibrators to move or spread concrete into position. Do not over vibrate concrete.
 Float the external surface of concrete during placing to force coarse aggregate from the surface and to bring mortar
 against the forms to produce a smooth finish substantially free from water and air pockets or honeycombs. For
 sidewalks, driveways, and islands, apply surface texture using a broom before applying curing materials.
 After placing concrete for elevated structures, check and, if necessary, adjust forms and falsework to the specified
 position before the concrete has taken its initial set.
 
 185
 
 When placing concrete for bearing areas, finish concrete to the specified elevation. If the elevation of the finished
 surface is higher than specified, bushhammer to the specified elevation. If the elevation of the finished surface is
 lower than specified, submit a plan to the RE for approval detailing the method to correct the deficiency.
 Monitor the internal temperature of the concrete 6 inches below the surface. If the temperature of the concrete
 exceeds 160 °F, the RE may direct the forms to be loosened or opened.
 E.
 
 Placing Mass Concrete. When mass concrete is shown on the Plans submit a thermal curing plan to the RE at
 least 30 days before placing concrete. At a minimum, include the following requirements in the plan:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 6.
 7.
 
 Concrete mix design, including pozzolanic materials to control concrete temperature.
 Adjustments to form removal and loading times for slower strength gains for high pozzolan mixes.
 An analysis of the anticipated thermal developments within placements using proposed materials and
 casting methods.
 A plan outlining specific measures to be taken to control the temperature differential within the limits.
 The proposed monitoring system.
 Outline of corrective actions to control the temperature differential and maximum internal temperature.
 Proposed methods of repairs or corrective actions if the mass concrete member is not accepted.
 
 Place concrete as specified in 504.03.02.D.
 When curing concrete, ensure that the temperature differential of the mass concrete does not exceed 35 °F between
 the internal and external temperature of concrete. Measure the internal temperature as close as possible to the
 center of the member, but not less than 12 inches from the surface. Measure the external temperature of the
 concrete at an exposed surface.
 Monitor the temperature differential and the maximum internal temperature with monitoring devices that
 continuously record temperature for 15 days. Provide the RE with a copy of each set of readings. Provide
 temperature-monitoring devices to record temperature between the interior and exterior of the member at points
 approved by the RE and monitor the mass placement to measure temperature differentials. Monitor the temperature
 until the interior temperature is within 35 °F of the lowest ambient temperature or a maximum of 15 days. Provide
 the RE with a copy of each set of readings as they are taken and a temperature chart for each mass placement
 member showing temperature readings versus time.
 If monitoring indicates that the proposed measures are not controlling the concrete temperature differential to
 within 35 °F and the maximum internal temperature of 160 °F, implement corrective actions according to the
 thermal curing plan to maintain the temperature differential.
 F.
 
 Applying Curing Materials. After float finishing and when marring of the concrete will not occur, apply curing
 materials within 30 minutes after finishing. The RE will suspend concrete operations if the curing procedure is
 delayed or is not followed. Cure the concrete using the following materials:
 1.
 
 Curing Compound. Apply 2 coats of curing compound, as provided by the manufacturer, each at a rate of 1
 gallon per 200 square feet of surface in a continuous, uniform film with pressure spraying equipment. Do not
 apply curing compound to exposed construction joint areas. Apply the second coat between 15 and 30
 minutes of applying the first coat. If the method of applying the curing compound produces a nonuniform
 film, discontinue application and correct the procedure. If the procedure cannot produce the required results,
 use another curing option.
 Protect the treated surface, as specified in 504.03.02.I, from damage for at least 72 hours. If precipitation falls
 on the newly coated concrete before the film has dried sufficiently to resist damage, or if the film is damaged
 in any other way, apply an additional coat of curing compound at the original specified rate.
 Do not apply curing compound to concrete surfaces that will receive a subsequent concrete placement.
 Remove curing compound from concrete surfaces that will receive a subsequent concrete placement.
 
 2.
 
 Wet Burlap and White Polyethylene Sheeting. Pre-soak burlap strips for at least 24 hours before placing.
 Cover the concrete with strips of wet burlap at least 4 feet longer than the width of the slab to cover the sides.
 Lay the strips across the slab and overlap at least 1/2 the width of the strip to provide a double thickness of
 burlap. Ensure that the burlap remains wet throughout the specified curing period. Ensure that the wet burlap
 does not add excess water to the concrete surface.
 
 186
 
 Cover the wet burlap with white polyethylene sheeting. Overlap sections of polyethylene sheeting at least 18
 inches. Place the white polyethylene sheeting and weigh down to ensure that it remains in contact with the
 surface. Where reinforcement steel protrudes, ensure that the white polyethylene sheeting is draped, and
 overlapped over the structure to protect any exposed areas. Extend white polyethylene sheeting 4 feet beyond
 the edges of the concrete. Replace or restore polyethylene sheeting that is damaged or disturbed.
 3.
 
 White Polyethylene Sheeting. Overlap sections of polyethylene sheeting at least 18 inches. Place the
 polyethylene sheeting and weigh down to ensure that it remains in contact with the surface. Where
 reinforcement steel protrudes, ensure that the polyethylene sheeting is draped and overlapped over the
 structure to protect any exposed areas. Extend the polyethylene sheeting 4 feet beyond the edges of the
 concrete. Replace or restore polyethylene sheeting that is damaged or disturbed.
 
 Maintain curing materials for arches and culverts for at least 7 days; for other concrete placements, maintain for at
 least 3 days. When using protective measures for cold weather concreting, as specified in 504.03.02.C.1 maintain
 the curing materials until the protective measures are removed.
 G.
 
 Removal of Forms and Falsework. The Department may require concrete strength tests as specified in the
 Special Provisions for removal of forms and falsework. Remove forms without damaging the surface. The
 Contractor may remove forms 24 hours after placing concrete, except for the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 4.
 
 5.
 
 6.
 7.
 8.
 
 Remove barrier curb and parapet forms as soon as the concrete holds its shape to facilitate finishing.
 When using concrete that contains more than 20 percent fly ash by weight of total cementitious material,
 maintain the forms for at least 3 days.
 The Contractor may remove forms for wing walls after 3 days if the concrete has attained a strength of
 3000 pounds per square inch as determined from 2 concrete cylinders field cured according to AASHTO
 T 23. If concrete cylinders for wing walls are not tested, or do not meet a strength 3000 pounds per
 square inch when tested before 14 days, the Contractor may not remove forms until 14 days after the
 concrete has been placed.
 The Contractor may remove forms for battered columns or pier caps after 3 days if the concrete has
 attained a strength of 4000 pounds per square inch as determined from 2 concrete cylinders field cured
 according to AASHTO T 23. If concrete cylinders for battered columns or pier caps are not tested, or do
 not meet a strength 4000 pounds per square inch when tested before 14 days, the Contractor may not
 remove forms until 14 days after the concrete has been placed.
 The Contractor may remove forms for arches or culverts after 7 days if the concrete has attained a
 strength of 4000 pounds per square inch as determined from 2 concrete cylinders field cured according
 to AASHTO T 23. If concrete cylinders for arches or culverts are not tested, or do not meet a strength of
 4000 pounds per square inch when tested before 14 days, the Contractor may not remove forms until 14
 days after the concrete has been placed. Do not remove falsework and centering for spandrel-filled
 arches before the abutments have been placed up to the spring line.
 Do not remove falsework supporting the deck of rigid frame structures until the embankment has been
 placed behind the vertical legs.
 When using protective measures for cold weather concreting, as specified in 504.03.02.C.1, do not
 remove the forms until the protective measures are removed regardless of concrete cylinder strength.
 Do not remove the forms for decks for 14 days.
 
 For elevated formwork, lower centering gradually to prevent damage to the structure. Remove falsework from
 continuous or cantilevered structures to ensure that the structure is gradually subjected to its working stress.
 H.
 
 Finishing Concrete Surface. Finish the surface of the concrete immediately after removing the forms. Apply a
 Class 1 finish to surfaces not exposed to view. Apply a Class 2 finish to all surfaces exposed to view.
 Do not begin finishing a surface until the entire face of the structure is completed to ensure a uniform texture and
 color. For barrier curb and parapet, apply a Class 2 finish within 48 hours of placing concrete. The classes of
 concrete finish are as follows:
 1.
 
 Class 1, Surface Finish. Remove projecting wire or metal devices that have been used for holding the forms
 in place. If the wire or metal device cannot be removed, cut the wire or metal device at least 1 inch below the
 surface of the concrete. Remove lips of mortar and irregularities caused by form joints. Ensure that all
 construction and expansion joints are tooled and free of mortar and concrete.
 
 187
 
 Patch holes, depressions, voids, and honeycombs by chipping away coarse or broken material until a dense
 uniform surface of concrete exposing solid coarse aggregate is obtained. Cut away feathered edges to form
 faces perpendicular to the surface. Saturate the surfaces of the deficient area with water, then fill the deficient
 area with stiff mortar. Finish the surface of the mortar with a wooden float before initial set takes place.
 When patching large or deep areas as determined by the RE, patch the area using the same mix design
 concrete as the surrounding concrete. Chip away coarse or broken material until a dense uniform surface of
 concrete exposing solid coarse aggregate is obtained. Cut away feathered edges to form faces perpendicular
 to the surface. Saturate the surface of the area with water, then apply a layer of bonding compound to the
 area. Fill the area with the concrete. Finish the surface of the concrete with a wooden float before initial set
 takes place.
 The Department may reject a structure for having areas of excessive honeycombs as directed by the RE.
 2.
 
 I.
 
 Class 2, Rubbed Finish. After performing a Class 1 finish, rub surfaces with a wetted wooden block or a
 medium coarse carborundum stone, using a small amount of mortar on its face. Do not use the carborundum
 stone until the concrete has hardened to the state where the sand grinds rather than ravels or rolls. Continue
 rubbing until form marks, projections, and irregularities have been removed, voids are filled, and a uniform
 surface has been obtained. Leave the paste produced by this rubbing in place. After the entire surface of the
 structure has been rubbed and the paste has dried, obtain the final finish by rubbing with a fine carborundum
 stone and water until the entire surface is of a smooth texture and uniform color.
 
 Protecting Concrete Structures. Post warning tape around flatwork such as bridge decks, pavement, sidewalks,
 driveways, and islands during the curing period. Provide wet burlap or polyethylene sheeting to protect the edges
 and surface of the plastic concrete from precipitation.
 Do not drive piles within 200 feet of concrete that is being placed or has been placed within the previous 24 hours
 unless approved by the RE. Ensure that salt or brackish water does not come in contact with the concrete for a
 period of 28 days after being placed.
 
 J.
 
 Loading Concrete Structures. Do not allow anything other than the curing materials on concrete surfaces for 24
 hours after placing the concrete. The Contractor may begin constructing forms for subsequent concrete placements
 after the forms from the underlying concrete can be removed as specified in 504.03.02.G. After the forms have
 been constructed and at least 3 days after the underlying concrete has been placed, the Contractor may perform
 subsequent concrete placements. The Contractor may begin storing materials, backfilling, or other loading on the
 concrete surface 3 days after the concrete has been placed if the forms can be removed as specified in 504.03.02.G.
 
 504.03.03 Epoxy Waterproofing
 Provide a copy of the manufacturer’s recommendations to the RE at least 5 days before applying epoxy waterproofing.
 Apply epoxy waterproofing to abutment and pier seats after applying the finish and at least 3 days after stripping the
 forms, and to the tops of slabs of culverts having less than 2 feet of fill and an HMA overlay directly over that slab. Do
 not apply epoxy waterproofing to riding surfaces.
 Immediately before application, clean the surfaces of dirt, grease, form oil, or other foreign material that may have
 accumulated. Do not apply epoxy waterproofing unless the ambient temperature is between 40 and 85 °F at the time of
 application. Mix and apply the epoxy waterproofing according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. If necessary,
 bushhammer bearing surfaces to their proper elevations before applying the epoxy waterproofing. Apply 2 coats of
 epoxy waterproofing using a brush or roller. Allow the first coat to dry before applying the second coat. Ensure that the
 total thickness of the coatings is 10 mils.
 While the second coat is still tacky, broadcast grit at uniform rate of 5 pounds per square yard over the top surfaces by
 hand, except on masonry plate bearing areas. After the epoxy waterproofing has set, brush off excess grit and dispose of
 as specified in 201.03.09.
 Allow the epoxy waterproofing to completely dry before placing any material against the concrete member.

 C.
 
 Shipping and Handling. At least 5 days before shipping the steel, submit to the RE for approval all shipping and
 storage details. Ensure that structural steel is handled and shipped as specified in 906.04.04. Ensure that the steel
 is protected from the binding chains during shipping using softeners approved by the ME. Use padded hooks and
 slings to hoist steel. Space diaphragms and similar pieces to ensure that the coatings are not damaged by rubbing
 during shipment. Do not store steel on the ground. Ensure that members do not fall or rest on each other.
 
 D.
 
 Erecting. Ensure that stringers and built-up girders involving field splices are completely preassembled in the
 shop, with account taken to their relative position in the finished structure as to grade, camber, and curvature. The
 Contractor may erect the built-up stringer or girder as a unit, as allowed by traffic conditions.
 Obtain Department approval before welding to members or parts of members subject to tension or reversal of
 stress. If necessary to weld in these areas, ensure that the actual stress range at the point of attachment does not
 exceed the value for Category F according to the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specification. If field welded
 splices are made, inspect splices using nondestructive tests at the site of erection.
 Unless otherwise approved, construct embankments in back of the abutment walls to at least 50 percent of their
 height, before placing structural steel.
 Erect structural steel according to Section 11 of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Construction Specifications. Ensure
 that temporary attachments or supports for scaffolding or forms do not damage the coating system of the steel. Use
 sufficient support pads for fascia bracing.
 
 193
 
 Provide lateral support when hoisting members into position so as to prevent lateral buckling or other damage.
 Ensure that bolt heads of high-strength bolts are on the outside of fascia stringers.
 E.
 
 Installing High-Strength Steel Bolts. Check galvanized bolts and nuts to verify that a visible lubricant is on the
 threads. Check black bolts and nuts to verify that they are oily to the touch.
 Provide a Skidmore-Wilhelm calibrator or an acceptable equivalent tension measuring device on the Project during
 erection. Verify each lot of DTIs using the Skidmore-Wilhelm calibrator as specified in NJDOT S-3.
 Before beginning bolt installation, perform the rotational-capacity test, as specified in 908.02.02.C, on 2 assemblies
 from each rotational-capacity lot. If assemblies do not meet the rotational capacity requirements when tested at the
 work site, the Contractor may clean and relubricate the bolt assemblies in the rotational-capacity lot. After cleaning
 and relubricating, retest the assemblies for compliance to the rotational capacity requirements.
 Ensure that the bolt, nut, and washer are from the same rotational-capacity lot. If the DTI is used under the nut,
 place an additional washer between the nut and the protrusions on the DTI. If recommended by the bolt
 manufacturer, the Contractor may use wax lubricant, beeswax, or a water wax emulsion to aid in installation. Hold
 the bolt head stationary while tightening the nut.
 Install bolts in all of the holes of the connection and tighten to a snug-tight condition to compact the joint. Ensure
 that the number of spaces in the DTI in which a 0.005-inch feeler gauge is refused after snugging does not exceed
 the maximum snug-tight refusals as specified in Table 506.03.01-1. If the number of refusals exceeds the
 maximum, remove the assembly, insert a new DTI, and resnug.
 Tighten the assemblies successively from the most rigid part of the connection to the free edges by turning the nuts
 while holding the bolts stationary. Tension the assemblies until the number of spaces in which the 0.005-inch
 thickness gauge is refused meets or exceeds the minimum final tension refusals specified in Table 506.03.01-1.

 If the DTI is coated and under the nut, the maximum snug tight refusals is the number of spaces on the DTI minus one.
 If the DTI is coated and under the nut, the minimum final tension refusals is the number of spaces on the DTI.
 
 If an assembly is tightened so that there are no visible gaps remaining in any of the spaces on the DTI, the assembly
 has been over-tightened. Remove and replace over-tightened assemblies.
 For painted steel, apply 3 coats of an organic paint system, supplied by the same manufacturer as the originally
 applied inorganic zinc system, to the field bolted connections.
 F.
 
 Repairing Damaged Coating. Repair damaged coatings as directed by the RE. Use an organic zinc coating

 Shipping and Storing. Ensure that bearings are handled and shipped as specified in 907.01.03. Store bearing
 devices and components in an area at the work site that provides protection from environmental and physical
 damage.
 Inspect bearings within 1 week after the bearings arrive on the Project. Following the inspection, re-wrap the
 bearings and keep the bearings clean until installation. Do not dismantle bearings at the work site unless necessary
 for inspection or installation. If it is necessary to open or dismantle bearings at the work site, obtain RE approval
 and do so under the direct supervision of the manufacturer.
 When installing, ensure that the bearings are clean and free of all foreign substances.
 
 C.
 
 Installing Bearings. Install bearings as follows:
 1.
 
 Anchor Bolts. Provide anchor bolts in abutments and piers for bearings that are either cast-in-place, cast in 3inch diameter corrugated sleeves, or cast in holes drilled after the concrete has set; however, the RE will
 prohibit drilling in rigid frame and T-type piers. If using anchor bolt sleeves, ensure that the anchor bolts are
 circumferentially corrugated and are galvanized steel or plastic. Ensure that the wall thickness of the sleeves
 is sufficient to withstand the construction loads applied to them. If drilling holes to cast bolts in, core drill the
 holes at least 1 inch larger in diameter than the diameter of the bolts. Ensure that the reinforcement steel is
 not damaged during core drilling.
 Prevent the collection and freezing of water in holes during the time between when the anchor bolts are set
 and when the bearings are placed. Fill holes with an environmentally safe antifreeze, seal the top with a
 watertight cap, and coat with a rubber-asphalt joint sealer. Before setting the bearing, remove the
 environmentally safe antifreeze and other foreign material from the holes. Set the bolts by filling the holes
 with non-shrink grout.
 
 2.
 
 Bridge Seat Bearing Areas. Do not place bearing plates on bridge seat bearing areas that are irregular or
 improperly finished or deformed. Ensure that the epoxy waterproofing has been applied and is cured before
 placing bearings. Immediately before placing the bedding material and installing bearings or masonry plates,
 clean the contact surfaces of the concrete and steel.
 Ensure that all bearing plates are set level in position and have full contact. When setting bearing plates on
 masonry, pad the plates using an elastomeric bearing pad.
 
 3.
 
 Setting Bearings. Allow for the effect of stress deformation and temperature changes when setting bearings.
 Use swedged or threaded anchor bolts to ensure a secure grip upon the material used to embed them in the
 holes.
 When using seismic isolation bearings, install the isolators level and perpendicular to the gravity load.
 Accommodate superstructure gradients with beveled sole plates. Ensure that there are no obstructions,
 including bolt extensions that prevent the isolators from deforming horizontally in any direction. Clean the
 area around each isolator of all debris and construction materials at the completion of the Contract. Connect
 the isolators to the superstructure and substructures by bolting. Do not weld steel in contact with an isolator.
 
 506.03.03 Shear Connectors
 Ensure that shear connectors conform to Section 7 of the ANSI/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code. When galvanized
 reinforcement steel bars are used, use galvanized shear connectors.
 Install using automatically timed stud welding equipment shear connectors in the field only after the structural steel is
 erected, after the deck forms are installed, and before the reinforcement steel is placed.
 
 195
 
 506.03.04 Steel Pedestrian Bridges
 Submit an erection plan, as specified in 506.03.01.B, at least 20 days before erecting the steel pedestrian bridge. Apply
 intermediate and finish coats of paint to the units either in the shop or on the work site before erection. Repair painted
 areas that are damaged during transportation or erection as specified in 506.03.01.F.
 506.03.05 Steel Grid Flooring
 At least 45 days before beginning the work, submit working drawings for approval.
 Construct steel grid flooring according to Section 12 of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Construction Specifications. Place
 concrete for filled type grid flooring as specified in 504.03.02.D.
 506.03.06 Repair Galvanizing
 Where limited areas of galvanized surfaces are damaged during shipping or erection, repair the areas using any of the 3
 methods in ASTM A 780. Ensure that the repair achieves the minimum coating thickness specified for the item.
 Paint galvanized surfaces only when directed by the RE. If painting is directed, treat the galvanized surface according to
 the manufacturer’s recommendations, the apply the epoxy intermediate and urethane finish coats only.

 1.
 
 2.
 3.
 4.
 B.
 
 Design the expansion joint system to accommodate all expected longitudinal movements as well as
 vertical and horizontal rotations. Incorporate strip seal glands with a maximum movement range of 3.15
 inches per seal. Support each separation beam with an independent support bar that is welded to the
 separation beam. Suspend the support bars over the joint opening by sliding elastomeric bearings.
 Incorporate an equidistant control system that develops its maximum compressive force when the joint is
 at its maximum opening. Do not use bolted connections between the separator beams and support bars.
 Design the splices to consist of a bolted separator beam splice.
 Design and fatigue test the transverse separation beams, support bars, and other structural elements
 according to NCHRP Report 402 Fatigue Design of Modular Bridge Expansion Joints and Chapter 14 of
 the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specification.
 Design the elastomeric springs and bearings to be removable and replaceable.
 
 Installation. Ensure that expansion joint systems are self-supported and continuous across the full width of the
 deck and continue into traffic barriers and curbing. Provide to the RE a copy of the manufacturer’s
 recommendations for the joint system’s installation. Provide a joint installation temperature chart on the working
 drawings ranging from −10 to 110 °F. Install one of the following joint systems according to the manufacturer’s

 1.
 
 Strip Seal Expansion Joint Assemblies. Strip seal expansion joint assemblies include molded neoprene
 rubber gland, parallel steel rail sections, and all hardware necessary to form a mechanical connection between
 the metal components and the bridge deck.
 For strip seal expansion joint assemblies, place closed-cell foam backer rod in the seal cavity of the steel
 retainer rails before placing the deck slab concrete. Ensure that the backer rod remains in place until the
 rubber gland seal is installed. Do not field splice molded neoprene rubber glands or preformed elastomeric
 compression seal. Repair galvanized coating that is damaged before or during installation.
 
 2.
 
 Preformed Elastomeric Joint Assemblies. Preformed elastomeric joint assemblies include preformed
 elastomeric compression seal, parallel steel rail sections, and all hardware necessary to form a mechanical
 connection between the metal components and the bridge deck.
 
 3.
 
 Modular Expansion Joint Assemblies. Modular expansion joint assemblies include preformed neoprene
 strip seals that are held in place by steel edge and separation beams, a support bar to support the separation
 beam, and sliding elastomeric bearings. These assemblies contain no bolted connections.
 
 Take precautions to protect the joint system from damage after installation. Provide a bridge, or a method to
 protect the joint system from construction vehicle damage to the satisfaction of the RE.
 When installing the joints, ensure that they are in the correct position during the concrete placement. Ensure that
 the installed joint system matches the roadway profile and finished grades. Adjust the opening at expansion joints
 to correspond with the installation temperature chart.
 507.03.02 Constructing Bridge Decks
 A.
 
 Forms. Construct forms as follows:
 1.
 
 Stay-In-Place (SIP) Forms. Submit working drawings for certification that include the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 
 Deck reinforcement location.
 Grade of steel.
 Galvanizing specification.
 Physical and section properties for all permanent steel bridge deck form sheets.
 Locations where the forms are supported by steel flanges subject to tensile stresses.
 
 Provide form cut and fill grade sheets. Weld form supports to the flange of stringer or floor beam, except in
 the areas where flanges are subjected to tensile stress. Ensure that SIP forms do not rest directly on the top of
 the stringer or floor beam flanges. Fasten SIP forms to form supports and ensure that a minimum bearing
 length of 1 inch at each end is achieved. Do not flame-cut SIP forms. Cut vertical legs for form supports at or
 below the bottom of the deck slab to maintain the required concrete cover for reinforcement steel at all
 locations.
 Do not use SIP forms where longitudinal deck construction joints are located between stringers or outside of
 the fascia stringers.
 Weld SIP forms according to ANSI/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code pertaining to fillet welds. The
 Contractor may use a 1/8-inch fillet weld. Do not weld flanges in tension or structural steel bridge members
 fabricated from non-weldable grades of steel.
 Repair permanently exposed form metal whose galvanized coating has been damaged as specified in
 506.03.01.F.
 2.
 
 B.
 
 Removable Forms. Construct removable forms as specified in 504.03.02.B. Do not use shoring to support
 stringers along the span length where the superstructure, under live load and impact loads, is designed for
 composite action.
 
 Deck Placement Plan. At least 15 days before the start of placing bridge deck concrete, submit to the RE for
 approval a plan of operation that includes the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 SIP form cut and fill grade sheets.
 A screed and rail erection plan.
 Deck grades.
 
 198
 
 4.
 5.
 6.
 7.
 8.
 9.
 
 Sequence and rate of placing concrete.
 Number and type of personnel performing the work.
 Number, type, and model of equipment to be used in handling, placing, and finishing the concrete
 including the weight of the finishing machine.
 Request for a change in the number, location, or configuration of construction joints.
 Method of maintaining the evaporation rate below 0.15 pounds per square foot per hour.
 Type of fog misting equipment if used.
 
 C.
 
 Meeting. Within 10 days before the start of deck placement, conduct a meeting with the RE, the ME, and the
 concrete supplier to discuss the plan of operation and to coordinate the deck placement.
 
 D.
 
 Installing Joint Assemblies. Ensure that joint assemblies are installed as specified in 507.03.01.B.
 
 E.
 
 Installing Reinforcement Steel. Ensure that reinforcement steel is installed as specified in 504.03.01.
 
 F.
 
 Limitations of Placing Concrete. Comply with the limitations of placing specified in 504.03.02.C, except do not
 place concrete when the ambient temperature is above 85 °F. If within the 12 hours before the concrete placement
 the National Weather Service http://www.nws.noaa.gov/ locally forecasts a 40 percent chance or greater of
 precipitation during the scheduled concrete placement, postpone the placement of bridge decks and pavement.
 Do not place concrete when the atmospheric evaporation rate is greater than 0.15 pounds per square foot per hour.
 The Contractor may use fog misting, wind shields, or other methods approved by the RE to keep the evaporation
 rate below 0.15 pounds per square foot per hour. If using fog misting, ensure that the fog misting equipment is
 capable of delivering 2 to 3 gallons of water per minute at 2000 to 2500 pounds per square inch using a 40-degree
 to 50-degree wide-angle nozzle. Position the fog nozzle 6 feet above the concrete surface. Do not use fog misting
 to apply water for finishing purposes. Immediately cease fog misting if water accumulates on the surface.
 The ME will measure air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed at the location of the deck placement. The
 ME will measure concrete temperatures from the sample used for slump and air content tests. The ME will perform
 measurements and calculations at least once every 2 hours beginning 1 hour before concrete placement.
 
 G.
 
 Performing the Dry Run. Perform a dry run with the finishing machine over the full length of the bridge segment.
 Ensure that the screed rail supports are spaced no more than 3 feet apart. Adjust the screed to its finishing position
 before performing the dry run. During the dry run, check the height and deflection of screed rails, the cover for
 reinforcement steel, and forms. Make necessary corrections before notifying the RE for inspection.
 If the supports for the rails are located in the deck concrete, ensure that the supports can be removed without
 disturbing the concrete, or partially removed so that no part remains less than 2-1/2 inches below the finished
 concrete surface.
 The RE will not inspect the dry run until it is evident that the placement and finishing operation can be completed
 within the scheduled time, that any required weather protective materials are in place, and that all necessary
 finishing tools and equipment are on hand at the work site.
 The RE will check to ensure that elevations are within ±1/4 inch of the specified elevations. The RE will check
 elevations longitudinally every 10 feet and transversely at the edges of breaklines, joint assemblies, gutter grades,
 and the center of each lane and shoulder. The RE may direct placement of additional grade stakes in areas with
 rapid changes in grade so that intermediate longitudinal checks can be made.
 Once the RE has approved the dry run, do not make adjustments to the operation without RE approval.
 
 H.
 
 Placing Deck Concrete. Provide work bridges or other RE approved means of access to the surface of the deck for
 the purpose of finishing, straightedging, making corrections, and for other operations requiring access to the surface
 of the deck after the passing of the screed. Before placing deck concrete, construct bulkheads in the shape of the
 required deck cross-section.
 When multiple concrete placements are required within a deck structure, follow the numbered sequence shown on
 the Plans, beginning with the lowest number. The Contractor may submit a written request to the RE for approval
 to have this requirement waived if the succeeding sections can be completed within 4 hours after the start of the
 initial section placement. The RE will not allow these requirements to be waived for deck slabs on prestressed
 concrete beams that are continuous for live load.
 Do not place a deck section until the previously placed concrete within the unit has cured for 72 hours.
 
 199
 
 Coordinate concrete placement and initial strike-off by a transverse finishing machine so that initial strike-off is
 between 6 and 8 feet behind the concrete placement.
 Deliver, place, and consolidate the concrete, as specified in 504.03.02.D, at a uniform rate in a continuous
 operation. Ensure that stoppages of concrete placement do not exceed 30 minutes. If there is a stoppage of more
 than 30 minutes, the RE may direct the deck segment be removed and replaced. When placing concrete, maintain a
 minimum rate of 30 cubic yards per hour for deck slabs of 180 cubic yards or less. Maintain a minimum rate of 40
 cubic yards per hour for deck slabs of more than 180 cubic yards of concrete.
 Make as few passes of the machine as are necessary to obtain a smooth, dense surface of the required contour.
 Maintain a small uniform quantity of concrete ahead of the screed on each pass. Ensure that the quantity of
 concrete carried ahead of the screed is not great enough to cause slipping or lifting of the finishing machine on the
 rails at any time.
 If improper adjustment or operation of the finishing machine results in unsatisfactory consolidation, reinforcement
 cover, or surface requirement, immediately correct the unsatisfactory condition.
 If the supports for the rails are located in the deck concrete, remove them before initial set has taken. Fill the
 resulting holes with deck concrete. If the concrete has hardened, fill the holes with non-shrink grout.
 Ensure that all deck concrete is placed before placing sidewalks, curb, and parapet.
 I.
 
 Deck Slab Surface Texture Finish. Texture concrete bridge deck slabs using a broom or burlap drag immediately
 after final strike-off. When using burlap drag, attach a single, full width strip to the finishing machine. Texture the
 concrete deck slab in a transverse direction. Clean the broom or burlap as necessary to provide a uniform texture.
 Provide a smooth finish within 1 foot of curbs and drainage structures. Provide a final finish on sidewalks and top
 of curbs with a fine-bristle broom.
 
 J.
 
 Curing. Within 30 minutes of texturing, apply wet burlap and white polyethylene sheeting as specified in
 504.03.02.F, and maintain for at least 14 days. Ensure that the water used for curing does not leave the bridge
 deck. Do not allow anything on the deck during the 14-day curing period except for personnel necessary to
 maintain curing materials and protective measures. Post warning tape around flatwork during the curing period.
 
 K.
 
 Underdeck Inspection. If the RE determines that underdeck inspection is warranted, the RE will direct the
 removal of at least 1 SIP panel for each span at the location and time selected. As soon as the form is removed, the
 RE will inspect the concrete surfaces for cavities, honeycombing, and other defects. If the RE finds irregularities
 that do not justify rejection of the work, submit a plan to the RE for approval to repair the irregularities. Give the
 concrete a Class 2 finish as specified in 504.03.02.H.2. If the RE determines that the concrete where the form is
 removed is unsatisfactory, remove additional forms for inspection. Remove or repair unsatisfactory concrete. If
 the inspection shows excessive irregularities in the slab, modify the placement plan before placing additional slabs.
 Repair the adjacent metal forms and supports to present a neat appearance, and ensure they are securely fastened.
 
 L.
 
 Saw Cut Grooved Surfacing. Saw cut the deck no earlier than 15 days after placing the concrete. Saw cut before
 opening to traffic.
 Provide 2 approved gauges to the RE to verify groove depth before sawcutting. Include the manufacturer’s
 recommendations for use with the gauges.
 Cut grooves using multi-bladed sawcutting equipment fitted with diamond-tipped circular saw blades. The RE will
 allow the use of single blade saw equipment where necessary to complete the work, as required.
 Cut grooves perpendicular or radial to the centerline of the traveled way. Radially groove in partial-width passes.
 Limit each pass to 1 lane width. Ensure that grooves are between 0.10 and 0.15 inches wide and 1/4 and 3/8 inches
 deep. Space the blades to achieve the distance specified in Table 507.03.02-1 between the centerlines of each
 groove to form a random pattern.
 Table 507.03.02-1 Groove Spacing
 3/4"
 
 1-1/4"
 
 5/8"
 
 1"
 
 5/8"
 
 1-1/4"
 
 3/4"
 
 Perform consecutive passes within 2 inches of the previous pass. Do not cut grooves over an area that has been
 already grooved, or introduce a cutting blade into a groove that has been already established.
 
 200
 
 During grooving operations, the RE will randomly check the groove dimensions. If the minimum groove depth has
 not been achieved, stop grooving operations and make the necessary adjustments.
 Ensure that slurry or debris from the grooving operations does not accumulate in the grooves. Continuously collect
 slurry and dispose of as specified in 201.03.09. Ensure that the slurry does not enter the structure or highway
 drainage system.
 M. Loading the Deck. Before allowing anything on the deck, ensure that the deck has cured for a minimum of 14
 days. The RE may allow the Contractor to place a finishing machine on the deck 72 hours after placing concrete
 for the previous segment. After a minimum of 14 days, the Contractor may load a total of 80,000 pounds on the
 deck if the deck has attained a strength of at least 4000 pounds per square inch, as determined from 1 set of
 cylinders field cured according to AASHTO T 23. After a minimum of 28 days, the Contractor may load more than
 80,000 pounds if the deck has attained the design strength and if approval has been obtained from the Department.
 To obtain approval, submit stress analysis calculations for the load and the location of the load on the deck. The
 Department will not approve stresses that exceed the design allowable by more than 20 percent. If placement of the
 load is allowed, provide matting to protect the surface from damage.
 N.
 
 Concrete Deck Surface Requirements
 1.
 
 Acceptance Testing. Construct deck slabs so that less than 9 percent of the measured length of the lot
 exceeds a 1/8-inch tolerance in 10 feet. The ME will test the surface of concrete bridge deck slabs with a
 rolling straightedge that automatically marks the length of deck surface variations that exceed the tolerance of
 1/8 inch in 10 feet.
 The RE will determine conformance to the surface tolerance for concrete deck slabs in lots, each lot being
 equal to the number of cubic yards of deck concrete placed in the designated lanes of traffic from joint
 assembly to joint assembly. The RE will calculate such lot quantity using the specified nominal deck
 thickness, excluding the quantity of concrete placed in haunches, end dams, and diaphragms.
 The RE will base acceptance on the percentage of the total length of the lot having surface variation exceeding
 1/8 inch in 10 feet, this percent noncompliance being defined as the Lot Percent Defective Length. To
 compute the lot percent defective length, add the lengths of individual surface defects exceeding the specified
 tolerance, and divide this sum by the total length tested, then multiply by 100 to convert to percent.
 The RE will test the full extent of the lot in the longitudinal direction. The transverse location of the test
 generally is in the wheelpaths of vehicle travel, which are defined as the 2 imaginary lines located
 approximately 3 feet on each side of the centerline of the lane and extending for the full length of the lane.
 If the lot percent defective length equals or exceeds 25 on any machine finished deck (irrespective of whether
 such machine finishing was required or optional) or 35 on a manually struck and finished deck, the RE may
 order any or all of the concrete in the lot to be removed, replaced, and retested for acceptance. If the RE
 allows the concrete to remain in place, apply a 15 percent reduction to the payment request for the lot.

 Reduction Per Lot, Percent
 
 0 - 8.9
 9.0 - 13.9
 14.0 - 24.9
 
 none
 1.0
 7.0
 
 Surface Remedial Measures. Regardless of the overall surface conformity of a lot of bridge deck concrete,
 if surface deviations have a detrimental effect on deck drainage or reinforcement steel cover, the RE may
 require appropriate remedial measures to restore any or all of the deck slab surface to the required grades and
 surface tolerance. When such remedial procedures are ordered by the RE, submit a plan detailing the intended
 limits of the surface restoration and the methods, equipment, and materials proposed for use.
 After completion of the surface restoration measures, the ME will retest the lot containing the affected area.
 
 O.
 
 Opening to Traffic. Do not allow vehicular traffic of any kind on the deck slab until the deck has been saw cut
 grooved finished as specified in 507.03.02.L.
 
 201
 
 507.03.03 Date Panel
 Submit a sample of the date panel showing the coloring and surface finish to the RE for approval. Ensure that the date
 panel is cast true and straight in a single unit that includes anchors. Ensure that the material used to color the concrete is
 nonfading. Ensure that the arrises are clean and accurate. Install the date panel into the parapet using epoxy grout.
 507.03.04 Concrete Bridge Sidewalk
 Ensure that the concrete deck has cured for at least 14 days before beginning sidewalk construction. Construct forms as
 specified in 504.03.02.B. Ensure that the reinforcement steel is placed as specified in 504.03.01. Place concrete as
 specified in 504.03.02.D. Float-finish concrete before applying a surface texture with a broom. Apply curing materials
 as specified in 504.03.02.F and maintain for 3 days. Post warning tape around the sidewalk during the curing period.
 Follow the loading restrictions as specified in 504.03.02.J.
 507.03.05 Concrete Parapet and Barrier Curb
 Ensure that the concrete deck has cured for at least 14 days before beginning parapet or barrier curb construction.
 Construct moldings, panel work, and bevel strips true to line and grade with neatly mitered joints. Ensure that corners in
 the finished work are true, clean cut, and free from cracks, spalls or other defects. Construct barrier curb using the fixed
 form method. Construct parapet to support bridge lighting foundations using the fixed-form method. Construct parapet
 not supporting bridge lighting foundations using 1 of the following methods:
 1.
 
 Fixed-Form Method. Construct forms as specified in 504.03.02.B. Ensure that the reinforcement steel is
 placed as specified in 504.03.01. Place concrete as specified in 504.03.02.D. Remove the forms as soon as
 the concrete holds its shape, and immediately apply the Class 2 finish as specified in 504.03.02.H.2. Ensure
 that the application of the Class 2 finish is completed within 48 hours of placing concrete.
 
 2.
 
 Slip-Form Method. At least 20 days before beginning the work, submit the proposed equipment, methods,
 and processes for the construction of the slip-formed concrete parapet to the RE for approval. Provide, to the
 RE, evidence of successful history and operation of the slip-form machine or other equipment. Design and
 construct a support system to restrain the reinforcement cage during slip-forming, so that displacement will
 not occur. Locate the reinforcement steel so that after the joints are saw cut the reinforcement steel will have
 the minimum concrete clear cover as shown on the Plans.
 Ensure that the slip-forming machine consolidates the freshly placed concrete in 1 complete pass of the
 machine. Ensure that the forming portion of the slip-form machine is readily adjustable vertically, during the
 forward motion of the machine. If information on the history is not available, construct a test section, at least
 100 feet long, at the Project Limits, to verify that the proposed equipment, material, and methods are capable
 of producing the required concrete parapet.
 Attach a grade line gauge or pointer to the machine to ensure that a continual comparison can be made
 between the barrier being placed and the established grade line as indicated by the offset guide line.
 When using the slip-form method, supply concrete to the slip-form machine at a uniform rate to produce a
 completely shaped parapet. Ensure that the machine is operated to produce consolidated concrete free from
 surface pits larger that 1/2 inch in diameter and 1/4 inch in depth and that requires no additional handling.
 If concrete placement is interrupted, protect from drying by covering the placed concrete with several layers
 of wet burlap. If the interruption exceeds 30 minutes, install a construction dam or bulkhead. If the
 interruption exceeds 90 minutes, discontinue any further placement. The Contractor may resume concrete
 placement at the joint beyond the bulkhead after 12 hours, measured from the start of delay, has elapsed. If
 the RE determines that the length of placement between the bulkhead and the next joint cannot be slip-formed,
 form the section by methods other than slip-forming.
 Remove all loose and otherwise unsatisfactory materials from the surface of the cold joints. Obtain approval
 from the RE before using tools for this purpose. Scrub the surface with a wire broom and keep wet until new
 concrete is placed. Immediately before placing concrete, apply the epoxy bonding coat according to the
 manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Within 4 hours of slip-forming, saw cut contraction joints to a maximum depth of 1 inch past the troweled
 “V” notch groove to prevent shrinkage cracking.
 
 202
 
 Cure using curing compound as specified 504.03.02.F. If drilling is required for subsequent construction, allow the
 concrete to cure for a minimum of 3 days before drilling.
 507.03.06 4-Bar Open Steel Parapet
 Ensure that the deck has cured for at least 14 days before placing concrete for 4-bar open steel parapet. Place concrete
 for 4-bar open steel parapet as specified in 504.03.02.D. Do not drill for 4-bar open steel parapet installation until the
 concrete has cured for at least 3 days. Install as shown on the Plans.
 507.03.07 Bridge Approach
 Prepare the underlying surface as specified in 405.03.01.
 Set forms as specified in 504.03.02.B, place reinforcement steel as specified in 504.03.01, and set joint ties for the entire
 area to be paved at least 1 day before placing concrete. Set forms at grade in full contact with the underlying surface.
 Install longitudinal joint ties through the forms and secure in place. Ensure that concrete does not seep around the bar. If
 longitudinal joint ties cannot be installed before placing concrete, install as specified in 405.03.02.C.
 Check the alignment and grade elevations of the forms and joint ties and make corrections before placing the concrete.
 Ensure that the forms do not deviate from the required alignment by more than 1/4 inch. Reset, or remove and replace
 forms that settle or deflect under the spreading and finishing equipment. Clean the top and face of forms, and oil the face
 before placing concrete.
 Comply with the limitations of placing specified in 507.03.02.F. Place concrete as specified in 507.03.02.H. Apply the
 surface texture as specified in 507.03.02.I. Cure the concrete as specified in 507.03.02.J. Saw cut the surface as
 specified in 507.03.02.L.
 Follow the loading restrictions as specified in 507.03.02.M. Do not allow vehicular traffic of any kind on the approach
 until the it has been saw cut grooved finished.

 epoxy paint. Replace or repair units damaged by improper storing, transporting, or handling.
 
 C.
 
 Wall Foundation. Excavate as specified in 202.03.03. Shape and compact the underlying material to produce a
 firm, even surface. Obtain RE approval before finishing excavation. If the RE determines that the bottom of the
 excavation is unstable, undercut, backfill, and compact as directed by the RE. Grade the foundation for the
 structure level for a width that exceeds the length of the soil reinforcement by at least 2 feet.
 Place concrete, as specified in 504.03.02.D, for an unreinforced concrete leveling footing, or provide a precast
 concrete leveling pad according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Before placing wall units, install underdrains and drainage pipes.
 
 D.
 
 Installing. Provide 2 copies of the manufacturer’s recommendations to the RE. If a section of wall is to be cast-inplace, construct the section as specified 504.03.02.D. Obtain RE approval of the foundation for the structure before
 beginning erection. Install the units according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. For erection, handle units
 with lifting devices set into the upper edge of the panels. Place units in a horizontal course. Do not place the
 subsequent course until the previous course is backfilled within 2 inches of the top of the course.
 Provide external bracing for the initial course. While erecting each course, examine line, and grade, and correct
 deviations to prevent cumulative inaccuracies in alignment. Vertical tolerance and horizontal alignment tolerance
 shall not exceed 1/2 inch, when measured along a straightedge. Install joint filler and rubber pads according to the
 manufacturer’s recommendations. Close joints at corners or angle points.
 Ensure that all wall units above the first course interlock with the lower courses. Vertical joint openings on the
 wall’s front face shall not exceed 3/4 inch. The front face vertical joints shall have 12-inch wide strips of
 subsurface drainage geotextile behind each joint starting 2 feet below grade.
 
 E.
 
 Back of Wall Drainage. Place a stone pocket, subsurface drainage geotextile, and an 8-inch corrugated steel
 underdrain pipe as shown on the Plans.
 When constructing weep holes, place ports or vents for equalizing hydrostatic pressure below low water. Use 4inch PVC or unreinforced concrete drain pipe as forms for weep holes through concrete.
 
 F.
 
 Backfilling. For MSE walls, place reinforcement perpendicular to the face of the wall, unless otherwise shown on
 the Plans or directed. Before placing soil reinforcement, compact the backfill material as specified in 513.03.01.G.
 For modular bin walls, fill wall units 4 feet or less in height in 1 lift and then thoroughly compact with a vibratory
 tamping device. Fill wall units more than 4 feet in height in 2 approximately equal lifts and thoroughly compact
 after each layer is placed.
 
 212
 
 Backfill after erecting each course of wall units. Verify that the reinforcements and wall units are not damaged,
 disturbed, or misaligned while backfilling. Correct misalignment and remove and replace damaged units of the
 wall units before placing the next course. Backfill using 1 of the following materials:
 1.
 
 Soil Aggregate (I-15) or Soil Aggregate (I-9) and Coarse Aggregate No. 57. For MSE walls, use I-15 soil
 aggregate. The Contractor may use I-9 soil aggregate or No. 57 coarse aggregate in place of I-15 soil
 aggregate for modular walls.
 Do not exceed 10 inches loose measurement for the maximum lift thickness of the backfill. Decrease this lift
 thickness to obtain the specified density.
 The ME will determine the optimum moisture content as specified in AASHTO T 99, Method C. Ensure that
 the moisture content of the backfill is uniform throughout each layer and has a placement moisture content
 that is less than or equal to the optimum moisture content. Remove and rework backfill that has a placement
 moisture content in excess of the optimum moisture content until the moisture content is uniformly acceptable
 throughout the entire layer.
 Ensure that backfill placed within 1 foot of a drainage structure or utility does not have any particle greater
 than 3 inches in maximum dimension.
 
 2.
 
 Coarse Aggregate. Do not exceed 8 inch lift thickness of coarse aggregate. Place subsurface drainage
 geotextile at the interface of the coarse aggregate and regular roadway materials and embankments.
 At each reinforcement strip level, level and compact the coarse aggregate before placing the reinforcement.
 
 G.
 
 Compacting. Compact backfill material without damaging, disturbing, or misaligning the wall units before placing
 the next block level. Roughly level each course of backfill to an elevation approximately 2 inches above the level
 of the next course of units. Compact in a direction parallel to the wall. For MSE walls, do not use sheepsfoot or
 grid-type rollers for compacting backfill within the limits of the soil reinforcement. Compact for the specified
 material as follows:
 1.
 
 Soil Aggregate (I-15) or Soil Aggregate (I-9). With the exception of the 5-foot zone directly behind the
 units, compact I-15 soil aggregate or I-9 soil aggregate with large, smooth drum, vibratory rollers using the
 density control method as specified in 203.03.02.D.
 Within 5 feet of the wall, use small, single or double drum, hand operated, walk-behind vibratory rollers, or
 walk-behind vibrating plate compactors. Make at least 3 passes.
 
 2.
 
 Coarse Aggregate. To provide the proper density of the broken stone, compact by making at least 4 passes
 with a vibratory roller that has a total operating weight of 8 to 10 tons. Set the roller in the vibratory mode
 between 1.5 and 2.5 mph.
 Within 5 feet of the wall, use small, single or double drum, hand operated, walk-behind vibratory rollers, or
 walk-behind vibrating plate compactors. Make at least 3 passes.
 When there is evidence of wall displacement or disturbance, compact with a smooth drum static roller.
 
 At the end of each day’s operation, slope the last placed layer of backfill away from the wall units to direct runoff
 of rainwater away from the wall face. Do not allow surface runoff from adjacent areas to enter the work site.
 Ensure that the overall vertical tolerance of wall does not exceed 1/2 inch per 10 feet of wall height.
 H.
 
 HDPE Geomembrane Liner for MSE Walls. Deliver HDPE geomembrane liner systems and store to prevent
 damage to the material before installation.
 Before placing HDPE liner, ensure that the area to be lined is smooth and free of sharp objects or debris. Do not
 use equipment or tools that may damage the HDPE liner while handling, moving, or installing.

 B.
 
 Sawcut and Removal. When Type C repair is specified or full depth repair is required, provide temporary
 shielding, as specified in 201.03.03, to prevent debris from falling below the deck. Saw cut repair areas to a 3/4inch depth.
 Remove loose and disintegrated concrete from the areas to be repaired to a sound concrete surface. Ensure that the
 remaining concrete is not damaged during concrete removal. Ensure that the reinforcement steel is not damaged or
 debonded during concrete removal. The Contractor may remove concrete or prepare and shape repair areas with
 
 215
 
 power chipping or hand tools. Do not use pneumatic hammers heavier than 33 pounds. The Contractor may start
 such tools in the vertical position but must immediately tilt to a 45-degree operational angle. Do not operate
 pneumatic hammers and chipping tools at an angle exceeding 45 degrees relative to the surface of the deck slab.
 Do not use pneumatic hammers heavier than 20 pounds for chipping areas directly below the top longitudinal
 reinforcement steel or within 6 inches of the primary girder reinforcement steel, such as stirrups in prestressed
 concrete girder configurations.
 Remove concrete to the depth specified for the following type of repair.
 1.
 
 Type B Repair. For Type B repair, remove delaminated, deteriorated, and designated deck concrete to a
 minimum depth of 1 inch below the bottom of the top layer of existing reinforcement steel to a maximum
 depth of 50 percent of the thickness of the existing concrete deck. The RE may require the Contractor to
 remove sound concrete to achieve the limits of the designated repairs.
 
 2.
 
 Type C Repair. For Type C repair, remove delaminated, deteriorated, and designated deck concrete for the
 full depth of the existing deck. The RE may require the Contractor to remove sound concrete to achieve the
 limits of the designated repairs. Collect the concrete and reuse as specified in 202.03.07.A.
 
 C.
 
 Cleaning and Splicing Reinforcement Steel. Clean corroded, uncoated reinforcement steel by sandblasting,
 waterblasting, or wire brushing. For coated steel, clean areas where the coating is damaged by wire brushing and
 repair the coating according to AASHTO M 284. For reinforcement steel that has lost 25 percent or more of its
 original cross-sectional area, splice in or couple new epoxy-coated reinforcement steel of the same size. Lap the
 reinforcement steel at least 15 bar diameters from each end of the damaged area and wire tie together. If necessary,
 perform additional chipping of adjacent concrete to provide for this lap. Where reinforcement steel is broken or
 missing, lap new bars at least 30 bar diameters from each end of the break.
 
 D.
 
 Patching. The Contractor may use Class A concrete or Type IA or IB quick-setting patch material, whichever is
 specified. For Type C Repair, provide forms for placing the patch material.
 1.
 
 Class A Concrete. Perform patching within the limitations specified in 504.03.02.C. Place concrete as
 specified in 405.03.02.D.1.b; consolidate and strike-off as specified in 405.03.02.D.1.c; and texture with a
 broom. Cure the repair areas as specified in 504.03.02.F.
 Do not place traffic, equipment, or other loading on the patch material until the concrete has cured 72 hours
 and has attained a minimum strength of 4000 pounds per square inch as determined from 2 test cylinders cast
 during placement and field cured.
 
 2.
 
 Quick Setting Patch. For Type IA or IB quick-setting patch material, place according to the manufacturer’s
 recommendations. Wet cure the patched area using wet burlap, as specified in 504.03.02.F.2, immediately
 after placing and finishing. Keep the patched area covered for 3 hours.
 Do not open repair to traffic until compressive strength as measured by the average of 2 test cylinders is more
 than 2000 pounds per square inch. If the required compressive strength is not met by the time the roadway
 must be opened to traffic, open to traffic. Remove and replace the repair during the next available roadway
 closure.
 
 551.03.02 Scarification
 Before beginning concrete removal, perform a field survey for each stage of construction to establish existing grades and
 cross slopes and determine finished grades and cross slopes. Take elevations longitudinally every 10 feet and
 transversely at the gutterlines, breaklines, and the center of each lane and shoulder. The RE may direct additional
 elevation checks in areas with rapid changes in grade so that intermediate longitudinal checks can be made. Submit the
 field survey to the RE 5 days before scarifying.
 Scarify the surface and ensure that the existing transverse and longitudinal joints are not damaged. Remove concrete and
 other materials that result from scarifying by hand, mechanical sweeper, or vacuum, and reuse as specified in
 202.03.07.A. Do not use water or air to remove the scarified material.

 depth. Remove loose particles from the areas receiving mortar by flushing or scouring with compressed air jets
 
 C.
 
 Test Panels. Construct test panels using the equipment, materials, and mix proportions proposed for each type of
 repair on the Project. Construct test panels that are at least 30 × 30 × 3 inches for each mix, for each type of repair,
 and for each shooting position to be encountered on the job, including the overhead position. Construct test panels
 to the same thickness as the repair, but not less than 3 inches thick. Apply the mortar for the test panels, against
 similar support conditions to simulate actual field conditions for concrete repairs. The ME will mark the test panels
 at the time of application. Field cure panels in the same manner as the work for 7 days. Deliver the test panels to
 the ME after the field cure is complete.
 
 218
 
 The ME will take 3 cores from each test panel. If the average compressive strength at 28 days is less than 3500
 pounds per square inch, the test panel fails. Modify the mix proportions or the shooting procedure and construct a
 new test panel for approval of the repair.
 D.
 
 Applying Mortar. Protect pedestrian, vehicular, and other traffic upon, underneath, or adjacent to the structure,
 and all portions of the structure against damage or disfigurement by spatters and splashes. If RE determines that
 the Contractor’s method is deficient, cease applying mortar and submit working drawings for approval detailing a
 new method.

 silica chromate paint or both red lead and basic silica chromate paint as components.
 For contracts that involve lead paint abatement, ensure that the personnel that perform the lead paint abatement are
 trained and certified in the applicable workers’ programs that concern health and safety compliance and that
 concern environmental regulations regarding lead abatement. The Department of Health and Senior Services shall
 train personnel. The Department of Community Affairs, Division of Codes and Standards, shall certify personnel.
 Ensure that only trained and certified personnel perform lead abatement activities. Only use lead abatement
 practices as described in the Industrial Lead Paint Removal Handbook. The Department of Labor will monitor
 contracts for compliance with the training and certification requirements.
 
 B.
 
 Cleaning. Remove signs mounted on the fascia beams of the structures before cleaning. Mount vertical under
 clearance signs on the fascia beam or containment system until the cleaning is finished.
 Ensure that the containment enclosure extends from the bottom of the deck down to ground level or to a solid work
 platform. Frame and fasten materials for the enclosure to prevent billowing or opening from the weather. When
 using tarpaulins, ensure that all edges and seams have a flap that clamps over the connecting edges for the entire
 enclosure. Fasten these flaps along the tarpaulin edges to prevent dust from escaping.
 Do not begin cleaning or blasting until the pollution control system and all required permits for the handling,
 storage, and transportation of waste have been approved and the RE approves the containment enclosure.
 When organic zinc coating is specified, only blast-clean structural steel members.
 When spot blast cleaning is specified, before the cleaning operations, remove accumulated dirt and dust, and
 complete a thorough examination and survey of the existing surfaces to identify areas of paint failure and corrosion
 that will require blast cleaning outside the limits designated.
 Clean existing structural steel that has been previously painted and surfaces of other metal. Protect all components
 and materials that are not scheduled for blast cleaning during those operations.
 1.
 
 Hand or Power Tool Cleaning. Before hand or power tool cleaning, remove all visible oil, grease, and salts
 by solvent cleaning as specified in SSPC-SP 1. Roughen all existing paint left on the surface after hand or
 power tool cleaning before applying paint. Ensure that existing surfaces to be prepared by hand or power tool
 cleaning, or a combination of both, complies with the requirements of SSPC-SP 2 and SSPC-SP 3,
 respectively.
 
 2.
 
 Blast Cleaning. Before blast cleaning, scrape the tops of bottom flanges to remove accumulated dust, dirt,
 and debris. Remove all visible oil, grease, and salts by solvent cleaning according to SSPC-SP 1.
 Prepare existing surfaces by near-white blast cleaning according to SSPC-SP 10. Ensure that the blast
 cleaning produces the required anchor profile of 1.5 to 3.0 mils, in a dense, uniform pattern of depressions and
 ridges. Verify the profile depth by the Testex replica tape.
 Do not blast clean a surface area of steel greater than the surface area of steel that can be prime coated within
 24 hours.
 
 223
 
 Remove all fins, tears, slivers, and burred or sharp edges that are present on any steel member or that appear
 during the blasting operations by grinding. Reblast the ground area and ensure that the reblasted area meets
 the required anchor profile.
 Contain, capture, and collect blasting residues, spent blasting medium, rust particles, paint particles, and dust
 associated with the work.
 Collect blast medium and paint residue from steel surfaces with a commercial grade vacuum cleaner equipped
 with a brush-type cleaning tool or by double blowing with clean air. If the double blowing method is used,
 vacuum the top surfaces of all structural steel after the double blowing operations are completed. Keep the
 steel clean until the prime coat is applied.
 Protect freshly coated surfaces from subsequent blast cleaning operations. Thoroughly wire brush blast
 damaged primed surfaces. If visible rust occurs, reblast to the required condition. Vacuum and reprime the
 wire brushed or blast cleaned surfaces.
 During blast cleaning, if the containment enclosure is allowing waste to escape, stop work until the enclosure
 is repaired. Clean up any waste released from the enclosure immediately. If the wind velocity is high enough
 to cause the containment enclosure to billow, cease blast cleaning and lower the enclosure after cleaning up all
 the waste.
 C.
 
 Waste Disposal. Provide, install, and maintain any temporary loading and storage facilities on-site as required
 until completion of material handling activities.
 The RE will review the storage containers and storage location. Locate storage containers so as not to prevent a
 traffic or safety hazard. Locate storage containers in areas that are properly drained and where run-off water will
 not pond around or near the containers. Close storage containers and cover with tarpaulins at all times except
 during placement, sampling, and disposal of the waste.
 After removing and collecting the waste from surface preparation work, the RE will designate the rust, paint
 particles, and dust associated with the work as “Hazardous Waste,” with the corresponding USEPA hazardous
 waste code D008.
 Place expendable material and decontamination liquids generated from construction activities within the
 containment area, including respirator cartridges, protective clothing, boots, and gloves, in watertight containers.
 Separately store all personnel protection equipment, decontamination liquids that become contaminated due to
 contact with hazardous waste or materials containing hazardous substances, and other expendable wastes, and
 dispose in containers identified in the waste disposal plan. Ensure that these containers do not have indentations or
 shipping damage that would allow leakage of the contained material.
 Store waste in the on-site loading facility and storage area until transportation vehicles arrive for off-site disposal.
 Dispose of all hazardous waste within 75 days or before Substantial Completion, whichever comes first.
 Continuously monitor the quantity of the waste captured, contained, collected, stored, and disposed of. Document
 the handling, sampling, manifesting, transporting, and disposal of hazardous waste. Maintain a complete and
 accurate record, located with the Project Limits, of all blasting medium purchased, delivered, and used during the
 execution of the Work. To allow for verification inspections, submit, to the RE on a weekly basis, both the record
 of the blasting medium delivered and used, and the waste handling, sampling, manifesting, transporting, and
 disposal documentation.
 Move the contained waste materials to the storage area or dispose of at regular intervals (once each working day,
 minimum) during the work, according to the waste disposal plan, field conditions, and the direction of the RE.
 Remove errant waste from the bridge deck, structural steel, piers, abutments, and other areas, at least once a day or
 more frequently if required or directed. Clean any spillage of waste that may occur during disposal operations,
 including during the loading, transport, and unloading of materials, according to NJDEP regulations N.J.S.A.
 58:10-23.11, et seq.
 Only use the transporters identified in the waste disposal plan. Do not substitute or use additional transporters
 without approval from the RE. Do not combine contaminated material from other projects with material from this
 Project. Obtain and submit a copy of the test results of the waste from the TSD facility to the RE.
 Comply with the manifesting requirements specified in 202.03.09.
 
 224
 
 Ensure that the waste transporter’s vehicles and operating practices prevent spillage or leakage of hazardous or
 contaminated material while transporting to the final disposal site.
 D.
 
 Conditions for Painting. Provide a suitable facility for the storage of paint that will comply with the latest OSHA
 regulations. Store and protect paint and thinners from the weather in enclosed structures at 40 to 110 °F. Equip the
 enclosure with a recording thermometer.
 Comply with the conditions for painting according to SSPC-PA 1.
 Do not apply epoxy coating or organic zinc coating when the temperature is below 50 °F or when the relative
 humidity is above 90 percent. Do not apply the urethane coating when the temperature is below 40 °F or when the
 relative humidity is above 90 percent. Do not apply any coatings when the wind velocity exceeds 20 miles per
 hour, when the air is misty, or when, in the opinion of the RE, conditions are unsatisfactory for the work. Also, do
 not paint on damp or frosted surfaces or when the metal is hot enough to cause the paint to blister, produce a porous
 paint film, or cause the vehicle (binder) to separate from the pigment.
 Do not paint when the steel surface temperature is lower than 5 °F above the dew point. The RE will determine the
 dew point using a psychrometer and appropriate tables. The Contractor may presume the dew point requirement to
 be satisfied if a thin, clearly defined film of water, applied to the cleaned vertical surface with a damp cloth,
 evaporates within 15 minutes, as determined by the RE.
 Do not apply coatings when the temperature of the air, paint, or metal, or the relative humidity is expected to be
 outside of specified limits before the paint is fully cured.
 
 E.
 
 Paint Application.
 1.
 
 Mixing Paint. Mix coatings according to SSPC-PA 1 and the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 
 2.
 
 Thinning Paint. If it is necessary to thin the coating for proper application, thin the paint according to the
 manufacturer’s recommendations.
 In cool weather, the Contractor may warm the paint to reduce the viscosity. The Contractor may heat the
 paint by placing the paint containers in water or on steam radiators.
 
 3.
 
 Preparing the Surface. When surfaces requiring repainting are in contact with concrete, use a nonaluminum epoxy mastic primer approved by the Department’s Bureau of Materials.
 When full depth deck repair or replacement is specified, apply a prime coat to the top surfaces of top flanges
 of existing steel girders excluding the shear connectors.
 Do not paint aluminum alloy metal work, copper, SIP forms for concrete decks, and bridge deck grid flooring.
 Remove zinc salts, oil, dust, dirt, and other contaminants before applying each coat of paint and any repair
 coats in the field. Clean the primed surfaces with a high pressure water washing (800 pounds per square inch
 minimum).
 When applying paint to a galvanized surface, use epoxy intermediate and urethane finish coats only. When
 using the epoxy mastic coating system, apply the full coating system.
 
 4.
 
 Applying Paint. Apply paint only on clean dry surfaces according to SSPC-PA 1. Apply paint using
 brushes, rollers, spray equipment, or any combination of equipment that will attain satisfactory results and the
 film thickness specified. Apply paint uniformly and smoothly so that every part of the surface will be covered
 with the minimum specified thickness. On surfaces that are inaccessible for painting by regular means, apply
 paint by sheepskin daubers or spray, or by other means if necessary, to ensure coverage of the proper
 thickness of paint.
 Whenever painting operations are interrupted, expel the remaining paint in the fluid hose from the hose.
 Thoroughly clean spray equipment at the end of each workday with an approved solvent. Properly dispose of
 the left over solvent and paint waste material.
 If the paint coating is too thin or if areas of the surface are not completely coated, repaint these areas of the
 work. Where excessive coating thickness produces surface defects such as “mud-cracking,” remove coating
 back to soundly bonded coating, and recoat the area to the required thickness. In areas of deficient primer
 thickness, recoat according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 
 225
 
 5.
 
 Coating Thickness. The RE will use a magnetic dry film thickness gauge to determine the dry film thickness
 for each coat. Calibrate the gauge and use according to SSPC-PA 2. Use a Tooke film thickness gauge
 according to ASTM D 4138 to verify the coating thickness when requested by the RE. If the Tooke gauge
 shows that the prime coat is less than the specified minimum thickness, the RE will reject the entire coating
 system.
 a.
 
 Epoxy Mastic Coating System. Apply at least 1 coat of each of the following in the field: spot prime
 (over blast cleaned or exposed surfaces), prime, and finish coats. Place a full prime coat over the entire
 surface, including areas that have been spot primed.
 Ensure that the dry film thickness of the paint is at least 5 mils for the spot prime coat, at least 3 mils for
 the prime coat, and at least 2 mils for the finish coat.
 
 b.
 
 Organic Zinc Coating System. Apply at least 1 of each of the following coats in the field: prime,
 intermediate, and finish coats.
 Ensure that the dry film thickness of the paint is at least 5 mils for the prime coat, at least 3.5 mils for the
 intermediate coat, and at least 2 mils for the finish coat.
 
 F.
 
 6.
 
 Prime or Spot Prime Coat. Tint the primer to contrast the base metal. Apply the prime or spot prime coat
 immediately after obtaining RE approval of the surface preparation. Apply the prime or spot prime coat the
 same day the metal is cleaned, but not until the cleaning operation is far enough ahead to eliminate the danger
 of dirt or other material from the cleaning operations from falling or blowing onto the fresh paint. Prime or
 spot prime all blast cleaned surfaces the same day before any contamination, formation of rust, or any other
 deterioration of the prepared surface.
 
 7.
 
 Curing. Comply with the manufacturer recommended curing time between coats. If the manufacturer’s
 recommended curing time is exceeded, follow the manufacturer’s recommendation to prepare the surface for
 succeeding coats.
 
 8.
 
 Striping. Before applying the full prime coat, apply a prime coating (striping) to all edges of plates and rolled
 shapes, corners, crevices, welds, and exposed parts of bolts. Do not apply the full prime coat until the striping
 has set to touch.
 
 9
 
 Cleanup. Replace signs that were removed during cleaning and painting to their original position. Remove
 paint dropped on concrete surfaces and all debris from the cleaning operations from the superstructure and the
 substructure. Remove over-sprays on adjacent portions of the structures. Remove paint containers and refuse
 from the Project Limits.
 
 Stenciling. Stencil the following information on the outside web of both fascia beams, on both ends of the
 structure, and as specified below:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 The 7-digit structure number.
 The month and year of completion.
 The paint system code number.
 
 Stencil uniform 4-inch high, C-series letters or numerals with the same type of paint except use a color that
 contrasts the structure. Locate markings at least 2 inches above the lower flange and not more than 3 feet from the
 abutment. In the case of a bascule bridge, stencil information 3 feet from the heel of the bascule span.
 In addition, thoroughly clean all memorial or commemorative metal plaques that are affixed to the structure or
 appurtenance. Submit the method of cleaning along with a sample of the materials intended for use to the RE for
 approval. Clean the plaques to the satisfaction of the RE according to the approved method, and ensure the
 removal of accumulated dirt, extraneous markings, and corrosion without marring, eroding, or staining the plaques
 in any way.
 G.
 
 Unsatisfactory Paint Performance and Removal. The Department will consider the paint performance
 unsatisfactory if rusting occurs, if the paint coat lifts, blisters, wrinkles, has excessive runs or sags, or shows
 evidence of application under unfavorable conditions, if the workmanship is poor, if impure or unauthorized paint
 has been used, or for other such reasons determined by the RE.
 Remove any unsatisfactory paint, and reclean and repaint the metal.
 
 226
 
 554.03.03 Testing, If and Where Directed
 The RE may direct the Contractor to conduct or to obtain the services of others to conduct air quality, water quality, or
 such other testing that will determine the quantity of any materials that may be escaping from the containment plan
 employed on the Project. If it is determined that pollution of the environment adjacent to the site has occurred due to the
 Contractor’s operations, stop cleaning and painting and immediately submit a plan to the RE for approval detailing the
 corrective actions necessary to restore the area. Correct the containment measures. Do not continue cleaning or painting
 until the RE directs the work to begin.
 The Department may conduct additional testing using the Department Laboratory.

 601.03 CONSTRUCTION
 601.03.01 Installing Pipe
 A.
 
 Storing and Handling. Handle and store pipe to prevent damage such as cracking, denting and breaking. Lift pipe
 off of the delivery vehicle to avoid damage while unloading. Do not dump or drag pipe off the delivery vehicle.
 Store pipe in an area where it will not be damaged during construction operations. Use blocks or straps when
 stacking pipe. Alternate the bells and spigots to reduce the load on the bells. The RE will reject pipe that is
 damaged, bowed, or considered unacceptable for other reasons.
 
 B.
 
 Excavating. Maintain the existing drainage system during construction until the new drainage facilities are
 completed and placed into service.
 Excavate the same distance on each side of the centerline of the pipe to ensure that the pipe is in the center of the
 trench. Ensure that the trench is at least 18 inches wider than the outside diameter of the pipe. Provide vertical
 sides for excavations within the traveled way, shoulder, sidewalk areas, and where existing facilities require
 protection.
 Except where necessary to maintain flow, do not excavate trenches or place drains in embankment until the
 embankment has been constructed to an elevation of at least 3 feet above the top of the pipe or to the top of the
 embankment, whichever is lower. Do not excavate trenches more than 300 feet in advance of installing the pipe
 unless approved by the RE.
 Obtain RE approval before finishing excavation. If the RE determines that the bottom of the trench is unstable,
 undercut as directed by the RE and backfill with Class B bedding.
 
 228
 
 If the material at the bottom of the trench is rock or other hard material, remove at least 6 inches of the material for
 RCP or at least 12 inches of the material below the bottom of the pipe for corrugated metal, steel, aluminum alloy
 pipe, or HDPE. Backfill the undercut with Class C bedding.
 For trenches in the traveled way, shoulder, and within 30 feet of the outside edge of the shoulder, backfill and
 restore the pavement structure to match the surrounding pavement before opening to traffic. The Contractor may
 submit working drawings for approval for temporary protection instead of backfilling trenches.
 Provide and maintain trench crossings where necessary. For trenches not in the traveled way and shoulder, do not
 leave trenches open overnight unless protected with fence. Maintain trenches according to 29 CFR 1926.
 C.
 
 Bedding. Do not place bedding material until the RE approves the depth of excavation and the material at the
 bottom of the excavation. If bedding is not shown, place pipe directly on the material at the bottom of the trench.
 For Class A bedding, construct a concrete cradle. Place concrete according to the limitations specified in
 504.03.02.C. Place concrete across the area to minimize rehandling. Ensure that concrete is not discharged into
 windrows or piles. Consolidate the concrete by hand spading or using internal mechanical vibrators. Protect
 concrete as specified in 504.03.02.I.
 For Class B, Class C, and Class D bedding, place the bedding and provide recesses for pipe bells deep enough to
 ensure that the bell will not rest on the bottom of the recess. Ensure that the recess does not exceed 2 inches from
 the edge of the bell along the length of the pipe. Compact using the directed method as specified in 203.03.02.C.
 
 D.
 
 Installing Pipe Before the installation of HDPE pipe and as directed by the RE, provide a technical representative
 from the pipe manufacturer on the work site for the first day of pipe installation to ensure proper installation
 procedures.
 When installing pipe, use a laser system to control the alignment and grade of the pipe.
 Use end sections of the same material as the adjoining pipe or pipe arch, except use concrete end sections for
 HDPE pipe.
 Begin installing pipe at the lowest elevation of the pipeline. Ensure that the pipe is in firm contact with the bottom
 of the excavation or bedding throughout its full length. Place bell ends of pipe facing towards the highest elevation.
 When using perforated pipe, ensure that the perforations are at the bottom.
 When installing pipe through concrete or masonry walls, provide a sufficient length of pipe outside of the wall to
 allow for connections, and cut the pipe flush with the inside face of the wall. Seal the connection using mortar.
 When pipe enters below the invert of existing structures, cut and shape the existing invert to form a new channel.
 When constructing storm drains in stages, cover the end of the pipe after each stage to prevent material from
 entering the pipe. Do not cover the pipe if it is required to keep the pipe open for temporary drainage.
 When using pipe for a stream diversion, install pipe outside of the existing stream bed while maintaining flow in
 the existing stream. When installing pipe within an existing stream channel, construct a temporary stream diversion
 while maintaining flow in the existing stream channel. Once the temporary channel is completed, divert the stream
 flow into the temporary channel while constructing the pipe system within the existing stream bed. When the pipe
 is completed, divert the stream flow into the pipe.
 When using heavy construction equipment (100 kips axle load) over, or within 10 feet of HDPE pipe or corrugated
 aluminum alloy pipe, place the manufacturer recommended temporary compacted cover over the top of the pipe.
 Ensure that the temporary cover is free from stones larger than 1 inch.
 
 E.
 
 Joining Pipe. Join rigid pipe using mortar or gaskets to form a watertight seal. With RE approval, the Contractor
 may use other types of joints that are recommended by the pipe manufacturer. Join corrugated metal pipe with
 coupling bands.
 For mortar joints, clean the pipe ends and wet with water before placing stiff mortar. Place mortar in the lower half
 of the bell of the placed pipe section, and then place mortar on the upper half of the spigot of the section to be
 installed. Join the 2 pipe sections with their inner surfaces flush. Seal the exterior of the joint with mortar. Fill the
 lifting holes with mortar.
 For circular pipe greater than 36 inches in diameter and elliptical pipe greater than 38 × 60 inches, ensure that the
 inside of the joint is finished smooth. For circular pipe smaller than 36 inches in diameter and elliptical pipe
 229
 
 greater than 38 × 60 inches, remove protruding mortar from the joint. If the completed mortar joints are not
 immediately backfilled with earth, protect the mortar joints against rapid drying. When the ambient temperature is
 below 40 °F, ensure that the mortar temperature is between 50 and 100 °F. Protect the mortar and maintain its
 temperature above 32 °F for 24 hours.
 For gasket joints, install gaskets according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Do not use split couplings to join field-cut HDPE pipe unless approved by the RE. Ensure that joints are bell and
 spigot type, or bell and spigot type with a gasket, according to ASTM F 477, to provide a silt-tight seal. Construct
 pipe connections according to the manufacturer’s recommendations for assembly of joint components, lubrications,
 and making of joints. Ensure that the pipe fittings are free of inclusions and visible defects. Cut the ends of the
 pipe squarely so as not to adversely affect joining.
 F.
 
 Backfilling. When using corrugated aluminum and HDPE pipe, backfill from the bottom of the trench to 2 feet
 above the top of the pipe with Class C bedding. When using pipe other than corrugated aluminum or HDPE,
 backfill from the bottom of the trench to 2 feet above the top of the pipe with suitable excavated material free from
 stones and rock larger than 2 inches in any dimension. For distances 2 feet above the top of the pipe, backfill using
 suitable excavated material.
 Place backfill material symmetrically on each side of the pipe in lifts not exceeding 6 inches thick, loose
 measurement. Compact as follows:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 If the backfill material is predominantly granular, use vibratory plate compactors.
 If the backfill material is not predominantly granular, use vibratory rammer compactors.
 For heights more than 2 feet above the pipe, the Contractor may use a roller.
 
 The RE may direct compaction using the density control method as specified in 203.03.02.D.
 Remove shoring, bracing, and sheeting as the backfilling proceeds.
 The Contractor may use CLSM as alternate backfill material when backfilling trenches for drainage pipe. Do not
 use CLSM to replace pavement, base courses, or drainage layers that form the pavement structure. The RE will not
 allow combining other backfill materials in the same trench as CLSM. Place CLSM according to the limitations
 specified in 504.03.02.C. Place CLSM across the area to minimize rehandling. Protect CLSM as specified in
 504.03.02.I.
 601.03.02 Installing Pipe Using Alternate Methods
 When installing pipe using methods other than as specified in 601.03.01, at least 30 days before installation, submit
 working drawings for approval that include the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 6.
 7.
 8.
 9.
 
 Materials, including size and type of pipe.
 Method of maintaining continuous operation of traffic on the Project.
 Details for installing and removing sheeting, bracing, and shoring.
 Method of ensuring horizontal and vertical alignment of the pipe.
 Complete installation procedure.
 Method of protecting pipe during installation.
 Method of excavating and removing material during installation.
 Method of sealing and finishing pipe joints.
 Alternate method of pipe installation if original method becomes impossible due to obstructions.
 
 601.03.03 Underdrains and Subbase Outlet Drains
 A.
 
 Excavating. Maintain the existing drainage system during construction until the new drainage facilities are
 completed and placed into service.
 Excavate the same distance on each side of the centerline of the pipe to ensure that the pipe is in the center of the
 trench. Do not excavate trenches more than 300 feet in advance of installation unless approved by the RE.
 Obtain RE approval before finishing excavation. If the RE determines that the bottom of the trench is unstable,
 undercut as directed by the RE and backfill with Class B bedding.
 
 230
 
 If the material at the bottom of the trench is rock or other hard material, remove at least 6 inches of the material for
 RCP or at least 12 inches of the material below the bottom of the pipe for corrugated metal, steel, aluminum alloy
 pipe, or HDPE. Backfill the undercut with Class C bedding.
 For trenches in the traveled way, shoulder, and within 30 feet of the outside edge of the shoulder, backfill and
 restore the pavement structure to match the surrounding pavement before opening to traffic. The Contractor may
 submit working drawings for approval for temporary protection instead of backfilling trenches.
 Provide and maintain trench crossings where necessary. For trenches not in the traveled way and shoulder, do not
 leave trenches open overnight unless protected with fence. Maintain trenches according to 29 CFR 1926.
 B.
 
 Installing. Begin constructing at the lowest elevation of the drain. Ensure that the perforations are at the bottom.
 Join underdrains according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Seal the dead ends of pipe underdrains with a
 pipe cap.
 
 C.
 
 Backfilling. Backfill, using coarse aggregate, around the underdrains and subbase outlet drains and on top of stone
 backfill in rock areas. Compact the coarse aggregate with a vibratory pad compactor.
 
 601.03.04 Video Inspection of Pipe
 Perform video inspection of interior pipelines no sooner than 30 days after completing the pipe installation. Submit to
 the RE for approval the name and qualifications of the person performing the inspection.
 Perform the video inspection in dry pipe conditions to ensure viewing of the entire pipe circumference. Ensure that a
 visual numerical registration of the distance the video camera is traveling from the starting point to the ending point
 within the pipe drainage structure is recorded on the footage tape at all times. Also, ensure that the name of the pipe run
 and the name of the structure is recorded on the footage tape at all times. Stop the video camera at all joints, lateral
 connections, breaks, and irregularities to ensure full view at these locations. Ensure that the videotape provides clear,
 sharply focused pictures. The Department will not accept blurred or out of focus footage. Submit a color VHS
 videotape, or equivalent digital media, of the inspection to the RE to become the property of the Department. Number
 the tapes sequentially and provide a corresponding index for all tapes, listing the location, date, size and type of pipe,
 cross or longitudinal drains, berm, slope, and similar identifying information.
 If the pipe is found to be defective because of poor joints, deformation, breaks, poor connections, or irregularities,
 correct the defective pipe as directed by the RE. If the pipe cannot be corrected, remove and replace the defective pipe.
 601.03.05 Deflection Inspection of HDPE Pipe
 Test approximately 25 percent of the length of HDPE pipe for deflection no sooner than 30 days after installation. If
 testing produces a failure rate of 5 percent, increase the rate of testing to 100 percent. Perform the deflection testing
 using either electronic deflectometers, calibrated television or video cameras, properly sized “go, no-go” mandrel, direct
 measurement extension rulers and tape measures in pipe that allow safe entry, or another acceptable device. If mandrel
 testing is chosen, pull the mandrel through the pipe by hand.
 Where deflection is more than 5 percent of the base inside diameter, submit a remediation plan to the RE for approval.
 601.03.06 Cleaning Existing Pipe
 At least 5 days before beginning the work, submit a plan to the RE detailing the proposed method and equipment to be
 used. Remove and collect silt debris and material of any kind and prevent material from being discharged into the
 drainage system. Dispose of materials removed from existing pipe as specified in 202.03.08.

 607.03 CONSTRUCTION
 607.03.01 Concrete Barrier Curb
 A.
 
 Placing Footing. Excavate as specified in 202.03.03. Shape and compact the underlying material to produce a
 firm, even surface. Obtain RE approval before finishing excavation. If the RE determines that the bottom of the
 excavation is unstable, undercut, backfill, and compact as directed by the RE.
 Place footing concrete according to the limitations specified in 504.03.02.C. Consolidate the concrete by hand
 spading or using internal mechanical vibrators. Insert the reinforcement steel into the concrete before initial set.
 Ensure that it remains perpendicular to the footing until the barrier curb is constructed. Protect concrete as
 specified in 504.03.02.I.
 
 B.
 
 Constructing Forms. Each time before using, ensure that the forms are thoroughly cleaned and treated with a
 material that will prevent adherence of the concrete to the forms without discoloring the concrete. Construct
 concrete barrier curb in sections that correspond to the transverse joints in the existing or proposed pavement and at
 most 20 feet in length. Reduce this length where necessary for closures, but do not construct closure sections that
 are less than 6 feet. Where changes in the size or shape are necessary for variable height barrier curb, ensure that
 the transition between the sections is gradual.
 
 242
 
 C.
 
 Installing Joints. Place 1/2-inch preformed joint filler at the transverse joints and ensure that filler is flush with the
 top and face of the curb. Install 1/2-inch preformed joint filler between the curb and concrete pavement, and seal
 the joint with hot-poured joint sealer.
 
 D.
 
 Placing Concrete. Obtain RE approval of forms and joint placement before placing concrete. Place concrete
 according to the limitations specified in 504.03.02.C. To place concrete between November 15 to March 1, submit
 to RE for approval a plan detailing the method of protecting the concrete from salt for at least 30 days after placing.
 Do not begin placing concrete until this plan is approved.
 Place concrete across the formed area to minimize rehandling. Continuously place concrete between transverse
 joints without the use of intermediate bulkheads. To prevent bowing or misalignment of the transverse joints, place
 concrete simultaneously on both sides of transverse joints without disturbing the joints.
 Consolidate the concrete using internal mechanical vibrators. When required, supplement vibrating by hand
 spading to ensure proper and adequate consolidation. Provide at least an additional standby vibrating unit for
 individual concrete placements in excess of 10 cubic yards.
 Use vibrators to work the concrete around the reinforcement steel and embedded fixtures and into corners and
 angles of the forms. Ensure proper vibration of the concrete to avoid honeycombing and voids. Do not use
 vibrators to move or spread concrete into position. Do not over vibrate concrete.
 Place reinforcement steel and sleeves for sign posts while placing concrete, and ensure that they remain in position
 until the concrete is set.
 If a section is not completed from transverse joint to transverse joint, remove the incomplete section and replace.
 Terminate each day’s placement at a transverse joint. Protect concrete as specified in 504.03.02.I.
 Fill sleeves for sign or delineator posts installed in barrier curb with sand, and seal the sleeves with hot-poured joint
 sealer immediately after installation. Reseal the sleeves if and when posts are installed.
 
 E.
 
 Finishing Concrete. Finish the top of the curb with a wood float and round the top edges. Remove the forms as
 soon as the concrete holds its shape, and immediately finish joint edges using an edging tool with a radius of
 1/4 inch. Remove lips of mortar and irregularities caused by form joints. Using mortar from the barrier concrete
 placement, patch holes, depressions, voids, and honeycombs to produce a smooth, dense, uniform surface of
 concrete. Finish the surface of the barrier curb with a steel float and texture with a broom.
 If a rigid type of construction is to be made against any exposed surface, leave the exposed surface smooth and
 uniform to allow free movement of the curb.
 
 F.
 
 Protecting and Curing Concrete. Immediately after finishing the concrete, apply curing compound as specified
 in 504.03.02.F.1.
 
 G.
 
 Installing Flexible Delineators. For delineators located on the right side when facing in the direction of traffic,
 ensure that the retroreflective sheeting is white. For delineators located on the left side when facing in the direction
 of traffic, ensure that the retroreflective sheeting is yellow.
 Attach flexible delineators, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, 3 inches from the top of the barrier
 curb. Mount the first flexible delineator at the beginning of the concrete barrier curb section. Mount subsequent
 delineators every 80 feet. Position each delineator so that the plane face of the center of the reflective area is at an
 angle of 0 degrees with a line that is perpendicular to the direction of traffic. If the distance between the end of the
 concrete barrier curb and the adjacent delineator is greater than 40 feet, install a delineator on both sides of the
 barrier curb opening.
 
 607.03.02 Concrete Vertical Curb and Concrete Sloping Curb
 A.
 
 Underlayer Preparation. Excavate as specified in 202.03.03. Shape and compact the underlying material to

 609.03 CONSTRUCTION
 609.03.01 Beam Guide Rail
 Install beam guide rail, single or dual-faced, so that no unprotected end is exposed to approaching traffic. Within the
 same working day, replace all existing beam guide rail or cable guide rail that is removed. Where possible, install new
 beam guide rail exposed to approaching traffic before the removal of the existing system.
 Before driving or mounting the posts, determine the location of utilities that may conflict with the posts. The Contractor
 may adjust post spacing by 6 inches, as approved, to eliminate such conflicts. After completing the wiring for each
 electrical system and before making connections, perform the following tests on each circuit using suitable equipment in
 the presence of the RE:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 Tests for continuity.
 Tests for ground.
 Tests for insulation resistance between circuit wires and from circuit wires to ground. Verify that the
 insulation resistance is at least 150 megaohms between conductors, or between conductor and ground for
 circuits with a total single conductor length of 1500 feet or more, and at least 175 megaohms for circuits with
 a total single conductor length of less than 1500 feet.
 
 The RE may require additional tests if it is suspected that conduit have been damaged. Locate and repair damage to the
 electrical conduit due to construction operations.
 Drive beam guide rail posts to the required position. Ensure that posts are driven plumb, properly spaced, and to the line
 and grade shown.
 Install the required bridge attachment type as shown on the Plans. Mount bridge beam guide posts as shown on the
 Plans.
 Attach the beam guide rail element to the spacer at every post. Align the top edge of the beam guide rail element in a
 straight line or smooth curve, parallel to, or concentric with, the traveled way. Where a vertical transition is required,
 ensure that the top edge of the beam guide rail element forms the chords of a smooth vertical curve. If adjustments to the
 
 247
 
 rail element are necessary, obtain RE approval before punching, drilling, or reaming of the rail element. Do not cut or
 weld the rail element.
 Install white delineators on the right side of the direction of traffic. Install yellow delineators on the left side of the
 direction of traffic. Mount flexible delineators on the spacer of beam guide rail using either a “U” channel base on the Ibeam spacer or a flat base attached to a wood, polymer, or other solid top spacer. Attach the base to the spacer using an
 adhesive recommended by the manufacturer of the base and panel.
 Mount the first delineator on the beam guide rail end treatment so that the plane face of the center of the reflective area is
 at an angle of 0 degrees with a line that is perpendicular to the direction of traffic. Mount subsequent delineators every
 81.25 feet (13 sections of guide rail) along tangent mainline roadway, or every 43.75 feet (7 sections of guide rail) along
 curved mainline roadway with a radius of less than 1910 feet. If a parabolic flare in the beam guide rail exists, place the
 second delineator at the end of the flared section with subsequent delineators spaced as stated above. If the distance
 between the last delineator and the end of the beam guide rail is greater than 40 feet on tangent mainline roadways, or
 20 feet on curved mainline roadways, mount a delineator on the last post or end treatment.
 Repair damage to the galvanized coating according to ASTM A 780.
 609.03.02 Rub Rail
 When rub rail is required, bolt rub rail consisting of a steel channel or a bent plate to the beam guide rail posts.
 609.03.03 Terminals and Anchorages
 At least 10 days before beginning the work, submit the manufacturer’s recommendations the RE. Install terminals and
 anchorages according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Excavate for post holes and concrete anchorages as specified in 202.03.03. Backfill and compact using the directed
 method as specified in 203.03.02.C.
 609.03.04 Beam Guide Rail Blockouts
 Where required, attach blockout on existing beam guide rail between the steel posts and rail elements.
 Where beam guide rail is attached to a structure, attach the blockout to the structure. Reset beam guide rail, as specified
 in 609.03.05, to provide a smooth transition to the existing structure.
 609.03.05 Reset Beam Guide Rail
 When the RE determines that the beam guide rail is suitable for resetting, dismantle, store, and protect the components
 until resetting. To ensure that the beam guide rail meets the current standards, replace existing components, replace
 damaged components, and provide necessary new components. Dispose of components not designated for resetting the
 beam guide rail as specified in 201.03.09.
 When storage is required, remove the bolts, cables, and other hardware from beam guide rail element, posts, and other
 members. Sort the components and store until resetting. Stack rail elements and ensure that cables are free of kinks.
 Replace beam guide rail components that are damaged, lost, or missing in storage.
 Reset the existing beam guide rail, as specified in 609.03.01, using the salvaged components. Use all the salvaged
 components before providing new components for resetting.
 Where feasible, use existing rail elements in guide rail sections or portions thereof that are reset with existing posts, and
 use new rail elements in guide rail sections or in portions thereof where new guide rail posts are used. When it is
 necessary to use existing and new rail elements in the same guide rail section, install a continuous length of each.
 609.03.06 Removal of Beam Guide Rail
 After removing beam guide rail, backfill the post holes and compact the area to the elevation of the adjacent surface.
 Dispose of beam guide rail as specified in 201.03.09.

 Surface Preparation. Immediately before striping the pavement surface, clean the surface of dirt, oil, grease, and
 foreign material, including curing compound on new concrete. Clean the surface 2 inches beyond the perimeter of
 the stripes to be placed.
 
 C.
 
 Striping Test Strip. Before beginning long-life traffic striping operations, construct 1 or more striping test strips
 as specified in 610.03.01.D. For each striping test strip, apply striping to approximately 500 linear feet of
 pavement with the same striping procedure that will be used for the Project. Construct a test strip for each
 applicator unit and long-life material used. Construct additional test strips when major equipment repairs or
 adjustments are made or when the traffic stripes are determined to be defective. When the test strip is in
 compliance, as determined by the RE, proceed with striping operations. Each test strip may remain in place and
 become part of the finished stripes subject to the requirements of 610.03.01.E.
 
 D.
 
 Applying Striping. Mix epoxy resin with an automatic proportioning and mixing machine, and hot-spray the
 compound at a temperature of between 100 and 130 °F onto dry surfaces. Apply the compound with a wet film
 thickness of 20 ± 1 mil. Apply the material during dry weather conditions when the ambient temperature is a
 minimum of 45 °F and the surface temperature is a minimum of 50 °F. Adjust operations as required for the
 prevailing ambient and surface conditions to achieve a no-track drying time of 30 minutes or less.
 Immediately after, or in conjunction with, the compound application, uniformly apply 12 pounds of large glass
 beads per gallon of epoxy resin to the compound. After applying the large glass beads, uniformly apply 12 pounds
 of small glass beads per gallon of epoxy resin to the compound.
 Remove all compound that has been tracked or spilled outside of the intended placement areas.
 
 250
 
 E.
 
 Defective Stripes. Replace long-life traffic stripes that are determined by the RE before Acceptance to be
 defective or that are damaged due to sawcutting or sealing of joints in the HMA overlay. Remove defective stripes
 as specified in 610.03.08.
 Replace the entire 10-foot skip line if the RE determines the line to have a deficiency.
 If the RE determines, based upon calculated and measured yields, that the striping has a wet film thickness of less
 than 19 mils, restripe the entire length with 20 mils of new compound.
 Replace the entire length of striping where improper curing or discoloration has occurred. Discoloration is
 localized areas or patches of brown or grayish colored compound. Where improper curing or discoloration occurs
 intermittently in intervals of 100 feet or less throughout the striping length, replace the entire length of striping
 from the beginning of the first occurrence until the end of the last occurrence, plus 5 feet on each end.
 Replace the entire length of striping that has failed to bond to the pavement, or has chipped or cracked. Where
 more than 25 spots of chipping, cracking, or poor bonding have occurred within 1000 linear feet of striping, replace
 the entire 1000 foot length of striping.
 Replace the entire area of striping where the glass bead coverage or retention is deficient, based on yield
 measurements made during application and on visual comparisons of the production traffic stripes with those of the
 test strips.
 Replace the entire 1-mile length of striping where the initial retroreflectance values for 2 of 4 readings for that 1
 mile length are less than 375 millicandelas per square meter per lux for white or 250 millicandelas per square meter
 per lux for yellow, as measured with a LTL-2000 Retroreflectometer.
 
 F.
 
 Opening to Traffic. Complete each application of all types of traffic stripes and allow to thoroughly dry before
 opening to traffic. At a minimum, delineate center lines on undivided roadways and broken lines between lanes
 before the traveled way is opened. The RE will determine when the traveled way can be opened to traffic.
 
 610.03.02 Thermoplastic Traffic Markings
 A.
 
 Marking Plan. At least 20 days before beginning the work, submit to the RE for approval a marking plan that
 includes:

 temperatures.
 
 B.
 
 Surface Preparation. Immediately before marking the pavement surface, clean the surface of dirt, oil, grease, and
 foreign material, including curing compound on new concrete. Clean the surface 2 inches beyond the perimeter of
 the marking to be placed.
 
 C.
 
 Applying Long-Life Traffic Markings. Place preformed thermoplastic or hot extruded thermoplastic traffic
 markings on thoroughly dry surfaces and during dry weather conditions. Apply using equipment and procedures
 that produce markings of the specified color, width, and thickness with well-defined edges, uniform
 retroreflectivity, and proper bonding to the pavement. Apply the thermoplastic material as follows:
 1.
 
 Extruded Thermoplastic. Uniformly heat the thermoplastic material. When the ambient and surface
 temperatures are at least 50° F, apply the melted material at a temperature of between 400 and 425 °F.
 Extrude the thermoplastic traffic markings on the HMA or concrete pavement ensuring a thickness of
 90 ± 1 mils.
 Immediately after, or in conjunction with, the thermoplastic extrusion, uniformly apply glass beads to the wet
 material at a minimum rate of 10 pounds per 100 square feet of markings. Apply glass beads by mechanical
 means only.
 
 2.
 
 Preformed Thermoplastic. Melt the preformed thermoplastic tape to bond the traffic markings permanently
 in position according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Meet the minimum initial retroreflectance value, as specified in 610.03.01.D for thermoplastic tape, by
 applying additional glass beads to the hot-wet material in a uniform pattern as necessary.
 
 251
 
 D.
 
 Defective Markings. Replace long-life traffic markings that are determined by the RE before Acceptance to be
 defective or that are damaged due to sawcutting or sealing of joints in the HMA overlay. Remove defective
 markings as specified in 610.03.08.
 Replace the entire area of traffic markings determined to be less than the required thickness, to have incorrect color
 or width, to have failed to bond to the pavement, or to have chipped or cracked. The minimum replacement area is
 an individual word or symbol, or entire length of longitudinal line from where the deficiency first occurs to where it
 no longer exists.
 Replace the entire area of marking where the initial retroreflectance value is less than 375 millicandelas per square
 meter per lux for white or 250 millicandelas per square meter per lux for yellow. The RE will determine initial
 retroreflectance as follows:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 E.
 
 The RE will perform visual inspections at night to identify defective traffic markings that appear to be
 below the specified minimum value.
 The RE will perform retroreflectance measurements with a LTL-2000 Retroreflectometer on a clean, dry
 surface.
 For word markings, the RE will make 3 random retroreflectance measurements on each letter. For
 symbols, the RE will make 9 random retroreflectance measurements over the symbol.
 The RE will average all retroreflectance measurements for each letter or symbol to determine if the
 minimum retroreflectance requirement is met.
 
 Opening to Traffic. Complete each application of traffic markings and allow to thoroughly dry before opening to
 traffic. The RE will determine when the traveled way can be opened to traffic.
 
 610.03.03 Raised Pavement Markers (RPM)
 Lay out the locations of all RPMs before installing to ensure proper placement. Place RPMs as follows:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 Place RPMs on the travel lane side of solid paint lines at a distance of 2 inches from the near edge of the paint
 line to the near edge of the RPM.
 Place amber RPMs between double yellow paint lines when there is no conflict with a longitudinal joint.
 Place RPMs located along skip lines on the line’s longitudinal center axis and at the midpoint of the unpainted
 gap between each dash.
 When placing RPMs near longitudinal joints, place at least 2 inches from the joint.
 
 Obtain RE approval of RPM locations before beginning sawcutting operations. If the pre-installation layout determines
 that a RPM is to be placed at a transverse joint or at a location that shows evidence of cracking, checking, spalling, or the
 failure of underlying base material, relocate the RPM longitudinally. Obtain RE approval of the proposed relocation.
 Ensure that the center-to-center RPM distance does not deviate from the specified distance by ±4 feet. If the center-tocenter distance for the proposed relocation deviates from the specified center-to-center distance by ±4 feet, do not install
 the RPM.
 When placing RPMs on bridge deck surfaces, locate reinforcement steel in the bridge decks using a pachometer. Do not
 place RPMs in any location that would expose the existing reinforcement steel. Repair damage to the reinforcement
 steel or bridge deck that is caused by the installation of RPMs.
 Sawcut roadway grooves to the depth, width, and diameter specified by the RPM manufacturer. Sawcut only those
 grooves for RPMs that will be installed during the same workday.
 Ensure that roadway grooves are free of dirt, dust, oil, grease, moisture, curing compounds, loose or unsound pavement,
 or other material that may interfere with bonding of the epoxy compound. Sand blast grooves where necessary. Ensure
 that the grooves are dry where installing RPMs.
 Apply epoxy compound according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Do not apply epoxy compound when either
 the pavement surface or ambient air temperature is less than 50 °F at the time of application.
 Install RPMs according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. RPM leveling lugs shall rest on the pavement surface.
 Do not allow lugs to drop below the pavement surface. The tips of each RPM’s snow plow deflecting surface must
 remain below the roadway surface.
 
 252
 
 Use reflector adhesive to bond each RPM lens to its casting. The RE will reject a RPM if visible buildup of epoxy
 compound or reflector adhesive affects its optical performance.
 610.03.04 Removal of RPMs
 Remove RPMs that are not installed to full depth or that have a raised end exposed above the pavement surface. Fill the
 hole with approved material and install a new RPM longitudinally within 2 feet.

 stripes or markings.
 Dispose of RPMs as specified in 201.03.09.
 610.03.05 Removal and Replacement of RPM Lenses
 Remove existing RPM lenses and install new mono-directional or bi-directional pavement reflector lenses using methods
 that do not damage the RPM castings.
 Dispose of RPM lenses as specified in 201.03.09.
 610.03.06 Ground Mounted Flexible Delineators
 Use white for delineators located on the right side when facing in the direction of traffic. Use yellow for delineators
 located on the left side when facing in the direction of traffic.
 Drive ground mounted flexible delineators vertically into the ground to a minimum depth of 18 inches. Position flexible
 delineators so that the plane face of the center of the reflective area is at an angle of 0 degrees with a line that is
 perpendicular to the direction of traffic.
 610.03.07 Rumble Strips
 At least 20 days before constructing rumble strips, submit a plan for the cutting and collection of the material to the RE
 for approval. Construct rumble strips after traffic striping operations have been completed.
 Clean the shoulder area where rumble strips are to be installed. Construct rumble strips by cutting indentations into the
 pavement perpendicular to the edge of the shoulder without disturbing the surrounding pavement. Collect cuttings and
 reuse as specified in 202.03.07.A.
 610.03.08 Removal of Traffic Stripes and Markings
 Remove traffic stripes and traffic markings using methods that do not damage the underlying or adjacent pavement, and
 do not cause gouging or create ridges or grooves in the pavement. Before beginning removal operations, demonstrate to
 the RE the proposed method to remove at least 95 percent of stripes or markings without removing more than 1/16 inch
 of pavement thickness. Obtain RE approval before beginning removal operations.
 The removal area includes the area of the stripe or marking plus 1 inch on all sides. Only remove traffic stripes or
 markings that will be replaced during the same workday.

 651.03 CONSTRUCTION
 651.03.01 Water Pipe
 A.
 
 Scheduling of Work and Interruption to Water Service. Provide the RE and the Utility with a detailed schedule
 of the work. Notify the Utility in writing at least 15 days before beginning construction of water facilities. Do not
 perform work on water facilities that will result in water service interruptions from April 1 through September 30
 without approval of the Utility. The Department may extend this period based on weather conditions and system
 demand requirements as determined by the Utility. Perform the work to minimize adverse impact to the Utility’s
 operations.
 Perform work in a manner that is acceptable to the Utility’s inspector, and in coordination with the RE. Provide the
 Utility’s inspector with access to the work.
 
 B.
 
 Existing Utilities and Structures. Determine the location of surface and subsurface structures within the work
 site, including but not limited to underground electric, telecommunication, gas, and sewer facilities. Notify the RE
 when excavation is required within 10 feet of any existing utility, and submit a plan to the RE for approval,
 detailing the proposed methods of excavating around the existing utilities, and the proposed methods of protecting
 and supporting the existing utilities. Protect and support utility facilities encountered. Notify the RE and the
 Utility 3 days before crossing any existing utilities, so that the Utility may send a representative to the work site at
 the time of excavation or construction.
 Remove and dispose of abandoned pipe, services, valves, boxes, thrust blocks, and appurtenances, unless otherwise
 shown on the Plans as specified in 201.03.09. Cap or plug pipe that is to be abandoned in a manner that is
 acceptable to the Utility.
 
 C.
 
 Excavating. Before excavating, sawcut the full depth of the existing pavement and sidewalk. Excavate a trench
 for placing water pipe, valves, services, tees, or appurtenances. Obtain RE approval before finishing excavation. If
 
 257
 
 the RE determines that the bottom of the trench is unstable, undercut as directed by the RE and backfill with Class
 B bedding. If the material at the bottom of the trench is rock or other hard material, excavate an additional 6 inches
 of the material below the bottom of the pipe. Backfill the undercut with Class C bedding. Ensure that trenches are
 kept free of any standing water during the installation. Do not excavate for trenches in embankments until the
 embankment has been constructed to an elevation of at least 3 feet above the top of the pipe or to the top of the
 embankment, whichever is lower. Do not excavate trenches more than 300 feet in advance of installing the pipe
 unless approved by the RE.
 Maintain trenches according to 29 CFR 1926. Provide and maintain trench crossings where necessary. For
 trenches in the traveled way, shoulder and within 30 feet of the outside edge of the shoulder, backfill and restore the
 pavement structure and match the surrounding condition before opening to traffic. The Contractor may use
 temporary protection instead of backfilling trenches in the traveled way and shoulder. If using temporary
 protection, submit working drawings for approval. For trenches not in the traveled way and shoulder, do not leave
 trenches open overnight unless protected with caution fence.
 D.
 
 Handling of Pipe and Accessories. Lift pipe and other items using hoists. Do not drop pipe onto the ground or
 into a trench, and do not permit pipe to roll or skid against other pipe.
 
 E.
 
 Installing Water Pipe. Identify areas where pipe will have less than 4 feet of cover. Provide the RE with a report
 of the identified areas in order to obtain the Utility’s approval.
 Use a laser system to control the alignment and grade of the pipe. Lay water pipe in straight lines. If deviations
 from a straight line are approved by the RE, ensure that the deflection at each pipe joint does not exceed the
 manufacturer’s recommended maximum deflection.
 Provide additional pipe or connections necessary to bypass obstructions or other utilities. Adjust the depth of the
 pipe to pass obstructions, as approved by the RE. When grade changes through curves are required, divide the
 curve among several joints. Install the pipe so that it is solidly supported by the subgrade or pipe bedding as
 required, over its full length except where recesses have been made for joints.
 Ensure that the interior of the pipe is kept clean and free of intrusion by soil, or other foreign material. Ensure that
 the inside of the pipe is maintained clean and that valves and hydrants are in good working order when installed.
 Protect open ends of the pipe at all times and securely seal the openings with plugs approved by the Utility
 whenever work is stopped. Remove the plug, and inspect and clean the interior of the pipe before resuming pipe
 installation.
 Join pipe according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Cut pipe according to the manufacturer’s
 recommendations. Ensure cuts are clean and square. Install gate valves, inserting valves, tapping sleeves, tapping
 valves, valve boxes, blow-offs, and miscellaneous fittings. Set the fittings and valves true to the pipe lines. Ensure
 that valve stems are set plumb. Support the valves with concrete blocking set on firm ground that has been
 compacted using a mechanical plate tamper. Set valve boxes plumb, centered with respect to the valve stem, and
 flush with the finished grade.
 Coordinate the installation of water mains with other work and prevent conflicts and interference with all existing
 facilities and proposed construction. Install tapping valves and insert valves as wet connections with no loss of
 water or interruption of flow. Notify the Utility 15 days before performing wet connections. Perform wet
 connections according to the equipment manufacturer’s recommendations.
 
 F.
 
 Hydrostatic Pressure Testing and Leakage Testing. After laying and joining a complete section of pipe between
 valves, and before backfilling, pressure-test the pipe line. Expel the air from the pipe line through blow-offs or
 taps, and ensure that the caps, plugs, and fittings are adequately braced and anchored. Perform pressure testing of
 the water main according to the AWWA Standard C600 in the presence of the Utility inspector using a minimum
 test pressure of 150 pounds per square inch. Maintain the pressure in the pipe for 120 minutes. Demonstrate that
 flanged, victaulic, or welded joint pipe lines exhibit no leaks under pressure. Demonstrate that the leakage for
 mechanical jointed pipe lines, or push-on joint pipe lines do not exceed the allowable leakage rate as computed by:
 
 258
 
 L=
 
 ND P
 7400
 
 Where:
 L = allowable leakage in gallons per hour
 N = number of joints in length of pipe tested
 D = nominal diameter of pipe in inches
 P = average test pressure during the leakage test in pounds per square inch
 
 Where it is impractical to maintain an open trench for the full length of any section between valves, provide test
 plugs and perform pressure testing and leakage testing to the satisfaction of the Utility
 G.
 
 Backfilling. Symmetrically place backfill on each side of the pipe in lifts not exceeding 6 inches thick, loose
 measurement, and compact with a flat faced tamper using the directed method as specified in 203.03.02.C. Where
 bedding is not required, backfill with suitable excavated material that is free from rock larger than 2 inches in
 diameter. Reuse excess or excavated material as specified in 202.03.07.A. The Contractor may use CLSM as
 alternate backfill material when backfilling trenches. If using CLSM, install as specified in 601.03.01.F. Restore
 the existing pavement structure to the original condition or as shown on the Plans.
 
 H.
 
 Disinfection/Bacteriological Testing. Before placing pipelines into service, disinfect the system according to the
 AWWA Standard C651 except if trench water has entered the main or if the water temperature is less than 41 °F,
 use the continuous feed method. Use hypochlorite or liquid chlorine according to AWWA Standards B-300 and B301 respectively. Introduce and distribute the chlorine into the new lines using a minimum dosage of 50 parts per
 million. Maintain the chlorinated water in the system for a minimum of 24 hours. Contact the Utility inspector to
 verify the chlorine residual is 50 parts per million. Flush the pipe line in a manner approved by the Utility until the
 chlorine concentrations are no higher than generally prevailing in the system.
 Retain a certified Testing Laboratory to sample and test the water for bacteriological and turbidity analysis
 according to the AWWA C651 and the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act (40 CFR, Parts 141 through 143). Ensure
 that the water conforms to the bacteriological standards specified in the New Jersey Safe Drinking Water
 Regulations (N.J.A.C. 7:10-1 et seq.) as well as the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act (40 CFR, Parts 141 through
 143). Provide the test results to the Utility.

 flow from an upstream access point and pump the flow to a downstream access point by providing a pump and bypass
 lines with adequate capacity to handle peak wastewater flow.
 Perform sanitary sewer lining by entry from existing manholes. Modify existing manholes to permit sufficient access to
 perform the work as approved by the RE. Before beginning lining, internally clean new and existing pipe lines so that
 they are free from internal deposits. Remove pipe obstructions and sewer service projections into the sewer in a manner
 approved by the Utility. If an obstruction or sewer service connection projection can not be removed internally, perform
 the removal using an open-cut excavation, and make any necessary pipe repairs in a manner approved by the Utility.
 Perform liner installation according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Ensure that the liner neatly fits the internal
 circumference of the sewer to be lined. Allow for circumferential stretching during insertions according to the
 manufacturer’s recommendations. Perform the work to fully impregnate and cure the liner in-place, or to reform the
 folded liner to fully conform the liner to the pipe interior, depending upon the method used. Monitor the pressures and
 temperatures at both ends of the pipe where the liner is being reformed to ensure the recommended pressures and
 temperatures are available to fully form the liner over the entire length of the liner run. Cool the liner and relieve the
 pressure for the recommended time to maintain the optimum temperatures and pressures to fully form the liner.
 Seal the annular space between the newly installed liner and the sewer pipe where the sewer pipe enters and exits each
 manhole. Finish the seal on the manhole interior with a non-shrink grout. Ensure that the finished liner connection into
 each manhole has a watertight seal. Reinstall existing sewer service connections into the newly lined pipe.

 If splices are required above ground, use a compression solderless connector, and mechanically and electrically secure
 them with the proper tool. Clean the conductors with a minimum of the insulation removed. Insulate splices located in
 standards using insulating tape to provide 1-1/2 times the insulation rating of the original conductor. Coat the taped
 splices with an electrical grade sealant and bonding compound.
 If splices are required below ground in junction boxes or junction box foundations, use a compression solderless
 connector, and mechanically and electrically secure them with the proper tool. Before splicing, clean the conductors
 with a minimum of the insulation removed. Complete splice with a resin splicing kit.
 702.03.05 Traffic Signal Head
 Assemble traffic signal faces using a wrench designed for that purpose. Use mounting fittings designed to function with
 the unit and that provide the proper clearance to aim and adjust the traffic signal head. If directed by the Department,
 install dull black louvers of the specified cut-off angle inside the signal visor using stainless steel sheet-metal screws.
 When attaching the visors, backplates, or adaptors, ensure that they conform and readily fasten to existing mounting
 surfaces without affecting the water and light integrity of the traffic signal head. Make field adjustments of louvers and
 optically programmed traffic signal heads as directed by the Department. Install cable from the traffic signal head to the
 foundation and make connections. If replacing an existing traffic signal head, remove the existing head and cable and
 dispose of as specified in 201.03.09.
 702.03.06 Pedestrian Signal Head
 Install a pedestrian signal head with pole clamp mounting, miscellaneous fittings and hardware, and grommet including
 drilling the standard as required. Install cable from the pedestrian signal head to the foundation and make connections.
 If replacing an existing pedestrian signal head, remove the existing head and cable and dispose of as specified in
 201.03.09.
 
 279
 
 702.03.07 Push Button
 Install a push button that operates on logic ground including its housing, and instruction signage. Install cable from the
 push button to the foundation and make connections. Install the instruction sign and ensure that it conforms to the
 MUTCD.
 If replacing an existing push button, remove the existing head and cable and dispose of as specified in 201.03.09.
 702.03.08 Image Detector
 Install a camera mounted to a mast arm, with an automatic control unit, a pointing device, and all materials needed to
 provide accurate vehicle detection at the specified location. Mount and install according to the manufacturer’s
 recommendation, including all cable and cable connections from the camera to the control unit without splices.
 702.03.09 Loop Detector
 Sawcut the pavement as shown on the Plans. After sawcutting, immediately collect the slurry from the sawcut cavity
 and surrounding pavement surface and dispose of as specified 201.03.09. Clean sawcuts with a 150-pounds-per-squareinch water blast to remove remaining debris in the sawcut cavity, and then blow sawcuts with a hot-air lance to provide a
 dry surface. If not immediately installing the loop wire, install a filler to prevent the sawcut from collapsing.
 Place a continuous length wire in the sawcut. Install wire by laying turns of the wire in the sawcut so there are no kinks
 or curls. Do not strain or stretch the wire insulation around the corners of the sawcut or in the junction box. When
 seating the wire in the bottom of the sawcut, do not damage the wire. Do not splice the wire. Twist the 2 wires that form
 the lead-in wires together in the trench and in the conduit to the nearest junction box. Extend the wire from the sawcut to
 the nearest junction box.
 Connect the loop wire to the loop detector cable using a compression solderless connector, and mechanically and
 electrically secure them with the proper tool. Clean the conductors with a minimum of insulation removed. Insulate the
 joints and splices using a resin splicing kit. After placing the wire, recheck the wire for slack, raised portions, or
 tightness. Correct slack, raised portions, and tightness in the wire.
 After testing the loop for continuity, seal the sawcut with a joint sealant applied according to the manufacturer’s
 recommendation. If installing a loop on a grade steeper than 3 percent, use Type 1 joint sealant. Do not place the joint
 sealant in the sawcut at temperatures below 45 °F or during precipitation. Completely fill the sawcut with the joint
 sealant so there are no air bubbles below the surface. Prevent joint sealant from running out of the trench and on to the
 roadway. Remove joint sealant applied to the roadway. Allow the joint sealant to harden before allowing opening to
 traffic.
 When the roadway in the area of the loop detector is to be resurfaced, or when constructing a new section of roadway,
 install the loop detector immediately below the top layer of pavement. Ensure that the joint sealant is hardened before
 the installation of the pavement.
 702.03.10 Loop Detector Cable
 Install loop detector cable continuously from the controller to the junction box nearest to the loop. Do not splice the loop
 detector cable.
 702.03.11 Temporary and Interim Traffic Signal Systems
 After placing the temporary or interim traffic signal system into operation, inspect the traffic signal system every
 2 months. Fill out a Contractor Maintenance Traffic Signal Inspection Report (Form EL-16C) when the temporary or
 interim traffic signal system becomes operational, when the temporary or interim traffic signal system is modified, and at
 every 2-month inspection.
 Maintain as-built drawings of each signal modification. Place copies of the as-built drawings for each traffic signal
 system modification, Forms EL-16C, and Forms EL-11C in a plastic pocket mounted inside the cabinet door of each
 controller cabinet. Also provide a copy of all forms and as-built drawings to the RE.
 If the temporary or interim traffic signal system fails or becomes damaged, repair and restore the temporary or interim
 traffic signal system to normal operation. Begin repair of the temporary or interim traffic signal system within 2 hours of
 
 280
 
 receiving notice of damage or malfunction from the Department, State police, or local authorities. Ensure that workers
 assigned to such repair work continuously until the traffic signal resumes normal signal operation.
 For each response to a system failure or damage, fill out a Contractor Maintenance Emergency Call Record (Form EL11C) and place it in a plastic pocket mounted inside the cabinet door of each controller cabinet.
 If the Contractor fails to respond to a failure or damage notification and begin work within 2 hours of notification, or
 does not continue to work until the temporary or interim traffic signal system resumes normal operation, the Department,
 in the interest of safety, will respond with its own forces to restore normal operation. If the Department mobilizes its
 forces to effect repairs, the Contractor agrees to pay the Department a sum of $3000 for costs of mobilizing its forces and
 equipment. In addition, the Contractor must pay the Department the actual cost of material used for the repair and pay
 the actual costs of police traffic protection. The Department will recover the total amount as specified in 107.16.

 Provide and install lamp, ballast terminals, cable connectors (fused and nonfused), and 2 No. 10 AWG color-coded,
 multiple-lighting wires extending from the ballast terminals to the distribution wires in the base of the standard or in the
 adjacent junction box.
 Tag lighting wire by identifying the area, circuit, and luminaire number.
 Use color-coded, single-conductor, multiple-lighting wire for lighting circuits. Pull conductors through conduit and
 junction boxes to allow racking and connection to luminaire and meter cabinet. Seal the underground conduit entrance
 to meter cabinets or transformer enclosures with a sealing compound.
 Except for neutral and ground circuits, color-code lighting wire with plastic, colored tape overlapped from duct edge to
 duct edge within each junction box. Clearly identify neutral (white) and ground (green) circuits with continuous color
 compound along their entire lengths within the junction box.
 Identify the circuit number of conductors by attaching cable identification tags to each conductor in all junction boxes
 and at the meter cabinets of the load centers. Secure tags to the conductor using nylon cable ties.
 
 283
 
 If pulling multiple-lighting wire through existing junction boxes not equipped with cable racks, install cable racks.
 For cable splices in boxes, use a Type C copper pressure connector, and mechanically and electrically secure splices with
 the proper tool. Clean the conductors with a minimum of insulation removed.
 For multiple-lighting wire splices, use a resin splicing kit as follows:
 1.
 2.
 
 Use an in-line type splicing kit for joining a single conductor to another to form 1 continuous through
 conductor.
 Use a tap or wye-type splicing kit where it is necessary to obtain a tap connection at a through conductor or
 where it is necessary to join together more than 2 conductors.
 
 Keep the conductors and splicing connector centered within the mold, so an even amount of resin surrounds the splice.
 If fastening electrical boxes to masonry with expansion fasteners, provide fasteners of sufficient size and strength to
 provide adequate support. Use stainless steel mounting bolts and anchors. If not using a boss, secure conduit entering
 electrical boxes to the box using lock nuts on the inside and outside of the box.
 When a luminaire is shown on the Plans as being replaced, install a luminaire and cable connectors (fused and nonfused).

 at 1310 and 1550 nanometers in both directions. Ensure that the maximum decibel loss for any single
 event is not greater that 0.3 decibels at 1310 nanometers; however, ensure that the OTDR machine
 threshold is set to record all events greater than or equal in absolute value to 0.05 decibels along the
 positive and negative axes. Events revealed by the OTDR machine bi-directional trace average to
 exceed 0.3 decibels are cause for the rejection of the cable. If directed, remove and replace the cable.
 Ensure that the net result of the bi-directional trace average at 1310 nanometers across a splice event is
 not greater than 0.15 decibels. Redo splices revealed by the OTDR machine to be greater than 0.15
 decibels up to 2 additional times in order to achieve 0.15 decibels or less. If the 0.15-decibels value
 cannot be reached in 3 attempts, the RE may employ a third party vendor to re-do the work. The
 Department will recover the cost as specified in 107.16.
 Ensure that reflectance at each connector is better than −55 decibels.

 If not connected into the fiber optic network, obtain and provide communications with a Utility service provider
 from the field microprocessor to the Department WIMS control center in Trenton.
 Make operational electronic and electrical components to monitor volume, speed, length, gap, headway, vehicle
 type classification by axle configuration, and axle weights. The roadway sensors are composed of inductive loop
 detectors, loop leads, weight sensors, and temperature sensor. The WIMS electronics are installed at each work site
 with electrical power and communications for remote station programming, monitoring and failure diagnosis, and
 data retrieval.
 Construct components as follows:
 1
 
 Controller, WIMS. Construct the foundation as specified in 701.03.12.
 At least 30 days before beginning construction, submit working drawings for approval that include a block
 wiring diagram that illustrates the interconnections of the WIMS components from the field location to the
 control center in Trenton. Identify each component by manufacturer, model, and CLEI number.
 Securely bolt the controller cabinet to the foundation in a vertical position using stainless steel hardware. Seal
 the underground conduit entrance to the controller with a sealing compound.
 
 2.
 
 WIM Roadway Devices. Install the devices according to the manufacturer’s requirements. Pressure wash
 and dry the sawcut as recommended by the manufacturer. Ensure that sensors, loop detector wires, and cables
 are installed in separate conduit per type of device and that conduit is waterproofed and sealed. Ensure that
 the temperature sensor is installed in a schedule 80 PVC conduit in the shoulder of the roadway. Maintain at
 least 3 feet of space between the saw cut loops and the sensors. After completion of the HMA, re-establish
 the location of each loop edge to facilitate and mark for cutting of the slot for the axle weight sensor. Ensure
 that the lengths of weight sensors do not exceed the width of the lanes. Do not splice cables. Grind the top of
 the encapsulation material flushed with the road.
 Ensure that the piezoelectric sensors are installed perpendicular to the flow of traffic and are without twists or
 curls. Shorter sensors (6 feet length) are positioned to one side in a wheel path, not in the center of the lane;
 longer sensors are typically centered in the lane. Cut a slot for the sensor that is 8 inches longer than the
 sensor. Do not mix or place the epoxy until the RE has approved all cleaning operations.
 
 C.
 
 Testing. Perform testing as specified in 704.03.01.C, except do not perform Level B as specified in
 704.03.01.C.1.b. Also perform the testing as follows:
 
 296
 
 Use an LCR Meter to measure the capacitance, resistance, and dissipation factor of each sensor. When the lane is
 opened to traffic, perform a functional test on the sensor using an oscilloscope.
 Provide a 5-axle tractor-trailer combination (3-axle tractor and 2-axle semi-trailer) and driver for calibration of the
 WIM system. Weigh the calibration truck on a certified, multi-draft public scale. Also weigh the steering axle,
 drive tandem axles, and trailer tandem axles. Record and provide the weight data to the RE at the start of the test.
 Include the total gross weight of the combination. Ensure that the truck has an air-ride suspension and is in good
 mechanical condition. Ensure that the trailer is a dry van type and loaded with a non-shifting load so that the gross
 weight of the tractor-trailer combination is between 75,000 and 80,000 pounds. Ensure that the axle-loads do not
 exceed New Jersey Title 39 limits, and do not violate the Federal Bridge Formula.
 Drive the truck over each lane a minimum of 5 times and record the axle and gross weights as determined by the
 WIM system by each sensor for each pass. Use the average values among the 5 passes to calculate a calibration
 factor for each sensor. Perform this test twice.
 After the calibration, ensure that the average values recorded by the WIM system are within 10 percent of each axle
 weight (average axle weight of each axle group) and within 5 percent of the gross weight of the combination of the
 weights recorded at the public scale.
 If the system cannot be properly calibrated after 3 attempts, the RE may employ a third party vendor to re-do the
 work. The Department will recover the cost as specified in 107.16.

 808.03.01 Placing Sod
 Before placing sod, place 4 inches of topsoil as specified in 804.03.01. Incorporate fertilizer, applied at a rate that yields
 50 pounds of nitrogen per acre. Incorporate pulverized limestone, if necessary, to adjust the pH of the topsoil to 6.5 as
 specified in 806.03.01.B.
 With each delivery of sod, submit to the RE a delivery slip, indicating the time and date of harvest and the quantity of
 sod, and a New Jersey Department of Agriculture certification. Within 36 hours of harvesting, deliver and lay the sod.
 Lay sod with staggered joints pressed closely together. Match the ends of sod strips so that the ends and sides always lie
 flush with each other. Press sod into the underlying soil by hand tamping and rolling to produce an even surface.
 On slopes, start placing sod at the bottom. At the top of slopes, turn the upper edge of the sod strips into the soil and
 cover with topsoil. On slopes steeper than 3H:1V, hold sod in place with pegs driven flush with the surface of the sod.
 Do not space the pegs more than 1 foot apart. Use at least 2 pegs for each strip of sod.
 Water until infiltration occurs through the root zone and into the topsoil zone in a manner that provides equal distribution
 and coverage to all areas sodded. Rewater as necessary until a firm root mass is established.
 
 307
 
 Do not place sod when the moisture content of the topsoil may adversely affect the sod. If the upper 1/2-inch of topsoil
 is dry, moisten the soil immediately before laying the sod.
 Immediately replace sod that is dead or unhealthy.
 After a firm root mass is established and before the turf reaches the height of 3 to 4 inches, mow the turf to a height of 11/2 to 2 inches with a machine that does not produce ruts, contribute to soil compaction, or damage the sod.
 Subsequently mow as directed.

 C.
 
 Layout. Before planting, stake plant locations and bed outlines and obtain Department approval. Immediately
 notify the RE to arrange for Departmental guidance if existing conditions prevent planting at the exact locations
 shown on the Plans. The Department may adjust plant locations to meet field conditions.
 
 D.
 
 Planting Beds. Spray existing vegetation within proposed planting beds during the growing season with
 glyphosate at the manufacturer’s recommended rates. The Department may direct the reapplication of glyphosate
 10 days after the first application. Mow the dead vegetation as closely as possible to existing ground, or turn it into
 the soil.
 If the use of glyphosate is ineffective, mechanically remove existing vegetation from the bed area and cultivate to a
 depth of 6 inches.
 Cultivate perennial planting beds to a depth of 6 to 8 inches, and grade beds smooth immediately before planting.
 Plant Narcissus bulbs to a depth of 8 inches.
 
 E.
 
 Excavation for Plant Pits and Beds. Before excavating for plant pits and beds, ensure that the areas conform to
 the specified lines and grades. On slopes steeper than 4H:1V, excavate pits no more than 5 days in advance of
 planting.
 Excavate pits for balled and burlapped plants to a minimum of 2 times the width of the root ball and no deeper than
 the root ball as measured from the bottom of the trunk flare to the bottom of the ball. Excavate pits for
 containerized plants to a minimum of 2 times the width of the container and no deeper than the actual height of the
 root mass within the container. Ensure that side slopes of all pits taper down from the rim of the pit to the outer
 edge of the bottom of the ball. Ensure that the sides of the pits are loosened and roughened to promote root
 penetration. Obtain RE approval before reusing topsoil from the excavated pits
 For seedlings, vines, ground covers, and perennials, excavate pits to a minimum 12-inch diameter and 12-inch
 depth.
 Reuse excavation as specified in 202.03.07.A. Dispose of sod, weeds, roots, and other objectionable material as
 specified in 201.03.09.
 If the Contractor does not plan to plant excavated pits before the end of the working day, provide a plan, to the RE
 for approval, 5 days before planting that details the measures to ensure safety.
 
 F.
 
 Pruning. Prune according to ANSI A 300 to preserve the natural character of each plant. Limit pruning at the time
 of planting to the removal of dead, conflicting, and broken branches. Do not prune the leaders of trees. Ensure that
 experienced personnel, using properly conditioned equipment and methods in keeping with accepted horticultural
 practice, perform all pruning.
 
 G.
 
 Setting Plants. Set plants plumb and at the same depth at which they were grown in the nursery, except set trees
 with a trunk flare 1/2 to 1 inch above the surrounding grade to allow for settling. Set roots for the various
 conditions as follows:
 
 311
 
 1.
 
 Balled and Burlapped Plants. Handle and move plants only by the ball. Either remove, or loosen and fold
 back the burlap from the upper 1/2 of the ball. When balled and burlapped plants are in wire baskets, remove
 the entire wire basket, preserving the integrity of the ball.
 
 2.
 
 Containerized Plants. Immediately before planting, remove the container, and make 3 vertical cuts
 equidistantly spaced around the perimeter of the root mass. Make each cut 1/2 inch deep from the top of the
 root-earth mass to the bottom.
 
 H.
 
 Backfilling. Backfill with topsoil around the root system. Hand-tamp the topsoil and water at the rate of 15
 gallons per square yard of pit area to settle the topsoil and to remove air pockets. Ensure that the topsoil is not
 frozen at the time of backfilling. Where necessary, backfill areas that have settled with topsoil. Form a 4-inch high
 compacted berm using topsoil around individual plants to a diameter equal to that of the pit. Ensure that the berm
 functions properly throughout the plant establishment period.
 
 I.
 
 Watering. Water plants with sufficient frequency and quantity to ensure that the soil surrounding the root system
 remains moist but not saturated
 
 J.
 
 Staking and Guying. Immediately after planting, stake or guy trees either 1 inch or more in caliper or more than 3
 feet in height. Ensure that guy wires allow for normal sway. Ensure that trees remain plumb.
 
 K.
 
 Tree Protection. Install tree protectors to a height of 2 feet above the ground surface on all planted Malus and
 Crataegus species to prevent damage from bark consuming rodents.
 
 L.
 
 Mulching. Treat all beds with a pre-emergent herbicide before placing mulch. Mulch plants as specified in
 809.03.02. Neatly edge the beds to produce a smooth, flowing edge line.
 
 M. Caring for Plants. Maintain plants in a healthy growing condition during the life of the Contract by watering,
 weeding, spraying with pesticides, pruning, remulching, maintaining guys and stakes, and other operations as
 necessary.
 N.
 
 Restoration and Cleanup. Where existing turf areas have been damaged during planting operations, restore the
 disturbed areas as specified in 806.03.01. Dispose of debris as specified in 201.03.09.
 
 811.03.02 Plant Establishment Period
 Upon completion of all plantings, request that an inspection be made by the Department to determine if the plants are
 alive and healthy. The Department will inspect plantings between May 1 and October 1st. Replace plants as specified in
 811.03.01 that are missing or not alive and healthy. If replacing plants outside of the optimal planting season as
 specified in Table 811.03.01-1, only use containerized or balled and burlapped plants that are certified as being dug
 dormant. The plant establishment period will begin when the Department determines that 100 percent of the plants are
 alive and healthy.
 Ensure the plantings are cared for during the plant establishment period by keeping the plants in a healthy growing
 condition by watering, weeding, spraying with pesticides, pruning, remulching disturbed areas, maintaining guys and
 stakes, and by other operations as horticulturally necessary.
 The Department will reinspect the plants approximately 1 year after the start of the plant establishment period. If the
 Department determines that plants need to be replaced, replant plants as specified in 811.03.01 within 3 weeks. If
 replanting outside of the optimal planting season as specified in Table 811.03.01-1, only use containerized or balled and
 burlapped plants that are certified as being dug dormant.
 The Department will reinspect the plants approximately 2 years after the start of the plant establishment period. If the
 Department determines that plants need to be replaced, replant plants as specified in 811.03.01 within 3 weeks. If
 replacing outside of the optimal planting season as specified in Table 811.03.01-1, only use containerized or balled and
 burlapped plants that are certified as being dug dormant.
 Remove stakes, guys, and guy wires within the last month of the conclusion of the plant establishment period. At the
 conclusion of the plant establishment period, remove and dispose of weeds, debris, and damaged plant material as
 specified in 201.03.09. Treat planting beds with a pre-emergence herbicide.

 DIVISION 900 – MATERIALS
 
 SECTION 901 – AGGREGATES
 901.01 SOURCE
 Use aggregates from a single source and geological classification in any 1 construction item unless otherwise authorized.
 Use only sources of aggregate that are listed on the QPL.
 The ME may allow aggregates from different sources if they are of the same geological classification and have similar
 specific gravities and aggregate properties.
 Use test methods for gradation according to the appropriate provisions of AASHTO T 11 or T 27, unless otherwise
 noted. Gradations of aggregates in the various tables of this and other Sections are the percentages passing by weight.
 The aggregate producer shall submit annually, to the ME for approval, a quality control plan for the aggregate products.
 The aggregate producer may obtain guidelines for developing the quality control plan from the ME upon request.
 901.02 STOCKPILES
 Provide an area for each stockpile of adequate size, reasonably uniform in cross-section, well drained, and cleared of
 foreign materials.
 At concrete and HMA mixing plants, stockpile a sufficient quantity of aggregate to provide for a minimum of 1 day’s
 operations. Place the aggregate stockpiles on a firm, hard surface, such as a compacted aggregate, HMA, or concrete
 surface. Construct the stockpile by placing the aggregates in layers of not more than 3 feet thick.
 Locate the piles so that there is no contamination by foreign material and no intermingling of aggregates from adjacent
 piles. Do not use steel-tracked equipment on the stockpiles.
 Do not store aggregates from different sources, geological classifications, or of different gradings in stockpiles near each
 other unless a bulkhead is placed between the different materials. If blending aggregates of different gradings and from
 different sources, proportion through weigh hoppers. The ME may allow loader blending of aggregate stockpiles if
 included in the approved aggregate producer’s quality control plan. The Department will reject aggregates found
 segregated or contaminated. If a stockpile is rejected for segregation, the Contractor may reconstruct it for further
 evaluation. Use methods that prevent segregation when charging aggregates from stockpiles.
 Do not use washed aggregates sooner than 24 hours after washing or until the surplus water has drained out and the
 material has a uniform moisture content.
 Do not stockpile RAP higher than 15 feet. Cover or otherwise protect stockpiles of RAP for use in HMA to prevent
 buildup of moisture.
 901.03 COARSE AGGREGATE
 Obtain coarse aggregate as specified in 901.01. Use coarse aggregate that is broken stone or washed gravel graded as
 specified Table 901.03-1. Stockpile coarse aggregate as specified in 901.02. The ME will sample coarse aggregate as
 specified in Table 901.03-2.

 of clay, quartz, and feldspar or the fine-grained thermal recrystallization products of this assemblage
 (hornfels). Ensure rock is bedded thickly enough so as not to break into thin pieces at planes of stratification.
 
 2.
 
 Carbonate Rock. A thoroughly indurated and cohesive rock composed predominantly of calcite and
 dolomite, bedded thickly enough so as not to break into thin pieces at planes of stratification. Minerals
 insoluble in hot hydrochloric acid are discrete grains of quartz, clay, and mica.
 
 3.
 
 Gneiss. A metamorphic rock consisting principally of quartz and feldspar. Ensure rock has a dense structure,
 with a uniform distribution of minerals that will not break into thin pieces at lines of stratification.
 
 4.
 
 Granite. An equigranular or porphyritic igneous rock consisting principally of quartz and feldspar.
 
 5.
 
 Quartzite. A metamorphic rock composed principally of quartz. Quarry rock so that only the nonarkosic,
 uniformly compacted quartzites are included in the graded products. Ensure quartzite is not schistose in
 structure.
 
 6.
 
 Trap Rock. An igneous rock, locally, either basalt or diabase, with a uniform distribution of constituent
 minerals. Amygdaloidal or vesicular basalt is not considered trap rock and is considered a deleterious
 material for testing purposes.

 gravel, or sand. Mixtures may contain some silt, clay, or stone dust. Ensure that stone conforms to 901.03.01, and that
 gravel is crushed or uncrushed and conforms to 901.03.02. Use sand that is either natural sand resulting from the
 weathering process or stone sand produced by grinding or crushing of rock. Ensure that stone sand is manufactured from
 an aggregate source as specified in 901.03. Provide natural sand consisting of material composed of predominantly
 angular particles of quartz or other hard, durable minerals.
 The Contractor may use soil aggregate produced from RPCSA produced by a NJDEP approved “Class B” recycling
 center operating pursuant to N.J.A.C 7:26A.
 Do not place soil aggregate obtained from subaqueous sources until the ME has determined that its moisture content is
 not excessive.
 Ensure that soil aggregate conforms to the following:
 1.
 
 Composition of Soil Aggregate. Ensure that the soil aggregate is free from elements or chemicals which, in
 the presence of water, would produce detrimental effects to pavements, structures, or utility lines, and is free
 of organic matter, garbage, metal, debris, lumps of clay, or other deleterious matter.
 Produce Designations I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4, I-9, I-10, I-11, I-12, I-13, and I-15 from sand, gravel, or stone.
 Produce Designation I-5 from hard, durable gravel or stone mixed with sand or stone dust so that it can be
 compacted into a hard, dense mass. Ensure that the coarse aggregate fraction of the I-5 is composed of at least
 85 percent by weight of hard, durable aggregate of a geologic type conforming to 901.03, as determined by
 lithologic analysis performed according to NJDOT A-3.
 Ensure that Designations I-6, I-7, and I-8 consist of clean, free-draining sand, gravel, or stone.
 For Designation I-14, use material that is composed of soil aggregate and rock. The material may also contain
 recycled concrete or HMA. Ensure that the proportion of soil aggregate is sufficient to fill all voids in the
 rock and larger pieces of recycled material.
 
 2.
 
 Gradation. Use soil aggregate that conforms to the gradation specified in Table 901.11-1 for the various
 designations. The gradation requirements shall apply to the material after it has been placed and compacted
 on the Project. Where compaction is not prescribed, the requirements for any given type shall apply to the
 material at the time of placement. Should the source contain oversize material, the RE may require the
 Contractor to eliminate such oversize material.
 
 322
 
 For Designation I-14, ensure that the portion of material passing the 4-inch sieve contains no more than 35
 percent by weight of material passing the No. 200 sieve. Ensure that the proportion of soil aggregate is
 sufficient to fill all voids in the rock and larger pieces of recycled material. When embankments are
 constructed outside the ROW in areas where the State has purchased slope rights to construct embankments,
 use material that is 100 percent passing the 2-inch sieve to construct the top 2-1/2 feet. When driving piles
 through the embankment, use material that is 100 percent passing the 2-inch sieve.

 The ME may sample stockpiles before placement, but the Department will make the final and governing determination
 of conformance or nonconformance based on sampling and testing of the materials after they have been placed as
 specified in the Contract. Remove materials that do not conform and replace with conforming materials, or correct the
 deficiencies of the non-conforming materials. If corrective action has been taken, the ME will take an additional sample,
 and if necessary, one check sample. If the materials still do not conform after corrective action, the ME will not perform
 further testing until the Contractor tests and certifies that the rejected material has been corrected. After this
 certification, the ME will analyze an additional sample, and if this sample does not meet the requirements, the Contractor
 shall remove and replace the material.
 
 SECTION 902 – ASPHALT
 902.01 BITUMINOUS MATERIALS
 Use the following temperature-volume correction (TVC) factors to convert the volume of bituminous materials,
 measured at the temperature at the point of use, to the volume at 60 °F:
 1.
 
 For PG Binder and MC 800, use the following equation:
 TVC = 1.0211326242 − 3.548988118 × 10−4 [T (°F)] + 4.49881 × 10−8 [T (°F)]2
 
 2.
 
 For all other cutbacks, use the following equation:
 TVC = 1.02413769 − 4.0641418 × 10−4 [T (°F)] + 6.79176 × 10−8 [T (°F)]2
 
 3. For emulsified asphalts, use Table 902.01-1.

 902.02.03 Mix Design
 Submit a mix design including a job mix formula (JMF) for each mixture on forms supplied by the ME. Include a
 statement naming the source of each component and a report showing that the results conform to the criteria specified in
 Table 902.02.03-1, Table 902.02.03-2, and Table 902.02.03-3. If a change in sources or properties of materials occur,
 the ME may require the HMA producer to establish a new mix design and to obtain approval before production can
 continue.
 To establish the JMF for each mix design, determine the percentage of dry weight of aggregate passing each required
 sieve size and an optimum percentage of asphalt binder based upon the weight of the total mix. Determine the optimum
 percentage of asphalt binder according to AASHTO M 323 and R 35. Combine the aggregates to ensure that the
 resulting mixture conforms to the grading requirements specified in Table 902.02.03-1. In determining the percentage of
 aggregates of the various sizes necessary to conform to gradation requirements, exclude the asphalt binder.

 For 37.5-mm nominal maximum size mixtures, the specified lower limit of the VFA is 64 percent for all design traffic levels.
 As determined from the values for the maximum specific gravity of the mix and the bulk specific gravity of the compacted
 mixture. Maximum specific gravity of the mix is determined according to AASHTO T 209. Bulk specific gravity of the
 compacted mixture is determined according to AASHTO T 166. For verification, specimens must be between 95.0 and 97.0
 percent of maximum specific gravity at Ndes.
 
 For mix designs that include RAP or GBSM, also include the following based on the weight of the total mixture:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 
 Percentage of RAP or GBSM.
 Percentage of asphalt binder in the RAP or GBSM.
 Percentage of new asphalt binder.
 Total percentage of asphalt binder.
 Percentage of each type of virgin aggregate.
 
 At the ME’s request, test the mix design to ensure that it meets a minimum tensile strength ratio of 80 percent, when
 tested according to AASHTO T 283. The ME will require tensile strength ratio testing for new aggregate sources and for
 aggregates suspected of stripping susceptibility.
 For each mix design, submit with the mix design forms 2 gyratory specimens and 1 loose sample corresponding to the
 composition of the JMF. The ME will use these to verify the properties of the JMF. Compact the specimens to the
 design number of gyrations (Ndes). For the mix design to be acceptable, all gyratory specimens must comply with the
 
 328
 
 requirements specified in Table 902.02.03-1 and Table 902.02.03-3. The ME reserves the right to be present at the time
 the gyratory specimens are molded.
 The ME’s may verify a mix on an annual basis rather than on a project-to-project basis if the properties and proportions
 of the materials do not change. If written verification is submitted by the HMA supplier that the same source and
 character of materials are to be used, the ME may waive the requirement for the design and verification of previously
 approved mixes.
 902.02.04 Sampling and Testing
 A.
 
 General Acceptance Requirements. The RE or ME may reject and require disposal of any batch or shipment that
 is rendered unfit for its intended use due to contamination, segregation, improper temperature, lumps of cold
 material, or incomplete coating of the aggregate. For other than improper temperature, visual inspection of the
 material by the RE or ME is considered sufficient grounds for such rejection.
 For PG 64-22 or PG 70-22, ensure that the temperature of the mixture at discharge from the plant or surge and
 storage bins is at least 290 °F when the ambient temperature is less than 50 °F or is at least 275 °F when the
 ambient temperature is greater than or equal to 50 °F. For PG 76-22, ensure that the temperature of the mixture at
 discharge from the plant or surge and storage bins is at least 10 °F above the manufacturer’s recommended
 laydown temperature. Do not allow the mixture temperature to exceed 330 °F at discharge from the plant.
 Combine and mix the aggregates and asphalt binder to ensure that at least 95 percent of the coarse aggregate
 particles are entirely coated with asphalt binder as determined according to AASHTO T 195. If the ME determines
 that there is an on-going problem with coating, the ME may obtain random samples from 5 trucks and will
 determine the adequacy of the mixing on the average of particle counts made on these 5 test portions. If the
 requirement for 95 percent coating is not met on each sample, modify plant operations, as necessary, to obtain the
 required degree of coating.
 
 B.
 
 Sampling. The ME will take 5 stratified random samples of HMA for volumetric acceptance testing from each lot
 of approximately 3500 tons of a mix. When a lot of HMA is less than 3500 tons, the ME will take samples at
 random for each mix at the rate of one sample for each 700 tons. The ME will perform sampling according to
 AASHTO T 168, NJDOT B-2, or ASTM D 3665.
 Use a portion of the samples taken for volumetric acceptance testing for composition testing, unless composition is
 determined by hot bin analysis. If using hot bin analysis at a fully automated batch plant, take 5 samples from each
 lot corresponding to the volumetric acceptance samples, under the supervision of the ME.
 
 C.
 
 Quality Control Testing. The HMA producer shall provide a quality control (QC) technician who is certified by
 the Society of Asphalt Technologists of New Jersey as an Asphalt Technologist, Level 2. The QC technician may
 substitute equivalent technician certification by the Mid-Atlantic Region Technician Certification Program
 (MARTCP). Ensure that the QC technician is present during periods of mix production for the sole purpose of
 quality control testing and to assist the ME. The ME will not perform the quality control testing or other routine
 test functions in the absence of, or instead of, the QC technician.
 The QC technician shall perform sampling and testing according to the approved quality control plan, to keep the
 mix within the limits specified for the mix being produced. The QC technician may use acceptance test results or
 perform additional testing as necessary to control the mix.
 To determine the composition, perform ignition oven testing according to AASHTO T 308. For fully automated
 plants, the QC technician may determine composition using hot bin analysis according to NJDOT B-5. Use only
 one method for determining composition within a lot.
 For each acceptance test, perform maximum specific gravity testing according to AASHTO T 209 on a test portion
 of the sample taken by the ME. Sample and test coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, mineral filler, and RAP
 according to the approved quality control plan for the plant.
 When using RAP, ensure that the supplier has in operation an ongoing daily quality control program to evaluate the
 RAP. As a minimum, this program shall consist of the following:
 1.
 
 An evaluation performed to ensure that the material conforms to 901.05.04 and compares favorably with
 the design submittal.
 
 329
 
 2.
 3.
 D.
 
 An evaluation of the RAP material performed using a solvent or an ignition oven to qualitatively
 evaluate the aggregate components to determine conformance to 901.05.
 Quality control reports as directed by the ME.
 
 Acceptance Testing and Requirements. The ME will determine volumetric properties at Ndes for acceptance from
 samples taken, compacted, and tested at the HMA plant. The ME will compact HMA to the number of design
 gyrations (Ndes) specified in Table 902.02.03-2, using equipment according to AASHTO T 312. The ME will
 determine bulk specific gravity of the compacted sample according to AASHTO T 166. The ME will use the most
 current QC maximum specific gravity test result in calculating the volumetric properties of the HMA.
 The ME will determine the dust-to-binder ratio from the composition results as tested by the QC technician.
 Ensure that the HMA mixture conforms to the requirements specified in Table 902.02.04-1, and to the gradation
 requirements in Table 902.02.03-1. If 2 samples in a lot fail to conform to the gradation or volumetric
 requirements, immediately initiate corrective action.
 The ME will test a minimum of 1 sample per lot for moisture, basing moisture determinations on the weight loss of
 an approximately 1600-gram sample of mixture heated for 1 hour in an oven at 280 ± 5°F. Ensure that the moisture
 content of the mixture at discharge from the plant does not exceed 1.0 percent.

 compacted mixture is determined according to AASHTO T 166.
 
 Plants Producing for Multiple Projects. When a plant is producing HMA for 2 or more Department projects at
 the same time, the ME will establish 1 common lot for each mix and will use the sample results for the lot to
 represent the HMA for each Contract on which a part of that lot was used.
 
 902.03 OPEN-GRADED FRICTION COURSE (OGFC) AND MODIFIED OPEN-GRADED FRICTION
 COURSE (MOGFC)
 902.03.01 Composition of Mixtures
 Mix OGFC and MOGFC in a plant that is listed on the QPL and conforms to the requirements for HMA plants as
 specified in 1009.01.
 Composition of mixture for OGFC and MOGFC is coarse aggregate, fine aggregate and asphalt binder. Ensure that the
 mixture conforms to the following requirements:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 Use aggregate for OGFC and MOGFC that conforms to 901.10, except, for coarse aggregate, use broken stone
 of gneiss, granite, quartzite, or trap rock. Do not use RAP, CRCG, GBSM, or RPCSA.
 Use asphalt binder for OGFC and MOGFC that is PG 76-22 as specified in 902.01.01.
 For MOGFC, add a stabilizing additive consisting of mineral fiber or cellulose fiber to the mix. Use a
 stabilizing additive that conforms to the requirements for stabilizing additives in AASHTO MP 8. Use only 1
 type per mix design. If using mineral fibers, use a dosage rate of 0.4 percent by weight of total mix. If using
 cellulose fibers, use a dosage rate of 0.3 percent by weight of total mix. The dosage rate may be increased, as
 necessary, to prevent draindown as measured by the visual draindown determination of asphalt content in
 NJDOT B-8. Accurately control proportioning the fibers into the mixture within ±10 percent of the required
 weight, and use equipment that ensures uniform dispersion of the fibers. Store fibers in a dry location with a
 storage temperature not to exceed 120 °F. The supplier of the cellulose or mineral fibers shall provide a
 certification of compliance, as specified in 106.07, that the material supplied conforms to AASHTO MP 8.
 Ensure that a technical representative from the additive supplier is at the work site for the first full day of
 construction for technical assistance.

 902.03.02 Mix Design
 Submit a mix design including JMF for each mixture on forms supplied by the Department. Include a statement naming
 the source of each component and a report with the results for the criteria specified in Table 902.03.03-1. Design the
 mix to meet the criteria in Table 902.03.03-1.
 In the JMF for each mixture, establish the percentage of dry weight of aggregate passing each required sieve size and an
 optimum percentage of asphalt binder based upon the weight of the total mix. Determine the optimum asphalt binder
 content for OGFC as specified in NJDOT B-7. Determine the optimum asphalt binder content for MOGFC as specified
 in NJDOT B-8. Ensure that the JMF is within the master range specified in Table 902.03.03-1.
 Prepare compacted test specimens for submittal to the ME at least 30 days before the initial production date. Prepare
 these specimens from material mixed according to the final JMF, using 50 gyrations of the Superpave gyratory
 compactor according to AASHTO T 312.
 The ME will test 2 specimens to verify that the final JMF produces a mixture that has a minimum void content as
 specified in Table 902.03.03-1. The ME will determine percent air voids according to AASHTO T 209, and either
 NJDOT B-6 or AASHTO TP 69.
 The ME will test 6 specimens according to AASHTO T 283, except for the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 No specific air void level is required.
 Compact specimens with 50 gyrations using the Superpave gyratory compactor.
 Apply a vacuum of 26 inches of mercury for 10 minutes to saturate the compacted specimen. No specific
 saturation level is required.
 Submerge the specimen in water during 1 freeze/thaw cycle.
 
 If the tensile strength ratio falls below 80 percent, adjust the mixture to satisfy the minimum requirement. Adjustments
 may include the use of anti-stripping agents.
 For MOGFC only, the ME will test 2 test specimens for abrasion and impact resistance using a modified L.A. Abrasion
 Test according to NJDOT B-8. The maximum allowable loss as calculated by this method is 30 percent.
 Do not modify the JMF unless the ME approves the modification.
 902.03.03 Sampling and Testing
 Perform and meet requirements for quality control testing as specified in 902.02.04.C.
 During production, the ME will take one random acceptance sample from each 500 tons of production to verify
 composition. Conduct air voids and draindown tests as directed by the ME.
 If the composition testing results are outside of the production control tolerances specified in Table 902.03.03-2 for an
 acceptance sample, determine if a plant adjustment is needed and immediately run a quality control sample. If the
 quality control sample is also outside of the control tolerances in Table 902.03.03-2, immediately take corrective action
 to bring the mix into compliance. Take additional quality control samples after the corrective action to ensure that the
 mix is within the production control tolerances. If 2 consecutive acceptance samples are outside the tolerances specified
 in Table 902.03.03-2, immediately stop production. Obtain ME approval of a plant correction plan before resuming
 production. Upon restarting production, do not transport mixture to the Project Limits before the results of a QC sample
 from the mixture indicate that the mixture meets JMF tolerances. The ME will reject mixture produced at initial
 restarting that does not meet tolerances.
 The ME will perform sampling according to NJDOT B-2 or ASTM D 3665, and will perform testing for composition
 according to AASHTO T 308 or NJDOT B-5. Perform testing for air voids and draindown according to NJDOT B-7 or
 NJDOT B-8.

 The ME will perform gradation testing according to AASHTO T 27 on the submitted aggregate sample. The ME will
 prepare the specimens for permeability testing according to AASHTO T 167. The ME will compact specimens at
 260 °F. The ME will determine permeability according to NJDOT B-1.
 At the ME’s option, verification may be done on an annual basis for a mix rather than on a project-to-project basis,
 provided the properties and proportions of the materials do not change. If written verification is submitted by the HMA
 supplier that the same source and character of materials are to be used, the ME may waive the requirement for the design
 and verification of previously approved mixes.
 902.06.03 Sampling and Testing
 Perform quality control testing as specified in 902.02.04.C.
 During production, the ME will take one random acceptance sample from each 600 tons of production to verify
 composition. Conduct draindown tests as directed by the ME.

 corrective action to bring the mix into compliance. Take additional quality control samples after the corrective action to
 ensure that the mix is within tolerances. If 2 consecutive acceptance samples are outside the tolerances specified in
 Table 902.06.01-1, immediately stop production. Obtain ME approval of a plant correction plan before resuming
 production. Upon restarting production, do not transport mixture to the Project before the results of a QC sample from
 the mixture indicate that the mixture meets JMF tolerances. The ME will reject mixture produced at initial restarting that
 does not meet tolerances.
 The ME will perform sampling according to NJDOT B-2 or ASTM D-3665 and will perform testing for composition
 according to AASHTO T 308 or NJDOT B-5. If directed by the ME, perform testing for draindown according to
 AASHTO T 305.

 corrosion of the reinforcement steel.
 Locate all bulk storage tanks for chemical admixtures inside a heated area with an ambient temperature of not less than
 32 °F. Do not use chemical admixtures that have been allowed to freeze until they have been agitated and retested.
 The ME may require certification from the manufacturer stating that the material is identical to that originally approved
 and has in no way been changed or altered. The ME will test for uniformity through the use of infrared
 spectrophotometry, pH values, specific gravity, and solids content.
 903.02.03 Mineral Admixtures
 A.
 
 Fly Ash. Ensure that fly ash for use as a pozzolan in concrete is listed on the QPL and conforms to ASTM C 618,
 Class C or Class F, except that the loss on ignition shall not exceed 3 percent. Use Class F fly ash to control alkalisilica reactivity.
 The supplier shall determine conformance to the requirements for loss on ignition and fineness for each truck load
 of fly ash delivered to the mixing site and shall include the test values on the delivery ticket.
 Submit certificate of compliance as specified in 106.07.
 
 B.

 QPL and conforms to the requirements of AASHTO M 302, Grade 120. The Contractor may use Grade 100 with
 the written permission of the ME.
 The Contractor may use slag as a replacement for cement as specified in 903.01, up to a maximum replacement
 level of 50 percent by weight of the total cementitious material. If more than 30 percent of cement is replaced, test
 the concrete mix design for scaling as specified in ASTM C 672, and ensure that it complies with a visual rating
 less than 3.
 Submit certificate of compliance, as specified in 106.07, indicating that the slag conforms to the requirements of
 AASHTO M 302, Grade 120.
 
 C.
 
 Silica Fume Admixture. Ensure that silica fume admixture for use in concrete is listed on the QPL and conforms
 to AASHTO M 307. Use only 1 brand of silica fume admixture for the entire duration of the Contract. The
 Contractor may supply silica fume admixture either in dry or in slurry form. If the slurry form is used, ensure that
 it is homogeneous and agitated to prevent separation.
 Submit certificate of compliance as specified in 106.07.
 
 903.02.04 Viscosity Modifying Admixture
 If needed for self-consolidating concrete, use a viscosity modifying admixture that is listed on the QPL and that, when
 evaluated according to the test methods and mix design proportions in AASHTO M 194, conforms to the following
 physical requirements:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 For initial and final set times, the allowable deviation of the test concrete from the reference concrete is not
 more than 1.0 hour earlier or 1.5 hours later.

 the reference concrete strength at 3, 7, and 28 days.
 The maximum allowable length change of the test concrete is 135 percent of the reference concrete.
 However, if the length change of the reference concrete is less than 0.030 percent, the maximum allowable
 length change of the test concrete is 0.010 percentage units more than the reference concrete.
 The minimum allowable relative durability factor of the test concrete is 80 percent.
 
 338
 
 903.02.05 Corrosion Inhibitor Admixture
 When required, use a calcium nitrite based corrosion inhibitor admixture to reduce the potential of corrosion of
 embedded steel. Use the following guidelines for calcium nitrite:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 6.
 
 Ensure that the calcium nitrite does not contact other admixtures before entering the concrete mix. Use air
 entraining, water reducing, and retarding admixtures that are compatible with the calcium nitrite solution.
 Thoroughly mix the calcium nitrite solution before incorporating it into the concrete mix.
 Strictly adhere to the manufacturer’s written recommendations regarding the use of the calcium nitrite
 admixture including storage, transportation, and method of mixing. The manufacturer of the calcium nitrite
 admixture shall have a representative available to assist the Contractor.
 The ME will test for the presence of the calcium nitrite admixture in the plastic concrete as specified in
 NJDOT C-3. Provide the test kit that is required to perform the plastic test to the ME.
 Use admixture that is 30 ± 2 percent calcium nitrite by weight of solution. Include a high range water
 reducing chemical admixture in the concrete when using a calcium nitrate admixture.
 Add the calcium nitrite at a rate of 3 gallons per cubic yard of concrete.
 Use a calcium nitrite admixture listed on the QPL.
 
 903.03 CONCRETE
 903.03.01 Composition
 Compose concrete of cement, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, admixtures, and water. Concrete may include fly ash,
 slag or silica fume. Provide materials as specified:
 Aggregates .......................................................................................................................................................... 901.06
 Cement ................................................................................................................................................................ 903.01
 Admixtures:
 Air-Entraining .............................................................................................................................................. 903.02.01
 Chemical ...................................................................................................................................................... 903.02.02
 Mineral......................................................................................................................................................... 903.02.03
 Corrosion Inhibitor....................................................................................................................................... 903.02.05
 Water................................................................................................................................................................... 919.08
 Use chemical admixtures according to the admixture manufacturer’s recommendation for the mix design and anticipated
 field conditions, including the admixture dosage rate and the location and method for introducing it into the mixture.
 If fly ash is added to control alkali-silica reactivity, use at least 15 percent fly ash by weight of the total cementitious
 material. If AASHTO T 303 testing results in an expansion greater than 0.40 percent, use at least 20 percent fly ash. If
 slag is used to control alkali-silica reactivity, use at least 25 percent slag by weight of the total cementitious material. If
 a low alkali cement is used to control alkali-silica reactivity, use cement with equivalent alkali of less than 0.60 percent.
 Use the combined weight of fly ash, slag, silica fume, and cement content to determine compliance with the minimum
 cement content and water-cement ratio requirements specified in Table 903.03.06-3. Include free water from the
 aggregates and the water in the admixtures and additives along with the mixing water when calculating the water-cement
 ratio.
 903.03.02 Mix Design and Verification
 Design at least 1 mix to equal or exceed the required verification strengths specified in Table 903.03.06-3 for each class
 of concrete included on the Project. A single mix design may satisfy the requirements for more than 1 class of concrete.
 Compute and set up the designs according to ACI Standard 211.1 or 211.2, as applicable.
 At least 45 days before the start of concrete placement, submit each mix design on concrete mix design forms provided
 by the ME. Identify the sources of materials and test data on the forms.
 The ME will be present at the time of verification batching to confirm that the proportions and ingredients batched are
 according to the proposed mix designs. If directed by the ME, mix at least 3 cubic yards of concrete in a central mix
 plant or transit truck for verification. The ME will direct that the verification batch be mixed in the top half of the
 allowable slump and air content ranges. Test for and report the slump and air content of the trial batch. The ME will
 reject the verification batch if the slump, air content, or yield is not acceptable. Prepare at least six 4 × 8-inch test
 339
 
 cylinders from each acceptable batch and cure according to AASHTO T 23 or AASHTO R 39. Between 2 and 5 days
 after molding, deliver the cylinders to the ME for testing. The ME will test 3 cylinders at 7 days and 3 cylinders at 28
 days to determine the 7-day and 28-day compressive strengths, respectively.
 At the ME’s option, verification may be done on an annual basis for a concrete plant rather than on a project-to-project
 basis, provided the properties and proportions of the materials do not change. If the Contractor submits written
 verification that the same source and character of materials are to be used, the ME may waive the requirement for the
 design and verification of previously approved mixes.
 Provide concrete conforming to the approved mix design. If using a previously approved mix design, notify the ME at
 least 1 day before making the change. Do not change the source, type, or proportions of materials until approved and the
 requirements for design and verification have been satisfied.
 903.03.03 Mixing for Central-Plant and Transit Mixing
 A.
 
 Handling, Measuring, and Batching Materials. Mix concrete at a concrete plant that is listed on the QPL and
 conforms to the requirements specified in 1010.01. Ensure that the plant’s location, layout, equipment, and
 provisions for transporting material will ensure a continuous supply of concrete to the work.
 Stockpile aggregates as specified in 901.02. Separately weigh the fine aggregate and each size of coarse aggregate
 into hoppers according to the amounts in the job mix design.
 Measure cement by weight, using separate scales and hoppers with a device to indicate the complete discharge of
 the batch of cement into the batch box or container. Ensure that the weighing hopper and scale are of adequate
 size, completely encased, and have provisions for locking. Operate the weighing hopper discharge gate so as to not
 affect the scale balance. Suspend the discharge chute, boot, or other such device from the encasement, not from the
 weighing hopper. Discharge the cement so that it does not lodge in the weighing hopper and there is no loss of
 cement by air currents. Ensure that the required cement content is added to each batch.
 Store mineral admixtures, unless pre-blended cement is supplied, at the batching plant in a separate storage facility.
 Batch mineral admixtures to tolerances equivalent to those specified for cement. When mineral admixtures are
 weighed cumulatively with the cement, add the mineral admixtures last in the batching sequence.
 When silica fume and dyes are added, demonstrate, prior to production, that the batching sequence will produce a
 uniform mix. If using mineral admixtures packaged in bags, empty the bag into the mix. Do not put degradable
 bags in the mix.
 Add chemical, air-entraining, and corrosion inhibiting admixtures to the mixing water or sand. Use a water
 measuring device that automatically registers and stops the flow of the water when the designated quantity has been
 delivered into the mixing drum.
 
 B.
 
 Batch Tolerances. For individual batches, conform to the following tolerances based on the required scale
 reading:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 
 C.
 
 Cement and Mineral Admixtures: ±1.0 percent of the required weight of material or ±0.3 percent of scale
 capacity, whichever is greater.
 Aggregates 1-1/2 inches or smaller: ±2.0 percent of the required weight of material or ±0.3 percent of the
 scale capacity, whichever is greater.
 Aggregates larger than 1-1/2 inches: ±3.0 percent of the required weight of material or ±0.3 percent of
 scale capacity, whichever is greater.
 Water: ±1.0 percent of the required weight of material.
 Chemical, Air-entraining, and Corrosion Inhibiting Admixtures: ±3.0 percent of the required weight of
 material or ±1 ounce, whichever is greater.
 
 Delivery Tickets. Supply a delivery ticket for each load of concrete. Ensure that the delivery ticket contains the
 following information:
 1.
 2.
 
 Use tickets that are serially numbered and bear the printed heading of the supplier and the location of the
 batch plant.
 Show the name of the Project, the name of the Contractor, the quantity and class of concrete, the batch
 time as imprinted on the ticket by an automatic clock, the date, and the truck number.
 
 340
 
 3.
 4.
 
 After the truck has been discharged, fill in the time when the concrete was completely discharged, the
 amount of mixing water and the amount of tempering water, if used, and the total number of mixing
 revolutions for transit mix.
 An authorized representative of the supplier shall sign each ticket and give copies to the ME and the RE.
 
 In addition, for each truck or batch, provide a batching ticket to the ME, indicating the amount, brand name, and
 type of cementitious material; the amount and source of the fine aggregate; the amount, sizes, and sources of the
 coarse aggregates; the amount of mixing water; and the amounts, brand names, and types of admixtures.
 D.
 
 Mixing Requirements. Do not allow the elapsed time from batching to the discharge of all the concrete from the
 mixer to exceed 90 minutes, except that under conditions contributing to quick stiffening of the concrete or when
 the temperature of the concrete is above 85 °F, the time limit is changed to 60 minutes. Under very severe
 conditions, the RE may further reduce the time limits. Measure batching time from the time cement is introduced
 to the mixer.
 If the concrete cannot be entirely discharged within 10 minutes, keep the concrete in the drum plastic and workable
 by revolving the truck drum at the manufacturer’s designated speed for agitation for at least 2 minutes in each
 10 minute period.
 Use one of the following mixing methods unless mixing on the Project as specified in 903.03.04:
 1.
 
 Mixing at a Central-Mixing Plant. For central-mix concrete, proportion and mix concrete at a central plant
 and transport to the point of use in an agitator approved by the ME. If approved by the ME, non-agitating
 vehicles may be used to transport concrete at precast/prestressed concrete fabricators. Use central-mixing
 plant mixers that are of the type and capacity capable of combining the required materials into a thoroughly
 mixed and uniform mass within the specified mixing time and of discharging the mixture with a satisfactory
 degree of uniformity. Operate the plant according to N.J.A.C 7:27-6.1 et seq.
 Mix for at least 1 minute, with mixing time measured from the time all cement and aggregates are in the drum.
 Charge the batch into the mixer so that sufficient water enters in advance of cement and aggregates to prevent
 caking. Ensure that all water is in the drum by the end of the first quarter of the mixing time.
 When the temperature of the mixing water exceeds 100 °F, modify the loading sequence by mixing all the
 water and the aggregates and then the cement. Begin mixing immediately following the complete charging of
 the drum, and continue for not less than 1 minute.
 Restrict the volume of mixed concrete in the agitating truck to not exceed the manufacturer’s rating or
 80 percent of the gross drum volume, whichever is less.
 Before acceptance testing, the Contractor may add mixing water, air entraining agent, or chemical admixture
 incrementally in order to achieve the proper slump or air content range as specified in Table 903.03.06-1 or
 Table 903.03.06-2.
 
 2.
 
 Transit Mixing. For transit mix concrete, proportion materials, including water, into a truck mixer from a 1stop or 2-stop batching plant and mix in the truck. A one-stop batching plant is a plant where the dry
 ingredients for each batch of concrete are loaded into the mixer truck while water is being introduced. A 2stop batching plant is a plant where the ingredients for each batch of concrete are loaded into the mixer truck
 at 2 separate locations.
 When loaded for mixing concrete, restrict the volume of concrete to no more than 63 percent of the gross
 drum volume of the transit truck mixer.
 Immediately begin mixing after the complete charging of the drum and continue for not less than 50 or more
 than 100 revolutions of the drum at the mixing speed recommended by the manufacturer of the transit truck
 mixer. After completing the minimum number of mixing revolutions at the plant, reduce the speed of the
 drum to the agitation speed recommended by the manufacturer. When using Type F or G admixtures, mix the
 load at the minimum specified number of mixing revolutions as recommended by the manufacturer.
 Before acceptance testing, the Contractor may add mixing water, air entraining agent, or chemical admixture
 incrementally in order to achieve the proper slump or air content range as specified in Table 903.03.06-1 or
 Table 903.03.06-2.
 
 341
 
 E.
 
 Rejection Criteria. The RE will reject concrete for any of the following reasons:
 1.
 
 The information for batching and delivery tickets is not complete, does not agree with the mix design, or
 is not supplied to the ME.
 2. The mixer fails to maintain the manufacturer’s stated speed of rotation for both mixing and agitation, or
 is not able to properly discharge the concrete.
 3. The RE observes improper batching, lack of uniform distribution of constituents throughout the load, or
 balling of the cement and aggregates.
 4. Water has been added while the truck is en route to the work site.
 5. The concrete is not discharged within the specified time limit, or if the revolution counter shows a total
 of more than the 300 revolutions. However, if the load has been partially discharged and if the concrete
 yet to be discharged conforms to the specified ranges for slump and entrained air without further
 addition of water or admixtures, then the RE may allow the use of the concrete.
 6. The slump or air content does not comply with requirements specified in 903.03.05.C.
 7. The concrete has been tempered after the ME has performed the final acceptance testing.
 8. Water is added after the truck has partially discharged regardless of ME testing.
 9. The indicator on the revolution counter shows that the instrument has been turned off or tampered with.
 10. The temperature of the concrete does not comply with requirements.
 11. The water-cement ratio of the load is greater than the allowable maximum water-cement ratio for the
 class of concrete.
 903.03.04 Mixing on the Project
 A.
 
 Mobile Mixers. Mix the concrete in a mixing unit that is part of the truck carrying the dry ingredients and
 conforms to the requirements for a mobile mixer as specified in 1010.03. Use a mixing unit that is an auger type
 incorporated in the truck’s discharge chute or other approved mixing mechanism. Produce concrete of uniform
 consistency and discharge the mix without segregation.
 Provide a means for storing the additives on the truck and incorporating them into the mix. Include a way to check
 the rate of flow of the additive into the mix and a meter to register the total volume of additive incorporated into the
 mix during each mixing operation. The ME will not allow use of trucks not having functional meters on the
 Project.
 Handle, measure, and batch materials according to the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 B.
 
 Stockpile aggregates as specified in 901.02.
 Proportion, measure, and batch cement and aggregates by a volumetric weight equivalent method. Mix
 the materials in the continuous-mixing-type truck mixer.
 Provide delivery tickets to the ME for each truckload of ingredients. On the delivery tickets, show the
 brand name and type of cement, the calibrated cement constant of the mixer in terms of the indicator
 revolution count, the source of aggregates, and the size of the coarse aggregate. A responsible officer or
 employee of the concrete supplier shall sign the delivery tickets. For each class of concrete and for each
 separate mixing operation, the mixer operator shall enter on the tickets the name of the Project, the name
 of the Contractor, the revolution counter indicator readings indicating the volumetric weight equivalent
 of cement discharged during that mixing operation, the concrete additive meter reading indicating the
 total volume of additive discharged into the mix during that mixing operation, the aggregate dial
 settings, the water and concrete additive flow rates, and the class of concrete delivered. The operator
 shall sign each completed ticket and provide a copy to the ME.
 
 Small Mixers. With the RE’s approval, use small mixers only for small quantities of concrete that must be mixed
 on the Project. Unless provisions are made for accurately weighing bulk cement, use full bags of cement in each
 batch. Only use pre-blended mineral admixtures. Proportion aggregates and water by weight unless a calibrated
 volumetric method has been approved by the RE. Use accurate volumetric measuring devices to proportion
 chemical and air-entraining admixtures.
 Charge the mixer with the aggregates and part of the mixing water, and begin mixing. Add cement and admixtures
 with another portion of the mixing water. Mix until uniform. Temper with the remaining allowable mixing water
 to obtain the necessary consistency. Do not exceed the quantity of water required by the mix design.

 Use 4 × 8-inch (diameter × height) compression test cylinders, except use 6 × 12-inch (diameter × height) test cylinders for
 concrete mixes containing coarse aggregate sizes exceeding a nominal maximum size of 1 inch.
 Cure compression test cylinders for strength acceptance according to the Standard Cure Method in AASHTO T 23. For
 determining early strength for form removal, early loading of members, or opening to traffic, cure compression test
 cylinders according to the Field Cure Method in AASHTO T 23.
 Obtain and prepare cores for compressive strength testing according to AASHTO T 24, except for the provisions for
 moisture conditioning. For moisture conditioning, soak cores in a lime bath at 73.4 ± 3 °F for at least 40 hours immediately
 prior to testing. After making any necessary corrections to the core results for ratio, the ME will divide each core result by
 0.85 before reporting the final compressive strength.
 Sample according to AASHTO T 141, except do not take a composite sample to represent a truck. Take the sample after
 approximately 1 cubic yard of concrete has been discharged from the truck to be sampled.
 The Department may modify the sampling rate for individual and composite samples.
 
 Quality Control. The concrete supplier shall have a quality control plan approved annually by the ME. The
 producer shall ensure that the plan conforms to the “Requirements for a Portland Cement Concrete Plant Quality
 Control Plan”, which may be obtained from the ME. During production of concrete for the Project, the supplier
 shall perform quality control testing as required in the approved plan. If a concrete supplier does not have an
 approved plan or does not follow the approved plan, the ME will remove the supplier from the QPL.
 Ensure that the QC technician, certified by ACI as a Concrete Field Technician, Grade 1, is present at the plant or
 the Project Limits during production. During production of concrete for the Project, perform quality control testing
 as required in the approved plan and as needed to ensure compliance with the requirements for the concrete.
 
 C.
 
 Acceptance Testing Procedures for Slump and Air Entrainment. The ME will perform sampling and testing
 for slump (AASHTO T 119) and air entrainment (AASHTO T 152 or T 196), except for precast, prestressed
 concrete Items, for which the Contractor shall perform sampling and testing for slump and air entrainment. For
 pumped concrete, take the sample of concrete at the point of discharge and deliver it to the ME.
 At a minimum, the ME will perform slump and air-entrainment tests at the rate specified for strength tests in Table
 903.03.06-4 and on the same samples of material from which the compressive tests cylinders are molded. The ME
 will perform additional slump and air-entrainment tests as necessary to ensure the quality of the concrete. While
 these tests are being performed, halt discharge from the truck. Discharge from other trucks not scheduled for
 testing may proceed unless otherwise directed by the ME.
 
 343
 
 If the measured value of either slump or air entrainment exceeds the upper limit, the ME will perform a second test
 on a different portion of material from the same load. If the average of the 2 test results for either slump or air
 entrainment exceeds the upper limit, the ME will reject the load. Remove rejected loads from the Project Limits.
 If neither of the measured values of the slump or air entrainment exceeds the upper limit, the Contractor may
 temper the concrete once, prior to discharge into the work. Temper by addition of water, air entraining agent, or
 any chemical admixture included in the mix design as recommended by the manufacturer. Ensure that quantities
 added will result in slump and percent air entrainment within the specified ranges throughout the duration of
 discharge of the load. After tempering, rotate the drum at the recommended mixing speed for a minimum of 30
 revolutions. Meet the specified maximum water-cement ratio and comply with the time and revolution limits
 specified in 903.03.03. Report quantities added to the ME.
 Following any allowed tempering, the ME will disregard the original test results and perform a single test for slump
 and air entrainment. If the measured values for slump and air-content are not within the ranges specified in Table
 903.03.06-1 or Table 903.03.06-2, the RE will reject the load of concrete.
 Do not make additions to the load after the acceptance testing has been completed. For loads not scheduled for
 acceptance testing, make additions as specified in 903.03.03 before discharge into the work.
 D.
 
 General Acceptance Testing Requirements for Strength. The ME will perform sampling and testing for
 strength, except for precast, prestressed concrete Items for which the Contractor shall perform sampling and testing
 for strength. For pumped concrete, take the sample of concrete at the point of discharge and deliver it to the ME.
 Provide, for the sole use of the ME, a sufficient number of curing facilities for the storage and curing of concrete
 test cylinders within the Project Limits for the first 24 hours according to AASHTO T 23. Ensure that the curing
 facilities are provided with minimum-maximum thermometers and are securable with lock and key. During the
 period from May 1 through October 31, provide water tanks or tubs of sufficient capacity and rigidity to hold the
 cylinders in an upright position, fully submerged and without contact between cylinders. During the remaining
 months of the year, or as directed by the RE, provide securable, insulated boxes, of similar capacity and rigidity.
 During the initial 24 hours, ensure that the test specimens are undisturbed and maintained within the specified
 temperature range. If, within 10 days of the RE’s request, the facilities are not provided, do not place any concrete.
 The ME will cure concrete test specimens that are to be used for determination of early strengths for removing
 forms, opening to traffic, or otherwise placing the concrete into service according to the field curing provisions in
 AASHTO T 23.
 An initial strength test result is defined as the average strength of two 4 × 8-inch compression test cylinders, cured
 for 28 days, and tested by the ME. The Contractor may have cylinders for precast concrete tested at the fabricator’s
 plant under the supervision of the ME. The ME will sample and test at the rate specified in Table 903.03.06-4. If
 either of the cylinders comprising a test shows definite evidence (other than low strength) of improper sampling,
 molding, handling, curing, or testing, the ME will discard it and use the strength of the remaining cylinder as the
 test result. If the difference in compressive strength between 2 cylinders comprising a test equals or exceeds 600
 pounds per square inch, the ME will disregard the lower value and use the higher value as the test result. If both
 cylinders comprising a test are discarded, the ME will evaluate the lot on the basis of the reduced number of tests.
 If the ME takes additional unscheduled compression cylinders, as specified in 106.05, the ME will include the
 results with the regularly scheduled compression cylinder results and will evaluate the lot on the basis of the
 increased number of tests.
 
 E.
 
 Acceptance Testing for Strength for Pay-Adjustment Items. The Special Provisions will identify the concrete
 Items, if any, that are subject to pay adjustment and their base prices.
 The ME will test the cylinders in the lot of concrete and compute the pay adjustment in the following steps:
 1.
 
 Compute Average Lot Strength (ALS) and Standard Deviation (S). If only a single test result is available,
 the standard deviation (S) is assumed to equal 200 pounds per square inch.
 
 344
 
 ALS =
 
 ∑ Xi
 N
 
 ∑( X i − ALS)2
 N -1
 
 S =
 
 Where:
 ∑ = Summation
 Xi = Individual test result (average strength of a test cylinder pair)
 N = Number of test results for the lot
 
 2.
 
 Compute Quality Index (Q).
 Q =
 
 ALS − CDS
 S
 
 Where:
 CDS = Class design strength in pounds per square inch from Table 903.03.06-3 for the specified class of concrete.
 
 3.
 
 Determine Percent Defective (PD). Using NJDOT ST for the appropriate sample size, the ME will
 determine PD associated with Q calculated in the previous step.
 
 4.
 
 Compute Percent Pay Adjustment (PPA).
 Equation 1
 Equation 2
 
 Quality
 
 Percent Pay Adjustment
 
 PD < 50
 
 PPA = 3.0 − 0.3 PD
 
 PD ≥ 50
 
 PPA = 26.0 − 0.76 PD
 
 The amount of pay-adjustment in dollars is the product of the Item base price times the lot quantity times the
 percent pay-adjustment (expressed as a decimal) given by Equation 1 or 2.
 For lots having percent defective (PD) levels less than 10 percent, Equation 1 provides positive adjustments to
 the contract price. For lots having exactly 10 percent defective, there is no adjustment to the contract price.
 For lots having greater than 10 percent defective, Equations 1 or 2, as appropriate, subtract progressively
 larger amounts from the contract price.
 If, based on the initial series of tests, the lot quality of a pay-adjustment item is estimated to be PD = 50 or
 greater, the ME may reevaluate by coring or other suitable means. When this provision is applied to
 precast/prestressed concrete, the ME will evaluate each item in the bed separately.
 If the re-evaluation is accomplished by a method other than coring, the ME will use the results only to
 determine what further action is to be taken. If all non-core test results equal or exceed the class design
 strength, the ME may elect to accept the lot at 100 percent payment.
 If the Department elects not to core, the Contractor may accept the PPA calculated by Equation 1 or 2, as
 appropriate, or, when approved by the Department, the Contractor may take cores as specified in Table
 903.03.06-4. Take the cores within 90 days from the date of concrete placement. If electing to core, perform
 the coring as directed by the ME, and provide the cores to the ME for testing.
 If cores are taken, the Department will use the core results to determine the final disposition of the lot. If,
 based on the core results, the lot is determined to be at a quality level of PD < 75, the Department will
 compute the pay-adjustment by Equation 1 or 2, as appropriate. If the lot is confirmed to be at a quality level
 of PD ≥ 75, the ME will reject the lot and the RE may do one of the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 F.
 
 Require the Contractor to remove and replace the defective lot.
 Allow the Contractor to leave the defective lot in place and receive a PPA computed by Equation 2.
 Allow the Contractor to submit a plan, to the RE for approval, for corrective action.
 
 Acceptance Testing for Strength for Non-Pay-Adjustment Items. Non-pay-adjustment Items are those concrete
 Items not specifically designated as pay-adjustment Items, as specified in 903.03.05.E, but may be accepted by payadjustment under certain circumstances. Such an item is eligible for 100 percent payment (PPA = 0) if each
 individual test result in a lot meets the retest limit specified in Table 903.03.06-4.
 
 345
 
 If any individual test value (average of a cylinder pair) falls below the retest limit for non-pay-adjustment concrete
 in Table 903.03.06-4, the ME may reevaluate by coring or other suitable means. When this provision is applied to
 precast/prestressed concrete, the ME will evaluate each item in the bed separately.
 If the re-evaluation is accomplished by a method other than coring, the ME will use the results only to determine
 what further action is to be taken. If all non-core test results equal or exceed the class design strength, the ME may
 elect to accept the lot at 100 percent payment.
 If the Department elects not to core, the Department may allow the Contractor to take cores as specified in Table
 903.03.06-4. Take the cores within 90 days from the date of concrete placement. If electing to core, perform the
 coring as directed by the ME, and provide the cores to the ME for testing.
 If cores are taken, the Department will use the core results to determine the final disposition of the lot. If, based on
 the core results, the lot is determined to be at a quality level of PD < 75, the Department will compute the payadjustment as specified in 903.03.05.E. If the lot is confirmed to be at a quality level of PD ≥ 75, the ME will
 reject the lot and the RE may do one of the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 Require the Contractor to remove and replace the defective lot
 Allow the Contractor to leave the defective lot in place and receive a PPA computed by Equation 2.
 Allow the Contractor to submit a plan, for approval, for corrective action.
 
 If retesting is not performed by the Department or the Contractor, the Department will calculate the PPA as for a
 pay-adjustment item as specified in 903.03.05.E, except that the Department will use the item bid price instead of
 an item base price in the computation of the pay-adjustment.
 When computing a pay-adjustment for any of the Items listed in Table 903.03.05-2, which are only partially
 composed of concrete, the ME will multiply the amount of pay-adjustment, if any, by the Estimated Percentage of
 Concrete (expressed as a decimal) as shown in Table 903.03.05-2.

 Produce HPC conforming to the composition requirements specified in 903.03.01, except for the following:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 
 When using more than 1 admixture, ensure that they are compatible. If using admixtures from different
 manufacturers, submit letters from each manufacturer certifying that their admixtures are compatible with all
 others in the mix design.
 Pozzalonic material maximum percentage limitations specified in 903.01 and 903.02.03 are waived for HPC
 mix designs.
 In the design of HPC, in order to achieve the desired resistance to chloride penetration, provide an appropriate
 pozzalonic or other cementitious material, such as silica fume, fly ash, or slag in the mix design.
 Do not use silica fume as a sole material to achieve the desired resistance to chlorides. Do not use more than
 5 percent of silica fume by weight of the total cementitious material. If using fly ash in conjunction with
 silica fume, use 10 to 15 percent fly ash by weight of the total cementitious materials. If using slag in
 conjunction with silica fume, use up to 40 percent slag by weight of the total cementitious materials.
 
 903.05.02 Mix Design and Verification
 Design an HPC mix that conforms to the requirements in Table 903.05.02-1. Submit a report documenting these results
 to the ME. Obtain the results of these standard tests from an AASHTO accredited testing agency that is accredited for
 the test being performed. Design mixes according to the HPC-1 criteria for use in bridge decks, parapets, and bridge
 sidewalks. Design mixes meeting the HPC-2 criteria for use in pier column protection.

 903.05.03 Mixing
 Mix HPC concrete as specified in 903.03.03. During production, do not change the components of the mix in any way
 from the approved mix design. If the components must be changed, redesign and re-verify the mix.
 903.05.04 Control and Acceptance Testing Requirements
 With the exception that the ME may perform compression testing at 56 days, the ME will enforce the requirements
 specified in 903.03.05 for control and acceptance testing of non-pay adjustment Class A concrete in the fabrication of the

 If using a Type F or G admixture, change the Slump and Air Content values for the HPC as follows:
 1.1 Slump: 6 ± 2 inches
 1.2 Air Content: increase both the target value and tolerance percentages by 0.5
 For slip-formed parapet, design and produce a mix with a slump of 1 ± 1/2 inch.
 The ME will not test for the chloride permeability requirements for HPC used for Items other than bridge decks.
 For chloride permeability testing, the ME will mold 4 additional cylinders, taking 2 cylinders each from 2 randomly selected
 delivery trucks for testing at 28-day and 56-day intervals.
 For compressive strength testing, the initial rate for the HPC is 6 per lot. The retest limit is 4400 pounds per square inch.
 
 The ME will test 2 specimens for chloride permeability and will average the results of the 2 specimens to determine the
 test result. The ME will perform 2 tests on each lot from samples taken from 2 randomly selected delivery trucks. The
 lot is eligible for 100 percent payment provided that the test results are equal to or below 2000 coulombs.
 Whenever 1 or more individual test results exceed 2,000 coulombs at 28 days, the ME will re-evaluate the lot at the same
 testing rate at 56 days. If, upon testing at 56 days, 1 or more individual test results exceed 2000 coulombs, the RE may:

 903.07 QUICK-SETTING PATCH MATERIALS
 Use quick-setting patch material that is listed on the QPL and is ready for mixing according to the manufacturer’s
 recommendations. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations regarding the required water demand for the patching
 material. Use patching material that is concrete gray in color and contains no calcium chloride or other ingredients that
 cause corrosion to steel reinforcement. If adding coarse aggregate to patching material, use broken stone conforming to
 901.03.01. Ensure that the material is quick-setting for use in concrete patching where fast setting, rapid strength gain,
 non-shrink, and high bond strength characteristics are needed. The ME will add products to the QPL only after testing
 and evaluation in the field, after service for 1 year.
 The classifications for quick-setting patch materials are as follows:
 1.
 
 Type 1. Suitable for use above water. Type 1 products are used neat or with up to 15 pounds of coarse
 aggregate size No. 8 added to a 50-pound bag of material. The ME will test the patch material neat. At the
 work site, the Contractor may add up to 15 pounds of coarse aggregate size No. 8 to a 50-pound bag of the
 patch material to increase yield, provided that the product properties are not adversely affected.
 
 2.
 
 Type 1A. Suitable for use above water. Type 1A products have manufacturer specified mix proportions with
 aggregates that would preclude it from being classified as a Type 1. The ME will approve the mix proportions
 before adding the material to the QPL. The manufacturer shall provide mixing proportions, including the
 required type and size of aggregate and the proportion of patching material, aggregate/sand, and water. At
 least 10 days before the start of placement, propose aggregates for verification trial batching based on the
 manufacturer’s pre-approved proportions. The ME will verify that the proposed quick setting patch mixture
 meets the required physical properties.
 
 3.
 
 Type 1B. Suitable for use above water. Type 1B products are those products that have course aggregate,
 sand, or both pre-packaged with the cementitious material. The ME will test this material, including a field
 trial, prior to adding it to the QPL. The manufacturer shall designate the amount of aggregate and shall
 maintain the total aggregate within ±10 percent of this stated amount. The ME will randomly test the
 
 353
 
 aggregate to ensure that the overall percentage of aggregate is within ±10 percent of the total and that the
 gradation on individual sieves does not vary more than ±10 percent from the gradation of the originally
 approved sample. The manufacturer shall use an aggregate supplier that is listed on the QPL. The ME will
 disapprove quick-setting patch material that fails to comply with the aggregate consistency requirements. If
 the manufacturer makes any changes to the formulation, the ME will require that the material be resubmitted
 for approval. Do not add additional aggregate in the field.
 4.
 
 Type 2. Suitable for vertical and overhead repairs that are not formed and poured. The ME will test the patch
 material neat.
 
 If liquid activator, other additives, adhesive, or bonding agents are integral to the performance of the patch material, the
 manufacturer shall provide the material so that 1 package of additive, activator, adhesive or bonding agent is required for
 1 package of patch material. Mix patch material as specified in 903.03.04.
 Use quick setting patch material that meets the requirements in Table 903.07-1 when tested according to NJDOT C-2.
 Mix quick-setting patch according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

 In the construction of prestressed concrete I-beams or prestressed concrete slab and box beams, when the use of
 galvanized reinforcement steel is planned for the deck construction, galvanize all reinforcement steel that will provide
 composite action.
 For prestressed concrete piles in a marine environment, use grit impregnated epoxy-coated prestressing steel strands as
 specified in 905.02. When storing, cover the strands with an opaque polyethylene sheeting or other suitable protective
 material to protect the reinforcement from exposure to sunlight, salt spray, and weather. For stacked bundles, drape the
 protective covering around the perimeter of the stack. Adequately secure the covering; however, allow air circulation to
 prevent condensation under the covering. Do not store epoxy-coated prestressing steel within 1000 feet of ocean or tidal
 water for more than 2 months.
 904.04.02 Fabrication
 Fabricate prestressed concrete at a plant as specified in 1011.02. Provide an office for the ME as specified in 1011.03.
 1.
 
 Placing Reinforcement and Prestressing Steel. Store reinforcement above ground, and cover strand packs
 when not in use. Place reinforcement steel as specified in 504.03.01 and as shown in the working drawings.
 Position or loosely tie reinforcement steel until prestressing strands have been positioned. After pre-stressing,
 firmly tie the reinforcement prior to placing concrete.
 If using an anti-bonding agent on the forms to facilitate their removal, protect the prestressing strands against
 contamination by the anti-bonding agent. Use supports, spaced a maximum of 10 feet apart, to support
 bottom strands and side reinforcement steel. If necessary, provide horizontal and vertical spacers to hold the
 wires in place in the enclosures.
 
 2.
 
 Prestressing. Provide protection, for the ME inspecting the prestressing operation, adequate to stop a flying
 strand. Use shields, placed at both ends of the bed, made of steel, reinforced concrete, heavy timbers, or other
 material to provide protection acceptable to the ME.
 Apply stress to each cable as shown on the working drawings using either the single strand or the multi-strand
 jacking method.
 If performing prestressing by the multi-strand jacking method, bring the individual strands to a uniform initial
 tension before applying the full pretensioning. Measure the initial tension of each strand using a
 dynamometer, a gauge, or other such means. After the initial tensioning, stress the strands until the specified
 elongation and jacking pressure are attained.
 If performing prestressing by the single strand jacking method, do not construct more than 1 splice per strand.
 When multi-strand jacking is used, either splice all strands or splice no more than 10 percent of the strands.
 Ensure that spliced strands are similar in physical properties, are from the same source, and have the same
 twist or lay. Position splices outside of the prestressed members. Do not torch cut the ends of the strand
 lengths to be spliced.
 For prestressing draped strands, apply stress by either partially jacking at the end of the bed, followed by
 raising or lowering the strands to their final position, or entirely by the jacking operation. Regardless of the
 method of prestressing, use low-friction devices at all points of slope change in the strand trajectory. If the
 strands are tensioned in their draped position, support the strands using lubricated rollers with bronze bushings
 or roller bearings at all hold-up points, and low-friction, free-turning rollers at all hold-down points. When
 strands are deflected after partial tensioning, simultaneously raise or depress the strands at all points or in an
 approved specified sequence.
 Replace broken strands if the allowable number of wire breaks specified in Table 904.04.02-1 is exceeded.
 Locate and tie wire breaks directly to the strand to prevent raveling during the vibration of the concrete.

 1.
 
 Replace the strand if more than 1 break occurs in an individual strand.
 
 If concrete is not placed within 72 hours of prestressing, the ME may require the bed to be checked for proper
 stresses before placement of concrete.
 After final stressing, position strands and uniformly distribute the stress in the strands throughout the bed
 length.
 3.
 
 Placing Concrete. Before placing concrete, ensure that the prestressing is acceptable to the ME and that
 reinforcement and any other embedded materials are free of loose rust, frost, dirt, oil, or contaminants that
 may prevent a bond with the concrete. Place concrete as specified in 504.03.02.D and 504.03.02.E.
 Consolidate concrete with internal vibrators. The fabricator may use external vibration to supplement internal
 vibration. Only place concrete in the presence of, or as directed by, the ME.
 For prestressed concrete box beams, place voids in the forms after the ME has inspected the concrete poured
 to encase the strands in the bottom portion of the beam.
 
 4.
 
 Fabrication Requirements. Fabricate the prestressed concrete members to plan dimensions within the
 tolerances specified in applicable sections of PCI MNL-116. The ME will reject members having dimensions
 outside the tolerance limits, unless the Contractor performs corrective measures. Obtain approval from the
 Department before taking any corrective measures. Adhere to beam camber tolerances so that preformed
 transverse tie holes for prestressed box and slab beams line up correctly during erection, facilitating the
 placement of transverse ties.
 Cast a permanent, unique, identification mark and the date of the casting in the top of members. Upon
 removal of the forms, mark the ends of members with the same identification marking.
 
 5.
 
 Detensioning. Do not detension the bridge members until the strength tests indicate that the concrete has
 reached a compressive strength of at least 4000 pounds per square inch for Class P, 4500 pounds per square
 inch for Class P-1, and 5000 pounds per square inch for Class P-2 concrete.
 Before detensioning, submit to the ME a plan for the pattern and schedule for releasing the strands. Strip or
 loosen forms that may tend to restrict the horizontal or vertical movement of the member.
 For detensioning, use either the multiple strand release method or the single strand release method.
 If the multiple strand method of release is used, gradually and simultaneously release all of the strands or a
 symmetrical group of strands. Transfer the load on the strands from the anchorage to the jacking system.
 Gradually release the jack or jacks until the strands are relaxed.
 For the single strand release method, detension the strands in the sequence of the pattern and schedule of
 release by slow-heat cutting. Use a low-oxygen flame applied along the strand for a minimum of 5 inches
 until the metal gradually loses its strength. Apply the heat at a rate to induce failure of the first wire in the
 strand at least 5 seconds after the heat is applied.
 The ME will reject pieces if the fabricator fails to follow the detensioning procedure.
 
 904.04.03 Curing
 Cure as specified in 904.01.03, except that the required stripping strength is 4000 pounds per square inch for Class P,
 4500 pounds per square inch for Class P-1, and 5000 pounds per square inch for Class P-2 concrete. In addition, when
 the ambient air temperature is above 100 °F, initiate a water cure or other approved method as soon as the concrete is
 able to receive the water without physical damage to its surface. The fabricator may discontinue this cure upon
 introduction of steam, provided that a relative humidity of 100 percent is maintained.
 
 362
 
 904.04.04 Removing Forms and Finishing
 Do not remove side forms until the strength of 2 cylinders, similarly cured as the member, achieves at least 2500 pounds
 per square inch. Do not move the member from the bottom forms before detensioning.
 Upon the removal of forms, the ME may reject any member that has 1 prestressing strand exposed for a length in excess
 of 24 diameters, or 2 or more strands visually exposed. In addition, the ME may reject any unit that is honeycombed to
 such an extent that chipping away from honeycombed concrete results in the conditions described for exposed strands. If
 the ME determines that the defective areas can be repaired, submit a repair procedure to the ME for approval. Perform
 approved patching before detensioning.
 Provide a Class 1 finish, as specified in 504.03.02.H.1, on formed surfaces of the concrete members. For surfaces of
 concrete exposed to view in the finished structure, perform additional finishing by rubbing mortar on the surface using
 burlap. Ensure that the rubbing produces a smooth surface of uniform color and texture. Transversely score the top
 surface of members using a stiff wire brush. After the removal of hold-down devices from the bottom of the beams, coat
 the resulting holes with an epoxy bonding compound, and plug the holes with mortar while the epoxy bonding
 compound is still tacky. If the epoxy bonding compound dries out before the placement of the mortar, sandblast the area
 and reapply the bonding compound. Patch vent holes for box beams upon removal from forms after the internal void
 drains are opened.
 Treat portions of prestressed concrete beams as shown on the Plans with an epoxy waterproofing. Do not apply the
 epoxy waterproofing to the top surface of a beam. Use an epoxy waterproofing that closely matches the color of the
 concrete. Do not apply the epoxy waterproofing sooner than 72 hours after detensioning. Ensure that the concrete
 surface is dry and clean of oil, grease, and dirt before applying the coating. Apply the epoxy waterproofing by brush
 only, unless otherwise approved by the ME. Ensure that the epoxy waterproofing is applied uniformly and provides
 adequate coverage.
 904.04.05 Shipping and Handling
 The fabricator may handle members immediately after completion of detensioning. Before placing members in storage,
 ensure that surface finishing operations are completed and the member is approved by the ME. Do not remove a girder
 from the bed unless the differential between girder and air temperature is less than 80 °F. Before box and slab beams are
 moved to storage, inspect nonmetallic draining devices and open to provide for passage of water.
 Notify the ME at least 2 days before shipping. Do not ship until the class design strength as specified in Table
 903.03.06-3 has been attained and a minimum of 72 hours have elapsed following detensioning. Determine shipping
 strength by testing a complete set of cylinders that represent the lot of concrete and were cured with the item.
 Transport girders in an upright position. Ensure that the points of support and directions of the reactions with respect to
 the girder are approximately the same during transportation and storage as in its final erection position. Request the
 Department’s approval for transportation or storage of girders in any other position.
 904.04.06 Quality Control, Quality Assurance, and Acceptance Requirements
 Notify the ME in writing at least 21 days before start of production.
 For quality control, keep applicable records in conformance with PCI Division 1, Quality Control, or NPCA
 requirements, and supply copies of these records to the ME as requested. Ensure that the quality control technician
 performing all tests is certified as an ACI Field Testing Technician, Grade 1.
 During production, the ME will inspect the quality of materials and the process of manufacture. The ME will accept the
 concrete as specified in 903.03.05 and will inspect the finished pieces prior to shipping for dimensional tolerances and
 damage. If concrete is placed on the same bed at different times in the day, the ME will split the day’s production into
 separate lots. If the concrete member is spalled, honeycombed, chipped, or otherwise defective, the ME may reject the
 piece or approve repairs.

 galvanize as specified in 912.02.01.
 
 906.04.04 Shipping and Handling
 Notify the ME at least 3 days before shipping to the Project so that a final quality inspection can be performed. The ME
 will seal all materials approved for shipping and provide written approval to the fabricator.
 Ensure that members are loaded, hauled, and unloaded so that they are not deformed, damaged, or subjected to stresses
 in excess of those provided for in the design. When hauling and storing steel members, to the extent possible, place the
 members in a position similar to their final erected position.
 Ensure that all steel girders are shipped and stored with their webs vertical, unless their size precludes vertical shipment.
 Place points of bearing within 20 percent of the length of the girder from the ends, and secure with chain tie downs. If
 not provided for in the design, brace long members during shipment with temporary vertical stiffeners extending the full
 height of the web on both sides of the member. Place the temporary stiffeners at the bearing points, mid-span, and at
 additional locations to ensure that the maximum interval between bracing does not exceed 25 feet. Ensure that
 temporary stiffeners are in full contact with the web and both flanges. Pad the temporary stiffeners with a material that
 will minimize damage to the painted surface.
 For girders requiring shipment with their web horizontal, or for girders that will extend over 20 percent of the length
 beyond points of bearing, submit working drawings for approval. Include the following information:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 6.
 
 Drawings or sketches, fully describing the shipping and handling procedures.
 Calculations showing the dead load plus impact stresses induced by the loading and transportation procedure.
 Ensure that impact stresses do not exceed 200 percent of the dead load stress.
 Location of all support points.

 906.06.02 Surface Preparation
 Before blasting, remove any oil and grease, according to SSPC-SP 1, using No. 1 solvent. Reclean after blasting if
 contamination remains.
 Blast-clean all surfaces to a near-white condition, as defined in SSPC-SP 10. Ensure that the surface area of steel being
 blast cleaned is not greater than the surface area of steel that can be prime coated in the same day. If shot blast is used,
 use a NACE No. 2 Visual Standard T.M.-01-75 or Maryland Pictorial Standard to define the near-white blast condition.
 If sand or grit is used, use SSPC Pictorial Standard VIS-1 (Grade 2-1/2) to define the near-white condition. Blast clean
 to an anchor profile, from 1.5 mils to 3.0 mils deep. Grind any flame cut edges that do not attain the required anchor
 profile. Determine the profile depth using the elcometer surface profile gauge or Testex replica tape. Ensure that the pH
 of the abrasive is within the range of 6.0 to 8.5.
 Remove fins, tears, slivers, and burred or sharp edges that are present, or that appear during the blasting operations, by
 grinding, and ensure that the reblasted area provides the required anchor profile.
 Before blast cleaning steel, ensure that all reaming and drilling of holes in the steel has been completed, and the steel is
 free of burrs or other imperfections, such as torn or ragged edges. Remove all abrasive residue and dust from steel
 surfaces, and keep the surfaces clean until the prime coat is applied. Protect freshly coated surfaces from subsequent
 blast cleaning operations. Repair blast damaged primed surfaces using a wire brush, or, if visible rust occurs, reblast the
 surface to a near-white condition, re-clean, and re-prime the repaired area.
 906.06.03 Conditions for Painting
 Perform shop painting in an enclosure that is maintained at the required atmospheric conditions and that prevents
 exposure to inclement weather before the paint has completely cured. Perform painting according to the conditions
 specified in SSPC-PA 1 and the following:
 1.
 
 2.
 3.
 
 Apply paint to clean dry surfaces. Do not apply paint for the prime and final coats when the temperature of
 the air, paint, or steel is below 40 °F, or when the temperature is expected to fall below 40 °F before the paint
 is dried. Ensure that the temperature is at least 50 °F when applying the intermediate coat. Do not apply
 coatings when the relative humidity is greater than 85 percent or when a combination of temperature and
 humidity conditions could cause moisture to condense on the surface being coated. During the drying time of
 the inorganic type primers, ensure that the relative humidity is at least 50 percent.
 Do not apply paint when the steel surface temperature is less than 5 °F above the dew point. Determine the
 dew point using a psychrometer.
 Remove all contaminants before applying subsequent coats of paint. Clean the primed surfaces with a high
 pressure water washing (800 pounds per square inch minimum).
 
 906.06.04 Paint Application
 Mix paint according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Apply paint as specified in SSPC-PA 1 and the following:
 1.
 
 2.
 
 3.
 
 Apply the prime coat after the ME inspects and accepts the blast cleaned surface. Before the application of
 the full prime coat, apply a prime coating (striping) to all edges of plates and rolled shapes, corners, crevices,
 welds, rivet heads, and exposed parts of bolts. Before applying the full prime coat, allow the striping to set to
 touch. Apply the primer within 8 hours after cleaning the metal. If any blast cleaned metal remains unpainted
 after 8 hours, blast clean the metal again before priming. Do not apply succeeding coats until the previous
 coat is approved by the ME. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendation for minimum and maximum drying
 time between coats. Allow additional time before applying succeeding coats in cooler temperatures. If the
 maximum time interval between coats is exceeded, submit to the ME the manufacturer’s written
 recommendation for corrective action. Remove all dry spray, by sanding if necessary, before applying the
 succeeding coat.
 Ensure that paint is applied to at least the minimum specified thickness, and ensure that the final appearance is
 uniform and smooth. If the coating is too thin in areas, follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for
 recoating. Repair areas that run, bubble, sag, or mud crack by removing the coating back to soundly bonded
 coating and recoating to the required thickness and appearance.
 Apply only a prime coat of paint to surfaces of steel that will be embedded in or in contact with concrete.
 Apply only a prime coat to contact surfaces at field bolted connections. Mask these surfaces during
 subsequent coating operations. Do not paint surfaces within 2 inches of field welds, except for stud shear
 
 370
 
 4.
 
 connectors. Apply a light coat of rust-inhibitive coating to these surfaces, and mask these surfaces during
 subsequent coating operations.
 Remove all bolted shop connections before blasting and coating girders. Separately blast and prime the parts,
 then reassemble the parts and fully tension the bolts. Do not paint the inside of bolt holes.
 
 906.06.05 Number of Coats and Film Thickness
 Apply all 3 coats in the shop. Ensure that the dry film thickness meets the minimum requirement as specified in Table
 906.06.05-1 but does not exceed the manufacturer’s recommendation for maximum thickness. Determine dry film
 thickness according to SSPC-PA 2.

 The 7-digit structure number.
 The month and year of completion.
 The paint system code number.
 
 Stencil using a black paint that is the same type of paint as the finish coat. Locate the information at least 2 inches above
 the lower flange and within 3 feet from the abutment.
 906.06.07 Additional Handling Requirements for Painted Members
 Allow the paint to dry before loading and shipping the steel. Protect the coated steel from the binding chains using
 softeners. Use padded hooks and slings to hoist steel. Space diaphragms and similar pieces to prevent damage to the
 coating during shipment. Before shipping, submit to the RE for approval, all shipping and work site storage details.
 906.06.08 Quality Control and Acceptance
 Notify the ME, in writing, at least 15 days in advance of beginning work at the fabrication shop, so that arrangements for
 inspection may be made.
 The ME will reject the coating system if rusting occurs; the paint lifts, blisters, wrinkles, or has excessive runs or sags;
 workmanship is poor; or unapproved paint is used. In addition, the ME will reject the total coating system if it is
 determined by measurement with a Tooke gauge that the dry film thickness of the prime, intermediate, or finish coat is
 less than the minimum specified or if the total dry film thickness is less than the 8.5-mil minimum for the 3-coat system.

 Requirements for Fully Automated Batch Type Plants. Use fully automated batch type plants only for mixtures
 containing up to 25 percent RAP. Perform daily checks to ensure that hoppers are discharging completely and that
 the balance returns to zero tare whenever the hoppers are emptied. When directed, make checks to verify the
 accuracy of the batch scales within the normal weighing range, and to ensure that the interlocking devices and
 automatic recording equipment are functioning properly. When the accuracy of the batch scales is not within the
 required weighing tolerances, the Department may require weighing of all trucks on an approved truck scale.
 
 Ensure that the batch plant is equipped with controls for proportioning the RAP into the mixture without damaging
 the asphalt binder in the reclaimed material. If the RAP is introduced into the system before the hot bins, ensure
 that the proportioning controls include weigh belts or belt scales. Ensure that these items electronically interlock
 the new aggregate feed with the RAP feed and vary the feed rates, as required, to maintain the required ratio of new
 aggregate to RAP.
 Prepare the recycled HMA mixtures by the heat transfer method of recycling. Ensure that the RAP does not come
 in direct contact with the flame in the dryer. Adjust the temperature of new aggregate leaving the dryer and the
 time interval of the dry and wet mixing cycles as needed.
 Before combining with the heated new aggregate, ensure that the RAP passes through a 2-1/2-inch vibrating
 scalping screen.
 Ensure that fully automated batch type plants are also equipped with the following:
 1.

 Screens. Use plant screens that are capable of screening aggregates to the specified sizes and proportions,
 and have capacities greater than the capacity of the mixer.
 
 3.
 
 Aggregate Hot Bins. Ensure that the plant is equipped with at least 4 aggregate storage bins of sufficient
 capacity to supply the mixer when it is operating at full capacity. Arrange the bins to ensure separate and
 adequate storage of appropriate fractions of the mineral aggregates. Provide separate dry storage when using
 mineral filler or hydrated lime, and ensure that the plant is equipped to feed such material into the mixer
 accurately and uniformly. Provide each bin with properly sized and located overflow pipes to prevent the
 material from backing up into other compartments or bins. Ensure that each compartment is provided with an
 individual outlet gate that is leak-free when closed and that will cut off flow quickly and completely. Provide
 bins with means to obtain representative samples. Ensure that each bin is equipped with a signaling device
 that automatically provides a visible or audible signal when the level of aggregate reaches the lowest
 25 percent level, and remains in operation until the bin level exceeds the specified minimum.
 
 4.
 
 Plant Scales. Use springless dial type or electronic load cell type plant scales with a readout accurate to
 within the tolerances allowed by the New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety, Office of Weights and
 Measures.

 Ensure that the dial to indicate the amount of asphalt binder has the capacity to measure at least 10 percent
 more than the asphalt binder required in 1 batch. Ensure that the meter can be locked at any dial setting and
 automatically resets to this reading after the addition of asphalt binder to each batch. Locate the dial in full
 view of the mixer operator.
 Automatically control the flow of binder material to begin when the dry mixing period is finished. Ensure
 that all of the asphalt binder material required for 1 batch is discharged within 15 seconds after the flow has
 started. Ensure that the size and spacing of the spray bar openings provide uniform application of asphalt
 binder for the full length of the mixer.
 7.
 
 Mixer. Use a batch mixer capable of producing a uniform mixture within the job mix tolerances. If not
 enclosed, equip the mixer box with a dust hood.
 
 Ensure that the clearance of paddles does not exceed 1-1/2 inches from all fixed and moving parts.
 8.
 
 Control of Mixing Time. Ensure that the mixer is equipped with an accurate time lock to control the
 operations of a complete mixing cycle. It shall lock the weigh box gate after charging of the mixer until the
 closing of the mixer gate at the completion of the cycle. It shall lock the asphalt binder discharge throughout
 the dry mixing period and shall lock the mixer gate throughout the dry and wet mixing periods. The dry
 mixing period is defined as the interval of time between the opening of the weigh box gate and the start of
 introduction of asphalt binder. The wet mixing period is defined as the interval of time between the start of
 introduction of asphalt binder and the opening of the mixer gate.
 
 Ensure that timing control is adjustable and capable of being set at intervals of 5 seconds or less. As a part of
 the timing device, install a mechanical batch counter designed to register only completely mixed batches.

 C.
 
 Ensure that the system contains auxiliary interlocking cut-off circuits to interrupt and stop the automatic
 cycling of the batching operations any time the weighing tolerances are exceeded, when any aggregate
 bin becomes empty, or when there is a malfunctioning of any portion of the control system. A platform
 truck scale is not required. However, if the automatic proportioning or recording devices becomes
 inoperative or inaccurate, then manually operate the plant to complete the day’s production with the
 approval of the RE. In this case, a platform truck scale is mandatory for manual operation.
 The Department will make independent checks on batch weights by weighing trucks before and after
 loading, and may request an inspection of the plant scales by the New Jersey Department of Law and
 Public Safety, Office of Weights and Measures for verification of the automatic printout tickets.
 
 Requirements for Drum Mixing Plants. The Contractor may use drum mixing plants in the preparation of HMA
 paving mixtures. Heat, coat, and mix the HMA mixture in a parallel flow, counter flow, or other approved type of
 dryer-mixer.
 
 Ensure that the drum mixing plant includes the following:

 electronically interlocked with the asphalt binder metering system to automatically vary the asphalt binder
 feed rate, as required, to maintain the required asphalt binder content in the mixture.
 
 Make provisions for introducing the moisture content of the cold-feed aggregates into the composite aggregate
 weigh belt signal and correcting wet aggregate weight to dry aggregate weight. Continuously display, by
 electronic readout at the operator’s station, the dry weight of the composite aggregate flow in units of tons per
 hour and total. Ensure that the composite aggregate feed rate is accurate to within 1 percent of the indicated
 rate. Equip belt conveyors with scrapers or other suitable devices to prevent adherence or other loss of the
 weighed cold-feed aggregate.
 Before the start of production of Department mixes, ensure that plant controls are calibrated. Report to the
 ME any changes in or modifications to the equipment or operation occurring subsequent to the initial
 calibration. The ME may direct calibration checks or a new plant calibration. The ME may also direct
 recalibrating the plant if the finished mixture displays composition deficiencies. For each drum mix plant
 placed in operation, submit 2 complete sets of plant drawings, a plant operator’s manual, and a plan detailing
 the method of plant calibration. The ME will witness the calibration of the individual cold-feeders at several
 production rates throughout the range of the plant’s capacity. Submit a copy of the computations for the
 combined rate of flow, and a plot of calibration charts, indicating the rate of aggregate delivery in tons per
 hour from each cold-feeder for particular dial settings and gate openings. Determine calibration points by
 independently diverting each cold-feed into trucks (or running each feed through the plant) and determining
 the proper console dial setting corresponding to the measured rate of delivery. Determine calibration points in
 increments of approximately 100 tons per hour of total aggregate flow.
 The ME will witness a check on the mineral filler and asphalt binder feeds at several production rate
 increments throughout the range of the plant’s capacity. Divert the asphalt binder into trucks or other
 containers for weight or volumetric measurements to calibrate the asphalt binder metering system and
 subsequent checks. The method used to calibrate the mineral filler feeder system is subject to approval.
 6.
 
 Drum Mixer. Use a drum mixer that continually agitates the mixture of aggregate and asphalt binder during
 heating. The drum mixer should not adversely affect the aggregate or asphalt binder during drying and
 heating operations. Equip the mixer discharge with a pyrometer or thermometer probe to record the
 temperature of the mixture, with the data transmitted to the operator’s station.
 
 Ensure that the mixer is equipped to safely and conveniently obtain representative mixture samples before
 introduction into the surge bin.
 The ME may perform test comparisons between the consistency of the asphalt binder in its original form from
 plant tank samples and in processed form from mixture recovery samples obtained before the mixture’s
 introduction into the surge bin. The ME will use the results of the consistency tests to determine whether a
 processing improvement is necessary to eliminate excessive volatilization, oxidation, or other causes of
 premature hardening.
 7.
 
 Emission Control System. Ensure that the plant is equipped with an emission control system conforming to
 all applicable emission limitations.
 
 8.
 
 Control Console. Ensure that the following items are included in the control console at the operator’s station:
 
 1.
 2.

 Aggregate weigh belt readouts displaying the weight of material being proportioned from each aggregate
 bin in tons per hour or the corresponding percentage of total mix weight and the total flow over the main
 feeder to the drum mixer in tons per hour. Ensure that the accumulated weights in tons from each bin
 and the total feed to the mixer are separately totaled and are continuously displayed or are available on
 demand from a printout device.
 Mineral filler readouts displaying the weight of material being proportioned from the mineral filler bin in
 tons per hour or the corresponding percentage of total mix weight together with an accumulative total in
 tons.

 being proportioned into the mix together with an accumulative total in tons, and a recording pyrometer
 or thermometer that records the temperature of the asphalt binder at the pump.
 Proportioning controls that set the asphalt binder content as well as the aggregate moisture adjustment.
 
 Modifications. When producing mixes containing 26 to 50 percent of RAP, ensure that the mixing time
 allows thorough blending of new and reclaimed materials and complete coating all aggregate particles. If
 lumps of reclaimed material are observed in the mixture as it is discharged from the drum, adjust the mixing
 time in the drum or make other changes in the production process to correct this condition. Ensure that the
 temperature of the mixture at discharge from the plant or surge and storage bins is maintained at or above the
 temperature required to deliver the material to the work site and achieve optimum compaction.
 
 1009.02 HMA TRUCKS
 
 Transport the mixture from the mixing plant to the Project Limits in trucks equipped with tight, clean bodies. The
 Contractor may lightly coat the trucks with a fine aggregate, soap or lime solution, or other such non-petroleum-based
 release agent. Do not use a petroleum-based product as a release agent.
 Permanently equip trucks with an airfoil that is capable, at any speed or under any weather conditions, to deflect air over
 the tarp and to prevent air from going under the tarp. Ensure that the airfoil is affixed no more than 2 feet in front of the
 tarp roll and be at least as high as the top of the tarp roll.
 Provide a waterproof tarp that is capable of withstanding normal handling and placement temperatures of up to 400 °F
 without damaging the fabric, has a minimum weight of 18 ounces per square yard, and is properly sized to completely
 cover the load. Immediately cover each truckload after loading at the plant with the tarp to protect the mixture from the
 weather. Ensure that the tarp securely meets or overlaps the top of the tailgate and is securely held in place so as to
 prevent air from lifting the tarp during transportation.
 Ensure that the truck body is heated or insulated as necessary to ensure delivery of the mixture at the specified
 temperature. Remove any truck from the work that does not have an airfoil or does not have an approved tarp until such
 conditions are corrected and the truck is presented for inspection to the RE. The RE or ME may require that the
 Contractor make available the vehicles used for transporting HMA mixture for inspection at the plant laboratory before
 shipping materials.

 Perform a gradation test on 1 portion according to AASHTO T 27 to determine the percent retained on
 the 3/4, 1/2, and 3/8 inch sieves and the percent passing the 3/8-inch sieve.
 Separate the test sample into fractionated sizes as specified in Table A-5-1. Discard material passing the
 3/8 inch sieve or retained on the 1 inch sieve. Also, discard fractions on sieves that represent less than
 10 percent of the overall sample.
 If the sample contains less than 10 percent of any of the sizes specified in Table A-5-1, do not test that
 size. For the purpose of calculating test results, consider the fractionated size to contain the same
 percentage of soft particles as the average of the next larger and the next smaller size. If one of these
 sizes is absent, consider the fractionated size to contain the same percentage of soft particles as the next
 larger or next smaller size, whichever is present.
 Take a representative sample meeting the sample size requirements in Table A-5-1 of each of the
 fractionated sizes to be tested.
 Test each particle of aggregate in a fractionated size using the following Steps:
 
 449
 
 6.1 Place the piece of coarse aggregate under the scratch hardness apparatus forcing the piece of
 aggregate to touch the sharpened, brass rod.
 6.2 Push up on the 2-pound weighted brass rod with the piece of aggregate and pull the aggregate
 forward. Ensure that the brass rod remains in firm contact with the piece of aggregate at least from
 the center to the edge of the aggregate on one face.
 6.3 Examine the particle to determine if it was scratched. Consider the particle to be soft if a groove
 was made in it without deposition of metal from the brass rod or if separate particles are detached
 from the rock mass. Consider the particle to be hard if a metal streak was made on it by the brass
 rod and no groove was made. If a particle contains more than one type of rock and is determined to
 be partly hard and partly soft, consider the particle soft if the soft part is more than 30 percent of
 the particle.
 6.4 Assign the particles to groups of soft or hard particles.

 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 C.
 
 Table of random numbers.
 Shovel.
 Bucket or pail of suitable size to collect sample.
 Scoop and spatulas.
 
 Procedure. Perform the following steps:
 1.
 
 Lot Sizes. When taking samples from the truck at the plant, apply the rates of sampling to the plant’s
 production for all Department projects rather than for individual projects. Divide the production into
 successive lots of the size as specified in Section 902 for the mixture being sampled. Take 5 samples for
 volumetric acceptance testing, composition testing, maximum specific gravity testing, and comparison testing
 from each lot. The ME will assign consecutive lot numbers for each type of mix at the plant. Include the
 assigned lot identification number on each weigh ticket.
 
 2.
 
 Obtaining Samples. The ME will use a table of random numbers to select the ton of mix to be sampled for
 each sample in the lot. Based on the ton of mix, determine the truckload to be sampled. Obtain samples from
 the designated truckloads of material using the following method:
 
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 3.
 
 Flip a coin to determine which half of the truck to sample. If HEADS, sample the front half of the
 truck. If TAILS, sample the rear half of the truck.
 Do not sample at the very bottom of a pile or in areas between piles to reduce the possibility of
 including segregated material in the sample.
 Dig a furrow 3 to 6 inches deep that extends along the conical pile within the half of the truck to be
 sampled. Follow the slope of the pile starting as near to the center of the truck as possible.
 From the furrow, shovel approximately equal volumes of material from the top third, center third,
 and bottom third of the pile. Sample enough material to perform all required testing.
 
 Mixing and Reducing Samples. Mix the sample taken from the truck using a scoop. Clean all tools by
 scraping with spatulas before and after each remixing to prevent build-up of asphalt and fines on the tools. Do
 not use solvents to clean tools between uses. After mixing, reduce the sample as follows:
 a.
 
 Gyratory Specimen. Scoop a representative portion of HMA from the container of material to be
 molded into one specimen for volumetric testing according to AASHTO T 312. Ensure that the HMA is
 at the specified compaction temperature when molding the specimen.
 
 b.
 
 Composition Sample. After the removal of material for the gyratory specimen, remix the remaining
 material. Perform composition testing by the ignition method by taking a representative sample from the
 
 452
 
 remixed material and testing according to AASHTO T 308. If composition analysis is being performed
 by hot bin analysis, NJDOT B-5, a composition sample of HMA mix is not necessary.
 
 4.
 
 D.
 
 c.
 
 Maximum Specific Gravity Sample. Remix the remaining material. Take a sample for determining
 maximum specific gravity and test according to AASHTO T 209.
 
 d.
 
 Comparison Sample. Remix the remaining material and prepare a comparison sample weighing
 approximately 9 pounds. Place the comparison sample in a container that is sealed and labeled. Store
 the comparison sample at the plant for at least 3 months so it will be available for selection by the ME.
 
 Identifying Samples. Identify samples by lot number and position in the lot’s sampling sequence. Use a
 number followed by a letter to identify the sample. Use the lot number as the number and label the first,
 second, third, fourth, and fifth samples in the lot as “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E”, respectively. If multiple
 samples are taken from the same truckload of mix, assign the same identification code to each of the samples.
 
 Report. Report deviations to the specified sampling procedure.

 determined in Step 3 and its bulk specific gravity determined in Step 1.
 If the percent air voids for the randomly selected core is outside the comparison limits determined in
 Step 4, perform maximum specific gravity testing on the remaining cores in the lot. Do not perform
 Steps 7 to 9.
 If the air void content for the randomly selected core is within the comparison limits determined in Step
 4, use the maximum specific gravity of the randomly selected core and the individual bulk specific
 gravities to determine the air void content of the remaining cores in the lot.
 If the air void content of any 1 of the cores in the lot as calculated in Step 7 falls outside of the
 comparison limits as determined in Step 4, perform maximum specific gravity testing on the remaining
 cores in the lot. Use the individual maximum specific gravities and bulk specific gravities to determine
 the air void content of each core.
 If the air void content of all of the cores in the lot as calculated in Step 7 fall inside of the comparison
 limits as determined in Step 4, use the air void contents for the individual cores as determined in Step 7.

 NJDOT B-8 – DETERMINING JOB MIX FORMULA FOR
 MODIFIED OPEN-GRADED FRICTION COURSE MIXES
 A.
 
 Scope. This test method is used to determine gradation and the percent asphalt in a MOGFC mixture. The
 gradation is verified to ensure stone-on-stone contact, and the impact resistance of the final JMF is verified. The
 optimum asphalt content (AC) is determined from: (1) aggregate surface area, (2) relative Voids in Mineral
 Aggregate (VMA), and (3) visual drain-down determination of asphalt content. A simple average of these 3 criteria
 is used to determine the JMF asphalt content.

 Procedure. Perform the following steps:
 1.
 
 Verification of Stone-On-Stone Contact. Choose the design gradation to meet the air void requirements and
 to ensure that the aggregate skeleton exhibits stone-on-stone contact. Sieve aggregates proportioned to meet
 the selected JMF gradation over a No. 4 sieve. Keep the material retained on the No. 4 sieve as the coarse
 aggregate fraction. Determine the unit weight Guwca of the coarse aggregate fraction of the aggregate using the
 dry rodding technique according to AASHTO T 19 For the selected JMF, determine the voids in the coarse
 aggregate of the mix (VCAmix) based on specimens compacted with 50 gyrations according to AASHTO
 T 312. Calculate:
 VCA drc =
 
 100 (G sbca - G uwca )
 G sbca
 
 Where:
 VCAdrc = The voids in the coarse aggregate fraction of the JMF aggregate skeleton.
 Gsbca = The bulk specific gravity of the coarse aggregate fraction as determined by AASHTO T 85.
 Guwca = The unit weight of the coarse aggregate fraction (expressed in kilograms per cubic meter) as determined by
 AASHTO T 19.
 
 VCA mix = 100 −
 
 Pca - G mb
 G sbca
 
 Where:
 VCAmix = The voids in the coarse aggregate fraction of the mix. The coarse aggregate fraction of the aggregate is that
 portion of the JMF aggregate skeleton not passing the No. 4 sieve.

 2.
 
 Surface Area Asphalt Content. Determine “surface area” asphalt content according to NJDOT B-9.
 
 3.
 
 Relative VMA Asphalt Content. Mix aggregate graded to proposed JMF with asphalt and fiber at 5 asphalt
 contents (1 at the estimated JMF asphalt content, 1 each at + and −0.5 percent and 1 each at + and –1.0
 percent of the estimated JMF asphalt content) according to AASHTO T 312. After mixing, return sample to
 the oven if necessary, and when at the recommended compaction temperature, compact the specimens.
 Compact 3 specimens at each asphalt content using 50 gyrations of a Superpave Gyratory Compactor
 according to AASHTO T 312. Determine the bulk specific gravity, Gmb from each specimen according to
 NJDOT B-6 or AASHTO TP 69.
 
 Determine maximum specific gravity, Gmm, at each asphalt content according to AASHTO T 209. From Gmb,
 Gmm, and each known asphalt content, calculate volumetric information as follows:
 Plot asphalt content versus “relative VMA” and select the asphalt content at the lowest point on the curve.
 Va = 100 ×
 
 457
 
 1 - G mb
 G mm
 
 Vb = b × G mb
 VMA R = Va × Vb
 Where:
 b = Percent AC by weight of total mix
 Gmb = the bulk specific gravity of the specimen as determined by NJDOT B-6 or AASHTO TP 69.
 Gmm = the maximum specific gravity at each asphalt content as determined by AASHTO T 209.
 Va = Volume of air is equal to the percent air voids.
 Vb = Percent by volume of asphalt cement.
 VMAR = Relative VMA
 
 The volume of the fiber, absorbed asphalt, and specific gravity of asphalt binder are not accounted for in this
 procedure. This procedure measures “relative VMA” not the true VMA.
 4.
 
 Visual Draindown Asphalt Content. Prepare 1000-gram samples of the uncompacted mix for each of the
 asphalt contents. Place each sample into a clean, clear glass (Pyrex) 9-inch pie pans. Place samples in oven
 for 1 hour at the binder manufacturer’s recommended mixing temperature. Remove and let cool for 1 hour at
 room temperature. Visually observe the amount of liquid asphalt on the bottom of each pan. Select asphalt
 content where ample bonding is evident, without having excessive drainage as evidenced by an appearance of
 unconnected pools of asphalt binder around aggregate points of contact.
 
 5.
 
 Select Optimum Asphalt Content for JMF. Determine the JMF asphalt content by averaging the results
 from the 3 methods (surface area, relative VMA, and draindown).
 AC jmf =
 
 AC sc + AC vma + AC dd
 3
 
 Where:
 ACjmf = the design JMF
 ACsc = the asphalt content determined by the surface area in Step 2.
 ACvma = the asphalt content determined by relative VMA in Step 3.
 ACdd = the asphalt content determined by draindown in Step 4.
 
 6.
 
 Verification of Abrasion and Impact Resistance of JMF (Cantabro Test). Compact 2 specimens using the
 JMF at the optimum asphalt content as specified in Step 3. Age the specimens for 7 days ± 8 hours in an oven
 at 140 ± 5 °F. Weigh each sample. Utilizing a Los Angeles Machine conforming to AASHTO T 96, without
 the charge of steel balls, subject the aged samples to 300 revolutions at 30 to 33 revolutions per minute. After
 the 300 revolutions reweigh the samples.
 
 Calculate the Percent Loss:
 Ploss =
 
 A-B
 × 100
 A
 
 Where:
 Ploss = The loss expressed as percent of aged sample before L.A. Abrasion Machine treatment.
 A = The weight of the sample before modified L.A. Abrasion test.
 B = The weight of the sample after modified L.A. Abrasion test.
 
 If the loss is less than 30 percent, the JMF is acceptable. If the JMF is determined to be unacceptable,
 redesign the mix.

 NJDOT R-1 – OPERATING INERTIAL PROFILER SYSTEMS FOR EVALUATING
 PAVEMENT PROFILES
 A.
 
 Scope. This test method describes the procedure for operating and verifying the calibration of an ASTM E 950
 Class 1 Inertial Profiler System (IPS).
 
 B.
 
 Apparatus. Use an IPS that meets the requirements of AASHTO MP 11 and ASTM E 950, Class 1 and the
 following:
 
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 C.
 
 Certify the IPS according to AASHTO PP 49 at least every 2 years. If a system component is replaced,
 re-certify the system. Perform the certification at a site approved by the Department.
 The data system provides the raw profile data in an ASCII format acceptable to the Department.
 The computer program uses a high-pass filter set at 300 feet and reads an ASCII or text file for
 computing the International Roughness Index (IRI) in inches per mile.
 The current version of ROADRUF, ProVal, or other Department approved pavement profile analysis
 software is used to compute the IRI.
 
 Procedure. Perform the following steps:
 
 1.
 2.
 
 3.
 4.
 5.
 6.
 
 Operate the IPS according to AASHTO PP 50 and ASTM E 950.
 On a daily basis before data collection, check the equipment and operating system for operational
 stability and calibration.
 Perform necessary calibration procedures according to equipment
 manufacturer’s procedures and applicable standards. Operators shall maintain a log documenting the
 calibration history.
 Ensure that the operators of the IPS have completed a profile training course, such as NHI Course
 131100, have been trained specifically on the IPS they will be operating, and are proficient in the
 operation of the IPS.
 Make provisions to automatically start and stop the IPS recording at the beginning and end of testing.
 Place retroreflective traffic striping tape or other approved mechanism at the beginning and end of each
 direction of travel for automatically triggering the start and stop of profile measurements.
 Collect at least 0.05-mile of data before the area to be tested to allow the system to stabilize before
 profile measurements are obtained. Collect data in a continuous run through the length to be tested. If
 the run is interrupted, discard the results and re-run the length.
 Submit the raw data for determination of the IRI.

 NJDOT S-1 – ROTATIONAL-CAPACITY TEST ON LONG BOLTS IN TENSION
 CALIBRATOR
 A.
 
 Scope. This test method is used for determination of high-strength steel bolt assembly acceptance for rotational
 capacity using a tension calibrator. Use this test method for bolts long enough to fit in the tension calibrator. Use
 NJDOT S-2 for bolts that are too short to fit in the tension calibrator.
 
 B.
 
 Apparatus. Use the following apparatus:
 
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 C.
 
 Calibrated bolt tension measuring device of size required for bolts to be tested, such as SkidmoreWilhelm Calibrator.
 Calibrated torque wrench (dial type).
 Spacers and/or washers with hole-size no larger than 1/16 inch greater than bolt to be tested.
 Steel section for mounting the bolt calibrator such as a flange of a girder or cross frame accessible from
 the ground.
 
 Procedure. Perform the following steps:
 
 1.
 
 2.
 3.
 
 To determine if the bolt is long enough for testing, mark the first 3 to 5 full threads that are located
 closest to the bolt head. Insert the bolt into the tension calibrator and assemble a washer and nut onto the
 bolt up to the marked threads. Use a rotational capacity washer from the same rotational capacity lot as
 the bolt and nut. If a washer is not required for the installation, use an ASTM F 436 washer of the
 proper diameter for the test. If the nut can not be fully threaded onto the bolt shank then the bolt is too
 short for testing and must be tested as specified in NJDOT S-2. If the nut is at least flush with the end of
 the bolt shank, then continue testing.
 Take apart the bolt assembly. Use shim plates or washers under the bolt head, as needed, to ensure that
 the 3 to 5 threads that were marked in Step 1 are located within the grip of the device but are just visible
 from the opposite side. Re-assemble the bolt, washer, and nut.
 Tighten the nut using a hand wrench to the minimum snug tension as specified in Table S-1-1. Do not
 exceed the minimum snug tension by more than 2 kips.

 Further tighten the bolt to the rotation listed in Table S-1-3. Measure rotation from the match mark in
 Step 4. Record the bolt’s final tension as indicated on the calibrator. If an assembly fails by stripping or
 fracturing before reaching the rotation listed in Table S-1-3, the assembly fails the test.

 Loosen the assembly and remove nut to examine the threads on the nut and bolt. Check for signs of
 thread shear failure, stripping, or torsional failure of the nut and bolt. Assemblies that have evidence of
 thread shear, stripping, or torsional distress fail the test.
 
 Calculations. Calculate the maximum allowable torque in foot-pounds as follows:
 Maximum Allowable Torque = 0.25 × P × D
 Where:
 P = Measured initial tension in pounds
 D = Bolt diameter in feet
 
 Compare the torque as measured in Step 5 to the maximum allowable torque. If the measured torque is greater than
 the maximum allowable torque, the assembly fails the test.

 thickness that will provide the number of threads under the nut required in Step 1 of the procedure.
 
 Procedure. Perform the following steps:
 
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 4.
 5.
 6.
 
 Before testing, verify that the bolt is too short for testing as specified in NJDOT S-1.
 Mark on the first 3 to 5 threads that are located closest to the bolt head.
 Insert the bolt into the steel section using shim plates or washers under the bolt head, as needed, to
 ensure that the 3 to 5 threads that were marked in Step 2 are just visible from the opposite side.
 Assemble a washer and nut onto the bolt up to the marked threads. Use a rotational capacity washer
 from the same rotational-capacity lot as the bolt and nut. If a washer is not required for the installation,
 use an ASTM F 436 washer of the proper diameter for the test.
 Snug the bolt using a hand wrench. Do not exceed 20 percent of the torque determined in Step 6.
 Match mark a corner of the nut and the plate.
 Using the torque wrench, tighten the nut to the rotation listed in Table S-2-1. Use a second wrench to
 prevent rotation of the bolt head during tightening. Record the torque required to reach this rotation.
 Measure and record the torque required to reach the rotation with the nut in motion.

 NJDOT S-3 – VERIFYING DIRECT TENSION INDICATORS (DTI)
 A.
 
 Scope. Use this test method to verify and install high-strength steel bolts using direct tension indicators (DTIs).
 
 B.
 
 Apparatus. Use the following apparatus:
 
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 C.
 
 Calibrated bolt tension measuring device, such as a Skidmore-Wilhelm Calibrator, with a special flat
 insert in place of normal bolt head holding insert. The special insert is required to allow access to
 measure the DTI gaps.
 Tapered leaf thickness (feeler) gauge 0.005 inch. Use the same gauge as to be used to inspect the bolts
 after installation.
 Steel section to mount bolt calibrator, such as a flange of girder or cross frame that is accessible from the
 ground.
 Impact and manual wrenches to tighten bolts. Equipment should be the same as to be used in the work.
 
 Procedure. Perform the following steps:
 
 1.
 
 2.
 
 Install bolt, nut, DTI, and standard washer into bolt tension measuring device. Ensure that the assembly
 matches that to be used in the work unless bolts are too short to fit in the device. If the bolts are too
 short, use longer bolts of the same diameter and from the same manufacturer to perform the DTI
 verification. Test 3 assemblies for each rotational-capacity lot.
 Tighten the nut to the tension listed in Table S-3-1. Use another wrench on the bolt head to prevent
 rotation of the head against the DTI if the DTI is under the bolt head. If an impact wrench is used,
 tighten to a load slightly below the required load and use a manual wrench to attain the required tension.

 If the DTI is coated and under the nut, the maximum verification refusals is the number of spaces on the washer
 minus 1.
 
 Further tighten the bolt until the 0.005-inch thickness gage is refused at all spaces but a visible gap exists
 in at least one space. Record the load as read on the tension measuring device.
 Remove the bolt from the calibrator and turn the nut on the threads of the bolt by hand. If the nut is able
 to be turned on the complete length of the threads, the DTI is acceptable. If the nut is unable to go the
 full length, but the load at the minimum DTI gap measured in Step 4 is less than 95 percent of the
 average tension recorded during the rotational-capacity test, the DTI is acceptable. If the nut cannot be
 run the full thread length and the tension at the smallest gap condition is greater than 95 percent of the
 average tension recorded during the rotational-capacity test, the DTI is not acceptable.
 If any of the 3 DTIs for the lot are found to be not acceptable, reject the DTI lot.

 Numbers in the body of the table are estimates of lot percent defective corresponding to specific values of “Q,” the Quality Index.
 For values of “Q” greater than or equal to zero, the estimate of percent defective is read directly from the table. For values of “Q”
 less than zero, the table value must be subtracted from 100.
