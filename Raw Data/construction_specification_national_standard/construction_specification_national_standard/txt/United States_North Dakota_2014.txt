 on something. For example: “The Engineer will take a sample.” A similar sentence
 in the passive voice—“A sample will be taken”—would be unclear about who was
 responsible for taking the sample.
 The Standard Specifications also make use of the imperative mood. The imperative mood is used when the party issuing an instruction and the party receiving it
 are already understood. In the Standard Specifications, the Department is stating
 its requirements or directions for work to the Contractor; such statements have the
 same force as if they contained the word “shall.” In an imperative sentence such
 as, “Place the concrete,” the Department is indicating that it requires the Contractor to place the concrete. Before award of the contract, imperative statements are
 directed to the Bidder. Between award and execution of the contract, imperatives
 are directed to the lowest responsible Bidder; and after execution, to the Contractor.
 The Department will identify parties other than the Bidder or Contractor to whom it
 gives a responsibility in the Standard Specifications. In phrasings where the responsible party has already been clearly identified or in factual statements when it is not
 important to do so, the Department may use the passive voice.
 When these specifications indicate that work shall be “required, requested, directed,
 authorized, ordered, permitted, suspended, approved, accepted, or rejected,” it shall
 be understood that these expressions and others similar to them are followed by the
 phrase, “by the Engineer.”
 101.02 ORGANIZATION OF THE SPECIFICATIONS
 A. General.
 With the exception of Section 100, “General Provisions,” and Section 800,
 “Materials,” the sections of the Standard Specifications are written in a six-part
 format. Each section contains the following primary subsections:
 XXX.01 Description
 XXX.02 Equipment
 XXX.03 Materials
 XXX.04 Construction Requirements
 XXX.05 Method of Measurement
 XXX.06 Basis of Payment
 The subsections contain varying numbers of titled subordinate subsections
 composed of higher and lower levels, as in an outline.
 B. Hierarchy of Organization.
 The requirements of a subsection apply to subordinate subsections. In addition, many subsections begin with a lower-level subsection called “General.”
 The requirements of “General” subsections apply to the associated same-level
 7
 
 101.2 B
 
 subsections that follow; they do not apply to the higher level.
 All of the provisions of Section 100, “General Provisions,” of the Standard
 Specifications apply to all portions of the contract.
 C. Titles or Headings.
 The titles or headings of sections and subsections are for the convenience of
 referencing and have no bearing on the meaning or interpretation of the text.
 D. References.
 The specifications rely on many cross references, both to internal sources in
 the specifications and external sources in other contract documents, Department
 manuals, and other industry resources. If the contract documents reference an
 external publication, the Department intends that the reference be to the most
 recent issue, including interim publications before the date of the advertisement,
 unless the contract specifies otherwise.
 When a test procedure uses the prefix “ND,” the proper test procedure can be
 found in the Department’s Field Sampling and Testing Manual, which is available on the Department’s website: www.dot.nd.gov.
 Each contract item listed in the contract references to a section number from
 the specifications; therefore, all of the provisions of that referenced section that
 are relevant to the proper completion of the contract item are binding upon the
 Contractor. This includes the requirements found in the “General” subsections
 as well as those specific requirements listed thereafter.
 Within the specifications, references to other sections and subsections of the
 specifications apply the same as if they were a part of the specification section
 or subsection from which they were referenced. A cross-reference to a specific
 subsection of these specifications includes all general requirements of the section of which the subsection is a part.

 102.04 INTERPRETATION OF QUANTITIES IN BID ITEM LIST
 The quantities in the bid item list are estimates only that the Department prepares
 for comparing proposals. The Department will measure and pay for accepted quantities of work in accordance with Section 109, “Measurement and Payment.”
 102.05 EXAMINATION OF PROPOSAL PACKAGE AND PROJECT
 Examine the proposal package and the project, including locations identified in the
 proposal package, before submitting a proposal. The Department will consider a
 Bidder’s submission of a proposal as conclusive evidence that the Bidder has investigated and is satisfied as to the conditions to be encountered; the character, quality,
 and scope of work to be performed; the quantities of materials to be furnished; and
 the conditions and requirements of the proposal package. Make such independent
 investigation and examination as necessary to be satisfied as to conditions to be encountered in the performance of the work and with respect to possible local material
 sources, the quality and quantity of material available from such property, and the
 type and extent of processing that may be required to produce material conforming
 to the contract. Independent investigation and examination includes knowledge of
 the State’s physical geography, geology, and hydrology, and of the available publications on that subject matter.
 If conditions at the project site are inconsistent with the proposal package or there
 are discrepancies, conflicts, errors, omissions, or ambiguities within the proposal
 package, immediately submit a request for explanation to the Department’s Construction Services Division. The Department must receive requests for explanation
 in adequate time to allow the Department to reply. The Department will issue interpretations by addendum and make them available on the Department’s website and
 the Bid Express website at least 2 business days before the bid opening. Before the
 Department’s approval and execution of the contract, any statements, explanations,
 or representations concerning the project made by any of the Department’s employees or agents are not binding, unless specifically included in the proposal package.
 102.06 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
 A. General.
 Any information that is not included in the proposal package is considered supplemental information and will not become part of the contract.
 The Department provides supplemental information on an “as-is” basis. Supplemental information is data that is used or generated by the Department for use in
 project development and is not part of the proposal package and will not become
 part of the contract.
 Items designated as supplemental information are preliminary only and may
 21
 
 102.06 A
 
 differ from final design details. The Department does not warrant supplemental
 information to be free of errors or deficiencies and does not warrant the information as being fit for any particular use.
 Refer to the contract for final construction information for bidding and construction purposes.
 Any available supplemental information will be located on the Department’s
 website alongside the proposal package. If no supplemental information is
 available, a statement to that effect will be included in the area that would contain the supplemental information.
 B. Soil Information and Boring Logs.
 The Department does not warrant or guarantee the sufficiency or accuracy of
 the boring logs or the interpretations made or opinions of the Department as to
 the type of materials and conditions that may be encountered.
 General soil and rock strata descriptions and indicated boundaries are based on
 a geotechnical interpretation of all available subsurface data and may not reflect
 the actual subsurface conditions between individual borings or between sampled strata within the bore hole. The laboratory data and the in-place data can be
 relied on only to the degree of reliability inherent to the standard test method.
 The observed water levels or soil moisture conditions may vary considerably
 with time according to climatic conditions including temperature, precipitation,
 and wind, as well as other non-climatic factors.
 Make independent subsurface investigations, as necessary, to become satisfied
 with the conditions to be encountered on the project.
 C. Electronic Design Data.
 Electronic design data is subject to change by the Department without notice.
 The use of electronic design data in preparation of a proposal or in performance
 of the work does not allow relief from obligations under the contract or from
 complete and proper fulfillment of the contract requirements. The Department
 does not warrant or guarantee the accuracy of the electronic design data or the
 consequences related to the use, retention, distribution, alteration, or deletion of
 the electronic design data.
 The use of electronic design data does not entitle the Contractor to compensation or an extension of time for damages or losses which could be attributed to
 the use of electronic design data.
 Electronic design data will be accessible through the Department’s ftp site. A
 notice will be placed with the remaining supplemental information with instructions detailing how to access the electronic design data.

 A. General.
 Prepare the proposal using the Bid Express website in accordance with Section 102.07 B, “Electronic Proposal,” unless the notice to bidders states that the
 Department will accept a paper proposal in accordance with Section 102.07 C,
 “Paper Proposal.”
 22
 
 102.07.C
 
 Acknowledge the receipt of all addenda in accordance with the proposal forms.
 Execute the proposal as follows:
 1. For an individual, signed by that individual;
 2. For a partnership, signed by a partner;
 3. For a corporation, signed by an officer of the corporation with the officer’s title;
 4. For a joint venture, signed by a legally qualified representative of each of the
 parties to the joint venture; and
 5. For an individual, a partnership, a corporation, or a joint venture, signed by
 anyone having a power of attorney. Provide a copy of the power of attorney
 with the proposal, or arrange with the Department to file the power of attorney with the Department before submitting the proposal.
 B. Electronic Proposal.
 Before preparing and submitting a proposal using the Bid Express website at
 www.bidx.com, obtain a Bidder identification number from the Department.
 Create a digital ID by following the directions on the Bid Express website. The
 digital ID must be on file and enabled by Bid Express. Use of this digital ID
 constitutes the Bidder’s signature for execution of the proposal. The Department is not responsible for the Bidder’s inability to submit a proposal using Bid
 Express.
 Prepare the proposal using Bid Express as follows:
 1. Download the most current “Expedite Project Files” and “DBE Roster File”
 from the Bid Express or Department website; and
 2. Use the Expedite software to generate and prepare the proposal forms. Follow the Expedite software instructions and review the help screens provided
 on the Bid Express website to ensure that the bid item list is prepared properly. Provide a unit price for each bid item.
 If the proposal forms contain alternate or optional bid items, provide unit
 prices for those bid items as follows:
 a. For alternate bid items, provide a unit price for each bid item included in
 the Bidder’s preferred alternate; and
 b. For optional bid items, provide a unit price for all bid items under all options.
 C. Paper Proposal.
 The Department will only consider a paper proposal if the proposal package
 states that the Department will accept a paper proposal.
 Enter a unit price in numerals for each bid item on the bid item list, except as not
 required in the case of alternate bid items. Enter the product of each unit price
 and respective quantity. Enter the total sum bid at the bottom of the last page of
 the bid item list.
 The paper bid item list may be a computer-printed bid item list from the current
 23
 
 102.07.C
 
 version of Expedite. Execute the proposal by signing and notarizing in ink and
 in the space provided on the proposal forms.
 102.08 BID LIMITATION
 If the Bidder desires to submit a proposal on more than one project as part of the
 same bid opening (date and time), and desires to avoid receiving an award of more
 projects than the Bidder is equipped to handle, the Bidder may submit proposals
 on multiple projects and limit the total amount of work awarded to the Bidder on
 selected projects by completing the “Bid Limitation” section in the proposal forms.
 The bid limitation can be made by declaring the total amount of work or total number of projects.
 If a Bidder makes a limiting statement on any proposal, the statement will apply to
 all proposals submitted by the Bidder as part of that bid opening. If the bid limitation statements on more than one proposal differ, the Department will use the lower
 bid limitation amount or number.
 Do not attempt to reserve the right to choose the contract or contracts.
 When considering all projects with bid limitations, the Department will select those
 proposals that provide the lowest overall cost to the Department.
 102.09 PROPOSAL GUARANTY

 SECTION 103
 AWARD AND EXECUTION OF CONTRACT
 103.01 CONSIDERATION OF PROPOSALS
 A. General.
 After the Department opens and announces the proposals, the Department will
 compare the proposals based on each total sum bid, and will publicly announce
 the results. The Department reserves the right to reject any or all proposals,
 waive technicalities, or to advertise for new proposals.
 B. Requests to Withdraw Proposals.
 To request a withdrawal of a proposal after the bid opening due to a bid error,
 notify the Department that an error occurred by submitting a written request to
 the Department with the following information:
 1. All bid documentation related to the error(s); and
 2. A notarized affidavit or declaration signed under penalty of perjury that describes the specific error(s) and certifies that any submitted bid documentation were the only ones used in the preparation of the proposal.
 The Department will not consider requests received after 5:00 p.m. central time
 on the second business day after the bid opening. The Department will review
 the request to determine the validity of the claimed error, and will evaluate applicable laws to determine if relief from forfeiture is warranted. If the Department
 determines that an error did occur and the law allows relief, the Department will
 relieve the Bidder of the responsibilities of award and release the Bidder of the
 obligations under the proposal guarantee. If the Department determines that an
 error did not occur or that the law does not allow relief, the Department may
 award the contract and if the Bidder refuses to execute the contract, the Bidder
 shall forfeit its proposal guaranty in accordance with Section 103.07, “Failure
 to Execute Contract.”
 103.02 AWARD OF CONTRACT
 If the Department awards a contract, the Department will select the responsible
 Bidder with the lowest total sum bid and a proposal that complies with the proposal
 package. The Department will make an award no more than 30 calendar days after
 the bid opening, unless both parties agree in writing to an extension, and will notify the successful Bidder by providing a contract, contract bond form, and other
 required documents to be returned in accordance with Section 103.06, “Execution
 and Approval of Contract.”
 Submit an initial schedule of proposed progress on Proposed Progress Chart (SFN
 7721) within 10 business days after the bid opening. The Proposed Progress Chart
 shall meet all time and scheduling requirements in the proposal package.
 The Department will not execute the contract with a Bidder that does not have a
 contractor’s license in accordance with Section 102.02, “Contractor’s License.”
 For foreign (out-of-State) corporations, obtain a certificate of authority to do business in the State from the Secretary of State’s Office. The Department will not
 28
 
 103.05 B.2
 
 execute the contract with a foreign corporation that does not have this certificate
 of authority.
 If the successful Bidder fails to submit the Proposed Progress Chart or fails to obtain a contractor’s license or a certificate of authority to do business in the State, the
 Department will cancel the award, and the Bidder will forfeit the proposal guaranty.
 103.03 CANCELLATION OF AWARD
 The Department reserves the right to cancel the award of any contract before execution without liability.
 103.04 RELEASE OF PROPOSAL GUARANTY
 After the Department compares the proposals, the Department will release the Bidders of all obligations under the proposal guaranties, except for the responsible Bidders with the three lowest total sums bid. The Department will release the Bidders
 with the three lowest total sums bid of all obligations under the proposal guaranties
 as follows:
 A. After the Department executes a contract, or
 B. If the Department approves a request to withdraw a proposal in accordance with
 Section 103.01, “Consideration of Proposals.”
 If the Department allows a certified check or cashier’s check in accordance with
 Section 102.09, “Proposal Guaranty,” the Department will return those proposal
 guaranties in accordance with State law.
 103.05 CONTRACT BOND
 A. General.
 Obtain from a responsible surety a contract bond in an amount equal to the original amount of the contract. On the form provided by the Department, submit to
 the Department proof of contract bond in accordance with Section 103.06, “Execution and Approval of Contract.” If the contract bond is voided or becomes
 no longer in force before final acceptance, immediately notify the Department,
 obtain another contract bond in an amount equal to the original, and submit to the
 Department proof of the contract bond on the form provided by the Department.
 B. Payment.
 After both parties execute the contract, the Department will pay for the contract
 bond as follows:
 1. Submit to the Engineer a written request for payment for the “Contract
 Bond” contract item. Include, with the request, a receipted invoice from the
 surety showing the amount paid for the contract bond and the date of payment.
 2. The Department will pay the Contractor the contract unit price for the “Contract Bond” contract item or the paid invoiced amount, whichever is less. If
 the contract unit price is greater than the paid invoiced amount, the Department will pay the difference in the final progressive estimate.
 
 29
 
 103.06
 
 103.06 EXECUTION AND APPROVAL OF CONTRACT
 Return to the Department the signed contract, proof of contract bond, and other
 required documents within 15 calendar days after the notice of award. The Department will review the signed contract, proof of the contract bond, and other required
 documents. If the Department approves, the Director will sign the contract making
 it fully executed and binding on the two parties.
 If another party is providing funding for the project, the Department may not approve the contract until the Department receives concurrence from the participating
 party.
 103.07 FAILURE TO EXECUTE CONTRACT
 If the successful Bidder fails to return a signed contract, proof of the contract bond,
 and other required documents in accordance with Section 103.06, “Execution and
 Approval of Contract,” the Department may cancel the award and the successful
 Bidder forfeits its proposal guaranty to the Department. The Department may then
 award the contract to the responsible Bidder with the next lowest total sum bid or
 re-advertise the project.
 103.08 ESCROW OF BID DOCUMENTATION
 A. General.
 If the bid item list contains an “Escrow of Bid Documentation” contract item, the
 low Bidder shall provide a legible copy of its bid documentation for storage at a
 depository chosen by the Bidder and approved by the Department. The successful Bidder may choose one of the following depositories: a banking institution,
 other bonded document storage facility, or in a secure location at the Department’s
 headquarters.
 For subcontracts at any tier equal to or greater than $500,000, obtain from the
 subcontractor all bid documentation used to prepare the subcontractor’s bid for
 the portion of the work reflected in the subcontract. The subcontractor’s bid documentation requirements shall be the same as for the Contractor. Submit to the
 Department the bid documentation and affidavit in a separate sealed container,
 including the subcontractor’s name and address on the container, with the Prime
 Contractor’s Request to Sublet (SFN 5682) in accordance with Section 108.01,
 “Subletting of Contract.
 B. Affidavit.
 Provide an affidavit with the bid documentation. The affidavit shall be signed
 by the Bidder or by an individual authorized to sign for the Bidder in accordance
 with Section 102.07.A, “Preparation of Proposal, General,” and listing each enclosed document, including the author, date, nature, and subject matter of each
 document. The affidavit shall attest that the signer has personally examined all
 bid documentation, that the affidavit lists all bid documentation, and that all bid
 documentation is included in the submission to the Department.
 C. Submittal and Return of Bid Documentation.
 Submit the affidavit and bid documentation to the Department within 5 business
 days after the bid opening. Place the affidavit and bid documentation in a sealed
 
 30
 
 103.08 E
 
 container and clearly mark the container with the following:
 1. The label, “Bid Documentation,”
 2. The Bidder’s name and address,
 3. The date of submittal, or
 4. The NDDOT project number and PCN.
 If the responsive Bidder with the lowest total sum bid has already submitted the
 bid documentation and the Department rejects that Bidder’s proposal or cancels
 the award, the Department will return the bid documentation. If the Department
 awards to the next lowest responsive Bidder, the Department will notify that
 Bidder to submit its affidavit and bid documentation. The next lowest responsive Bidder shall submit the affidavit and bid documentation within 5 business
 days after the date of notification by the Department. If the Department rejects
 this proposal and subsequent ones or cancels this award or subsequent ones,
 the above procedures will continue until the Department awards, approves, and
 executes a contract.
 D. Duration and Use.
 After the Department approves and executes the contract, the Department and
 the Contractor will jointly deliver the sealed container and affidavit to the depository for placement in a safety deposit box or other secure accommodation.
 The depository must be located in Bismarck, North Dakota, unless otherwise
 approved by the Department. Provide escrow instructions to the depository consistent with this section.
 The agreement with the depository will reflect that the bid documentation and
 affidavit will remain in escrow during the life of the contract, until the Contractor notifies the Department of intent to file a claim in accordance with Section
 104.04 “Notice of Intention to File a Claim (NOI)” or the Contractor initiates
 litigation or arbitration against the Department related to the contract. Notification of the Contractor’s intention to file a claim, or initiation of litigation or arbitration against the Department, will be sufficient grounds for the Department
 to obtain the release and custody of the bid documentation. The Department
 may open sealed escrowed bid documentation submitted by a subcontractor if
 it is related to the issues detailed on the NOI, or if the investigation into the issue indicates that relevant information may be found in subcontractor escrow
 documents. If the Contractor has not submitted notification of intent to file a
 claim or initiated litigation or arbitration, and the required statutory time to file
 a claim has elapsed since the submission of the final estimate, the Department
 will instruct the depository to release the sealed container to the Contractor
 In accordance with the affidavit attesting that the sealed container placed in
 escrow contains all of the materials relied upon to prepare the proposal, the
 Contractor waives its right to use any bid documentation other than that placed
 in escrow in any claim or litigation arising out of this contract.
 E. Refusal or Failure to Provide Bid Documentation.
 If the successful Bidder fails to provide the bid documentation in accordance
 with Section 103.08.C, “Submittal and Return of Bid Documentation,” the De-
 
 31
 
 103.08 E
 
 partment will reject the proposal or cancel the award, and the Bidder will forfeit
 the proposal guaranty.
 If the Contractor fails to submit a subcontractor’s bid documentation, the Department may withhold progressive estimates.
 F. Confidentiality of Bid Documentation.
 The bid documentation and affidavit in escrow are and will remain the property
 of the Contractor. The Department has no interest in or right to the bid documentation, unless the Department receives a notification of the intention to file claim
 from the Contractor or litigation ensues between the Department and Contractor. In the event of a claim or litigation, the bid documentation and affidavit
 will become the property of the Department. The Department will return to the
 Contractor the bid documentation and any copies made by the Department at
 the conclusion of litigation or once the Contractor signs the final payment statement.
 G. Payment.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for the payment of the depository rent. After
 the Department has deposited the bid documentation and the two parties have
 executed the contract, the Department will pay the Contractor the contract unit
 price for the “Escrow of Bid Documentation” contract item.
 The contract unit price for the “Escrow of Bid Documentation” contract item
 includes the costs of all data compilation, container, depository rent, and any
 other costs associated with the escrow, including escrow of subcontractor bid
 documentation. The Department will not charge a depository rent for the use of
 its facility.
 
 32
 
 104.02 B
 
 SECTION 104
 SCOPE OF WORK
 104.01 INTENT OF CONTRACT
 The intent of the contract is to state the roles, responsibilities, and obligations of the
 Department and Contractor regarding the construction, execution, and completion
 of the work. Provide all resources required to complete the work and execute the
 work in accordance with the contract.
 104.02 CONTRACT REVISIONS
 A. General.
 The Department may revise the contract as necessary to satisfactorily complete
 the project at any time between the date of contract execution and the date the
 Department issues the final payment statement to the Contractor. Contract revisions neither invalidate the contract nor release the surety. Perform the work
 as revised. Proceed with the revised work only when directed by the Engineer;
 continue with all work unaffected by the revision.
 If circumstances arise that may necessitate a contract revision, immediately notify the Engineer in accordance with Section 104.03, “Contractor Requested
 Contract Revisions.” Failure to provide notice as specified in Section 104.03
 constitutes a waiver of entitlement to compensation or a time extension and releases the Department from responsibility for providing compensation or a time
 extension for any related claims filed under Section 104.04, “Notice of Intention
 to File a Claim (NOI),” and Section 104.05, “Claims for Adjustment.”
 If the Department revises the contract the Department will determine compensation in accordance with Section 109.03, “Compensation for Contract Revisions,” and a time extension in accordance with Section 108.06, “Determination
 of and Extensions to the Contract Time.” The Engineer will issue a change order
 to document the nature of the contract revision, including any determined compensation, any time extension, or both.
 Sections 104.02 B, C, and D contain wording mandated by FHWA. As the terms
 “modification,” “change,” “adjustment,” or “alteration” are used in them they
 shall mean a contract revision.
 B. Differing Site Conditions.
 During the progress of the work, if subsurface or latent physical conditions differing materially from those indicated in the contract are encountered at the site
 or if unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature, differing materially
 from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the
 work provided for in the contract, are encountered at the site, notify the Engineer of the specific differing conditions in accordance with Section 104.03,
 “Contractor Requested Contract Revisions,” before disturbing the site or performing the affected work.
 Upon written notification, the Engineer will investigate the conditions, and if
 the Engineer determines that the conditions materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time required for the performance of any work
 33
 
 104.02 B
 
 under the contract, an adjustment, excluding anticipated profits, will be made
 and the contract modified in writing accordingly. The Engineer will notify the
 Contractor of the determination whether or not an adjustment of the contract is
 warranted.
 No contract adjustment which results in a benefit to the Contractor will be allowed unless the Contractor has provided the required written notice.
 No contract adjustment will be allowed on work not affected by the changed
 conditions.
 C. Significant Changes in the Character of Work.
 The Engineer reserves the right to make, in writing, at any time during the work,
 such changes in quantities and such alterations in the work as are necessary to
 satisfactorily complete the project. Such changes in quantities and alterations
 shall not invalidate the contract nor release the surety, and the Contractor agrees
 to perform the work as altered.
 If the alterations or changes in quantities significantly change the character of
 the work under the contract, whether such alterations or changes are in themselves significant changes to the character of the work or by affecting other
 work cause such other work to become significantly different in character, an
 adjustment, excluding anticipated profit, will be made to the contract. The basis
 for the adjustment should be agreed upon prior to the performance of the work.
 If a basis cannot be agreed upon, then an adjustment will be made either for or
 against the Contractor in such amount as the Engineer may determine to be fair
 and equitable.
 If the alterations or changes in quantities do not significantly change the character of the work to be performed under the contract, the altered work will be paid
 for as provided elsewhere in the contract.
 The term “significant change” shall be construed to apply only to the following
 circumstances:
 1. When the character of the work as altered differs materially in kind or nature
 from that involved or included in the original proposed construction; or
 2. When a major item of work, as defined in Section 101.04 “Definitions,” is
 increased in excess of 125 percent or decreased below 75 percent of the
 original contract quantity. Any allowance for an increase in quantity shall
 apply only to that portion in excess of 125 percent of original contract item
 quantity, or in case of a decrease below 75 percent, to the actual amount of
 work performed.
 When an adjustment to the unit price is made due to a decrease in the original
 contract quantity to below 75 percent of the original quantity, the total payment
 made will not exceed the amount which would have been paid for 75 percent of
 the orginal quantity.
 If the Contractor believes an alteration in the work is a significant change that
 necessitates a contract revision, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer in accordance with Section 104.03, “Contractor Requested Contract Revisions.”
 
 34
 
 104.03 A.1
 
 If the Contractor intends to request a contract revision for a significant change
 in the work, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer in accordance with Section
 104.03, “Contractor Requested Contract Revisions.”
 D. Suspension of Work Ordered by the Engineer.
 If the performance of all or any portion of the work is suspended or delayed by
 the Engineer in writing for an unreasonable period of time (not originally anticipated, customary, or inherent to the construction industry) and the Contractor
 believes that additional compensation and/or contract time is due as a result of
 such suspension or delay, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer in accordance
 with Section 104.03, “Contractor Requested Contract Revisions,” immediately
 after receipt of the notice to resume work.
 Upon receipt, the Engineer will evaluate the Contractor’s request. If the Engineer agrees that the cost and/or time required for the performance of the contract
 has increased as a result of such suspension and the suspension was caused by
 conditions beyond the control of and not the fault of the Contractor, its suppliers, or subcontractors at any approved tier, and not caused by weather, the
 Engineer will make an adjustment (excluding profit) and modify the contract in
 writing accordingly. The Contractor will be notified of the Engineer’s determination whether or not an adjustment of the contract is warranted.
 No contract adjustment will be allowed unless the Contractor has submitted the
 request for adjustment within the time prescribed.
 No contract adjustment will be allowed under this clause to the extent that performance would have been suspended or delayed by any other cause, or for
 which an adjustment is provided or excluded under any other term or condition
 of this contract.
 E. Extra Work.
 If the Contractor believes that the Department has required the Contractor to
 perform extra work that necessitates a contract revision the Contractor shall provide notice in accordance with Section 104.03, “Contractor Requested Contract
 Revisions.”
 F. Eliminated Items.
 The Department may eliminate a contract item partially or completely. If the
 Contractor believes that such elimination will necessitate a contract revision, the
 Contractor shall provide notice in accordance with Section 104.03, “Contractor
 Requested Contract Revisions.” The Department will reimburse the Contractor
 for costs incurred by the Contractor before notification of elimination in accordance with Section 109.03, “Compensation for Contract Revisions.”
 104.03 CONTRACTOR REQUESTED CONTRACT REVISIONS
 A. Contractor Request, Work In Progress.
 1. Contractor Request.
 If the basis for a contract revision does not become apparent until the Contractor has commenced work affected by the circumstance and it is not feasible to stop the work, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Engineer
 that the work is continuing and that written notification of the intent to make
 35
 
 104.03 A.1
 
 claim for additional compensation as specified in Section 104.04, “Notice Of
 Intention to File a Claim (NOI)” will be submitted within 10 calendar days.
 If the request includes an extension to the contract time, submit a Contractor
 Request for Extension of Contract Time (SFN 14461) and follow the requirements of Section 108.06 B, “Extensions to the Contract Time.”
 2. Record Keeping.
 For work that is continuing, provide the Engineer with updates of costs
 or delays related to the claim issues in accordance with Section 109.03 E,
 “Force Account,” and Section 109.03 F, “Delay Costs.”
 If the request includes an extension to the contract time, submit a Contractor
 Request for Extension of Contract Time (SFN 14461) and follow the requirements of Section 108.06 B, “Extensions to the Contract Time.”
 The Engineer and Contractor shall maintain records in accordance with Section 109.03 E, “Force Account,” and Section 109.03 F, “Delay Costs” of all
 costs and delays that may constitute a contract revision. Such record keeping
 shall start when the Engineer receives the Contractor’s notice or when the
 Engineer orders the Contractor to begin work.
 B. Contractor Request, Work Not Started.
 If the Contractor believes the Contractor is entitled to additional compensation, the Contractor shall, prior to beginning the work which the claim will be
 based upon, notify the Engineer in writing of the intent to make claim for additional compensation as specified in Section 104.04, “Notice of Intention to File
 a Claim (NOI).” Do not begin the work associated with the notice until ordered
 by the Engineer.
 For work that is beginning under direction of the Engineer, provide the Engineer
 with updates of costs and delays related to the claim issues in accordance with
 Section 109.03 E, “Force Account,” and Section 109.03 F, “Delay Costs.”
 104.04 NOTICE OF INTENTION TO FILE A CLAIM (NOI)
 A. Submission of an NOI.
 Follow the procedures specified in Section 104.03 A.1, “Contractor Request” or
 104.03 B, “Contractor Request, Work Not Started,” before submitting an NOI.
 Within 10 calendar days of providing the notice required in Section 104.03 A.1,
 “Contractor Request” or immediately, as required in Section 104.03 B, “Contractor Request, Work Not Started,” notify the Engineer of the intention to file a
 claim by submitting a signed Notice of Intention to File a Claim (SFN 16743).
 Define the basis for the compensation and time extension requested for each
 claim issue. Failure to notify the Engineer properly of the intention to file a
 claim constitutes a waiver of a claim for compensation or a time extension and
 releases the Department from responsibility for providing compensation or a
 time extension for any related claims filed under Section 104.04, “Notice of
 Intention to File a Claim (NOI),” and Section 104.05, “Claims for Adjustment.”

 104.07 C.1
 
 104.07 VALUE ENGINEERING CHANGE PROPOSALS
 A. General.
 The Department will consider written value engineering change proposals
 (VECPs) that would benefit the Department and require a revision to the contract. The Department encourages VECPs for any aspect of a project but reserves the right to reject any submission with or without review. The Department will notify the Contractor in writing of its decision to accept or reject a
 VECP in whole or in part. This decision is final and not subject to appeal.
 Do not base bid prices on the anticipated approval of a VECP. If the Department
 rejects a VECP, perform the work at the contract unit prices and as required by
 the contract.
 The Department will notify the Contractor promptly in writing if the response
 date indicated on a VECP allows insufficient time for review. The Department
 bears no liability for costs or delays based on the Department’s failure to respond by the date indicated on the VECP.
 The Department bears no liability for costs or delays resulting from the rejection
 of a VECP including; development costs, loss of anticipated profits, increased
 material costs, labor costs, or any other cost.
 The Department retains the right to use, duplicate, or disclose, in whole or in
 part, any information needed to implement a VECP. The Department also retains the right to use, in whole or in part, any accepted VECP on other Department projects without obligation to the Contractor.
 The Contractor may restrict the Department’s right to use or disclose information submitted with a VECP if the Department rejects the VECP. Propose such
 restrictions in writing with the VECP.
 B. Preliminary VECP Meeting.
 Meet with the Engineer before formally submitting a VECP to discuss the proposed revision to the contract and its potential benefits.
 C. Conditions.
 The Department will only consider a VECP when the following conditions are
 met:
 1. The two parties have executed the contract in accordance with Section 103,
 “Award and Execution of Contract;”
 2. The likely benefit is sufficient to warrant review and processing.
 3. The Contractor submits the VECP. The Department invites and encourages
 VECPs provided by subcontractors but will only consider those submitted
 through the Contractor; and
 4. The Contractor clearly labels the VECP as a “Value Engineering Change
 Proposal” or “VECP.”
 The Department will reject a VECP that has any of the following characteristics:
 1. Requires excessive time or cost for review.
 
 41
 
 104.07 C.2
 
 2. Results in an increase to the total contract amount.
 3. Contains revisions to the contract that the Department has previously considered and rejected.
 4. Proposes a lesser-quality material.
 5. Contains revisions to the contract that the Department has previously accepted on another Department project.
 6. Impairs essential functions or characteristics of a project, including service life, economy of operation, maintenance, appearance, safety, or other
 means of measuring the Department’s cost or risk related to the performance of the project.
 7. Proposes cost reductions resulting from corrections to contract errors identified by the Contractor.
 8. Proposes the substitution of one contract item for another contract item.
 9. Contains proposed revisions that are inconsistent with the Department’s
 design policies and criteria for the contract.
 10. Proposes the use of an aggregate source other than those identified in the
 Contract, or proposes the reduction of bitumen content by switching aggregate sources. The Contractor may use aggregate sources other than those
 identified in the contract, but the Department will not consider this type of
 proposal to be a VECP.
 11. Any VECP containing experimental features.
 12. The Department will not consider a VECP if the contract contains equivalent options.
 D. Submitting a VECP.
 To submit a VECP, provide two copies of the following to the Engineer:
 1. A cover letter indicating the submission is a VECP.
 2. A description of the difference between the existing contract and the proposed change and the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each.
 Where applicable, include effects on service life, economy of operations,
 maintenance, appearance, and safety.
 3. Separate cost estimates for the affected parts of the contract, including the
 performance bond, with and without the proposed changes. Break the estimates down by pay item numbers, and indicate quantity increases or decreases and deleted pay items. Use current Department pay item names and
 numbers to identify proposed work not covered by the existing contract. In
 preparing the estimates, include overhead and profit within each affected pay
 item.
 4. Preliminary drawings and specifications describing the proposed changes.
 Include an itemization of details, sheets, design standards, and specifications
 requiring changes or additions if the Department adopted the VECP.
 
 42

 changes to engineered-elements by computations sealed by a professional
 engineer in the appropriate discipline. Provide a discussion of how these
 changes can be accomplished, and assess their effect on other contract elements.
 6. The date by which the Department must execute a change order adopting the
 VECP to obtain the maximum benefit.
 7. A statement detailing the VECP’s effect on the scheduled completion date.
 8. A description of previous use or testing of the same or a similar VECP and
 the circumstances and results. If submitted on another Department project,
 indicate the date, project number, and the action taken by the Department.
 9. Provide any additional information requested by the Department within 10
 business days of the date of request. The Department will consider the Contractor’s failure to do so as cause for rejection.
 E. Payment.
 The Department will use a change order to incorporate changes resulting from
 an accepted and adopted VECP and to authorize payment. The Department will
 determine and make payment as follows:
 1. As appropriate, the Department will change contract item quantities, add
 new contract items, eliminate contract items, or change the unit prices for
 contract items, as agreed.
 2. The Department will pay the Contractor 50 percent of the net savings realized, calculated as the difference between the total contract amount with and
 without the VECP.

 SECTION 105
 CONTROL OF WORK
 105.01 GENERAL
 The Contractor is responsible for the successful performance of the work as required by the contract, whether the Contractor’s personnel are performing the work
 or not.
 The Engineer’s decisions will be final on all questions regarding the quality and
 acceptability of materials furnished, work performed, rate of work progress, interpretation of the contract, and the acceptable fulfillment of the contract.
 105.02 CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS
 Keep one complete copy of the contract at the project during the performance of
 the work.
 Give the work the constant attention necessary to facilitate progress. Cooperate
 fully with the Engineer.
 Submit all project submittals and correspondence to the Engineer. If the contract
 allows the Contractor to correspond directly with other Department representatives,
 the Contractor shall submit a copy of all such submittals and correspondence to the
 Engineer at the same time the correspondence is submitted to the other Department
 representative.
 Before starting the work, designate a qualified superintendent and notify the Engineer of the superintendent’s contact information in writing. If replacing the superintendent, immediately notify the Engineer in writing. To be considered qualified the
 superintendent must be:
 A. A responsible employee of the Contractor;
 B. Capable of reading and understanding the contract;
 C. Present at the project site while work is underway, including work by subcontractors, unless otherwise approved by the Engineer;
 D. Authorized to:
 1. Represent and act for the Contractor;
 2. Attend project meetings, when required by the contract;
 3. Execute orders and directions of the Engineer; and
 4. Ensure subcontractors are performing work in accordance with the contract
 requirements.
 105.03 COOPERATION WITH UTILITY OWNERS
 A. General.
 Utility facilities shown on the Plans, if any, are for reference purposes only and
 may not constitute an exhaustive representation of all utility facilities within
 
 44
 
 105.03 C
 
 the project. Notify the North Dakota One Call System (811) before starting the
 work, so they may locate and mark all utility facilities within the project.
 Comply with Chapter 49-23 of the NDCC in determining the location of underground utilities.
 Locate Department-owned, publicly-owned, and privately-owned utility facilities, whether on or off the One Call System.
 Notify all utility owners of the anticipated project schedule within two weeks
 of receiving notice to proceed. Coordinate adjustments and relocations with affected utility owners. The Contractor, the Engineer, and the utility owners shall
 agree to a schedule of the work and the adjustments and relocations before beginning the work.
 If the Contractor’s operations have the potential to damage utility facilities identified in the contract to remain in place during the work, including operations
 adjacent to these utility facilities, the Contractor shall account for and protect
 the utility facilities. Before starting the work, coordinate the protections with the
 utility owner.
 Cooperate with utility owners in relocating and adjusting utility facilities to
 minimize interruption to service and duplication of work by utility owners.
 The Department will provide utility conflict plans, if available. Utility conflict
 plans are not part of the contract and are for information purposes only.
 If the Engineer determines that adjustment or relocation of utility facilities is
 necessary to accommodate construction, the Engineer will arrange and coordinate the work with the owner if the contract does not otherwise provide for such
 work. This does not relieve the Contractor of any liability that may arise under
 the provisions of the NDCC.
 B. Scheduling.
 In order to minimize interference with traffic operations, the Contractor, Engineer, and utility owner shall agree to a detailed schedule before starting work.
 If the contract requires a utility coordination meeting, arrange the meeting with
 the utility owners and the Engineer to occur no later than two weeks after the
 notice to proceed. At the meeting, provide an agenda and a tentative construction schedule for planning utility relocations and adjustments; after the meeting,
 publish minutes and distribute a copy to all meeting attendees.
 C. Damage and Interruptions.
 If the Contractor causes damage to utility facilities, the Contractor is responsible
 for the costs of restoring or repairing the damaged utility facility to a condition
 equal to or better than the condition existing before the damage occurred. Immediately notify the utility owner of the damage or, if the owner is unknown,
 the One Call System. Do not conceal, attempt to conceal, or make repairs to the
 utility facilities until approved by the utility owner. If this damage causes interruption to utility service, continuously coordinate with the utility owner until the
 service is fully restored.
 Before starting work that affects a fire hydrant, coordinate with the local fire
 authority to determine if provisions need to be in place before starting the work.
 45
 
 105.03 C
 
 If provisions are necessary, obtain the approval of the local fire authority before
 beginning the work affecting the fire hydrant.
 The Department will not pay the Contractor for the costs to restore or repair
 damaged utility facilities and will consider any delays resulting from this damage to be non-excusable in accordance with Section 108.06, “Determination of
 and Extensions to the Contract Time.”
 105.04 COOPERATION BETWEEN CONTRACTORS
 The Department reserves the right to contract for and perform other work on or
 near the site of work. Coordinate the work and cooperate with the contractor for
 the other work.
 The Contractor is responsible for all liability, financial or otherwise, in connection
 with the contract, and shall save the Department harmless from damages or claims
 resulting from inconvenience, delay, or loss due to the Contractor’s failure to coordinate the work or cooperate with the contractor for the other work.
 If a conflict occurs between the Contractor and the contractor for the other work, the
 Engineer will provide direction.
 105.05 COORDINATION OF THE CONTRACT DOCUMENTS
 Each contract document is an essential part of the contract; a requirement occurring
 in one is as binding as though occurring in all. The Department intends the contract
 documents to be complementary and to describe and provide for a complete work.
 In case of discrepancy between the contract documents, use the following order of
 precedence (each contract document is in descending order of precedence, for example, addenda take precedence over all the other contract documents):
 A. Addenda.
 B. Special provisions (for the purpose of this list, any other provisions in the request for proposals that are not part of the other contract documents in this list
 are considered special provisions).
 C. Project plans.
 D. Supplemental specifications.
 E. Standard drawings.
 F. Standard specifications.
 For dimensions shown on the standard drawings and project plans, calculated dimensions take precedence over scaled dimensions.
 If a discrepancy, conflict, error, omission, or ambiguity exists in the contract documents, immediately notify the Engineer. Do not take advantage of a discrepancy,
 conflict, error, omission, or ambiguity. The Engineer will make corrections and interpretations necessary to fulfill the intent of the contract.
 105.06 CHARACTER OF WORKERS, METHODS, AND EQUIPMENT
 A. Resources.
 46
 
 105.06 D.3.b
 
 Provide sufficient resources to complete the work as required by the contract
 and within the contract time.
 B. Removal of Personnel.
 If any person employed on the project, whether a Contractor employee or not,
 is intemperate, prejudiced, abusive, or disorderly, the Engineer may direct the
 Contractor in writing to discharge the person from the work. Re-employ this
 person on the project only with the Engineer’s approval. If the Contractor fails
 to remove a person as directed by the Engineer or to provide sufficient personnel
 for the proper prosecution of the work, the Engineer may suspend the work by
 written notice until the Contractor complies.
 C. Alternative Methods and Equipment.
 If the contract specifies the methods and equipment to perform the work, alternative methods and equipment may only be used with the approval of the Engineer.
 Submit a written request with a full description of the alternative methods and
 equipment being proposed and an explanation of reasons for making the change.
 If the Engineer approves of the alternative method or equipment, produce work
 in conformity with the contract requirements. The Engineer’s approval does not
 change the basis of payment for the contract items involved or the contract time.
 If the Engineer determines the work produced does not meet the contract requirements, discontinue alternative method or equipment and complete the remaining work with the specified methods and equipment. Repair or remove and
 replace the deficient work to the specified quality.
 D. Welders.
 1. General.
 Before performing the work, all welders must obtain the applicable AWS
 qualification and the certification from the Department.
 2. Qualifications.
 Welders performing work as specified in Section 616, “Structural Steel,”
 and Section 622, “Piling,” must meet the qualification requirements of AASHTO/AWS D1.5, “Bridge Welding Code.”
 All other welders performing work on steel must meet the qualification requirements of AWS D1.1, “Structural Welding Code – Steel.”
 Welders performing work on aluminum must meet the qualification requirements of AWS D1.2, “Structural Welding Code – Aluminum.”
 3. Certifications.
 To obtain Department certification, submit the applicable qualifications and
 test results to the Materials and Research Engineer at least two weeks before
 the welder starts work on the project. The test results must meet all of the
 following conditions:
 a. Witnessed and signed by an AWS Certified Welder Inspector (CWI).
 b. Conform to the example form for Welder, Welding Operator, or Tack
 Welder Qualification Test Record provided in AWS D1.1.
 
 47
 
 105.06 D.3.c
 
 c. Include the welder’s name, welder’s employee ID number from payroll,
 date tested, CWI name, testing firm name, and the test results.
 If the qualifications and test results are acceptable, the Materials and Research Engineer will certify the welder.
 The Department certification is active for 1 year and is eligible for up to three
 1-year extensions. To obtain an extension, submit a written request to the
 Materials and Research Engineer with a signed statement that the welder has
 been actively engaged in performing the required welds within the previous
 6 months. The Department may require a requalification test at any time.
 105.07 CONFORMANCE WITH THE CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS
 A. Performance of Work.
 Perform the work in conformance with the contract requirements.
 Perform the work to produce a product that is uniform in character and to conform to the required target value or tolerance range. This tolerance range is to
 accommodate occasional, unavoidable, and minor variations from the median
 zone.
 When the contract contains the word or phrase “uniform,” “uniformly,” “in a
 uniform manner,” or an equivalent to describe a required result or procedure and
 no test is specified, the degree of uniformity will be that which is obtained for
 quality work meeting industry standards.
 If a portion of the work fails to meet the contract requirements but is adequate
 to serve the design purpose, the Engineer may accept work in place and process
 a contract price adjustment for that portion of the work. If the Engineer accepts
 the work:
 – The Engineer will apply the contract price adjustments included in the contract; or
 – If no contract price adjustments are included in the contract, the Engineer
 will determine a contract price adjustment factor and issue a contract revision documenting the basis of acceptance and the revision to the payment.
 If the Engineer determines that a portion of the work does not conform with the
 contract and does not produce work that serves the design purpose, remove and
 replace or repair the work at no expense to the Department.
 B. Removing Unacceptable or Unauthorized Work.
 Remove and replace unacceptable work before final acceptance.
 The Contractor will not receive compensation for work performed contrary to
 the Engineer’s instructions, work beyond the construction limits, and work performed without the Engineer’s permission. The Engineer may order this work
 removed, restored, or replaced at no additional cost to the Department. If the
 Contractor fails to remove, restore, or replace this work as ordered by the Engineer, the Engineer may have these actions performed by others and deduct the
 cost from monies due or to become due to the Contractor.

 105.10
 
 105.10 CONSTRUCTION STAKING
 The Engineer will provide and set construction stakes and marks that establish
 lines, slopes, grades, and other engineering details, and provide the Contractor with
 all necessary information relating to them. The Department is responsible for the
 accuracy of construction stakes and marks established by the Engineer.
 Notify the Engineer at least 14 calendar days before starting the work and provide
 a description of the staking necessary to start the work. After the work has begun,
 notify the Engineer at least 48 hours of the need for staking, excluding Saturdays
 and holidays, and provide a description of the needed staking. The Department
 is not responsible for delays in setting stakes if the Engineer does not receive the
 required notice.
 Before starting the work, examine all stakes, measurements, and marks to determine their intent.
 Protect and preserve all stakes and marks. If the Contractor destroys or disturbs
 stakes or marks, the Department will repair or replace the stakes and marks and
 will deduct the cost of repair or replacement from monies due or to become due the
 Contractor.
 105.11 INSPECTION OF WORK
 All material, the production of material, and each part or detail of the work is subject to inspection. Provide the Engineer access to all parts of the work and provide
 information and assistance as required by the contract to allow the Engineer to
 perform a complete and detailed inspection.
 Remove or uncover portions of the work as requested by the Engineer. After examination, restore the work to the standard required by the contract. If the work
 is acceptable, the Department will pay for the costs of uncovering, removing, and
 restoring the work in accordance with Section 104.02, “Contract Revisions.” If the
 work is unacceptable, uncover, remove, and restore the unacceptable work. The
 Department will not pay the Contractor for the costs to uncover, remove, and restore
 unacceptable work.
 Any work performed or materials used without inspection by the Engineer may be
 ordered removed or uncovered and replaced at the Contractor’s expense, unless the
 Engineer failed to inspect after having been given notice that the work was to be
 performed.
 When any unit of government, political subdivision, utility owner, or railroad company is to pay a portion of the cost of the work covered by this contract, its respective representatives also have the right to inspect the work. This act of inspecting
 does not make the unit of government or political subdivision, the utility owner, or
 the railroad company a party to the contract, and shall not interfere with the rights
 of either party to the contract.
 105.12 MAINTENANCE DURING CONSTRUCTION
 Maintain the project site in a satisfactory condition until the project is accepted.
 
 52
 
 105.14
 
 If the contract requires the placement of material on or the use of an existing feature,
 such as subgrade, base course, pavement, or structure, maintain the existing feature.
 If the Contractor fails to maintain the project site properly, the Engineer will notify
 the Contractor and the Contractor shall remedy the improper maintenance within 24
 hours of receipt of the notice. If the Contractor fails to remedy the improper maintenance within 24 hours, the Department may proceed to maintain the project site,
 and will deduct the costs of the maintenance work from monies due or to become
 due the Contractor.
 The cost of maintaining the work and project site during construction until acceptance is included in the contract unit prices of the contract items.
 105.13 PROTECTION OF THE WORK
 Protect project work from damage until the Engineer gives partial acceptance or
 project acceptance to the work as defined in Section 105.15, “Acceptance.”
 Until acceptance, rebuild, repair, or restore damage to the work at no cost to the
 Department, except as noted in this section.
 If the damage is to items that will be permanently incorporated in to the work and
 are not substantially complete and is a result of acts of the public enemy, acts of
 government entities, or acts of God, the Contractor shall rebuild, repair or restore
 the work and the Department will pay the Contractor for the work in accordance
 with Section 109.03, “Compensation for Contract Revisions.”
 If the damage is to work that is substantially complete and is caused by public
 traffic, identify the party that is responsible for the damage, pursue all reasonable
 means to recover the costs of the damage, and repair the damage to the work. When
 the Contractor cannot recover the costs by reasonable means, the Department will
 pay the Contractor for the unrecovered costs as specified in Section 109.03, “Compensation for Contract Revisions.”
 If damage occurs after acceptance and before the Contractor signs the final payment
 statement, the Engineer may direct the Contractor to rebuild, repair, or restore the
 damaged work and the Department will pay the Contractor for the costs to rebuild,
 repair, or restore the damaged work in accordance with Section 104.02, “Contract
 Revisions.”
 105.14 OPENING TO TRAFFIC
 If the contract provides for detours or road closures and the Contractor closed the
 road to traffic, the Engineer may order the Contractor to open certain sections of the
 road to traffic. Opening these sections does not constitute acceptance of the work or
 a waiver of any contract provisions. On those sections opened to traffic, the Department will pay the Contractor for the costs of maintaining the roadway for traffic in
 accordance with Section 104.02, “Contract Revisions.”
 If the Contractor is late in completing portions of the work according to the contract
 or progress schedule, the Engineer will notify the Contractor of the time period for
 completing these features. The Engineer may order all or a portion of the project
 opened to traffic if the Contractor fails to complete or make a reasonable effort to
 
 53
 
 105.14
 
 complete the late work. The Contractor remains liable or responsible for maintaining the work and shall conduct the remaining construction operations with minimal
 interference to traffic at no cost to the Department.
 105.15 ACCEPTANCE
 After completion of the work or a segment of the work, notify the Engineer in writing to request final inspection for partial or project acceptance. Before requesting
 final inspection, remove all garbage, excess materials, temporary work, and equipment from the project or segment. The Engineer will respond to the Contractor’s
 request within 5 business days to coordinate the final inspection of the work.
 Partial acceptance occurs when a segment of the work such as a structure, an interchange, or a section of road is complete and accepted by the Engineer.
 Project acceptance occurs when the project is complete and accepted by the Engineer.
 The Engineer will inspect the work to determine if the Contractor has completed
 the work as required by the contract. The Engineer may require the completion of
 additional items of work related to the segment before issuing partial acceptance
 on a segment of the work. If the Engineer determines the work is complete, the
 inspection will constitute the final inspection and the Engineer will issue written
 acceptance to the Contractor. Acceptance does not void or alter any contract terms.
 If the inspection discloses any unsatisfactory work, the Engineer will provide the
 Contractor with written instructions for correcting the work. Upon correction of the
 work, request another inspection by the Engineer.
 105.16 NO WAIVER OF LEGAL RIGHTS
 Project acceptance does not prevent the Department from correcting any measurement, estimate, or certificate made before or after completion of the work. The Department may recover overpayments from the Contractor, surety, or both. A waiver
 on the part of the Department of any breach of any part of the contract is not a
 waiver of any other breach.
 Without prejudice to the contract terms, maintain liability for latent defects, fraud,
 or such gross mistakes as may amount to fraud, or as regards the Department’s
 rights under any warranty or guaranty.
 105.17 RIGHT OF WAY
 The Department will furnish right of way before the work starts, except as indicated
 in the contract.
 Before damaging or disturbing land monuments or property markers, allow the Engineer to witness or otherwise reference their location.
 
 54
 
 106.01 C.8
 
 SECTION 106
 CONTROL OF MATERIAL
 106.01 GENERAL METHODS OF MATERIALS ACCEPTANCE
 A. General.
 Only use materials that meet the contract requirements. Unless otherwise specified, use new material for the work. Before delivery of the materials, notify the
 Engineer of the proposed source of material.
 The contract may require either or both of the following as the basis for approval
 and acceptance of material:
 1. Sampling, testing, and inspection; and
 2. A Certificate of Compliance.
 If the value of the material is less than $5,000 and the material is not directly
 involved with the safety of a structure or roadway, the Engineer may waive the
 certificate requirement, or accept the material without sampling, testing, and
 inspecting.
 B. Samples, Tests, and Inspection.
 The Engineer will sample, test, and inspect materials in accordance with relevant contract requirements and will provide copies of all test results to the
 Contractor upon request. The Department will not pay for materials found to be
 unacceptable. Remove unacceptable materials at no cost to the Department.
 The Engineer may sample, test, and inspect materials at any time before project
 acceptance, and will accept or reject materials based on inspections or test results.
 If the contract requires the Contractor to perform sampling and testing, the Contractor shall provide the Engineer with copies of all sampling and testing results.
 C. Certificate of Compliance.
 If the contract requires a Certificate of Compliance, submit an original, signed
 Certificate of Compliance that contains the following information:
 1. The name of the Contractor or subcontractor, whichever is receiving the
 material at the project;
 2. The name of the supplier;
 3. The Department’s project number;
 4. The Project Control Number (PCN);
 5. The name and description of the material represented by the certificate;
 6. The quantity of material;
 7. The lot number, bin number, heat number, factory identification, or other
 Engineer approved means of identifying the material;
 8. A reference to the “Spec No.,” “Code No.,” and “Description” of the contract item for which the material is being used;
 55
 
 106.01 C.9
 
 9. A statement certifying that the material meets the relevant contract requirements; and
 10. A signature of a representative with the legal authority to bind the supplier.
 The Department will not include quantities of material represented by a Certificate of Compliance on a progressive estimate until the Contractor has fully met
 the Certificate of Compliance requirements.
 The Department may sample, test, and inspect material represented by a Certificate of Compliance at any time before project acceptance, and will accept or
 reject materials based on inspections or test results.
 106.02 AGGREGATE SOURCES
 A. General.
 The proposal package may contain a materials pit list that references and describes possible sources of materials. The Contractor is not obligated to use any
 of these sources.
 Work pits in a manner that conserves the available aggregate within the source.
 If possible, remove all aggregate material from the working portion of the
 source to eliminate the need to cover any unused material.
 After completing the pit operation and restoring the area to a condition equal to
 or better than the original condition, inspect the pit with the surface owner and
 Engineer. If the surface owner and Engineer find the area acceptable, obtain a
 standard pit release signed by the surface owner and submit the release.
 B. Department Controlled Sources.
 1. General.
 Only use material from Department controlled sources on the materials pit
 list. Request the use of a different Department controlled source before the
 bid opening in accordance with the explanation request requirements in Section 102.05, “Examination of Proposal Package and Project.”
 The materials pit list generally will show the gradation of the material, percent shale, and other characteristics of the material. The Department will
 analyze boring logs using accepted standard practices and calculate values
 based on the test results of samples from the exact locations shown on the
 materials pit list. The Department will not interpret the test results and will
 not be responsible for interpretations of the test results made by the Contractor.
 The water tables shown on the boring logs may change with the seasons.
 Because variations in quantity or quality of material from sample test results
 are usual and expected, and because it is difficult to determine the exact
 quantity or quality of material from an entire source based on sample test
 results, the Department does not warrant the quantity or quality of material
 from Department controlled sources.
 Determine the quantity of equipment, processing, blending, and all other operations required to produce material that meets the relevant contract requirements.
 56
 
 106.02 B.3
 
 If using Department controlled sources, fulfill all obligations imposed on the
 Department required by options or agreements contained in the materials pit
 list.
 Remove all topsoil, to a maximum depth of 1 foot, or as specified in the materials pit list, and stockpile separately from the remaining overburden. After
 removing the aggregate material, replace the stockpiled excavated overburden and topsoil material within the open pit area. Uniformly distribute and
 smoothly grade the topsoil over the entire disturbed area, leaving the pit
 sides as flat as possible. Re-establish the natural direction of surface drainage
 as much as practical.
 2. Department Owned Sources.
 If electing to purchase material from a Department owned source, notify the
 Engineer in writing.
 The Department will charge the Contractor a royalty for all aggregate taken
 from the pit and incorporated into the project. The proposal package will list
 the royalty for each class of aggregate for use on the project. If the list does
 not contain a royalty for a class of aggregate required by the contract, the
 Department will determine a fair market royalty and add it by change order
 to the contract unit price of the applicable contract item. The Department
 will own all material, including reject material, remaining in the pit at the
 completion of pit operations. Bury the remaining material as directed by the
 Engineer and reclaim the pit at no additional cost to the Department.
 Replace or pay for any crop damage in a Department owned source. Before
 moving into a Department owned source, consult with the Engineer about
 what constitutes satisfactory operation and restoration of the source. Obtain
 the Engineer’s approval of the operation and restoration plan for the source.
 3. Department Optioned Sources.
 The Department may acquire an option and may assign the right to take
 materials from the sources referenced in the proposal package. If exercising
 the Department’s option to purchase materials under the terms and conditions provided in the option, notify the surface owner and the material owner
 in writing. Include a timeline for intended use with the written notification.
 Before moving into the source, the Contractor shall submit a copy of the
 written notification to exercise the Department’s option and any other agreements negotiated between the Contractor and the surface owner and material
 owner regarding use of the Department optioned source. Comply with the
 requirements of Chapter 38-16 of the North Dakota Century Code.
 At least 30 calendar days before moving into a Department optioned source,
 provide a written notification of the intended removal process and the proposed access plan to the Engineer, the surface owner, and the material owner.
 Agree upon an approximate date of payment for the material used and the
 reclamation completion date with the material owner and Engineer.
 Pay applicable royalties to the material owner for all material processed in
 the crushing or screening operation, whether accepted or rejected, including
 57
 
 106.02 B.3
 
 all material remaining at the pit after completion of pit operations. Pit operations are complete when material is no longer needed from the pit for the
 project. Remove the processed material from the pit within 180 calendar
 days after completion of pit operations, or pay a storage fee to the material
 owner as outlined in the Department’s material option agreement. If the Contractor fails to remove the material or pay the storage fee, ownership of the
 processed material will revert to the material owner. If the Contractor does
 not intend to keep the material, the Contractor shall dispose of the material, as agreed to with the material owner, after the Engineer determines the
 quantity of reject material. Submit a copy of the disposal agreement to the
 Engineer.
 The royalty payment for the material includes the use of a reasonable area
 adjacent to the source for stripping and waste material stockpiles, a plant site
 not to exceed 8 acres, and an access route for ingress and egress to the source
 that is at least 50 feet wide.
 The Engineer will determine the total amount of all processed, stockpiled,
 and rejected material and the royalty payment due the material owner. The
 Engineer will notify the Contractor and the material owner in writing of this
 information. Upon receipt of this information, make payment to the material
 owner in accordance with the terms of the agreement within 30 calendar
 days.
 C. Privately Owned Sources.
 Acquire the necessary rights to obtain material from privately owned sources
 and pay all related costs.
 The materials pit list may include clues for privately owned sources. These
 clues are for use by all Bidders on an equal, competitive basis.
 D. Aggregate Source Limitations.

 with NDDoH guidance, including prior approval of a sampling plan and concurrence with the laboratory results. The NDDoH guidance is available at:
 http://www.ndhealth.gov/EHS/Erionite/InformationForContractors.htm.
 Submit test results to NDDoH. NDDoH will review the test results and provide
 a response within 10 business days of the postmarked date on the submitted test
 results. NDDoH will base approval on the absence of erionite in the test results
 from the tested source.
 Submit to the Engineer a copy of the written approval obtained from NDDoH at
 least 10 business days before starting any mining or processing of aggregate in
 
 59
 
 106.02 D
 
 an NDDoH-approved source. Clearly mark the approved sources in the field to
 the satisfaction of the Engineer, and maintain these markings until the completion of pit operations.
 Perform pit operations only within the area of the approved source. If the Department or NDDoH determine that the Contractor is performing pit operations
 outside the area of an approved source, the Engineer will shut down the Contractor’s pit operations. After a shutdown, obtain approval from the Department
 and the NDDoH before using any material from the source.
 Include the cost of providing labor, material, and equipment to test drill, obtain
 samples, and conduct laboratory testing related to these erionite sampling and
 testing requirements in the relevant contract items.
 106.03 STORAGE OF MATERIALS
 Store the materials to preserve their quality and fitness for the work. Locate stored
 materials to allow their prompt inspection. The Engineer may inspect and retest
 stored materials before use in the work. Obtain approval from the Engineer before
 storing materials or placing a plant and equipment at locations within the right
 of way other than those shown on the Plans. Provide any additional storage and
 staging area outside the right of way, as necessary. Before using private property
 for storage and staging, obtain written permission of the property owner or lessee,
 define the restoration conditions in the written permission, and provide a copy of the
 written permission to the Engineer. The written permission from a property owner
 may specifically waive the restoration requirement. Restore storage and staging areas within the right of way as agreed to with the Engineer and outside of the right
 of way as defined in the written permission from the property owner, both at no cost
 to the Department.
 106.04 HANDLING MATERIALS
 Handle materials to preserve their quality and fitness for the work. Transport aggregates in vehicles constructed to prevent loss or segregation of materials after
 loading and measuring.
 106.05 STOCKPILING AGGREGATE AND SALVAGED MATERIALS
 Before stockpiling material, prepare the site as follows:
 A. Clear and grub;
 B. Grade to a firm, smooth, and well-drained condition; and
 C. Maintain a bed of aggregate under the stockpiled material to prevent contaminating the stockpiled material with soil or foreign material.
 Stockpile material to prevent segregation. Do not use equipment or methods that
 cause segregation, degradation, or contamination of the aggregate when constructing stockpiles or delivering material. Do not incorporate segregated, degraded, or
 contaminated material into the work.
 Prevent aggregate of different types or sizes from adjacent stockpiles from intermingling.
 60
 
 106.08 A
 
 Do not operate equipment on stockpiles of salvaged bituminous material that will
 remain the property of the Department or be used in hot recycled bituminous pavement. For material salvaged for these purposes, do not stockpile the material higher
 than 15 feet.
 106.06 USE OF MATERIAL FOUND WITHIN THE RIGHT OF WAY
 The Engineer may authorize the use of excavated material within the construction
 limits that are suitable for contract items other than excavation on the project. The
 Department will pay the contract unit price for the excavation of the material and
 the contract unit price for the use of the excavated material. Replace the removed
 material with acceptable material, as determined by the Engineer, at no cost to the
 Department. The Department will not charge the Contractor for the materials used.
 Only remove material from outside the construction limits on the right of way with
 the Engineer’s prior written approval. If approval is given, the Contractor and the
 Engineer will agree to the use of the material including the price the Department
 will charge the Contractor for the material. The agreement shall include conditions
 for the satisfactory restoration of the area. The Engineer will not approve the removal of material from easement areas.
 Before removing material from outside the construction limits on the right of way,
 establish a restoration condition with the Engineer. After removing the material,
 restore the area of material removal to the restoration condition.
 The Contractor may temporarily use material from any existing structure designated for removal in the erection of the new structure. Do not cut or damage temporarily used material without the approval of the Engineer.
 106.07 DEPARTMENT PROVIDED MATERIAL
 The Contract will specify the location for delivery or availability of Department
 provided material. For contract items that require the use of Department provided
 material, the contract unit price includes the cost of handling and placing the material.
 Protect Department provided material delivered to the project. The Contractor is
 responsible for damage to Department provided material delivered to the project.
 The Department will deduct the following from monies due the Contractor:
 A. The cost of shortages, deficiencies, and damage that may occur to the material
 after delivery.
 B. The cost of demurrage charges resulting from the Contractor’s failure to accept
 the material at the contract-specified time and location of delivery.
 106.08 BUY AMERICA
 A. General.

 107.05 MATERIAL SOURCE APPROVAL
 A. General.
 Before disturbing an area as part of the work, provide the Engineer with a Certificate of Approval (COA). Areas requiring a COA include material source locations, access routes to public roads, stockpile locations, rock piles (riprap),
 plant sites, processing and staging areas, waste sites, and any other areas outside
 the project limits.
 Areas for which a COA has been issued cannot be expanded without obtaining
 a COA for the expansion area.
 Comply with all the conditions and requirements listed on the COA. A COA will
 be voided if avoidance areas, indicated on the COA, are disturbed.
 The Engineer will reject material obtained from an area that does not have a
 valid COA or if the Contractor fails to comply with the conditions listed on the
 COA.
 The Contractor is responsible for obtaining all permissions and permits. The
 Department will not provide payments or compensation for delays resulting
 from the Department review or the need to obtain permissions and permits.
 Destruction of cultural resources prior to approval is considered Anticipatory
 Demolition [National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), Section 110(k)(16
 U.S.C. 470h-2], and a COA will not be issued.
 B. Department Controlled Sources.

 107.06 DISCOVERIES
 If the Contractor encounters a threatened or endangered species, prehistoric dwelling sites, human remains, or concentrated historic or prehistoric artifacts anywhere
 the Contractor performs the work, the Contractor shall immediately suspend the
 work and notify the Engineer of the encounter. If encountering prehistoric dwelling
 sites, human remains, or concentrated historic or prehistoric artifacts protect the
 location of the encounter from further disturbance. Resume work in the location of
 the encounter only with written approval from the Engineer.
 If the Contractor fails to notify the Engineer within 24 hours of the encounter, the
 Contractor shall be liable for all standby costs and all damage incurred.
 107.07 RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC
 A. Maintaining Traffic During Performance of the Work.
 Perform the work with minimal inconvenience to traffic. Provide for the safety
 and convenience of the public, including residents along the highway, and the
 protection of persons and property. Until the Engineer accepts the project in accordance with Section 105.15, “Acceptance,” maintain the portion of the roadway used by traffic in a condition that safely and adequately accommodates
 traffic.
 Unless the contract provides for detours or road closures, keep the roadway
 open to traffic during the performance of the work.
 Provide temporary approaches or crossings and intersections with trails, roads,
 streets, businesses, parking lots, residences, garages, and farms, and maintain
 them in a safe condition. Before starting the work, meet with the Engineer at the
 project to coordinate the details and locations of access points and construction
 procedures.
 The Department will provide snow removal to maintain traffic on portions of the
 project open to public traffic.
 Provide, erect, and maintain all necessary barricades, warning signs, lights, and
 other traffic control devices to protect the work and safety of the public and the
 workers.
 B. Maintenance of Traffic During Suspension of Work
 1. General.
 An anticipated suspension is a suspension that the Department includes in
 the contract. If the contract includes an anticipated suspension, the contract
 will include provisions for preparing the project for the suspension.
 During anticipated and unanticipated suspensions, the Department will provide snow removal to maintain traffic.
 2. Anticipated Suspensions.
 The Engineer will only suspend the work when the Contractor has met the
 provisions for preparing the project for the suspension. Once work has been
 suspended for an anticipated suspension, the Department will maintain temporary roads and project sections. Resume maintenance for the entire project
 70
 
 107.07 D.3.b
 
 once work resumes.
 Replace or repair all work or materials lost or damaged during the suspension. The Department will pay the Contractor for the replacement and repair
 costs in accordance with Section 109.03, “Compensation for Contract Revisions.”
 3. Unanticipated Suspensions.
 a. Suspensions for Department Convenience.
 If a suspension is not anticipated by the Department and is not the result
 of the Contractor’s failure to properly perform the work, the Department
 will pay for the cost of maintenance and additional work to resume operations at contract unit prices or as extra work. If the Contractor does not
 resume the work on or before the effective date of the Engineer’s order
 to resume work, the Department will deduct any costs incurred for maintaining traffic after the effective date of the order from monies due or to
 become due the Contractor.
 b. Suspensions due to Contractor’s Actions.
 If a suspension is not anticipated by the Department and is the result
 of the Contractor’s failure to properly perform the work, the Contractor
 shall maintain and restore the roadway to accommodate traffic. The Department will not pay the Contractor for this maintenance work.
 If maintenance or restoration work becomes necessary during a suspension, the Engineer will notify the Contractor and the Contractor shall respond as follows:
 (1) Begin the maintenance and restoration work within 6 hours of the
 Engineer’s notification and complete the maintenance and restoration
 work within 24 hours of the Engineer’s notification. If the Contractor
 fails to begin the maintenance and restoration work within 6 hours of
 the Engineer’s notification, the Department may do one or both of the
 following:
 (a) Complete the maintenance and restoration work by other means,
 and deduct the cost of the maintenance and restoration work from
 monies due or to become due the Contractor.
 (b) Apply a contract price reduction of $500 for the first hour or part
 of an hour, and $250 per each additional hour or part of an hour,
 beyond the initial 6 hours.
 (2) If the maintenance or restoration work affects public safety and the
 Engineer directs, begin the maintenance and restoration work immediately. If the Contractor fails to begin the maintenance and restoration work immediately, the Department will have the maintenance
 and restoration work completed and will deduct the cost of the maintenance and restoration work from monies due or to become due the
 Contractor.
 Beginning maintenance or restoration work means having equipment or
 personnel at the location of the maintenance or restoration work.
 
 71
 
 107.07 C
 
 C. Parking of Equipment, Vehicles, and Stored Materials.
 Do not park equipment and vehicles, or store materials in the median of a divided roadway. Park equipment and vehicles and store material a minimum of
 60 feet from the outside edge of the driving lane.
 Obtain written permission from the property owner before using private property to park vehicles or equipment, to store materials, or as a work area. Provide
 the Engineer with a copy of the written permission. Provide the Engineer with
 a release from the property owner after restoring the property to the property
 owner’s satisfaction.
 D. Urban Work.
 If the contract requires work within a city’s limits, provide written notification to the fire chief and police chief at least 24 hours before blocking any
 street. Provide the fire department access to fire hydrants at all times. Do
 not place material or other obstructions within 10 feet of a fire hydrant or
 as otherwise allowed by ordinances, rules, or regulations.
 E. Dust Control.
 If the Engineer determines that dust from the performance of the work is
 creating a hazard to traffic or a nuisance to the public, control the dust
 on paved surfaces using a vacuum or pickup sweeper and control dust on
 unpaved surfaces using water. If the Engineer determines the vacuum or
 pickup sweeper is not adequate, use water in conjunction with the sweeper
 to control the dust. Do not wash material into storm or sanitary drainage
 systems. Maintain a safe, clean driving surface on any roadway open to
 traffic.
 The Department will not make direct payment for dust control, except that the
 Department will pay the Contractor for the cost of water used for dust control in
 accordance with Section 216, “Water.”
 107.08 HAUL ROADS
 A. Designation of Haul Roads.
 Notify the Engineer of each public road proposed for use as a haul road, before
 hauling over that route. The Engineer will determine the most practical route for
 transporting materials and designate the route as a “haul road,” unless deemed
 unacceptable by a local jurisdiction request.
 If the Engineer determines that pre-haul improvements to a designated haul road
 will reduce the maintenance or restoration costs, the Department will pay for the
 materials used to make pre-haul improvements.
 The Engineer will not designate a road susceptible to severe damage from concentrated heavy hauling as a haul road unless no alternate route is available.
 Investigate alternate routes before submitting a proposal.
 If the Contractor desires to haul on a road that the Engineer determined to be
 unsuitable for hauling, the Engineer will designate that road as a haul road if the
 Contractor provides improvements that the Engineer and Contractor agree make
 the road suitable. Make these improvements at no additional cost to the Department.
 72
 
 107.08 C
 
 Change the route of a designated haul road only with the Engineer’s written
 approval. For route change requests made for the Contractor’s convenience, the
 Engineer may require an agreement limiting the Department’s liability for the
 cost of maintenance and restoration of the haul road.
 A route used to haul material from a commercial pit to the project site is not
 considered a haul road. A commercial pit is a pit that meets one of the following
 criteria:
 1. The pit partially derives its annual sales from that location from sources
 other than Department contracts;
 2. The operator owns the land or has a long-term lease, and did not primarily
 set up the pit at the location to serve Department contracts; or
 3. The operator advertises the availability of material for public sale and has
 facilities available for effecting sales.
 B. Pre-Haul Inspection.
 Before hauling over a designated haul road, the Engineer, the Contractor, and
 the agency charged with control and maintenance of the route will make a joint
 inspection of the haul road. The joint inspection will determine the existing
 condition of the haul road, including the type, thickness, and width of the surfacing material. The group will record the results in an inspection report. The
 inspection report will set forth any special conditions for use, maintenance, and
 restoration of the route. The Contractor, the Engineer, and the agency charged
 with control and maintenance of the route shall review and sign the report.
 C. Use, Maintenance, and Restoration.
 Maintain the haul roads used by public traffic in a condition that safely and
 adequately accommodates public traffic.
 If the Contractor damages the haul road by hauling loads in excess of the legal
 limit, or through negligence or failure to perform maintenance, the Contractor
 shall repair the damage; the Department will not pay the Contractor for the repairs.
 After completing hauling operations over a designated haul road, restore the
 road to a condition at least equal to the condition existing at the time of the prehaul inspection. The Engineer will order the type and amount of maintenance
 and restoration work and the requirements for performing this work.
 Maintain and restore the road as required despite the use of the haul road concurrently by other traffic. For haul roads jointly used by multiple contractors on
 Department contracts, the Engineer will determine the respective obligations for
 maintenance and restoration.
 For haul roads under Department jurisdiction, the Department will only relieve
 the Contractor of any further obligation for restoration of the road when the
 Contractor has restored the road to the condition required in the pre-haul inspection report, as accepted in writing by the Engineer. For haul roads under other
 jurisdiction, obtain a haul road release from the agency charged with control or
 maintenance of the route and submit a copy of the executed release to the Engineer.
 73
 
 107.08 C
 
 If the Engineer determines that dust from hauling operations on designated haul
 roads is creating a hazard to traffic or a nuisance to the public, apply water to the
 haul road as necessary to control the dust.
 D. Materials and Construction.
 Materials and construction methods used in performing maintenance and restoration work shall meet the requirements of the relevant specifications.
 E. Method of Measurement.
 The Engineer will measure all approved quantities of material ordered by the
 Engineer for pre-haul improvements, maintenance, and restoration of designated haul roads as specified in the applicable portions of the contract. The Engineer will measure water used for dust control as specified in Section 216.05,
 "Method of Measurement."
 F. Basis of Payment.
 The Department will pay the Contractor for measured quantities of material ordered by the Engineer for pre-haul improvements, maintenance, and restoration
 of designated haul roads in accordance with Section 109.03, “Compensation for
 Contract Revisions.”
 The Department will not pay the Contractor for the costs to maintain and restore
 routes used to haul materials from commercial pits. Include these costs in the
 contract unit prices of the relevant contract items.
 If maintenance and restoration work only requires the use of equipment, the Department will not pay the Contractor for the costs to use the equipment. Include
 these costs in the contract unit prices of the relevant contract items.
 107.09 USE OF EXPLOSIVES
 If using explosives to perform the work, do not endanger life or property, and maintain responsibility for all damages resulting from the use of explosives.
 Comply with the most restrictive requirements from all local and State laws and
 ordinances, 27 CFR Part 55, and 29 CFR Part 1926 in the use, handling, loading,
 transportation, and storage of explosives and blasting agents.
 At least 72 hours before using explosives, notify property owners and public utility
 companies in the vicinity of the proposed detonation.
 107.10 PROTECTION AND RESTORATION OF PROPERTY
 Protect public and private property while performing the work.
 Assume liability for any damage to public or private property resulting from defective work or materials, or non-execution of the contract until project acceptance in
 accordance with Section 105.15, “Acceptance.”
 Restore damaged public and private property to a condition similar or equal to that
 existing before the damage occurred. Perform restoration in a manner acceptable to
 the Engineer, the controlling public agency, or private property owners.
 Before damaging or disturbing land monuments or property markers, allow the Engineer to witness or otherwise reference their location.
 74
 
 107.13 A
 
 107.11 RESPONSIBILITY FOR DAMAGE CLAIMS
 Indemnify and hold harmless the Department, its officers and employees, counties,
 cities, or other entities or agencies responsible for project supervision, or having jurisdiction over the completed project, and their officers and employees, from suits,
 actions, or claims brought because of any injuries or damage received or sustained
 by any person, persons, or property because of the operations of said Contractor; or
 on account of or in consequence of neglect in safeguarding the work, or through use
 of unacceptable materials in constructing the work; or because of any act of omission, neglect, or misconduct of the Contractor; or because of any claims or amounts
 recovered from any infringements of patent, trademark, or copyright; or from any
 claims or amounts arising or recovered under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, or
 any other law, ordinance, order, or decree.
 Money due the Contractor under the Contract may be retained for the use of the Department. In case no money is due, the Surety may be held until such suits, actions,
 or claims for injuries or damages are settled and evidence to that effect furnished
 to the Department. Money due the Contractor will not be withheld when evidence
 shows that the Contractor is adequately protected by public liability and property
 damage insurance.
 It is specifically agreed between the parties executing the contract that it is not intended by any of the provisions of the contract to create in the public or any member
 thereof a third-party beneficiary, or to authorize anyone to maintain any action for
 personal injuries, death, or property damage pursuant to or arising out of the terms
 or provisions of the contract.
 107.12 PERSONAL LIABILITY OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS
 There shall be no liability upon the Director, Engineer, or their authorized representatives, either personally or as officials of the State in carrying out any contract
 provisions, or in exercising any power or authority granted to them by or within the
 contract’s scope. It should be understood that in all such matters they act solely as
 agents and representatives of the State.

 insurance coverage in accordance with Section 107.14.B, “Insurance Requirements,” for all parties performing work under the contract.
 107.15 HAZARDOUS MATERIAL
 If the Contractor encounters abnormal conditions that indicate the presence of hazardous material or toxic waste anywhere the Contractor performs the work, the
 Contractor shall immediately suspend the work and notify the Engineer. Continue
 work in other areas of the project, but do not resume work in the area of the abnormal condition, unless directed to resume by the Engineer.
 Abnormal conditions include the presence of barrels, obnoxious odors, excessively
 hot earth, smoke, or any other conditions indicating the presence of a hazardous
 material or toxic waste. Treat the conditions with extreme caution.
 Dispose of the hazardous material or toxic waste in accordance with the requirements and regulations of the NDDoH. The Department will pay for work required
 to dispose of these materials in accordance with Section 104.02, “Contract Revisions.” For waste material disposal requiring special procedures, the Department
 will arrange with qualified, certified persons to dispose of the material.
 107.16 CIVIL RIGHTS
 Comply with federal, State, and local laws, rules, and regulations that set forth
 unlawful employment practices including discrimination because of race, religion,
 color, sex, or national origin, and defining actions required for Affirmative Action
 and DBE programs.
 Ensure that no person or groups of persons be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under all programs,
 services, or activities administered by the Department on the grounds of race, color,
 national origin, sex, age, disability/handicap, or income status.

 107.17 REMOVED MATERIAL
 Unless otherwise designated in the contract, removed material becomes the property of the Contractor. If material is transferred to another entity, provide a copy of
 the agreement entered into between the parties.
 If the Contractor determines that the material will be disposed of, the material must
 be disposed in one of the following ways:
 A. Dispose of the material through a beneficial use. Apply for a beneficial use permit from the NDDoH by completing an NDDOT Projects-Inert Waste Beneficial
 Use Application (SFN 58981). Dispose of material at the approved site only
 after obtaining the NDDoH approval of the application and submitting a copy
 of the approval to the Engineer.
 B. Dispose of the material at an approved permanent waste management facility.
 C. If waste cannot be reasonably managed at a permanent waste management facility, obtain approval from the NDDoH for a variance to dispose of the inert waste
 at another site. Apply for a variance by completing an NDDOT Projects-Inert
 Waste Disposal Variance Application (SFN 54344). Dispose of material at the
 approved site only after obtaining the NDDoH approval of the variance and
 submitting a copy of the variance approval to the Engineer.
 The NDDoH, Division of Waste Management, classifies inert waste in “Guideline
 17 – Wastes Excluded from Acceptance at Landfills.”
 Obtain locations of permanent waste facilities, applications, and guidelines from the
 NDDoH, Division of Waste Management. View a list of municipal and inert waste
 landfills and review guidance on the NDDoH website at http://www.ndhealth.gov.
 Include the cost of material disposal in the contract unit price of the relevant contract item.
 107.18 HIGH VISIBILITY CLOTHING
 When not enclosed in a truck or equipment cab, require that all workers within the
 right of way wear retroreflective clothing in accordance with ANSI/ISEA 107, Performance Class 2 or Class 3 requirements.
 Ensure that retroreflective clothing is the outermost garment, in a clean condition,
 and closed in both the front and rear. Replace retroreflective clothing as necessary
 to maintain visibility and reflectivity.
 During times of low visibility, require that all workers wear Class 3 retroreflective
 clothing.

 SECTION 108
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 108.01 SUBLETTING OF CONTRACT
 A minimum of 30 percent of the work, as represented by the original contract
 amount, must be performed by the Contractor’s organization. When calculating the
 percentage of the work to be performed by the Contractor, the Engineer will deduct
 from the original contract amount the contract price of contract items identified
 by the contract as specialty items. The Engineer will include the delivered cost of
 commercially produced materials and manufactured components purchased by the
 Contractor in the percentage of the work to be performed by the Contractor.
 Sublet, sell, transfer, assign, or dispose of any portion of the contract only with the
 Engineer’s prior written approval. To obtain approval, submit a Prime Contractor’s
 Request to Sublet (SFN 5682) for each proposed subcontractor with a copy of the
 subcontract and associated lower-tier subcontracts. For a partially subcontracted
 contract item, explain in detail and show the subcontract amount associated with the
 partially subcontracted contract item.
 If a proposed subcontractor is not currently prequalified, certified as a DBE, or registered as a subcontractor with the Department, submit a Subcontractor Registration Request (SFN 52243) with the Prime Contractor’s Request to Sublet.
 When the contract specifies a DBE Goal, execute a subcontract with all firms approved through the Department’s Good Faith Effort process. If the Department classifies the firm as an oil hauler, supplier, broker, vendor, regular dealer, or manufacturer, no subcontract is required, but the firm must be used to perform the work.
 Begin subcontracted work only after the Engineer approves the Prime Contractor’s
 Request to Sublet.
 A subcontract, transfer of all or a portion of the contract, the Engineer’s approval
 of the Prime Contractor’s Request to Sublet, or the Department’s prequalification,
 DBE certification, or registration of a subcontractor:
 A. Does not relieve the Contractor of responsibility to carry out the contract. Although the Contractor may subcontract a portion of the work to other parties,
 the Contractor is responsible for the successful performance and completion of
 all the work as required by the contract.
 B. Does not relieve the Contractor of any obligations or liability under the contract
 and the contract bond.
 C. Is not an endorsement of the subcontract, the subcontractor, or the subcontractor’s ability to perform the work as required by the contract.
 D. Does not create a contractual relationship between the Department and the subcontractor.
 E. Does not convey to the subcontractor any rights against the Department.
 108.02 PRECONSTRUCTION CONFERENCE
 Before beginning the work, including pit operations specific to the project, and
 81
 
 108.02
 
 unless waived by the Engineer, coordinate and hold a preconstruction conference
 with the Engineer at a mutually agreed time and place. Notify subcontractors, utility
 companies, and other interested parties of the time and place of the preconstruction
 conference.
 Submit the following to the Engineer before or at the preconstruction conference:
 A. A company safety plan and the name of the safety officer;
 B. An EEO / affirmative action plan and the name of the EEO officer;

 G. A list of pits to be used (owner and legal description);
 H. All COAs in accordance with Section 107.05, “Material Source Approval;”
 I. The applicable storm water permits and the SWPPP in accordance with Section
 107.02.C, “Storm Water Permits;” and
 J. The names of Quality Control Personnel and a Quality Control Plan in accordance with Section 430.04 A, “Contractor Quality Control (QC).”
 108.03 PROGRESS SCHEDULE
 A. General.
 Prepare and submit to the Engineer a schedule in accordance with Section
 108.03.B, “Bar Chart Method,” unless the contract requires a Critical Path
 Method (CPM) schedule. If the contract requires a CPM schedule, prepare and
 submit to the Engineer a CPM schedule in accordance with Section 108.03.C,
 “Critical Path Method (CPM).”
 Prepare and submit progress schedules in accordance with the AGC’s Construction Planning and Scheduling Manual. In case of a conflict between the Construction Planning and Scheduling Manual and the scheduling requirements in
 the contract, the contract requirements will take precedence.
 Use the schedule to plan, coordinate, and manage the work, whether the Contractor’s personnel are performing the work or not. Share copies of the complete
 baseline schedule, update schedules, and revised schedules with all subcontractors, suppliers, and utility companies affected by the work.
 Float is a shared commodity and is not for the exclusive use or benefit of any
 party. It is available to all parties as needed until it is consumed.
 The Engineer will accept or reject a schedule based on the schedule meeting the
 requirements of Section 108.03, “Progress Schedule,” and any other contract
 requirement. The Engineer’s acceptance of a schedule:
 
 82
 
 108.03 B.1.b
 
 1. Does not modify the contract.
 2. Does not constitute endorsement or validation by the Engineer of the Contractor’s activity logic, activity durations, or assumptions in creating the
 schedule.
 3. Does not guarantee that the project can be performed or completed as depicted in the schedule.
 4. Does not relieve the Contractor of its obligation or responsibility to submit
 complete and accurate information.
 If the Contractor or Engineer discovers an error after the Engineer has accepted
 a schedule, the Contractor shall correct the error in the next schedule submission.
 If the Contractor fails to prepare and submit a progress schedule that is acceptable to the Engineer as required by the contract, the Engineer will withhold
 progressive estimates until the Contractor submits an acceptable schedule.

 The Department will measure the CPM schedule as a complete unit, and the
 Department will pay as follows:
 Pay Item
 Critical Path Method Schedule
 
 Pay Unit
 Lump Sum
 
 The Department will pay the Contractor for the CPM schedule as follows:
 1. The Department will include 20 percent of the lump sum price in the progressive estimate following the Department’s acceptance of the baseline
 schedule.
 2. The Department will pay the remaining 80 percent of the lump sum contract
 unit price in prorated amounts based on the following formula:
 Amount paid per update schedule submitted
 Lump Sum contract unit price
 = 80% x
 number of update schedules anticipated
 during the life of the contract
 3. If the Contractor fails to submit an update schedule on time, the Engineer
 will reduce the prorated amount for that update schedule as shown in Table
 108-01. Even if the Engineer reduces the prorated amount by 100 percent,
 the Contractor must submit the update schedule.

 Section 108.03 D.2.
 
 Payment will be full compensation for the initial, baseline, update, and revised
 schedules; all required schedule submittals; and all associated progress meetings as necessary to complete the work.
 108.04 NOTICE TO PROCEED
 The Department’s mailing or delivery of a copy of the executed contract to the Contractor or authorized agent constitutes the notice to proceed.
 108.05 LIMITATION OF OPERATIONS
 Perform the work in a manner and sequence that minimizes interference to traffic,
 and with due regard to the location of detours and provisions for handling traffic.
 Do not begin work to the prejudice or detriment of work already started; the contract may require a section of roadway to be finished before starting additional sections if the opening of the section is essential to public convenience.
 If the prosecution of the work is discontinued, provide the Engineer at least 24-hours
 notice before resuming operations.
 Unless the contract allows work on holidays, perform work on holidays only with
 the Engineer’s prior written approval. Submit a written request to the Engineer by
 noon two business days before the requested holiday.
 Unless the contract allows night-time operations, perform the work at night only
 with the Engineer’s prior written approval. Submit a written request to the Engineer
 at least 30 calendar days before the planned night-time operations. Include with
 the written request a plan to ensure the safety of all individuals on the project site,
 including Contractor and subcontractor workers, Department representatives, and
 the travelling public. The Department bears no liability for costs or delays resulting
 from the Engineer’s approval or rejection of a request to perform the work at night.
 108.06 DETERMINATION OF AND EXTENSIONS TO THE CONTRACT
 TIME
 A. Determination of the Contract Time.
 
 91
 
 108.06 A.1
 
 1. General.
 The contract specifies the contract time. Perform the work within the contract time. The contract time may include phased or interim start or finish
 dates, or minimum or maximum durations for portions of the work.
 2. Working Day Contracts.
 Working day contracts specify the contract time as the number of working
 days.
 The Department will charge working days from the starting date specified in
 the contract, or from the date the Contractor starts work at the project site,
 whichever is earlier. If the notice to proceed is delayed for reasons beyond
 the Contractor’s control and not the Contractor’s fault or responsibility, the
 Engineer will extend the starting date for working-day time charges to no
 earlier than the seventh calendar day after the notice to proceed or the date
 the Contractor starts work at the project site, whichever is earlier.
 The Engineer will charge a full working day (at least 7 hours) or half working day (more than 3 hours but less than 7 hours) for each calendar day the
 Contractor can effectively perform work on the critical path as follows:
 a. Any day the Contractor could have performed work on critical activities,
 except Saturday and holidays.
 b. Any day the Contractor performs work on critical activities, including
 Saturdays and holidays.
 c. Any holiday the Contractor receives approval from the Engineer to work,
 even if the Contractor does not perform work.
 The Engineer will not charge a working day under the following conditions:
 a. During the period from November 15 to April 15, even if the Contractor
 performs work on the critical activities during this period.
 b. Any day the Contractor is only able to perform work on critical activities
 for 3 hours or less.
 c. Any day the Contractor performs work on non-critical activities but is
 unable to perform work on critical activities due to conditions beyond the
 Contractor’s control.
 The Engineer will provide a weekly statement showing the number of working days charged for the preceding week and the number of working days
 remaining in the contract time. Review the weekly statement and, within 5
 business days after the last day of the week covered by the statement, notify the Engineer that the weekly statement is correct or protest the weekly
 statement. To protest, submit to the Engineer a written request to revise the
 working day charges. Failure to submit a request within 5 business days
 constitutes the Contractor’s agreement with the working day charges in the
 weekly statement. Once agreed to by the Contractor, whether explicitly or
 because of the Contractor’s failure to submit a timely protest, the working
 day charges documented by the weekly statement are final and the Contrac-
 
 92
 
 108.06 B.1
 
 tor waives entitlement to a time extension or compensation for delays not
 explicitly identified by the weekly statement.
 3. Calendar Day Contracts.
 Calendar day contracts specify the contract time as the number of calendar
 days.
 The completion date is determined by adding the number of calendar days
 specified in the contract to the starting date specified in the contract or from
 the date the Contractor starts work at the project site, whichever is earlier. If
 the notice to proceed is delayed for reasons beyond the Contractor’s control
 and not the Contractor’s fault or responsibility, the Engineer will extend the
 starting date for calendar day contracts to no earlier than the seventh calendar day after the notice to proceed or the date the Contractor starts work at
 the project site, whichever is earlier.
 4. Completion Date Contracts.
 Completion date contracts specify the contract time as a calendar date, or a
 calendar date with a guaranteed minimum number of working days.
 If the completion date contract guarantees a minimum number of working days, the Engineer will charge working days in accordance with Section 108.06.A.2, “Working Day Contracts.” If the number of working days
 charged through the specified completion date is less than the guaranteed
 number, the Engineer will extend the specified completion date to allow for
 the guaranteed number of working days.
 B. Extensions to the Contract Time.
 1. General.
 The Contractor shall immediately notify the Engineer of a delay in accordance with Section 104.03, “Contractor Requested Contract Revisions,”
 once the Contractor becomes aware of the delay, not at the conclusion of the
 delay. The Contractor waives entitlement to a time extension or compensation for delay or costs incurred before the Contractor notified the Engineer of
 the delay.
 After notifying the Engineer of the delay, keep daily records of the labor, material, and equipment affected by the delay as specified in Section 109.03.E,
 “Force Account.” Maintain a daily record of each operation affected by the
 delay and the station locations of the operations affected. The Department
 will also maintain daily records of the operations and station locations. Each
 Monday, compare the previous week’s daily records with the records kept by
 the Department.
 Provide written notice to the Engineer within 10 business days of the results
 of the comparison of the detailed records performed each Monday, and list
 and describe any disagreements between the records.
 The Contractor’s failure to meet with the Engineer and review the Department’s records or to list and describe disagreements between the Contractor’s and Department’s records shall establish that the Department’s records

 are accurate, that the Contractor accepts the records as prepared, and that the
 Contractor agrees that the Department’s records will be the basis for determining the delay and any compensation that may be due because of the delay.
 In addition to the daily records, prepare and submit written reports to the
 Engineer containing the following information each Monday:
 a. Number of days behind schedule.
 b. A summary of all operations that have been delayed, or will be delayed.
 c. In the case of a compensable delay, explain how the Department’s act or
 omission delayed each operation.
 d. Itemize and document all added costs being incurred due to the delay.
 Show all calculations related to the determination of costs.
 The Contractor’s plea that the contract time was insufficient is not a valid
 reason for an extension of time. For calendar day and completion date contracts, the Department will not extend the contract time for delays encountered on holidays and during the period from November 15 to April 15. When
 the time as extended by the Department falls on a date that is a Saturday or
 holiday, the Engineer will extend the contract time to the next business day.
 The Department will evaluate the Contractor’s documentation and analysis
 and determine the time extension due, if any. The Department will not evaluate a request for an extension of the contract time or revise the contract time
 unless the Contractor notifies the Department as specified in Section 104.03,
 “Contractor Requested Contract Revisions.”
 The Engineer will evaluate delays and requests for extensions or revisions to
 phased or interim start or finish dates, or durations for portions of the project in the same manner as requests for an extension of the contract time for
 the project as a whole. Comply with the requirements of Section 108.06.B,
 “Extensions to Contract Time,” when seeking a time extension for phased or
 interim start or finish dates or durations.
 In the event that the Department extends the contract time into a period of
 the year during which the working conditions are less favorable, the Department will consider a further extension of time based on the nature of the
 work the Contractor scheduled to perform during the less favorable period.
 Conversely, if the Department extends the contract time into a period of the
 year during which the working conditions are more favorable, the Department will consider reducing the contract time extension. If the Department
 reduces the work required to complete the project or relaxes phase or stage
 requirements, the Department may reduce the contract time.
 2. Evaluation of Delays and Calculation of Time Extensions.
 The Engineer will evaluate the Contractor’s request for a time extension
 based on the Contractor’s compliance with the following requirements:
 a. Base all evaluations of delay and all calculations of the appropriate time
 extensions due on the schedules submitted to and accepted by the Depart94
 
 108.06 B.2.d.(2)(f)
 
 ment and current at the time the delay occurred, not schedules created
 after the delay occurred.
 b. The delay is on the critical path when the delay occurred.
 c. The delay results in a scheduled milestone, phase or stage, or project
 completion date that is later than the date required by the contract.
 d. If the contract requires a CPM schedule, determine the duration of delays
 as follows:
 (1) Use time impact analysis (TIA) to identify and measure critical delays that have not yet occurred. Do not use this method to evaluate
 delays that have already occurred. In general terms, perform a TIA as
 follows:
 (a) Develop a “mini” schedule for the changed work. This schedule
 is known as a fragnet.
 (b) Identify the current accepted schedule. and record the scheduled
 completion date on that schedule.
 (c) Insert the fragnet into the current schedule by properly linking
 the fragnet with the existing activities in the current accepted
 schedule.
 (d) Recalculate the current schedule with the fragnet inserted and
 record this scheduled completion date.
 (e) The difference in the calculated scheduled completion dates between the current schedule and the schedule calculated with a
 properly inserted and properly composed fragnet is the delay attributable to the changed work. The time extension due, if any,
 will be based on this delay.
 (2) Use a contemporaneous analysis when evaluating delays that have already occurred. In general terms, perform a contemporaneous analysis as follows:
 (a) Identify the most recent accepted schedule with a data date before the start of the delay being evaluated.
 (b) Identify each accepted schedule in effect during the delay and the
 schedule with a data date that immediately follows the conclusion of the delay.
 (c) Identify the critical path each day from immediately before the
 start of the delay to the schedule immediately following the delay.
 (d) Determine whether the delay falls on the critical path.
 (e) If the delay does not fall on the critical path, then no project delay
 occurred and no time extension is due.
 (f) If the delay falls on the critical path, then determine the number
 of days the critical path is delayed. The time extension due, if
 any, will be based on this delay.
 
 95
 
 108.06 B.3
 
 3. Administration of Time Extensions.
 The Department will administer excusable delays on working day, calendar
 day, and completion date contracts as follows:
 a. For working day contracts, the Department will not charge working days
 for excusable delays, except for delays caused by added work or extra
 work. For delays caused by added or extra work, the Department will
 provide a time extension by adding working days to the contract time.
 b. For calendar day and completion date contracts, the Department will provide a time extension by adding calendar days to the contract time.
 4. Excusable, Non-Compensable Delays.
 Excusable, non-compensable delays are unforeseeable and unavoidable delays that are not the Contractor’s or the Department’s fault or responsibility.
 The Contractor is entitled to a contract time extension but not entitled to
 compensation for delay costs associated with an excusable, non-compensable delay. The following are excusable, non-compensable delays:
 a. Delays due to floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, or other natural disasters.
 b. Extraordinary delays in material deliveries. When the Contractor requests
 an extension of the contract time for delays due to the late delivery of
 materials, at the time the delay occurs the Contractor shall provide sufficient documentation to the Department to establish that the delay results
 from the materials being unavailable because of an unusual market condition. An unusual market condition may be an embargo, government act,
 nation-wide shortage, industry-wide strike, or natural disaster that arises
 after the opening of proposals. The Contractor is not entitled to a time
 extension for delays due to slow delivery when the required material is
 available from another source.
 c. Delays due to civil disturbances or acts of war or terror.
 d. Delays due to epidemics or quarantines.
 e. Delays due to labor strikes that are beyond the control of the Contractor,
 subcontractors, or suppliers and are not caused by the improper acts or
 failures of the Contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.
 f. Delays due to utility or railroad work when the Contractor has complied
 with the requirements of Section 105.03.B, “Scheduling,” but the utility
 or railroad company failed to perform their work within the time agreed
 to in the utility coordination meeting.
 g. Delays due to additional quantities that represent a significant change as
 defined in Section 104.02.C, “Significant Changes in the Character of
 Work.”
 h. All other delays not the Contractor’s or Department’s fault or responsibility and not reasonably foreseeable or avoidable by the Contractor.
 5. Excusable, Compensable Delays.
 Excusable, compensable delays are delays that are not the Contractor’s fault
 or responsibility but are the Department’s fault or responsibility. The Con96
 
 108.07 B
 
 tractor is entitled to a contract time extension and to compensation for delay
 costs associated with an excusable, compensable delay. The Department will
 determine compensation for an excusable, compensable delay in accordance
 with Section 109.03.F, “Delay Costs.” The following are excusable, compensable delays:
 a. Delays due to an Engineer-ordered suspension as specified in Section
 104.02.D, “Suspensions of Work Ordered by the Engineer.”
 b. Delays due to differing site conditions as specified in Section 104.02.B,
 “Differing Site Conditions,” extra work as specified in Section 104.02.E,
 “Extra Work,” and significant changes in the character of the work as
 specified in Section 104.02.C, “Significant Changes in the Character of
 Work,” except significant changes due to increases in quantities.
 c. Delays due to the Department’s neglect.
 d. Delays due to the unavailability of right of way.
 e. Delays due to utility or railroad work when the Contractor is required to
 alter operations due to conflicts with utility facilities not shown in the
 Plans or railroads not shown in the Plans.
 6. Non-Excusable Delays.
 Non-excusable delays are delays that are the Contractor’s fault or responsibility or delays that the Contractor could have foreseen or avoided, and
 weather delays not covered by the events listed in Section 108.06.B.4, “Excusable, Non-Compensable Delays.” Delays due to the Contractor’s, subcontractors’, or suppliers’ insolvency or performance are neither excusable,
 nor compensable. The Contractor is not entitled to a time extension or compensation for a non-excusable delay.
 7. Concurrent Delays.
 Concurrent delays are separate delays to critical activities occurring at the
 same time. When a non-excusable delay is concurrent with an excusable
 delay, the Contractor is not entitled to a time extension for the period the
 non-excusable delay is concurrent with the excusable delay. When a noncompensable delay is concurrent with a compensable delay, the Contractor is
 entitled to a contract time extension but not entitled to compensation for the
 period the non-compensable delay is concurrent with the compensable delay.
 108.07 UNSATISFACTORY PROGRESS AND FAILURE TO COMPLETE
 WITHIN THE CONTRACT TIME
 A. Unsatisfactory Progress.
 If the Contractor fails to satisfactorily progress the work as reflected in the
 current accepted progress schedule, the Engineer may arrange a meeting
 between the Contractor, the surety, and other Department representatives
 to discuss the unsatisfactory progress. The parties will mutually develop a
 plan for the Contractor to regain satisfactory progress.
 B. Failure to Complete within the Contract Time.
 For each calendar day that the work remains incomplete after the expiration of
 97
 
 108.07 B
 
 the contract time, the Department will deduct the sum specified in Table 108-02,
 “Daily Charges for Liquidated Damages” from any money due the Contractor.
 If the amount of the deduction exceeds the money due, then the Contractor shall
 immediately pay the Department the difference.
 The sum specified in Table 108-02 is not a penalty but a liquidated damage due
 the Department because of inconvenience to the public, added cost of engineering and supervision, and other additional expenditures of the public’s funds due
 to the Contractor’s failure to complete the work within the contract time.
 Permission for the Contractor or surety to continue and finish work after the
 contract time and approved time extensions have elapsed shall not waive the
 Department’s rights under the contract.
 The Department will not assess liquidated damages during a period when the
 project is in an authorized state of suspension.
 If the Department determines the work is substantially complete and is in a
 condition for safe and convenient use by the traveling public, the Department
 may terminate the assessment of all or a portion of the liquidated damages that
 accrue.
 The Department will consider the work substantially complete when the Contractor has installed all necessary signing, striping, guardrail, and other safety
 appurtenances, and, if the contract requires, when the project is opened to the
 traveling public. If the contract does not require the project opened to the traveling public, the Department will consider the work substantially complete when
 it is ready for the subsequent project. The Engineer’s suspension of time charges
 is not a contractual right and its application will be contingent upon the Contractor’s diligence in completing the remaining items of work.
 The Department will assess liquidated damages in accordance with Table 108-02.

 For calendar day and completion date contracts, the Department will use the
 daily charge for calendar days; for working day contracts, the daily charge for
 working days.
 108.08 TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT FOR DEFAULT
 If the Department finds that the Contractor is responsible for any of the following,
 the Engineer may issue a written notice of default to the Contractor and surety:
 A. Failing to begin the work under the contract within the time specified;
 B. Failing to perform the work with sufficient resources to ensure the prompt completion of the work;
 C. Failing to perform the work satisfactorily;
 D. Neglecting or refusing to remove or replace rejected materials or unacceptable
 work;
 E. Discontinuing the prosecution of the work;
 F. Failing to resume work, which has been discontinued, within a reasonable time
 after the Engineer gives the Contractor written notice to do so;
 G. Becoming insolvent, being declared bankrupt, or committing any act of bankruptcy or insolvency;
 H. Allowing any final judgment to be unsatisfied for 10 business days.
 I. Making an assignment for the benefit of creditors without the Engineer’s approval;
 J. Failing to maintain active insurance policies in accordance with Section 107.14,
 “Public Liability and Property Damage Insurance;” or
 K. Failing to perform the work in an acceptable manner due to any other cause.
 If the Contractor or surety does not address the notice of default within 10 calendar
 days of such notice, the Engineer will provide a written notice of termination for
 default to the Contractor and surety, and the Department will have the full power
 and authority, without violating the contract, to terminate the contract and take the
 prosecution of the work away from the Contractor. The Department may appropriate or use any or all materials and equipment at the project site and may enter an
 agreement with another party to complete the contract according to its terms and
 provisions. The Department may use other methods required to perform the remainder of the work or complete the project. If the Department solicits bids for the
 remainder of the work or completion of the project, the Contractor is not eligible to
 submit a proposal.
 The Department will deduct all costs incurred by the Department, together with the
 cost of completing the work under contract, from any monies due or that may become due the Contractor. If the Department’s costs, including the cost of completing the work under the contract, exceed the amount that would have been payable
 under the contract, the Contractor and the surety shall be liable and shall pay the
 Department the amount of such excess.
 
 99
 
 108.08
 
 If the Department issues a notice of termination for default and later determines the
 Contractor was not in default, the termination for default will become a termination
 for convenience in accordance with Section 108.09, “Termination of the Contract
 for Convenience.”
 108.09 TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT FOR CONVENIENCE
 After determining that, for reasons beyond either the Department’s or the Contractor’s control, the Contractor is prevented from proceeding with or completing the
 work as originally contracted for, and that contract termination would be in the public interest, the Department may terminate the contract or any portion of the contract
 by written order of the Engineer. Reasons for termination include the following:
 A. Executive Orders of the President relating to war or national defense;
 B. A national emergency that creates a serious shortage of materials, labor, equipment, or funds that will continue for an unreasonable length of time;
 C. Orders from duly-constituted authorities relating to energy conservation;
 D. Restraining orders or injunctions obtained by third-party citizen action, or
 where the issuance of such order or injunction is caused by acts or omissions of
 persons or agencies other than the Contractor;
 E. Changes in funding availability at either the State or federal level;
 F. Changes in Department priorities from any cause;
 G. An act of God; or
 H. Any other reason deemed to be in the best interest of the public.
 The rights accorded the Department and the Contractor by this section shall not
 supersede or include other specific rights and responsibilities of each contained in
 the contract.
 After receiving the notice of termination for convenience, submit to the Engineer a
 request for compensation in accordance with Section 104.02, “Contract Revisions,”
 except, submit the request within 60 calendar days of the effective date of termination for convenience.
 The Department will pay the Contractor for costs that the Contractor has incurred
 before or as a result of the termination for convenience in accordance with Section 109.03, “Compensation for Contract Revisions.” In addition, the Department
 will pay the Contractor for mobilization efforts, guaranteed payments for private
 land usage as part of the original contract, and any other costs resulting from the
 termination for convenience, subject to the limitations of Section 109.03.G, “NonAllowable Charges.”
 The Department may purchase materials the Contractor has not incorporated into
 the project at the actual delivered cost to a prescribed location; otherwise, the Contractor shall dispose of the materials in a manner approved by the Engineer. The
 Department will only purchase material that the Engineer has inspected, tested, and
 accepted and that the Contactor has properly stored and maintained.
 The Department’s termination of the contract or a portion thereof shall not relieve
 100
 
 108.09
 
 the Contractor of any contractual responsibilities for the work completed, or relieve
 the surety of its obligation for and concerning any just claim arising out of the work
 performed in accordance with Section 104.06, “Department-Initiated Claims.”
 
 101
 
 109.01
 
 SECTION 109
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 109.01 MEASUREMENT OF QUANTITIES
 A. General.
 The bid item list specifies the unit of measure for each contract item. The Engineer will measure accepted quantities of work for each contract item in accordance with the “Method of Measurement” subsection in the relevant specifications and Section 109.01, “Measurement of Quantities.” In the case of a conflict,
 the method of measurement in the relevant specifications supersedes the method
 of measurement in Section 109.01, “Measurement of Quantities.” Unless the
 contract specifies payment by plan quantity, the Engineer will measure the actual quantity of accepted work for each contract item.
 B. Area.
 For area calculations of contract items, the Engineer will measure the longitudinal length horizontally and use the transverse dimension shown on the Plans.
 The Engineer will not make deductions for individual fixtures occupying an
 area equal to or less than 9 SF.
 C. Structures.
 For structures, the Engineer will measure structures using the Plan quantity
 based on the dimensions shown on the Plans.
 D. Linear Units.
 For contract items specified for measurement by linear unit, the Engineer will
 take measurements parallel to the base or foundation.
 E. Volume.
 For volume calculations of contract items, the Engineer will use the average
 end-area method, the prismoidal method, truck/vehicle method, or other acceptable methods.
 F. Truck/Vehicle Volume.
 For materials specified for measurement by volume, the Engineer will measure
 in vehicles at the point of delivery. Use vehicles that allow easy and accurate
 measurement of the contents. Load all vehicles to their water level capacity if
 possible. The Engineer may direct the Contractor to level the loads at the point
 of delivery to determine the actual volume of the load. Do not exceed the legal
 load limits for gross weight.
 G. Timber.
 The Engineer will measure timber by the thousand board feet measure, based on
 nominal widths and thicknesses and the longest dimension of each piece.
 H. Lump Sum.
 When a contract item has a “lump sum” unit, the contract unit price is full compensation to the Contractor for that contract item.
 I. Standard Manufactured Materials.
 The Engineer will accept nominal dimensions for standard manufactured materials unless the contract requires otherwise. The Engineer will accept industry
 102
 
 109.01 J.3.a
 
 established manufacturing tolerances, unless the contract requires otherwise.
 J. Material Weight.
 1. General.
 Weigh materials on a certified scale. Provide a scale operator to operate
 the scale, issue weigh tickets, perform scale verifications, and prepare tare
 weight reports and daily haul summaries.
 Do not supply tickets, as specified in Section 109.01 J.6.a “General,” to truck
 drivers if the weight of the load is in excess of the legal load limits in place
 on the haul route.
 Provide scales that are:
 a. Certified by a scale service company registered with the North Dakota
 Public Service Commission. If the certification is more than 9 months
 old when the scale begins project use, have the scale recertified. Submit a
 copy of the certification before starting weighing operations.
 b. Accurate to within 1.0 percent of the true weight of the applied load
 throughout the range of use.
 2. Scale Applications.
 Use either computerized or non-computerized scales to determine weights
 for material when the quantity of the material included in the bid item list is
 2,000 pounds or less.
 a. Computerized Scales.
 Use a computerized scale to determine the weight of material when the
 quantity included on the bid item list is greater than 2,000 pounds.
 Use a scale with a digital readout and a computer that produces weigh
 tickets and daily haul summaries.
 b. Computerized Loader Bucket Scales.
 Loader bucket scales may be used to weigh materials when the quantity
 of material included in the bid item list is less than 10,000 pounds and
 for aggregates specified under Sections 420 “Bituminous Seal Coat,” 421
 “Microsurfacing,” and 422 “Slurry Seal” regardless of quantity.
 Equip loader bucket scales with an onboard computer that produces
 weigh tickets.
 Load trucks on a level loading area and with the loader scale in dynamic
 mode. Operate the loader scale in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 guidelines.
 3. Types of Scales.
 a. Platform Scales.
 Provide scales with a platform that is large enough to simultaneously
 weigh all axles of the longest truck, or truck-trailer combination, used for
 the project.
 Determine the daily tare weight of each truck before it hauls its first load.
 103
 
 109.01 J.3.a
 
 Ensure trucks are fully fueled at the time the tare weight is determined.
 Before the first use of the scale for the project and any time the scale is
 recertified, perform the:
 – Zero load test;
 – Comparison test;
 – Sensitivity test; and
 – Shift test.
 b. Hopper or Batch Scale.
 Provide hopper and batch scales that use one or more load cells.
 Before the first use of the scale for the project and any time the scale is
 recertified, perform the:
 – Zero load test;
 – Comparison test; and
 – Sensitivity test.
 c. Computerized Loader Bucket Scale.
 Before the first use of loader bucket scales for the project and any time the
 scale is recertified, perform the comparison test.
 4. Verification Tests.
 The Engineer will verify the accuracy of scales by observing the Contractor perform the verification tests specified in Section 109.01 J.3 “Types of
 Scales.” The Engineer may request verification tests to be performed randomly.
 If the scale is not operating within the required tolerance, have the scale recertified by a scale service company registered with the North Dakota Public
 Service Commission.
 a. Zero Load Test.
 Adjust the scale so that it balances or reads “zero” when no load is applied to the scale.
 b. Comparison Test.
 If the difference between the weight determined by the scale and the comparison test is more than 1.0 percent, repair and recertify the project scale.
 (1) Platform Scales.
 Perform a comparison test using one of the following methods. Notify the Engineer of the method that will be used before starting weighing operations. Obtain the Engineer’s permission if a change in test
 methods is desired.
 (a) Independent Scale Method.
 The Engineer will randomly select a loaded truck that has been
 weighed on the project scale. The Contractor shall weigh this
 truck on a certified scale owned and operated by an entity other
 
 104
 
 109.01 J.4.c
 
 than the Contractor.
 (b) Certified Equipment Weight Method.
 Weigh a piece of equipment on the project scale. Use a piece of
 equipment that:
 – Is fully fueled;
 – Is free of mud and dirt; and
 – Has a certified weight of at least 60 percent of the maximum
 load to be applied to the scale during the life of the contract.
 Provide an affidavit affirming the certified weight of the equipment. Provide a new affidavit when any changes are made to the
 equipment that will affect the certified weight.
 If using the certified equipment weight method, perform a secondary check using the independent scale method for the first
 two days that the scale is in operation and once per month thereafter.
 (2) Hopper or Batch Scales.
 After the material has been weighed on the project scale and placed
 in a truck, weigh the loaded truck on a certified scale owned and operated by an entity other the Contractor. Provide the tare weight of the
 truck along with the comparison weigh ticket.
 (3) Computerized Loader Bucket Scales.
 Perform a comparison test using one of the following methods:
 (a) Independent Scale Method.
 After placing the load in a truck, weigh the loaded truck on a
 certified scale owned and operated by an entity other than the
 Contractor. Provide the tare weight of the truck along with the
 comparison weigh ticket.
 (b) Certified Weighted Object Method.
 Weigh an object on the project scale and compare its certified
 weight to the loader bucket scale readout. Use an object that:
 – Is free of mud and dirt; and
 – Has a certified weight of at least 60 percent of the capacity of
 the loader bucket.
 Weld a plate onto the object showing its certified weight.
 Provide an affidavit affirming the weight of the object, as measured on a certified scale.
 Provide a new affidavit when requested by the Engineer or
 if changes are made to the object that will affect the certified
 weight.
 c. Sensitivity Test.
 Weigh a representative load and then add 100 pounds of test weights.
 If the scale is not sensitive to the added weight, repair and recertify the
 scale.
 105
 
 109.01 J.4.d
 
 d. Shift Test.
 Check the performance of the scale with off-center loading by comparing
 the results of weighing a truck in the following positions:
 – Place the rear wheels at the extreme end of the scale platform;
 – Position the truck with the rear wheels at the extreme opposite end of
 the platform; and
 – Position the truck in the center of the platform.
 Repair and recertify the scale if the results of any two positions differ by
 more than 0.2 percent.
 5. Random Comparison Tests.
 If a comparison test reveals that the scale is out of tolerance, repair and
 recertify the scale.
 At any time, the Engineer may require the scale to be checked for accuracy
 utilizing any test method.
 a. Platform Scales.
 Perform a comparison test as specified in Section 109.01 J.4.b.(1) “Platform Scales.”
 Conduct one test for each 5,000 tons of material weighed, except when
 more than 5,000 tons are weighed in one day. When more than 5,000 tons
 of material is weighed in one day, conduct one test for that day’s production.
 b. Batch and Hopper Scales.
 Perform a comparison test as specified in Section 109.01 J.4.b.(2) “Hopper and Batch Scales.”
 Conduct one test for each 5,000 tons of material weighed, except when
 more than 5,000 tons are weighed in one day. When more than 5,000 tons
 of material is weighed in one day, conduct one test for that day’s production.
 c. Computerized Loader Bucket Scales.
 Perform a comparison test as specified in Section 109.01 J.4.b.(3) “Computerized Loader Bucket Scales.”
 Perform a comparison test each day that the loader bucket scale is used.
 Record the results of the test and submit a signed copy to the Engineer.
 The Engineer may prohibit the use of loader bucket scales if two consecutive tests fail.
 6. Documentation.
 a. General.
 Place a unique identification number on each truck that is legible and in
 plain view of the scale operator.
 Document the weight of each load on a separate, sequentially numbered
 weigh ticket that has a minimum size of 5.5 × 8.5 inches. Provide one
 106
 
 109.01 J.6.c.(1)
 
 copy to the driver of the truck. The truck driver shall deliver the weigh
 ticket to the Engineer at the location where the material is incorporated
 into the work. The Engineer will reject loads that are not accompanied by
 a legible weigh ticket.
 (1) Computerized Scales.
 Produce computer generated weigh tickets. Produce computer generated daily haul summaries using the same computer, software, and
 data that produced the individual weigh tickets. Submit paper haul
 summaries and daily tare weight reports at the beginning of the subsequent work day.
 Notify the Engineer if the computer or printer malfunctions. If this
 occurs, non-computerized weighing and recording will be allowed
 for a maximum of 2 consecutive work days.
 (2) Computerized Loader Bucket Scales.
 Generate weigh tickets using the onboard computer and loader bucket scale printer. Produce daily haul summaries by hand or a computer
 generated spreadsheet.
 (3) Non-Computerized Scales.
 The scale operator shall generate weigh tickets when non-computerized scales are used. Produce daily haul summaries by hand or a
 computer generated spreadsheet.
 b. Trucks and Weigh Tickets.
 Place the following information on each weigh ticket:
 (1) Ticket number.
 (2) NDDOT project number or NDDOT Project Control Number (PCN).
 (3) Delivery date.
 (4) Contractor and Subcontractor, if applicable.
 (5) Time of weighing.
 (6) Identification number of truck.
 (7) Material type identified by pay item name.
 (8) Unit of measure.
 (9) Weight delivered:
 – Gross weight, tare weight and net weight for platform scales.
 – Net Weight for batch, hopper, and loader bucket scales.
 (10) Scale person’s signature for manually produced tickets.
 c. Daily Haul Summaries.
 For each material weighed, provide a haul summary containing the following information:
 (1) NDDOT project number or NDDOT PCN (whichever is used on the
 weigh tickets);
 107
 
 109.01 J.6.c.(2)
 
 (2) Delivery date;
 (3) Contractor and Subcontractor, if applicable;
 (4) Pit location and owner;
 (5) Identification number of truck;
 (6) Each load’s net weight and ticket number, with justification for out of
 sequence numbers;
 (7) Material type identified by pay item name;
 (8) Total weight of material delivered to the project;
 (9) Weight of material voided for the day;
 (10) Weight of the day’s production;
 (11) A signed statement from the Contractor attesting to the accuracy and
 completeness of the facts represented. A signed statement from a
 subcontractor or supplier attesting to the accuracy and completeness
 of the facts represented is required if they operate the scales. The
 statement shall consist of the following language: “I certify the Daily
 Haul Summary is true, accurate, and complete;”
 (12) Blank for the Engineer’s signature. Include the following language:
 “I certify the Daily Haul Summary has been reviewed, corrected as
 necessary, and approved;” and

 7. Basis of Payment.
 If a comparison test reveals a scale is overweighing, the Engineer will adjust
 the payment for all material weighed since the last accepted test under Section 109.01 J.5 “Random Comparison Tests.” The Engineer will calculate
 the weight of all materials weighed after the last accepted test and reduce
 the payment for this material by the percentage of scale error exceeding 1.0
 percent. The Department will not compensate the Contractor for losses due
 to a scale under-weighing material.
 The Department will pay for materials on the basis of daily haul summaries
 produced by the Contractor and approved by the Engineer. If daily haul summaries are not generated using the same computer, software and data that
 produced the individual weigh tickets, the Department will pay based on
 individual weigh tickets.
 Include the cost of operating scales in the contract unit price of the items being weighed.
 K. Weight-Volume Conversion.
 The Contractor may request to weigh material specified to be measure by volume. If the Engineer approves the request, the Engineer will convert the material weight to a volume quantity for payment. Material will be weighed as specified in Section 109.01 J “Material Weight.”
 
 108
 
 109.01 L.3
 
 The Contractor may request to have material specified to be measured by weight,
 measured by volume. If the Engineer approves the request, the Engineer will
 convert the material volume to weight for payment.
 The Engineer will determine a material’s conversion factors for weight to volume and for volume to weight based on the materials’ specific gravity. Before
 the Engineer uses the conversion factors, the Engineer and Contractor shall
 agree in writing to the factors.
 L. Bituminous Material.
 1. General.
 The Engineer will measure bitumen by the ton or gallon. The Engineer may
 convert the weight of bitumen to volume or the volume of bitumen to weight
 based on conversion factors determined from the specific gravity of the bitumen. If measuring bitumen by volume, the Engineer will adjust the measured
 volume to the equivalent volume at 60°F, using the tables in ASTM D 4311.
 The Engineer will measure or verify the quantity of bitumen at the point of
 delivery. The Engineer will deduct the quantity of bitumen not placed on the
 road surface from the delivered quantity.
 The Engineer may weigh any load of bitumen at the point of delivery to the
 project site.
 2. Weighing of Bituminous Material.
 For bitumen weighed at the source, provide the shipment manifest with each
 sealed tank, signed by a supplier representative.
 For bitumen transported directly from the source to the project site in a distributor or transport truck and trailer, weigh each vehicle using one of the
 following methods:
 – Before and after loading, on scales provided by the supplier or on public
 scales near the source; or
 – Before and after unloading, on the Contractor’s scales or on public scales
 near the project site.
 Use a scale with current certification from the state agency with the appropriate jurisdiction in the state the scale is located.
 3. Acceptance of Material.
 If the Engineer determines that the bitumen materially affects the quality of
 the work, to the extent that the contract requires corrective action or removal,
 the Department will not pay for the bitumen or any affected related items.
 If both the original and check samples of bitumen fail to meet the same testing requirement of the relevant specifications and the material remains in the
 transport vehicles, the Engineer will reject the entire load of bitumen.
 If both the original and check samples fail to meet the same testing requirement of the relevant specifications and the material is no longer in the transport vehicle, the Engineer will determine a contract price adjustment as
 specified in Section 109.01 L.4, “Contract Price Adjustments.”
 109
 
 109.01 L.3
 
 The Department will pay the contract unit price for accepted quantities of
 bitumen measured, when the Engineer conditionally accepts the material for
 use and one of the following conditions exists:
 – The original sample of the bitumen meets all testing requirements of the
 relevant specifications; or
 – The original sample of the bitumen does not meet all testing requirements
 of the relevant specifications, but the check sample meets the testing requirements not met by the original.
 4. Contract Price Adjustments.
 a. Performance Graded (PG) Asphalts.
 The Department defines price adjustments for PG asphalts failing to meet
 Section 818.02.A, “Performance Graded (PG) Asphalt,” in the NDDOT
 Contract Price Adjustments for Performance Graded Asphalt Cement.
 The Price Adjustments document is available online at www.dot.nd.gov.
 b. Non Performance Graded (PG) Asphalts.
 For bitumen of types other than PG asphalts, if both the original and
 check samples of bitumen fail to meet the same testing requirement of
 the relevant specifications, except penetration and demulsibility, and the
 Engineer determines that the deviation will not materially affect the quality of the work, the Department will reduce payment for the bitumen by
 20 percent of the invoice price (FOB refinery) per unit, for the quantity of
 bitumen represented by the failing samples. If both the original and check
 samples fail to meet two or more of the same testing requirements of the
 relevant specifications, including penetration and demulsibility, and the
 Engineer determines the deviation will not materially affect the quality of
 the work, the Engineer will base the price adjustment on the highest unit
 price reduction.
 (1) Penetration.
 If the test results of both the original and check samples of the bitumen fail to meet the penetration testing requirements of the relevant
 specifications, the Engineer will reduce payment for the bitumen by
 applying a unit price reduction factor to the invoice price (FOB refinery) of the bitumen. The Engineer will average the variation of
 penetration percentages of both failing samples and determine the
 unit price reduction factor in accordance with Table 109-01:
 
 110
 
 109.02 B.1
 
 Table 109-01

 The contract price adjustment will be determined by multiplying the
 Adjustment Factor by the total tons of bitumen represented by the test
 and the invoice price for the bitumen. The contract price adjustment
 will be applied under the appropriate bitumen item.
 (2) Demulsibility.
 If the test results of both the original and check samples of the emulsified bitumen fail to meet the demulsibility testing requirements of
 the relevant specifications, the Engineer will reduce payment for the
 bitumen by applying a unit price reduction factor to the invoice price
 (FOB refinery) of the bitumen. The Engineer will average the variation of demulsibility percentages of both failing samples and determine the unit price reduction factor in accordance with the following:
 Adjustment Factor (%) = Average Variation from Specified Value × 0.67
 109.02 SCOPE OF PAYMENT
 A. General.
 The Department will pay the Contractor for accepted quantities of the contract
 items at the contract unit prices, as required by the contract, except as otherwise
 specified in Section 104.02, “Contract Revisions.”
 The Department’s payment to the Contractor for the contract items is full compensation for performing all work as required by the contract, including all risk,
 loss, damage, or expense arising from the nature or performance of the work,
 subject to Section 105.16, “No Waiver of Legal Rights.”
 The Department provides either direct or indirect payment for the work, under
 the contract items shown in the bid item list.
 B. Direct Payment.
 Direct payment is made under a contract item shown in the bid item list when
 one of the following applies:
 1. The work is measured in the “Method of Measurement” subsection of the
 relevant specification, and the bid item list contains a contract item for the
 work with the same three-digit number as the section of the specifications
 ordering the work.
 
 111
 
 109.02 B.2
 
 2. The “Method of Measurement” subsection of the specification ordering the
 work references another section for measuring the work, and the bid item list
 contains a contract item for the work from the referenced section.
 C. Indirect Payment.
 Work required to safely and satisfactorily provide or complete a contract item in
 accordance with the “Construction Requirements” subsection and Section 100,
 “General Provisions,” but which is not directly measured and paid for, or which
 is not included in the bid item list, is an incidental obligation of the Contractor.
 The Department does not directly pay for such work and payment is included
 under the associated contract items in the bid item list. This includes instances
 when the “Construction Requirements” subsection references another specification for performing the work and does not reference another specification for
 direct payment of the work.
 109.03 COMPENSATION FOR CONTRACT REVISIONS
 A. General.
 The Engineer and Contractor shall determine compensation for contract revisions, as provided in Section 104.02, “Contract Revisions,” using the sequence
 specified in Section 109.03.B, “Contract Unit Price,” Section 109.03.C, “PS-1
 Price,” Section 109.03.D, “Negotiated Price,” and Section 109.03.E, “Force Account.” If a contract revision includes a time extension for compensable delays
 as determined by the Engineer in accordance with Section 108.06, “Determination of and Extensions to the Contract Time,” the Engineer and Contractor will
 determine compensation for the costs associated with the time extension in accordance with Section 109.03.F, “Delay Costs.”
 The Department’s payment for a contract revision is full compensation for
 performing the revised work, including any costs allowed by Section 109.03,
 “Compensation for Contract Revisions,” and not expressly precluded by Section 109.03.G, “Non-Allowable Charges.”
 B. Contract Unit Price.
 For contract revisions covered by contract items, the Engineer will determine
 compensation using the existing contract unit prices.
 If the contract does not contain the appropriate contract items, the Department
 will pay the Contractor in accordance with Section 109.03.C “PS-1 Price.”
 C. PS-1 Price.
 For contract revisions covered by items listed on the Price Schedule for Miscellaneous Items (PS-1), the Engineer will determine compensation using the PS-1
 unit prices. If the Contractor uses a subcontractor to exclusively perform the
 revised work, the Department will pay the Contractor an additional amount for
 the revised work as a mark-up on the PS-1 unit price in accordance with Section
 109.03.E.5, “Subcontracting.”
 If the contract revision does not include work covered by items listed on the PS1, the Engineer will proceed with determining compensation in accordance with
 Section 109.03.D, “Negotiated Price.”
 
 112
 
 109.03 E.2
 
 D. Negotiated Price.
 The Engineer and Contractor will determine compensation based on mutually
 agreed prices. If the Contractor uses a subcontractor to exclusively perform the
 revised work, the Department will pay the Contractor an additional amount for
 the revised work as a mark-up on the negotiated unit price in accordance with
 Section 109.03.E.5, “Subcontracting.”
 The Engineer may request that the Contractor provide an estimate of the proposed unit prices or a lump sum price for the contract revision. The Engineer
 may request that the Contractor justify the estimate by providing one or more of
 the following:
 1. Labor requirements by trade in hours for each task.
 2. Equipment costs and time requirements.
 3. Material costs.
 Provide the justification within 5 business days after the Engineer’s request. The
 Engineer will respond to the estimate within 5 business days after receipt of the
 Contractor’s justification. The Engineer and the Contractor may mutually agree
 to extend these time requirements.
 If the Engineer and Contractor cannot agree on compensation in accordance with
 Section 109.03.D, “Negotiated Price,” the Engineer will direct the Contractor to track
 the cost of the revised work in accordance with Section 109.03.E, “Force Account.”
 E. Force Account.
 1. General.
 The Engineer may direct the Contractor to perform the revised work on a
 force account basis. If the Engineer determines that the Department will pay
 the Contractor for the revised work on a force account basis, the Department
 will pay the Contractor in accordance with Section 109.03.E.9, “Payment.”
 Before beginning or continuing with the revised work, submit a written proposal and schedule for the revised work, including labor, materials, equipment, subcontracting work, and specialty work.
 The Engineer may direct the Contractor to do any of the following for revised work tracked on a force account basis:
 a. Change equipment and labor forces assigned to the revised work;
 b. Limit overtime on the revised work to the level previously used by the
 Contractor on the project for work of a similar nature;
 c. Provide overtime for an emergency; and
 d. Stop the revised work when adverse conditions limit productivity.
 2. Labor.
 The Department will pay the Contractor the direct labor costs for each hour
 a laborer or foreman is engaged in the revised work. Direct labor costs include wage rates and health and welfare benefits. Submit copies of certified
 payrolls to justify the direct labor rates paid to each laborer and foreman. Be113
 
 109.03 E.2
 
 fore beginning the revised work, the Contractor and Engineer shall mutually
 agree to wage rates using an Equipment Rental and Wage Rates Agreement
 (SFN 13890) form. The Department will not pay the Contractor for wage
 rates above those rates in the Equipment Rental and Wage Rates Agreement.
 The Department will pay the Contractor an additional amount for labor used
 to perform the revised work as a mark-up on the direct labor costs to cover
 profit, field and home office overhead, pension fund, fringe benefits, bond,
 insurance, worker’s compensation, unemployment insurance, social security
 taxes, and any other labor additives. The mark-up is 70 percent of the direct
 labor costs for all revised work (5 percent for profit and 65 percent for all
 other mark-ups). The Department will apply the mark-up only to the direct
 labor costs, not subsistence and travel allowance.
 In addition to the direct labor costs and labor mark-up, the Department will
 pay the Contractor for the actual cost paid to or on behalf of workers for
 subsistence and travel allowance. Submit to the Engineer all relevant documentation to justify the subsistence and travel costs.
 3. Materials.
 For all materials accepted by the Engineer and permanently installed into the
 work, the Department will pay the Contractor at the invoice price paid by the
 Contractor, including transportation charges.
 Provide the Engineer with paid invoices for materials used in the revised
 work, including invoices for transportation cost. If the Contractor does not
 specifically purchase the material for the revised work but takes the material
 from the Contractor’s stock, the Contractor shall provide an affidavit certifying the following:
 a. That the material was taken from stock;
 b. That the quantity of material claimed was used in the work; and
 c. That the Contractor paid the amount on the invoice for the material, including transportation cost.
 The Department will pay the Contractor an additional amount for material
 used in the revised work as a mark-up on the invoice cost to cover administrative costs, field and home office overhead, and profit. The mark-up for
 material used in the revised work is 15 percent (5 percent for profit and 10
 percent for all other mark-ups).
 For materials used to perform the revised work but not permanently installed
 into the work, the Department will not pay the Contractor the full purchase
 price, but will pay the Contractor a reasonable amount determined by the
 Engineer for the depreciation in value of the material because of its use to
 perform the revised work.
 4. Equipment.
 a. General.
 The Department will pay the Contractor for each hour that the Contractor
 114
 
 109.03 E.4.b.(3)
 
 uses an approved piece of equipment to perform the revised work. The
 Engineer and Contractor shall mutually agree to the Engineer-determined
 rates using the Equipment Rental and Wage Rates Agreement. The Department will not pay the Contractor for the use of small tools not listed
 in the Rental Rate Blue Book published by the Equipment Watch unit of
 Penton Media, Inc.
 The Department will pay the Contractor for subcontractor-owned equipment in accordance with Section 109.03.E.4.b, “Owned Equipment,” and
 for equipment the Contractor has leased, rented, or hired from a subcontractor in accordance with Section 109.03.E.4.c, “Leased, Rented, or
 Hired Equipment.”
 b. Owned Equipment.
 The Department will pay the Contractor for owned equipment at 70
 percent of the hourly ownership cost determined in accordance with the
 Rental Rate Blue Book. The hourly ownership cost equals the regionally
 adjusted monthly ownership cost divided by 176 hours per month.
 The Department will not pay the Contractor more than the purchase price
 for an owned piece of equipment.
 If the owned equipment necessary for the revised work is not available
 at the project site, the Department will pay the Contractor for the cost of
 transporting the equipment to the project site (“move-in”) and returning
 the equipment to its original location (“move-out”) in accordance with
 the following:
 (1) Obtain the Engineers approval of the original location of the equipment before transporting the equipment to the project site. If the Contractor chooses to keep the equipment at the project site to perform
 work other than the revised work, the Department will not pay the
 Contractor for the “move-out” costs. If the Contractor chooses to return the equipment to a location other than the original location, the
 Department will pay the Contractor for the “move-out” costs, not to
 exceed the “move-in” costs.
 (2) The Engineer will determine the Contractor’s cost of transporting the equipment to and from the project site based on the hourly
 rates for labor and equipment determined in accordance with Section 109.03.E.2, “Labor,” and Section 109.03.E.4, “Equipment,” not
 to exceed the cost of transporting the equipment by an established
 hauler. If the Contractor uses an established hauler to transport the
 equipment, the Department will pay the Contractor the invoice price
 paid to the hauler and 50 percent of the hourly ownership costs determined in accordance with the Rental Rate Blue Book. Transportation
 costs include loading and unloading.
 (3) If the Contractor moves the equipment operator to the project site
 with the equipment and the operator only performs the revised work,
 the Department will pay the Contractor for the operator’s labor costs
 based on the salary paid by the Contractor. Submit to the Engineer
 proof of the operator’s salary.
 115
 
 109.03 E.4.c
 
 c. Leased, Rented, or Hired Equipment.
 The Department will pay the Contractor for leased, rented, or hired equipment used to perform the revised work at the invoice price, including
 sales tax, paid by the Contractor. Submit to the Engineer the invoices for
 the leased, rented, or hired equipment. The Engineer will convert weekly
 invoice rates to hourly rates by dividing the weekly rate by 40 hours per
 week, and monthly invoices rates to hourly rates by dividing the monthly
 rate by 176 hours per month.
 The Department will not pay the Contractor more than the invoice price
 for a leased, rented, or hired piece of equipment.
 d. Operating Costs.
 The Department will pay the Contractor for the operating costs of owned
 and leased, rented, or hired equipment based on the operating costs listed
 in the Rental Rate Blue Book.
 e. Standby Time.
 The Department will not pay for equipment on standby unless the Engineer directs the standby in writing, or the standby is proven to be as
 the direct result of the Department’s actions or inactions. If the Engineer
 directs standby or standby results from the Department’s actions or inactions, the Department will pay for the standby time as follows:
 (1) For owned equipment, at 50 percent of the hourly ownership costs
 determined in accordance with the Rental Rate Blue Book; and
 (2) For leased, rented, or hired equipment, at 50 percent of the hourly
 invoice costs determined in accordance with Section 109.03.E.4.c,
 “Leased, Rented, or Hired Equipment.”
 The Department will not pay the Contractor for the operating costs of
 equipment on standby.
 If the equipment operates for more than 8 hours on any day or 40 hours
 in any week, the Department will not pay the Contractor for standby time
 for that day or week. If the equipment operates for less than 8 hours on
 any normal work day or less than 40 hours in any normal work week, the
 Department will only pay the Contractor for standby time based on the
 difference between the operating time on a normal work day and 8 hours
 per day or the difference between the operating time in a normal work
 week and 40 hours per week. The Department will not pay the Contractor
 for standby time on any day that is not normally a work day.
 5. Subcontracting.
 Obtain the Engineer’s written approval to use a subcontractor to perform the
 revised work.
 The Department will pay the Contractor for revised work performed by a
 subcontractor as determined by the Engineer in accordance with Section
 109.03.E.2, “Labor,” Section 109.03.E.3, “Material,” Section 109.03.E.4,
 “Equipment,” and Section 109.03.E.6, “Specialty Work.” Submit itemized
 daily records for the approved revised work performed by a subcontractor in
 accordance with Section 109.03.E.7, “Daily Records.”
 116
 
 109.03 E.9
 
 The Department will pay the Contractor an additional amount for approved
 revised work performed by a subcontractor, as a mark-up on the Engineerdetermined costs to cover administrative costs, and field and home office
 overhead. The mark-up for revised work performed by a subcontractor is 10
 percent of the first $15,000 plus 5 percent of any amount over $15,000. The
 Department will not pay an additional mark-up for revised work performed
 by a subcontractor under contract to a subcontractor.
 6. Specialty Work.
 Obtain the Engineer’s written approval to use a specialty subcontractor to
 perform revised work covered by specialty items.
 The Department will pay the Contractor for revised work covered by specialty items at the invoice price paid by the Contractor. Submit invoices for
 the approved specialty work. The Department may adjust the invoice price
 to match the current market price for the specialty work.
 The Department will pay the Contractor an additional amount for approved
 specialty work as a mark-up on the invoiced price to cover administrative
 costs and field and home office overhead. The mark-up for specialty work is
 10 percent of the first $5,000 plus 3 percent of any amount over $5,000.
 7. Daily Records.
 Compare and reconcile the records of labor, materials, and equipment used
 in the performance of the revised work at the end of each day or shift with
 the Engineer on a Statement of Daily Force Account Work (SFN 14462).
 8. Statements.
 Submit itemized statements for each week reflecting all costs for the revised
 work, detailed as follows:
 a. Name, classification, date, daily hours, total hours, wage rate, health and
 welfare benefits, and extension for each laborer and foreman.
 b. Quantities of materials, prices, extensions, and transportation costs paid
 by the Contractor. Include invoices for the material, including any transportation charges. Adjust the statements, if applicable, to show any discounts offered by the supplier.
 c. Designation, dates, daily hours, total hours, rental rate, and extension for
 each unit of equipment. For rented equipment, include invoices and rental
 agreements.
 d. For revised work performed by a subcontractor, the same information
 required in items a, b, and c, above.
 e. Invoices for revised work performed by a specialty subcontractor.
 9. Payment.
 After receipt of statements and invoices, the Engineer will prepare a summary statement of the force account work and provide to the Contractor for
 verification and approval. The Department will pay for revised work within
 30 calendar days after receiving all the required information and Contractorapproved summary statements.
 117
 
 109.03 F
 
 F. Delay Costs.
 1. General.
 For a compensable delay as identified in Section 108.06.B.5, “Excusable, Compensable Delays,” the Department will pay for the costs incurred by the Contractor because of the delay as specified in Section 109.03.F, “Delay Costs.”
 The Department will not pay for delay costs before the Contractor submits
 an itemized statement of those costs. The Engineer will verify the statements
 before authorizing payment.
 The Department will not compensate the Contractor for delays caused by
 work that the Department has paid the Contractor for as specified elsewhere
 in Section 109.03, “Compensation for Contract Revisions.”
 2. Extended Field Office Overhead.
 The Department will pay the Contractor for extended field office overhead
 costs as follows:
 a. For general field supervision, including supervisors, assistants, watchpersons, clerks, and other field support staff, calculate the labor costs as
 specified in Section 109.03.E.2, “Labor.”
 b. For field office facilities and supplies, which include field office trailers,
 tool trailers, office equipment rental, temporary toilets, and other incidental facilities and supplies, calculate the costs as follows:
 (1) For field office trailers, tool trailers, and other rented or owned equipment at a daily rate equal to 8 hours per day at the hourly rate determined in accordance with Section 109.03.E.4, “Equipment.” Apply
 the daily rate to the number of days that each trailer or equipment is
 at the project site longer because of the delay.
 (2) For office equipment rental, temporary toilets, and other incidental
 facilities and supplies, at a daily rate determined by dividing the
 monthly rental costs by the number of calendar days in each month.
 Apply the daily rate to the number of days that each facility or supply
 is at the project site longer because of the delay.
 c. For maintenance of field operations costs, which include telephone, electric, water, and other similar costs, calculate a daily rate for these costs by
 dividing the monthly charges for these services by the number of calendar
 days each month. Apply the daily rate to the number of days of delay.
 3. Idle or Extended Labor.
 Calculate these labor costs during delays as specified in Section 109.03.E.2,
 “Labor,” for all non-salaried personnel remaining on the project as approved
 by the Engineer.
 4. Escalated Labor.
 To receive payment for escalated labor, demonstrate that the delay forced
 performance of the work into a period when higher labor costs than the Contractor would have experienced absent the delay. Provide adequate supporting documentation for labor costs, allowances, and benefits.
 118
 
 109.04 A
 
 5. Standby Equipment or Equipment Demobilization.
 The Department will pay the Contractor the standby equipment rate determined in Section 109.03.E.4, “Equipment,” for equipment, other than small
 tools, required to remain at the project site during the delay. The Department
 will pay the Contractor’s transportation costs to remove and return equipment not required to remain at the project site during the delay.
 6. Materials Escalation or Material Storage.
 The Department will pay the Contractor for increased material costs or material storage costs due to the delay. Obtain the Engineer’s approval before
 storing material due to a delay.
 G. Non-Allowable Charges.
 For payments for contract revisions based on contract unit price, PS-1 price,
 negotiated price, or force account, the Department will not reimburse the Contractor for the following:
 1. Home office overhead or profit in excess of that specified in Section 109.03.E,
 “Force Account;”
 2. Profit mark-ups, as defined in Section 109.03.E, “Force Account,” on costs
 resulting from Engineer-ordered suspensions in accordance with Section
 104.02.D, “Suspension of Work Ordered by the Engineer;”
 3. Changes in carrier rates or in the costs of any other transportation facilities
 used in the performance of the work during the project;
 4. Loss of anticipated profit;
 5. Damages, including special, incidental, consequential, or other damages associated with loss of bonding capacity, loss of bidding opportunities, and
 insolvency, even if the Contractor notifies the Department of the likelihood
 of such damages;
 6. Indirect costs;
 7. Attorney fees, claims preparation expenses, or costs of litigation;
 8. Interest; and
 9. Any other cost not specifically allowed by the contract.
 109.04 PROGRESSIVE PAYMENT
 A. General.
 The Department’s authorization to pay the Contractor in accordance with Section 109.04, “Progressive Payment,” does not constitute the Department’s final
 acceptance of any portion of the work or relieve the Contractor of its responsibility to complete the work as required by the contract.
 If the Contractor fails to comply with any contract requirement, the Department
 may withhold progressive payments. If the Department withholds progressive
 payments, the Department will only make the progressive payments after the
 Contractor is in full compliance with the contract.
 
 119
 
 109.04 B
 
 B. Intermediate Progressive Estimate and Payment.
 The Department will make progressive payments to the Contractor at least once
 each month as the work progresses. The Engineer will prepare a progressive estimate of the value of the work completed by the Contractor, including materials
 in accordance with Section 109.05, “Payment for Materials on Hand.”
 For each progressive estimate, the Engineer will calculate and retain payment
 for 2 percent of the estimated total work done to date.
 C. Semifinal Estimate and Payment.
 When the Engineer determines that the Contractor has completed more than 90
 percent of the work and the Contractor has met the all of the following conditions, the Engineer may prepare a semifinal estimate:
 1. Filed with the Department all pit releases, receipts of payment, and haul road
 releases;
 2. Submitted to the Engineer all up-to-date payrolls;
 3. Proven capable of completing the remaining work without being assessed
 liquidated damages in accordance with Section 108.07.B, “Failure to Complete within Contract Time;” and
 4. Is working diligently to complete the remaining work.
 For the semifinal estimate, the Engineer will calculate and retain payment for an
 amount not less than 1 and not more than 2 percent of the estimated total work
 done to date.
 When the Engineer determines that the Contractor has completed 100 percent of
 the original work not including contract revisions, and the Contractor has met
 all of the conditions listed above in items 1 through 4, the Engineer may prepare
 a second semifinal estimate. For the second semifinal estimate, the Engineer
 will calculate and retain payment for less than 1 percent of the estimated total
 work done to date.
 D. Prompt Payment.
 Within 20 calendar days of receiving payment from the Department, pay subcontractors their portion of the payment less applicable retainage, not to exceed
 2 percent. If the Contractor does not make prompt payment, the subcontractor
 may notify the Engineer.
 The Contractor may withhold payment to a subcontractor for just cause. If withholding payment from a subcontractor, immediately provide written notification
 to the subcontractor and the Engineer with the reasons for withholding the payment. If the Engineer determines the Contractor is withholding payment with
 just cause, interest will not accrue.
 If the Engineer determines the Contractor is withholding payment without just
 cause, beginning on the 21st calendar day after the Contractor’s receipt of payment
 from the Department interest will accrue for the subcontractor at the rate provided
 by NDCC 13-01.1-02. Additionally, the Department may withhold all payments to
 the Contractor until the Contractor properly pays the subcontractor and agrees to
 make all future payments to subcontractors as required by the contract.
 
 120
 
 109.05 A
 
 The Department will apply these prompt payment procedures to all tiers of subcontracts, in accordance with 49 CFR 26.29.
 E. Subcontractor Retainage.
 Pay the withheld retainage to a subcontractor within 20 calendar days after the
 satisfactory completion of the subcontractor’s work. The Engineer will determine satisfactory completion of the subcontractor’s work. The Department considers satisfactory completion of subcontractor work as the accomplishment of
 all of the tasks included in the subcontract, documented in accordance with the
 contract, and paid by the Department.
 Obtain from the subcontractor and submit to the Engineer any of the following
 final documentation that is applicable to the subcontractor’s completed work:
 1. Certified payrolls;
 2. Materials certification;
 3. Haul road releases;
 4. Pit receipts of payment;
 5. Pit releases;
 6. Night watchperson reports;
 7. Warrantees;
 8. Operating manuals;
 9. Product literature;
 10. Verification of final quantities;
 11. DBE Participation Certification (SFN 14268);
 12. For non-bonded subcontractors, proof of payment for all material bills
 and wages (only submit copies of these documents upon the Engineer’s
 request); and
 13. Any other documents required by the contract for the subcontractor’s work.
 For retainage not released by the Contractor in accordance with this provision,
 interest will accrue at the rate provided by NDCC 13-01.1-02 beginning the 21st
 calendar day after satisfactory completion of the subcontractor’s work.

 109.05 PAYMENT FOR MATERIAL ON HAND
 The Department may make partial payment for material on hand that meets all of
 the following conditions:
 A. Is intended to be permanently incorporated into the work.
 
 121
 
 109.05 B
 
 B. Is delivered to or stockpiled at the project site, or other storage facility approved
 by the Engineer.
 C. Has a value over $5,000.
 D. Is not living or perishable.
 E. Is not an individual item used to fabricate items off the project site, except for
 structural steel before fabrication of bridge girders.
 Stockpile structural steel at the production plant or fabrication site and store the
 steel separate from steel for use in other work to qualify for payment as material
 on hand.
 Request payment by submitting a written request to the Engineer with the following
 information:
 A. A statement certifying that the material on hand complies with the contract and
 will comply at the time of placement.
 B. For material not produced or manufactured by the Contractor, a delivery invoice
 itemizing the material on hand.
 C. For material produced or manufactured by the Contractor, a fully documented
 statement of production costs, including the type of material, amount of material
 stockpiled, location of the stockpile, and an itemized breakdown of the cost to
 produce the material.
 The Department will limit payment for material on hand to a portion of the contract
 unit price as determined by the Engineer. The Department will not pay more than
 the Plan quantity of the contract item that covers payment for the material on hand.
 As the Contractor incorporates the material on hand into the work, the Department
 will deduct the amount paid for the material on hand from the payment.
 For material not produced or manufactured by the Contractor, within 35 calendar
 days after the date the Department released payment for the material on hand, the
 Contractor shall submit to the Engineer paid invoices for the material on hand covered by the payment. With each paid invoice, include a notarized statement from the
 supplier or fabricator certifying receipt of payment. If the Contractor fails to submit
 paid invoices, the Department will deduct the amount paid the Contractor for the
 material on hand from future payments and will not pay for the material on hand
 until the Contractor incorporates it into the work.
 The Department’s payment to the Contractor in accordance with Section 109.05,
 “Payment for Material on Hand,” is not the Department’s final acceptance of the
 material or any portion of the work. None of the following Department actions relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for all materials and work and any damage
 to the material or work:
 A. Payment for material on hand;
 B. Acceptance of quantities of material on hand; and
 C. Approval of the storage methods or locations.
 For lost, stolen, or damaged material, the Department will deduct the amount paid
 for the material on hand from future payments.
 122
 
 109.06
 
 The Department owns material paid for as material on hand, but the risk of loss
 remains with the Contractor. For material on hand paid by the Department and later
 determined unacceptable, the Department may deduct the value of the unacceptable
 material from future payments.
 109.06 FINAL PROGRESSIVE ESTIMATE AND PAYMENT
 After the Engineer notifies the Contractor of project acceptance in accordance with
 Section 105.15, “Acceptance,” the Engineer will prepare the final progressive estimate. For the final progressive estimate, the Engineer will calculate the total amount
 payable including the amount of the released retainage and will deduct all previous
 payments and any amounts owed to the Department in accordance with the contract.
 After the Contractor signs the final estimate, the Department will pay the balance.
 The Department may correct previous estimates and payments as necessary in the
 final estimate and payment.
 Before making any partial or final payment, the Department may require the Contractor to provide proof of compliance with all laws that directly or indirectly apply
 to the work.

 hours before testing. Construct the weighing mechanism so that it is unaffected
 by wind and other weather conditions.
 1. Bins.
 Equip the batch plant with individual bins, or a bin with individual compartments, for each aggregate component. Construct bins to prevent intermingling of aggregate. Use a scalping screen or other device on each bin that is
 capable of removing deleterious and oversized material from the aggregate.
 2. Weighing Hoppers.
 a. General.
 Use beam or springless dial-type weigh hopper scales. Adjust the balance
 to read zero before weighing each load.
 Do not allow the freely suspended hopper to contact anything that could
 affect proper functioning of the scale.
 Provide one standard 50 pound test weight for every 500 pounds of the
 scales capacity. Provide a minimum of 10 test weights up to a maximum
 of 20.
 Replace or repair scales that cannot be maintained accurately within the
 specified tolerances.
 Relieve air pressure build up by venting hoppers that are loaded by compressed air.
 Charge the weigh hopper to ensure the batched weights are within the
 tolerances as specified in Section 802.03 B, “Batching of Concrete Materials.” Weigh the separate aggregate components for each batch cumulatively in a single hopper or separately in individual hoppers. When
 weighed cumulatively, weigh the aggregate in the specified sequence.
 Use weigh hoppers that discharge material without loss and without manual assistance. If necessary, equip the hoppers with a vibrator to obtain
 complete discharge. Use hoppers that hold the materials without spillage.
 Use discharge gates that do not leak when closed.
 Use scales that are:
 – Certified by a scale service company registered with the North Dakota
 Public Service Commission. If the certification is more than 9 months
 140
 
 155.02 B.1
 
 old when the scale begins project use, have the scale recertified. Submit a copy of the certification before starting weighing operations.
 – Accurate to within 0.5 percent of the true weight of the applied load
 throughout the range of use.
 b. Dial Hopper Scales.

 Charge bulk cement and fly ash into the weigh hopper from weatherproof
 bins. Use a bin that is equipped to permit accurate control of the quantity of
 material withdrawn for each batch within the tolerances specified in Section
 802.03 B, “Batching of Concrete Materials.”
 B. Automatic Batching Equipment.
 1. General.
 Use automatic batching equipment on projects with over 3,000 CY of concrete.
 For each batch the only manual operation allowed is a single actuation of a
 starting device to proportion the designated quantity of each ingredient into
 the weigh hopper.
 Interlock the automatic batching equipment so that:
 – The charging mechanism of any weigh hopper cannot be opened until
 the scale has returned to zero and the discharge mechanism of the weigh
 hopper has closed;
 – The discharge mechanism of the weigh hopper cannot be opened if the
 charging mechanism is open;
 – The discharge mechanism cannot be opened until all ingredients have
 been batched to their designated weights; and
 – The aggregates are weighed in the specified sequence if separate aggregate components are weighed cumulatively in a single hopper.
 Preset the designated batch weight of bulk cement and fly ash and each separate aggregate component before the batch cycle starts.
 Equip the automatic scales for weighing bulk cement and fly ash with an
 automatic recording device that graphically records or prints the batched and
 empty weights. Use a weight recording mechanism that is accurate within
 one graduation of the chart or tape. Use graphic recording charts graduated
 for time intervals not exceeding 15 minutes, and with weight graduations not
 
 141
 
 155.02 B.1
 
 exceeding 0.1 percent of the nominal scale capacity. If using printed tapes,
 use tapes that record the consecutive batch number and ensure the minimum
 weight graduation printed on the tape does not exceed 0.1 percent of the
 scale capacity.
 Use automatic batching equipment that is capable of conversion to manual
 operation. If the automatic equipment breaks down, the Department will allow manual operation for up to 12 hours.
 2. Batch Tickets.

 203.05 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 The Engineer will measure as specified in Section 109.01, “Measurement of Quantities” and as follows:
 A. Excavation.
 The Engineer will measure excavation by taking an initial measurement of the
 original ground after removing topsoil and then a second measurement after
 removing the material but before placing topsoil.
 Conduct operations to allow the Engineer to measure the rock, shale, and muck
 excavation. If the Engineer was not allowed to measure the rock, shale, and
 muck excavation, it will be measured as “Common Excavation.”
 The Engineer will measure excavation of rock and shale up to 12 inches below
 grade as necessary to provide the designed thickness of backfill.
 The Engineer will deduct the quantity measure over-breakage of wasted rock
 excavation from the volume. The over-breakage quantity measured will not exceed 10 percent of the authorized quantity of rock excavation.
 The Engineer will measure the authorized excavation of muck.
 The Engineer will include coal in the measurement for “Common Excavation.”
 Where ramps are constructed to allow scrapers to cross a roadway, the Engineer will
 measure flagging hours as specified in Section 704, “Temporary Traffic Control.”
 B. Borrow Excavation.
 The Engineer will measure borrow excavation by taking an initial measurement
 of the original ground after removing topsoil and then a second measurement
 after removing the material but before placing topsoil.
 If borrow excavation is placed before using all available common excavation,
 the Engineer will deduct the quantity of unused common excavation from the
 measured quantity of borrow excavation. The Engineer will include the deducted quantity of borrow excavation in the common excavation quantity.
 Provide a minimum of 2 working days’ notice to allow the Engineer to complete
 the preliminary cross sectioning before removing topsoil. Remove and stockpile
 topsoil, as specified in Section 203.04 B, “Topsoil,” before excavation. Provide
 notice and allow 1 working day for the Engineer to complete the topsoil measurement before beginning borrow excavation.
 169
 
 203.05 C
 
 C. Topsoil.
 If the Engineer and Contractor agree, plan quantity will be used as the measurement for payment.
 D. Topsoil – Wetland.
 If the Engineer and Contractor agree, plan quantity will be used as the measurement for payment.
 E. Topsoil – Imported.
 The Engineer will measure imported topsoil by taking an initial measurement of
 the original ground and then a second measurement after placing the topsoil.
 F. Embankment.
 The Engineer will measure embankment by taking an initial measurement of the
 original ground and then a second measurement after placement of the material.
 G. Slope Reconstruction.
 The Engineer will measure each side of approach foreslope and ditch block
 slopes.
 H. Haul.
 The Engineer will measure haul distance as follows:
 – Along the centerline of the roadway, when material is obtained from the
 roadway and deposited inside the roadway; or
 – Along the shortest route, when material is obtained from outside the roadway.
 1. Authorized Haul.
 The Engineer will determine the authorized haul by multiplying the number
 of cubic yards of material moved from its original position and the distance,
 in stations, that the material was hauled. This will be expressed in the unit
 Cubic Yard Stations.
 2. Free Haul.
 The Engineer will determine the free haul distance by dividing the number
 of cubic yard stations between balance points by the ordinate of the mass
 diagram which is the yardage hauled. This will be expressed in stations.
 3. Overhaul.
 The Engineer will fix two points on the volume curve, one on each side of the
 neutral grade point such that the distance between the points equals the free
 haul distance. Material located between these points will not be considered
 when determining the overhaul distance.
 The Engineer will determine the overhaul distance by subtracting the free
 haul distance from the distance between the center of gravity of remaining
 mass of excavation and the remaining mass of embankment.
 The Engineer will determine overhaul by multiplying the number of cubic
 yards of material hauled by the overhaul distance. This number will be expressed in Cubic Yard Miles.

 the aggregate and bituminous mix as the mix is being produced and placed
 on the roadway.
 Perform the tests specified in Section 430.02, “Quality Control Testing” of
 the Field Sampling and Testing Manual at the designated frequencies. During aggregate production, test results must be made available by noon the
 day following the test. During mix production, furnish copies of test results
 upon completion of the test.
 If the QC test results for ND T 176 or ND T 113 indicate uniform results, the
 Engineer may issue a written notice reducing the frequency of these tests.
 2. Determination of Asphalt Content.
 Under the observation of the Engineer, determine the asphalt content each
 time a gradation test is taken. Base the asphalt content on readings from the
 totalizers for the aggregate and the asphalt as outlined in Asphalt Content
 and Virgin Aggregate Determination (SFN 18674).
 3. Sample Splitting.
 The Engineer will take possession of one half of the split QC sample and
 will perform testing on a portion of the material, as necessary.
 The portion of the sample submitted to the Engineer will be retained for 24
 hours after the QA test representing the lot of material has been performed.
 Either the Engineer or Contractor may request to have the remaining portion
 of the sample tested within the 24-hour timeframe. If a request is made, the
 Engineer will test the remaining portion of the QC sample and the Engineer’s
 results will be used as the basis for acceptance of the aggregate.
 4. Documentation.
 Maintain complete records of all process quality control tests. Record all
 test results and calculations and document results on Department provided forms. The required forms are available on the Department’s website at
 www.dot.nd.gov. The proper forms for individual tests are listed in the Field
 243
 
 430.04 E.4
 
 Sampling and Testing Manual.
 Maintain control charts at the QC laboratory. Record test results on the control charts immediately upon completion of the test. Record the following
 parameters on the control charts:
 – Gradation of the control sieves (1/2 Inch, #4, #30, and #200), (ND T 27
 and ND T 11);
 – Asphalt Content;
 – Theoretical Maximum Specific Gravity, (ND T 209);
 – Bulk Specific Gravity, (ND T 166);
 – Percent Air Voids of field Gyratory samples;
 – Daily average Air Voids percentage of the cores;
 – Average Daily Density;
 – Fines/Asphalt Ratio;
 – Asphalt Film Thickness (microns); and
 – Fine Aggregate Angularity.
 Control charts must display:
 – Single test control limits for each test parameter;
 – Individual test results;
 – Moving average control limits; and
 – Moving average of the last four tests.
 Color code the moving average results and control limits, and the single tests
 and control limits.
 Make the control charts available at the QC laboratory and accessible for review by the Engineer during the paving operations. Submit complete control
 charts upon completion of the paving operations.
 5. Control Limits.
 The field test results may vary from the mix design target values as shown in
 Table 430-07.
 The Engineer will allow a 2.0 percent of the material to be retained on the 5/8
 inch sieve providing all material passes the 3/4 inch sieve.

 a. Single Test Target Values.
 If an individual test falls outside the single test target value control limits,
 take immediate corrective action. After implementation of the corrective
 action, collect a sample and conduct the test that fell outside the control
 limits. If the test following the corrective action falls outside of the control limits discontinue paving operations until the cause is found and corrected. Resume paving operations only after obtaining approval from the
 Engineer.
 The test following the corrective action is used to determine the effectiveness of the corrective action. It is not used for acceptance of material and
 will not be factored into the moving average.
 If in an individual gradation test a single control sieve falls outside the
 single test target value control limits, continued production is allowed
 only if the air voids are within the control limits and the material passing
 the #200 sieve does not exceed the maximum specified in Table 430-01.
 Discontinue paving operations if two consecutive tests exceed the single
 245
 
 430.04 E.5.a
 
 test target value control limit for any of the following:
 – ND T 113, Lightweight Pieces in Aggregate;
 – ND T 304, Fine Aggregate Angularity;
 – NDDOT 4, Percentage of Fracture Particles in Coarse Aggregate; or
 – ND T 176, Plastic Fines in Graded Aggregates and Soils by Use of the
 Sand Equivalent Test.
 Resume paving operations only after taking corrective action and obtaining approval from the Engineer.
 b. Moving Average Target Values.
 The moving average for each test is determined using the 4 most recent
 test results.
 If the moving average for a test trends toward the moving average target
 value control limits, take corrective action. After implementation of the
 corrective action collect a sample and conduct the test that is trending
 towards the moving average control limits. The test following the corrective action is used to determine the effectiveness of the corrective action.
 It is not used for acceptance of material and will not be factored into the
 moving average. Document the corrective action.
 If the moving average for a test exceeds the moving average target value
 control limits, continued production is allowed only if the air voids are
 within the control limits and the material passing the #200 sieve does not
 exceed the maximum specified in Table 430-01.
 If the air voids are outside the control limits or the material passing the
 #200 sieve exceeds the maximum specified in Table 430-01, perform one
 of the following actions:
 – Implement corrective measures to produce mix that is based on the
 mix design; or
 – Request that new target values be set if the test results indicate that
 adjustments to the target values are necessary. Implement the adjusted
 target values only after receiving the Engineer’s written approval.
 If the moving average for air voids exceeds the moving average control
 limit, discontinue paving operations and implement corrective measures.
 The Engineer may allow continued paving if satisfied with the corrective
 measures. Resume quality control testing when the plant has started and
 operations are equalized.
 F. Surface Preparation.
 Remove deleterious material from the surface.
 Correct local irregularities in the existing surface before placing the first lift of
 bituminous material. If milling is specified, correct local irregularities after milling. Apply a tack coat to the surface before correcting the irregularities. Use the
 same type of mix that is required for the subsequent lift. Compact and roll the
 mix.
 246
 
 430.04 H.1
 
 The mix required for correcting local irregularities will be deducted from the
 total mix used for the project, meaning that the subsequent lift of pavement will
 be thinner than originally planned.
 Apply a tack coat to the surface and to the exposed edges of longitudinal and
 transverse joints before placing bituminous pavement. Apply a double application of tack coat to longitudinal joints and a minimum of one inch on either side
 of the joint. Apply a tack coat on a previously placed layer or surface of pavement before placing the next lift.
 G. Patching.
 Remove existing broken or unstable surface material and replace that material
 with the same mixture specified for the next course.
 Remove existing surfacing, base, and subgrade material to the depth required to
 obtain a stable subgrade.
 If required, place and compact approved aggregate from the bottom of existing
 bituminous pavement to a minimum depth of 3 inches below the existing surface.
 Place the bituminous material in lifts not to exceed 3 inches and compact the
 material. Allow the patch material to cool to 130°F before placing additional
 material. If the breakup occurs during the paving operation allow the patch material to cool to 185°F before placing additional material.
 H. Spreading and Finishing.
 1. General.
 Do not place bituminous mixture on a damp pavement surface, on a frozen
 roadbed, or when weather conditions prevent the proper handling and finishing of the bituminous mixtures.
 Use bituminous pavers to spread and finish mixtures to the required section
 leaving the mixture uniformly dense, smooth, and free from irregularities.
 In locations where it is impractical to use normal laydown equipment the
 Engineer will allow other methods.
 The surface thickness shown on the plans is for estimating purposes only.
 Place pavement to use the estimated tonnage uniformly throughout the roadway.
 Supply mix that is uniform and homogeneous. The Engineer will reject loads
 of mix or sections of pavement containing uncoated batches of aggregate or
 segregated materials.
 Remove and replace material that is visibly segregated. If a paver placed the
 material, remove the segregated material to the full width of the paver. If the
 material was placed by hand, remove the full area of segregated material,
 plus an additional 6 inches around the entire segregated area.
 Place material in lifts between 1.5 and 2.5 inches of compacted bituminous
 material. Leveling courses may be placed with thickness less than 1.5 inches.
 
 247
 
 430.04 H.1
 
 Place bituminous mixture so a single lane is not more than one day’s run
 in advance of any adjacent lane. Leveling courses are excluded from this
 requirement.
 Do not place bituminous pavement on bridge decks.
 Place and follow markings to guide the paver. Construct longitudinal joints
 in a uniform line. Correct pavement edges that deviate from the uniform line
 and correct areas of the longitudinal joint that vary from the intended location of the joint by more than 2 inches. Construct longitudinal joints with
 tight seems and no visible segregation.
 2. Air and Surface Temperature Requirements.
 Place a subsequent lift after the previous lift has cooled to 130°F.
 Place bituminous mix without supplementary admixture when the temperatures are at or above the requirements in Table 430-08. Include a supplementary admixture such as Evotherm, AD-here LOF 65-00 EU, or an approved
 equal in the bituminous mixture when placing bituminous mix when temperatures are within the ranges shown in Table 430-09. Do not place bituminous
 mix when temperatures are below those shown in Table 430-09.

 If placing bituminous mix according to Table 430-09, submit the supplementary admixture manufacturer’s dosage rate and any changes to the mix
 design. The supplementary admixture may be added to the asphalt binder
 by the supplier or refiner, or by the Contractor at the asphalt plant. Add the
 admixture to the binder according to the supplementary admixture manufacturer’s recommendations. If the admixture is added at the plant, equip
 the plant with a metering device that records the rate of admixture. Tie the
 metering device into the same system that measures the other components of
 the mix.

 Measure the existing mat temperature using one of the following methods:
 – Using an infrared sensing thermometer; or
 – Insert a conventional thermometer into a 1 inch deep hole in the pavement. Fill the hole with water, oil, or grease.
 3. Mix Temperature Requirements.
 Discharge mix from the mixer with a temperature no higher than the bituminous material manufacturer’s recommendation. If there are no recommendations on maximum mix temperature, discharge mix with a maximum
 temperature of 300°F.
 When the ambient temperature is 60°F or higher, place mix with a minimum
 laydown temperature of 230°F. When the temperature is below 60°F, place
 mix with a minimum laydown temperature of 250°F.
 I. Compaction.
 1. General.
 Remove all surface irregularities before beginning compaction.
 Sequence rolling operations and select the type and the number of rollers to
 match production and to attain the required density before the mat temperatures fall below 185°F.
 In areas not accessible to rollers, compact the pavement mat with hand or
 mechanical tampers.
 2. Calculated Density.
 a. General.
 Use calculated density on mainline pavement, interstate crossroads,
 ramps, turn lanes, rest area approaches, and parking lots.
 b. Coring.
 (1) General.
 The recorded average density of each sublot will be determined using the density of pavement cores.
 The Engineer will designate locations for obtaining pavement cores.
 Under the observation of the Engineer, obtain two cores in each sublot. Obtain cores adjacent to each other. The recorded average density
 of the sublot will be the average of the density of the two cores.
 Use a machine that cuts a cylindrical core sample without disturbing
 the density of the sample. Complete coring on or before the working
 day following the placement of the lift. Obtain a core with a smooth
 outer surface, no distortion of the cylindrical shape, and no displacement of the aggregate particles. Obtain a core that is 4 to 6 inches in
 diameter and the full depth of the in place asphalt. Use a masonry saw
 to cut the core so that only the layer to be tested is removed.
 Label each core, using a system approved by the Engineer, to identify
 the location from which the core was obtained.
 
 249
 
 430.04 I.2.b.(1)
 
 Fill core holes before placing the subsequent lift of pavement. If there
 is no subsequent lift of pavement, fill the core hole within 24 hours
 of obtaining the core. Remove free standing water before filling core
 holes. Fill core holes in 2-inch lifts using material from the same mix
 design used on the roadway. Compact each lift using a hand tamper.
 (2) Pavement Thickness Determination Cores.
 After the placement of the final lift of pavement, at locations designated by the Engineer and under the observation of the Engineer,
 obtain one full depth core per mile. Label the cores The Engineer will
 take possession of these cores immediately upon extraction. Do not
 cut these cores.
 3. Ordinary Compaction.
 a. General.
 Use ordinary compaction on shoulders, driveways, section line approaches, bike paths, leveling courses, and patches.
 Ordinary compaction consists of breakdown rolling, intermediate rolling,
 and finish rolling. Compact the bituminous material until the surface is
 tightly bound and shows no displacement under operation of the roller.
 For patching, immediately after spreading perform initial rolling with
 pneumatic-tired rollers or combination rollers.
 b. Breakdown Rolling.
 Breakdown rolling consists of one or more complete coverage with a
 roller meeting the requirements of one of the following sections:
 – 151.01 A.3, “Self-Propelled Pneumatic-Tired Rollers;”
 – 151.01 B.2, “Smooth-Faced Steel-Wheel Roller: Tandem – Type A;”
 – 151.01 C, “Vibratory Rollers;” or
 – 151.01 D, “Combination Rollers.”
 c. Intermediate Rolling.
 Follow breakdown rolling with intermediate rolling with a roller conforming to Section 151.01 A.3, “Self-Propelled Pneumatic-Tired Rollers,” or 151.01 D, “Combination Rollers” until the surface is tightly
 bound and shows no displacement under the roller.
 If roller tires pick up the bituminous material or there are excessive roller
 marks in the mat and it appears to the Engineer that compaction is being
 achieved, the Engineer may allow the removal of the intermediate rolling
 operation.
 d. Finish Rolling.
 Perform the finish rolling with a roller conforming to Section 151.01 B.3,
 “Smooth-Faced Steel-Wheel Roller: Tandem – Type B,” or 151.01 C,
 “Vibratory Rollers” in the static mode, and continue until roller marks are
 eliminated.
 J. Joints.
 250
 
 430.04 M.3
 
 1. General.
 Place pavement against the surface of curbing, gutters, manholes, and similar structures uniformly near the contact surfaces so the pavement is slightly
 higher than the edge of the structure after compaction. Do not construct a
 joint on top of a joint from a previous lift.
 2. Longitudinal Joints.
 Construct longitudinal joints on successive lifts between 6 and 12 inches
 from the previous longitudinal joint.
 3. Transverse Joints.
 Construct transverse joints on successive lifts a minimum of 12 feet from the
 previous transverse joint.
 K. Tolerances.
 Correct surface irregularities that exceed 3/16 inch measured with a 16-foot
 straightedge
 L. Pavement Sloughs.
 Compact pavement sloughs with rollers capable of providing a smooth finished
 compacted slough that is free of tire marks and unevenness and drop-offs. The
 Engineer will not require density tests.
 M. Acceptance.
 The Engineer will accept bituminous mix based on the following criteria:
 1. Aggregate.
 The Engineer will accept aggregate used in the mix based QC tests that are
 verified by QA testing and the control limits specified in Section 430.04 E.5,
 “Control Limits.”
 If the results for two consecutive aggregate gradation tests in a single day fall
 outside the single test target value control limits, the Engineer will apply a
 contract price adjustment as specified in Section 430.06 C, “Contract Price
 Adjustments.”
 2. Asphalt Content.
 The Engineer will base the acceptance of the asphalt content of bituminous
 mix on the totalizer readings obtained as specified in Section 430.04 E, “QC
 Testing” and the Mix Bitumen Cut-Off Report (SFN 9988) and will apply a
 contract price adjustment as specified in Section 430.06 C, “Contract Price
 Adjustments.”
 If the average asphalt content, as determined by the Engineer according to
 the Mix Bitumen Cut-off Report, (SFN 9988) deviates from the target value
 by 0.40 percentage points or more, the Engineer may reject the material. If
 the material is accepted, the Engineer will apply a contract price adjustment
 as specified in Section 430.06 C, “Contract Price Adjustments.”
 3. Field Density.
 This section will apply when the pavement is constructed as specified in
 Section 430.04 I.2, “Calculated Density.”
 The Engineer will base acceptance of the density of hot mix asphalt on the
 average density of the pavement compared to the daily average maximum
 251
 
 430.04 M.3
 
 theoretical density. The comparison will be made using Density Pay Factor
 (SFN 59132).
 The Engineer will determine the density of pavement based on lots. A lot
 is equal to the amount of material, in tons, placed each production day. If a
 shoulder, or part of a shoulder, is placed monolithically with the mainline,
 the shoulder area will be excluded from the quantity of material represented
 by the lot.
 A sublot is defined as a single lift, one paver width wide, and 2,000 feet long.
 If a partial sublot is less than 1,000 feet, it will be included in the previous
 sublot. A partial sublot greater than 1,000 feet in length will be considered a
 separate sublot.
 The density of a lot will be determined using the recorded average densities
 of the sublots contained within the lot. The recorded average densities of the
 sublots will be totaled and divided by the number of sublots within the lot to
 obtain the average density of the pavement.
 If the average density of the pavement compared to the daily average maximum theoretical density is above the values in Table 430-10, the Engineer
 will apply a contract price adjustment as specified in Section 430.06 C,
 “Contract Price Adjustments.”
 If the average density of the pavement compared to the daily average maximum theoretical density is at or below the values specified in Table 430-10,
 remove and replace the pavement.

 430.05 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 The Engineer will measure, completed and in place, as specified in Section 109.01,
 “Measurement of Quantities” and the following:
 A. Bituminous Pavement.
 The Engineer will pay for the tonnage of bituminous mix used in the accepted
 pavement and will make no deduction for the weight of asphalt cement used in
 the mixture.
 B. Asphalt Cement.
 The Engineer will determine the quantity of asphalt cement used each day by
 completing the Mix Bitumen Cutoff Report (SFN 9988).
 C. Cored Sample.
 The Engineer will measure each individual cored sample that is removed in the
 required condition.
 D. Tack.
 
 252
 
 430.06 C.2
 
 Tack will be measured as specified in Section 401.05, “Method of Measurement.”

 B. Tack.
 Tack will be paid for as specified in Section 401.06, “Basis of Payment.”
 C. Contract Price Adjustments.
 1. General.
 The Engineer will calculate the Combined Adjustment Factor by multiplying the individual adjustment factors for:
 – Aggregate gradation;
 – Asphalt content; and
 – Compaction.
 The Combined Adjustment Factor will be subtracted from 1.0 to determine
 the Contract Price Adjustment Factor.
 The contract price adjustment will be determined by multiplying the Contract Price Adjustment Factor by the total tons of hot mix asphalt placed
 during a single day and the contract unit price for “Superpave, FAA __.”
 2. Aggregate Gradation Adjustment Factor.
 The aggregate gradation adjustment factor will only be applied if two consecutive aggregate gradation tests in a single day contain a sieve that is outside the Single Test Target Value Control limits specified in Table 430-07. If
 different sieves fall outside the limits on consecutive tests, the adjustment
 factor will be applied.
 If more than one sieve exceeds the Single Test Value Control Limits, the
 Engineer will use the largest uniformity deviation (U) when determining the
 adjustment factor.
 When the aggregate gradation factor is applied, the Engineer will calculate
 253
 
 430.06 C.2
 
 the adjustment factor using the largest deviation (U) to calculate the adjustment factor.
 Adjustment Factor = (100-U)
 100
 3. Asphalt Content Adjustment Factor.
 For each day’s production, the Engineer will apply the lowest adjustment
 factor determined from the average or uniformity methods.
 a. Average.
 The Engineer will determine average asphalt content using the Mix Bitumen Cut-off Report (SFN 9988) and apply the appropriate adjustment
 factor specified in Table 430-11.
 If the average asphalt content deviates from the mix design by 0.40 percentage points or more, the Engineer will determine the adjustment factor in accordance with Section 105.07, “Conformance with the Contract
 Requirements,” or may reject the material.

 b. Uniformity.
 The Engineer will determine the average asphalt cement content based
 on the totalizer readings specified in Section 430.04 E, “QC Testing” and
 the Asphalt Content and Virgin Aggregate Determination Report (SFN
 18674).
 If the asphalt content from any random reading varies from the daily average of the readings by more than 0.24 percentage points, the Engineer
 will calculate the adjustment factor according to Daily Report – Hot Bituminous Pavement – Quality Control (SFN 18552).
 Adjustment Factor = (100 - [20(Deviation-0.24)])
 100
 4. Compaction Adjustment Factor.
 The adjustment factor for compaction will not be used for areas constructed
 according to Section 430.04 I.3, “Ordinary Compaction.”
 If the average density of the field cores is less than the daily average maximum theoretical density, the Engineer will apply the appropriate adjustment
 factor specified in Table 430-12 or Table 430-13.

 after fabrication, including the time the bars are placed before concrete placement. If covering the bars, provide ventilation to prevent condensation.
 The Engineer will reject bars if damage to the epoxy coating exceeds 2 percent
 of the surface area of the coated reinforcing bar in any 1-foot length. Repair remaining bars as recommended by the manufacturer. Remove rust before making
 repairs. The Engineer will reject bars if the patched area, excluding the cut ends,
 exceeds 5 percent of the surface area.
 B. Mix Design.
 1. General.
 261
 
 550.04 B.1
 
 Develop a mix design. Perform the tests for the mix design as specified in the
 Field Sampling and Testing Manual. Submit the completed mix design and
 all test data a minimum of 14 days before beginning paving operations.
 During the development of the mix design, develop a maturity curve as
 specified in ASTM C 1074. The water/cement (w/c) ratio used to develop
 the maturity curve is the target w/c ratio for the mix. Provide mix with a w/c
 ratio with a tolerance of 0.01 from the target w/c ratio.
 Deliver the samples and the mix design, including the test results, to the
 Materials and Research Division a minimum of 14 calendar days before beginning paving operations. The same day the material is delivered, notify the
 Engineer that the samples have been delivered. Provide the Engineer with a
 copy of the mix design and the test results at the same time they are submitted to the Materials and Research Division.
 The Department requires a maximum of 14 calendar days to verify mix designs before the Engineer will allow paving operations to begin. The Engineer will verify the maturity curve on the first day of concrete placement
 according to ASTM C 1074, as modified in the Field Sampling and Testing
 Manual.
 2. Samples.
 The Engineer will verify the mix design. The materials used in the mix design shall be the same as those used on the project. Attach a tag to the samples identifying the Department’s project number and type of material.
 Supply samples of material based on the minimum sample size specified in
 Table 550-01. Provide additional material upon request.

 C. Roadbed Condition.
 Do not operate mixing equipment or haul material on the finished grade except
 when the operation of this equipment off the finish grade is impractical due to
 restricted access.
 Place concrete on a smooth, compacted, and moist roadbed. Do not place concrete over standing water or mud.
 D. Placing and Spreading Concrete.
 1. General.
 Do not use materials containing frost or lumps of frozen material.
 262
 
 550.04 B.3.b
 
 Do not place concrete on or against frozen ground.
 The Engineer will reject loads of concrete with air content outside the limits
 specified in Section 802.01 H, “Air Content.” The Engineer will test each
 subsequent load of concrete to determine the air content until the concrete is
 within the limits Placement of concrete will not be allowed until the Engineer has determined the air content is within the limits.
 Adjacent concrete may be used as a side after the concrete has attained a
 minimum compressive strength of 3,000 psi or a minimum flexural strength
 of 450 psi.
 If concrete placement is interrupted and it appears that the head of concrete is
 drying out, cover the unfinished face with wet burlap. Keep the burlap damp.
 Remove burlap and plastic sheeting and uniformly blend the concrete with
 the fresh concrete when resuming placement operations.
 Install a transverse joint as specified in Section 550.04 G.4, “Transverse
 Construction Joints,” if 45 minutes elapses between the placement of successive batches or loads.
 Use a mechanical spreader for initial strike off and to spread concrete uniformly across the full width of the slab. The Engineer may approve other
 methods of spreading where a mechanical spreader is not feasible.
 The Engineer will allow the use of approved portable vibratory equipment if
 full width vibratory equipment is not feasible.
 Do not over vibrate. Remove and replace areas with excessive surface mortar
 and segregated material.
 Protect the thermocouple wire that the Engineer places into the plastic concrete.
 2. Formed Paving.
 Securely stake the side forms. Reset forms that are disturbed or show evidence of an unstable foundation.
 After staking, recompact the grade with a mechanical tamper at both the
 inside and outside edges at the base of the forms.
 Install forms that do not deviate from the proposed alignment by more than:
 – 1/8 inches vertically; and
 – 1/2 inches horizontally.
 Provide a minimum of two hours before paving to allow the Engineer to
 inspect the forms.
 3. Slip Form Paving.
 a. String Line.
 Use and maintain a taut string line for operating the automatic equipment
 controls.
 b. Consolidation Vibrator Operation.
 263
 
 550.04 B.3.b
 
 Operate internal vibrators within a frequency range of 4,000 to 8,000
 vibrations per minute.
 Operate surface vibrators within a frequency range of 3,500 to 6,000 vibrations per minute.
 Reduce vibrator frequency when forward motion of the paver is reduced
 and stop vibrators when forward motion of the paver is stopped.
 Use a vibrator monitor that records at intervals of 25 feet or 5 minutes,
 whichever occurs first. Provide both electronic and printed records each
 day that state:
 – Time;
 – Station;
 – Speed; and
 – Operating frequency of individual vibrators.
 Do not delete the data from the vibratory monitoring system until the records are in their final form and given to the Engineer. The Engineer will
 allow one of the records to be produced in an office. Provide the original
 record before taking the data into the office. Provide an electronic record
 that is a comma or spaces delimited text file, adequate for insertion into a
 computerized spreadsheet software package.
 Provide a written explanation each week that details:
 – Vibrator setting changes;
 – Out of tolerance vibratory operations; and
 – Monitoring device malfunctions.
 E. Placing Reinforcing Steel and Tie Bars.
 1. General.
 Use reinforcing steel and tie bars free of material that could impair the bond
 between the steel and concrete.
 Place the reinforcing steel and tie bars on approved supports a minimum of
 2000 feet ahead of the paving operation. On smaller placements, place reinforcement in advance of the pavement as far as practical.
 Provide a micro covermeter on projects with over 20,000 square yards of
 concrete paving for the use of the Engineer to confirm bar locations.
 2. Tie Bars.
 Position the tie bars within the following tolerances:
 – 1 inch vertically; and
 – 3 inches transversely.
 When installing tie bars in a sawed longitudinal joint, secure the location of
 the tie bars using tie bar baskets or other approved fixed supports.
 
 264
 
 550.04 G.1
 
 Place tie bars used in longitudinal construction joints using one of the following methods:
 – Into the side of plastic concrete when using a slip form paver;
 – Through holes in the side forms; or
 – Using approved two-piece connectors.
 If the specified tolerance is not obtained by the insertion of tie bars into the
 side of the plastic concrete, support the tie bars approved fixed supports or
 two-piece connectors.
 3. Reinforcing Steel.
 Place reinforcement for continuously reinforced concrete to within 1 inch of
 the specified location, both horizontally and vertically. Use plastic, plastic
 coated, or epoxy coated bar supports to support epoxy coated reinforcing
 bars. Use plastic coated wire for tying epoxy coated reinforcing bar.
 Under the observation of the Engineer, verify the placement of reinforcement in the plastic concrete pavement at the start of paving each day and
 every 500 feet during paving.
 F. Uncontrolled Cracking.
 Use any means and methods necessary to saw the joints in the concrete pavement to prevent uncontrolled cracking.
 Repair or remove and replace concrete pavement where uncontrolled cracks
 have occurred. Perform removal and replacement work as specified in Section
 570, “Concrete Pavement Repair”. If the cracks have occurred due to Contractor
 operations the repairs will be at no additional cost to the Department.
 If the Contractor can provide proof to the satisfaction of the Engineer that the
 uncontrolled cracking was not the fault of Contractor operations, the Department will pay for the repairs as specified in Section 104.02, “Contract Revisions.”
 Submit a corrective action plan that details how the uncontrolled cracked area
 will be repaired or removed and replaced within 7 days after the uncontrolled
 cracking occurs. Once the corrective action plan is approved, complete the corrective action plan within 30 days. Include in the plan dowel bar assemblies
 when applicable. Restore any base or subgrade that is damaged during the removal and replacement process at no additional cost to the Department. Restore
 drainable base by using Class 7 aggregate.
 G. Joints.
 1. General.
 Repair spalls deeper than 1/4 inch by patching with an epoxy mortar. Perform patching when the ambient and pavement temperatures are greater than
 40°F.
 Clean the spall area. Prime the spall surface with a brush application of epoxy binder. Mix the epoxy binder as recommended by the manufacturer. Insert material in the joint that will not bond to the epoxy to form the faces of
 
 265
 
 550.04 G.1
 
 the spall patch. Blend dry concrete sand into the mixture to give an epoxy
 mortar of trowelable consistency. Place and finish the epoxy mortar in the
 spall area. Place dry concrete sand on the finished epoxy mortar surface.
 After the epoxy mortar has cured, remove the inserts.
 2. Transverse Contraction Joints.
 Mark the location of the joints to be sawed or formed on the plastic concrete
 surface. Saw the joints on mainline and shoulders. On small areas or tapers,
 create the joints by sawing, inserting preformed inserts, or forming 1 inch
 deep grooves in the pavement surface.
 Stake a metal dowel bar assembly to the roadbed that holds the dowel bars
 within 1/8 inch of the proposed alignment and elevation. Mark the position
 of the assembly to locate the transverse joint over the center of the dowel
 bars. Do not cut the assembly ties running parallel to the dowel bars.
 Place dowel bar assemblies a minimum of 2,000 feet ahead of the paving
 operation.
 Use dowel bars that have a uniform coat of Tectyl 506 applied by the manufacturer, field applied NLGI Grade #2 multipurpose lithium grease, or an
 approved equal that has been applied to the full length of the dowel bars.
 a. Sawed Joints.
 Begin relief sawing as soon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently to
 permit sawing without raveling or moving of aggregate.
 Remove residue from joints immediately after sawing is completed using
 pressurized water.
 If side forms are in place, saw within 1/2 inch of the forms.
 If impervious membrane cure has been removed due to sawing or flushing operations during the curing period, reapply cure to the area within 30
 minutes of the cure being removed.
 b. Formed Joints.
 Construct formed joints by installing a pre-formed insert into the plastic
 concrete before final surface finishing.
 Vibrate the inserts into place or install in a groove formed by a vibrating
 cutter bar. Ensure the inserts top edges are flush with the concrete surface. Correct surface deformations caused by installation of inserts using
 hand-finishing methods and straight-edge the surface across the joint as
 specified in Section 550.04 I.1.c, “Straightedging.” Remove inserts, except those designed to remain, without damage to adjacent concrete.
 3. Transverse Expansion Joints.
 Install dowel bar assemblies in the expansion joint. Secure the dowel bars
 within 1/8 inch of the proposed alignment and elevation with a metal dowel
 bar assembly device staked to the roadbed. Coat the free half of each dowel
 with a thin uniform coat of Tectyl 506, NLGI Grade #2 multipurpose lithium
 grease, or an approved equal. Cover the free half of each dowel with a metal
 or plastic dowel cap or sleeve after application of release agent. Use caps or
 sleeves that fit the dowel bars tightly and the closed ends are watertight.
 266
 
 550.04 G.5
 
 Install preformed expansion joint filler. Connect abutting ends of individual
 sections of filler without any gap. Pre-punch the filler to fit around the dowels.
 Support the preformed filler perpendicular to the pavement surface by one of
 the following:
 – An expansion joint assembly that is staked into the subgrade;
 – A load transfer assembly or a device designed to remain in the pavement;
 and
 – A suitable installing bar or header.
 Protect the top edge of filler with a removable, non-aluminum channel cap
 that has flanges a minimum of 1.5 inches deep.
 Do not place concrete against the joint until the Engineer has approved the
 installation of the expansion joint assembly.
 Maintain equal pressure on both sides of the preformed filler while placing
 concrete. Vibrate the concrete on each side of the joint.
 After the concrete has been finished, remove the protective channel cap and
 edge the concrete on each side of the joint.
 Remove excess concrete that flowed around the ends of the joint.
 Seal the expansion joint with a low modulus silicone sealant.
 4. Transverse Construction Joint.
 Install a transverse construction joint at the end of each day’s pour and when
 the time between placement of successive batches or loads of concrete exceeds 45 minutes. Install transverse construction joints halfway between normally spaced transverse joints.
 Stake a metal deformed splicer bar assembly to the roadbed that holds the
 deformed splicer bar within 1/8 inch of the proposed alignment and elevation.
 Pave over the assembly far enough to maintain the elevation of the top of the
 slab. Make a full depth saw cut to expose the deformed splicer bar and install
 the deformed insert. Dispose of the excess concrete.
 On shoulders or urban projects, if the Engineer determines it is not feasible
 to install a deformed splicer bar basket assembly, form a transverse construction joint by installing a header shaped to conform to the cross-section of the
 slab. Use a header designed to accommodate proper placement of dowel bars
 or reinforcement extending across the joint. Construct a rigid header, secured
 to prevent bulging or displacement.
 Consolidate the concrete adjacent to the header using an internal vibrator or
 other approved methods. Remove segregated concrete. After the pavement
 has been finished, edge the surface adjacent to the header.
 5. Longitudinal Joints.
 Complete sawing of longitudinal joints no more than 7 days after concrete
 placement. Remove sawing residue by flushing the joint with water.
 267
 
 550.04 G.5
 
 If impervious membrane cure has been removed due to sawing or flushing
 operations during the curing period, reapply cure to the area within 30 minutes of the cure being removed.
 H. Finishing Concrete.
 1. General.
 a. Water.
 Do not use water to facilitate finishing.
 b. Floating.
 Use long-handled floats with blades that are at least 5 feet by 6 inches.
 c. Straightedging.
 Use a 10-foot straightedge parallel to the pavement centerline to reveal
 any irregularities. Strike off high areas and fill low areas with fresh concrete.
 Consolidate the areas corrected and refinish them with a long-handled
 float. Start the float at the edge of the pavement and slowly move it to the
 crown and back again to the edge. Only float enough to seal the surface.
 Recheck the corrected areas with the 10-foot straightedge.
 Dispose of surplus water and laitance on the pavement surface outside the
 forms.
 Overlap successive advances of the straightedge no less than 1/2 the
 length of the straightedge.
 Continue straightedge testing and corrections until the entire surface is
 free from observable depression below the straightedge.
 d. Final Surface Finish.
 (1) Carpet Drag.
 Uniformly texture the surface by dragging a seamless strip of stifffiber artificial grass carpet longitudinally along the full width of the
 pavement in a single pass.
 Use and maintain a taut string line for operating the carpet drag. Attach the leading edge of the carpet drag to a bridge. If the Engineer
 determines it is not feasible to use a bridge or string line, other texturing methods will be allowed.
 Maintain a clean carpet free of encrusted concrete.
 Provide a minimum texture depth of 0.031 inches.
 The Engineer will test the texture achieved by the carpet drag in
 accordance with ASTM E 965 and the Field Sampling and Testing
 Manual. The Engineer will determine the test location.
 Diamond grind if three or more lots have texture depths less than
 0.031 inches but greater than or equal to 0.025 inches.
 Diamond grind any one lot having a texture depth of less than 0.025
 inches.
 268
 
 550.04 H.2
 
 Diamond grind as specified in Section 550.04 M.4, “Grinding.”
 The Engineer will determine the limits of any failing test by running
 additional tests at 100-foot intervals before and after the failing test.
 The Engineer will determine the location of the additional tests.
 (2) Metal Tine Finish.
 Run a clean, metal tine longitudinally along the surface immediately
 following the carpet drag. Exclude areas within 3 inches of the edge
 of the slab and longitudinal joints. Run the tine continuously across
 transverse joints.
 Use a tine that provides:
 – 1/8 inch ±1/64 inch groove width;
 – 3/16 inch ±1/16 inch groove depth; and
 – 3/4 inch spacing of between grooves.
 If the concrete has becomes too stiff to receive the metal tine finish,
 use diamond bladed equipment to produce the longitudinal grooves.
 e. Imprinting Pavement.
 Use devices capable of imprinting the numerals between 3 and 4 inches
 in height and at least 1/4 inch deep. Create impressions after texturing the
 pavement.
 Imprint numbers and markings into the surface:
 – 20 inches from the edge of the concrete to the bottom of the number;
 – Parallel to centerline; and
 – Readable from the outside shoulder.
 Imprint survey station numbers at every station that is divisible evenly
 by 5 (ex. 5+00, 10+00, etc.) and imprint tick marks at 100-foot intervals
 between the station markings.
 Imprint the reference point (RP) number into the pavement at each RP.
 Imprint edgedrain outlet locations with a “0” (zero).
 On two-way roadways, imprint the station numbers in the direction of
 stationing.
 At the beginning and end of each day’s placement, place the station number to the nearest foot at the right edge of slab.
 Imprint the month, day, and year at the beginning and end of each day’s
 placement. Place these imprints on the opposite edge of the slab from that
 used for station imprints and so that the numbers can be read in the direction of concrete placement.
 2. Additional Requirements for Formed Concrete.
 Use machine methods to screed and consolidate the concrete.
 If a screeding machine breaks down, discontinue the mixing of concrete until
 269
 
 550.04 H.2
 
 screed machine is operational. The Engineer will allow manual screeding of
 concrete that was mixed before breakdown.
 Simultaneously operate two transverse screeding machines to finish each
 section of concrete.
 Operate the screeding machines at the same speed as the concrete placement
 operations. Avoid stopping the screeding machines.
 The Engineer will allow the use of one screeding machine if concrete is
 placed at a rate of less than 250 feet per hour. Operate the single screeding
 machine at least twice over the area.
 Ensure concrete or mortar carried ahead of the screeds is not deposited on or
 adjacent to any joint.
 Produce a surface with a uniform texture.
 I. Curing Concrete.
 1. General.
 Apply the final cure within 30 minutes of screeding the concrete. Use wetted
 fabric cure or an impervious membrane cure. Obtain the Engineer’s approval
 to change the cure method.
 If weather conditions cause rapid drying of the pavement surface, use a fogger to apply a fine mist to the concrete surface for interim curing. Begin fogging immediately behind the tining float. Maintain the fogging to produce a
 sheen on the surface until the curing is applied. Apply the fog over the entire
 placement width. Reduce fogging only if excess water accumulates on the
 surface. Do not apply water with brushes.
 Cure concrete pavement for a period of at least 72 hours. Suspend curing
 when the pavement has attained the minimum strength specified in Section
 550.04 M, “Opening to Traffic” for opening pavement to public traffic.
 During the curing period, only equipment necessary for curing and for sawing joints will be allowed on the concrete.
 If the ambient temperature falls below 40°F, maintain the concrete surface
 temperature between 40°F and 90°F for the duration of the curing period.
 If high-early strength concrete is used, maintain the surface temperature between 50°F and 90°F.
 Conduct heating operations to avoid sudden temperature changes in the concrete. Before removing any enclosures, decrease the concrete’s surface temperature to the air temperature at a rate not to exceed 15°F per hour.
 The Engineer will suspend paving operations if cure is not properly applied.
 If hair cracking develops before placing the curing cover, modify curing procedures to prevent loss of moisture. Cease concrete placing and mixing if
 hair cracking continues.
 Submit a detailed temperature maintenance plan before placing concrete, if
 the ambient temperature is expected to drop below 40°F.
 270
 
 550.04 K.2
 
 2. Wetted Fabric Cure.
 Cover the concrete pavement with wet mats of cotton, burlap, or geotextile
 fabric.
 Place fabric mats to cover the entire concrete pavement surface. Cover the
 exposed sides of the concrete pavement after removing forms.
 Keep the fabric mats wet continuously during the curing period.
 If replacing the mats with impervious membrane, leave the mats in place a
 minimum of 12 hours.
 3. Impervious Membrane Cure.
 Use a curing compound that meets the requirements of Section 810.02 B.2,
 “Type 2, Class B.”
 Apply the cure at a minimum rate of 1 gallon per 150 square feet of pavement in one or two applications. If applying two coats, apply the second
 application within 30 minutes of the first application.
 Protect joints that require sealing from infiltration of the curing compound.
 Immediately cover the exposed sides of the concrete pavement with curing
 compound if removing forms exposes curing concrete before the expiration
 of the curing period.
 Immediately reapply curing compound to damaged areas within the curing
 period.
 J. Removing Forms.
 Do not remove forms until the concrete has hardened to the extent that forms
 can be removed without damage to the concrete.
 Before applying curing compound, repair honeycombed areas using freshly
 mixed mortar. Use mortar having the same proportions of cement and sand as
 the concrete pavement.
 Adjust the placement methods if honeycombing occurs.
 K. Sealing Joints.
 1. General.
 Apply joint sealant to clean and dry joints. Use an air compressor to clean
 the joints.
 Apply joint sealant when the air temperature is 40°F or higher. Seal the joints
 no more than 10 days after placement of concrete and before opening to construction and public traffic.
 Fill the joint from the bottom up with sealant.
 2. Preformed Elastomeric Compression Joint Seal.
 Apply the lubricant-adhesion to the joint groove walls or the preformed joint
 seal or both. Install the seal between 1/8 inch and 1/4 inch below the pavement surface. Install the seal using machine tools in a manner that prevents
 curling or twisting in the joint groove. The Engineer will allow the use of
 hand tools on ramps or locations where machine tools are not practical.
 271
 
 550.04 K.2
 
 Install the seal with no splices when joints are 30 feet or less in length. Construct joints over 30 feet in length using no more than two splices.
 Extend the preformed joint seal 1 inch beyond each edge of the concrete
 pavement. Do not stretch the preformed joint seal more than 5 percent.
 L. Opening to Traffic.
 Construction and public traffic will be allowed on newly placed concrete after
 the joints have been sealed and the concrete has attained a minimum compressive strength of 3,000 psi or a minimum flexural strength of 450 psi.
 Pavement placed during development of the maturity curve may be opened to
 traffic when one of the following criteria has been met:
 – The maturity factor of the placed concrete meets or exceeds the initial maturity factor as determined by the strength-maturity curve being developed; or
 – At a particular test age, the average strength of the three beams used for development of the strength-maturity curve meets 450 psi.
 M. Tolerance in Surface and Ride Quality.
 1. General.
 The Engineer may use the straight edge method, the profiler method, or both
 to determine surface tolerances and ride quality.
 2. Straight Edge Method.
 a. General.
 The Engineer may use a 10-foot straightedge to test pavement surfaces
 that have been profiled. The Engineer will use a 10-foot straightedge to
 test surfaces that will not be profiled.
 b. Roadways with Speed Limits 45 MPH or Greater.
 Use diamond grinding equipment to correct high spots of more than 1/8
 inch and less than 1/2 inch in 10 feet. Ensure the deviation after grinding
 is less than 1/8 inch.
 If the deviation exceeds 1/2 inch high or low, submit a corrective action plan that includes either grinding or removal and replacement of the
 pavement. If the corrective action plans contains grinding, the pavement
 must be ground to within the 1/8 inch tolerance. The Engineer will determine if corrective action will be implemented based on the corrective
 action plan.
 If the corrective action plan is approved and consists of grinding, the
 Engineer will direct the Contractor to obtain cores in these areas, as specified in Section 550.04 N.1, “Contractor Coring,” and will make a determination of the pavement thickness as specified in Section 550.04 N.2,
 “Determination of Pavement Thickness.”
 c. Roadways with Speed Limits Less than 45 MPH.
 Use diamond grinding equipment to correct high spots of more than 1/4
 inch and less than 5/8 inch in 10 feet. Ensure the deviation after grinding
 is less than 1/4 inch.
 
 272
 
 550.04 M.3.b
 
 If the deviation exceeds 5/8 inch high or low, submit a corrective action plan that includes either grinding or removal and replacement of the
 pavement. If the corrective action plans contains grinding, the pavement
 must be ground to within the 1/4 inch tolerance. The Engineer will determine if corrective action will be implemented based on the corrective
 action plan.
 If the corrective action plan is approved and consists of grinding, the
 Engineer will direct the Contractor to obtain cores in these areas, as specified in Section 550.04 N.1, “Contractor Coring,” and will make a determination of the pavement thickness as specified in Section 550.04 N.2,
 “Determination of Pavement Thickness.”
 3. Profiler Method.
 a. General.
 The Engineer will determine the pavement smoothness by profiling the
 finished surface of the mainline pavement as specified in the Field Sampling and Testing Manual. The Engineer will not profile:
 (1) Bridge decks;
 (2) Side roads and approaches;
 (3) Shoulders, ramps and gore areas;
 (4) At grade railroad crossings;
 (5) The beginning and end of the project;
 (6) Where utility appurtenances are placed in the wheel paths of the
 lanes;
 (7) Finished surfaces 20 feet before and after the excluded areas shown
 in 1, 4, 5, and 6; and
 (8) Where safety and the roadway geometrics do not allow the proper
 operating speed for the profiler to collect data. The Engineer will
 determine the location of these areas.
 The Engineer will not test the roadway between November 30 and May
 15. The Engineer will not test when the ambient temperature is below
 32°F, or while it is raining or under inclement weather conditions. The
 Engineer will test when the pavement is dry and at an agreed upon time
 between the Engineer and the Contractor.
 Prepare the surface for profile collection by sweeping and other method
 needed to ensure a clean surface for accurate testing.
 b. Operation.
 Schedule a time for the profile to be collected. The Engineer will collect
 the profile within 5 working days after notification.
 The Engineer will apply liquidated damages of $1,500 for each area that
 has been ground that is identified as needing further corrective action.
 The Engineer will use lasers to collect the profile in each wheel path of
 273
 
 550.04 M.3.b
 
 each lane.
 The Engineer will trace the profile at approximately 31 and 97 inches,
 measured from the left edge of the lane, as determined by the direction of
 traffic. Provide traffic control for 500 feet beyond the ends of the project
 to facilitate the collection of profile data.
 The Engineer will test the roadway when the pavement is dry. Sweep and
 prepare the surface as necessary before the Engineer collects profile data.
 Complete corrective action within 21 calendar days of final profile data
 collection.
 (1) Roadways with Speed Limits 45 MPH or Greater.
 The Engineer will complete an initial profile to determine MRI and to
 identify localized roughness. The Engineer will complete subsequent
 profiles to verify that the areas of localized roughness have been corrected.
 The Engineer will collect a complete or partial initial profile after
 the mainline paving is complete. To perform a partial profile the Engineer will require a minimum of 50 percent continuous pavement
 from either the beginning or end of project.
 The Engineer will collect the final acceptance profile after the necessary corrective actions on the roadway are completed.
 (2) Roadways with Speed Limits Less than 45 MPH.
 The Engineer will collect the final profile when the entire mainline
 paving is completed. The Engineer will collect the acceptance profile
 in both wheel paths at the same time. The Engineer will create one
 profile for each lane.
 c. Evaluation.
 (1) General.
 The Engineer will:
 – Measure the smoothness of the roadway using the International
 Roughness Index (IRI) to the nearest 0.1 inch;
 – Use ProVal, http://www.roadprofile.com, to calculate the IRI
 from the Engineering Research Division (ERD) files;
 – Provide a copy of the ERD file upon completion of the data collection;
 – Apply a 250 mm filter to generate the IRI in ProVal;
 – Average the IRI of the two-wheel paths to calculate the Mean
 Ride Index (MRI); and
 – Use the MRI option in ProVal for evaluation.
 Download the current version of ProVal at http://www.roadprofile.
 com.
 
 274
 
 550.04 M.3.c.(2)
 
 (a) Localized Roughness.
 Identify areas of localized roughness using the Smoothness Assurance Module (SAM) within the current version of ProVal.
 Use the following settings in the SAM:
 – Ride Quality Index set to MRI.
 – The base length:
 » Short continuous - 25 feet.
 » Long continuous - 528 feet.
 » Fixed interval - 528 feet.
 – Ride Quality Threshold of 80 in/mile for 45 mph or greater.
 – Ride Quality Threshold of 140 in/mile for less than 45 mph.
 Apply a 250 mm filter to the file being analyzed.
 (b) Corrective Action Plan.
 Submit a detailed corrective action plan using the ProVal and
 SAM data, 3 working days in advance of grinding, Generate
 grinding simulations in ProVal with multiple grinding depths,
 varying equipment, and multiple pass patterns Include the grinding simulations with the corrective action plan.
 The Engineer will provide another profile ERD file. Submit a
 new corrective action plan after being provided the subsequent
 profile ERD File.
 The Engineer will determine if further corrective action will be
 completed based on the new corrective action plan.
 (2) Roadways with Speed Limits 45 MPH or Greater.
 A lot is defined as a 528-foot road segment, 1 lane wide The Engineer will include a partial lot less than or equal to 370.0 feet in
 the previous lot. The Engineer will treat a lot greater than 370.0
 feet as an independent lot.
 Lots with an MRI greater than or equal to 68.1 will require corrective
 action, as specified in Section 550.04 M.3.c(1)(b), “Corrective Action Plan.”
 For lots that do not require corrective action, the Engineer will process performance incentives and contract price adjustments for each
 lot as specified in Section 550.06 B, “Ride Quality.”
 Areas that would result in a contract price adjustment may be ground
 to a lower MRI. If grinding occurs and results in an MRI of less than
 54.0, the Engineer will not apply a performance incentive to that lot.
 Lots with an initial MRI of 54.0 or less will receive a performance
 incentive based on the initial readings, before grinding.

 N. Acceptance.
 1. Contractor Coring.
 276
 
 550.04 N.2.c
 
 The Engineer will designate locations for obtaining pavement cores a minimum of 28 days after concrete placement. After grinding is complete, obtain
 one core in each lot under the observation of the Engineer. The Engineer will
 request additional coring, based on the test results in Sections 550.04 N.2,
 “Determination of Pavement Thickness” and 550.04 N.3, “Determination of
 Concrete Strength.” Obtain the requested cores at no additional expense to
 the Department.
 The Engineer will take possession of the cores immediately after they are
 obtained.
 A lot is defined as:
 – 4,000 square yards of concrete pavement of constant thickness and placement width;
 – Fractional areas between 1,000 and 4,000 square yards; and
 – Individual ramps, cross-overs, intersections, shoulders, or other irregular
 areas of pavement not included in the main line.
 Fractional areas with less than 1,000 square yards are part of the adjacent lot.
 2. Determination of Pavement Thickness.
 a. General.
 The Engineer will determine the concrete pavement thickness as specified in AASHTO T 148.
 When determining the average pavement thickness, the Engineer will record the length of cores that exceed the designed thickness using Table
 550-02.
 Table 550-02
 Excess Core Length
 
 Length Used for Calculations
 
 0.0 to 0.5 inch
 
 Actual core length
 
 Over 0.5 inch
 
 Design thickness plus 0.5 inch
 
 b. Thickness Deficient by less than 0.2 inch.
 If the initial core is deficient in length by less than 0.2 inch from the
 specified pavement thickness, the Engineer will not request additional
 cores for determining thickness in that lot.
 c. Thickness Deficient by 0.2 inch and less than 1.0 inch.
 When the initial core is deficient in length by 0.2 inch and less than 1.0
 inch, the Engineer will request two additional cores from the lot at intervals separated from each other and from the first core by at least 1/4 the
 length of the lot.
 If neither of the two additional cores is deficient in length 1.0 inch or
 more, the Engineer will compute the average thickness of that lot of pavement as the average length of the three cores and will process a contract
 price adjustment as specified in Section 550.06 C, “Thickness Tolerance
 Contract Price Adjustments.”
 277
 
 550.04 N.2.c
 
 If either of the additional cores is deficient in length by 1.0 inch or more,
 Section 550.04 N.2.d, “Thickness Deficient by 1.0 inch or More” will apply.
 d. Thickness Deficient by 1.0 inch or More.
 When the pavement thickness is deficient by more than 1.0 inch the Department will not pay for the deficient material and the Engineer will
 determine the serviceability of the deficient area as specified in Section
 105.07 A. “Performance of Work.” If the Engineer determines that the
 deficient area is serviceable, the material may remain in place. If the Engineer determines that the deficient area is not serviceable, remove and
 replace the deficient concrete. The Department will pay for the replacement material, provided it meets the specifications.
 When the length of the initial core is deficient by more than 1.0 inch, the
 Engineer will request exploratory cores at a minimum of 10-foot intervals
 parallel to the centerline in each direction from the random core until, in
 each direction, an exploratory core is obtained which is not deficient in
 length by more than 1.0 inch. The deficient area is the placement width
 and the length between the midway points of the last two exploratory
 cores at each end of the deficient area.
 The Engineer will calculate the average thickness of the remainder of the
 lot from at least two additional cores obtained outside the area that is deficient by more than 1 inch. The Engineer will not use exploratory cores
 in computing average thickness for determining adjusted unit price.
 3. Determination of Concrete Strength.
 The Engineer will determine the strength of the in-place concrete by testing
 the initial core used to determine pavement thickness from each lot. The test
 will be conducted in accordance with AASHTO T 22.
 When the concrete strength does not meet the specified strength, the Department will not pay for the deficient material and the Engineer will determine the serviceability of the deficient area as specified in Section 105.07 A,
 “Performance of Work.” If the Engineer determines that the deficient area
 is serviceable, the material may remain in place. If the Engineer determines
 that the deficient area is not serviceable, remove and replace the deficient
 concrete. The Department will pay for the replacement material, provided it
 meets the specifications.
 If the test shows that the concrete has not met the specified strength, the
 Engineer will request exploratory cores at a minimum of 10-foot intervals
 parallel to the centerline in each direction from the random core until, in each
 direction, an exploratory core is obtained which meets the specified strength.
 The deficient area is the placement width and the length between the midway
 points of the last two exploratory cores at each end of the deficient area.
 4. Reinforcing Steel Placement for Continuously Reinforced Concrete
 Pavement.
 The Engineer will measure vertical location of the reinforcement from the
 cores taken for determining pavement thickness and strength. The Engineer
 will determine the depth of the reinforcement below the top surface of the
 core from the average depth of the exposed steel members on the vertical
 278
 
 550.06 B
 
 surface of the core. The Engineer will consider each layer separately where
 two layers of reinforcement are evident in the core. The Engineer will make
 all measurements from the top surface of the core to the center of the exposed member, or if the member has been dislodged, to the center of the
 groove remaining on the vertical surface of the core.
 The Engineer will process a contract price adjustment in accordance with
 section 550.06 D, “Reinforcing Steel Placement Contract Price Adjustments” if the reinforcing steel is more than 1.0 inch and less than 2.0 inches
 outside the specified location.
 If the vertical location of the reinforcement is 2.0 inches or more outside the
 specified location or the reinforcement is less than 2.0 inches from the top
 or bottom of the pavement slab, the Engineer will make a determination of
 serviceability as specified in Section 105.07 A. “Performance of Work.”
 The Engineer will not request additional cores for these determinations.
 550.05 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 The Engineer will measure, completed and in place, as specified in Section 109.01,
 “Measurement of Quantities.”

 570.04 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 A. Concrete Repair.
 1. General.
 Place forms as specified in Section 550.04 D.2, “Formed Paving” on all exposed edges. The Engineer will allow the use of 2-inch lumber if repairs are
 less than 15 feet in length.
 Do not use heavy equipment adjacent to concrete in place less than 48 hours.
 a. Spall Repair.
 (1) General.
 Conduct removals by chipping or partial depth milling to remove the
 deteriorated or delaminated concrete.
 If when removing the pavement the Engineer determines the extent
 of damage requires a full-depth repair, change the repair to full-depth.
 Sandblast the patch area. Remove loose particles by air blasting. Direct air blasting operations away from traffic lanes. Evenly apply a
 thin coat of grout to the cleaned surface. Place the concrete before the
 grout dries. Sandblast and regrout the patch area if drying occurs.
 Place concrete for spall repairs when the air temperature is above
 40°F.
 Texture the repair by dragging a carpet of artificial grass longitudinally over the repaired area.
 (2) Milling.
 Use milling machine that has a device for stopping at preset depths to
 prevent damage to dowel bars. Chip out spalling created by the milling process.
 Taper all sides of the repair 30 degrees to 60 degrees from horizontal.
 After the repair has cured, seal the edges of the repair with grout and
 reapply cure.
 (3) Chipping.
 Keep sawcuts beyond the patch outline to a minimum and seal sawcuts using a Type IV hot poured sealant.
 Remove concrete using a 15 pound chipping hammer with a wide flat
 bit and hand tools. Cut off and remove reinforcing bars discovered
 during the removal process.
 b. Full Depth Repairs.
 Use the lift out method to remove concrete in full depth repair areas with
 minimal disruption to the subgrade and without damage to the remaining
 concrete. Do not operate equipment, other than compaction equipment,
 in areas where concrete has been removed. Fill voids deeper than 1 inch
 with aggregate and compact the material to the level of the existing subgrade.
 
 282
 
 570.04 A.2.a
 
 Place concrete for repairs less than 100 feet long the same day that removals are initiated. Place concrete for repairs longer than 100 feet within 48 hours of initiating removals. Dampen the faces of existing concrete
 before placing new concrete.
 Place, consolidate, finish, and cure concrete according to the following
 portions of Section 550.04, “Construction Requirements:”
 – 550.04 C, “Roadbed Condition;”

 – 550.04 J, “Removing Forms;”
 – 550.04 K, “Sealing Joints;” and
 – 550.04 L, “Opening to Traffic.”
 Provide finished concrete that is flush with all adjacent pavement surfaces. Before the concrete sets, check the repair utilizing a 10-foot straightedge and correct areas that deviate by 1/8 inch or greater.
 Texture the repair by dragging a carpet of artificial grass longitudinally
 over the repaired area.
 If repairs involve multiple lanes, fill the gap between the lane under repair
 and the existing concrete with cold bituminous material. Remove this
 material before making the repair to the adjacent lane.
 (1) Repairs One Lane Wide.
 Use a bond breaker along the centerline joint.
 When the repair falls in a ramp, restore the longitudinal joints crossing the repair, but do not use tie bars.
 (2) Repairs Wider Than One Lane.
 Establish tie bar placement in the new pavement by, before the second placement, installing 30 inch #5 tie bars in the longitudinal joint
 in the original tie bar pattern. Drill holes for the bars and secure the
 bars in the holes using epoxy.
 2. Non-Reinforced Jointed PCC Pavement Repairs.
 a. Concrete Removal.
 Make a full depth saw cut along the perimeter of the repair. If using more
 than one pass, make the final full depth saw cut immediately after the
 partial depth saw cut.
 
 283
 
 570.04 A.2.a
 
 If fixed joints are not used on the repair, make transverse saw cuts parallel
 to existing transverse joints. Extend transverse saw cuts only far enough
 into concrete to remain to ensure a full depth cut of the repair area, and
 seal the cut using a Type IV hot poured sealant.
 Remove concrete within 48 hours of the transverse sawing.
 b. Work Sequence.
 Use the following work sequence after removing the concrete:
 (1) Perform subgrade repair, full depth concrete pavement repair, and
 partial depth spall repair.

 (5) Clean and seal:
 (a) Transvers joints.
 (b) Random cracks.
 (c) Logitudinal joints.
 (d) 10-foot shoulder joints.
 c. Dowel Bars.
 Drill 1-3/8 inch diameter holes using a rigid frame-mounted drill. Clean
 the hole and inject epoxy into the hole. Insert Grade 40 bars into the hole.
 Lightly coat the free end of each smooth dowel with grease, of the type
 specified in Section 550.04 G.2, “Transverse Contraction Joints.”
 d. Transverse Joint Sealing at Full-Depth Repairs.
 Seal smooth doweled transverse joints at full-depth repairs as specified in
 Section 550.04 G, “Joints.”
 Traffic is allowed on the new pavement from the end of the curing period
 to the beginning of the joint sealing.
 Seal fixed transverse joints at full-depth repairs as specified in Section
 550.04 G, “Joints.” Use the sealant specified in Section 826.02 A.1,
 “Type I.” Shape the reservoir to 3/8 inch wide by 1 inch deep.
 e. Longitudinal Joint Sealing.
 Shape the longitudinal joint reservoir 1/4 inches wide by 3/4 inches deep
 in areas of full depth repairs. Seal joints as specified in Section 550.04 G,
 “Joints,” using a Type IV hot poured joint sealant.
 f. Opening to Traffic.

 602.04 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
 A. Falsework.
 1. Design and Construction.
 Design, construct, and maintain structurally adequate falsework. Do not adjust falsework after the concrete reaches its initial set.
 2. Removal of Falsework.
 Leave supporting wedges and falsework in place for 14 days or until the
 concrete has reached 70 percent of its designed strength.
 Remove all falsework. Uniformly lower the falsework to avoid excessive
 stresses in any part of the structure.
 Backfill and compact all open excavations resulting from the construction
 and removal of falsework as specified in Section 210, “Structural and Channel Excavation, Foundation Fill and Preparation” with approved material at
 no additional cost to the Department.
 B. Forms.
 1. Design and Construction.
 Design, construct, and maintain forms. Use forms that are clean and in good
 condition. Construct the forms to be mortar tight and to have a smooth surface.
 Use forms that are impervious to water when using tubes for column forms
 or to produce voids.
 Use deck forms that have adjustable positive risers.
 Perform initial adjustments to the deck form risers after all beams are in
 place. Perform final adjustments to the deck form risers after placing reinforcement.
 Form a 3/4 inch chamfer at all permanently exposed corners of the structure.
 Before placing concrete, treat forms with a form release agent that will not
 adhere to or discolor the concrete. Do not allow the release agent to come in
 contact with the reinforcing steel.
 Use steel or fiberglass form ties. Only use steel ties that are entirely removable, or removable to a depth of at least one inch below the finished concrete
 surface. Fill marks caused by steel form ties with grout meeting the requirements of Section 806.01, “Rapid-Hardening Cementitious Materials.” Grind
 all fiberglass breakoffs flush with the concrete surface. Do not use wire ties.
 If the bottom of the forms are inaccessible, provide temporary openings for
 cleaning out all extraneous material before placing concrete.
 a. Wood Forms.
 For exposed surfaces construct forms using dressed lumber of uniform
 thickness lined with smooth sheathing. Plywood shall be of maximum
 sizes that can be cut from standard size sheets. The Engineer will allow
 use of undressed lumber forms for unexposed surfaces.

 C. Placing Concrete.
 1. Placement.
 a. General.
 Notify the Engineer a minimum of 24 hour before placing concrete. Do
 not give the notice until all preparations are complete.
 Remove deleterious material inside the form area, before placing concrete. Do not place concrete on or against frozen ground. Remove struts,
 stays, and braces used to temporarily hold forms in correct shape and
 alignment when fresh concrete reaches the elevation that makes them unnecessary.
 Place and consolidate concrete without causing segregation of the aggregates. Place concrete in continuous horizontal layers. Place subsequent
 layers of concrete before the preceding layer attains initial set. Place concrete as close to the final position as possible.
 If the placement location or the dimensions of the forms prevent the use
 of chutes or tremies and concrete must be placed with a free fall greater
 than 5 feet, use placement methods that prevent segregation of the concrete.
 If necessary, extend open chutes down inside the forms or through holes
 left in the forms. Arrange chutes to avoid steep slopes. When steep slopes
 are necessary, terminate the chutes into a hopper with a vertical down301
 
 602.04 C.1.a
 
 spout or equip the chutes with baffle boards made in short lengths that
 alter the direction of movement of the concrete.
 Keep tremies full of concrete during placement. Keep the lower end of
 the tremie buried in the concrete throughout the pour.
 When placing concrete in caisson foundations, bury the lower end of the
 tremie at least 5 feet in the concrete throughout the pour.
 The Engineer will allow concrete to be pumped from the mixer or the
 truck to the point of deposit in the forms. To prevent air entrainment loss,
 segregation of the concrete, and damage to the epoxy-coated reinforcing
 steel, use one of the following at the discharge end:
 – An S-shaped configuration; or
 – A 90 degree elbow with a minimum of 10 feet of flexible conduit
 placed horizontally.
 b. Foundations and Substructures.
 (1) Column or Wall Placement.
 Place concrete in one continuous operation.
 Allow the concrete to reach 70 percent of design strength before placing pier cap reinforcing and concrete.
 (2) Foundation Seal Concrete.
 The Engineer may allow placement of foundation seal concrete.
 Submit shop drawings that contain buoyancy calculations. The Engineer will determine if the designed pilings can support the additional
 weight.
 If the placement of foundation seal concrete is allowed, place the
 concrete as follows:
 – In a manner so the water remains still during placement and curing;
 – With cement content 10 percent greater than normally required
 for the class of concrete specified;
 – With method that prevents segregation;
 – Continuously from start to finish;
 – Keeping the surface of the concrete horizontal; and
 – Without manipulating the concrete during placement.
 Remove all concrete that interferes with reinforcing steel placement
 for the permanent structure.
 c. Deck Placement.
 Do not place deck concrete until the all previously placed concrete is at
 least 14 days old or has reached 70 percent of design strength.
 Build the deck to the designated thickness. Make the required adjustments in deck elevation and riser dimensions to accommodate the variations in the camber of beams and girders.
 302
 
 602.04 D
 
 Before concrete placement, move the finishing machine across the rails
 to check and adjust the screed to ensure proper cross slope, concrete deck
 thickness and cover over the reinforcing steel.
 Do not start placing concrete if inclement weather is anticipated between
 the scheduled start time to the point where all of the concrete has achieved
 an initial set.
 Carry a uniform quantity of concrete in front of the strike-off for its entire
 length.
 Place deck concrete between designed construction joints in one continuous operation and at a minimum rate of 25 cubic yards per hour. Place
 concrete curbs and rails in one continuous operation.
 If an emergency occurs in which the concrete placement operations are
 stopped with the approval of the Engineer, install a keyed transverse
 construction joint at a location determined by the Engineer. Remove all
 concrete beyond the joint. If corrective measures are not feasible and
 the deck is not within the specified tolerances, remove the unacceptable
 work. Allow the concrete to cure for a minimum of 72 hours before continuing concrete placement.
 2. Vibration.
 Consolidate the concrete using an internal or external vibrator. Ensure the
 vibration does not displace reinforcing steel or forms. Vibrate for a sufficient
 duration and intensity to thoroughly consolidate the concrete without causing segregation.
 Use vibrators capable of visibly affecting the concrete mixture a distance of
 at least 18 inches from the vibrator.
 Do not apply vibration directly to reinforcement that extends into non-plastic
 sections or layers of concrete. Do not use vibrators for moving concrete in
 the forms.
 3. Removal of Excess Mortar.
 Keep reinforcing steel and surfaces of forms free from accumulations of
 mortar from previously placed concrete. Clean reinforcing steel without
 damaging or breaking the concrete-steel bond at and near the surface of the
 previously placed concrete. Keep surfaces of unset concrete clean.
 4. Weather Limitations.
 Obtain the Engineer’s approval to place concrete if the air temperature is
 expected to fall below 40°F during the curing period specified in Section
 602.04 F, “Curing Concrete.” Submit a written request that includes provisions for maintaining the curing temperatures. The Engineer’s acceptance
 of the written request does not relieve the Contractor of the Contractor’s
 obligation to remove and replace concrete that is damaged due the concrete
 temperature during the curing period.
 D. Deck Finishing.
 Following the screeding operations, obtain the final surfacing with a scraping
 straightedge, 10 feet long with a suitable handle. Ensure the final surface has the
 303
 
 602.04 D
 
 required crown and does not vary more than 1/8 inch from a 10 foot straightedge
 laid longitudinally thereon.
 Pull a burlap or artificial grass drag over the surface in a longitudinal direction
 while the concrete is plastic.
 Immediately following the artificial grass drag, run a clean metal tine transversely across the deck. Stop the tine 18 inches from the face of the curb and 6
 inches from the beginning and end of the deck. The tine may be hand-operated.
 Use a tine that provides:
 – 1/8 inch ±1/64 inch groove width;
 – 3/16 inch ±1/16 inch groove depth; and
 – 3/4 inch spacing of between grooves.
 E. Surface Tolerances.
 After the concrete has hardened the Engineer will test the bridge deck and approach slabs for surface irregularities with a 10 foot straightedge.
 Grind areas with a deviation greater than 1/8 inch, but less than or equal to 1/2
 inch, until the deviation is 1/8 inch or less. The Engineer will apply a contract
 price reduction as specified in Section 602.06 B, “Surface Tolerance.”
 The Engineer will make a serviceability determination as specified in Section
 105.07, “Conformity with Plans and Specifications” for any deviations greater
 than 1/2 inch.
 Restore the tined surface texture removed due to the grinding using diamond
 bladed equipment to cut transverse grooves.
 F. Curing Concrete.
 1. General.
 Maintain the concrete surface temperature between 40°F and 90°F for the
 duration of the curing period.
 Use a curing period of at least seven days. Use a curing period of at least ten
 days if using pozzolans to replace greater than 10 percent of the cement used
 in the mix.
 If the forms are removed before the end of the curing period, cover the concrete with a double thickness of burlap. Keep the burlap continuously moist
 until the end of the curing period.
 If the concrete is exposed to air temperatures lower than 40°F on any day,
 extend the curing period by the number of days the concrete is exposed to
 these low temperatures.
 If enclosures are used, heat the enclosure with an electric heater or properly
 vented combustible heater. Before removing the enclosure, decrease the concrete’s surface temperature to the air temperature at a rate not to exceed 15°F
 per hour.
 2. Deck Slab Concrete.
 Cure deck concrete by covering with a double thickness of burlap. Place the
 304
 
 602.04 I.1
 
 wet cure burlap and start the wet cure within 15 minutes of the passing of the
 finishing machine. Moisten the concrete surface using a light fog spray if the
 surface begins to dry after finishing and before placement of the wet cure.
 Keep the burlap continuously moist at all times.
 During the curing process do not allow vehicles and equipment on the deck
 and do not perform work on the deck.
 G. Barriers.
 1. General.
 Use Class AAE-3 concrete for barriers.
 Perform corrective actions of any surface that deviates by 3/8 inches or more
 when measured with a 10-foot straightedge. Make corrections by grinding,
 filling with an approved epoxy mortar, or replacing.
 Conventional forming is required for a minimum distance of 4 feet on each
 side of the expansion joints.
 2. Conventional Forming.
 Adequately tie forms to avoid any shifting during concrete placement.
 If concrete inserts in the deck slab are holding the barrier forms in place,
 remove the inserts. Clean and fill the cavities flush with the deck slab using
 an epoxy resin adhesive.
 3. Slipforming.
 After the reinforcement is installed, check the clear distance between the
 reinforcement and the slipform for the entire length of the pour.
 The Engineer will allow slab overhang distance to be increased up to 1 inch
 provided the specified gutterline is maintained.
 The Engineer will allow a radius to be used instead of a bevel on all edges of
 the barrier.
 Except at expansion joints, construct V-grooves that are 3/4 inch wide and
 3/4 inch deep in all faces of the barriers at each pier and at equal spaces between piers and abutments at approximately 10-foot spacing.
 H. Construction Joints.
 Clean the existing concrete surface and steel of all dirt, and deleterious material.
 Paint the existing concrete surface with a bonding grout that is equal parts cement and sand.
 Apply the bonding grout to a dry surface. Control placement of the grout so it
 does not dry before concrete placement.
 I. Surface Finish.
 1. Surface Finish A.
 Use surface finish A on formed concrete surfaces.
 Within 24 hours after form removal, remove all fins and irregular projections
 from surfaces that are to receive surface finish C or D or to be waterproofed.
 
 305
 
 602.04 I.1
 
 Remove form ties to a minimum depth of 1 inch.
 Repair sand pockets, honeycombed areas, cavities resulting from form ties,
 and other holes as follows:
 – Clean the repair area;
 – Saturate with water;
 – Fill with mortar that is less than one hour old and made of one part cement and two parts fine sand; and
 – Compact the mortar to fill all voids.
 2. Surface Finish B.
 Use surface finish B on all unformed upper surfaces.
 Use a wooden template to strike off unformed upper surfaces not including floors, curbs, or sidewalks. Force the coarse aggregate below the surface. Work the surface with a wooden or cork float to obtain a fine-grained,
 smooth texture. Do not use mortar topping.
 3. Surface Finish C.
 Use surface finish C on all surfaces of concrete visible to the public.
 Produce a surface that is uniform in texture and appearance and free of imperfections. Perform a rubbing immediately after surface finish A or B is
 completed and a second rubbing after the curing period is over.
 After completion of surface finish A or B:
 – Saturate the surface with water;
 – Using a small quantity of mortar, rub surfaces with a medium coarse silicon carbide stone or mechanical finisher. Mix the mortar using cement
 and fine sand and water mixed in the proportions used in the concrete
 being finished;
 – Rub until form marks and imperfections are removed and the surface is
 smooth;
 – Do not expose the coarse aggregate;
 – Rub patches after they set without delaying the rubbing of the remainder
 of the surface; and
 – Spread or brush the paste produced by rubbing uniformly over the surface
 and allow it to set.
 Perform the final rubbing after the curing period has expired and after all
 concrete above the surface being finished has been cast. Produce the final
 surface finish by rubbing the concrete with water and a fine silicon carbide
 stone. Continue rubbing until the surface has a smooth texture and is uniform
 in color and appearance.
 4. Surface Finish D.
 After achieving surface finish A or B and after the curing period has ended,
 roughen the surface by sandblasting.
 306
 
 602.04 M
 
 Use a commercially packaged cement-based masonry coating material.
 Place one or more coatings using the rates and application methods specified
 by the manufacturer.
 Finish the surface with a uniform texture, color, and appearance free from
 fins, projections, cavities, and porous spots.
 J. Penetrating Water Repellent Treatment of Concrete Surfaces.
 Before treating surfaces, use sandblasting or water washing equipment to clean
 the surfaces of material that might inhibit the coverage and penetration of the
 solution.
 Prepare the surface by applying pre-treatment cleaning agents before the use
 of water washing cleansing methods. Add detergent to the cleansing water, if
 necessary. After washing, rinse with clear water.
 Use solvents and hand tools to remove bonded foreign materials.
 Use a cleaning process that does not remove or alter the existing surface finish
 and does not expose the coarse aggregate.
 Before treatment, allow the surface to dry to meet the requirements of the repellent manufacturer.
 Apply penetrating water repellent treatment solution when the air or concrete
 surface temperature is 40°F and rising. Use airless application equipment with
 15 to 40 psi application pressure. Apply treatment solution at the rate recommended by the solution manufacturer.
 K. Waterproof Membrane.
 1. General.
 Apply membrane and primer in dry weather and when the air temperature is
 above 40°F. Apply to surfaces that are dry, clean, free of sharp protrusions
 and above 40°F.
 2. Primer.
 Use a primer that is recommended by the manufacturer of the membrane.
 Apply the primer at the manufacturer’s recommended rate or at 300 to 800
 square feet per gallon. Allow the primer to dry for a minimum of 1 hour.
 3. Membrane Installation.
 Roll membrane on to surfaces within 36 hours of the surface being primed.
 Keep the membrane free of wrinkles and bubbles.
 Lap joints a minimum of 2.5 inches. Seal the joints and exposed edges with
 a joint sealing mastic recommended by the manufacturer of the membrane.
 L. Anchor Bolts.
 Place anchor bolts directly into plastic concrete or secure them in preformed or
 drilled holes using and epoxy resin adhesive.
 M. Bearings.
 Set bearings within 0.01 feet of the specified elevation. If necessary, finish bearing areas to a true plane and elevation by grinding. Clean and lubricate the sliding surfaces of expansion bearings.
 307
 
 602.04 N
 
 N. Opening to Traffic.
 Do not operate construction equipment on the structure until the concrete has
 reached 70 percent of its designed strength, based on concrete cylinder breaks.
 After the concrete has achieved 70 percent design strength and before it reaches
 full design strength, limit the weight of each piece of construction equipment to
 14,000 pounds gross vehicle weight.
 Do not allow public traffic on the structure until the concrete has reached its full
 design strength.

 a minimum of six test cylinders:
 – 3 cylinders per bed, to be tested at the time of stress transfer, that include:
 » 1 cylinder representing the first beam cast;
 » 1 cylinder representing a beam near the center of the bed; and
 
 310
 
 604.04 C
 
 » 1 cylinder from the last beam cast.
 – 3 cylinders for determining compressive strength to make delivery and
 obtaining acceptance by the Engineer on or before the standard 28-day
 test period.
 2. Wire, Strand, and Bars.
 Submit a certified mill test report and a certificate of compliance for reinforcing installed in beams. Include the diameters, elongation at rupture, and
 ultimate tensile strengths in the mill report.
 F. Acceptance.
 Deliver the beams after the design compressive strength requirements are obtained.
 The Engineer will reject beams not meeting the design compressive strength
 requirements at 28 days.
 Furnish a certified statement showing the number of beams cast in each continuous operation and the number of each beam.
 – If the fabrication plant meets the requirements of the Department’s Quality Assurance procedure, the manufacturer’s representative shall sign the statement.
 – If the plant does not meet the requirements of the Department’s Quality Assurance procedure, the Department’s representative at the plant shall sign the
 statement.
 604.04 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 A. General.
 Determine the prestress force applied to the strands by strand elongation and
 check the force applied using hydraulic jacks. Furnish a statement of curve
 showing the load elongation relationship at 75 percent (low elongation strand)
 of ultimate stress for the prestress steel that will be used and a certified calibration curve for each hydraulic jack that is used. Submit these items with the certificate of compliance specified in Section 604.03 E.2, “Wire, Strand, and Bars.”
 B. Work Drawings.
 Provide work drawings that include:
 – Beam dimensions;
 – Size and location of all reinforcing and prestressing steel;
 – Details of end anchorages, if used; and
 – Any necessary revisions to bridge seats.
 Submit calculations and work drawings that are signed, sealed, and dated by
 a Professional Engineer registered in the State of North Dakota as set forth in
 NDCC Title 43.
 C. Placing and Fastening Steel.
 Place steel as specified in Section 612.04, “Construction Requirements” and as
 follows:
 
 311
 
 604.04 C
 
 Maintain distances between the forms and steel reinforcing using
 stays, ties, hangers, or other approved supports. Ensure metal bar
 chairs and bolsters in contact with the forms are galvanized or noncorrosive metal. Do not leave wooden blocks in the concrete.
 Straighten prestressing elements by applying low initial tension to insure proper positioning. Include this initial tension in the total tension
 applied. If required, provide suitable horizontal and vertical spacers
 to hold elements in true position.
 D. Placing Concrete.
 Vibrate concrete for the beams.Vibrate without displacement of reinforcing,
 conduits, voids, or wire. Vibrate for a sufficient duration and intensity to thoroughly consolidate the concrete without causing segregation.
 E. Curing Concrete.
 Steam or water cure members until the concrete has reached the compressive
 strength required for stress transfer. Protect members from rain, cold weather,
 and moisture loss between placement of the concrete and the beginning of the
 steam or water cure.
 Cover all exposed surfaces with two layers of burlap as soon the covering is able
 to be placed without damaging the concrete.
 Maintain a uniform curing temperature.
 1. Steam Cure.
 Cover steam cured members with a suitable covering to contain the live
 steam. Distribute the steam uniformly throughout the enclosure and do not
 jet the steam directly on the beam. Maintain the temperature of the enclosure
 below 90°F until the beam has cured for a minimum of three hours. After this
 period the Engineer will allow the temperature within the beam enclosure to
 be raised to a maximum of 160°F in increments less than 40°F per hour.
 2. Water Cure.
 Apply water to the burlap cover so that the concrete surfaces are kept continuously wet.
 F. Pretensioned Beams.
 Accurately hold prestressing tendons in position and stress the tendons with
 jacks. Submit a record of the jacking force and the elongation produced.
 Do not allow bond stress to be transferred to the concrete and do not release end
 anchorages until the concrete has reached the compressive strength required for
 stress transfer.
 Cut tendons only after heating them to relieve the stress. Cut tendons so the
 lateral eccentricity of prestress force is minimized.
 G. Transportation and Storage.
 Transport precast beams in an upright position, and ensure the points of support
 and directions of the reactions with respect to the beam are approximately the
 same during transportation and storage as when the beam is in its final position.
 
 312
 
 604.06
 
 H. Beam Placement.
 Do not place beams on structure until previously placed concrete is at least 14
 days old or has reached 70 percent design strength.

 616.04 G.2.b
 
 Assemble parts using the match marks. Bring splice points in beam or girder
 spans to proper elevation and support them in position before the fasteners are
 tightened.
 1. Bolts.
 Make permanent field connections using 7/8 inch diameter AASHTO M 164
 high-strength bolts.
 Make the diameter of the bolt holes 1/16 inch greater than the diameter of the
 bolts used. Use bolts for transmitting shear that are threaded to a length that
 a maximum of one thread is within the grip of the metal. Use bolts that are
 long enough to extend entirely through the nuts but not more than 1/4 inch
 beyond the face of the nut. Place one lock washer under the nut of each bolt
 connecting handrails. Install a hardened washer over slotted holes.
 When using galvanized nuts, use nuts with a visible lubricant on the threads.
 When using black bolts and nuts, use bolts and nuts that are oily to the touch
 when delivered and installed.
 If bolts and nuts lose lubrication, clean and lubricate the bolts and nuts before
 installation. Test recleaned or relubricated bolt, nut and washer assemblies as
 specified in Section 616.04 G.2.a, “Bolt-Nut-Washer Assembly Testing.”
 2. Bolt Connections.
 Tighten high strength steel bolts using the following requirements:
 a. Bolt-Nut-Washer Assembly Testing.
 Perform the rotational-capacity test specified in Section 834.03 A.2, “Rotational Capacity Testing of Assemblies” on each rotational-capacity lot
 before starting bolt installation. A Skidmore-Wilhelm Calibrator tension
 measuring device will be provided by the Engineer at each project site
 during erection. Use hardened steel washers for tests.
 If using the calibrated wrench method, perform the test each day that
 bolts are installed. If using other methods, perform the tests on each production lot. The Engineer will verify the installation test procedures.
 Use direct tension indicators when testing bolts that are too short for the
 Skidmore-Wilhelm Calibrator. Calibrate the direct tension indicators in
 the Skidmore-Wilhelm Calibrator using longer bolts.
 b. Installation Preparation and Tension Requirements.
 Ensure bolted parts fit firmly together when assembled. Descale contact
 surfaces, including washers that carry more than normal tight mill scale.
 Contact surfaces shall be free of defects that would prevent solid seating
 of the parts. Install bolts with nuts on the interior side of the web and on
 the top side of the flange.
 Install bolts with a hardened washer under the bolt head or nut, whichever is turned in tightening. Use a flat washer when the abutment surface
 adjacent to the bolt head or nut does not have a slope of more than 1:20
 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis. Where an outer face of the
 bolted parts has a slope of more than 1:20 with respect to a plane normal
 to the bolt axis, use a smooth beveled washer to compensate for the lack
 323
 
 616.04 G.2.b
 
 of parallelism. Tighten all fasteners to the minimum bolt tension values
 shown in Table 616-01 “Required Fastener Tension” on completion of the
 joint.

 c. Installation Methods.
 Do not use high strength bolts that were previously tightened to requirements of Table 616-01. Replace the assembly with a new bolt and nut.
 Replace the assembly at no additional cost to the Department.
 (1) Turn-of-Nut Tightening.
 Snug tighten all bolts in the joint with a few impacts of an impact
 wrench or the full effort of a worker using an ordinary spud wrench.
 Ensure the parts of the joint are in full contact with each other. Match
 mark the nuts and protruding bolt ends before final tensioning so that
 the actual rotation can be determined.
 Perform final tensioning by the applicable nut rotation specified in
 Table 616-02 with tightening progressing systematically from the
 rigid part of the joint to its free edges. During this operation, do not
 allow rotation of the part not turned by the wrench.
 For bolts installed by 1/2 turn or less, rotate within a tolerance of plus
 or minus 30 degrees. For bolts installed by 2/3 turn or more, rotate
 within a tolerance of plus or minus 45 degrees.
 Table 616-02 “Nut Rotation from Snug Tight Condition Disposition
 of Outer Faces of Bolted Parts” applies only to connections in which
 all material within the grip of the bolt is steel.

 Calibration: Calibrate wrenches using the Skidmore-Wilhelm Calibrator. Calibrate by tightening three typical bolts of each diameter,
 length and grade from the bolts being installed. Use a hardened washer
 from the washers being used in the work under the element turned in
 tightening.
 Recalibration: Recalibrate wrenches when there is significant difference in the surface condition of the bolts, threads, nuts, or washers.
 Verification: Verify that the wrench adjustment selected by the cali325
 
 616.04 G.2.c.(2)
 
 bration does not produce a nut or bolt head rotation from snug tight
 greater than that permitted in Table 616-02 during actual installation in the assembled steelwork. If manual torque wrenches are used,
 measure torque when turning nuts in the tightening direction.
 Installation: Install and tighten bolts in all holes of the connection
 to a snug tight condition. Use hardened washers under the element
 turned. Following the initial tightening operation, further tighten the
 connection using the calibrated wrench. Tighten systematically from
 the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges.
 Recheck: Recheck previously tightened bolts to ensure they have
 not relaxed as a result of the subsequent tightening of adjacent bolts.
 Keep rechecking bolts until all bolts are tightened to the specified
 minimum required tension.
 (3) Direct Tension Indicator (DTI) Tightening.
 Use DTI’s that indicate the minimum tensions specified in Table 61601. Follow the manufacturer’s installation procedure for installation
 of bolts in the calibration device and in all connections. Properly install flat hardened washers when using DTI with bolts installed in
 oversize or slotted holes and when using the DTI under the turned
 element.
 (a) Calibration Testing of DTI.
 Assemble a minimum of 3 DTI test assemblies for each length,
 diameter, and grade of fastener. Perform the rotational-capacity
 test specified in Section 834.03 A.2, “Rotational Capacity Testing of Assemblies” on each rotational-capacity lot before starting bolt installation. The test assemblies shall be identical to the
 assemblies required in the connection. Test the assemblies in a
 calibration device capable of indicating bolt tension.
 (b) Installation.
 Install bolts in all holes of the connection and tighten to achieve
 partial compression of the DTI protrusions. Tighten all fasteners,
 progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the connection to the free edges in a manner that will minimize relaxation of previously tightened fasteners. Proper tensioning of the
 bolts may require more than a single cycle of systematic partial
 tightening before final tightening to deform the DTI protrusions
 to the specified gap.
 (4) Alternate Design Fasteners (ADF).
 Use alternate design fasteners (ADF) that meet the specifications in
 Section 834.03, “Bolts, Nuts, and Washers.” Follow the manufacturer’s installation procedure for installation of bolts in the calibration
 device and in all connections.
 (a) Verification Testing of ADF.
 Assemble a minimum of 3 ADF test assemblies for each length,
 diameter, and grade of fastener to be used in the work. If required
 in the actual connection, include flat-hardened washers in the test
 326
 
 616.04 H
 
 assembly arranged as in the actual connections to be tensioned.
 Test the samples at the job site in a device capable of indicating
 bolt tension. Only use ADF represented by samples that develop
 a tension required by Table 616-01.
 (b) Installation.
 When ADF are used, install bolts in all holes of the connection
 and initially tighten them sufficiently to bring all plies of the joint
 into firm contact but without yielding or fracturing the control
 or indicator element of the ADF. Then, further tighten all ADFs,
 progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the connection to the free edges in a manner that will minimize relaxation of previously tightened ADFs. Ensure proper tensioning of
 the bolts by systematically partially tensioning them until final
 twist-off of the control or indicator element of individual ADFs
 during the final tightening cycle. Use more than a single cycle of
 systematic partial tightening. If twist-off occurs on an individual
 ADF prior to the final tightening cycle, replace the fastener with
 a new one.
 3. Welded Stud Sheer Connectors.
 Install welded stud sheer connectors in the field after the structural steel has
 been erected and the deck forms are in place, but before the installing reinforcing steel. Use automatically timed stud welding equipment to weld sheer
 connectors.
 Perform production testing as specified in Clause 7.7, “Production Control,” of
 the AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code. In addition to the stud bend
 test specified in Clause 7.7, perform stud bend tests at the following times:
 – At the start of each work day;
 – When welding has been interrupted for one hour or more;
 – When changing grounds;
 – When changing weld settings; and
 – When changing cable loop due to arc blow.
 Do not weld more than 500 studs without performing a bend test.
 Bent studs that show no signs of failure may be left in the bent position.
 H. Straightening Steel Members.
 If members are bent, they must be replaced or returned to fabricator for repair.
 Do not straighten bends in main structural members in the field.
 Straighten bent members without producing embrittlement, fracture, or damage.
 Straighten all material cold. Do not use members that cannot be straightened.
 The Engineer may authorize heating mild steel and structural grade steel. Do
 not allow the temperature of the heated area to exceed 1,200°F (a dull red) as
 controlled by temperature indicating crayons, liquids, or bimetal thermometers.
 
 327
 
 616.04 I
 
 I. Rust Stains.
 When Weathering Steel is used, protect substructure units with reinforced polyethylene or similar material. Leave the protection material in place to prevent
 staining until the superstructure is completed.
 Use a concrete rust stain remover to remove all rust stains on the substructure
 units. Flush all areas receiving applications of rust stain remover with water.
 616.05 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 The Engineer will measure as specified in Section 109.01, “Measurement of Quantities” and as follows:
 A. Measurement by Weight.
 Measurement by weight will be by the Pound. The quantity paid for will be
 the total weight, determined as specified. If the structural steel is measured by
 weight, furnish two copies of calculated weights and dimensions.
 The Engineer will measure and pay for all castings and miscellaneous metal
 parts as Structural Steel. The Engineer will use Table 616-04 to determine the
 weight of structural steel components.

 The Engineer will not measure or pay for the weight of permanent bolts
 6 inches or less in length. The Engineer will not make deductions for cuts,
 copes, bevels, or open holes; and will not make allowance for mill overruns.
 2. Structural Plates.
 The plan quantity structural plates will be used for measurement and payment.
 The Department will not make allowance for planed or sheared edges.
 The Engineer will compute the weight of irregular shape on the basis of the
 dimensions of the smallest rectangular plate from which it can be cut. When
 
 328
 
 616.05 B
 
 plates are machine finished, the Engineer will consider the dimension of the
 plates the maximum machine finished dimension plus 1/8 inch for each finished surface.
 3. Structural Shapes and Bars.
 The plan quantity will be used for measurement and payment of structural
 shapes and bars.
 The Engineer will compute the weight of each structural shape with mitered
 ends on the basis of the section and overall length measured parallel to the
 axis of the shape.
 For identical structural shapes with mitered ends that are less than 5 feet
 long, the Engineer will consider ends multiple cut. The Engineer will compute their total weight as the weight of the shortest parent section from which
 they can be cut, provided the length of the parent section is not more than 30
 feet.
 4. Pins and Rollers.
 The Engineer will consider the parent section for forged segmental rollers
 square in section, and of the same length, width, and thickness as the finished
 roller.
 The Engineer will compute the weight of hot-rolled bar steel pins and rollers
 on the basis of the length shown on the Plans and on the basis of a diameter
 1/4 inch greater than that of the finished pin or roller.
 The plan quantity will be used for measurement and payment of cold finished bar steel pins and rollers.
 5. Bolts and Tie Rods.
 The Engineer will compute the weight of bolts over 6 inches long and tie
 rods, including necessary nuts and washers used for connecting structural
 steel parts from the nominal weights, as given by the American Institute of
 Steel Construction.
 6. Castings.
 The Engineer will compute the weight of each casting from the net dimensions shown on the approved shop drawings, with an addition of 10 percent
 to compensate for fillets and overruns. Where machine-finished surfaces are
 required, the Engineer will make an allowance of 1/8 inch in thickness for
 each surface so finished. If cored holes are shown on the Plans, the Engineer
 will make a deduction for the full size of the core.
 7. Pipe.
 The plan quantity of pipe will be used for measurement and payment.
 B. Lump Sum Basis.
 When the quantity of structural steel is included in the Plans as a “Lump Sum,”
 the “Lump Sum” includes all required structural steel.
 If changes are made to the contract that increase or decrease the weight of the
 material required, the Engineer will determine the weight of additional material
 using Table 616-04.

 622.04 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 A. Pile Formulas.
 Pile formulas will be included in the Plans. The Engineer will apply the formulas when computing the bearing value by pile penetration for all piles. The Engineer will not make penetration measurements to determine pile bearing values
 immediately after inserting fresh cushioning material over the head of the pile
 or when pile heads are damaged by burring, corrugating, or crushing.
 If water jets are used with the driving, the Engineer will determine the bearing value by the formulas from the results of driving after the jets have been withdrawn.
 The Engineer will make a reduction in the rated energy of an open top diesel
 hammer if the hammer does not maintain the minimum measured stroke. This
 reduction will be based on the percentage of the reduced stroke.
 B. Pile Driving.
 1. General.
 Give at least 24 hours advance notice of any pile driving operations. Drive
 piling in the presence of the Engineer.
 Drive pile without using followers.
 Do not drive pile within 80 feet of concrete which has cured less than 3 days.
 For all types of hammers use pile driver leads that allow free movement of
 the hammer and rigidly hold the pile in correct alignment during the driving
 operation.
 331
 
 622.04 B.1
 
 If a pile is damaged, the Engineer will determine if the pile must be replaced
 or can be repaired.
 Remove any section of piling that is drilled or burned and do not incorporate
 it into the structure.
 After pile driving is completed, backfill and compact excess excavation and
 voids to the bottom of the footing elevation with Class 3 or Class 5 material
 that meets the requirements of Section 816, “Aggregates.”
 Before driving foundation piles, complete the excavation to the bottom of
 the footing elevation.
 Drive foundation piling as follows:
 – Limit deviation from the vertical or from the specified batter to less than
 1/2 inch per foot of pile length; and
 – Keep the center of the pile at the cutoff within 6 inches of the specified
 location.
 2. Steel and Corrugated Steel Sheet Piles.
 Drive the sheet piles with a hammer of sufficient weight and driving capacity to overcome the inertia of the pile and the resistance of the soil, without
 damaging the pile ends. Use a driving cap made for the type of sheeting being driven.
 Repair damaged galvanized sheet piling surfaces by applying a paste of approved zinc powder and flux, using a minimum quantity of water. Heat the
 surface to be coated sufficiently with a torch so all metallic material in the
 paste is melted when applied.
 3. Special Requirements for Steel Encased Concrete Piles.
 Drive steel encased concrete piles using a steel combination driving head
 and pilot of the proper size that distributes hammer blows on the pile shells.
 Do not allow clearance between the pilot ring and the pile shell to exceed
 1/4 inches. Use a timber cushion block between the hammer and the driving
 head.
 Provide adequate lighting to facilitate inspection of the pile shell throughout
 the full length of the shell.
 Use an end enclosure plate that is:
 – Circular;
 – 3/4 inches thick or more; and
 – The Diameter of the pile shells outside diameter or less.
 Place a temporary water tight seal at the tops of the pile shells after completion of pile driving and until concrete placement.
 Completely drive all pile shells for any one bent, pier, or abutment before
 any concrete is placed in the pile shells. If this is not practical, allow concrete
 placed in a pile shell to attain a compressive strength of 2,000 psi before
 driving additional piling in the same bent, pier, or abutment.
 332
 
 622.04 F.3
 
 C. Bearing Value.
 Drive piling to minimum bearing value determined by the Engineer. The Engineer will determine the bearing value by the formula specified which is applicable to the type of hammer used.
 The Engineer will determine if it is necessary to continue to drive piles when
 bearing capacity is achieved before the estimated pile length is driven.
 D. Cutoff and Treatment of Pile Heads.
 Cut off steel piles at the specified elevation at approximately 90 degrees to the
 axis of the pile.
 E. Extensions for Steel Piling and Steel Encased Concrete Piling.
 Construct splices to provide and maintain true alignment and position of the
 component parts of the pile.
 Construct splices in steel pile shells to be watertight and to develop the full
 strength of the shell.
 Do not splice lengths of pile less than 10 feet. The Engineer will allow a shorter
 length to make the last splice below cutoff.
 If splicing steel piling sections together do not exceed the following variation in
 straightness in inches:

 650.04 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 A. General.
 Remove asphalt overlays before performing concrete removals. Leave the concrete surface of the deck intact during the asphalt removal operation.
 Do not allow loads on the portion of the deck from which concrete has been
 removed, other than the equipment needed to remove and replace concrete.
 Use a buggy or pump to place concrete on the bridge deck.
 Do not open the overlay concrete to traffic until the curing period is complete.
 B. Removals with Mechanical Equipment.
 Angle pneumatic hammers at 45 degrees or less, as measured from the slab.
 Use non-powered hand tools to remove fine particles of concrete or to reach the
 required depth.
 1. Class 1.
 Use a milling machine or grinding equipment to remove deck concrete to
 a depth of 1/2 inch below the existing surface. Remove to greater depth at
 
 342
 
 650.04 C.1
 
 locations shown in the Plans.
 2. Class 2.
 The Engineer will chain the deck after Class 1 removals are complete to
 determine the Class 2 removal areas. The lower limit of the Class 2 removal
 shall be the top of the bars in top layer of reinforcing steel. Remove concrete
 using a 30 pound pneumatic hammer or a combination of pneumatic hammers and grinding or milling.
 3. Class 2-A.
 The Engineer will determine the amount of Class 2-A removal after Class
 2 removal is complete. The Engineer will direct Class 2-A removal when
 more than one-half of the circumference of a bar has lost bond with the surrounding concrete. The Engineer may direct Class 3 removals in place of
 Class 2-A removal if damage to sound concrete between reinforcing layers is
 suspected.
 Use 15-pound pneumatic hammers and hand tools to remove concrete around
 the periphery of the reinforcing steel without cutting, stretching, or damaging reinforcing steel. Obtain a minimum clearance of 3/4 inch around the bar.
 4. Class 3.
 The Engineer will chain the deck after Class 2 removals are complete to
 determine the Class 3 removal areas. The lower limit of the Class 3 removals
 shall be the top of bottom layer of reinforcing steel. Remove concrete using
 15-pound pneumatic hammers and hand tools without cutting, stretching, or
 damaging exposed reinforcing steel.
 5. Class 4.
 The Engineer will chain the deck after Class 3 removals are complete to
 determine Class 4 removal areas. Remove concrete through the full depth
 of the deck. Leave the edges of the hole in a vertical state or tapered inward
 from top to bottom.
 C. Removals with Hydrodemolition Equipment.
 Immediately after performing each class of removal, use hand or mechanical
 means to remove loose debris from the deck to prevent debris from adhering to
 the surface.
 1. Class 1H.
 The Engineer will designate a trial area of 30 square feet representing sound
 concrete. Use the trial area to set the hydrodemolition equipment to remove
 1/2 inch of sound concrete.
 After calibrating the equipment, remove deck concrete to a depth of 1/2 inch
 below the existing surface. Clean the deck after performing Class 1H removals.
 In areas inaccessible for using hydrodemolition equipment, remove concrete
 using hand held hydrodemolition equipment or mechanical equipment.
 2. Class 2H.
 The Engineer will chain the deck after Class 1H removals are complete to
 determine the Class 2H removal areas. The lower limit of Class 2H removal
 shall be sound concrete or the top of the bars in the bottom layer of reinforc343
 
 650.04 C.2
 
 ing steel, whichever is lower. Set the machine to completely remove unsound
 concrete in the areas designated.
 3. Class 3H.
 The Engineer will chain or sound the deck after Class 2H removals are complete to determine the Class 3H removal areas. Remove concrete through the
 full depth of the deck.
 D. Final Preparations Prior to Overlay.
 At longitudinal construction joints, saw the previously placed surface course to
 straight and vertical edge before placing the adjacent concrete.
 Sandblast the deck and clean the deck surface with compressed air before placing concrete.
 Sandblast all exposed reinforcing steel to remove all deleterious material and
 concrete. Remove reinforcing bars which have lost 25 percent or more of the
 original cross section and replace with a new lap-splice bar.
 Before concrete placement, move the finishing machine across the rails to check
 and adjust the screed to ensure proper concrete deck thickness.
 E. Mixing of Materials.
 Set up concrete mixing equipment at the bridge site. Operate the concrete mixer
 a rate that allows finishing operation so proceed at a steady rate.
 Perform a yield box test before each pour to determine if the mobile mixer meets
 the manufacturer’s calibration requirements. Perform the yield test as follows:
 – Use a 1/4 cubic yard yield box;
 – Set the cement meter to zero;
 – Discharge concrete until the yield box is full, but not overflowing; and
 – Determine the cement meter count for the full yield box.
 If the meter count is within 1 percent of the previous meter count, it becomes
 the new calibrated meter count. If the meter count is not within 1 percent of the
 previous meter count, recalibrate the mixer as specified by the manufacturer.
 Do not use the material placed in the yield box in the deck.
 F. Placing.
 1. General.
 Dry the deck surface, without the use of an open flame. Evenly and thoroughly coat all vertical and horizontal surfaces with a bonding grout. Do not
 allow the bonding grout to dry before covering with new concrete.
 Consolidate the concrete and screed to final grade.
 Complete placement before September 15.
 Place overlays when the ambient air temperature is 45°F and rising and below 80°F.
 2. Full Depth Removal Areas (Class 4 or Class 3H).
 
 344
 
 650.04 I
 
 Use Class AAE-3 concrete or low slump concrete in areas where full depth
 removal was performed.
 Provide forms to facilitate placement of new concrete.
 Strike off concrete in full depth removal areas at the bottom of the Class 1 or
 1H removal.
 Place concrete in full depth removal areas so that the underside of the deck
 has neat, smooth appearance.
 3. Partial Depth Removal Areas (Class 1, 2, 2-A, and 3 or Class 1H and 2H).
 Use low slump concrete in areas where partial depth removals were performed.
 Place concrete for all partial depth removal areas in one operation.
 G. Finishing.
 After machine finishing is completed, hand finish with a wood float to produce
 a tight, uniform surface.
 Seal all vertical joints by painting the joint with a thinned grout.
 Pull a burlap or artificial grass drag over the surface in a longitudinal direction
 while the concrete is plastic. Immediately follow the drag with a metal tine finish as specified in Section 602.04 D, “Deck Finishing.”
 H. Surface Tolerances.
 After the concrete has hardened the Engineer will test the bridge deck and approach slabs for surface irregularities with a 10-foot straightedge.
 Grind areas with a deviation greater than 1/8 inch, but less than or equal to 1/2
 inch, until the deviation is 1/8 inch or less. The Engineer will apply a contract
 price reduction as specified in Section 650.06 B, “Surface Tolerance.”
 The Engineer will make a serviceability determination as specified in Section
 105.07, “Conformance with the Contract Requirements” for any deviations
 greater than 1/2 inch.
 Restore the tined surface texture removed due to the grinding using diamond
 bladed equipment to cut transverse grooves.
 I. Curing.
 Cure concrete placed in Class 4 removal areas as specified in Section 602.04
 F.2, “Deck Slab Concrete,” except the curing period is revised as follows:
 Allow concrete to cure for 72 hours before placing the subsequent
 layer of concrete. If the subsequent layer of concrete will not be
 placed within 72 and 96 hours of the placement of the previous layer,
 allow the previously placed layer to cure for 7 days.
 Cure concrete placed in Class 1, 2, 2-A, and 3 removal areas as specified in Section 602.04 F.2, “Deck Slab Concrete,” except the curing period shall be 5 days.
 If the wet cure is not applied within 30 minutes, remove and replace the affected
 concrete.
 If the daily mean temperature falls below 55°F during the 5 days, extend the curing period by the number of days the concrete is exposed to these temperatures.
 345
 
 650.05
 
 650.05 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 The Engineer will measure as specified in Section 109.01, “Measurement of Quantities” and as follows:
 A. Class 2-A Removal.
 Class 2-A removals will not be measured separately in areas where Class 3
 removals are performed.
 B. Overlay Concrete.
 The Engineer will measure overlay concrete based on the mobile mixer count
 and the yield box. The Engineer will determine the quantity of concrete placed
 by taking counter readings from the mixer before and after each placement and
 multiplying the readings by the meter count determined by the yield test.
 The Engineer will deduct waste concrete from the measure quantity. The Contractor and Engineer will agree upon the amount of waste, including the material
 used in the yield test, at the end of each day.

 – A certification that category I and II traffic control devices meet NCHRP
 350 or MASH Guidelines; and
 – The classification of the installed devices specified in Section 704.04 B,
 “Traffic Control Device Condition Classifications.”
 2. Placement.
 If the placement of work zone signs interferes with permanent signs or an
 358
 
 704.04 B
 
 obstruction makes the required location impractical, place the work zone
 signs at an approved location. Revise the sign messages if necessary.
 Place traffic control devices to meet the standards and requirements of the
 MUTCD and the Standard Highway Signs and Markings Book, published by
 the FHWA.
 Do not lean the sign face or sign supports on sign anchors. Install the sign
 supports and face or mark the anchors so that they are visible.
 Only place traffic control devices that are applicable to actual conditions of
 the project site. Remove devices once they are no longer necessary. Remove
 sign bases at the same time that sign faces are removed.
 Have all required devices available for installation when needed. Maintain,
 relocate, cover, or remove devices as necessary.
 Install and maintain devices so that they function in the manner that they
 were crash tested.
 3. Traffic Control Maintenance and Revisions.
 When the Engineer notifies the Contractor, Traffic Control Supervisor, or
 Watchperson of the need for traffic control to be furnished, installed, relocated, maintained, removed, or otherwise revised; the Contractor, Traffic
 Control Supervisor, or Watchperson must be on the project addressing the
 issue within 1 hour of the notification.
 If additional resources or time are needed, the Engineer and the traffic control personnel on site will agree on an action plan and a time for completion.
 If the the action plan is not executed or the the Contractor fails to meet the
 time for completion, the Engineer will take the action detailed in this section.
 If the Engineer issues notification of the need for traffic control to be furnished, installed, relocated, maintained, removed, or otherwise revised and
 the Contractor, Traffic Control Supervisor, or Watchperson fail to comply,
 the Engineer will perform any combination of the following:
 1. The Engineer will apply a contract price reduction of $1,000 if the Contractor, Traffic Control Supervisor, or Watchperson is not on the project
 addressing the issue within 1 hour.
 2. The Engineer will apply a contract price reduction of $1,000 per day.
 3. The Engineer will have the work completed by other means, without additional notification, and deduct the cost of the work from monies due or
 to become due the Contractor.

 709.04 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 A. General.
 Package, label, identify, handle, and store geosynthetic according to ASTM D
 4873. Wrap each geosynthetic roll with a material that will protect the roll, including the ends of the rolls, from damage due to shipment, water, sunlight, and
 contaminants. Maintain protective wrapping during periods of shipment and
 storage. Store geosynthetic onsite elevated off the ground.
 Deliver the geosynthetic to the project and submit a certificate of compliance at
 least 21 days before its incorporation into the work.
 Overlap or sew the joints. Overlap as required for the specific geosynthetic type.
 If sewing joints use Kevlar, polypropylene, or polyester thread. Use a 401 stitch
 conforming to Federal Standard No. 751a for all seams. Use SSn-2 overlapping
 “J” seams for field seams. Sew all seams with two parallel stitch lines spaced
 approximately 1/4 inch apart. Place the outside stitch 1 inch from the edge of
 the geosynthetic. Sew seams that meet the strength requirements for the specific
 geosynthetic type. Furnish a sewn seam sample that has the same geosynthetic
 material, thread, seam spacing and number, and field seam overlap distance that
 will be used in the work.
 Type D3 geosynthetics may be constructed using welded seams.
 Install geosynthetic only after receiving approval from the Engineer. Place the
 geosynthetic on a surface that is smooth and free of stones, sticks, and other
 debris or irregularities that could damage the geosynthetic. Manually pull the
 geosynthetic taut to remove wrinkles. Do not operate construction equipment
 directly on the geosynthetic. If sewn, place geosynthetic with all seams up.
 After laydown, cover geosynthetic material within 5 days. Remove and replace
 material that is not covered within 5 days.
 B. Geosynthetic Drainage Material (Type D).

 the geosynthetic from a height greater than 3 feet.
 C. Geosynthetic Geogrid (Type G).
 Unroll geogrid parallel to the centerline of the road. Do not drag the geogrid
 across the underlying material. Use geogrid widths that produce overlaps of
 parallel rolls at the centerline and at the shoulders and so that no overlaps are
 required along wheel paths.
 Overlap the geogrid a minimum of 30 inches at all splices or joints. Construct
 joints at the end of a roll so the previous roll laps over the subsequent roll in the
 direction of the cover material placement. Mechanically tie transverse joints at
 3-foot intervals, and longitudinal joints at 15-foot intervals. Place pins or staples
 at all corners and at 15-foot intervals along all edges, before placing cover material on the geogrid.
 Stagger end overlaps at least 10 feet from other end overlaps in parallel rolls. On
 curves, the geogrid may be cut to conform to the curves.
 Patch damaged areas of geogrid. Place a patch that overlaps the damaged area
 by 36 inches on all sides. Align the apertures of the patch and the underlying
 grid. Mechanically tie the patch to the underlying grid.
 Place the first lift of material over geogrid installed on subgrade to a depth of 10
 inches of loose material. Place the first lift of material over geogrid installed on
 aggregate base to a depth of 6 inches of loose material.
 Use low ground pressure equipment to spread the initial lift of material. If rutting occurs, fill the ruts with additional material before placing the subsequent
 lift. Do not blade out ruts. Do not turn construction equipment on the first layer
 of material.
 D. Geosynthetic Reinforcement (Type R).
 Unroll geosynthetic parallel to the centerline of the road. Place the geosynthetic
 taut and pin the geosynthetic using pins at least 6 inches in length. Place pins at
 all corners and at 15-foot intervals along all edges, before placing material on
 the geosynthetic.
 Overlap the geosynthetic a minimum of 30 inches at all splices or joints. Construct joints at the end of a roll so that the previous roll laps over the subsequent
 roll in the direction of the material placement.
 Patch damaged areas by overlapping the tear a minimum of 36 inches with geosynthetic and secure the perimeter of the patch area with pins or staples.
 Place a 6-inch loose initial lift of material above the geosynthetic. Use low
 ground pressure equipment to spread the initial lift of material. If rutting occurs,
 fill the ruts with additional material before placing the subsequent lift. Do not
 blade out ruts. Do not turn construction equipment on the first layer of material.
 E. Geosynthetic for Riprap (Type RR).
 Place geosynthetic with the longest dimension parallel to the direction of water flow. Place overlaps so the upstream strip overlaps the downstream strip.

 base.
 C. Mixing, Placing, and Finishing.
 Place curb and gutter concrete on a damp base. Consolidate the concrete by vibration. Check the top and face of curbs with a 10-foot straightedge and correct
 all variations greater than 1/4 inch in 10 feet before the final finish. Finish the
 exposed surfaces with a moistened wood float and a stiff bristled broom.
 Do not place concrete on or against frozen ground.
 If honeycombed areas are exposed when the forms are removed, the Engineer
 will determine if replacement is required. If replacement is not required, repair
 the honeycombed areas. When repairing the honeycombed areas, use mortar
 composed of one part cement and two parts sand, mixed with water.
 Do not use water to facilitate finishing.
 D. Curing.
 Apply the final cure within 30 minutes of placing the concrete. Cover the entire
 concrete surface with an impervious membrane cure.

 748.04 D
 
 Immediately cover the exposed sides of the concrete pavement with curing
 compound if removing forms exposes curing concrete before the expiration of
 the curing period.
 Allow concrete to cure for a period of at least 72 hours before performing work
 adjacent to the concrete.
 If weather conditions cause rapid drying of the curb and gutter surface, apply a
 fine mist or fog spray to the surface. Do not apply water with brushes.
 If the ambient temperature falls below 40°F, maintain the concrete surface temperature between 40°F and 90°F for the duration of the curing period.
 If high-early strength concrete is used, maintain the surface temperature between 50°F and 90°F.
 Conduct heating operations to avoid sudden temperature changes in the concrete. Before removing any enclosures, reduce the heat in a manner that will
 allow the concrete’s surface temperature to decrease to the air temperature at a
 rate not to exceed 15°F per hour.
 The Engineer will suspend the paving operations if the cure is not properly applied.
 Maintain the surface temperature of newly placed concrete above 40°F for 5
 days.
 Submit a detailed temperature maintenance plan before placing concrete, if the
 ambient temperature is expected to drop below 40°F.

 A. Installing Line Posts.
 Place all posts as close to the Plan specified intervals as conditions allow. At
 sharp changes in grade, install extra posts to maintain the wire or chain link the
 proper distance from the ground.
 Align and plumb all posts. Where the slope of the terrain makes it impractical to
 set the posts plumb, set the posts as directed by the Engineer.
 Drive posts for barbed wire fence, woven wire fence, and two-strand cable
 fence, or set the posts in holes. If rock is encountered and the Engineer determines
 the post cannot be relocated, drill holes a minimum depth of 12 inches into the
 rock or to the required embedment depth of the post, whichever is less. Cut the
 post to provide the required height above the ground. Grout the post into the rock.
 1. Driven posts.
 If soil conditions prevent proper driving of posts, drill a pilot hole no larger
 than the diameter of the post minus 1 inch.
 2. Set posts.
 When posts are set in holes, drill the holes large enough to allow proper
 tamping. Set wood posts with the large end down. Place and compact the
 backfill in lifts not exceeding 6 inches of compacted material. Use all the
 excavated earth and slightly crown the backfill.
 For wood posts, provide a ground at every tenth post using a nine-gauge wire
 the full length of the post. Staple the wire to the post before driving and staple
 each line wire to make contact with the ground.
 B. Corner and Brace Assemblies.
 Install corner assemblies at all horizontal angles greater than 15 degrees.
 
 398
 
 752.05
 
 Install wood corner and brace posts in the same manner as wood line posts.
 C. Installing Fence Wire.
 Use double block or lever type hand stretchers to pull tight all fence wire.
 1. Barbed Wire, Woven Wire, and Two-Strand Cable.
 Cut the wire and tie it securely to each corner or brace post.
 During installation, install no more than 3 splices, factory and field combined, in a single spool of wire.
 If a wire breaks after installation, do not splice more than two times per
 strand between brace assemblies.
 Place wires on the side of the post away from the highway, except on the
 inside of curves.
 Drive staples diagonally to the grain of the wood and to 3/4 of their length
 into the wood leaving room for the wire to move.
 2. Chain Link Fence.
 Place fabric on one side of the posts for a continuous run of fence. Attach
 fence fabric to each brace, gate, and corner post using stretcher bars threaded
 through the loops of the fabric and fastened to the posts with bands.
 Splice the fabric by weaving in a pre-bent wire of the same kind as that in the
 fabric.
 D. Resetting Fences.
 Replace materials damaged by negligence or lost from storage.
 Stockpile excess fence material at designated locations within the project limits.
 Use new staples or other fasteners for resetting the fence. The Engineer will
 determine if any new posts, braces, or wire are required.
 E. Temporary Safety Fence.
 Install a temporary safety fence 4 feet high and colored bright orange. Use a
 polyethylene web that weighs a minimum of 32 pounds per 4-foot by 100-foot
 roll. Support the fence, at a minimum, with 7 foot, 1.12 pound/foot channel steel
 posts at a spacing of 10 feet. Support fencing placed across asphalt or concrete
 using barricades, delineator drums, or by other means approved by the Engineer.
 Securely attach the fence to the supports.
 752.05 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 The Engineer will measure fence as specified in Section 109.01, “Measurement of

 Apply messages, symbols, film, and borders by directly applying sheeting
 or by screening. Apply directly applied sheeting according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Place sheeting with no splices when sign backing is smaller than manufactured material. Use sheeting from the same manufacturer’s lot on each individual sign.
 Process and finish the sign face with material according to the sheeting manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Finish the signs to have a smooth, uniform surface with clear cut and sharp
 messages, symbols, and borders.
 4. Fabrication of Panel Signs.
 Apply sheeting to the background of panels according to the sheeting manufacturer’s recommendations.
 If splicing the sheeting, overlap the splice a minimum of 3/16 inch. Splice at
 a 90 degree angle to the length of the panel. Make the splices uniform and
 neat throughout the entire length. Do not splice any individual panel more
 than two times, and leave at least 8 feet between adjacent splices.
 Extend the sheeting over the edges and down the side legs a minimum of
 1/16 inch.
 Attach motorist service, cultural and recreational area symbols using rivets.
 Place rivets in each corner and at 12-inch intervals around the outer edge of
 the panel, spaced 1 inch from the outer edges.
 5. Date of Fabrication.
 Date all signs receiving new sign facings with the month and year fabricated. Place the date on the back of the metal backing on the lower corner of
 sign near the edge closest to traffic so that it is legible from the ground. Use
 1/4 inch high numbers on a 2-1/4 inch long by 1-3/4 inch pressure sensitive
 label. Imprint the numbers 1 through 12 on the upper part of the label, with
 the last two digits of four consecutive years printed across the bottom. Punch
 out the number of the month and the year of fabrication.
 C. Shipping and Storage.
 Before shipping or storage, ensure that all signs are free of moisture and that all
 inks are thoroughly dry. Keep all packaged signs dry. Store and ship signs off
 the ground in an upright position.
 D. Erection of Sign Supports and Delineators.

 Confirm the support lengths with the Engineer before ordering sign support posts.
 
 402
 
 754.04 D.4.b
 
 Use a driving cap when driving supports.
 Firmly set all supports and plumb after erection.
 Construct all concrete foundations with the top sloped enough to drain away
 from the sign support. Give all exposed concrete above ground surface a
 rubbed finish.
 Use the same breakaway coupler system throughout the contract.
 2. Anchor for Telescoping Perforated Tubes Supports.
 Drive anchors for telescoping perforated tubes supports a maximum of 4
 inches above the ground or surfacing.
 Install the specified length of anchor unless the Engineer determines a shorter length is sufficient due to good soil bearing developed when driving the
 anchor. The Engineer may reduce anchor lengths to a minimum of 3 feet.
 If set in concrete or bituminous, omit the anchor plate.
 Core the surfacing before installing the anchor unit and fill the cored area
 with like material that matches the surrounding surfacing.
 3. Single Tubular Sign Supports.
 Set tubular sign supports in a concrete foundation. Place plates so the tapered
 bolt slot tapers toward approaching traffic.
 4. W-Shaped Sign Supports.
 a. Breakaway Base Plates.
 Assemble breakaway base plates with the bolt torqued to Plan requirements. Place the plates so the tapered bolt slot tapers toward approaching
 traffic.
 b. Flame Cutting of W-Shape Posts.
 The Engineer will allow the use of a gas cutting torch for cutting metals or preparing joints. Do not flame cut carbon steel above 0.30 percent
 carbon, high alloy steels, heat treated steel, and plated metals unless subsequent corrective treatment is provided as approved by the Engineer.
 Perform flame cutting using the oxyacetylene gas method. Do not deviate from true lines more than 1/16 inch. Repair edge defects according
 to Section 3.2 of AWS Structural Welding Code, as amended by AASHTO Specifications for Welding of Structural Steel Highway Bridges.
 The roughness of flame cut surfaces shall be less than an ANSI roughness
 value of 1,000 microinches. Completely remove slag produced during
 flame cutting.
 If flange plates or other members are cut to a curve, make cuts uniform
 to the required radius. Do not make a series of straight cuts tangent to the
 curve.
 If cutting the ends of members that are to take bearing with a torch, make
 a suitable allowance in their length to permit proper milling or planing.
 Prepare joints for welding using flame cutting or flame gouging methods.
 
 403
 
 754.04 D.4.b
 
 Remove slag and oxidized metals.
 c. Edge Finishing.
 If using the shearing method to form field splice plates and stiffeners that
 have a thickness less than 1/2 inch, leave a minimum of 1/8 inch of extra
 material beyond the specified dimensions. Remove the extra material by
 machining or planing.
 If using the shearing method to form structural steel plates that have a
 thickness of 1/2 inch or greater, leave a minimum of 1/4 inch of extra
 material beyond the specified dimensions. Remove the extra material by
 machining or planing.
 5. Overhead Sign Structures.
 a. General.
 Fabricate all overhead sign structures so that only bolted assembly is required in the field. The Engineer will allow drilling to fasten an overhead
 sign to a bridge.
 Do not field weld.
 b. Anchor Bolt Installation.
 Use a steel template to accurately locate and hold the anchor bolts plumb
 and in proper alignment. Put this template in place during placement of
 the concrete base and leave it in place a minimum of 24 hours after the
 concrete placement is complete. Leave the support cage used to position
 the anchor bolts in the concrete foundation. The Engineer will reject the
 base if anchor bolts are out of position or if the anchor bolts are greater
 than 1:20 out of plumb. Do not alter the base or bend the anchor bolts to
 straighten them or move them into position.
 c. Anchor Bolt Tightening.
 Tighten top and leveling nuts of the anchor bolts according to the following steps:
 (1) Bring all leveling nuts to full bearing on the bottom of the base plate.
 Keep the bottom of the leveling nut as close to the concrete base as practicable, and not more than one inch above the top of the concrete base.
 Thread leveling nuts onto the anchor bolt to provide at least a 1/4 inch
 projection of the bolt above the top nut when in its tightened position.
 (2) Generously add beeswax or equivalent to the top nut bearing face and
 top nut internal threads prior to placement on the anchor bolt. Tighten
 all nuts to a “snug” condition. The Department defines “snug” as the
 tightness attained by the full effort of a person using a wrench with
 a length equal to 14 times the diameter of the anchor bolt (minimum
 wrench length shall be 18 inches). Apply the full effort required to
 achieve a “snug” tight condition as close to the end of the wrench as
 possible, and continue until the nut stops rotating. Tighten by leaning
 back, pulling firmly, and using one’s entire body weight on the end of
 the wrench (with feet braced to prevent slipping). Accomplish snug
 tightening in a minimum of two separate passes of tightening. Sequence tightening by tightening in each pass the opposite side nut, to
 404
 
 754.04 D.5 c.(6)
 
 the extent possible, until all the nuts in that pass have been snugged.
 (3) Check the “snug” tightness of the nut in the presence of the Engineer
 after completing nut snugging as described above but prior to commencing step (4) below. Check the “snug” tightness of the nuts (top
 and leveling) by applying a torque to the nut according Table 754-01.

 (4) After step (2), ensure that the top nut and leveling nuts are in full
 bearing on the base plate. If any gap exists between the nut and the
 base plate, insert a beveled washer between the nut washer and the
 base plate to eliminate the gap. Use a stainless steel Type 304 washer
 of the same diameter as the hardened washer, which is beveled so that
 the gap between the nut and the base plate is eliminated. Retighten all
 nuts according to step (1) and (2) above if beveled washers are added.
 (5) Tighten all top nuts an additional 1/3 turn using a hydraulic wrench.
 Tighten all of the nuts in two separate passes of equal increment
 turns. Use a sequence of tightening in each pass so that the opposite
 side nut, if possible, shall subsequently tightened until all the nuts in
 that pass have been turned. Do not allow the leveling nut to rotate
 during top nut tightening.
 (6) Check the tightness of the nuts in the presence of the Engineer a minimum of 48 hours after completing step (4). Apply torque to the nut in
 accordance with Table 754-02.

 After the anchor bolt nuts have been checked for tightness, the Engineer
 will perform ultrasonic testing and calibration procedures for final acceptance. The Engineer will perform these tests to ensure that no flaws in the
 bolts have been introduced during the construction process and no loose
 nuts or washers exist.
 The Engineer will tap each nut (top and leveling) with a 24 ounce ball
 peen hammer to check for looseness. A tight nut produces a sharp ringing sound, and a loose nut produces a dull sound. The Engineer will tap
 each washer on one side while placing one hand on the other side of the
 washer. If the washer moves, the nut is not properly tightened. The Engineer will use a wrench with a length equal to 14 times the diameter of
 the anchor bolt (minimum 18 inches) to check the tightness of each nut.
 If the Engineer is able to rotate a nut as a result of the application of a
 person’s full effort on the end of the wrench, the nut is not properly tightened. If the Engineer finds any nut or washer to be loose as a result of the
 above acceptance procedure, tighten such loose nuts according to Steps
 (1) through (5) above. If any nuts require tightening after the initial installation, remove and reinstall nuts and washers and, if necessary, remove
 and re-erect the entire structure at no cost to the Department.
 Test to verify the absence of flaws prior to the erection stage. The Engineer will reject the entire base installation because of reflectors found
 with an indication rating less than 15 decibels.
 d. Erection Procedures.
 Erect the overhead sign supports according to the following steps:
 (1) Place the column, without the truss or arm brackets attached, on the
 leveled bottom nuts and washers.
 (2) Place the two perpendicular top nuts and the two parallel top nuts
 to the sign face (in its final position) on the anchor bolts, along with
 their corresponding washers, and snug tighten them.
 (3) Level the column base plate by adjusting only the nuts perpendicular
 and parallel to the sign face in its final position.
 (4) Place the remaining top nuts and washers on the anchor bolts and
 loosely snug tighten them.
 (5) Tighten all bottom and top nuts as specified steps (1) through (4) of
 Section 754.04 D.5.c, “Anchor Bolt Tightening.”
 (6) Place the assembled arm bracket or truss, without the sign, on the
 erected column. Tighten all bolts by the turn-of-nut method specified
 in Section 616.04 G.2.c.(1), “Turn-of-Nut Tightening.” Do not reuse
 any nuts and bolts loosened or removed after being fully tightened.
 The Engineer will not consider previously tightened bolts that have
 been loosened by the tightening of adjacent bolts as reused and they
 may be retightened.
 (7) Place the sign panel on the erected arm bracket or truss.
 (8) Check the anchor bolt nuts connecting the column base to the con406
 
 754.04 I
 
 crete foundation for tightness according to step (5) of Section 754.04
 D.5.c., “Anchor Bolt Tightening.”
 E. Mounting Flat Sheet Signs.
 If washing signs is necessary, use water and a soft bristled brush or a sponge.
 Bolt flat sheet signs to the supports and place a nylon washer between the flat
 washer and the sign face.
 F. Removing and Resetting Signs and Supports.
 Remove and reset existing signs and supports as specified. Stockpile all signs
 and supports not to be reset at designated locations within the project limits. The
 Engineer will arrange to have stockpiled signs removed from the project limits
 and delivered to the Department’s facility.
 Replace removed or reset signs and supports that are damaged during removing,
 resetting, or stockpiling at no additional cost to the Department.
 Remove existing signs and supports as construction progresses, and immediately reset or install.
 The Engineer will allow the temporary reset of existing signs, or the temporary
 installation of new signs. Include the cost of installing and resetting signs temporarily in the price bid for other items.
 G. Remove Sign Foundations.
 Remove steel supports, foundations, and pile footings and restore the surface to
 match the surrounding area. Remove foundations and pile footings to a depth of
 2 feet below the ground line.
 H. Remove Overhead Sign Structure.
 Remove the overhead sign structure, sign, sign lighting, and concrete foundations.
 I. Overlay Panel Sign Refacing.
 Provide overlay panels from 0.063 inch aluminum as specified in Section 894.01
 A, “Flat Sheet Aluminum.”
 Remove the legend, border, and symbol on those signs that have demountable
 copy and place overlay panels on the signs. Do not remove direct applied sheeting legends, borders, and symbols. Direct apply the new legends, borders, and
 symbols to the overlay panels and install on the existing signs.
 Install overlay panels on the existing signs with 5/32 inch diameter aluminum
 blind fasteners. Attach the fasteners so that 1/8 inch of the fastener length protrudes through the existing sign backing. Abut the panels together. Cut the legends, numerals, symbols, and borders where they cross joints.
 If the sign to be overlaid is larger than manufactured overlay panels, use individual panels that meet the following requirements:
 – Use overlay panels between 1-1/2 and 4 feet wide; and
 – Use panels with a minimum length of 8 feet.
 If the overlay panels do not cover the full height of the sign, place the overlay
 
 407
 
 754.04 I
 
 panels on the lower portion of the sign first so the longer side of the panel is vertical. Place the remaining panels above these panels with their long side placed
 horizontally.
 Place rivets at 12-inch intervals around the outer edge of the overlay panel and
 spaced 1 inch from the outer edges. For overlay panels greater than 24 inches
 wide, in addition to the outer edger rivets, place rivets down the center of the
 length of the overlay panel at 12-inch intervals.
 J. Auxiliary Signs.
 Install auxiliary signs used with route markers the same background color as the
 route markers:
 – Interstate, Blue;
 – Interstate Business Loop, Green;
 – State, White;
 – US, White; and
 – County, Blue.

 Allow new asphalt pavement to cool to a temperature below 125°F and
 cure for a period of 72 hours before applying permanent pavement marking.
 b. Data Logging System (DLS).
 The use of a computerized DLS is required for monitoring the application of water based paint and epoxy pavement markings when the plan
 quantity of either water based paint or epoxy pavement marking is 30,000
 linear feet or greater.
 Before beginning striping operations, submit the DLS manufacture’s recommendations for equipment calibration and provide certification that
 the DLS equipment meets these recommendations.
 At the beginning of striping operations each day, verify the DLS measurement by traveling a distance of 100 feet and compare the DLS measurement with a physical measurement.
 Submit an electronic or printed record from the DLS each day for all
 longitudinal areas where striping material was machine placed. The Engineer may require more frequent submittals. Produce the record in its final
 format directly from the DLS, before the records are removed from the
 DLS.
 Include the following data in the report:
 1. Application vehicle speed to nearest 0.1 MPH;
 2. Weight (LBS) and/or volume (GAL as measured through a piston
 displacement pump mechanism) of paint material used by color;
 3. Weight (LBS) of reflective material used;
 4. Pavement surface temperature (°F);
 5. Air temperature (°F);
 6. Dew point (°F);
 7. Humidity (%);
 8. The system shall record the average material application rates and
 film thickness calculated over the section painted; and
 9. For every highway marked, the highway number with beginning and
 ending reference points rounded to the nearest thousandths of a mile
 and all information listed above.
 c. Acceptance.
 Upon initial inspection pavement markings must demonstrate satisfactory retroreflectivity and proper daytime and nighttime colors.
 415
 
 762.04 C.1.c
 
 Where material yield computations show a deficiency in material usage
 of less than 20 percent, the Engineer may accept the work and process
 a contract price adjustment in direct proportion to the percent of the deficiency. The Engineer will reject the work if the deficiency in material
 usage is 20 percent or more.
 Where retroreflectivity is less than 20 percent below the minimum levels,
 the Engineer may accept the work and process a contract price adjustment
 in direct proportion to the percent of the deficiency. The Engineer will
 reject the work if the deficiency in retroreflectivity is 20 percent or more.
 Remove and replace material if the yield computations show that the
 amount of material applied is below the specified requirements. Remove
 and replace material that has measured retroreflectivity below the specified requirements. Use suitable blasting or grinding equipment to removed deficient material.
 If the Engineer requires removal and replacement, remove at least 90
 percent of the deficient line, with no excessive scarring of the existing
 pavement. Perform removal actions to a width of 1 inch wider all around
 the nominal width of the pavement marking to be removed.
 2. Water Based Paint.
 a. Method of Application.
 Apply pavement marking paint and glass beads separately by machine.
 Use hand application where machine application is not feasible.
 Apply water based paint when the air and pavement surface temperatures
 are 45°F or warmer. Do not apply paint when the air or pavement surface
 temperatures are forecasted to be colder than the minimum application
 temperature during the curing period of the paint. Apply pavement marking paint and beads only during daylight hours.
 Install permanent pavement marking over rumble strips only after the fog
 coat on the rumble strips has cured for a minimum of 48 hours.
 b. Rate of Application.
 Apply paint at a rate so that 1 gallon of paint will cover a 4-inch wide
 stripe for a length of 260 to 300 feet. Do not dilute paint, but the Engineer
 will allow a small quantity of naphtha thinner to flush out paint containers.
 Uniformly distribute glass beads over the wet paint stripe at a rate of at
 least 6 pounds per gallon of paint. Apply beads using an automatic pressure dispenser.
 If the application rates are not within the requirements, stop the marking
 application until corrections are made.
 c. Tolerances.
 1. Place the stripe with a tolerance of 3 inches of the specified length.
 2. Place the stripe with a tolerance of 1/4 inch of the specified width.
 3. Place the segment and gap to a tolerance of 6 inches in a 40-foot cycle.
 416
 
 762.04 C.3.c
 
 4. Place the stripe with a tolerance of 2 inches from the proper alignment.
 5. Begin dashed lines placed over existing dashed lines within 6 inches
 of the beginning of the existing line.
 3. Epoxy Paint Pavement Markings.
 a. General.
 Apply pavement marking paint and glass beads separately by machine.
 Use hand application where machine application is not feasible.
 Apply the epoxy pavement marking material at a thickness of 20 mils.
 Calculate thickness without drop on glass beads.
 Apply glass beads immediately after the placement of the epoxy. Use a
 dispenser system that delivers at least 25 pounds of beads per gallon of
 epoxy material.
 If the application rates are not within the requirements, stop the marking
 application until corrections are made.
 Do not apply material over a longitudinal joint.
 Do not apply markings if the wind or other conditions cause a film of
 dust to be deposited on the pavement surface before the material can be
 applied.
 If short term paint was applied, epoxy pavement markings may be placed
 directly over the short-term paint.
 Place epoxy materials only when air and pavement temperatures are at
 least 50°F. The Engineer will allow lower temperature if the manufacturer, in writing, approves a lower temperature and warranties the adhesion
 of the epoxy to the pavement for a minimum of one year.
 Place epoxy material after bituminous surface material has been in place
 for a minimum of 14 days.
 b. Tolerances.
 Place epoxy paint within the tolerances specified in Section 762.04 C.2.c,
 “Tolerances.”
 c. Retroreflectivity.
 Place epoxy pavement markings so that the initial retroreflectivity values
 of the markings are at or above those shown in Table 762-03. The initial
 retroreflectivity values are those obtained at least 2 weeks after the placement of markings.

 a. Short-Term Pavement Marking Condition Classifications.
 The Engineer will rate short-term pavement markings as “acceptable,”
 “marginal,” or “unacceptable” in accordance with Quality Guidelines for
 Temporary Traffic Control Devices and Features, published by ATSSA.
 Install short-term pavement markings that are classified as acceptable.
 The Engineer will allow markings that degrade into the “marginal” category during the course of the work to remain in place. Replace markings
 that fall into the “unacceptable” range no more than 24 hours after being
 notified of the marking’s condition.
 b. Maintenance and Duration.
 As necessary, remove material from raised pavement markers that reduces the brightness of reflectorized sheeting.
 Immediately remove all markings that are no longer required.
 c. Installation Requirements.
 Use the same method of surface preparation as specified for permanent
 installation.
 Apply short-term pavement marking to the center line to the full length
 of the surface treatment and milled surface before sunset on the same day
 the work is performed. Do not resume paving or milling operations if the
 short-term pavement marking has not been replaced as required.
 On the final lift, allow new asphalt pavements to cool to 125°F before
 applying short-term pavement marking paint.
 Place short-term pavement marking on the final lift of new pavement with
 alignment and spacing so that the permanent striping matches when applied. Correct errors in alignment and spacing or remove the short-term
 markings just before the installation of the permanent striping.
 2. Short-Term Pavement Marking – Type NR (Non-Removable).
 Allow the final lift of asphalt pavements to cool to 125°F before Type NR
 markings.
 Place the short-term pavement markings at the rate specified in Section
 762.04 C.2.b., “Rate of Application,” with the following exception:
 Exception: When the permanent pavement marking is specified as epoxy
 paint, apply the short term pavement marking at a thickness of 10 mils.
 
 418
 
 762.06
 
 3. Short-Term Pavement Marking – Type R (Removable).
 Remove Type R markings once they are no longer necessary for traffic control operations.
 4. Short-Term Pavement Marking – Seal Coat Projects.
 Use pavement marking paint and beads for short-term pavement marking for
 seal coat projects.
 Broom the areas to receive the striping before applying the paint and beads,
 without dislodging the chips.
 If the in-place short-term pavement marking has become obscured and has
 lost its required visibility due to being covered, or partially covered, by cover
 coat or blotter material, remove the material from the striped areas by light
 brooming or compressed air before sunset. Correct damage to the cover coat
 material and striping resulting from the removal operation at no additional
 cost to the Department.
 Apply paint at a rate such that 1 gallon of paint will cover a 4-inch wide
 stripe for a length of 200 to 240 feet. Evenly distribute glass beads over the
 wet paint stripe at a rate of at least 6 pounds per gallon of paint.
 5. Raised Pavement Markers.
 Install broken lane lines on two-lane two-way roadways using four markers
 spaced at 3.33-foot centers with a 30-foot gap. Space markers used for solid
 lines on 5-foot centers. In no-passing zones, place the double rows of markers 4 inches apart. Place raised pavement markers used in double solid lines
 side by side.
 Remove raised pavement markers once they are no longer necessary for traffic control operations.
 762.05 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 The Engineer will measure as specified in Section 109.01 “Measurement of Quantities” and as follows:

 764.04 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 A. General.
 Install the guardrail to produce a smooth continuous line with uniform height.
 Set posts plumb with the front faces uniformly aligned.
 Backfill posts with approved material placed and compacted in 6-inch layers,
 using a mechanical tamper.
 When removing guardrail posts and not replacing the posts in the same hole,
 backfill the hole with approved material. When the existing surrounding surface
 is bituminous, place 2 inches of bituminous material at the top of the hole to
 match existing surrounding surface.
 Place hot bituminous pavement before guardrail post installation. Drill post
 holes for the new or reset guardrail through the hot bituminous pavement. Install
 the post in the remaining material by augured holes or driving.
 When posts are installed in augured holes, backfill the holes with approved material without displacing the post alignment. Remove surplus excavated material.
 When posts are driven, make the diameter of the hole in the bituminous pavement sufficient so when the soil around a post heaves up while the post is driven,
 the remaining asphalt will not move. If driving causes damage to posts, replace
 the post and install the replacement post by auguring the hole. Use a post cap if
 making minor vertical adjustments with a sledgehammer or maul.
 Place a maximum thickness of 2 inches of bituminous material around each post
 to blend the post hole into the surrounding bituminous material.
 Do not burn or weld after the material has been galvanized. All holes shall be
 machined drilled.
 Repair areas exposed by cutting or drilling and any damaged galvanized coating
 421
 
 764.04 A
 
 according to Section 854.02, “Damaged Galvanized Coatings.”
 Provide bolts that extend beyond the nuts between 1/4 inch and 1 inch.
 Hang guardrail and end terminals for individual runs in a single day.
 On projects where the roadway will be open to traffic during construction, install
 delineator drums as specified in Section 704, “Temporary Traffic Control” at 25
 foot intervals adjacent to the work site at each location where existing guardrail
 is removed, or where no guardrail previously existed, or at guardrail extensions.
 Keep the delineator drums in place until the installation of the guardrail at that
 location is complete and accepted by the Engineer.
 B. Cable Guardrail.
 Eliminate cable slack by over-tensioning the cable and then backing off to the
 required tension.
 Measure the required tension by achieving a 5-inch deflection by weighting a
 12.5-foot span with a central load of:
 200 pounds when the temperature is 100°F
 220 pounds when the temperature is 80°F
 240 pounds when the temperature is 60°F
 260 pounds when the temperature is 40°F
 Ensure the tension of all the cables is to the same deflection throughout the
 length of the rail.
 Cast concrete anchors in place and do not disturb the earth surrounding the anchor.
 At locations where cable is connected to a cable socket with a wedge-type connection, crimp one wire of the wire rope over the base of the wedge to hold it
 firmly in place.
 C. W-Beam Guardrail.
 Join the rail sections so the splices are lapped to flow in the direction of the traffic nearest the guardrail. Construct the lap splices so the plate ends make contact
 throughout the entire area of the splice.
 Submit a copy of the installation instructions and drawings of the guardrail end
 terminals. Ensure the drawings contain all components of the end treatment assembly.
 D. Removal of Guardrail.
 When guardrail is to be removed from a location where pipes or structures
 are to be extended, leave the guardrail in place until all items protected by the
 guardrail have been extended and the foreslope work behind the guardrail is
 complete.
 If the Engineer determines that the concrete anchors do not interfere with other
 construction, cut off concrete anchors 1 foot below ground level. When concrete
 anchors are removed, backfill the holes with approved material in 6 inch layers.
 Thoroughly tamp each layer using a mechanical tamper. If concrete anchors are
 cut off or removed, shape the surface to match the surrounding area and dispose
 of the removed concrete.
 
 422
 
 762.04 H
 
 E. Salvaged Guardrail Materials.
 Disassemble rail and end treatments to be salvaged at each joint or splice.
 1. Cable Guardrail.
 Stockpile salvaged cable in rolls.
 2. Miscellaneous Hardware.
 Place miscellaneous hardware from the removed guardrail in containers at
 the stockpile site.
 3. Disposal of Unsalvageable Materials.
 Remove and dispose of all damaged posts, rail, and hardware.
 F. Reset Guardrail.
 When resetting guardrail, install the guardrail material as specified for the type
 of guardrail being reset.
 Stockpile the box beam rail removed in lengths not to exceed 36 feet.
 Stockpile the W-beam rail removed for reset in lengths not to exceed 50 feet.
 G. Completion Requirements.
 At locations of guardrail installation where the roadway is open to traffic, complete the installation of each individual run within 10 working days from the
 date all controlling items allow guardrail installation to begin.
 Before guardrail removal, develop a written construction schedule for work at
 the guardrail installation, and have the schedule reviewed by the Engineer. Include a sequence of guardrail installation controlling items and the timing of
 each in the schedule of work. Do not stop work between controlling items for
 more than four working days at any individual run.
 Provide temporary protection according to the plans at an object if unable to
 complete the required work in the specified time. Do not use material installed
 for this purpose in the final guardrail installation. The Department will not make
 separate payment for attenuation provided due to the Contractor’s inability to
 complete the work in the specified time.
 Do not remove the existing guardrail at steep-slope or culvert-extension sites
 until all work, except guardrail installation, is complete.
 If the Contractor fails to comply with all requirements of Section 764.04 G,
 “Completion Requirements,” the Engineer will perform one or both of the following:
 1. The Engineer will apply a contract price reduction of $1000 per day if the
 deficiency is not remedied within 24 hours of notification to correct the item.
 2. The Engineer will have the temporary protection installed by other forces
 and deduct the costs from monies due or that become due to the Contractor.
 If the Engineer uses other forces to install temporary protections, remove and
 dispose of the materials installed by the other forces at no additional cost to the
 Department.

 F. Admixtures.
 Use admixtures as specified in Section 808 “Concrete Admixtures.”
 Use a retarding admixture in Class AAE-3 concrete in bridge decks when the
 temperature of the concrete or the ambient air temperature at the time of placement exceeds 75°F. Provide a retarding admixture that meets the requirements
 of AASHTO M 194 and that are classified as Type B or D under ASTM C 494.
 G. Fly Ash.
 Fly ash, meeting the requirements of Section 820, “Fly Ash,” may replace cement on a 1:1 ratio, up to a maximum of 29 percent by weight.
 Do not use fly ash as a cement substitute for high-early-strength concrete.
 H. Air Content.
 Use one of the following methods to entrain air in the concrete:

 802.03 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 A. Handling and Storing Materials.
 1. Cement or Fly Ash.
 Handle and store cement and fly ash of different types, brands, or sources
 separately. Provide storage that protects the cement or fly ash against damp-
 
 457
 
 802.03 A.1
 
 ness. Do not use cement that contains caked lumps or is salvaged from spillage.
 2. Aggregates.
 Handle and stockpile each separate aggregate component of different source
 or grading separately. Provide adequate equipment and material to ensure a
 continuous batching operation.
 Do not operate aggregate hauling equipment on the stockpile.
 Do not use material from the bottom one foot of the stockpile.
 The Engineer will reject aggregates that become intermixed with aggregates
 of different source or become contaminated by foreign materials. Remove
 rejected aggregate from the plant site.
 The Engineer will reject segregated aggregate unless the aggregate is uniformly remixed to meet the specified gradation.
 Allow washed aggregates to drain for at least eight hours before use to obtain stable and uniform moisture content. The Engineer will consider gravity
 drainage in the weigh hoppers or truck boxes evidence that the moisture
 content is not stable. The moisture content is not uniform if the variations
 in moisture content of any aggregate component causes fluctuations in the
 consistency of successive batches of the mixed concrete.
 Store freshly washed aggregates separately from the drained aggregates in
 use.
 B. Batching of Concrete Materials.
 1. General.
 When directed by the Engineer, test the batching operation accuracy on a
 certified scale. Weigh the batched ingredient on a platform scale. Perform the
 accuracy test at no additional cost to the Department.
 Stop mix production if the scale is out of tolerance. Fix and recertify the
 batching scale before continuing mix production.
 2. Batching Cement and Fly Ash.
 Batch bulk cement and fly ash to a tolerance of 1 percent of the weight specified in the mix design.
 3. Batching Aggregate.
 Batch aggregate components to a tolerance of 2 percent of the weight specified in the mix design.
 4. Batching Water.
 Measure the mixing water for each batch by volume or by weight. Add the
 designated quantity of mixing water to each batch, within a tolerance of 1
 percent.
 C. Measuring and Dispensing Admixtures.
 Measure admixtures used in the concrete and dispense using the manufacturer’s
 recommendations to give a uniform distribution.
 Dispense admixture using a clean device that repetitively controls the batching
 
 458
 
 802.03 D.3
 
 of the admixture within a tolerance of 5 percent of the required volume of material or 1 fluid ounce, whichever is greater. Arrange dispensing equipment to
 allow convenient, visual observation of the volume of admixture dispensed.
 If using more than one admixture in the same batch, add the admixtures separately to prevent contact in their concentrated form.
 D. Mixing and Transporting Concrete.
 1. General.
 Mix the concrete at the site of placement or by a ready-mix method.
 Mix the concrete in the quantity required to provide continuous placement
 and finishing operations. Do not add water to reestablish the required consistency of concrete.
 Operate the mixer so successive batches of concrete do not merge or intermix during the mixing cycle.
 Mix all concrete until the cement, water, aggregates, and admixtures are uniformly distributed.
 Do not use materials containing frost or lumps of frozen material.
 If weather conditions begin damaging the work, stop concrete mixing operations.
 2. Mixing.
 Measure the mixing time from the time all solid materials are in the drum
 until discharge of that batch begins. Charge the drum so a portion of the mixing water enters in advance of the aggregates and cement. Add all remaining
 water after charging the aggregate and cement and before 1/4 of the mixing
 time has elapsed. Include transfer time in multiple compartment mixers in
 mixing time.
 Use a minimum mixing time per batch of 60 seconds. Mix the concrete for
 a minimum of 90 seconds if temporarily operating the mixer under manual
 timing control or the mixer has a rated capacity of less than 10 cubic feet.
 3. Transporting Concrete.
 Deliver concrete to the site of placement in an agitating truck, in a truck mixer operated at agitating speed, or in approved non-agitating equipment. Do
 not exceed 30 minutes in non-agitating equipment or 60 minutes in agitating
 equipment, between introducing the cement to the mixture and the time the
 concrete has been completely discharged.
 Limit the amount of time between introducing the cement into the mix and
 fully discharging the batch to:
 – 30 minutes for non-agitating equipment; or
 – 60 minutes for agitating equipment.
 The Engineer may reduce these time limits if weather conditions affect the
 concrete adversely.
 The Engineer may extend the 60 minute time limit to a maximum of 90 minutes
 459
 
 802.03 D.3
 
 if the ambient air and the concrete mix temperature at the time of mixing is
 less than 80°F, and if the mixed concrete meets the specified requirements
 for maximum water content and air content when discharged at the site of the
 work. The mix must be completely discharged within the 90 minutes. Do not
 add water to concrete after the 60 minute time limit.
 Only produce truck-mixed concrete after all equipment, facilities, and methods for handling and storing materials and for proportioning, mixing, and
 transporting the concrete have been approved.
 Discontinue the use of truck mixed concrete if the delivery of concrete is
 insufficient for continuous placement and finishing.
 Discontinue the use of truck mixed concrete if any properties of the concrete
 are not meeting specifications.
 Place a volume of concrete in the truck-mixer that does not exceed the maximum capacity shown on the manufacturer’s rating plate.
 Clean the truck-mixer at periodic intervals to prevent accumulation of hardened concrete, and empty it of all free water before receiving any batch ingredients.
 After all ingredients are charged in a truck-mixer, rotate the mixer between
 70 and 100 revolutions at mixing speed. If the batch volume is 90 percent or
 less than the rated mixing capacity, the Engineer may reduce the mixing to a
 minimum of 50 revolutions. After mixing is complete, revolve the mixer at
 agitating speed. If water is added, mix an additional 30 revolutions at mixing
 speed after mixing has begun or been completed.
 4. Temperature Control.
 After mixing, maintain the concrete temperature between 50°F and 90°F until placement.
 The Engineer will allow heating or cooling aggregates, mixing water, or both
 if required to maintain the temperature range. Apply the following restrictions:
 – Heat aggregates using indirect heat only and to temperatures not exceeding 150°F;
 – If the aggregate or the water is heated to a temperature exceeding 100°F,
 combine the aggregate and water before placing them in contact with the
 cement;
 – If heated by steam, drain aggregates as specified in Section 802.01 C,
 “Aggregate” before measuring it into the batches; and
 – Use heating methods that heat the materials uniformly.
