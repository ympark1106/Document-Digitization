 The Department will conduct a review of each firm’s safety index. To be prequalified,
 each firm shall maintain a satisfactory safety index. An overall safety index of at least 60
 is considered satisfactory. An index between 60 and 69 may be considered marginal
 results in an in-depth safety audit of a firm’s safety practices and may result in one or
 more of the sanctions listed below as a result of a failing Safety Index. An overall safety
 index equal to or less than 59 is considered unsatisfactory and will prohibit
 prequalification of new firms.

 13
 14
 
 A score of 59 or less for renewing or requalifying firms will result in disciplinary action
 pursuant to Subarticles 102-2(D)(1) through 102-2(D)(4). The Engineer may require the
 Contractor to state in writing the reason for the unsatisfactory rating and produce such
 supporting data as may be necessary to evaluate the circumstances surrounding the rating.
 When the Contractor cannot provide justification to raise the unsatisfactory safety index,
 the Engineer may invoke one or more of the following sanctions:
 
 15
 
 (1) Removal of the firm from the Prequalified Contractors’ List,
 
 16
 
 (2) Placement of the firm on probation for up to 2 years,
 
 17
 
 (3) Auditing of the firm’s safety practices and
 
 18
 
 (4) Giving a written warning to correct any safety deficiencies.
 
 19
 20
 21

 Firms not approved or disqualified to bid or perform subcontract work due to
 an unsatisfactory safety index will not be approved or reinstated to bid or perform
 subcontract work until they can provide adequate evidence that all safety deficiencies
 have been corrected to the satisfaction of the Engineer.

 shall consist of submitting an updated application. Bids of firms who fail to submit these
 documents by their anniversary date will be deemed non-responsive and not considered
 for award. The Engineer may review performance related issues when considering firms
 for renewal. Subcontractors who fail to submit these documents by their anniversary date
 will not be allowed to begin work on any new contracts until these documents are
 received and approved by the Engineer.

 The subsurface report and the subsurface investigation on which it is based were made for
 study, planning and design and not for construction or pay purposes. The various field boring
 logs, rock cores and soil test data available may be reviewed or inspected. Contact the
 Geotechnical Engineering Unit to set up an appointment in the appropriate Regional office.

 General soil and rock strata descriptions and indicated boundaries are based on a geotechnical
 interpretation of available subsurface data and do not necessarily reflect the actual subsurface
 conditions between borings or between sampled strata within the borehole. The laboratory
 sample data and the in-place test data can be relied on only to the degree of reliability inherent
 in the standard test method. The observed water levels or soil moisture conditions indicated
 in the subsurface investigations are as recorded at the time of the investigation. These water
 levels or soil moisture conditions may vary considerably with time according to climatic
 conditions including temperature, precipitation and wind, as well as other nonclimatic factors.

 Details shown in the subsurface investigation report are preliminary only and the final design
 details may be different. For bidding and construction purposes, refer to the contract for final
 design information on this project. The Department does not warrant or guarantee the
 sufficiency or accuracy of the investigation made, nor the interpretations made or opinions of
 the Department as to the type of materials and conditions that may be encountered. The
 bidder or contractor shall make independent subsurface investigations, as to conditions to be
 encountered on this project. The Contractor assumes all risks for any discrepancies between
 the subsurface information and the actual conditions encountered and expressly agrees that
 NCDOT is not liable for any such variances and shall have no claim for additional
 compensation or for an extension of time for any reason resulting from the actual conditions
 encountered at the site differing from those indicated in the subsurface investigation.

 (A) Paper Bid
 
 18
 
 CONSIDERATION OF BIDS
 
 CORRECTION OF BID ERRORS
 
 (1) Omitted Unit Bid Price--Amount Bid Completed--Quantity Bid on is One Unit
 
 19
 20
 21
 22
 
 In the case of a bid item for which the amount bid is completed, but the unit bid price
 is omitted and the quantity shown in the proposal for the bid item is only one unit,
 the unit bid price shall be deemed to be the same as the amount bid for that bid item
 and shall constitute the contract unit price for that bid item.
 
 23
 24
 
 (2) Omitted Unit Bid Price--Amount Bid Completed--Quantity Bid on is More Than
 One Unit
 
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
 
 In the case of a bid item for which the amount bid is completed (extension of the unit
 bid price by the quantity) but the unit bid price is omitted and the quantity shown in
 the proposal for the bid item is more than one unit, the unit bid price shall be deemed
 to be the amount derived by dividing the amount bid for that item by the quantity
 shown in the proposal for that bid item and shall constitute the contract unit price for
 that bid item.
 
 31
 
 (3) Discrepancy in the Unit Bid Price and the Amount Bid
 
 32
 33
 
 In the case of a bid item in which there is a discrepancy between the unit bid price
 and the extension for the bid item (amount bid), the unit bid price shall govern.
 
 34
 35
 36
 37
 38
 
 As an exception to the above, on bids for contracts not funded with any federal
 funds, the extension for the bid item (amount bid) shall govern when the discrepancy
 consists of an obvious clerical mistake in the unit bid price consisting of the
 misplacement of a decimal point. The correction to the unit bid price will be made
 only when the following two conditions are met:
 
 39
 40
 
 (a) The corrected unit bid price multiplied by the quantity equals the amount bid for
 the bid item.
 
 41
 42
 
 (b) The corrected unit bid price is closer to the average of the engineer's estimate
 and the individual bids for the contract item than the uncorrected unit bid price.
 
 43
 44
 45
 46
 
 (4) Omitted Unit Bid Price and Omitted Amount Bid--Deemed Zero Bid
 (a) State Funded Projects
 In the case of omission of the unit bid price and the omission of the amount bid
 for any one item except Mobilization and, in the case of the omission of the
 1-21
 
 Section 103
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 
 amount bid where a lump sum price is called for, the amount bid and the unit bid
 price shall be deemed to be zero where the value of the omitted amount bid is
 1% or less of the total amount bid for the entire project (excluding the omitted
 item). The value of the omitted amount bid will be derived by determining the
 average of the engineer's estimate and the individual bids for that contract item.
 
 6
 7
 8
 
 Where the unit bid price is deemed to be zero as provided in this subarticle, such
 zero unit bid price shall constitute the contract unit price for the affected bid
 item.
 
 9
 10
 11
 
 Where the amount bid for a lump sum bid item is deemed to be zero except
 Mobilization, as provided in this subarticle, such zero amount bid shall
 constitute the contract lump sum price for that bid item.
 
 12
 13
 
 In the case of omission of the amount bid for Mobilization, the bid shall be
 deemed irregular and may be rejected.
 
 14
 
 (b) Federally Funded Projects
 
 15
 16
 17
 18
 
 In the case of omission of the unit bid price and the omission of the amount bid
 for any one item and, in the case of the omission of the amount bid where
 a lump sum price is called for, the bid will be considered nonresponsive and will
 not be considered for award.
 
 19
 
 (5) Unit Bid Prices Containing More Than Four Decimal Places
 
 20
 21
 22
 23
 
 In the case of a Bid Item for which the amount bid contains more than 4 decimal
 places for the Unit Bid Price, only the whole number and the first 4 decimal places
 shall constitute the Contract Unit Price for that Bid Item.
 (B) Electronic Bids
 
 24
 
 (1) Enter a unit price in schedule of items. Totals will be generated automatically.
 
 25
 26
 
 (2) Data incorrectly entered may not be recognized, and the bid item may remain blank
 until entered correctly.
 
 27
 
 (3) Enter no more than 4 decimal places for unit price.
 
 28
 29
 30
 31
 
 (4) Do not enter zero (0) in any unit price field unless zero is the intended bid for that
 item. Zero will be considered a valid bid. However, where zeros are entered for
 items that are authorized alternates to those items for which a non-zero bid price has
 been submitted, zeros will be deemed invalid.
 
 32
 33
 34
 35
 36
 
 (5) When the proposal allows alternate bids, the bidder shall submit a unit or lump sum
 price for every item in the proposal other than items that are authorized alternates to
 those items for which a bid price has been submitted. Where the bidder submits
 a unit price other than zero for all items of an authorized alternate, the Department
 will determine the lowest total price based on the alternate bid.

 NCGS § 136-28.1 for construction or repair work to withdraw his bid after the scheduled
 time of bid opening upon a determination that:
 
 42
 
 (1) A mistake was in fact made in the preparation of the bid.
 
 43
 44
 
 (2) The mistake in the bid is of a clerical or mathematical nature and not one of bad
 judgment, carelessness in inspecting the work site or in reading the contract.
 
 1-22
 
 Section 103

 (5) The notice of mistake and request for withdrawal of the bid by reason of the mistake
 is communicated to the Engineer within 48 hours after the scheduled time of bid
 opening. Upon proper notification of a mistake and request for withdrawal of bid,
 the bidder shall submit within 48 hours written notice of mistake accompanied by
 copies of bid preparation information to the Engineer. The notification of a mistake,
 request for withdrawal of bid and copies of bid preparation information shall be
 submitted to the State Contract Officer or Engineer.

 (B) Hearing by the Engineer
 If a bidder files a notice of mistake along with a request to withdraw his bid, the Engineer
 will promptly hold a hearing thereon. The Engineer will give to the requesting bidder
 reasonable notice of the time and place of any such hearing. The bidder may appear at
 the hearing and present the original working papers, documents or materials used in the
 preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn, together with other facts and arguments in
 support of his request to withdraw his bid. The bidder shall be required to present
 a written affidavit that the documents presented are the original, unaltered documents
 used in the preparation of the bid.
 (C) Action by Chief Engineer
 A determination may be made by the Chief Engineer that the bidder meets the criteria for
 withdrawal of the bid as set forth in Subarticle 103-3(A) upon presentation of clear and
 convincing evidence by the bidder. The Engineer will present his findings to the Chief
 Engineer for action on the bidder's request. The Engineer will advise the bidder of the
 Chief Engineer’s decision before the Department's consideration of award.
 (D) Bid Bond
 If a bid mistake is made and a request to withdraw the bid is made, the bid bond shall
 continue in full force and effect until there is a determination by the Chief Engineer that
 the conditions in Subarticle 103-3(A) have been met. The effect of the refusal of the
 Contractor to give payment and performance bonds within 14 calendar days after the
 notice of award is received by him, if award has been made by the Department after
 consideration and denial of the Contractor's request to withdraw his bid, shall be
 governed by the terms and conditions of the bid bond.

 Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, provides that: “No person in
 the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded
 from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination
 under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” The broader
 application of nondiscrimination law is found in other statutes, executive orders, and
 regulations (see Section III, Pertinent Nondiscrimination Authorities), which provide
 additional protections based on age, sex, disability and religion. In addition, the 1987
 Civil Rights Restoration Act extends nondiscrimination coverage to all programs and
 activities of federal-aid recipients and contractors, including those that are not
 federally-funded.

 The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) hereby gives assurance
 that no person shall on the ground of race, color, national origin, sex, age, and
 disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be
 otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by
 the recipient, as provided by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil
 Rights Restoration Act of 1987, and any other related Civil Rights authorities,
 whether those programs and activities are federally funded or not.

 ensure that NCDOT’s Notice of Nondiscrimination is posted in conspicuous
 locations accessible to all employees and subcontractors on the jobsite, along with
 the Contractor’s own Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Policy Statement. The
 Contractor shall physically incorporate this “Title VI and Nondiscrimination”
 language, in its entirety, into all its subcontracts on federally-assisted and statefunded NCDOT-owned projects, and ensure its inclusion by subcontractors into all
 subsequent lower tier subcontracts. The Contractor and its subcontractors shall also
 physically incorporate the FHWA-1273, in its entirety, into all subcontracts and
 subsequent lower tier subcontracts on Federal-aid highway construction contracts
 only. The Contractor is also responsible for making its subcontractors aware of
 NCDOT’s Discrimination Complaints Process, as follows:

 A bidder who desires to bid on more than one project on which bids are to be opened on
 the same date and who desires to avoid receiving an award of more projects than he is
 equipped to handle, may bid on any number of projects but may limit the total amount of
 work awarded to him on selected projects by completing the form Award Limits on
 Multiple Projects for each project subject to the award limit. In the event that a bidder is
 the lowest responsible bidder on projects subject to the award limit and the value of such
 projects is more than the award limit established by such bidder, the Department will not
 award such bidder projects from among those subject to the award limit which have
 a total value exceeding the award limit. The projects to be awarded to the bidder will be
 those projects on which award will result in the lowest total cost to the Department.
 
 14
 15
 
 In determining the lowest total cost to the Department, the options of rejecting a bid or
 readvertising for new bids may be considered.

 All bids submitted without the properly executed form Award Limits on Multiple
 Projects will not be subject to the award limit. In the event that there is a discrepancy
 between the completed award limit forms submitted by the same bidder for the different
 projects in a letting, the Department reserves the right to declare all such award limit
 forms invalid or to make such interpretation of the discrepancy as may be in the best
 interests of the Department. However, the presence of such discrepancy shall not be
 reason for declaring any bid irregular nor shall it invalidate the conditions of his bid bond
 or bid deposit.

 27
 
 Where a prequalified Contractor bids individually (as opposed to a Joint Venture) on one
 or more projects and bids on one of more projects as part of a Joint Venture, such
 individual bidder and such Joint Venture will be considered separate bidders in applying
 the provisions of this article.

 The intent of the contract is to prescribe the work or improvements that the Contractor
 undertakes to perform, in full compliance with the contract documents. In case the method of
 construction or character of any part of the work is not covered by the plans, these
 specifications shall apply. The Contractor shall perform all work in accordance with the lines,
 grades, typical sections, dimensions and other data shown in the plans, or that may be
 modified by written orders and shall do such additional, extra and incidental work as may be
 considered necessary to complete the work to the full intent of the plans and specifications.
 Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the Contractor shall furnish all implements,
 machinery, equipment, tools, materials, supplies, transportation and labor necessary for the
 prosecution and completion of the work.

 desirable. Under no circumstances will an alteration involve work beyond the termini of the
 proposed construction except as may be necessary to satisfactorily complete the project. Such
 alterations shall not invalidate the contract nor release the Surety, and the Contractor agrees to
 perform the work as altered at his contract unit or lump sum prices the same as if it had been
 a part of the original contract except as otherwise herein provided.

 construction that materially changes the character of the work and the cost of performing
 the work, he will notify the Contractor in writing of his determination. If the Contractor,
 upon receipt of the Engineer's written determination, still intends to file a claim for
 additional compensation by reason of such alteration, he shall notify the Engineer in
 writing of such intent before beginning any of the alleged altered work, and the
 provisions of Subarticle 104-8(B) shall be strictly adhered to.

 Engineer a written notice of intent to file a claim for additional compensation by reason
 of such alleged suspension. No adjustment in compensation will be allowed for idle
 equipment or labor before the time of the submission of the written notice of intent to file
 a claim for additional compensation by reason of such alleged suspension. Upon receipt,
 the Engineer will evaluate the Contractor's notice of intent to file a claim for additional
 compensation. If the Engineer agrees with the Contractor's contention, the Engineer will
 suspend in writing the performance of all or any portion of the work, and
 Subarticle 104-8(C) shall be strictly adhered to.

 determines that no portion of the work should be suspended, he will notify the Contractor
 in writing of his determination. If the Contractor does not agree with the Engineer's
 determination, Subarticle 104-8(C) shall be strictly adhered to. Within 14 calendar days
 after the last day of the alleged suspension, the Contractor shall submit his claim to the
 Engineer in writing on the Contractor Claim Submittal Form available through the
 Construction Unit. Such claim shall set forth the reasons and support for such adjustment
 in compensation, including cost records and any other supporting justification in
 accordance with Subarticle 104-8(C).

 24
 25
 26
 
 No adjustment in compensation will be allowed under Subarticles 104-4(A) and 104-4(B)

 OVERRUNS AND UNDERRUNS OF CONTRACT QUANTITIES
 
 36
 
 (A) General
 
 37
 38
 39
 40
 41
 
 The Engineer reserves the right to make at any time during the work such changes in
 quantities as are necessary to satisfactorily complete the project. Such changes in
 quantities shall not invalidate the contract, nor release the Surety, and the Contractor
 agrees to perform the work as changed. The Engineer will notify the Contractor in
 writing of the significant changes in the quantities.
 
 42
 43
 44
 
 The Contractor will be entitled to an adjustment in contract unit prices for increased costs
 incurred over the original bid prices in performing contract items that overrun or
 underrun the estimated contract quantities only as provided for in this article.
 
 45
 
 (B) Overruns - Increase in Unit Price
 
 46
 47
 48
 49
 
 If the actual quantity of any major contract item overruns the original bid quantity by
 more than 15% of such original bid quantity, or the actual quantity of any minor contract
 item overruns the original bid quantity by more than 100% of such original bid quantity,
 an increase to the contract unit price, excluding loss of anticipated profits, may be
 1-32
 
 Section 104
 1
 2
 3
 
 authorized by the Engineer. Revised contract unit prices pertaining to overruns will be
 applicable only to that portion of the overrun that is in excess of the percentages stated
 above.
 
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 
 (1) Whenever it is anticipated that an overrun in a major or minor contract item in excess
 of that described above will occur, the Contractor may make written request for
 a revision to contract unit prices. It shall be incumbent upon the Contractor to justify
 the request for a revision to contract unit prices. After reviewing the Contractor's
 request, the Engineer will notify the Contractor of his determination as follows:
 
 9
 10
 11
 12
 13
 
 (a) If the Engineer determines a revision to the contract unit price is justified and
 the Engineer and the Contractor are in agreement as to the revision to be made
 to the contract unit price, a supplemental agreement covering the revised
 contract unit price will be consummated before performing work on that
 quantity in excess of the percentage set forth above.
 
 14
 15
 16
 17
 18
 
 If the Engineer determines a revision to the contract unit price is justified and
 the Engineer and the Contractor are not in agreement as to the revision to be
 made to the contract unit price, the Engineer will issue a force account notice
 before performing work on that quantity in excess of the percentage set forth
 above.
 
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 
 (b) If the Engineer determines a revision to the contract unit price is not justified he
 will notify the Contractor of his determination in writing and payments will be
 made for the work at the contract unit price. Upon completion of the work, the
 Contractor may request an adjustment to the contract unit price as provided
 below.

 (2) Whenever an overrun in a contract item in excess of the percentages previously set
 forth has occurred and a supplemental agreement establishing an increase to the
 contract unit price has not been executed or the Engineer has not issued a force
 account notice, the Contractor may make written request for a revision in the original
 contract unit price. Any adjustment to the contract unit prices due to overruns will
 be made by the Engineer based upon his evaluation and comparison of the
 Contractor's documented cost records of the contract unit prices for those contract
 items. The Contractor's documented cost records for the work performed on those
 quantities beyond the percentages stated above shall be kept in accordance with
 Article 109-3. The Contractor's cost records and supporting data shall be complete
 in every respect and in such form that they can be checked. It shall be incumbent
 upon the Contractor to satisfy the Engineer of the validity of any request presented
 by the Contractor for an adjustment to the contract unit price. After reviewing the
 Contractor's request, the Engineer can make such adjustment as he deems warranted
 based upon his engineering judgment and the payment to the Contractor will be
 made accordingly.
 
 40
 
 (C) Underruns - Increase in Unit Price
 
 41
 42
 43
 44
 45
 46
 
 If the actual quantity of any major contract item underruns the original bid quantity by
 more than 15% of such original bid quantity, an increase to the contract unit price,
 excluding loss of anticipated profit, may be authorized by the Engineer. Revised contract
 unit prices pertaining to underruns of major contract items will be applicable to the entire
 quantity of the contract item that underruns. No revision will be made to the contract unit
 price for any minor contract item that underruns the original bid quantities.
 
 47
 48
 49
 50
 51
 
 (1) Whenever it is anticipated that an underrun in a major contract item in excess of that
 described above will occur, the Contractor may make written request for a revision
 to the contract unit price. If the Engineer and the Contractor are in agreement as to
 the revision to be made to the contract unit price, then a supplemental agreement
 covering the revised unit price will be entered into. If the Engineer and the
 1-33
 
 Section 104
 1

 Contractor are not in agreement, then after performance of the work, a revised unit
 price may be determined as described below.

 (2) Whenever an underrun in a major contract item in excess of the percentage
 previously set forth has occurred and a supplemental agreement establishing
 an increase to the contract unit price has not been executed, the Contractor may make
 written request for a revision to the original contract unit price. The Contractor shall
 submit sufficient documentation and analysis of his costs to satisfy the Engineer of
 any non-recovered costs included in the item that underran. Any adjustment to the
 contract unit prices due to underruns will be made by the Engineer based upon his
 evaluation of the Contractor’s documentation and an analysis showing how changes
 in contract item cost are attributable to the underrun. An analysis of costs shall be
 supplemented with the Contractor’s documented cost records for work performed on
 the total quantity of the affected item where the Contractor’s request for
 compensation includes compensation for costs other than recovered fixed costs.
 The Contractor’s cost records shall be complete in every respect and in such form
 that the Engineer can check them. It shall be incumbent upon the Contractor to
 satisfy the Engineer of the validity of any request presented by the Contractor for
 adjustment to the contract unit price. After reviewing the Contractor’s request, the
 Engineer may make such adjustment as he deems warranted, based upon his
 engineering judgment. Payment will be made on the final estimate. The total
 payment, including any additional compensation granted by the Engineer due to an
 underrun in a major contract item, shall not exceed the payment that would have
 been made for the performance of 100% of the original contract quantity at the
 original contract unit price.

 Where non-stock fabricated materials are involved in minor items that underrun or in
 major items that underrun by less than 15%, and where fabrication of such material
 has begun or been completed before the Contractor is advised of the reduction in the
 quantity of the pay item, the Department will reimburse the Contractor for the
 verified fabrication cost, including the cost of material less salvage value, or it may
 instruct the Contractor to have the fabricated material delivered to a site designated
 by the Engineer and make payment for such material in accordance with
 Article 109-6.

 Whenever it is anticipated that an overrun or underrun in a major contract item in excess
 of 15% or an overrun in a minor contract item in excess of 100% will occur, the Engineer
 may make written request for a reduction to the contract unit price. If the Engineer and
 the Contractor are in agreement as to the decrease to be made to the contract unit price,
 a supplemental agreement covering the revised unit price will be consummated before
 beginning work on that quantity in excess of the allowable percentages. If the Engineer
 and the Contractor are not in agreement as to the decrease to be made, the Contractor will
 be directed to perform the affected work on a force account basis. Payment for the
 affected work will be made based upon force account records kept in accordance with
 Article 109-3 but shall not exceed that payment that would have been made at the
 original contract unit price.

 The Engineer may eliminate any item from the contract, and such action will in no way
 invalidate the contract. In the event the item of work involves pre-fabricated materials that
 are not considered to be stock items and fabrication of such material is begun or completed
 before the Contractor is advised of the elimination of the contract item, the Department may
 reimburse the Contractor for the verified fabrication cost including the cost of materials less
 salvage value or may instruct the Contractor to have the fabricated material delivered to a site

 the Engineer suspends the performance of the work. For an alleged suspension, the
 Contractor's notice of intent to file a claim for additional compensation under
 Subarticle 104-4(B) shall be given to the Engineer in writing. The Contractor shall keep
 accurate and detailed records of the alleged idle equipment and alleged idle labor. The
 Contractor's cost records, supporting data and supporting information shall be complete
 in every respect and in such form that they may be checked by the Engineer. The
 Contractor's cost records, supporting data and supporting information for equipment idled
 due to the suspension or alleged suspension shall specifically identify each individual
 piece of equipment, its involvement in the work, its location on the project, the requested
 rental rate and justification as to why the equipment cannot be absorbed into unaffected
 work on the project during the period of suspension or alleged suspension. The
 Contractor's cost records, supporting data and supporting information for idle labor shall
 include the specific employees, classification, dates and hours idled, hourly rate of pay,
 their involvement in the project and justification as to why they cannot be absorbed into
 the unaffected work on the project or other projects during the period of suspension or
 alleged suspension. The Contractor's cost records, supporting data and supporting
 information shall be kept up to date and the Engineer shall be given the opportunity to
 review the methods by which the records, data and information are being maintained.

 Upon receipt, the Engineer will evaluate the Contractor's request. If the Engineer agrees
 that the cost of the work directly associated with the suspension or alleged suspension has
 increased as a result of such suspension or alleged suspension and the suspension or
 alleged suspension was caused by conditions beyond the control of and not the fault of
 the Contractor, his suppliers or subcontractors at any approved tier and not caused by
 weather, the Engineer will make an adjustment, excluding profit, and will modify the
 contract in writing accordingly. The Contractor will be paid the verified actual cost of
 the idle equipment and idle labor. The compensation allowed shall be limited to the
 equipment, labor, bond, insurance and tax costs, excluding profits, computed in
 accordance with Article 109-3.

 This value engineering specification is to provide an incentive to the Contractor to initiate,
 develop and present to the Department for consideration, any cost reduction proposals
 conceived by him involving changes to the contract. This specification does not apply unless
 the proposal submitted is specifically identified by the Contractor as being presented for
 consideration as a Value Engineering Proposal (VEP). Submittals that propose material
 substitutions of permanent features, such as, but not limited to, changes from rigid to flexible
 or flexible to rigid pavements, concrete to steel or steel to concrete bridges will not be
 considered acceptable VEPs.
 Depending on the complexity of evaluation and
 implementations, VEPs that provide for a total savings before distribution of less than
 $10,000 may not be considered.
 
 19
 
 (A) Types of Proposals
 
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 
 VEPs contemplated are those that would result in a net savings to the Department by
 providing a decrease in the total cost of construction or reduce the construction time
 without increasing the cost to construct the project. The effects the VEP may have on the
 following items, but not limited to these items, will be considered by the Department
 when evaluating the VEP:

 Standardized features, and
 Environmental impact.
 
 (B) Evaluation of Proposals
 
 35
 36
 37
 
 The Department reserves the right to reject the VEP or deduct from the savings identified
 in the VEP to compensate for any adverse effects to these items that may result from
 implementation of the VEP.
 
 38
 39
 40
 41
 42
 43
 44
 45
 46
 47
 
 The Department reserves the right to reject, at its discretion, any VEP submitted that
 would require additional right of way. Substitution of another design alternate detailed in
 the contract plans for the one that the Contractor bid will not be allowed. Plan errors that
 are identified by the Contractor and that result in a cost reduction will not qualify for
 submittal as a VEP. Pending execution of a formal supplemental agreement
 implementing an approved VEP and transferal of final plans (hard copy and electronic)
 sealed by an engineer licensed in the State of North Carolina incorporating an approved
 VEP to the Resident Engineer and the State Value Management Engineer, the Contractor
 shall remain obligated to perform in accordance with the terms of the existing contract.
 No time extension will be granted due to the time required to review a VEP.

 (C) Subcontractors
 The Contractor is encouraged to include this specification in contracts with
 subcontractors.
 The Contractor shall encourage submissions of VEPs from
 subcontractors; however, it is not mandatory that the Contractor accept or transmit to the
 Department, VEPs proposed by his subcontractors. The Contractor may choose any
 arrangement for the subcontractor value engineering payments, provided that these
 payments shall not reduce the Department's share of the savings resulting from the VEP.
 (D) Preliminary Review
 Should the Contractor desire a preliminary review of a possible VEP, before expending
 considerable time and expense in full development, a copy of the preliminary VEP shall
 be submitted to the Resident Engineer and the State Value Management Engineer at
 ValueManagementUnit@ncdot.gov. The submittal shall state “Preliminary Value
 Engineering Proposal Review Request” and shall contain sufficient drawings, cost
 estimates and written information that can be clearly understood and interpreted. Include
 the identity of any Private Engineering Firms proposed by the Contractor to prepare
 designs or revisions to designs. The Department will review the preliminary submittal
 only to the extent necessary to determine if it has possible merit as a VEP. This review
 does not obligate the Department to approve the final VEP should a preliminary review
 indicate the VEP has possible merit. The Department is under no obligation to consider
 any VEP (Preliminary or Final) that is submitted.
 (E) Final Proposal
 
 22
 23
 24
 
 A copy of the Final VEP shall be submitted by the Contractor to the Resident Engineer
 and the State Value Management Engineer at ValueManagementUnit@ncdot.gov. The
 VEP shall contain, at a minimum, the following:
 
 25
 
 (1) A statement that the request for the modification is being made as a VEP.
 
 26
 27
 
 (2) A description of the difference between the existing contract requirements and the
 proposed modifications, with the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each.

 (3) If applicable, a complete drawing of the details covering the proposed modifications
 and supporting design computations shall be included in the final submittal. The
 preparation of new designs or drawings shall be accomplished and sealed by
 an engineer licensed in the State of North Carolina. Further, the Department may
 require a review, and possibly the redesign, be accomplished by the project's original
 designer, or an approved equal. The Department may contract with private
 engineering firms, when needed, for reviews requested by the Department. The
 Contractor shall contract with the original project designer, or an approved equal,
 when required by the Department, for any design work needed to completely and
 accurately prepare contract drawings. The Department may waive the requirements
 to have the preparation of contract drawings accomplished by an engineer licensed in
 the State of North Carolina or the project's original design based on the extent, detail
 and complexity of the design needed to implement the proposal.
 
 41
 42
 
 (4) An itemized list of the contract requirements that would be modified and
 a recommendation of how to make each modification.
 
 43
 44
 
 (5) A detailed estimate of the cost of performing the work under the proposed
 modification.
 
 45
 46
 47
 
 (6) A statement of the time when approval of the proposal shall be issued by the
 Department to obtain the total estimate cost reduction during the remainder of the
 contract, noting any effect on the contract completion or delivery schedule.

 To facilitate the preparation of revisions to contract drawings, the Contractor may
 purchase reproducible copies of drawings for his use through the Department's Value
 Management Unit. The preparation of new design drawings by or for the Contractor
 shall be coordinated with the appropriate Design Branch through the State Value
 Management Engineer. The Contractor shall provide, at no charge to the Department,
 one set of reproducible drawings of the approved design needed to implement the VEP.
 Drawings (hardcopy and electronic) which are sealed by an engineer licensed in the State
 of North Carolina shall be submitted to the State Value Management Engineer no later
 than 10 business days after acceptance of a VEP unless otherwise permitted.

 The Engineer will be the sole judge of the acceptability of a VEP requested in accordance
 with these requirements and of the estimated net savings resulting from the approval of
 all or any part of the VEP. The Contractor has the right to withdraw, in whole or in part,
 any VEP not accepted by the Department within the period to be specified in the VEP per
 Subarticle 104-12(E)(6).

 If a VEP is approved, the necessary changes will be effected by supplemental agreement.
 Included as a part of the supplemental agreement will be requirements for price
 adjustment giving the Contractor 50% of the net savings to the project resulting from the
 modifications. Supplemental agreements executed for design-bid-build contracts shall
 reflect any realized savings in the corresponding line items. Supplemental agreements
 executed for design-build contracts shall add one line item deducting the full savings
 from the total contract price and one line item crediting the Contractor with 50% of the
 total VEP savings.
 
 24
 25
 26
 27
 
 The Department reserves the right to include in the supplemental agreement any
 conditions it deems appropriate for consideration, approval and implementation of the
 VEP. Acceptance of the supplemental agreement by the Contractor shall constitute
 acceptance of such conditions.

 The final net savings to be distributed will be the difference in cost between the existing
 contract cost for the involved unit bid items and actual final cost occurring as a result of
 the modification. Only those unit bid items directly affected by the supplemental
 agreement will be considered in making the final determination of net savings. In
 determining the estimated net savings, the Department reserves the right to disregard the
 contract prices if, in the judgment of the Department, such prices do not represent a fair
 measure of the value of the work to be performed or to be deleted. Subsequent change
 documents affecting the modified unit bid items, but not related to the VEP, will be
 excluded from such determination. The Department's review and administrative costs for
 VEPs will be borne by the Department. The Contractor's costs for designs and/or
 revisions to designs and the preparation of design drawings will be borne by the
 Contractor. The costs to either party will not be considered in determining the net
 savings obtained by implementing the VEP. The Contractor's portion of the net savings
 shall constitute full compensation to him for effecting all changes pursuant to the
 agreement. The net savings will be prorated, 50% to the Contractor and 50% to the
 Department, for all accepted VEPs.

 Upon execution of the supplemental agreement, the Department will thereafter have the
 right to use, duplicate or disclose, in whole or in part, any data necessary for the use of
 the modification on other projects without obligation or compensation of any kind to the
 Contractor. Restrictions or conditions imposed by the Contractor for use of the VEP on
 other projects shall not be valid.

 Except as may be otherwise precluded by this specification, the Contractor may submit
 a previously approved VEP on another project.

 25
 
 It is the policy of the Department to aid in reduction of materials that become a part of our
 solid waste stream. To that extent the Department encourages contractors to initiate, develop
 and use products and construction methods that incorporate the use of recycled or solid waste
 products in the project. Recycled products or waste materials will be those products or
 materials that would otherwise become solid waste and are collected, separated, or processed
 and reused or returned to reuse in the form of raw materials or products that are incorporated
 into a beneficial reuse on the project. Targeted materials include, but are not limited to, the
 following: plastic, glass, paper, cardboard, shingles, tires, fly ash, bottom ash, sludge and
 construction and demolition debris.
 
 26
 27
 28
 
 This Specification will not be applicable to reclaimed asphalt materials used in accordance
 with Section 610 and shall not be applicable to any recycled or solid waste materials that are
 specified for use by the Department on the project.
 
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 34
 35
 
 To use recycled or solid waste materials, the Contractor shall submit to the Department of
 Transportation a Recycled Products or Solid Waste Materials Proposal for approval. This
 proposal shall be submitted to the Resident Engineer and the State Value Management
 Engineer in the Value Management Office. The proposal shall contain, at a minimum,
 a statement that the request for the modification is being made as a Recycled Products or
 Solid Waste Materials proposal and the requirements in Subarticles 104-12(E)(2)
 through 104-12(E)(6).
 
 36
 37
 
 The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining any and all permits that may be required for
 the hauling, storing, or handling of the targeted materials.
 
 38
 39
 40
 
 If a Recycled Products or Solid Waste Materials proposal is approved, the necessary changes
 will be effected by supplemental agreement. Included as a part of the supplemental
 agreement will be requirements for price adjustment as follows:
 
 41
 42
 
 (A) If the proposal results in a net savings to the Department the savings and distribution of
 the savings shall be done in accordance with Article 104-12.
 
 43
 44
 45
 46
 47
 48
 
 (B) If the proposal results in a net increase in the project cost but is judged to have
 a significant effect on the development of long term markets for the targeted materials, or
 results in significant beneficial usage of project generated debris that would have
 otherwise been disposed of in accordance with Section 802, the Department will bear the
 approved increased costs, if any. This includes recycled products that have been
 approved by the Department but were not originally included in this contract.

 (C) If the proposal is new and innovative, never used in the Department projects before as
 approved by the Engineer and results in a net savings to the Department, the savings shall
 be distributed in accordance with Article 104-12. However, when this innovative
 proposal results in a net increase in project cost, Subarticle 104-13(B)(2) shall apply, and
 at least $500, but not more than $2,500, may be awarded to the Contractor.

 The quantities of reused or recycled materials either incorporated in the project or diverted
 from landfills and any practice that minimized the environmental impacts on the project shall
 be reported by July 1 annually by the Contractor on the Project Construction Reuse and
 Recycling Reporting Form. The Project Construction Reuse and Recycling Reporting Form
 and a location tool for local recycling facilities are available on the Department’s web site.

 The Contractor shall remain obligated to perform the work in accordance with the terms of the
 existing contract pending execution of the supplemental agreement that implements
 an approved Recycled Products or Solid Waste Materials proposal and will not be entitled to
 any additional compensation or additional contract time if a Recycled Products or Solid Waste
 Materials proposal is not accepted.
 
 18
 19
 20
 21
 
 The Department reserves the right to reject, at its discretion, any Recycled Products or Solid
 Waste Materials proposal. The Engineer will be the sole judge of the acceptability, the value,
 the estimated net savings and any additional compensation to be paid to the Contractor for all
 or any part of the proposal.
 
 22
 
 Article 104-3 does not apply to a Recycled Products or Solid Waste Materials proposal.

 The plans shall be supplemented by such approved working drawings as are necessary to
 adequately control the work. Working drawings furnished by the Contractor and approved by
 the Engineer shall consist of such detailed drawings as may be required to adequately control
 the work and are not included in the plans furnished by the Department. They may include
 stress sheets, shop drawings, erection drawings, falsework drawings, cofferdam drawings,
 bending diagrams for reinforcing steel, catalog cuts, or any other supplementary drawings or
 similar data required of the Contractor. When working drawings are approved by the
 Engineer, such approval shall not operate to relieve the Contractor of any of his responsibility
 under the contract for the successful completion of the work.
 
 10

 14
 15
 
 Unless otherwise specified, the Contractor shall allow 30 calendar days for review and
 approval, or acceptance, of working drawings from the date they are received until they are
 returned by the Engineer, unless otherwise stated. If revised drawings are required,
 appropriate additional time shall be allowed for review and approval, or acceptance, of the
 revised drawings. The Contractor shall have no claim for extension of completion dates or
 additional compensation due to this review period.
 
 16

 In the event the Engineer finds the materials or the finished product in which the materials are
 used not within reasonably close conformity with the contract but that reasonably acceptable
 work has been produced, he will then make a determination if the work is to be accepted and
 remain in place. If the Engineer determines that the work is to be accepted, he will have the
 authority to make such adjustment in contract price as he deems warranted based upon his
 engineering judgment and the final estimate will be paid accordingly.
 
 30

 When a project is let under more than one contract and the plans or special provisions include
 a construction schedule, it shall be the responsibility of the Contractors to complete the
 various phases of the project in accordance with the time limits specified such that the total
 contracts will be completed by the completion date. This construction schedule will remain in
 effect until such time as the Contractors, at their option submit to the Engineer a joint
 construction schedule meeting the approval of the Engineer. This joint construction schedule
 shall be signed by authorized representatives of each firm and upon the approval of the
 Engineer shall be binding on each firm. Subsequent modifications to the joint construction
 schedule may be made during the course of the work in the same manner.

 Failure of the Contractor to complete the various phases of work within the time limits set
 forth in the construction schedule or latest approved joint construction schedule shall be just
 cause for removing the Contractor from the Department's list of qualified contractors.
 A Contractor disqualified by reason of this provision will not be reinstated until such time as
 his progress is in accordance with the latest approved construction schedule or until the
 project is completed and accepted, whichever occurs first.

 The Contractor shall use an independent utility locating service to locate utilities. Identify
 excavation locations by means of pre-marking with white paint, flags, or stakes or provide a
 specific written description of the location in the locate request. The Contractor shall use
 special care working in, around and near all existing utilities that are encountered during
 construction, protecting them where necessary so that they will give uninterrupted service.
 
 33
 34
 35
 
 The Contractor shall cooperate with the utility owner and/or the owner's representative in the
 adjustment or placement of utility facilities when such adjustment or placement is made
 necessary by the construction of the project or has been authorized by the Department.

 work to be performed by the utility owner or his representative; and as to whether or not any
 utility work is planned by the owner in conjunction with the project construction. The
 Contractor shall consider in his bid all of the permanent and temporary utility facilities in their
 present or relocated positions, whether or not specifically shown in the plans or covered in the
 project special provisions. It will be the Contractor's responsibility to anticipate any
 additional costs to him resulting from such utility work and to reflect these costs in his bid for
 the various items in the contract.

 38
 39
 40
 41
 42
 
 The presence of the Engineer or inspector at the work site shall in no way lessen the
 Contractor's responsibility for conformity with the contract. Should the Engineer or
 Inspector, at any time before final acceptance, fail to point out or reject materials or work that
 does not conform to the contract, whether from lack of discovery or for any other reason, it
 shall in no way prevent later rejection or corrections to the unsatisfactory materials or work
 when discovered. The Contractor shall have no claim for losses suffered due to any necessary
 removals or repairs resulting from the unsatisfactory work.

 If the Engineer requests it, the Contractor, at any time before final acceptance of the work,
 shall remove or uncover such portions of the finished work as may be directed. After
 examination, the Contractor shall restore said portions of the work to the standard required by
 the specifications. The Contractor shall keep cost records of the work performed and if the
 uncovered work is found to be acceptable by the Engineer, the Department will pay the
 Contractor on a force account basis in accordance with Article 109-3 for the cost of
 uncovering, or removing and the replacing of the covering or making good of the parts
 removed; but should the work so exposed or examined prove unacceptable by the Engineer,
 the uncovering or removing and the replacing of the covering or making good of the parts
 removed, shall be at no cost to the Department.

 When any other unit of government or political subdivision is to pay a portion of the cost of
 the work covered by the contract, its respective representatives shall have the right to inspect
 the work. When work is to be performed on the right of way of any railroad corporation or in
 proximity to other public utilities, the representatives of the railroad corporation and/or the
 public utilities shall have the right to inspect the work. Such inspection shall in no sense
 make any unit of government or political subdivision or any railroad corporation or public
 utility a party to the contract and shall in no way interfere with the rights of either party
 thereunder.

 No work shall be performed without established lines and grades except as otherwise
 permitted by the Engineer. Work performed contrary to the instructions of the Engineer or
 contrary to any approvals granted by the Engineer will be considered as unauthorized and
 may not be paid under the requirements of the contract. Work performed beyond the lines
 shown in the plans or as given, except as herein specified, or any extra work performed
 without authority will be considered as unauthorized and may not be paid under the

 The Department has the right to place load limit restrictions on the load a Contractor may haul
 on any road or bridge in the vicinity of his contract. The Contractor, before bidding on
 a project, will be responsible for making his own investigations to determine the possibility of
 load limit restrictions being placed on any of the highways he plans to use for hauling
 purposes. The Contractor shall not be entitled to an extension of time or to compensation for
 any costs, inconvenience, delay, or any other adversity to the Contractor as the result of any
 reduction by the Department in load limit, or as the result of a refusal by the Department to
 raise load limits as hereinafter provided or under any other conditions. Any such reduction in
 load limit or refusal to raise load limits shall not constitute a basis for a claim for additional
 compensation.

 16
 
 Wherever load limit restrictions below the statutory legal load limit have been posted on any
 roads and bridges on the project or within the vicinity of the project, the Department may
 remove the load limit restrictions from such roads and bridges upon written request from the
 Contractor, and the Contractor thereafter will be allowed to haul up to the statutory legal
 limits over such roads and bridges, provided the Contractor enters into an agreement with the
 Department providing for:
 
 17
 18
 
 (A) Maintenance by the Contractor of such roads in a condition satisfactory to the Engineer
 during the haul period.
 
 19
 20
 21
 
 (B) Repair by the Contractor at his expense, of all damages to such roads after haul is
 completed to place them in a condition as good as they were before removal of the load
 limits.
 
 22
 23
 24
 
 (C) Furnishing a bond by the Contractor in an amount determined by the Engineer for the
 roads. Furnishing a bond for the roads does not entitle the Contractor to exceed the
 posted load limits of any bridge.
 
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 
 (D) Assumption by the Contractor of all costs of strengthening any bridges that may be
 necessary to safely haul loads up to statutory legal limits. The Department will, upon
 request by the Contractor, make a determination as to the method and extent of
 strengthening required for the bridges and will advise the Contractor as to the amount of
 work to be done or an estimate of the charges for the work if performed by Department
 forces. When Department forces perform the work, the Contractor shall reimburse the
 Department in the amount of the actual charges for said work. When Contractor's forces
 perform the work, it shall be done in accordance with plans approved by the Engineer and
 under his inspection.
 
 34
 35
 36
 37
 
 (E) Indemnification of the Department against any and all claims from third persons arising
 out of or resulting from the hauling operation or the maintenance, or lack of maintenance,
 of haul roads. Haul roads shall be maintained for the Contractor's hauling operations and
 for the use of the general public.

 The Contractor shall take whatever measures are necessary to minimize soil erosion and
 siltation, water pollution and air pollution caused by his operations. The Contractor shall
 comply with the applicable regulations of all legally constituted authorities relating to
 pollution prevention and control. The Contractor shall keep himself fully informed of all
 such regulations that in any way affect the conduct of the work and shall at all times
 observe and comply with all such regulations. In the event of conflict between such
 regulations and the specifications, the more restrictive requirements shall apply.
 
 10
 11
 12
 13
 14
 15
 
 The Engineer will limit the area over which clearing and grubbing, excavation, borrow
 and embankment operations are performed whenever the Contractor's operations do not
 make effective use of construction practices and temporary measures which will
 minimize erosion, or whenever construction operations have not been coordinated to
 effectively minimize erosion, or whenever permanent erosion control features are not
 being completed as soon as permitted by construction operations.
 
 16
 17
 18
 19
 20
 
 Following completion of any construction phase or operation, on any graded slope or any
 disturbed area, the Contractor shall provide ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion
 within 21 calendar days or within a time period specified by the
 NCG 010000 Construction Permit. The ground cover shall be either temporary or
 permanent and the type specified in the contract.
 
 21
 
 (B) Erosion and Siltation Control
 
 22
 23
 24
 
 The Contractor shall exercise every reasonable precaution throughout the life of the
 project to prevent the eroding of soil and the silting of rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs,
 other water impoundments, wetlands, ground surfaces or other property.
 
 25
 26
 27
 28
 
 Before suspension of operations on the project or any portion thereof, the Contractor shall
 take all necessary measures to protect the construction area, including, but not limited to,
 borrow sources, soil type base course sources and waste areas from erosion during the
 period of suspension.

 and at all other areas affected by the construction of the project, including, but not
 specifically limited to, unpaved secondary roads, haul roads, access roads, disposal sites,
 borrow and material sources and production sites. Dust control shall not be considered
 effective where the amount of dust creates a potential or actual unsafe condition, public
 nuisance, or condition endangering the value, utility, or appearance of any property.
 
 42
 43
 
 The Contractor will not be directly compensated for any dust control measures necessary,
 as this work will be incidental to the work covered by the various contract items.

 such measures. In the event that the Contractor fails to perform such measures within
 24 hours after receipt of such notice with adequate forces and equipment, the Engineer
 may suspend the work as provided above, or may proceed to have such measures
 performed with other forces and equipment, or both. No payment will be made to the
 Contractor for the performance of this work and the cost of such work so performed will
 be deducted from monies due the Contractor on his contract.

 It is the intent of these Specifications that the Contractor shall commence work on the date of
 availability shown in the contract or as soon thereafter as practicable, except that when
 required by permits included in the proposal, that work in jurisdictional waters and wetlands
 shall not begin until a meeting is held between the Department, Regulatory Agencies and the
 Contractor. The Contractor shall not begin work before the date of availability without
 written approval of the Engineer. If such approval is given, the Department will assume no
 responsibility for any delays caused before the date of availability by any reason whatsoever,
 and such delays, if any, will not constitute a valid reason for extending the completion date.

 Engineer. If the Contractor desires to use a method or type of equipment other than those
 specified in the contract, he may request approval from the Engineer to do so. The request
 shall be in writing and shall include a full description of the methods and equipment proposed
 to be used and an explanation of the reasons for desiring to make the change. If approval is
 given it will be on the condition that the Contractor will be fully responsible for producing
 construction work in conformity with contract requirements. If, after trial use of the
 substituted methods or equipment, the Engineer determines that the work produced does not
 meet contract requirements, the Contractor shall discontinue the use of the substitute method
 or equipment and shall complete the remaining construction with the specified methods and
 equipment. The Contractor shall remove the unsatisfactory work and replace it with work of
 specified quality, or take such other corrective action as the Engineer may direct. No change
 will be made in basis of payment for the construction items involved or in the completion date
 as a result of authorizing a change in methods or equipment under these provisions.

 The Contractor shall not sublet, sell, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of the contract or
 any portion thereof; or of his right, title, or interest therein; without written consent of the
 Engineer. All requests to sublet work shall be submitted within 30 calendar days of the date of
 availability or prior to expiration of 20% of the contract time, whichever date is later, unless
 otherwise approved by the Engineer. In case such consent is given, the sublet work shall be
 performed by the subcontractor unless otherwise approved in writing by the Engineer. Failure
 of the Contractor to comply with the Standard Specifications will be just cause for the work to
 be considered unauthorized in accordance with Article 105-12. A firm that has been
 disqualified due to its failure to maintain satisfactory progress under Article 108-8 will not be
 approved as a subcontractor until the firm demonstrates the ability to perform the work in a
 satisfactory manner. When directed by the Engineer, the Contractor shall submit a certified
 copy of the actual subcontract agreement executed between the Contractor and subcontractor
 before written consent being issued by the Engineer. In case such consent is given, the
 Contractor will be permitted to sublet a portion thereof, but shall perform with his own
 organization, work amounting to not less than 40% of the total original contract amount,
 except:

 percentage of work required to be performed by the Contractor. If the Contractor sublets
 items of work but elects to purchase material for the subcontractor, the value of the material
 purchased will be included in the total dollar amount considered to have been sublet.

 written consent of the Engineer. When directed by the Engineer, the contractor shall submit
 a certified copy of the actual subcontract agreement executed between the subcontractor and
 the second tier subcontractor. In the event of an assignment by operations of law or the
 bankruptcy of the subcontractor, the contractor shall have the right, power and authority, in its
 discretion, without violating the contract or releasing the Surety, to terminate the subcontract.
 An assignment by operations of law or assignment for the benefit of creditors or the

 If the Contractor or a subcontractor enters into a lease or rental agreement for equipment
 based upon payment for a unit of work, such agreement will be considered subletting of the
 contract unless the lease or rental agreement is with a commercial equipment company,

 The Engineer will check the Contractor's progress at the time each partial pay estimate is
 prepared. The Contractor's progress may be considered as unsatisfactory as follows:
 
 10
 
 FAILURE TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY PROGRESS
 
 (A) The Contractor's progress is found to be less than that described in either count below:
 
 11
 12
 13
 14
 
 (1) The dollar value of the work completed, excluding material payments allowed by
 Article 109-5, is less than the dollar value of the work that should have been
 completed, on the basis of the Contractor's approved progress schedule, by more than
 15% of the current contract amount.
 
 15
 16
 17
 18
 19
 
 The dollar value of the work completed will be the total estimate to date shown in
 the latest partial pay estimate, excluding material payments allowed by
 Article 109-5. The current contract amount will be the total amount bid plus
 accumulated overruns less accumulated underruns shown in the latest partial pay
 estimate.
 
 20
 21
 22
 23
 
 (2) The percentage of the work completed is less than the percentage of contract time
 elapsed on the work by more than 15%. The percentage of work completed will be
 the dollar value of the work completed as defined above, divided by the current
 contract amount as defined above.
 
 24
 25
 26
 
 The percentage of contract time elapsed will be the number of calendar days elapsed
 as shown in the latest partial pay estimate divided by the total contract time in
 calendar days.
 
 27
 28
 29
 
 (B) The Contractor fails to begin and pursue the work in accordance with Article 108-1
 before the expiration of 5% of the original contract time after the date work was
 scheduled to begin based upon the approved progress schedule.
 
 30
 31
 
 (C) The Engineer anticipates the Contractor will not complete the work described in the
 contract by the intermediate contract time or the contract completion date.
 
 32
 33
 34
 35
 36
 37
 
 When the Contractor's progress is found to be unsatisfactory as described in
 Subarticles 108-8(A), 108-8(B) and 108-8(C) above, the Engineer may make written demand
 of the Contractor to state in writing the reason for the unsatisfactory progress and produce
 such supporting data as the Engineer may require or the Contractor may desire to submit. The
 Engineer will consider the justifications submitted by the Contractor and extensions of the
 completion date have or may be allowed in accordance with Subarticle 108-10(B).
 
 38
 39
 
 When the Contractor cannot satisfactorily justify the unsatisfactory progress, the Engineer
 may invoke one or more of the following sanctions:
 
 40
 41
 
 (1) Withhold anticipated liquidated damages from amounts currently due or that become
 due.
 
 42
 
 (2) Remove the Contractor from the Department's Prequalified Bidders List.
 
 43
 44
 
 When any of the above sanctions have been invoked, they shall remain in effect until
 rescinded by the Engineer.

 DEFAULT OF CONTRACT
 
 The Department shall have the right to declare default of the contract for breach by the
 Contractor of any material term or condition of the contract as determined by the
 Department. Material breach by the Contractor shall include, but specifically shall not be
 limited to failure to begin work under the contract within the time specified; failure to
 provide workmen, equipment, or materials adequate to perform the work in conformity
 with the contract by the completion date; unsatisfactory performance of the work; refusal
 or failure to replace defective work; failure to maintain satisfactory work progress; failure
 to comply with equal employment opportunity contract requirements; insolvency or
 bankruptcy, or any act of insolvency or bankruptcy; and making an assignment for
 benefit of creditors.
 (B) Corrective Actions upon Default
 In the event of a breach of the contract by the Contractor, the Department shall have the
 right, power and authority, in its sole discretion, without violating the contract or
 releasing the Surety: to assume full control of the prosecution of the contract in the place
 and stead of the Contractor in directing Contractor's agents, employees and
 subcontractors in the performance of the work and in utilizing all materials, tools,
 machinery, equipment and structures located on the project; to perform the work or any
 part thereof with Department personnel and equipment or to use any or all materials and
 equipment located on the project that are suitable and acceptable; to relet the work upon
 such terms and conditions as the Department shall deem appropriate; to employ any other
 methods that it may determine are required for completion of the contract in
 an acceptable manner; and to withhold any sums due the Contractor under the contract
 without penalty or interest until the work is completed and accepted by the Department.
 (C) Notice
 Before invoking any of the corrective actions provided for herein, the Department will
 give the Contractor at least 7 calendar days written notice with a copy to the Surety, that
 will set forth the breach of contract involved and the corrective actions to be imposed.
 The Department, in its discretion, may grant the Contractor time in excess of 7 calendar
 days within which to comply with the contract and the time allowed will be set forth in
 writing. If the Department determines during such period that the Contractor is not
 proceeding satisfactorily to compliance, it may impose the corrective actions after
 24 hours’ notice to the Contractor. If the Department determines that the Contractor is
 not in compliance at the end of the time allowed, it may immediately impose any of the
 corrective actions set forth herein and will advise the Contractor, in writing, with a copy
 to the Surety of the corrective actions imposed.

 After declaration of default has been made final, the Contractor will be entitled to receive
 payment for work satisfactorily completed or portions of work satisfactorily completed,
 less any sums that may be due the Department from the Contractor but in no event shall
 payment exceed the contract unit or lump sum price for such work. The Department, at
 its election, may retain the sum due the Contractor, or any portion thereof, without
 interest or penalty, until the contract work is completed; or it may make payment to the
 Contractor upon declaration of default for work satisfactorily completed to the date that
 notice of default is received by the Contractor. The Contractor may be required by the
 Engineer to carry to a stage of completion satisfactory to the Engineer any work in
 progress, the value of which, otherwise, would be lost by immediate cessation of work.
 Payment for such work will be made upon the basis hereinafter set out.
 
 50
 51
 
 In the event that the Contractor's employees, equipment, or materials are used in
 prosecution of the work, or any part thereof, after default is declared, payment to the
 1-73
 
 Section 108

 Contractor may be by contract unit or lump sum prices for the work performed, or, if the
 Engineer determines that such prices do not represent the value of the work performed,
 payment for the type of work or services performed will be made on a force account
 basis, as set forth in Article 109-3, less any sums that may be due the Department; but in
 no event shall payment exceed the contract unit or lump sum price for such work or
 services. Determination of the method of payment shall be in the sole discretion of the
 Engineer, and he will advise the Contractor, in writing, of his determination with
 reference to the specific type of work or service to be performed.

 If all costs and expenses incurred by the Department arising out of the breach and
 imposition of sanctions, together with the total cost to the Department of securing the
 performance of the work set forth in the contract, exceed the sum that would have been
 payable under the contract, the Contractor and the Surety shall be liable to the
 Department for such excess and shall pay such amount to the Department.

 The Engineer will exercise the powers and discretion vested in him by the contract in
 carrying out the terms of this article. He will have full power and authority to carry out
 any orders, directives, or resolutions issued by the Department in connection with
 a declaration of default. In the event that the Department fails to specify the sanctions to
 be imposed, the notice to be given or the method of completing the work, the Engineer
 may, at his discretion, impose such sanctions, give such notice and select such methods
 of completing the work, as are authorized by this article; and such actions shall have the
 same effect and validity as if taken pursuant to an express order, directive or resolution of
 the Department.

 No term or terms of this article and no action taken pursuant hereto by the Department of
 Transportation, its agents, or employees, will be construed to release or discharge the
 Contractor or the Surety upon the obligation set forth in the contract bonds, and the
 Contractor and the Surety shall remain bound thereon unto the Department until the work
 set forth in the contract has been completed and accepted by the Department and all
 obligations of the Contractor and the Surety arising under the contract and contract bond
 have been discharged.
 (G) Provision Not Exclusive
 
 33

 The provisions shall be in addition to and not in place of, any other provisions relating to
 default, breach of contract and sanctions to be imposed in connection therewith appearing
 in the contract.

 The contract time will be as defined in Section 101. No extensions to the completion
 date will be authorized except as allowed by this article. No modifications in the date of
 availability will be made for any reason whatsoever.
 
 41
 42
 43
 44
 
 Intermediate contract time, as defined in Section 101 will be that as allowed in the
 contract to complete a part, portion or phase of the total work covered in the contract.
 Intermediate completion dates and intermediate completion times set forth in the contract
 may be extended on the same basis as completion dates and as described in this article.
 
 45
 46
 
 When the liquidated damages stipulated in the contract are to be hourly, extensions, as
 described in this article, will be considered on an hourly basis.

 14
 
 (1) If the total dollar value of the final quantities adjusted as provided below, less the
 dollar value of quantities represented by supplemental agreements that previously
 extended the completion date, intermediate completion date or intermediate
 completion time, exceeds the dollar value of the total amount bid, the completion
 date, intermediate completion date, or intermediate completion time will be extended
 by the number of calendar days or hours obtained by multiplying the contract time
 (days), intermediate contract time (days), or intermediate contract time (hours) as set
 forth in the contract by that percentage that such reduced final dollar value exceeds
 the total amount bid. The total dollar value of the final quantities for pro-rata
 computations shall be adjusted by excluding the following:
 
 15
 
 (a) Unit bid price changes caused by price adjustments to asphalt cement,
 
 16
 
 (b) Fuel adjustments,
 
 17
 
 (c) Unit price reductions under Article 105-3,

 (2) If supplemental agreements covering the performance of extra work include
 provisions for an extension of the completion date, intermediate completion date, or
 intermediate completion time and the final dollar value of the extra work exceeds the
 estimated dollar value, the number of days or the number of hours by which the
 completion date, intermediate completion date or intermediate completion time was
 extended will be increased by the percentage that the final dollar value exceeds the
 estimated value.
 
 27
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 
 (3) If the Contractor's current controlling operation is delayed by circumstances
 originating from work required under the contract and beyond his control and
 without his fault or negligence, he may, at any time before payment of the final
 estimate, make a written request to the Engineer on the Contractor Claim Submittal
 Form, available through the Construction Unit, for an extension of the completion
 date, intermediate completion date, or intermediate completion time. This request
 shall include:
 
 34
 35
 
 (a) The circumstances resulting in the alleged delay and documentation of said
 circumstances as may be required by the Engineer,
 
 36
 
 (b) The controlling operation alleged to have been delayed,
 
 37
 38
 
 (c) The calendar dates or calendar dates and times on which the controlling
 operation was delayed and
 
 39
 40
 41
 
 (d) The number of calendar days or hours by which he is requesting the completion
 date, intermediate completion date, or intermediate completion time to be
 extended.
 
 42
 43
 44
 45
 46
 47
 48
 49
 
 If the Engineer determines that the controlling operation was delayed because of
 circumstances beyond the control of and without the fault or negligence of the
 Contractor, and that the Contractor has pursued the work in accordance with
 Article 108-1, he will extend the completion date, intermediate completion date, or
 intermediate completion time unless otherwise precluded by other provisions of the
 contract. No extension of the completion date, intermediate completion date, or
 intermediate completion time will be allowed for delays caused by restrictions,
 limitations or provisions contained in the contract.
 1-75
 
 Section 108

 Consideration will be given for an extension in the completion date, intermediate
 completion date, or intermediate completion time involving an intermediate contract
 time of more than 96 hours if the Contractor's current controlling operation(s) is
 delayed in excess of 40% of the total contract time (days), as defined in Section 101,
 excluding the time between December 15 and March 16; the total intermediate
 contract time (days), as defined in Section 101, excluding the time between
 December 15 and March 16; or the total intermediate contract time (hours), as
 defined in Section 101; due to weather or conditions resulting from weather. No
 other consideration will be given for extensions in the completion date, intermediate
 completion date, or intermediate completion time due to delays caused by weather.
 
 11
 12
 13
 
 Where the intermediate contract time is 96 hours or less, no consideration
 whatsoever will be given for an extension in the intermediate completion time due to
 weather or conditions resulting from weather.

 (4) If changes in the work from that originally contemplated in the contract are ordered
 by the Engineer and these changes result in reduction in quantities, elimination of
 items, additional work or extra work, the Engineer will allow an extension in the
 completion date, intermediate completion date, or intermediate completion time as
 he may deem warranted by such changes. Pursuit of the work with adequate forces
 and equipment and efficiency of the Contractor's operations will be considered by
 the Engineer in determining an extension in the completion date, intermediate
 completion date, or intermediate completion time. It is, however, the Contractor's
 responsibility to show just cause for an extension in the completion date,
 intermediate completion date, or intermediate completion time due to the aforesaid
 conditions. If the Contractor elects to file a written claim or requests an extension of
 contract time, it shall be submitted on the Contractor Claim Submittal Form available
 through the Construction Unit.

 (5) In the event accumulated authorized extensions in the completion date or
 intermediate completion date resulting from Subarticles 108-10(B)(1) through
 108-10(B)(4) above extend the completion date or intermediate completion date
 beyond December 15 following expiration of the completion date or intermediate
 completion date as established in the contract, the completion date will be further
 extended by the number of calendar days between December 15 of one year and
 March 16 of the following year. If any portion of such accumulated authorized
 extensions are for delays that occurred after the original contract time or intermediate
 contract time (days) expired and during the period between December 15 of one year
 and March 16 of the following year, this portion of the extension will be deducted
 from the number of additional calendar days awarded due to extension of the
 completion date or intermediate completion date beyond December 15.
 
 39
 40
 41
 42
 
 The Contractor's claim that insufficient contract time (days), intermediate contract
 time (days), or intermediate contract time (hours) was specified in the contract will
 not be considered as a valid reason for an extension in the completion date,
 intermediate completion date, or intermediate completion time.

 When all work on the project is totally complete, with the exception of an item or items on
 which work is precluded by seasonal limitations set forth in the contract, the Engineer may,
 provided that the Contractor has, as determined by the Engineer, diligently pursued the work
 with adequate forces and equipment, waive the assessment of liquidated damages during the
 period of time from the date all work other than that precluded by seasonal limitations was
 completed until the date of expiration of the seasonal limitations. The Contractor shall make
 the request to waive the assessment of liquidated damages in writing before the beginning
 date of the requested waiver. The non-assessment of liquidated damages during the aforesaid
 period shall not operate to waive any other liquidated damages that may be assessable, or any
 other terms of the contract.

 The parties acknowledge that time is of the essence for the performance of the work under the
 contract. Time is an essential element of the contract. Delay in completing the work will
 result in damages including but not limited to public inconvenience, obstruction to traffic,
 interference with business and the increasing of engineering, inspection and administrative
 costs to the Department. It is therefore agreed that in view of the difficulty of making a
 precise determination of such damages, a sum of money in the amount stipulated in the
 contract, will be charged against the Contractor for each calendar day, each hour, or portion
 thereof that the work, or any portion of the work as described in the contract, remains
 uncompleted after the expiration of the completion date, intermediate completion date, or
 intermediate completion time shown in the contract, not as a penalty but as liquidated
 damages.

 Should the Contractor or, in case of default, the Surety fail to complete the work or any
 portion of the work by any of the applicable completion dates, intermediate completion dates,
 or intermediate completion times shown in the contract, a deduction of the amount stipulated
 in the contract as liquidated damages will be made for each and every calendar day, for each
 and every hour, or portion thereof that the work or any portion of the work remains
 uncompleted after the expiration of any completion date, intermediate completion date, or
 intermediate completion time applicable to the uncompleted work. This amount will be
 deducted from any money due the Contractor or his Surety under the contract and the
 Contractor and his Surety will be liable for any liquidated damages in excess of the
 amount due.
 
 23
 24
 25
 
 In the event that the contract establishes one or more intermediate completion dates or times
 in addition to the completion date, each of the liquidated damages stipulated will be
 considered to be cumulative to any other liquidated damages stipulated.
 
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
 
 In case of Contractor default of the contract and the completion of the work by the
 Department, the Contractor and his Surety will be liable for the liquidated damages under the
 contract, but no liquidated damages will be chargeable for any delay in the final completion of
 the work by the Department due to any action, negligence, omission, or delay of the
 Department.
 
 31
 32
 33
 34
 
 In any suit for the collection of or involving the assessment of liquidated damages, the
 reasonableness of the amount stipulated in the contract will be presumed. The liquidated
 damages referred to herein are intended to be and are cumulative and will be in addition to
 every other remedy now or hereafter enforceable at law by statute or under the contract.
 
 35

 Permitting the Contractor to continue and finish the work or any part thereof after the
 expiration of the completion date, intermediate completion date, or intermediate completion
 time shall in no way operate as a waiver on the part of the Department of any of its rights
 under this contract.

 In accordance with Articles 108-10 and 108-11, when a contract is not completed by the
 completion date, intermediate completion date, or intermediate completion time, the
 Contractor shall be entitled to an extension of the completion date, intermediate completion
 date, or intermediate completion time and apportionment and remittance of liquidated
 damages to the extent that the failure to complete was due to the conditions set forth in
 Article 108-10. The Contractor, however, shall be entitled to an extension of the completion
 date, intermediate completion date, or intermediate completion time, or an apportionment and
 remittance of liquidated damages only to the extent and in the proportion that such delays
 were caused by the conditions set forth in Article 108-10, and it is understood that any
 extension granted shall not operate to waive any liquidated damages or any claim which the
 Department has or may have against the Contractor by reason of failure of the Contractor to

 All work completed under the contract will be measured by the Engineer according to United
 States standard measures unless otherwise stated in the contract.
 
 29
 30
 31
 
 The method of measurement and computations used in the determination of quantities of
 material furnished and of work performed under the contract will be those methods generally
 recognized as conforming to accepted engineering practice.
 
 32
 33
 
 The terms “gauge” and “thickness,” when used in connection with the measurement of plates,
 sheets and steel wire, shall be applied as follows:
 Item
 Uncoated Steel Sheets and Light Plates
 Galvanized Sheets
 Aluminum Sheets
 Steel Wire

 The Contractor shall receive and accept payment provided for in the contract as full payment
 for furnishing all materials and performing all work under the contract in a complete and
 acceptable manner and for all risk, loss, damage, or expense of whatever character arising out
 of the nature of the work or the prosecution thereof, subject to the requirements of
 Article 107-20. Payment to the Contractor will be made only for the actual quantities of the
 various items that are completed and accepted in accordance with the terms of the contract.
 
 16
 17
 18
 19
 20
 
 If the Measurement and Payment clause in the specifications relating to any unit price or lump
 sum price in the bid schedule requires that the said unit price or lump sum price cover and be
 considered compensation for certain work or material essential to the item, this same work or
 material will not be measured or paid under any other pay item that may appear elsewhere in
 the contract.
 
 21
 
 109-3
 
 22
 23
 24
 
 All force account work shall be performed as directed by the Engineer including the numbers
 and types of equipment, the numbers and classifications of labor and foremen and material
 requirements.

 (A) Labor
 
 FORCE ACCOUNT WORK
 
 27
 28
 29
 30
 
 For all authorized labor and foremen in direct charge of the specific operations, the
 Contractor will receive the rate of base (actual) wages (or scale) actually being paid by
 the contractor for each hour that the labor and foremen are actually engaged in the
 specific force account work.
 
 31

 In addition to reimbursement for each hour that the labor and foremen are actually
 engaged in the specific force account work, the Contractor may receive compensation for
 travel time to and from the project if and only if the labor and foremen needed are outside
 a 75 mile radius as included in Subarticle 109-3(B). The base location will be established
 and approved by the Engineer before performing the specific force account work. If the
 approved labor and foremen travel to another project upon completion of the specific
 force account work, payment for travel time may not exceed the travel time that would
 have been required to return to the point of origin in accordance with
 Subarticle 109-3(B). When travel time is approved by the Engineer, it shall be included
 in the total hours approved and worked for that specific week. The Engineer will approve
 the mode of travel.

 Payment for overtime will be allowed when approved by the Engineer before performing
 the specific force account work. Overtime for labor and foremen will be paid based on
 the company’s policy for overtime payment. Verification of such payment will be
 tracked by submission of weekly payrolls as required on federal projects and as requested
 on all other projects. Failure to submit payrolls as required or requested shall act as a bar
 to the Contractor for payment of overtime for labor and foremen. If the labor or foremen
 is employed partly on specific force account work and partly on other work, the amount
 of overtime to be reimbursed will be prorated based upon the number of hours worked on
 the specific force account work during the payroll period.

 An additive amount equal to the Contractor’s actual labor burden rate, up to a maximum
 of 60%, will be paid to the Contractor for all base (actual) wages paid to labor and
 foremen for the specific force account work. No additive will be provided for overtime
 payments. The labor burden rates will include costs associated with the employee’s
 actual base wages benefits, including Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA),
 unemployment contributions, Social Security and Medicare taxes and company fringe
 benefits. Company fringe benefits are the actual costs paid to, or on behalf of, workers
 by reason of health and welfare benefits, pension fund benefits, or other benefits, when
 such amounts are required by prevailing wage laws generally applicable to the classes of
 labor employed on the work. The Contractor’s actual labor burden rates will be
 submitted to and approved by the Engineer before beginning the work. When the
 Contractor cannot verify actual labor burden rates, an amount equal to 35% of the total
 base (actual) wage paid labor and foremen will be added to the total base wages paid to
 the Contractor. These percentage additives will be full compensation for overhead,
 benefits, contingencies and all other costs associated with labor for the specific force
 account work.

 The Contractor may receive payment for actual costs paid to, or on behalf of, labor and
 foremen by reason of subsistence and travel allowances under certain circumstances.
 When the Contractor is required to mobilize a crew for specific operations, the Engineer
 may approve reimbursement of subsistence, including meals and overnight lodging, if the
 specific force account work is determined to be outside of the scope of the original
 contract and the distance from the Contractor’s base location to the project is more than
 75 miles. Should the Contractor use forces currently working at the location of the
 specific force account work, the Engineer may approve the payment of subsistence,
 including meals and overnight lodging, if the work is determined to be outside of the
 scope of the original contract, the forces currently working at the location has routinely
 stayed overnight during the life of the project, and the distance from the Contractor’s
 base location to the project is more than 75 miles. The Engineer will approve the mode
 of travel.

 foremen in direct charge of the specific operations. Subsistence will be limited to the
 lesser of actual amount paid or the current maximum in-state rate for State employees.
 Verification of such costs paid to, or on behalf of, labor and foremen will be submitted to
 the Engineer. If the labor or foremen are partly employed on specific force account work
 and partly on other work, the amount of subsistence to be reimbursed will be prorated
 based upon the number of hours worked on the specific force account work during the
 payroll period.

 Contractors at all levels, prime, subcontractor, or lower tier subcontractor, shall within
 seven calendar days of receipt of monies, resulting from the satisfactory completion of
 work performed, pay subcontractors, all lower tier subcontractors, or material suppliers.
 This seven-day period begins upon knowledgeable receipt by the contracting firm
 obligated to make a subsequent periodic or final payment. This prompt payment
 requirement will be met if each firm mails the payment to the next level firm by evidence
 of postmark within the seven-day period. For the purposes of this section, the
 satisfactory completion of work performed shall exist when a subcontractor, a lower tier
 subcontractor or material supplier completes tasks called for in the subcontract and are in
 conformance with the terms of the Contract as required by the Department. This
 specification for prompt payment shall be incorporated into each subcontract or lower tier
 subcontract issued for work performed on the project or for services provided.

 The Contractor shall not withhold any payments to a subcontractor, lower tier
 subcontractor or material supplier for any claim or action arising outside the current
 contract with the Department. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the
 Contractor may withhold up to 3% retainage if any subcontractor does not obtain
 a payment and performance bond for their portion of the work. Additionally, this
 retainage may be increased to a maximum of 10% where the Contractor and any
 subcontractor have supplied to the Engineer a satisfactorily executed mutual agreement
 for an increased amount. If any retainage is held on subcontractors, all retainage shall be
 released within seven calendar days of satisfactory completion of all work. For release of
 retainage, satisfactory completion is defined as completion of all physical elements and
 corresponding documentation as defined in the subcontract, as well as agreement between
 the parties as to the final quantities for all work performed in the subcontract. The
 Department will provide internal controls to expedite the determination and processing of
 the final quantities for the satisfactorily completed subcontract portions of the project.

 contract unit price, as applicable, when a price adjustment or pay factor is provided for by the
 contract or as determined by the Engineer in accordance with Article 105-3. In addition to the
 compensation made at the unit or lump sum price, adjustment in compensation will be made
 in accordance with Article 109-8. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed
 for which there is not a contract price, nor shall the Contractor receive additional
 compensation over and above the contract price for work performed or for extra work
 performed, except for work performed pursuant to an executed supplemental agreement or

 Fuel price adjustments will be made to the payments due the Contractor for contract items
 specified in the contract, or for extra work items specified in the supplemental agreement,
 when the average terminal price has fluctuated from the Base Index Price contained in the
 contract. The average terminal price is the average of the Freight on Board (F.O.B.) price for
 diesel fuel at the terminals in Charlotte, Wilmington and Selma, North Carolina. When the
 average terminal price fluctuates upward or downward from the Base Index Price, an amount
 will be added to or deducted from the monies due the Contractor as follows.

 The current quantity for the specified contract items for which partial payment is made will be
 multiplied by the respective Diesel Fuel Usage Factor contained in the contract to determine
 the theoretical diesel fuel usage for each specified contract item. The sum of the theoretical
 diesel fuel usage for all specified contract items will be multiplied by the algebraic difference
 between the average F.O.B. price for diesel fuel at the above specified terminals and the Base
 Index Price contained in the contract to determine the fuel price adjustment to be made on the
 partial payment estimate.

 The Engineer's estimate of quantities for contract items measured by cross sections shall be
 used on the various partial payment estimates to determine fuel price adjustments. When the
 Engineer determines after payment for all or a portion of such contract item that is subject to
 a fuel price adjustment that the total quantity of work paid to date will be adjusted to reflect
 more accurate quantity determinations, the Engineer will make a pro rata increase or decrease
 in the fuel price adjustment proportionate to the adjustment in the total quantity of work paid.
 The prorated fuel price adjustment for the contract item will be determined by multiplying the
 cumulative fuel price adjustment made for that contract item for the previous estimate period
 by the adjusted quantity for that contract item and divided by the total quantity of work paid
 for the previous estimates for the contract item. Payment for the prorated fuel price
 adjustment will be made accordingly on the partial payment estimate that includes the
 adjustment in the quantity of work paid.

 The Blaster-in-Charge has authority over the handling, use and security of explosives and is
 responsible for designing, planning, coordinating, supervising and monitoring blasting.
 Assign a Blaster-in-Charge to the project that has at least 5 years of experience with blasting
 similar to that anticipated for the project. Use a Blaster-in-Charge approved as a Blaster-inCharge (key person) for the Blasting Contractor. The Blaster-in-Charge or designated
 Assistant Blaster-in-Charge shall be on site during blasting.

 When blasts will be within 1,000 feet of a utility, house, residence, building, business or any
 other structure, a blasting plan and blast monitoring that meet Subarticles 220-3(B)
 and 220-3(C) are required. Otherwise, provide a blasting plan and monitor blasts as needed.
 
 10
 
 (A) Vibration and Air Overpressure Limits
 
 11
 12
 13
 14
 15
 
 Define “peak particle velocity” (PPV) as the maximum ground vibration velocity
 measured in any direction. Design blasts so the PPV at any utility or structure does not
 exceed the “Alternative Blasting Level Criteria” from Appendix B of the U.S. Bureau of
 Mines Report of Investigations 8507. Design blasts so the maximum air overpressure at
 any structure does not exceed 133 dB (linear).
 
 16
 17
 18
 19
 20
 
 If the PPV or air overpressure limits are exceeded at any utility or structure in any
 direction from blasts, the Engineer may suspend blasting until the post-blast report is
 reviewed and a new or revised blasting plan is accepted. Unless required otherwise in the
 contract or directed, design production, pre-split and trench blasts in accordance with the
 following:
 
 21
 
 (1) Production Blasting
 
 22
 23
 24
 
 (a) For 1.5:1 (H:V) rock cut slopes without pre-splitting, do not use production blast
 holes more than 4 inches in diameter within 10 feet of finished slope faces or
 neat lines.
 
 25
 
 (b) Do not drill production holes below bottom of adjacent pre-split blast holes
 
 26
 
 (c) Use delay blasting to detonate production blast holes towards a free face
 
 27
 
 (2) Pre-splitting
 
 28
 
 (a) Do not use pre-split blast holes more than 3 inches in diameter
 
 29
 30
 31
 
 (b) Space pre-split holes no more than 10 hole diameters apart (wider pre-split blast
 hole spacing may be approved by the Engineer if test blast results are
 satisfactory)
 
 32
 
 (c) Limit subdrilling to the offset width between lifts
 
 33
 
 (d) Do not subdrill more than 2 feet below finished grade
 
 34
 35
 
 (e) Pre-split rock at least 30 feet beyond production blasting lifts or to the end of
 rock cuts
 
 36
 
 (f) Provide benches or lifts with a maximum height of 25 feet.
 
 37
 
 (g) Do not use ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) or other bulk loaded products
 
 38
 
 (h) Use cartridge explosives or other explosive types design for pre-splitting
 
 39
 40
 
 (i) Use charges with a maximum diameter of half the pre-split blast hole diameter
 except for charges in bottom 2 feet holes
 
 41
 42
 
 (j) If pre-split and production blast holes are fired in the same blast, fire pre-split
 holes at least 25 milliseconds before production holes

 When required, submit the proposed blasting plan signed by the Blaster-in-Charge for all
 blasting for acceptance. Acceptance of this plan does not relieve the Contractor of
 responsibility and liability for blasting in accordance with the contract.
 
 5
 6
 7
 8
 
 Submit the blasting plan to the Resident Engineer and the appropriate Geotechnical
 Engineering Unit regional office at least 30 days before starting blasting. Do not deliver
 explosives to the project site or begin blasting until a blasting plan is accepted. Provide
 detailed project specific information in the blasting plan that includes the following:
 
 9
 10
 
 (1) Work procedures and safety precautions for storage, transportation, handling and
 detonation of explosives;
 
 11
 12
 
 (2) Explosive products and devices for dry and wet blast holes including explosives,
 primers and detonators with MSDS;
 
 13
 
 (3) Drilling equipment including methods for maintaining blast hole alignment;
 
 14
 15
 16
 
 (4) Typical plan, profile and sectional views for blasting showing blasting limits, blast
 hole diameters, depths, inclinations and spacing, burden, subdrill depths and
 minimum and maximum charge per delay;
 
 17
 
 (5) Initiation and delay methods and delay times;
 
 18
 19
 
 (6) Equipment and procedures for blast monitoring with calibration certificates dated
 within one year of submittal date; and
 
 20
 
 (7) Post-blast report format.
 
 21
 22
 23
 
 If alternate blasting procedures are proposed or necessary, a revised blasting plan
 submittal may be required. If blasting deviates from the accepted submittal without prior
 approval, the Engineer may suspend blasting until a revised plan is accepted.
 
 24
 
 (C) Blast Monitoring
 
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
 
 If necessary or required, monitor blasts using seismographs capable of measuring air
 overpressure and vibration in the vertical, longitudinal and transverse directions. At
 a minimum, monitor vibration and air overpressure at the closest utility or structure to
 each blast and the closest utility or structure in the direction of each blast in accordance
 with the accepted blasting plan. Include the following in post-blast reports for each blast
 monitoring location:
 
 31
 
 (1) Type, identification and specific location of seismograph,
 
 32
 
 (2) Distance and direction from blast,
 
 33
 
 (3) PPV in each direction and peak vector sum, and
 
 34
 
 (4) Maximum air overpressure level.
 
 35
 
 (D) Blasting Requirements
 
 36
 37
 38
 39
 40
 
 Before beginning drilling, a pre-blast meeting may be required to discuss the blasting and
 if applicable, blast monitoring. Schedule this meeting after any blast plans have been
 accepted. The Resident or District Engineer, Roadway Construction Engineer,
 Geotechnical Operations Engineer, Contractor and Blaster-in-Charge will attend this preblast meeting.
 
 41
 42
 43
 44
 
 Drill and blast in accordance with the contract and if applicable, the accepted blast plan.
 Use explosives in accordance with all applicable government regulations, professional
 society standards and manufacturer guidelines and recommendations. Do not allow
 ANFO to leach into bodies of water.

 Before blasting for excavations, remove all overburden material along top of excavations
 for at least 30 feet beyond blasting or rock limits, whichever is less. Inspect any free
 faces to ensure adequate burden. Drill blast holes within 3 inches of plan location and
 maintain hole alignment when drilling.
 
 5
 6
 7
 8

 10
 11
 
 Pre-split rock cuts as required so irregularities between pre-split blast holes are less than
 1 foot from finished slope faces. Alignment is crucial for pre-split holes. Maintain presplit hole alignment within 6 inches of rock cut slopes and parallel to adjacent pre-split
 blast holes. Monitor and accurately measure pre-split hole alignment during drilling with
 a method acceptable to the Engineer. When rock cut heights require multiple benches or
 lifts, offset pre-split blast holes horizontally for each lift no more than the clearance
 necessary for drilling equipment.
 
 12
 13
 14
 15
 16
 
 Cover blast holes after drilling to prevent unwanted backfill and identify and mark each
 blast hole with hole number and depth. Blast holes shall be free of obstructions the entire
 depth. Load blast holes without dislodging material or caving in hole walls. Stem blast
 holes 5 inches or larger in diameter with No. 67 stone and blast holes smaller than
 5 inches in diameter with No. 78M stone. Do not stem blast holes with drill cuttings.
 
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 
 Contain flyrock within construction limits. Use matting when blast monitoring or traffic
 control is required. Soil cover may be used instead of matting, if approved. If flyrock
 occurs outside the construction limits, the Engineer may suspend blasting until the postblast report is reviewed and a new or revised blasting plan is accepted. When traffic
 control is required for blasting, have equipment standing by to remove material that
 interferes with traffic flow. Check for misfires immediately after each blast before
 signaling all clear.
 
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 
 Remove all loose, hanging and potentially dangerous material from rock cut slopes by
 scaling. The Contractor is responsible for the stability of rock cuts. If rock cuts are
 damaged during blasting, stabilize cuts to the satisfaction of the Engineer. Resume
 drilling only after scaling is complete. Adjust blast hole alignments to account for any
 drift occurring in preceding drilling or lifts.
 
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 
 Define “secondary blasting” as blasting to reduce the size of naturally occurring boulders
 or those resulting from initial blasting. Use an approved method for secondary blasting
 consisting of small explosive charges in small diameter blast holes.
 Define
 “mudcapping” as placing unconfined explosive charges in contact with rock without blast
 holes and covering charges with mud. Do not use mudcapping for blasting.
 
 34
 
 (E) Post-Blast Report
 
 35
 36
 37
 
 Submit a post-blast report within 3 days of each blast or before the next blast, whichever
 is sooner. Provide post-blast reports signed by the Blaster-in-Charge that include the
 following:
 
 38
 39
 
 (1) Material data information about explosive products and devices including
 explosives, primers and detonators;
 
 40
 41
 42
 43
 
 (2) Scaled blast drawings with cross sections showing blasting limits, blast hole
 diameters, depths, inclinations and spacing, burden, subdrill depth, free face location
 and any joints, bedding planes, weathered zones, voids or other significant rock
 structure information;
 
 44
 45
 
 (3) Loading pattern diagram with location and amount of each type of explosive
 including primers and detonators;
 
 46
 47
 
 (4) Locations and depths of stemming, column heights and maximum charge per delay
 for each type of loading;
 
 48
 
 (5) Delay and initiation diagram showing delay pattern, sequence and times;

 When the Engineer determines that the finished graded roadway cross section contains
 materials that are undesirable in their location or condition, the Engineer may require the
 Contractor to remove the materials and backfill with approved, properly compacted material
 to the finished graded section.
 
 39
 40
 41
 
 Where undercutting is required adjacent to or beneath the location of the proposed drainage
 structure, perform undercut and backfill a sufficient distance adjacent to the installation to
 prevent future operations from disturbing the completed drainage structure.
 
 42
 43
 44
 
 Use equipment in undercutting and backfilling operations of such weight, size and capability
 to efficiently remove and replace the material within the limits established. Use equipment of
 a size and weight that will not displace the underlying or adjacent material.
 
 45
 46
 47
 
 All material removed in the work of undercut excavation will be classified by the Engineer as
 either suitable for other use without excessive manipulation and used elsewhere in the work,
 or unsuitable for further use and disposed of by the Contractor.

 Thoroughly clear and grub and clean the surface of the borrow area of all unsuitable
 material before beginning the excavation and, where applicable, before cross sections are
 taken. Dispose of material resulting from clearing and grubbing in accordance with
 Article 200-6. Remove and dispose of overburden in accordance with Section 802.
 
 7
 8
 9
 
 Do not accumulate exposed, erodible slope area in each borrow operation in excess of
 1 acre at any one time without beginning permanent seeding and mulching of the borrow
 source or installing other erosion control measures as may be approved.
 
 10
 11
 12
 13
 14
 
 Remove and stockpile topsoil at locations that will not interfere with the borrow
 operations and that meet the approval of the Engineer. Install temporary erosion control
 measures as needed to prevent the erosion of the stockpile material. Once all borrow has
 been removed from the source or portion thereof, uniformly spread the stockpiled topsoil
 over the area and permanently seed and mulch the area.
 
 15
 16
 17
 18
 
 Where payment is made by cross section, notify the Engineer sufficiently before
 beginning excavation of the borrow material so that the area may be staked and
 cross sectioned. Excavate the material to the lines and slopes as staked in an orderly
 manner to facilitate measurement at any time.
 
 19
 20
 
 Where payment is to be made by truck measurement, furnish trucks with bodies suitable
 for accurate measurement. Load trucks uniformly and load to prevent spillage.
 
 21
 22
 23
 24
 
 When necessary to haul borrow material over existing roads or streets, comply with
 Article 105-15. Use all necessary precautions to prevent damage to the existing
 structures or pavement. Conduct hauling operations so as to not interfere with the normal
 flow of traffic and keep the traffic lanes free from spillage at all times.
 
 25
 
 Furnish borrow sources except where otherwise indicated in the contract.

 (B) Contractor Furnished Sources
 
 27
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 
 Before the approval of any borrow sources developed for use on any project, obtain
 certification from the State Historic Preservation Officer of the State Department of
 Cultural Resources certifying that the removal of the borrow material from the borrow
 sources will have no effect on any known district, site building, structure or object,
 architectural and/or archaeological that is included or eligible for inclusion in the
 National Register of Historic Places. Furnish a copy of this certification to the Engineer
 before performing any work on the proposed borrow source.
 
 34
 35
 36
 37
 38
 
 Borrow sources will not be allowed in any area under the Corps of Engineers regulatory
 jurisdiction until the Contractor has obtained a permit for such borrow sources from the
 Corps District Engineer having jurisdiction and has furnished a copy of this permit to the
 Engineer. Requests for additional contract time, additional compensation or for work
 stoppage due to permit violations will not be considered.

 Except where borrow is to be obtained from a commercial source, jointly submit
 with the property owner a borrow source development, use and reclamation plan to
 the Engineer for his approval before engaging in any land disturbing activity on the
 proposed source other than material sampling that may be necessary. The
 Department’s borrow and waste site reclamation procedures for contracted projects
 is available on the website and shall be used for all borrow and waste sites on this
 project. Address the following in the plan:
 
 15
 
 (a) Topography
 
 16

 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 25
 26
 
 Detail the existing topography and locations of the proposed access and egress
 haul roads. Detail the proposed final topography of the waste or disposal area
 showing any proposed drainage systems. Excavate the source according to the
 plan and dress and shape it in a continuous manner to contours that are
 comparable to and blend in with the adjacent topography. Grade the source to
 drain such that no water will collect or stand. Provide a functioning drainage
 system for the source. If drainage is not practical and the source is to serve as
 a pond, the minimum depth shall be a least 4 feet as determined from the water
 table at the time the reclamation plan is executed. The slope of the soil below
 the water shall be between 5:1 and 2:1. The slope of the sides above the water
 line shall be 2:1 or flatter.
 
 27
 
 (b) Erosion Control
 
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 34
 35
 
 Detail the temporary and permanent erosion control measures, along with design
 calculations, that are intended during use of the site and as part of the
 reclamation. Unless considered impractical due to special circumstances,
 provide in the plan for the use of staged permanent seeding and mulching and
 appropriate fertilizer topdressing continually during site use and the immediate
 total reclamation of the site when the site is no longer needed. Define the seed
 mixture proposed for establishing temporary and permanent vegetation.
 Establish permanent stand of vegetation before acceptance of the project.

 Allocate sufficient area between the nearest property line and the tie-in of the
 slope to natural ground to allow for the operation of excavation, hauling and
 seeding equipment and for the installation of any and all erosion control devices
 required. Leave additional undisturbed area between the source and any water
 course or body to prevent siltation of the water course or body and the
 movement of the shore line either into the water course or body or into the waste
 areas. Determine if the adjoining property owners or other government agencies
 require any additional buffer zones and comply with those requirements.
 Suggested minimum distances are 10 feet from property lines and 50 feet from
 water bodies or water courses. Where it is necessary to drain the borrow source,
 perform work in accordance with Section 240.

 Take care during backfill and compaction operations to maintain alignment and prevent
 damage to the joints. Keep backfill free from stones, frozen lumps, chunks of highly plastic
 clay or other objectionable material.
 
 35
 36
 
 Grade and maintain all pipe backfill areas in such a condition that erosion or saturation will
 not damage the pipe foundation or backfill.
 
 37

 COFFERDAMS
 
 The term cofferdam designates any temporary or removable structure constructed to hold
 the surrounding earth, water or both, out of the excavation. It includes timber cribs, any
 type of sheet piling, removable steel shells or similar structures, all necessary bracing and
 the use of pumping wells or well points for the same purpose. Ensure cofferdams located
 in bodies of water are designed, detailed and sealed by an engineer licensed by the State of
 North Carolina when the distance from the water surface to the bottom of the excavation
 is 5 feet or greater.

 Design and construct cofferdams to adequate depths and heights, safely and as watertight
 as is necessary for the proper performance of the work. Provide interior dimensions of
 cofferdams as to give sufficient clearance for the construction and inspection of forms and
 to permit pumping outside the forms. Provide at least 5 feet of clearance between the
 proposed edge of footing and inside face of cofferdam when a keyed footing is required
 and at least 3 feet when a keyed footing is not required. Right, rest or enlarge cofferdams
 that are tilted or moved laterally during the process of sinking to provide the necessary
 clearance.
 
 44

 When the contract calls for payment of Foundation Excavation on a cubic yard basis, it
 will be measured and paid as the actual number of cubic yards of materials, measured in
 their original position within the limits described below and computed by the average end
 area method, that are acceptably excavated.
 
 31
 32
 33
 34
 35
 36
 
 The upper limits for measurement are the actual ground surface at the time of starting work,
 except where the excavation is performed in cut areas excavated under Section 225, the
 upper limits are the roadway plan typical section. For keyed footings the upper limits of
 the keyed section are as shown in the plans. Define a “keyed footing” as a footing placed
 without forms for the keyed depth in an excavation whose sides, as near as practical, are
 located at the neat line dimensions of the footing and are vertical.
 
 37
 38
 39
 40
 
 When the foundation material is other than rock, the lower limits for measurement are the
 elevation of the bottom of footing as established by the plans or as directed. When the
 foundation material is rock, the lower limits for measurement are the actual rock elevations
 after the foundation is approved.
 
 41
 42
 43
 44
 
 As an exception to the lower limits established above, when in the opinion of the Engineer
 excess excavation is performed due to carelessness or negligence on the part of the
 Contractor, the Engineer notifies the Contractor of that portion of the excavation which is
 not measured for payment.
 
 45

 (B) Preconstruction Meeting
 Before starting drilled pier construction, hold a preconstruction meeting to discuss the
 installation, monitoring and inspection of the drilled piers. Schedule this meeting after the
 Drilled Pier Contractor mobilizes to the site. If this meeting occurs before all drilled pier
 submittals have been accepted, additional preconstruction meetings may be required before
 beginning construction of drilled piers without accepted submittals. The Resident or Bridge

 CONSTRUCTION METHODS
 
 34
 35
 
 Do not excavate holes, install piles or allow equipment loads or vibrations within 20 feet of
 completed piers until 16 hours after drilled pier concrete reaches initial set.
 
 36
 37
 
 When drilling from a barge, use a fixed template that maintains hole position and alignment
 during drilled pier construction. Do not use floating templates or templates attached to barges.
 
 38
 39
 
 Check for correct drilled pier alignment and location before beginning drilling.
 plumbness of Kelly bars before beginning and frequently during drilling.
 
 40
 41
 42
 43
 
 For drilled piers constructed with slurry or permanent casings, the pier diameter may be 2 inches
 less than the design pier diameter shown in the plans. For all other drilled piers, construct piers
 with the minimum required diameters shown in the plans except for portions of drilled piers in
 rock with may be 2 inches less than the design pier diameter.
 
 44
 45
 46
 
 Install drilled piers with tip elevations no higher than shown in the plans or approved by the
 Engineer. Provide piers with the minimum required tip resistance and, when noted in the plans,
 penetration into rock.

 Excavate holes with equipment of the sizes required to construct drilled piers. Use
 equipment and methods accepted in the drilled pier construction plan or approved by the
 Engineer. Inform the Engineer of any deviations from the accepted plan.
 
 5
 6
 7
 8
 
 Use drill rigs with sufficient capacity to drill through soil, rock, boulders, timbers, manmade objects and any other materials encountered and drill 20 feet deeper or 20% longer
 than the maximum drilled pier length shown in the plans, whichever is greater. Drilling
 below pier tip elevations shown in the plans may be required to attain sufficient resistance.
 
 9
 10
 11
 12
 13
 14
 
 Do not use blasting to advance drilled pier excavations. Blasting for core removal is only
 permitted when approved by the Engineer. See Articles 107-11 and 107-12 for protection
 of public and private property and control of siltation, dust and air and water pollution from
 blasting, drilling and excavating with down-the-hole hammers. Contain and dispose of
 drilling spoils and waste concrete as directed and in accordance with Section 802. Drilling
 spoils consist of all materials and fluids removed from excavations.
 
 15
 16
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 
 Stabilize excavations with only casings or slurry and casings except, as approved by the
 Engineer, portions of excavations in rock. Use casings or slurry in rock if unstable material
 is anticipated or encountered. Stabilize excavations from beginning of drilling through
 concrete placement. If excavations become unstable, the Engineer may suspend drilling
 and require a revised drilled pier construction plan. If it becomes necessary to replace a
 casing during drilling, backfill the excavation, insert a larger casing around the casing to
 be replaced or stabilize the excavation with slurry before removing the casing.
 
 22
 23
 
 When noted in the plans, do not dewater drilled pier excavations. Otherwise, if excavations
 are in rock, dewater excavations to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 
 24
 
 (B) Casings
 
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 
 Provide temporary casings to stabilize holes and protect personnel entering excavations.
 Permanent casings may be required as noted in the plans. Install permanent casings with
 tip elevations no deeper than shown in the plans or approved by the Engineer. Additional
 drilled pier length and reinforcing steel may be required if permanent casings are installed
 below elevations noted in the plans.
 
 30
 31
 32
 33
 
 Install casings in continuous sections. Overlap telescoping casings at least 24 inches.
 Remove portions of permanent casings above the ground line or top of piers, whichever is
 higher, after placing concrete. Do not cut off permanent casings until Drilled Pier concrete
 attains a compressive strength of at least 3,000 psi.
 
 34
 35
 36
 
 When using slurry construction without permanent casings, temporary casings at least
 10 feet long are required at top of excavations. Maintain top of casings at least 12 inches
 above the ground line.
 
 37
 
 (C) Slurry Construction
 
 38
 39
 
 Unless noted otherwise in the plans, slurry construction or polymer slurry is at the
 Contractor’s option.
 
 40
 41
 42
 43
 44
 
 Use slurry and additives to stabilize holes in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 recommendations. Provide a technical representative employed by the slurry manufacturer
 to assist and guide the Drilled Pier Contractor onsite during the construction of the first
 drilled pier. If problems are encountered during drilled pier construction, the Engineer may
 require the technical representative to return to the site.
 
 45
 46
 47
 48
 
 Provide documentation that mixing water is suitable for slurry. Use slurry equipment that
 is sufficient for mixing, agitating, circulating and storing slurry. Thoroughly premix slurry
 with water in tanks before pumping into excavations. Allow bentonite slurry to hydrate at
 least 24 hours in tanks before use.
 4-12
 
 Section 411
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 
 Pump slurry into excavations before encountering water. Maintain slurry level at least
 5 feet or one pier diameter, whichever is greater, above the highest piezometric head along
 the drilled pier length. The highest piezometric head is anticipated to be the static water or
 groundwater elevation. However, the Drilled Pier Contractor is responsible for
 determining the highest piezometric head for each pier.
 
 6
 7

 Maintain the required slurry properties at all times except for sand content. Desand or
 replace slurry as needed to meet the required sand content in tanks before pumping slurry
 into excavations and in excavations immediately before placing concrete.

 (1) Time
 
 10
 11
 12
 13
 
 Agitate bentonite slurry in holes at least every 4 hours. If this 4-hour time limit is
 exceeded, the Engineer may require holes to be overreamed at least 1 inch and no more
 than 3 inches below casings. Overream holes with grooving tools, overreaming
 buckets or other approved methods.
 
 14
 15
 16
 17
 18
 19
 
 Construct drilled piers so the maximum time slurry is in contact with uncased portions
 of holes from drilling through concrete placement does not exceed 36 hours. If this
 36 hour time limit is exceeded, the Engineer may require the hole diameter to be
 enlarged at least 6 inches. If the enlarged hole diameter is greater than the permanent
 casing diameter, replace casing with a larger permanent casing with an outside
 diameter equal to the diameter of the enlarged hole.
 
 20
 
 (2) Slurry Testing
 
 21
 22
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 
 Define a “sample set” as slurry samples collected from mid-height and within 2 feet
 of the bottom of slurry tanks or holes. Take a sample set from slurry tanks to test
 slurry before beginning drilling. Do not pump slurry into excavations until both slurry
 samples from tanks meet the required slurry properties. Take sample sets from
 excavations to test slurry at least every 4 hours and immediately before placing
 concrete. Do not place Drilled Pier concrete until both slurry samples from
 an excavation meet the required slurry properties. If any slurry test results do not meet
 the requirements, the Engineer may suspend drilling until both samples from a sample
 set meet the required slurry properties.
 
 30
 31
 
 Sign, date and submit slurry test reports upon completion of each pier.
 Department reserves the right to perform comparison slurry tests at any time.
 
 32

 The
 
 (3) Disposal
 Comply with all Federal, State and local regulations, as well as the project permits and
 commitments, when disposing of slurry and drilling spoils mixed with slurry. Contain
 slurry and drilling spoils and keep out of water at all times.
 (D) Cleaning and Inspection
 
 37
 38
 39
 40
 41
 
 Provide clean holes with level bottoms so elevations within bottom of holes do not vary by
 more than 12 inches. Remove soft and loose material from bottom of holes using methods
 accepted in the drilled pier construction plan or approved by the Engineer. When bottom
 of holes are not hand cleaned, remove sediment from holes with cleanout buckets, air lifts
 or pumps.
 
 42
 43
 44
 45
 
 After cleaning is complete, provide all equipment, personnel and assistance required for
 the Engineer to visually inspect holes from above or by entering excavations. Remove all
 cleaning and drilling equipment from holes during inspections and do not interfere with
 inspections.
 
 4-13
 
 Section 411
 1
 
 (1) Tip Resistance
 
 2
 3
 4
 5
 
 If the Engineer determines that the material below an excavation does not provide the
 minimum required tip resistance, increase the drilled pier length and lengthen
 reinforcing steel as directed. One of the following methods may be required to check
 the conditions and continuity of material below excavations.
 
 6
 
 (a) Test Hole
 
 7
 8
 
 If excavations are in rock, drill a 1.5 inch diameter test hole at least 6 feet below
 bottom of holes for the Engineer to determine the continuity of rock below holes.
 
 9
 
 (b) Standard Penetration Test
 
 10
 11
 12
 13
 14
 15
 16
 
 Standard penetration tests (SPT) may be required as noted in the plans. When
 required, drive a split-barrel sampler 18 inches below bottom of holes or to refusal
 in accordance with ASTM D1586. Perform SPT in holes at least 12 inches away
 from casing walls and support drill rods so rods remain vertical and straight.
 Report the number of blows applied in each 6 inch increment and provide
 recovered samples to the Engineer. The Engineer will determine the standard
 penetration resistance required.
 
 17
 
 (2) Bottom Cleanliness
 
 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 
 Holes are clean if at least 50% of bottom of holes has less than 0.5 inch of sediment
 and no portions of bottom of holes have more than 1.5 inches of sediment. If bottom
 of holes does not meet this cleanliness criteria, remove sediment from holes until the
 Engineer determines holes are clean. One or more of the following methods may be
 required to inspect the bottom cleanliness of holes.
 
 23
 
 (a) Steel Probe
 
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 
 If drilled pier excavations are not dewatered or as directed, provide a #10 rebar
 steel probe that is 24 inches long with a flat tip on one end and a non-stretch cable
 connected to the other end. Provide a cable long enough to lower the steel probe
 to the bottom of holes for the Engineer to determine the amount of sediment in
 holes.
 
 29
 
 (b) Shaft Inspection Device
 
 30
 31
 32
 
 The Engineer may use the shaft inspection device (SID) as noted in the plans. The
 Engineer provides the SID and personnel to operate it. Notify the Engineer at
 least 2 days before finishing holes that will be inspected with the SID.
 
 33
 34
 35
 36
 37
 
 Assist the Engineer in handling the SID and associated equipment and supporting
 the SID during inspections. Provide working areas large enough for the SID,
 associated equipment and SID personnel within reach of the SID cables and clear
 view of holes being inspected. If necessary, provide a secure location to store the
 SID and associated equipment onsite overnight.
 
 38
 39
 40
 
 Approximately one hour is required to inspect a hole with the SID after the SID
 and associated equipment are set up. The Engineer will use the SID to measure
 the amount of sediment at 5 locations around the bottom of holes.
 
 41
 
 (E) Reinforcing Steel and Concrete
 
 42
 43
 44
 45
 46
 47
 
 Assemble rebar cages consisting of bar and spiral reinforcing steel shown in the plans.
 Securely cross tie reinforcing steel at each intersection with double wire. Attach a chair
 under each reinforcing bar and rollers near the top and bottom of rebar cages and every
 10 feet along cages in between. The number of rollers required at each location along rebar
 cages is one roller per foot of design pier diameter with at least 4 rollers per location. Space
 rollers equally around rebar cages at each location. Attach rollers so rollers are supported
 4-14
 
 Section 411
 1
 2
 
 across 2 adjacent reinforcing bars and will freely rotate when rebar cages are lowered into
 excavations.
 
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
 10
 
 If CSL tubes are required, securely attach CSL tubes to spiral reinforcing steel on the inside
 of rebar cages with at least 3 inches of clearance to reinforcing bars. Extend CSL tubes
 from 6 inches above pier tip elevations to at least 2 feet above the ground line or top of
 permanent casings, whichever is greater. The number of CSL tubes required for each
 drilled pier is one tube per foot of design pier diameter with at least 4 tubes per pier. Space
 CSL tubes equally around rebar cages so distances between tubes measured around spiral
 reinforcing steel are uniform. Install CSL tubes as straight and parallel to each other as
 possible. Fit caps on top and bottom of CSL tubes.
 
 11
 12
 13
 14
 15
 16
 
 After the Engineer determines that the material below excavations provides the minimum
 required tip resistance and holes are clean, place rebar cages and then concrete in
 excavations. Do not rack or distort rebar cages and CSL tubes when lifting and handling
 cages. Set rebar cages directly on bottom of holes or, as approved by the Engineer, hang
 cages from permanent casings. When hanging rebar cages, leave devices supporting cages
 in place until Drilled Pier concrete attains a compressive strength of at least 3,000 psi.
 
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 
 Do not delay placing cages or concrete unless excavations are cased to rock or otherwise
 approved. If delays occur, the Engineer may require removal of rebar cages to reinspect
 bottom cleanliness of holes. If bottom of holes does not meet the cleanliness criteria in
 Subarticle 411-4(D)(2), remove sediment from holes until the Engineer determines holes
 are clean before resetting rebar cages.
 
 22
 23
 24
 25
 26
 
 After placing rebar cages with CSL tubes, remove top caps, fill tubes with clean water and
 reinstall caps before placing concrete. Check for correct cage position before placing
 concrete and keep rebar cages plumb during concrete placement. Maintain cage position
 so rebar cages do not move vertically more than 6 inches and columns or footings have the
 minimum required concrete cover shown in the plans.
 
 27
 28
 29
 30
 31
 
 Remove all temporary casings during concrete placement. Do not twist, move or otherwise
 disturb temporary casings until the concrete depth inside casings is at least 10 feet or half
 the head, whichever is greater, above the bottom of casing being disturbed. Define “head”
 as the difference between the highest piezometric head along the drilled pier length and the
 static water elevation inside the excavation.
 
 32
 33
 34
 35
 36
 
 When removing temporary casings, maintain the required concrete depth above the bottom
 of casing being removed except when the concrete level is at or above top of piers. Sustain
 sufficient concrete depths to overcome pressures imposed by earth, backfill and fluids. As
 temporary casings are withdrawn, ensure fluids trapped behind casings is displaced upward
 and discharged out of excavations without contaminating or displacing concrete.
 
 37
 38
 39
 
 Pour concrete in excavations to form uniform jointless monolithic drilled piers. Do not
 trap soil, air, fluids or other contaminants in concrete. Remove contaminated concrete from
 top of piers at time of concrete placement.
 
 40
 41
 42
 
 Inform the Engineer of the volume of concrete placed for each pier. For piers constructed
 with slurry or as directed, record a graphical plot of depth versus theoretical and actual
 concrete volumes.
 
 43
 44
 45
 46
 
 Dry or wet placement of concrete is at the Contractor’s option for piers constructed with
 only casings if the water inflow rate into excavations is less than 6 inches per half hour
 after removing any pumps from holes. Wet placement of concrete is required for all other
 drilled pier construction.
 
 47
 
 (1) Dry Placement
 
 48
 49
 50
 
 If holes are filling with water for dry placement of concrete, dewater excavations as
 much as possible before placing concrete. For drilled piers less than 80 feet long, pour
 concrete down the center of excavations so concrete does not hit reinforcing steel or
 4-15
 
 Section 411
 1
 2
 
 excavation sidewalls. For piers longer than 80 feet, place concrete with a tremie or
 pump pipe down the center of excavations so length of free fall is less than 80 feet.
 
 3
 
 (2) Wet Placement
 
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
 10
 
 For wet placement of concrete, maintain static water or slurry levels in holes before
 placing concrete. Place concrete through steel tremies or pump pipes. Use tremies
 with watertight joints and a diameter of at least 10 inches. Pump concrete in
 accordance with Article 420-5. Use approved devices to prevent contaminating
 concrete when tremies or pump pipes are initially placed in excavations. Extend
 tremies or pump pipes into concrete at least 5 feet at all times except when the concrete
 is initially placed.
 
 11
 12
 13
 14
 
 When the concrete level reaches the static water elevation inside the excavation, dry
 placement of concrete is permitted. Before changing to dry placement, pump water or
 slurry out of holes and remove contaminated concrete from the exposed concrete
 surface.
 
 15
 
 411-5
 
 INTEGRITY TESTING
 
 16
 17
 18
 19
 20
 
 Define “integrity testing” as crosshole sonic logging (CSL) and pile integrity testing (PIT).
 Integrity testing may be required as noted in the plans or by the Engineer. The Engineer will
 determine how many and which drilled piers require integrity testing. Do not test piers until
 Drilled Pier concrete cures for at least 7 days and attains a compressive strength of at least 3,000
 psi.
 
 21
 
 (A) Crosshole Sonic Logging
 
 22
 23
 24
 25
 
 If CSL testing is required, use a prequalified CSL Consultant to perform CSL testing and

 Perform CSL testing in accordance with ASTM D6760. If probes for CSL testing will
 not pass through to the bottom of CSL tubes, the Engineer may require coring to
 replace inaccessible tubes. Do not begin coring until core hole size and locations are
 approved. Core at least 1.5 inches diameter holes the full length of piers. Upon
 completion of coring, fill holes with clean water and cover to keep out debris. Perform
 CSL testing in core holes instead of inaccessible tubes.
 
 33
 34
 35
 36
 
 For piers with 4 or 5 CSL tubes, test all tube pairs. For piers with 6 or more CSL tubes,
 test all adjacent tube pairs around spiral reinforcing steel and at least 50% of remaining
 tube pairs selected by the Engineer. Record CSL data at depth intervals of 2.5 inches
 or less from the bottom of CSL tubes to top of piers.

 If required, the Engineer will perform PIT. Provide access to and prepare top of piers for
 PIT as directed. See ASTM D5882 for PIT details.
 (C) Further Investigation
 Define “further investigation” as any additional testing, excavation or coring following
 initial integrity testing. Based on concrete placement and initial integrity testing results,
 the Engineer will determine if drilled piers are questionable and require further
 investigation within 7 days of receiving CSL reports or completing PIT. For initial CSL
 testing, the Engineer will typically determine whether further investigation is required
 based on Table 411-3.

 (1) CSL Testing
 
 35
 36
 37
 38
 39
 
 If required, use CSL testing as described above to retest questionable piers and as
 directed, perform testing with probes vertically offset in CSL tubes. CSL offset data
 will typically be required for all locations (tube pair and depth) with velocity
 reductions greater than 30% and at other locations as directed. Record offset data at
 depths, intervals and angles needed to completely delineate anomalies.
 4-17
 
 Section 411

 13
 14
 
 If required, core questionable piers and provide PQ size cores that meet ASTM D2113.
 The Engineer will determine the number, location and depth of core holes required.
 Handle, log and store concrete cores in accordance with ASTM D5079. Provide cores
 to the Engineer for evaluation and testing. Sign, date and submit core logs upon
 completion of each core hole.
 (D) Defective Piers
 
 15
 16
 17
 18
 19
 
 For questionable piers that are exposed or cored, the Engineer will determine if piers are
 defective based on the results of excavation or coring. For questionable piers that are not
 exposed or cored, the Engineer will determine if piers are defective based on the results of
 integrity testing. Questionable piers with only CSL testing will be considered defective if
 any velocity reductions between any tube pairs are greater than 30%.
 
 20
 
 411-6
 
 21
 
 Drilled pier acceptance is based in part on the following criteria:
 
 22
 23
 
 (A) Temporary casings and drilling tools are removed from the drilled pier excavation or the
 Engineer determines that a temporary casing may remain in the excavation.
 
 24
 25
 
 (B) Drilled Pier concrete is properly placed and does not have any evidence of segregation,
 intrusions, contamination, structural damage or inadequate consolidation (honeycombing).
 
 26
 27
 28
 
 (C) Center of pier is within 3 inches of plan location and 2% of plumb. Top of pier is within
 1 inch above and 3 inches below the elevation shown in the plans or approved by the
 Engineer.
 
 29
 30
 31
 
 (D) Rebar cage is properly placed and top and center of cage is within tolerances for center of
 pier. Tip of permanent casing does not extend below the elevation noted in the plans or
 approved by the Engineer.
 
 32
 33
 
 (E) Drilled pier is not defective or the Engineer determines the defective pier is satisfactory.
 A pier will be considered defective based on Subarticle 411-5(D).

 Do not grout CSL tubes or core holes, backfill around a pier or perform any work on a drilled
 pier until the Engineer accepts the pier. If the drilled pier is accepted, dewater and grout
 CSL tubes and core holes, and backfill around the pier with approved material to finished grade.
 If the Engineer determines a pier is unacceptable, remediation is required. Remediation may
 include, but is not limited to grouting, removing part or all of unacceptable piers, modifying
 pier designs or providing replacement or additional piers or piles. Submit working drawings
 and design calculations for acceptance in accordance with Article 105-2. Ensure remediation
 submittals are designed, detailed and sealed by an engineer licensed by the State of North
 Carolina. Do not begin remediation work until remediation plans are approved. When repairing
 unacceptable piers, perform post repair testing to gauge success of the repair. No extension of
 completion date or time will be allowed for remediation of unacceptable drilled piers or post
 repair testing.

 resulting from rate of pours, setting times and effects of vibration on the concrete, so the
 finished concrete surface conforms to the proper dimensions and contours and has an even
 appearance.
 
 27
 
 Use lumber and other material for forms and falsework that is sound and in good condition.
 
 28
 29
 30
 
 Set falsework and forms to give the correct elevation shown on the drawings making proper
 allowance for shrinkage, deflections and settlement, and maintain true to lines and grades
 designated until the concrete sufficiently hardens.
 
 31
 32
 33
 
 Where falsework or forms appear to be unsatisfactorily built in any respect either before or
 during placing of concrete, the Engineer will order the work stopped until the defects are
 acceptably corrected.
 
 34
 35
 36
 
 Keep the falsework and forms in place after placing of concrete for the periods specified
 in Article 420-16. Remove falsework and forms in an acceptable manner. Do not leave
 forms or falsework permanently in place without written approval.
 4-24
 
 Section 420

 Provide a means, satisfactory to the Engineer, to check any settlement or deflection that
 may occur during the placing of concrete in the various portions of the work.
 (B) Falsework
 
 4
 5
 6
 
 Build falsework on foundations of sufficient strength to carry the applied loads without
 appreciable settlement. Support falsework that cannot be founded on solid footings on
 ample falsework piling.
 
 7
 8
 9
 
 Use an acceptable method to compensate for shrinkage, deflection and settlement. Use
 jacks to readily effect adjustment, if necessary, before or during placing of concrete, if
 required by the Engineer.
 
 10
 11
 12
 13
 14
 
 (C) Forms
 (1) General
 Use forms made of wood or steel except where other materials are specified by the
 contract or accepted by the Engineer.
 (2) Wood Forms
 
 15
 16
 17
 
 Build forms mortar-tight of material sufficient in strength with ample studding,
 walling and bracing to effectively prevent any appreciable horizontal and vertical
 deflection.
 
 18
 19
 
 Provide forms with interior dimensions such that the finished concrete is of the form
 and dimensions shown in the plans.
 
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 
 Line forms, except for surfaces permanently in contact with earth fill, with plywood
 or other approved material. Provide a lining with a smooth and uniform texture and
 of such thickness and rigidity that a concrete surface of uniform texture and even
 appearance results. Provide joints between form liners that are mortar tight and even
 and maintain to prevent the opening of joints due to the shrinkage of the lumber.
 
 25
 26
 27
 
 Fillet forms at all sharp corners unless otherwise noted in the plans. Mill wood
 chamfer strips from straight grained lumber and surface on all sides. Maintain an
 acceptable alignment and no broken edges on all chamfer strips.
 
 28
 
 Give forms for all projections a bevel or draft to insure easy removal.
 
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 
 At all times, maintain the shape, strength, rigidity, watertightness and surface
 smoothness of reused forms. Resize any warped or bulged lumber before reusing. Do
 not reuse any forms that are unsatisfactory in any respect. Do not use plywood sheets
 showing torn grain, worn edges, patches, holes from previous use or other defects that
 impair the texture of concrete surfaces exposed to view.
 
 34
 35
 36
 37
 
 Thoroughly clean forms previously used of all dirt, mortar and foreign material before
 reusing. Before placing concrete in forms to be removed, thoroughly coat all inside
 surfaces of the forms with commercial quality form oil or other equivalent coating
 which permits the ready release of the forms and does not discolor the concrete.

 Construct or install metal spacers or anchorages, required within the forms for their
 support or to hold them in correct alignment and location, in such a way that the metal
 work can be removed to a depth of at least 1 inch from the exposed surface of the
 concrete without injury to such surface by spalling or otherwise. Limit the diameter
 to not greater than 1.5 times its depth for the recess formed in the concrete. Cut back
 all such metal devices in exposed surfaces, upon removal of the forms, to a depth of
 at least 1 inch from the face of the concrete. Carefully fill cavities produced by the
 removal of metal devices with cement mortar of the same mix used in the body of the
 work immediately upon removal of the forms, and leave the surface smooth, even and
 as nearly uniform in color as possible. As an option, break off flush with the concrete

 Apply Subarticle 420-3(C)(2) in regards to design, mortar tightness, filleted corners,
 beveled projections, bracing, alignment, texture and evenness of appearance of the
 resulting concrete surface, removal, re-use and oiling to steel forms. Use steel for
 forms of such thickness that the forms remain true to shape. Counter-sink bolt and
 rivet heads. Design clamps, pins or other connecting devices to hold the forms rigidly
 together and allow removal without injury to the concrete. Do not use steel forms that
 do not present a smooth surface or line up properly. Exercise care to keep steel forms
 free from rust, grease or other foreign matter that will tend to discolor the concrete.

 30
 31
 32
 33
 34
 35
 
 When required by the design plans, detail stay-in-place forms with excluder plates to
 exclude concrete from the valleys in the forms. Foam insulation void fillers may be
 used in stay-in-place metal forms. Adhesive shall be used on all 3 contacting sides of
 the foam insulation void fillers rather than on the bottom only. The adhesive shall be
 compatible with the foam insulation material to not cause decomposition. Duct tape
 shall not be used to hold the foam insulation in place. Foam insulation shall be placed
 in one piece across each bay and be trimmed to not extend over the girder. Foam
 insulation damaged during placement of reinforcing steel shall be replaced.

 Design metal stay-in-place forms in accordance with the following criteria:
 
 37
 38
 39
 40
 41
 
 (a) Accommodate the dead load of the form, reinforcement and the plastic concrete,
 including the additional weight of concrete due to the deflection of the metal
 forms, plus 50 lb/sf for construction loads. Do not allow the unit working stress
 in the steel sheet to exceed 72.5% of the specified minimum yield strength of the
 material furnished nor 36 ksi.
 
 42
 43
 
 (b) Limit the horizontal leg of the support angle to 3 inches. Design the support angle
 as a cantilever.
 
 44
 45
 46
 
 (c) Limit the deflection under the weight of the forms, the plastic concrete and

 Install all forms in accordance with detailed fabrication plans submitted to the
 Engineer for review. Clearly indicate on the fabrication plans the locations where the
 forms are supported by steel beam flanges subject to tensile stresses. Do not weld to
 the flanges within these locations. Do not allow form sheets to rest directly on the top
 of the beam or girder. Securely fasten sheets to form supports with a minimum bearing
 length of 1 inch at each end. Center sheets between the form supports. Place form
 supports in direct contact with the flange of girder or beam. Make all attachments by
 permissible welds, bolts, clips or other approved means. Weld in accordance with
 Article 1072-18 except 1/8 inch fillet welds are permitted.

 PLACING CONCRETE
 
 26
 27
 28
 
 Do not place concrete until the depth of the excavation, character of the foundation material,
 adequacy of the forms and falsework, placement of reinforcement and other embedded items
 are inspected and approved. Do not place concrete without the Department’s inspector present.
 
 29
 30
 
 Place concrete in daylight or obtain approval for an adequate lighting system for construction
 and inspection of the work.
 
 31
 32
 33
 
 In preparation for the placing of concrete, remove all sawdust, chips and other construction
 debris and extraneous matter from the interior of forms. Remove hardened concrete and foreign
 matter from tools, screeds and conveying equipment.
 
 34
 35
 36
 
 Ensure that the concrete temperature at the time of placement in the forms is at least 50°F and
 no more than 95°F, except where other temperatures are required by Articles 420-7
 and 420-14.
 
 37
 38
 
 Do not use concrete that does not reach its final position in the forms within the time stipulated
 in Subarticle 1000-4(E).
 
 39
 40
 
 Thoroughly clean and wet surfaces, other than foundation surfaces, immediately before placing
 concrete to help bonding to those surfaces.
 
 41
 42
 
 Regulate the placement of concrete so the pressures caused by the wet concrete do not exceed
 those used in the design of the forms.
 
 43
 44
 45
 46
 
 Thoroughly work the external surface of all concrete during the placing with approved tools.
 During the placing of concrete, take care to use methods of compaction that result in a surface
 of even texture free from voids, water or air pockets, and that force the coarse aggregate away
 from the forms to leave a mortar surface.
 
 47
 
 Place concrete to avoid segregation of the materials and the displacement of the reinforcement.
 4-29
 
 Section 420

 2
 
 Equip chutes on steep slopes with baffle boards or provide chutes in short lengths that reverse
 the direction of movement.
 
 3
 4
 5
 
 Use all chutes, troughs and pipes made from suitable materials other than aluminum and keep
 them clean and free from coating of hardened concrete by thoroughly flushing with water after
 each run. Discharge the water used for flushing clear of the structure.
 
 6
 7
 
 Confine concrete dropped more than 5 feet by closed chutes or pipes, except in walls of box
 culverts or retaining walls unless otherwise directed.
 
 8
 9
 10
 11
 
 Take care to fill each part of the form by depositing the concrete as near to its final position as
 possible. Work the coarse aggregate back from the forms and around the reinforcement without
 displacing the bars. After initial set of the concrete, do not jar the forms and do not place strain
 on the projecting reinforcement or other items embedded in the concrete.

 Compact all concrete required to be vibrated with approved high frequency internal vibrators
 or other approved type of vibrators immediately after depositing concrete in the forms. In all
 cases, have available at least 2 vibrators in good operating condition and 2 sources of power at
 the site of any structure in which more than 25 cubic yard of concrete is required. Do not attach
 or hold the vibrators against the forms or the reinforcing steel. When vibrating concrete
 containing epoxy coated reinforcing steel, use a vibrator with a protective rubber head as
 approved by the Engineer. Vibrate with care and avoid displacement of reinforcement, ducts
 or other embedded elements. Vibrate in the appropriate location, manner and duration to secure
 maximum consolidation of the concrete without causing segregation of the mortar and coarse
 aggregate and without causing water to flush to the surface. When placing concrete to a depth
 in excess of 12 inches and containing one or more horizontal layers of reinforcing steel, place
 the concrete in horizontal layers not more than 12 inches thick. Place and compact each layer
 before the preceding layer takes initial set such that there is no surface of separation between
 layers. Do not taper layers of concrete in wedge-shaped slopes but instead place them with
 reasonably square ends and level tops.
 
 27
 28
 29
 30
 
 If placing additional concrete against hardened concrete, take care to remove all laitance and to
 roughen the surfaces of the concrete to ensure that fresh concrete is deposited upon sound
 concrete surfaces and an acceptable bond is obtained. Thoroughly wet the existing concrete for
 at least 2 hours before placing additional concrete.
 
 31
 32
 33
 34
 
 Deposit and compact to form a compact, dense, impervious concrete of uniform texture which
 shows smooth faces on exposed surfaces. Repair, remove and replace in whole or in part as
 directed and at no additional cost to the Department, any section of concrete found to be porous,
 cracked, plastered or otherwise defective.
 
 35
 36
 37
 
 Protect beams and girders during concreting operations. Remove any concrete that gets on
 beams or girders immediately by an approved method to restore the surface to the specified
 condition.

 Placement of concrete by pumping is permitted only when approved. Use and locate suitable
 pumping equipment that is adequate in capacity for the work and so no vibrations result which
 might damage freshly placed concrete. Do not use pumping equipment, including the conduit
 system, which contains any aluminum or aluminum alloy that comes in contact with the
 concrete.
 
 44
 
 Waste all grout used to lubricate the inner surfaces of the conduit system.

 PLACING CONCRETE IN COLD WEATHER
 
 8
 9
 10
 11
 12
 
 Do not place concrete when the air temperature, measured at the location of the concreting
 operation in the shade away from artificial heat, is below 35°F without permission. When
 such permission is granted, uniformly heat the aggregates and water to a temperature not
 higher than 150°F. Place the concrete when the temperature of the heated concrete is at
 least 55°F and not more than 80°F.
 
 13
 14
 
 Use aggregates that are free of ice, frost and frozen particles. Do not place concrete on
 frozen foundation material.
 
 15
 16
 
 Protect all concrete with heated enclosures or by insulation whenever any of the following
 conditions occur:
 
 17
 18
 
 (1) The concrete is placed when the air temperature, measured at the location of the
 concreting operation in the shade away from artificial heat, is below 35°F.
 
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 
 (2) The air temperature, measured at the location of the freshly placed concrete in the
 shade away from artificial heat, is below 35°F and the concrete has not yet attained an
 age of 72 hours or an age of 48 hours when using high early strength Portland cement
 concrete. If the mix contains fly ash or ground granulated blast furnace slag, protect
 the concrete for 7 days.
 
 24
 25
 26
 
 Provide and place, at directed locations, a sufficient number of maximum-minimum
 recording thermometers to provide an accurate record of the temperature surrounding the
 concrete during the entire protection period.
 
 27
 28
 29
 30
 
 Assume all risks connected with the placing of concrete under the cold weather conditions
 referred to herein. Permission given to place concrete when the temperature is below 35°F
 and the subsequent protection of the concrete as required herein does not relieve the
 Contractor in any way of the responsibility for obtaining the required results.
 
 31
 
 (B) Heated Enclosures
 
 32
 33
 34
 35
 36
 37
 38
 39
 
 Immediately enclose Portland cement concrete that is placed when the air temperature is
 below 35°F and Portland cement concrete that has not yet attained an age of 72 hours.
 Enclose the concrete before the air temperature falls below 35°F with a housing consisting
 of canvas or other approved material supported by an open framework. Maintain the air
 surrounding the concrete at a temperature of at least 50°F and no more than 90°F for the
 remainder of the 72-hour period. Apply these same requirements to high early strength
 Portland cement concrete except reduce the 72-hour period to 48 hours. Do not begin these
 time periods until completing manipulation of each separate mass of concrete.
 
 40
 41
 42
 
 Provide such heating apparatuses as stoves, salamanders or steam equipment and the
 necessary fuel. When using dry heat, provide means of preventing loss of moisture from
 the concrete.
 
 43
 44
 45
 46
 47
 
 (C) Insulation
 As an alternate to the heated enclosure specified in Subarticle 420-7(B), use insulated
 forms or insulation meeting all requirements of this subarticle to protect concrete. Use
 insulation under the same conditions that require heated enclosures. Place the insulation
 on the concrete as soon as initial set permits.

 When using insulation for cold weather protection, batch concrete for sections 12 inches
 or less in thickness or diameter as outlined below. Use Type III Portland cement without
 any increase in cement content, or use Type I or II Portland cement with the cement content
 increased to 1.80 barrels per cubic yard. When the mix includes fly ash, use a mix
 containing 572 lb/cy of cement and at least 172 lb/cy of fly ash. When the mix includes
 ground granulated blast furnace slag, use a mix containing 465 lb/cy of cement and
 250 lb/cy of ground granulated blast furnace slag.

 Use insulated materials with a minimum thickness of 1 inch. Insulate overhang forms both
 on the outside vertical faces and on the underside with a 1 inch minimum thickness of either
 rigid or blanket type insulation. Use insulating materials which provide a minimum system
 R value of 4.0 in the up mode as determined by ASTM C1363 with a 15 mph wind over
 the cold side of the material and a minimum differential of 50°F. Furnish results of tests
 conducted in accordance with ASTM C1363 by an acceptable commercial testing
 laboratory for review, comments and acceptance. Obtain such acceptance before use of
 the material. Face or cover insulating blankets, top and bottom, with polyethylene or
 similar waterproofing material meeting Article 1026-3 except for the length and color
 requirements. Place blankets on the concrete to form a waterproof surface for the protected
 concrete. Do not use blankets with rips and tears in the waterproofing material unless
 acceptably repaired. When the anticipated low temperature expected during the protection
 period is less than 10°F, provide 2 inches of insulation. Overlap blanket insulation mats at
 the edges by at least 6 inches. Tightly butt rigid type insulation sheets together and seal.
 Take particular care to provide effective protection of curbs, corners and around protruding
 reinforcing steel.
 
 24
 25
 26
 27
 
 Should the air under the insulation fall below 50°F during the protection period,
 immediately cover the concrete with canvas and framework or other satisfactory housing
 and apply heat uniformly at a rate such that the air surrounding the concrete is at least 50°F
 for the remainder of the protection period.
 
 28
 29

 Provide construction joints only where located in the plans or shown in the placing schedule,
 unless otherwise approved in writing.
 
 34
 35
 36
 
 Place the concrete in each integral part of the structure continuously. Do not start work on any
 such part unless the concrete supply, forces and equipment are sufficient to complete the part
 without interruption in the placing of the concrete.
 
 37
 
 In case of emergency, make construction joints or remove the concrete as directed.
 
 38

 Make construction joints without keys, except when required in the plans. Rough float surfaces
 of fresh concrete at horizontal construction joints sufficiently to thoroughly consolidate the
 concrete at the surface.
 
 41
 42
 43
 44
 
 After placing concrete to the construction joint and before placing fresh concrete, thoroughly
 clean the entire surface of horizontal and vertical construction joints of surface laitance, curing
 compound and other materials foreign to the concrete. Thoroughly clean and wet concrete
 surfaces for at least 2 hours before placing additional concrete to help bonding.
 
 45

 420-13 ADHESIVELY ANCHORED ANCHOR BOLTS OR DOWELS
 
 7
 
 (A) Description
 
 8
 9
 10
 11
 
 The work covered by this section consists of furnishing all necessary labor, equipment and
 materials and performing all operations necessary for installing anchor bolts/dowels in
 concrete using an adhesive bonding system in accordance with the details shown in the
 plans and with Article 1081-2.
 
 12
 
 The use of adhesive anchors for overhead installments is not permitted.
 
 13
 14
 15
 16
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 
 Submit a description of the proposed adhesive bonding system to the Engineer for review,
 comments and acceptance. Include in the description the bolt type and its deformations,
 equipment, manufacturer’s recommended hole diameter, embedment depth, material
 specifications and any other material, equipment or procedure not covered by the contract.
 List the properties of the adhesive, including density, minimum and maximum temperature
 application, setting time, shelf life, pot life, shear strength and compressive strength. If
 bars/dowels containing a corrosion protective coating are required, provide an adhesive
 that does not contain any chemical elements that are detrimental to the coating and include
 a statement to this effect in the submittal concerning the contents as required by Federal or
 State laws and regulations.
 
 23
 
 (B) Procedure
 
 24
 
 (1) Drilling of Holes into Concrete
 
 25
 26
 27
 
 When directed, use a jig or fixture to ensure the holes are positioned and aligned
 correctly during the drilling process. Upon approval, adjusting hole locations to avoid
 reinforcing steel is permitted.
 
 28
 29
 30
 
 Drill the holes with a pneumatic drill unless another drilling method is approved.
 Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations regarding the diameter of the drilled
 hole.
 
 31
 32
 33
 34
 35
 36
 
 Immediately after completion of drilling, blow all dust and debris out of the holes with
 oil-free compressed air using a wand extending to the bottom of the hole. Remove all
 dust from the sides of the holes by brushing the holes with a stiff-bristled brush of
 a sufficient size and then blow the hole free of dust. Repeat this procedure until the
 hole is completely clean. Check each hole with a depth gauge to ensure proper
 embedment depth.
 
 37
 
 Repair spalled or otherwise damaged concrete using approved methods.
 
 38
 
 (2) Inspection of Holes
 
 39
 40
 41
 
 Inspect each hole immediately before placing the adhesive and the anchor
 bolts/dowels. Ensure all holes are dry and free of dust, dirt, oil and grease. Rework
 any hole that does not meet the requirements of the contract.
 
 42
 
 (3) Mixing of Adhesive
 
 43
 
 Mix the adhesive in strict conformance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
 
 4-34
 
 Section 420
 1
 
 (4) Embedment of Anchor Bolt/Dowel
 
 2
 
 Clean each anchor bolt/dowel so it is free of all rust, grease, oil and other contaminants.
 
 3
 4
 5
 
 Unless otherwise shown in the plans, the minimum anchor bolt/dowel embedment
 depth is such that the adhesive develops at least 125% of the anchor bolt/dowel yield
 load as determined by the manufacturer.
 
 6
 7
 8
 9
 
 Installation of the adhesive anchors shall be in accordance with manufacturer’s
 recommendations and shall occur when the concrete is above 40°F and has reached its
 28 day strength. The anchors shall be installed before the adhesive’s initial set (gel
 time).
 
 10
 11
 12
 13
 14
 
 Insert the anchor bolt/dowel the specified depth into the hole and slightly agitate it to
 ensure wetting and complete encapsulation. After insertion of the anchor bolt/dowel,
 strike off any excessive adhesive flush with the concrete face. Should the adhesive
 fail to fill the hole, add additional adhesive to the hole to allow a flush strike-off. Do
 not disturb the anchor bolts/dowels while adhesive is hardening.
 
 15
 
 (C) Field Testing
 
 16
 17
 18
 
 When specified in the plans, test the installed anchor bolts/dowels for adequate adhesive
 as specified below. Inform the Engineer when the tests will be performed at least 2 days
 before testing. Conduct the tests in the presence of the Engineer.
 
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 
 Use a calibrated hydraulic centerhole jack system for testing. Place the jack on a plate
 washer that has a hole at least 1/8 inch larger than the hole drilled into the concrete.
 Position the plate washer on center to allow an unobstructed pull. Position the anchor
 bolts/dowels and the jack on the same axis. Ensure an approved testing agency calibrates
 the jack within 6 months before testing. Supply the Engineer with a certificate of
 calibration.
 
 25
 26
 
 In the presence of the Engineer, field test the anchor bolt or dowel in accordance with the
 test level shown in the plans and the following:
 
 27
 
 (1) Level 1 Field Testing
 
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 
 Test a minimum of 1 anchor but at least 10% of all anchors to 50% of the yield load
 shown in the plans. If less than 60 anchors are to be installed, install and test the
 required number of anchors before installing the remaining anchors. If more than
 60 anchors are to be installed, test the first 6 anchors before installing the remaining
 anchors, then test 10% of the number in excess of 60 anchors.
 (2) Level 2 Field Testing
 
 34
 35
 36
 37
 38
 
 Test a minimum of 2 anchors but at least 10% of all anchors to 80% of the yield load
 shown in the plans. If less than 60 anchors are to be installed, install and test the
 required number of anchors before installing the remaining anchors. If more than
 60 anchors are to be installed, test the first 6 anchors before installing the remaining
 anchors, then test 10% of the number in excess of 60 anchors.
 
 39
 40
 41
 42
 43
 
 Testing should begin only after the manufacturer’s recommended cure time has been
 reached. For testing, apply and hold the test load for 3 minutes. If the jack experiences
 any drop in gauge reading, the test shall be restarted. For the anchor to be deemed
 satisfactory, the test load shall be held for 3 minutes with no movement or drop in gauge
 reading.
 
 44
 45
 46
 47
 
 Record data for each anchor bolt or dowel tested on the report form entitled Installation
 Test Report of Adhesively Anchored Anchor Bolts or Dowels. Obtain this form from the
 Department’s Materials and Tests Engineer. Submit a copy of the completed report form
 to the Engineer.
 4-35
 
 Section 420
 1
 2
 
 Final acceptance of the adhesively anchored system is based on the conformance of the
 pull test. Failure to meet the criteria of this specification is grounds for rejection.
 
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 
 Remove all anchors or dowels that fail the field test without damage to the surrounding
 concrete. Redrill holes to remove adhesive bonding material residue and clean the hole in
 accordance with specifications. For reinstalling replacement anchors or dowels, follow the
 same procedures as new installations. Do not reuse failed anchors or dowels unless
 approved by the Engineer.

 420-14 PLACING AND FINISHING BRIDGE DECKS
 
 9
 
 (A) Placing Concrete
 
 10
 11
 
 Unless otherwise noted in the plans, use Class AA CIP concrete conforming to Section
 1000. When noted in the plans, use sand lightweight concrete conforming to Section 1000.
 
 12
 13
 14
 
 Place concrete in accordance with these specifications. Properly vibrate concrete to avoid
 honeycombs and voids. Ensure pouring sequences, procedures and mixes are approved by
 the Engineer.
 
 15
 16
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 
 For metal stay-in-place forms, do not place concrete on the forms to a depth greater than
 12 inches above the top of the forms. Do not drop concrete more than 3 feet above the top
 of the forms, beams or girder. Keep the top surface of prestressed concrete panels clean.
 Thoroughly inspect panels and remove any foreign matter, oil, grease or other
 contaminants either with a high pressure water blast or sand blast. Saturate the top surface
 of the prestressed concrete panels by thoroughly wetting the top surface with water for at
 least 2 hours before placing the CIP concrete slab. Do not allow the wetted panel surface
 to dry and remove all puddles and ponds of water from the surface of the panels and top of
 girder flanges before placing the CIP concrete slab.
 
 24
 25
 
 Obtain a smooth riding surface of uniform texture, true to the required grade and cross
 section, on all bridge decks.
 
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 
 Do not place bridge deck concrete until the Engineer is satisfied that adequate personnel
 and equipment are present to deliver, place, spread, finish and cure the concrete within the
 scheduled time; that experienced finishing machine operators and concrete finishers are
 employed to finish the deck; and that weather protective equipment and all necessary
 finishing tools and equipment are on hand at the site of the work and in satisfactory
 condition for use. Between April 15 and October 15, begin placing the bridge deck
 concrete as early as practical to allow the work to be accomplished during the cooler hours
 when forms, beams and reinforcing steel are at ambient air temperatures.
 
 34
 35
 36
 37
 
 Unless otherwise permitted, set the rate of concrete placement and use a set retarder such
 that the concrete remains workable until the entire operation of placing, screeding,
 rescreeding, surface testing and corrective measures where necessary are complete. Use
 of a set retarder is waived when conditions clearly indicate it is not needed.
 
 38
 39
 40
 
 Place concrete in the deck when the concrete temperature at the time of placement is at
 least 50°F and no more than 90°F, except where other temperatures are required by
 Article 420-7.
 
 41
 
 Place concrete at a minimum rate of 35 cubic yards per hour.
 
 42
 43
 44
 45
 46
 47
 
 Place and firmly secure supports for screeds or finishing machines before beginning
 placement of concrete. Set supports to elevations necessary to obtain a bridge roadway
 floor true to the required grade and cross section, and make allowance for anticipated
 settlement. Use supports of a type that upon installation, no springing or deflection occurs
 under the weight of the finishing equipment. Locate the supports such that finishing
 equipment operates without interruption over the entire bridge deck.
 
 48
 49
 
 Immediately before placing bridge deck concrete, check all falsework and make all
 necessary adjustments. Provide suitable means such as telltales to permit ready
 4-36
 
 Section 420
 1
 2
 
 measurement by the Engineer of deflection as it occurs. Unless otherwise permitted, do
 not adjust the profile grade-line for any of the forming types used.
 
 3
 4
 5
 
 Cast the concrete in accordance with the pour sequence shown in the plans, unless
 otherwise approved by the Engineer. Place concrete in a continuous manner between
 headers. Use approved screeds, screed supports and screeding methods.
 
 6
 
 (B) Finishing
 
 7
 8
 9
 10
 11
 
 Unless otherwise specified or permitted, use self-propelled mechanically operated
 longitudinal or transverse screeds for finishing bridge deck. Do not use vibratory screeds
 unless specifically approved. Use readily adjustable screeds with sufficient rigidity and
 width to strike-off the concrete surface at the required grade. Do not use aluminum strikeoff elements of screeds and hand tools used for finishing concrete.
 
 12
 13
 
 Furnish personnel and equipment necessary to verify the screed adjustment and operation
 before beginning concrete placement.
 
 14
 15
 16
 
 Unless otherwise permitted, do not use longitudinal screeds for pours greater than 85 feet
 in length. Place sufficient concrete ahead of the screeded area to assure all dead load
 deflection occurs before final screeding.
 
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 
 When using a transverse screed on a span with a skew angle less than 75° or more than
 105°, orient and operate the truss or beam supporting the strike-off mechanism parallel to
 the skew. Position the strike-off parallel to the centerline of bridge and make the leading
 edge of concrete placement parallel to the skew. If approved, operate at a reduced skew
 angle on very wide or heavily skewed spans where the distance between screed supports
 exceeds 100 feet.
 
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 
 Orient and operate transverse screeds used on spans with skew angles between 75° and
 105° parallel to the skew or perpendicular to the centerline of bridge. Position the strikeoff parallel to the centerline of bridge. Before placing concrete, verify the adjustment and
 operation of the screed as directed by operating the screed over the entire area and across
 all end bulkheads. Check the floor thickness and cover over reinforcing steel shown in the
 plans and make adjustments as necessary. For crowned decks that are finished on a skew,
 use the manufacturer’s recommended skew correction device and procedures.
 
 30
 31
 32
 33
 34
 35
 36
 
 During the screeding operation, keep an adequate supply of concrete ahead of the screed
 and maintain a slight excess immediately in front of the screed. Operate the screed to
 obtain a substantially uniform surface finish over the entire bridge deck. Do not allow
 workmen to walk on the concrete after screeding. Use at least 2 approved work bridges to
 provide adequate access to the work for finishing, testing, straightedging, making
 corrections, fogging, applying curing medium and for other operations requiring access to
 the bridge deck. Support the work bridges outside the limits of concrete placement.
 
 37
 38
 39
 40
 
 The Engineer will take random depth checks of deck thickness and cover over reinforcing
 steel over the entire placement area and directly behind the screed in the fresh concrete. If
 depth checks indicate variations from plan dimensions in excess of 1/2 inch, take corrective
 action immediately.
 
 41
 42
 43
 44
 45
 46
 47
 
 Immediately following the screed and while the concrete is still workable, test the floor
 surface for irregularities with a 10 foot straightedge. Test by holding the straightedge in
 successive positions parallel to the centerline of bridge and in contact with the floor surface.
 Test the surface approximately 18 inches from the curb line, at the centerline of each lane
 and at the centerline of 2 lane bridges. Advance along the bridge in stages of not more than
 half the length of straightedge. Test the surface transversely at the ends, quarter points and
 center of the span as well as other locations as directed.
 
 48
 49
 50
 
 Immediately correct areas showing depressions or high spots of more than 1/8 inch in
 10 feet by filling depressions with fresh concrete or by striking off high spots. Make
 corrections with hand tools or a combination of hand tools and rescreeding. Do not use the
 4-37
 
 Section 420
 1
 2
 
 straightedge as a finishing tool. Give surfaces adjacent to expansion joints special attention
 to assure they meet the required smoothness.
 
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
 
 Provide on-site fogging equipment which is capable of applying water to the concrete in
 the form of a fine fog mist in sufficient quantity to curb the effects of rapid evaporation of
 mixing water from the concrete on the bridge deck resulting from wind, high temperature,
 low humidity or a combination of these factors. Do not apply the moisture from the nozzle
 under pressure directly upon the concrete and do not allow it to accumulate on the surface
 in a quantity sufficient to cause a flow or wash the surface. Maintain responsibility for
 determining when to apply the fog mist but apply it when directed.
 
 10
 11
 12
 13
 14
 
 Keep readily available on site an adequate supply of suitable coverings that will protect the
 surface of the freshly placed bridge deck from rain. After the water sheen disappears from
 the surface and before the concrete becomes non-plastic, finish the surface of the floor
 further by burlap dragging, fine bristle brooming, belting or other acceptable method which
 produces an acceptable uniform texture.
 
 15
 16
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 
 Do not use membrane curing compound unless approved. Cure the concrete using the
 water method in accordance with Subarticle 420-15(B), with the following exceptions.
 Before reaching initial set, place a curing medium consisting of burlap under polyethylene
 sheets or another approved material on the deck and keep moist for at least 7 curing days.
 Wet the burlap or other approved curing medium before placing on the deck. Apply water
 to the curing medium through soaker hoses or another approved method. Apply water in
 amounts to keep the medium moist but do not allow the water to flow or pond on the deck.
 
 22
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
 
 After curing the concrete, test the finished surface with an approved rolling straightedge
 designed, constructed and adjusted to accurately indicate or mark all floor areas which
 deviate from a plane surface by more than 1/8 inch in 10 feet. Remove all high areas in
 the hardened surface in excess of 1/8 inch in 10 feet with an approved grinding or cutting
 machine. Where variations are such that the corrections will extend below the limits of the
 top layer of grout, seal the corrected surface with an approved sealing agent as required. If
 approved, correct low areas in an acceptable manner. Produce corrected areas that have a
 rough, uniform texture and present neat patterns. In all cases, maintain at least 2 inches of
 concrete cover over reinforcement.
 
 31
 32
 33
 34
 35
 36
 37
 38
 39
 40
 41
 42
 
 Unless otherwise indicated in the plans, groove bridge decks. Produce grooves
 perpendicular to the centerline of bridge. Do not start grooving until final straightedging
 and, when necessary, acceptable corrective measures are complete. Cut grooves into the
 hardened concrete using a mechanical saw device, which leaves rectangular grooves
 1/8 inch wide and 3/16 inch deep. Produce grooves that have a center to center spacing of
 3/4 inch. Do not groove the deck surface within 18 inches of the gutter lines and 2 inches
 of expansion joints or elastomeric concrete in expansion joint blockouts. On skewed
 bridges, ungrooved triangular areas adjacent to the joint are permitted, provided the
 distance from the centerline joint to the nearest groove, as measured parallel to the
 centerline of roadway, does not exceed 18 inches. Between expansion joints on
 horizontally curved bridges, periodically adjust the grooving operation such that adjacent
 grooves are separated by no more than 3 inches along the outer radius of the bridge deck.
 
 43
 44
 45
 46
 
 Continuously remove all slurry or other residue resulting from the grooving operation from
 the bridge deck by vacuum pick-up or other approved methods. Prevent slurry from
 flowing into deck drains or onto the ground or body of water under the bridge. Dispose of
 all residue by an approved method.
 
 47
 
 (C) Inspection
 
 48
 49
 50
 51
 
 After the deck concrete is in place for a minimum period of 2 days, test the concrete for
 soundness and bonding of the metal stay-in-place forms by sounding with a hammer as
 directed. For at least 25% of the individual form panels, as selected by the Engineer,
 hammer test over the entire area of the panel. If areas of doubtful soundness are disclosed
 4-38
 
 Section 420
 1
 2
 
 by this procedure, remove the forms from such areas for visual inspection after the pour
 attains a minimum compressive strength of 2,400 psi. Remove the stay-in-place forms.
 
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
 10
 11
 
 At locations where sections of the forms are removed, do not replace the forms, but repair
 the adjacent metal forms and supports to present a neat appearance and assure their
 satisfactory retention. As soon as the forms are removed, allow the Engineer to examine
 for cavities, honeycombs and other defects. If irregularities are found, and in the opinion
 of the Engineer these irregularities do not justify rejection of the work, repair the concrete
 as directed. If the concrete where the forms are removed is unsatisfactory, remove
 additional forms, as necessary, to inspect and repair the slab. Modify the methods of
 construction as required to obtain satisfactory concrete in the slabs. Remove and repair all
 unsatisfactory concrete as directed.
 
 12
 13
 
 Provide all facilities as are reasonably required for the safe and convenient conduct of the
 Engineer’s inspection procedures.

 Unless otherwise specified in the contract, use any of the following methods except for
 membrane curing compounds on bridge deck and approach slab, or on concrete which is
 to receive epoxy protective coating in accordance with Article 420-18. Advise the
 Engineer before using the proposed method. Ensure all material, equipment and labor
 necessary to promptly apply the curing are on the site before placing any concrete. Cure
 all patches in accordance with this article. Improperly cured concrete is considered
 defective.
 
 23

 Define a “curing day” as any consecutive 24-hour period, beginning when the manipulation
 of each separate mass is complete, during which the air temperature adjacent to the mass
 does not fall below 40°F.
 
 29
 
 After placing the concrete, cure it for 7 full curing days.
 
 30
 31
 32
 33
 
 Take all reasonable precautions to prevent plastic shrinkage cracking of the concrete,
 including the provision of wind screens, fogging, application of an approved temporary
 liquid moisture barrier or the early application of temporary wet coverings to minimize
 moisture loss.
 
 34
 
 Repair, remove or replace as directed concrete containing plastic shrinkage cracks.
 
 35
 
 (B) Water Method
 
 36
 37
 38
 
 Keep the concrete continuously wet by the application of water, through soaker hoses or
 another approved method, for a minimum period of 7 curing days after placing the
 concrete.
 
 39
 40
 41
 42
 43
 44
 45
 
 When using cotton mats, rugs, carpets, earth blankets or sand blankets to retain the
 moisture, keep the entire surface of the concrete damp by applying water with a nozzle that
 so atomizes the flow that a mist and not a spray is formed, until the surface of the concrete
 is covered with the curing medium. Do not apply the moisture from the nozzle under
 pressure directly upon the concrete and do not allow it to accumulate on the concrete in a
 quantity sufficient to cause a flow or wash the surface. At the expiration of the curing
 period, clear the concrete surfaces of all curing mediums.
 
 4-39
 
 Section 420
 1
 
 (C) Membrane Curing Compound Method
 
 2
 3
 4
 5
 
 Spray the entire surface of the concrete uniformly with a curing compound that is on the
 NCDOT APL. Use clear curing compound to which a fugitive dye is added for color
 contrast on bridge superstructures, substructures and retaining walls. Use either white
 pigmented or clear curing compound on culverts.
 
 6
 7
 8
 9
 
 Apply the membrane curing compound after the surface finishing is complete and
 immediately after the free surface moisture disappears. During the finishing period, protect
 the concrete by applying water with the fogging equipment specified in Subarticle 42015(B).
 
 10
 11
 12
 
 Seal the surface with a single uniform coating of the specified type of curing compound
 applied at the rate of coverage recommended by the manufacturer or as directed, but at
 least one gallon per 150 square feet of surface area.
 
 13
 14
 15
 16
 
 At the time of use, thoroughly mix the compound with the pigment uniformly dispersed
 throughout the vehicle. If the application of the compound does not result in satisfactory
 coverage, stop the method and begin water curing, as set out above, until the cause of the
 defective work is corrected.
 
 17
 18
 19
 20
 
 At locations where the coating shows discontinuities, pinholes or other defects, or if rain
 falls on the newly coated surface before the film dries sufficiently to resist damage, apply
 an additional coat of the compound at the same rate specified herein immediately after the
 rain stops.
 
 21
 22
 
 Completely remove any curing compound adhering to a surface to which new concrete is
 to be bonded by sandblasting, steel wire brushes, bush hammers or other approved means.
 
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 
 Protect the concrete surfaces to which the compound is applied from abrasion or other
 damage that results in perforation of the membrane film for 7 curing days after placing the
 concrete. If the film of membrane compound is damaged or removed before the expiration
 of 7 curing days, immediately cure the exposed concrete by the water method until the
 expiration of the 7 curing days or until applying additional curing compound.
 
 28
 29
 30
 
 If the application of curing compound is delayed, immediately start applying water as
 provided in Subarticle 420-15(B) and continue until resuming or starting application of the
 compound.
 
 31
 
 (D) Polyethylene Sheeting Method
 
 32
 33
 34
 35
 36
 37
 
 Wet the exposed finished surface of concrete with water, using a nozzle that so atomizes
 the flow to form a mist and not a spray, until the concrete sets, after which place the white
 opaque polyethylene sheeting. Continue curing for 7 curing days after the concrete is
 placed. If the sheeting is damaged or removed before the expiration of 7 curing days,
 immediately cure the exposed concrete by the water method until placing additional
 sheeting or until after 7 curing days.
 
 38
 39
 40
 
 Use sheeting which provides a complete continuous cover of the entire concrete surface.
 Lap the sheets at least 12 inches and securely weigh down or cement them together to
 provide a waterproof joint.
 
 41
 42
 43
 
 If any portion of the sheets is broken or damaged before the expiration of the curing period,
 immediately repair the broken or damaged portions with new sheets properly secured in
 place.
 
 44
 45
 
 Do not use sections of sheeting damaged to such an extent as to render them unfit for curing
 the concrete.
 
 4-40
 
 Section 420

 Finish all concrete as required by this article except for bridge decks. Use the type of finish
 called for in Subarticles 420-17(B) through 420-17(D), except where the contract requires
 a Class 1 or Class 2 surface finish. Apply epoxy protective coating as required by
 Article 420-18.
 (B) Ordinary Surface Finish
 Apply ordinary surface finish to all formed concrete surfaces either as a final finish or
 preparatory to a higher class finish. On surfaces backfilled or otherwise covered, or
 enclosed surfaces, the removal of fins and form marks, the rubbing of grouted areas to
 a uniform color, and the removal of stains and discoloration, is not required. Use
 an ordinary surface finish, unless otherwise required, as final finish on all surfaces.
 
 4-41
 
 Section 420
 1
 2
 3
 
 During the placing of concrete, take care to use methods of compaction that result in
 a surface of even texture free from voids, water or air pockets, and that the coarse aggregate
 is forced away from the forms to leave a mortar surface.
 
 4
 5
 6

 10
 
 Immediately after removing the forms, clean and fill with grout all pockets, depressions,
 honeycombs and other defects as directed. Remove all form ties or metal spacers to a depth
 of at least 1 inch below the surface of the concrete then clean and fill the resulting holes or
 depressions with grout. As an option, break off flush with the concrete surface those metal
 devices with exposed cross-sectional area not exceeding 0.05 square inches on surfaces
 permanently in contact with earth fill. Unless otherwise required, remove fins and other
 projections flush with the concrete surface. Remove stains and discoloration.
 
 11
 12
 13
 14
 
 Use grout for patching which contains cement and fine aggregate from the same sources
 and in the same proportions as used in the concrete. Cure the grout in accordance with
 Article 420-15. After the grout has thoroughly hardened, rub the surface with
 a carborundum stone as required to match the texture and color of the adjacent concrete.
 
 15
 
 Obtain the final finish for railing in one of the following ways:
 
 16
 
 (1) Brush Finish
 
 17
 18
 19
 20
 
 After striking off the concrete as described above, have skilled and experienced
 concrete finishers thoroughly work and float the surface with a wooden, canvas or cork
 float. Before this last finish sets, lightly stroke the surface with a fine brush to remove
 the surface cement film, leaving a fine grained, smooth, but sanded texture.
 
 21
 
 (2) Float Finish
 
 22
 23
 24
 
 Finish the surface with a rough carpet float or other suitable device leaving the surface
 even, but distinctly sandy or pebbled in texture.
 (C) Unformed Surfaces Not Subjected to Wear
 
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 
 Finish all unformed surfaces not subjected to wear by placing an excess of material in the
 forms and removing or striking off such excess with a wooden template, forcing the coarse
 aggregate below the mortar surface. Do not use mortar topping for concrete railing caps
 and other surfaces falling under this classification.
 (D) Sidewalk, Islands or Stairways on Bridges
 
 30
 31
 32
 33
 34
 
 Strike off and compact fresh concrete until a layer of mortar is brought to the surface.
 Finish the surface to grade and cross section with a float, trowel smooth and finish with
 a broom. If water is necessary, apply it to the surface immediately before brooming.
 Broom transverse to the line of traffic.
 (E) Class 1 Surface Finish
 
 35
 36
 37
 38
 39
 
 In addition to Subarticle 420-17(B), as soon as the pointing sets sufficiently to permit,
 thoroughly wet the entire surface with a brush and rub with a coarse carborundum stone or
 other equally good abrasive, bringing the surface to a paste. Continue rubbing to remove
 all form marks and projections, producing a smooth dense surface without pits or
 irregularities.
 
 40
 41
 42
 43
 44
 
 Carefully spread or brush uniformly over the entire surface the material ground to a paste
 by rubbing and allowing it to take a reset. After rubbing, cure the surface for 7 curing days.
 Obtain the final finish by thoroughly rubbing with a fine carborundum stone or other
 equally good abrasive. Continue this rubbing until the entire surface is of a smooth texture
 and uniform color.
 
 45
 
 (F) Class 2 Surface Finish
 
 46
 47
 
 In addition to Subarticle 420-17(B), after the pointing sets sufficiently to permit,
 thoroughly wet and rub the entire surface with a coarse carborundum stone or other equally

 10
 
 Use a Type 4A flexible and moisture insensitive epoxy coating in accordance with
 Section 1081. Provide a Type 3 material certification in accordance with Article 106-3
 showing the proposed epoxy meets Type 4A requirements.
 (B) Surfaces
 
 11
 12
 13
 14
 
 Apply the epoxy protective coating to the top surface area, including chamfer area of bent
 caps under expansion joints and of end bent caps, excluding areas under elastomeric
 bearings. For cored slab and box beam bridges, do not apply the epoxy protective coating
 to the bent or end bent caps.
 
 15
 16
 17
 18
 
 Use extreme care to keep the area under the elastomeric bearings free of the epoxy
 protective coating. Thoroughly clean all dust, dirt, grease, oil, laitance and other
 objectionable material from the concrete surfaces to be coated. Air blast all surfaces
 immediately before applying the protective coating.
 
 19
 
 Use only cleaning agents approved by the Engineer.
 
 20
 
 (C) Application
 
 21
 22
 23
 24
 25
 
 Apply epoxy protective coating only when the air temperature is at least 40°F and rising,
 but less than 95°F and the surface temperature of the area to be coated is at least 40°F, and
 in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. Remove any excess or free
 standing water from the surfaces before applying the coating. Apply one coat of epoxy
 protective coating at a rate such that it covers between 100 and 200 square feet per gallon.
 
 26
 27
 28
 
 Under certain combinations of circumstances, the cured epoxy protective coating may
 develop an oily condition on the surface due to amine blush. This condition is not
 detrimental to the applied system.
 
 29
 30
 31
 
 Apply the coating so the entire designated surface of the concrete is covered and all pores
 are filled. To provide a uniform appearance, use the exact same material on all visible
 surfaces.
 
 32
 
 420-19 PROTECTION OF SUBSTRUCTURE CONCRETE FROM RUST STAINS
 
 33
 34
 35
 
 To prevent unpainted structural steel from staining substructure concrete, protect all final
 exposed areas of the concrete from rust stains until casting the bridge deck and sealing the
 expansion joints. Use an approved method for protecting the concrete.
 
 36
 
 Instead of the above, remove the stains by approved methods and cleaning agents.
 
 37
 
 420-20 PLACING LOAD ON STRUCTURE MEMBERS

 In situations where the nut cannot be properly accessed due to lack of clearance,
 tighten by turning the bolt while preventing the nut from rotating. Use impact
 wrenches, if necessary, with adequate capacity and sufficiently supplied with air to
 perform the required tightening of each bolt in approximately 10 seconds.
 (2) Washers
 
 22
 23
 24
 25
 
 Make sure all fasteners have a hardened washer under the element, nut or bolt head,
 turned in tightening. Use galvanized washers when galvanized nuts and bolts are
 required. As an exception to the above, use special washers for oversize, short-slotted
 and long-slotted holes in accordance with Subarticle 1072-16(H).
 
 26
 27
 28
 
 Where an outer face of the bolted parts has a slope of more than 1:20 with respect to
 a plane normal to the bolt axis, use a smooth beveled washer to compensate for the
 lack of parallelism.
 
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 34
 35
 
 (3) Load Indicating Bolts
 Tightening by use of a load indicating bolt system is permitted provided it can be
 demonstrated by an accurate direct measurement procedure that the bolt is tightened
 in accordance with Table 440-1. Tighten by approved methods and procedures.
 (4) Galvanized High Strength Bolts
 Use mechanically galvanized high strength bolts in all bolted connections for painted
 structural steel.
 4-55
 
 Section 440
 1
 2
 
 Install galvanized high strength bolts carefully so shop painted surfaces are not scarred
 or otherwise damaged.
 
 3

 5
 6
 
 Repair galvanized surfaces that are abraded or damaged by thoroughly wire brushing
 the damaged area and removing all loose and cracked coating, after which give the
 cleaned area 2 coats of non-aerosol organic zinc repair paint, in accordance with
 Article 1076-7.
 
 7
 
 (5) Direct Tension Indicators
 
 8
 
 Supply direct tension indicators in accordance with ASTM F959 and Article 1072-5.
 
 9
 10
 
 Furnish the Engineer with at least two 0.005 inch metal feeler gauges for each
 container of direct tension indicators shipped before beginning installation.
 
 11
 12
 
 Make sure that the lot number on the containers of direct tension indicators is for the
 same lot number tested as indicated on the test documents.
 
 13
 14
 15
 
 Furnish to the Engineer 3 samples of load indicating washers from each lot number,
 each size and type for tests and 2 each of the metal feeler gauges required for
 performing the tests.
 
 16
 17
 18
 19
 
 Install the direct tension indicator under the bolt head. If it is necessary to install the
 direct tension indicator under the nut, or if the bolt head shall be turned, install
 additional hardened washers between the nut or bolt head and the direct tension
 indicator.
 
 20
 21
 
 Provide a tension indicating device on the project for determining the tension imposed
 on a fastener when the protrusions on direct tension indicator are properly compressed.
 
 22
 23
 24
 
 Test 3 samples from each lot of direct tension indicators in the presence of the
 Engineer. Achieve a minimum bolt tension of 5% greater than that required by
 Table 440-1 of Article 440-8.
 
 25
 26
 27
 
 Do not substitute direct tension indicators for hardened steel washers required with
 short slotted or oversized holes. If desired, use direct tension indicators in conjunction
 with hardened steel washers.
 
 28
 29
 30
 31
 
 Install direct tension indicators initially to a snug tight condition. Snug tight is defined
 as being attained after a few impacts of an impact wrench or the full effort of an
 ironworker with an ordinary spud wrench. After initial tightening, fully tighten
 beginning at the most rigid part of the joint and continuing toward its free edges.
 
 32
 33
 34
 
 For tightening fasteners containing direct tension indicators, use a clean and lubricated
 wrench. Maintain air supply and hoses in good condition and provide air pressure of
 at least 100 psi at the wrench.
 
 35
 36
 37
 38
 
 When tightening the fasteners, ensure that the part of the fastener being restrained from
 turning does not rotate during the tightening process. Ensure that no portion of the
 direct tension indicator protrusions is accidentally partially flattened before installing
 in the structural steel joints.
 
 39
 40
 
 Do not reuse direct tension indicators. If it is necessary to loosen a bolt previously
 tensioned, discard and replace the direct tension indicator.
 
 41
 
 (D) Inspection
 
 42
 43
 44
 45
 46
 
 Allow the Engineer the opportunity to observe installation of bolts to determine that the
 selected tightening procedure is properly used. The Engineer determines when bolts are
 properly tightened and in the case of direct tension indicator bolts that the correct indication
 of tension is achieved. After properly tightening bolts, make sure that the end of the bolt
 is flush with or extended beyond the outer face of the nut.
 4-56
 
 Section 440
 1
 
 Do not begin painting in the area of tightened bolts until after bolt inspection is complete.
 
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 
 When using direct tension indicators, proper tension of bolts is inspected by the Engineer
 by inserting a 0.005 inch thickness feeler gauge provided by the Contractor into the
 openings between adjacent flattened protrusions of the direct tension indicator. Proper
 tension is obtained when the number of spaces for which the gauge is refused is equal to
 or greater than the value shown in Table 440-2.

 16
 
 Attach steel pile points to steel piles in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
 Weld a minimum length of twice the flange width for steel H-piles.
 
 17
 18
 19
 
 Use steel pile tips with prestressed concrete piles as shown in the plans. Use steel pile
 splicers for splicing steel H-pile tips and composite piles. Attach steel pile splicers in
 accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
 
 20
 
 (D) Driven Piles
 
 21
 22
 
 Do not drive piles within 50 feet of CIP concrete until the concrete cures for at least 3 days.
 Do not use vibratory hammers to install prestressed concrete piles.
 
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 
 When predrilling, spudding and installing the initial portions of steel piles with vibratory
 hammers, submit these pile installation methods with the proposed pile driving methods
 and equipment for acceptance. Define “spudding” as driving or dropping a steel H-pile
 and then removing it. The Engineer will approve the spudding depth and H-pile size,
 predrilling depth and diameter and depth of pile installation with a vibratory hammer.
 
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 34
 35
 36
 
 Limit driving stresses in accordance with the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design
 Specifications. Use AASHTO driving stress limits for severe corrosive environments when
 calcium nitrite corrosion inhibitor is required for prestressed concrete piles. If a tip
 elevation is noted in the plans, drive steel and prestressed concrete piles to the minimum
 required driving resistance and tip elevation. Otherwise, drive steel and prestressed
 concrete piles to the minimum required driving resistance and at least 10 feet into natural
 ground. Drive composite piles to the minimum required driving resistance and the
 prestressed concrete and steel H-pile sections to their respective minimum required tip
 elevations noted in the plans.
 
 37
 38
 39
 
 Drive piles continuously to the required pile penetration unless stopped due to exceeding
 the maximum blow count or driving stresses, insufficient pile length or other approved
 reasons. Redrive piles raised or moved laterally due to driving adjacent piles.

 10
 11
 12
 13
 
 When noted in the plans or predrilling in water or wetlands, use temporary steel
 casings that meet Subarticle 450-3(E)(1), except use steel casings with inside
 diameters no more than 2 inches larger than predrilling diameters. Use temporary
 casings from at least 2 feet above the static water elevation or ground line, whichever
 is higher, to at least 5 feet below the ground or mud line. More than 5 feet embedment
 may be necessary if temporary casings are not stable or predrilling or spudding
 disturbs material outside casings.
 
 14
 15
 16
 17
 
 Perform predrilling and spudding so spoils are minimized, large ground movements
 and voids below ground do not occur and piles can be driven to the required resistance
 and pile penetration. Do not deposit spoils in water or wetlands. Remove all
 temporary casings before driving piles.
 
 18
 
 (2) Driving Equipment
 
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 
 Submit the proposed pile driving methods and equipment (pile driving equipment data
 form) including the pile driving hammer, hammer cushion, pile helmet and cushion
 for all piles for acceptance in accordance with Article 105-2. Do not submit more than
 2 pile driving hammers per pile type per submittal. Provide 2 copies of each data form
 at least 30 days before driving piles. All equipment is subject to satisfactory field
 performance.
 
 25
 26
 27
 28
 
 Drive piles with accepted driving equipment and operate pile driving hammers in
 accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. Use hammers that will not
 overstress piles and attain the required driving resistance between 30 and 180 blows
 per foot. Use variable energy hammers to drive prestressed concrete piles.
 
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 34
 
 Operate air and steam hammers within 10% of the manufacturer's rated speed or a rate
 approved by the Engineer. Use a plant and equipment for air or steam hammers with
 sufficient capacity to maintain, under working conditions, the manufacturer’s
 recommended volume and pressure. Equip the plant and equipment with accurate
 pressure gauges that are easily accessible. Provide striking parts of air and steam
 hammers weighing at least 2,750 lbs. and one-third the pile helmet and pile weight.
 
 35
 36
 37
 38
 39
 40
 41
 42
 
 Equip open-end (single acting) diesel hammers with a graduated scale (jump stick)
 extending above the ram cylinder, graduated rings or grooves on the ram or an electric
 sound activated remote measuring instrument to determine the hammer stroke during
 driving. Equip closed-end (double acting) diesel hammers with a calibrated bounce
 chamber pressure gauge mounted near the ground and provide a current calibrated
 chart or graph equating bounce chamber pressure and gauge hose length to equivalent
 energy. Submit this chart or graph with the proposed pile driving methods and
 equipment for closed-end diesel hammers.
 
 43
 44
 45
 
 The Engineer may inspect the hammer cushion before beginning and occasionally
 during driving. Expose the hammer cushion for inspection as directed. Replace or
 repair any hammer cushion that is less than 25% of its original thickness.
 
 46
 47
 48
 49
 
 Hold pile heads in position with pile helmets that closely fit over pile heads and extend
 down the sides of piles a sufficient distance. Protect pile heads of prestressed concrete
 piles from direct impact with accepted pile cushions. Use pile cushions made of pine
 plywood with a thickness of at least 4 inches. Provide a new pile cushion for each
 4-67
 
 Section 450
 1
 2
 
 prestressed concrete pile. Replace pile cushions during driving when a cushion is
 compressed more than 50% of its original thickness or begins to burn.

 The Engineer will determine if the proposed pile driving methods and equipment are
 acceptable and provide the blows per foot and equivalent set for the required driving
 resistance noted in the plans, i.e., “pile driving criteria” except for structures with pile
 driving analyzer (PDA) testing. For structures with PDA testing, provide pile driving
 criteria for any bents and end bents with piles in accordance with Subarticle 4503(F)(4).
 
 10
 11
 
 Stop driving piles when refusal is reached. Define “refusal” as 240 blows per foot or
 any equivalent set.
 
 12
 
 (4) Restriking and Redriving Piles
 
 13
 14
 15
 16
 17
 18
 
 After reaching the required pile penetration, the Contractor may choose to or the
 Engineer may require the Contractor to stop driving, wait and restrike or redrive piles
 to attain the required driving resistance. When the Engineer requires restrikes or
 redrives, the Engineer will determine the number of restrikes or redrives and the time
 to wait after stopping driving and between restrikes and redrives. The time to wait
 will range from 4 to 24 hours.
 
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 
 Use the same pile driving methods, equipment and compressed pile cushion from the
 previous driving to restrike or redrive piles unless the cushion is unacceptable due to
 deterioration. Do not use cold diesel hammers for restrikes or redrives, unless it is
 impractical to do otherwise as determined by the Engineer. In general, warm up
 hammers by applying at least 20 blows to a previously driven pile or timber mats on
 the ground.
 
 25
 
 (E) Drilled-in Piles
 
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
 31
 
 Perform pile excavation to elevations shown in the plans or approved by the Engineer.
 Excavate holes at pile locations with diameters that will result in at least 3 inches of
 clearance all around piles. Before filling holes, support and center piles in excavations and
 when noted in the plans, drive piles to the required driving resistance. Remove any fluids
 from excavations and, at the Contractor’s option, fill holes with concrete, grout or flowable
 fill unless required otherwise in the contract.
 
 32
 
 (1) Pile Excavation
 
 33

 38
 
 Use equipment with sufficient capacity to drill through soil, rock, boulders, timbers,
 man-made objects and any other materials encountered. Do not use blasting to
 advance pile excavations. Blasting for core removal is only permitted when approved
 by the Engineer. Contain and dispose of drilling spoils as directed and in accordance
 with Section 802. Drilling spoils consist of all materials and fluids removed from pile
 excavations.

 If unstable, caving or sloughing soils are anticipated or encountered, use slurry or
 temporary steel casings to stabilize holes. When using slurry, submit slurry details
 including product information and additives, manufacturer’s recommendations for
 use, slurry equipment details and documentation that mixing water is suitable for
 slurry before beginning drilling. When using temporary casings, use smooth noncorrugated clean watertight steel casings of ample strength to withstand handling and
 installation stresses and pressures imposed by concrete, earth, backfill and fluids. Use
 steel casings with an outside diameter equal to the hole size and a wall thickness of at
 least 1/4 inch.

 (2) Filling Holes
 Check the water inflow rate at the bottom of holes after all pumps have been removed.
 If the water inflow rate is greater than 6 inches per half hour or holes are stabilized
 with slurry, use an approved method for placing concrete, grout or flowable fill.
 Otherwise, remove any fluids and free fall concrete, grout or flowable fill into holes.
 Ensure that concrete, grout or flowable fill flows completely around piles. Place
 concrete, grout or flowable fill continuously and remove all temporary casings.

 The Engineer will determine how many and which piles require PDA testing. Provide piles
 for PDA testing that are at least 5 feet longer than the estimated pile lengths shown in the
 plans. Do not drive piles until the proposed pile driving methods and equipment have been
 preliminarily accepted. Notify the Engineer of the pile driving schedule at least 7 days in
 advance.
 
 21
 22
 23
 
 The Engineer will complete the review of the proposed pile driving methods and equipment
 within 7 days of receiving PDA reports and pile driving criteria. Do not place concrete for
 caps or footings on piles until PDA reports and pile driving criteria have been accepted.

 METHOD A WATERPROOFING
 
 Method A waterproofing consists of one coat of asphalt primer, and 3 mop coats of hot
 asphalt cement with 2 layers of cotton fabric alternating between the mop coats.
 
 4-82
 
 Section 458
 1
 
 (B) Preparation of Surface
 
 2
 3

 Ensure that concrete surfaces are dry, reasonably smooth and free from projections or holes
 which are capable of puncturing the membrane. Immediately before applying the
 waterproofing, thoroughly clean the surface of dust and loose materials.
 
 5
 6
 7
 8
 
 Make sure that the concrete is at least 14 days old for Class A concrete, at least 10 days old
 for Class AA concrete, or at least 7 days old for high early strength concrete, before
 beginning waterproofing. Do not waterproof in wet weather nor when the temperature is
 below 35°F, without permission.
 
 9
 
 (C) Application
 
 10
 11
 12
 13
 
 Give waterproofed surfaces a thorough coat of asphalt primer, and allow it to set thoroughly
 before applying the first mop coat. Heat the asphalt cement for the mop coat to a
 temperature of at least 300°F and frequently stir to avoid local overheating. Equip the
 heating kettles with thermometers.
 
 14
 
 Begin the waterproofing at the low point of the surface.
 
 15
 16
 17
 18
 
 Use a half width first strip of fabric; and a full width second strip. Lap the full width of
 the first strip. Make the third and each succeeding strip full width and lap so there are
 2 layers of fabric at all points with laps at least 2 inches wide. Make sure that the end laps
 are at least 12 inches.
 
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 
 Beginning at the low point of the surface, mop a section about 20 inches wide and the full
 length of the surface with hot asphalt cement. Immediately roll the first strip of fabric into
 the asphalt cement and press into place to eliminate all air bubbles and to provide a firm
 bond to the surface. Mop this strip and an adjacent section of the surface of a width equal
 to slightly more than half the width of the fabric with hot asphalt binder and roll a full
 width of the fabric into this cement, completely covering the first strip, and press into place.
 Mop this second strip and an adjacent section of the concrete surface with hot asphalt
 cement and place the third strip of fabric to lap the first strip at least 2 inches. Continue
 this process until the entire surface is covered, each strip of fabric lapping at least 2 inches
 over the second preceding strip. Give the entire surface a final mopping of hot asphalt
 cement.
 
 30
 31
 32
 33
 34
 
 Mop on concrete to completely cover the surface sufficiently heavy on cloth to completely
 conceal the weave. Use at least 12 gallons of asphalt on horizontal surfaces for each
 100 square feet of finished work and at least 15 gallons on vertical surfaces. Perform the
 work so, at the close of a day's work, all laid cloth receives the final mopping of asphalt.
 Thoroughly seal down all laps.
 
 35
 
 (D) Special Requirements
 
 36
 37
 38
 
 At the edges of the membrane and at any points punctured by such appurtenances as drains
 or pipes, make suitable provisions to prevent water from getting between the waterproofing
 and the waterproofed surface.
 
 39
 40
 41
 42
 
 Place all membrane flashing at curbs and against girders, spandrel walls, etc., with separate
 sheets of membrane lapping the main membrane at least 12 inches. Closely seal flashing
 with either a metal counter-flashing or by embedding the upper edges of the flashing in a
 groove poured full of joint filler.
 
 43
 44
 45
 46
 
 Provide expansion joints, both horizontal and vertical, with water stops and premolded
 joint filler as called for in the plans. Seal expansion joints in the face adjacent to the
 membrane bituminous material. Carry the membrane continuously across all expansion
 joints.
 
 47
 48
 
 At the ends of the structure carry the membrane well down on the abutments and make
 suitable provisions for all movement.

 A tolerance of ± 1/2 inch from the established grade will be permitted after the subgrade has
 been graded to a uniform surface. Subgrade tolerance of ± 1/4 inch from the established
 grade is required for subgrade under concrete pavement mainline lanes.
 
 12
 13
 14
 
 Perform the grading operation such that the maximum difference between the established
 grade and the graded subgrade within any 100 foot section is 1/2 inch for normal subgrade
 and 1/4 inch for subgrade for concrete pavement.
 
 15
 
 500-4
 
 16
 17
 18
 
 Provide and maintain ditches and drains to drain the subgrade satisfactorily. Where previously
 approved subgrade is damaged by natural causes, hauling equipment or other traffic, restore
 the subgrade to the required lines, grades, typical sections and density.
 
 19
 
 500-5
 
 20
 21
 
 Fine Grading will be paid at the contract lump sum price. Such lump sum price will be full
 payment for all material excavated to a depth of 0.4 feet below the existing graded surface.
 
 22
 23
 24
 
 Any material which has been excavated from the subgrade at the depth greater than 0.4 feet
 below the existing graded surface will be Unclassified Excavation and will be paid in
 accordance with Article 225-7.
 
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 
 As an exception to the above, on those areas in which the Contractor is responsible for
 constructing the embankment on which the subgrade is located, no payment will be made for
 that excavation that may be necessary to bring the grade to the established subgrade elevation
 and typical section. Incorporate such surplus material into the project at no additional cost to
 the Department.
 
 30
 31
 32
 33
 
 When sufficient material is not available from the fine grading operation to complete the work
 of fine grading, additional material will be paid in accordance with Article 225-7 for
 Unclassified Excavation or Article 230-5 for Borrow Excavation, depending on the source of
 material.
 
 34
 35
 36
 37
 
 Surplus material stockpiled for shoulder construction and incorporated into the work will be
 paid in accordance with Article 560-4 for Shoulder Borrow. No payment will be made for the
 removal and disposal of any surplus material remaining in the stockpile after the shoulders
 have been completed.

 Failure of the Contractor to cover the lime-treated soil as required will result in the Engineer
 notifying the Contractor in writing to cover the lime-treated soil with a sand seal. Apply the
 sand seal in accordance with Section 660, except Articles 660-3 and 660-12 will not apply. If
 the Contractor fails to apply the sand seal within 72 hours after receipt of such notice, the
 Engineer may proceed to have such work performed by other forces and equipment. The
 application of the sand seal by the Contractor or other forces will in no way relieve the
 Contractor of the responsibility to maintain or repair the damaged stabilization, no matter
 what the cause of damage, at no cost to the Department.

 When the Contractor has brought the soil layer to the elevation required by the plans, the
 Engineer will sample the soil and determine the quantity of lime to be incorporated.
 Allow 24 calendar days for the Engineer to perform the required sampling, testing and
 final design of the lime stabilization. The optimum moisture will be determined by the
 Engineer.
 
 38
 39
 40
 
 Spread lime or lime slurry only on an area of such size that all primary mixing operations
 can be completed in the same day during daylight hours, except where the work is to be
 done at night as required by the contract.
 
 41
 42
 43
 
 Incorporate the lime or lime slurry into the soil mixture at the rates determined by the
 Engineer. Distribute the lime at the uniform rate and minimize the scattering by the
 wind. Mix the lime into the soil within 2 hours after application.

 No equipment, except that used in spreading, slaking and mixing, will be allowed to pass
 over the freshly spread lime until it is mixed with the soil.
 (B) Slurry Method
 
 4
 5

 Do not add lime slurry to the soil when the moisture content exceeds 2% above optimum
 moisture. Aerate soil or allow to dry naturally until the soil contains no more than
 2% above optimum moisture.
 
 7
 8
 9
 10
 11
 12
 
 Mix hydrated lime applied by this method with water in approved agitating equipment
 and apply to the soil to be treated as a thin water suspension or slurry. When quicklime is
 used to produce the slurry, use equipment specifically manufactured for the slaking of
 quicklime. Use distributing equipment that provides continuous agitation of the slurry
 from the slurry production site until the slurry is applied to the soil. Proportion the lime
 so that the dry solids content is at least 30% by weight.
 
 13
 14
 15
 
 Split the lime application into approximately 2 equal applications with the first being
 partially mixed into the soil to a minimum depth of 3 inches before applying the second
 application.
 
 16
 
 (C) Quicklime
 
 17
 18
 19
 
 Do not add dry quicklime to the soil when the moisture content exceeds 4% above
 optimum moisture. Aerate soil or allow to dry naturally until it contains no more than
 4% above optimum moisture.
 
 20
 21
 22
 23
 
 Where the “Bottom-Dump” method of application is used, omit the preliminary
 scarification of the soil surface. Apply the quicklime by slowly driving the tanker truck
 over the coverage area with the bottom discharge valves open creating a windrow of
 quicklime.
 
 24
 25
 26
 27
 
 Repeat the process until the tanker is empty in order to provide at least 3, for a 24 foot
 roadway, reasonably uniform and equally spaced windrows over the area being
 stabilized. The number of windrows required will depend on the width of the section
 being stabilized and will be stipulated by the Engineer.
 
 28
 29
 
 Carefully spread the windrows of quicklime with a motor grader into an equal depth layer
 over the entire area to be stabilized.
 
 30
 31
 32
 33
 
 After the lime has been spread, follow with a sprinkling of water to slake the lime. After
 a complete slaking of the lime, thoroughly mix the lime with the soil. The Engineer may
 direct that the lime first be mixed into the soil followed by sprinkling and additional
 mixing to ensure complete slaking of the lime throughout the layer to be stabilized.
 
 34
 35
 36
 
 (D) Hydrated Lime
 Use hydrated lime only with written permission and do not add to the soil when the
 moisture content exceeds 6% above optimum moisture.

 MIXING
 
 Immediately after the lime has been spread and slaked, if required, mix the lime into the
 soil for the full depth of treatment. Mix the lime into the soil to provide a compacted
 depth of at least 8 inches. A minimum number of mixing passes will be required to
 ensure uniform incorporation of the lime. Add water as necessary and thoroughly mix
 with the soil lime mixture so that the mixture contains no less than optimum moisture.
 A tolerance of 3% above optimum will be allowed. Incorporate all of the lime
 thoroughly and uniformly into the soil layer to the full depth of treatment so that the
 result is a homogeneous, friable mixture of soil and lime, free of clods or lumps
 exceeding 2 inches in size.

 Following primary mixing operations, cure the stabilized layer for 1 to 4 days. The
 actual duration of this curing period will be determined by the Engineer. During the
 curing period, keep the surface of the material moist to prevent drying and cracking and
 maintain in a properly sealed and crowned condition. Mix, compact, shape and finish the
 stabilized layer no later than 4 days after primary mixing.
 (C) Final Mixing and Pulverizing
 
 11
 12
 13
 14
 15
 
 Immediately after the completion of the preliminary curing period, mix and pulverize
 completely the stabilized layer to the full depth of the stabilization. Continue the final
 mixing until all of the clods are broken down to pass a 1/2 inch sieve and at least 80%
 pass a No. 4 sieve, exclusive of rock. Add water, as required, during the final mixing to
 raise the moisture content before compaction.

 20
 21
 22
 23
 
 Begin compaction of the mixture immediately after completion of the final mixing operations.
 Aerate or moisten the mixture as necessary during compaction operations to maintain the
 moisture between optimum and optimum plus 2%. Compact the full depth of the mixture to
 a density equal to at least 97% of that obtained by compacting a sample of the soil lime
 mixture in accordance with AASHTO T 99 as modified by the Department. Copies of these
 modified procedures are available upon request from Materials and Tests Unit. Accompany
 the compaction with sufficient blading to eliminate irregularities.
 
 24
 25
 
 Perform the final rolling of the completed surface with a pneumatic-tired roller or if permitted
 a smooth, steel-wheel roller.
 
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
 
 Complete shaping, final mixing, compacting and finishing on the same day upon completion
 of the preliminary curing. This work is to be completed no later than 4 days after primary
 mixing and done during daylight hours, unless otherwise provided in the contract. If the
 above work is not completed as specified, rip up the entire section and add additional lime, as
 directed, at no additional cost to the Department.
 
 31
 
 501-11 THICKNESS
 
 32
 33
 34
 35
 
 The compacted thickness of the completed treated soil layer will be determined by
 measurements made in test holes located at random intervals not to exceed 500 feet. Do not
 deviate the measured thickness from that shown on the plans by more than plus 1 inch or
 minus 1/2 inch.
 
 36
 37
 38
 
 Where the lime-treated soil layer is deficient in thickness by more than 1/2 inch, remove and
 replace the area of deficient thickness with lime-treated soil having the required thickness at
 no cost to the Department.
 
 39
 40
 41
 
 As an exception to the above, if the deficiency is not considered sufficient to seriously impair
 the required strength of the lime-treated soil layer, the deficient area may, at the discretion of
 the Engineer, be left in place.
 
 42
 
 501-12 FINAL CURING
 
 43
 44
 
 After the lime-treated soil has been finished in accordance with Article 501-10, protect it
 against drying for a 7 day curing period in accordance with Section 543.

 Maintain the lime-treated soil in an acceptable condition until final acceptance of the project.
 Include immediate repair of any defects or damage in maintenance operations. Repeat as
 necessary to keep the lime-treated soil in an acceptable condition. Perform repairs to
 lime-treated soil by replacing the lime-treated soil for its full depth rather than by adding
 a thin layer of lime stabilized material to the existing layer. An alternate repair method may
 be used if approved in writing.

 19
 
 Lime-Treated Soil will be measured and paid as the number of square yards of each layer of
 lime-treated soil that has been completed and accepted. In determining this quantity, the
 width of the lime-treated soil will be measured across the top surface of the treated layer. The
 length will be the actual length constructed, measured along the centerline of the surface of
 the treated layer.

 Lime for Lime-Treated Soil where hydrated lime or quick lime is spread directly on the soil in
 solid form or when hydrated lime is used to produce a slurry, the quantity of lime to be paid
 will be the number of tons of lime that has been incorporated into the soil at the required rates.
 No measurement will be made of any lime added or replaced for corrective measures during
 construction or for repairing damaged areas. Measurement is to be made in bulk in the truck
 on certified platform scales or other certified weighting devices.

 Place the aggregate material on the subgrade with a mechanical spreader box capable of
 placing the material to a uniform loose depth and without segregation; except, for areas
 inaccessible to a mechanical spreader box, the aggregate material may be placed by other
 methods approved by the Engineer. In addition, as approved by the Engineer, place by end
 dumping aggregate on approved sandy subgrade soils to provide a working platform and
 reduce wheel rutting of the subgrade. When allowed, end dumping will be limited to a
 uniformly spread thickness of 2 to 3 inches prior to placing the remaining aggregate thickness
 with a mechanical spreader box.

 Failure by the Contractor to cover the base course as required above will result in the
 Engineer notifying the Contractor in writing to cover the base course with a sand seal and to
 suspend the operations of placing aggregate base course until such cover has been placed. If
 the Contractor fails to apply the sand seal within 72 hours after receipt of such notice, the
 Engineer may proceed to have such work performed with other forces and equipment.
 The application of the sand seal by the Contractor or by others will in no way relieve the
 Contractor of the responsibility to maintain or repair the damaged base or subgrade, no matter
 what the cause of damage.

 Do not allow traffic on the completed base course other than necessary local traffic and that
 developing from the operation of essential construction equipment as may be authorized by
 the Engineer. Repair any defects that develop in the completed base or any damage caused by
 local or construction traffic acceptably. Hauling equipment may be operated with the
 approval of the Engineer, over a lower layer of base, however, acceptably repair any rutting,
 weaving or soft areas that develop.
 
 15
 
 Do not exceed 35 mph with hauling equipment traveling over any part of the base.
 
 16
 17

 19
 20
 21
 
 Use methods of handling, hauling and placing which will minimize segregation and
 contamination. If segregation occurs, the Engineer may require that changes to the
 Contractor's methods and may require mixing on the road to correct segregation. Remove and
 replace all aggregate which is contaminated with foreign materials to the extent that the base
 course will not adequately serve its intended use. The above requirements will be applicable
 regardless of the type of aggregate placed and regardless of prior acceptance.
 
 22

 Where visual observation indicates the need to do so, the Engineer may require the Contractor
 to road mix areas of nonuniform gradation. The Engineer reserves the right to take samples in
 addition to the lot acceptance samples from within the lot in areas exhibiting nonuniform
 gradation. When the test results from such an additional sample is outside the gradation limits
 in Section 1010 and the nonuniformity cannot be corrected by road mixing, the aggregate base
 course represented by the sample will be rejected and replaced by the Contractor.

 Machine and compact the layer of base within 48 hours after beginning the placing of a layer
 of the base. Maintain each layer to the required cross section during compaction and compact
 each layer to the required density before placing the next layer.
 
 35
 36
 37
 38
 39
 
 Compact the base material at a moisture content which is approximately that required to
 produce a maximum density. Dry or add moisture to the material when required to provide a
 uniformly compacted and acceptable base. If it is necessary to add water after the material is
 placed, scarify the material and add water uniformly throughout the full depth of the layer of
 the base course material. Density determination will be based on Article 520-9.

 When electing to use conventional density test number 3 (ring test) to determine density,
 compact each layer of the base to a density equal to at least 100% of that obtained by
 compacting a sample of the material in accordance with AASHTO T 180 as modified by
 the Department. Information on these modified testing procedures are available in the
 NCDOT Conventional Density Operator’s Manual on line in the Materials and Tests
 Unit’s web site.

 Unit, samples of all aggregates proposed for use at least 3 weeks before beginning
 production. Take the aggregate samples in the presence of the Engineer. Submit in
 writing the proposed gradation for the cement-treated base material. The Department
 will then prepare a mix design based upon the samples submitted and the Contractor's
 stated proposed gradation.

 Thoroughly mix the cement, aggregates and water in an approved central mixing
 plant. Use a batch or continuous-flow type stationary mixer and equip it with
 feeding and metering devices that will add aggregate, cement and water into the
 mixer in the specified quantity. Use batch weights or rates of feed of cement
 that are within 0.3% of the quantity designated by the Engineer. Use batch
 weights or rates of flow of water that are within a range of optimum to optimum
 plus 1.5% moisture. Use batch weights or rates of feed of aggregate that are
 within 5% of the amounts designated by the Engineer.

 Calibrate and mark cement storage silos so that the amount of cement in the silo
 can be readily determined at any time. Design feeders and/or meters for
 introducing the cement into the mixer such that the amount of cement can be
 accurately determined before it is introduced into the mixer. Use a variable
 speed motor on the cement feeder which is regulated by a control mechanism
 indicating the speed of the motor in r.p.m. or equivalent measure. Design the
 indicator so that it can be read in daylight from a point 4 feet from the indicator.
 Equip the cement holding tank which is used in feeding cement with an air
 pressure gauge and air pressure regulating control such that air pressure can be
 regulated to a uniform flow.
 
 12
 13
 14
 15
 16
 
 Measure the water by a meter which determines flow in gallons per minute and
 control it with 2 valves. Use a variable flow valve for controlling the rate of
 flow of the water only on one valve and use an on-off valve connected to the
 plant controls such that the water is turned on and/or off when the plant is
 started and stopped for the other valve.

 After the material has been processed by the pug mill, store it in a holding bin
 with the minimum capacity of 3 tons before discharging into trucks. Hold the
 material in the holding bin for loading purposes only and do not store for
 loading subsequent trucks. Loading trucks directly from a belt or auger box will
 not be permitted.

 Have available a satisfactory platform for obtaining samples from trucks. Make
 provisions for calibrating the plant daily and at other times as deemed necessary
 by the Engineer. On plants that are electronically controlled, manual calibration
 will be required to verify the electronic calibration and shall be performed at the
 beginning of a project. If the plant operation is interrupted by more than
 4 calendar days during an active project, perform the manual calibration process
 again. Perform random manual calibrations at the direction of the Engineer.
 
 29
 
 (2) Hauling and Placing
 
 30
 31
 32
 
 Haul the mixed base material to the roadway in trucks with protective covers to
 avoid moisture loss. Do not exceed one hour between the loading of the haul trucks
 and the beginning of compaction.
 
 33
 
 Place stringlines for alignment control for placing a layer of base.
 
 34
 35
 36
 37
 38
 39
 
 Place the base in a uniform layer on the moistened, prepared subgrade to produce the
 depth required by the plans. To insure homogenous distribution of the base material
 in each layer, place the material using approved spreaders. Perform the spreading
 operations to eliminate pockets of material of non-uniform gradation resulting from
 segregation in the hauling or discharging operations. Spread each layer so that
 compaction can be started without further shaping.
 
 40
 41
 42
 43
 
 A single spreader may be used provided it is capable of placing a uniform, full-depth
 layer of material across the full width of the base in one pass. Otherwise, 2 or more
 spreaders will be required and operate the spreaders so that the spreading progresses
 along the full width of the base in a uniform manner.
 
 44
 45
 46
 47
 48
 
 Base placed on areas inaccessible to mechanical spreading equipment may be spread
 in one layer by approved methods. After spreading, compact the material thoroughly
 to the required lines, grades and typical sections by means of pneumatic tampers or
 with other compaction equipment which will constantly obtain the degree of
 compaction required.

 Use any combination of machines or equipment that will produce the required results
 meeting the approval of the Engineer. Use a cement spreader which has
 an adjustable rate of flow and the capability of spreading the required amount of
 cement in one pass. Mix cement, aggregate and water with a self-propelled rotary
 mixer capable of mixing to a depth of 10 inches. Correct any leakage of fluids
 and/or materials promptly or the Engineer may order such equipment removed and
 replaced with satisfactory equipment. Use equipment and methods for applying
 cement, water, curing seal and blotting sand that does not damage the base and in
 accordance with Article 107-21.

 Place the required quantity of aggregate on the prepared subgrade in a uniform layer.
 Spread aggregate on the subgrade in advance of the mixing operations only to the
 extent that processing can be completed within one week. Apply the required
 quantity of cement in a uniform spread on the aggregate in place and immediately
 blend the aggregate until the cement is uniformly distributed throughout the
 aggregate. Maintain the moisture content at or below the optimum moisture at the
 time of application of the cement. Do not apply cement on excessively windy days
 and apply only to such an area that all operations shall be completed on the same day
 during daylight hours.
 
 22
 
 The Engineer will establish the actual cement content during construction.
 
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 
 Immediately after the aggregate and cement have been thoroughly blended, apply
 water as needed and incorporate into the mixture. Control the application of the
 water so that there is no excessive concentration on or near the surface of the
 mixture. After the necessary water has been applied, continue mixing until
 a thorough and uniform mixture is obtained.
 
 28
 29
 30
 31
 
 Maintain the moisture content at the time of final mixing and during compaction
 within a range of optimum to optimum plus 1.5% as determined. Make sure that the
 moisture content in the mix does not exceed the quantity that will cause the base
 course to become unstable during compaction or finishing operations.

 Accomplish compaction by the use of approved self-propelled rollers, except do not use
 a sheep-foot roller for more than 2 passes. Compact the base by the use of approved
 self-propelled rollers to a density equal to at least 97% of the maximum density obtained by
 compacting a sample of the material in accordance with AASHTO T 180 as modified by the
 Department. Copies of these modified testing procedures are available upon request from the
 Materials and Tests Unit. The Engineer may, at his option, utilize nuclear methods as
 described in the NCDOT Nuclear Density Testing Manual – Base Course, FDR and Select
 Materials to determine the density of the base instead of the methods required above. Copies
 of this manual are available upon request from the Materials and Tests Unit.
 
 48

 The work covered by this section consists of constructing and curing a soil-cement base by
 treating the subgrade, existing subbase or existing base, or any combination of these
 materials, by pulverizing, adding Portland cement, adding aggregate when required, mixing,
 wetting and compacting the mixture to the required density. Proportion, spread and mix the
 materials on the roadway; manipulate, compact and finish in accordance with the Standard
 Specifications and the lines, grades, depths and typical sections shown on the plans or
 established by the Engineer.

 Do not construct soil-cement base that will not be covered with a layer of base or pavement
 by December 1st of the same year. Failure of the Contractor to cover the soil-cement base as
 required above will result in the Engineer notifying the Contractor in writing to cover the
 soil-cement base with a sand seal. Apply the sand seal in accordance with Section 660 except
 Articles 660-3 and 660-12 will not apply. If the Contractor fails to apply the sand seal within
 72 hours after a receipt of such notice, the Engineer may proceed to have the work performed
 with other forces and equipment. The application of the sand seal by the Contractor or other
 forces will in no way relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to maintain or repair the
 damaged base, no matter what the cause of damage.

 Use self-propelled compaction equipment. Accomplish finish rolling with a pneumatictire roller or if permitted by the Engineer, a smooth steel-wheel roller.
 (F) Scarifying Equipment
 
 35
 36
 37
 38
 
 Use a grader-scarifier for the initial scarification of the soil. Use equipment capable of
 scarifying the soil to the full depth of the stabilized treatment. When required by the
 Engineer, use a weeder, spiketooth harrow or nail drag, followed by a broom drag when
 scarifying during finishing operations.

 542-7
 
 APPLICATION OF CEMENT
 
 7
 8
 9
 10
 11
 
 When the Contractor has brought the subgrade to the elevation required by the plans, the
 Engineer will sample the soil to be stabilized in order to determine the quantity of cement to
 be incorporated. Incorporate 24 calendar days into the schedule to allow the Engineer
 sufficient time to perform the required sampling, testing and final design of the cement
 stabilization.
 
 12
 
 Before spreading cement, aggregate shall be spread at the rate shown in the plans.
 
 13
 14
 15
 
 Incorporate cement into the mix at the rate directed by the Engineer. Uniformly spread the
 quantity of cement required for the full depth of treatment over the surface in one pass. Do
 not apply cement on excessively wet grade or on windy days.
 
 16
 17
 18
 19
 
 Apply cement to the soil when the percentage of moisture in the soil material is the correct
 amount that assures a uniform mixture of soil material and cement during the mixing
 operation. Do not exceed the optimum moisture content established by the Engineer for the
 soil cement moisture except by permission.
 
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 
 The optimum moisture content and density will be determined in the field by a moisturedensity test on representative samples of soil-cement mixture; however, preliminary moisturedensity values may be determined by laboratory tests using soils from the project. Moisture
 content will be determined by the Engineer in accordance with standard test procedures used
 by the Department.
 
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 
 Apply cement only to such an area that all operations shall be completed in the same day
 during daylight hours. Complete finishing the soil-cement mix within 4 hours of adding water
 to the soil-cement mixture. No equipment, except that used in spreading and mixing, will be
 allowed to pass over the freshly spread cement until it is mixed with the soil. Replace all
 spread cement that has been displaced before mixing is started.
 
 30
 
 542-8
 
 31
 32
 33
 34
 
 Immediately after the cement has been spread, mix it with the loosened soil material for the
 full depth of the treatment until a homogenous and uniform mixture is produced. Mixing will
 be sufficient when 100% of the mixture passes a 1/2 inch sieve and at least 80% passes
 a No. 4 sieve, exclusive of any aggregate.
 
 35
 36
 37
 38
 39
 40
 41
 42
 43
 44
 
 Immediately after mixing the soil and cement, add any additional water that is necessary to
 bring the moisture content between optimum and optimum plus 2% as determined by the
 Engineer. If moisture content exceeds the specified range, the soil-cement mixture may, if
 approved by the Engineer, be manipulated by remixing or blading to reduce the moisture
 content to within the specified range. Avoid excessive concentrations of water as well as wet
 spots or streaks on or near the surface. After all mixing water has been applied, continue
 mixing until a uniform mixture is obtained at the required moisture content. Perform the
 operations of cement spreading, water application and mixing so that they result in a uniform
 soil, cement and water mixture for the full depth and width of the area being treated. Remix
 any soil and cement mixture that has not been compacted and finished within 30 minutes.
 
 45
 
 542-9
 
 46
 47
 48
 49
 
 Begin compaction of the mixture immediately after the mixing operation is completed. At the
 start of compaction, make sure that the moisture in the mixture is no more than 2% above or
 below the optimum moisture content and is less than the quantity which will cause the soilcement mixture to become unstable during compaction and finishing. Compact the mixture to

 Before compaction, prepare the mixture in a loose condition for its full depth. Compact the
 loose mixture uniformly to the specified density. During the compaction operations, initial
 shaping may be required to obtain uniform compaction and required grade and cross section.

 If necessary, lightly scarify the surface to remove any tire imprints or smooth surfaces left by
 equipment. Continue compaction until a uniform and adequate density is obtained.
 
 13

 Perform the compaction and finishing to produce a dense surface free of compaction planes,
 cracks, ridges or loose material.

 17
 
 542-11 THICKNESS
 
 18
 19
 20
 21
 
 The compacted thickness of the completed soil-cement base will be determined by
 measurements made in test holes located at random intervals not to exceed 500 feet.
 Construct the soil-cement base so that the measured thickness does not deviate from that
 shown on the plans by more than + 1 inch or - 1/2 inch.
 
 22
 23
 
 Where the base is deficient in thickness by more than 1/2 inch, remove and replace the area of
 deficient base with base of the required thickness.
 
 24
 25
 26
 
 As an exception to the above, if the deficiency is not considered sufficient to seriously impair
 the required strength of the soil-cement base, the deficient area may, at the discretion of the
 Engineer, be left in place.

 Continuously moisten the finished stabilized layer or base course until the asphalt curing seal
 is placed. Place the curing seal as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after
 completing finishing operations except where delayed by wet weather. If wet weather delays
 application of the curing seal, apply the curing seal as soon as the surface becomes
 sufficiently dry.
 
 13
 14
 15
 16
 17
 
 At the time the asphalt curing seal is applied, prepare the surface of the stabilized layer or
 base so that it is free of all loose or extraneous material and contains sufficient moisture to
 prevent excessive penetration of the asphalt material. If deemed necessary, sweep the base
 surface clean of loose material before applying the curing seal. Apply the curing seal in
 accordance with Section 600.
 
 18
 19
 20
 
 Apply the asphalt material to the surface of the completed stabilized layer or base at a target
 rate of 0.14 +/- 0.04 gal/sy with approved equipment. Apply the asphalt material at the exact
 rate and temperature of application as established by the Engineer.
 
 21
 22
 23
 
 Cure the underlying materials for 7 curing days. Curing time will be counted in at least
 1/2 day units and only when the air temperature measured at the location of the operation is at
 least 50°F. Complete the curing before placement of subsequent layers of pavement.
 
 24
 25
 26
 27
 
 Maintain the curing material during the curing period so that all of the stabilized layer or base
 will be covered effectively during the period. Provide sufficient protection from freezing to
 the stabilized layer or base during the entire curing period and until it has hardened. Replace
 excessive loss of curing seal caused by heavy rains within 8 hours of placement.
 
 28

 exclusively for pavement milling operations and with sufficient power, traction and stability
 to accurately maintain depth of cut and slope. Use milling machines equipped with
 an electronic control system that will automatically control the longitudinal profile and cross
 slope of the milled pavement surface. Accomplish this through the use of a mobile grade
 reference, an erected string line, joint matching shoe, slope control systems or a combination
 of approved methods. Use an erected fixed stringline when required by the contract.
 Otherwise, use a mobile grade reference system capable of averaging the existing grade or
 pavement profile over at least 30 feet. Use either a non-contacting laser or sonar type ski
 systems with at least 4 referencing stations mounted on the milling machine at a length of at
 least 24 feet. Coordinate the position of the grade control system such that the grade sensor is
 at the approximate midpoint of the mobile reference system. Use a machine capable of
 leaving a uniform surface suitable for handling traffic without damage to the underlying
 pavement structure. Use a milling machine and other loading equipment capable of loading
 milled material to be used in other parts of the work without segregation.

 Include in the QC process the preliminary inspections, plant calibrations and field
 verification of the mix and JMF in accordance with the Asphalt QMS Manual. Obtain all
 scheduled samples at randomly selected locations in accordance with the Asphalt QMS
 Manual. Log all samples taken on forms provided by the Department. Split and retain
 all samples taken in accordance with the Asphalt QMS Manual. Provide documentation
 as required in Subarticle 609-8. Identify any additional QC samples taken and tested on
 the appropriate forms. Process control test results shall not be plotted on control charts
 nor reported to the QA Laboratory.
 
 16
 17
 
 Retain and store all samples in accordance with the requirements of Section 7.5 of the
 Asphalt QMS Manual.
 
 18
 
 (B) Required Sampling and Testing Frequencies
 
 19
 20
 21
 22
 
 Maintain minimum test frequencies as established in the schedule below. Complete all
 tests within 24 hours of the time the sample is taken, unless specified otherwise within
 these provisions. If the specified tests will not be completed within the required time
 frame, cease production at that point until such time the tests are completed.
 
 23
 24
 25
 
 If the Contractor’s testing frequency fails to meet the minimum frequency requirements
 as specified, all mix without the specified test representation will be unsatisfactory. The
 Engineer will evaluate if the mix may remain in place in accordance with Article 105-3.
 
 26
 27
 
 Sample and test the completed mixture from each JMF at the following minimum
 frequency during mix production:
 Accumulative Production Increment
 750 tons

 If production is discontinued or interrupted before the accumulative production increment
 tonnage is completed, continue the increment on the next production day(s) until the
 increment tonnage is completed. Obtain a random sample within the specified increment
 at the location determined in accordance with the Asphalt QMS Manual. Conduct
 QC testing on each random sample in accordance with Section 7.3 of the Asphalt QMS
 Manual. When daily production of each mix design exceeds 100 tons and a regularly
 scheduled full test series on a sample from a random sample location for that JMF does
 not occur during that day’s production, perform at least one partial test series in
 accordance with Section 7.3 of the Asphalt QMS Manual. These partial test series and
 associated tests do not substitute for the regularly scheduled random sample for that
 increment.
 (C) Control Charts
 
 40
 41
 42
 43
 
 Maintain standardized control charts furnished by the Department at the field laboratory.
 For mix incorporated into the project, record full test series data from all regularly
 scheduled random samples or directed samples that replace regularly scheduled random
 samples, on control charts the same day the test results are obtained.
 
 44
 45
 
 Record QC sample data on the standardized control charts in accordance with Section 7.4
 of the Asphalt QMS Manual.
 
 46
 
 Maintain a continuous moving average with the following exceptions.
 6-9
 
 Section 609
 1
 
 Re-establish a new moving average only when:
 
 2
 
 (1) A change in the binder percentage, aggregate blend or Gmm is made on the JMF, or
 
 3
 4
 5
 
 (2) When the Contractor elects to stop or is required to stop production after one or two
 moving average values, respectively, fall outside the moving average limits as
 outlined in Table 609-1, or
 
 6
 7
 8
 
 (3) Failure to stop production after 2 consecutive moving averages exceed the moving
 average limits occurs, but production does stop at a subsequent time, re-establish
 a new moving average beginning at the actual production stop point.
 
 9
 10
 11
 
 In these cases, re-establish the moving averages for all mix properties. Moving averages
 will not be re-established when production stoppage occurs due to an individual test
 result exceeding the individual test limits or the Standard Specifications.
 
 12
 13
 14
 15
 16
 17
 18
 
 All individual test results for regularly scheduled random samples or directed samples
 that replace regularly scheduled samples are part of the plant QC record and shall be
 included in moving average calculations with the following exception. When the
 Contractor’s testing data has been proven incorrect, use the correct data as determined by
 the Engineer instead of the Contractor’s data to determine the appropriate pay factor in
 accordance with Section 7021 of the Asphalt QMS Manual. In this case, replace the data
 in question and any related data proven incorrect.
 
 19
 
 (D) Control Limits
 
 20
 21
 22
 
 Establish control limits for mix production in accordance with Table 609-1. Control
 limits for the moving average limits are based on a moving average of the last 4 data
 points. Apply all control limits to the applicable target source.

 26
 27
 28
 
 All required corrective actions are based upon initial test results and shall be taken
 immediately upon obtaining those results. If more than one corrective action or
 adjustment applies, give precedence to the more severe of these actions. Stopping
 production when required takes precedence over all other corrective actions. Document
 all corrective actions.
 
 29
 30
 31
 
 If the process adjustment improves the property in question such that the moving average
 after 4 additional tests is on or within the moving average limits, the Contractor may
 continue production.
 
 6-10
 
 Section 609
 1
 
 When any of the following occur, production of a mix shall cease immediately:
 
 2
 3
 4
 
 (1) An individual test result for a mix control criteria (including results for required
 partial test series on mix) exceeds both the individual test control limits and the
 applicable specification design criteria, or
 
 5
 6
 
 (2) Two consecutive field TSR values fail to meet the minimum specification
 requirement, or
 
 7
 
 (3) Two consecutive binder content test results exceed the individual limits, or
 
 8
 9
 
 (4) Two consecutive moving average values for any one of the mix control criteria fall
 outside the moving average limits.
 
 10
 
 Do not resume normal plant production until one of the following has occurred.
 
 11
 
 Option 1: Approval has been granted by the appropriate QA supervisor.
 
 12
 13
 14
 15
 16
 
 Option 2: The mix in question has been satisfactorily verified in accordance with
 Section 7.4 of the Asphalt QMS Manual. Normal production may resume
 based on the approval of the contractor’s Level II technician, provided
 notification and the verification test results have been furnished to the QA
 Laboratory.
 
 17
 18
 19
 
 Failure to fully comply with any of the above corrective actions will result in immediate
 production stoppage by the Engineer. Normal production shall not resume until
 a complete verification process has been performed and approved by the Engineer.
 
 20
 21
 22
 
 Failure to stop production when required will make all mix unacceptable from the stop
 point tonnage to the point when Option 1 or Option 2 occurs or to the tonnage point when
 production is actually stopped, whichever occurs first.
 
 23
 24
 25
 
 In any case, remove and replace this mix with materials that comply with the Standard
 Specifications, unless otherwise approved. The Engineer will evaluate acceptance of the
 mix in question based on Articles 105-3 and 609-11.
 
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 
 Immediately notify the Engineer when any moving average value exceeds the moving
 average limit. If two consecutive moving average values for any one of the mix control
 criteria fall outside the moving average limits, immediately cease production of that mix
 and make adjustments. The Contractor may elect to stop production after only one
 moving average value falls outside the moving average limits. In either case, do not
 determine a new moving average until the fourth test after the elective or mandatory stop
 in production.
 
 33
 
 (F) Allowable Resampling and Retesting for Mix Deficiencies
 
 34
 35
 36
 37
 
 The Contractor shall resample and retest for plant mix deficiencies when warranted as
 outlined in Section 7.19 of the Asphalt QMS Manual. Perform the retesting within
 10 days after initial test results are determined. Retests for any mix deficiency other than
 as listed below will not be allowed, unless otherwise permitted.
 
 38
 39
 
 The Department reserves the right to require the Contractor to resample and retest at any
 time or location as directed.

 Perform QC of the compaction process in accordance with these provisions and
 applicable requirements of Article 610-10. The Contractor may elect to use either
 pavement core samples or density gauge readings as the method of density control.
 Provide to the Department at the pre-construction conference the method of density QC
 that will be used on the project.
 
 8
 9
 10
 
 Establish acceptable control strips when required at locations approved by the Engineer
 and in accordance with the Asphalt QMS Manual. In addition, place control strips
 anytime deemed necessary by the Engineer.
 
 11
 12
 
 Perform density sampling and testing on all pavements as outlined in Sections 10.4 and
 10.6 of the Asphalt QMS Manual unless otherwise approved.
 
 13
 14
 15
 16
 
 Perform the sampling and testing at the minimum test frequencies as specified. If the
 density testing frequency fails to meet the minimum frequency as specified, all mix
 without the required density test representation will be unsatisfactory. The Engineer will
 evaluate if the mix may remain in place in accordance with Article 105-3.
 
 17
 
 (B) Limited Production Procedures
 
 18
 19
 20
 
 Define “resurfacing” as the first new uniform layer placed on an existing pavement.
 Proceed on limited production when, for the same mix type and on the same contract, one
 of the following conditions occur (except as noted below).
 
 21
 
 (1) Two consecutive failing lots, except on resurfacing,
 
 22
 
 (2) Three consecutive failing lots on resurfacing, or
 
 23
 
 (3) Two consecutive failing density gauge control strips.
 
 24
 25
 26
 27
 
 As exceptions to the above, pavement within each construction category (New and
 Other), as defined in Section 10.3.3 of the Asphalt QMS Manual, and pavement placed
 simultaneously by multiple paving crews will be evaluated independently for limited
 production purposes.
 
 28
 29
 30
 
 Limited production is defined as the production, placement and compaction of a
 sufficient quantity of mix to construct a 300 feet control strip plus 100 feet of pavement
 adjacent to each end of the control strip.
 
 31
 32
 33
 34
 35
 36
 37
 38
 
 Remain on limited production until such time as satisfactory density results are attained
 or until two control strips have been attempted without achieving acceptable density test
 results. If the Contractor fails to achieve satisfactory density after two control strips have
 been attempted, cease production of that mix type until such time as the cause of the
 failing density test results can be determined. As an exception, the Engineer may grant
 approval to produce a different mix design of the same mix type if Quality Control and
 Quality Assurance plant mix test indicate the failing densities are attributed to the mix
 problem(s) rather than compaction related problems and limited production startup would
 6-12
 
 Section 609
 1
 2
 
 not be required. The determination of whether a mix problem exists at this time will be
 made by QA personnel.
 
 3
 4
 5
 6
 
 If the Contractor does not operate by the limited production procedures when conditions
 as specified in Section 10.9 of the Asphalt QMS Manual, all mix produced thereafter will
 be unacceptable. Remove this material and replace with material that complies with the
 Standard Specifications, at no additional cost to the Department.
 
 7
 
 609-8
 
 CONTRACTOR QUALITY CONTROL DOCUMENTATION (RECORDS)
 
 8
 9
 10
 11
 12
 
 Document all QC activities, records of inspection, samples taken, adjustments to the mix and
 test results on a daily basis. Note the results of observations and records of inspection as they
 occur in a permanent field record. Record adjustment to mix production and test results on
 forms provided. Process control sample test results are for the Contractor’s informational
 purposes only.
 
 13
 14
 15
 16
 17
 18
 19
 
 Make all such records available to the Engineer, upon request, at any time during project
 construction. Complete and maintain all QC records and forms and distribute in accordance
 with the Asphalt QMS Manual. Submit data electronically using the Department’s software.
 Failure to maintain QC records and forms as required, or to provide these records and forms
 to the Engineer upon request, may result in production stoppage, placement stoppage, removal
 from the NCDOT Certified Asphalt Laboratory List and removal from the NCDOT Certified
 Asphalt Plant List until the problem is resolved.

 Falsification of test results, documentation of observations, records of inspection, adjustments
 to the process, discarding of samples and/or test results or any other deliberate
 misrepresentation of the facts will result in the revocation of the applicable person’s
 QMS certification. The Engineer will determine acceptability of the mix and/or pavement
 represented by the falsified results or documentation. If the mix and/or pavement in question
 is determined to be acceptable, the Engineer may allow the mix to remain in place at no pay
 for the mix, asphalt binder and other mix components. If the mix or pavement represented by
 the falsified results is determined not to be acceptable, remove and replace with mix that
 complies with the Standard Specifications.
 
 29
 
 609-9
 
 30
 31
 32
 
 The Department's QA program will be conducted by a certified QMS technician(s) and will
 be accomplished based on the requirements of Section 7.60 for mix and Sections 10.5 and
 10.7 for density in the Asphalt QMS Manual.
 
 33
 34
 
 Differences between the Contractor's and the Department's split sample test results will be
 acceptable if within the limits of precision in Table 609-3.

 The Engineer will periodically witness the sampling and testing being performed by the
 Contractor. If the Engineer observes that the sampling and QC tests are not being
 performed in accordance with the applicable test procedures, the Engineer may stop
 production until corrective action is taken. The Engineer will promptly notify the
 Contractor of observed deficiencies, both verbally and in writing. The Engineer will
 document all witnessed samples and tests.

 Prepare the asphalt mix design using a mixture of coarse and fine aggregate, asphalt
 binder, mineral filler and other additives when required. Size, uniformly grade and
 combine the several aggregate fractions in such proportions that the resulting mixture
 meets the grading and physical requirements of the Specifications for the specified mix
 type. Materials that will not produce a mixture within the design criteria required by the
 Specifications will be rejected, unless otherwise approved.
 
 9
 10
 11
 12
 13
 
 At least 10 days before start of asphalt mix production, submit the mix design and
 proposed JMF targets for each required mix type and combination of aggregates to the
 Engineer for review and approval. Prepare the mix design using a Department certified
 mix design technician in an approved mix design laboratory and in accordance with the
 procedures outlined in Section 4.5 of the Asphalt QMS Manual.
 
 14
 15
 
 For the final surface layer of the specified mix type, use a mix design with an aggregate
 blend gradation above the maximum density line on the 2.36 mm and larger sieves.
 
 16
 17
 18
 19
 
 The Contractor has the option to use a recycled plant mix in lieu of virgin plant mix.
 However, all provisions of the Specifications for virgin mixes apply to recycled mixes.
 This means that the same design criteria tests, test frequencies, and quality control
 requirements will apply.
 
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 25
 
 Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) or Reclaimed Asphalt Shingles (RAS) may be
 incorporated into asphalt plant mixes in accordance with Article 1012-1 and the
 following applicable requirements. However, use of RAP materials is not allowed in
 Open Graded Friction Course (OGFC) mixes or Ultra-Thin Bonded Wearing Course
 (UBWC) mixes. Use of RAS materials is not allowed in Ultra-Thin Bonded Wearing
 Course (UBWC) mixes.
 
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
 
 RAS material may constitute up to 6% by weight of total mixture, except for Open
 Graded Friction Course (OGFC) mixes, which are limited to 5% RAS by weight of total
 mixture. Also, when the percentage of RAP is greater than 30% by weight of total
 mixture, use Fractionated RAP (FRAP) meeting the requirements of Subarticle 10121(F)(c).
 
 31
 32
 33
 34
 35
 
 When RAP, RAS, or a combination of both is used in asphalt mixtures, the recycled
 binder replacement percentage (RBR%) shall not exceed the amounts specified in Table
 610-4 for the mix type. For recycled mixtures, the virgin binder Performance Grade (PG)
 grade to be used is specified in Table 610-5 for the mix type based on the recycled binder
 replacement percentage (RBR%).
 
 36
 37
 38
 39
 40

 43
 
 If the Contractor wishes to submit mix designs containing recycled material amounts
 exceeding the specified maximums, additional testing will be required to verify the
 Performance Grade (PG) of the reclaimed binder. Also, the Contractor has the option to
 have additional testing performed to determine if the mix can be approved using a virgin
 binder grade different than specified in Table 610-5. The Engineer will determine if the
 binder grade is acceptable for use based on the test data submitted with the mix design. If
 the mix design is acceptable, the Engineer will establish and approve the grade and
 percentage of virgin asphalt binder to be used.
 
 44
 45
 46
 47
 48
 49
 
 If a change in the source of RAP or RAS be made, a new mix design and JMF may be
 required in accordance with Article 1012-1. Samples of the completed recycled mixture
 may be taken by the Department on a random basis to determine the PG grading on the
 recovered asphalt binder in accordance with AASHTO M 320. If the grading is
 determined to be a value other than required for the specified mix type, the Engineer may
 require the Contractor to adjust any combination of the grade, the percentage of
 6-16
 
 Section 610
 1

 additional asphalt binder or the blend of reclaimed material to bring the grade to the
 specified value.
 (B) Mix Design Criteria
 
 4
 5
 6
 
 Design and produce asphalt concrete mixtures that conform to the gradation requirements
 and design criteria in Table 610-2 and Table 610-3 for the mix type specified. The mix
 type designates the nominal maximum aggregate size and the design traffic level.
 
 7
 8
 9
 10
 
 Surface mix designs will be tested by the Department for rutting susceptibility. Rut depth
 requirements for each surface mix type and traffic level are specified in Table 610-3.
 Mix designs that fail to meet these requirements will be unacceptable and shall be
 redesigned by the Contractor such that rut depths are acceptable.
 
 11
 12
 13
 14
 
 Table 610-2 provides gradation control points to be adhered to in the development of the
 design aggregate structure for each mix type. Aggregate gradations shall be equal to or
 pass between the control points. Table 610-3 provides the mix design criteria for the
 various mix types.
 
 15
 16
 17
 18
 19
 
 Use an anti-strip additive in all asphalt mixes. It may be hydrated lime or a chemical
 additive or a combination of both as needed to meet the retained strength requirements as
 specified in Table 610-3. When a chemical additive is used, add at a rate of not less than
 0.25% by weight of binder in the mix, or as approved by the Engineer. When hydrated
 lime is used, add at a rate of not less than 1.0% by weight of the total dry aggregate.

 Establish the JMF gradation target values within the design criteria specified for the
 particular type of asphalt mixture to be produced. Establish the JMF asphalt binder
 content at the percentage that will produce voids in total mix (VTM) at the midpoint of
 the specification design range for VTM, unless otherwise approved. The formula for
 each mixture will establish the following: blend percentage of each aggregate fraction,
 the percentage of reclaimed aggregate, if applicable, a single percentage of combined
 aggregate passing each required sieve size, the total percentage and grade of asphalt
 binder required for the mixture (by weight of total mixture), the percentage and grade of
 asphalt binder to be added to the mixture (for recycled mixtures), the percentage of
 chemical anti-strip additive to be added to the asphalt binder or percentage of hydrated
 lime to be added to the aggregate, the temperature at that the mixture is to be discharged
 from the plant, the required field density and other volumetric properties.
 
 33
 34
 
 When WMA is used, document the additive or process used and recommended rate on
 the JMF submittal. Verify the JMF based on plant produced mixture from the trial batch.
 
 35
 36
 37
 
 The mixing temperature at the asphalt plant will be established on the JMF. The JMF
 mix temperature shall be within the ranges shown in Table 610-1 unless otherwise
 approved.

 39
 
 When using RAP or RAS with a different binder than specified, use mixing temperatures
 in Table 610-1 based on the original binder grade for that mix type shown in Table 610-3.
 
 40
 
 When RAS is used, the JMF mix temperature shall be established at 275°F or higher.
 
 41
 42
 
 Have on hand at the asphalt plant the approved mix design and JMF issued by the
 Department, before beginning the work.

 The JMF for each mixture will remain in effect until modified in writing, provided the
 results of QMS tests performed in accordance with Section 609 on material currently
 being produced conform with specification requirements. When a change in sources of
 aggregate materials is to be made, a new mix design and JMF will be required before the
 new mixture is produced. When a change in sources of RAP or RAS material is to be
 made, a new JMF is required and a new mix design may be required. When
 unsatisfactory results or other conditions make it necessary, the Engineer may revoke the
 existing JMF or establish a new JMF.

 WEATHER, TEMPERATURE AND SEASONAL LIMITATIONS FOR
 PRODUCING AND PLACING ASPHALT MIXTURES
 
 6
 7
 8
 9
 
 Do not produce or place asphalt mixtures during rainy weather, when the subgrade or base
 course is frozen or when the moisture on the surface to be paved would prevent proper bond.
 Do not place asphalt material when the air or surface temperatures, measured at the location
 of the paving operation away from artificial heat, do not meet Table 610-6.
 
 10
 11
 12
 13
 
 Do not place surface course material that is to be the final layer of pavement between
 December 15 and March 16 of the next year if it is 1 inch or greater in thickness, or between
 November 15 and April 1 of the next year if it is less than 1 inch in thickness, unless
 otherwise approved.
 
 14
 15
 16
 
 As an exception to the above, when in any day's operations the placement of a layer of asphalt
 base course material or intermediate material 2 inches or greater in thickness has started, it
 may continue until the temperature drops to 32°F.
 
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 
 Do not place plant mix base course that will not be covered with surface or intermediate
 course during the same calendar year or within 15 days of placement if the plant mix is placed
 in January or February. Failure by the Contractor to cover the plant mix as required above
 will result in the Engineer notifying the Contractor in writing to cover the plant mix with a
 sand seal. Apply the sand seal in accordance with Section 660, except that Articles 660-3 and
 660-12 will not apply. In the event the Contractor fails to apply the sand seal within 72 hours
 of receipt of such notice, the Engineer may proceed to have such work performed with
 Department forces and equipment.

 Use plants that are either of the batch mixing, continuous mixing or drum mixing type,
 and so designed, equipped and operated that the weighing, proportioning and mixing of
 the materials will result in a uniform and satisfactory asphalt mixture meeting these
 Specifications. All plants shall conform to requirements of Sections 5 and 6 of the
 Asphalt QMS Manual.
 
 9
 10
 11
 12
 13
 
 Before production of the mix, stockpile aggregates for a sufficient period of time to
 facilitate the drainage of free moisture. Keep the different aggregate sizes separated until
 they have been delivered to the cold feeders. Keep the separate stockpiles readily
 accessible for sampling. When mineral filler is required in the mix, feed or weigh-in
 separately from the other aggregates.

 Introduce the asphalt binder and other additives, when required, into the mixture at the
 amounts and percentages specified by the JMF. No working tolerance will be allowed.
 Introduce the hot and dry aggregates, mineral filler, and recycled materials, in amounts
 and at temperatures such that the mixture produced is within the production control limits
 of Subarticle 609-6(D). Provide a positive means of controlling mixing time to obtain
 complete and uniform coating of the aggregate particles and thorough distribution of the
 asphalt binder throughout the aggregate. Produce the mixture at the asphalt plant within
 ±25 °F of the JMF mix temperature. The temperature of the mixture, when discharged
 from the mixer, shall not exceed 350°F.
 
 23
 24
 25
 26
 
 All asphalt plants shall be certified by the Department. Certification is effective from the
 date of issuance and is non-expiring subject to continued compliance. The Department
 will check the plant on an annual basis or as deemed necessary by the Engineer. Any
 plant that is relocated, modified or changes ownership shall be recertified before use.
 
 27
 28
 29
 30
 31
 
 Any completely automatically controlled asphalt plant that, due to the basic design of the
 plant, does not meet all these Specifications for conventional batch mixing, continuous
 mixing or drum mixing may be used on a project by project basis provided a uniformly
 consistent mix meeting all mix requirements can be produced and the plant has been
 approved in writing.
 
 32
 33
 34
 
 Any asphalt plant that cannot consistently produce a high quality mix meeting these
 Specifications will be in non-compliance with these Specifications and may have its
 certification revoked.
 
 35
 36
 37
 
 Upon a malfunction of required automatic equipment on a batch mixing plant, the plant
 may continue to operate manually for the following 2 consecutive working days,
 provided acceptable mixture is being produced.
 
 38
 39
 40
 41
 42
 
 When a malfunction of required automatic equipment on a drum mixer or continuous
 plant occurs, manual operation of the plant will not be allowed except that if, in the
 opinion of the Engineer, an emergency traffic condition exists, the plant may be allowed
 to operate manually until the unsafe traffic condition is corrected. All mix produced by
 manual operation will be subject to Section 609.

 When a storage system is used, provide a system capable of conveying the mix from the plant
 to the storage bin and storing the mix without a loss in temperature, segregation or oxidation
 of the mix. Limit storage time to the ability of the storage system to maintain the mix within
 the Specification requirements. Material may be stored in storage bins without an approved
 heating system for no more than 24 hours.
 
 7

 10
 11
 
 Provide a continuous type or skip bucket type conveyor system. Enclose continuous type
 conveyors so that the mix temperature is maintained within specification requirements.
 Provide a system designed in such manner as to prevent segregation of the mix during
 discharge from the conveyor into the bins and equipped with discharge gates that will not
 cause segregation of the mix while loading the mix into trucks.

 Transport the mixture from the mixing plant to the point of use in vehicles that have tight,
 clean, smooth beds approved by the Department, that have been sprayed with an approved
 release agent material to prevent the mixture from adhering to the beds. Remove excess
 release agent before loading. Cover each load of mixture with a solid, waterproof tarp
 constructed of canvas, vinyl, or other suitable material. Provide a 3/8 inch to 5/8 inch
 diameter hole on each side of the vehicle body near the center of the body and above the bed
 of the vehicle for the purpose of inserting a thermometer.
 
 20

 Mixtures produced simultaneously from different plant sources cannot be intermingled by
 hauling to the same paver on the roadway unless the mixtures are being produced from the
 same material sources and same JMF.
 
 27
 28
 29
 
 As referenced in Section 9.6.3 of the Asphalt QMS Manual, use the automatic screed controls
 on the paver to control the longitudinal profile. Where approved by the Engineer, the
 Contractor has the option to use either a fixed or mobile string line.

 Use a material transfer vehicle (MTV) when placing all asphalt concrete plant mix pavements
 which require the use of asphalt binder grade PG 76-22 and for all types of OGFC, unless
 otherwise approved. Use a MTV for all surface mix regardless of binder grade placed on
 Interstate and US routes that have 4 or more lanes and median divided. Where required
 above, use the MTV when placing all full width travel lanes and collector lanes. Use MTV
 for all ramps, loops, Y-line travel lanes, full width acceleration lanes, full width deceleration
 lanes and full width turn lanes that are greater than 1,000 feet in length. Use a MTV meeting
 Section 9.5(E) of the Asphalt QMS Manual.

 Request the Engineer to waive the requirement for use of pavers for spreading and finishing
 where irregularities or obstacles make their use impractical. Spread, rake and lute the mixture
 by hand methods or other approved methods in these areas.
 
 45
 46
 47
 
 Operate the paver as continuously as possible. Pave intersections, auxiliary lanes and other
 irregular areas after the main line roadway has been paved, unless otherwise approved. Place
 a wedge course at locations ahead of the paving operation as required by the Engineer.

 Provide sufficient number and weight of rollers, except as noted, to compact the mixture to
 the required density while it is still in a workable condition. Obtain approval of equipment
 used in compaction from the Engineer before use. Where uniform density is not being
 obtained throughout the depth of the layer of material being tested, change the type and/or
 weight of the compaction equipment as necessary to achieve uniform density even though
 such equipment has been previously approved.
 
 13
 14
 15
 
 Compact all final wearing surfaces, except OGFC, using a minimum of two steel-wheel
 tandem rollers, unless otherwise approved. Pneumatic-tire rollers with two tandem axles and
 smooth tread tires may be used for intermediate rolling.
 
 16
 17
 18
 
 Limit rolling for OGFC to one coverage with a tandem steel-wheel roller weighing a
 maximum of 10 tons, with additional rolling limited to one coverage with the roller where
 necessary to improve the riding surface.
 
 19
 20
 21
 22
 
 Steel-wheel tandem vibratory rollers specifically designed for the compaction of asphalt
 pavements may be used on all layers 1 inch or greater in thickness during the breakdown and
 intermediate rolling phase. Do not operate vibratory rollers in the vibratory mode during the
 finish rolling phase on any mix type or pavement course, OGFC or on PADC.
 
 23
 24
 25
 26
 
 When vibratory rollers are used, use rollers that have variable amplitude and frequency
 capabilities and that are designed specifically for asphalt pavement compaction. Provide
 rollers equipped with controls that automatically disengage the vibration mechanism before
 the roller stops when being used in the vibratory mode.
 
 27
 28
 29
 
 The Engineer may prohibit or restrict the use of vibratory rollers where damage to the
 pavement being placed, the underlying pavement structure, drainage structures, utilities or
 other facilities is likely to occur or is evident.
 
 30
 31
 
 Do not use rolling equipment that results in excessive crushing of the aggregate or excessive
 displacement of the mixture.

 In areas inaccessible to standard rolling equipment, thoroughly compact the mixture by the
 use of hand tampers, hand operated mechanical tampers, small rollers or other approved
 methods.
 
 35
 36
 37
 38
 
 Use rollers that are in good condition and capable of being reversed without backlash to
 compact the mixture. Operate rollers with the drive wheels nearest the paver and at uniform
 speeds slow enough to avoid displacement of the mixture. Equip steel-wheel rollers with
 wetting devices that will prevent the mixture from sticking to the roller wheels.

 Begin compaction of the material immediately after the material is spread and shaped to the
 required width and depth. Carry out compaction in such a manner as to obtain uniform
 density over the entire section. Perform compaction rolling at the maximum temperature at
 which the mix will support the rollers without moving horizontally. Complete the compaction
 (including both intermediate rolling) before the mixture cooling below a workable
 temperature. Perform finish rolling to remove roller marks resulting from the compaction
 rolling operations.

 Compaction with equipment other than conventional steel drum rollers may be necessary to
 achieve adequate compaction. Occasional density sampling and testing to evaluate the
 compaction process may be required. The Contractor shall maintain minimum test frequencies
 as established. Should the Contractor's density testing frequency fail to meet the minimum
 frequency as, all mix without required density test representation shall be considered
 unsatisfactory and if allowed to remain in place, will be evaluated for acceptance in
 accordance with Article 105-3.

 22
 
 If traffic will not pass over the end of the paving, a butt joint will be permitted, provided
 proper compaction is achieved. If traffic will pass over the joint, construct a sloped
 wedge ahead of the end of the full depth pavement to provide for proper compaction and
 protection of the full depth pavement. Construct the joint square to the lane alignment
 and discard all excess material. Place a paper parting strip beneath this wedge to
 facilitate joint construction unless waived by the Engineer.
 
 23
 24
 25
 
 Before paving operations are resumed, remove the sloped wedge and cut back into the
 previously constructed pavement to the point of full pavement depth. Coat the exposed
 edge of the previously constructed pavement with tack coat.
 
 26

 When laying of the mixture is resumed at the joint, complete and then test the
 construction of the joint in accordance with Article 610-12 while the mixture is still in
 a workable condition.

 until three consecutive 2,500 feet sections have been attempted without achieving satisfactory
 laydown results. If the Contractor fails to achieve satisfactory laydown results after
 three consecutive 2,500 feet sections have been attempted, cease production of that mix type
 until such time as the cause of the unsatisfactory laydown results can be determined.
 As an exception, the Engineer may grant approval to produce a different mix design of the
 same mix type if the cause is related to mix problems rather than laydown procedures.

 Each pavement layer will be tested by the Contractor and the Engineer using a 10 foot
 stationary straightedge furnished by the Contractor. Any location on the pavement selected
 by the Department shall be tested as well as all transverse joints. Apply the straightedge
 parallel to the centerline of the surface. Do not exceed 1/8 inch variation of the surface being
 tested from the edge of the straightedge between any two contact points. Correct areas found
 to exceed this tolerance by removal of the defective work and replacement with new material,
 unless other corrective measures are permitted. Provide the work and materials required in
 the correction of defective work.

 36
 
 On portions of this project where the typical section requires two or more layers of new
 pavement, perform smoothness acceptance testing of the longitudinal profile of the finished
 pavement surface using either an Inertial Profiler or a North Carolina Hearne Straightedge
 (Model No. 1). Smoothness acceptance testing using the inertial profiler is not required on
 ramps, loops and turn lanes.
 
 37
 38
 39
 40
 
 Use an Inertial Profiler (Option 1) to perform smoothness acceptance testing of the
 longitudinal profile of the finished pavement surface. Furnish an inertial profiler(s) necessary
 to perform this work. Maintain responsibility for all costs related to the procurement,
 handling, and maintenance of these devices.
 
 41
 42
 
 Furnish and operate the Hearne straightedge (Option 2) to determine and record the
 longitudinal profile of the pavement on a continuous graph.
 
 43
 44
 
 Before beginning any paving operations, the Contractor shall select one of the above options
 and submit documentation to the Engineer on the selected option for smoothness acceptance.
 
 45
 
 (A) Option 1 - Inertial Profiler
 
 46
 47
 48
 49
 
 Use an Inertial Profiler to measure the longitudinal pavement profile for construction
 quality control and smoothness acceptance. Use a profiler with line laser technology as
 single-point laser technology will not be allowed. Produce International Roughness
 Index (IRI) and Mean Roughness Index (MRI) values for measuring smoothness.

 Operate the profiler at any speed as per the manufacturer’s recommendations to collect
 valid data. Operate the Inertial Profiler in the direction of the final traffic pattern.
 Collect IRI data from both wheel paths during the same run. Define a “wheel path” as
 the 3 feet from the edge of the travel lane. MRI values are the average of the IRI values
 from both wheel paths. When using an inertial profiler that collects a single trace per
 pass, take care to ensure that the measurements from each trace in a travel lane start and
 stop at the same longitudinal locations. Unless otherwise specified, multiple runs are not
 necessary for data collection.
 
 28

 Operate the automatic triggering method at all times unless impractical. A tape stripe or
 traffic cone wrapped with reflective material may be used to alert the profiler’s automatic
 triggering sensor to begin data collection. The profiler shall reach the intended operating
 speed before entering the test section. The runup and runout distances should be
 sufficient to obtain the intended operating speed and to slow down after testing is
 completed.

 Divide the pavement surface for the project into sections which represent a continuous
 placement (i.e. the start of the project to bridge, intersection to intersection). Terminate
 a section 50 feet before a bridge approach, railroad track, or similar interruption.
 (Separate into 0.10-mile sections).

 The evaluation of the profiles will be performed on a section basis. A section is
 0.10 mile of a single pavement lane. For any section, which is less than 0.10 mile in
 length, the applicable pay adjustment incentive will be prorated on the basis of the actual
 length.
 
 42

 Unless otherwise authorized by the Engineer, perform all smoothness testing in the
 presence of the Engineer. Perform smoothness tests on the finished surface of the
 completed project or at the completion of a major stage of construction as approved by
 the Engineer. Coordinate with and receive authorization from the Engineer before starting
 smoothness testing. Perform smoothness tests within 7 days after receiving authorization.

 summary of the MRI values and the localized roughness areas including corresponding
 project station numbers or acceptable reference points. Calculate the pay adjustments for
 all segments in accordance with the formulas in Sections (1) and (2) shown below. The
 Engineer shall review and approve all pay adjustments unless corrective action is
 required. Submit the electronic files compatible with ProVAL and the evaluation in
 tabular form with each 0.10 mile segment occupying a row. Include each row with the
 beginning and ending station for the section, the length of the section, the original IRI
 values from each wheel path, and the MRI value for the section. Each continuous run for
 a section will occupy a separate table and each table will have a header that includes the
 following: the project contract number, county, the roadway number or designation, a
 lane designation, the JMF used for the final lift, the dates of the smoothness runs, and the
 beginning and ending station of the continuous run. Summarize each table at the bottom.

 (B) Option 2 - North Carolina Hearne Straightedge
 Push the straightedge manually over the pavement at a speed not exceeding 2 miles per
 hour. For all lanes, take profiles in the right wheel path approximately 3 feet from the
 right edge of pavement in the same direction as the paving operation, unless otherwise
 approved due to traffic control or safety considerations. As an exception, lanes adjacent
 to curb and gutter, expressway gutter, or shoulder berm gutter may be tested in the left
 wheel path. Make one pass of the straightedge in each full width travel lane. The full
 lane width should be comparable in ride quality to the area evaluated with the Hearne
 Straightedge. If deviations exist at other locations across the lane width, use a 10 foot
 non-mobile straightedge or the Hearne Straightedge to evaluate which areas may require
 corrective action. Take profiles as soon as practical after the pavement has been rolled
 and compacted, but no later than 24 hours following placement of the pavement, unless
 otherwise authorized by the Engineer. Take profiles over the entire length of final
 surface travel lane pavement exclusive of Y-line travel lanes less than or equal to
 1,000 feet in length, ramps less than or equal to 1,000 feet in length, turn lanes less than
 or equal to 1,000 feet in length, structures, approach slabs, paved shoulders, loops and
 tapers or other irregular shaped areas of pavement, unless otherwise approved by the
 Engineer. Test in accordance with this provision all mainline travel lanes, full width

 At the beginning and end of each day's testing operations, and at such other times as
 determined by the Engineer, operate the straightedge over a calibration strip so that the
 Engineer can verify correct operation of the straightedge. The calibration strip shall be
 a 100 foot section of pavement that is reasonably level and smooth. Submit each day’s
 calibration graphs with that day’s test section graphs to the Engineer. Calibrate the
 straightedge in accordance with the current NCDOT procedure titled North Carolina
 Hearne Straightedge - Calibration and Determination of Cumulative Straightedge Index.
 Copies of this procedure may be obtained from the Department's Pavement Section in the
 Construction Unit.
 
 12
 13
 14

 16
 
 Plot the straightedge graph at a horizontal scale of approximately 25 feet per inch with
 the vertical scale plotted at a true scale. Record station numbers and references (bridges,
 approach slabs, culverts, etc.) on the graphs. Distances between references/stations shall
 not exceed 100 feet. Have the operator record the Date, Project No., Lane Location,
 Wheel Path Location, Type Mix and Operator’s Name on the graph.

 Upon completion of each day's testing, evaluate the graph, calculate the Cumulative
 Straightedge Index (CSI) and determine which lots, if any, require corrective action.
 Document the evaluation of each lot on a QA/QC-7 form. Submit the graphs along with
 the completed QA/QC-7 forms to the Engineer, within 24 hours after profiles are
 completed, for verification of the results. The Engineer will furnish results of their
 acceptance evaluation to the Contractor within 48 hours of receiving the graphs. In the
 event of discrepancies, the Engineer’s evaluation of the graphs will prevail for acceptance
 purposes. The Engineer will retain all graphs and forms.

 Use blanking bands of 0.2 inch, 0.3 inch and 0.4 inch to evaluate the graph for
 acceptance. The 0.2 inch and 0.3 inch blanking bands are used to determine the
 Straightedge Index (SEI), which is a number that indicates the deviations that exceed
 each of the 0.2 inch and 0.3 inch bands within a 100 foot test section. The Cumulative
 Straightedge Index (CSI) is a number representing the total of the SEIs for one lot, which
 consist of not more than 25 consecutive test sections. In addition, the 0.4 inch blanking
 band is used to further evaluate deviations on an individual basis. The CSI will be
 determined by the Engineer in accordance with the current procedure titled North
 Carolina Hearne Straightedge - Calibration and Determination of Cumulative
 Straightedge Index.

 The pavement will be accepted for surface smoothness on a lot by lot basis. A test
 section represents pavement one travel lane wide not more than 100 feet in length. A lot
 will consist of 25 consecutive test sections, except that separate lots will be established
 for each travel lane, unless otherwise approved by the Engineer. In addition, full width
 acceleration or deceleration lanes, ramps, turn lanes and collector lanes will be evaluated
 as separate lots. For any lot that is less than 2,500 feet in length, the applicable pay
 adjustment incentive will be prorated on the basis of the actual lot length. For any lot
 which is less than 2,500 feet in length, the applicable pay adjustment disincentive will be
 the full amount for a lot, regardless of the lot length.

 46
 47
 48
 49
 
 If during the evaluation of the graphs, five lots require corrective action, then proceed on
 limited production for unsatisfactory laydown in accordance with Article 610-12.
 Proceeding on limited production is based upon the Contractor’s initial evaluation of the
 straightedge test results and shall begin immediately upon obtaining those results.
 Additionally, the Engineer may direct the Contractor to proceed on limited production in
 accordance with Article 610-12 due to unsatisfactory laydown or workmanship.

 Limited production for unsatisfactory laydown is defined as being restricted to the
 production, placement, compaction and final surface testing of a sufficient quantity of
 mix necessary to construct only 2,500 feet of pavement at the laydown width. Once this
 lot is complete, the final surface testing graphs will be evaluated jointly by the Contractor
 and the Engineer. Remain on limited production until such time as acceptable laydown
 results are obtained or until three consecutive 2,500 foot sections have been attempted
 without achieving acceptable laydown results. The Engineer will determine if normal
 production may resume based upon the CSI for the limited production lot and any
 adjustments to the equipment, placement methods, and/or personnel performing the work.
 Once on limited production, the Engineer may require the Contractor to evaluate the
 smoothness of the previous asphalt layer and take appropriate action to reduce and/or
 eliminate corrective measures on the final surface course. Additionally, the Contractor
 may be required to demonstrate acceptable laydown techniques off the project limits
 before proceeding on the project.
 
 15
 16
 17
 
 If the Contractor fails to achieve satisfactory laydown results after three consecutive
 2,500 foot sections have been attempted, cease production of that mix type until such
 time as the cause of the unsatisfactory laydown results can be determined.
 
 18
 19
 20
 21
 
 As an exception, the Engineer may grant approval to produce a different mix design of
 the same mix type if the cause is related to mix problem(s) rather than laydown
 procedures. If production of a new mix design is allowed, proceed under the limited
 production procedures detailed above.
 
 22
 23
 24
 25
 
 After initially proceeding under limited production, the Contractor shall immediately
 notify the Engineer if any additional lot on the project requires corrective action. The
 Engineer will determine if limited production procedures are warranted for continued
 production.
 
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
 
 If the Contractor does not operate by the limited production procedures as specified
 above, the 5 lots, which require corrective action, will be considered unacceptable and
 may be subject to removal and replacement. Mix placed under the limited production
 procedures for unsatisfactory laydown will be evaluated for acceptance in accordance
 with Article l05-3.

 Test sections and/or lots that are initially tested by the Contractor that indicate excessive
 deviations such that either a disincentive or corrective action is necessary, may be
 re-rolled with asphalt rollers while the mix is still warm and in a workable condition, to
 possibly correct the problem. In this instance, reevaluation of the test section(s) shall be
 completed within 24 hours of pavement placement and these test results will serve as the
 initial test results.

 When fiber stabilizing additives are used as an ingredient of the mixture, use a separate feed
 system capable of accurately proportioning the required quantity into the mixture and in such
 a manner that uniform distribution will be obtained. Interlock the proportioning device with
 the aggregate feed or weigh system so as to maintain the correct proportions for all rates of
 production and batch sizes. Accurately control the proportion of fibers to within ± 10% of the
 amount required. Provide flow indicators or sensing devices for the fiber system that are
 interlocked with plant controls such that mixture production will be interrupted if introduction
 of the fiber fails.
 
 13
 14
 15
 
 When a batch type plant is used, add the fiber to the aggregate in the weigh hopper or as
 approved. Increase the batch dry mixing time by 8 to 12 seconds, or as directed, to assure the
 fibers are uniformly distributed before the injection of asphalt binder into the mixer.
 
 16
 17
 18
 
 When a continuous mix or dryer-drum type plant is used, add the fiber to the aggregate and
 uniformly disperse at the point of injection of asphalt binder. Add the fiber in such a manner
 that it will not become entrained in the exhaust system of the drier or plant.

 Use asphalt mixing plants in accordance with Article 610-5. Furnish paving machine
 with the following capabilities:
 
 9
 10
 11
 
 (1) Self-priming paving machine capable of spraying the PMEM, applying the hot
 asphalt concrete overlay and screeding the surface of the mat to the required profile
 and cross section in one pass at any rate between 30 and 92 feet per minute.
 
 12
 13
 14
 
 (2) Receiving hopper, feed conveyor, storage tank for PMEM material, PMEM emulsion
 single variable-width spray bar and a variable width, heated, vibratory-tamping bar
 screed.
 
 15
 16
 17
 
 (3) Screed with the ability to be crowned at the center both positively and negatively and
 have vertically and horizontally adjustable extensions to accommodate the desired
 pavement profile and widths.
 
 18
 19
 
 (4) Sprayer system capable of accurately and continuously monitoring the rate of spray
 and providing a uniform application across the entire width to be overlaid.
 
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 
 (5) Use pavers equipped with an electronic screed control that will automatically control
 the longitudinal profile and cross slope of the pavement. Control the longitudinal
 profile through the use of either a mobile grade reference(s), including mechanical,
 sonic and laser grade sensing and averaging devices, an erected string line(s) when
 specified, joint matching shoe(s), slope control devices or the approved methods or
 combination of methods. Unless otherwise specified, use a mobile grade reference
 system capable of averaging the existing grade or pavement profile over
 at least a 30 feet distance or by non-contacting laser or sonar type ski with
 at least four referencing stations mounted on the paver at a minimum length of 24
 6-49
 
 Section 661

 feet. Establish the position of the reference system such that the average profile
 grade is established at the approximate midpoint of the system. The transverse cross
 slope shall be controlled as directed by the Engineer.
 
 4
 5
 6
 7
 
 Use an erected fixed stringline for both and longitudinal profile and cross slope control
 when required by the contract. When an erected fixed string line is required, furnish and
 erect the necessary guide line for the equipment. Support the stringline with grade stakes
 placed at maximum intervals of 25 feet for the finished pavement grade.

 10
 11
 12
 13
 
 Use the 30 feet minimum length mobile grade reference system or the non-contacting
 laser or sonar type ski with at least four referencing stations mounted on the paver at a
 minimum length of 24 feet to control the longitudinal profile when placing the initial
 lanes and all adjacent lanes of all layers, including resurfacing and asphalt in-lays, unless
 other specified or approved. A joint matching device (short 6 inch shoes) may be used
 only when approved.
 
 14
 15
 16
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 
 Use the automatic slope control system unless otherwise approved. The Engineer may
 waive the use of automatic slope controls in areas where the existing surface (subgrade,
 base, asphalt layer, etc.) exhibits the desired cross slope of the final surface. The
 Engineer may also waive the use of automatic slope controls in areas where the use of
 such equipment is impractical due to irregular shape or cross section (such as
 resurfacing). When the use of the automatic slope controls is waived, the Engineer may
 require the use of mobile grade references on either or both sides of the paver. Manual
 screed operation will be permitted in the construction of irregularly shaped and minor
 areas, subject to approval. Waiver of the use of automatic screed controls does not
 relieve the Contractor of achieving plan profile grades and cross slopes.
 
 24
 25
 26
 27
 
 In the case of malfunction of the automatic screed control equipment, the paver may be
 manually operated for the remainder of the workday provided this method of operation
 produces acceptable results. Do not resume work thereafter until the automatic system is
 functional.
 
 28
 29
 30
 
 The Engineer will waive the requirement for use of pavers for spreading and finishing
 where irregularities or obstacles make their use impractical. Spread, rake and lute the
 mixture by hand methods or other approved methods in these areas.
 
 31

 Operate the paver as continuously as possible. Pave intersections, auxiliary lanes and
 other irregular areas after the main line roadway has been paved, unless otherwise
 approved.
 
 34
 35
 36
 37
 38
 
 Compact the wearing course with a steel double drum asphalt roller(s) with a minimum
 weight of 10 tons. Maintain rollers in reliable operating condition and equip with
 functioning water system and scrapers to prevent adhesion of the fresh mix onto the roller
 drums. Supply adequate roller units and compact promptly following the placement of
 the material.
 
 39
 40
 
 Request approval of equipment before the start of any work. Maintain all equipment and
 tools in satisfactory working condition at all times.

 Where finishing operations must be completed after dark, provide acceptable artificial
 light in accordance with Section 1413.
 
 28
 
 Do not pave when any of the following conditions exist:
 
 29
 30
 31
 32
 
 (1) A descending air temperature at the location of the concrete paving operation and
 away from artificial heat reaches 35°F. Paving may resume when the weather
 forecast is projected to reach a high of 40°F on that day’s operation and the morning
 ambient temperature is above 32°F.
 
 33
 
 (2) The subgrade or base course is frozen.
 
 34
 
 (3) Aggregates to be used in the mix contain frozen particles.
 
 35
 36
 
 (4) Air temperature in the shade is 90°F and rising or the concrete temperature is greater
 than 95°F.

 Use a slip form paver that is an approved self-propelled machine designed to spread,
 consolidate, screed and float finish the concrete in one complete pass of the machine to
 provide a smooth, dense and homogeneous pavement with minimal hand finishing. Use
 a slip form paver equipped with forms of sufficient length and rigidity to support the
 edges of the slab to minimize hand finishing. Use a slip form paver equipped with both
 horizontal and vertical automatic controls. Operate the paver with continuous forward
 movement and coordinate all operations of mixing, delivering and spreading the concrete
 to provide uniform progress and minimize stopping and starting of the paver.
 
 10

 Provide concrete that has sufficient cohesion to prevent appreciable slumping at the edges
 of each slab. Longitudinal straight edge tolerance of 1/4 inch in 10 feet shall apply to the
 area within 6 inches of the edge. Edge slump shall be limited to no more than 1/4 inch.
 
 13
 
 (C) Fixed Form Method
 
 14
 
 Apply this section to all paving operations where a slip form paver is not being used.
 
 15
 16
 
 Use forms made of metal and of such section and design that they will adequately support
 the concrete and the construction equipment.
 
 17
 18
 19
 20
 
 Use forms that have a depth not less than the edge thickness of the pavement to be
 constructed and not more than 1 inch greater than the edge thickness of the pavement to
 be constructed. Use a form which has the base width at least equal to the height of the
 form.
 
 21

 Use form pins that are metal and capable of holding the forms rigidly in place during
 construction operations. The Engineer may require pinholes in the base to be sealed
 before placing subsequent pavement.
 
 28
 29
 
 Connect the form sections by a locking joint that will keep the forms free from vertical
 and horizontal movement.
 
 30
 31
 32
 33
 
 Use straight forms 10 feet in length on tangents and on curves having a radius of 200 feet
 or more. For curves having a radius of between 50 feet and 200 feet use either straight
 forms 5 feet in length or flexible forms. Use flexible forms for curves having a radius of
 less than 50 feet.
 
 34
 35
 
 Clean all forms before they are set. Oil all forms before placing concrete. Check the
 bearing of the forms and correct all areas of inadequate bearing.
 
 36
 
 Remove all rejected forms immediately from the project.
 
 37
 38
 39

 Furnish an electronic vibrator monitoring device, displaying the operating frequency of each
 individual vibrator on the paving equipment. Operate the electronic vibrator monitoring
 device in areas where the mainline, ramp or loop pavement exceeds 600 feet in length.
 Record the time, station location, paver track speed and operating frequency of each
 individual vibrator after every 25 feet of paving or after each 5 minute time interval has
 elapsed. Provide a report of the vibrator data to the Engineer daily for the first 3 days of
 paving and weekly thereafter. The Engineer may determine that more frequent submissions
 are necessary, particularly if equipment is malfunctioning.
 
 12
 13
 14
 15
 16
 
 Set the internal vibrators to approximately mid slab depth and provide a locking device to
 avoid contact with any joint, load transfer device, tie bar, subgrade or side form. Provide an
 operating position locking device so that no part of the vibrating unit can be lowered to the
 extent that it will come in contact with dowel bars, dowel bar assemblies or tie bars while
 paving.
 
 17
 18
 
 Set the horizontal spacing of vibrators to the manufacturer's recommendations, but in no case
 exceed 16 inches from center to center.
 
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 
 Operate internal and spud vibrators within a frequency range of 3,500 to 8,000 vpm and
 surface vibrators within a frequency range of 3,500 to 6,500 vpm. Operate vibrators to avoid
 separation of the mix ingredients. A reduction in vibrator frequency may be required when
 the forward motion of the paver is reduced to avoid separation of the mix. Either discontinue
 the use or remove from contact with the concrete, the machine mounted vibrators, whenever
 the forward motion of the machinery is stopped.
 
 25
 26
 27
 28
 
 Should the electronic monitoring device fail to operate properly, immediately check the
 vibrators manually in the presence of the Engineer. If the vibrators are functioning properly,
 paving may continue. Repair the monitoring device within 3 production days or suspend
 paving.

 17
 18
 19
 20
 
 After final finish and immediately after the free surface moisture has disappeared, use
 a minimum application rate of 0.0067 gal/sf when the application equipment is
 mechanically operated. Provide an inline flow-metering device to ensure the proper rate
 is applied. Apply the curing compound such that puddling or ponding does not occur on
 the fresh concrete surface.
 
 21
 22
 
 Use mechanically operated application equipment designed to apply a uniformly agitated
 continuous flow of the curing compound at the prescribed rate to all concrete surfaces.
 
 23
 24
 
 Hand spraying shall only be permitted for irregular widths or shapes and surfaces
 exposed by removal of forms. The rate of application for these areas shall be 0.01 gal/sf.
 
 25
 26
 27
 
 Do not expose newly placed concrete for more than 30 minutes before being covered
 with curing compound. Failure to cover the surfaces of the concrete shall be cause for
 immediate suspension of the paving operation.
 
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 
 Protect the membrane curing compound film at all times during the curing period and
 repair any damage immediately. Ensure a sufficient amount of polyethylene film, burlap
 or other approved material is available to provide for protection of the concrete during
 rain or when the application equipment fails to apply the curing compound uniformly to
 all surfaces.
 
 33
 34
 
 Reapply curing compound to any concrete surfaces that received heavy rainfall within
 3 hours after initial application.
 
 35
 
 (C) Polyethylene Film
 
 36
 37
 38
 39
 
 Spread the sections of the film in a manner that will not damage the finished pavement
 surface. Securely tape or provide lap joints for the sections that are at least 12 inches
 wide, and take suitable precautions to prevent the circulation of air beneath the film.
 Cover all exposed surfaces and beyond the edge of the pavement surface.
 
 40
 41
 42
 
 Use black or dark plastic sheets when the daily high ambient temperature is between
 40°F and 60°F. Use white opaque reflective plastic sheet when the daily ambient
 temperature is above 60°F. Plastic sheets will meet ASTM C171.

 700-11 JOINT CONSTRUCTION
 
 15
 
 (A) General
 
 16
 17
 18
 19
 
 Construct all joints in accordance with these Standard Specifications and the details
 shown on the plans. Saw all transverse joints and seal them with joint sealer in
 accordance with the dimensions and details shown in the contract. Seal joints in
 accordance with Article 700-12.
 
 20
 21
 22
 
 Saw the concrete pavement as soon as it can support the weight of the equipment and
 operator without disturbing the final finish. Saw joints in a neat, vertical straight line
 without chipping, spalling, tearing or disturbing the final finish.
 
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 
 Ensure an adequate amount of sawing equipment is available to match the production and
 concrete paving operations. At least one standby sawing unit is recommended.
 Construct the joint groove using a 1/8 inch saw blade to a minimum depth of 4 inches or
 the design thickness divided by 3 whichever is less. Perform sawing as soon as the
 concrete has hardened sufficiently without undercutting, spalling and raveling to control
 random cracking. To estimate the time of sawing, it is recommended to use the latest
 version of FHWA’s High Performance Paving software entitled HIPERPAV.
 
 30
 31
 32
 
 Immediately after sawing the joint to the dimensions shown on the plans, completely
 remove the resulting slurry from the joint without damaging the adjacent concrete.
 Immediately reapply curing membrane to areas damaged by the sawing operation.
 
 33
 34
 35
 
 Deviations from the method of joint construction specified in the contract requires prior
 approval in writing. Such approval is conditional and is subject to obtaining satisfactory
 results.
 
 36
 37
 38
 39
 
 The Engineer may order any concrete pavement or shoulder where uncontrolled cracking
 has occurred before final acceptance to be removed and replaced at no cost to the
 Department. Where permitted, the Contractor may be allowed to repair the cracking in
 a manner acceptable to the Engineer.
 
 40
 41
 42
 
 Before placing either concrete pavement or concrete shoulders adjacent to a previously
 placed pavement, cover the transverse joint opening on the edge of the existing slab to
 prevent intrusion of grout into the opening.
 
 43
 
 (B) Transverse Contraction Joints
 
 44

 accordance with the details and dimensions shown on the plans.
 (D) Transverse Construction Joints
 (1) General
 Construct transverse construction joints by use of an approved form at the end of
 each day's operations (planned joint) or whenever the placing of concrete is
 suspended for more than 30 minutes (emergency joint).
 (2) Planned Transverse Construction Joints
 Locate this type of joint at the same spacing required for contraction joints. Use
 dowel bars of the size and spacing shown on the plans.
 (3) Emergency Transverse Construction Joints
 
 13
 14
 
 Use this type of joint when the placing of concrete is suspended for more than
 30 minutes. Use tie bars of the size and spacing shown on the plans.

 utilizing an approved joint assembly.
 (G) Verification of Dowel Bar Alignment
 
 25
 26
 
 Use either properly secured dowel baskets or a dowel bar inserter, provided the ability to
 correctly locate and align the dowels at the joints is demonstrated as described below.
 
 27
 28
 29
 30
 
 Provide a calibrated magnetic imaging device that will document dowel bar location and
 alignment. Calibrate the magnetic imaging device to the type and size dowel bar used in
 the work. Use this device as a process control and make necessary adjustment to ensure
 the dowels are placed in the correct location.
 
 31
 32
 33
 
 Scan at least 25% of the joints in the initial placement or 1.0 mile of pavement,
 whichever is greater, at random intervals, as selected by the Engineer, throughout the
 pavement each time the paving train is mobilized. Mark scanned joints on the pavement.
 
 34

 43
 44
 45
 
 Scan all joints in this initial placement if the dowel bars exhibit longitudinal translation
 (side shift), horizontal translation, vertical translation (depth), horizontal skew or vertical
 tilt, above the allowable tolerances defined below. In addition, continue scanning no less
 than 25% of the joints until it is established that the dowel bar inserter or secured dowel
 basket assemblies are consistently placing the dowel bars at the correct location and
 meeting the tolerances defined in Table 700-1. Once the engineer determines that
 consistency is established, the contractor may reduce the percentage of scanned joints to
 no less than 10%. Any time inconsistency in the placement of the dowel bars becomes
 evident, additional scanning may be required up to 100% of the joints. Materials and
 Tests Unit will provide Quality Assurance and random verification scans during the
 initial concrete placement to verify the Contractor’s scan results. The QA frequency will
 be at least 10% of the Contractor’s scan.
 7-7
 
 Section 700

 If consistency of the proper dowel bar alignment cannot be established within
 a reasonable time frame, the Engineer will have the option of suspending the paving
 operation.
 
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 
 Provide a report of the scanned joints within 48 hours of completing the day’s
 production. The report should include the station and lane of the joint scanned, as well as
 the horizontal location, depth, longitudinal translation (side shift), horizontal skew and
 vertical tilt, and total misalignment, of each dowel bar in the joint. If a dowel bar inserter
 is used, the joint score described below should also be provided in the report.
 
 9
 10
 11
 
 Longitudinal translation (side shift) is defined as the position of the center of the dowel
 bar in relation to the sawed joint. The maximum allowable longitudinal translation (side
 shift) is 2 inches.
 
 12
 13
 14
 
 Horizontal translation is defined as difference in the actual dowel bar location from its
 theoretical position as detailed in the standard details. The maximum allowable
 horizontal translation is 2 inches.
 
 15
 16
 17
 
 Vertical translation (depth) is the difference in the actual dowel bar location from the
 theoretical midpoint of the slab. The maximum allowable vertical translation is 1/2 inch
 higher than the theoretical midpoint and 1inch lower than the theoretical midpoint.
 
 18
 19
 20
 
 Dowel bar misalignment, either vertical tilt or horizontal skew is defined as the difference
 in position of the dowel bar ends with respect to each other. Vertical tilt is measured in
 the vertical axis whereas horizontal skew is measured in the horizontal axis.
 
 21
 22
 23
 24
 25
 26
 
 If a dowel bar inserter is used, determine a joint score for each joint scanned. The joint
 score is a measure of the combined effects from the dowel’s horizontal skew or vertical
 tilt. The joint score is determined by summing the product of the weight shown in the
 Table 700-1 and the number of bars in each misalignment category and adding one. The
 vertical tilt and horizontal skew should be evaluated and the total misalignment shall be
 used in determining the joint score.

 (C) Temperature
 Do not place joint sealant when the air temperature near the joint is less than 45°F or
 is 45°F and falling.
 (D) Sealing the Joint
 
 15
 16
 17
 18
 
 Immediately after sawing the joint to the dimensions as shown on the plans, completely
 remove the resulting slurry from the joint by flushing with a jet of water under pressure.
 Use sand blasting to clean joint faces before applying sealant. Make as many passes with
 a sand blaster as are necessary to provide a clean joint wall.
 
 19
 20
 21
 22
 
 Blow all joints clear of deleterious materials with air using a nozzle pressure of at least
 90 psi before installing the backer rod. Use rotary screw compressors for this purpose
 that are equipped with traps capable of removing water and oil from the air. Maintain the
 traps in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.
 
 23
 24
 25
 
 Apply sealer only on thoroughly clean and dry joints. Place the sealer to closely conform
 to dimensions shown on the plans. Any unreasonable deviation will be cause for
 rejection.
 
 26
 27
 28
 
 (E) Cleaning Pavement
 After a joint has been sealed, remove surplus joint sealer on the pavement as soon as
 possible.

 700-13 USE OF NEW PAVEMENT OR SHOULDER
 
 30
 31
 32
 33
 
 Traffic or other heavy equipment will not be allowed on the concrete pavement or shoulder
 until the estimated compressive strength of the concrete using the maturity method has
 exceeded 3,000 psi. Estimate the compressive strength of concrete pavement in accordance
 with ASTM C1074 unless otherwise specified.
 
 34
 35
 36
 37
 38
 39
 
 Furnish thermocouples or thermistors and digital data logging maturity meters that
 automatically compute and display the maturity index in terms of a temperature-time
 factor (TTF). The maturity meters must be capable of storing at least 28 days worth of data
 and exporting data into an Excel® spreadsheet. Install loggers in slabs after every 2 lots
 approximately 4 inches from the concrete surface. Submit the proposed equipment to the
 Engineer for approval.
 
 40
 41
 
 When establishing a strength-maturity relationship, perform compressive tests at ages 1, 3, 7,
 14 and 28 days in accordance with AASHTO T 22.
 
 42
 43
 44
 
 Use the TTF maturity function to compute the maturity index from the measured temperature
 history of the concrete. Set the datum temperature at -10°C to calculate the TTF in
 Equation 1 of ASTM C1074.
 
 7-9
 
 Section 700

 Establish and submit a strength-maturity relationship in conjunction with each concrete
 pavement mix design. Determine the TTF corresponding to the strength-maturity relationship
 at 3,500 psi, TTF. Any changes to plant operations, material sources or mix proportions will
 affect the strength-maturity relationship. If any changes occur during production, develop
 a new strength-maturity relationship unless otherwise directed.
 
 6
 7
 8
 9
 
 Validate the strength-maturity relationship and the correlation between cylinders and beams
 during the first day’s production by casting cylinders and beams and performing strength
 tests. Use the TTF developed during the mix design process to verify the strength-maturity
 relationship.
 
 10

 16
 
 Validate the strength-maturity relationship and the correlation between cylinders and beams
 by casting cylinders and beams and performing strength tests at least every 30 calendar days,
 or when the TTF varies by more than 10% from the latest approved maturity curve or there is
 a material change from the approved concrete mix design. If the verification sample’s
 compressive strength when tested at TTF is less than 3,000 psi, immediately suspend early
 opening of traffic on pavement that has not obtained TTF until a new strength-maturity
 relationship is developed.
 
 17
 18
 
 No permanent traffic will be allowed on the pavement until construction of the joints,
 including all sawing, sealing and curing that is required, has been completed.
 
 19
 
 Take particular care to protect the exposed pavement edges and ends.

 Before placement, produce a trial batch through the plant. The Engineer will make
 compressive and flexural samples from the trial batch for testing at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days of
 age. Until the trial batch meets 650 psi flexural strength and 4,500 psi compressive strength,
 the Engineer will make acceptance samples for flexural and compressive tests for mix placed.
 If the trial batch test results meet strength requirements, flexural samples representing placed
 concrete will be discarded, and compressive samples will be used for acceptance. If the trial
 batch does not meet strength requirements, flexural samples will be used for acceptance until
 plant produced mix meets strength requirements.
 
 13

 If any major change as defined in Section 1000-3 is made to the mix design, this process shall
 be initiated again.

 For all concrete pavement, including mainline, shoulders, ramps, tapers, intersections,
 entrances, crossovers and irregular areas not otherwise defined, produce a lot consisting of
 1,333.3 sy or fraction thereof placed within 28 calendar days. From each lot, the Engineer
 will make at least one set of two 6 inch x 12 inch cylinders from a randomly selected batch of
 concrete. The average compression strength of the 2 cylinders is considered one test. If
 Department personnel make and test additional sets of cylinders for a lot, all sets will be
 averaged with the original set to determine the strength. In the case of low strength, the
 Engineer will perform an investigation.

 Produce the final surface finish on all mainline pavement, auxiliary lanes, and ramps by
 mechanical equipment for longitudinally tined grooves while the concrete is plastic. The
 tining shall be done with a mechanical device such as a wire comb. The comb shall have a
 single row of tines. Each shall have a nominal width of 5/56 inch to 1/8 inch. The nominal
 spacing of the tines shall be 3/4 ± 1/8 inch center-to-center. The nominal depth of tined
 groove in the plastic concrete shall be 1/8 ± 1/32 inch.
 
 16
 17
 18
 19
 20
 
 Longitudinal tining shall be accomplished by equipment with automated horizontal and
 vertical controls to ensure straight, uniform depth tined grooves. The texture geometry shall
 be the same as imparted throughout the length of the tining comb. A 2 inch to 3 inch wide
 strip of pavement surface shall be protected from tining for the length of and centered about
 longitudinal joints.
 
 21
 22
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 
 The tining operation shall be done so that the desired surface texture will be achieved while
 minimizing displacement of the larger aggregate particles and before the surface permanently
 sets. Where abutting pavement is to be placed, the tining shall extend as close to the edge as
 possible without damaging the edge. If abutting pavement is not to be placed, the 6 inch area
 nearest the edge or 1 foot from the face of the curb shall not be tined. Hand-operated tining
 equipment that produces an equivalent texture may be used only on small or irregularly
 shaped areas. Tines shall be thoroughly cleaned at the end of each day’s use and damaged or
 worn tines replaced.
 
 29
 30
 
 When surface corrections for pavement smoothness are made in the hardened concrete, no
 additional texturing is required.
 
 31
 32
 33
 34
 
 After final finishing, hand finishing may be required on the edges of pavement and joints
 whenever irregularities in surface texture or alignment occur. Care should be taken in hand
 finishing pavement edges to avoid ridges or high places that will prevent water from draining
 out of the transverse grooves.
 
 35
 
 The use of excessive water during the finishing operations will not be permitted.

 Provide a textured surface with an average texture depth of 0.8 mm as tested in accordance
 with ASTM E965 with no single test having a texture depth of 0.5 mm or less. Perform4
 randomly located tests in accordance with ASTM E965 within the initial pavement lot of each
 mobilization in the presence of the Engineer. A “lot” is defined in Article 710-4. If the
 average of the 4 tests does not meet the above criteria, make appropriate changes to the
 surface texture operations and test the next lot as detailed above. Once the surface texture
 process is established to meet minimum texture requirements, maintain consistency within the
 operation to provide the above minimum texture depth. Perform additional sand patch tests in
 accordance with ASTM E965 when directed.
 
 45

 If the surface texture becomes damaged or reduced by rain or any other action, reestablish or
 restore surface texture by an approved method.

 The Inertial Profiler shall be calibrated and verified in accordance with the most current
 version of AASHTO M 328. Provide certification documentation that the profiler meets
 AASHTO M 328 to the Engineer before the first day the Inertial Profiler is used on the
 project.
 
 10

 Configure the profiler to record the actual elevation of the pavement surface. Do not use the
 profiler’s internal IRI calculation mode. The profile data shall be filtered with a cutoff
 wavelength of 250 feet. The interval at which relative profile elevations are reported shall be
 a maximum of 1 inch.
 
 14
 15
 
 Provide IRI data in accordance with most current version of ASTM E1926. Use personnel
 trained to record and evaluate IRI data.
 
 16

 25
 
 Operate the profiler at any speed as per the manufacturer’s recommendations, however, the
 speed must be constant to within ± 3 mph of the intended speed and any required acceleration
 should be as gradual as possible. For example, if the intended speed were 30 mph, the
 acceptable range of speed for testing would be 27 to 33 mph.

 Operate the Inertial Profiler in the direction of the final traffic pattern. Collect IRI data from
 both wheel paths during the same run. It is permissible to collect data one wheel path at a
 time if each wheel path is tested and evaluated separately. Define a “wheel path” as the 3 feet
 from the edge of the travel lane. MRI values are the average of the IRI values from both
 wheel paths. When using an inertial profiler that collects a single trace per pass, take care to
 ensure that the measurements from each trace in a travel lane start and stop at the same
 longitudinal locations. Unless otherwise specified, multiple runs are not necessary for data
 collection.
 
 34
 35
 36
 37
 38
 
 Operate the automatic triggering method at all times unless impractical. A tape stripe or
 traffic cone wrapped with reflective material may be used to alert the profiler’s automatic
 triggering sensor to begin data collection. The profiler shall reach the intended operating
 speed before entering the test section. The runup and runout distances should be sufficient to
 obtain the intended operating speed and to slow down after testing is completed.

 Divide the pavement surface for the project into sections which represent a continuous
 placement (i.e. the start of the project to bridge, intersection to intersection). Terminate
 a section 50 feet before a bridge approach, railroad track, or similar interruption. (Separate
 into 0.10-mile sections).
 
 43
 44
 45
 
 The evaluation of the profiles will be performed on a section basis. A section is 0.10 mile of
 a single pavement lane. For any section, which is less than 0.10 mile in length, the applicable
 pay adjustment incentive will be prorated on the basis of the actual length.
 
 46

 occupying a row. Include each row with the beginning and ending station for the section, the
 length of the section, the original IRI values from each wheel path, and the MRI value for the
 section. Each continuous run for a section will occupy a separate table and each table will
 have a header that includes the following: the project contract number, county, the roadway
 number or designation, a lane designation, the dates of the smoothness runs, and the
 beginning and ending station of the continuous run. Summarize each table at the bottom.

 location on the pavement selected by the Department shall be tested as well as all
 transverse joints. Apply the straightedge parallel to the centerline of the surface. Do not
 exceed 1/8 inch variation of the surface being tested from the edge of the straightedge
 between any 2 contact points. Correct areas found to exceed this tolerance by removal of
 the defective work and replacement with new material, unless other corrective measures
 are permitted. Provide the work and materials required in the correction of defective
 work.

 When the measurement of any core, original core or additional cores taken to calculate the
 average, is less than the plan thickness by more than 1.0 inch, the extent of the removal area
 due to thickness deficiency will be determined by taking additional exploratory cores at
 approximately 10 foot intervals parallel to the center line in each direction from the deficient
 core until an exploratory core is found in each direction which is within 1.0 inch of the plan
 thickness. The pavement between these exploratory cores will be removed full lane width

 When the measurement of the core from a lot is deficient by 0.2 inch or less from the plan
 thickness, no pay reduction will be made for thickness. When such measurement is deficient

 the plan thickness - 1.0 inch will be considered as the plan thickness - 1.0 inch. If the average
 measurement of the 3 cores is within 0.2 inch from the plan thickness, full payment will be
 made. If the average measurement of the 3 cores is deficient by more than 0.2 inch from the

 (1) Compressive Strength
 
 22
 23
 24
 25
 
 The pay factor for pavement achieving a compressive strength in 28 days of
 4,500 psi or greater is 100%. The pay factor for pavement achieving a compressive
 strength in 28 days between 3,500 psi and 4,500 psi is determined by the following
 formula:

 )]
 
 (2) Flexural Strength
 
 29
 30
 31
 
 The pay factor for pavement achieving a flexural strength in 28 days of 650 psi or
 greater is 100%. The pay factor for pavement achieving a flexural strength in
 28 days between 600 psi and 650 psi is determined by the following formula:
 
 (
 
 )
 
 32

 The quantities of Portland cement concrete pavement that meet these criteria, will be paid
 at an adjusted unit price per square yard for __" Portland Cement Concrete Pavement,
 Through Lanes, (with dowels), __" Portland Cement Concrete Pavement, Ramps, (with
 dowels) or __" Portland Cement Concrete Pavement, Miscellaneous, (without dowels)
 completed in place and accepted. The adjusted contract unit price will be determined by
 multiplying the contract unit price by the pay factor level determined for the average
 strength of concrete in each lot and will be applicable to the total square yards of concrete
 in each lot.
 
 42
 43
 44
 
 Any pavement that fails to attain 3,500 psi in compression is subject to removal. If
 allowed to remain in place, the pavement will be accepted at a reduced unit price based
 on a pay factor level of 50% as provided in Article 105-3.

 The concrete shall be deposited within the slab replacement area in such manner as to
 require as little re-handing as possible, to prevent segregation of the mix. Hand spreading
 shall be minimized as much as possible, but where necessary, shall be done with shovels,
 not rakes. Workers will not be allowed to walk in the fresh concrete with shoes coated
 with earth or other foreign substances. The replaced slab area shall be filled with
 concrete and thoroughly consolidated by rodding, spading, and sufficient vibration to
 form a dense homogeneous mass throughout the area. The final surface area shall be
 uniform in appearance and free of irregularities and porous areas.

 The Contractor may elect to use global positioning system (GPS) surveying, either static
 or kinematic. Perform GPS surveys with same or higher order of accuracy as
 conventional surveys detailed in the Manual for Construction Layout. Department
 projects use a localized coordinate system developed by the Location and Surveys Unit
 specifically for each individual project. Obtain the control information that the Location
 and Surveys Unit used in establishing the localized coordinate system, specifically the
 rotation, scaling, translation and coordinates for the azimuth pairs. Newly developed
 GPS procedures and techniques that do not conform to this section may be used, if
 approved.

 (D) Construction Debris
 Cover construction debris and all broken pavement and masonry with a minimum
 6 inch thick layer of earth waste material from the project or borrow. Shape the
 completed waste area as required above for the disposal of earth or rock waste.
 (E) Erosion Control
 Detail the temporary and permanent erosion control measures, along with design
 calculations, that are intended during use of the site and as part of the reclamation.
 Unless considered impractical due to special circumstances, provide in the plan for the
 use of staged permanent seeding and mulching and appropriate fertilizer topdressing on
 a continual basis during site use and the immediate total reclamation of the site when the
 site is no longer needed. Define the seed mixture proposed for establishing temporary
 and/or permanent vegetation. Establish permanent stand of vegetation before acceptance
 of project.
 (F) Evaluation for Potential Wetlands and Endangered Species
 
 17
 18
 19
 20
 
 Hire an experienced environmental consultant on the Department’s approved list to
 perform an assessment of the waste site for potential conflicts with wetlands, areas of
 environmental concern, federally listed threatened or endangered species, and federal
 species of concern.

 Delineate the boundaries of any wetlands or jurisdictional surface waters (streams)
 encountered. Follow the standard practice for documenting the wetland delineation
 including completion of the US Army Corps of Engineer’s approved Wetland
 Determination Data Form. Document information including data regarding soil,
 vegetation and hydrology. Maintain a minimum 25 foot buffer adjacent to all sides of the
 wetland boundary and a minimum 50 foot buffer adjacent to any stream. Depict the
 limits of the delineated wetland and surrounding buffer on the Reclamation Plan. Do not
 dispose of waste and debris in any area under the Corps of Engineers’ or any other
 environmental agencies’ regulatory jurisdiction unless and until the NCDOT permit has
 been modified to permit such disposal activity in the jurisdictional area.
 
 31
 32
 33
 34
 35
 
 Perform a site assessment for federally listed threatened or endangered species to include
 habitats that may support these species. Provide to the Engineer a detailed report on the
 assessment findings. If federally listed threatened or endangered species, or habitat that
 may support such species, exist on the proposed waste site, notify the Engineer before
 continued pursuit of such site.

 (G) Buffer Zones
 Allocate sufficient area between the nearest property line and the tie-in of the slope to
 natural ground to allow for the operation of excavation, hauling, and seeding equipment
 and for the installation of any and all erosion control devices required. Leave additional
 undisturbed area between the source and any watercourse or body to prevent siltation of
 the watercourse or body and the movement of the shore line either into the watercourse or
 body or into the waste areas. Determine if the adjoining property owners or other
 government agencies require any additional buffer zones and comply with those
 requirements. [Suggested minimum distances are 10 feet from property lines and 50 feet
 from water bodies or watercourses.] Do not place waste material within the 100-year
 floodplain unless superseded by an environmental permit.
 (H) Approval
 Obtain written approval from the Engineer before wasting within the proposed waste or
 disposal area.

 6
 
 This section consists of the general requirements for the construction of all incidental concrete
 construction. The provisions of Sections 838, 840, 846, 848, 850, 852, 853, 854, 855, 857
 and 858 will prevail over any conflicting requirements of this section.

 825-2
 
 8
 
 (A) General
 
 FORMS
 
 9
 10
 11
 12
 
 Maintain forms true to the required lines, grades and dimensions. Construct forms with
 material of such strength and with sufficient rigidity to prevent any appreciable deflection
 between supports. Provide mortar-tight forms with a fillet at sharp corners when
 indicated in the plans.
 
 13
 14
 15
 16
 17
 
 Design clamps, pins, metal spacers, anchorages and other connecting devices to hold the
 forms rigidly together. Construct or install any metal spacers or anchorages that are
 required within the forms so that the metal work can be removed to a depth of at least
 1 inch from the exposed surface of the concrete without injury to the surface. The recess
 thus formed in the concrete shall have a diameter no greater than 1.5 times the depth.
 
 18
 19
 20
 21
 
 Maintain the shape, strength, rigidity and surface smoothness of forms that are to be
 re-used at all times. Thoroughly clean all dirt, mortar and foreign material from forms
 before reusing. Thoroughly coat all inside form surfaces with commercial quality form
 oil or other equivalent coating before placing concrete.
 
 22
 
 (B) Wood Forms
 
 23
 24
 
 Provide forms with a smooth and uniform texture. Make joints between forms tight and
 even so that no appreciable form marks remain after the forms are removed.
 
 25
 26
 
 Do not use plywood sheets showing torn grain, worn edges, patches or other defects that
 impair the texture of concrete surfaces exposed to view.
 
 27
 28
 29
 30
 31
 
 (C) Metal Forms
 Use metal forms of such thickness and rigidity that the forms will remain true to shape.
 Counter-sink bolt and rivet heads. Use only metal forms that present a smooth surface
 and line up properly. Keep metal forms free from all foreign matter that will discolor the
 concrete.
 
 32
 
 825-3
 
 REINFORCEMENT
 
 33
 
 Furnish and place reinforcement as shown in the plans and in accordance with Section 425.
 
 34
 
 825-4
 
 35
 36
 
 Do not place concrete until the foundation, the adequacy of the forms, the placing of
 reinforcement and other embedded items have been inspected and approved.
 
 37
 
 Place concrete in daylight unless an approved lighting system is provided.
 
 38
 39
 40
 
 Remove all debris from the interior of forms in preparation for placing concrete. Moisten
 earth or base course surfaces on which concrete is to be placed immediately before placing
 concrete. Do not place concrete on excessively wet or frozen surfaces.
 
 41
 42
 
 Place concrete in its final position in the forms within the time stipulated in
 Subarticle 1000-4(E).
 
 PLACING CONCRETE
 
 8-17
 
 Section 825
 1
 2
 3
 4
 
 Place concrete to avoid segregation of the materials and the displacement of the
 reinforcement. Thoroughly work the concrete during placement. Bring mortar against the
 forms to produce a smooth finish, substantially free from water and air pockets or
 honeycombs.
 
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
 
 Do not place concrete when the air temperature, measured at the location of the concrete
 operation in the shade away from artificial heat, is below 35°F unless permission is otherwise
 granted. When such permission is granted, uniformly heat the aggregates and water to
 a temperature no higher than 150°F. Place the heated concrete at a temperature of at
 least 55°F and no more than 80°F.
 
 10

 constructed.
 (B) Ordinary Surface Finish
 
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 
 Remove all form ties or metal spacers to a depth of at least 1 inch below the surface of
 the concrete and clean and fill the resulting holes or depressions with grout. Metal
 devices with exposed cross-sectional area not exceeding approximately 0.05 sq. inches on
 surfaces permanently in contact with earth fill may be broken off flush with the surface of
 the concrete.
 
 22
 23
 24
 
 Remove all fins caused by form joints and other projections. Remove stains and
 discoloration. Clean all pockets and fill with grout as directed. Thoroughly soak the
 surface of all concrete with water before the application of a grout repair.
 
 25
 26
 27
 28
 
 Use grout consisting of one part cement and two parts sand. Use cement from the same
 source as originally incorporated in work. Cure the grout for at least 3 days. After the
 grout has thoroughly hardened, rub the patch with a carborundum stone as required to
 match the texture and color of the adjacent concrete.
 
 29
 30
 31
 
 On surfaces that are to be backfilled or surfaces that are enclosed, the removal of form
 marks, fins and pockets; the rubbing of grouted areas to uniform color; and the removal
 of stains and discoloration will not be required.
 
 32
 
 (C) Sidewalk Finish
 
 33
 34
 35
 36
 
 Strike off fresh concrete and compact until a layer of mortar is brought to the surface.
 Finish the surface to grade and cross section with a float, trowel smooth and finish with
 a broom.
 (D) Rubbed Finish
 
 37
 38
 39
 40
 41
 42
 43
 
 After the ordinary surface finish has been completed, thoroughly wet and rub the entire
 surface. Use a coarse carborundum stone or other equally good abrasive to bring the
 surface to a smooth texture and remove all form marks. Carefully stroke the surface with
 a clean brush to finish the paste formed by rubbing. Alternatively, spread the paste
 uniformly over the surface and allow it to take a reset. Finish by floating with a canvas,
 carpet-faced or cork float or rub down with dry burlap.
 (E) Float Finish
 
 44
 45
 
 Finish the surface with a rough carpet float or other suitable device leaving the surface
 even but distinctly sandy or pebbled in texture.

 CONSTRUCTION METHODS
 
 Only clear the ground that is necessary to erect a clear fence line. Clearing includes
 satisfactory removal and disposal of all trees, brush, stumps, existing fence or other
 objectionable material. Erect the fence to conform to the general contour of the ground.
 Place the bottom of the fabric or wire no more than 6 inches above the natural ground,
 except where the Engineer directs that ditches and depressions are to be spanned by using
 extra length posts in conjunction with additional barbed wire installed between the
 bottom of the fence wire or fabric and the ground surface. Grade along the fence line to
 meet the above requirement such that no obstructions to proper drainage are created.
 (B) Setting Posts and Braces
 
 23
 24
 25
 26
 
 Set and maintain all posts in a vertical position. Line posts may be hand set or set with
 a post driver. Thoroughly tamp all backfilled material if hand set. If power driven, wood
 posts may be sharpened to a dull point. Remove and replace posts that are damaged by
 power driving.
 
 27
 28
 29
 30
 31
 
 Set posts in concrete anchors to maintain the position and alignment of the post when
 required in the plans or where dictated by soil conditions. Forms are not required for the
 concrete. Trowel the top of the concrete to a smooth finish and slope to drain away from
 the post. The concrete anchors require at least a 3 day curing period before any load is
 placed on the post.
 
 32
 33
 34
 35
 36
 37
 38
 
 Instead of setting roll formed steel line posts in concrete, such posts may be driven
 provided they are not part of a line brace assembly. Drive the posts at least 3 feet into the
 ground. Provide adequate protection to the post tops to prevent damage from the driving
 operations. Repair damage to the zinc coating in accordance with Article 1076-7. Set
 posts in concrete anchors where soil conditions are such that the posts cannot be driven
 without deformation, or where soils are encountered that does not provide adequate
 in-ground stability.

 Where rock or concrete pavement or slabs are encountered within the required depth
 where fence posts are to be erected, drill a hole in the rock or concrete of a diameter
 slightly larger than the largest dimension of the post in the rock or concrete and grout in
 the post. The depth of post embedment shown in the plans will not be required and the
 post may be shortened as necessary, provided the post is embedded within the rock or
 concrete pavement or slab to a minimum depth of 12 inches.

 directed. When the use of short pieces of woven wire is permitted, furnish and install the
 additional required brace posts and braces. Approved splicing sleeves may be used
 instead of providing such brace posts and braces.
 (C) Installing Fabric and Wire
 (1) Chain Link Fence
 
 15
 16
 17
 18
 19
 20
 
 Attach chain link fabric to tubular end, gate, corner or brace posts with stretcher bars
 and stretcher bar bands as shown in the plan. Fasten the fabric to line posts and to
 top and brace rails with wire fasteners spaced and wound as shown in the plans.
 Fasten the fabric to the tension wire by hog rings spaced at 24 inch intervals or
 weave the tension wire through the fabric. Make hog ring ties at fabric joints with
 the hog ring passing completely around the fabric joint.
 
 21
 22
 23
 
 Place chain link fabric by securing or fastening on end and applying sufficient
 tension to remove all slack before making permanent attachments elsewhere. Apply
 the tension for stretching by mechanical fence stretchers designed for this purpose.
 
 24
 25
 26
 
 Connect rolls and pieces of chain link fabric to each other by field weaving provided
 that such weaving is identical in appearance and strength as the machine weaving
 done at the factory.
 
 27
 28
 29
 30
 31
 
 Attach barbed wire used in conjunction with chain link fabric, to the post by eyebolt
 or by a tie wire passing through holes drilled in the metal post to prevent any vertical
 movement of the barbed wire. Wrap the ends and beginnings of strands around the
 post twice and securely fasten by winding the end around the wire near the post.
 Splice barbed wire only at posts.
 
 32
 
 Install additional barbed wire when shown in the plans or where directed.

 Stretch woven wire fabric taut and securely attach to each post with one or more
 staples in each line of wire. Use as many staples as required to firmly secure the
 wire at the location and elevation required by the plans. When woven wire is
 attached to metal posts, use at least five clips at each post to fasten the individual
 strands of wire to the post except where wrapping of the strand around the post is
 required. Stretch with an approved stretcher that will produce equal tension in each
 line of wire.
 
 41
 42
 43
 44
 
 At each end or gate post, at the center post in each line brace and at corner posts
 except as otherwise shown in the plans, cut out all vertical strands of wire and wrap
 each horizontal strand of wire around the post and securely fasten by winding the
 end around the strand of wire near the post.

 Before applying retroreflective sheeting to the aluminum, treat the aluminum sign
 surfaces with a chromate conversion coating. Such coating shall be applied
 according to the manufacturer's instruction and shall conform to ASTM B449,
 Class 2, and should range in color from silvery iridescent to pale yellow. The
 coating weight shall be 10 mg/sf to 35 mg/sf on the entire surface area including
 along the edges of the sign substrate with a median of 25 mg/sf as the optimum
 coating weight. Ensure the coating does not appear dusty when wiped with a clean,
 lint-free cloth and does not show excessive buildup at edges. Sand smooth all burrs
 and scratches before applying retroreflective sheeting. Sheet all sanded aluminum
 within the same day to prevent the formation of corrosion on the metal. Do not sand
 or use abrasive materials on sheeted faces. Aluminum products shall be randomly
 tested.

 increment sign using glass beaded materials, sheet the entire sign from the same roll.
 
 20
 21
 22
 23
 
 If a sign panel needs to be replaced after sign fabrication, the replacement panel may be
 sheeted with retroreflective materials from a different lot or drum number than the
 remainder of the sign; however, use material that visually color matches and meets
 Article 1092-2.
 
 24
 25
 
 Take retroreflectometer readings on all 4 corners of each panel and document the
 readings on the sign design drawings.
 
 26
 27
 
 Overlap all splices of any encapsulated or enclosed lens sheeting to allow water to run off
 without running into the splice. All prismatic sheeting will be butt spliced.
 
 28
 
 Remove all foreign materials on the sheeted face with compressed air.
 
 29
 
 Keep a sample of each roll of sheeting and test for retroreflective compliance.
 
 30
 31
 32
 33
 
 Patch wrinkles in the sheeting around thru bolts by removing the affected sheeting from
 the metal. Then patch this area with a circular patch encompassing an area 1/4
 inch outside the affected area. This patch shall not exceed the standard patching limits
 shown in Table 901-3.
 
 34
 35
 
 Ensure that all patches on the sign have a 1 inch minimum width or as recommended by
 the sheeting manufacturer.

 Permanent traffic signs printed with digital ink systems will be fabricated with a full sign
 Protective Overlay Film designed to protect the entire sign from fading and UV
 degradation. The over laminate will comply with the retroreflective sheeting
 manufacturer’s recommendations to ensure proper adhesion and transparency and will
 also meet the reflective film durability in Subarticle 1092-2(B).
 
 20

 SIGN QUALITY
 
 24
 25
 
 Provide signs that present a uniform appearance free from color match problems, non-uniform
 color, streaks, spots, abrasions, blistering or other defects in the sheeting.
 
 26
 27
 28
 
 Sheeting may be inspected before application to sign blanks, after installation to sign blanks,
 after completion of the sign in the sign fabricator's facility and after installation. Clean all
 installed signs before final field inspection.
 
 29
 30
 31
 
 The retroreflective sheeting will be unsatisfactory if it has deteriorated due to any cause
 except defacement resulting from vandalism or damage resulting from impact by a motor
 vehicle or other object to the extent that:
 
 32
 33
 
 (A) The sign is ineffective for its intended purpose when viewed from a moving vehicle
 under normal day and night driving conditions, or
 
 34
 35
 36
 
 (B) The coefficient of retroreflection is less than the minimum specified for that sheeting as
 shown in Tables 1092-3, 1092-4 and 1092-5 when measured by a Department approved
 retroreflectometer, or
 
 37
 38
 39
 
 (C) The screened message and border or reverse screened background has stained,
 discolored, streaked, faded, turned dark or has developed cracks, scaling, pitting and/or
 blistering, or
 
 40
 41
 
 (D) The sign is unsatisfactory with regard to uniform appearance due to cracking, streaking,
 delamination, blistering, crazing or discoloration of the sheeting, or
 
 42
 43
 44
 
 (E) The sign is unsatisfactory with regard to remaining uniform in color over the entire
 reflecting surface both day and night and displaying the same color both in daylight and
 under lights at night.
 
 45
 46
 47
 48
 
 (1) For glass bead material, sheeting will be subjected to a visual test with the human
 eye as the test instrument. Objectionable non-uniformity of color and reflectivity
 (retroreflection) under light at night is cause for the sign to be tested for
 retroreflection to determine compliance with the following requirements:
 9-9
 
 Section 902

 The retroreflection values on any sign shall not vary from each other by more than
 a ratio of 1.10 (1.20 white) at any 2 points at least 12 inches apart, nor more than
 1.30 (1.30 white) at any 2 points anywhere on the sign, nor more than,
 1.10 (1.20 white) at any 2 points on the border or between any 2 adjacent letters,
 numerals or symbols. Failure to meet the above requirements will result in sign
 rejection. Retroreflection will be tested using a Delta RetroSign retroreflectometer.

 Submit concrete paving mix design in terms of saturated surface dry weights on Materials
 and Tests Form 312U for approval at least 30 days before proposed use. Use a mix that
 contains at least 526 lbs. of cement per cubic yard, a maximum water cement ratio of
 0.559, an air content in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%, a maximum slump of 1.5 inches, a
 minimum flexural strength of 650 psi at 28 days and a minimum compressive strength of
 4,500 psi at 28 days.
 
 9
 10
 
 Fly ash may be substituted for cement in the mix design up to 30% at a rate of 1.0 lb. of
 fly ash to each pound of cement replaced.
 
 11
 12
 
 The cement content of the mix design may be reduced by no more than 50% and replaced
 with blast furnace slag pound for pound.

 Include in the mix design the source of aggregates, cement, fly ash, slag, water and
 admixtures; the gradation and specific gravity of the aggregates; the fineness modulus of
 the fine aggregate; and the dry rodded unit weight and size of the coarse aggregate.
 Submit test results showing that the mix design conforms to the criteria, including the
 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28-day strengths of the average of two 6 inch x 6 inch x 20 inch beams and
 the average of two 6 inch x 12 inch cylinders for each age made and tested in accordance
 with AASHTO R 39, T22 and T97 from a certified laboratory. Design the mix to produce
 an average strength sufficient to indicate that a minimum strength of 650 psi in flexure
 and 4,500 psi in compression will be achieved in the field within 28 days.
 
 22
 23
 24
 25
 
 Where concrete with a higher slump for hand methods of placing and finishing is
 necessary, submit an adjusted mix design for approval to provide a maximum slump of
 3 inches and to maintain the water-cementitious material ratio established by the original
 mix design.
 
 26
 
 (B) Air Entrainment

 33
 34
 
 Provide an air content of 5.0% ± 1.5% in the freshly mixed concrete. The air content will
 be determined in accordance with AASHTO T 121, T152 or T196. At the option of the
 Engineer, the air content may be measured by the Chace Indicator, in which case
 sufficient tests will be made to establish correlation with the test methods of AASHTO
 T 121, T152 or T196. Concrete will not be rejected based on tests from the Chase
 Indicator.
 
 35
 
 (C) Slump
 
 36
 37
 
 Provide concrete with a maximum slump of 1.5 inches where placed by a fully
 mechanized paving train and no more than 3 inches where placed by hand methods.

 Entrain air in the concrete unless otherwise indicated in the plans or in the Specifications.
 Add an air entraining agent at the time of mixing to produce an air content in the freshly
 mixed concrete of 6.0% ± 1.5% when tested at the job site. Determine the air content in
 accordance with AASHTO T 121, T152 or T196. Measurement of air content may also
 be performed by the Chace Indicator, in which case sufficient tests will be made in
 accordance with AASHTO T 121, T152 or T196 to establish correlation with the Chace
 Indicator. Concrete for structures will not be rejected based on tests made with the Chase
 Indicator. Concrete for incidental construction may be rejected based on an average of
 3 or more tests made with the Chase Indicator.
 
 34
 
 Air entraining agent may be added at the job site when permitted by the Engineer.

 The compressive strength of the concrete will be considered the average compressive
 strength test results of two 6 inch x 12 inch cylinders, or two 4 inch x 8 inch cylinders if
 the aggregate size is not larger than size 57 or 57M. Make cylinders in accordance with
 AASHTO T 23 from the concrete delivered to the work. Make cylinders at such
 frequencies as the Engineer may determine and cure them in accordance with AASHTO
 T 23 as modified by the Department. Copies of these modified test procedures are
 available upon request from the Materials and Tests Unit.

 When the average compressive strength of the concrete test cylinders is less than the
 minimum strength specified in Table 1000-1 and the Engineer determines it is within
 reasonable close conformity with strength requirements, concrete strength will be
 considered acceptable. When the Engineer determines average cylinder strength is below
 the specification, the in-place concrete will be tested. Based on these test results, the
 concrete will either be accepted with no reduction in payment or accepted at a reduced
 unit price or rejected as set forth in Article 105-3.

 8
 
 Use an approved set retarding admixture in all concrete placed in the superstructure of
 bridges such that the concrete will remain workable until the entire operation of placing
 and finishing, including corrective measures, if necessary, has been completed. The
 Engineer may waive the use of set retarding admixture when conditions clearly indicate
 that it is not needed.
 
 9
 10
 
 Other structural concrete may contain an approved set retarding admixture when
 permitted by the Engineer.
 
 11
 12
 
 Use a quantity of set retarding admixture within the range shown on the current list of
 approved admixtures issued by the Materials and Tests Unit.
 
 13
 
 (G) Use of Water Reducing Admixtures
 
 14
 15
 
 By permission of the Engineer, the Contractor may use an approved water reducing
 admixture to facilitate placing and finishing.
 
 16
 17
 
 Use a quantity of water reducing admixture within the range shown on the current list of
 approved admixtures issued by the Materials and Tests Unit.
 
 18
 
 (H) Use of Calcium Chloride
 
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 25
 
 Calcium chloride may be used as a set accelerating agent where permitted by the
 Engineer. Use one lb. of calcium chloride per 100 lbs. of cement except where lesser
 amounts are directed. Do not use calcium chloride where steel reinforcement, metal
 conduit or other metals will be in contact with the concrete. Do not use calcium chloride
 in concrete that has a temperature higher than 70°F, or when the air temperature is greater
 than 70°F. Provide cold weather protection for concrete containing calcium chloride in
 the same manner as is provided for concrete without calcium chloride.
 
 26
 27
 28
 
 Use calcium chloride in liquid form. Use a solution of one lb. or less of calcium chloride
 per one quart of water and mix well. To avoid incompatibility with other additives, add
 the calcium chloride to the batch after all other ingredients have been put into the mixer.

 (I) Use of Fly Ash
 Fly ash may be substituted for cement in the mix design up to 30% at a rate of 1.0 lb. of
 fly ash to each pound of cement replaced. Use Table 1000-1 to determine the maximum
 allowable water-cementitious material (cement + fly ash) ratio for the classes of concrete
 listed.
 (J) Use of Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag
 For mixes that contain cement and ground granulated blast furnace slag, the
 water-cementitious ratio (cement and slag) shall not exceed the water-cement ratio shown
 in Table 1000-1.

 Units with calcium nitrite in a quantity less than specified are subject to rejection.
 Furnish concrete powder drilled from representative cylinders to the Engineer, in a
 quantity to be specified, to verify the concentrations of calcium nitrite in hardened
 concrete. Concrete that fails to contain calcium nitrite at the required concentrations as
 tested is subject to rejection. Use air-entraining, water-reducing and/or set-controlling
 admixtures compatible with calcium nitrite solutions. Strictly adhere to the
 manufacturer’s written recommendations regarding the use of admixtures, including
 storage, transportation and method of mixing. If preferred, use calcium nitrite, which
 acts as an accelerator, in conjunction with a retarder to control the set of concrete, as per
 the manufacturer’s recommendation. Add an approved calcium nitrite corrosion inhibitor
 (30% solids) to the concrete mix at the batch plant for the bridge elements identified by
 the plan notes. Use the inhibitor at a minimum rate of 3.0 gal/cy. Ensure that the
 hardened concrete contains at least 5.8 lbs/cy nitrite (NO2) when tested in accordance
 with Materials and Tests Method Chem. C-20.0. The preceding paragraph does not apply
 to concrete used in prestressed concrete members. Concrete used in prestressed concrete
 members shall be tested in accordance with Subarticle 1078-4(G).
 
 18
 
 1000-5 HIGH EARLY STRENGTH PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 
 19
 20
 
 Use high early strength Portland cement concrete when required by contract. When not
 required, it may be used at the Contractor’s option with approval of the Engineer.
 
 21
 22
 23
 
 For all classes of concrete, high early strength concrete may be produced by using
 Type III Portland cement. To produce high early strength concrete with regular cement, use
 a higher class of concrete as follows:
 
 24
 25
 26
 
 For Class A and Class B, use Class AA with a cement content of at least 677 lbs/cy. Other
 classes that lend themselves to high early strength with regular cement will be reviewed by
 the Engineer on a case-by-case basis.
 
 27
 
 1000-6 FLOWABLE FILL
 
 28
 29
 
 Flowable fill consists of Portland cement, water, supplementary cementitious materials and/or
 fine aggregate and, optionally, concrete admixtures.
 
 30
 31
 32
 
 Submit the proposed mix design on Materials and Tests Form 312U at least 35 days before
 use. Use a testing laboratory approved by the Department to determine mix proportions based
 on laboratory trial batches meeting Table 1000-1.
 
 33
 34
 35
 36
 37
 
 State on Form 312U the intended use of the material (excavatable or non-excavatable).
 Accompany Form 312U with a listing of compressive strength of at least three 4 inch x 8 inch
 cylinders at the age of 28 or 56 days, depending on whether the mix is to be excavated or not.
 Air cure the cylinders during the entire period before testing. The Engineer will advise the
 Contractor in writing of the acceptability of the mix design.

 printout to indicate the quantity of cement.
 
 9
 10
 11
 12
 13
 14
 15
 16
 
 (3) Calibrate the mixers to accurately proportion the specified mix. Before placing latex
 modified concrete, perform calibration and yield tests under the Engineer’s
 supervision in accordance with the Department’s written instructions. Copies of
 these written instructions are available from the Materials and Tests Unit. Perform
 the calibration and yield tests using the material to be used on the project.
 Recalibrate the mixer after any major maintenance operation on the mixer, anytime
 the source of materials changes or as directed. Furnish all materials and equipment
 necessary to perform the calibrations and yield tests.
 
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 
 (4) Use a mixer that controls the flow of water and latex emulsion into the mix.
 Measure the flow rate of water and the latex emulsion with a calibrated flowmeter
 coordinated with both the cement and aggregate feeding mechanisms and the mixer.
 Adjust the flow rate, as necessary, to control the slump and ensure that the watercement ratios are met. In addition to flowmeters, use mixers with accumulative
 water and latex meters capable of indicating the number of gallons, to the nearest
 0.1 gallon, introduced into the mixer. Filter water and latex with a suitable mesh
 filter before it flows through the accumulative water and latex meters.
 
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 
 (5) Calibrate the mixer to automatically proportion and blend all components of the
 indicated composition on a continuous or intermittent basis as the finishing operation
 requires. Provide a mixer that discharges mixed material through a conventional
 chute and is capable of spraying water over the placement width as it moves ahead to
 ensure that the surface to be overlaid is wet before receiving the modified material.
 
 30
 
 (6) Mount a tachometer on the unit to indicate the drive shaft speed.
 
 31
 32
 
 (7) Use adequate hand tools for placing and leveling concrete down to approximately the
 correct level for striking off with the screed.

 39
 40
 41
 
 (8) Use a finishing machine that meets the approval of the Engineer and the
 requirements of the contract. Use a self-propelled finishing machine capable of
 forward and reverse movement under positive control. Use a machine with at least 2
 finishing devices, one that is a vibrating screed and the other either a vibrating
 screed, oscillating screed, or one or more rotating cylindrical drums 48 inches long
 or less and operating between 1,500 and 2,500 vpm. Make certain the finishing
 machine can finish the surface to within 1 foot of the edges of the area being placed.
 Raise all screeds when the finishing machine is moving backwards over the screeded
 surface.
 
 42
 43
 44
 
 (9) Use screeds with a vibration frequency that is variable between 3,000 and 6,000 vpm
 with positive controls. Use screeds with a metal covered bottom face not less than
 4 inches wide. Provide screeds with positive control of the vertical position.
 
 45

 which is the required weight plus the total weight of surface moisture contained in the
 aggregate. Ensure the individual aggregates, as weighed, are within ± 2% of the required
 weights.
 (C) Water
 Measure water by volume or by weight. Ensure the quantity of water measured is
 within ± 1% of the required amount.
 (D) Admixture Dispensing Systems
 
 10
 11
 12
 13
 14
 15
 
 Provide a separate dispensing system with separate fill and discharge lines for each type
 of admixture to be used, except that admixtures may be measured and introduced into the
 mix manually if approval has been obtained. Ensure each system is capable of
 measuring, displaying and discharging the required amount of admixture into the mix.
 Keep dispensing systems clean and in good operating condition. Use a dispensing system
 that is either:
 
 16
 
 (1) Manually operated, self-contained; or
 
 17
 
 (2) Semi-automatic or automatic, self-contained; or
 
 18
 
 (3) Interfaced to operate automatically with the concrete batching control panel.
 
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 
 Have the admixture dispenser dispense the required quantity of admixture for each
 concrete batch within an accuracy of ± 3%. Check the accuracy of the dispenser as
 provided below. Check the accuracy at the point of discharge, or through a bypass valve
 suitable for obtaining a calibrated sample of admixture and at the volumes normally used
 for one half mixer capacity and for full mixer capacity. Determine the accuracy at the
 time of installation and check daily during the early part of each day’s operation.
 
 25
 26
 27
 28
 
 Include in each system a graduated measuring unit into which the admixture is batched to
 permit a quick visual check of accuracy before its discharge. Ensure the measuring unit
 is clearly graduated and be of sufficient size to hold the maximum anticipated dose for
 one batch. Clearly mark the measuring unit for the type of admixture to be used.
 
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 34
 
 Control the discharge sequence so an admixture will not be brought into contact with raw
 cement or another admixture before being diluted through contact with the mixing water
 in the mixer. Where 2 types of admixtures are being used, do not discharge them into the
 mix simultaneously. Add the air entraining agent with the first addition of water and add
 any other chemical admixture with the final addition of water, unless otherwise
 permitted.
 
 35
 36
 37
 
 Construct the discharge lines to completely empty after each cycle. Locate the admixture
 dispensing systems so the batching plant operator will have a visual verification of the
 actual quantity of admixture batched.
 
 38
 39
 40
 41
 42
 
 Use air entraining admixtures in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations
 and in such quantity to provide the specified air content in freshly mixed concrete. Use
 a quantity of set retarding admixture and of water reducing admixture per 100 lbs. of
 cement that is within the range recommended on the current list of approved admixtures
 issued by the Materials and Tests Unit.

 Plants shall meet all the applicable requirements of these Standard Specifications, and in
 addition, ensure each ready mix plant provides at least three acceptable truck mixers or
 truck agitators available for use. Use trucks that have an identifying number. Plants
 approved by the Department will be placed on a list of approved plants available to the
 Contractor. All plants will be subject to reinspection at intervals selected by the
 Engineer. Reapproval after each inspection will be contingent on continuing compliance
 with the Standard Specifications.
 (B) Bins and Hoppers
 Provide bins with separate compartments for fine aggregates and for each required size of
 coarse aggregate in the batching plant. Design each compartment to discharge efficiently
 and freely into the weighing hopper. Provide control so, as the quantity desired is being
 approached, the material may be added slowly and shut off with precision. Construct
 weighing hoppers to eliminate accumulation of tare materials and to discharge fully
 unless otherwise permitted. Provide a port or other opening for removing an overload of
 any one of the several materials from the hopper.
 (C) Scales
 Use either the beam type, load cell type or the springless dial type scales for weighing
 aggregates and cement. Ensure the minimum graduation on beam or dial is not more than
 0.1% of the total capacity of the scale. Methods of weighing, other than beam or
 springless dial scales, may be approved by the Engineer provided they meet the required
 weighing tolerances. Ensure the scales are accurate within 0.5% under operating
 conditions. Make available ten 50 lb. test weights at the plant for checking accuracy.
 Use test weights which meet the U.S. Bureau of Standards requirements for calibrating
 and testing equipment. Keep all exposed fulcrums, clevises and similar working parts of
 scales clean. When beam type scales are used, make provisions for indicating to the
 operator that the required load in the weighing hopper is being approached. Ensure the
 device indicates at least the last 50 lbs. of load and design it to give a positive indication
 of overload of the scales. During charging of the hopper, have all indicating devices in
 full view of the operator and provide convenient access to all controls. Ensure the
 indicating devices are in the immediate vicinity of the operator and easily readable by the
 operator.
 (D) Water Measuring Devices
 Use devices for measurement of the water which are readily adjustable and are capable of
 being set to deliver the required amount and cut off the flow automatically when this
 amount has been discharged. Under all operating conditions the device shall have
 accuracy within 1% of the quantity of water required for the batch. Arrange the device so
 variable pressures in the water supply line will not affect the measurements. Use
 measuring tanks of adequate capacity to furnish the maximum mixing water required and
 equip them with outside taps and valves to provide for checking their calibration unless
 other means are provided for readily and accurately determining the amounts in the tank.

 Mixers are defined as equipment to mix concrete and may be stationary or truck
 mounted. Agitators are defined as equipment used to haul central mixed concrete and
 may be truck mixers or truck agitators. Provide a metal plate or plates attached to each
 mixer and agitator in a prominent place on which the manufacturer has plainly marked
 the mixing speed of the drum or paddles and the maximum capacity of the drum or
 container in terms of volume of mixed concrete. On truck mixers and agitators, show the
 manufacturer’s recommended agitating and mixing speed of rotation of the mixing drum
 or blades. Equip stationary mixers with an acceptable timing device that will not permit
 the batch to be discharged until the specified mixing time has elapsed. Equip truck
 10-13
 
 Section 1000

 mixers with counters to verify the number of revolutions of the drum or blades. Actuate
 the counters at the initial time the drums have reached mixing speed.
 
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 
 Examine mixers and agitators periodically for changes in condition due to accumulation
 of hard concrete or mortar, wear of blades or any other condition which decreases mixing
 efficiency. Mixers are unacceptable when the radial height or other dimension of the
 blade has worn below 90% of the original dimension. This radial height excludes any
 lips on the blade and is the height of the blade running perpendicular to the shell of the
 drum. Where such conditions are found, do not use the units until they are corrected.
 
 9
 10
 11
 
 Also examine mixers and agitators periodically for general mechanical condition,
 including water measuring and discharge apparatus, identifying number on trucks,
 condition of the blades, speed of rotation of the drum and condition of the drum.
 
 12
 
 (B) Mixer Capacity
 
 13
 14
 15
 16
 17
 18
 19
 
 Do not load truck mixers with concrete with more than 63% of the gross volume of the
 drum. Use mixers capable of combining the ingredients of the concrete into a thoroughly
 mixed and uniform mass and of discharging the concrete with a satisfactory degree of
 uniformity. Use stationary mixers, when loaded at the manufacturers guaranteed mixing
 capacity and the concrete mixed for the prescribed mixing time, capable of combining the
 ingredients of the concrete into a thoroughly mixed and uniform mass and discharging
 the concrete with satisfactory uniformity.
 
 20
 21
 
 Use at least 20% of the rated mixing capacity as the minimum quantity of concrete
 permitted to be mixed or agitated in any mixer.
 
 22

 (C) Agitator Capacity
 Load the agitator to not exceed 80% of the gross drum volume and have it be capable of
 maintaining the concrete in a thoroughly mixed and uniform mass and of discharging the
 concrete with a satisfactory degree of uniformity.
 (D) Consistency Tests
 The Engineer may, from time to time, make slump tests to measure consistency of the
 concrete. Take individual samples at approximately the 1/5th point, the midpoint and the
 4/5th point of the load, using AASHTO T 119. Such tests will be made within
 20 minutes of discharge of that portion of the load. If the results vary by more than 1
 inch in slump, do not use the mixer or agitator unless the condition is corrected.
 
 32
 
 1000-11 MIXING AND DELIVERY
 
 33
 
 (A) General
 
 34
 35

 When concrete is being produced for structures and incidental construction in accordance
 with Article 1000-4, have present during all batching operations a Certified Concrete
 Batch Technician employed by the Contractor or concrete supplier. During batching and
 delivery, the sole duty of this employee is to supervise the production and control of the
 concrete. Perform moisture tests, adjust mix proportions of aggregates for free moisture,
 complete and sign Batch Tickets (Materials and Tests Form 903) or approved delivery
 tickets and assure quality control of the batching. Delivery tickets will be permitted
 instead of batch tickets (Materials and Tests Form 903) provided they have been
 reviewed and approved by the Materials and Tests Unit. The Department certifies
 technicians who satisfactorily complete examinations prepared and administered by the
 Department.

 (1) Central Mixed Concrete
 Concrete that is mixed completely in a stationary mixer and the mixed concrete
 transported to the point of delivery in a truck agitator or in a truck mixer operating at
 agitating speed or in non-agitating equipment approved by the Engineer. Perform
 mixing within the capacity and at the mixing speeds recommended by the
 manufacturer.
 (2) Transit Mixed Concrete
 Concrete that is mixed completely in a truck mixer while at the batching plant, in
 transit, or at the work site.
 (3) Shrink Mixed Concrete
 Concrete that is mixed partially in a stationary mixer at a central mixing plant and
 completed as transit mixed concrete. Place all ingredients for a batch in the
 stationary mixer, partially mix before any concrete is discharged to the truck mixer
 and do not exceed the rated capacity of the equipment for the batch size. The mixing
 time at the stationary mixer may be reduced to the minimum necessary to
 intermingle the ingredients, and the mixing may be completed in the truck mixer.
 Use the number of mixing revolutions in the truck mixer as specified for transit
 mixed concrete or reduce as indicated by mixer performance tests.
 (B) Mixing Time for Central Mixed Concrete
 
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 
 Mixing time begins when all solid materials are in the mixing compartment and ends
 when any part of the concrete begins to discharge. In charging the mixer, water will enter
 in advance of cement and aggregate. Ensure all the water is substantially in the drum
 before 1/3 of the specified mixing time has elapsed. Count transfer time in multiple drum
 mixers as part of the mixing time.
 
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
 
 Where mixer performance tests are not made, use a minimum mixing time of 90 seconds,
 providing that blending of materials during charging is achieved to the satisfaction of the
 Engineer. The minimum mixing time for an individual mixer is that which, as shown by
 mixer performance tests, will produce concrete in accordance with Table 1000-5, except
 that the mixing time shall not be less than 50 seconds under any circumstances.
 Maximum mixing time excluding discharge time is 150 seconds.
 
 31
 32
 33
 34
 35
 
 Sampling and testing for mixer performance tests will be done as provided below.
 Charge the mixer to its rated capacity with the materials and proportions to be used in the
 work and mixed at the recommended mixing speed to the target time. Stop mixing and
 begin discharging. Two samples of sufficient size to make the required tests will be
 taken after discharge of approximately 15% and 85% of the load.

 When a truck mixer is used for complete mixing, mix each batch of concrete for at least
 70 revolutions of the drum or blades at the rate of rotation designated by the
 manufacturer of the equipment as mixing speed, unless otherwise directed by the
 Engineer. Unless the mixer is equipped with a counter which will distinguish between
 mixing and agitating speeds, perform the minimum required number of revolutions of the
 drum at mixing speed as directed, either at the batching plant before the mixer leaves
 for the work site and/or at the work site before the concrete is discharged.
 Perform any additional mixing at the speed designated by the manufacturer of the
 equipment as agitating speed. Put all materials including mixing water in the drum
 before actuating the revolution counter for determining the number of revolutions of the
 drum.
 
 24
 25
 26
 
 When a truck mixer or truck agitator is used to transport concrete that has been
 completely mixed in a stationary mixer, perform mixing during transport at agitating
 speed.

 Provide concrete, when discharged from truck mixers or truck agitators, of the
 consistency and workability required for the work. Control the rate of discharge of the
 plastic concrete from the mixer drum by the speed or rotation of the drum in the
 discharge direction with the discharge gate fully open. If additional mixing water is
 necessary to produce the slump necessary for proper placement, add it only with
 permission and rotate the truck mixer drum at least 25 revolutions at mixing speed before
 discharge of any concrete. Additional mixing water will be allowed only if the maximum
 specified water content per cubic yard is not exceeded.

 plant to the site of the work. Use tickets furnished by the Engineer and fill it out in
 accordance with instructions issued by the Engineer. Issue the tickets to the truck
 operator at the proportioning plant for each load and have them signed by the plant
 inspector, which will signify that the concrete in the truck has been inspected before
 departure. Ensure each ticket shows the time batching was completed and if transit
 mixed, the number of revolutions at mixing speed, if any, at the plant. Deliver the tickets
 to the inspector at the site of the work. Do not use loads which do not carry such tickets
 and loads which do not arrive in satisfactory condition within the time limits specified in
 the work.

 notify the Contractor as to its acceptability contingent upon compressive strength test
 results for cores from preconstruction test panels. Do not use a shotcrete mix until
 written notice has been received. Acceptance of the shotcrete mix design does not relieve
 the Contractor of his responsibility to furnish a product that meets this contract. Upon
 written request from the Contractor, a shotcrete mix design accepted and used
 satisfactorily on any Department project may be accepted for use on other projects.

 (B) Chemical Admixtures
 Use a quantity of chemical admixture within the range shown on the current list of
 approved admixtures issued by the Materials and Tests Unit.
 (C) Strength of Shotcrete
 Provide shotcrete with a compressive strength at 3 and 28 days of at least 2,000 psi and
 4,000 psi, respectively. The compressive strength of the shotcrete will be considered the
 average compressive strength test results of 3 cores from the same test panel at each age.
 (D) Preconstruction Test Panels
 
 18
 19
 20
 
 Before beginning construction, provide one preconstruction test panel for each shotcrete
 mix design and nozzlemen using the same equipment that will be used for the work. Use
 3 feet x 3 feet forms at least 3.5 inches thick for preconstruction test panels.
 
 21
 22
 23
 24
 25
 
 Batch, deliver, mix and apply shotcrete in accordance with Subarticles 1002-3(E)
 and 1002-3(F) and the contract. Make preconstruction test panels in the presence of the
 Engineer with forms in a vertical position and from the same shooting position
 anticipated for construction. Do not disturb test panels for the first 24 hours after
 shotcreting.
 
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 
 (E) Mixing and Delivery
 Produce shotcrete of required strength, consistency, quality and uniformity with
 minimum rebound. Do not use rebound or previously expanded material in the shotcrete
 mix. Thoroughly mix materials in sufficient quantity to place shotcrete continuously.
 Regulate the delivery so the maximum interval between the shooting of batches at the
 work site does not exceed 20 minutes. Comply with Articles 1000-9 through 1000-12 to
 the extent applicable for shotcrete instead of concrete.
 (F) Shooting Requirements
 
 34
 35
 36
 37
 
 Use equipment capable of handling and shooting shotcrete at a steady uninterrupted flow.
 Use air supply systems that supply clean, dry air free of contamination and capable of
 maintaining sufficient nozzle velocity at all times. Apply shotcrete with the same
 equipment and methods as used for the preconstruction test panels.
 
 38
 39
 40
 41
 42
 43
 44
 
 The shotcrete temperature at the time of shooting shall be not less than 50°F nor more
 than 90°F. Do not apply shotcrete during heavy rains or runoff or high winds so the
 nozzle stream separates during shooting. Do not apply shotcrete if surface to receive
 shotcrete is frozen or the air temperature measured at the location of the shotcreting
 operation in the shade away from artificial heat is below 40°F. Apply shotcrete before
 the time between adding the mixing water to the shotcrete mix and shooting the shotcrete
 exceeds 60 minutes.
 
 45
 46
 47
 48
 
 (G) Production Test Panels
 Provide one production test panel for every 33 cy of shotcrete with at least one test panel
 for each day shotcreting occurs. Use 18 inch x 18 inch forms at least 3.5 inches thick for
 production test panels. Make production test panels with forms in a vertical position from
 10-20

 the same shooting position and at the same time as shotcreting is done. Do not disturb
 test panels for the first 24 hours after shotcreting.
 (H) Handling and Storing Test Panels
 Notify the Area Materials Engineer when preconstruction or production test panels are
 made within 24 hours of shooting the panels. Field cure and protect test panels from
 damage in accordance with ASTM C1140. The Contractor shall core the panels in the
 presence of the Engineer. The Department transports core to a Materials and Tests
 Regional Laboratory for testing.

 Obtain aggregates from sources participating in the Department’s Aggregate QC/QA Program
 as described in Section 1006. Obtain aggregates from pre-approved sources, or have the
 source approved before use. Approval of such sources is based not only on the quality of the
 aggregate, but also on satisfactory production facilities and procedures. A list of approved
 aggregate sources participating in the Department’s Aggregate QC/QA Program in North
 Carolina and adjoining states is available from the Materials and Tests Unit. This list includes
 aggregates meeting Specification requirements but whose use is restricted due to history of
 unsatisfactory service performance. Use of aggregates is allowed in the work provided they
 have been properly stockpiled in units of not less than 300 tons, tests of representative
 samples of these aggregates indicate satisfactory compliance with the Specifications and the
 source meets all the requirements of the Aggregate QC/QA Program.

 11
 12
 
 Provide sites for aggregate stockpiles that are cleared, grubbed and cleaned with a firm,
 smooth and well drained ground surface. Maintain a cover of at least 3 inches of aggregate
 over the ground surface to avoid the inclusion of soil or foreign material. Operate trucks or
 other equipment on a stockpile in an acceptable manner.
 
 13
 14
 15
 16
 17
 18
 
 Space or separate with suitable walls or partitions stockpiles of different types or sizes of
 aggregates to prevent the mixing of the aggregates. Do not allow the stockpile to become
 contaminated with foreign matter or degrade excessively. Failure of aggregate samples to
 meet all gradation requirements due to excessive degradation will be determined by sieve tests
 of samples taken from any portion of the stockpile and is cause for discontinuance of such
 stockpiling procedure.

 (A) When aggregates are used for Portland cement concrete, asphalt treatment and asphalt
 plant mix, the requirements pertaining to material passing the No. 200 sieve are as
 follows:
 
 4
 5
 
 (1) When tested in a stockpile at the quarry site, the amount of material passing the
 No. 200 sieve shall be no greater than 1.0%.
 
 6
 7
 
 (2) When tested at the job site before use, the amount of material passing the
 No. 200 sieve shall:
 
 8
 9
 
 (a) Be no greater than 1.5% for aggregate used in Portland cement concrete or
 asphalt surface treatment.
 
 10
 
 (b) Be no greater than 2.0% for aggregate used in asphalt plant mix.
 
 11
 12
 13
 
 (3) If a stockpile at the job site is found to contain in excess of the specified amount of
 material passing the No. 200 sieve before use, the Engineer may approve its use
 provided:
 
 14
 15
 16
 17
 
 (a) For aggregate used in Portland cement concrete, the total percentage by weight
 passing the No. 200 sieve in the combined coarse and fine aggregate in the mix
 does not exceed 3.5%, and provided no increase in water-cement ratio is
 required by the use of this aggregate.
 
 18
 19
 20
 21
 
 (b) For aggregate used in asphalt plant mix, the total percentage by weight of minus
 No. 200 material in the plant mix being produced, as determined by the
 extraction test, can be maintained within the limits allowed by the job mix
 formula.
 
 22
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 
 (B) For ABC and ABC(M), in addition to the gradation requirements, the material passing
 the No. 40 sieve shall not have a LL in excess of 30 nor a PI in excess of 4. For ABC
 used in asphalt plant mix, when tested during production, in a stockpile at the quarry site
 or at the job site before use, the amount of material passing the No. 200 sieve shall be
 from 0.0% to 12.0% by weight and the gradation requirements for material passing the
 No. 10 sieve (soil mortar) required in Section 1010 for ABC will not apply. For ABC not
 used in asphalt plant mix, the gradation requirements for material passing the
 No. 10 sieve (soil mortar) will be as required in Section 1010.

 The Aggregate QC/QA Program is designed to give aggregate producers more responsibility
 for controlling the quality of material they produce and to use the quality control information
 they provide in the acceptance process by the Department. It requires aggregate producers to
 perform quality control sampling, testing and record keeping on aggregates they ship for use
 by the Department. It requires the Department to perform quality assurance sampling, testing
 and record keeping confirming the performance of the producers’ control plan. The program
 is described in the Aggregate QC/QA Program Manual.

 Sample and test PRAS for asbestos and provide results demonstrating that the bulk
 samples contain less than one percent of asbestos containing material in accordance with
 Federal, State of North Carolina, and Local regulations. Use NC-accredited Asbestos
 Inspectors or Roofing Supervisors to sample the PRAS to meet the above criteria.
 Maintain records on-site indicating shingle source(s), asbestos operation plan approved
 by Division of Public Health’s Health Hazards Control Unit, and all asbestos analytical
 reports. All documentation will be subject to review by the Department.

 RAS shall contain no more than 0.5% by total cumulative weight of deleterious materials.
 These materials include, but are not limited to, excessive dirt, debris, concrete, metals,
 glass, paper, rubber, wood, plastic, soil, brick, tars, or other contaminating substances.
 
 23
 24
 
 Blend RAS with fine aggregate or RAP, meeting the requirements of this Section, if
 needed to keep the processed material workable.
 
 25
 
 MRAS and PRAS shall not be blended together for the production of hot mix asphalt.

 32
 33
 
 New Source RAS is defined as acceptable material which was not included in the
 stockpile when samples were taken for mix design purposes. Process new source
 RAS so that all materials will meet the gradation requirements prior to introduction
 into the plant mixer unit.
 
 34
 35
 36
 37
 
 After a stockpile of processed RAS has been sampled and mix designs made from
 these samples, do not add new source RAS to the original stockpile without prior
 field testing to insure gradation and binder uniformity. Sample and test new source
 RAS before blending with the existing stockpile.
 
 38
 39
 40
 41
 42
 
 Store new source RAS in a separate stockpile until the material can be sampled and
 tested for comparison with the original recycled mix design data. New source RAS
 may also be placed against the existing stockpile in a linear manner provided it is
 sampled for mix design conformity prior to its use in the recycled mix. Store RAS
 materials in such a manner as to prevent contamination.
 
 43
 44
 45
 46
 47
 
 Field approval of new source RAS will be based on the table below and volumetric
 mix properties on the mix with the new source RAS included. Provided these
 tolerances are met, volumetric properties of the new mix will then be performed. If
 all volumetric mix properties meet the mix design criteria for that mix type, the new
 source RAS may continue to be used.

 (F) Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP)
 (1) Mix Design RAP
 Incorporate RAP from stockpiles or other sources tested for uniformity of gradation
 and binder content before use in an asphalt mix design. Use RAP that meets all
 requirements specified for the following classifications.
 (a) Millings
 Existing RAP that is removed from its original location by a milling process as
 specified in Section 607. Millings should be such that it has a uniform gradation
 and binder content and all materials will pass a 2 inch sieve before introduction
 into the plant mixer unit.
 (b) Processed RAP
 RAP that is processed in some manner (possibly by crushing and/or use of
 a blending method) to produce a uniform gradation and binder content in the
 RAP before use in a recycled mix. Process RAP so all materials have a uniform
 gradation and binder content and will pass a 1 inch sieve before introduction
 into the plant mixer unit.
 (c) Fractionated RAP
 Fractionated RAP is defined as having 2 or more RAP stockpiles, where the
 RAP is divided into coarse and fine fractions. Grade RAP so all materials will
 pass a 1 inch sieve. The coarse RAP stockpile shall only contain material
 retained on a 3/8 inch screen, unless otherwise approved. The fine RAP
 stockpile shall only contain material passing the 3/8 inch screen, unless
 otherwise approved. The Engineer may allow the Contractor to use an alternate
 to the 3/8 inch screen to fractionate the RAP. The maximum percentages of
 fractionated RAP may be comprised of coarse, fine, or the combination of both.
 Use a separate cold feed bin for each stockpile of fractionated RAP introduced
 into the mix.
 (d) Approved Stockpiled RAP
 Approved Stockpiled RAP is defined as fractionated RAP which has been
 isolated and tested for asphalt content, gradation and asphalt binder
 characteristics with the intent to be used in mix designs with higher RAP
 contents as specified in Article 610-3. Fractionate the RAP in accordance with
 10-33
 
 Section 1012
 1

 Perform extraction tests at a rate of one per 1,000 tons of RAP, with at least
 five tests per stockpile to determine the asphalt content and gradation. Separate
 stockpiles of RAP material by fine and coarse fractions. Erect and maintain
 a sign satisfactory to the Engineer on each stockpile to identify the material.
 Assure that no deleterious material is allowed to contaminate any stockpile. The
 Engineer may reject by visual inspection any stockpiles that are not kept clean,
 separated and free of foreign materials.
 
 10
 11
 
 Submit requests for RAP stockpile approval to the Engineer with the following
 information at the time of the request:
 
 12
 
 (i) Approximate tons of materials in stockpile,
 
 13
 
 (ii) Name or Identification number for the stockpile,
 
 14
 
 (iii) Asphalt binder content and gradation test results, and
 
 15
 
 (iv) Asphalt characteristics of the stockpile.
 
 16
 17
 18
 
 For the Stockpiled RAP to be considered for approval, the gradation and asphalt
 content shall be uniform. Individual test results, when compared to the target,
 will be accepted if within the tolerances listed in Table 1012-3.

 Unprocessed RAP is asphalt material that was not milled and/or has not been
 processed to obtain a uniform gradation and binder content and is not
 representative of the RAP used during the applicable mix design. Unprocessed
 RAP shall not be incorporated into any JMFs before processing. Different
 sources of unprocessed RAP may be stockpiled together provided it is generally
 free of contamination and will be processed before use in a recycled mix. RAP
 contamination in the form of excessive dirt, debris, clean stone, concrete, etc.
 will not be allowed. Incidental amounts of dirt, concrete and clean stone may be
 acceptable. Unprocessed RAP may be processed and then classified as a new
 source RAP as described above.

 Field approval of new source RAP will be based on Table 1012-4 and
 volumetric mix properties on the mix with the new source RAP included.
 Provided the Table 1012-4 tolerances are met, volumetric properties of the new
 mix will then be performed. If all volumetric mix properties meet the mix
 design criteria for that mix type, the new source RAP may continue to be used.

 14
 
 Use fine aggregate from sources participating in the Department’s Aggregate QC/QA
 Program as described in Section 1006. A list of sources participating in the Department’s
 QC/QA Program in North Carolina and adjoining states is available from the Materials
 and Tests Unit.
 
 15
 16
 17
 18
 
 Use fine aggregate consisting of natural sand or manufactured sand having clean, durable,
 hard, uncoated particles, or other inert materials having similar characteristics. Produce
 manufactured sand from fractured stone material. Use fine aggregate free from dirt,
 wood, paper, burlap and all other foreign material.
 
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 25
 
 To permit excess water to drain and the moisture content to become uniform, stockpile
 the aggregates either at the producer’s plant or at the batch plant site for at least 24 hours
 before use in the concrete. Build open stockpiles of fine aggregate at the batch plant on
 concrete surfaces. Do not add new material to the stockpile during the 24 hour period.
 When the aggregates have a low and uniform moisture content and the consistency of the
 concrete can be satisfactorily controlled without stockpiling the aggregates for 24 hours,
 the minimum stockpiling period may be reduced or waived entirely by the Engineer.
 
 26

 29
 
 The Department’s list of approved sources of fine aggregate shows the target fineness
 modulus of each aggregate as established by the producer. Do not use fine aggregate
 with a fineness modulus that varies more than 0.2 from the target value until the concrete
 mix proportions are adjusted.

 10
 11
 12
 
 Mortar made with the fine aggregate shall have a compressive strength at the age of
 3 and 7 days using Type III Portland cement, or 7 and 28 days using Type I or II Portland
 cement, of not less than 95% of that developed by a comparison mortar. Make the
 comparison mortar with the same cement, graded Ottawa sand with a fineness modulus of
 2.40 ± 0.05, and the same water-cement ratio and consistency as the test mortar. Test the
 mortar strength in accordance with AASHTO T 106.
 
 13

 15
 16
 
 Fine aggregate that fails the mortar strength may be used with the approval of the
 Engineer, provided that when it is tested in concrete cylinders the compressive strength of
 the concrete at 14 days is equal to or greater than the strength of cylinders made with
 an identical mix using an acceptable sand.

 The Performance Graded Asphalt Binder and Asphalt emulsion QC/QA Programs are
 designed to give asphalt binder and asphalt emulsion producers/suppliers (henceforth
 Producer designates Producer/Supplier) more responsibility for controlling the quality of
 material they produce and to use the quality control information they provide in the
 acceptance process by the Department. It requires asphalt binder and asphalt emulsion
 producers to perform quality control sampling, testing and record keeping on materials they
 ship for use by the Department. It documents that the Department will perform quality
 assurance sampling, testing and record keeping confirming the performance of the producers’
 control plan. In addition, the Producer is required to participate in independent assurance
 comparative sample activities. The program is described in the Performance Graded Asphalt
 Binder and Asphalt Emulsion QC/QA Program Manuals. An electronic copy of the program
 manuals may be obtained by accessing the Materials and Tests website.
 
 34

 Provide geosynthetics for subsurface drainage, separation, stabilization, reinforcement,
 erosion control, filtration and other applications in accordance with the contract. Use
 geotextiles, geocomposite drains and geocells that are on the NCDOT APL. Prefabricated
 geocomposite drains include sheet, strip and vertical drains (PVDs), i.e., “wick drains”
 consisting of a geotextile attached to and/or encapsulating a plastic drainage core. Geocells
 are comprised of ultrasonically welded polymer strips that when expanded form a 3D
 honeycomb grid that is typically filled with material to support vegetation. Define
 geotextiles, geogrids, geocomposite drains and geocells as geosynthetics.

 If necessary or required, hold geotextiles, geogrids and sheet drains in place with new wire
 staples, i.e., “sod staples” that meet Subarticle 1060-8(D) or new anchor pins. Use steel
 anchor pins with a diameter of at least 3/16 inch and a length of at least 18 inches and with a
 point at one end and a head at the other end that will retain a steel washer with an outside
 diameter of at least 1.5 inches.

 41
 
 Allow the Engineer to visually verify geosynthetic products before installation. Open
 packaged geosynthetics just before use in the presence of the Engineer to confirm the correct
 product. Geotextile rolls without the product name printed on the geotextile or the product
 label affixed to the geotextile or roll core by the Manufacturer will be rejected. Any other
 geosynthetics that are unwrapped, missing original packaging or previously opened may not
 be used unless approved by the Engineer.

 22
 23
 24
 
 The quality of all seed and all operations in connection with the furnishing of this material
 shall comply with the North Carolina Seed Law and with the rules and regulations, adopted
 by the North Carolina Board of Agriculture and Consumer Services in accordance with said
 law, in effect at the time of sampling, and with the quality requirements of the Standard
 Specifications. All seed will be subject to sampling by the Engineer, or by an authorized
 representative of the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, or
 both; and will be tested by the North Carolina Department of Agriculture. Supplementary
 testing for seed germination may be performed by the Engineer.
 
 25
 26
 27
 
 The quality of all seed will be based on the percentage of pure live seed, which will be
 computed by multiplying the percentage of purity by the percentage of germination and
 dividing the result by 100.
 
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 34
 35
 
 Seed shall have been approved by the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and
 Consumer Services before being sown. No seed will be accepted with a date of test more than
 eight months before the date of sowing, excluding the month in which the test was completed.
 Such testing, however, will not relieve the Contractor from responsibility for furnishing and
 sowing seed that meets these Standard Specifications at the time of sowing. The Engineer
 may retest seed for germination after 5 months of storage; at the beginning of each normal
 seeding season for the particular kind of seed involved or at any time that the condition of the
 seed appears to have deteriorated.
 
 36
 37
 38
 39
 40
 41
 
 When a low percentage of germination causes the quality of the seed to fall below the
 minimum pure live seed specified, the Contractor may elect, subject to the approval of the
 Engineer, to increase the rate of application sufficiently to obtain the minimum pure live seed
 content specified, provided that such an increase in the rate of application does not cause the
 quantity of noxious weed seed per acre or square yard, as the case may be, to exceed the
 quantity that would be allowable at the regular rate of application.
 
 42
 43
 44
 
 Furnish and deliver each of the species or varieties of seed in separate bags. If seed is to be
 mixed before sowing, perform such mixing in a commercial seed mixing machine, or by
 an equally thorough means, after sampling and testing have been completed.
 
 45
 46
 
 During handling and storing, care for the seed in such a manner that it will be protected from
 damage by heat, moisture, rodents or other causes.

 1072-9 HANDLING AND STORING MATERIALS
 
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 
 Load, transport, unload and store structural material so the metal is kept clean and free from
 damage. Repair any coating damage per Section 442. Do not use chains, cables or hooks
 without softeners that could result in damage or scarring of the material. Repair all materials
 which are scarred or damaged and inspect at the fabricators expense as deemed necessary by
 the Engineer.
 
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 
 Use lifting equipment and rigging equipment with adequate capacity to handle the material at
 all times. Do not bend, twist, damage or excessively stress any materials. Do not perform
 hammering which injures or distorts the members. In the event that damage or overstressing
 does occur, prepare and submit an inspection and testing verification plan to the Engineer for
 approval. Operate and maintain all lifting equipment in a safe manner and in accordance with
 the manufacturer’s directions.
 
 34
 35
 36
 
 When lifting main structural steel members, use spreader bars. Do not use one point pick-ups
 on members over 50 feet in length. Use two point pick-ups so the amount of overhang and
 the distance between hooks does not exceed the distances as noted in Table 1072-5.

 care in turn-over operations to prevent excessive bending stresses in the edge of flanges.
 Support long members on blocking placed near enough together to prevent damage from
 deflection.
 
 4
 5
 6
 
 Do not use any beam, girder, diaphragm, cross frame or other material, in any stage of
 fabrication that will be permanently incorporated into the finished structure as a workbench,
 lifting device or dunnage for any purpose for which it was not specifically intended.
 
 7
 
 1072-10 STRAIGHTNESS, CAMBER AND DIMENSIONAL TOLERANCES
 
 8
 
 (A) General
 
 9
 10
 11
 
 Ensure that rolled material, before being laid out or fabricated, is straight.
 If straightening is necessary, use methods that do not damage the metal. Kinks or sharp
 bends are cause for rejection of the material.
 
 12
 13
 
 Ensure that heat straightened parts are substantially free from external forces, except
 those resulting from mechanical means used in conjunction with the application of heat.
 
 14
 15
 16
 17
 18
 
 Heat curving and heat cambering shall be completely free from any external forces. Any
 heating operation to address straightening, cambering, or curving shall be monitored by
 the Fabricator’s QC department. Personnel performing heating operations shall have
 adequate training (documented), shall possess proper temperature indicating devices and
 shall have received instructions for appropriate use.
 
 19
 20
 21
 22
 
 After heating, allow the metal to cool, without artificial cooling, down to 600°F. Below
 600°F, only dry compressed air is permitted to artificially cool steels having minimum
 yield strength greater than 36,000 psi as indicated by a Type 1 (Certified Mill Test
 Report) material certification in accordance with Article 106-3.
 
 23
 
 (B) Straightening
 
 24
 25
 26
 27
 
 Straighten distorted members and bent material by mechanical means or, if approved, by
 the carefully planned and supervised application of a limited amount of localized heat.
 Do not allow the temperature of the heated area to exceed 1,150°F as controlled by
 temperature indicating crayons or other approved methods.
 
 28
 29

 Following the straightening of a bend or buckle, verify the surface is free of evidence of
 fracture as indicated by visual inspection or, if directed, by appropriate nondestructive
 testing.
 
 31
 32
 33
 34
 
 Shop straighten the bottom flanges of steel beams or girders at bearings as necessary to
 provide uniform contact between the flanges and the bearings. If bearings are to be field
 installed, the Fabricator shall demonstrate appropriate bearing contact surfaces as defined
 by the AWS Bridge Welding Code prior to shipping.

 Make adequate provision in the fabrication of structural members to compensate for
 change of camber due to welding of the shear connectors and other fabrication work.
 
 39
 40
 41
 42
 43
 
 Fabricate camber into the members on built-up plate girders and trusses. Where camber
 is required on rolled sections, induce it by heat cambering, except that for rolled sections
 within the depth, length and camber ordinate range shown in Table 1072-6, induce
 camber by cold cambering or "gagging" at the mill or in the shop provided approval
 procedures for cold cambering are employed.
 
 44
 
 Where reverse curvature is required in a single rolled shape, induce it by heat cambering.
 
 45
 46
 47
 
 Show camber diagrams showing the required offset at each tenth point of the span and at
 any web splice or field splice location and blocking diagrams on the shop drawings.
 Show additional points if desired by the fabricator. Ensure that the beams, girders or
 10-102
 
 Section 1072

 other members with field splices meet all of the blocking ordinates without inducing
 stress into the members.

 (D) Heat Cambering of Rolled Beams and Welded Plate Girders
 (1) General
 
 9
 10
 11
 
 Where heat cambering is used, only V-type heating is permitted. Perform V-type
 heating by the carefully planned and supervised application of a limited amount of
 localized heat.
 
 12
 13
 14
 
 When minor corrections in camber are required, use small localized heats limited to
 the flange material. Perform major corrections in camber by V-type heating to
 prevent web distortion.
 
 15
 16
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 
 Begin heating at the apex of the heating pattern and progress slowly towards the base
 of the pattern as each area is brought up to temperature as stated in
 Subarticle 1072-10(D)(5). Do not progress the heating torches toward the base of
 the heating pattern until the apex of the pattern is brought up to the specified
 temperature. Do not return the heating torch toward the apex of the heating triangle
 after heating has progressed towards the base. Continue heating to successive areas
 until the base of the triangular heating pattern is brought up to the required
 temperature across the full width of the flange.
 
 23
 
 (2) Heat Cambering of Rolled Beams
 
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 
 Heat cambering of rolled beams is allowed to provide the required vertical curvature.
 Space triangular heating patterns throughout the length of the member to provide the
 required curvature. Locate the apex of the heating triangle at a point not less
 than 75% of the depth of the member measured from the flange that is concave after
 cambering. Limit the total included angle of the heating pattern to 20°.
 
 29
 30
 31
 
 Weld all detail material such as connection plates, bearing stiffeners and gusset
 plates attached to the member to the rolled beam after the beam is cambered as
 required.
 
 32
 
 (3) Heat Cambering of Welded Plate Girders
 
 33
 34
 
 Heat cambering of welded plate girders is only permitted when approved in writing
 as a necessary repair procedure for plate girders rejected for camber deviation.
 
 35
 36
 37
 
 When it is necessary to correct camber deviation in welded plate girders, heating is
 permitted in V-type heating patterns centered on intermediate stiffeners and
 connection plates. Where necessary, add stiffeners for this purpose if approved.
 10-103
 
 Section 1072
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
 
 Locate the apex of the heating pattern not less than 3/4 of the depth of the member
 from the flange that is shortened after cooling. The maximum included angle of the
 heating pattern is 10°. The maximum width of the base of the heating pattern is 10
 inches. Where shallow members or thin webs prescribe heating patterns with a
 width substantially less than 10 inches at the junction of the web to flange, extend
 the heating pattern in the flange at that location beyond the limits of the heating
 pattern in the web by no more than 1 inch provided the total width of pattern in the
 flange does not exceed the 10 inch limit stated above.
 (4) Support of Members for Heat Cambering
 
 10
 11
 12
 
 Heat camber members with the web vertical and supports spaced to take the
 maximum advantage of dead load in the member before applying heat. Ensure all
 supports are approved by the Department’s inspector before beginning work.
 
 13
 14
 15
 
 Do not place any combination of support system or external load on the member that
 causes a compressive stress in the flange to exceed 20,000 psi before heating for
 AASHTO M 270 Grades 36, 50 and 50W steels.
 
 16
 
 (5) Heating Process and Equipment
 
 17
 18
 19
 
 Confine heating to the patterns described herein and conduct to bring the steel within
 the planned pattern to a temperature between 1,100°F and 1,150°F as rapidly as
 possible without overheating the steel.
 
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 
 Any heating procedure which causes a portion of the steel to exceed a temperature
 greater than 1,150°F is destructive heating and is automatically cause for rejection of
 the steel. Steel rejected for destructive heating is investigated for re-acceptance,
 repair or replacement if allowed by the Engineer. Bear the cost of such tests and any
 necessary repair or replacement.
 
 25
 
 (6) Heat Measurement
 
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 34
 
 Specified temperatures are checked using portable digital pyrometers or temperature
 indicating crayon. When using a temperature indicating crayon, the following
 procedure shall be employed; mark on the surface of metal or sheet with the required
 crayon. Once the surface reaches the rated temperature of the crayon, the mark will
 melt and show liquid smear appearance. At this point, the heating operation shall
 cease to prevent overheating. Exceeding the specified temperature is strictly
 prohibited.
 (E) Heat Curving Girders
 (1) Type of Heating
 
 35
 36
 37
 38
 39
 40
 41
 42
 
 With approval, use continuous or V-type heating methods to curve girders. For the
 continuous method, simultaneously heat a strip along the edge of the top and bottom
 flanges that is of sufficient width and temperature to obtain the required curvature.
 For V-type heating, heat the top and bottom flanges simultaneously in truncated
 triangular or wedge-shaped areas. Position the areas with their base along the flange
 edge and spaced at regular intervals along each flange. Set the spacing and
 temperatures to approximate the required curvature by a series of short chords. Heat
 along the top and bottom flanges at approximately the same rate.
 
 43
 44
 45
 46
 47
 48
 49
 
 For V-type heating, terminate the apex of the truncated triangular area applied to the
 inside flange surface just before the juncture of the web and flange. To avoid web
 distortion, make certain that heat is not applied directly to the web when heating the
 inside flange surfaces (the surfaces that intersect the web). Extend the apex of the
 truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface to the
 juncture of the flange and web. Use an included angle of approximately 15° to 30°
 in the truncated triangular pattern, but do not allow the base of the triangle to
 10-104
 
 Section 1072
 1
 2
 
 exceed 10 inches. Vary the patterns prescribed above only with the Engineer’s
 approval.
 
 3
 4
 5
 6
 
 For both types of heating, heat the flange edges that will be on the inside of the
 horizontal curve after cooling. Concurrently heat both inside and outside flange
 surfaces for flange thicknesses of 1.25 inches and greater. Adhere to the temperature
 requirements presented below.
 
 7
 8
 9
 10
 11
 12
 
 (2) Temperature
 Conduct the heat curving operation so the temperature of the steel never exceeds
 1,150°F as measured by temperature indicating crayons or other suitable means. Do
 not artificially cool the girder until it naturally cools to 600°F. Below 600°F, use dry
 compressed air to artificially cool the girder.
 (3) Position for Heating
 
 13
 14
 15
 16
 
 Heat-curving the girder with the web in either a vertical or horizontal position is
 permitted. When curved in the vertical position, brace or support the girder so the
 tendency of the girder to deflect laterally during the heat-curving process does not
 cause the girder to overturn.
 
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 
 When curved in the horizontal position, support the girder near its ends and at
 intermediate points, if required, to obtain a uniform curvature. Do not allow the
 bending stress in the flanges to exceed 27,000 psi. To prevent a sudden sag due to
 plastic flange buckling when the girder is positioned horizontally for heating, place
 intermediate safety catch blocks at the midlength of the girder within 2 inches of the
 flanges at all times during the heating process.
 
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
 31
 
 (4) Sequence of Operations
 Conduct the heat-curving operation either before or after completing all the required
 welding of transverse intermediate stiffeners to the web. However, unless provisions
 are made for shrinkage, position and attach connection plates and bearing stiffeners
 after heat-curving. In any event, weld the stiffeners, connection plates, and bearing
 stiffeners to the girder flanges after the member is curved. If longitudinal stiffeners
 are required, heat-curve or oxygen-cut these stiffeners separately before welding to
 the curved girder.
 (5) Camber and Curvature
 
 32
 33
 34
 35
 
 Camber the girders before heat-curving. Cut the web to the prescribed camber
 allowing for shrinkage due to cutting welding and heat-curving. If approved,
 a carefully supervised application of heat is permitted to correct moderate deviations
 from the specified camber.
 
 36
 37
 38
 39
 40
 41
 42
 
 Horizontal curvature and vertical camber is measured for final acceptance after all
 welding and heating operations are complete and the flanges have cooled to
 a uniform temperature. Horizontal curvature is checked with the web in the vertical
 position by measuring offsets from a string line or wire attached to both flanges or by
 using other suitable means. Camber is checked with the web in the horizontal
 position. Camber the girder so it meets the horizontal and vertical curvature
 ordinates without inducing stress into the girders by mechanical force.
 
 43
 44
 45
 
 Compensate for loss of camber in the heat-curved girders as residual stresses
 dissipate during service life of the structure. Compute this anticipated loss of camber
 in accordance with the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications.
 
 10-105
 
 Section 1072

 (6) Procedure Specification and Shop Drawings
 
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 
 Submit structural steel shop drawings, including a detailed written procedure
 specification for heat curving the girders, supplemented by calculations and sketches,
 for review, comments and acceptance. On the shop drawings, indicate the type,
 location and spacing of heat sectors, if used, supports and catch blocking for each
 field section of girders. Include suitable blocking diagrams for measuring horizontal
 curvature similar to those usually prepared for camber and vertical curvature.
 (F) Camber Measurement
 
 9
 10
 11
 
 At the time of acceptance at the shop and after erection, ensure that all stringers and
 girders for bridges meet the required camber values within the tolerances specified in
 Subarticle 1072-10(G). Follow the procedure for measuring camber as outlined below:
 
 12
 13
 
 (1) Assemble the member at the shop as specified in Article 1072-19 and measure with
 the member lying on its side.
 
 14
 15
 16
 
 (2) Camber repairs are only allowed when approved by the Engineer. Camber deviation
 is judged irreparable if corrective measures in the shop produce web buckling in
 excess of the specified tolerance, in which case the member is rejected.
 
 17
 18
 19
 20
 
 (3) The final camber measurement is made by the Engineer in the field after erection.
 At the time of this measurement, ensure that the members have all of the specified
 camber less the dead load deflection of the steel as specified in
 Subarticle 1072-10(G).
 
 21
 
 (G) Dimensional Tolerances
 
 22
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 
 Ensure that dimensions of all material covered by Section 1072 conform to ASTM A6
 when received at the fabrication shop. Fabricate member dimensions conforming to this
 subarticle whether designated to be straight, cambered or curved and regardless of
 whether curvature is heat-induced (when so permitted). Dimensional tolerances not listed
 in this subarticle shall be as specified by the Bridge Welding Code as defined in
 Article 1072-18 and applied to rolled shapes where applicable as well as to welded
 members.
 
 29
 30
 31
 32
 
 Place welded butt joints no further than 1/2 inch from the point detailed. Intermediate
 stiffeners varying ± 1/2 inch from the point detailed are allowed. Connector plates for
 field connections varying ± 1/8 inch from the point detailed are allowed. Ensure that the
 actual centerline of bearing lies within the thickness of the bearing stiffener.
 
 33
 34
 35
 
 Members with end milled for bearing and members with faced end connection angles
 deviating from the detailed length by -0, +1/32 inch are acceptable. All other members
 varying from detailed length by ± 1/8 inch are acceptable.
 
 36
 37
 38
 
 Align to within ± 1/8 inch from the location shown on the approved shop drawings all
 steel requiring shop assembly for reaming, drilling from the solid or weld joint
 preparation.
 
 39
 40
 
 Deviation from specified camber of fabricated members as verified during shop assembly
 and before shipment from the fabrication shop is limited to:
 
 41
 
 -0;
 
 42
 43
 
 +3/32" x No. of ft from nearest bearing, up to 3/4" maximum.

 Deviation from specified camber of erected steel bridge superstructures measured when
 the steel work is complete and the superstructure is subject to steel dead load stresses only
 is limited to:

 -0;
 
 5
 6
 
 +1/8" x No. of ft from nearest bearing, up to 1" maximum.
 10
 
 7
 8
 
 If the plans do not require shop induced camber, provide an actual member that is straight
 or one of the following:
 
 9
 10
 11
 
 (1) If natural camber "turned up" is required, the maximum plus camber is the algebraic
 sum of the allowable deviation, dead load deflection, vertical curve ordinate and
 superelevation ordinate;
 
 12
 13
 14
 
 (2) If natural camber ‘turned down" is required, the maximum negative camber is equal
 to the algebraic sum of the dead load deflection, vertical curve ordinate and
 superelevation ordinate.
 
 15
 16
 
 Do not exceed 1/8 inch per 10 foot length for the actual deviation from curvature shown
 in the plans.
 
 17
 
 1072-11 OXYGEN CUTTING
 
 18
 19
 20
 
 Oxygen cutting of structural steel is allowed, provided a smooth surface free from cracks and
 notches is secured and an accurate profile is secured by the use of a mechanical guide. Hand
 cut only where approved and grind smooth leaving no burnt edges.
 
 21
 22
 23
 24
 25
 26
 
 In all oxygen cutting, adjust and manipulate the cutting agent to avoid cutting beyond (inside)
 the prescribed lines. Provide oxygen cut surfaces meeting the ANSI surface roughness rating
 value of 1,000 except ensure that oxygen cut surfaces of members not subject to calculated
 stress meet the surface roughness value of 2,000 (AWS C4.1-G Surface Roughness Gauge).
 Round corners of oxygen cut surfaces of members carrying calculated stress to a 1/16 inch
 radius, or an equivalent flat surface at a suitable angle, by grinding after oxygen cutting.
 
 27
 
 Fillet re-entrant cuts to a radius of not less than 1 inch.
 
 28
 29
 30
 31
 
 Remove surface roughness exceeding the above values and occasional notches and gouges not
 more than 3/16 inch deep on otherwise satisfactory oxygen cut surfaces by chipping or
 grinding. Such removal shall be faired to the material edge with a slope not steeper than one
 in ten and with machine and grinding marks parallel to the surfaces.
 
 32
 33
 34
 35
 
 Repair occasional gouges of oxygen cut edges more than 3/16 inch deep, but not more than
 7/16 inch deep, by welding with low hydrogen electrodes not exceeding 5/32 inch in diameter
 and with a minimum preheat of 250°F. Grind the completed weld smooth and flush with the
 adjacent surface. Radiographically test any gouge repaired by welding.

 Plane sheared edges of plates more than 5/8 inch in thickness that carry calculated stress to
 a depth of 1/4 inch. Pre-drill re-entrant cuts before cutting. Round all edges of plates and
 shapes parallel to calculated stress and all free edges of plates and shapes intended for coating
 or galvanizing to 1/16 inch radius or provide an equivalent flat surface at a suitable angle.
 Flame cut edges found to have a Rockwell Hardness Value of C 30 or greater will be
 considered unacceptable. A portable Rockwell Hardness Tester shall be employed by the
 Quality Control Inspector to determine conformance with these requirements. Unacceptably
 hard surfaces shall be removed by grinding, machining, or approved heat treating procedures.
 Grind edges of all other plates and shapes to remove burrs, slag or shear lip. The ends of all
 steel piles, intended for coating or galvanizing, are not required to be radiused, but remove all
 burrs, slag and shear lip.

 If a shorter radius is essential, bend the plates hot at a temperature not greater than
 1,200°F and air cool slowly down to a temperature of 600°F. Below 600°F, use only dry
 compressed air to artificially cool steels having a minimum yield strength greater than
 36,000 psi. Use hot bent plates conforming to Subarticle 1072-15(A) above.

 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 
 Punch or drill all holes and remove any burrs. Punching material forming parts of
 a member composed of not more than 5 thickness of metal 1/16 inch larger than the
 nominal diameter of the fastener is allowed whenever the thickness of the material is not
 greater than 3/4 inch for structural steel, 5/8 inch for high-strength steel or 1/2 inch for
 quenched and tempered alloy steel, unless subpunching and reaming is required by
 Subarticle 1072-16(D).
 10-108
 
 Section 1072

 When there are more than five thicknesses or when any of the main material is thicker
 than 3/4 inch for structural steel, 5/8 inch for high-strength steel or 1/2 inch for quenched
 and tempered alloy steel, either subdrill and ream or drill all holes full size.
 
 4
 5
 6
 
 When required by Subarticle 1072-16(D), subpunch or subdrill all holes (subdrill if
 thickness limitation governs) 1/4 inch smaller and, after assembling, ream 1/16 inch
 larger or drill full size to 1/16 inch larger than the nominal diameter of the fastener.

 (B) Punched Holes
 Do not use a diameter of the die exceeding the diameter of the punch by more than
 1/16 inch. If any holes require enlargement to admit the fasteners, ream such holes.
 Clean cut holes without torn or ragged edges. Poor matching of holes is cause for
 rejection. Grind all burrs smooth.
 (C) Reamed or Drilled Holes
 Make reamed or drilled holes cylindrical and perpendicular to the member complying
 with the size requirements of Subarticle 1072-16(A). Where practicable, direct reamers
 by mechanical means. Grind all burrs smooth. Poor matching of holes is cause for
 rejection. Ream and drill with twist drills. If required, take assembled parts apart for
 removal of burrs caused by drilling. Assemble connecting parts requiring reamed or
 drilled holes, securely hold while reaming or drilling and match mark before
 disassembling.
 (D) Subpunching and Reaming of Field Connections
 Subpunch or subdrill, if required according to Subarticle 1072-16(A), holes in all field
 connections and field splices of main members of trusses, arches, continuous beam spans,
 bents, towers (each face), plate girders, and rigid frames. Subsequently ream while
 assembled as required by Article 1072-19. Subpunch and ream to a steel template or
 ream while assembled all holes for floor beam and stringer field end connections. Ream
 or drill full size field connection holes through a steel template after the template is
 located with utmost care as to position and angle and firmly bolted in place. Use
 templates for reaming matching members, or the opposite faces of a single member that
 are exact duplicates. Accurately locate templates used for connections on like parts of
 members such that the parts or members are duplicates and require no match-marking.
 (E) Accuracy of Punched and Subdrilled Holes
 Accurately punch or subdrill all holes punched full size, subpunched or subdrilled such
 that after assembling, and before any reaming is done, a cylindrical pin 1/8 inch smaller
 in diameter than the nominal size of the hole enters perpendicular to the face of the
 member, without drifting, in at least 75% of the contiguous holes in the same plane. If
 the requirement is not fulfilled, the badly punched pieces are rejected. If any hole does
 not pass a pin 3/16 inch smaller in diameter than the nominal size of the hole, this is
 cause for rejection.
 (F) Accuracy of Reamed and Drilled Holes
 
 40
 41
 42
 
 When holes are reamed or drilled, ensure that 85% of the holes in any contiguous group,
 after reaming or drilling, show no offset greater than 1/32 inch between adjacent
 thicknesses of metal.
 
 43
 44
 45
 
 Use all steel templates with hardened steel bushings in holes accurately dimensioned
 from the centerlines of the connection as inscribed on the template. Use the centerlines in
 locating accurately by the template from the milled or scribed ends of the members.
 
 46
 47
 48
 
 (G) Alternate Methods
 As an option, make the fastener holes by procedures other than those described in
 Subarticles 1072-16(A) through 1072-16(F) provided that the requirements for quality
 10-109
 
 Section 1072
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5

 10
 
 and for dimensional accuracy are met. Plasma cutting of holes for high strength fasteners
 is prohibited. Wherever an alternate method is employed, demonstrate the ability of each
 alternate method to produce holes and connections consistently meeting all requirements
 for quality and dimensional accuracy for the type of joint fabricated. When such ability
 of an alternate method is previously demonstrated on similar work for the Department,
 continue its use by certifying, on each subsequent project, that the procedure and
 equipment are the same as the method previously qualified, and that the equipment
 involved is in good repair and adjustment. Failure of joints to meet the quality and
 accuracy requirements is cause for rejection. In the case of repeated failures revise
 and/or requalify the method or discontinue its use.
 
 11
 12
 13
 14
 15
 16
 
 At the time of qualification of an alternate method, submit for approval a written
 procedure specification describing the procedures and equipment and giving upper and
 lower value limits and tolerances for all pertinent variables. Accurately reflect the actual
 procedures, equipment and values used in the qualification tests. In addition to the
 certification on each subsequent project, the Engineer may request copies of the approved

 20
 21
 22
 
 Where shown in the plans or permitted in writing, use oversize, short-slotted and longslotted holes with high strength bolts 5/8 inch and larger in diameter. Do not allow the
 distance between edges of adjacent holes or edges of holes and edges of members to be
 less than permitted under the AASHTO specification. Oversize, short-slotted and longslotted holes are defined as follows:
 
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 
 (1) Oversize holes are 3/16 inch larger than bolts 7/8 inch and less in diameter, 1/4 inch
 larger than bolts 1 inch in diameter, and 5/16 inch larger than bolts 1 1/8 inches and
 greater in diameter. When oversized holes are permitted, they are allowed in any or
 all plies of friction type connections. Install hardened washers over exposed oversize
 holes.
 
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 34
 
 (2) Short-slotted holes are 1/16 inch wider than the bolt diameter and have a length that
 does not exceed the oversize diameter requirements of Subarticle 1072-16(H)(1) by
 more than 1/16 inch. When short-slotted holes are permitted, they are allowed in any
 or all plies of friction-type or bearing-type connection. Locate holes without regard
 to direction of loading in friction-type connections, but orient normal to the direction
 of the load in bearing-type connections. Install hardened washers over exposed
 short-slotted holes.
 
 35
 36
 37
 38
 39
 40
 41
 
 (3) Long-slotted holes are 1/16 inch wider than the bolt diameter and have a length more
 than allowed in Sub-paragraph 2 but not more than 2 1/2 times the bolt diameter.
 Structural plate washers or a continuous bar not less than 5/16 inch in thickness are
 required to cover long slots that are the outer plies of joints. Ensure that these
 washers have a size sufficient to completely cover the slot after installation. When
 long-slotted holes are permitted, they are allowed in only one of the connected parts
 of either a friction-type or bearing-type connection at an individual faying surface.
 
 42
 43
 44
 
 When used in slip critical connections, locate holes without regard to direction of loading
 if one-third more bolts are provided than needed to satisfy the allowable unit stresses
 except as herein restricted.
 
 45
 46
 47
 
 When used in bearing-type connections, orient the long diameter of the slot normal to the
 direction of loading. No increase in the number of bolts over those necessary for the
 allowable unit stress is required.
 
 48
 49
 50
 
 (I) Misfits
 When misfits occur for any reason, enlargement of the holes by reaming is limited to
 1/16 inch over the nominal size hole called for unless otherwise permitted in writing.

 25
 
 Weld all steel in the shop or in the field for bridges, whether permanent or temporary, and
 perform all other work related to welding including, but not limited to, testing and
 inspection of welds, preparation of material, oxygen cutting, electrodes, shielding and
 shear studs, meeting the Bridge Welding Code. Weld other steel items not covered under
 the Bridge Welding Code in accordance with the applicable AWS Welding Code. Some
 examples may include but not limited to; Structural Welding Code-Steel (AWS D1.1),
 Structural Welding Code- Aluminum (AWS D1.2), Structural Welding Code-Sheet Steel
 (AWS D1.3), Structural Welding Code- Reinforcing Steel (AWS D1.4) and Structural
 Welding Code-Stainless Steel (AWS D1.6).
 
 26
 27
 28
 
 Weld only where shown in the plans or where called for in the Standard Specifications
 unless requesting and receiving written approval from the Department for additional
 welding.
 
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 34
 
 Show all permanent and all temporary welds on the shop drawings. For groove welds,
 indicate on the shop drawings the particular detail and process to be employed in
 production of the work. For prequalified joints, use of the Bridge Welding Code letter
 classification designation of the joint (B-L2b-S etc.) along with the appropriate symbol
 satisfies this requirement. Tack welds that become part of a permanent weld are not
 required on the shop drawings.
 
 35
 36
 37
 38
 39
 40
 41
 
 Provide fillet welds, including seal welds, at least the minimum size allowed by the
 Bridge Welding Code for the thickness of material welded or the size called for in the
 plans, whichever is larger. For exposed, bare, unpainted applications of steel, the basic
 requirements for weld filler metal with atmospheric corrosion resistance and coloring
 characteristics similar to that of the base metal are mandatory. The variations from these
 basic requirements listed in the Bridge Welding Code for single pass welds are not
 permitted.
 
 42
 43
 44
 45
 
 All welds designated as Fracture Critical (FC) and subject to tension shall be so
 designated on the shop drawings. Unless otherwise directed by the Engineer, any flange
 to web (FC) complete joint penetration (CJP) groove weld subjected to calculated tensile
 stress normal to the weld axis, shall be so designated on the design and shop drawings.

 Permanent in-shop welders employed by a fabricator who passed the appropriate welding
 tests and whose weldments are radiographically tested with regularly acceptable results
 are exempt from additional testing when approved by the Engineer. Welder qualification
 testing shall be administered and witnessed by a current AWS Certified Welding
 Inspector (CWI). Ensure all welder qualification testing is witnessed by an independent
 testing agency approved by the Department. As evidence of such qualification, furnish a
 satisfactory certificate, or a copy thereof, issued by a fabricator or Department approved
 testing agency as applicable. Submit certification for each welder, welding operator or
 tacker, and for each project, stating the name and identification number of the welder,
 welding operator or tacker; the name and title of the person who conducted the
 examination; the kind of specimens; the position of welds; the AWS electrode
 classification used; the results of the tests; the date of the examination and witness
 thereof. Such certifications are required for all persons performing shop or field welds of
 any kind on the work, whether permanent or temporary. Ensure each welder provides a
 picture ID upon request or other form of positive identification as required by the
 Engineer.
 
 23
 
 (D) Qualification of Welds and Procedures
 
 24
 25
 26
 27
 
 For shop employed welded construction, submit to the Department all welding
 procedures, prequalified or qualified by test 30 days in advance before performing any
 welding. All welding shall comply with the applicable AWS designed code of
 construction.
 
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 34
 35
 
 For field weld applications, submit prequalified Welding Procedure Specifications (WPS)
 for each joint configuration for approval at least 30 days before performing any welding.
 In lieu of the aforementioned,, use the WPS provided and preapproved by the
 Department. Field welding operations are limited to using SMAW welding process.
 These preapproved WPS are available from the Materials and Tests Unit. Use nonprequalified welding procedures that have been submitted and approved by the Engineer.
 At no cost to the Department, demonstrate their adequacy in accordance with the
 applicable AWS Welding Code.
 
 36
 37
 38
 
 On all welding, include in the welding procedure continuous visual inspection by
 welders, welding operator, tackers, welding supervisors and all personnel involved in
 preparation of the material for welding.
 
 39
 40
 41
 
 Approval by the Engineer of the procedure specifications does not relieve the Contractor
 of his responsibility to develop a welding procedure that produces weldments meeting the
 required quality and dimensions.
 
 42
 43
 44
 45
 46
 47
 
 If non-prequalified joints procedures are previously found acceptable to the Engineer on
 another project, furnish the inspector with a copy of the joint details and procedure
 specification approved at the time of qualification. Such documentation is required from
 each fabricator employing a non-prequalified joint or procedure on the work. Failure to
 produce such documentation results in the fabricator being required to requalify the joint
 or procedure or to use prequalified joints, procedures, and procedure specifications.
 
 48
 49
 50
 51
 
 On weldments where geometric shape prevents compliance with requirements to weld
 a particular position, alternate procedures are considered for approval. Previously
 qualified alternate procedures are considered for approval without further procedure
 qualification tests. No separate payment is made for developing, demonstrating and
 10-112
 
 Section 1072
 1
 2
 3
 
 documenting for future use such alternate procedures, as such work is incidental to the
 work of welding.
 (E) Requirements for Testing and Inspection
 
 4
 5
 
 Require the fabricator to make provisions for convenient access to the work for
 inspection and cooperate with the inspector during the required inspection and testing.

 Visual welding inspection shall be performed by an inspector qualified in accordance
 with AWS QC-1. Inspect welds in the presence of the Department’s inspector unless
 otherwise approved by the Department’s inspector, using visual inspection and the
 nondestructive tests herein prescribed in addition to the test requirements of the Bridge
 Welding Code and the contract. Employ quality control inspectors and NDT technicians
 qualified in accordance with the Bridge Welding Code and preapproved by the Engineer
 before the start of any fabrication. Supply the appropriate certifications as required by
 the Bridge Welding Code to the Department’s inspector for all inspectors. Individuals
 assigned to production welding activities or processes and their supervisors are not
 acceptable for performing quality control testing. Ensure a qualified quality control
 welding inspector (CWI) is present any time welding is in progress. No separate
 payment is made for inspection and testing.
 
 18
 19
 20
 
 Retest welds requiring repairs or replacement in the presence of the Department’s
 inspector after the repairs or replacements are made. Approval of the Engineer is
 required for any repair exceeding three attempts to correct.
 
 21
 22
 
 If the Engineer finds that acceptable repair to defective work is not feasible; the entire
 piece is rejected.
 
 23
 24
 25
 
 Payment at the contract prices for the various items in the contract which include the
 work of welding is full compensation for all costs resulting from the required
 nondestructive testing of welds and from the required inspection of welds.
 
 26
 
 (F) Nondestructive Test Required
 
 27
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 
 Personnel performing Nondestructive Testing (NDT) other than visual examination shall
 be certified in conformance with the latest edition of the American Society for
 Nondestructive Testing’s (ASNT) recommended practice number (SNT-TC-1A). The
 Employer’s program shall meet all established guidelines of SNT-TC-1A for the
 qualification of NDT personnel. In addition, all personnel performing NDT for final weld
 acceptance shall be subject to the Department’s practical proficiency test.

 The extent of nondestructive testing required for main members is as prescribed in the
 Bridge Welding Code and by the contract except that all flange splices shall be
 radiographed for their full length. The term "main members" in this regard means
 girders, diaphragms for curved girders, beams, floor beams, stringers, truss members,
 high strength bolts, columns, bearing stiffeners, bearing shoes, high mount lighting
 standards and components of main member carrying stress, including the end connections
 for such members. Nondestructive testing of other complete welds or weld passes is
 required when so noted in the plans or deemed necessary by the Engineer. For bridge
 applications involving tubular structures that may be subject to the AWS D1.1 welding
 code, the extent of NDT shall be as specified above for main members. Tests other than
 those prescribed are also required when deemed necessary by the Engineer. Perform all
 radiographic testing in accordance with procedures established by the Engineer. Copies
 of these procedures are available from the State Materials Engineer.
 
 46
 47
 48
 49
 
 High mount lighting standards shall be examined in accordance with Section 1401-2.
 Other nondestructive test methods are sometimes deemed necessary by the Engineer to
 determine the quality of the welds. No separate payment is made for inspection and
 testing.
 
 50
 
 Any NDT not identified above shall be examined as directed by the Engineer.

 Produce butt welds of flanges and webs, and fillet welds of web to flanges of plate
 girders and haunched beams using the submerged arc process. Produce other structural
 shapes built up from plates and bars using the submerged arc process unless another
 process is qualified for these joints in accordance with the Bridge Welding Code and is
 subject to the approval of the Engineer.
 
 9
 10
 11
 12
 13
 14
 
 After all shop welded splices in the flanges and webs for the full length of the field
 section are made, tested and approved, fit the flange plates tight and square against the
 web to leave no gap and to not bow the web. Brace one side of each flange against the
 web with gussets or struts and tack weld securely to the web at the stiffener locations.
 Upon removal of the welds, grind any nicks or gouges, preheat, weld and test or
 incorporate into the stiffener fillet weld.
 
 15
 16
 
 Connect the flanges to the web by starting the fillet weld at one end of the girder and
 proceeding to the other ends.
 
 17
 
 As an option, make adjacent welds simultaneously.
 
 18
 19
 20
 
 The sequence for making the flange to web fillet welds is subject only to the provisions
 for control of shrinkage and distortion and to the position requirements of the Bridge
 Welding Code.
 
 21
 22
 23
 
 After flange to web welds are complete, shift bracing gussets or struts if necessary, then
 remove all temporary gussets or struts. Remove tack welds by grinding flush with parent
 metal.
 
 24
 25
 
 Straighten any transverse warpage of the flanges if necessary by heating along the
 centerline of the outside face.
 
 26
 27
 28
 29
 
 Fit tight, square and tack weld stiffeners securely to the web. With the girder in the flat
 position (web horizontal), weld the stiffeners to the web. Do not weld or tack weld
 stiffeners to the flanges except where noted in the plans. Stiffeners are not to be used to
 correct tilt of flange due to distortion associated to welding.
 
 30
 31
 
 After all parts are welded into place, trim the girder to detail length with adjustments for
 slope and end rotation exceeding 1/4 inch nett.

 Precast units are subjected to one of the methods of curing described below or to other
 methods or combinations of methods approved by the Engineer. Cure the precast units
 for a sufficient length of time so the concrete develops the specified compressive strength
 at 28 days or less. Do not strip forms until at least 24 hours after the concrete attains
 initial set. For this purpose, initial set is defined as at least 500 psi resistance to
 a standard penetrometer. The option to strip forms earlier is available provided concrete
 cylinders indicate a strength of at least 75% of the 28 day compressive strength is
 attained before release for each day’s production. Do not deface or injure the units.
 (B) Curing at Elevated Temperatures
 Cure at elevated temperatures in accordance with Subarticle 1078-10(B).
 (C) Water Curing
 Water curing of precast units is allowed as described in Subarticle 420-15(B), by
 covering with water saturated material, or by a system of perforated pipes, mechanical
 sprinklers, porous hoses or by any other method that keeps the units moist during the
 specified curing period. Do not use methods that deface or injure the precast units.
 (D) Curing Compound
 Application of a curing compound is allowed provided it is left intact until the specified
 compressive strength is met. Keep all surfaces moist before the application of the
 compound and damp when the compound is applied. Seal the surface with a single
 uniform coating at the rate of coverage recommended by the curing compound
 manufacturer, or as directed by the Engineer, but not less than 1 gal per 150 sf of area.

 When required, provide an exposed aggregate finish for front faces of panels with a depth of
 exposure ranging from 0 to 1/4 inch. Before beginning production, furnish three 12 inch x 12
 inch sample panels to establish acceptable variations in color, texture and uniformity of the
 finish. After the sample panels are accepted and within 30 days of beginning production,
 produce a reinforced test panel of the largest size that will be used for the project with the
 accepted exposed aggregate finish. Acceptance of the appearance of panels during production
 will be based on the test panel and accepted sample panels.
 
 20

 The Department reserves the right to place a duly authorized inspector in the plant at any or
 all times work related to the production of members for the Department is performed. Notify
 the Engineer at least 7 days in advance when such work is scheduled. Provide an office area
 with an approximate floor space of 100 sf, a desk or drafting table, two chairs, telephone,
 separate dial-up or faster internet access, facilities for proper heating and cooling and
 adequate lighting at the plant for the exclusive use of the inspector. The inspector has the
 authority to reject any or all members not manufactured in accordance with these Standard
 Specifications. Approval of any member by the inspector at the plant is in no way final, and
 further inspection is made at the structure site both before and after the member is placed in
 the final position. Any member found to be defective in any manner at any time is rejected
 and requires replacement by an acceptable member or repair in a manner approved by the
 Engineer.

 Before allowing placement of the first load in a bed, determine the air content by
 a calibrated Chace indicator. During the placement of the first load, determine the
 air content by AASHTO T 152, T 196 or T 121. Determine the air content in each
 subsequent 10 cubic yards by the Chace indicator before allowing placement.
 Determine the air content by AASHTO T 152, T 196 or T 121 from all loads from
 which cylinders are made. If the air content as determined by the Chace indicator,
 fails to meet the specification requirements, a second test is run on material from the
 same load and the results of the 2 tests averaged. If the average does not meet the
 Standard Specifications, a test on the same load is conducted using AASHTO T 152,
 T 196 or T 121. Acceptance or rejection of the load is based on the results of this
 test.

 Department, cylinders made from a sample of concrete placed near the live end of
 the bed and additional cylinders made from a sample of concrete placed near the
 dead end of the bed. Make cylinders in accordance with AASHTO T 23, except cure
 the cylinders in the same manner as the members represented until the strands are
 released. Place cylinders in clusters at random points along the casting bed. After
 the strands are released, air cure the cylinders in an approved common area near the
 testing apparatus for the remainder of the 28 day curing period. Test the cylinders in
 accordance with AASHTO T 22. Provide approved apparatus for testing the transfer
 strength of the cylinders. Maintain this apparatus to within 1.0% accuracy and
 calibrate at intervals not to exceed 12 months by an approved testing company at no
 cost to the Department. The Engineer reserves the right to require verification
 immediately after a testing machine is relocated and whenever there is reason to
 doubt the accuracy of the indicated load, regardless of the time interval since the last
 verification.

 Test four cylinders, two sets of two cylinders from each end of the bed, for the
 purpose of determining whether the concrete has reached the required strength
 for transfer of load. The strengths from the dead end cylinders are averaged and
 the strengths from the live end cylinders are averaged. Ensure that both of these
 averages meet or exceed the required release strength and the lowest cylinder is
 not more than 200 psi below the required strength.
 
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 
 Test a set of three cylinders from each end to determine the 28 day compressive
 strength. The strengths from the dead end cylinders are averaged and the
 strengths from the live end cylinders are averaged. Ensure that both of these
 averages meet or exceed the 28 day compressive strength. Ensure that no
 cylinder indicates a compressive strength less than 400 psi less than the required
 28 day compressive strength. Failure to meet the above requirements is cause
 for rejection of the members represented.

 The Department will perform the complete C-21.0 Field Test Procedure for the Nitrite
 Ion in Plastic Concrete on plastic concrete samples obtained randomly from a truck used
 to pour concrete near each end (live end and dead end) of a prestressed concrete casting.
 Powder samples will be taken from hardened cylinders made at the time C-21.0 is run for
 any concrete that fails the C-21.0 (plastic test) method. The Chemical Testing Laboratory
 will test the powder using method C-20.0 Determination of Nitrite in Hardened Concrete.
 Acceptance of the concrete is dependent in the results of method C-20.0 (hardened test)
 when any sample fails the C-21.0 (plastic test method).

 The Department will perform a qualitative nitrite ion check by method C-22.0 (Field Spot
 Test) on each load of concrete batched for a prestressed concrete casting bed.
 Acceptance of the concrete is dependent on the results of method C-20.0 (hardened test)
 when any sample fails the C-22.0 (Field Spot Test). The producer may elect to not
 incorporate concrete that fails Method C-22.0 (Field Spot Test) instead of waiting
 for C-20.0 (hardened test) test results to determine the acceptability of the member. Once
 per each week’s production of prestressed concrete with corrosion inhibitor, random
 samples of hardened concrete powder will be taken from cylinders used for
 method C-21.0 (plastic test). These samples will be submitted to the Chemical Testing
 Laboratory for analysis using method C-20.0 (hardened test).

 31
 
 Units with calcium nitrite in a quantity less than specified are subject to rejection.
 Furnish powder drilled from concrete cylinders to the Engineer, in a quantity to be
 specified, to verify the concentrations of calcium nitrite in hardened concrete. Concrete
 failing to contain calcium nitrite at the required concentrations as tested is subject to
 rejection.
 
 32
 33
 
 Use only air-entraining, water-reducing and/or set-controlling admixtures in the
 production of concrete mixtures that are compatible with calcium nitrite solutions.
 
 34
 35
 36
 37
 
 Strictly adhere to the manufacturer’s written recommendations regarding the use of
 admixtures including storage, transportation and method of mixing. If preferred, use
 calcium nitrite, which acts as an accelerator, in conjunction with a retarder to control the
 set of concrete, as per the manufacturer’s recommendation.

 work site.
 (2) Mixing Time for Central Mixed Concrete
 
 32
 33
 34
 35
 36
 37
 
 The mixing time starts when all the solid materials are in the mixing compartment
 and ends when any part of the concrete begins to discharge. Charge the ingredients
 into the mixer such that some of the water enters in advance of cement and
 aggregate, and substantially all the water is in the drum before 1/3 of the specified
 mixing time elapses. Transfer time in multiple drum mixers is counted as part of the
 mixing time.
 
 38
 
 Establish the minimum mixing time by one of the following:
 
 39
 
 (a) Mixer performance tests as described herein,
 
 40
 
 (b) The manufacturer of the equipment, or
 
 41
 42
 43
 
 (c) The requirement of one minute for mixers of 1.0 cy capacity or less with
 an increase of 15 seconds for each cubic yard or fraction thereof in increased
 capacity.
 
 44
 45
 46
 
 The Engineer reserves the right to require a mixer performance test at any time. The
 minimum mixing time as determined by the mixer performance test is that which
 produces concrete in accordance with Table 1078-2.

 Sample and test for mixer performance as provided below. Charge the mixer to its
 rated capacity with the materials and proportions used in the work and mix at the
 recommended mixing speed to the target time. Stop mixing then and begin
 discharging. Take two samples of sufficient size to make the required tests after
 discharge of approximately 15% and 85% of the load by an appropriate method of
 sampling which provides representative samples of the concrete.
 
 7

 Separately test each of the two samples of concrete for the properties listed in
 Table 1078-2. Conduct tests in accordance with the standard methods shown in
 Table 1078-2 or procedures established by the Materials and Tests Unit.
 
 10
 11
 12
 
 Perform the mixer performance test described above on at least two batches of
 concrete. For the performance test to be acceptable, ensure that all tests in each
 batch meet the requirements listed in Table 1078-3.
 
 13
 14
 
 The Engineer rechecks mixer performance at any time when in his judgment
 acceptable mixing is not accomplished.
 
 15
 16
 17
 
 Where acceptable mixing cannot be accomplished in the established mixing time, the
 Engineer increases the mixing time or requires that the mixer be repaired or replaced
 before any further mixing.

 For central mixed concrete delivered in truck agitators, truck mixers, or transit mixed
 concrete, use a ticket system for recording the transportation of batches from the
 proportioning plant to the site of the work. Fill out the tickets on M&T Form 903 or
 approved delivery tickets in accordance with the instructions issued by the Engineer.
 Issue the tickets to the truck operator at the proportioning plant for each load and
 have them signed by the certified concrete technician, which signifies that the
 concrete in the truck is inspected before departure. Show on each ticket the time
 batching is complete and if transit mixed, the number of revolutions at mixing speed,
 if any, at the plant. Deliver the tickets to the inspector at the site of the work. For
 central mixed concrete delivered in non-agitating equipment, alternate methods of
 documenting batch proportions are considered by the Engineer. Loads that do not
 arrive in satisfactory condition within the time limits specified are not acceptable for
 use in the work.

 (K) Ready Mixed Concrete Plant
 Ensure ready mixed concrete plants are inspected and approved by the Department before
 they are used to produce concrete for the project. Ensure that plants meet all applicable
 requirements of the Standard Specifications and in addition have at least two acceptable
 concrete delivery vehicles that are in working condition. Plants approved by the
 Department are placed on a list of approved plants that is made available. All plants are
 subject to reinspection at intervals selected by the Engineer. Reapproval after each
 inspection is contingent on continuing compliance with the Standard Specifications

 Use metal forms, including headers or end forms, except where other materials are approved
 by the Engineer. Use forms of adequate thickness, braced, stiffened, anchored and aligned
 adequately to consistently produce members within the limits of dimensional tolerances.
 Design and align the forms so they do not restrict longitudinal movement of the casting when
 the prestressing force is transferred. Provide corners and angles that are chamfered or
 rounded. Provide joints in forms that are smooth and tight enough to prevent leakage of
 mortar. Plug holes and slots in forms, pallets, headers and bulkheads neatly to prevent
 leakage of mortar. Make the inside surfaces of forms accessible for cleaning. Thoroughly
 clean the beds and forms after each use. Before casting, clean the inside surfaces of the forms
 from rust, grease or other foreign matter. Remove all foreign substances from inside the
 forms, including any standing water. Do not allow coatings used for release of members to
 build up. Do not use forms that do not present a smooth surface.
 
 22
 23
 24
 25
 26
 
 When casting holes through the top flange of Bulb Tee Girders for overhang or interior bay
 falsework hanger rods, use rigid PVC conduits with a wall thickness of approximately
 1/8 inch. Do not use thin wall material. Secure conduits in the forms so they do not migrate
 out of the proper location. Other methods of forming holes may be proposed but are subject
 to the Engineer’s approval.
 
 27
 28
 29
 
 When casting dowel rod holes in cored slab or box beam members, use material that creates
 round, vertical holes of the specified diameter and in the correct location. Do not use material
 that deforms, collapses or shifts position during casting of the member.
 
 30
 31
 32
 33
 34
 
 Apply form release agents to the forms either before or after stringing of strands. If applied
 before stringing, provide a release agent of a type that dries to a degree so it cannot
 contaminate any strand that comes in contact with it. If the release agent is applied after
 stringing, exercise great care and provide a sheet metal or similar type shield for protection of
 the strands.

 Use tensioning devices adequate to produce and maintain the required tension in all strands
 until the concrete reaches the required transfer strength. Equip all jacks with accurate and
 calibrated gauges for registering jacking loads. Calibrate gauges with the jacks with which
 they are used. Calibrate all jacks and gauges by an approved testing company at no cost to the
 Department at intervals not to exceed 12 months. During progress of the work, if gauge
 readings and elongations indicate materially differing loads, recalibrate as required. Use
 gauges with a full load capacity of 1 1/2 to 2 times their normal working load, unless
 otherwise approved. Do not use loads less than one-fourth or more than 3/4 of the total
 graduated gauge capacity unless calibration data clearly establishes consistent accuracy over
 a wider range. Use gauges with indicating dials at least 6 inches in diameter and gauge
 pointers that do not fluctuate, preventing an accurate reading, but remain steady until the
 jacking load is released. Ensure that all gauges have an accuracy of reading within 2%.
 Provide means for measuring the elongation of strands within 1/4 inch.

 Position strands, ties, supports, reinforcing bars of the sizes shown in the plans and bearing
 plates in accordance with the detailed dimensions shown in the plans and effectively secure
 against displacement from their correct positions. The use of previously tensioned strands is
 not permitted. For prestressing strands, do not allow deflections or displacements of any kind
 between the end anchorages unless shown in the plans. Place the steel reinforcing in final
 position after tensioning of the strands. Bend all tie wires to the inside of the member so the
 ends are farther from the edge than the material tied. Support bottom strands spacings not to
 exceed 20 feet by supports meeting Article 1070-4 or by other approved means. Plastic
 supports may be used when approved.
 
 11
 12
 13
 14
 15
 16
 
 Strands with kinks, bends, nicks, scale, excessive rust or other defects are not permitted. No
 more than one broken wire per casting bed is permitted. Slight rusting is not cause for
 rejection, provided it is not sufficient to cause visible pits. Take precautions to prevent
 contamination of strands and reinforcing steel. Clean the strands and reinforcing steel to an
 acceptable condition before pouring concrete. Do not place concrete in the forms until the
 strand and reinforcement condition and arrangement are inspected by the plant inspector.
 
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 
 Strand splices are only permitted at the end of a reel and when using a single strand jack.
 Ensure that the strand lengths to be spliced together have the same lay of wire to avoid
 unraveling and position the splice so it does not fall within a member. Do not torch cut the
 ends of the spliced strand lengths. Cut by shears, abrasive grinders or other means approved
 by the Engineer. No more than one strand splice per bed is allowed on an individual strand
 and the use of previously tensioned strands for splicing is not permitted.
 
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
 31
 
 Where debonding of strands is required, accomplish by encasing the strand in a tubular
 conduit capable of resisting the pressure exerted by the concrete. Do not use slit conduit. Use
 a conduit of HDPE or polypropylene with a minimum wall thickness of 0.025 inch. Ensure
 that the inside diameter of the conduit is of sufficient size to allow free movement of the
 encased strand but not greater than the diameter of the strand plus 1/8 inch. Secure the
 conduit so longitudinal movement along the strand is prevented, and bonding of the strand is
 prevented at the required location ± 1 inch. Prevent concrete from entering the conduit by
 taping. Use tape manufactured from a non-corrosive material compatible with the concrete,
 conduit and steel.
 
 32
 
 1078-8 TENSIONING PROCEDURE
 
 33

 A producer quality control representative shall be present during strand tensioning. Tension
 each strand to the load shown in the plans before placing the concrete.
 
 35
 36
 37
 38
 39
 40
 41
 42
 43
 
 Measure the load induced in the prestressing strand both by jacking gauges and strand
 elongations on at least the first five strands and every third strand thereafter on each pour.
 Measure loads on all other strands by either jacking gauges or strand elongations. When both
 methods of measurement are used, if a discrepancy between gauge and elongation of more
 than 5% is apparent, carefully check the entire operation and determine the source of error
 before proceeding. Make appropriate allowances in the computed elongation and jacking
 loads for load losses due to friction and all possible slippage or relaxation of the anchorage.
 Establish references periodically at each strand anchorage to indicate any yielding or slippage
 that may occur between the time of initial tensioning and final release of the strands.
 
 44
 45
 46
 47
 48
 49
 50
 
 In determining the applied load by measuring the elongation of the strand, use a modulus of
 elasticity taken from the typical stress-strain curve for the brand, size and type of strand
 tensioned. Submit stress-strain curve data for the actual heats of material used in the strands
 to the plant inspector before using the strands. Identify each reel or strand by tagging in
 accordance with AASHTO M 203. Mark the outer layer of each reel pack of strand with a
 wide color band. In addition, attach a metal tag to each reel pack labeled in accordance with
 AASHTO M 203.
 10-138
 
 Section 1078

 Tension strands in a group or individually. Before full tensioning, bring each strand to
 an initial tension of 2,000 lbs. for all beds under 150 feet in length, 3,000 lbs. for all beds
 150 feet to 300 feet in length and 4,000 lbs. for all beds longer than 300 feet in length.
 Measure this initial tension by a calibrated gauge or other approved means, and then compute
 the elongation due to initial tensioning. Use the difference between the required final tension
 and the initial tension to compute the expected additional elongation.
 
 7
 8
 
 For precast prestressed deck panels, use a final prestressing force of 14,000 lbs. per strand for
 Grade 250 strand and 16,100 lbs. per strand for Grade 270 strand.
 
 9
 10
 11
 
 After initial tensioning, tension the strands until the required elongation and jacking load are
 attained and reconciled within the limits specified above. Keep a permanent record of the
 initial jacking load, the final jacking load, and the elongation produced thereby.
 
 12
 
 In single strand tensioning, rotation of the jacking ram is not allowed.

 When draped strands are used, submit the bed layout showing the method of draping and
 tensioning the draped strands and also calculations determining the loads required for
 tensioning the draped strands. Drape the strands for all members to be cast in any one
 tensioning operation before casting any beam. Have end templates or bulkheads at ends of
 beams remain vertical or as otherwise shown in the plans. Perform draping for all members
 either simultaneously or in single or incremental lifts beginning at the center of the bed and
 working outward toward each end of the bed. Complete tensioning in the fully draped
 position is not allowed unless approved in writing.
 
 21
 22
 23
 24
 
 Use round steel rollers of a type and dimensions approved by the Engineer for deflecting the
 draped strands. Round the part in contact with the strand to a diameter of not less than
 3/4 inch. Use support and hold-down devices of sufficient rigidity with adequate support so
 the final position of the strands is as shown in the plans.
 
 25
 26
 27
 28
 
 With strands tensioned in accordance with the above requirements and with other
 reinforcement in place, cast the concrete members so as to achieve the required lengths.
 Maintain strand load between anchorages until the concrete reaches the required compressive
 strength for transfer of load from the anchorages to the members.
 
 29
 30
 31
 
 For personnel engaged in the tensioning operation, provide protection by effective shields
 adequate to stop a flying strand. Provide shields produced from steel, reinforced concrete,
 heavy timbers and other approved material at both ends of the bed.

 Place concrete for girders 54 inches or less in height, and concrete for all cored slabs and box
 beams, in two or more equal horizontal layers. Place concrete for girders over 54 inches in
 height in three horizontal layers. When placing concrete in three layers locate the top of the
 first layer approximately at the top of the bottom flange and locate the top of the second layer
 approximately at the top of the web. To prevent separation of surfaces between layers, do not
 allow the time between successive placements onto previously placed concrete to exceed
 20 minutes, unless the previously placed concrete has not yet stiffened, as evidenced by the
 continuous effective use of vibration. Should shrinkage or settlement cracks occur, the
 Engineer reserves the right to require additional layers and/or vibration.
 
 46
 47
 
 The requirement of the above paragraph may be waived with the permission of the Engineer if
 self-consolidating concrete is used.
 
 48

 Internal or a combination of internal and external vibration is required as is necessary to
 produce uniformly dense concrete without honeycomb.

 Place the concrete in the bed in one continuous operation, finishing each member before
 proceeding to the next one. If the pour stops before the concrete in all the members in the bed
 is placed, start curing immediately. Do not place concrete in any remaining members in that
 bed setup once curing at elevated temperatures has begun.

 When cored slabs and box beams are cast, employ an internal hold-down system to prevent
 the voids from moving. At least 6 weeks before casting cored slabs or box beams, submit to
 the Engineer for review and comment, detailed drawings of the proposed void material and
 hold-down system. In addition to structural details, indicate the location and spacing of the
 holds-downs. Submit the proposed method of concrete placement and of consolidating the
 concrete under the void.

 1078-10 CURING CONCRETE
 
 16
 
 (A) General
 
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 
 Cure concrete by steam curing, radiant heat curing or water curing, as set forth below.
 As an option, cure concrete for prestressed piles with membrane curing compound as set
 forth below. Use a method or methods that prevent the concrete from losing moisture at
 any time before curing is complete. Use methods that do not deface or injure the
 concrete. Use curing procedures that prevent cracks from occurring in the members.
 Cure all members in any one bed by the same method.
 
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 
 Continue the curing period until the concrete reaches sufficient strength to permit transfer
 of load from the anchorage to the members. As soon as the concrete attains release
 strength, immediately release all forms in a continuous operation, without delay for other
 activities such as the cleaning of forms. Immediately following the removal of the forms,
 de-tension the members.
 
 28
 
 (B) Curing at Elevated Temperatures
 
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 
 Perform radiant heat curing under a suitable enclosure that contains the heat and prevent
 moisture loss. Apply moisture by a cover of moist burlap, cotton matting, or similar
 approved material. Retain moisture by covering the member with an approved waterproof
 sheeting in combination with an insulating cover. Support the cover at a sufficient
 distance above the member being cured to allow circulation of the heat.
 
 34
 35
 36
 37
 
 Provide steam curing enclosures essentially free of steam leakage to minimize moisture
 and heat losses. Do not allow the enclosure to come in contact with the members or
 forms for the members. Do not direct steam jets on the forms so as to cause localized
 high temperatures.
 
 38
 39
 40
 41
 42
 43
 44
 45
 
 After placing and vibrating, allow the concrete to attain its initial set before the
 application of heat or steam. The concrete is considered to obtain its initial set when it
 has a penetration resistance of at least 500 psi when tested in accordance with
 AASHTO T 197. Take the sample of concrete tested for penetration resistance from the
 last load cast in the bed. Store the sample of concrete with the precast member and
 maintain in the same condition and environment as the member except for the periods of
 time necessary to prepare the test specimen and to perform the penetration resistance test.
 Conduct the penetration resistance test.
 
 10-140
 
 Section 1078
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 
 As an option, submit data indicating that an approved concrete mix attains its initial set
 after some particular time period. Different periods may be required for different weather
 conditions. If such data is submitted, consideration is given to permitting heat or steam
 introduced after the time indicated by such data instead of having to perform the
 penetration resistance test. Consideration is given to determining the time of initial set by
 methods other than AASHTO T 197 provided data supporting such other methods is
 submitted.
 
 8
 9
 10
 
 When the ambient air temperature is below 50°F, cover the forms after the placement of
 concrete and apply sufficient heat to maintain the temperature of the air surrounding the
 unit between 50° and 70°F.
 
 11
 12
 13
 14
 
 When the ambient air temperature is above 70°F, start a water cure as set forth below or
 other approved method as soon as the concrete is able to receive the water without
 physical damage to its surface. Discontinuation of the cure is allowed upon introduction
 of steam, provided that a relative humidity of 100% is maintained.
 
 15
 
 The temperature within the curing enclosure shall not exceed 160°F.
 
 16
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 
 Maintain a relatively uniform rate of increase of the temperature within the curing
 enclosure of approximately 40°F per hour, not to exceed 15°F per 15 minutes. Ensure
 that the temperature increase is relatively uniform throughout the length and on both
 sides and top of the concrete unit. Place recording thermometers within 50 feet of each
 end of the bed and at points not to exceed 100 feet between the end thermometers.
 Provide at least two thermometers for bed lengths of 100 feet or less. Calibrate recording
 thermometers at intervals not to exceed 6 months. Ensure that the temperature differential
 within the curing enclosure does not exceed 15°F. Submit complete temperature records
 for all cures before final approval of the members.
 
 25
 
 Continue steam curing until the concrete reaches the required transfer strength.
 
 26
 
 (C) Water Curing
 
 27
 28
 29
 30
 
 Keep the concrete continuously wet by the application of water as soon as possible
 without damage to the concrete surface, and before the concrete obtains an initial set of
 500 psi. Apply the water using soaker hoses and wet burlap or other approved means for
 the full length of each member. Apply water evenly along the entire length of the bed.
 
 31
 32
 33
 34
 35
 36
 37
 38
 
 When the ambient air temperature is below 50°F cover the forms after the placement of
 the concrete and apply sufficient heat in an approved manner to maintain the temperature
 of the air surrounding the member between 50°F and 70°F. After the concrete obtains
 an initial set of 500 psi, the air temperature surrounding the member is allowed to
 increase to 100°F while continually maintaining moisture on the surface of the concrete.
 Whenever heat is applied to the member, place temperature recording clocks on the bed
 as required when curing at elevated temperatures. The requirements for rate of
 temperature increase apply.
 
 39
 40
 
 Maintain the application of heat (if used) and water until the concrete obtains release
 strength.
 
 41
 42
 43
 44
 45
 
 (D) Curing with Membrane Curing Compound
 As an option, cure prestressed concrete piles with a membrane curing compound. Spray
 the entire surface of the concrete uniformly with a wax-free, resin-base curing compound
 conforming to Article 1026-2. Use clear curing compound to which a fugitive dye is
 added for color contrast.
 
 10-141
 
 Section 1078
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 
 Apply the membrane curing compound after the surface finishing is complete, and
 immediately after the free surface moisture disappears. In the event the application of
 curing compound is delayed, start another curing method immediately and continue until
 the application of the curing compound is started or resumed or until the concrete reaches
 the required detensioning strength.
 
 6
 7
 8
 
 Seal the surface with a single uniform coating of the specified type of curing compound
 applied at the rate of coverage recommended by the manufacturer or as directed by the
 Engineer, but not less than one gallon per 150 sf of area.
 
 9
 10
 11
 12
 
 At the time of use, thoroughly mix the compound in a condition with the pigment
 uniformly dispersed throughout the vehicle. If the application of the compound does not
 result in satisfactory coverage, stop the method and apply water curing, as set out above,
 until the cause of the defective work is corrected.
 
 13
 14
 15
 16
 
 At locations where the coating shows discontinuities, pinholes, or other defects, or if rain
 falls on the newly coated surface before the film dries sufficiently to resist damage, apply
 an additional coat of the compound immediately after the rain stops at the same rate
 specified herein.
 
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 
 When the ambient air temperature is below 50°F, cover the forms after the application of
 the curing compound and apply sufficient heat in an approved manner to maintain the
 temperature of the air surrounding the member between 50°F and 70°F. Whenever heat
 is applied to the members, place recording thermometers on the bed as required when
 curing at elevated temperatures. The requirements for rate of temperature increase also
 apply.
 
 23
 24
 
 Completely remove any curing compound adhering to a surface to which new concrete is
 bonded by sandblasting, steel wire brushes, bush hammers or other approved means.
 
 25
 26
 27
 
 Protect the concrete surfaces to which the compound is applied from abrasion or other
 damage that results in perforation of the membrane film until the concrete achieves
 design strength and the members are de-tensioned.
 
 28
 
 1078-11 TRANSFER OF LOAD
 
 29
 30
 
 A producer quality control representative or equivalent qualified personnel shall be present
 during removal of forms and during transfer of load.
 
 31
 32
 33
 34
 35
 36
 
 Transfer load from the anchorages to the members when the concrete reaches the required
 compressive strength shown in the plans. Loosen and remove all formwork in one continuous
 operation as quickly as possible as soon as release strength is obtained. As soon as the forms
 are removed, and after the Department’s Inspector has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect
 the member, transfer the load from the anchorages to the members as quickly as possible in
 one continuous operation using the approved detensioning sequence.
 
 37
 38
 39
 40
 41
 
 For any particular group of members cast in the same bed, do not transfer the load to any
 concrete until the test cylinder breaks indicate that the concrete in all these members has
 reached the required strength as outlined in Subarticle 1078-4(B)(3). If these conditions are
 not met, delay the transfer of the prestressing load to the concrete until tests of additional
 cylinders show that the required strength is reached.
 
 42
 43
 44
 45
 46
 
 When curing at elevated temperatures, begin the procedures for transferring prestressing load
 immediately after curing is discontinued and the forms are released, and while the concrete is
 still hot to prevent cooling shrinkage and cracking. If so directed by the Engineer, cover
 members or otherwise protect so as to cool the concrete slowly after release to prevent
 thermal shock and the evaporation of moisture in the members.

 Transfer load to not cause cracks in members. Transfer load by gradual release of the strands
 as a group, by gradual release of part of the group, or by burning the fully tensioned strands at
 the ends of the members. If intending to release the strands by a method other than gradual
 release of the entire group, submit six copies of the proposed method and pattern of release, if
 not so shown in the plans, for approval. Rigidly follow the approved method and pattern of
 release. When the fully tensioned strands are burned, burn each strand or group of strands
 simultaneously at each end of the bed in its indicated order in the pattern and at each end of
 each member before proceeding to the strands in the next group in the pattern at any point.
 Because of the critical nature of the bond development length in prestressed concrete panel
 construction, if transferring of stress by burning the fully tensioned strands at the ends of the
 member, burn each strand first at the ends of the bed and then at each end of each member
 before proceeding to the next strand in the burning pattern.
 
 13
 14
 15
 16
 17
 18
 
 When detensioning all girders, box beams, cored slabs, piles, and panels do not burn strands
 quickly but heat with a low oxygen flame played along the strand for at least 5 inches until the
 metal gradually loses its strength. Apply heat at such a rate that failure of the first wire in
 each strand does not occur until at least 5 seconds after heat is first applied. When
 detensioning other members, follow the above procedure unless an alternate procedure is
 approved. Detensioning by arc welder is not allowed.
 
 19
 20
 
 Incorporate the following in the method for single strand detensioning of members having
 draped strands:
 
 21
 22
 
 (A) Release the pair of straight strands located in the uppermost position in the lower flange
 first.
 
 23
 24
 
 (B) Then release the tension in the draped strands at the ends and uplift points in accordance
 with an approved pattern.
 
 25
 
 (C) Disengage all hold-down devices for draped strands and release the hold-downs.
 
 26
 
 (D) Then release the pair of straight strands located in the upper flange.
 
 27
 28
 
 (E) Release the remaining straight strands of the pattern in accordance with an approved
 sequence.
 
 29
 30
 
 (F) Release all strands in a manner meeting the Engineer’s approval that will cause
 a minimum shock and lateral eccentricity of loading.
 
 31
 32
 
 Failure to follow the above procedures for transfer of load is ground for rejection of the
 members involved.

 1078-12 VERTICAL CRACKS IN PRESTRESSED CONCRETE GIRDERS BEFORE
 DETENSIONING
 
 35
 36
 37
 
 This section addresses prestressed concrete members that have vertical casting cracks before
 strand detensioning. Certain types of these cracks have been determined by the Department to
 render the girders unacceptable.
 
 38
 39
 40
 41
 42
 
 Unacceptable cracked members are those with two or more vertical cracks spaced at a
 distance less than the member depth which extend into the bottom flange. Such members are
 not serviceable and will be rejected. Members with two or more vertical cracks spaced at a
 distance less than the member depth but do not extend into the bottom flange are subject to
 an engineering assessment. Such members may not be serviceable and may be rejected.
 
 43
 44
 45
 46
 47
 
 Members with one or more vertical cracks that extend into the bottom flange and are spaced
 at a distance greater than the member depth are subject to an engineering assessment to
 determine their acceptability. If this engineering assessment is required, submit, at no
 additional cost to the Department, a proposal for repairing the member and a structural
 evaluation of the member prepared by an engineer licensed by the State of North Carolina.
 
 10-143
 
 Section 1078
 1
 2
 3
 
 In the structural evaluation, consider the stresses under full service loads had the member not
 cracked and the effects of localized loss of prestress at the crack as determined by methods
 acceptable to the Department.
 
 4
 5
 6
 7
 
 All members, except those defined as unacceptable, which exhibit vertical cracks before
 detensioning, shall receive a 7 day water cure as directed by the Engineer. The water cure
 shall begin within 4 hours after detensioning the prestressing strands and shall be at least
 3 feet beyond the region exhibiting vertical cracks.
 
 8
 9
 
 The Department has the final determination regarding acceptability of any members in
 question.

 1078-13 PRESTRESSED CONCRETE GIRDER WEB SPLITTING
 
 11
 12
 
 After detensioning of certain girders with draped strands, cracks occasionally occur in the
 webs at the ends of the girders.
 
 13
 14
 15
 
 Repair all cracks located in the web of girders appearing after detensioning that are
 0.010 inches (0.25 mm) or greater in width by means of epoxy injection in accordance with
 the Standard Specifications and as approved by the Engineer.
 
 16
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 
 Repair any web cracks that are less than 0.010 inches (0.25 mm) and greater than 0.005 inches
 (0.15 mm) in width by coating them with an approved clear, water based alkylalkoxysilane
 (silane) penetrating sealant having a minimum 40 percent solids. Use a sealant that meets the
 requirement of NCHRP 244 and Federal AIM VOC emissions standards and has been
 approved by the Engineer. Coat web cracks between 0.005 inches (0.15 mm) and 0.010 inches
 (0.25 mm) in width with silane within 2 weeks after they appear or before shipment to the site
 whichever occurs soonest.
 
 23
 
 Cracks located in the web less than or equal to 0.005 (0.15 mm) in width need not be coated.
 
 24
 25
 26
 
 Do not repair or coat any cracks without prior approval of the Engineer. No separate payment
 will be made for the treatment of cracks, as payment is included in the contract unit price bid
 for prestressed concrete girders.
 
 27
 28
 
 Repair of web cracks shall not be a substitute for using an approved debonding pattern for
 future girders as described below.
 
 29
 30
 31
 
 If such cracks occur, employ a method to remedy this condition on all subsequent girders of
 the same type and strand pattern. If debonding of strands is used, satisfy the following
 criteria:
 
 32
 33
 34
 35
 
 (A) Do not debond the two straight strands in the top of the girder. Debond 1/2 of the straight
 strands, as nearly as possible, in the bottom flange. As nearly as possible, debond 1/4 of
 the straight strands in the bottom of girder 4 feet from each end of the girder and debond
 1/4 of the straight strands 2 feet from each end of the girder.
 
 36
 
 (B) Use a debonding pattern that is symmetrical about the vertical axis of the girder.
 
 37
 38
 
 (C) Debond strands so the center of gravity of the strands in the bottom of the girder remain
 within 1 inch of their original location at the end of the girder.
 
 39
 
 (D) Debond strands in accordance with Article 1078-7.
 
 40
 41
 
 No separate payment is made for debonding strands as payment is included in the contract
 unit price bid for prestressed concrete girders.

 1078-14 HANDLING, TRANSPORTING AND STORING
 
 2
 3

 Members damaged while being handled or transported are rejected or require repair in
 a manner approved by the Engineer. All members are allowed to be handled immediately
 after transfer of load from the anchorages to the members is complete.
 
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
 10
 11
 12
 
 Store all prestressed members on solid, unyielding, storage blocks in a manner to prevent
 torsion or objectionable bending. In handling prestressed concrete girders 54 inches or less in
 height, including cored slabs and box beams, maintain them in an upright position at all times
 and pick them up within 5 feet of the points of bearing and transport and store supported only
 within 3 feet of points of bearing. In handling prestressed concrete girders greater than 54
 inches in height, maintain them in an upright position at all times and submit for approval the
 proposed method of lifting, transporting, and storing the girders. When requested, provide
 calculations to confirm girders are not overstressed by such operations.
 
 13
 14
 15
 
 Prestressed concrete panels are weak in the direction perpendicular to the prestressing strands,
 therefore, they are subject to breakage during handling, storing or transporting. Provide
 adequate blocking during all of these construction phases.
 
 16
 17
 18
 
 In handling, transporting, and storing prestressed members, use the number and location of
 supports in accordance with the plan requirements for the sizes, lengths and types of members
 involved, or as approved.
 
 19
 
 When handling the prestressed concrete members, a temporary stress of

 Do not transport members away from the casting yard until the concrete reaches the minimum
 required 28 day compressive strength and a period of at least 5 days elapses since casting,
 unless otherwise permitted.
 
 24
 25
 
 Do not transfer any member from the plant to the job site before approval of that member by
 the plant inspector. This approval is stamped on the member by the plant inspector.
 
 26
 
 1078-15 FINAL FINISH
 
 27
 28
 29
 
 Finish prestressed concrete members that are intended for composite action with subsequently
 placed concrete or asphalt with a roughened surface for bonding. Make sure that no laitance
 remains on the surfaces to be bonded.
 
 30
 31
 32
 33
 34
 35
 
 Rough float the tops of girders. Broom finish the top surface of the cored slab and box beam
 sections receiving an asphalt overlay. Rake the top surface of cored slab and box beam
 sections receiving a concrete overlay to a depth of 3/8 inch. No surface finish is required for
 sides and bottom of the slab and beam sections except the exposed side of the exterior unit as
 noted below. Provide a resulting surface finish essentially the same color and surface finish
 as the surrounding concrete.
 
 36
 37
 38
 39
 40
 
 Provide a 3/4 inch chamfer along the bottom edges on ends and sides of all box beam and
 cored slab sections, top outside edges of exterior sections and acute corners of sections.
 Round the top edges on ends of all sections with a 1/4 inch finishing tool. Provide square
 corners along top edges on all sections along shear keys. Do not chamfer vertical edges at
 ends of sections.
 
 41
 42
 43
 44
 45
 46
 47
 
 Fill all voids in the diagonal face of the bottom flange of prestressed concrete girders and the
 outside face of exterior cored slabs and box beams with a sand-cement or other approved
 grout. Fill all voids in piles greater than 1/2 inch in diameter or depth as above. Provide
 a resulting surface finish essentially the same color and surface finish as the surrounding
 concrete. Repair voids greater than 1/4 inch in diameter or depth in other faces of these and
 other members except piles in a like manner. Where an excessive number of smaller voids
 exist in any member, the Engineer requires a similar repair.
 
 5 f ci is permitted,

 Repair honeycomb, excessively large fins, and other projections as directed. Submit, at no
 additional cost to the Department, a proposal for repairing members with honeycomb, cracks
 or spalls. Do not repair members containing honeycomb, cracks, or spalls until a repair
 procedure is approved and the member is inspected by the Engineer. Any appreciable
 impairment of structural adequacy that cannot be repaired to the satisfaction of the Engineer is
 cause for rejection.

 10
 
 Clean and fill holes caused by strand hold downs upon removal from the casting bed. Use
 patches of materials approved by the Engineer that develop strength at least equal to the
 minimum 28 day strength requirement for the concrete before approval of the member.
 Ensure that members are clean and surfaces have a uniform appearance.
 
 11
 12
 13
 14
 
 Give the top surface of prestressed concrete panels a raked finish or other approved finish to
 provide an adequate bond with the cast-in-place concrete. As soon as the condition of the
 concrete permits, rake the top surface of the concrete making depressions of approximately
 1/4 inch. Take care when raking not to catch and pull the coarse aggregate.
 
 15
 16
 
 Clean reinforcing bars exposed on the tops of girders and exterior cored slabs or box beams of
 mortar build up and excessive rust.

 SECTION 1081
 EPOXY AND ADHESIVES
 
 32
 
 1081-1 EPOXY RESIN SYSTEMS
 
 33
 
 (A) Classification
 
 34
 
 The types of epoxies and their uses are as shown below:
 
 35
 36
 37
 
 Type 1 - A low-modulus, non-sag gel adhesive used to bond or repair damp, vertical or
 overhead surfaces. Typical applications include walls, concrete foundations, concrete
 pipe, conduit and ceilings.
 
 38
 39
 40
 41
 42
 43
 
 Type 2 - A low-modulus, general-purpose adhesive used in epoxy mortar repairs. It may
 be used to patch spalled, cracked or broken concrete where vibration, shock or expansion
 and contraction are expected. Feather-edged patching is not recommended with this
 material; instead, the adjacent concrete perimeter should be sawed at least 1/4 inch to
 1/2 inch deep and any remaining concrete chipped away to provide a vertical interface
 between the epoxy mortar and concrete.
 
 44
 45
 46
 47
 48
 49
 
 Type 3 - A high-modulus general-purpose adhesive used to bond plastic concrete or
 hardened concrete to hardened concrete or other structural materials. It may be used to
 produce a high-strength epoxy mortar grout bed for equipment or to patch interior spalls,
 cracks or broken concrete. It is not recommended for exterior patching because its rate of
 thermal expansion and contraction differs too greatly from concrete. It may be used for
 anchoring bolts where a flowable adhesive is required.
 10-163
 
 Section 1081
 1
 2
 
 Type 3A - A gel-like version of Type 3, used specifically for embedding dowel bars,
 threaded rods, rebars and other fixtures in hardened concrete.
 
 3
 4
 5
 
 Type 4A - A gray protective coating for concrete, wood, steel and other structural
 materials. It is typically used as a topcoat in waterproofing concrete exposed to splash
 zones and tidal water.
 
 6
 
 Type 4B - A red primer coating used with Type 4A.
 
 7
 8
 9
 10
 11
 
 Type 5 - A high modulus, low viscosity adhesive suitable for pressure injection into
 cracks in concrete. For some non-structural crack repairs, Type 5 epoxy may be poured
 on the surface to penetrate cracks by gravity. This may be beneficial before
 waterproofing and skid proofing.
 (B) Requirements
 
 12
 13
 
 Epoxies shall conform to the requirements shown in Table 1081-1 using the test methods
 described in Article 1081-3.
 
 14
 15
 16
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 
 For epoxy resin systems used for embedding dowel bars, threaded rods, rebar, anchor
 bolts and other fixtures in hardened concrete, the manufacturer shall submit test results
 showing that the bonding system will obtain 125% of the specified required yield
 strength of the fixture. Furnish certification that, for the particular bolt grade, diameter
 and embedment depth required, the anchor system will not fail by adhesive failure and
 that there is no movement of the anchor bolt. For certification and anchorage, use
 3,000 psi as a minimum Portland cement concrete compressive strength used in this test.
 Use adhesives that meet Section 1081.
 
 22
 23
 24
 
 List the properties of the adhesive on the container and include density, minimum and
 maximum temperature application, setting time, shelf life, pot life, shear strength and
 compressive strength.
 
 25
 
 (C) Properties of Epoxy Resin Systems
 
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
 31
 
 (1) All integral fillers, pigments and thixotropic agents shall be fine enough to not
 separate, settle or cause skinning during storage of the epoxy components. Do not
 use abrasive fillers such as alumina and silica flour. Do not use solvents. When
 mineral fillers are to be added during mixing, they shall be inert, readily dispersible
 and except for sand, have fineness such that 99% of the material will pass
 a No. 325 sieve.
 
 32
 33
 34
 35
 
 (2) The coefficient of expansion of cured epoxy is 6 times greater than that of concrete.
 Therefore, to reduce spalling and peeling during temperature changes, avoid thick
 layers of pure epoxy. A 4:1 by weight sand-epoxy mortar has approximately the
 same coefficient of expansion as concrete.
 
 36
 37
 
 (3) The shelf life of parts A and B shall be at least one year from the date of
 manufacture.
 
 38
 39
 
 (4) Types 1 through 5 epoxy resin systems are moisture insensitive and can be applied
 on clean, dry or damp surfaces free of standing water.

 Resin” and “Component B - Contains Curing Agent”, for combining immediately before
 use in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Mark each container with the
 manufacturer’s name, NCDOT type, lot or batch number, quantity, date of manufacture,
 shelf life or expiration date, color, mixing instructions, usable temperature range and
 hazards or safety precautions.
 
 15
 16
 17
 
 Furnish the two components in separate non-reactive containers. Provide containers of
 such size that the proportions of the final mix can be obtained by combining a single
 container of one component with one or more whole containers of the other component.

 (H) Notes on Use of Epoxies
 (1) Safety
 Epoxies can irritate the eyes, skin and respiratory tract. Therefore, wear chemical
 splash goggles, chemically-resistant gloves and protective clothing and boots when
 handling epoxies. Respiratory protection is usually not needed if epoxies are mixed
 and applied in well-ventilated areas, but avoid prolonged breathing of vapors.
 Follow all MSDS instructions for proper use of these materials.
 (2) Mixing
 
 26
 27
 
 Stir parts A and B individually until each component is homogeneous. Use a separate
 stirrer for each component.
 
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 
 Combine parts A and B, either by weight or volume, as specified in the
 manufacturer’s instructions. Stir the mixture vigorously, periodically scraping the
 sides and bottom of the container. Small quantities of epoxy usually require 2 to
 3 minutes to mix homogeneously; 5-gallon quantities can take up to 10 minutes of
 mixing.
 
 33
 34
 35
 
 Temperature affects the viscosity and pot life of epoxies. Most laboratory tests are
 conducted at 77°F. Higher temperatures render epoxies thinner and faster setting;
 lower temperatures induce higher viscosities and longer pot lives.
 
 36
 37
 
 Add sand or other fillers to liquid epoxies only after parts A and B have been
 thoroughly mixed. Stir in the sand or filler until all particles are completely coated.
 
 38
 
 (3) Storage and Substrate Temperature
 
 39
 40
 41
 42
 
 Store epoxies at temperatures between 50°F and 90°F. Epoxy components exposed
 to the extremes of this range or outside this range should be conditioned to 77°F
 before mixing and blending. If heat is necessary, always use indirect methods such
 as hot water, a heated room or a microwave oven to condition components.
 
 43
 44
 
 When applying epoxy to a cold substrate, preheat the components approximately 1°F
 above 77°F for every 2°F of substrate temperature below 77°F.
 
 45
 46
 
 Seal previously opened containers to be airtight. Unsealed containers can absorb
 moisture from the atmosphere, which can alter the chemical reaction of the mixture.

 Test Method
 See Subarticle 10813(B)
 ASTM C430 as
 modified in
 Subarticle 1081-3(B)
 
 Determine flow according to Section 6 of ASTM D5329 with the exception that the
 oven temperature shall be 158°F ± 2°F and sample preparation done according to
 Section 7.1 of ASTM D5.
 (2) Viscosity
 Viscosity is to be determined according to ASTM D2669 or ASTM D4402 using
 a spindle speed of 10 rpm. Heat the adhesive to approximately 410°F and allowed to
 cool. Determine viscosity at 400°F ± 1°F.
 (3) Asphalt Properties
 Properties of the base asphalt are to be determined on the material obtained from the
 following extraction and Abson recovery methods. Extract the asphalt by heating the
 adhesive just to the point where it will easily flow and then transfer 125 to 150 g into
 400 ml of trichloroethylene with a temperature of 125°F to 150°F. Thoroughly stir
 this mixture to dissolve the asphalt. Decant the trichloroethylene-asphalt mixture
 decanted and the asphalt recovered using the Abson recovery method, ASTM D1856
 as modified by the following. The extraction methods of ASTM D2172 do not apply
 and there will be no filtration of the solvent asphalt mixture. The extraction solution
 of trichloroethylene and asphalt shall be centrifuged for at least 30 minutes at
 770 times gravity in a batch centrifuge. Decant this solution in the distillation flask,
 taking care not to include any filler sediment. Apply heat and bubble carbon dioxide
 solution slowly to bring the solution temperature to 300°F. At this point the carbon
 dioxide flow is increased to 800 ml to 900 ml per minute. The solution temperature
 is maintained at 320°F to 335°F with this carbon dioxide flow for at least 20 minutes
 and until the trichloroethylene vapors have been completely removed from the
 distillation flask. Repeat the above extraction-recovery method as necessary to
 obtain the desired quantity of asphalt. Use the asphalt recovered to determine
 penetration, 275°F viscosity, and 275°F viscosity ratio.
 (4) Viscosity Ratio
 Determine the 275°F viscosity ratio by comparing the 275°F viscosity on the base
 asphalt before and after the thin-film oven test. Perform the thin-film oven test in
 accordance with ASTM D1754. Determine the specific gravity by pycnometer as in
 ASTM D70 for use in the thin-film oven test. Calculate the 275°F viscosity ratio by
 dividing the viscosity after the thin-film oven test by the original 275°F viscosity.
 (5) Filler Material
 Separate the filler material from the asphalt to determine Filler Content and Filler
 Fineness. Determine the portion by weight of the adhesive insoluble in
 1,1,1 trichloroethane by weighing 10.00 ± 0.01 grams of solid adhesive into
 10-169
 
 Section 1081

 a centrifuge flask with approximately 100 ml volume such as that specified in
 ASTM D1796. Add 50 ml of 1,1,1-trichloroethane to the adhesive, which should be
 broken up in small pieces to speed up the dissolution solids. Place the sample flask
 in a balanced centrifuge and spin using a minimum relative centrifugal force of
 150 in accordance with ASTM D1796 for 10 minutes. Remove the sample flask and
 decant the solid, taking care not to lose any solids. Repeat the application of solvent
 and centrifuging until the solvent becomes clear and the filler is visually free of
 asphalt. Dry the filler at 160°F ± 5°F to remove solvent and weigh the resulting
 filler. Filtration of the decanted solvent may be performed to verify there is no loss
 of filler. Percent filler content is calculated as follows:

 Determine Filler Fineness according to ASTM C430 using number 325, 200 and
 100 sieves. This method is to be modified by using a water soluble non-ionic
 wetting agent, such as Triton X-100, to aid the wetting action. Concentration of the
 surfactant solution shall be approximately 1% by weight. Thoroughly wet the onegram dry sample in the surfactant solution and allowed to soak for 30 minutes.
 Transfer the filler completely into the sieve cup and apply water spray for 2 minutes.
 Surfactant solution may be added as needed and physical means used to disperse any
 clumped particles. Dry the sample and handle as described in ASTM C430.
 (C) Prequalification
 Bituminous adhesives are required to be pre-qualified by the Department’s
 Transportation-Traffic Engineering Branch. Interested parties shall submit a sample to
 a qualified independent testing laboratory for testing in accordance with
 Subarticle 1081-3(A) at no cost to the Department. Submit a Type 2 materials
 certification in accordance with Article 106-3 with the results and the name of the testing
 laboratory along with a qualification sample(s) of the same lot to the Department for
 evaluation. For more information on the pre-qualification process, contact the
 Work Zone Traffic Control Unit.
 (D) Packaging and Labeling

 24
 
 Place all types of portable concrete barrier or water filled barrier as shown in the contract.
 When required by the plans, anchor portable concrete barrier by an approved method as
 shown in the Roadway Standard Drawings.
 
 25
 
 Use one type of barrier on any continuous run of barrier within the project.
 
 26
 27
 
 Barrier shall be placed on an asphalt or concrete surface. Barrier should not be placed on
 cross slopes steeper than 6:1.
 
 28
 29
 30
 
 Use portable concrete barrier that avoids trapping water in sags, vertical curves, areas of
 wedging and paving where super-elevations have been changed and other low spots as
 directed. Provide adequate drainage behind the portable concrete barrier.
 
 31
 32
 33
 
 Lift, place and reset portable concrete barrier units using a two-point pick up, or other
 acceptable method, which does not over-stress, damage or mar the surface of the
 roadway. Do not use connection points for lifting purposes.
 
 34
 35
 
 Do not use any barrier units that are cracked, damaged, chipped or otherwise
 nonfunctional.
 
 36

 Place and install water filled barrier units as shown in the plans and per manufacturer
 specifications.
 
 38
 39
 40
 41
 
 In work zones with speed limits of 45 mph and less, use Test Level II barrier units.
 Water filled barrier at a 36 inch height is preferred to limit sight distance impairment. If
 devices taller than 36 inches are used in this situation, transition down to 36 inches or
 shorter on the intersection approaches to provide proper sight distance.
 
 42
 43
 44
 
 In work zones with speed limits over 45 mph, use Test Level III barrier units. The units
 shall be evaluated on a case by case basis to ensure ample space is available for device
 deflection. Follow the manufacturer’s specifications and recommendations.
 
 45
 
 Furnish barrier delineators for portable concrete and water filled barrier.

 Drill anchor holes normal to the surface of installation using a pneumatic drill with
 a depth indicator, unless another drilling method is allowed. Make sure that the
 diameter of the hole is in strict conformance with the Roadway Standard Drawings
 or the manufacturer's recommendations. When directed, use a jig or fixture to ensure
 correct positioning of the holes and proper alignment during the drilling process.
 Adjust hole locations, as necessary, to avoid encountering reinforcing steel.
 Immediately after drilling, brush the holes with a stiff-bristled brush of a sufficient
 size to effectively remove dust from the sides of the hole, and blow all holes free of
 all dust and debris using oil free compressed air. Repeat this procedure until the hole
 is completely clean.
 
 18
 19
 20
 
 Inspect each hole immediately before placement of the anchor. Rework any hole
 found to deviate from these requirements to ensure that an acceptable hole is
 achieved.
 
 21
 
 Check each hole with a depth gauge to ensure proper embedment depth, if required.
 
 22
 
 Satisfactorily repair all spalled or damaged pavement.
 
 23
 24
 25
 
 Once the barrier and anchors are removed, fill the holes with grout. These
 requirements may be waived if the bridge or roadway will no longer be used by
 traffic.
 
 26
 
 (2) Adhesive Anchoring Method for Concrete Surfaces
 
 27
 
 Comply with Subarticle 1170-3(B)(1).
 
 28
 
 Mix adhesives in strict conformance with the manufacturer's instructions.
 
 29
 30
 31
 32
 
 Pour the mixed adhesive into the hole. Agitate or rotate anchors to ensure complete
 wetting and encapsulation. Insert the anchors to the specified depth. Completely fill
 the anchor hole with adhesive and remove any excess adhesive flush with the
 pavement. Do not disturb any anchors while the adhesive is hardening.
 
 33
 34
 35

 components for approval before installation.
 
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 
 The plan locations of the light standards and high mounts may be adjusted to be behind
 guardrail, to avoid obstructions or to avoid undesirable foundation conditions. Ensure
 location changes are approved before construction. Light standards can be moved no
 more than 10 feet longitudinally and 2 feet laterally unless approved by the Department.
 High mast light standards can be moved no more than 25 feet radially unless approved by
 the Department. Verify project dimensions on the site, actual measurement always taking
 precedence over scaled plan dimensions, with every part of the work fitted to actual
 conditions at the site.
 
 33
 
 (B) Damage to Facilities
 
 34
 35
 36
 37
 38
 39
 
 Take all precautions necessary to avoid damage to existing underdrains and other buried
 facilities located in certain areas. Hand trenching may be required to avoid damage to the
 underdrains, storm sewer systems and other facilities. Construct light pole foundations
 with a minimum horizontal clearance of 10 feet to storm sewers or other underground
 installations which might affect the foundation stability. Make lateral and longitudinal
 changes in pole locations in the field to provide the required clearance, as directed.
 
 40
 41
 42
 
 Trenching and construction operations may require the removal of, or result in damage
 to, existing shoulders and paved ditches. Restore all disturbed portions of the project to
 their original condition or as approved.
 
 43
 44
 45
 46
 
 Installation of conductors may require trenching through existing guardrail locations.
 Trenching may be done beneath the guardrail in a manner that will not disturb the
 guardrail installation or the Contractor may remove short sections of guardrail to
 facilitate mechanical trenching. Reinstall all removed guardrail by the end of the day's
 14-4
 
 Section 1400

 work. Permission is required before removal of any guardrail. Repair any damage to the
 guardrail installation or to the galvanizing of the material as directed.
 
 3
 4
 5
 
 Repair all trenched, excavated, or otherwise damaged earth surface areas by shaping,
 smoothing, seeding and mulching the damaged areas as required by the Specifications
 and as directed.
 
 6
 
 (C) Existing Utilities
 
 7
 8
 
 Water, sewer, telephone, fire alarm, traffic signal and power lines may be located in the
 same area that lighting standards and circuits are to be installed.
 
 9
 10
 
 Locate these lines before operations are begun. Field changes approved by the Engineer
 may be made to provide clearance required by the NESC.
 
 11
 12
 13
 
 Foundations or other construction which is installed in conflict with existing utilities will
 not be acceptable. Remove unacceptable conflicting construction and repair damage to
 utilities at no cost to the Department.
 
 14
 15
 16
 
 When the work involves replacing or renovating existing lighting, make all reasonable
 efforts to prevent dark spots in the lighting system. Phase lighting construction to allow
 existing lighting to remain in operation as long as possible.
 
 17
 
 (D) Operation of Equipment
 
 18
 19
 20
 
 Use a bucket truck to raise workers into position to install and/or adjust luminaires and
 lamps after the initial setting of the standards. Taking down the light standard to check or
 make adjustments at the top is not allowed.
 
 21
 
 Install all bore pits outside the clear zone.
 
 22
 
 (E) Conduit Installation
 
 23
 24
 25
 26
 
 Install conduit continuous, watertight, free of kinks and make all runs with as few
 couplings as standard lengths will permit. Do not exceed a total angle of 270° between
 outlets unless otherwise approved. Conduit bodies with covers and neoprene gaskets
 may be used to facilitate the installation of the wires at locations indicated in the plans.
 
 27
 28
 29
 
 Provide protection at all times against the entrance of water or other foreign matter into
 the conduit. Plug or cap conduit when work is temporarily suspended, including nightly
 stoppage of work.
 
 30
 31
 32
 
 Clean all conduits before installation and upon completion of the system. Snake an
 approved cleaner with a diameter not less than 85% of the nominal diameter of the
 conduit through each conduit before installing the wire.
 
 33
 34
 35
 
 Install the conduit in such a manner that temperature changes will not cause elongation or
 contraction that might damage the system. Provide expansion fittings where conduit
 crosses structure expansion joints and at other locations shown in the plans.
 
 36
 37
 
 Avoid short radius bends in non-metallic conduit to prevent burn-through of the pulling
 cable or conductors during pulling operations.
 
 38
 39
 40
 41
 42
 43
 44
 45
 46
 47
 
 Install caps or plugs on stub-outs for future use. Caps and plugs shall be made of the
 same material as the conduit. Where non-metallic conduit is joined to metallic conduit,
 use a transition adapter. Install bushings on all conduit ends projecting into panels, boxes,
 or other enclosures. Provide pull lines in all conduits for future installation of circuitry.
 Coat field cut threads and other uncoated metal or damaged galvanizing with organic zinc
 repair paint. Securely fasten conduit. For the spacing of fasteners, do not exceed 4 feet
 for 1 1/2 inches conduit and larger or 6 feet for 1 1/4 inches conduit and smaller. Use
 fasteners that are hot dipped galvanized or stainless steel. Provide backs with all conduit
 straps installed on flat surfaces. Rotary-impact drills may be used for installing expansion
 anchors in concrete. Do not use powder explosion type units.

 Do not pull wire through a conduit system until the system is complete and has been
 cleaned. Use approved wire pulling lubricants. Pull conductors by hand, or use
 motorized cable-pulling equipment designed for pulling multiple cables into conduit.
 Use sheaves or rollers, as required to prevent damage to conductor insulation. Use a
 dynamometer (clutch device) so as not to exceed maximum allowable pulling tension if
 conductor is pulled by mechanical means. Do not use a motorized vehicle or heavy
 equipment to generate pulling forces. Color code all conductors per the NEC (grounded
 neutral is white, grounding is bare or green) and use phase conductors which are black
 and red. Approved marking tape, paint, or sleeves may be used instead of continuous
 colored conductors for No. 8 AWG and larger. White, red or black conductor may be
 stripped at all accessible points and used as a bare equipment grounding conductor.
 
 16
 17
 
 Joints, taps and splices will only be permitted at locations indicated in the plans and by

 Install UL Listed manufactured set screw type connectors, suitable for connecting
 multiple wires for all phase conductor splices. These precise fit connectors are insulated
 with high–strength dielectric material and have removable access plugs over the set
 screws. Direct buried and/or submersible versions of these connectors (UL486D),
 equipped with factory made waterproof insulating boots, are required for splicing inside
 junction boxes. Non-direct buried and/or non-submersible connectors (UL486A and
 UL486B) may be used for phase conductor splicing in normally dry areas such as inside
 poles and transformer bases. After tightening set screw, tape down the access plugs to
 keep them securely in place. Split-bolt connectors may be used for ground wire splicing.
 Wire nut and compression type connectors will not be allowed.
 
 28

 Section 1400-11.
 
 21
 22
 23
 24
 25
 
 During project construction perform an insulation resistance test on each feeder circuit
 conductor. The insulation resistance for each conductor shall exceed 5 megaohms after
 charging for 30 seconds at 500 VAC or 1000 VDC. The Contractor Meg Circuit Data Form is
 available on the Department website. Submit the data form to the Engineer for review before
 final inspection.
 
 26
 27
 28
 
 If the insulation resistance test of any conductor indicates a value of less than 5 megaohms,

 conductor. If the fault is at a terminal connection, repair or replace the terminal device.
 
 29
 30
 31
 32
 
 Removing water from the conduit of a faulty circuit is not considered a repair. Water in the
 conduit allows electric current to flow between skinned places in the conductor’s insulation.
 If a circuit fails the insulation resistance test and removing water allows the circuit to pass,
 replace the conductors and re-test the new circuit.

 34
 
 1550-4 TRENCHLESS METHODS
 
 35
 
 (A) Bore and Jack
 
 36
 37
 38
 39
 
 For bore holes up to 6 inches in diameter in stable ground, the hole may be augured and
 the pipe pushed or jacked through the cleaned out hole. For bore holes greater than 6
 inches, provide continuous support of the hole by simultaneously jacking the pipe or
 casing into the hole.
 
 40
 41
 42
 43
 44
 
 Use equipment suitably sized and designed to simultaneously bore or drill the soil or rock
 while pushing or jacking pipe on a controlled grade. Position the cutter head within one
 diameter of the leading edge of the pipe. In cohesive, dense and dry soils and rock,
 position the cutter head in front of the leading edge. In non-cohesive or loose soils,
 position the cutter head inside the pipe.
 
 15-20
 
 Section 1550
 1
 2
 
 Dry bore only, do not use jetting or wet boring methods. Use drilling fluids only on the
 outside of pipe for lubrication or hole stabilization.
 
 3
 4
 
 Minimize over bore, match cutter diameter to the outside diameter of the encasement
 pipe. Limit overbore to the O.D. + 2 inches.
 
 5
 
 Provide steering controls as necessary to maintain line and grade.
 
 6
 7
 8
 
 If conditions allow and with the approval of the Engineer, the Contractor may elect to use
 the pipe ramming method in lieu of bore and jack. Payment for the pipe ramming
 method will be paid as bore and jack.
 
 9
 
 (B) Directional Drilling
 
 10
 11
 12
 13
 
 For drilled holes up to 6 inches in diameter in stable ground, the hole may be drilled and
 reamed followed by pulling the pipe into the hole within 8 hours. For drilled holes
 greater than 6 inches, simultaneously pull the pipe or casing into the hole as reaming
 occurs
 
 14
 15
 
 When under pavement or within a one horizontal to one vertical distance from pavement,
 maintain the depth of cover in Table 1550-1.
 TABLE 1550-1
 DEPTH OF COVER FOR DIRECTIONAL DRILLING
 Drilled Hole Diameter
 2" to 6"
 > 6" to 15"
 > 15" to 36"
 
 Minimum Depth of Cover
 6 ft
 12 times the hole diameter
 15 ft
 
 16
 
 Begin bores at locations that allow transitioning the bore to meet the above depths.
 
 17
 18
 19
 
 Use drilling fluids as appropriate for the type soils. Pump drilling fluids only while
 drilling or reaming. Monitor flow rates to match the amount leaving the bore hole. Do
 not increase pressure or flow to free stuck drillheads, reamers or piping.
 
 20
 21
 
 Limit drilled or reamed holes to 1.5 x O.D. for pipe 12 inches or less and O.D. + 6 inches
 for pipes larger than 12 inches.
 
 22
 
 (C) Tunneling
 
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 
 Tunnel using hand mining, mechanical excavation, tunnel boring machine (TBM),
 microtunneling, or other accepted tunneling method. Use tunnel shields or fore poling
 along with benched excavation and breast boarding as appropriate for the field
 conditions. Alternatively, the Contractor’s engineer may certify that the soils are
 self-supporting of the dead and live loads and design tunneling methods as appropriate.
 
 28
 29
 
 Provide active support to the tunnel walls. Shore tunnel walls using liner plates, steel ribs
 with lagging or other engineered method or by jacking piping into place.
 
 30
 31
 
 Limit over excavation to 2 inches larger than the liner or shield. Grout the external voids
 as work progresses and as specified by the Contractor’s engineer.
 
 32
 
 (D) Pipe Ramming
 
 33
 34
 
 Use pipe ramming only where soils are homogeneous and free of rock, boulders, stumps
 and debris. Do not use in the vicinity of quick or liquefiable soils.
 
 35
 36
 37
 
 Steel bands 1/2 inch thick are allowed on the outside of the leading edge of the pipe or
 casing to oversize the hole to reduce friction. Steel bands 1/2 inch thick may be used on
 the inside to compact the spoil and to prevent plugging.
 
 38
 
 Install at the following minimum depth of cover.

 Cut and satisfactorily dispose of weeds or other unacceptable growth on the areas to be
 seeded. Shape and smooth uneven and rough areas outside of the graded section, such as crop
 rows, farm contours, ditches and ditch spoil banks, fence line and hedgerow soil
 accumulations and other minor irregularities which cannot be obliterated by normal seedbed
 preparation operations, to provide for more effective seeding and for ease of subsequent
 mowing operations.
 
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 
 Scarify or otherwise loosen the soil to a depth of not less than 5 inches except as otherwise
 provided below or otherwise directed. Break clods and work the top 2 inches to 3 inches of
 soil into an acceptable seedbed by the use of soil pulverizers, drags or harrows; or by other
 approved methods. Remove all rock and debris 3 inches or larger on median, shoulder and
 ditch cut or fill slopes which are 3:1 or flatter, before the application of seed and fertilizer.
 Remove rock 6 inches and larger displaced during seeding operations.
 
 30
 31
 32
 
 Scarify, groove, trench or puncture all slope surfaces. The depth of preparation and the
 degree of smoothness of the seedbed may be reduced on cut slopes that are 2:1 and steeper, as
 permitted by the Engineer.
 
 33

 Obtain approval from the Engineer before using equipment for the application, covering
 or compaction of limestone, fertilizer and seed. Approval may be revoked at any time if
 equipment is not maintained in satisfactory working condition, or if the equipment
 operation damages the seed.
 
 10
 11
 12
 13
 
 Apply limestone, fertilizer and seed within 24 hours after completion of seedbed
 preparation unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer. When the Engineer determines
 that weather and soil conditions are unfavorable, do not distribute any limestone or
 fertilizer and do not sow any seed.
 
 14
 15
 16
 17
 
 Take adequate precautions to prevent damage to traffic, structures, guardrails, traffic
 control devices or any other appurtenances during the application of fertilizer. Provide
 adequate covering or change methods of application as required to avoid such damage.
 Repair any damage that occurs, including any cleaning that may be necessary.
 
 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 
 (B) Limestone and Fertilizer
 Limestone may be applied as a part of the seedbed preparation, provided it is
 immediately worked into the soil. If not so applied, distribute limestone and fertilizer
 uniformly over the prepared seedbed at the specified rate of application and then harrow,
 rake or otherwise thoroughly work or mix into the seedbed.
 (C) Seed
 
 24
 25
 26
 27
 
 Distribute seed uniformly over the seedbed at the required rate of application, and
 immediately harrow, drag, rake or otherwise work so as to cover the seed with a layer of
 soil. Cover to a depth as directed by the Engineer. If two kinds of seed are to be used
 which require different depths of covering, sow separately.
 
 28
 29
 30
 31
 32
 
 When a combination seed and fertilizer drill is used, drill fertilizer with seed after
 applying and incorporating limestone into the soil. If using two kinds of seed requiring
 different depth of cover, the seed requiring the lighter cover may be sown broadcast or
 with a special attachment to the drill, or drilled lightly following the initial drilling
 operation.
 
 33
 34
 35
 
 When using a hydraulic seeder for application of seed and fertilizer, do not allow the seed
 to remain in water containing fertilizer for more than 30 minutes before application
 unless otherwise permitted.
 
 36
 37
 
 Compact the seedbed immediately after seed has been properly covered in the manner
 and degree approved by the Engineer.
 
 38
 
 (D) Modifications
 
 39
 40
 41
 42
 
 When adverse seeding conditions are encountered due to steepness of slope, height of
 slope or soil conditions, the Engineer may direct or permit that modifications be made in
 the above requirements which pertain to incorporating limestone into the seedbed;
 covering limestone, seed and fertilizer; and compaction of the seedbed.
 
 43
 
 Such modifications may include but not be limited to the following:
 
 44
 
 (1) The incorporation of limestone into the seedbed may be omitted as follows:
 
 45
 
 (a) On cut slopes steeper than 2:1;
 16-24
 
 Section 1660

 2
 
 (b) On 2:1 cut slopes when a seedbed has been prepared during the excavation of
 the cut and is still in an acceptable condition; or
 
 3
 4
 
 (c) On areas of slopes where the surface of the area is too rocky to permit the
 incorporation of the limestone.
 
 5
 6
 
 (2) The rates of application of limestone, fertilizer and seed on slopes 2:1 or steeper or
 on rocky surfaces may be reduced or eliminated.
 
 7

 during the mulching operations.
 
 23
 24
 25
 26
 
 Spread mulch uniformly by hand or by approved mechanical spreaders or blowers which
 will provide an acceptable application. An acceptable application will be that which will
 allow some sunlight to penetrate and air to circulate but also partially shade the ground,
 reduce erosion and conserve soil moisture.
 
 27
 
 (C) Holding Mulch
 
 28
 29
 30
 31
 
 Hold mulch in place by applying a sufficient amount of undiluted emulsified asphalt or
 other approved binding material. The Engineer will approve the rate and method of
 application of binding material. Apply the binding material directly with the mulch or
 immediately following the mulch application.
 
 32

 Stake sod in place by driving stakes flush with the sod, on all slopes 2:1 or steeper, in
 drainage channels, on other areas shown in the plans, and on any areas that are in such
 condition that there is danger of sod slipping. Perform staking concurrently with sod
 placement and before tamping with sound wooden stakes which are approximately one
 inch square or one inch in diameter and not less than 12 inches in length. Place enough
 stakes to prevent slipping or displacement of the sod. Drive stakes perpendicular to the
 slope. Where backfill is necessary on cut slopes to obtain a uniform sodding area,
 provide stakes of sufficient length to reach at least 3 inches into the solid earth
 underneath the backfill.
 
 18
 19
 20
 
 On all other areas, use metal staples in place of wooden stakes. The metal staples should
 be 12 inches long, made of 11 gauge new steel wire so as not to bend when pinned or
 driven through the sod. Shorter staples may be used with the approval of the Engineer.
 
 21
 22
 23
 
 Place, stake and staple the sod where necessary, then tamp or roll carefully and firmly by
 acceptable means. If rolled, roller shall weigh 150 lbs. per foot of roller width. Take
 extreme care to prevent the installed sod from being torn or displaced.

 Scarify the walls and floor of the plant hole after the plant hole is dug. Place the plant in
 the prepared plant hole at the proper position as regards to depth, alignment, final grade
 of the surrounding ground level and vertical placement of the trunk. Maintain this
 position during all subsequent backfilling and watering operations. Set plants with the
 root collar at the same depth as grown in the nursery or raise above grade as indicated in
 the plans.
 
 7
 8
 9
 10
 11
 
 Moisten the soil with water after one-half to two-thirds of the backfilling and tamping has
 been completed, if the soil in the plant holes is not sufficiently moist. Apply water to
 moisten all soil but not a quantity that will saturate the soil to the extent of excluding all
 air from around the roots. Place the remainder of the backfill after complete absorption
 of water.
 
 12
 13
 14
 15
 
 Construct water rings around all plants, except reforestation plants, in accordance with
 details shown in the plans. A water ring consists of a ridge of firmed soil in a ring around
 the plant and of a minimum inside diameter equal to the diameter of the plant hole. This
 ridge is approximately 6 inches high and is compacted firmly enough to hold water.

 (B) Balled and Burlapped Plants
 Handle balled and burlapped plants by the ball and place in the plant hole so that the soil
 of the ball will not be loosened from the roots. After the hole has been almost completely
 backfilled and the soil thoroughly firmed under and around the ball, cut the burlap away
 and remove from around the stem of the plant. Complete backfilling so as to avoid
 loosening of the soil of the root ball.
 (C) Container Grown Plants
 Planting requirements for container grown plants are the same as applicable to balled and
 burlapped plants. Remove container immediately before planting. During the removal of
 the container, take sufficient precautions to ensure that the soil and roots inside the
 container are undisturbed. Scarify roots when directed.
 (D) Bare Rooted Plants
 Before the plant is placed in the plant hole, cut off smoothly any bruised or broken parts
 of roots. Place the plant in its proper position in the hole and backfill. Carefully place
 the backfill material, worked around and under the roots and compacted in a manner that
 avoids bruising or breaking the roots.
 (E) Reforestation Plants
 
 33
 34
 35
 
 Reforestation includes tree reforestation and shrub reforestation. Type, mixture, size,
 furnish description and spacing will be as shown on the reforestation detail sheet in the
 plans.
 
 36
 37
 38
 39
 
 Before beginning reforestation, each area to be reforested will be measured by the
 Engineer to determine the exact number of acres for tree reforestation or shrub
 reforestation therein and the quantity of each species of seedling to be planted within the
 area.
 
 40
 41
 42
 43
 44
 45
 46
 
 Where structures or plantings do not adequately delineate the outline of the area to be
 reforested, stake the outline of the area as directed by the Engineer. Furnish cypress,
 cedar, oak, locust or other wood stakes approved by the Engineer. Provide stakes with
 a minimum industry standard of 2 inches x 2 inches (nominal) size and approximately
 30 inches in length with a 15 inch white top. Drive stakes in the ground with
 approximately 18 inches remaining above the ground line and place as necessary to
 define and delineate the reforestation outline.
 
 47
 48
 
 Ensure sample stock of reforestation seedlings are inspected by the Engineer, for general
 health and moisture content, within 24 hours before planting.
 16-36
 
 Section 1670

 After the plant hole has been prepared, place the plant upright in the hole at the correct
 depth without crowding or bunching the roots. Firm the soil around the root system from
 the bottom of the plant hole to natural ground elevation.
 
 4
 5
 6
 
 Upon completion of planting the required number of seedlings within all areas to be
 reforested, the Contractor will be relieved of further responsibility in connection with
 reforestation except for damage caused directly by the Contractor.
 
 7
 
 (F) Geophytes
 
 8
 9
 10
 11
 12
 
 When planting geophytes; bulbs, corms and tuberous plants; take care to place all plants
 at a uniform depth as indicated in the plans or directed by the Engineer. All plants shall
 be set upright as originally grown and at the proper spacing and depth from the natural
 ground elevation. Soil that is backfilled into the hole to obtain the proper depth shall be
 firmed before plant placement. Soil backfilled over the plant shall be firmed.
 
 13
 14
 15
 16
 
 Planting shall be accomplished when the soil temperature is 40°F to 45°F or as directed
 by the Engineer. No phase of this work shall be performed when the temperature is
 below 32°F, when the plant holes are frozen or when soil to excavate and fill the plant
 hole is frozen or too wet.
 
 17
 18
 19
 20
 
 Geophytes shall be watered as stated in the contract or as directed by the Engineer.
 Watering will be required for geophytes if the soil in the plant hole is not sufficiently
 moist. Apply water to moisten all soil, but not in a quantity that will create standing
 water or saturate the soil to the extent of excluding all air from around the plant.
 
 21
 
 1670-10 MULCH FOR PLANTING
 
 22
 23
 24
 
 Place mulch within 7 days of initial planting as a top layer on the backfilled plant hole and
 water ring. Place mulch approximately 4 inches deep as shown in the plans or as directed.
 Place additional mulch as directed during establishment.
 
 25
 
 No mulching will be required for reforestation plants.
 
 26
 
 1670-11 WATER FOR PLANTING
 
 27
 28
 29
 30
 
 Water at the time of planting as specified in Article 1670-9 and at the Contractor’s election
 and the Engineer’s approval. Water with gravity flow or low pressure applicators which have
 been approved, and which will not erode soil around the plant root system or damage to
 plants. Saturate the soil around each plant thoroughly at each watering.
 
 31
 
 1670-12 STAKING OR GUYING
 
 32
 
 Stake or guy plants as shown in the plans or as directed to prevent damage.
 
 33
 34
 35
 
 Ensure that the plant is attached and held rigid to the support in a manner that will prevent
 chafing or other injury to the bark, and that will permit normal development of the trunk or

 (A) General
 
 7
 
 Ensure conduit is free of moisture and debris before pulling cables.
 
 8
 9
 10
 11
 
 Following installation of conduit where cable is not immediately installed or conduit is
 for future use (spare), seal the ends of the conduit with a conduit plug. Secure a pull line
 to the conduit plug in such a manner that it will not interfere with installation of the
 conduit plug and provides a watertight seal.
 
 12
 13
 
 Extend ends of conduit 2 inches to 4 inches above concrete surfaces and 4 inches above
 crushed stone bases. For metallic conduit, install metallic bushings and bond conduits.
 
 14
 
 (1) Conduit
 
 15
 
 (a) Conduit Entering Junction Boxes
 
 16
 17
 18
 
 Terminate conduits installed for communications cables (fiber optics, twisted
 pair, ethernet and coaxial) in oversized junction boxes. Do not install other
 conduits in the oversized junction box unless otherwise specified.
 
 19
 20
 
 Terminate conduits installed for signal wiring, including lead-in cable, in
 standard size junction boxes unless otherwise specified.
 
 21
 22
 23
 
 For all conduits entering junction boxes, seal spare conduits with approved
 conduit plugs. Seal conduits containing fiber-optic communications cable,
 signal cable and lead-in cable with duct and conduit sealer.

 (b) Conduit Entering Cabinet Foundations
 For all conduits entering the cabinet through the cabinet foundation, seal spare
 conduits with approved conduit plugs. Seal conduits containing fiber-optic
 communications cable, signal cable and lead-in cable with duct and conduit
 sealer.
 (2) Tracer Wire
 Install tracer wire in all conduits containing fiber-optic cable. Pull tracer wire
 simultaneously in a continuous length with the fiber-optic cable. Where multiple
 pulls of fiber-optic cable are required and conduit is placed in the same trench, only
 one tracer wire is required. Where multiple pulls of fiber-optic cable are required
 and conduits may separate into individual trenches, install a tracer wire in each
 conduit run. Provide waterproof butt splices where tracer wire is spliced. Splicing
 will be allowed only in cabinets and junction boxes. Label all tracer wires entering
 the equipment cabinet.
 
 17-11
 
 Section 1715

 7
 
 In certain cases the Contractor may use an alternate material and method of installation
 between trenching and plowing based on existing field conduits and preferences. Obtain
 approval before proceeding.
 
 8
 
 (1) General
 
 9
 10
 11
 12
 
 Install PVC, HDPE or rigid metallic conduit for all underground runs. Install rigid
 metallic conduit for all underground runs located inside railroad right-of-way. Clean
 existing underground conduit to be incorporated into a new system. Bond all
 metallic conduit.
 
 13
 14
 
 If more than one conduit is required between the same points, install conduit in one
 common trench. Install non-detectable marker tape.
 
 15
 16
 17
 
 Install longitudinal runs of conduit a minimum of one foot from back of curb or
 6 feet from edge of pavement in the absence of curb. If ditches are present, install
 conduit a minimum of 4 feet from the bottom of the ditch line.
 
 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 
 Maintain a minimum trench depth of 30 inches (or 12 inches in areas blocked by
 rock or impenetrable obstructions) below finished grade or 6 inches below roadway
 subbase, whichever is deeper. Upon completion, restore surface to like-original
 condition within 7 calendar days of occurrence of damage. Remove all rock and
 debris from backfill material. Remove excess material from site and compact area
 according to Article 300-7. Backfill with excavated material and compact to 95% of
 original density.
 
 25
 26
 27
 28
 
 Backfill trench at locations along the trench path where non-movable objects, such as
 rocks and boulders, cannot be avoided. The purpose of the backfill is to provide
 a gradual change in elevation of the trench, so that excessive bending and stress will
 not be transferred to conduits once underground conduit system is installed.
 
 29
 30
 31
 32
 33
 
 After installation of conduits and upon completion of tamping and backfilling,
 perform a mandrel test on each conduit to ensure no conduit has been damaged.
 Furnish a non-metallic mandrel having a diameter of approximately 50% of the
 inside diameter of the conduit in which it is to be pulled through. If damage has
 occurred, replace the entire length of conduit. Ensure pull line is re-installed.
 
 34
 
 (2) Unpaved Trenching
 
 35
 36
 
 Install conduit in all unpaved areas for all cable including permanent traffic signal
 installations.
 
 37
 38
 
 As shown in plans or as directed by the Engineer, direct bury lead-in cable for
 temporary traffic signal installations.
 
 39
 40
 
 Rake smooth the top 1 1/2 inches and seed with same type of grass as surrounding
 area. Finish unpaved areas flush with surrounding natural ground.
 
 41
 
 (3) Paved Trenching
 
 42
 43
 
 On concrete surfaces, replace the entire joint of concrete unless otherwise specified.
 On all other surfaces, neatly cut and replace the width of trench with like material.

 Finish paved areas with materials matching damaged areas. For conduit installed
 under roadways, cut neatly and replace the width of paved area damaged by
 trenching. For conduit installed under sidewalks and walkways, remove entire
 section of slab from joint to joint and replace. Place graded stone material to
 temporarily maintain traffic where repairs cannot be performed immediately.
 Comply with Article 545-4.
 (C) Plowing (HDPE Conduit Only)
 
 8

 10
 
 Direct plow HDPE ducts simultaneously using chute plow method. Direct plow ducts at
 a minimum depth so the top of the highest duct is 30 inches deep unless otherwise
 approved.
 
 11
 12
 13
 14
 15
 16
 
 Provide sufficient personnel to feed chute, operate prime mover and equipment carrying
 reels (if separate equipment is used), observe chute feeding, observe plowing and observe
 reel payout. Use chute with adequate dimensions to allow for passage of duct without
 damage. During plow operation, continuously check chute opening and path to be sure
 there are no obstructions and monitor payout reels to be sure reels are turning at a steady
 rate.
 
 17

 Provide a means of collecting and containing drilling fluid/slurry that returns to the
 surface such as a slurry pit. Provide measures to prevent drilling fluids from entering
 drainage ditches and storm sewer systems. Prevent drilling fluid/slurry from
 accumulating on or flowing onto pedestrian walkways, driveways and streets.
 Immediately remove all drilling fluids/slurry that are accidentally spilled.
 (2) Directional Drill Operations
 
 7
 8
 
 Provide grounding for the drill rig in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 recommendations.
 
 9
 10
 11
 
 Place excavated material near the top of the working pit and dispose of properly.
 Backfill pits and trenches to facilitate drilling operations immediately after drilling is
 completed.
 
 12
 13
 14
 15
 
 Use drill head suitable for type of material being drilled and sized no more than
 2 inches larger than the outer diameter of the conduit. Direct drill to obtain proper
 depth and desired destination. Pressure grout with an approved bentonite/polymer
 slurry mixture to fill all voids. Do not jet alone or wet bore with water.
 
 16
 17
 18
 19
 20
 
 During drilling operation, locate drill head every 10 feet along drill path and before
 traversing underground utilities or structures. Use digital walkover locating system
 to track drill head during directional drilling operation. Ensure locating system is
 capable of determining pitch, roll, heading, depth and horizontal position of the drill
 head at any point.
 
 21
 22
 23
 24
 25
 26
 
 Once drill head has reached final location, remove head and install back reamer of
 appropriate size (no more than 2 inches larger than outer diameter of conduits) to
 simultaneously facilitate back reaming of drill hole and installation of conduit. Back
 reamer is sized larger than actual conduits to ensure conduits are not adversely
 subjected to deviations caused by the original drill operation and are as straight as
 practical in their final position.
 
 27
 28
 29
 30
 
 The intent of these Specifications is to limit the diameter of the actual drill shaft/hole
 so that it is no more than 2 inches larger than the conduit outer diameter. The 2
 inches larger diameter may be accomplished during the original bore or during the
 back reaming/conduit installation process.
 
 31
 32
 33
 
 Once installation of conduit has started, continue installation without interruption so
 as to prevent conduit from becoming firmly set. Apply bentonite/polymer slurry
 mixture during conduit installation.
 
 34
 35
 36
 37
 38
 
 Upon completion of conduit installation, perform a mandrel test on conduit system to
 ensure conduit has not been damaged. Furnish non-metallic mandrel with a diameter
 of approximately 50% of the inside diameter of the conduit in which it is to be pulled
 through. If damage has occurred, replace the entire length of conduit and ensure that
 pull line is re-installed.
 
 39
 
 (3) Drilling Fluids
 
 40
 41
 42
 43
 44
 45
 
 Use lubrication for subsequent removal of material and immediate installation of the
 conduit. The use of water and other fluids in connection with directional drilling
 operations will be permitted only to the extent necessary to lubricate cuttings. Do
 not jet alone or wet bore with water. Use drilling fluid/slurry consisting of at
 least 10% high-grade bentonite/polymer slurry to consolidate excavated material and
 seal drill hole walls.
 
 46
 47
 
 Transport waste drilling fluid/slurry from site and dispose of in a method that
 complies with Federal, State and local laws and regulations.

 Upon cutting the cable and removing the outer jacketing material down to the individual
 buffer tubes, secure the central strength member to the enclosure so that no tensile force
 is applied to the fibers. Secure the individual buffer tubes to the splice trays by a method
 recommend by the manufacturer. Determine the length of each buffer tube needed to
 ensure the buffer tube can be looped a minimum of two times around the inside the splice
 tray. Upon determining the length of buffer tube needed remove the buffer tube to
 expose the individual fibers for fusion splicing. Adjust individual fiber lengths as
 necessary to ensure that once the fusion splicing process is completed that the finished
 splices will align with the “splice block organizer” supplied within the splice tray.
 Ensure the slice block organizer has individual fusion splice space holders for each fiber
 splice.

 While prepping the individual fibers for splicing install the heat shrink protecting tube
 over the fiber and then perform the splicing operations, following the manufacturer’s
 instructions. Verify the newly formed splice does not exceed 0.05 dB of attenuation.
 If the attenuation is more than 0.05 dB then remake the splice until it meets the 0.05 dB
 or less requirement. Finish the splicing operation by sliding the heat shrink tube over the
 splice and applying heat to activate the heat shrink tubing. Secure the finished splice in
 the splice block organizer. Ensure each splice is properly secured in a space holder in the
 splice block organizer. Multiple splices secured to the same space holder are
 unacceptable.
 
 22
 23
 
 Ensure all buffer tubes are contained within splice trays so no bare fibers are outside tray
 and do not damage the fiber or violate the minimum bending radius of the fiber.

 Prior to installing the cover over the splice tray and placing it in its final resting location,
 take a mandatory digital photograph of the splice tray that shows the final workmanship.
 Ensure the photograph shows the “Workmanship Identification Information” as well as
 the workmanship associated with installing and terminating the fiber. Include digital
 copies of each photograph on a compact disk as part of the OTDR Test Results submittal.
