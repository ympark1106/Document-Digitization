 Successor – An Activity that succeeds another Activity. The start or finish
 date may be controlled by its predecessor.
 
 P.
 
 Total Float – The cumulative length of time activities can be delayed
 before they affect the project substantial completion date or a contractual
 milestone. Float is a shared commodity between both parties to the
 contract and not for the exclusive use or financial benefit of either party.

 c.
 
 Provide written notice within ten calendar days documenting
 the disagreement between Department’s calculations of
 weekly delay costs.
 Failure to provide notification is interpreted as acceptance
 that Department records are accurate.
 
 C.
 
 Time will be added to the contract based on a mutually agreed to schedule
 impact analysis showing lost time attributable to the delay-causing event.
 
 D.
 
 Excusable Delay costs will be determined as follows:
 1.
 Direct Costs – Actual certified costs of the workforce and
 equipment idled by the delayed activity.
 2.
 Field Indirect Costs – Actual certified cost increases for job-site
 supervision and field office operating costs or other costs not
 directly associated with a particular work activity for the period of
 delay.
 3.
 Home Office Overhead – The markup allowed on all change orders
 includes the cost of home office overheads associated with that
 change in the project scope of work.
 a.
 Demonstrate the following to be entitled to alleged additional
 compensation for under-absorbed home office overhead
 costs:
 1)
 Under absorption actually occurred, meaning there
 was less revenue overall in relationship to home office
 costs and that no replacement work was obtained.
 2)
 The under absorption was a direct result of the
 project.
 3)
 Specific replacement work could have been
 reasonably obtained were it not for the alleged delay.
 b.
 Provide the following information supporting the claim
 additional costs:

 Total reimbursable amount for
 unabsorbed home office overhead
 4)
 Home office overhead will be reimbursed if the delay
 occurs after the project is 90 percent complete.
 d.
 The Department does not compensate for the following:
 1)
 Profit.
 2)
 Loss of profit.
 3)
 Labor inefficiencies.
 4)
 Consequential damages, including but not limited to,
 loss of bonding capacity, loss of bidding opportunities,

 Determining FCA
 1.
 FCA applies only to acceptable work performed on individual
 contract items in Table 1 with values of more than $100,000 based
 on original contract quantities, unless otherwise specified in Table 1
 2.
 FCA does not apply to work added by change order.
 3.
 FCA may be positive or negative depending on the changes or
 differences between the BPf and the EPf.
 4.
 Work performed after the expiration of contract time, the EPf will be
 limited to the lesser of:
 a.
 The EPf for the estimate period when the work was
 performed.
 b.
 The EPf for the last partial estimate period before the
 expiration of the contract time.
 
 D.
 
 FCA Formula
 When the EPf is more than 15 percent above the BPf
 FCA = [(EPf - BPf) - 0.05 BPf] Q (FF)
 42
 When the EPf is more than 15 percent below the BPf
 FCA = [(EPf - BPf) + 0.05 BPf] Q (FF)

 Utah
 Wyoming
 b.
 This average value is then averaged with values obtained in
 the same manner for the previous three weekly reports to
 establish the EPa.
 c.
 The EPa remains in effect until the first Monday of the
 following month and is used for regular partial estimates
 closed before the first Monday of the following month.
 Base Price for asphalt (BPa) – The contract base asphalt price,
 equal to the EPa in effect on the date of the contract bid opening or
 other date where prices are submitted for the establishment of a
 contract such as the proposal submittal date for a design build
 project.
 Adjusted Base Price for asphalt (ABPa) is 115 percent of the BPa
 on the up side and 85 percent of the BPa on the down side. No
 price adjustment will be paid when the EPa is between 85 percent
 and 115 percent of the BPa.
 Asphalt cost adjustment (ACA) – The asphalt cost adjustment in
 dollars determined according to this article.
 
 Determining the ACA
 1.
 The provisions of this article become effective and remain in effect
 for the duration of the contract when the EPa of asphalt materials
 changes more than 15 percent from the BPa.
 2.
 The Engineer determines ACA for each partial estimate following
 this provision becoming effective. The adjustment on each item is
 determined using the formula in this article.
 3.
 Adjustments in compensation may be either plus or minus
 depending on the differences between the ABPa and the EPa.
 4.
 Work added by change order is not eligible for ACA.
 5
 The EPa will be limited to the lesser of the following for work
 performed after the expiration of contract time and approved time
 extensions:

 Stakes for miscellaneous items not listed above will have a horizontal and vertical
 tolerance of 0.20 ft, unless otherwise directed.
 Features that are to be constructed flush to another surface should take on the same
 tolerance as that surface.
 Staking tolerances for special circumstances will be discussed at the pre-survey meeting.
 Meet the appropriate construction tolerances for the material as specified in the special
 provisions or standard specifications, regardless of the construction staking tolerances,
 specific to the work item.
 Use bridge control once established, independent of other project controls for the
 duration of the bridge construction. Refer to Survey & Geomatics Standards manual for
 bridge control methodology. Refer to http://www.udot.utah.gov/go/standardsreferences.
 Tolerances stated for each type of construction stake in this table indicates the
 acceptable deviation of the position of each reference point from its computed position
 relative to the given alignment and grade. Staked positions are generally checked using
 electronic stakeout reports and, if within tolerances, the stated position is accepted.
 Reference points may also have an accuracy relative to each other for precise
 measurements such as structures.

 EXISTING MILEPOST SIGNS
 A.
 
 Locate existing milepost sign stations within the project limits.
 1.
 Contact the Engineer to determine locations where a milepost sign
 was placed at a point other than the actual mile point due to prior
 physical limitations such as driveways, intersections, or bridge
 parapets, in coordination with Highway Referencing Specialist of
 the Asset Management Division.
 
 B.
 
 Reestablish locations of milepost signs before project completion if
 construction activities required removal of existing milepost signs.
 1.
 Reset sign location at original station of existing sign.
 a.
 Exceptions
 1)
 Prior physical limitations listed in this Section, Article
 3.17, paragraph A were removed during construction
 and no longer prevent installation of a sign at the
 actual mile point.
 2)
 Roadside conditions or newly constructed physical
 limitations would prevent reestablishment of milepost
 sign within 3 ft of its original station.
 b.
 Contact the Engineer to determine how to proceed in either
 of these special cases in coordination with the Highway
 Referencing Specialist.
 2.
 Establish an appropriate offset for each milepost sign to meet
 installation and clear zone requirements.
 
 C.
 
 Contact the Engineer to determine the preferred action for reestablishing
 the milepost signs where the alignment of the roadway was modified
 during construction to the extent that the new measured mile point
 locations of milepost signs were shifted more than 10 ft from their original
 location.

 with the following exceptions:
 a.
 Compute incentive/disincentive using the test results from
 three samples if only three samples can be taken for the
 production day.
 b.
 Combine test results with the next day of production if at
 least three random samples cannot be taken. Take one
 sample for each 500 tons, or portion thereof, from the
 following day’s production.
 c.

 Thickness Requirements
 a.
 The Department accepts a lot for thickness when:
 1)
 The average thickness is not more than ½ inch
 greater or ¼ inch less than the total design thickness
 specified.
 2)
 No individual sublot shows a deficient thickness of
 more than ⅜ inch.
 b.
 Excess Thickness – The Engineer may allow excess
 thickness to remain in place or may order its removal.
 1)
 The Department pays for 50 percent of the mix for
 material in excess of the +½ inch tolerance when
 excess thickness is allowed to remain in place.
 2)
 Remove and replace the entire depth of the course if
 it is necessary to remove portions of the course.
 c.
 Deficient Thickness – Place additional material where lots or
 sublots are deficient in thickness.
 1)
 The Department pays for material necessary to reach
 specified thickness.
 2)
 The Department pays for 50 percent of the mix for
 additional material over specified thickness necessary
 to achieve minimum lift thickness.
 3)
 Minimum compacted lift is 3 times the nominal
 maximum aggregate size.
 d.
 Thickness tolerances established above do not apply to
 leveling courses.
 1)
 Check final surfaces in stage construction.
 e.
 Thickness acceptance for thin overlay pavement consists of
 checking thickness regularly with a depth probe during
 placement and taking corrective action as necessary.
 
 The Department applies incentive/disincentive for Gradation/Asphalt
 Content, and In-Place Density. The Engineer computes
 Incentive/Disincentive for each lot.
 1.
 Compute incentive/disincentive for Gradation/Asphalt Binder and
 In-place Density according to Table 1.
 2.
 Base the incentive/disincentive on Percent within Limit (PT)
 computation using Tables 2, 3, and 4.

 Table 5
 Definitions, Abbreviations, and Formulas for Acceptance
 Term
 
 Explanation
 
 Target Value (TV)
 
 The target values for gradation and asphalt binder content are given in
 the CONTRACTOR’s mix design. The target value for density is 94.0
 percent of maximum (Rice) density.
 
 Average (AVE)
 
 The sum of the lot’s test results for a measured characteristic divided
 by the number of test results, the arithmetic mean.
 
 Standard Deviation (s)
 
 The square root of the value formed by summing the squared
 difference between the individual test results of a measured
 characteristic and AVE, divided by the number of test results minus
 one. This statement does not limit the methods of calculations of s;
 other methods that obtain the same value may be used.
 
 Upper Limit (UL)
 
 The value above the TV of each measured characteristic that defines
 the upper limit of acceptable production. (Table 3)
 
 Lower Limit (LL)
 
 The value below the TV of each measured characteristic that defines
 the lower limit of acceptable production (Table 3)
 
 Upper Quality Index (QU)
 
 QU = (UL - AVE)/s
 
 Lower Quality Index (QL)
 
 QL = (AVE - LL)/s
 
 Percentage of Lot Within UL
 (PU)
 
 Determined by entering Table 4 with QU.
 
 Percentage of Lot Within LL
 (PL)
 
 Determined by entering Table 4 with QL.
 
 Total Percentage of Lot (PL)
 Within UL and LL (PT)
 
 PT = (PU + PL) - 100
 
 Incentive/Disincentive
 
 Determined by entering Table 1 with PT or PL.
 
 Values for AVE, s, QU, and QL will be calculated to a minimum two decimal place
 accuracy that will be carried through all further calculations. Rounding to lower
 accuracy is not allowed.

 continues indicating the changes in production procedures that will be
 implemented to correct the deficiencies.
 1.
 Address the specific issues contributing to the cease production
 directive.
 2.
 The Engineer must approve the revised plan before production
 continues.
 
 C.
 
 The Engineer may require a new mix design.
 
 SURFACE PREPARATION
 A.
 
 Locate, reference, and protect all utility covers, monuments, curb and
 gutter, and other components affected by the paving operations.
 
 B.
 
 Remove all moisture, dirt, sand, leaves, and other objectionable material
 from the prepared surface before placing the mix.
 
 C.
 
 Allow sufficient cure time for prime coat/tack coat before placing SMA.
 Refer to Section 02748.
 
 SURFACE PLACEMENT
 A.
 
 Provide a 3:1 (horizontal to vertical) sloped edge adjacent to the next lane
 to be paved when full-width or echelon paving is impractical and more
 than one pass is required.

 3.6
 
 B.
 
 Construct the longitudinal joint to within 6 inches of the lane lines or at the
 center of the lane at the direction of the Engineer, but never in a wheel
 path.
 1.
 Core and test all longitudinal joints for compaction according to the
 specification if the lift is 2 or more inches thick.
 2.
 Verify all edges of the adjacent areas to through lanes have straight
 and uniform longitudinal lines and neat vertical edges.
 3.
 Fill core holes with SMA mix and compact.
 
 C.
 
 Adjust the production of the mixing plant and material delivery until a
 steady paver speed is maintained.
 
 D.
 
 Do not allow construction vehicles, general traffic, or rollers to pass over
 the uncompacted end or edge of freshly placed mix until the mat
 temperature drops to a point where damage or differential compaction will
 not occur.
 
 E.
 
 Taper the end of a course subjected to traffic at approximately 50:1
 (horizontal to vertical).
 1.
 Make a transverse joint by saw or wheel cutting and removing the
 portion of the pass that contains the tapered end.
 2.
 Tack the contact surfaces before fresh mix is placed against the
 compacted mix.
 
 F.
 
 Use a Material Transfer Vehicle (MTV) to apply all courses of SMA. Use
 an MTV that internally performs additional mixing of the SMA mix and then
 deposits material into the paver at a uniform temperature and consistency.
 1.
 Use other approved means to deposit material into the paver when
 an MTV is impractical, placements such as utility work, traffic
 signals, detours, lane leveling, and driveways, side street tie-ins,
 other hand work, or small projects with plan quantities less than
 500 tons.
 
 COMPACTION
 A.
 
 Use a small compactor or vibratory roller in addition to normal rolling at
 structures.
 
 B.
 
 Operate in a transverse direction next to the back wall and approach slab.
 
 C.
 
 Use a 9 ton (minimum) roller.

 3.7
 
 D.
 
 Roll surface immediately after placement staying as close as possible to
 the lay-down machine and assuring proper mix design placement
 temperatures.
 1.
 Minimize the use of vibratory rollers.
 
 E.
 
 Do not use full Pneumatic tire rollers.
 
 F.
 
 Discontinue vibration if aggregate breakdown occurs or if bleeding occurs.
 
 LIMITATIONS
 A.
 
 Do not place SMA on frozen base or subbase.
 
 B.
 
 Use a release agent that does not dissolve asphalt and is satisfactory to
 the Engineer for all equipment and hand tools used to mix, haul, and place
 the SMA.
 
 C.
 
 Do not place SMA during adverse climatic conditions such as precipitation
 or when roadway surface is icy or wet.
 
 D.
 
 Place SMA from April 15, to October 15, and when the air temperature in
 the shade and the roadway surface temperature are above 50 degrees F.
 1.
 The Department determines if it is feasible to place SMA outside
 these dates and temperature.
 2.
 Obtain authorization from the Engineer before paving outside these
 limits.

 DEFINITIONS
 A.
 
 Bonded Wearing Course (BWC) – A spray-paver applied surface
 treatment consisting of a warm Polymer-Modified Emulsion Membrane
 and an ultra-thin, gap-graded hot mix asphalt overlay. It is typically less
 than 1 inch thick. The hot mix asphalt surface course is placed
 immediately on the emulsion. A BWC is a homogeneous wearing surface
 and pavement seal that can be opened to traffic immediately after cooling.
 
 B.
 
 Polymer-Modified Emulsion Membrane (PMEM) – A warm, modified
 emulsion applied to the pavement to seal the underlying pavement and
 provide a strong bond to the surface course.
 
 C.
 
 Production Day – A 24 hour period in which BWC is being placed.
 
 SUBMITTALS
 A.
 
 Mix design data to the Engineer for review at least 14 calendar days
 before paving. Do not pave until mix design is authorized for use.
 1.
 Include all information on selection of design aggregate structure
 showing the target values of percent passing on all sieves listed in
 Table 9.
 2.
 Indicate the design asphalt binder content and the estimated
 asphalt binder film thickness.
 3.
 Provide test results verifying that proposed aggregate meets the
 requirements of Table 8.
 4.
 Indicate the target job mix gradation and supply QC data for the
 target selection.
 a.
 Use these target values for price adjustments.
 
 B.
 
 Lottman test data using Method A lime slurry for all sources. Refer to this
 Section, Article 2.5.
 1.
 Submit both A and B lime slurry data for new sources having no
 historic data.
 2.
 Meet minimum Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) of 80 percent.
 
 C.

 Clearly show placement of the longitudinal joints with respect to
 final pavement markings and meeting the requirements of this
 Section, Article 3.6, paragraph I.
 
 ACCEPTANCE
 A.
 
 Acceptance sampling and testing of material is according to UDOT
 Minimum Sampling and Testing Requirements.
 
 B.
 
 A lot equals the number of square yards placed during each production
 day.
 1.
 The lot may be increased to include up to three production days
 approved when daily production rates are anticipated to be less
 than 15,000 yd2.
 
 C.
 
 Incentive / Disincentive for Asphalt Binder Content and Gradation
 1.
 The Engineer evaluates a lot on the test results of four samples
 with the following exceptions:
 a.
 Compute Incentive/Disincentive using the test results from
 three samples if only three samples can be taken for the
 production day.
 b.
 Combine test results with the next day of production if at
 least three random samples cannot be taken. Take one
 sample for each 15,000 yd2, or portion thereof, from the
 following day’s production. Evaluate with the appropriate
 number of tests “n” in Table 4.
 c.
 Add the lot to the previous day’s production for the final
 day’s production if three random samples cannot be taken.
 d.
 Evaluate with the appropriate number of tests “n” in Table 4.
 2.
 The Engineer informs the Contractor of the time and place of
 sampling not more than 15 minutes before the sampling.
 a.
 Samples taken will be sufficiently large to allow for repeat
 testing according to Section 01456.
 b.
 Retained material for repeat testing will be immediately
 stored by the Engineer until the represented lots are
 accepted.
 3.
 Compute Incentive/Disincentive for binder content per lot based on
 Table 1 using the single test result with the largest deviation from
 the target.
 4.
 Incentive/Disincentive for gradation is based on Percent within
 Limits (PT) computation using Table 2, 3, 4, and 5.
 5.
 The Department will reject the lot if the PT is less than 60 percent.
 6.
 Any lot rejected based on gradation or binder content will not be
 eligible for any incentive.

 Explanation
 The target values for gradation and asphalt binder content
 are given in the Contractor’s volumetric mix design.
 The sum of the lot’s test results for a measured
 characteristic divided by the number of test results, the
 arithmetic mean.
 The square root of the value formed by summing the
 squared difference between the individual test results of a
 measured characteristic and AVE divided by the number of
 test results minus one. This statement does not limit the
 methods of calculations of s. Other methods that obtain
 the same value may be used.
 The value above the TV of each measured characteristic
 that defines the upper limit of acceptable production.
 (Table 2)
 The value below the TV of each measured characteristic
 that defines the lower limit of acceptable production

 DEFINITIONS
 A.
 
 Inlet and outlet pipes – The terms inlet pipes and outlet pipes are
 synonymous with vents, drains, injection, ejection, or inlet/outlet ports.
 Inlet and outlet pipes are devices connected to the PT system used for the
 injection of materials into or the ejection of materials from inside the ducts.
 
 B.
 
 Jacking force – The force applied to the tendon before anchorage and the
 occurrence of losses, including the anchor set loss.
 
 C.
 
 Permanent force – The force remaining in the prestressing steel after all
 losses, including long term creep and shrinkage of concrete, elastic
 shortening of concrete, relaxation of steel, losses in prestressing steel due
 to sequence of stressing, friction, unintended wobble of ducts, anchor set,
 friction in anchorages, and all other losses particular to the method or
 system of prestressing have taken place or have been provided for.
 
 D.
 
 Torpedo – A rigid object sized to fit through undamaged post-tensioning
 ducts. Used to prove that installed ducts have not been blocked or
 damaged during the concrete pour.

 Preload tendons to 20 percent of their final jacking force before
 beginning elongation readings to eliminate take-up in the tensioning
 system.
 Mark each strand before final stressing to permit measurement of
 elongation and to verify that all anchor wedges set properly.
 The measured elongation must agree within 7 percent of the
 theoretical elongation for the post-tensioned elements to verify the
 required tendon force, or the entire operation must be checked and
 the source of the error determined and remedied to the satisfaction
 of the Department before proceeding with the work.
 a.
 Do not overstress the tendon to achieve the theoretical
 elongation.
 b.
 Acceptance may be achieved by force verification lift-off
 tests demonstrating that the measured force is within minus
 1 percent and plus 5 percent of the required force as shown
 if the measured elongations fall outside of the acceptable
 tolerance.
 Do not cut off the stressing tails of the tendons until the elongations
 have been approved by the PT system manufacturer’s
 representative. Within 4 hours of approval:

 within 10 calendar days after protective packaging has been
 opened will not be cause for rejection.
 2.
 Prestressing steel installed, tensioned, and grouted within 10
 calendar days will not require the use of corrosion inhibitor in the
 duct following installation of the prestressing steel.
 a.
 Blow a vapor phase corrosion inhibitor powder conforming to
 MIL-PRF-3420 into ducts containing prestressing steel if
 prestressing steel is anticipated to be removed from
 protective packaging for 10 days or more before grouting.
 3.
 Do not exceed 15 calendar days between removal of prestressing
 steel from protective packaging and grouting operations.
 a.
 Failure to begin grouting operations will result in stoppage of
 work.

 Approach Slab – A structural slab that is designed to span from the rear
 face of the abutment to the sleeper slab. The purpose of approach slabs
 is to span over potential settlement of the bridge abutment backfill. The
 soil under the slab is not intended to support the slab. Support is provided
 by the bridge abutment and the sleeper slab.
 
 B.
 
 Sleeper Slab – A structural slab that is designed as a transition from the
 approach slab to the approach roadway pavement. The sleeper slab
 bears directly on the subgrade and supports the end of the approach slab.
 The expansion joint between the sleeper slab and the approach slab is
 used to accommodate the thermal movement of the bridge.

 TESTING
 A.
 
 After installation but before terminating test each conductor for insulation
 integrity to adjacent conductors and ground using 1000VDC
 megohmmeter.
 1.
 Record insulation resistance in megohms after 30 seconds and 60
 seconds (R30 and R60).
 2.
 Calculate polarization index by dividing the 60 second resistance by
 the 30 second resistance (R60 / R30).
 3.
 Replace any conductors with a polarization index value less than
 1.4.
 
 B.
 
 Measure transformer secondary voltage while loaded to final load and
 record voltage and submit for information.
 
 C.
