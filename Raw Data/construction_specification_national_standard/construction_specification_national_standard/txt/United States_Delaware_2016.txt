 101.01 General. The titles and headings of the Sections and subparts of Sections are intended for reference and are
 not to be used to interpret the Specifications. When the Contract references a publication, the reference applies to
 the most recent date of issue as of the date bids are advertised, including interim publications, unless the reference
 includes a specified date or year.
 Portions of these Specifications are written in the imperative mood. In sentences using imperative mood, the subject
 "the Contractor" is implied. Also implied in the language are "shall" or "shall be" or similar words and phrases. In
 all instances where "the Contractor" and "shall" or "shall be" are implied, the actions specified are solely the
 responsibility of the Contractor. In the referenced Material Sections, the subject may also be a vendor, fabricator,
 manufacturer, or combination thereof, who may be supplying the Material, products, or Equipment for the Project.
 Prior to the Execution of the Contract, the implied subject of a sentence using the imperative mood is either “the
 Bidder” or “the prospective Bidder”. The word "will" generally applies to decisions or actions of the Department or
 Engineer.
 In the Contract, the following words: contemplated, required, determined, directed, specified, authorized, ordered,
 given, designated, indicated, considered necessary, deemed necessary, permitted, reserved, suspended, established,
 approval, approved, disapproved, acceptable, unacceptable, suitable, satisfactory, unsatisfactory, sufficient,
 insufficient, rejected, condemned, or words with similar intent; mean by or to the Department.
 In the Contract, the words "or equal", referring to a product, Material, or process, mean "equal as determined by the
 Engineer".
 The Specifications may present numerical values in both U.S. customary units (English) and metric units. The Plans
 will only use one of the two systems. Work entirely within the system set forth in the Plans and do not convert
 between the two systems. The relationship between the U.S. customary values and the metric values within these
 Specifications is neither an exact (hard) conversion nor a completely rationalized (soft) conversion.

 102.01 Registration of Bidders. Obtain registration status prior to submitting a Proposal. In order to obtain
 registration status, provide the Department with the information requested on the registration form provided by the
 Department.
 Upon receipt of this information, the prospective Bidder will be listed on the Department's registry. Provide the
 Department on a continuous basis any changes to the information contained in the registry. Failure to provide
 current information may result in the loss of bidding privileges.
 102.02 Contents of the Bid Proposal. The Bid Proposal will state the location and description of the contemplated
 Work, show the estimate of the various Pay Item quantities, and show the kinds of Work to be performed and/or
 Materials to be furnished. A Schedule of Items for which Unit Prices are invited will be included along with the
 specified Contract Time in which the Work must be completed, amount of the Proposal Guaranty, and the date,
 time, and place of the opening of Bid Proposals. If the basis of Bid Proposal comparisons by the Department is to
 be other than total cost, the comparison basis to be used will be defined. The Bid Proposal will also include or
 designate any Addenda, Special Provisions, and any other specifications or requirements that vary from or are not
 contained in the Standard Specifications.
 All papers bound with or attached to the Bid Proposal are part of the Proposal. The Plans, Specifications, and other
 documents incorporated by reference in the Bid Proposal are part of the Proposal whether attached or not.
 102.03 Issuance of the Bid Proposal. Potential Bidders must contact the Department in order to receive the Bid
 Proposal in electronic format. The Department does not provide printed Bid Proposals; bidders are able to print
 from the electronic format. The Bid Proposal is also available on the internet at the state’s Bid Solicitation
 Directory; however, the Website Bid Proposal is not valid for submitting bids and the Website documents are
 marked as such. The Department does provide a printed set of plans and specifications for viewing in the Bidder’s
 Room at the DelDOT Administration Building in Dover. The Department will furnish a Bid Proposal to each
 prospective bidder. The Department reserves the right to refuse to issue a Bid Proposal to a Bidder for any of the
 reasons stated in Section 102.12.
 All Addenda are posted on the internet at the State’s Bid Solicitation Directory and are included by reference in the
 Bid Proposal. The Bidder is responsible to check the website as needed to ensure that the Bidder is aware of
 Addenda that are included in the Bid Proposal. If Addenda are issued, the final Addendum will be posted no later
 than the end of the day two working days prior to the bid date. Each Addendum number and date must be entered
 on the submitted Certification Form.
 102.04 Interpretation of Quantities in the Bid Proposal Form. The quantities appearing in the Bid Proposal
 Form are estimates used for the bid comparison. Payment to the Contractor will be made for the actual quantities of
 Work performed and accepted, or for Materials furnished in accordance with the Contract. The estimated quantities
 of Work to be performed and Materials to be furnished may be increased, decreased, or eliminated in their entirety.
 102.05 Examination of Plans, Specifications, Bid Proposal, and Site of Work. Examine the site of the proposed
 Work, the Bid Proposal, and all Items designated in the Bid Proposal before submitting a Proposal. The Bidder
 
 102-1
 
 BIDDING REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS
 
 SECTION 102
 
 assumes responsibility for all site conditions that should have been discovered had a reasonable site investigation
 been performed, whether or not the Bidder actually performed the investigation. The submission of a Proposal will
 be considered conclusive evidence that the Bidder is aware of and accepts the conditions to be encountered in
 performing the Work and the requirements of the proposed Contract.
 Boring logs and other records of subsurface investigations, when such investigations have been performed, are
 available for inspection by Bidders. It is understood that such information was obtained and used for Department
 design and estimating purposes only. The information is made available to Bidders so that all Bidders have access
 to subsurface information identical to that available to the Department and to other Bidders, and such information is
 not intended as a substitute for the personal investigation, interpretations, and judgment of the Bidders.
 The Department will not be bound by any statements or representations concerning site conditions or descriptions of
 the Work unless they are included or designated in the Bid Proposal. Oral explanations or instructions given before
 the bid of the Contract by Department employees or agents will not be binding.
 Submit any request for explanation of the meaning or interpretation of the Bid Proposal or Items designated in the
 Bid Proposal in writing to the Department’s e-mail address listed in the Bid Proposal no less than six business Days
 prior to the Proposal opening date. Interpretations or explanations made by the Department in response to questions
 asked by prospective Bidders will be dated and posted periodically on Delaware’s Bid Solicitation Directory
 Website. The final questions and answers document will be posted on the Website no later than the end of the day
 two business Days prior to the bid date. The final posted date must be entered on the submitted Certification Form.
 All questions and answers posted by the Department on the Website are included in the Contract by reference and
 become part of the Bid Proposal. The Bidder to whom the Contract is Awarded will receive a hard copy of the final
 posted questions and answers.
 102.06 Preparation of the Proposal. Submit the Proposal either upon the Bid Proposal Forms, or upon approved
 electronic media as directed by the Contract Documents. When using approved electronic media to submit bids,
 provide both the electronic copy and a hard copy of the bid unless otherwise directed by the Proposal. Detach the
 Bid Proposal Forms from the Bid Proposal. Specify a Unit Price in figures for each Contract Item for which a
 quantity is given and show the product of the respective Unit Price and quantities typewritten or electronically
 printed in figures in the column provided. The total amount of the Proposal is to be obtained by adding the amounts
 of the several Contract Items. Type or print the figures onto the form. In case of a discrepancy between the
 typewritten Unit Prices and the typewritten or electronically printed bid amount, the Department will use the
 typewritten or electronically printed Unit Prices. In case of a discrepancy between the Unit Prices contained on the
 approved electronic media and the Unit Prices on the hard copy generated by the electronic medium, the Department
 will use the hard copy Unit Prices.
 Execute last minute handwritten substitutions of the typewritten or electronically printed Unit Prices on the
 typewritten Bid Proposal Forms or hard copy generated by the approved electronic media by striking a single line
 through the figure being substituted and legibly writing the new Unit Price in ink. Initial each last minute
 substitution. Legibility of the substitution will be solely determined by the Department.

 Bid Bond need not be for a specific sum, but may be stated to be for a sum equal to 10 percent of the bid to which it
 relates and not to exceed a certain stated sum, if said sum is equal to at least 10 percent of the bid. "Securities"

 writing or in person with proper identifications before the time set for receipt of Proposals. When the Proposals
 have been read, any low Bidder may withdraw any other unopened Proposal which it may have submitted for
 another Contract.
 Any Bidder exercising the privilege of so withdrawing its Bid or Bids waives all Claims that may arise should it be
 found that its opened Proposal is irregular or, for any reason, is unacceptable to the Department.
 102.11 Public Opening of Proposals. Proposals will be opened and read publicly at the place and time set for the
 opening of the Proposal by the Department.

 103.01 Consideration of Bids. After the Proposals are opened and read, the Department will compare the
 Proposals on the basis of the summation of the products of the quantities and the Unit Prices unless otherwise
 defined in the Bid Proposal. The results of the comparison will be available to the public upon Award of the
 Contract. In the event of a discrepancy between Unit Prices and extensions, the Unit Prices govern. The
 Department reserves the right to reject Proposals, waive technicalities, proceed to perform the Work otherwise, or
 advertise for new Proposals. Unit Bid Prices may also be affected by maximum price provisions noted elsewhere in
 the Contract Documents. In such cases, upon discovery of a discrepancy, the Department will adjust the Unit Bid
 Price to conform to the maximum permissible Bid Price.
 103.02 Award of the Contract. The Award of the Contract will be made within 30 Days after the opening of the
 Proposals to the Responsible Bidder who submits the lowest Responsive Proposal. The successful Bidder will be
 notified by letter or electronic means of the acceptance of the Proposal and the Award of the Contract. By mutual
 consent, the Department and the lowest Responsible Bidder can agree to extend the time within which the
 Department may make an Award.
 103.03 Cancellation of an Award. The Department reserves the right to cancel the Award of any Contract before
 execution without liability.
 103.04 Return of the Proposal Security. Proposal securities, except that of the lowest Bidder, will be returned

 Bond has been furnished and the Contract has been executed. A Contractor will not be released from the obligations
 to provide a satisfactory Performance Bond and execute the Contract because of an alleged error in the preparation
 of the Proposal unless the Department retains the Proposal Guaranty.
 103.05 Performance and Payment Bonds. Simultaneous with the execution of the Contract, furnish a Surety Bond
 or Bonds in a sum equal to 100 percent of the Contract price to the State. The Bond shall be for the benefit of the
 Department, as well as for the use and benefit of the Division of Revenue of the State in the case of Claims under
 this Bond for any and all taxes due to the State. Have the Bond issued by a corporate Surety authorized to do
 business in this State.
 On a form provided by the Department, obtain a release from the Division of Revenue indicating that all tax
 obligations for the Division of Revenue have been satisfied. Present this form to the Department as a condition for
 the release of Bond.
 The Bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful compliance and performance by the successful Bidder of each and
 every term and condition of the Contract, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Contract, including the
 payment in full to every person furnishing Material or performing labor or services in the performance of the
 Contract, and of all sums of money due the furnish or for such labor, services, or Material. The Bond shall also
 contain the successful Bidder's guarantee to indemnify and save harmless the State, the Department and the
 Department’s employees from all costs, damages, and expenses growing out of or by reason of the successful
 Bidder's failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations and failure to perform the Work and complete the
 Contract in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Contract.

 AWARD AND EXECUTION OF CONTRACT
 
 SECTION 103
 
 The Bond shall provide that every person furnishing Materials or performing labor for the successful Bidder under
 the Contract may maintain an action on the Bond for its own use in the name of the State in any court of competent
 jurisdiction, for recovery of such sum or sums of money as may be due the person from the successful Bidder.
 The form of such Bond will be provided by the Department. The Surety must also be acceptable to the Department.
 103.06 Withdrawal of a Bid. If, at any time after the acceptance of bids by the Department and before full
 execution of the Contract, the low Bidder determines a need to withdraw its bid, put the request in writing to the
 Department's representative stating its reason(s) for such withdrawal. The Department reserves the right to
 accept/reject the Bidder's request to withdraw upon review of the merits. The Department reserves the right to retain
 the Bid Bond or certified check in full or in part as Liquidated Damages. The Department may then proceed to the
 next lowest Responsive Bidder, or reject all Proposals and re-advertise for new Proposals.
 103.07 Execution and Approval of the Contract; Proof of Insurance. Return the signed Contract and Contract
 Bond to the Department within 20 Days after the notice that the Contract has been Awarded. If the Contract is not
 executed by the Department within 15 Days following receipt of the signed Contracts and Bonds, the Bidder has the
 right to withdraw the bid without penalty or liability. The Contract will not be considered effective until it has been
 fully executed by all parties to the Contract.
 If the successful Bidder is a non-resident corporation, provide proof of compliance with the requirements of
 Subchapter XVI of Title 8 of the Delaware Code, and as further amended at the time of bid.
 Maintain insurance in compliance with the requirements of Sections 2502 and 2503, Title 18 of the Delaware Code.

 the Contractor to provide coverage for additional insureds, provide proof of additional insureds. The Department
 will not execute the Contract until an acceptable proof of insurance is provided.
 103.08 Failure to Execute a Contract. Failure by the successful Bidder to execute the Contract and file an
 acceptable Bond within 20 Days after the Notice of Award will be considered a revocation of the Notice of Award
 and a forfeiture of the Proposal Guaranty to the Department. Contract Award may then be made to the next lowest
 Responsible and Responsive Bidder or the Work may be re-Advertised.

 that nothing in the escrowed Bid Documents shall change or modify the Contract.
 E. Contents and Form of the Escrowed Documents. Clearly itemize in the escrowed Bid Documents the
 estimated costs of performing each aspect of the Work required by the Contract Documents. Separate all
 Work into sub-items as required to present a complete and detailed estimate of all costs. Detail all crews,
 Equipment, quantities and rates of production. Further divide estimates of costs into the Contractor’s usual
 cost categories such as direct labor, repair labor, Equipment ownership and operation, expendable Material,
 permanent Material, and subcontract costs. Clearly identify allocations of plant and Equipment, indirect
 costs, contingencies, markup, and other items to each direct cost item. Include all assumptions, quantity
 takeoffs, rates of production and progress calculations, quotes from Subcontractors and suppliers,
 memoranda, narratives and all other information used by the Contractor to arrive at the Bid Price for the
 Contract.
 Submit the escrowed Bid Documents in the format actually used by the Contractor in preparing the
 Proposal. The Department does not intend for the Contractor to perform any extraordinary Work in the
 preparation of these documents prior to the Proposal due date. However, the Contractor represents and
 warrants that the escrowed Bid Documents related to the Proposal have been personally examined prior to
 delivery to escrow by an authorized officer of the Contractor and that such documents meet the

 Changes to the Contract. The Department may require all documentary information used in preparation of
 the quotation of prices for Additional or Extra Work performed on the Contract. If required, the Engineer

 requirements of this Specification.
 
 G. Availability for Review. The escrowed Bid Documents shall be available for joint review by the
 Department and the Contractor for the resolution of disputes and the negotiations of changes to the
 Contract. The Department will be entitled to review all or any part of the escrowed Bid Documents in
 order to determine the applicability of the individual documents to the matter at issue. The Department will
 be entitled to make and retain copies of such documents as it deems appropriate in connection with any
 such matters, provided that the Department has executed and delivered to the Contractor a confidentiality
 agreement specifying that all proprietary information contained in such documents will be kept
 confidential; that copies of such documents will not be distributed to any third parties other than the
 Department’s agents, attorneys, auditors, and experts who are aiding the Department in resolving the issue
 at hand; and that all documents and copies of documents will be returned to the depository upon resolution

 limitation on the Department’s discovery rights with respect to such documents.
 H. Confidentiality of Bid Documentation. The escrowed Bid documents are and shall always remain the
 property of the Contractor subject to the Department’s right to review them as provided herein. The
 Department acknowledges that the Contractor may consider that the escrowed Bid Documents constitute
 trade secrets or proprietary information. The Department further acknowledges that the Contractor
 expended money in developing the information included in the escrowed Bid Documents and that it would
 be difficult for a competitor to replicate the information contained therein. The Department acknowledges
 that the escrowed Bid Documents and the information contained therein are being provided to the
 Department only because it is an express prerequisite to execute this Contract. Thus, the escrowed Bid
 Documents will at all times be treated as proprietary and confidential information and will be used only for
 the purposes described herein. At the Contractor’s request, confidentiality agreements will be executed and
 delivered to the Contractor by the Department’s employees or agents who review or have access to the
 escrowed Bid Documents.
 I.
 
 Refusal or Failure to Provide Bid Documentation and Review by the Department. Failure to provide Bid
 Documentation will render the Proposal non-Responsive and the Contractor shall forfeit the Proposal
 Guaranty in accordance with Section 103.08. The Department may, at any time, conduct a review of the
 escrowed Bid Documents to determine whether they are complete. In the event the Department determines
 that any data is missing, provide such data within three Working Days of the request and at that time it will
 be date stamped, labeled to identify it as supplementary material, and added to the escrowed Bid
 Documents. The Contractor shall have no right to add documents to the escrowed Bid Documents except
 upon the Department’s request.
 
 J.
 
 Cost and Escrow Instructions. The costs for complying with this Section are incidental to the Contract.
 The cost of the storage of Bid Documents will be borne by the Department. The Department will provide
 escrow instructions to the document depository consistent with this Section.

 104.01 Intent of the Contract. Cooperate with the Engineer to complete the Work described in a manner that is
 safe and poses the least practicable impact to the flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Furnish all labor,
 Materials, Equipment, tools, transportation, and supplies required to complete the Work in accordance with the
 Contract. Perform all alterations to the Contract or requests for Extra Work from the Engineer in accordance with
 the terms of the Contract.
 104.02 Existing Signs. Inventory all existing signs (i.e., Traffic, Bus Stops, Street Names, etc.) within the limits of
 the Contract with the Engineer prior to commencing the Work. Maintain necessary traffic signs as directed by the
 Engineer during construction, and properly store all other signs. Return all stored signs to the Engineer at the end of
 the Project. The Contractor is responsible for any loss of, or damage to, stored signs throughout the duration of the
 Project.
 104.03 Bus Stops. Maintain bus stops as prescribed in Section 801.
 104.04 Material Testing Notification. For Portland Cement Concrete and Bituminous Concrete material testing,
 the Contractor must notify the Materials & Research Section of the quantity and time of the scheduled release by
 3:00 P.M. the business day prior.
 No Portland Cement Concrete or Bituminous Concrete materials shall be shipped to the job without first being
 released by the DelDOT Inspector. When DelDOT releases materials for shipment, DelDOT does not guaranty that
 the materials meet the specifications or are suitable for use. The Contractor is solely responsible for the suitability
 of the materials shipped. DelDOT may waive the release requirements on a case by case basis. Waivers of releases
 by DelDOT do not waive the release requirements for future shipments.
 104.05 Accident Notification. Immediately notify DelDOT’s Transportation Management Center (TMC) at 302659-4600 and the Engineer’s site representative of any incidents resulting in damage to property or personal injury
 occurring within the limits of the Project.
 104.06 Contract Revisions, Changes in the Character of the Work and Major and Minor Items. The
 Department reserves the right at any time prior to the Completion of the Contract to issue plan revisions, make
 adjustments in Contract Item quantities, or make such other alterations considered necessary to satisfactorily
 complete the Contract. Perform the revised Work immediately upon receiving direction from the Engineer to do so.
 The Engineer will pay for the revised Work at the Contract Unit Prices unless the revision results in a change to the
 character of the Work as defined below. In the case of a change to the character of the Work, the Engineer may
 
 104-1
 
 SCOPE OF WORK
 
 SECTION 104
 
 revise the Contract as specified in Section 109.04. If the determination that the character of the Work has changed is
 based solely upon Section 104.06.A.2, the change to the Unit Price applies only to that portion in excess of 125
 percent of the original Contract Quantity, or in the case of a decrease below 75 percent, to the actual amount of
 Work performed under the Item.
 Payment for Contract revisions or changes in the character of the Work will exclude any amount for loss of
 anticipated profits alleged to result from the change. Changes to the Contract do not invalidate the Contract or
 release the Contract Surety. If, as a result of such changes, the Contractor requires additional time to complete the
 Work, request an extension of Contract Time. The Engineer will evaluate such a request and will grant an extension
 of Contract Time if the request is justifiable in accordance with Section 108.07. All Contract revisions will be
 issued in writing by the Engineer.
 A. If the Engineer alters Contract quantities, the Work, or both as necessary to satisfactorily complete the
 Project, such an alteration changes the character of the Work if:
 1.
 
 The alteration requires the Contractor’s means and methods in performing the Work to differ
 materially in kind or nature from that involved or included in the original Contract; or
 
 2.
 
 The alteration causes the quantity of a Major Item, as defined in Section 101.03, to increase in excess
 of 125 percent or decrease below 75 percent of the original Contract Quantity.
 
 104.07 Differing Site Conditions. If Differing Site Conditions, as defined by Section 101.03, are encountered at
 the Project site, promptly notify the Engineer as specified in Section 104.09. Stop Work in the affected area and
 preserve the evidence of the alleged Differing Site Conditions so that the Engineer can investigate whether the
 conditions differ materially from those that the Contractor reasonably should have expected as defined in Section
 101.03. Do not proceed with the Work in the affected area until the Engineer provides written notification to
 continue.
 If the Engineer determines that the conditions differ materially from those that the Contractor should have
 reasonably expected as defined by Section 101.03, and such Differing Site Conditions caused an increase or
 decrease in the cost or time required for the Contractor to perform the Work, a written Adjustment will be made to
 the Contract by the Engineer. Adjustments in the Contract price for Differing Site Conditions will be made under
 Section 109.04, and Adjustments in Contract Time for Differing Site Conditions will be made under Section 108.07.
 No Adjustments in Contract Price will include loss of anticipated profits. The Engineer will notify the Contractor
 whether or not an Adjustment of the Contract is warranted.
 No Contract Adjustment resulting in a benefit to the Contractor will be allowed unless the Contractor has provided
 the required written notice as specified in Section 104.09 and has afforded the Engineer an opportunity to investigate
 the alleged Differing Site Conditions before further disturbing the affected area.
 104.08 Suspension of Work. The Engineer may suspend the Work in whole or in part by written order to the
 Contractor for any reason or condition that would be in the best interest of the Department. Immediately comply
 with the written order of the Engineer to suspend the Work.
 If the delay resulting from the written suspension order is unreasonable, submit a written request for a Contract
 Adjustment to the Engineer within seven Calendar Days of the Engineer’s order to resume Work providing the
 reasons and justification for the Adjustment. If:
 A. An increase in the Contract performance cost or time results from an unreasonable delay caused by the
 suspension; and
 B. The suspension was caused by conditions beyond the control and not the fault of the Contractor or those
 parties for whom the Contractor is responsible, then:
 Adjustments in the Contract price, excluding profit, will be made according to Section 109.04 and Adjustments to
 Contract Time will be made according to Section 108.07. The Engineer will not adjust the Contract Time or price if
 the Work performance would have been suspended or delayed by any other cause under any other terms or
 
 104-2
 
 SCOPE OF WORK
 
 SECTION 104
 
 conditions of the Contract or if the Contractor fails to submit a request for an Adjustment to the Contract within the
 allowable time prescribed above.
 The Engineer may suspend the Work when the Contractor fails to perform any provisions of the Contract. In such a
 case, the Engineer will neither adjust the Contract Time nor price nor will the Engineer pay for traffic control
 devices or maintenance of traffic during the suspension period. The Engineer will order the Work to resume when
 conditions are favorable as determined by the Engineer.
 104.09 Notification Requirements for Differing Site Conditions, Changes in the Character of the Work and
 Extra Work. Immediately notify the Engineer of alleged changes to the Contract due to Differing Site Conditions;
 Extra Work; altered Work beyond the scope of the Contract; any delay that is compensable under the terms and
 conditions of the Contract; and/or action(s) or lack of action(s) taken by the Department that have allegedly changed
 the Contract terms and conditions.
 A. No further Work is to be performed or Contract costs incurred on the change after the date the change
 occurs unless directed otherwise by the Engineer.
 B. Within seven Days of the initial notification, provide the following information to the Engineer in writing:
 1.
 
 The date of occurrence and the nature and circumstances of the occurrence that constituted the alleged
 change.
 
 2.
 
 The name, title, and activity of each Department representative knowledgeable of the alleged change.
 
 3.
 
 Copies or descriptions of any documents and the substance of any oral communications involved in the
 alleged change and the basis for an allegation of accelerated Schedule performance, if applicable.
 
 4.
 
 The basis for an allegation that the Work is not required by the Contract, if applicable.
 
 5.
 
 The particular elements of Contract performance for which additional compensation may be sought
 under this Section including:
 a.
 
 Contract Item(s) that have been or may be affected by the alleged change.
 
 b.
 
 Materials that were/will be added, deleted, or wasted by the alleged change and a list of
 Equipment that was/will be idled or required by the alleged change.
 
 c.
 
 Labor that was/will be forced to remain idle on the jobsite as a result of the alleged change.
 
 d.
 
 Delay and disruption to the manner and sequence of performance that has been or will be caused
 by the alleged change.
 
 e.
 
 Estimated Adjustments to Contract price(s), delivery schedule(s), staging, and Contract Time
 necessary due to the alleged change.
 
 f.
 
 Estimate of the time within which the Department must respond to the notice to minimize cost,
 delay, or disruption of performance.
 
 The failure of the Contractor to provide required notice in accordance with this Section shall constitute a waiver of
 any and all entitlement to Adjustments in the Contract price or Time as a result of the alleged change.
 C. Within ten Days after the receipt of notice, the Engineer will respond in writing to the Contractor to:
 1.
 
 Confirm that a change occurred and, when necessary, direct the method and manner of further
 performance; or
 
 2.
 
 Deny that a change occurred and, when necessary, direct the method and manner of further
 performance; or
 
 104-3
 
 SCOPE OF WORK
 3.
 
 SECTION 104
 
 Advise the Contractor that additional time is required to evaluate the allegation or that adequate
 information has not been submitted to decide whether 1. or 2. above applies, and indicate the needed
 information and date it is to be received by the Engineer for further review.
 
 Any Adjustments made to the Contract will not include increased costs or time extensions for delays resulting from
 the Contractor's failure to provide requested additional information in accordance with this Section.
 104.10 Maintaining Traffic. Keep all roads, driveways, entrances, sidewalks, trails and paths open to all vehicular,
 bicycle and pedestrian traffic during the construction unless otherwise specified in the Contract Documents. Submit
 a temporary traffic control plan for the Work at the preconstruction meeting. All temporary traffic control and
 temporary traffic control devices shall comply with the Contract Documents and with the latest edition of the
 Delaware Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), including all revisions as of the date of the
 Advertisement of the Contract. The MUTCD is available for download at www.mutcd.deldot.gov.
 104.11 Rights In and Use of Materials Found on the Work. The Engineer may authorize the Contractor's use of
 Materials found in the excavation. Payment will be made both for the excavation of such Materials at the
 corresponding Contract Unit Price and for the Contract Item for which the excavated Materials are used.
 Replace the removed Material if necessary with acceptable Material at no cost to the Department. Do not excavate
 or remove any Material that is not within grading limits without written authorization from the Engineer.
 104.12 Additional Utility Relocations Required by the Department; Restoration of Surfaces Opened by
 Permit. The right to construct or reconstruct any utility service in the highway or street or to grant permits to
 construct or reconstruct is, at any time during construction, hereby expressly reserved by the Department. The
 Contractor shall not be entitled to any damages for unauthorized digging or any delay occasioned thereby.
 Any individual, firm, or corporation wishing to make an opening in the highway must secure a permit from the
 Department. Allow parties bearing such permits and only those parties, to make openings in the highway. When
 ordered, make all necessary repairs due to such openings and such necessary Work will be paid for as Extra Work or
 as provided in the Contract and will be subject to the same Contract conditions as the original Work performed.
 104.13 Value Engineering Proposals by the Contractor. A Contractor may submit a request to modify the
 Contract Documents for the purpose of reducing the total cost and/or duration of Construction without reducing
 design capacity or the quality of the finished product. This request is called a Value Engineering Proposal (VEP).
 Any cost savings generated to the Contract as a result of a VEP offered by the Contractor and approved by the
 Department will be shared by the Contractor and the Department on a 50-50 basis. The purpose of a VEP is to
 encourage the use of the Contractor’s ingenuity and experience in recommending approaches and methods differing
 from existing Contract Specifications that will reduce the overall cost and/or time of the Project.
 Do not base Bid Prices on the anticipated approval of a VEP. If a VEP is rejected, complete the Work at the original
 Contract Bid Prices.
 If the Department determines that the time for response indicated in the submittal under B.5. below is insufficient
 for review, the Contractor will be promptly notified. Based on the additional time needed by the Department for
 review and the effect on the Contractor's Schedule occasioned by the added time, the Department will evaluate the
 need for a time extension to the Contract. The Contractor shall have no Claim against the Department for delays to
 the Contract based on the failure to respond within the time indicated in B.5. below if additional information is
 needed to complete the review. Until the proposal is accepted by the Department, remain obligated to the terms and
 conditions of the existing Contract.
 A. General Requirements. The Department will only consider VEP’s that could produce a savings in cost
 and/or time to the Department without impairing essential functions and characteristics of the facility,
 including but not limited to, service life, economy of operation, ease of maintenance, desired appearance,
 and safety.
 B. Submittal of a VEP. Submit the following materials and information with each VEP:
 1.
 
 A statement that the proposal is submitted as a VEP.
 
 104-4
 
 SCOPE OF WORK
 
 SECTION 104
 
 2.
 
 A description of the difference between the existing Contract and the proposed change, and the
 cooperative advantages and disadvantages of each, including effects on service life, economy of
 operations, ease of maintenance, desired appearance, and safety.
 
 3.
 
 A complete set of the Plans and Specifications showing the proposed revisions relative to the original
 Contract features and requirements.
 
 4.
 
 A complete analysis indicating the final estimated costs and quantities to be replaced by the VEP
 compared to the new costs and quantities generated by the VEP.
 
 5.
 
 A statement specifying the date by which a Change Order adopting the VEP must be executed to
 obtain the maximum cost reduction during the remainder of the Contract.
 
 6.
 
 A statement detailing the effect the VEP will have on the time for completing the Contract.
 
 7.
 
 A description of any previous use or testing of the VEP and the conditions and results. If the VEP was
 previously submitted on another Department project, indicate the date, Contract number, and the action
 taken by the Department.
 
 C. Conditions. A VEP will be considered only when all of the following requirements are met:
 1.
 
 The VEP, whether approved or not approved by the Department, applies only to the ongoing
 Contract(s) referenced in the VEP and becomes the property of the Department. Include no restrictions
 imposed by the Contractor on the use or disclosure of the VEP or information within the VEP by the
 Department. The Department retains the right to use any VEP or part thereof on other projects without
 obligation to the Contractor. This provision is not intended to deny rights provided by law with respect
 to patented materials or processes.
 
 2.
 
 If the Department is already considering certain revisions to the Contract or has approved certain
 changes in the Contract for general use that are subsequently incorporated in a VEP, the Department
 will reject the VEP and may proceed without obligation to the Contractor.
 
 3.
 
 Have no Claim against the Department for costs or delays due to the Department's rejection of a VEP,
 including but not limited to, development costs, loss of anticipated profits, increased material or labor
 costs.
 
 4.
 
 The Engineer will be the sole judge as to whether a VEP qualifies for consideration and evaluation. It
 may reject any VEP for any reason, including, but not limited to, that the VEP requires excessive time
 or costs to review, evaluate, or investigate, or that the VEP is not consistent with the Department's
 design policies and criteria for the Project.
 
 5.
 
 The Department will reject all or any portion of Work performed under an approved VEP if
 unsatisfactory results are obtained. The Department may direct the removal of such rejected Work and
 require the Contractor to proceed in accordance with the original Contract requirements without
 reimbursement for Work performed under the VEP, or for its removal. Where modifications to the
 VEP are approved to adjust to field conditions or other conditions, reimbursement will be limited to
 the total amount payable for the Work at the Contract Unit Bid Prices as if it were constructed under
 the original Contract requirements or, in the case of a time-only VEP, the total amount of the VEP.
 The rejection of unsatisfactory VEP Work or limitation of reimbursement for such Work shall not
 constitute the basis of any Claim against the Department for delays, delay costs, or for any other costs.
 Any changed conditions arising as a result of the acceptance of a VEP will not be considered as the
 basis for any Claim for additional compensation.
 
 6.
 
 Propose no Work containing experimental features; propose only proven features that have been used
 under similar or acceptable conditions on other projects or locations acceptable to the Department.
 
 7.
 
 A VEP will not be considered if equivalent options are already provided in the Contract. The VEP
 must be sufficient to warrant a review and processing.
 
 104-5
 
 SCOPE OF WORK
 
 SECTION 104
 
 8.
 
 A VEP proposing to change the type or thickness of the Pavement Structure will not be considered.
 
 9.
 
 Additional information needed to evaluate VEP will be provided in a timely manner. Untimely
 submittal of additional information will result in rejection of the VEP. Where design changes are
 proposed, the additional information could include results of field investigations and surveys, design
 computations, and field change sheets.
 
 D. Payment. If the VEP is accepted, the changes and payment will be authorized by a Change Order.
 Reimbursement will be made as follows:
 1.
 
 The changes will be incorporated into the Contract by changes in quantities of Unit Bid Items, and/or
 new agreed price Items, as appropriate, under the Contract.
 
 2.
 
 The cost of the Value Engineering Work as determined from the changes will be paid directly. In
 addition, the Department will pay the Contractor 50 percent of the savings to the Department as
 reflected by the difference between the cost of the revised Work and the cost of the related construction
 required by the original Contract computed at Contract Unit Bid Prices. If the VEP provides only a
 savings in time to the Department, there will be no sharing of savings between the Department and the
 Contractor.
 
 3.
 
 The Contractor's costs for development, design, and implementation of the VEP are not eligible for
 reimbursement.
 
 4.
 
 The Contractor may submit a VEP for an approved Subcontractor. Subcontractors may not submit a
 VEP except through the Contractor.
 
 104.14 Final Cleaning of Project Site; Maintenance and Cleanup of Staging Areas. Before the Final Inspection
 of the Project, clean all rubbish, excess Materials, temporary Structures and Equipment from the Project, any
 publicly owned borrow source used to complete the Work, and all areas affected by the Contractor in connection
 with the Work within the Right-Of-Way. Trim all surfaces and slopes, whether old or new, to the cross-section. Cut
 all grass and weeds that are taller than 6 inches, and leave all parts of the Work in an acceptable condition. The cost
 of the final cleanup is incidental to the Contract and no separate payment will be made.
 Install erosion and sediment control measures that comply with stormwater regulations for all staging areas to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer. Restore all areas used for staging operations upon Completion of the Work. Restore
 paved staging areas to their original condition. Restore unpaved staging areas by re-grading and placing topsoil,
 seed and mulch to the satisfaction of the Engineer. Perform all restoration Work in accordance with Sections 202
 and 908 of these Standard Specifications. All costs associated with restoration of staging areas and establishing an
 acceptable stand of grass are incidental to the Contract.
 104.15 Contractor's Responsibility for the Work. Retain sole and absolute responsibility for the Work and
 provide for the protection and safety of all agents and employees of state and federal agencies, Contractors,
 Subcontractors, suppliers, and members of the general public until Substantial Completion is achieved as defined in
 Section 101.03. In no case, including but not limited to, supervisory acts or administration of the Contract by the
 Engineer, will the Contractor be relieved of the responsibility to indemnify the Department pursuant to the
 provisions of the Contract.
 Rebuild, repair, restore, and make good all losses, injuries, or damage to any portion of the Work under the control
 of the Contractor and/or due to his/her fault or inactivity, at no cost to the Department. Rebuild, repair, restore, and
 make good all losses, injuries, or damage to any portion of the Work, not under the control of the Contractor, under
 agreed Unit Prices or as Extra Work under Section 109.04. "Items not under the control of the Contractor" shall be
 defined for purposes of this Section as Acts of God such as earthquakes, tidal waves, tornadoes, or hurricanes;
 catastrophic conditions such as hazardous waste materials spills, explosions, etc., or acts of the public enemy or of
 governmental authorities.
 In case of the suspension of Work, maintain responsibility for the Project and take such precautions as may be
 necessary to prevent damage to the Project, provide for normal drainage and normal traffic operations, and erect any
 necessary temporary Bridges, signs, or other facilities. During such period of suspension of Work, properly and
 continuously maintain in an acceptable growing condition all living Material in newly established plantings,
 104-6
 
 SCOPE OF WORK
 
 SECTION 104
 
 seedings, and soddings furnished under the Contract, and take adequate precautions to protect new tree growth and
 other vegetative growth against injury.
 104.16 Required Notifications for Disturbing Property and using Bridges. Give two weeks’ notice to property
 owners when any fixture, shrub, or other object must be removed from a Right-Of-Way or easement area. If the
 owner does not attempt to salvage this property within the two week period, remove it without further obligation.
 Before starting any Work that will change the loadings on an existing or proposed Bridge, inform the Engineer of
 the proposed loadings (axle spacing, axial loads, stockpiling and Equipment locations) including quantity of and
 type of construction Equipment and vehicles proposed for use. The loading that the Contractor’s Equipment will
 apply to the Bridge will be subject to the approval of the Engineer. The Engineer’s approval does not relieve the
 Contractor of its responsibility for the safe performance of the Work or from carrying out the Work in full
 accordance with the Plans and the requirements of the Specifications. If at any time the Contractor’s upcoming
 operations would result in a change to the loading and / or the location of the loading on a Bridge, submit the
 proposed loadings for approval by the Engineer prior to changing the loading. Perform no Work that will change
 the loadings on any Bridge within the Contract limits until the Engineer’s approval has been obtained. Review time
 will be in accordance with Section 105.04.

 105.01 Authority of the Engineer. The Engineer is the administrator of the Contract and not a supervisor of the
 Work. Perform all Work to the satisfaction of the Engineer, but maintain complete responsibility for the Work. The
 Engineer will decide all questions which may arise as to the quality and acceptability of Materials furnished and
 Work performed and as to the manner of performance and rate of progress of the Work; all questions which may
 arise as to the interpretation of the Plans and Specifications; all questions as to the acceptable fulfillment of the
 Contract on the part of the Contractor; all disputes and mutual rights between contractors; and all questions as to
 compensation. At the preconstruction meeting, the Engineer will determine and communicate to the Contractor the
 chain of command and the extent of authority Department personnel will have to make changes to the Contract
 during the life of the Contract.
 The Engineer has the authority to suspend the Work, wholly or in part, due to the failure of the Contractor to correct
 conditions unsafe for the general public; for failure to carry out provisions of the Contract; for failure to carry out
 orders; for such periods as may be deemed necessary due to conditions the Engineer considered unsuitable for the
 prosecution of the Work; or for any other condition or reason deemed to be in the public interest.
 The Engineer's authority to impose any Contract sanction, including suspension of the Work, withholding payments,
 or the like, will not relieve the Contractor of sole and absolute responsibility for the Project, performance of the
 Work, and the safety of workers and the general public. The Contractor saves the Department harmless pursuant to
 Section 107.10 for any violation, breach, or omission of the above Contract provision.
 105.02 Authority and Duties of Inspectors. Inspectors acting under the authority of the Engineer are
 administrators of the Contract and not supervisors of the Work. Inspectors employed by or designated by the
 Department are authorized to inspect all Work performed and all Material furnished by the Contractor. Such
 inspection may extend to all or any part of the Work and to the preparation, fabrication, or manufacture of the
 Materials to be used. The Inspector is not authorized to revoke, alter, or waive any requirements of the Plans or
 Specifications. The Inspector may call the attention of the Contractor to any failure of the Work or Materials to
 conform to the requirements of the Contract and will have the authority to reject Materials or suspend the Work until
 any questions at issue can be referred to and decided by the Engineer. Such inspection will not relieve the
 Contractor from the obligation to perform the Work in accordance with the requirements of the Contract.
 The Inspector will in no case act as foreman or perform other duties for the Contractor, nor interfere with the
 management of the Work by the Contractor. Any advice which the Inspector may give the Contractor shall in no
 way be construed as binding the Engineer in any way or releasing the Contractor from fulfilling all of the terms of
 the Contract.
 
 105-1
 
 CONTROL OF WORK
 
 SECTION 105
 
 The Engineer may issue a written order to the Contractor to stop Work giving the reason for shutting down the
 Work. After placing the order in the hands of the Contractor's representative in charge at the Project Site or sending
 an electronic copy of such an order to a responsible party in the Contractor’s organization, the Inspector will
 immediately leave the job, and in such cases Work performed by the Contractor during the absence of the Inspector
 will not be paid for and may not be accepted. The Engineer will identify the person(s) within the Department who
 have the authority to issue a Stop Work order at the preconstruction meeting for the Contract.
 105.03 Inspection of the Work. Allow the Engineer access to all parts of the Work at all times for inspection.
 Furnish information and assist the Engineer as required to make complete and detailed inspections. Inspection may
 include mill, plant, or shop inspection; and/or any Material furnished under these Specifications. If the Engineer
 fails to reject defective Work or Materials, whether from lack of discovery of such defect or for any other reason,
 such initial failure to reject in no way prevents the later rejection of the Materials or Work when such defect is
 discovered, or obligates the Engineer to Final Acceptance. The Engineer is not responsible for losses suffered by
 the Contractor due to removals or repairs of such defects.
 Remove or uncover portions of the finished Work as directed at any time before acceptance of the Work. After
 examination, restore those portions of the Work to the standard required by the Contract. If the exposed Work
 proves to be acceptable, the uncovering or removal and restoration will be paid as Extra Work. If the exposed Work
 proves to be unacceptable, the uncovering or removal and restoration shall be at the Contractor's expense.
 Any Work performed or Materials used without supervision or inspection by the Department representative may be
 ordered removed and replaced at the Contractor's expense.
 When any unit of government or political subdivision, utility company, or any railroad corporation pays a portion of
 the cost of the Work performed on this Contract, its respective representatives have the right to inspect the Work.
 Such inspection shall not make any unit of government or political subdivision, utility company, or any railroad
 corporation a party to this Contract, and shall in no way interfere with the rights of either party hereunder.
 105.04 Plans and Working Drawings. The Department will furnish, with the Bid Proposal, Plans of sufficient
 detail to convey a comprehensive understanding of the Work specified. Furnish Working Drawings as required by
 the Engineer. Do not incorporate any changes from the requirements of the Contract in the Working Drawings
 unless the changes are specifically denoted, together with justification, and approved in writing by the Engineer.
 Any change from the requirements of the Contract shall be signed and sealed by a Professional Engineer registered
 in Delaware. Identify Working Drawings and submittals by the Contract number. Identify Items or component
 Materials by the specific Contract Item Number and Specification reference in the Contract.
 Any staging and stockpile area(s) outside the Project’s LOC that individually or cumulatively are larger than 10,000
 square feet must be approved by DelDOT’s Archaeologist. Submit all staging and stockpile areas outside the
 Project’s LOC for approval. Within 30 Days, DelDOT will:
 A. Approve the use of the proposed staging and stockpile area(s),
 B. Reject the request, or
 C. Perform an archaeological survey to determine whether to approve or reject the request, which my take up
 to 3 months.
 If an archaeological survey is necessary, DelDOT or a consultant on its behalf will undertake the survey.
 The Contractor is responsible for the preparation of all Working Drawings. However, drawings submitted directly
 by the supplier or the Contractor's representative will be accepted by the Department, if the letter of submittal
 indicates that the Contractor has been notified of the submission.
 Working Drawings for metal Structures shall consist of shop detail, erection, and other Working Drawings showing
 details, dimensions, sizes of units, and other information necessary for the fabrication and erection of metal work.
 Provide such details on Working Drawings as are required for successful prosecution of the Work. Include plans for
 Items such as Falsework, bracing, sheeting, shoring, cofferdams, Formwork, masonry layout diagrams, and bending
 diagrams for reinforcing steel.
 Submit copies of the manufacturer’s catalog cuts, drawings, wiring diagrams, etc. with Working Drawings for
 electrical and mechanical Equipment. After all Items of a particular system have been reviewed, prepare an

 "Instruction Book" especially for the system. Include in the "Instruction Book" an Equipment list, a complete
 description of the Equipment, the sequence of operation including inter-locking and protective features, the use of
 by-pass switches, and a detailed description of all wiring circuits. Also include in the book a recommended spare
 parts list, renewal parts bulletins, and instruction bulletins for the Equipment furnished. Use diagrams and drawings
 of reduced size suitable for binding. Include a proper index listing all Items. Properly fasten and bind in a suitable
 leather or heavy plastic cover book with a title clearly shown.
 Prior to Final Inspection, supply five copies of the book to the Engineer. The books must be available during the
 period when electrical and mechanical systems are being connected and energized, and the final bound copies must
 reflect any changes or Adjustments made during this period.
 Submit electronic copies of Working Drawings to the Engineer following the procedure set forth in Figure below,
 unless otherwise defined at the preconstruction meeting. Should any questions arise as to the proper procedure for
 submitting Working Drawings, contact the Engineer for clarification. Returned drawings will be stamped as
 follows:
 A. "Returned for Resubmission". In this case, revisions or corrections must be made, and the drawings
 resubmitted for review.
 B. "Reviewed for General Conformity with Plans and Specifications". In this case, if the Contractor
 agrees with the comments, incorporate the comments and do not resubmit the drawings. If the Contractor
 does not agree with the comments, state the reason for disagreeing with the comments in writing and
 submit the reasons to the Department within ten Working Days after receipt of the Department’s
 comments.
 The Department does not review every detail of every Working Drawing or other submittal made by the Contractor.
 Consequently, responsibility for the completeness, accuracy, and conformance to Contract requirements of all
 submittals rests with the Contractor. The Department accepts no responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of
 approved submittals or the failure of approved submittals to conform to the requirements of the Contract.
 Reviewed Working Drawings, submittals, or resubmittals will be transmitted to the Contractor within forty-five (45)
 Days from the date of receipt by the Department. If a railroad, the U.S. Coast Guard, municipality, or other entity as
 specified in the Contract is required to review the Working Drawings, the reviewed Working Drawings will be
 returned within sixty (60) Days from the date of receipt by the Department. If the Working Drawings are not
 returned by the time specified, no additional compensation will be allowed except that an extension of time in
 accordance with Section 108.07 will be considered.
 The Department generally follows the submittal flowchart provided on the following page in reviewing and
 approving Working Drawings.

 SECTION 105
 
 105.05 Conformity with the Plans and Specifications. Perform all Work and furnish all Materials in reasonably
 close conformity with the lines, grades, cross-section, dimensions, and Material requirements, including tolerances,
 shown on the Plans or indicated in the Specifications.
 If the Engineer finds that the Materials or the finished product in which the Materials used are not within reasonably
 close conformity with the Plans and Specifications, but that reasonably acceptable Work has been produced, the
 Engineer will then make a determination if the Work will be accepted and remain in place. In this event, the
 Engineer will document the basis of acceptance which will provide for an appropriate Adjustment in the Contract
 price for such Work or Materials if deemed necessary by the Engineer.
 In the event the Engineer finds the Materials or the finished product in which the Materials are used or the Work
 performed are not in reasonably close conformity with the Plans and Specifications, and the result is an inferior or
 unsatisfactory product, remove and replace or otherwise correct the Work or Materials at the expense of the
 Contractor. If provisions are included in the Contract for the acceptance of Materials or Work that are not in full
 compliance with the minimum requirements stated, adjust the pay per those provisions.
 105.06 Coordination of the Contract Documents; Duty to Report Errors to the Engineer; Use of Dimensions
 over Scaled Measurements. Each individual Contract Document is an essential part of the Contract and a
 requirement occurring in one is binding as though occurring in all. All of the Contract Documents are intended to be
 complementary and to describe and provide for a complete Contract. In the case of a discrepancy between the
 Contract Documents the governing ranking will be:
 A. General Description
 B. General Notices
 C. Plans
 D. Special Provisions
 E. Standard Construction Details
 F.
 
 Standard Specifications
 
 Do not take advantage of any apparent error or omission in the Contract. If the Contractor discovers an error or
 omission, promptly notify the Engineer. The Engineer will make corrections and interpretations as necessary to
 fulfill the intent of the Contract. Do not use scaled measurements when the dimensions on the Plans are given or
 can be computed from the information given.
 The Contractor is responsible to verify during construction that the conditions actually encountered are consistent
 with the design and related Contract Documents during the course of construction. Issue a written Request For
 Information (RFI) to the Engineer for clarification and response, if any questions arise, experience interference /
 conflict caused by design, or feel errors and omissions may exist in the Contract Documents. The Engineer will
 respond to each RFI in writing clearly indicating all applicable design revisions. Provide a copy of all RFIs and
 responses to the Department as they are issued.
 If a deviation from the specified sampling or testing procedures and/or Contract Documents is identified by the
 Contractor, Inspector or any representative thereof, then submit for approval a written Non-Conformance Report
 (NCR), including its associated corrective actions forward, covering such deviation. Include in the NCR,
 description of construction activity and location by Specification.
 Make every attempt to identify issues and deviations from the Contract Documents in advance of the Work in order
 to allow the Department three (3) Working Days from receipt of the written notice to review and respond
 accordingly to any RFI and NCR. The Department will work with the Contractor with response to any RFI or NCR
 that requires immediate attention.

 SECTION 105
 
 105.07 Copies of the Plans; Contractor’s Supervision. The Contractor will be supplied with two copies of the
 Plans and the Bid Proposal. Keep one copy at the Project site at all times. Give the Work the constant attention
 necessary to facilitate progress and cooperate with the Engineer in every way possible.
 Furnish (a) a competent Superintendent or supervisor who is employed by the firm, has full authority to direct
 performance of the Work in accordance with the Contract requirements, and is in charge of all construction
 operations, regardless of who performs the Work and (b) such other organizational resources, including supervision,
 management and engineering services, as the Engineer determines is necessary to assure the performance of the
 Contract. The Superintendent or supervisor must be present on site while Work is being performed and must be
 competent, capable of reading and understanding the Contract and experienced in the type of Work being
 performed. The Superintendent or supervisor is the point of contact for the Engineer, authorized to act for the
 Contractor, and has full authority to execute orders or the directions of the Engineer without delay.
 105.08 Cooperation between Contractors. The Department reserves the right to contract for and perform other or
 Additional Work on or near the Limits of Construction covered by the Contract.
 Contractors performing work on the same Project shall coordinate their Work and cooperate with each other. In
 case of a dispute, the Engineer will be the referee, and the Engineer's decision will be final and binding on all.
 When separate Contracts are let within the limits of any one Project, conduct the Work without interfering or
 hindering the progress or Completion of the Work by other Contractors.
 Each Contractor involved assumes all liability, financial or otherwise, in connection with its respective Contract.
 Protect and save harmless the Department from any and all damages or Claims that may arise because of
 inconvenience, delays, or loss experienced because of the presence and operations of other Contractors working
 within the Limits of Construction of the same Project.
 Coordinate and sequence the Work with other contractors. Arrange, place, and dispose of Materials without
 interfering with the operations of other contractors on the same Project.
 105.09 Utilities within the Project Limits; Miss Utility One-Calls. Bidders are hereby notified that within the
 limits of the Work under this Contract, several utility facilities and/or appurtenances may be encountered. The
 locations of all utilities shown on the Plans or mentioned in the Contract Documents are approximate locations only.
 Prior to Advertisement, the Department will notify all utility companies, pipeline owners, railroads, or other parties
 known to be affected by the Work, and endeavor to have all necessary relocations of the public or private utility
 fixtures, pipelines, and other facilities and appurtenances within or adjacent to the Limits of Construction made as
 soon as practicable. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, do not proceed with the Work before
 conferring with the Engineer, the utility companies, and the municipal or county authorities in an effort to secure the
 most accurate and most recent information as to utility locations. As required by Chapter 8, Title 26 of the
 Delaware Code, do not begin any construction around or adjacent to utilities without notifying the Utilities Service
 Protection (Miss Utility) of Delmarva, Inc. at least two Working Days, but not more than ten Working Days in
 advance of starting the Work. Miss Utility is a report center system that enables the public, contractors, utilities, and
 other excavators to notify participating member utilities of planned digging activities by making one call.
 Water lines, gas lines, wire lines, services connections, water and gas meter boxes, water and gas valve boxes, light
 standards, cable ways, signals, and all other utility facilities and appurtenances within the limits of the proposed
 construction that require moving, including the Work involved in relocating or otherwise altering such utilities, are
 to be moved by others at no expense to the Contractor, except as otherwise provided in the Contract. Allow utility
 contractors performing Work within the limits of the Contract to use the Contractor’s maintenance of traffic (MOT)
 devices that are already in place as a result of the Work, such as “Road Work Ahead” signs and MOT related to the
 Project’s construction phasing. The respective utility contractor is responsible for their own Equipment, Work and
 personnel safety while working within the limits of another Contractor. Utility contractors performing Work within
 the work zone shall use their own MOT devices at their own expense for daily construction activities such as lane
 and shoulder closures. Utility contractors shall provide their own flaggers. The Engineer reserves the right to order
 the Contractor to provide MOT for utility companies working within the work zone. When the Engineer issues such
 an order, the Engineer will pay for the work under the Unit Prices in the Contract. If Unit Prices for MOT ordered
 by the Engineer do not exist on the Contract, the Contractor and the Engineer shall negotiate a new price for the
 work or follow the Force Account procedure for reimbursement. If the Contractor provides MOT at the request of a

 SECTION 105
 
 utility company, the Engineer will not make payments under the Contract. The utility company will pay the
 Contractor.
 The Engineer will not pay for any relocation or rearrangement of utility facilities or appurtenances made for the
 Contractor's sole convenience.
 Consider in the bid all the permanent and temporary utility appurtenances in their present or relocated positions as
 shown on the Plans or as readily discernible. No additional compensation will be allowed for any delays,
 inconvenience, or damage due to any interference from such utility facilities and appurtenances or the operation of
 moving them, except that the Contractor may be granted an extension of Contract Time.
 The relocation of existing utilities that will interfere with the proposed construction, the construction of new utility
 facilities, and/or the reconstruction of existing utility facilities may also be in operation simultaneously with the
 Work to be performed under this Contract.
 Any damage to utility services caused by the Contractor must be repaired at the Contractor's expense. Repair such
 damage immediately.
 Prior to performing any Work on the Project, contact all utility companies, pipeline owners, railroads, or other
 known parties affected and "Miss Utility" of DELMARVA in order to ensure that all such utilities have received
 notice and in order that all utility adjustments may be made.

 The report center is essentially a message center, to which all participating parties are connected by a private line
 teletype network. The work location report is called in over two primary numbers, toll free, 1-800-441-8355 and 1800-282-8555 in Delaware only. The area covered is the entire DELMARVA Peninsula.
 A minimum of two but not more than ten (10) Working Days advance notice of starting time is required. The Day
 of the call is not counted as one of these Days. This assures the person calling of having the underground facility
 located prior to excavation.
 The party reporting a digging operation is asked a standard format of questions to provide the utilities with the
 necessary information required to ensure an adequate location of the activity. The caller is given a ticket number for
 reference purposes. The center specifically locates reported areas of activity on a master map and determines the
 spot by grid coordinates. This information is then transmitted to the participating parties via high speed teletype
 network. The ticket life is for ten (10) Working Days after the call.
 Messages received are sent out immediately during normal work hours (7:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through
 Friday). Messages received after normal working hours, Saturdays, Sundays, or Holidays are taken, logged, and
 transmitted within one hour the next normal Work Day.
 The Work location report is received by the participating utility which immediately locates the Work area by the
 information transmitted from the message center. The utility must then respond to the person originating the call by
 1) stating it has no underground facilities at the designated location or 2) stating there are facilities in the area and
 dispatching a locating crew to the site and marking their underground facility with stakes, flags, and/or paint
 horizontally over the ground.
 APWA recommended safety color codes will be used: white for proposed excavation, pink for temporary survey
 marking, orange for communications, red for electric, blue for potable water, green for sewer and drain lines, yellow
 for gas and petroleum products, purple for reclaimed water. This will enable the reporting party to visually see if the
 utility has responded.
 Overhead High-Voltage Line Safety requires notification to and mutually agreeable measures from the utility from
 any person intending to carry on any function, activity, Work or operation within 20 feet of any high voltage
 overhead line.
 105.10 Construction Stakes, Lines, and Grades Provided by the Engineer. The Engineer will furnish and set
 control points and construction stakes unless otherwise specified in the Contract Documents.
 The Engineer will establish Right-Of-Way lines, Limits of Construction, and easements if needed, and will provide
 and set construction stakes establishing Right-Of-Way lines, easement lines, slopes, Profile Grades, centerline or
 off-set lines, and benchmarks. The Department may furnish the Contractor with information relating the lines,
 slopes, and grades. The Engineer will establish Structure working points, elevations, and all the necessary points
 and off-sets to complete the Structure. Use these stakes and marks as the field control to establish other necessary
 controls and perform the Work. Before beginning the Work, determine the meaning of all stakes, indicated
 measurements, and marks provided by the Department.
 
 105-8
 
 CONTROL OF WORK
 
 SECTION 105
 
 The Engineer will also perform preliminary and final cross-sections of borrow pit sites and cross-sections for
 bedrock and undercut excavation.
 Protect and preserve of all stakes and marks. The labor cost of the survey crew replacing disturbed stakes and marks
 will be deducted from the payment due for the Work.
 The Department is responsible for the accuracy of lines, slopes, grades, and other engineering work set forth under
 this Section. The Department will not be responsible for staking delays unless the Contractor provides the Engineer
 ten (10) Calendar Days’ notice prior to beginning Work for which layout is needed and thereafter gives at least two
 (2) business days’ notice that stakes are needed.
 105.11 Removal of Defective and Unauthorized Work. All Work that fails to meet the Contract requirements will
 be deemed unacceptable by the Engineer. Remove and dispose of all unacceptable Work at the Contractor’s
 expense immediately upon rejection by the Engineer. Work performed without adequate layout, Work performed
 beyond the lines and grades shown on the Plans, or any Extra Work performed without written direction by the
 Engineer will be considered unauthorized Work and will not be measured or paid by the Department. The Engineer
 may direct the Contractor to remove and replace unauthorized Work at the Contractor’s expense.
 Failure of the Contractor to remove and properly dispose of rejected Work immediately after receiving written
 notice to do so from the Engineer shall be sufficient cause for the termination of the Contract. Furthermore, the
 Engineer will have the authority to cause unacceptable Work to be remedied or removed and replaced, and
 unauthorized Work to be removed. The costs incurred by the Engineer for correcting unacceptable or unauthorized
 Work will be deducted from the amount due or to become due the Contractor.
 105.12 Load Restrictions. Comply with all legal and Contractual load restrictions in the hauling of Materials or
 Equipment on public roads. A hauling permit or other special permit will not relieve the Contractor of liability for
 damage to public or private property that may result from the movement of such loads or Equipment.
 Vehicles transporting construction Materials to Department Projects shall not exceed the gross vehicle weight
 (GVW) or licensed weight, if less, as specified in the Delaware Code. Materials inspection weigh tickets will not be
 issued by Department personnel for GVWs in excess of the allowable maximum. The allowable GVW for the
 delivery truck must be shown on each material ticket submitted to the Engineer.
 Payment for Materials delivered to the Project will not exceed the allowable GVW minus the truck tare weight. An
 average tare weight may be established on a basis approved by the Engineer so that empty weighing is not necessary
 before every load. No payment will be made for any excess Material weight.
 Notify Subcontractors, vendors, and suppliers of this requirement.
 The maximum GVW for different vehicle axle configurations is as follows; provided that in the case of three-axle
 vehicles the extra weight fee has been paid and is so noted on the registration card:
 Customary Values
 Single Unit Values
 
 GVW, Maximum
 
 2-axle vehicle (e.g., 2-axle dump truck)
 
 40,000 lb.
 
 3-axle vehicle (e.g., 3-axle dump truck)
 
 65,000 lb.
 *70,000 lb.
 
 4-axle vehicle (e.g., 4-axle dump truck)

 CONTROL OF WORK
 
 SECTION 105
 
 105.13 Maintenance during Construction. Maintain the Work during construction and until the Project is
 accepted. Perform this maintenance every Day in a continuous and effective manner with adequate Equipment and
 forces to keep the roadway and Structures in a satisfactory condition. All snow removal will be performed by
 DelDOT Maintenance, unless the Contract Documents specifically assign these responsibilities to the Contractor.
 All mowing of grass outside of the LOC will be performed by DelDOT Maintenance.
 The Engineer will notify the Contractor if there is a failure to comply with these provisions. If the Contractor fails
 to remedy unsatisfactory maintenance within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of the notice, the Engineer may
 proceed to maintain the Project. The entire cost of this maintenance will be deducted from monies due or to become
 due the Contractor. Failure to adequately and safely maintain the Project will be sufficient cause to terminate the
 Contract for default.
 If the Contract involves the placement of Material on or the use of a previously constructed subgrade, base course,
 pavement or Structure, maintain the previously constructed Work during construction operations.
 The cost of maintenance Work during construction and before the completion of the Final Inspection punchlist is
 incidental to the Contract. The cost of maintenance Work occurring after the Final Inspection punch list is complete
 will be paid by the Engineer, except that the cost of maintenance Work required for landscaping and vegetative
 growth shall be borne by the Contractor until Final Acceptance.
 In the event that the Contractor's Work is ordered shut down for failure to comply with the provisions of the
 Contract, maintain traffic, protect and maintain the roadway and Structures, and provide ingress and egress for local
 residents as may be necessary during the period of suspended Work or until the Contract has been declared in
 default.
 Mow all grass and weeds within the Limits of Construction, as directed by the Engineer, to a height in compliance
 with Section 107.01. If the Engineer directs the Contractor to mow grass more than 4 times in a calendar year, the
 Engineer will pay for all mowing beyond the fourth mowing operation.
 105.14 Opening Sections of the Project to Traffic. The Engineer may order certain sections of the Work to be
 opened to traffic or other use prior to Completion or acceptance of the Work. Opening these sections will not
 constitute acceptance of the Work or waiver of any Contract provisions. For sections of the Work that are open to
 traffic, the cost of repairing damage to the Work caused by vehicular traffic will be paid by the Engineer unless such
 section of roadway is open due to the fault or inactivity of the Contractor or the Contractor caused the damage. All
 other maintenance costs including, but not limited to, mowing grass, general cleanup and/or the repair of Work
 damaged by vandalism are borne by the Contractor until the Final Inspection punch list is complete, except that
 maintenance costs for Work involving landscaping and vegetative growth that are borne by the Contractor until
 Final Acceptance. Prior to opening a section of the Work to traffic, confer with the Engineer to ensure that all traffic
 control devices are in place and functioning. Do not open any section of roadway to traffic without the approval of
 the Engineer.
 105.15 Claims for Adjustments and Resolution of Disputes. All disputes between the Contractor and the
 Engineer arising under or related to this Contract that are not resolved by mutual agreement shall be resolved by
 following the Claim procedure established in this Section. “Claim” means a written demand or assertion by the
 Contractor or the Department seeking, as a legal or equitable right: payment of money, Adjustment or interpretation
 of Contract terms, or other relief.
 A. Contractor Notification of Claims.
 Notify the Engineer orally or in writing of the intention to make a Claim for relief before beginning the
 affected Work. Within five Working Days of declaring the intention to make a Claim, provide written
 notification of the Claim to the Engineer that includes the following:
 1.

 prescribed above or the Engineer is not afforded proper facilities by the Contractor for keeping strict
 account of the actual costs incurred by the Contractor as a result of the alleged change or alleged
 misinterpretation of the Contract, then the Contractor waives the Claim. Such notice by the Contractor, and
 the fact that the Engineer has kept account of the cost as aforesaid, shall not in any way be construed as
 proving the validity of the Claim. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed as establishing any
 Claim contrary to the terms of Section 104.06 or any other provision of the Contract Documents.
 B. Engineer’s Response to the Contractor’s Notice.
 Within ten (10) Calendar Days after receipt of the Contractor’s written notice of a Claim, the Engineer will

 SECTION 105
 
 Non-recoverable Damages or Expenses. The expenses listed above as 1. through 5. shall constitute the
 sole cost(s) and expense(s) to which the Contractor is entitled on any Claim submitted for additional
 compensation or settlement of any Claim made under these Specifications, except as further provided
 in Section 105.15.J. The parties agree that the Department will have no liability for the following
 items of damage or expense:
 a.
 
 Profit in excess of that provided herein;
 
 b.
 
 Loss of profit;
 
 c.
 
 The costs of lost productivity for labor and Equipment either on this Contract or any other;
 
 d.
 
 Home office overhead in excess of that provided herein;

 h.
 
 Interest on any claimed amounts.
 
 Submit any Claim on behalf of a Subcontractor according to Section 105.15. Recoverable damages for
 Claims submitted on behalf of Subcontractors shall be solely limited to the list of all direct or indirect costs
 permitted by 1. through 4. above. For Work approved by the Department, the Subcontractor will be
 allowed a percentage markup as permitted by Section 109.04 D.6. and 109.04 D.7. The Contractor will be
 allowed an additional percentage markup as permitted by Section 109.04 D.8. to be computed on the final
 sum total of such Subcontractor cost Claimed under 1. through 4. above for portions of Subcontractor Work
 approved by the Department.
 I.
 
 Liquidated Damages.
 A Claim, not for additional costs, but for a waiver by the Department of an assessment of Liquidated
 Damages, in whole or in part, may also be made by the Contractor as part of this Section. Any Claim
 submitted shall not affect in any manner the imposition or waiver of Liquidated Damages, except that any
 Liquidated Damages shall be waived for any delay for which a time extension is granted in accordance with
 Section 108.07.
 
 J.
 
 Claims for Delays.
 In order to receive an extension of Contract Time or to receive monetary compensation for delays to the
 Contract Schedule, the Contractor must request an extension of Contract Time in accordance with Section
 108.07. Base all requests for extensions of Contract Time on the Contract’s progress Schedule. Failure to
 properly update and maintain the progress Schedule in accordance with the terms of the Contract shall
 constitute a waiver of the Contractor’s rights to claim for a time extension and/or monetary damages due to
 a delay.
 The Department may grant time extensions in the performance of Work for delays caused by Acts of God
 as defined in Section 104.15. For such delays that are also beyond the control and not the fault of the
 Department, the Contractor shall be entitled to a time extension, but is not entitled to recover any other
 damages resulting from such delays.
 In the event that a delay is not caused by the Contractor's fault or negligence but is caused wholly by
 actions of the Department, or determined by an arbitrator to be the Department's sole responsibility, an
 extension of time will be granted in an amount equivalent to the actual critical delay caused by the
 Department, and the Contractor is not entitled to any additional compensation except as allowed herein. In
 the event that a delay that is the Department’s sole responsibility is concurrent with a delay that was not the
 
 105-14
 
 CONTROL OF WORK
 
 SECTION 105
 
 sole responsibility of the Department, the Contractor is entitled to a time extension, but shall not be entitled
 to recover any other damages resulting from the concurrent delay.
 All recoverable direct and indirect costs for compensable delays are identified in 1. below, and all nonrecoverable costs for compensable delays are identified in 2. below. Compensation provided by 1. below
 shall not be duplicative of compensation already provided as part of Section 105.15.H or 109.04.
 1.
 
 Allowable Direct and Indirect Expenses. Only the additional costs associated with the following
 items will be recoverable by the Contractor for delay compensation:
 a.
 
 Extended Field Overhead. Field overhead costs necessary for the prosecution of the Work during
 the delay period, as follows:
 i.
 
 General Field Supervision. Such costs include but are not limited to general field supervision,
 assistants, watchman, clerical and other field support staff that are physically located on the
 jobsite. Compute these labor costs in accordance with Section 109.04.D.1. For salaried
 personnel, calculate the rate of wage (or scale) actually paid by dividing the weekly salary by
 seven Days per week.
 
 ii.
 
 Field Office Facilities and Supplies. Such costs include but are not limited to field office
 trailers, tool trailers, office equipment rental, temporary toilets, and other incidental facilities
 and supplies that are physically located on the jobsite. Compute these costs on the basis of
 the actual added costs incurred by the Contractor to provide these services as a result of the
 delay.
 
 iii. Maintenance of Field Operations. Such costs include but are not limited to expenses for
 telephone, electric, water, and other similar services that are provided at the jobsite. Compute
 these costs on the basis of the actual added costs incurred to maintain these services as a result
 of the delay. These extended field overhead costs are not duplicative of those compensated in
 Section 109.04.D.7.
 b.
 
 Labor. For all necessary, non-salaried, idle labor that must remain on the Project during such
 periods of delay due to collective bargaining contracts or other reasons approved by the Engineer.
 Compute the labor costs in accordance with Section 109.04.D.1.
 
 c.
 
 Bond, Insurance, and Tax. In accordance with Section 109.04.D.2.
 
 d.
 
 Equipment. For any idle Equipment other than small tools that must remain on the Project site
 during delays, the Contractor is to receive compensation at the rate calculated in Section
 109.04.D.4. Should it not be necessary for machinery or Equipment to remain on the Project
 during delays, the Contractor is to receive transportation costs to remove the machinery or
 Equipment and return it to the Project at the end of the delay period. No compensation is
 recoverable for idle Equipment unless the Equipment has been held on the Project site on a
 standby basis at the request of the Engineer and, but for this request, would have left the Project
 site.
 
 e.
 
 Materials. Costs for material escalation due to the delay or the cost of storage of Materials due to
 the delay are recoverable. Obtain the Engineer's approval prior to storing any Material due to a
 delay.
 
 f.
 
 Percentage Markups. An additional 10 percent markup of the total of a., b., c., and d. above will
 provide full compensation for home office overhead and any other costs attributed to the delay for
 which no specific allowance is herein provided. This is the sole markup that is recoverable for a
 compensable delay. Markups from Sections 105.15.H.5., 109.04.D.6. and 109.04 D.7. shall not
 apply.
 
 g.
 
 Records. Payment will not be made for delays until the Contractor has furnished the Engineer
 with duplicate itemized statements of the cost as herein above specified and detailed as follows:
 
 105-15
 
 CONTROL OF WORK
 
 SECTION 105
 
 i.
 
 Name, classification, date, daily hours, total hours, rate, and extension for each worker and
 foreman.
 
 ii.
 
 Designation, dates, daily hours, total hours, rental rate, and extension for each unit of
 machinery and Equipment.
 
 iii. Transportation costs.
 iv. Cost of Bonds, property damage, liability, and workers compensation insurance premiums;
 unemployment insurance contributions; and social security taxes.
 The Engineer will compare the Department's records with those furnished by the Contractor and make
 any necessary Adjustments. When these records are agreed upon and signed by both parties, the
 records become the basis of payment for the expenses incurred, but do not preclude subsequent
 Adjustment based on later audits or inspections of the Contractor’s records by the Department.
 The Contractor's cost records pertaining to expenses under this Section shall be open to inspection or
 audit by representatives of the Department as provided in Section 105.15.K.
 2.
 
 Non-Allowable Damages or Expenses. The expenses listed in 1. above shall constitute the sole
 cost(s) and expense(s) to which the Contractor shall be entitled on any delay Claim submitted for
 additional compensation or settlement of any Claim made under these Specifications. The parties
 agree that the Department will have no liability for the items listed in Section 105.15.H.6.
 
 K. Review of Contractor’s Records by the Engineer.
 The Contractor agrees to make its accounting records and cost information available at the time of
 submission of the Claim and such other records as the Department may require in order to determine the
 validity and amount of each item Claimed. Ensure that such records are open to inspection or audit by
 representatives of the Department during the life of the Contract and for a period of not less than three
 years after the Contractor's acceptance of Final Payment as set forth in Section 109.10. Retain such records
 for that period.
 Where payment for Materials, Equipment, or labor is based on the cost of forces other than the
 Contractor's, make every reasonable effort to ensure that the cost records of such other forces are open to
 inspection and audit by representatives of the Department on the same terms and conditions as the cost
 records of the Contractor. Payment for the cost of such forces may be deleted if the records of such third
 parties are not made available to the Department's representatives.
 If an audit or inspection is to be commenced, the Engineer will provide the Contractor with a reasonable
 notice of the time when such an audit or inspection is to begin. In cases where all or a part of such records
 are not made available, the Contractor understands and agrees that any items not supported by records
 because the records are not made available will not be recoverable. If payment has already been made in
 such a case, refund to the Department the amount so recovered.
 L. Contractor and Subcontractor/Supplier Disputes.
 Resolve any dispute arising between the Contractor and its Subcontractor/supplier concerning payments
 held in trust, as required by Chapter 8, Title 17 of the Delaware Code by arbitration. The Department shall
 not serve as the arbiter of such disputes, but shall, in the absence of agreement between the parties,
 designate the American Arbitration Association to resolve the matter.
 105.16 Project Acceptance; Partial Acceptance. Final Acceptance will not occur until Completion of the Project
 as defined in Section 101.03. The Contract Time will be stopped at Substantial Completion as defined in Section
 101.03.
 When the Contract Time is stopped, expeditiously provide the exempted documents, certificates, or proofs of
 compliance. Final Acceptance and final payment will not be made until all documents, certificates, or proofs of
 compliance have been executed and delivered to the Engineer.
 105-16
 
 CONTROL OF WORK
 
 SECTION 105
 
 Upon receiving notice from the Contractor of Substantial Completion, the District will conduct a semi-final
 inspection. During this inspection, the District will note by stations and in detail all Work or conditions requiring
 correction. Immediately prosecute the corrective Work. When the noted corrections are completed to the
 satisfaction of the District, the Department will conduct a Final Inspection to certify that the Project can be used,
 occupied, or operated for its intended use and that the Work has been satisfactorily completed in accordance with the
 Contract Documents. The Engineer will note any further corrective measures as deemed necessary. Prosecute
 corrective measures immediately. When the corrective Work is satisfactorily completed, together with receipt of
 proper documentation as noted herein, the Engineer will immediately accept the Project and notify the Contractor in
 writing of the date of acceptance of the Project. If the Contractor fails to complete the corrective Work identified by
 the Engineer within a reasonable period of time, usually two weeks, after the semi-final and Final Inspections, or the
 Contractor fails to submit proper documentation including final invoice, time charges will resume until such is
 completed. For each and every Calendar Day or Working Day, dependent on the type of Contract, charged beyond
 Substantial Completion that exceeds the allowable Contract time, the Contractor will be assessed Liquidated
 Damages in the amount of 10 percent of the value shown in Section 108.09.
 When a unit or portion of the Project, such as a Structure, interchange, or section of road or pavement is
 Substantially Completed, the Contractor may request a Final Inspection of that unit or portion of the Work. If the
 unit or portion of the Work has been completed in accordance with the Contract, the Engineer may accept it as
 completed. The decision to make a partial acceptance of a unit of Work is solely at the discretion of the Engineer.
 Partial acceptance will not void or alter any of the terms of the Contract.

 Use only new Materials for incorporation into the Work unless otherwise specified in the Contract. Promptly notify
 the Engineer of the proposed sources of Materials to be used in the Work prior to delivery. The Engineer has the
 option of rejecting Materials at the supply source. If the Engineer determines that Materials met the requirements of
 the Contract at the supply source, but subsequently do not meet the Contract requirements at the jobsite either before
 or after incorporation in the Work, remove or correct the Materials to the satisfaction of the Engineer at the
 Contractor’s cost.
 106.02 Samples, Tests, and Referenced Specifications. All Materials must be approved by the Department prior
 to use in the Work. Use of unapproved Materials is at the Contractor’s risk and unapproved Materials may be
 deemed unacceptable by the Engineer. The Engineer reserves the right to inspect and/or test all Materials at any
 time before or after incorporation into the Work. Removal and replacement of unacceptable Materials from the
 Work is solely at the Contractor's expense. Tests performed by the Engineer are for quality assurance purposes
 only. The Contractor is responsible for quality control of the Materials as defined in Division 1000 of these
 Specifications and is responsible for the condition of the Materials until the Project is accepted.
 Unless otherwise designated, Material tests performed by the Department will be performed in accordance with the
 most recent test methods of the Department, AASHTO, or ASTM in effect on the date of Advertisement for Bid
 Proposals. When any specification or test is identified in the form of an AASHTO or ASTM number succeeded by
 "Modified" it refers to an AASHTO or ASTM specification or test as modified by the Department's Materials and
 Research Manual in effect on the date of Advertisement for Bid Proposals. If there is a difference in the test
 methods, the order of precedence in the test procedure used will be as follows:
 A. Materials and Research Manual
 B. AASHTO
 C. ASTM
 The Engineer will set forth minimum requirements for sampling Materials on each Contract and will provide the
 Contractor with these requirements upon request. The Engineer must be afforded the opportunity to perform the
 minimum number of tests; and the Engineer reserves the right to perform more than the minimum number of tests.
 Material sampling or splitting operations will be performed or observed by the Department. Materials to be used are
 also subject to inspection, testing, or rejection prior to or during incorporation into the Work. Copies of any or all
 test results will be made available to the Contractor upon request.
 When in the judgment of the Engineer, inconsequential quantities and use of Materials are required by the Contract,
 a field inspection report of Materials may be made by the Department in lieu of the minimum requirements for
 sampling Materials.
 106.03 Certification of Compliance. The Contract or the Department's Materials and Testing Schedule will
 designate Materials that can be incorporated in the Work if accompanied by certificates of compliance from the
 manufacturer. The certificates of compliance shall state that the Materials or assemblies provided fully comply with
 the Specification requirements of the Contract, and shall be signed by the manufacturer. Each lot of certified
 Materials or assemblies delivered to the Project must be accompanied by a certificate of compliance clearly
 identifying the Materials delivered and the Specification requirement satisfied.

 Such inspection shall not make the Federal Government a party to this Contract and will in no way interfere with the
 rights of either party hereunder.
 107.06 Construction Safety, Health, and Sanitary Standards. Do not require any person employed in
 performance of the Contract to Work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous,
 or dangerous to such person's health or safety. Expressly state this requirement in each subcontract agreement.
 Provide and maintain in a neat and sanitary condition such accommodations for the use of its employees as may be
 necessary to comply with the requirements of the State and local Boards of Health, or of other bodies or tribunals
 having jurisdiction.
 107.07 Public Convenience and Safety. In performing the Work, interfere as little as possible with traffic. Provide
 and maintain ingress and egress for all residences and places of business located along the construction route. Place
 Materials stored upon the highway in accordance with the MUTCD and, so far as practicable, in a manner that
 causes as little obstruction to the traveling public as possible. If, as determined by the Engineer, the road or any
 portion of it must remain open to travel during construction of the Project, perform the Work so that travel through
 the jobsite is safe and unobstructed. Provide and maintain in an acceptable condition any temporary roadways and
 Bridges that are necessary to accommodate the traffic using or diverted from the roadway under construction, and
 provide and maintain in a safe condition temporary approaches to and crossing of intersecting highways. Do not
 obstruct sidewalks, gutters, sewers, inlets, and portions of the highway adjoining the roadways under construction
 more than is absolutely necessary to complete the Work.
 Maintain a safe work site at all times and be prepared to make repairs as needed after normal working hours in the
 case of an emergency. If the Department is unable to contact the Contractor to make these repairs then State
 maintenance forces or a third party contractor may be used to make such repairs. The cost for this Work will be
 calculated according to Section 109.04.D for all State personnel involved or third party contractors, including
 vehicles, Equipment and Materials needed. This cost will be deducted from money due the Contractor under this
 Contract. The failure of the Contractor to be available and to make emergency repairs is sufficient grounds for the
 Department to terminate the Contract for default.
 107.08 Use of Explosives. When the use of explosives is necessary for the prosecution of the Work, exercise the
 utmost care not to endanger life or property, including new Work. Assume responsibility for all damage resulting
 from the use of explosives.
 Store all explosives in a secure manner in compliance with all laws and ordinances, and clearly mark all such
 storage places. Where no local laws or ordinances apply, provide storage satisfactory to the Engineer and not closer
 than 1000 feet from the road or from any building or camping area or place of human occupancy. Follow the
 requirements of the MUTCD in storing explosives and flammable liquids.
 Notify each public utility company having Structures in proximity to the site of the Work of the intention to use
 explosives. Give such notice sufficiently in advance of the Work to enable the companies to take such steps as they
 may deem necessary to protect their property from injury.
 The use of explosives will not be permitted within 200 feet of any existing, newly finished, or partly finished
 Structure on a Project unless authorized in writing by the Engineer. Do not store explosives overnight on the
 Project.
 107.09 Protection and Restoration of Property. Assume responsibility for the preservation of all public and
 private property, trees, monuments, etc., along and adjacent to the roadway not designated on the Plans for repair,
 removal, or construction. Take the precautions necessary to prevent damage to pipes, conduits, and other
 underground Structures, and protect from disturbance or damage all land monuments and property markers until
 Project Acceptance. Locate and reset any land monument or property markers damaged or disturbed during the
 Project using a Land Surveyor or a Professional Engineer registered in the State of Delaware. Do not injure or
 destroy trees or shrubs outside the Limits of Construction, nor remove or cut them without proper authority. Where
 any direct or indirect damage is done to public or private property on account of any act, omission, neglect, or
 misconduct in the execution or non-execution of the Work on the part of the Contractor, restore such property at the
 Contractor's expense to a condition similar or equal to that existing before such damage.
 
 107-2
 
 LEGAL RELATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC
 
 SECTION 107
 
 In case of the failure on the part of the Contractor to restore such property or make good such damage, the Engineer
 may, upon giving 48 hours notice, proceed to repair, rebuild, or otherwise restore such property as may be deemed
 necessary, and the cost thereof will be deducted from any monies due to the Contractor under the Contract.
 107.10 Responsibility for Damage Claims. Assume the responsibility and liability for, and indemnify and save
 harmless the Department, its officers, and employees, from and against all suits, actions, Claims, and all damages,
 direct or indirect, of whatever nature, caused to any person(s) or property or resulting to the Work from any act,
 Work, or plan performed or submitted by the Contractor or upon its behalf; including but not limited to
 responsibility of the Contractor to provide for the protection and safety of all persons and property. This
 indemnification and save harmless requirement applies to, but not be limited to, all suits, actions, Claims brought,
 and all damages resulting from any death, injury, or damage received or sustained by any person(s), third person(s),
 or property based upon:
 A. Operations of the Contractor, including but not limited to Work performed; neglect in safeguarding the
 Work; use of unacceptable Materials; any act, Work, or plan performed or submitted by the Contractor, on
 its behalf, or resulting from performance, nonperformance of the Work, or any omission, neglect, or
 misconduct occurring during the course of the Contract.
 B. Any Claim(s) or amount(s) recovered from any infringement(s) of patent, trademark, or copyright.
 C. Any Claim(s) or amount(s) arising or recovered under the "Workers Compensation Act", for any violation
 or alleged violation of any law, ordinance, rule, regulation, order, or decree.
 The Department may withhold as retainage for the use of the State to pay any amount claimed or
 anticipated, as determined by the Engineer, except that such money will not be withheld when the
 Contractor produces satisfactory evidence that it is adequately protected by public liability and property
 damage insurance. In any event, the Surety shall be liable to pay any amount recovered as a result of any
 suit, action, Claim, injuries, or damages sustained and until such time as the matter has been settled or
 otherwise legally resolved.
 107.11 Furnishing Right-Of-Way. The Department will be responsible for securing all necessary Rights-Of-Way
 in advance of construction. Any exceptions will be indicated in the Contract.
 107.12 Personal Liability of Public Officials. The Department, Director, Engineer, or their authorized agents will
 incur no personal liability as a result of carrying out any of the provisions of the Contract, as the result of exercising
 any power or authority granted to them thereby, or as the result of any act by the Contractor. In such matters they
 act as the agents and representatives of the State.
 107.13 Contractor’s Responsibility for the Work after Final Acceptance; No Waiver of Legal Rights. Upon
 Completion of the Work, the Department will expeditiously make Final Inspection and notify the Contractor of
 acceptance. Such Final Acceptance, however, will not preclude or estop the Department from correcting any
 measurement, estimate, or certificate made before or after Completion of the Work, nor will the Department be
 precluded or estopped from recovering from the Contractor or its Surety, or both, such overpayment as it may
 sustain, or recovering the cost of the failure on the part of the Contractor to fulfill its obligations under the Contract.
 A waiver on the part of the Department of any breach of any part of the Contract shall not be held to be a waiver of
 any other or subsequent breach.
 The Contractor, without prejudice to the terms of the Contract, is liable to the Department after Final Acceptance for
 latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as may amount to fraud, or as regards the Department's rights under any
 warranty or guaranty.
 107.14 Hazardous Materials Discovered Within the Project Limits. If any condition is encountered or exposed
 that indicates the presence of a hazardous material or toxic waste, immediately suspend construction operations in
 the area and notify the Engineer. Continue Work in other areas of the Project unless otherwise directed by the
 Engineer.
 Conditions indicating the presence of a hazardous material or toxic waste include, but are not limited to, the
 following: presence of barrels, chemical odors, excessively hot earth, smoke, or any other condition that indicates a
 hazardous material or toxic waste. Treat such conditions with extreme caution.

 108.01 Subletting of the Contract. Perform Work with the Contractor’s own organization amounting to not less
 than 50 percent of total original Contract Price, excluding any specialty Items designated by the Contract. Specialty
 Items may be performed by subcontract and the amount of any such specialty Items performed may be deducted
 from the total original Contract Price before computing the amount of Work required to be performed by the
 Contractor’s own organization. The Contract upon which the requirements are computed includes the cost of
 Material and manufactured products that are to be purchased or produced by the Contractor under the Contract
 provisions. Adjustments in quantities or additional Items of Work shall not require an Adjustment of the percentage
 computed as described above.
 The term “perform Work with its own organization” refers to workers employed or leased by the prime Contractor,
 and Equipment owned or rented by the prime Contractor, with or without operators. Such term does not include
 employees or Equipment of a Subcontractor or lower tier Subcontractor, agents of the prime Contractor or any other
 assignees. The term may include payments for the costs of hiring leased employees from an employee leasing firm
 meeting all relevant Federal and State regulatory requirements. Leased employees may only be included in this term
 if the prime Contractor meets all of the following conditions:
 A. The prime Contractor maintains control over the supervision of the day-to-day activities of the leased
 employees;
 B. The prime Contractor remains responsible for the quality of the Work of the leased employees;
 C. The prime Contractor retains all power to accept or exclude individual employees from Work on the
 Project; and
 D. The prime Contractor remains ultimately responsible for the payment of predetermined minimum wages,
 the submission of payrolls, statements of compliance and all other federal regulatory requirements.
 “Specialty Items” are limited to Work that requires highly specialized knowledge, abilities, or Equipment not
 ordinarily available in the type of contracting organizations qualified and expected to bid or propose on the Contract
 as a whole and in general are intended to be limited to minor components of the overall Contract. All Specialty
 Items will be expressly identified in the Contract.
 Do not sublet, sell, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of any portion of the Contract except with the written
 consent of the Engineer. Such consent, when given, does not relieve the Contractor of any responsibility for the
 fulfillment of the Contract. Do not purchase Work or Materials from an organization other than its own, or
 otherwise dispose of the Contract or Contracts or any portion thereof, or of its right, title or interest therein, without
 written consent from the Engineer. Written consent will only be given after the Engineer has assured that each
 subcontract is evidenced in writing and that it contains all pertinent provisions and requirements of the prime
 Contract.
 
 108-1
 
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 
 SECTION 108
 
 If the Contractor proposes to subcontract any part of Work, outline the scope and value of the Work to be performed
 by the Subcontractor. Outline the cost of Materials to be used by the Subcontractor. Include the cost of Materials to
 be used by the Subcontractor in the value of the subcontracted Work. A Subcontractor shall not subcontract further
 a portion of the Work without the express written permission of the Engineer. In granting such permission, the
 Engineer will ensure that the Subcontractor seeking to subcontract the Work to be performed by another shall
 nonetheless perform with its own organization Work amounting to not less than 50 percent of the total subcontracted
 bid price.
 Perform all the traffic control Work and related Items either (1) entirely with labor, Equipment and Materials from
 the Contractor's own organization; or (2) entirely with labor, Equipment and Materials from a single Subcontractor.
 Maintenance of the Equipment will not be subject to this requirement.
 When the Contractor has sublet a portion of the Contract or a Bid Item to a Subcontractor, the actual payment to the
 Subcontractor will be applied to fulfill Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) requirements of the Contract,
 where applicable. The cost of the portion of the Contract or Bid Item performed by a DBE will be included in the
 total amount of Work subcontracted by the Contractor in determining whether the Contractor is performing at least
 50 percent of the total Contract Bid Price, as required by this Section.
 As a prerequisite to payment for any Work performed by a Subcontractor or on a Subcontractor's behalf and prior to
 any Work being performed on the Project by any Subcontractor, submit a certified copy of the ContractorSubcontractor agreement and a copy of the Subcontractor’s Delaware business license. Also include all other
 contracts with suppliers or any other person, firm, or organization for review and approval by the Engineer. Each
 subcontract shall be in writing and shall contain and state that all pertinent provisions and requirements of the prime
 Contract are incorporated into the subcontract. The Contractor is solely responsible to determine that all such
 provisions are included and such provisions will be implied where not specifically included.
 The Contractor may also be required to submit additional information concerning the prospective Subcontractor or
 supplier, including any additional information required by the terms of this Contract, by the Department or by the
 FHWA, or other governmental agency, where necessary. Such information may include but may not necessarily be
 limited to:
 A. Evidence that the organization which performs the Work is particularly experienced and equipped for such
 Work.
 B. Assurance by the Contractor that the labor standards provisions set forth in this Contract shall apply to
 labor performed on all Work encompassed by the Contract.
 C. Assurance that all Civil Rights provisions and DBE requirements have been satisfied.
 Include provisions in all subcontracts that indemnify and save harmless the Department from the action of the
 Subcontractor or supplier; provisions that provide for the binding arbitration of all disputes between the parties to
 the subcontract agreement; and provisions that save harmless and indemnify the Department for omissions in the
 subcontract agreement.
 Any review performed or permission or approval granted under these Specifications will not operate, nor be
 interpreted as approval of the Work to be performed by the Subcontractor or Material supplied by a supplier, nor
 operate to relieve the Contractor of the sole responsibility for satisfactory Completion of the Contract. No contracts,
 subcontracts, supplier agreements, sales, transfers, leases, assignments, or any other agreements applicable to this
 Contract will in any case release the Contractor of its sole responsibility and liability under the Contract and Bonds.
 The Department, at its discretion, may refuse to pay for or accept all or part of the Work or Materials supplied by an
 unapproved Subcontractor or Materials supplier and may refuse to consider such Work performed or Materials
 supplied as part of the subcontracted Work.
 108.02 Preconstruction Meeting; Submitting a Schedule; Notice to Proceed. Following the execution of the
 Contract, the Engineer may schedule a preconstruction meeting. Prior to the preconstruction meeting, submit the
 progress Schedule per Section 108.04. After the preconstruction meeting, the Engineer will issue to the Contractor a
 Notice to Proceed which will stipulate the date on or before which the Contractor must begin Work. The date
 specified in the notice will be at least ten (10) Calendar Days subsequent to the date of issuance of the Notice to
 
 108-2
 
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 
 SECTION 108
 
 Proceed. No Work is to be started before receipt of the Notice to Proceed. The specified Contract Time will begin
 on the Day the Work actually starts or on the date stipulated in the Notice to Proceed, whichever is earlier.
 108.03 Commencement of Work; Counting Contract Time. Begin Work no later than the date stipulated in the
 Notice to Proceed. Contract Time will be counted using either Calendar Days or Working Days, whichever is
 indicated in the Bid Proposal.
 A. Calendar Day Contracts. Contract Time will begin as specified in Section 108.02 and continue each and
 every Day shown on the calendar until the Substantial Completion of the Work as determined by the
 Engineer. No Work will be permitted on Sundays or Holidays unless the Engineer determines that such
 Work is in the best interest of the Department. If the Contractor wants to perform Work on Sundays and/or
 Holidays, submit a written request to the Engineer at least three Working Days prior to the Sunday or
 holiday for approval to perform Work on such Sunday or Holiday. Provide notice to the Engineer no later
 than 12 PM Friday if any Work is to be performed that week on Saturday so that adequate inspection can
 be provided by the Department.
 B. Working Day Contracts. Contract Time will begin as specified in Section 108.02 and continue as defined
 in Section 101.03 until Substantial Completion of the Work as determined by the Engineer. No Work will
 be permitted on Sundays or Holidays unless the Engineer determines that such Work is in the best interest
 of the Department. Submit a written request to the Engineer at least three Working Days prior to the
 Sunday or holiday for approval to Work on such Sunday or Holiday. Provide notice to the Engineer no
 later than 12 PM Friday if any Work is to be performed that week on Saturday so that adequate inspection
 can be provided by the Department.
 108.04 Contractor’s Resources; Progress Schedules. Provide sufficient Materials, Equipment, and labor to
 complete the Project within the Contract Time. Lack of resources is not a sufficient reason for an extension of
 Contract Time.
 Submit a Progress Schedule to the Engineer for review. Do not start Work until the Progress Schedule is approved
 and methods of construction operations for each phase of construction are acceptable to the Engineer and are in
 conformance with all applicable erosion and sediment control requirements. The progress Schedule will be used to
 establish the critical construction operations and to monitor the progress of the Work. Submit the progress Schedule
 chart in the form specified below, unless the Contract requires a Critical Path Method (CPM) Schedule. When the
 Contract requires a CPM Schedule, the specifications for preparing and maintaining the Schedule will be set forth in
 the Special Provisions. The cost of preparing and maintaining a progress Schedule is incidental to the Contract
 unless otherwise specified in the Contract Documents.
 If the Contractor elects to use a CPM Schedule when it is not required in the Contract, comply with the requirements
 of this Section and no additional payment will be made for the CPM Schedule.
 A. Progress Schedule Chart. Prepare a Progress Schedule Chart (“PSC”) that shows in detail the time
 (Working Days or Calendar Days as specified) involved in performing construction activities for the
 duration of the Project. Schedule the Project in such manner and sequence as to minimize the time and
 surface area of erodible earth material. Use the PSC for the coordination of Work under the Contract
 including the activities of Subcontractors, vendors, and suppliers. The Department will use the PSC to
 monitor the progress of the Work. Show the impact of utility activities, permits and interdependent Work
 between separate Project locations, if applicable.
 Fully use, but do not exceed, the specified Contract duration in the PSC. Time charges will begin no later
 than the time stipulated in the Notice to Proceed. Review and approval of the PSC will not bind the
 Department nor constitute acceptance of any individual time period for scheduled activities.
 B. Biweekly and As-Required Look-Ahead Schedules. Submit to the Engineer a two-week activity
 Schedule on each Friday for each two-week period of Work activity. This activity Schedule shall provide
 specific details related to actual construction activities the Contractor plans to have in progress during the
 two-week period.
 When requesting an extension of Contract Time as specified in Section 108.07 and if required by the
 Engineer, submit a revised detailed progress Schedule showing the remaining Work to be completed and
 108-3
 
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 
 SECTION 108
 
 any delay periods that affected the Schedule. The Engineer also reserves the right to require the Contractor
 to submit a revised Schedule when the Contractor performs a significant amount of the Work out of
 sequence from the approved Schedule.
 Monthly Payment Chart. Unless otherwise noted on the Plans submit to the Engineer, as part of the PSC or CPM
 Schedule submittal, an estimate of the monthly payments expected to be received on the Contract. This estimate
 will be referenced as the “Monthly Payment Chart”. The Monthly Payment Chart can be generated by hand, or by a
 word processor or spreadsheet. Include, as a minimum, columns showing estimated monthly payments for the
 duration of the Contract Time. The total of all estimated monthly payments must equal the Awarded Contract total
 Bid Price. The Engineer may request an updated “Monthly Payment Chart” depending on the accuracy of the initial
 estimates and according to the overall needs of the Department. The Monthly Payment Chart is not binding on
 either the Department or the Contractor. The purpose of the chart is to help the Department plan its budget so that
 Contractors can be paid each month as quickly as is practicable.
 Costs to prepare and/or update the “Monthly Payment Chart” are addressed as follows:
 A. On Contracts requiring CPM Schedules and Updates, these will be addressed with Special Provisions.
 B. On Contracts not requiring CPM Schedules, the cost to prepare and update the “Monthly Payment Chart” is
 included in Item 763000, Initial Expense.
 108.05 Traffic Requirements and Contractor's Operations; Completing Work. Schedule and conduct Work in
 such a manner and in such sequence as will ensure the least interference with traffic. Do not open up Work to the
 prejudice or determent of Work already started; and the Engineer may require the Contractor to finish a section on
 which the Work is in progress before Work is started on any additional sections.
 108.06 Preference for Delaware Labor; Character of Workers and Equipment; Specified Construction
 Methods. In the construction of all public works for the State or any political subdivision thereof, or by persons
 contracting with the State or any political subdivision thereof, give preference in employment of laborers, workers,
 or mechanics to bona fide legal citizens of the State who have established citizenship by residence of at least 90
 Days. Each public works Contract for the construction of public works for the State or any political subdivision
 thereof will contain a stipulation that any person, company, or corporation who violates the provisions of this
 Section shall pay penalty to the State Treasurer equal to the amount of compensation paid to any person in violation.
 The requirement to give preference to Delaware laborers, workers or mechanics shall not apply to federally funded
 Contracts.
 Employ only competent and efficient persons. Whenever, in the opinion of the Engineer, any employee is careless
 or incompetent, obstructs the progress of the Work, acts contrary to instructions of the superintendent or foreman, or
 conducts himself/herself improperly, discharge the employee, upon the request of the Engineer, from the Work and
 do not again employ that person on the Contract or any other Contract for the Department, except with the written
 consent of the Engineer.
 Use only machinery and Equipment that is of sufficient size and capacity to obtain satisfactory quality in the
 performance of the Work. Do not use Equipment that injures the Work, adjacent property or public roads. When
 the Contract specifies that the Work be performed by the use of certain methods and/or Equipment, use such
 methods and/or Equipment unless alternatives are authorized by the Engineer. Submit requests for the use of
 alternative Equipment or methods in writing for approval. If approval is given, the Contractor will be fully
 responsible for producing Work in conformity with Contract requirements. If, after trial use of the substituted
 methods and/or Equipment, the Engineer determines that the Work produced does not meet the Contract
 requirements, discontinue the use of the substitute method and/or Equipment and complete the remaining
 construction with the specified methods and/or Equipment.
 If substituted methods or Equipment produce deficient Work, remove the deficient Work and replace it with Work
 of specified quality, or take such other corrective action as the Engineer may direct. No additional compensation or
 increases in Contract Time will be allowed as the result of authorizing a change in methods and/or Equipment under
 these provisions unless it is as a credit to the Department or a VEP.
 108.07 Extensions of Contract Time; Weather Delays. If the Contractor cannot complete the Work within the
 time allowed by the Contract due to a delay or delays that meet the criteria of Section 105.15.J, submit a written
 108-4
 
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 
 SECTION 108
 
 request to the Engineer for an extension of time for Completion of the Contract. Submit the reasons justifying the
 delay. All time analysis will be performed based on the approved Contract Schedule. Failure to submit an
 acceptable Schedule or failure to properly maintain the Schedule forfeits the Contractor’s right to a time extension.
 If requested by the Engineer, submit a revised detailed progress Schedule showing the remaining Work to be
 completed on the Project. If the Engineer finds that the request for an extension of time is justified, the Engineer
 will grant an extension of time in such amount as the Contractor proves to be reasonable and proper. Upon written
 notice being sent by the Engineer, the new Completion time will become part of the Contract and shall be binding
 upon the Contractor and Surety. The Contractor shall not be entitled to any additional time as a result of any delay
 to the Schedule without articulating a valid reason that is permitted by these Specifications.
 The Contractor is presumed to have included in its Contract price allowance for any reasonably anticipated delays in
 procurement of Materials and procurement is the Contractor’s sole responsibility. Unless some unusual market
 condition such as an industry-wide strike, natural disaster, or area-wide shortage arises after bids are taken and
 prevents procurement of Materials within the allowable time limitations, delays in delivery of such Materials are not
 sufficient reasons for extending the Contract Time.
 For Contracts that do not provide an allowance for Weather Days in the Contract Documents, follow the
 requirements of Section 105.15.J to determine if weather warrants and extension of Contract Time.
 For Contracts that provide an allowance for Weather Days, the term “Weather Day” means any Calendar Day,
 including weekends, Holidays and non-Work periods, on which weather conditions would prevent a Contractor from
 performing Work, whether or not the Contractor was scheduled to Work that Day. For each Weather Day that
 occurs on a jobsite, submit a request to the Engineer for that Day to be counted as a Weather Day. When the total
 number of Weather Days that are submitted and approved exceeds the number of allowable Weather Days provided
 in the Contract, Contract Time will be extended one Calendar Day for each Calendar Day that Work cannot progress
 due to the impact of weather. Such extensions will only begin accruing once the allowable Weather Days are
 exceeded and Contract Time will only be adjusted for Weather Days that occur after the number of allowable
 Weather Days has been exceeded. For Contracts without CPM Schedules, Calendar Days lost to weather do not
 need to occur on a critical path in order to be considered for an extension of Contract Time.
 108.08 Failure to Complete on Time. For each Calendar Day or Working Day that Work remains uncompleted
 after the Contract Time has expired, the sum specified in Section 108.09 will be deducted from any money due the
 Contractor. This sum is not a penalty, but is a Liquidated Damage assessed to recover the cost of inconvenience to
 the public, added cost of engineering and supervision, and other extra expenditures of public funds due to the
 Contractor's failure to complete the Work on time. Any Adjustment of the Contract Time for Completion of the
 Work granted under Section 108.07 will be considered in the assessment of Liquidated Damages.
 The column indicated in the chart as "Calendar Day" will also be used in the assessment of Liquidated Damages for
 contracts with a predetermined Completion date.
 Computations for the assessment of Liquidated Damages will be made in accordance with the daily computations
 described in the definition of Working Day, when the Contract is a Working Day Contract. On all other Contracts
 each and every consecutive Calendar Day, including Saturdays, Sundays, and Holidays, will be included in the
 computations for the assessment of Liquidated Damages.
 Assume liability for Liquidated Damages for delays commencing from the date on which the Contract Time, as
 adjusted by Section 108.07, expires. The Department will not pay the Contractor for maintenance of traffic (MOT)
 devices or measures used during periods when Liquidated Damages are assessed. This includes, but is not limited
 to, MOT devices, flaggers, traffic officers and any lump sum MOT Items that may be included in the Contract.
 Additionally, the Department will not pay the Contractor for field office items or CPM updates used during periods
 when Liquidated Damages are assessed.
 Permission for the Contractor or Surety to continue and finish Work after the Contract Time and approved
 extensions have elapsed will not waive the Department's rights under the Contract. The Department may waive such
 portions of the Liquidated Damages as may accrue after the Work is substantially complete and is in a condition for
 safe and convenient use by the traveling public. Payment of Liquidated Damages will be deducted from payments
 otherwise due the Contractor or be made by direct payment by the Contractor in the event that the total Liquidated
 Damages due exceeds the deductions.

 C. If the Contractor's Work is unacceptable, or if the Contractor refuses to remove Materials or perform any
 such Work as shall be determined by the Engineer to be defective or otherwise unacceptable Work.
 D. If the Contractor discontinues the prosecution of the Work or fails to resume the Work which has been
 discontinued.
 E. If the Contractor becomes insolvent, declares bankruptcy, commits any acts of bankruptcy or insolvency, or
 allows any final judgment to stand unsatisfied for a period of ten (10) Days.
 F.
 
 If the Contractor makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors without authorization by the Department.
 
 G. If the Contractor, for any other cause whatsoever, fails to carry on the Work in a manner acceptable to the
 Department.
 If the Contractor or Surety, within a period of ten (10) Days after receiving a written notice of default from the
 Engineer, fails to remedy the situation to the satisfaction of the Engineer, the Engineer will declare the Contractor to
 be in default on the Contract, terminate the Contractor's right to proceed with the Work, and have full power and
 authority, without violating the Contract, to take over the prosecution of the Work from the Contractor. The
 Department may appropriate or use the Contractor’s Materials at the site as may be suitable for use in the Project
 and may enter into an agreement with another Contractor for the Completion of the Contract according to the terms
 and provisions thereof, or use other methods as in the opinion of the Engineer will be required for the Completion of
 the Contract.
 All costs and changes incurred by the Department as a result of the default, including the cost of completing the
 Work under Contract or remedying defective or otherwise unacceptable Work, and any applicable Liquidated
 Damages or disincentives will be deducted from monies due the Contractor for completed Work. If such cost
 
 108-6
 
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 
 SECTION 108
 
 exceeds the sum which would have been payable under the Contract, then the Contractor and the Surety shall be
 liable and shall pay to the Department the balance of such costs in excess of the Contract Price.
 If it is determined, after termination of the Contractor's right to proceed, that the Contractor was not in default, the
 rights and obligations of the parties will be the same as if the termination had been issued for the convenience of the
 Department in accordance with Section 108.11. Thus, damages to which a Contractor may be entitled as a result of
 an improper default termination will be limited to amounts as provided for in Section 108.11.
 108.11 Termination of the Contract for Convenience. The Department may, by written order to the Contractor,
 terminate the Contract or any portion of the Contract when such termination would be in the best interest of the
 Department. In the event such termination occurs without fault and for reasons beyond the control of the
 Contractor, all completed Items as of the date of termination will be paid for at the Contract price. Payment for
 partially completed and eliminated Work will be paid as provided in Section 109.06.
 Acceptable Materials obtained by the Contractor for the Work, but which have not been incorporated therein, may,
 at the option of the Department, be purchased from the Contractor at actual cost delivered to a prescribed location,
 or otherwise disposed of as mutually agreed.
 After receipt of notice of termination from the Department, submit, within sixty (60) Days of the effective
 termination date, its’ Claim for additional damages or costs not covered above or elsewhere in these Specifications.
 Such Claim may include such cost items as reasonable idle Equipment time, mobilization efforts, uncompensated
 bidding and Project investigation costs, overhead expenses attributable to the Project terminated, legal and
 accounting charges involved in Claim preparation, Subcontractor costs not otherwise paid, actual idle labor costs if
 Work is stopped in advance of the termination date, guaranteed payments for private land usage as part of original
 Contract, and any other direct cost or direct damage for which the Contractor feels reimbursement should be made.
 The intent of negotiating this Claim would be that an adjusted figure be reached with the Contractor. In no event,
 however, will loss of anticipated profits be considered as part of any settlement.
 The Contractor agrees to make its cost records available to the extent necessary to determine the validity and amount
 of each Item claimed.
 Termination of the Contract or portion thereof shall not relieve the Contractor of its contractual responsibilities for
 the Work completed, nor shall it relieve the Surety of its obligation for and concerning any just Claim arising out of
 the Work performed.
 108.12 Termination of the Contractor's Responsibility. The termination of the Contractor's responsibility for the
 Work occurs upon Final Acceptance in accordance to Section 105.16, except to the extent provided in Section
 107.13.

 109.01 Measurement of Quantities. Work completed under the Contract will be measured by the Engineer
 according to the United States customary units (English units).
 Unless stated otherwise, all Material that is to be measured by weight and will be measured as follows:
 A. Weigh each loaded truck or other approved hauling Equipment and then deduct the tare weight of the truck
 or hauling Equipment. Check the tare weight once daily, or as often as directed by the Engineer. Make
 appropriate adjustments in the use of the tare weight as directed by the Engineer. Computer generate all
 weight tickets. Antiquated
 B. Use a scale platform of such length and width that it will conveniently accommodate all trucks and other
 approved hauling Equipment. The entire vehicle, including its load, must rest on the scale platform and be
 weighed as one unit.
 C. The State sealer of weights and measures will certify all scales used to weigh loads for payment.
 A station, when used as a definition or term of measurement, will be 100 linear feet. Unless otherwise specified,
 longitudinal measurements for area computations will be made horizontally, and no deductions will be made for
 individual fixtures (such as manholes, utility poles, etc.) having an area of 9 square feet or less. Transverse
 measurements for area computations will be the neat dimensions shown on the Plans.
 Measure Structures according to neat lines shown on the Plans or other Contract Documents.
 For Items measured by linear foot, such as pipes, Culverts, guardrails, underdrains, etc., take measurements parallel
 to the base or foundation upon which such Structures are placed.
 The term "ton" means the short ton consisting of 2000 pounds. Weigh all Material measured by weight or
 proportioned by weight on accurate, approved scales using competent, qualified personnel at locations designated by
 the Engineer. If Materials are shipped by rail, the car weight may be accepted provided that only the actual weight
 of Materials is used for payment. However, car weights will not be acceptable for Material to be passed through
 mixing plants. Weigh empty trucks used to haul Material being paid by weight daily at such times as the Engineer
 directs, and each truck shall bear a plainly legible identification mark.
 When requested by the Contractor and approved by the Engineer in writing, Material specified to be measured by
 the cubic yard may be weighed and such weights will be converted to volumes for payment purposes. Factors for
 conversion from weight measurement to volume measurement will be determined by the Engineer. The Engineer
 and the Contractor must mutually agree to use such conversions before using them. If no agreement can be reached,
 the Material will be measured in place by volume.
 Bituminous Materials will be measured by the gallon.
 
 109-1
 
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 
 SECTION 109
 
 Volumes will be measured at 60 degrees Fahrenheit or will be corrected to the volume at 60 degrees Fahrenheit
 using ASTM D4311 for asphalt or ASTM D633 for tars.
 When bituminous Materials are shipped by truck or transport, net certified weights or volume subject to correction
 for loss or foaming may be used for computing quantities.
 Cement will be measured by the pound.
 Timber will be measured by the actual thousand feet board measure, MFBM, incorporated into the Structure.
 When a complete Structure or structural unit (in effect, "lump sum" Work) is specified as the unit of measurement,
 the unit will be construed to include all necessary fittings and accessories.
 When standard manufactured items are specified such as fence, wire, plates, rolled shapes, pipe conduit, etc., and
 these items are identified by unit weight, section dimensions, etc., such identification will be considered to be
 nominal weights or dimensions. Unless more stringently controlled by tolerances specified elsewhere in the
 Contract, manufacturing tolerances established by the industries involved will be accepted.
 109.02 Scope of Payment for Unit Prices; Payment of Subcontractors. Receive and accept compensation
 provided in the Contract as full payment for furnishing all Materials and for performing Work under the Contract in
 a complete and acceptable manner and for all risk, loss, damage, and expense of every kind arising out of the nature
 of the Work or the performance thereof, subject to the provisions of Section 107.13.
 If the "Basis of Payment" clause for an Item relating to a Unit Price in the Contract requires that the Unit Price cover
 and be considered compensation for certain Work or Materials used to complete the Work for that Item, this same
 Work or Material will not be measured or paid under any other Pay Item appearing in the Contract.
 When requirements, responsibilities and/or furnishing of Materials (collectively called “Requirements” in this
 Section) are outlined in the details, notes on the Plans and/or in the paragraphs preceding the “Basis of Payment”
 paragraph in these Specifications or Special Provisions, such Requirements are included in the payment for the Item.
 No separate payment will be made for the above mentioned Requirements even if those requirements are not
 expressly reiterated in the “Basis of Payment” Section of the specification.
 Within 30 Days of receipt of any payment from the Department, file a statement to the Department on a form
 furnished by the Department that all Subcontractors furnishing labor or Material have been paid the full sum due
 them at that stage of the Contract, except any funds withheld under the terms of the Contract as required by Chapter
 8, Title 17 of the Delaware Code, Annotated Revised 1974, and as amended.
 109.03 Compensation for Altered Quantities. When the accepted quantities of Work vary from the quantities in
 the Contract Schedule, accept payment at the original Contract Unit Prices for the accepted quantities of Work
 performed. No allowance will be made for any increased cost, except as provided in Sections 104.06, 104.07,
 104.08, and 108.11 and/or in any escalation clauses provided in the Contract Documents.
 
 109-2
 
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 
 SECTION 109
 
 109.04 Payment for Differing Site Conditions, Major Changes, Extra Work, and Force Account. When the
 Contract requires the Department to compensate the Contractor for Differing Site Conditions, changes to the
 Contract, and/or Extra Work, (collectively called “Changed Work” in this Section) the Department and the
 Contractor shall jointly choose one of the following methods to calculate the compensation owed to the Contractor:
 A. Perform the Changed Work at Contract Unit Prices;
 B. Renegotiate the Unit Prices for the Changed Work;
 C. Negotiate a lump sum payment for the Changed Work;
 Should negotiated new prices or renegotiated existing price(s) involve Work to be performed by a Subcontractor, the
 Contractor’s total allowable mark-up on the subcontracted portion of the Work shall not exceed 10 percent of the
 Subcontractor’s proposed price. Upon request by the Department, submit documentation substantiating the price of
 the Subcontractor’s proposed Work.
 Should the Engineer and the Contractor fail to agree on a method of compensation for Changed Work, the Engineer
 may direct the Contractor to perform the Changed Work, provided that the Changed Work is within the scope of the
 Contract. When the Contractor performs Changed Work at the direction of the Engineer, the Work is called “Force
 Account Work” and the Contractor will be compensated following the procedure set forth below.
 D. Perform the Changed Work on a time and material basis using the rules for “Force Accounts” described
 below to determine payment.
 Prior to starting Force Account Work, the Engineer and the Contractor must meet to determine the labor,
 Equipment and Materials that are necessary to perform the Work. The Engineer will make the final
 determination concerning what labor, Equipment and Materials are necessary. The Contractor must follow
 the direction of the Engineer when performing the Force Account Work. Force Account Work is to be
 compensated in the following manner except as further provided in Section 105.15:
 1.
 
 Labor. Receive as compensation the rate of wage (or scale) actually paid as shown on its certified
 payrolls for each and every hour that necessary labor and foremen are actually engaged in the Force
 Account Work. Superintendents, general foreman, or other general supervisors of the Force Account
 Work are compensated by the overhead markup in Section (7.) below and are not paid as labor.
 Receive as compensation the actual costs paid to, or on behalf of, workers by reason of health and
 welfare benefits or other benefits, when such amounts are required by collective bargaining agreements
 or other employment contracts generally applicable to the classes of labor employed on the Work.
 
 2.
 
 Bond, Insurance, and Tax. For Bond premiums, property damage, liability, and workers
 compensation insurance premiums, unemployment insurance contributions, and social security taxes
 on the Force Account Work, receive the actual incremental cost thereof, necessarily and directly
 resulting from the Force Account Work. Furnish satisfactory evidence of the rate or rates paid for such
 Bond, insurance, and tax.
 
 3.
 
 Materials. The Department reserves the right to furnish such Materials as it deems advisable. Make
 no Claims for costs and markup on such Materials.
 Only Materials furnished by the Contractor and necessarily used in the performance of the Force
 Account Work will be paid under this Section. The cost of Contractor furnished Materials shall be the
 cost to the purchaser, whether Contractor, Subcontractor, or other forces from the supplier thereof,
 together with transportation charges actually paid by the purchaser, except as the following are
 applicable:
 a.
 
 If a cash or trade discount by the actual supplier is offered or available to the purchaser, credit that
 amount to the State notwithstanding the fact that such discount may not have been taken.
 
 109-3
 
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 
 4.
 
 SECTION 109
 
 b.
 
 If Materials are procured by the purchaser by any method which is not a direct purchase from a
 direct billing by the actual supplier to such purchaser, the cost of such Materials is the price paid
 to the actual supplier as determined by the Engineer plus the actual costs, if any, incurred in the
 handling of such Materials.
 
 c.
 
 If the Materials are obtained from a supply or source owned wholly or in part by the purchaser, the
 cost of such Materials shall not exceed the price paid by the purchaser for similar Materials
 furnished from said source on items or the current wholesale price for such Materials delivered to
 the job site, whichever price is lower.
 
 d.
 
 If the cost of such Materials is, in the opinion of the Engineer, excessive, then the cost of such
 Material is deemed to be the lowest current wholesale price at which such Materials are available
 in the quantities concerned delivered to the Project site, less any discounts as provided in a. above.
 
 e.
 
 If the Contractor does not furnish satisfactory evidence of the cost of such Materials from the
 actual supplier thereof, the cost will be determined in accordance with d. above.
 
 Equipment and Plant.
 Use only Equipment that is, in the opinion of the Engineer, in good operating condition. Specifically
 describe the Equipment used when documenting such Equipment for payment. Use Equipment of
 suitable size and suitable capacity required for the Work to be performed. In the event the Contractor
 elects to use Equipment of a higher rental or payment value than that suitable for the Work, payment
 will be made at the rate applicable to the suitable Equipment. The Engineer will determine the
 suitability of the Equipment. If there is a differential in the rate of pay of the operator of oversize or
 higher rate Equipment, the rate paid for the operator is to be that for the suitable Equipment.
 a.
 
 Contractor-Owned Equipment and Plant. The hourly rates for Contractor-owned Equipment and
 plant will be determined from the applicable volume of the Rental Rate Blue Book (referred to
 hereafter as the "Blue Book"), published by Machinery Information Division of K-III Directory
 Corporation, 1735 Technology Drive, Suite 410, San Jose, CA 95110. These provisions apply to
 the Equipment and plant owned directly by the Contractor or by entities which are divisions,
 affiliates, subsidiaries, or in any other way related to the Contractor or its parent company. The
 Blue Book will be used in the following manner:
 i.
 
 The hourly rate will be determined by dividing the monthly rate by 176. The weekly, hourly,
 and daily rates will not be used.
 
 ii.
 
 The number of hours to be paid will be the number of hours that the Equipment or plant is
 actually used on a specific Force Account activity, not to exceed 176 hours per calendar
 month.
 
 iii. The current revisions to the Blue Book will be used in establishing rates. The current revision
 applicable to specific Force Account Work is as of the first Day of Work performed on that
 Force Account Work and that rate applies throughout the period the Force Account Work is
 being performed.
 iv. An area adjustment will be made. Equipment life adjustment will be made in accordance with
 the rate adjustment tables in the Blue Book. Charge overtime at the same rate indicated in i.
 above.
 v.
 
 The estimated operating costs per hour will be used for each hour that the Equipment or plant
 is in operation on the Force Account Work. Such costs do not apply to idle time regardless of
 the cause of the idleness.
 
 vi. Idle time for Equipment or plant will not be paid, except where the Equipment has been held
 on the Project site on a standby basis at the written request of the Engineer and, but for this
 request, would have left the Project site. Such payment will be made at one-half the rate
 
 109-4
 
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 
 SECTION 109
 
 established in i. and iv. above. Such payment will not exceed 8 hours in a Day and will not
 exceed 40 hours in a week.
 vii. The rates established above include the cost of fuel, oil, lubrication, supplies, attachments,
 repairs, overhaul and maintenance of any kind, depreciation, storage, overhead, profits,
 insurance, and all incidentals.
 viii. Operator costs are not included in this hourly rate for this Equipment or plant.
 In the event that a rate is not established in the Blue Book for a particular piece of Equipment or
 plant, the Engineer will establish a rate for that piece of Equipment or plant that is consistent with
 its cost and use in the industry.
 b.
 
 Rented Equipment and Plant. In the event that the Contractor does not own a specific type of
 Equipment and must obtain it by rental, inform the Engineer of the need to rent the Equipment and
 of the rental rate for that Equipment prior to using it on the Work. The Contractor will be paid the
 actual rental rate for the Equipment for the time that the Equipment is actually used to accomplish
 the Work, provided that rate is reasonable, plus the cost of moving the Equipment on to and away
 from the job if such moves are solely necessitated by the Force Account Work. For idle rental
 Equipment that must remain on the site because of a written directive from the Engineer and
 would have left the site but for that directive, the rented Equipment will be paid at the rental rate
 established above, not to exceed 8 hours per Day and not to exceed 40 hours per week. In no case
 will the Department pay the Contractor for equipment costs in excess of the actual cost paid by the
 Contractor for the rental. Provide a copy of the paid receipt or canceled check for the rental
 expense incurred.
 
 5.
 
 Miscellaneous. No allowance will be made for: general superintendence; the use of tools whose Blue
 Book value is less than $1,500.00; or other costs for which no specific allowance is herein provided.
 
 6.
 
 Profit. Profit shall be computed at 5 percent of the following:
 
 7.
 
 a.
 
 Total Material cost (bare cost not including FOB).
 
 b.
 
 Total direct labor cost (actual hours worked multiplied by regular hourly rate and benefits) as
 provided by Section 109.04.D.1.
 
 Overhead. Overhead is defined to include the following:
 a.
 
 All salaries and expenses of executive officers, supervising officers, or supervising employees and
 all home office expenses;
 
 b.
 
 All clerical or stenographic employees;
 
 c.
 
 All charges for minor Equipment, such as tools whose Blue Book value is less than $1,500.00,
 including, but not limited to, shovels, picks, axes, saws, bars, sledges, lanterns, jacks, cables, pails,
 wrenches, and other miscellaneous supplies and services; and
 
 d.
 
 All drafting room accessories such as paper, tracing cloth, and blueprinting.
 
 Overhead costs for Force Account Work will be computed at 10 percent of the following:
 a.
 
 Total Material cost (bare cost not including FOB).
 
 b.
 
 Total direct labor cost (actual hours Worked multiplied by the regular hourly rate) and benefits as
 provided by Section 109.04.D.1.
 
 c.
 
 Total Equipment and plant cost.

 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 d.
 
 SECTION 109
 
 Specific extraordinary overhead expenses, such as hiring of additional supervisory personnel or
 the use of a special type of minor Equipment (as defined above), which the Contractor has to
 purchase specifically for the Force Account, may be allowed. In such instances, the Contractor
 will be paid only the reasonable costs of such extraordinary overhead expenses provided the
 Engineer has agreed to such costs prior to their being incurred.
 
 8.
 
 Subcontracting. For administration costs in connection with approved subcontract Work, receive an
 amount equal to 10 percent for Work up to $100,000.00 and 5 percent for Work exceeding $100,000 of
 the total of such Work completed as set forth in 1. through 4. above.
 
 9.
 
 Records. Maintain Force Account Records in such a manner as to provide a clear distinction between
 the direct costs of Work paid for on a Force Account basis and the costs of other operations.
 From the above records, furnish the Engineer completed daily Force Account Work reports for each
 Day's Work to be paid for on a Force Account basis. Sign and submit such reports daily. Detail the
 daily Force Account Work reports as follows:
 a.
 
 Name, classification, date, daily hours, total hours, rate, and extension for each laborer and
 foreman.
 
 b.
 
 Designation, dates, daily hours, total hours, rental rate (including a copy of the Blue Book pages
 used), and extension for each unit of machinery and Equipment.
 
 c.
 
 Quantities of Materials, prices, and extensions.
 
 d.
 
 Costs for transportation of Materials.
 
 e.
 
 Cost of property damage, liability, and workers compensation insurance premiums;
 unemployment insurance contributions; Bonds; and social security tax.
 
 Substantiate Material charges with valid copies of vendor's invoices. Submit such invoices with the daily Force
 Account Work reports, or, if not available that Day, submit them with subsequent daily Force Account Work
 reports. Should the vendor's invoices not be submitted within sixty (60) Days after the date of delivery of the
 Material, or within fifteen (15) Days after the Completion of the Work, whichever occurs first, the Engineer reserves
 the right to establish the cost of such Materials at the lowest current wholesale prices at which said Materials are
 available, in the quantities concerned delivered to the location of Work less any discounts provided in Section
 109.04.D.3.a.
 The Engineer will compare its records with the completed daily Force Account Work reports furnished by the
 Contractor and make any necessary adjustments. When these daily Force Account Work reports are agreed upon
 and signed by both parties, the reports become the basis of payment for the Work performed, but do not preclude
 subsequent Adjustment based on a later audit by the Department.
 Allow cost records pertaining to Work paid on a Force Account basis to be open to inspection or audit by
 representatives of the Department as provided in Section 105.15.K.
 
 109-6
 
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 
 SECTION 109
 
 109.05 Basis of Payment for Fixed Quantity Items. When indicated on the Plans, Bid Proposal and/or the
 Specifications, certain Items will be paid on an estimated fixed quantity Item basis. Where this occurs, the method
 of measurement and basis of payment indicated in these Specifications is modified for such Items as identified in
 this Section.
 When estimated fixed quantities are indicated, the only quantities for which payment will be made are the estimated
 quantities as shown in the Proposal at the Unit Bid Prices, except in certain situations described below in (A), (B)
 and (C) of this Section.
 When bidding, check the estimates provided in the Contract Documents and appraise the actual amount of labor,
 Equipment, or Material required to complete the Work in accordance with the Plans and Specifications. No
 allowance will be made or Claims considered for any quantities used in completing the Work in excess of those
 given in the Proposal unless:
 A. The Contractor encounters a Differing Site Condition that causes the estimated fixed quantity to change;
 B. The Engineer adds or deletes Work to the Contract that increases or decreases a fixed quantity Item; or
 C. The Contractor contests the fixed quantity and can show that the actual quantity of the Work performed is
 more than 25 percent of the estimated fixed quantity.
 When Differing Site Conditions cause an estimated fixed quantity to change, the Engineer will adjust the payment in
 accordance with Section 104.07 of these Specifications. When the Engineer adds or deletes Work, the actual
 quantity of Work that is added or deleted will be added to or deleted from the estimated fixed quantity. If estimated
 fixed quantity Items are deleted completely, no payment will be made.
 In cases where a fixed quantity is contested by the Contractor, provide necessary measurements and computations to
 support a change in the quantity. If the change is verified and approved by the Engineer and the error in the
 estimated fixed quantity exceeds 25 percent, the Contractor will be compensated at the Unit Bid Price for the actual
 quantity of Work performed under the Item.

 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 
 SECTION 109
 
 109.06 Eliminated Items. Should any Items contained in the Contract be found unnecessary for the Completion of
 the Work, the Engineer may, upon written order to the Contractor, eliminate the Items from the Contract. The
 elimination of these Items will not invalidate the Contract. When the Contractor is notified of the elimination of
 Items, the Contractor will be reimbursed for the actual Work performed and all direct expenses incurred in
 preparation for the eliminated Item as calculated by the Force Account procedure outlined in these Specifications.
 Reimbursement of Materials actually purchased prior to notification of the elimination of Items will be paid at the
 actual cost of the Materials plus 15 percent (overhead and profit). Such Materials will become the property of the
 Department. In no event will reimbursement for an eliminated Item exceed the Bid Price of the Contract Item.
 Also, in no case will the Contractor be reimbursed for the loss of anticipated profit.
 109.07 Estimates; Retainage. The Engineer will once in each month make an estimate, in writing, of the total
 amount of Work performed on the Contract and the value of the completed Work to the date of the estimate. Five
 percent of the value of the Work performed as indicated by the estimate may be retained as security for fulfillment
 of the Contract until a total of 5 percent of the total bid price has been retained. Securities may be substituted for
 this retainage in accordance with Section 6962, Chapter 69, Title 29 of the Delaware Code and as amended.
 Payment of estimates, except final estimates, will not exceed those shown on the Proposal except those authorized
 by Change Order. No such estimates or payments will be made when, in the judgment of the Engineer, the Work is
 not proceeding in accordance with the provisions of the Contract or when, in the Engineer's judgment, the total value
 to the Work performed since the last estimate amounts to less than $3,000.00. The Engineer, if it deems it expedient
 to do so, may cause estimates to be made more frequently than one in each month and payments thereon to be made
 more frequently to the Contractor.
 109.08 Payment for Stored Material. When approved by the Engineer, estimates may include an allowance for
 the value of tested and acceptable Materials of a non-perishable or non-contaminative nature which have been
 produced or furnished in a condition ready for incorporation as a permanent part of Work yet to be completed,
 provided the following terms and conditions are met:
 A. Request. The request for payment allowance for properly stored Materials must be in writing, accompanied
 by an itemized inventory statement, written consent of the Surety, and an invoice or purchase order on the
 supplier’s letterhead documenting the cost of the Materials. No payment allowance will be permitted for
 amounts less than $25,000.00 for each Material of a qualifying Contract Item.
 B. Materials. An allowance of 100 percent of the cost to the Contractor for Materials, not to exceed 90
 percent of the Contract Item price, may be made when such Material is delivered and stockpiled or stored
 in accordance with the requirements specified in the Contract Documents.
 Prior to such allowance, all such Material shall have been tested and found acceptable to the Engineer.
 Payment will not be allowed in excess of the Unit Bid Price of the quantity required for the Contract. Base
 the required quantity on the Contract bid quantities and approved revisions.
 C. Excluded Materials. No allowance will be made for fuels, form lumber, Falsework, temporary Structures,
 or for other Materials of any kind which will not become an integral part of the finished construction.
 No allowance will be made for cement, aggregate, sand, seed, plants, fertilizer, or other perishable or
 contaminative items, nor for Materials which, in the opinion of the Engineer, have an unacceptable shelf
 life or an environmental, or safety restriction.
 D. Storage. Store all Materials in an approved manner and in areas where damage is not likely to occur.
 Dedicate the stored Material to the Project.
 When Materials cannot be practically stored within the limits of the Project, the Engineer may approve the
 storage of Materials on private property or, for structural members, in the manufacturer's or fabricator's
 yard. Requests for payment for such Material stored outside the limits of the Project shall be accompanied
 by a release from the owner and/or tenant of such property or yard agreeing to permit the removal of the
 Materials from the property without cost to the State.
 E. Materials Inventory. Materials shall be available for inspection and inventory at the storage site by the
 Engineer or the Engineer’s authorized representative at all times.

 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 F.
 
 SECTION 109
 
 Materials Measurement and Payment. The method of measurement for Materials shall be in units which
 are easily inventoried and acceptable to the Engineer. Payment allowance for Materials will be included in
 the progress estimate as a new and separate Item and will be subject to retainage provisions. Submit proof
 of payment to the Engineer prior to processing the next progress estimate in the form of a paid invoice from
 the Material supplier. Failure to submit proof of payment prior to the processing of the progress payment
 will result in the deduction of the applicable Material payment in its entirety from progress payments until
 such time as the proof of payment is received by the Engineer. As the Materials are incorporated into the
 Project and the Work is paid under the applicable Unit Price(s), an equal percentage of the Material
 allowance will be deducted from progress estimates until 100 percent of the allowance has been deducted.
 At the conclusion of the Work for which the Materials are required, the cost of Materials remaining in
 storage for which payment allowance has been made will be deducted from the progress estimate.
 
 109.09 Withholding of Money Due on an Estimate to Offset a Contractor’s Liability. Whenever Liquidated
 Damages are assessable, such damages will be deducted from the monthly and final estimate. The payment of any
 current or final estimate or of any retained percentage shall in no way affect the obligation of the Contractor to
 repair or renew any defective parts of the construction and to be responsible for all damage due to such defects.
 If at any time there is evidence of any lien or Claim for which, if established, the Department might become liable,
 and which is chargeable to the Contractor, the Department will have the right to retain out of any payment then due
 or to become due an amount sufficient to completely indemnify the Department against such lien or Claim. If there
 should prove to be any such Claim after all payments are made, refund to the Department all monies that the
 Department may be compelled to pay in discharging any lien made obligatory in consequence of the Contractor's
 neglect or default.
 Upon Substantial Completion of the Work under the Contract, the Engineer may release 60 percent of the amount
 then retained. The balance of the amount retained will be held until all reports required of the Contractor are
 received and final payment is authorized by the Department. The Department may, at its option, retain temporarily
 or permanently a smaller amount and may cause the Contractor to be paid temporarily or permanently, from time to
 time, such portion of the amount retained as it deems equitable.
 No provision contained in these Specifications shall be construed as creating any debt, liability or obligation on the
 part of the State or Department to any Subcontractor, supplier, or materialman.
 109.10 Final Payment; Time Limit to Challenge Quantities. The Engineer will, as soon as practicable after the
 Completion of the Contract, make a final estimate of the Work performed and the value of such Work, and the
 Department will pay the entire sum found to be due after deducting from all previous payments all amounts to be
 kept and all amounts to be retained under the provisions of the Contract. All prior partial estimates and payments
 will be subject to correction in the final estimate payment. Give notice to the Engineer of any alleged errors in the
 payment of Contract quantities. Such notice must be given to the Engineer within 120 Calendar Days of the date
 when the Engineer gives the Contractor notice that the Contract’s quantities have been finalized. Failure to notify
 the Engineer within this time frame constitutes a waiver of the Contractor’s right to contest the quantities. Nothing
 in this Section serves to preclude the Engineer from performing audits of its own records or the Contractor’s records
 and to adjust payment based on such audits in accordance with other provisions in the Specifications.
 The acceptance by the Contractor of the final estimate operates as and is a release to the State, the Department, the
 Secretary, and its agents from all Claims of liability under the Contract, or for anything done or furnished or relating
 to the Work under the Contract, or for any act or neglect of the State, the Department, the Secretary, or its agents
 relating to or connected with the Contract.
 109.11 Source of Supply and Carrier Rates on Construction Materials. Bidders must fully inform themselves as
 to the source of supply of acceptable Materials needed for the Work and in regard to the carrier rates and
 transportation facilities for these Materials before submitting Proposals.
 Inability to secure satisfactory Materials from the source upon which the bid was based, or changes in carrier, or the
 alteration of transportation facilities for these Materials during the life of the Contract, shall not constitute cause for
 a Claim for extra compensation.
 109.12 Transportation Tax Exemption. Base all Unit Prices on exemption from any transportation tax for which
 the State is, by law, exempt on Materials entering into and forming a part of the Project.

 the Right-Of-Way or from outside excavation limits. Make arrangements and pay all costs involved in procuring
 borrow. Allow the Engineer to cross-section after stripping and before use. Furnish a certified hazardous waste site
 assessment for borrow areas located off the Right-Of-Way. Provide an alternate borrow source or conduct more
 detailed testing in suspect locations.
 Use suitable and available common and rock excavation before using borrow Material.
 Obtain approval to use borrow in lieu of on-site excavation. Grade borrow areas uniformly to drain.
 202.03.8 Unsuitable Excavation. The Engineer will consider excavation unsuitable if it contains deposits of
 saturated or unsaturated soil mixtures or organic matter unacceptable for Embankment Material.
 Remove unsuitable material encountered in the subgrade. Excavate to the specified depth or as directed by the
 Engineer. Backfill and compact with approved Material as specified in Section 202.03.10.
 Dispose of material that cannot be properly stabilized and compacted as specified in Section 202.03.1.
 202.03.9 Undercut Excavation.
 A. General. This Work consists of excavation to correct unstable subgrades and Embankment foundations and
 the disposal of such excavated material.
 B. Materials. All material removed in the work of undercut excavation will be classified unsuitable and shall be
 disposed of, unless otherwise directed.
 C. Equipment. Use Equipment for undercutting and backfilling operations capable of removing and replacing the
 material within the area established by the Engineer. Equipment that will displace the underlying or adjacent
 material will not be permitted.
 D. Preparation. When unstable subgrade or foundation conditions are encountered, all normal construction
 preparation procedures shall be performed to correct the unstable situation before undercutting will be
 considered. Allow sufficient time to elapse to accurately judge the success of the preparation effort after
 performing these normal preparation procedures. These normal construction preparation procedures shall
 include, but are not limited to, cutting channels and ditches in order to lower the water table, grading to prevent
 excessive surface water from entering the subgrade or foundation materials, performing all reasonable efforts to
 correct the moisture content to within Specifications, and using properly sized Equipment in such a way that
 does not overload the subgrade or foundations. Interpretation of "normal", "sufficient", and "reasonable", shall
 be made by the Engineer.
 In lieu of following the above established preparation requirements, or following the required construction methods, or
 waiting over a reasonable time for the environmental conditions to improve, the Contractor may elect to replace the
 subgrade or foundation material as a means of correcting instability.
 E. Undercutting. When the Engineer determines that undercutting is required, the Engineer will direct the
 Contractor to remove the material from within defined areas to defined depths. Before backfilling, additional
 depths of undercutting below the original defined depth may be required in some areas as directed by the
 Engineer.
 Upon acceptance of the undercut excavation, backfill and compact the area in accordance with this Section, or

 placing and compacting approved Embankment Material within roadway areas to replace unsuitable
 material; and placing and compacting Embankment Material in cavities and other depressions within the
 roadway area.
 1.
 
 Haul Roads. Do not construct any haul roads across State owned property or within the limits of the
 Contract unless approved in advance. Maintain haul roads for the duration of the Project. Remove
 haul roads, including all materials placed, at the end of the Project and restore area to its native
 condition. Haul roads will not be permitted through wetland areas which fall outside the Limits of
 Construction unless approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or the DNREC, or both, as
 applicable.
 
 2.
 
 Dust Control. Adequately control dust, exclusively by water, at all times during the earth-moving
 operations.
 
 3.
 
 Stability. Assume responsibility for the stability of Embankment. Replace Embankment that, in the
 Engineer’s judgment, has been damaged or displaced due to the following: carelessness or negligence,
 natural causes such as storms and floods, shrinkage of Embankment Material, and all other reasons not
 attributable to movement of the natural ground upon which Embankment is placed.
 Compact lifts in Embankment areas, other than rock, as specified below. The Department will perform
 compaction and/or moisture tests once the stability of the lift is tested by the Contractor per Section
 202.03.10.J and approved by the Engineer. Compliance will be determined by the Department with
 field compaction tests performed in accordance with the following AASHTO test methods:
 a.
 
 AASHTO T 191. Express field density tests as a percentage of the maximum density made on the
 same soils;
 
 b.
 
 AASHTO T 99 Method C, Modified, for determination of maximum density and optimum
 moisture content;
 i. Moisten or dry and thoroughly mix to the proper moisture content before compaction if the soil
 moisture content is not within 2 percent of optimum;
 
 Do not use frozen Embankment Material or place Embankment Material on frozen ground. Do not
 place rocks, broken concrete, and other solid materials in Embankment areas designated for placing or
 driving piles.
 B. Equipment. Provide sufficient Equipment to grade, level, and promptly compact after depositing
 Embankment Material. Cease placement of Material when the capacity of the grading and compacting
 Equipment is inadequate for the rate of compacting, excavation, or placing of Embankment.
 1.
 
 Use approved rollers, compactors, or other suitable compaction Equipment provided all Equipment is
 configured and operated to meet the requirements specified.
 
 C. Preparation of Embankment Areas. Remove unsuitable material before constructing Embankment.

 EXCAVATION AND EMBANKMENT
 
 SECTION 202
 
 accommodate placing and compacting Equipment. Begin all horizontal cuts at the intersection of the
 ground line and the vertical side of the previous bench. Step existing slopes to keep the Embankment from
 wedging against Structures. Compact excavation from benching with the new Embankment Material.
 Where the height of the Embankment at the subgrade level is to be 5 feet or less, remove all organic matter
 from the existing ground surface. Scarify the cleared surface to a minimum depth of 6 inches. Compact to
 the specified Embankment density. Where the height of the Embankment is to be greater than 5 feet, disc
 all remaining sod thoroughly before constructing Embankment.
 Scarify existing roadways containing granular material within 3 feet of the subgrade to a depth of 6 inches.
 Compact to the specified Embankment density.
 D. Placement. Place Material in successive lifts; place each lift in a level, uniform cross-section no greater
 than 8 inches loose measurement, unless directed otherwise by the Engineer. Deposit and spread lifts
 across the full width of the Embankment, parallel to the roadway centerline. If required, disc each lift to
 ensure uniform distribution of moisture and component Materials. Properly compact each lift, as specified,
 before starting the next lift. Do not place Embankment on any wet, unstable, or frozen materials.
 1.
 
 The Engineer may direct that the first lift of Embankment be placed at a depth greater than 8 inches
 loose measurement in specific Embankment areas when permitted by the soil conditions encountered.
 Place all subsequent lifts as specified above.
 
 2.
 
 Proof roll all lifts of soil, aggregate, or soil mixtures according to the requirements of Section
 202.03.10.J. Correct any instability evidenced during the proof roll by discing, aerating, recompacting,
 removing, or replacing the Material. After corrective measures, proof roll to verify the stability of the
 lift is as required.
 
 3.
 
 At the end of each Day during Embankment placement construct edge berms, interceptor berms, and
 Embankment slopes as required. Extend temporary slope drains to connect to edge and interceptor
 berms.
 
 E. Embankment Adjacent to Structures. Compact Embankment in accordance with Section 207.

 EXCAVATION AND EMBANKMENT
 
 SECTION 202
 
 H. Rock Embankment. Place rock Embankments in lifts equal to the average rock dimension. Restrict
 maximum rock dimension to 36 inches. Distribute spalls and finer rock fragments to level and smooth each
 lift. Place succeeding lifts to not damage previously completed lifts. Dump rock on the lift being
 constructed, and push into place. Do not construct rock lifts within 24 inches of finished subgrade.
 Place at least 24 inches of compacted Embankment over Structures before placing rock. Drain pockets left
 in the surface of rock before backfilling.
 I.
 
 Preparation of Subgrade. Shape subgrade for its full width to required grade and cross section. Scarify the
 top 6 inches of the subgrade and increase or decrease moisture content to achieve the specified density and
 stability. Compact to maximum density to allow placement of base or surface course Material without
 rutting or displacing the roadbed. Scarify, dry, reshape, and re-compact Material if construction Equipment
 on Embankments causes movement, rutting, or displacement of the Material, and test for density and
 moisture requirements.
 Provide and maintain temporary ditches from the cut for the Pavement Structure to the side ditches at
 intervals necessary to permit drainage of the subgrade. Provide and maintain all facilities necessary for
 complete drainage of the construction area. Provide sediment and erosion control measures for all water
 drained or pumped from the subgrade in accordance with Contract Documents.
 Do not place subbase or base Materials until the subgrade has been approved by the Engineer.
 The Engineer will determine maximum density according to AASHTO T 99 Method C Modified and inplace field density according to AASHTO T 191 or T 310.
 Ensure the finished subgrade surface is smooth and conforms to prescribed elevations before constructing
 the base or surface course. Limit the maximum variation from the subgrade elevation to the prescribed
 elevation to plus or minus ½-inch.
 Correct all finished sections damaged during construction operations at no cost to the Department.
 1.
 
 Cut Section. Properly shape and uniformly and thoroughly compact the subgrade in conformity with
 the lines and grades shown on the Contract Documents or as established in the field and approved by
 the Engineer before placement of any subbase, base, or surfacing Material. Boulders, large rocks,
 muck, vegetation, or other materials that would prove detrimental to the stability of the roadway will
 not be permitted in the subgrade. Fill with suitable Material depressions that develop during the
 rolling re-roll; repeat until no depressions develop or remain in the subgrade.
 a.
 
 2.
 
 J.
 
 Where excavation to the finished graded section results in a subgrade or slopes of unsuitable
 material, the Engineer may require the Contractor to remove the unsuitable material and backfill to
 the finished graded section with approved Material in accordance with Section 202.03.8. Conduct
 operations so that the Engineer can take necessary cross-sectional measurements before the
 backfill is placed.
 
 Fill Section. Before placement of any base Material, complete the subgrade and adjacent shoulder or
 slope rounding earthwork to finished grade elevation to form a box to retain the base Material. Do not
 place base Material in a section where a box is not complete unless specifically approved by the
 Engineer.
 
 Proof Rolling. Perform proof rolling with a fully loaded, ten-wheel dump truck or other Equipment
 approved by the Engineer.
 1.
 
 Acceptance of the proof roll by the Engineer is required before subsequent lifts can be placed.
 
 2.
 
 No compaction tests will be taken until the stability of the lift is deemed stable by the Engineer.
 
 3.
 
 Run the Equipment longitudinally until the unrolled area between tire strips is less than 18 inches.
 
 4.
 
 Scarify, disc, aerate, or add moisture, and recompact the subgrade to the extent necessary to achieve
 stability when proof rolling shows the subgrade to be unstable.
 
 K. Compaction Procedure. Start compaction or rolling at the edges, progress toward the center of the
 
 202 - 6
 
 EXCAVATION AND EMBANKMENT
 
 SECTION 202
 
 Embankment. Continue compaction until each lift is thoroughly and uniformly compacted to the full width
 of the Embankment and to 95-percent or more of the maximum density of the same soils as determined by
 AASHTO T 99 Method C, Modified.
 1.
 
 The ordinary use of trucks, carryalls, scrapers, tractors, or other construction Equipment may be
 considered as rolling as long as the traffic of hauling Equipment is evenly distributed over the fill to
 make the best use of the compaction provided by construction Equipment.
 
 2.
 
 Build all areas of sharp depressions, trench backfills, and around Culverts, Bridges, and walls,
 inaccessible to the specified methods of compaction, in continuous uniform horizontal lifts no greater
 than 8 inches loose measurement. Compact to the specified density before placing the next lift.
 
 3.
 
 Compact properly broken rock, bituminous Material, or Portland cement concrete with a minimum of
 six passes of an approved roller or as directed.
 
 202.04 Method of Measurement.
 The quantity of excavation will be measured by the cubic yard. The volume may be computed by the method of
 average end areas measured by cross-sections taken at regular intervals and at breaks in grade, comparison of
 surveyed electronic surfaces, or other means as approved by the Engineer. All excavation, except topsoil, will be
 measured in its original position. Topsoil will be measured in its original position or in a stockpile after excavation,
 at the discretion of the Engineer. Topsoil removed from fill areas may be stockpiled separately for the crosssectioning or may be measured by cross-sectioning the area of removal before and after topsoil stripping is
 performed. Excess excavation generated by the Contractor that the Engineer has directed to be stockpiled for use at
 a later date will not be measured. Excess excavation generated by others will be measured by the cubic yard in the
 stockpile.
 Embankment will not be measured.
 When Item 202000 is indicated in the Contract Documents as a fixed quantity, measurement and payment shall be in
 accordance with Section 109.05.
 The quantity of undercut excavation will be measured in cubic yards computed by the average end area method. When
 directed by the Engineer, the correction of an unstable subgrade or embankment foundation caused by in-place material

 209.01 Description. This work consists of furnishing and placing additional Material from approved borrow areas or
 other approved sources when suitable Material available within the Right-Of-Way is not sufficient in quantity for
 construction purposes. This Work includes all clearing, grubbing, or stripping required to prepare the borrow area for
 cross-sectioning and excavating. This Work also consists of furnishing borrow for use as backfill in utility trenches.
 209.02 Materials. Provide Materials as specified in:
 Borrow
 
 Section 1001
 
 209.03 Construction.
 209.03.1 Borrow Sources. Notify the Department’s Materials and Research Section at least ten (10) Working Days in
 advance of Material being removed from any borrow source so that samples may be obtained and tested prior to use.
 Submit for approval by the Department’s Materials and Research Section, the limits of the approved Material within the
 borrow source and the method of excavation. Clear and grub the ground surface in the manner described in Section 201
 and strip of all unsuitable material, as determined by the Engineer, before the excavation of any borrow. Excavation of
 borrow within 100 feet of the right-of-way lines is not permitted, except with written permission from the Engineer.
 Secure any borrow source that is tested, approved and cross-sectioned for excavation by means of physical control. The
 method of control is dependent on the conditions at the source, but may consist of complete or partial fencing, earth
 berms, guardrails, or other physical barriers. Provide secure access at the entrance to the borrow source with a gate,
 chain, cable or other acceptable device and secure by padlock. The key to the padlock will be retained by the
 Department, once the security method is approved.
 Submit a physical control plan to the Engineer after the borrow source has been tested and approved, and the overburden
 removed. The physical control plan must be implemented and approved before the source is cross-sectioned. Upon
 completion of excavation, trim and leave the borrow area in a neat condition to permit accurate measurement. Water is
 not permitted to collect or stand within the excavated borrow area, where practicable.
 209.03.2 Source Testing. The Department will assist the Contractor in determining the quality and quantity of Material
 from sources the Contractor proposes to use. The Department will perform soil analysis tests on one boring for each 500
 cubic yards of borrow.
 209.03.3 Placing and Compacting. All borrow under this Section shall be placed and compacted in accordance with
 the requirements of Section 202.03.10.
 209.03.4 Pipe and Utility Backfill. For pipe and utility trenches within the roadway, backfill with Material
 conforming to the requirements of Section 1001, Borrow Type C. Use existing Material for backfill if it meets the
 requirements of Section 1001, Borrow Type C. For these areas, backfill Material to a compaction of 95-percent or more
 of the maximum density according to the requirements of Section 202.03.10. Backfill pipe and utility trenches outside
 the roadway with Material conforming to the requirements of Section 1001, Borrow Type C, to a height of 12 inches
 above the top of the pipe or utility, unless directed otherwise. Backfill the remaining depth of these trenches with
 existing Material, unless otherwise directed. For these areas, backfill Material to a compaction of 95 percent or more of
 the maximum density according to the requirements of Section 202.03.10.
 Furnish backfill Material for pipe and utility trenches. Stockpile Materials at location(s) mutually agreed upon by the
 Contractor, the utility, and the Engineer.
 Coordinate with the utility organizations the operation of backfilling utility trenches. Backfilling utility trenches is to be
 performed by the respective utility organizations involved and in conformance to the requirements of Section 202.03.10
 except proof rolling will not be required.
 Utility companies will be required to remove all excess excavation Material directly related to the utility trenching from
 the Project, unless the Engineer directs it to be used by the Contractor as part of the Project.
 209.04 Method of Measurement. For all sizes, the quantity for pipe and utility borrow Material will be measured as
 the volume of excavation included between a line from the bottom of plan excavation to the bottom of the pipe at the
 
 209 - 1
 
 BORROW
 
 SECTION 209
 
 time of placement, and a normal horizontal measurement outside of the pipe or utility dimension plus a neat line 18
 inches each side, excluding rock excavation.
 The quantity of borrow Material will be measured in cubic yards of approved and acceptable borrow Material. The
 volume will be measured at the source, in its original position by cross-sections and computed by the method of average
 end areas, exclusive of the volume of overburden or stripping.
 When requested by the Contractor and approved by the Department in writing, borrow Material, which is specified to be
 measured in cubic yards, may alternatively be weighed and the weight converted to cubic yards. Factors for conversion
 from weight measurement to volumetric measurement will be determined by the Engineer and shall be agreed to by the
 Contractor, before the method is used.
 Where the Engineer determines it to be impracticable to obtain weight-volume conversion factors for the borrow types
 specified, 3050 pounds of borrow will be considered equivalent to one cubic yard.
 Unless stated otherwise, all borrow Material that is to be measured by weight shall be calculated as specified in Section
 109.01.
 209.05 Basis of Payment. The quantity of borrow will be paid for at the Contract Unit Price per cubic yard. Price and
 payment will constitute full compensation for clearing, grubbing, stripping, securing the borrow source, excavating,
 hauling, placing, and compacting the borrow Material and for all labor, Equipment, tools, and incidentals required to
 complete the Work. Placing and compacting the borrow Material are not included in the furnishing borrow for pipe
 and utility trench Items as that responsibility will be on the respective utility company.

 SECTION 401
 
 DIVISION 400 – BITUMINOUS MATERIALS
 SECTION 401 – BITUMINOUS PAVEMENT
 401.01 Description.
 Construct one or more courses of bituminous pavement on either a prepared foundation or an existing surface
 course. Construct butt joints by saw cutting and removing the existing hot-laid bituminous concrete or Portland
 cement concrete pavement to provide an area to butt the new hot-laid bituminous concrete pavement against the
 existing pavement.
 401.02 Materials.
 Provide Materials as specified in:
 Asphalt Cement
 
 Section 1012
 
 Asphalt Production
 
 Section 1014
 
 Tack Coat*
 
 Section 1011
 * For Thin-Lift items: PG64-22
 
 Release Agents
 
 Section 1010
 
 Joint Sealant
 
 Section 1042
 
 401.03 Construction.
 Prior to paving, conduct a pre-paving meeting to discuss joint layout, Material delivery, striping layout, maintenance of
 traffic for paving, and Equipment. Include the Engineer, the Department’s Materials and Research Section, and any
 other pertinent parties.
 A. Mix Design. Develop job-mix formula (JMF) in accordance with Section 1014 Asphalt Production and submit
 test results for review a minimum of three (3) Days before application. Include aggregate type and gradation
 and percentages of polymer-modified emulsion, water, and cement by dry aggregate weight (mass).
 B. Delivery of Mixture. Minimum of 100 tons per hour delivered to the Project site.
 C. Hauling Equipment. Furnish trucks with tight, clean, smooth, metal beds which have been thinly coated
 with an emulsified oil, soap solution, or other approved release agent to prevent adherence of the
 bituminous mixture to the bed of the truck. Provide each truck with a securely fastened cover of canvas or
 other suitable waterproof material that covers the bed from front to back and over the sides. Fasten the front
 of the tarp securely to the body or protected by an air foil. Provide at least three straps to a side and two
 straps on the back to prevent the cover from ballooning up, to protect the mixture from the weather, and to
 prevent heat loss. Do not remove any loads late in the day that spreading and compacting of the mixture
 cannot be completed by sunset unless approval for nighttime paving has been granted by the Engineer.
 D. Paver. Self-propelled unit with automated screed or strike-off assembly that automatically controls grade
 leveling and slope, heated, and capable of spreading and finishing bituminous pavement Materials in lane
 widths specified. Equip with an attachment that confines the Material at the end of the gate and extrudes the
 asphalt Material in such a way results in a compacted wedge shape pavement edge (safety edge) of 32 degrees
 (+/- 2 degrees). Stopping the paver unit so that the attachment can be adjusted at cross roads, driveways, and
 obstructions is not permitted.
 E. Rollers. Self-propelled, static and/or vibratory steel wheel type equipped with scrapers, or pneumatic-tire
 oscillating type, equipped with smooth tires of equal size and diameter with a system for moistening each wheel
 or roller. Use number and weight of rollers sufficient to compact the mixture to the required density without
 crushing aggregate or displacing the mixture.
 F.
 
 Weather Limitations. Place bituminous pavement Materials only when the surface is dry, unfrozen, and the
 weather is not foggy or rainy. Presence of frost particles in the roadbed or on the surface is sufficient evidence
 401 - 1
 
 BITUMINOUS PAVEMENTS

 to prohibit placement.
 Do not permit placement of subsequent lifts or release open to traffic until the mat temperature is below 140
 degrees Fahrenheit.
 Placement of bituminous concrete is not permitted when the ambient air temperature at the location of the
 paving operation is below the temperatures indicated in Table 401-A below:

 G. Preparing Base or Existing Surface. Clear surface of debris. Apply and cure tack coat before placing the
 mixture. Apply a tack coat on all curbs, gutters, manholes, or other structure surfaces that will be in contact
 with the mixture.
 Repair damaged areas of the tacked surface, and restore the existing pavement or base to a uniform grade
 and cross section before placing the mix.
 H. Tack Coat. Apply on all dry and broom cleaned surfaces at a uniform rate of 0.05 gallons per square yard
 to 0.15 gallons per square yard at a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit to 160 degrees Fahrenheit using
 pressurized distributing Equipment with a spray bar or other approved distribution system. Apply in
 advance of the asphalt paving operation, but no further than is anticipated for the current day's operation.
 I.
 
 Placement. Place mixture in a continuous operation by paving machine methods of spreading and screeding to
 the thickness shown in the Contract Documents and conform to the grade and surface contour required.
 1.
 
 Outside edges of pavement are to be in true alignment, parallel to the centerline of the roadway with the
 longitudinal joint in the surface course at the lane line.
 
 2.
 
 When paving multiple lifts or courses, offset individual successive lifts a minimum of 6 inches.
 
 3.
 
 Place the base course with an approved paver or spreader in approximately equal layers of not less than
 3 inches and not to exceed 6 inches in depth after compaction. Submit for approval requests, if any,
 to use Type B Superpave in lieu of BCBC. If approved by the Engineer, the Type B Superpave may
 be placed in lifts of not less than 3 inches and not to exceed 6 inches in depth after compaction.
 The Type B Superpave placed in lieu of BCBC will be paid at the Contract Unit Price for BCBC and
 the Asphalt Cement Cost Adjustment will be based on the virgin asphalt of BCBC, not the Type B
 Superpave.
 After the bituminous concrete base course is placed, exposure is not permitted for a period longer than
 ten days. If, due to conditions of emergency, more than ten (10) Days elapse, uniformly spray a fog
 coat of CSS-l-h on the exposed base course before placing the wearing course of bituminous concrete.
 In addition, the Contractor shall plan the paving operation so that no bituminous base courses remain
 unsurfaced after the "winter shut-down" unless authorized by the Engineer.
 
 4.
 
 Carefully plan the placement of the surface course to ensure that the joints in the surface
 course will correspond with the proposed traffic lanes and will not be located in the wheel path of
 vehicles using the roadway. Locate longitudinal joints at the lane line (center and edge).
 Longitudinal joints must also be parallel to the centerline unless otherwise shown on the Plans.
 Place the longitudinal joint between the travel way and shoulder on the shoulder side of the lane
 line. Establish and follow reference lines or other approved markings to control the true alignment of
 the longitudinal joints.
 
 Take immediate action to correct unsatisfactory Work should unevenness of texture, tearing, or shoving
 occur during the paving operation due to unsatisfactory Material, methods, or Equipment.

 Pavement Construction - Tests and Evaluations.
 M. Joints. Seal all newly created pavement joints that will not be overlaid, with the exception of those created
 from placement of newly laid adjacent passes, with an approved joint sealant Material of appropriate
 dimensions in accordance with the Contract Documents. Construct joints to ensure surface and compaction
 requirements are met. Tack all vertical contact surfaces before placing any new mixture against the joint. For
 joint openings exceeding 1/4 inch width, the Engineer may require corrective action at no expense to the
 Department.
 1. For butt joints, saw cut and construct in accordance with Section 762 of the Contract Documents. Fill any
 saw cut beyond the limits shown on the Plans with approved sealant. Dispose of all Material removed
 for construction of the butt joint in accordance with Section 106.08.
 N. Surface Tolerances. Maximum deviation both longitudinal and transverse is 1/4 inch in 10 feet. Correct or
 remove areas exceeding these tolerances at no expense to the Department.
 401.04 Method of Measurement.
 The Engineer will measure the bituminous pavement Materials acceptably placed as specified in Section 109.01.
 The quantity of the safety edge will not be measured.
 401.05 Basis of Payment.
 Payment will be for the accepted quantity of bituminous pavement Materials at the Contract Unit Price per ton for
 furnishing, preparing, hauling, and placing all Materials, including tack coat and safety edge; for removing Material
 from around manholes, drainage inlets, valves, and similar features; for removing and replacing excess asphalt
 cement; and for all labor, Equipment, tools, and incidentals required to complete the Work.

 pavement surface and all exposed edges. Use a fully atomized mechanical sprayer equipped with a tank
 agitator and wind guard.
 
 G. Diamond Grinding – Provide self-propelled machines equipped with gang mounted diamond blades having
 a minimum cutting head width of 3 feet, capable of producing a “corduroy type” pavement surface texture
 consisting of parallel grooves between 3/32 inch and 5/32 inch wide and 1/16 inch deep. Fifty (50) to sixty
 (60) diamond blades per foot of cutting head are required.
 501.03.2.2. Construction Methods.
 A. Place and grade base course to the tolerance specified under the applicable Specification. No hardware
 may be placed on the grade until the Engineer has given approval.
 B. Furnish and install load transfer devices. Clearly mark, on both sides of the pavement, the center of each
 assembly using paint, stakes, or other agreed upon method so that the transverse sawed joints can be
 properly located. Construct load transfer assemblies in accordance with the Contract Documents. Apply a
 graphite coating to each dowel just prior to concrete placement if they are AASHTO M254, Type B (fusion
 bonded epoxy). No additional coating is required, if the approved dowels are AASHTO M254, Type A.
 Locate dowels at a pavement depth of T/2, (T = pavement thickness). Securely stake or otherwise fasten, in
 accordance with the Standard Construction Details, the load transfer device to the subgrade to prevent
 movement during concrete placement. Cut the tie wires on the dowel bar basket assembly. Do not use load
 transfer assemblies that are damaged in any way. Verify horizontal and vertical alignment of the devices
 not to exceed the tolerances as defined in the Standard Construction Details. Check initial dowel placement
 on grade with a template or other approved tool supplied by the Contractor for use by the Engineer.
 C. Furnish Hook Bolts (or W-Bolts) for use when lanes will longitudinally abut the pavement being placed,
 and #5 standard rebars for tie bars used under longitudinal sawed joints or for tying into concrete lanes
 placed under previous contracts. Install these items during or prior to concrete placement. The method of
 installation must be approved prior to beginning concrete placement.
 D. Install lines, wires, or other devices as needed for electronic grade control.
 E. Placing Concrete
 1.
 
 Minimize or eliminate stopping the forward movement of the paver. Sufficient number and proper
 scheduling of concrete delivery trucks is required in this regard.
 
 2.
 
 Maintain a vertical pavement edge. If necessary, use extra finishers, temporary forms, or trailing
 forms as part of the paver.
 
 3.
 
 Maintain a uniform level of concrete feeding the paver screed, allowing sufficient concrete to
 completely fill the void under the screed for the entire width of pavement placed. A roll of concrete
 covering approximately half of the distributing augers is desirable. Spreaders in advance of the paver
 may be used to control the concrete supplied to the paver.
 
 4.
 
 Wet the base course just prior to contact by the concrete using a hose or other spray device for uniform
 water application. The application rate should not cause any pooling of water on the grade.

 6.
 
 Build a transverse construction joint at the end of the day’s paving run in accordance with the
 previously approved details.
 
 7.
 
 Prior to placing adjoining concrete paving lanes or shoulders, seal the previously sawed joint opening
 along the edges of the existing concrete using duct tape, caulk, or other approved material to prevent
 stones or grout from entering the saw cut.
 
 8.
 
 When placing concrete in lanes adjoining previously constructed pavement, locate the full width of the
 paver tracks over the pavement with no overhang across the edge, in order to prevent breaking. Use
 rubber facing, wood, or other approved protection if the paver tracks will be in contact with the
 existing pavement surface. Concrete in the completed lane must have achieved a compressive strength
 of at least 2,000 pounds per square inch prior to placing any adjoining pavement.
 
 9.
 
 For small, irregular sections, or areas of pavement inaccessible to the paver:
 a.
 
 Use wooden or steel forms. Depth of the forms must be at least that of the required pavement
 thickness. Form faces shall not deviate from a true plane by any more that 1/8 inch in 10 feet.
 Provide pins or other bracing to prevent movement of the forms under the weight of the concrete.
 
 b.
 
 Place concrete directly onto a previously approved, moistened grade. Consolidate with hand
 vibrators paying particular attention to not dislodge the load transfer devices or have the vibrator
 come in contact with the forms.
 
 c.
 
 Finish with a pre-approved screed. Hand float or otherwise finish any areas as necessary. Pull a
 damp burlap drag longitudinally along the placement area. Texture and cure in accordance with
 Sections 501.03.4 and 501.03.5.
 
 d.
 
 If forms are stripped prior to five (5) Calendar Days following concrete placement, apply curing
 compound or extend other curing methods immediately, after patching any “honey-combed” areas,
 to completely cure the exposed edge. Forms must remain in place at least 12 hours following
 initial concrete placement, except for areas immediately adjacent to saw cut transverse joints.
 Forms at these joints must be removed when required in order to complete the saw cut through the
 entire pavement surface. Maintain curing methods in place until the full five (5) Days has elapsed
 or the compressive strength of the concrete has reached 2,000 pounds per square inch.
 
 10. Safety Edge – Construct a safety edge as specified in the Contract Documents. The safety edge is
 required longitudinally along the outermost pavement edge (generally a shoulder) on all mainline and
 ramp paving unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.

 Finishing
 1.
 
 Produce a smooth, uniform, concrete surface with the paver screed conforming to the specified
 pavement cross slope and width.
 
 2.
 
 Hand finishing is limited to sealing any surface tears, supporting any non-vertical pavement edges, and
 to assist in the surface finish of small, irregular, or other areas inaccessible to the paver. No steel
 trowels will be allowed for finishing surfaces.
 
 3.
 
 Finish all longitudinal pavement edges with a 1/4 inch rounded edging tool.
 
 4.
 
 Do not add surface water as an aid to finishing. If absolutely necessary, an evaporation retardant may
 be added through the use of a misting or fogging device approved prior to beginning paving
 operations. Water shaken from brushes or applied through a hose is not permitted.

 501 - 4
 
 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENT (PCCP)
 
 SECTION 501
 
 A. Use straight, metal forms having adequate strength to support the Equipment. Each section shall be a
 minimum of 10 feet in length. Use forms with a depth equal to or greater than the prescribed edge
 thickness of the concrete, a base width at least equal to the depth of the forms, but not required to exceed 8
 inches for deeper forms, and without a horizontal joint. Use flexible or curved forms of proper radius for
 curves of 150 foot radius or less, except approved straight forms of 5 foot lengths may be used for curves of
 a radius from 75 to 150 feet. Flexible or curved forms must be approved by the Engineer. The Engineer
 may approve the use of wood forms in areas requiring hand finishing [see Section 501.03.2.2.e.9)]. Secure
 the forms in place to withstand the impact and vibration of the consolidating and finishing Equipment
 without visible spring or settlement. Extend flange braces outward on the base a minimum of ⅔ the height
 of the form. Remove forms with battered top surfaces or bent, twisted, or broken forms. Do not use
 repaired forms until they have been inspected and approved by the Engineer. Do not use buildup forms,
 except where the total area of pavement of any specified thickness on the project is less than 2,000 square
 yards. Do not vary the top face of the form from a true plane more than ⅛ inch in 10 feet, and do not vary
 the vertical face of the form by more than ¼ inch. Make provisions for locking the ends of abutting form
 sections together tightly, and for secure setting.
 B. Supplementary Rails
 1.
 
 Provide suitable metal rails capable of being securely attached to the top of the side forms to provide a
 track that will allow spreading, finishing, and curing Equipment to back over the end of the previous
 day’s run.
 
 2.
 
 Ensure metal rail length is sufficient to accommodate all Equipment that must be backed out of the
 way. Also, ensure the rails are of such a height that all wheels and flanges of wheels will clear the
 previously placed concrete by at least 1/2 inch.
 
 C. Base Support - Provide a foundation under the forms so that the whole length of the form will be set firmly
 in contact with the grade.
 D. Form Setting - Set forms sufficiently in advance of the point where concrete is being placed so that line and
 grade may be checked. Stake forms into place with a minimum of 3 pins for each 10 foot section. Place a
 pin at each side of every joint. Tightly lock form sections to be free from play or movement in any
 direction. Do not deviate the form from true line by more than ¼ inch at any point. No excessive
 settlement or springing of forms is permitted from the weight of the finishing machine. Clean and oil forms
 before the placing of concrete.
 E. Grade and Alignment - Check the alignment and grade elevations of the forms immediately before placing
 the concrete and make any necessary corrections. When any form has been disturbed or any grade has
 become unstable, reset and recheck the form.
 F.
 
 Removing Forms - Do not remove forms from freshly placed concrete until it has set for a minimum of 12
 hours, except for auxiliary forms used temporarily in widened areas and forms against transverse saw cut
 joint locations. Remove forms carefully to avoid damage to the pavement.
 
 501.03.3.2. Equipment - Furnish and maintain all Equipment and tools for concrete batching, placement, finishing,
 curing, and texturing operations.
 A. In addition to the Equipment included in this Section, all Equipment listed under Section 501.03.2.1 is
 required except that Section 501.03.2.1.b is replaced with the following for fixed form paving:
 B. Place concrete with a finishing machine designed for fixed form paving that can ride on previously set
 forms and can independently, or in conjunction with an advance concrete spreader:
 1.
 
 Strike-off
 
 2.
 
 Screed
 
 3.
 
 Adjust to produce the specified cross slope and pavement width
 
 4.
 
 Place a minimum width pavement of 12 feet in one pull
 
 5.
 
 Provide a smooth, uniform concrete surface finish requiring minimal or no floating or hand finishing
 501 - 5
 
 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENT (PCCP)
 
 SECTION 501
 
 C. Vibration
 Vibrate and consolidate the concrete for the full placement width. Vibrators are to be attached to the paving
 Equipment or mounted on a separate carriage. Only operate the vibrators when the machine on which they
 are mounted is moving forward. Do not operate hand vibrators more than 10 seconds, or less than 5
 seconds in any one location unless approved otherwise by the Engineer. Place vibrators in and withdraw
 from concrete vertically in a slow deliberate manner. In order to obtain concrete consolidation in the
 vicinity of joint assemblies, the Engineer may require that these areas be hand vibrated with an immersion
 spud vibrator. Vibrators shall not contact load transfer devices, embedded hardware, or forms. The
 Contractor is responsible for the number and frequency setting of the vibrators to achieve uniform
 consolidation of the concrete throughout the entire slab thickness and width.
 D. Form Line Excavating Machine
 Excavate form lines for all forms supporting mechanical finishing Equipment to line and grade by a
 machine designed for this purpose and approved by the Engineer, or an approved machine that concurrently
 trims the subgrade or subbase to grade.
 E. If, during the operation of paving Equipment, it is necessary to operate one or both sets of wheels or tracks
 on previously placed concrete, adjust or alter the wheels or tracks so that the bearing on the concrete will
 not be closer than 3 inches from the pavement edge. When operating with one side of the machine on
 pavement and the other side on forms, the wheels operating on the forms may be double flanged. Use
 flangeless, rubber faced wheels on the pavement. When operating over the edge of concrete less than 2
 months old, support the ends of the finishing machine screeds with an approved device to provide from
 1/16 to 1/8 inch clearance between the screed and previously placed pavement.
 501.03.3.3. Construction Methods.
 A. No hardware may be placed on the grade in contact with the concrete pavement until the Engineer has
 given approval to do so. Place and grade the base course to the tolerance specified under the applicable
 Specification.
 B. Furnish and install load transfer devices. Clearly mark, on both sides, the center of each assembly using
 paint, stakes or other agreed upon method so that the transverse sawed joints can be properly located.
 Unless otherwise specified in the Contract Documents, construct load transfer assemblies in accordance
 with the Standard Construction Details. Apply a graphite coating to each dowel just prior to concrete
 placement if they are AASHTO M254, Type B (fusion bonded epoxy). No additional coating is required, if
 the approved dowels are AASHTO M254, Type A. Locate dowels at a pavement depth of T/2, (T =
 pavement thickness). Securely stake or otherwise fasten, in accordance with the Standard Construction
 Details, the load transfer device to the subgrade to prevent movement during concrete placement. Do not
 use load transfer assemblies that are damaged in any way. Verify horizontal and vertical alignment of the
 devices not to exceed the tolerances as defined in the Standard Construction Details. Check initial dowel
 placement on grade with a template or other approved tool supplied by the Contractor for use by the
 Engineer.
 C. Furnish Hook Bolts (or W-Bolts) for use when lanes will longitudinally abut the pavement being placed,
 and #5 standard rebars for tie bars used under longitudinal sawed joints or for tying into concrete lanes
 placed under previous contracts. Install these items prior to or during concrete placement. The method of
 installation must be approved prior to beginning concrete placement.
 D. Placing Concrete
 1.
 
 Minimize or eliminate stopping the forward movement of the paver. Sufficient number and proper
 scheduling of concrete delivery trucks is required in this regard.
 
 2.
 
 Maintain a uniform level of concrete feeding the paver screed, allowing sufficient concrete to
 completely fill the void under the screed for the entire width of pavement placed. Spreaders in
 advance of the paver may be used to control the concrete supplied to the paver.

 Finish with a pre-approved screed. Hand float or otherwise finish any areas as necessary. Pull a
 damp burlap drag longitudinally along the placement area. Texture and cure in accordance with
 Sections 501.03.4 and 501.03.5.
 
 d.
 
 When forms are stripped following concrete placement prior to five (5) Calendar Days following
 placement, apply curing compound or extend other curing methods immediately after patching any
 “honey-combed” areas to completely cure the exposed edge. Forms must remain in place at least
 12 hours following initial concrete placement, except for areas immediately adjacent to saw cut
 transverse joints. Forms at these joints must be removed when required in order to complete the
 saw cut through the entire pavement surface. Maintain the curing in place until a full five (5)
 Days has elapsed or the compressive strength of the concrete has reached 2,000 pounds per square
 inch.
 
 Safety Edge – Construct a safety edge as specified in the Contract Documents. The safety edge is
 required longitudinally along the outermost pavement edge (generally a shoulder) on all mainline and
 ramp paving unless otherwise approved by the Safety Program Manager or Designee.

 direction. Keep the burlap in a moist condition throughout the paving operation in order to prevent
 surface tearing.
 
 6.
 
 Texture and cure the pavement per Sections 501.03.4 and 501.03.5.
 
 501.03.4 Texturing.
 A. Texture the finished pavement for the entire placement width with an approved tining device. Flat steel
 wire tines are required and shall be 3/32 inches wide and 5 to 6 inches in length unless otherwise approved,
 having a 3/4 inch spacing between the tines. The tines shall form rectangular shaped grooves 1/16 inch to
 3/16 inches in depth. Do not texture portions of the pavement that will receive permanent pavement
 markings. In these areas, maintain a 10 inch wide flat surface to accommodate the striping and/or raised
 pavement markers. The burlap drag finish is acceptable for these areas
 B. The Contractor may elect to diamond grind all surfaces of concrete pavement to create a final texture. If
 so, do not perform the grinding until the concrete has obtained a compressive strength of at least 3,500
 pounds per square inch.
 C. Pull the tining in the longitudinal direction, parallel to the centerline of the pavement, in one pass without
 dragging or tearing the mortar.
 D. The Contractor is responsible to determine the proper time to install the tining. The tining should not pull
 excessive mortar or aggregate from the pavement (too early) or fail to penetrate the surface by the
 minimum 1/16 inch (too late).
 E. Make available hand tining devices at least 4 feet in width, equipped with tines identical to those specified
 above, for use in areas inaccessible to the mechanical device.

 curing period of five (5) Calendar Days following placement of the concrete. Provide all necessary
 monitoring devices (High-Low thermometers or other tools) and a plan for monitoring the temperature
 during the five (5) Day period ensuring placed concrete is not damaged by the temperatures. Use of
 insulating blankets, straw, polyethylene, or other protection subject to the approval of the Engineer,
 must be addressed in the plan.
 
 B. Hot Weather
 1. If plastic concrete temperatures reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit, give additional attention to dampening the
 subgrade immediately in advance of the concrete placement. Perform finishing, texturing, and curing
 operations as soon as possible. Should the pavement surface dry out to the extent that it cannot be
 sealed without the application of surface water, paving shall be suspended.
 2. No concrete may be placed when the temperature of the plastic concrete exceeds 90 degrees Fahrenheit
 at the production facility.
 3. Regardless of the protection methods selected, the Contractor is responsible to protect the concrete from
 freezing or other thermal damage. Any removal, replacement, and/or repairs resulting from thermal

 H. Provide concrete meeting the required compressive strength requirements subject to payment Adjustment
 as outlined in Section 501.05.
 501.03.10 Tolerance in Pavement Thickness.
 For the purpose of establishing an adjusted Unit Price for pavement lanes, the following is considered:
 A. The Engineer will divide the PCC Pavement for the entire Contract into 1,000 square yard lots, determine
 the random core locations, drill the cores, determine pavement thickness according to AASHTO T 148, and
 patch the resulting holes in the PCC Pavement.
 B. Uneven lots less than 1,000 square yards may occur due to the pavement geometry. If this is the case, these
 irregular lots will be considered a complete lot when evaluating the pavement thickness, regardless of their
 actual size.
 C. If a random core measurement is deficient by more than 0.20 inch when compared to the Plan pavement
 thickness, 2 additional randomly selected cores will be taken within the same lot. Cores measuring 0.20
 inch or more in excess of the Plan pavement thickness will be considered to measure exactly 0.20 inch
 greater than the planned thickness when computing the average of the 3 cores. The average thickness of
 the 3 cores will be considered the pavement thickness for the lot being evaluated. This lot thickness will be
 used to determine payment for the entire lot in accordance with Table 501.05.1.
 Remove and replace the entire lot represented by the short cores when any average lot thickness is deficient by more
 than 1 inch when compared to the Plan pavement thickness. The Engineer will provide the limits of the lot in
 question.

 transition slabs in accordance with the Contract Documents using an Inertial Profiler unless otherwise stated.
 501.03.11.2 Straight Edge Surface Testing. In the absence of the requirement for Inertial Profiler smoothness
 testing, surface testing will be performed with a rolling straight edge or a conventional straight edge furnished by the
 Contractor. Finished concrete pavement and/or Bridge surfaces will be tested by the Contractor and witnessed by
 the Engineer for trueness in each wheel lane at the completion of the required curing or protection period. Test the
 surface with a rolling 10 foot straight edge, or a 10 foot straight edge placed parallel to the center line of the
 pavement, parallel to the grade line and touching the surface. Surface variations of the pavement measured by the 10
 foot rolling straight edge, or measured from the base of the straight edge to the surface of the pavement, shall not
 exceed 0.25 inch. An approved 10 foot long straight edge shall be available at all times during concrete paving
 operations.
 501.03.11.3 Surface Corrections. Use diamond grinding to remove deviations exceeding 0.25 inch in 10 feet
 and/or to improve ride quality. Submit, for review by the Engineer, similar types of work performed with the
 proposed Equipment, including references if requested.
 501.04 Method of Measurement.
 The quantity will be measured as the actual square yards placed and accepted. Pavement width measurement not to
 exceed that shown on the Plans unless otherwise approved. Longitudinal dimension measured along the centerline
 of pavement.
 Areas requiring repairs due to random cracking or failure to meet other performance measures will not be measured
 for payment until the repairs have been successfully completed. In these cases, the actual repair area (dimensions of
 the patch or other repair) will be the quantity withheld from payment.

 SECTION 503
 
 SECTION 503 – PATCHING PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 503.01 Description. Remove and dispose of existing Portland cement concrete pavement and replace it with new
 Portland cement concrete pavement. The Engineer will designate the boundaries of each repair. This Work is not
 intended for repairing newly constructed Portland cement concrete pavement or for repairing continuously
 reinforced concrete pavement. Complete full depth patching under this Item after any planned partial depth patching
 and before any diamond grinding or overlay.
 503.02 Materials. Provide Materials as specified in the following:
 Portland Cement Concrete, Class A
 
 Section 1022
 
 Load Transfer Devices
 
 Section 1037
 
 Epoxy Grout
 
 Section 1047
 
 Joint Sealants
 
 Section 1042
 
 Curing Materials
 
 Section 1022
 
 503.03 Construction. Provide an American Concrete Institute (ACI) or National Ready Mix Concrete Association
 (NRMCA) certified concrete flatwork technician to supervise all finishing. Provide proof of the flatwork
 certification to the Engineer prior to concrete placement.
 503.03.1 Patching Limits. Pavement to be patched will be indicated in the Contract Documents, or identified by
 the Engineer. Patching limits will be painted on the existing pavement by the Engineer.
 Patches can be either Type ‘A’ or Type ‘B’. A Type ‘A’ patch is 15 feet or less in length. A Type ‘B’ patch is
 greater than 15 feet and less than 100 feet in length and contains load transfer assemblies spaced at a maximum of
 15 feet.
 Construct pavement replacement greater than 100 feet in length under Section 501 - Portland Cement Concrete
 Pavement.
 Patch limits in the direction of traffic shall either match or be offset by at least 2 feet from the existing concrete
 pavement joints, any cracks, or patch ends in the immediate adjacent lanes.
 Patch lengths shall be at least 6 feet and no more than 15 feet without a load-transfer device. The patch shall be the
 full width of the existing slab or as noted on the Contract Documents. The patch depth shall be no less than the
 existing slab.
 503.03.2 Saw Cutting. Refer to and comply with all requirements listed in Section 762 of the Standard
 Specifications. Construct all perimeter cuts plumb and parallel or normal to the centerline of the roadway. Cutting
 existing bituminous overlays up to 8 inches thick over the concrete is incidental to the concrete saw cutting Item,
 unless otherwise noted in the Contract Documents. Minimize and seal any over-cut into the remaining slabs as
 directed by the Engineer. Cut any existing tie-steel across the patch perimeter (cost incidental to the concrete saw
 cut). The Contractor may make additional cuts (such as diagonal and slanted cuts) to facilitate the removal of the
 concrete within the patch boundaries. The additional cuts to facilitate removal are incidental to the saw cutting Item
 and will not be measured or paid. Cutting shall not precede the removal operations by more than two (2) Days.
 Remove and properly dispose of concrete slurry remaining after saw cutting in accordance with Section 106.08 of
 the Standard Specifications. Clean all travel lanes to the satisfaction of the Engineer before opening to traffic
 following the saw cutting operation.
 503.03.3 Patch Removal. Remove the patch and any remaining bituminous overlay in the patch area by the lift-out
 technique without damaging the remaining concrete slabs or disturbing the base and subgrade. If the bituminous
 overlay is to be replaced, payment will be made for the overlay using the applicable bituminous concrete Item. Drill
 holes into the patch to insert lifting hooks, pins, or chains. Improper actions (such as dropping the removed slab on
 adjacent concrete pavement, damaging the pavement edge due to the Contractor’s methods, or other actions deemed
 damaging by the Engineer) leading to slab damage shall be repaired by the Contractor, by an approved method, at no
 cost to the Department.
 
 503 - 1
 
 PATCHING PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 
 SECTION 503
 
 When the lift-out technique is not feasible, break and remove the concrete in the patch area using an approved
 mechanical pavement breaker or jackhammer. Execute the removal of the existing concrete and bituminous overlay
 (if applicable) with minimal disturbance to the remaining concrete or foundation. Repair any damage beyond the
 limits of the patch, caused by the improper actions of the Contractor, to the satisfaction of the Engineer, at no cost to
 the Department.
 Where the patch is next to the shoulder and removal of the concrete results in a clean, uniform shoulder edge, the
 Engineer may allow the Contractor to use the shoulder edge as the form for the new concrete. Repair in kind any
 portion of the shoulder pavement structure removed or disturbed by the patching operation (if the shoulder is not
 designated for replacement). Costs of the repair are incidental to the patching Item(s). Saw cutting the joint
 between the concrete pavement and shoulder may assist in maintaining a clean, uniform shoulder edge. If the
 adjacent shoulder is concrete, the saw cut will be measured and paid for. If the adjacent shoulder is bituminous
 concrete, no measurement or payment will be made for the saw cut. If the bituminous shoulder is damaged during
 concrete removal, then place a side form to provide a vertical edge for the concrete patch.
 503.03.4 Patch Preparation. After removal of the concrete, if the base material is unsuitable or washed out,
 remove any base or subgrade material that is unstable to a maximum depth of 6 inches as directed by the Engineer.
 Do not place any new base material. Fill the excavated area with concrete when the patch is placed. Clean out the
 repair area with hand tools and protect the patch subgrade from water intrusion when precipitation is forecasted.
 Excessive moisture remaining after excavation may require the construction of a pipe underdrain system as directed
 by the Engineer and as shown in the Contract Documents.
 In areas of composite pavements (bituminous concrete over P.C.C. pavement) and if the Contractor elects to pour
 the concrete patch flush with existing bituminous concrete pavement to eliminate grade differential, the additional
 depth, not to exceed 6 inches, shall be placed as directed by the Engineer.
 Give particular attention to existing longitudinal joint areas where loose concrete may have cracked away from the
 plumb line during patch removal. Clean all vertical faces of loose and deleterious material prior to the placement of
 concrete.
 Just prior to concrete patch placement, spray a light coating of wax-based curing compound bond breaker on the
 longitudinal and transverse vertical faces of existing concrete pavement adjacent to the patch.
 503.03.5 Load Transfer Devices and Dowels Installation. Provide dowel support baskets conforming to the
 requirements of the Contract Documents. For Type B patches, fabricate the load transfer assemblies from dowels
 meeting the requirements of Section 1037. If not specified in the Contract Documents, use epoxy grout conforming
 to AASHTO M235 to anchor dowels. All sacrificial bars in basket must be cut after placement.
 A. Equipment. Use drills capable of producing holes of proper size, depth, and angle with no damage to the
 surrounding concrete. Use a drill support system to maintain proper hole alignment. Gang drills are
 required for use on Contracts requiring multiple patches. If unacceptable spalling, cracking, or other
 damage to the remaining concrete pavement is caused by the drilling operation, then the Contractor must
 saw out the damaged portion of pavement, full lane width, and redrill the holes with proper Equipment. No
 measurement or payment will be made for removing and patching damaged areas.
 B. Placement. Place dowels to provide load transfer at both transverse ends of the patch as shown in the
 Contract Documents. Allow 12 inches (typical), and no less than 6 inches from the longitudinal slab edge,
 to the center of the first and last dowel holes along the transverse ends of the patch.
 For slabs less than 10 inches thick, use 18 inch long dowels with a diameter of 1-1/4 inches. For slabs
 greater than or equal to 10 inches thick, use 20 inch long dowels with a diameter of 1-1/2 inches.
 Drill the dowel holes parallel to the profile and centerline of the pavement to an embedment depth of half
 the dowel bar length. Drill holes to a diameter 1/16 inch greater than the dowel when epoxy grout is used.
 Use compressed air to clean the holes prior to grout or epoxy placement.
 Place the anchoring grout or epoxy using a nozzle or wand that will deposit the Material to the back of the
 hole. Do not push or pour the anchoring Material into the holes. Install the dowel into the grout using a
 twisting motion of about one revolution to completely coat the dowel surface. Install a plastic grout
 
 503 - 2
 
 PATCHING PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 
 SECTION 503
 
 retention disk around each dowel to prevent grout loss and to help center the dowel in the hole. A small
 amount of grout should be visible around the ring when the hole is properly filled. Support the dowels in
 proper alignment until the grout has sufficiently set. Align the dowel bars not to exceed the tolerances as
 indicated in the Contract Documents. Fill any unused hole with epoxy grout. Any damage caused by the
 Contractor's technique shall be repaired at no added cost to the Department.
 503.03.6 Placing Concrete. Dampen the subgrade just prior to concrete placement. Deposit patching concrete
 directly on the moist subgrade and uniformly distribute and spread it over the entire patch area. Cast each patch area
 in one continuous operation. Consolidate the concrete using a standard spud-type vibrator. The vibrator must be
 capable of visibly affecting the concrete from a distance of 1' from the vibrator head. Insert the vibrator vertically
 into the concrete without dragging it through the mix.
 A. Temperature Restrictions. Unless specifically approved otherwise by the Engineer, place patching concrete
 only when the air temperature measured in the shade is 35 degrees Fahrenheit and rising. Concrete
 temperatures shall meet the requirements of Section 1022.06.
 503.03.7 Concrete Strength Requirements. Place Class A concrete having a minimum compressive strength of
 2,000 pounds per square inch or full design strength as noted in the Contract Documents within 6 hours of concrete
 placement. Provide Sure-Cure Mold test cylinders and all associated Equipment for use by the Engineer. The
 concrete will be sampled and tested by the Engineer. The Engineer may also use the concrete maturity meter in
 accordance with AASHTO T 325 to determine compressive strength.
 The Contractor, in order to accomplish the designed compressive strength in 6 hours, shall establish the actual
 combination of weights and proportion of admixtures as required by the field conditions, ambient temperature,
 humidity, and wind conditions. If the Contractor, due to unfavorable weather conditions, is unable to accomplish
 the desired strength in 6 hours, they may reschedule the patching Work subject to approval by the Engineer. Failure
 to meet the compressive strength may cause the concrete to be considered defective based upon its structural
 adequacy.
 Remove and replace concrete determined to be structurally inadequate by the Engineer, at no additional cost to the
 Department. Concrete determined to be structurally adequate by the Engineer, but not meeting 2,000 pounds per
 square inch in 6 hours, may remain in place at a prorated payment as specified below in Section 503.05.1. If the
 Contractor does not wish to accept the prorated payment, the concrete shall be removed and replaced at no cost to
 the Department.
 503.03.8 Finishing Concrete. Except when a bituminous surface patch over the concrete is required or when an
 overlay will be placed, strike off the concrete surface flush with the existing pavement. For patches up to 10 feet
 long, place the screed parallel to the centerline of the roadway. For longer patches, the screed may be placed
 perpendicular to the centerline of the roadway.
 When the patch surface will be overlaid with bituminous concrete, use a broom or tined finish on the concrete patch,
 with the texture applied in a direction perpendicular to the traffic flow. Match the adjacent pavement surface cross
 slope and profile. If the profile in the finished patch area contains excessive surface deviations, the patch is
 unacceptable. Excessive deviations are surface deviations greater than 1/4 inch from a reference line between points
 not greater than 10 feet apart along the direction of traffic.
 When the concrete patch will be the final roadway surface, match the texture of the adjacent pavement. The patch
 surface cross section shall also match the preceding and following pavement surfaces. No steel trowels will be
 allowed for finishing surfaces. The Engineer may test for excessive surface deviations with a straightedge, a
 profilometer, or other surface measuring device. When tested with a straightedge, excessive deviations are surface
 deviations greater than 1/4 inch from a reference line between points not greater than 10 feet apart along the
 direction of traffic.
 Repair any damaged concrete or bituminous shoulder before the patch area is subjected to traffic loading.
 503.03.9 Curing and Protecting. Cure and protect the finished patch with either a liquid membrane curing
 compound and polyethylene sheeting or wet burlap and polyethylene sheeting, and insulating blankets as required to
 ensure Specification compliance.
 
 503 - 3
 
 PATCHING PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 
 SECTION 503
 
 A. Liquid membrane curing compound / polyethylene sheeting. Apply uniformly upon completion of the
 patch texturing at a rate of 150 square feet per gallon and then cover with polyethylene sheeting. Securely
 anchor the polyethylene to protect against wind, rain, or adjoining traffic.
 B. Burlap / polyethylene sheeting. Cover the patch with a layer of wet burlap immediately; then cover the wet
 burlap with a polyethylene sheet. Securely anchor the polyethylene to protect against wind, rain, or
 adjoining traffic.
 After the curing compound/polyethylene sheeting or burlap/polyethylene sheeting is applied, cover the patch with an
 approved insulating blanket. Blankets shall remain in place until the concrete has achieved the design strength (or
 2,000 pounds per square inch if not noted otherwise). Secure edges and seams in the insulation to prevent
 dislodging due to wind, rain, or adjoining traffic. Required thickness of each insulating blanket is at least 2 inches.
 503.03.10 Joints. Form or saw transverse and longitudinal joints as shown in the Contract Documents. Saw
 transverse joints within the patch area (Type B patches only) at the proper time to assure proper crack control at the
 transverse joint. Clean and seal the joints around the entire patch perimeter and all transverse joints in larger patches
 with hot-poured sealant Material within five (5) Days after concrete placement if no overlay is planned. Refer to
 and comply with all Section 504 requirements.
 If the pavement is to be overlaid, then the transverse joints at the ends of the patch need only be tooled. No sealant
 reservoir is required in this case. Widen and seal the sawed transverse joints for crack control within Type B
 patches for both finished surface and overlay conditions.
 If bituminous pavement is required over the patch area only (and a complete pavement overlay will not be placed), a
 1/4 inch wide x 1/2 inch reservoir shall be formed in the bituminous Material around the patch perimeter when the
 Material is placed. Fill the resulting reservoir with hot-poured joint sealant in accordance with Section 504.

 504.03.1 Sealant Equipment. Use sealing Equipment specifically recommended by the manufacturer, compatible
 with the approved sealant.
 504.03.2 Existing Sealant Removal. Remove any in-place sealant from existing joints using a vertical cutting edge
 tool. A power driven high pressure water blaster is also permitted. V-shaped “plow tools” are not approved for use.
 Remove the existing sealant to the depth required to accommodate any separating and/or backup Material used, and
 provide the specified reservoir depth for the new sealant Material to be installed.
 504.03.3 Refacing of Joints. Saw or reface existing joints using a power-driven concrete saw with diamond or
 abrasive blades to remove all old sealant from the joint faces and to expose new clean concrete and, if required, to
 cut the joint to the width and depth necessary to provide the joint reservoirs shown in the Contract Documents.
 504.03.4 Cleaning Prior to Resealing. Following all sawing, resawing, or refacing operations on newly
 constructed and/or existing joints, thoroughly clean the joint faces and openings by sandblasting, followed by an oilfree air jet to remove all cuttings or debris remaining on the faces or in the joint openings. When sandblasting and
 air jetting is completed, the concrete joint surface receiving the new joint sealant shall be free of all tar and asphalt,
 all old sealant, all discoloration and stain, as well as any and all other forms of contamination of the pore structure,
 resulting in a clean, dry, newly exposed concrete surface.
 Immediately prior to the placement of the backup Material and the sealant, clean the joints with a compressed air
 stream of at least 100 pounds per square inch measured at the source.
 When the bottom of the joint opening to be sealed is formed by previously installed expansion joint material (such
 as at existing concrete patch locations), insert a nonreactive adhesive-backed tape in lieu of the backer rod. Place
 tape 1/8 inch wider than the nominal width of the joints.
 Equip air compressors used for the purpose described above, with traps capable of removing moisture and oil from
 the air. Stop work when there is oil or moisture in the compressed air. Do not resume work until adjustments are
 made and the air stream is found to be free of such contaminants.
 Under no conditions will the Contractor be permitted to place the sealant if there is dust, moisture, oil, or any other
 contaminants on that portion of the concrete that is to receive the joint sealant. Do not stretch the backer rod during
 insertion in the joint.
 Protect the public from hazard or damage during the sandblasting and joint cleaning operations. Use rigidly
 supported plywood sheeting or other suitable Material and methods for this purpose, subject to approval by the
 Engineer.
 During all operations, do not damage the subbase, curbs, shoulders, load transfer devices, or pavement. If such
 damage occurs, submit repair procedure for approval and perform repairs to the satisfaction of the Engineer, at no
 cost to the Department.
 504.03.5 Limits of Joint Preparation. Limit the final stages of joint preparation, including air pressure cleaning of
 joints, and placement of separating and/or backup Material to the length of joint that can be resealed during a Day's
 production.
 504.03.6 Installation of Hot-Poured Sealant. Provide a copy of and follow manufacturer's recommendations

 Remove any unsuitable material encountered below the proposed bedding of the pipe and replace as directed by the
 Engineer.
 601.03.3 Reinforced Concrete Pipe
 A. Joints
 1.
 
 Before laying the pipe in the trench, attach the rubber gasket to the spigot end of each pipe joint and set
 firmly against the shoulder around the entire circumference of the pipe joint. Prior to installation, the
 Contractor may apply a lubricant specified by the gasket manufacturer to the gasket for ease of
 installation.
 
 2.
 
 Carefully control pipe handling after the gasket has been affixed to avoid bumping the gasket and thus
 displacing it or covering it with dirt or other foreign material. Remove any gasket so disturbed and
 reposition if displaced or replace if damaged. Apply sufficient pressure in making the joint to ensure
 that the joint is tight.
 
 B. Defects
 1.
 
 Field inspections will be made to evaluate issues that may affect long-term performance such as cracks,
 joint quality, and alignment.
 
 2.

 601.03.5 High Density Polyethylene Pipe
 A. Joints
 1.
 
 Provide only watertight joints when installing pipe.
 
 2.
 
 For type S or D pipes, use gasketed watertight bell/spigot or bell/bell couplers. Provide a joint system
 that has sufficient longitudinal strength to preserve pipe alignment and prevent separation at the joint.
 
 3.
 
 For type C pipe, use bell and spigot, split-collar, or screw-on collar couplings that are corrugated to
 match the pipe corrugations and that provide sufficient longitudinal strength to preserve pipe alignment
 and prevent separation at the joint. For split-collar couplings, engage at least two full corrugations on
 each pipe section. Screw-on collars shall have a width of at least one-half the nominal diameter of the
 pipe.

 604.03 Construction.
 604.03.1 Working Drawings
 A. Prepare and submit Working Drawings for the temporary works at least 30 Days in advance of beginning
 the Work in accordance with Section 105.04. Such drawings must include Materials list, erection scheme,
 design calculations, and supporting data in sufficient detail to allow a structural review of the proposed
 design of a temporary work. Drawings and calculations must be sealed by a Professional Engineer
 registered in the State of Delaware, and must be approved by the Engineer prior to fabrication.
 B. Have a registered Professional Engineer design the temporary works according to AASHTO LRFD Bridge
 Design Specifications or the Guide Design Specifications for Bridge Temporary Works, or to other design
 codes as specified in the Contract Documents. Design must consider all applicable loads including, but not
 limited to, wind loads, dead loads, live loads, etc.
 C. Unless otherwise noted in the Contract Documents, the minimum under-clearance over roadways (travel
 way and shoulder) shall be as follows:
 1.
 
 14.5 feet for interstate and other controlled access highways
 
 2.
 
 14.0 feet for all other roadways
 No portion of the temporary works system (including connection devices) shall encroach on underclearances.
 
 D. Start construction only after the Working Drawings have been approved. Construct temporary works in
 conformance with the approved Working Drawings. Verify that the quality of the Materials and Work
 employed are consistent with the design.
 E. Remove and retain, or dispose of, temporary works upon completion of their use. Restore the area to its
 original or planned condition and dispose of debris.
 604.03.2 Falsework and Formwork
 A. Furnish rigid and strong Falsework and forms to safely support the imposed loads and produce the lines and
 grades indicated. Impart the required surface texture and rustication with forms and provide uniformity of
 color of formed surfaces.
 B. Limit loads of Falsework onto other Structures.
 C. For roadways remaining open to traffic during construction, provide a horizontal clearance of 5 feet greater
 than the width of the approach traveled way.
 D. Construct Falsework and set grades that allow for anticipated settlement and deflection, provide the vertical
 alignment and camber indicated for the permanent Structure, allow for minor adjustments during the
 placement of concrete or structural steel, and allow for the gradual release of the Falsework. Attach an
 approved indicator to the forms in a manner to indicate any settlement, movement, or deflection in the
 
 604 - 1
 
 TEMPORARY WORKS
 
 SECTION 604
 
 Falsework. Provide for accurate measurement of Falsework settlement during the placing and curing of the
 concrete.
 E. Support Falsework or Formwork for deck slabs on girder bridges directly on the girders. Brace and tie
 girders to resist forces that would cause rotation or torsion in the girders. Do not weld Falsework support
 brackets or braces to structural steel members or reinforcing steel unless where specified or directed.
 F.
 
 For concrete surfaces that will be exposed to view, provide Formwork that will produce a smooth surface
 of uniform texture and color. Arrange panels lining of such forms so that the joint lines form a symmetrical
 pattern conforming to the general lines of the Structure. Use the same type of form lining material
 throughout each element of a Structure. Use rigid forms to ensure the undulation of the concrete surface is
 less than 1/8 inch when checked with a 60-inch straightedge or template. Fillet sharp corners with
 approximately 3/4 inch chamfer strips.
 
 G. If form liners are specified in the Contract Documents, use form lining pieces as large as possible. Arrange
 panels lining such forms so that the joint lines form a symmetrical pattern conforming to the general lines
 of the Structure. Ensure that joints are solidly backed, butted together tightly, and sealed with approved
 crack fillers. Use the same type of form lining material throughout each element of a Structure.
 H. Set and hold forms true to the dimensions, lines, and grades of the Structure prior to and during the
 placement of concrete. Bevel or chamfer at projections, such as copings, to ensure easy removal. Clean
 forms, inspect for damage and, if necessary, repair prior to reuse. Discontinue use of forms that appear to
 be defective until defects are corrected. Treat forms with form oil or other approved release agent before
 placing the reinforcing steel. Do not use material that adheres to or discolors the concrete.
 I.
 
 Construct metal ties or anchorages within the forms to ensure that they may be removed to a depth of at
 least 1 inch from the face without injury to the concrete. Design fittings for metal ties to minimize the size
 of the cavities remaining after their removal. Fill the cavities with cement mortar and leave the surface
 sound, smooth, even, and uniform in color.
 
 J.
 
 When epoxy-coated reinforcing steel is required, use embedded ties, anchorages, or spreaders of corrosionresistant Material or coated with a dielectric Material. Remove wood blocks and bracing within the forms
 and in no case leave any portion of the wood forms in the concrete.
 
 K. In narrow walls and columns, where the bottom of the form is inaccessible, provide an access opening in
 the forms for cleaning out extraneous material immediately before placing the concrete. For thin wall
 construction, daylight forms at intervals not greater than 10 feet vertically to permit free access to the forms
 for the purpose of inspecting, working, and vibrating the concrete.
 L. Design and fabricate cardboard tubes, which are placed in forms to produce voids in concrete slabs and box
 beams. Fabricate the outside layers of the tubes to be fully waterproof. Protect such tubes from the
 weather, and store and install by methods that prevent distortion or damage prior to concrete placement.
 Prevent fresh concrete from entering the tubes during concrete placement. Cover the ends of tube forms
 with mortar-tight and waterproof caps. Use a premolded rubber joint filler, 1/4 inch in thickness, around
 the perimeter of the caps to allow expansion when wood or other expandable material is used for capping
 tubes. Provide a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) vent tube near each end of each tube. Construct these vents,
 provide positive venting of the voids, and trim the vent tubes to within 5/8 inch of the bottom surface of the
 finished concrete after removing the exterior form. Anchor or tie tube forms to prevent displacement of the
 tubes during concrete placement. Styrofoam blocks may be used in lieu of cardboard tubes, provided they
 are properly anchored to prevent displacement during pouring.
 M. Deposit concrete in the forms after all Work related to constructing the forms has been completed, all
 debris has been removed, all Materials to be embedded in the concrete have been placed for the unit to be
 cast, and the forms and Materials have been inspected.
 N. When removing supports, avoid overstressing the concrete or damaging its surface, and allow the Structure
 to uniformly and gradually take the stresses resulting from its own mass. After placing concrete, maintain
 Falsework or forms as required in Table 610.03-2, exclusive of Days when the temperature is below 40
 degrees Fahrenheit.

 B. Wave Equation Analysis Submittals. Thirty (30) Days prior to driving piles, submit the wave equation
 analysis, pile, and pile driving Equipment information using the Department’s Pile and Driving Equipment
 Data Form.
 1.
 
 Submit a wave equation analysis demonstrating the suitability of each type of pile and each proposed
 pile driving system. Each analysis is required to be signed and sealed by a Professional Engineer
 registered in the State of Delaware.
 
 2.
 
 Ensure the static soil analysis is included with and in the wave equation analysis.
 
 3.
 
 Submit the qualifications of the selected pile testing firm for dynamic testing for approval at the time
 of the wave equation analysis submittal. Approval will be based on qualifications and applicable
 previous experience on other projects.
 
 C. Wave Equation Analysis Requirements
 1.
 
 Use the wave equation analysis to verify the adequacy of the pile driving system and to establish the
 necessary blow counts, stroke heights, pile cushions, and any other applicable information for use in
 driving initial test piles to the required bearing resistance and tip elevation. These criteria may be
 reevaluated during test pile driving and may or may not be revised for production pile driving.
 Include computer input and output sheets and suitable data plots displaying the wave equation analysis for
 the pile driving throughout the various subsurface conditions of the site. Show resistance versus blow
 count as well as maximum tension and compression stresses versus resistance on the plots.
 Perform a wave equation analysis for each test and indicator pile unless otherwise specified in the Contract
 Documents. Evaluate drivability of the pile to various depths of penetration using the proposed driving
 system. Evaluate the driving conditions for 5 percent penetration, 70 percent penetration, 90 percent
 penetration, 100 percent penetration, and 110 percent penetration of the pile during initial driving and after
 set-up condition as a minimum. Perform additional analysis at depths where difficult driving or significant
 changes in drivability are anticipated. One hundred percent penetration refers to penetration to the plan
 estimated tip elevation to achieve the designated ultimate resistance. Use the wave equation analysis
 estimate of tip elevation for the ultimate resistance if it differs from the Plan estimate by more than 10
 percent at 100 percent penetration. Show the driving conditions for Plan estimated depth in the analysis if
 the wave equation analysis estimate is chosen as 100 percent penetration.
 Use the estimated friction and end bearing values obtained by the static soil analysis along with soil layer
 specific quake and damping values and friction parameters for each level of penetration in the drivability
 analysis. As a minimum, include ultimate resistances, blow counts, compressive and tensile stresses, and
 transferred energy plotted as a function of depth of penetration in the analysis output. Submit the static soil
 analysis with the wave equation analysis.
 If the driving Equipment consists of a varying energy or varying stroke type hammer, such as an openended diesel hammer, perform an additional analysis that plots blow count versus stroke and/or energy for
 a fixed resistance equal to the ultimate resistance (bearing graph).
 Select a hammer that drives the pile to its required penetration to achieve required bearing or minimum tip
 elevation with a driving resistance not exceeding 120 blows per 12 inches. Driving resistance cannot
 exceed 20 blows per 1 inch in the last 6 inches of penetration.
 In addition, the Engineer will use the following criteria in evaluating wave equation results to
 determine the acceptability of the Contractor’s proposed driving system.
 a.
 
 For steel piles, the maximum permissible compressive or tensile driving stress is 90 percent of the
 minimum yield strength of the pile material.
 
 b.
 
 For prestressed concrete piles in normal environments, the maximum permissible tensile stress is 3
 multiplied by the square root of the concrete compressive strength, f c′ , plus the effective prestress
 value, fpe, or 3√fc ′ + fpe, with all units expressed in pounds per square inch.
 
 605 - 4
 
 DRIVEN PILES
 
 SECTION 605
 
 c.
 
 The maximum permissible compressive stress for prestressed concrete piles is 85 percent of the
 compressive strength minus the effective prestress value, or 0.85 fc ′ - fpe. In severe corrosive
 environments, the maximum permissible tensile stress for prestressed concrete piles is fpe.
 
 d.
 
 For timber piles, the maximum permissible compressive driving stress is three times the
 permissible static design strength listed in the Contract Documents.
 
 The Engineer will complete the conformance review and comment on the driving system within 14
 Days of receiving the Contractor’s Pile and Driving Equipment Data Form and Modify or replace the
 proposed methods or Equipment for nonconforming analysis at no cost to the Department. The
 Engineer will complete the conformance review of the revised driving system within 7 Days of receipt
 of a revised Pile and Driving Equipment Data Form and wave equation analysis.
 Do not modify the driving system without the Engineer’s written approval. The Engineer will only
 consider changes to the driving system after the Contractor has submitted the necessary information
 and a revised wave equation analysis for conformance review.
 D. Drive System Components and Accessories:
 1.
 
 Hammer Cushion. Equip impact pile driving Equipment, designed to be used with a hammer cushion,
 with a suitable thickness of hammer cushion material to prevent damage to the hammer or pile and to
 ensure uniform driving behavior. Furnish hammer cushions made of durable manufactured materials,
 provided in accordance with the hammer manufacturer’s guidelines. Do not use wood, wire rope, and
 asbestos hammer cushions. Place a striker plate, as recommended by the hammer manufacturer, on the
 hammer cushion to ensure uniform compression of the cushion material. Remove the hammer cushion
 from the helmet and inspect in the presence of the Engineer when beginning pile driving at each
 Structure or after each 100 hours of pile driving, whichever is less. Replace hammer cushions
 compressed to less than 75 percent of the original thickness before resuming pile driving.
 a.
 
 Helmet. Piles driven with impact hammers require an adequate helmet or drive head to distribute
 the hammer blow to the pile head. Align the helmet axially with the hammer and the pile. Use
 leads to guide the helmet and prevent it from swinging freely. Fit the helmet around the pile head
 in a manner that prevents transfer of torsional forces during driving, while maintaining proper
 alignment of hammer and pile.
 For steel and timber piling, cut the pile heads so that they are square, and provide a helmet, as
 recommended by the hammer manufacturer, to hold the axis of the pile in line with the axis of the
 hammer.
 For precast concrete and prestressed concrete piles, cut the pile head to a true plane perpendicular
 to the longitudinal axis of the pile to prevent eccentric impacts from the helmet.
 For special types of piles, provide appropriate helmets, mandrels, or other devices according to the
 manufacturer’s recommendations to prevent damage to the piles during driving operations.
 
 2.
 
 Pile Cushion. Protect the heads of concrete piles with a pile cushion made of plywood, hardwood, or
 composite plywood and hardwood materials. Prior to driving, place on the pile head a pile cushion
 with a minimum thickness of 6 inches. Provide a new pile cushion for each pile. In addition, replace
 the pile cushion if, during the driving of any pile, the cushion is compressed more than one-half the
 original thickness or it begins to burn. Ensure the pile cushion dimensions match the cross-sectional
 area of the pile top. The Engineer will evaluate the use of manufactured pile cushion materials in lieu
 of a wood pile cushion on a case-by-case basis.
 
 3.
 
 Leads. Use leads to support piles in line and position while being driven. Construct pile driver leads
 to allow the hammer to move freely while maintaining the alignment with the pile to ensure concentric
 impact for each blow. The Contractor may either use fixed- or swinging-type leads. When using
 swinging-type leads, fit a pile gate at the bottom of the leads and, in the case of battered piles, fit a
 horizontal brace between the crane and the leads, as necessary. Ensure that the pile section being
 driven does not extend above the leads. Adequately embed the leads in the ground or constrain the pile
 
 605 - 5
 
 DRIVEN PILES
 
 SECTION 605
 
 in a structural frame such as a template to maintain alignment. Provide leads of sufficient length to
 make the use of a follower unnecessary, and designed to allow proper alignment of battered piles.
 4.
 
 Followers. Only use followers when approved in writing by the Engineer, or when specifically stated
 in the Contract Documents. In cases where a follower is allowed, drive the first pile in each bent, and
 every tenth pile driven thereafter, full-length without a follower, to determine that adequate pile
 penetration is being attained to develop the ultimate pile resistance.
 Hold and maintain the follower and pile in equal and proper alignment during driving. Use a follower
 of the material and dimensions that will allow the piles to be driven to the penetration depth
 determined necessary from the driving of the full-length piles. Verify the final position and alignment
 of the first two piles installed with followers in each substructure unit according to the location
 tolerances specified in Section 605.03.5.B. before installing additional piles.
 
 5.
 
 Jets. Only perform jetting if approved in writing by the Engineer or when specifically stated in the
 Contract Documents. Water jets will not be permitted when installing any steel H piles. When jetting
 is not required in the Contract Documents, but approved after the Contractor’s request, determine the
 number of jets and the volume and pressure of water at the jet nozzles necessary to freely erode the
 material adjacent to the pile without affecting the lateral stability of the final in-place pile. Assume
 responsibility for damage to the site caused by unapproved or improper jetting operations. When
 jetting is specifically required in the Contract Documents, provide a jetting plant having sufficient
 capacity to deliver at all times a pressure equivalent to at least 100 pounds per square inch at two 3/4inch jet nozzles. In either case, unless otherwise directed by the Engineer, remove jet pipes when the
 pile toe is a minimum of 5 feet above the prescribed toe elevation, and drive the pile to the required
 ultimate pile resistance with a pile hammer. Also, control, perform any necessary treatment, and
 dispose of jet water in a manner satisfactory to the Engineer.
 
 E. Augering. When stated in the Contract Documents, auger holes at pile locations to the depths shown on the
 Plans. Auger holes of a size smaller than the diameter or diagonal of the pile cross section that is sufficient
 to allow penetration of the pile to the specified depth. If subsurface obstructions, such as boulders or rock
 layers, are encountered, the Contractor may increase the hole diameter to the least dimension adequate for
 pile installation. Maintain augered holes open using bentonite slurry, casing, or an equivalent method both
 before and during pile driving operations. Fill the void space remaining around the pile after completion of
 driving with sand or other approved Material. Do not use spuds, a short, strong driven member that is
 removed to make a hole for inserting a pile, in lieu of augering.
 605.03.3 Compression Load Tests:
 A. Static Load Tests. When required in the Contract Documents or when directed by the Engineer, determine safe
 bearing resistances of piles by actual load tests. Satisfy all requirements in accordance with the Notes indicated
 in the Contract Documents.
 B. Dynamic Load Tests.
 1.
 
 Materials and Construction Methods. Provide Equipment and perform testing and reporting
 procedures in strict accordance with ASTM D 4945 - Standard Test Method for High-Strain Dynamic
 Testing of Piles.
 Employ a pile testing firm experienced in high-strain dynamic monitoring of driven piles to conduct
 the load tests in compliance with these Specifications, to record all data, and to furnish reports of the
 test results to the Engineer except when the Contract Documents show that the Department will
 provide these services. The pile testing firm is required to have at least five (5) years of documented
 experience in the performance and interpretation of dynamic pile testing. The testing firm's field
 engineer or technician operating the instrumentation and collecting the data is required to have
 documented experience on at least ten (10) prior projects with similar pile requirements. The field
 engineer or technician responsible for operating the instrumentation must be fully capable of
 understanding and interpreting the data being collected during driving and must possess a valid
 Certificate of Proficiency issued by the Pile Driving Contractors Association (PDCA).

 SECTION 605
 
 Provide the Engineer with reasonable inspection access along the full length and perimeter of all piles
 prepared for instrumentation attachment prior to the piles being lifted and located in the leads.
 Do not install the dynamic monitoring instrumentation on the pile, including all gauges and cables,
 until the pile has been lifted and aligned in the leads and the hammer and helmet have been properly
 set.
 Provide sufficient length of indicator and test piles for uninterrupted driving during dynamic testing.
 Perform dynamic testing during the entire initial drive and re-strike of all indicator piles so designated
 in the Contract Documents or as otherwise directed by the Engineer. Continuously monitor the tensile
 and compressive stresses during driving to ensure that the permissible stress limits provided by the
 Engineer are not exceeded during driving. Immediately reduce the hammer stroke or stop the driving
 operation if stresses in the pile approach or exceed the permissible limits in order to prevent pile
 damage. If non-axial driving is indicated by dynamic test measurements, stop pile driving immediately
 and realign the driving system or take other corrective action, as necessary, before resuming driving.
 If the top of pile is damaged or becomes deformed at any time during the dynamic testing of the piles,
 stop pile driving and cut off the damaged area in accordance with Section 605.03.8. Properly prepare
 the remaining pile section for gauge installation and once the pile has been inspected and approved by
 the Department, continue driving.
 Drive all dynamically tested piles to an adequate depth to achieve the minimum tip elevation and the
 minimum initial driving resistance specified by the Engineer. If field data indicates the hammer
 system is not transferring to the pile the full energy anticipated at the end of initial drive, increase the
 hammer stroke and/or driving resistance until the minimum initial drive resistance is displayed on the
 dynamic testing apparatus. Do not exceed the permissible stress limits.
 Maintain a minimum distance of 1 foot between the pile monitoring gauges and the ground surface,
 water surface, or pile template. If additional ground penetration is required, stop driving the pile,
 remove the gauges and splice the pile before proceeding with additional driving and monitoring. Prior
 to splicing, properly prepare the pile splice segment for gauge installation in accordance with ASTM D
 4945 and make it accessible to the Engineer for inspection. After the pile has been properly spliced
 and the hammer and leads have been reset, reattach the gauges to the new pile segment and continue
 the drive.
 Dynamically test all re-strikes of indicator and test piles and of certain production piles selected by the
 Engineer. Follow the procedures in Section 605.03.6. for all re-strikes.
 If for any reason, any component of the pile driving system does not function properly during the pile
 re-strike, wait up to five (5) Days and perform additional re-strikes until the pile driving system
 operates properly through a complete continuous re-strike procedure at no additional cost to the
 Department.
 2. Reporting. Prepare and submit, within three (3) Working Days of the completion of each dynamic
 test, a written report with the results of the test pile program including the following:
 a.
 
 Meet the requirements of ASTM D 4945;
 
 b.
 
 specifics of the pile resistance observed during dynamic testing;
 
 c.

 Perform one additional CAPWAP analysis per initial drive or re-strike at selected pile penetration
 depths, at no additional cost to the Department, at the request of the Engineer.
 
 C. General. For any test or anchor piling that is not a part of the finished Structure, remove or cut off pile in
 accordance with Section 605.03.8, if not located within the footing area.
 605.03.4 Indicator and Test Piles. Follow the step-by-step procedures listed below when driving indicator and test
 piles.
 A. Perform the wave equation analysis based on the procedure outlined in Section 605.03.2.C.
 B. Ensure that indicator and test piles are the initial piles driven and are the same material and
 dimensions as the production piles. Install indicator and test piles at the locations indicated in the
 Contract Documents. Do not place bar reinforcement and concrete fill or grout until conclusion of the
 testing and acceptance of the indicator and test pile for use as a production pile.
 C. Furnish the Engineer with schedules of the proposed driving sequence. Do not begin driving of test
 piles at any location until the schedule for that location has been approved by the Engineer. Do not
 depart from these schedules without the prior approval of the Engineer.
 D. Conduct the test pile driving operations in close cooperation with the Engineer and in a manner such
 that essential measurements and data can be obtained. The Engineer will be present when the test pile
 driving Work is in progress. A complete driving log will be recorded by the Engineer for each test
 pile driven. The driving log will list all data essential for the determination of correct bearing
 resistance.
 E. If one or more static load test is required, perform at least one of the load tests in the first series of test
 piles driven.

 SECTION 605
 
 Provide lengths of test piles as indicated in the Contract Documents. If the Contractor’s static analysis
 predicts a need for alternate test pile lengths, clearly indicate the lengths of test piles in the wave
 equation analysis submittal. After evaluating the wave equation analysis, the Engineer will then issue
 an order length for test piles. Do not order any test piles with an alternate length prior to receiving the
 confirmation letter from the Engineer confirming test pile order length.
 
 G. Furnish test piles in one length and drive them continuously to the required bearing resistance and/or
 tip elevation unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 H. Drive test or indicator pile in accordance with Section 605.03.4.
 I.
 
 Following the driving of the test pile or series of initial test piles as agreed in the approved sequence of
 driving, the Engineer will review the driving records and make one or more of the following
 requirements:
 1.
 
 Establish the required blow count, stroke height and minimum tip elevation for the
 driving of production piles based on satisfactory test or indicator pile results.
 
 2.
 
 Issue, within five Working Days after completion of the test pile driving, a list of
 production pile lengths for those piles governed by the test pile or group of test piles.
 
 3.
 
 Order a test pile re-strike to be performed in accordance with Section 605.03.6. within
 two Working Days after completion of the initial driving.
 
 4.
 
 Order a driving splice to be made on the test pile within two Working Days after
 completion of the initial driving. Make the driving splice in accordance with the driving
 splice details shown in the Contract Documents. After splicing is successfully
 completed, continue driving of the spliced pile. When the driving of the spliced pile is
 completed, the Engineer will review the new driving records and make one of the
 recommendations listed under Step 9.
 
 5.
 
 Approve the driven test pile for load testing when requiring static load testing.
 Requirements 9.b., 9.c., or 9.d. above may be chosen prior to authorizing a load test to
 be performed or if a load test is performed and found to be unsatisfactory. The Engineer
 will issue a list of production pile lengths within two Working Days after receipt of the
 load test report for those piles governed by the test pile or group of test piles.
 
 6.
 
 J.
 
 If the data and information obtained from driving any original test or indicator pile is
 conflicting, inconclusive, or unsatisfactory in any way, the Engineer will order, within
 two Working Days after receipt of the load test report, another test pile to be driven for
 additional information.
 
 Construct any build-ups (non-driving splices) in accordance with the requirements of Section
 605.03.7.
 
 K. Cut off test piles, as necessary, in accordance with the requirements of Section 605.03.8.
 605.03.5 Preparation and Driving of Production Piles: When driving production piles, use this step-by-step
 procedure:
 A. Preparation
 1.
 
 Drive the production piles using the same hammer, cushioning, and other Equipment that was used to drive
 the indicator and test piles. If the there is a change in hammers, submit necessary wave equation analysis,
 drive additional test piles, and/or perform dynamic pile testing, as directed by the Engineer, before driving
 any production piles, even if the energy ratings of the hammers are identical.
 
 2.
 
 Drive all piles at locations shown in the Contract Documents or as directed by the Engineer. Place
 individual piles in pile groups either starting from the center of the group and proceeding outwards in both
 directions, or starting at the outside row and proceeding progressively across the group.
 
 605 - 9
 
 DRIVEN PILES
 3.
 
 SECTION 605
 
 Perform the pile driving sequence in conformance with the requirements established under Section
 605.03.5.B. If necessary, provide additional detail so that the Engineer is fully aware and in agreement
 with the proposed sequence of driving.
 
 B. Driving
 1.
 
 Provide all facilities so that the required records will be kept of the pile lengths, hammer speeds, blows per
 foot, tip elevations, and other pertinent data for all piles driven. Clearly mark the pile in 12 inch
 increments visible from a safe inspection distance.
 
 2.
 
 Ensure the heads of all piles are in a true plane and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pile
 before attaching the helmet. Protect the heads of concrete piles with a pile cushion as specified in
 Section 605.03.2.D.2. Do not apply side pressure for driving piles into the correct position.
 
 3.
 
 During pile driving, change the pile cushion as specified in Section 605.03.2.D.2. The Engineer’s
 prior approval of a pile hammer will not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for piles damaged
 because of misalignment of the leads, failure of cushion materials, failure of splices, malfunctioning of
 the pile hammer, or other improper construction methods. When the Engineer determines that such
 damage impairs the strength of the pile, replace the pile at no cost to the Department.
 
 4.
 
 Drive each production pile continuously from the time that driving is started until the required bearing
 resistance and/or tip elevation is reached, except as may be required for splicing the pile.
 
 5.
 
 Do not drive the pile to exceed 240 blows per 12 inches or 20 blows per 1 inch of driving for 3 consecutive
 inches. Immediately inform the Engineer if a pile reaches driving resistances exceeding 240 blows per
 12 inch or 20 blows per 1 inch at a tip elevation above the minimum tip elevation specified.
 
 6.
 
 Drive piles until they develop the nominal bearing resistance that is specified or until they reach practical
 refusal. The Engineer reserves the right, however, to establish a minimum tip elevation to which any or all
 piles are to be driven, depending on the actual conditions encountered.
 
 7.
 
 If the top of a pile is damaged or becomes deformed at any time during driving, stop pile driving and
 cut off the damaged area in accordance with Section 605.03.8.
 
 8.
 
 Drive piles within an allowed variation of 1/8 inch per 12 inches of pile length from the vertical or batter
 shown in the Contract Documents. The maximum allowable variation at the top of the pile is 3 inches in
 any direction from the location shown in the Contract Documents.
 
 9.
 
 Make any driving splices determined necessary by the Engineer in accordance with the Contract
 Documents or submit other details to the Engineer for review and approval. When the splice is complete,
 drive the spliced pile to the required bearing resistance and/or tip elevation. If it becomes necessary to
 splice timber piles, submit the method for splicing and driving to the Engineer for written approval.
 
 10. Remove and replace any pile damaged by reason of internal defects or improper driving and any pile, as
 indicated below, driven out of its proper location or alignment. Remove and replace any driven timber pile
 that shows evidence of splitting, splintering, or brooming. Remove and replace any driven shell or casing
 that shows bends, kinks, or other deformations which are detrimental to its use as a production pile. As an
 option, a second pile may be driven adjacent to the damaged or mislocated pile if the second pile can be
 driven without detriment to the Structure and if approved by the Engineer.
 C. Post-Driving
 1.
 
 The Engineer may direct the Contractor to re-strike selected production piles. If this direction is given,
 perform the production pile re-strikes in accordance with the requirements of Section 605.03.6.
 
 2.
 
 Survey the location and alignment of the piles after driving of each pile group. Furnish the results of the
 survey to the Engineer. In the event that one or more of the piles are damaged by improper driving, or
 driven outside the allowable tolerance specified herein, the Engineer will analyze the pile group. If the
 analysis indicates that any pile is overstressed as a result of the damage or out of tolerance location,
 remove the rejected pile or drive additional piles as directed by the Engineer. In addition, modify the pile
 
 605 - 10
 
 DRIVEN PILES
 
 SECTION 605
 
 cap or abutment as required by the Engineer to accommodate the out of tolerance or added piles. All piles
 damaged by improper driving, or driven out of their proper location or alignment will be rejected.
 3.
 
 Check piles for heave during driving of adjacent piles or by any other cause. Re-drive all piles heaved
 more than 1/4 inch to the nominal bearing resistance and at least to their original tip elevation, or as
 directed by the Engineer. Remove any material forced up between the piles during driving to the correct
 elevation before any concrete is placed for the foundation.
 
 4.
 
 Construct any build-ups (non-driving splices) in accordance with the requirements of Section 605.03.7.
 
 5.
 
 Cut off piles, as necessary, in accordance with the requirements of Section 605.03.8.
 
 605.03.6 Pile Re-strike. After initial driving of production, indicator, and/or test piles, the Engineer may order
 a pile re-strike within two Working Days after completion of the initial driving. Perform the re-strike within
 seven Days of initial driving unless otherwise noted in the Contract Documents. Perform the pile re-strike after
 the directed waiting time has elapsed, as follows:
 A. As necessary, connect dynamic pile testing Equipment in accordance with Section 605.03.3.B as indicated in
 the Contract Documents or directed by the Engineer.
 B. Perform all re-strikes using the same pile hammer, helmet, and compressed cushion material used to install
 the piles during initial driving.
 C. Verify proper operation of the driving system by striking another pile or pile cut-off at least 20 blows at full
 stroke.
 D. Establish the elevation of the top of pile using a survey level prior to performing the re-strike.
 E. Mark the pile in 1 inch increments for at least 12 inches for measurement of the pile movement during restrike.
 F.
 
 Do not use a cold hammer for re-driving. Warm up the hammer before re-driving begins by applying at
 least 20 blows to another pile.
 
 G. Carefully lower and position the hammer on the pile. Strike the pile 20 blows at the required stroke height.
 H. Remove the hammer from the pile and establish the new top of pile elevation using a survey level.
 After completion of the pile re-strike, the Engineer will review the driving records and make a recommendation
 on how to proceed within two Working Days. As directed by the Engineer, up to ten percent of production
 piles driven with a minimum of ten are subject to pile re-strikes. The Engineer will specify a waiting time of
 five Days or less to perform the pile re-strikes, unless noted otherwise in the Construction Documents.
 The pile or representative group of piles is considered acceptable if the pile re-strike results are satisfactory.
 Perform indicator and test pile re-strikes on each pile to be load tested when static load testing is required. The
 required waiting time is the same as required between the pile re-strike and the pile load test.
 605.03.7 Pile Build-Ups. Construct all build-ups as shown in the Contract Documents or submit other details for
 review and approval by the Engineer.
 605.03.8 Pile Cut-Offs.
 A. Cut off piles to a true plane to remove damage or deformations detrimental to the performance of the pile
 driving system or to the integrity of the pile during driving. Allow steel piles to cool after cut off before redriving.
 B. Cut off piles to final cut-off elevation when all pile driving is complete as shown in the Contract Documents or
 as directed by the Engineer. Cut-off sections of piles are the property of the Contractor. Dispose of cut-offs in
 accordance with Section 106.08, Disposal of Unacceptable Materials.
 1.
 
 Cut off pile shells or casings using an acetylene or electric torch.
 
 2.
 
 Saw piles that support timber caps or grillage to conform to the plane of the bottom of the superimposed
 structure:
 605 - 11
 
 DRIVEN PILES
 
 SECTION 605
 
 a.
 
 Thoroughly brush coat all exposed sawed surfaces of timber piles with three applications of
 preservative and cover with a thick layer of hot pitch or gum;
 
 b.
 
 Install a metal sheet covering of either zinc or copper that is a minimum of 4 inches greater than the
 diameter of the pile on top of the thick layer of hot pitch or gum;
 
 c.
 
 Bend excess metal down over the sides of the pile, trim neatly, and nail securely;
 
 d.
 
 Provide zinc sheet conforming to Section 1039.09 and fasten with 1 inch long galvanized, largeheaded nails;
 
 e.
 
 Provide copper sheet conforming to Section 1039.09 and fasten with 1 inch long copper nails.
 
 C. Cover the tops of pre-stressed concrete piles or steel shell piles with plastic to prevent dirt and water from
 entering the pile from the time that pile driving is complete until grout or concrete is placed. Remove any dirt
 or water from holes/sleeves of pre-stressed concrete piles prior to grouting in bar reinforcement.
 D. Cut off test piles driven outside permanent foundation locations, upon satisfactory completion of test driving, at
 a point at least 24 inches below finished grade or final stream bed elevation.
 605.03.9 Placing Bar Reinforcement for Cast-In-Place Concrete Piles. Assemble the longitudinal bar reinforcement
 and circular ties as a complete unit. Securely fasten the bars and ties together at all bar intersections in accordance with
 the details shown in the Contract Documents. Place the complete unit in the driven casing or shell and ensure that it is
 held rigidly in place to prevent displacement during the placing of the concrete.
 Submit for review, comment, and conformity a Drawing or Plan showing the proposed method of holding the bar
 reinforcement in position during the placing of the concrete. Review of the method submitted will not relieve the
 Contractor of its responsibility for ensuring that all bar reinforcement is properly located within the body of the finished
 piles.
 605.03.10 Placing Concrete for Cast-In-Place Concrete Piles. Do not place concrete in any pile casing or shell until
 all driving within the same substructure unit is complete and acceptable. In the event that this limitation cannot be
 followed, do not drive within the above limits until the placed concrete has set for at least seven Days.
 After driving and completing the pile and other parts of the Structure, clean the exposed part of the piling of undue
 discoloration caused by methods of construction.
 Do not deposit concrete in a driven casing or shell until all water, dirt, and debris is completely removed and approved
 by the Engineer.
 Place the concrete for each shell or casing in such a manner as to ensure a dense, homogenous mass throughout the entire
 casing that is completely free from debris, oil, water, and other foreign matters to provide a permanent bond with all bar
 reinforcement embedded in the pile.
 Place concrete for each shell or casing in a continuous operation. An exception will be made if the bar reinforcement
 caging or dowels occupy only the upper section of the pile. In this case, do not place bar reinforcement in the pile casing
 or shell until the concrete placed in the casing has reached the elevation of the lowest end of the bar reinforcement. At
 this point, rigidly set the bar reinforcement in the casing, and continue to place the concrete until the cut-off elevation is
 reached. Concrete must remain plastic throughout the duration of its placement. When bar reinforcement caging or
 dowels occupy only the upper section of the pile, reinforcement may be secured prior to placing any concrete if an
 "elephant trunk" is used to deposit concrete in the portion of the pile below the bottom elevation of the reinforcement.
 Do not disturb piles with freshly placed concrete until 50 percent of the 28-day strength is achieved.
 605.04 Method of Measurement.
 The Engineer will measure work acceptably completed as specified in Section 109.01 and as follows:
 
 A. Timber, Steel H, Precast Concrete and Cast-in-Place Pipe (or Shell Concrete) Piles Furnished. The
 Engineer will measure the quantity of piles furnished as determined by the Department by the total length
 of piles in Linear Feet. When extensions of piles are necessary, the extension length authorized in writing
 by the Engineer will be included in the quantity of piling furnished.

 B. Timber, Steel H, Precast Concrete and Cast-in-Place Pipe (or Shell Concrete) Piles Driven. The Engineer
 will measure piles driven by the Linear Feet of piling in place measured below the cutoff elevation.
 
 C. Dynamic Pile Testing. The Engineer will measure dynamic pile testing on an Each basis upon receipt of
 acceptable associated dynamic testing report(s). The Engineer will measure each initial drive and each restrike dynamically monitored as separate units and measured as a quantity of two (2) Each.
 
 D. Pile Re-strikes. The Engineer will measure only pile re-strikes that are additional to those described in
 Section 605.03.6. on an Each basis. Additional re-strikes may result in more than the minimum allowable
 number of pile re-strikes or the re-strike waiting times greater than specified above.
 
 E. Splices for Timber, Steel H and Cast-in-Place Pipe (or Shell Concrete) Piles. The Engineer will measure
 the quantity of pile Material used and installed in pile splices of all types of piles as the total number of
 Linear Feet of Material furnished to the site and as agreed by the Department and driven.
 
 F. Pile Build-ups and Driving Splices for Precast Concrete Piles. The Engineer will measure the additional
 length of pile for the purposes of a pile build-up or driving splice for a Precast, Prestressed Concrete Pile on
 an equivalent Linear Foot basis.
 
 G. Items Not Measured or Paid. The Engineer will exclude from measurement and will not pay for:
 1.

 606.03.2 Drilled Shaft Excavation. Excavate the drilled shafts to the required depth as shown in the Contract
 Documents or as directed by the Engineer. Once the excavation operation has been started, conduct the excavation
 in a continuous operation until the excavation of the shaft is completed, except for pauses and stops as noted, using
 approved Equipment capable of excavating through the type of material expected. Provide temporary casing at the
 site in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of the anticipated construction method.
 Pauses, defined as interruptions of the excavation operation, will be allowed only for casing splicing and removal of
 obstructions. Drilled shaft excavation operation interruptions not conforming to this definition are considered as
 stops.
 If the drilled shaft excavation is not complete at the end of the shift or series of continuous shifts, the drilled shaft
 excavation operation may be stopped, provided the Contractor, before the end of the Work Day, protects the shaft as
 indicated in Section 606.03.3. of this Specification.
 If slurry is present in the shaft excavation, conform to the requirements of Section 606.03.4.D.2. of this Specification
 regarding the maintenance of the minimum level of drilling slurry throughout the stoppage of the shaft excavation
 operation, and recondition the slurry to the required slurry properties in accordance with Section 606.02 of this
 Specification prior to recommencing shaft excavation operations.
 Ensure the excavation and drilling Equipment have adequate capacity, including power, torque and down thrust to
 excavate a hole of both the maximum diameter and to a depth of 20 feet, or 20 percent, beyond the maximum shaft
 length shown in the Contract Documents, whichever is greater.
 Blasting will only be permitted if specifically stated in the Contract Documents or authorized in writing by the
 Engineer.
 Perform sidewall overreaming when the time for shaft excavation exceeds 36 hours or as directed by the Engineer
 (measured from the beginning of excavation below the casing when casing is used) before the start of concrete
 placement. Also perform sidewall overreaming when the sidewall of the hole is determined by the Engineer to have
 softened due to the excavation methods, swelled due to delays in the start of concrete placement, or degraded
 because of slurry cake buildup. Overreaming thickness must be a minimum of 1/2 inch and a maximum of 3 inches.
 Overreaming may be accomplished with a grooving tool, overreaming bucket, or other Equipment approved by the
 Engineer. If overreaming is required as a result of the excavation time exceeding the time limit specified herein, or
 as a result of excavation methods not in compliance with the approved Drilled Shaft Installation Plan, the Contractor
 will solely bear the costs associated with both sidewall overreaming and additional drilled shaft concrete related to
 overreaming.
 Complete excavation to the foundation cap elevation before drilled shaft construction begins, unless otherwise noted
 in the Contract Documents or approved by the Engineer. Any disturbance to the foundation cap area caused by shaft
 installation will be repaired by the Contractor prior to placing the cap concrete.
 When drilled shafts are to be installed in conjunction with Embankment construction, construct drilled shafts after
 placement of the Embankment fill unless otherwise shown in the Contract Documents or approved by the Engineer.
 Do not cap the drilled shafts installed prior to the completion of the Embankment fill until the fill has been placed to
 the bottom of cap level.
 606.03.3 Drilled Shaft Excavation Protection. Do not leave drilled shaft excavations open overnight unless cased
 full depth or otherwise protected against sidewall instability. An open excavation is defined as a drilled shaft that has
 not been filled with concrete, or temporarily backfilled with a Material approved by the Engineer in accordance with
 
 606 - 5
 
 DRILLED SHAFTS
 
 SECTION 606
 
 Section 606.03.1.B of this Specification or protected in accordance with Section 606.03.4. The use of slurry to
 protect a drilled shaft during a drilling stoppage or overnight shutdown may be approved by the Engineer.
 Casing of drilled shafts in stable rock formations during stoppages is not required, unless shown in the Contract
 Documents or specified herein.
 606.03.4 Drilled Shaft Excavation Protection Methods. The Contractor bears full responsibility for selection and
 execution of the method(s) of stabilizing and maintaining the drilled shaft excavation. Protect the walls and bottom
 of the drilled shaft excavation so that side wall caving and bottom heave is prevented from occurring, and so that the
 soil adjacent to the drilled shaft is not disturbed. The Contractor may excavate the drilled shaft without excavation
 protection provided the Contractor can demonstrate that the soil/rock is stable and above the water table and zones
 of seepage. Acceptable protection methods include the use of casing, drilling slurry, or both.
 A. Temporary Casing Construction Method. In stable soils, conduct casing installation and removal operations
 and drilled shaft excavation operations such that the adjacent soil outside the casing and drilled shaft
 excavation for the full height of the drilled shaft is not disturbed. Disturbed soil is defined as soil whose
 geotechnical properties have been changed from those of the original in-situ soil, and whose altered
 condition adversely affects the performance of the drilled shaft foundation.
 If utilizing casing that is adequately sealed into competent soils such that water cannot enter the excavation,
 the Contractor may, with the Engineer’s approval, continue excavation in soils below the water table
 provided the water level within the casing does not rise or exhibit flow.
 As the temporary casing is withdrawn, a sufficient head of fluid concrete must be maintained to ensure that
 water or slurry outside the temporary casing will not breach the column of freshly placed concrete.
 Extract the casing at a slow, uniform rate with the pull in line with the shaft axis. Avoid excessive rotation
 of the casing to limit deformation of the reinforcing steel cage.
 Remove all temporary casings from the excavation as concrete placement is completed, unless permission
 has been received from the Engineer to leave specified temporary casings in place.
 B. Permanent Casing Construction Method. When permanent casing is specified, excavation will conform to
 the specified outside diameter of the drilled shaft. After the casing has been filled with concrete, fill all void
 space occurring between the casing and drilled shaft excavation with a Material that approximates the
 geotechnical properties of the in-situ soils, in accordance with the Drilled Shaft Installation Plan specified
 in Section 606.03.1.B of this Specification, and as approved by the Engineer.
 When the shaft extends above ground or through a body of water, the portion exposed above ground or
 through a body of water may be formed with removable casing except when the permanent casing is
 specified. Strip the removable casing from the shaft in a manner that will not damage the concrete. Casings
 can be removed when the concrete has attained sufficient strength provided:
 1.
 
 The shaft concrete is not exposed to salt water or moving water for 7 Days.
 
 2.
 
 The concrete reaches a compressive strength of at least 2500 pounds per square inch, as determined
 from concrete cylinder breaks.
 
 Use of removable casing is permitted only if specified in the Contract Documents or approved by the
 Engineer. Use removable casing in accordance with the Equipment and procedures shown in the approved
 Drilled Shaft Installation Plan, and comply with all other requirements specified herein.
 C. Alternative Casing Methods. When approved by the Engineer, installation of casing using rotating,
 oscillating, or vibrating methods will be permitted. Use this alternative casing method in accordance with
 the Equipment and procedures shown in the approved Drilled Shaft Installation Plan, and comply with all
 other requirements specified herein.
 Equip drilled shaft casing with cutting teeth or a cutting shoe and install by rotating, oscillating, or
 vibrating the casing.

 D. Slurry. Use slurry in accordance with Section 606.02 of this Specification to maintain a stable excavation
 during excavation and concrete placement operations once water begins to enter the drilled shaft excavation
 and remains present.
 Use slurry to maintain stability during drilled shaft excavation and concrete placement operations in the
 event that water begins to enter the drilled shaft excavation at a rate of greater than twelve inches per hour,
 or if the Contactor is not able to restrict the amount of water in the drilled shaft to less than three inches
 prior to concrete placement, or to equilibrate water pressure on the sides and base of the drilled shaft
 excavation when groundwater is encountered or anticipated based on the available subsurface data.
 1.
 
 Slurry Technical Assistance. If slurry is used, the manufacturer's representative, as identified to the
 Engineer in accordance with Section 606.03.1.C. of this Specification, must:
 a.
 
 Provide technical assistance for the use of the slurry.
 
 b.
 
 Be present at the site prior to introduction of the slurry into a drilled hole.
 
 c.
 
 Remain at the site during the construction and completion of a minimum of one drilled shaft to
 adjust the slurry mix to the specific site conditions.
 
 After the manufacturer’s representative is no longer present at the site, the Contractor’s employee trained in
 the use of the slurry, as identified to the Engineer in accordance with Section 606.03.1.C. of this
 Specification, must be present at the site throughout the remainder of shaft slurry operations for this project
 to perform the duties specified above.
 2.
 
 Minimum Level of Slurry in the Excavation. When slurry is used to maintain a stable excavation,
 maintain the slurry level in the excavation to obtain hydrostatic equilibrium throughout the
 construction operation at a height required to provide and maintain a stable hole, but not less than 5
 feet above the water table or surface of surrounding water body if at an offshore location.
 Provide casing, or other means, as necessary to meet these requirements.
 Maintain the slurry level above all unstable zones a sufficient distance to prevent bottom heave,
 caving, or sloughing of those zones.
 Throughout all stops in drilled shaft excavation operations, monitor and maintain the slurry level in the
 excavation the greater of the following elevations:
 a.
 
 No lower than the water level elevation outside the drilled shaft.
 
 b.
 
 Elevation as required to provide and maintain a stable hole.
 
 3. Cleaning Slurry. Clean, re-circulate, de-sand, or replace the slurry, as needed, in order to maintain the
 required slurry properties. Sand content will only be required to be within specified limits immediately
 prior to concrete placement.
 606.03.5 Obstructions. When obstructions are encountered, notify the Engineer promptly. An obstruction is defined
 as a specific object (including, but not limited to, boulders, logs, and man-made objects) encountered during the
 drilled shaft excavation operation that prevents or hinders the advance of the drilled shaft excavation. When efforts
 to advance past the obstruction to the design drilled shaft tip elevation result in the rate of advance of the drilled
 shaft drilling Equipment being significantly reduced relative to the rate of advance for the portion of the drilled shaft
 excavation in the geological unit that contains the obstruction, then remove, bypass or break up the obstruction
 under force account. Blasting will not be permitted unless approved in writing by the Engineer.
 Drilling tools that are lost in the excavation will not be considered obstructions, and will be promptly removed by
 the Contractor. All costs due to lost tool removal will be borne solely by the Contractor including, but not limited to,
 costs associated with the repair of hole degradation due to removal operations or an excessive time that the hole
 remains open.
 606.03.6 Protection of Existing Structures. Control operations to prevent damage to existing Structures, utilities,
 roadways, and other facilities. Include preventive measures, which include, but are not limited to, selecting
 construction methods and procedures that will prevent excessive caving of the drilled shaft excavation and
 
 606 - 7
 
 DRILLED SHAFTS
 
 SECTION 606
 
 monitoring and controlling the vibrations from the driving of casing or sheeting, drilling of the shaft, or from
 blasting, if permitted by the Engineer.
 606.03.7 Slurry Sampling and Testing. Mix and thoroughly hydrate mineral slurry and polymer slurry in slurry
 tanks, lined ponds, or storage areas. Draw sample sets from the slurry storage facility and test the samples for
 conformance with the appropriate specified Material properties before beginning slurry placement in the drilled
 hole. Ensure that the slurry conforms to the quality control plan included in the Drilled Shaft Installation Plan in
 accordance with Section 606.03.1.B. of this Specification and as approved by the Engineer. A sample set must be
 composed of samples taken at mid-height and within two feet of the bottom of the storage area.
 Sample and test all slurry in the presence of the Engineer, unless otherwise approved by the Engineer. Record the
 date, time, names of the persons sampling and testing the slurry, and the results of the tests. Submit a copy of the
 recorded slurry test results to the Engineer at the completion of each drilled shaft, and during construction of each
 drilled shaft when requested by the Engineer.
 Take and test sample sets of all slurry, composed of samples taken at mid-height and within two feet of the bottom
 of the drilled shaft, during drilling as necessary to verify the control of the properties of the slurry. As a minimum,
 take and test the sample sets of polymer slurry at least once every four hours after beginning its use during each
 shift.
 Take and test sample sets of all slurry, as specified, immediately prior to placing concrete.
 Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Engineer that stable conditions are being maintained. If the Engineer
 determines that stable conditions are not being maintained, immediately take action to stabilize the shaft. Submit a
 revised Drilled Shaft Installation Plan that addresses the problem and prevents future instability. Do not continue
 with drilled shaft construction until the damage that has already occurred is repaired in accordance with the
 Specifications, and until receiving the Engineer's approval of the revised Drilled Shaft Installation Plan.
 606.03.8 Drilled Shaft Excavation Inspection. Use appropriate means, such as a cleanout bucket, air lift, or
 hydraulic pump, to clean the bottom of the excavation of all drilled shafts. The base of the drilled shaft excavation
 cannot be covered with more than three inches of sediment or loose or disturbed material just prior to placing
 concrete in soil shafts or more than one-half inch for 50 percent of the shaft area in rock sockets.
 The excavated drilled shaft will be inspected and approved by the Engineer prior to proceeding with construction.
 Sound the bottom of the excavated drilled shaft with an airlift pipe, a tape with a heavy weight attached to the end of
 the tape, a borehole camera with visual sediment depth measurement gauge, or other means acceptable to the
 Engineer, to determine that the drilled shaft bottom meets the requirements in the Contract Documents.
 606.03.9 Assembly and Placement of Reinforcing Steel. Prior to and during fabrication of the steel reinforcing
 cage, support the reinforcing bars off the ground surface, and protect the reinforcing bars from contamination with
 mud and other deleterious materials.
 Rigidly brace the reinforcing cage to retain its configuration during handling and construction. Individual or loose
 bars will not be permitted. Tie all (100 percent) intersections of vertical and horizontal bars. Show bracing and any
 extra reinforcing steel required for fabrication of the cage on the Working Drawings.
 Carefully position and securely fasten the reinforcement to provide the minimum clearances specified or shown in
 the Contract Documents, and to ensure that no displacement of the reinforcing steel cage occurs during placement of
 the concrete.
 Splicing of the reinforcement cage during placement of the cage in the shaft excavation will not be permitted unless
 otherwise shown in the Contract Documents or approved by the Engineer.
 Bundle vertical bars when necessary to maximize clear space between vertical reinforcement bars. Use rolled hoops
 or bundled spirals when necessary to maximize clear space between horizontal reinforcement.
 If the reinforcing cage is spliced during placement of the cage into the drilled shaft excavation, the splice details and
 location of the splices must be in accordance with the Contract Documents and the approved Drilled Shaft
 Installation Plan. In addition, perform the Work within the time limits specified in Section 606.03.1.
 
 606 - 8
 
 DRILLED SHAFTS
 
 SECTION 606
 
 Securely hold the steel reinforcing cage in position throughout the concrete placement operation. Tie and support the
 reinforcing steel in the drilled shaft so that the location of the reinforcing steel will remain within allowable
 tolerance. Use concrete spacers or other approved non-corrosive spacing devices at sufficient intervals (near the
 bottom, the top and at intervals not exceeding 10 feet vertically) to ensure concentric spacing for the entire cage
 length. The number of spacers required at each level will be one spacer for each foot of excavation diameter, with a
 minimum of four spacers at each level. The spacers must be of adequate dimension to ensure an annular space
 between the outside of the reinforcing cage and the side of the excavation along the entire length of the drilled shaft
 as shown in the Contract Documents. Provide acceptable feet made of plastic, or concrete (bottom supports) to
 ensure that the bottom of the cage is maintained at the proper distance above the base of the excavation unless the
 cage is suspended from a fixed base during the concrete pour.
 Remove bracing steel that constricts the interior of the reinforcing cage after lifting the cage if freefall concrete or
 wet tremie methods of concrete placement are to be used.
 Check the elevation of the top of the steel cage before and after the concrete is placed. If the upward displacement of
 the rebar cage exceeds 2 inches, or if the downward displacement exceeds 6 inches, the drilled shaft will be
 considered defective. Make corrections to the satisfaction of the Engineer. Do not construct additional drilled shafts
 until the rebar cage support has been modified in a manner satisfactory to the Engineer.
 606.03.10 Concrete Placement, Curing and Protection. Commence the concrete placement as soon as possible
 after completion of drilled shaft excavation by the Contractor and inspection by the Engineer. Continue the concrete
 placement in one operation to the top of the drilled shaft, or as shown in the Contract Documents.
 If water is not present (a dry shaft), deposit the concrete through the center of the reinforcement cage by a method
 that prevents segregation of aggregates. Place the concrete such that the free-fall is vertical down the center of the
 drilled shaft without hitting the sides, the steel reinforcing bars, or the steel reinforcing bar cage bracing.
 If water exists in amounts greater than three inches in depth or enters at a rate of more than twelve inches per hour,
 then fill the drilled shaft excavation with slurry to at least the level specified in Section 606.03.4.D.2. and with
 concrete placed by tremie methods.
 Do not exceed the time limit for concrete placement as defined in the approved Drilled Shaft Installation Plan and
 demonstrated by a successful technique shaft or test shaft. Commence the concrete placement time at the mixing of
 the concrete and extend through to the completion of placement of the concrete in the drilled shaft excavation,
 including removal of any temporary casing. For wet placement methods, the placement time starts at the batching of
 the initial load of concrete to be placed in the shaft. Prior to concrete placement, provide test results of both a trial
 mix and a slump loss test conducted by an approved testing laboratory using approved methods to demonstrate that
 the concrete meets this defined placement time limit. Maintain the concrete mix with a slump of 4 inches or greater
 over the defined placement time limit as demonstrated by trial mix and slump loss tests. Conduct the trial mix and
 slump loss tests at ambient temperatures appropriate for site conditions. Ambient air temperature at the time of
 concrete placement is not permitted to be greater than the ambient temperature at the time of the concrete trial tests
 and slump loss tests.
 Use only concrete mix design approved for use and included with the approved Drilled Shaft Installation Plan.
 Adjust all admixtures, when approved for use, for the conditions encountered on the job so the concrete remains in a
 workable plastic state throughout placement.
 Throughout the underwater concrete placement operation, the discharge end of the tube must remain immersed in
 the concrete at a depth to prevent water from entering. The concrete placement must be continuous until the Work is
 completed, resulting in a seamless, uniform shaft. If the concrete placement operation is interrupted, the Engineer
 may require the Contractor to prove by core drilling or other tests that the drilled shaft contains no voids or
 horizontal joints. If testing reveals voids or joints, repair them or replace the drilled shaft at no expense to the
 Department. Responsibility for coring and testing costs, and calculation of time extension, will be in accordance
 with Section 606.03.13. of this Specification.
 Before placing any fresh concrete against concrete deposited in water or slurry (construction joint), remove all scum,
 laitance, loose gravel and sediment on the surface of the concrete deposited in water or slurry, and chip off any high
 
 606 - 9
 
 DRILLED SHAFTS
 
 SECTION 606
 
 spots on the surface of the existing concrete that would prevent any steel reinforcing bar cage from being placed in
 the position required by the Contract Documents.
 Complete a concrete yield plot for each wet shaft poured by tremie methods. Submit yield plot to the Department
 within twenty four (24) hours of completion of the concrete pour.
 Do not perform casing installation or drilled shaft excavation operations within a clear distance of three diameters of
 a newly poured drilled shaft within twenty (24) hours of the placement of concrete and only when the concrete has
 reached a minimum compressive strength of 1800 pounds per square inch.
 606.03.11 Tremies. When placing concrete underwater, use a concrete pump or gravity tremie. A tremie must have a
 hopper at the top that empties into a watertight tube at least eight inches in diameter. If a pump is used, a watertight
 tube must be used with a minimum diameter of four inches. The discharge end of the tube on the tremie or concrete
 pump line must include a device to seal out water while the tube is first filled with concrete. In lieu of a seal at the
 discharge end of the pipe, the Contractor may opt to place a “Pig” or “Rabbit” in the hopper prior to concrete
 placement which moves through the tremie when pushed by the concrete, forcing water or slurry from the tremie
 pipe.
 Do not use hopper and tubes that contain aluminum parts that will have contact with the concrete. The inside and
 outside surfaces of the tubes must be clean and smooth to allow both flow of concrete and the unimpeded
 withdrawal of the tube during concrete placement.
 606.03.12 Drilled Shaft Construction Tolerances. Construct the drilled shafts so that the center of the poured
 shaft at the top of the drilled shaft or mudline, whichever is lower, is within the following horizontal tolerances:
 Drilled Shaft Diameter
 
 Tolerance
 
 Greater than 24 inches and less than 60 inches
 
 4 inches
 
 60 inches or larger
 
 6 inches
 
 Drilled shafts in soil must be within 1.5 percent of plumb. Drilled shafts in rock must be within 2.0 percent of
 plumb. Plumbness will be measured from the top of poured drilled shaft elevation or mudline, whichever is lower.
 During drilling or excavation of the drilled shaft, make frequent checks on the plumbness, alignment, and
 dimensions of the drilled shaft. Submit procedure for correction of any deviations exceeding the allowable
 tolerances, for approval. Correct any deviations in accordance with the approved procedure.
 Do not allow the drilled shaft steel reinforcing bars to be higher than six inches above or three inches below the
 elevation shown in the Contract Documents.
 The reinforcing cage must be concentric with the drilled shaft excavation within a tolerance of 1-1/2 inches.
 The top elevation of the completed drilled shaft shall be within a tolerance of plus one inch or minus three inches.
 Do not allow the diameter of the drilled shaft to be less than the diameter shown in the Contract Documents.
 Ensure that tolerances for casings are in accordance with American Petroleum Institute (API) tolerances applicable
 to regular steel pipe.
 Drilled shaft excavations and completed drilled shafts not constructed within the required tolerances will be
 considered defective. The Contractor is responsible for correcting all defective drilled shafts to the satisfaction of the
 Engineer. Submit redesign drawings and computations, signed by a registered Professional Engineer licensed in the
 State of Delaware. Materials and Work necessary, including engineering analysis and redesign, to complete
 corrections for out-of-tolerance drilled shafts will be furnished without cost to the Department and without an
 extension of the Completion date of the Project.
 606.03.13 Integrity Testing. Crosshole sonic log (CSL) testing must be performed on all drilled shafts in
 accordance with ASTM D6760. Accommodate the crosshole sonic log testing by furnishing and installing access
 tubes.
 
 606 - 10
 
 DRILLED SHAFTS
 
 SECTION 606
 
 Install access tubes for crosshole sonic log testing in all drilled shafts, except as otherwise noted herein, to permit
 access for the crosshole sonic log test probes. If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the condition of the drilled shaft
 excavation permits drilled shaft construction in the dry, the Engineer may specify that the testing be omitted.
 Securely attach the access tubes to the interior of the reinforcement cage of the drilled shaft. Furnish and install one
 access tube for each foot of drilled shaft diameter, rounded to the nearest whole number, unless otherwise shown in
 the Contract Documents. A minimum of three tubes will be required. Place the access tubes around the drilled shaft,
 inside the spiral or hoop reinforcement and three inches clear of the vertical reinforcement, at a uniform spacing
 measured along the circle passing through the centers of the access tubes. If these minimums cannot be met due to
 close spacing of the vertical reinforcement, then bundle the access tubes with the vertical reinforcement.
 If trimming the cage is required and access tubes for crosshole sonic log testing are attached to the cage, either shift
 the access tubes up the cage, or cut the access tubes provided that the cut tube ends are adapted to receive the
 watertight cap as specified.
 Install the access tubes in straight alignment and as near to parallel to the vertical axis of the reinforcement cage as
 possible. Extend the access tubes from the bottom of the drilled shaft to at least two feet above the top of the drilled
 shaft. Splice joints in the access tubes, if required to achieve full-length access tubes, must be watertight. Clear the
 access tubes of all debris and extraneous materials before installing the access tubes. Care must be taken to prevent
 damaging the access tubes during reinforcement cage installation and concrete placement operations in the drilled
 shaft excavation.
 Fill the access tubes with potable water before concrete placement, and reinstall the top watertight, threaded caps.
 Prior to performing any crosshole sonic log testing operations specified in this subsection, remove the concrete at
 the top of the drilled shaft down to sound concrete.
 The Department will perform crosshole sonic log testing and analysis on all completed drilled shafts designated for
 testing by the Engineer. The Department will require advance notice from the Contractor to schedule all crosshole
 sonic log testing. Provide at least forty eight (48) hours’ notice to the Engineer of the time the concrete in each
 drilled shaft is to be sufficiently cured to allow for crosshole sonic log testing.
 The Engineer will determine final acceptance of each drilled shaft, based on the crosshole sonic log test results and
 analysis for the tested shafts and a review of the visual inspection reports for the subject drilled shaft, and will
 provide a response to the Contractor within three Working Days after receiving the test results and analysis
 submittal. Perform the testing after the drilled shaft concrete has cured at least ninety six (96) hours. Additional
 curing time prior to testing may be required if the drilled shaft concrete contains admixtures, such as a set retarding
 admixture or a water-reducing admixture. The additional curing time prior to testing required under these
 circumstances will not serve as grounds for additional compensation or extension of time to the Contractor. Do not
 perform any subsequent construction on the completed drilled shaft until the CSL tests are approved and the drilled
 shaft is accepted by the Engineer.
 After placing the drilled shaft concrete and before beginning the crosshole sonic log testing of a drilled shaft, inspect
 the access tubes. Replace each access tube that the test probe cannot pass through, at no cost to the Department, with
 a two inch diameter hole cored through the concrete for the entire length of the drilled shaft. Unless directed
 otherwise by the Engineer, locate the cored holes approximately six inches inside the reinforcement and do not
 damage the drilled shaft reinforcement. Log descriptions of inclusions and voids in cored holes and submit a copy of
 the log to the Engineer. Findings from cored holes must be preserved, identified as to location, and made available
 for inspection by the Engineer.
 The Engineer will determine final acceptance of each drilled shaft, based on the crosshole sonic log test results and
 analysis for the tested shafts and a review of the visual inspection reports for the subject drilled shaft, and will
 provide a response to the Contractor within three Working Days after receiving the test results and analysis
 submittal.
 The Engineer may approve continuing with drilled shaft construction prior to approval and acceptance of the first
 shaft if the Engineer’s observations of the construction of the first shaft are satisfactory, including, but not limited to,
 conformance to the Drilled Shaft Installation Plan as approved by the Engineer, and the Engineer’s review of
 
 606 - 11
 
 DRILLED SHAFTS
 
 SECTION 606
 
 Contractor’s daily reports and Inspector’s daily logs concerning excavation, steel reinforcing bar placement, and
 concrete placement.
 If the Engineer determines that the concrete placed under slurry for a given drilled shaft is structurally inadequate,
 that drilled shaft will be rejected. The placement of concrete under slurry will be suspended until the Contractor
 submits to the Engineer written changes to the methods of drilled shaft construction needed to prevent future
 structurally inadequate drilled shafts, and receives the Engineer's written approval of the submittal.
 If the Engineer determines that additional investigation is necessary, or if the Contractor requests, the Engineer may
 direct that additional testing be performed at a drilled shaft. At the Engineer's request, drill a corehole in any
 questionable quality drilled shaft (as determined from crosshole sonic log testing and analysis or by observation of
 the Engineer) to explore the drilled shaft condition. The number, locations, diameter and depth of the core holes and
 lengths of individual core runs will be determined by the Engineer. Coring procedures must minimize abrasion and
 erosion of the core samples, and must avoid damage to the steel reinforcement. Log descriptions of inclusions and
 voids in cored holes and submit a copy of the log to the Engineer. Preserve the recovered core in suitably labeled
 wood core boxes, identified as to location and depth, and make available for inspection by the Engineer. The
 Engineer may direct water-pressure testing in the core holes, and/or unconfined compression testing and other
 laboratory testing on selected samples from the concrete core.
 If subsequent testing at a drilled shaft indicates the presence of a defect(s) in the drilled shaft, the testing costs and
 the delay costs resulting from the additional testing will be borne solely by the Contractor. If this additional testing
 indicates that the drilled shaft has no defect, the testing costs and the delay costs resulting from the additional testing
 will be paid by the Department, and, if the drilled shaft construction is on the critical path of the Contractor’s
 Schedule, a time extension equal to the delay created by the additional testing will be granted.
 For all drilled shafts determined to be unacceptable, submit a plan for further investigation or remedial action to the
 Engineer for approval. All modifications to the dimensions of the drilled shafts, as shown in the Contract
 Documents, required by the investigation and remedial action plan, must be supported by calculations and Working
 Drawings. All investigation and remedial correction procedures and designs must be prepared by a registered
 Professional Engineer licensed in the State of Delaware, and submitted to the Engineer for approval. Do not begin
 repair operations until receiving the Engineer's written approval of the investigation and remedial action plan.
 Prior to beginning coring, submit the method and Equipment to be used to drill and remove cores from drilled shaft
 concrete to the Engineer, and do not begin coring until the Engineer’s written approval has been received. Recover
 the complete core and minimize abrasion and erosion of the core.
 Dewater all access tubes and cored holes and fill with grout after tests are completed and the drilled shaft is
 accepted. Fill the access tubes and cored holes using grout tubes that extend to the bottom of the tube or hole or into
 the grout already placed. Alternative non-destructive tests such as Gamma-Gamma, Sonic Echo/Impulse Response
 (ASTM D5882), or Thermal Integrity Profiling (ASTM D7949) may be specified in the Contract Documents or
 directed by the Engineer to use alongside, or in lieu of, CSL testing. Comply with all requirements for the alternate
 test methods in accordance with the Contract Documents.
 606.03.14 Drilled Shaft Load Tests. Install test shafts at the locations shown in the Contract Documents unless
 otherwise directed or approved by the Engineer.
 Install test shafts to the same dimensions, details, and elevations shown in the Contract Documents, and install using
 the same Equipment and installation procedures proposed for installation of the foundation drilled shafts.
 If the Equipment or procedures are changed following the completion of load testing, install additional load test
 shafts, and conduct additional load tests as directed by the Engineer at no additional cost to the Department.
 Complete all load testing and have the results evaluated by the Engineer before installing any production drilled
 shafts, unless otherwise authorized by the Engineer.
 A. Static Load Tests. Perform static load tests in accordance with the procedures specified in ASTM D 1143.
 B. Force Pulse (Rapid) Load Tests. Perform force pulse (rapid) load tests in accordance with the procedures
 specified in ASTM D 7383.

 SECTION 606
 
 C. Bi-Directional Load Cell Testing. Install load cells and load test instrumentation in accordance with the bidirectional load cell supplier recommendations, instructions, and procedure manual(s), as approved by the
 Engineer.
 The bi-directional load cells must be capable of expanding to not less than 6 inches while maintaining the
 applied test load.
 Coordinate with the load cell supplier to determine and/or verify all required Equipment, Materials, quantities,
 procedures, and all other applicable items necessary to complete the load testing shown in the Contract Documents.
 Furnish an acceptable pressurized gas source, a hydraulic pump, hydraulic lines, calibrated hydraulic gauge and
 other Equipment and Material necessary to perform the load tests. Furnish fresh, potable water from an approved
 source to form the hydraulic fluid used to pressurize the bi-directional load cells.
 Furnish, install, and monitor vibrating wire strain gauges as shown in the Contract Documents and as directed by the
 Engineer. Place the strain gauges in pairs on opposite sides of the reinforcing cage at the elevations shown in the
 Contract Documents, unless otherwise directed by the Engineer.
 Attach two Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) vibrating wire displacement gauges to each load cell
 to monitor the expansion and contraction of the load cell. In addition, mount two LVDT gauges on an independent
 reference beam and set on opposite sides of the top of the test shaft to monitor axial shaft displacement.
 Set two telltale rods on the top of each load cell to monitor the displacement of the top of the load cell. The telltale
 must consist of a 3/8 inch diameter stainless steel rod, greased for reducing friction and corrosion, and placed inside
 a constant 3/4-inch diameter pipe. Individual sections of telltales must be joint-coupled flush so that each rod is of
 uniform diameter throughout its length.
 Furnish a portable computer and electronic logging Equipment to simultaneously monitor all instrumentation at time
 intervals designated by the Engineer.
 Assemble the load cells, piping, and other attachments in preparation for installation in accordance with the
 requirements of the bi-directional load cell supplier, unless otherwise specified herein or directed by the Engineer.
 The following guidelines must be followed.
 A. Weld steel top and bottom bearing plates to the load cells. Provide holes through the bearing plates, as
 appropriate, to facilitate placement of tremie concrete.
 B. Coat the upper surface of the bottom steel bearing plate with grease prior to installation into the shaft, to
 prevent concrete bonding with the bottom plate.
 C. Attach the load cells and plate assembly to the reinforcement cage. Securely fasten all hydraulic hoses,
 telltale casing, slip joints, etc. to the rebar cage. Prior to installation into the drilled shaft excavation, protect
 the top of any piping to keep dirt, concrete, or other deleterious materials from entering the piping.
 D. Limit the deflection of the cage to a maximum of 2 feet between pick points while lifting the cage from the
 horizontal position to vertical. Provide additional support, bracing, strong backs, etc. to maintain the
 deflection within the specified tolerance.
 For each load test, place the load on the drilled shaft in increments of five percent of the estimated maximum test
 load shown in the Contract Documents, or until the nominal resistance load (as indicated by the instruments) is
 approached, or to the maximum capacity of the load cell, whichever occurs first. Unless the maximum capacity of
 the load cell has been reached, apply increments of 2.5 percent of the estimated maximum test load until the limiting
 load is attained, or the drilled shaft top displacement reaches 2 inches, or to the maximum extension of the load cell.
 When the load cell will be used for a subsequent loading stage, the Engineer may interrupt the loading sequence at a
 load cell opening of approximately 3 inches, or less. Maintain each load increment for a minimum period of 5
 minutes, with complete sets of readings obtained and recorded from all gauges and instruments at 1, 2 and 5 minutes
 after application of the load increment. Apply each increment of load within the minimum length of time practical
 and take the instrument system readings immediately. It is intended that the addition of a load increment and the
 completion of the instrument system readings be completed within 5 to 15 minutes. The Engineer may elect to hold
 the maximum applied load for up to one hour.
 
 606 - 13
 
 DRILLED SHAFTS
 
 SECTION 606
 
 Remove the load in decrements of approximately 10 percent of the maximum test load. Remove each decrement of
 load within the minimum length of time practical and take the instrument system readings immediately. It is
 intended that the removal of a load decrement and the completion of the instrument system readings be completed
 within 5 to 15 minutes. The Engineer may also require a reloading cycle with ten loading increments and five
 unloading decrements. Record the final recovery of the drilled shaft for a period up to one hour after the last unload
 interval.
 Submit a preliminary test report containing the load displacement curves and other test data to the Engineer within
 three Days of completing each load test. Submit the final report on the load tests to the Engineer within ten Days
 after completion of each load test. Include at least the following items in the test report:
 A. Test shaft identification number and location.
 B. Date(s) of testing.
 C. Description of the test shaft details, instrumentation, and test procedures.
 D. Tables presenting all instrumentation data.
 E. Plots of load versus displacement (up and down) for each load cell level, for each stage of the test.
 F.
 
 Plots of load along the length of the drilled shaft determined from the strain gauge data for at least ten
 applied load increments.
 
 G. Summary of unit side resistance along the length of the drilled shaft and end bearing resistance.
 H. Plots of creep displacement for each load increment.
 I.
 
 Plot of equivalent top-of-shaft displacement for the test shaft, developed from the load test data.
 
 After completion of the load test to the satisfaction of the Engineer, and when authorized in writing by the Engineer,
 flush all hydraulic fluid from the bi-directional load cells and hydraulic lines, and replace with cement grout in
 accordance with the approved Drilled Shaft Installation Plan. Grout any voids remaining outside the load cells after
 completion of the load test.
 606.03.15 Technique Shafts. Demonstrate the adequacy of its methods, techniques, and Equipment by successfully
 constructing a technique shaft or shafts in accordance with the requirements shown in the Contract Documents.
 Position the technique shaft(s) at the location(s) shown in the Contract Documents or as directed by the Engineer,
 but not less than a clear distance of three drilled shaft diameters from the closest production shaft. Drill the
 technique shaft(s) to the maximum diameter and maximum depth of any production drilled shaft shown in the
 Contract Documents. Unless shown otherwise in the Contract Documents, reinforce the technique shaft(s) with the
 same reinforcement as the corresponding size production shaft, and also include CSL tubes as specified herein.
 Technique shaft(s) must be completed and accepted by the Engineer prior to initiating installation of the load test
 shafts and foundation drilled shafts. Failure by the Contractor to demonstrate to the Engineer the adequacy of
 methods and Equipment will be reason for the Engineer to require alterations in Equipment and/or method by the
 Contractor to eliminate unsatisfactory results. Any additional technique shaft(s) required demonstrating the
 adequacy of altered methods or construction Equipment will be at no cost to the Department. Once approval has
 been given by the Engineer to construct production drilled shafts, no changes will be permitted in the methods or
 Equipment used to construct the satisfactory technique shaft(s) without the written approval of the Engineer.
 The technique shaft(s) will be used by the Engineer to determine if the Contractor can:
 A. Control dimensions and alignment of excavations within tolerance.
 B. Install casing and remove temporary casing.
 C. Seal the casing in impervious materials.
 D. Control the size of the excavation under caving conditions by the use of a mineral or polymer slurry or by
 other means.
 E. Properly clean the completed drilled shaft excavation.
 F.
 
 Construct drilled shafts in open water areas.

 2.
 
 3.
 
 Design. Meet the following criteria for the design of stay-in-place bridge deck forms:
 a.
 
 Include an analysis of the actual unit weight of the proposed forming system over the projected
 plan area of the metal forms. If the weight thus calculated exceeds the weight allowance for stayin-place metal forms and concrete required to fill the forms shown in the Contract Documents,
 submit a method to modify the supporting components to support the excess weight at no
 additional cost to the Department.
 
 b.
 
 Design the forms on the basis of dead load of form, reinforcement, and plastic concrete plus 50
 pounds per square foot for construction loads. Use a unit working stress in the steel sheet of not
 more than 0.725 of the specified minimum yield strength of the material furnished, but not to
 exceed 36,000 pounds per square inch.
 
 c.
 
 Do not allow deflection under the weight of the forms, reinforcement, and plastic concrete to
 exceed 1/180 of the form span or 1/2 inch, whichever is less, for form spans of 10 feet or less, or
 1/240 of the form span or 3/4 inch, whichever is less, for form spans greater than 10 feet. In all
 cases, do not use a total loading (pounds per square foot) that is less than 20 plus the product of
 the deck thickness measured in inches times 12.5.
 
 d.
 
 Use a design span of the form equal to the clear span of the form plus 2 inches. Measure the span
 parallel to the form flutes.
 
 e.
 
 Compute physical design properties in accordance with requirements of the AISI Specifications
 for the Design of Cold Formed Steel Structural Members, latest published edition.
 
 f.
 
 For all reinforcement, maintain the design concrete cover required by the Contract Documents.
 
 g.
 
 Maintain the plan dimensions of both layers of primary deck reinforcement from the top surface of
 the concrete deck.
 
 h.
 
 Do not consider the permanent bridge deck form as lateral bracing for compression flanges of
 supporting structural members.
 
 i.
 
 Secure forms to flanges in tension or to structural steel bridge elements fabricated from nonweldable grades of steel by means other than welding directly to the member.
 
 Construction. Install all forms in accordance with approved fabrication and erection drawings.
 Do not rest form sheets directly on the top of the stringer of floor beam flanges. Fasten sheets securely
 to form supports, and maintain a minimum bearing length of 1 inch at each end for metal forms. Place
 form supports in direct contact with the flange of the stringer or floor beam. Make all attachments for
 coated metal forms by bolts, clips, screws, or other approved means. However, do not weld form
 supports to flanges of steels not considered weldable and to portions of a flange subject to tensile
 stresses. Ensure that welding, welder qualifications, and prequalification of weld details and inspection
 of welds meet AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code, except that 1/8 inch fillet welds will be
 permitted.
 For any permanent exposed steel where the galvanized coating has been damaged, thoroughly clean,
 wire brush, and paint it with two coats of galvanizing compound to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 Do not touch up minor heat discoloration in areas of welds.
 Lap forms in the direction consistent with the placement of the concrete. Install permanent steel bridge
 deck forms such that they are mortar tight. Ensure that slurry does not leak through the forms during
 the deck pour. Responsibility for any damage to persons or property due to leakage through the forms
 is in accordance with Section 107.10. Additional protection may be placed beneath the forms to catch
 
 610 -3
 
 CONCRETE STRUCTURES
 
 SECTION 610
 
 leakage during the deck pour if desired. Payment for additional protection or protective shielding will
 not be made.
 D. Weather and Environmental Conditions. Protect concrete from damage caused by weather or environmental
 conditions. Repair or remove and replace any damaged concrete.
 Maintain concrete mixture temperature at time of placement between 50 degrees Fahrenheit and 90 degrees
 Fahrenheit. Maintain concrete mixture temperature for bridge decks at time of placement between 50 degrees
 Fahrenheit and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
 1.
 
 Hot and Dry Weather Requirements. Keep new concrete shaded from the sun, shielded from the wind,
 and kept wet with water, or protected by other methods to retain the moisture in the concrete throughout
 the curing period. When placing concrete in hot weather, take appropriate measures to reduce the
 hazards of increased rate of cement hydration, flash set, loss of water due to evaporation, high concrete
 ingredient temperatures, and the increased difficulty of concrete placement and finishing.
 a.
 
 Concrete Temperature. Ensure the temperature of the concrete at the point of discharge does not
 exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Ensure the temperature of the concrete for bridge decks at the point
 of discharge does not exceed 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
 b.
 
 Cooling Materials. If necessary, reduce the temperature of the concrete by cooling one or more
 ingredients. Cool aggregates by fogging or other suitable means that will not result in a high
 variation of moisture content within the stockpile. Use chipped or crushed ice in the mix as a
 portion of the mixing water on a pound for pound basis, provided such measure is determined at
 the time of placement in the mix. If ice is used, melt before discharging the batch from the mixing
 unit. Cool water by refrigeration or other means that will provide a uniform mixing water
 temperature.
 
 c.
 
 Placing Concrete. Immediately before placing concrete, cool the forms, reinforcing steel and other
 surfaces that will be in contact with the concrete by water spray or other approved methods when
 the ambient temperature rises above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Ensure there is no standing water in
 the concrete forms as a result of the spraying procedures. Provide personnel and Equipment in
 accordance with the approved Placement and Curing Plan to place the concrete without delays that
 may cause excessive slump loss and evaporation due to over-mixing or exposure before placement.
 
 d.
 
 Finishing. Use windscreens of sufficient dimensions, water fogging, or other approved means of
 supplying moisture to prevent shrinkage cracking due to moisture loss. Maintain finishing
 operations as close as practicable behind the placing operation so that curing may begin as soon as
 possible.
 
 e.
 
 Protecting Bridge Deck. Protect bridge deck concrete from rapid evaporation during periods of low
 humidity, wind, or high temperatures by using methods outlined below.
 Limit the evaporation rate of the exposed concrete surface to less than 0.15 pounds per square foot
 per hour as published in the ACI 305 chart developed by Delmar Bloem. DelDOT Materials and
 Research Section can provide copies of the chart upon request.
 To maintain the deck surface evaporation rate below 0.15 pounds per square foot per hour, take one
 or more of the following actions:
 i. Mist the surface of the concrete immediately behind the finishing machine and until the curing
 cover is applied. Produce a fine fog mist with the nozzle to maintain a sheen of moisture on the
 concrete surface without ponding. Do not work any applied moisture back into the surface.
 ii. Construct windscreens or enclosures to effectively reduce the wind velocity throughout the area
 of placement.
 iii. Reduce the temperature of the concrete at placement.

 Rainy Weather Requirements. Under conditions of threatening rain, only place concrete if protection is
 provided. During rainy weather, properly cover new concrete, as necessary to prevent damage. Provide
 sufficient Material for covering at the site of the Work for immediate use.
 
 3.
 
 Cold Weather Requirements. Concrete placement is permitted when the air temperature, measured at
 the location of the concreting operation in the shade away from artificial heat is above 35 degrees
 Fahrenheit. Maintain the concrete mixture at a temperature of 55 degrees Fahrenheit or above.
 Ensure Material and Equipment required for cold weather placement and curing protection is available
 at the project site before placing concrete. Remove snow, ice, and frost from the surfaces, including
 reinforcement and subgrade against which the concrete is to be placed. Place concrete only when the
 temperatures of all surfaces that will come into contact with the concrete are at least 35 degrees
 Fahrenheit and will be maintained at a temperature of 35 degrees Fahrenheit or above during placement.
 a.
 
 Concrete Temperature. Continuously maintain the concrete surface temperature at or above the
 required temperatures indicated in Table 610.03-1. for the curing period defined in Section 610.03.I.
 Monitor maximum and minimum surface temperature with a measuring device that is accurate to
 within 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Randomly place in an accessible location one temperature measuring
 device for every 1,500 square feet of concrete surface area being cured.

 Heat the Structure uniformly and so that no part of the concrete surface is heated to more than 90
 degrees Fahrenheit, and the temperature differential between the interior and exterior of the
 element does not exceed 30 degrees Fahrenheit. Reduce heat gradually from the Structure so that
 the temperature will not drop more than 20 degrees Fahrenheit in 8 hours.
 b.
 
 Warming Materials. Maintain temperature above 55 degrees Fahrenheit by heating aggregate,
 water, or both. Limit aggregate and water temperature to a maximum of 150 degrees Fahrenheit.
 Do not heat aggregate by direct gas or oil flame or on sheet metal over fire. Add cement only after
 the combination of water and aggregate temperature is 100 degrees Fahrenheit or less.
 
 c.
 
 Heated Enclosures. Enclosures must be capable of maintaining the temperature of the Work at 50
 degrees Fahrenheit. Concrete will be protected from contact with exhaust gases from heaters.
 Maintain proper humidity for curing.
 
 d.
 
 Insulation. Place insulation on the concrete as soon as initial set will permit. Provide insulating
 blankets faced or covered, top and bottom, with polyethylene or similar waterproofing material.
 Blankets must be sufficient thickness to maintain the concrete surface temperature at or above the
 required temperatures indicated in Table 610.03-1. for the curing period defined in Section 610.03.I.
 Secure blankets around the perimeter of the Work sufficiently to minimize infiltration of ambient
 air and loss of heat during the protection period. Should the temperature of the Work fall below
 the required temperatures indicated in Table 610.03-1 during the protection period, take immediate
 corrective actions.
 
 E. Placing Concrete. Place and consolidate the concrete mix in approved forms in accordance with the
 approved plan. Place concrete within 60 minutes after adding cement to the mix, unless otherwise approved
 by the Engineer. In preparation for the placing of concrete, remove all sawdust, chips, and other construction
 debris and extraneous matter from the interior of forms. Remove hardened concrete and foreign matter from
 
 610 -5
 
 CONCRETE STRUCTURES
 
 SECTION 610
 
 tools, screeds, and conveying Equipment. Clean and clear all surfaces to come in contact with concrete.
 Moisten the forms with water before placing concrete. Place concrete continuously to prevent unplanned
 cold joints or damage to newly set concrete. Regulate the placing of concrete so that the pressures caused by
 the wet concrete do not exceed those used in the design of the forms. Thoroughly work the external surface of
 all concrete during the placing by means of tools of an approved type. Place concrete in a manner and sequence
 that does not displace reinforcement. Place concrete into forms in a method that does not segregate the mix
 from a homogenous consistency. Aluminum will not be permitted as the contact surface for concrete placed
 through any conveyance. Protect protruding steel for subsequent pours from coating with mortar and paste.
 Clean any protruding steel upon completion of the pour prior to subsequent pours. Do not harm the surface
 coating of the reinforcement steel.
 Provide adequate lighting for all concrete operations conducted at night. Obtain approval of the lighting system
 prior to starting the concrete operations.
 Place concrete as near as possible to final position. Do not move the concrete laterally with vibrators. Limit
 lift thickness to 2 feet. Do not exceed the capacity of the vibrators to consolidate and merge the concrete
 with the previous lift. Use clean, watertight Equipment and Material, but avoid those made of aluminum.
 Equip chutes on steep slopes with baffles or reverses. Do not place concrete with chute arrangements longer
 than 25 feet. Discharge concrete within 5 feet of final placement point.
 When pumping concrete, provide a conduit system consisting of 5 inches minimum inside diameter pipe.
 Prime pump with a cementitious grout material. Discharge priming grout into an approved collection area
 until fresh undiluted concrete is discharging from the pump line. Operate the pump to produce a
 continuous stream of concrete without air pockets or segregation. When pumping is completed, eject any
 concrete remaining in the pipeline which is to be used in the Work in such a manner that there will be no
 contamination of the concrete or separation of the ingredients. Provide samples of concrete to be used for
 test purposes taken from the discharge end of the conduit system as close as possible to the final position of
 the concrete.
 1.
 
 Setting Anchor Bolts. Set by template to the indicated elevation and alignment. Limit the threaded
 projection above the nut to between 3/16 inch and 1 inch.
 
 2.
 
 Consolidating Concrete. Consolidate all concrete, except underwater or other exempted placements, by
 mechanical vibration. Use internal vibration, except for thin sections, with forms designed for external
 vibration. Provide an adequate number of adequately sized vibrators to accomplish the Work, with one
 or more spare vibrators in case of breakdown. Use immersion-type vibrators featuring heads covered
 with rubber or other resilient non-metallic material to consolidate concrete reinforced with epoxy-coated
 reinforcement. Vibrate at point of deposit. Insert vibrators vertically and withdraw slowly to avoid
 segregation or grout pockets. Vibrate in a uniform pattern spaced less than 1.5 times the radius of
 visible effectiveness. Avoid vibration of hardened layers below the placement.
 
 3.
 
 Placing Concrete Underwater. Obtain written approval before depositing concrete underwater, except
 when cofferdams are used to seal out water. Equalize hydrostatic pressure on cofferdams during
 placement and cure of concrete to prevent flow of water through cofferdams during this period. Place
 concrete uniformly in its final position.
 Before placing tremie concrete, ensure the foundation area is level, and all forms and surfaces are free
 of mud and silt.
 Use a tremie with a smooth interior face; and watertight discharge tube at least 10 inches in diameter,
 long enough to reach the bottom of the placement, and marked in 1 foot increments. Provide a valve
 or similar device, including various types of plugs, at the lower end of the discharge tube that closes
 tightly while the tremie is being charged and lowered into position, and that can be fully opened in the
 lowered position. Attach tremie tube to a funnel or hopper of at least 1/2 cubic yard capacity to
 facilitate transfer of concrete to the tremie. Do not use tremie tubes fabricated from aluminum.
 Furnish at least two tremie tubes to ensure continuous concrete placement. Do not place tremie
 concrete by pumping directly to the bottom of placement. Place tremie concrete only in the presence
 of the Engineer.
 
 610 -6
 
 CONCRETE STRUCTURES
 
 SECTION 610
 
 Maneuver the tremie tube by using an accurately controlled crane or hoist that allows free vertical
 movement of the discharge end of the tube. Keep the concrete level in the tremie tube stable.
 Maintain the equilibrium level. Keep the discharge end of the tremie tube fully submerged in the
 freshly deposited concrete. Keep the tremie tube relatively motionless. Do not move the tremie
 laterally during concrete placement.
 Place tremie concrete in one continuous operation. Place concrete at a rate that prevents aggregate
 segregation and allows flow over the entire placement area. Keep the top surface of concrete as level
 as possible. Maintain balanced hydrostatic pressures to prevent form failure and movement of water
 through the plastic concrete.
 Proceed with dewatering only after test specimens cured under similar conditions show sufficient
 strength. Remove laitance or other unsatisfactory material by scraping, chipping, or other means that
 will not damage the surface of the concrete.
 4.
 
 Bridge Decks.
 a.
 
 Pre-Pour Meeting. Prior to any deck concreting, a "pre-pour" meeting will be held with the
 Contractor and representatives of the Department in attendance. At this time, review the approved
 Bridge Deck Placement Plan and procedures for deck construction.
 
 b.
 
 Placing Deck Concrete. Do not place concrete in bridge decks until the Engineer is satisfied that
 personnel and Equipment identified in the approved Bridge Deck Placement Plan are available to
 deliver, place, spread, finish, and cure a minimum of 20 cubic yards of concrete per hour, that
 experienced finishing machine operators and concrete finishers are employed to finish the deck,
 and that weather protective Equipment and all necessary finishing tools and Equipment are on
 hand at the site of the Work and in satisfactory condition for use. Conduct a dry run of the
 Equipment before placing concrete. Prior to placing bridge deck concrete, check all Falsework
 and make all necessary adjustments. Place concrete in accordance with the Bridge Deck
 Placement Plan and procedures discussed at the pre-pour meeting. Place particular emphasis on
 proper vibration of the concrete to avoid, tears, aggregate silhouettes, honeycomb and voids,
 especially at construction joints, expansion joints, and valleys and ends of form sheets.
 
 c.
 
 Finishing Bridge Decks. Finish bridge decks, approach slabs, and other concrete surfaces for use
 by traffic to a smooth, skid resistant surface. Provide adequate work bridges for proper
 performance of the Work, including the application of fog sprays and curing compound, and for
 inspecting the Work.
 i. Striking Off and Floating. After the concrete is placed and consolidated, finish pavement
 surfaces using approved power-driven finishing machines. Use hand finish methods when
 approved for irregular areas.
 Provide a mechanical screed of the power-actuated oscillating type. Vibrating screeds will not
 be permitted unless specifically approved by the Engineer. The screed shall be sufficiently rigid
 and easy to control in order to provide substantially uniform treatment over the deck
 surface. Provide screeds of the transverse type and of sufficient weight to strike off the surface
 at the specified grade. Do not use longitudinal type screeds without prior written approval from
 the Engineer. When the longitudinal type screed is used, the over-all length shall be such as to
 screed independently supported spans up to and including 80 feet. In no case shall the length of
 the screed be less than the full length of the span for spans less than 80 feet. When using the
 longitudinal type screed on independently supported spans exceeding 80 feet in length with a
 screed length less than the full length of the span, complete the center half of the span,
 preferably more, first and then complete the remaining portions. Place bulkheads or other
 substantial supports for the screed over the abutments and/or piers and at the terminal point of
 placements within the span. Do not use the surface of a previously placed section as a bearing
 area for the screed track until control cylinders have attained a minimum strength of 0.6 f ‘c
 where f ‘c is the design minimum laboratory compressive strength as specified in the Contract
 Documents.
 
 610 -7
 
 CONCRETE STRUCTURES
 
 SECTION 610
 
 Unless a longitudinal construction joint is approved under the construction joint plan, transverse
 screeds shall extend the full width of the deck between curbs and/or parapets. Set the screed
 and transverse construction joints parallel to the nearest support lines (abutment or pier). If the
 skew angle changes at supports, adjust the angle of the screed accordingly as the finishing
 machine progresses across the deck slab. When a transverse screed is used, provide a screed of
 sufficient size to finish the full width of the deck between curbs or parapets unless a longitudinal
 joint in the deck is specified. In this case, place the portion on either side of the joint and finish
 separately. The wheels of the screed shall bear on temporary rails which shall be adequately
 supported on and directly above the main structural members or on form supports. In case of
 continuous spans, the form supports shall be fully supported by the principal structural members
 supporting the deck. The rails shall be sufficiently rigid and strong to permit the screed to finish
 the surface of the deck within the requirements of this Section. If the rails are placed within the
 roadway area, elevate the rails a sufficient distance above the deck to permit the simultaneous
 finishing by hand of any portion not finished by the screed. Fabricate and install rail supports
 extending above the roadway surface in such a manner as to permit their removal to at least 2
 inches below the top surface of the deck slab. Any portion of the rail support to remain in the
 deck concrete shall be fusion bonded epoxy coated or other approved corrosion resistant
 material. Where rail supports are placed in that portion of the deck under the curbs or parapets,
 place the supports so that they will be at least 2 inches from the face of the curb or parapet walls
 or outside edge of the slab.
 Ensure that supports for screeds or finishing are completely in place and firmly secured before
 placement of concrete will be permitted. Set supports to elevations necessary to obtain a bridge
 deck true to the required grade and cross-section, with allowance being made for anticipated
 settlement. Provide supports of a type and so installed that no springing or deflection will occur
 under the weight of the finishing Equipment, and so located that finishing Equipment may
 operate without interruption over the entire bridge deck being furnished.
 On continuous steel beam or girder spans, cast the deck in the order as shown in the Contract
 Documents. On simple spans, and for any section between construction joints for continuous
 spans, the concrete may be placed by beginning at the end and working along the roadway or by
 beginning at the side and working across the roadway. During the screeding operation, keep an
 adequate supply of concrete ahead of the screed and maintain a slight excess immediately in
 front of the screed. Use only a work bridge or other suitable platform to perform screeding,
 finishing, and curing operations without delay. Support the work bridge or platform outside the
 limits of the concreting. Where the concrete in the deck of a continuous beam or girder span
 group cannot be placed in one operation, locate construction joints and place the deck in
 accordance with an approved placement schedule. After the initial placement has been made in
 any one group of a continuous span, do not make any placement until all previously placed
 concrete in the deck of that group has been in place until the cylinder strength is at least 0.5 f ‘c.
 After striking off the concrete, finish the surface with a float, roller, or other approved device to
 remove local irregularities and to leave sufficient mortar at the surface of the concrete for
 subsequent texturing. Finish the surface without adding water.
 ii. Straightedging. Check the surface with a 10 foot metal straightedge placed parallel to the
 centerline of the bridge, or a California-type profilograph. Overlap the straightedge one-half the
 length of the preceding pass as the checking progresses.
 iii. Surface Testing and Correction. Inspect finished deck roadway surfaces that will not be overlaid
 with a wearing surface. Mark variations in the surface that exceed 1/4 inch from a 10 foot
 straightedge. Correct marked irregularities with a concrete plane or grooving Equipment to
 produce a textured surface equal in roughness to the surrounding unground concrete without
 shattering or otherwise damaging the remaining concrete.
 iv. Texturing. Texture bridge deck, approach slab, and transition slab surfaces by first dragging a
 fabric over the final screeded concrete and then by sawing longitudinal grooves in the cured
 
 610 -8
 
 CONCRETE STRUCTURES
 
 SECTION 610
 
 concrete. After final screeding of the surface, drag multiple-ply damp fabric over the surface to
 provide a gritty texture. After the bridge deck or approach slab has been cured and attained at
 least 75 percent of f ‘c, saw uniformly pronounced grooves parallel to the centerlines without
 damaging the concrete deck surface. Complete a longitudinal grooving operation that results in
 a uniformly grooved deck surface. Saw grooves approximately 1/8 inch + 0 inch, - 1/16 inch
 wide, 3/16 inch ± 1/16 inch deep, and on 3/4 inch ± 1/16 inch (nominal) centers. Terminate
 grooves 18 inches ± 1 inch from the face of the parapet or curb line. If metal drainage inlets
 extend more than 18 inches from the parapet or curb line, all grooves on the bridge deck surface
 are to end within 6 inches of the drainage inlet perimeter. At skewed metal edged expansion
 joints, end all grooves within 6 inches of the joint leaving no ungrooved surface adjacent to each
 side of the joint greater than 6 inches in width on the deck side of the expansion joints. Produce
 grooves that are continuous across construction joints or other joints in the concrete deck
 surface less than 1/2 inch wide.
 v. Perform continuous removal of all waste materials, including slurry, resulting from the grooving
 operations in accordance with Sections 106.08 and 104.14, leaving all surfaces in a washed and
 clean condition.
 5.
 
 Chamfers. Provide 3/4 inch chamfers at all exposed edges unless specified otherwise on the Plans.
 
 6.
 
 Subfoundation Concrete.
 Subfoundation concrete does not require reinforcement and need not be vibrated. Use Class C concrete for
 subfoundation concrete.
 
 F.
 
 Slip-Forming Bridge Barrier. Do not slip form bridge barrier unless allowed by Special Provisions
 included in the Contract Documents.
 
 G. Joints.
 1.
 
 Construction Joints. Place construction joints only at locations shown in the Contract Documents, in
 accordance with the Construction Joint Plan.
 Construct 2 inch x 4 inch keyed construction shear keys at vertical joints and at horizontal joints, unless
 shown otherwise in the Plans. Rough float the horizontal construction joints to consolidate the surface.
 Leave the joint in a roughened condition. Form depressions for shear keys covering approximately one
 third of the contact surface. Bevel the forms for keys so that removal will not damage the concrete.
 Clean construction joints of surface laitance, curing compound, and other foreign materials before
 placing fresh concrete against the surface of the joint. Use abrasive blast or other approved methods to
 clean horizontal construction joints to expose clean aggregate. Flush construction joints with water and
 allow to dry to a saturated surface dry condition immediately before placing concrete.
 Insert an approved continuous waterstop where specified in the Contract Documents. Place the
 waterstop not less than 3 inches from the face of the concrete. Extend the waterstop into each section
 of the concrete a distance of not less than 2 inches or as specified in the Contract Documents.
 Bond new concrete to existing clean concrete Structures with epoxy bonding compound at locations
 identified in the Construction Joint Plan. Apply epoxy bonding compound in accordance with
 manufacturer recommendations.
 Form the face edges of all joints exposed to view with straight bulkheads or grade strips, and finish true
 to line and elevation. All exposed construction joint edges shall have a 3/4 inch v-notch. Construct all
 construction joints so that feather edging does not occur.
 
 2.
 
 Expansion and Contraction Joints. Construct expansion and contraction joints to include open joints,
 filled joints, keyed joints, joints sealed with sealants or waterstops, and joints with combinations of these
 features.
 Finish open joints in decks and sidewalks with an edging tool, when not protected by metal armor.
 Remove mortar and other debris from open joints.
 
 610 -9
 
 CONCRETE STRUCTURES
 
 SECTION 610
 
 Construct filled joints with preformed or premolded fillers unless polystyrene board is specified. Use a
 single piece of joint filler for each joint. Anchor joint filler Material to one side of the joint by
 waterproof adhesive to prevent it from working out of the joint; take care not to interfere with the
 compression of the Material.
 Provide waterstops as specified in the Contract Documents, and of a type allowing joint movement
 without injury to the joint Material. Splice, weld, or solder joints to be continuous and watertight.
 Prevent contamination of waterstop surfaces from oil, grease, dried mortar, or other foreign matter while
 the waterstop is being embedded in concrete. Ensure that all portions of the waterstop designed for
 embedment are tightly enclosed by dense concrete.
 H. Finishing Plastic Concrete. Strike off surfaces of concrete that are not placed against forms to the planned
 elevation or slope, and finish the surface by floating with a wooden float to seal the surface. Tool
 construction and expansion joints with an edger. Leave joint filler exposed.
 1.
 
 Surface Finishes.
 a.
 
 Pedestrian Walkway Surface Finish. Strike off and float the surface with wooden, cork or
 magnesium float. Broom the surface lightly in a transverse direction. Use an edging tool on edges
 and expansion joints. Lay out sidewalk surfaces in blocks with an approved grooving tool. Correct
 deviations of more than 1/8 inch when checked with a 5 foot straightedge.
 
 b.
 
 Brushed Finish. Brush the surface with a fine brush using parallel strokes.
 
 c.
 
 Surface Under Bearings.
 i. Finish the surface with a float finish where metallic masonry plates are to be placed directly on
 the concrete or on filler Material less than 1/8 inch thick. Grind the masonry plate contact area
 to provide full and even bearing.
 ii. Finish the concrete surface with a steel trowel when plates will be set on filler Material between
 1/8 inch and 1/2 inch thick. Provide a finished surface that varies by no more than 1/16 inch.
 Grind surfaces that fail to conform to the required flatness.
 iii. Finish with a wood float to a flat and even surface free of ridges those surfaces under
 elastomeric bearings and under metallic masonry plates that are supported on mortar or filler
 pads 1/2 inch or greater in thickness.
 
 I.
 
 Curing Concrete. Cure newly placed concrete using one or more of the methods specified below. Keep the
 surface of the concrete moist by a water fog spray applied without damaging the surface. Commence curing
 operations immediately after the free water has left the surface and finishing operations are completed.
 Cure concrete in accordance with the requirements of Table 610.03-2. Cure concrete bridge decks for 7
 uninterrupted days.
 1.
 
 Curing Methods.
 a.
 
 Forms-in-Place Method. Leave forms in place without loosening them for the cure.
 
 b.
 
 Water Method. Maintain the concrete surface in a continuously wet condition by ponding,
 spraying, or covering with Materials that are kept continuously and thoroughly wet. Use cotton
 mats, multiple layers of burlap, or other approved Materials that do not discolor or otherwise
 damage the concrete.
 
 c.
 
 Liquid Membrane Curing Compound. Use Type 2, white pigmented, liquid membranes only on the
 surfaces of bridge decks, on surfaces that will not be exposed to view in the completed Work, or on
 surfaces where their use has been approved. Apply the curing solution uniformly at the
 manufacturer’s specified application rate. Do not use liquid membrane curing compounds on
 surfaces where a rubbed finish is required or on surfaces of construction joints unless the
 membrane is removed by sandblasting before placing new concrete against the joint.
 
 610 -10
 
 CONCRETE STRUCTURES
 
 SECTION 610
 
 Seal the exposed concrete immediately after the free water has left the surface. Seal formed
 surfaces immediately after the forms are removed and the concrete finished. Apply the solution by
 power operated atomizing spray Equipment in one or two separate applications. Apply the second
 coating within 30 minutes of the first. Use hand operated sprayers for coating small areas if
 needed. Thoroughly mix membrane solutions containing pigments. Agitate mixture during
 application.
 Reapply solution, at the specified rate, to membrane film damaged during the curing period by
 weather or construction activities.
 d.
 
 Waterproof Cover Method. Provide a cover of waterproof sheet material to prevent moisture loss
 from the concrete. Use this method only when the covering can be secured to prevent moisture
 loss.
 Install the cover when the concrete is wet. Use sheets of the widest practical width, overlap sheets
 a minimum of 6 inches, and seal tightly with pressure sensitive tape, mastic, glue, or other
 approved methods to form a waterproof cover over the entire concrete surface. Secure the
 waterproof sheet material to prevent displacement by wind. Immediately repair sheets torn or
 damaged during the curing period.
 
 e.
 J.
 
 Curing Bridge Decks. Cure concrete bridge decks in accordance with Section 610.03.I.1.b. for a
 curing period of at least 7 days after placing concrete.
 
 Mass Concrete.
 1.
 
 Temperature Control.
 The maximum temperature shall not exceed 160 degrees Fahrenheit during curing. During curing, the
 maximum differential temperatures shall not exceed:

 First 24 hours
 
 30º F
 
 24 to 48 hours
 
 40º F
 
 2 to 7 days
 
 50º F
 
 7 to 14 days
 
 60º F
 
 Monitoring Devices. Provide temperature monitoring devices to record temperature development
 between the interior and the exterior of the element at points approved by the Engineer. Monitor a
 minimum of two independent sets of interior and exterior points for each element to provide
 redundancy in case of failure of a device. Locate the monitoring points at the geometric center of the
 element for the interior point and 2 inches from the surface along the shortest line from the geometric
 center to the nearest surface of the element for the exterior point.
 Monitoring devices shall be automatic sensing and recording instruments that record information at a
 maximum interval of 15 minutes. These devices shall operate for a maximum range of 0 to 200
 degrees Fahrenheit with an accuracy of ± 2 degrees Fahrenheit. The readings will begin when the
 mass concrete placement is complete and continue until the maximum temperature differential is
 reached and a decreasing temperature differential is confirmed as defined in the temperature control
 plan. Do not remove the temperature control mechanisms until the core temperature is within 25
 degrees Fahrenheit of the ambient temperature. Transmit these readings to the Engineer daily or upon
 request.
 The Specialty Engineer, or a person designated by the Specialty Engineer, must personally inspect and
 approve the installation of monitoring devices and verify that the process for recording temperature
 readings is effective for the first placement of each size and type mass component. Submit to the
 Engineer for approval the qualification of all technicians employed to inspect or monitor mass concrete
 placements. Designate an employee(s) approved by the Specialty Engineer, as qualified to inspect
 monitoring device installation, to record temperature readings, to be in contact at all times with the
 Specialty Engineer if adjustments must be made as a result of the temperature differential or the
 
 610 -11
 
 CONCRETE STRUCTURES
 
 SECTION 610
 
 maximum allowable temperature being exceeded, and to immediately implement adjustments to
 temperature control measures as directed by the Specialty Engineer. Provide determined temperature
 differentials, the summary sheet from the data logger, which includes the maximum temperature, the
 maximum temperature differential and a final report within three Days of completion of monitoring of
 each element.
 3.
 
 Construction. Take measures to control differential and absolute temperatures by appropriate use of
 insulated forms, curing blankets or internal cooling, in accordance with the Temperature Control Plan.
 If either the differential temperature or the maximum allowable temperature is exceeded, the Specialty
 Engineer shall be available for immediate consultation. If the differential temperature or the maximum
 allowable temperature has been exceeded, take immediate action as directed by the Specialty Engineer
 to retard further growth of the temperature differential. Describe methods of preventing thermal shock
 in the temperature control plan. Use a Specialty Engineer to revise the previously accepted plan to
 ensure compliance on future placements. Obtain the Engineer's approval of revisions to the approved
 plan prior to implementation. Do not place any mass concrete until the Engineer has accepted the mass
 concrete plan(s). When mass concrete temperature differentials or maximum allowable temperature
 has been exceeded, provide all analyses and test results deemed necessary by the Engineer for
 determining the structural integrity and durability of the mass concrete element, to the satisfaction of
 the Engineer. The Department will make no compensation, either monetary or time, for the analyses
 or tests or any impacts upon the project.
 Repair any cracking or damage due to exceeding maximum temperature and/or temperature differential
 to the satisfaction of the Engineer at no cost to the Department.

 The minimum required strength of concrete listed in Table 610.03-2 shall be used as a guide when and
 where field operations are controlled by the cylinder strength and approved by the Engineer. If the
 Contractor intends to begin removing forms as soon as the concrete has reached the minimum required
 strength of Table 610.03-2, the Contractor shall give the Engineer written notice, 48 hours prior to pouring
 the concrete, that the start of form removal will depend on the cylinder strength requirements.
 Cylinders cast for the specific use as cylinder strength testing for form removal shall be cured in the field
 under the same conditions as the concrete they represent. It shall also be the responsibility of the
 Contractor to ensure that the seven- and 28-day cylinders are cured for the first 24 to 48 hours in an
 environment to provide satisfactory moisture and temperature control as per AASHTO T 23. The
 contractor may supply sure-cure molds in lieu of match curing specimens.
 Department personnel will test the cylinders to determine concrete strength at the time the Contractor
 wishes to remove forms or place loads on the concrete.
 Remove all forms whether above or below the ground line or water level.
 Do not use methods of form removal likely to cause overstressing of the concrete. Do not remove forms
 and their supports without the approval of the Engineer.
 Remove supports in such a manner as to permit the concrete to take, uniformly and gradually, the stress due
 to its own weight.
 Forms for footings constructed within cofferdams or cribs may be left in place, when, in the opinion of the
 Engineer, their removal would endanger the safety of the cofferdam or crib, and when the forms so left
 intact will not be exposed to view in the finished Structure.
 The interior forms supporting the roadway slab of box girder type Structures shall be supported on wales or
 similar supports fastened, as nearly as possible, to the top of side walls, and may be left in place. The
 interior forms supporting the roadway slab shall not be shored to or supported on the box girders bottom
 slab.

 As soon as forms are removed, remove all form ties used for holding the forms in place and fill the holes,
 depressions, or small voids thus made which show upon the removal of the forms with cement mortar
 mixed in the same proportions as that which was used in the body of the Work.
 Plan and execute the Work so that form removal and specified finishing is performed within the required
 limits. Otherwise, subsequent placement of concrete in other parts of the Structure or Structures shall be
 ordered stopped.
 Place concrete which is to be exposed to sea water or tidal brackish water in the dry unless otherwise
 approved. Sea water or brackish water shall not come in direct contact with concrete prior to the times
 indicated in Table 610.03-3 unless otherwise approved.

 L. Finishing Formed Concrete Surfaces. Unless otherwise specified in the Contract Documents, provide a
 Class 1 - Ordinary Surface Finish unless after form removal the formed concrete surfaces are in such a
 condition that they cannot be repaired to the satisfaction of the Engineer. In these cases, the entire
 structural unit shall be given a Class 2 - Rubbed Finish. Provide finished surfaces as follows:
 1.
 
 Class 1—Ordinary Surface Finish. Finish formed concrete surfaces with a Class 1, ordinary surface
 finish upon removal of forms. Immediately remove fins and irregular projections from surfaces that are
 to be exposed or waterproofed. Remove surface bulges or offsets with Carborundum stones or discs.
 Remove and replace localized poorly bonded rock pockets or honey combed concrete with sound
 concrete or packed mortar.
 Removal or replacement of portions or all of the Structure may be required if the rock pockets are
 extensive enough to materially affect the strength of the Structure or reduce the life of the
 reinforcement.
 Clean and saturate with water all cavities produced by form ties and all other holes, broken corners or
 edges, and other defects, and then point and true with mortar. For exposed surfaces, add white cement
 to the mortar to achieve a patch that, when dry, matches the surrounding concrete and is true and
 uniform. Use mortar in pointing that is less than 1 hour old. Rub the concrete if required or continue
 curing. Tool and leave construction and expansion joints free of mortar and concrete. Leave the joint
 filler exposed for its full length with clean and true edges.
 
 2.
 
 Class 2—Rubbed Finish. Finish exposed surfaces with a Class 2, rubbed finish, except the soffits and
 the interior faces, and bottoms of concrete girders. Rub concrete as soon as its condition will allow.
 Allow mortar used in pointing and patching to set before finishing. Rub surfaces with a medium-coarse
 Carborundum stone, using a small amount of mortar on its face. Mix the mortar using the same
 proportions of cement and fine sand used in the concrete being finished. Continue rubbing until form
 marks, projections, and irregularities have been removed, voids have been filled, and a uniform surface
 has been obtained. Leave the paste produced by this rubbing in place. Produce the final finish by
 rubbing with a fine Carborundum stone and water. Continue rubbing until the entire surface is of a
 smooth texture and uniform color. Rub the completed surface with burlap to remove loose powder and
 leave the surface free from unsound patches, paste, powder, and objectionable marks.
 
 610 -14
 
 CONCRETE STRUCTURES
 
 SECTION 610
 
 Use a Class 1 finish for metal forms, fiber forms, lined forms, or plywood forms in good condition, and
 when the Class 1 finish is equal to that which could be attained with the application of a Class 2,
 Rubbed Finish. Grind with powered disc or sandblast with fine sand to achieve a Class 1 finish when
 approved.
 3.
 
 Class 3—Tooled Finish. Provide a Class 3, tooled finish, when specified. Finish panels and other
 similar Work with a bushhammer, pick, or crandall. Conduct Work only after 14 Days or when
 aggregate cannot be picked out of the surface. Provide a tooled finish surface that shows a grouping of
 broken aggregate particles in a matrix of mortar, each aggregate particle being in slight relief.
 
 4.
 
 Class 4—Sandblasted Finish. Provide a Class 4, sandblasted finish, when specified. Sandblast the
 cured concrete surface with hard, sharp sand to produce an even, fine- grained surface in which the
 mortar has been cut away, leaving the aggregate exposed.
 
 5.
 
 Class 5—Wire Brushed or Scrubbed Finish. Provide a Class 5, wire brushed or scrubbed finish, when
 specified. Scrub the green concrete surface with stiff wire or fiber brushes. Use a muriatic acid
 solution of 1 part acid to 4 parts water by volume. Remove the cement film or surface, and expose the
 aggregate particles. Leave an even pebbled texture presenting an appearance ranging from fine granite
 to coarse conglomerate, depending upon the size and grading of aggregate used. Wash the surface with
 water mixed with a small amount of ammonia to remove all traces of acid.
 
 M. Defective Work. Remove and replace any defective Work discovered after the forms have been removed,
 except as noted below. If the surface of the concrete is bulged or uneven, or shows honeycombing that
 cannot be repaired satisfactorily, the entire section shall be removed and replaced.
 1.
 
 Concrete Strength. Concrete which fails to reach full 28-day design strength (f ‘c) will be considered
 defective concrete. The Contractor may challenge a concrete test result which fails to reach full 28-day
 design strength (f ‘c) by obtaining cores from the represented Work. Challenge cores must be taken
 within 5 Working Days of notification by the Department. Cores must be a minimum of 4 inch
 diameter by 4 inch depth. A minimum of 2 satisfactory cores must be obtained for testing at the
 central lab. Cut the cores from a location approved by the Engineer. Cores will be immediately
 handed to a representative of the Department and returned to the Department for testing. The
 Contractor is entitled to accompany the cores to the central lab and witness all testing.
 If the difference in strength between the challenge cores is greater than 501 pounds per square inch, the
 core testing result will be considered void and the prorated payment as specified below and corrective
 action in accordance with Table 610.03-4 will be applied to the concrete in question based upon the fieldcast cylinders. Valid compressive strength results of challenge cores will supersede field cylinder results.
 All decisions regarding structural adequacy, corrective action in accordance with Table 610.03-4, and
 prorated payment will be based upon results of challenge core results. Structurally inadequate Work must
 be removed and replaced or reinforced to the satisfaction of the Engineer at no additional cost. Any result
 determined by the Engineer to be structurally adequate to remain in place may be processed for corrective
 action and prorated payment in accordance with Table 610.03-4.

 Disposition of Cracked Concrete. The disposition of cracked concrete applies to all cast-in-place
 concrete members, and once installed, to the precast concrete members that are produced in accordance
 with Section 612.
 a.
 
 Investigation, Documentation and Monitoring. The Engineer will inspect concrete surfaces as
 soon as surfaces are fully visible after casting, with the exception of surfaces of precast concrete
 products produced in offsite plants, between 7 and 31 days after the component has been burdened
 with full dead load, and a minimum of 7 days after the bridge has been opened to full unrestricted
 traffic. The Engineer will measure the width, length and depth of each crack and establish the
 precise location of the crack termination points relative to permanent reference points on the
 member. The Engineer will determine if coring of the concrete is necessary when an accurate
 measurement of crack depth cannot be determined by use of a mechanical probe. The Engineer
 will monitor and document the growth of individual cracks at an inspection interval determined by
 the Engineer to determine if cracks are active or dormant after initial inspection. The Engineer
 will perform all final bridge deck crack measurements once the deck is free of all debris and
 before longitudinal grooves are cut and after planing is complete for decks that require planing.
 Provide the access, Equipment and personnel needed for the Engineer to safely perform this Work
 at no expense to the Department. Core cracks for use by the Engineer in locations and to depths
 specified by the Engineer at no expense to the Department.
 
 b.
 
 Classification of Cracks. The Engineer will classify cracks as either nonstructural or structural.
 Review and comment on the Engineer’s crack classification; however, the Engineer will make the
 final determination.
 
 c.
 
 Repair Method. Repair or remove and replace cracked concrete as directed by the Engineer.
 Additional compensation or a time extension will not be approved for repair or removal and
 replacement of cracked concrete when the Engineer determines the cause to be the responsibility
 of the Contractor.
 i. Nonstructural Cracks. Perform all crack repairs in accordance with Sections 613 and 628 of the
 Standard Specifications.
 ii. Structural Cracks. Provide a structural evaluation signed and sealed by the Contractor’s
 Engineer of Record that includes recommended repair methods and a determination of structural

 611.02 Materials. Provide Materials as specified in:
 Concrete Reinforcement
 
 Section 1037
 
 611.03 Construction.
 
 A. Shop Drawings. Submit Working Drawings in accordance with Section 105.04. Submit detailed bar lists,
 bending diagrams and type of bar for all bar reinforcement to be furnished. Check all bar lists and details
 shown in the Contract Documents for accuracy of the quantity, size, length, and dimensions before ordering
 bars. Bar lists may be prepared on sheets of a size and type that are the supplier’s standard.
 
 B. Storage. Store reinforcement bars off the ground on platforms, skids, or other supports, and protect the
 reinforcement bars from mechanical injury and surface deterioration caused by exposure to conditions
 producing rust. Keep reinforcement bars free from frost, dirt, oil, grease, paint, mortar, loose rust, mill
 scale, and other materials that would reduce bond. Provide additional protection for specified Materials as
 follows:
 1.
 
 Epoxy-Coated Reinforcing Bars. Handle and store epoxy-coated reinforcement bars by methods that
 will not damage the epoxy coating. Furnish all systems for handling epoxy-coated reinforcement bars
 with adequately padded contact areas if possible. Pad all bundling bands and lift all bundles with a
 strong-back, multiple supports, or platform bridge to prevent bar-to-bar abrasion from sags in the bar
 bundle. Do not drop or drag bars or bundles. Transport and store epoxy-coated reinforcement bars on
 wooden or padded supports.
 Where possible, do not store epoxy-coated reinforcement bars at the jobsite for more than 2 months. If
 field storage on site is expected to exceed 2 months, cover the epoxy-coated reinforcement bars or
 bundles with opaque polyethylene or other protective Material. Provide ventilation to prevent
 condensation from forming under the covering.
 
 2.
 
 Galvanized Reinforcing Bars. Where possible, do not store galvanized reinforcement bars at the jobsite
 for more than 30 days. If field storage is expected to exceed 30 days, cover bars with opaque
 polyethylene or other protective Material. Do not place galvanized reinforcement bars in contact with
 uncoated reinforcement bars or other uncoated steel or stainless steel.
 
 3.
 
 Stainless Reinforcing Bars. Do not band strap, or allow direct contact of stainless steel reinforcing bars
 to non-stainless steel reinforcement bars or other dissimilar metals. Do not store non-stainless steel
 reinforcement bars or other dissimilar metals above stainless steel reinforcement bars unless adequate
 protection has been provided to prevent contamination.
 
 4.
 
 Zinc and Epoxy Dual-Coated Reinforcing Bars. Store in accordance with ASTM A1055.
 
 C. Bending, Splicing, and Cutting. Fabricate reinforcing bars as prescribed in the CRSI Manual of Standard
 Practice. Bend the reinforcement cold to the shapes indicated in the Contract Documents. Perform bending
 in the shop before shipment and not in the field unless shown otherwise in the Contract Documents. Do not
 hot-bend or straighten, weld, or thermal-cut reinforcing steel unless otherwise specified in the Contract
 Documents.
 
 D. Repair of Coating.
 1.
 
 Epoxy-Coated Reinforcing Bars. Store, handle, and place epoxy-coated reinforcement bars at the
 jobsite according to ASTM D3963. Inspect the bars before placement. If the epoxy coating is damaged
 and the damages do not exceed 2 percent of the surface area in any 1 foot section of the epoxy-coated
 reinforcement bars, repair all visible damage according to ASTM D3963 before bar placement.
 Replace epoxy-coated reinforcement bars if damage to the surface area exceeds 2 percent in any 1 foot
 
 611 - 1
 
 CONCRETE REINFORCEMENT
 
 SECTION 611
 
 section. After placement, inspect the epoxy-coated reinforcement bars again and repair areas damaged
 during placement.
 2.
 
 Galvanized Reinforcing Bars. After placement, inspect the galvanized reinforcing bars and repair areas
 damaged during placement in accordance with ASTM A780.
 
 3.
 
 Zinc and Epoxy Dual-Coated Reinforcing Bars. After placement, inspect the dual-coated reinforcing
 bars and repair areas damaged during placement in accordance with ASTM A1055.
 
 E. Placing and Fastening.
 1.
 
 General. Accurately place reinforcement bars as indicated and hold it firmly in position during the
 placing and settling of concrete using metal chairs or acceptable supports. Do not allow bar spacing to
 vary from the design spacing by more than 1/2 inch. Do not allow the distance from the surface of the
 formwork to the bars to vary more than 1/4 inch from the design distance. Do not place reinforcement
 bars closer than 1.5 times the maximum nominal size of the aggregate used in the concrete mix design.
 Firmly tie bars with annealed iron wire or secure the bars with acceptable metal clips. Tie bars at all
 intersections around the perimeter of each mat, and not less than 2 feet centers or at every intersection,
 whichever is greater. When all intersections are not tied, tie alternate intersections in each direction to
 provide a staggered tie layout. Tie bundled bars together at not more than 6-feet centers. Do not bundle
 more than 2 bars unless noted otherwise in the Contract Documents. When reinforcement bars are tied
 together and lifted into place as a unit, ensure stability of the unit and maintain proper bar alignment
 during lifting and placement operations.
 Provide additional protection for ties for specified Materials as follows:
 
 2.
 
 a.
 
 Epoxy-Coated, Galvanized, or Dual-Coated Reinforcing Bars. For epoxy-coated, galvanized, or
 dual-coated reinforcing bars, provide plastic-coated tie wire, epoxy-coated tie wire, metal clips, or
 plastic clips.
 
 b.
 
 Stainless Reinforcing Bars. When tying stainless steel reinforcement bars together, provide
 plastic, plastic-coated, or stainless steel tie wire in conformance with the requirements of ASTM
 A493, Type 316 (UNS number S31600). When attaching stainless steel reinforcement bars to
 non-stainless steel reinforcement bars or any other dissimilar metals, provide 1/8 inch thick
 (minimum) nylon, polyvinylchloride, or polyethylene spacers or sheathing to ensure non-contact
 between the reinforcement bars a minimum of 1 inch extending beyond the point of intersection in
 all directions. Provide nylon or plastic-coated wire ties to bind the spacers and/or reinforcement.
 
 Support Systems. Support reinforcement bars in their proper position by use of mortar blocks, wire bar
 supports, supplementary bars, or other devices. Supply such devices of proper height and at
 sufficiently frequent intervals to maintain the distance between the reinforcement bars and the formed
 surface or the top surface of deck slabs within 1/4 inch of that indicated.
 Support platforms, which are supporting personnel and Equipment during concrete placement, directly
 on the forms and not on the reinforcement bars.
 a.
 
 Mortar Block Supports. Furnish mortar blocks of the same class as the concrete in which they are
 to be embedded. Ensure that block faces in contact with forms for exposed surfaces do not exceed
 2 inches by 2 inches in size, and that their color and texture will match the concrete surface. If
 used on vertical or sloping surfaces, provide such blocks with an embedded wire for securing the
 block to the reinforcement bars. If used in slabs, use either a tie wire or, if the gravitational force
 of the reinforcement bars is sufficient to firmly hold the blocks in place, a groove in the top of the
 block. For epoxy-coated reinforcement bars or galvanized reinforcement bars, use plastic-coated
 or epoxy-coated tie wires.
 
 b.
 
 Wire Supports. Furnish wire bar supports, such as ferrous metal chairs and bolsters, conforming to
 industry practice as described in the Manual of Standard Practice of the Concrete Reinforcing
 Steel Institute. Ensure that chairs or bolsters that bear against the forms for exposed surfaces are
 
 611 - 2
 
 CONCRETE REINFORCEMENT
 
 SECTION 611
 
 either Class 1 - Maximum Protection (Plastic Protected) or Class 2, Type B - Moderate Protection
 (Stainless Steel Tipped) for which the stainless steel conforms to ASTM A493, Type 430. For
 epoxy-coated reinforcement bars or galvanized reinforcement bars, provide plastic-coated, epoxycoated, or galvanized wire bar supports and bar clips. For stainless steel reinforcement bars,
 provide plastic supports meeting Section 611.03.E.2.c. or stainless steel bar supports in
 conformance with the requirements of ASTM A493, Type 316 (UNS number S31600). Use
 stainless steel supports with plastic-coated feet above steel beams or metal stay-in-place forms.
 c.
 
 3.
 
 Plastic Supports. Use chairs and bolsters that do not deflect more than 1/4 inch under a minimum
 point load of 350 pounds of force. Use supports molded in a configuration that does not restrict
 concrete flow.
 
 Splicing and Lapping. Furnish all reinforcement in the full lengths, as indicated, unless otherwise
 approved by the Engineer.
 Do not splice bars, except as indicated or directed. If splicing is allowed, lap the reinforcement bars as
 shown in the Contract Documents and as indicated, and wire together securely. Do not substitute
 alternate bars unless approved by the Engineer. Stagger splices as far as possible.
 In lapped splices, place and wire the bars maintaining the minimum distance to the surface of the
 concrete as indicated. Do not use lapped splices for Nos. 14 and 18 bars, except as provided in the
 AASHTO LRFD Bridge Specifications.
 As indicated in the Contract Documents, use welded splices or mechanical splice systems. Stagger
 welded splices or mechanical splice system connections if possible.
 a.
 
 Welded Splices. For welded splices, use butt splices only. Only use welded splices if indicated in
 the Contract Documents or if the Engineer gives written authorization to do so. Ensure that
 welding conforms to the Structural Welding Code, Reinforcing Steel, AWS D1.4 of the American
 Welding Society and applicable special provisions. Do not use welded splices on epoxy-coated
 reinforcement bars or galvanized reinforcement bars. Do not weld close enough to epoxy-coated
 reinforcement bars to cause any heating of the coating.
 
 b.
 
 Mechanical Splice Systems. Assemble mechanical splice systems according to the manufacturer’s
 recommendations. Mark reinforcing bars with scribe marks or indelible ink before splice
 attachment to ensure equal embedment.
 If mechanical splice systems are used, construct sample and actual splices in the presence of the
 Engineer. The Engineer will select, for each size of reinforcement bar used, three splices, either
 sample or actual, to be tested for verification of physical properties. Submit verification samples to
 the Department within 7 days of placement. Do not encase mechanical splices in concrete until
 visual examination and required testing have been completed and approved. Mechanical splices
 must be capable of resisting 125 percent of the specified yield strength of the bars being spliced.
 i. Epoxy-Coated Mechanical Splice System. Use an epoxy-coated mechanical splice system to
 splice epoxy-coated reinforcement bars. Paint the entire splice area with compatible epoxy paint
 after the system is assembled.
 ii. Galvanized Mechanical Splice System. Use a galvanized mechanical splice system to splice
 galvanized reinforcement bars. Galvanize mechanical splice system in accordance with ASTM
 B695 Class 50, Type II with a minimum thickness of 2 mils or 1.2 ounces per square foot.
 Chromate in accordance with ASTM A767, Section 4.3.
 iii. Stainless Mechanical Splice System. Use a stainless steel mechanical splice system to splice
 stainless steel reinforcement bars meeting the UNS designation listed in Section 611.03.E.1.b.
 for stainless steel reinforcement bars.
 iv. Splicing of Welded Wire Fabric. Splice sheets of welded wire fabric by overlapping each other
 sufficiently to maintain a uniform strength and by securely fastening at the ends and edges.
 Ensure that the edge lap is at least one mesh in width plus 2 in.

 h.
 
 Pre-tensioning
 i. Bring all cables or strands to be pre-stressed in a group to a uniform initial tension of
 approximately 500 pounds per strand prior to being given their full pre-tensioning. Measure the
 stress using a dynamometer or other approved means so that the initial tension can be used as a
 check against elongations computed and measured. After this initial tensioning, stress the group
 of strands until the required elongation and jacking pressure is attained. Measure the stress
 induced in the cables or strands by jacking gages and by elongations of the cables or strands.
 The calculated stress based on the elongation should closely match the gage reading.
 ii. Equip all jacks with accurate and calibrated gages for registering jacking pressures. Provide
 means for measuring the elongation of the pre-stressing strands to at least the nearest 1/32 inch.
 Furnish to the Engineer satisfactory, accredited proof that all jacking Equipment and gages to be
 used in the manufacture of the pre-stressed members have been calibrated by a reputable testing
 laboratory. The interpretations and analysis of the elongations and jacking pressures must
 consider and allow for all possible slippage or relaxation of the anchorage.
 iii. If there is a discrepancy of as much as 10 percent between the stresses determined by the
 jacking pressure and the elongation measurement, carefully check the entire operation and
 determine the source of error before proceeding.
 iv. After the cables or strands are stressed in accordance with the plan requirements and this
 Section and all other reinforcing is in place, place the concrete in the form. Only place concrete
 the temperature is between 50 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Maintain cable or strand stresses
 between anchorages until the concrete has reached a minimum compressive strength of 80
 percent of the 28-day compressive strength and the process of transferring the pre-stress to the
 member has begun.
 v. Immediately after the concrete attains initial set in accordance with AASHTO T197 steam cure
 members under a suitable enclosure to contain the live steam and minimize moisture and heat
 loss. The steam shall be at 100% relative humidity and cannot be discharged directly on the
 concrete or form. The temperature within the enclosure must increase at a rate no exceeding 40
 degrees Fahrenheit per hour until a maximum temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit to 160
 degrees Fahrenheit is reached. The maximum temperature must be maintained until the
 concrete has reached the specified release strength. After release strength is attained the
 temperature within the enclosure shall be gradually decreased at a rate not to exceed 40 degrees
 F per hour, until the temperature is no more than 30 degrees F above the ambient temperature.
 Curing temperatures must be recorded throughout the process.
 vi. De-tension immediately following the curing period while the concrete is still warm and moist.
 Do not allow the concrete to dry and/or cool prior to de-tensioning. In all de-tensioning
 operations, keep the pre-stressing forces nearly symmetrical about the vertical axis of the
 member. De-tension in a manner that will minimize sudden or shock loading and limit the
 maximum eccentricity about the vertical axis to one strand. Remove or loosen forms, ties,
 
 612 - 5
 
 PRECAST CONCRETE
 
 SECTION 612
 
 inserts, hold-downs, or other devices that would restrict longitudinal movement of the members
 along the bed during de-tensioning.
 i.
 
 After completing the release of the pre-stresses, cut the strands flush with the ends of the member and
 paint with either an approved bitumastic compound or waterproofing compound.
 
 j.
 
 Provide a heavy-scored finish on top of beams that will have a cast-in-place concrete deck
 constructed. Provide a smooth finish on top of beams to have a membrane and hot mix or warm mix
 riding surface applied.
 
 k.
 
 Apply a clear water-miscible, penetrating, alkyl epoxy silane sealer to the bottom and sides of the
 finished beams.
 
 l.
 
 Prestressed members may be handled immediately after curing and de-tensioning of the strands or
 cables. Do not ship members until at least the minimum 28-day compressive strength has been
 attained but in no case less than three days after the placing of concrete in the forms. Handle members
 using the pick-up points provided especially for this purpose. Maintain the members in a horizontal
 position (as when formed on the casting bed) at all times during handling, moving, storing, and
 shipping.
 
 m. Permissible tolerances will be in accordance with those recommended by PCI.

 Maintenance of Traffic Plans. Ensure the drawings completely detail all anticipated phases and
 conditions during erection. Furnish calculations showing that factored resistances are not exceeded and
 that member capacities and final geometry will be correct. Provide method of verification for the
 proper alignment and camber of the Structure.
 
 C. Fabrication:
 1.
 
 Identifying Steel During Fabrication. Use a system of assembly, marking individual pieces and
 providing cutting instructions to the shop that maintains the identity of the original piece.
 The Contractor may furnish Material taken from stock that is identifiable by heat number and mill test
 reports, with the Engineer’s approval.
 During fabrication, up to the point of assembling members, ensure that each member, excluding those
 of Grade 36 steel, clearly displays its Specification. Acceptable markings include writing the grade on
 each piece or using the identification color code specified in Table 615.03-1.

 For metals other than Grade 36 steel that are not included in either Table 615.03-1. or in ASTM A6,
 provide information on the color code used.
 Ensure steel pieces are grade-marked by low-stress-type steel die-stamping or by a firmly attached tag.
 Exclude Grade 36 steel from this requirement because it is subject to blast-cleaning, galvanizing,
 heating for forming, or painting that might obliterate the color-code markings before assembling into
 members.
 Furnish an affidavit certifying the steel identification was maintained throughout fabrication, if
 requested.
 2.
 
 Storing Materials. Store structural steel, plain or fabricated, above the ground on platforms, skids, or
 other supports. Keep steel free from dirt, grease, and other foreign matter, and protect it from
 corrosion. Store high-strength fasteners as specified in Section 615.03.D.6.c.i.
 
 3.
 
 Plates:
 a.
 
 Direction of Rolling. Cut and fabricate steel plates for main members, and splice plates for flanges
 and main tension members, so the primary direction of rolling is parallel to the main tensile and/or
 compressive stresses.
 
 b.
 
 Plate-Cut Edges. Plane, mill, grind, or thermal-cut to a depth of 1/4 inch the sheared edges of
 plates more than 5/8 inch thick that carry calculated stress.
 i. Oxygen Cutting. For oxygen cutting, meet AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code.
 ii. Visual Inspection and Repair of Plate-Cut Edges. For visual inspection and repair of plate-cut
 edges, meet AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code.
 
 c.
 
 Bent Plates. Take plates to be bent from the stock plates to ensure the bend line is at right angles
 to the direction of rolling. Cold-bent ribs for orthotropic deck bridges may be bent with the bend
 lines in the direction of rolling only with prior approval. Before bending, round the plate corners
 to a 1/16 inch radius where the bend will be placed.
 i. Cold Bending. Cold bend steel without cracking the plate. Use the minimum bend radii
 specified in Table 615.03-2., measured to the concave face of the metal.

 ii. Hot Bending. Hot-bend radii smaller than the minimum specified for cold-bending with the
 plates at a temperature less than 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit, excluding AASHTO M 270, Grades
 70W, 100, and 100W steel. Re-quench and temper Grades 100 and 100W steel when the steel
 to be bent is to be heated higher than 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit.
 4.
 
 Fit of Stiffeners. Mill or grind end-bearing stiffener for girders and stiffeners supporting concentrated
 loads to bear (either milled, ground, or on weldable steel in compression areas of flanges, welded as
 
 615 - 4
 
 STEEL STRUCTURES
 
 SECTION 615
 
 specified) at the flange. Ensure intermediate stiffeners that do not support concentrated loads fit tightly
 against the compression flange.
 5.
 
 Abutting Joints. Mill or saw cut abutting ends in compression members of trusses and columns to
 provide a square joint and uniform bearing. The maximum opening in unfaced joints is 3/8 inch.
 
 6.
 
 Facing Bearing Surfaces. Ensure the surface finish for bearing, base plates, and other bearing surfaces
 that contact each other or concrete meet ASME B46.1, as specified in Table 615.03-3.

 Tolerances. Provide dimensional tolerances as follows:
 i. Rolled shapes, plates, bars, wide-flange sections, and miscellaneous steel in accordance with
 ASTM A6;
 ii. Fabricate girders in accordance with the AASHTO/AWS D1.5, Bridge Welding Code and as
 described below;
 iii. Tolerances for camber and sweep of continuous and simply supported girders of any shape shall
 be as described in the AASHTO/AWS D1.5, Bridge Welding Code. The camber and sweep
 tolerances for steel pier caps shall be the same as those specified for girders. Measure sweep for
 horizontally curved members from the theoretical centerline for comparison to the
 aforementioned requirements. Allowances must be made in the shop for shrinkage due to
 welding and burning. If uneven shrinkage is anticipated, adjust camber ordinates accordingly.
 
 8.
 
 b.
 
 Alternate Sections. Rolled sections or fabricated sections of equal or slightly greater dimensions
 than the section specified may be proposed for the Engineer’s approval. Changes that reduce
 fatigue resistance or significantly affect the splice design or deflection will require complete
 design calculations.
 
 c.
 
 Web Flatness. Maximum deviation from flatness for webs of curved and/or cambered sections
 shall be the same as for straight, built-up girders. Measure curved girder web flatness using a
 straightedge oriented perpendicular to the flanges (‘vertical’, flange-to-flange).
 
 d.
 
 Girder Length. If measuring girder length with a device that is free of thermal effects,
 appropriately adjust the measurements to the reference temperature shown in the Contract
 Documents. Measure the length of horizontally curved girders along the arc.
 
 Straightening Material. Straighten plates, angles, other shapes, and built-up members without
 fracturing or damaging the metal. Use mechanical means to straighten distorted members by applying
 limited, localized heat. Perform heat-straightening of AASHTO M 270 Grades 70W, 100, and 100W
 steel members only under rigidly controlled conditions subject to approval. Do not exceed the
 temperature values specified in Table 615.03-4.

 The maximum straightening temperature for all other steels is 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit. Measure
 temperature using temperature-indicating crayons, liquids, or bimetal thermometers. The Engineer will
 reject Material heated in excess of the specified limits unless testing verifies Material integrity.
 Ensure parts to be heat-straightened are free of stress and external forces, including stresses from
 mechanical means used to apply the heat.
 All straightened pieces showing evidence of fracture will be rejected by the Engineer.
 9.
 
 Finish. Finish exposed Work. Shear, flame-cut, and chip carefully and accurately. Make sharp corners
 and round edges by grinding or other acceptable means.
 
 10. Bolt Holes for High-strength Bolts and Unfinished Bolts:
 a.
 
 Punch or drill bolt holes as follows:
 i. Either sub-drill and ream or drill full-size holes. Standard hole size is bolt diameter plus 1/16
 inch. Meet requirements of Section 615.03.C.10.g.
 ii. For members composed of not more than five thicknesses of metal, the Contractor may punch
 bolt holes full-size, provided the thickness of the Material is not greater than 3/4 inch for
 structural steel, 5/8 inch for high-strength structural steel, and 1/2 inch for quenched and
 tempered alloy steel.
 iii. When specified, sub-punch or sub-drill all holes (sub-drill if thickness limitation governs) 1/4
 inch smaller. After assembling, ream or drill to full size.
 iv. When specified, the Contractor may use enlarged or slotted holes for high-strength bolts.
 
 b.
 
 Punched Holes. For punched holes, ensure that the die diameter does not exceed the punch
 diameter by more than 1/16 inch. Ream undersized holes. Ensure holes are clean-cut, without torn
 or ragged edges.
 
 c.
 
 Reamed or Drilled Holes. Ream or drill holes perpendicular to the member to meet the above size
 requirements. Where practical, use mechanically directed reamers. Remove burrs on the outside
 surfaces. Ream and drill using twist drills, twist reamers, or rotobroach cutters. Assemble and
 securely hold connecting members while reaming or drilling holes. Match-mark before
 disassembling.
 
 d.
 
 Tolerance of Holes. Acceptable holes are those not more than 1/32 inch larger in diameter than the
 decimal equivalent of the minimal diameter resulting from the drill or reamer. Ensure the slottedhole width produced by flame-cutting or a combination of drilling or punching and flame-cutting
 is no more than 1/32 inch larger than the nominal width. Grind the flame-cut surface smooth.
 
 615 - 6
 
 STEEL STRUCTURES
 e.
 
 SECTION 615
 
 Tolerance of Hole Group:
 i. Before Reaming. Punch full-sized, sub-punched, or sub-drilled holes so that, after assembling
 (before any reaming is done), a cylindrical pin, 1/8 inch smaller in diameter than the nominal
 size of the punched hole, may be inserted into the member, without drifting, in at least 75
 percent of the contiguous holes in the same plane. The Engineer will reject pieces not meeting
 this requirement. The Engineer will also reject holes not large enough to pass a pin that is 1/4
 inch smaller than the nominal size of the punched hole.
 ii. Tolerance After Reaming. Ensure that when holes are reamed or drilled, 85 percent of the holes
 in any contiguous group show no offset greater than 1/32 inch between adjacent pieces.
 Use steel templates that have hardened steel bushings in the holes and that are accurately
 dimensioned from the connecting centerlines as inscribed on the template. Use the centerlines to
 locate the template from the milled or scribed ends of the members.
 
 f.
 
 Holes for Ribbed Bolts, Turned Bolts, or Other Approved Bearing-Type Bolts. For ribbed bolts,
 turned bolts, or other approved bearing-type bolts, sub-punch or sub-drill holes 3/16 inch smaller
 than the nominal bolt diameter. Ream when assembled, or drill using a steel template or, once
 assembled, drill from the solid to ensure the finished holes provide a driving fit.
 
 g.
 
 Preparing Field Connections. Sub-punch or sub-drill holes in all field connections and field
 splices of main truss members, arches, continuous beam spans, bents, towers (each face), plate
 girders, and rigid frames. Ream holes with Material assembled or drill full-size through a steel
 template once assembled. Holes for field splices of rolled beam stringers continuous over floor
 beams or cross frames and all holes for floor beams may be drilled full-size unassembled to a steel
 template.
 Sub-punch and ream holes for floor beam and stringer field end connections while assembled, or
 drill full-size to a steel template. Locate steel template before reaming and drilling. Use exact
 duplicates of templates for reaming matching members or the opposite faces of a single member.
 Locate templates used for connections on similar parts or members so match-marking is not
 required.
 The Engineer may allow full-size drilling of holes instead of sub-punching and reaming or subdrilling and reaming for all thicknesses.
 
 11. Heat-Curving. Flanges of curved, welded girders may be cut to the radii specified or curved by
 applying heat.
 a.
 
 Minimum Radius for Heat-Curving. Heat-curving of beams and girders is allowed when the
 horizontal radius of curvature measured to the centerline of the member web is greater than both
 values calculated by Equations 1 and 2 below, and greater than 150 feet at any and all cross
 sections throughout the length of the member. Do not heat-curve steels manufactured to a yield
 strength greater than 50 kips per square inch, other than AASHTO M270, Grade HPS 70W.

 STEEL STRUCTURES
 
 SECTION 615
 t = web thickness, inch;
 R = radius, inch.
 
 In addition to the above requirements, do not heat-curve if the radius is less than 1,000 feet when
 the flange thickness exceeds 3 inches or the flange width exceeds 30 inches.
 b.
 
 Type of Heating. Curve beams and girders by either continuous or V-type heating. For the
 continuous method, heat a strip or intermittent strips along the edge of the top and bottom flange
 simultaneously. Ensure the strip has sufficient width and temperature to obtain the required
 curvature.
 For V-type heating, heat the top and bottom flanges in truncated triangular or wedge-shaped areas
 having their base along the flange edge and spaced at regular intervals along each flange. Ensure
 the spacing and temperature are sufficient to obtain the required curvature. Heat along the top and
 bottom flange at the same rate. Terminate the apex of the truncated triangular area applied to the
 inside flange surface before the juncture of the web and the flange is reached. Avoid applying heat
 directly to the web. When the radius of curvature is 1,000 feet or more, extend the apex of the
 heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface to the juncture of the flange and web. When
 the radius of curvature is less than 1,000 feet, extend the apex of the heating pattern applied to the
 outside flange surface past the web for a distance equal to one eighth of the flange width or 3
 inches, whichever is less. Size the pattern with an included angle of approximately 15 to 30
 degrees, and a base less than 10 inches. Obtain approval to vary the pattern.
 For both heating methods, heat the flange edges that will be on the inside of the horizontal curve.
 Heat both inside and outside flange surfaces concurrently when the flange thickness is 1-1/4
 inches or greater.
 
 c.
 
 Temperature. Conduct heat-curving operations at temperatures less than 1,150 degrees Fahrenheit.
 Do not artificially cool the girder until it has naturally cooled to 600 degrees Fahrenheit. Obtain
 approval for the method of artificial cooling.
 
 d.
 
 Position for Heating. Heat-curve the girder with the web in either a vertical or a horizontal
 position. When curved in the vertical position, brace or support the girder to prevent lateral
 deflection and keep the girder from overturning.
 When curved in the horizontal position, support the girder near its ends and at intermediate points
 to obtain a uniform curvature. Ensure the bending stress in the flanges caused by the dead load of
 the girder and externally applied loads remains within the allowable design stress. When the girder
 is positioned horizontally for heating, maintain intermediate safety catch blocks at the mid-length
 of the girder within 2 inches of the flanges at all times during the heating process to guard against
 a sudden sag resulting from plastic flange buckling.
 
 12. Cleaning and Coating: Clean and coat the work in accordance with Section 616.
 13. Shop Splices: Locate all shop web splices a minimum of 12 inches from shop flange splices and
 connection plates for cross frames. Flange and web shop splices must be completed and weldments
 inspected before fitting and welding flanges to webs.
 D. Assembly:
 1.
 
 Bolting. For bolted connections, clean metal contact surfaces before assembling. Assemble the member
 before drilling, reaming, or bolting. Remove all burrs and shavings and ensure the member is free from
 twists, bends, and other deformations.
 When assembling, allow enough drifting to bring the parts into position, however, do not allow the
 drifting to enlarge the holes or distort the metal.
 Install bolts with bolt heads on the bottom of bottom flanges and the exterior face of exterior girders.
 
 2.
 
 Welded Connections. Ensure that surfaces and edges to be welded are smooth, uniform, clean, and free
 of defects. Prepare edges according to AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code.

 SECTION 615
 
 Preassembly of Field Connections. Preassemble field connections of main members of trusses, arches,
 continuous beams, plate girders, bents, towers, and rigid frames prior to erection as necessary to verify
 the geometry of the completed Structure or unit and to verify or prepare field splices. Submit the
 method and details of preassembly for approval by the Engineer. Use methods and details of assembly
 that are consistent with the erection procedure shown on the approved erection plans and camber
 diagrams.
 Preassemble at least three contiguous panels or sections that are accurately adjusted for line and
 camber. For successive assemblies, include at least one section or panel of the previous assembly
 (repositioned if necessary and adequately pinned to ensure accurate alignment), plus two or more
 sections or panels added at the advancing end. In the case of Structures longer than 150 feet, make
 each assembly not less than 151 feet long regardless of the length of individual continuous panels or
 sections. The sequence of assembly may start from any location in the Structure and proceed in one or
 both directions, provided the preceding requirements are satisfied.
 Use the Progressive Truss and Girder Assembly, unless specified otherwise.
 a.
 
 Bolted Connections. Prepare holes for bolted connections as specified in Section 615.03.C.10.
 Where applicable, assemble major components with milled ends of compression members in full
 bearing and then ream their sub-sized holes to the specified size while the connections are
 assembled.
 
 b.

 between abutting flanges, with the segment preassembled, before performing a field-welded
 connection.
 
 4.
 
 Match-Marking. Match-mark connecting parts preassembled in the shop to ensure proper fit in the
 field. Provide a diagram that shows such marks.
 
 5.
 
 Connections Using Unfinished or Turned Bolts. When specified, furnish unfinished or turned bolts
 conforming to ASTM A307, Grade A Bolts. Provide bolts with single, self-locking nuts or double
 nuts, unless otherwise specified. Use beveled washers where bearing faces have a slope of more than
 1:20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis. The specifications of this section do not pertain to
 the use of high-strength bolts, which are addressed in Section 615.03.D.6.
 
 6.
 
 a.
 
 Unfinished Bolts. Furnish unfinished bolts unless otherwise specified.
 
 b.
 
 Turned Bolts. Provide turned bolts with an ANSI roughness rating value of 125 for the surface of
 the body of the bolts. Ream turned bolt holes and turn the bolt to a driving fit with the threads
 entirely outside of the holes. Use hexagonal-headed bolts and nuts and provide washers.
 
 Connections Using High-Strength Bolts. For connections using high-strength bolts, use ASTM A325
 or ASTM A490 high-strength bolts, or equivalent fasteners, installed to develop the minimum required
 bolt tension specified in Table 615.03-5. Install bolts in holes formed as specified in Section
 615.03.C.10. When Turn-of-Nut Tightening Method is used, provide hardened washers under the
 element turned in tightening.
 a. Bolted Parts. Use steel for all Material within the grip of the bolt. Do not use compressible Material
 such as gaskets or insulation within the grip. Ensure that bolted steel parts fit solidly together after
 the bolts are tightened. Limit the maximum slope to 1:20 for the surface parts in contact with the
 bolt head or nut with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis.
 b.
 
 Surface Conditions. At the time of assembly, ensure that all joint surfaces, including surfaces
 adjacent to the bolt head and nut, are free of scale, except tight mill scale, and free of dirt or other
 foreign material. Remove burrs and any other material that would prevent solid seating of the
 connected parts in the snug condition.
 Paint the faying surface, except in slip-critical joints, as designated in the AASHTO LRFD Bridge
 Design Specifications.
 Meet the following requirements, as applicable, for the faying surfaces of slip-critical connections:

 Roughen by hand-wire-brushing. Do not use power wire-brushing. Assemble and assign lot
 numbers prior to shipping. Protect from dirt and moisture at the job site. Remove from
 protective storage only the number of anticipated assemblies to be installed and tensioned
 during a work shift. Return unused assemblies to protected storage at the end of the shift. Do not
 clean assemblies of lubricant that is required to be present in the as-delivered condition. Clean
 assemblies for slip-critical connections that accumulate rust or dirt resulting from job site
 conditions. Clean, re-lubricate, and test for rotational capacity prior to installation. Lubricate
 galvanized nuts with a lubricator containing a visible dye. Ensure plain bolts are “oily” to touch
 when delivered and installed. Remove lubricant on exposed surfaces before painting.
 ii. Load Indicator Devices. Provide a bolt-tension measuring device, meeting ASTM F 959, at the
 job site to perform the rotational capacity test and to confirm the ability to satisfy the
 requirements of Table 615.03-5. If approved, the Contractor may use alternative design direct
 tension indicating devices provided they meet the above requirements or approved manufacturer
 specifications.
 iii. Calibrating Wrenches. For short-grip bolts, the Contractor may use direct tension indicators
 (DTI) with solid plates to perform the calibrated-wrench verification test instead of a tensionmeasuring device. Verify the DTI lot first with a longer-grip bolt in the tension measuring
 device. The Department will specify the test frequency. Calibrate the device annually.
 iv. Tensioning Fastener Assemblies. Tension and inspect bolt/nut/washer assemblies to the
 minimum tension specified in Table 615.03-5. Use impact wrenches to tension each bolt in
 approximately 10 seconds.

 Do not reuse ASTM A490 fasteners and galvanized ASTM A325 fasteners. The Contractor
 may reuse other ASTM A325 bolts, if approved. Prohibit touching up or re-torquing previously
 tensioned bolts that may have been loosened by the tensioning of adjacent bolts as the torquing
 continues from the initial position, and that do not require greater rotation, including the
 tolerance, than that required by Table 615.03-6.

 Install bolts in all holes of the connection and bring the connection to a snug condition.
 Snug systematically from the most rigid part of the connection to the free edges. Repeat until the
 full connection is in a snug condition.
 The minimum required bolt tension is 70 percent of the specified minimum tensile strength of
 bolts (ASTM Specifications for tests of full-size A325 and A490 bolts, loaded in axial tension)
 rounded to the nearest 1,000 pounds.
 For situations in which the bolt length measured from the underside of the head to the end of the
 bolt exceeds 12 diameters, determine the required rotation by tests in a suitable tension device
 simulating the actual conditions.
 v. Rotational Capacity Tests. Test for rotational capacity after galvanizing. Perform tests for all
 fastener assemblies. Include washers as part of the test even if they are not required as part of
 the installation procedure.
 Perform the rotational capacity test according to ASTM A325 and as follows: Test each
 combination of bolt production lot, nut lot, and washer lot as an assembly. The Contractor does
 not have to include washers not required by the installation procedures in the lot identification.
 Assign a rotational capacity lot number to each combination of lots tested. Test a minimum of
 two assemblies per rotational capacity lot.
 For bolts that are long enough to fit in a Skidmore-Wilhelm Calibrator, assemble the bolt, nut,
 and washer assembly in this device or an acceptable equivalent.
 Ensure the torque necessary to produce the required fastener tension does not exceed the value
 obtained by the following equation:
 Torque ≤ 0.25PD
 where:
 Torque =
 
 measured torque (foot-pounds)
 
 P
 
 measured bolt tension (pounds)
 
 =
 
 615 - 11
 
 STEEL STRUCTURES
 
 SECTION 615
 D
 
 =
 
 bolt diameter (foot)
 
 Test bolts that are too short to test in a Skidmore-Wilhelm Calibrator in a steel joint. Do not
 apply the tension requirement specified above. Instead, compute the maximum torque
 requirement, 0.25PD, using a value of P equal to the turn test tension taken as 1.15 times the
 bolt tension specified in Table 615.03-5.
 vi. Washer Requirements. Where the outer face of the bolted parts has a slope greater than 1:20
 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis, use a hardened beveled washer to compensate for
 the lack of parallelism.
 Ensure that hardened beveled washers for American Standard Beams and Channels that are
 square or rectangular meet ASTM F436, and taper in thickness.
 Hardened washers are not required for connections using ASTM A325 bolts except as follows:
 A) Use hardened washers under the element turned in tightening when the tightening is to be
 performed by calibrated wrench method.
 B) Hardened steel washers are required as part of rotational-capacity tests, even if they are not
 required in the actual installation.
 C) Where ASTM A490 bolts are to be installed in Material having a specified minimum yield
 strength less than 50 kips per square inch, irrespective of the tightening method.
 D) Where ASTM A490 bolts over 1.0 inch in diameter are to be installed in an oversize or
 short slotted hole in an outer-ply, in which case a washer of minimum thickness 0.3125
 inch shall be used under both the head and the nut. Multiple hardened washers stacked
 upon one another shall not be used.
 E) Where ASTM A325 bolts are to be installed in a long slotted hole in an outer ply, provide a
 plate washer or continuous bar of at least 5/16 inch thickness with standard holes. Furnish
 washers or bars of sufficient size to completely cover the slot after installation. Use a single
 hardened washer conforming to ASTM F436, but with a minimum thickness of 5/16 inch,
 or use a washer or bar of structural grade Material. Do not use multiple hardened washers
 to achieve a thickness of 5/16 inch.
 vii. Turn of Nut Installation Method. For the turn of the nut installation method, hardened washers
 are not required in this installation method, except as specified in Section 615.03.D.6.c.v.
 Check a representative sample of not fewer than 3 bolt and nut assemblies of each diameter,
 length, and grade to be used in the Work. Use a device capable of indicating bolt tension.
 Demonstrate that the method used by the bolting crew to develop a snug condition and to
 control the turns develops a tension of not less than 5 percent greater than the tension required
 by Table 615.03-5. Retest as required.
 Following the snug-tightening operation, tension bolts in the connection by the amount of
 rotation specified in Table 615.03-6. During the tensioning operation, ensure that there is no
 rotation of the part not turned by the wrench. Tension systematically from the most rigid part of
 the joint to the free edges.
 viii. Calibrated Wrench Installation Method. Use the calibrated wrench installation method only
 when wrenches are calibrated on a daily basis and when a hardened washer is used under the
 turned element. Standard torques determined from tables or from formulas that are assumed to
 relate torque to tension are acceptable.
 When using calibrated wrenches for installation, set them to deliver a torque calibrated to
 produce a tension of not less than 5 percent in excess of the minimum tension specified in Table
 615.03-5. Calibrate the installation procedures by verification testing at least once each
 Working Day for each fastener assembly lot that is being installed that day. Verify by testing
 three typical fastener assemblies from each lot in a tension-measuring device capable of
 
 615 - 12
 
 STEEL STRUCTURES
 
 SECTION 615
 
 indicating actual bolt tension. Sample bolts, nuts, and washers under the turned element from
 production lots. Recalibrate wrenches when there is a significant difference in the surface
 condition of the bolts, threads, nuts, or washers. Verify during installation in the assembled steel
 work that the wrench adjustment selected by the calibration does not produce a nut or bolt head
 rotation from snug condition greater than that allowed in Table 615.03-6. For manual torque
 wrenches, measure as nuts are torqued in the tensioning direction.
 When using calibrated wrenches to install and tension bolts in a connection, install bolts with
 hardened washers under the turned element. Snug and then tension the connection using the
 calibrated wrench. Tension systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges.
 Return the wrench to “touch up” previously torqued bolts that may have relaxed as a result of
 the subsequent tensioning of adjacent bolts. Continue until all bolts are tensioned as required.
 ix. Direct Tension Indicator Installation (DTI) Method. When tightening of bolts using DTI
 devices is used, assemble a representative sample of not less than three devices, for each
 diameter and grade of fastener to be used in the Work, in a calibration device capable of
 indicating bolt tension. Include flat-hardened washers in the test assembly, if required in the
 actual connection, arranged as those in the actual connections to be tensioned. Use the
 calibration test to demonstrate that the device indicates a tension not less than 5 percent greater
 than that specified in Table 615.03-5.
 When bolts are installed using DTIs conforming to the requirements of ASTM F959, install
 bolts in all holes of the connection and bring them to snug tight conditions. Snug tight is
 indicated by partial compression of the direct tension indicator protrusions. Provide a maximum
 gap of 0.005 inch after installation. Then tighten all fasteners, progressing systematically from
 the most rigid part of the connection to the free edges, in a manner that will minimize relaxation
 of previously tightened fasteners.
 x. Lock Pin and Collar Fasteners. Install lock pin and collar fasteners using approved methods.
 xi. Inspection. Inspect, in the presence of the Engineer, the tightened bolts using a calibrated torque
 wrench, unless alternate fasteners or direct tension indicator devices are used, allowing
 verification by other methods. Conduct the inspection before a loss of lubrication or corrosion
 influences the tightening torque.
 Place three fastener assembly lots in the same condition as those under inspection in a device
 calibrated to measure bolt tension. Conduct this calibration operation at least once each
 inspection Day. Use a washer under the turned element in tensioning each bolt if washers are
 used on the structure. If washers are not used, ensure that the Material used in the tensionmeasuring device abutting the part turned is of the same Specification as that used on the
 Structure. In the calibrated device, tension each bolt to the specified tension. Apply the
 inspecting wrench to the tensioned bolt to determine the torque required to turn the nut or head 5
 degrees (approximately 1 inch at a 12 inch radius) in the tensioning direction. The job
 inspection torque is the average of the torque required for all three bolts.
 Randomly select 10 percent (at least two) of the tensioned bolts in each connection. Apply the
 job inspection torque to each selected bolt with the inspecting wrench turned in the tensioning
 direction. If this torque turns no bolt head or nut, consider the bolts in this connection to be
 properly tensioned. If the torque turns one or more bolt heads or nuts, apply the job inspection
 torque to all bolts in the connection. Re-torque and re-inspect any bolt whose head or nut turns.
 7.
 
 Welding. Ensure that welding, welder qualifications, and prequalification of weld details and
 inspection of welds meet AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code.
 Do not weld or tack brackets, clips, shipping devices, or other Material not required to any member,
 unless specified.

 Falsework and Forms. For Falsework and forms, meet Section 604.
 
 2.
 
 Handling and Onsite Storing of Materials. Store Material on skids. Keep storage area clean and
 properly drained. Store girders and beams upright. Support long members to prevent damage from
 deflection. If the Department is furnishing the Material, check Material received against the shipping
 lists and report shortage or damage promptly in writing. Assume responsibility for damaged or lost
 Material.
 
 3.
 
 Bearings and Anchorages. Bearings and anchorages must meet Section 623. Verify substructure
 dimensions and elevations before ordering superstructure Materials for staged construction Projects.
 
 4.
 
 Erection Procedure. Follow erection procedures as detailed in the submitted erection drawings.
 Prepare and submit revised erection drawings detailing all proposed deviations. Recalculate and submit
 erection stresses that differ from the planned method. Document changes in stresses or in behavior for
 the temporary and final Structures. Provide additional Material required to keep both the temporary
 and final stresses within the allowable limits used in design.
 Provide temporary bracing or stiffening devices to accommodate handling stresses in individual
 members or segments of the Structure during erection.
 Support segments of the Structure to produce the proper alignment and camber in the completed
 Structure. Install cross frames and diagonal bracing to provide stability and ensure correct geometry.
 Provide all required temporary bracing.
 
 5.
 
 Field Assembly. Assemble using match marks. Ensure parts are not damaged or distorted. Clean
 bearing surfaces and surfaces to be in permanent contact before assembly. Fill a minimum one half of
 the holes in splices and field connections with bolts and cylindrical erection pins (half-bolts and halfpins) before installing and tightening the balance of high-strength bolts. Fill three fourths of the holes
 in splices and connections carrying traffic during erection.
 Fitting-up bolts may be the same high-strength bolts used in the installation. If other fitting-up bolts are
 required, use the same nominal diameter as the high-strength bolts. Use cylindrical erection pins that
 are 1/32 inch larger than the bolts.
 
 F.
 
 6.
 
 Pin Connections. Furnish pilot and driving nuts in driving pins. Drive pins to take full bearing. Tighten
 pin nuts and burr the thread at the face of the nut with a pointed tool.
 
 7.
 
 Misfits. Correct minor misfits by a minor amount of reaming, cutting, grinding, and chipping at the
 contractor’s expense. Errors in shop fabrication or deformation resulting from handling and
 transporting is cause for rejection.
 
 Steel Structures Repair:
 1.
 
 Replacing Steel Rivets/Bolts: Replace rivets/bolts with high strength bolts at locations identified in the
 Contract Documents.
 Where a group of rivets/bolts are being replaced, remove one rivet at a time. Immediately replace the
 rivet/bolt with a high-strength bolt before the next rivet/bolt is removed.
 
 2.
 
 Welding Repair: Ensure that welding removal and repair, welder qualifications, and prequalification
 of weld details and inspection of welds meet AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code.
 
 3.
 
 Heat Straightening Damaged Steel Girders: Brace the damaged girders sufficiently to control
 movements occurring during stress relief. Erect work platforms from the ground. Do not attach work
 platforms to the superstructure.
 The desired intent of the heating process is to relieve the girders of deformation and stresses.
 Incorporate high heat input into the localized areas of the steel, with a minimum amount of heat spread
 into the surrounding Material. Utilize an approximately 1 inch diameter, #3, multi-orifice (Rosebud)
 heating torch operating on approximately 25 pounds per square inch MAPP and 125 pounds per square
 inch oxygen (smaller torches are ineffective and larger torches are ineffective and tend to cause
 distortion). Obtain approval of the Equipment from the Engineer prior to its use.

 STEEL STRUCTURES
 
 SECTION 615
 
 Confine heating to the patterns described herein or as directed by the Engineer. Conduct heating such
 that the desired steel location is heated to between 1000 degrees Fahrenheit and 1100 degrees
 Fahrenheit, as rapidly as possible, without overheating. Any heating procedures that heat any location
 on the girder to a temperature greater than 1200 degrees Fahrenheit shall be considered destructive
 heating. Repair or replace steel damaged by overheating at the Contractor's expense.
 Confine heating patterns to the areas required to bring the member back to its original position. Heat
 pattern location areas will be approved in the field by the Engineer prior to the beginning of the
 process.
 During heating operations, in order to measure the intensity of heat, provide and use temperature
 indicating crayons manufactured for 600 degrees Fahrenheit, 1000 degrees Fahrenheit, 1100 degrees
 Fahrenheit, 1200 degrees Fahrenheit, and 1250 Fahrenheit temperature limits.
 Quenching with water, or water and air, will not be permitted. Cooling with dry compressed air will be
 permitted after the steel has cooled to 600 Fahrenheit.
 After the deformation is removed from the beam to the satisfaction of the Engineer, clean and paint the
 entire surface area indicated in the Contract Documents in accordance with the applicable requirements
 of Section 616. Match the paint color of the steel beam under repair to the color of the existing paint.

 SECTION 616 – STEEL COATINGS
 616.01 Description.
 Furnish and apply the systems of coatings including recoating for steel Structures.
 616.02 Materials.
 A. Furnish paint systems for coating structural steel that are Northeast Protective Coating Committee
 (NEPCOAT)-approved and listed on the NEPCOAT Qualified Products List (QPL). Only products on the
 NEPCOAT QPL that have successfully tested below the VOC limits of 340 g/l for the organic zinc rich
 primer coat and below 250 g/l for the intermediate and top coats may be used. Use the appropriate paint
 type for the application as follows:
 1.
 
 Use a paint system from NEPCOAT Qualified Products List A for shop-painted new structural steel.
 
 2.
 
 Use a paint system from NEPCOAT Qualified Products List B for existing painted structural steel.
 
 3.
 
 Use a different color for each coat (i.e., primer, intermediate, and finish coat). The color of the primer
 and intermediate coat can be the Contractor’s option but must provide contrast with the underlying
 substrate or previously applied paint. Do not mix or match different coats from different paint systems.
 
 4.

 Use only paint arriving at the work site in new, unopened containers. Label all containers of paint with
 the manufacturer’s name, product name, component part, batch number, date of manufacturer, and
 shelf life date. Immediately remove from the site paint in containers having expired shelf life dates.
 
 B. Containment System
 1.
 
 Prior to commencing any cleaning operations, prepare a Contaminant System for the capture,
 containment, collection, and storage of the waste generated by the work, which includes abrasive
 blasting residue, spent blasting mediums, rust, paint particles, dust, etc.
 
 2.
 
 The Containment System must be capable of containing the waste and resulting residue generated by
 the work, strive to achieve total containment (100 percent), and meet all Federal, State, and Local
 regulations using the best available technology as applicable to each bridge site. Ensure that the
 Containment System meets the requirements of SSPC Guide 6, Class 1A. Visible emissions in excess
 of SSPC Guide 6, Level 1 (one percent in the work day) shall be cause for immediate shut down until
 corrections are made.
 
 3.
 
 While on the site, hold tarps securely in place and keep sealed at all times during water-blasting, paint
 removal, and painting.
 
 4.
 
 For Bridges over water, the Containment System must include a skimming boom consisting of a float
 with a skirt to collect floating debris. Also, place an approved capturing device, such as a floating
 curtain, screen, or tarp under and downwind of the bridge, to catch rust, sand, and paint particles.
 Clean the waste material collected on the capturing device daily.
 
 5.
 
 Prior to commencing work, submit Working Drawings to the Department within 14 Days from Notice
 of Award in accordance with the following:
 a.
 
 Submit Working Drawings, sealed by a Professional Engineer registered in the State of Delaware,
 in accordance with Section 105.04 of the Standard Specifications.
 
 b.
 
 Show the Containment System in plan & elevation views, including details of clips and hangers.
 
 c.
 
 Include locations and magnitudes of all loads from the proposed Containment System on the
 existing Structure, including dead, live, blast waste, and wind loads.
 
 d.
 
 Indicate maximum permissible load of abrasive or waste permitted on the Containment System.
 
 e.
 
 Indicate if vehicles with abrasive and waste will be permitted on the Bridge; if so, indicate
 allowable load and locations. Vehicle and Equipment loads may not be permitted behind
 abutments if surcharging results.
 
 f.
 
 Indicate all restrictions on Bridge including any load-posting.
 
 g.
 
 Permanent attachments or fasteners to the bridge will not be permitted.
 
 h.
 
 Show the location(s) of skimming boom(s) and capturing device(s) if the Bridge is over water.
 
 i.
 
 Identify all Containment System components and indicate all rigid framework, work platform, and
 scaffolding.
 
 j.
 
 Weight down all curtains, screens, or tarps used for containment.
 
 k.
 
 Identify points of attachment to the Structure and ensure that those locations are capable of
 supporting the proposed loads.
 
 The Department will analyze and assure that the system will not induce a load on the Bridge that will
 create an overstress condition or otherwise affect the structural integrity of the bridge. If the
 Department determines that the proposed system overstresses the Bridge, submit a new system
 following the above process. In no case shall the Containment System, safety devices, or Equipment
 
 616 - 2
 
 STEEL COATINGS
 
 SECTION 616
 
 encroach upon the minimum Bridge clearances indicated in the Contract Documents, unless otherwise
 approved by the Engineer.
 6.
 
 With the submission of the Containment System Drawing(s), develop and submit for approval an
 Effective Safety Program to be followed during the paint removal period. The Contractor's employees,
 before being engaged in paint removal Work, must have proper training in accordance with the OSHA
 General Industry Standard.
 
 7.
 
 The review and acceptance of the Working Drawings by the Department in no way relieves the
 Contractor of any responsibility for obtaining the required degree of capture, containment, and
 collection.
 
 8.
 
 The Containment System must be properly maintained while Work is in progress. Do not deviate from
 the approved Working Drawings without prior approval of the Engineer.
 
 9.
 
 Deny public access to all rigging, scaffolding, and the Containment Systems at all times.
 
 C. Surface Preparation
 1.
 
 Feather back the perimeter or edge of intact paint adjoining the cleaned surface and tightly adhere the
 adjoining paint. Ragged edges on intact paint will not be allowed. Adherence will only be considered
 satisfactory if the adjoining remaining paint is smoothly feathered back and cannot be removed by lifting
 with a dull putty knife.
 
 2.
 
 Power tool-clean surfaces only when approved by the Engineer and in accordance with SSPC-SP11.
 
 3.
 
 Surfaces must conform to the applicable SSPC Visual Standard.

 accordance with the Coating Manufacturer’s recommendations and with state VOC regulations for
 each approved coating. Unauthorized use of solvents will result in re-cleaning and repainting the
 surface in accordance with this Specification, at no cost to the Department.
 
 6.
 
 Unless specified otherwise in the Contract Documents, before all the steel receives its first full prime
 coat of coating, stripe coat the following with the approved primer coating in accordance with the most
 current SSPC-PA1 and SSPC-PA Guide 11:
 a.

 MAR 2013
 
 E. Hazardous Material – Air Monitoring for Particulate Matter (PM-10) and Total Suspended Particulate
 Matter (TSP) Lead
 1.
 
 The intent of the monitoring requirements in this Specification is to establish a baseline background
 reading for the area(s) in proximity to steel cleaning.
 
 2.
 
 Perform all of the testing required to ensure that lead particles are adequately contained and captured
 by the steel cleaning operations.
 
 3.
 
 Engage a consultant responsible for conducting air monitoring Work during the period of the paint
 removal operations. Submit the qualifications of the consultant for approval by the Department prior
 to his/her engagement in any air monitoring service. Conduct monitoring on the area downwind of the
 lead control area. Monitor the air quality standard in accordance with National Ambient Air Quality
 Standards (NAAQS). At a minimum, the containment system must achieve a SSPC Guide 6, Level 1
 Standard Emissions level.
 
 4.
 
 Record baseline monitoring at each structure where the Contractor is required to clean the existing
 steel in order to establish preconstruction background readings for the area(s) involved. Perform
 baseline monitoring for a minimum of 3 consecutive Calendar Days before the steel cleaning begins.
 Conduct the monitoring so that the monitored hours match the proposed Work Schedule for the
 Contract, including night work. The minimum duration of the monitoring for each Calendar Day must
 be 8 hours, regardless of the Contractor’s proposed Work Schedule. The required sampling type shall
 be 2 (two) PM-10 and 2 (two) TSP-Lead and the Engineer must approve the locations of the sampling.
 During lead paint removal, commence air monitoring just prior to the start of any lead removal
 operation and continue whenever the steel cleaning operation is in progress. Paint removal includes
 blasting as well as clean-up activities. If problems with containment occur, the Engineer will require
 the air monitoring to be reinstalled at no cost to the Department.
 
 5.
 
 The acceptance level for Particulate Matter (PM-10) (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than
 or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers) shall be 150 micrograms per cubic meter of air for 24-hour
 average concentration (450 micrograms per cubic meter of air over an eight-hour period assuming no
 emissions occur from the project for the remaining 16 hours).
 
 6.
 
 The acceptance level for Total Suspended Particulate Matter (TSP) lead emissions shall be 1.5
 micrograms per cubic meter of air averaged over a calendar quarter of the year, which can be
 converted as noted below to achieve daily lead level allowance during the project operation:
 DA = (90/PD) x 1.5 micrograms per cubic meter. where
 DA = Daily Allowance (micrograms per cubic meter)
 PD =Number of paint removal operation days anticipated in a 90-day period.
 
 616 - 5
 
 STEEL COATINGS
 
 SECTION 616
 
 For example, if it is expected that 30 days out of 90 will be worked, the TSP lead emission criteria
 for each of those days would be 4.5 micrograms per cubic meter, over a 24-hour period (90/30 x
 1.5). However, since the paint removal operation will not continue for the full 24 hours, this level
 of emissions can be increased using the following formula:
 ADA = DA x (24/H), where
 ADA = Adjusted Daily Allowance (micrograms per cubic meter)
 H = Hours worked in 24 hours.
 Using the above example, if the paint removal operation is continued for eight hours out of each
 24-hour workday, the ADA will be 13.5 micrograms per cubic meter (4.5 micrograms per cubic
 meter x 24/8). Thus, 13.5 μg/m3 could be emitted during the eight hours of Work, provided no
 emissions occur during the remaining 16 hours.
 
 F.
 
 7.
 
 Use a containment system that is an area approximately equivalent to what a work crew can blastclean, inspect, paint, and move in a 24-hour period. The Engineer may permit a larger containment
 system if the Contractor can demonstrate that such a system will increase productivity and not interfere
 with the flow of traffic. When dust leaks are noted in the containment system, make repairs as soon as
 possible.
 
 8.
 
 If the containment system fails to function at the required level of efficiency at any time during the
 execution of the Work, as determined by the Engineer, immediately suspend all operations except
 those intended to minimize the adverse impact to the environment. Operations must not resume until
 modifications have been made to correct the cause of the failure, to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 
 9.
 
 Provide for a full-time hygienist to be on the job site during lead paint removal activities to insure
 required hygiene procedures are being followed.
 
 Collection, Storage and Disposal of Hazardous and Non-Hazardous Waste
 1.
 
 All waste discharged and collected from the Containment System must be protected in a manner so as
 to prevent migration of the waste into the environment. Abide by all Federal and State regulations
 relating to collection, storage, and disposal of the hazardous waste and solid waste.
 
 2.
 
 Provide a cleanup area with soap, water, and container for collecting and disposing of the hazardous
 waste at each work site. Obtain a permit for hauling the hazardous waste from the State Department of
 Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).
 
 3.
 
 Each Day, collect and contain waste material in sealed 55-gallon open-head-type drums (I.C.C.
 Specification 17-H). All drums must be in new condition and approved for use by the Engineer. Label
 drums with the words "HAZARDOUS WASTE" and tag in accordance with all State regulations
 including Bridge number, Contract number, Contractor's name, contents, and the date when waste
 accumulation in the drum begins. Keep no more than 29 drums of hazardous material at the site of
 each Bridge.
 
 4.
 
 The waste to be placed in drums also includes all filters used in abrasive blasting Equipment and
 vacuum power tools for removing hazardous and non-hazardous paint waste. At the end of the
 Contract, remove all such filters from Equipment used on the Project and place in drums with other
 hazardous waste for proper disposal.
 
 5.
 
 At the end of each Working Day, haul the waste material contained and collected to a temporary secure
 accumulation site that has been pre-approved by the Engineer. Maintain the accumulation site in a
 secured condition. Hauling of hazardous waste must be performed by a properly licensed hauler.
 
 6.
 
 The storage site and the accumulation site must be capable of preventing the migration of the leadcontaminated waste material into the environment. Provide both areas with protection from vandalism
 and unauthorized access by the general public. At the completion of the Work and in the presence of
 the Engineer, take representative samples of the accumulated residues collected at each Bridge.
 
 616 - 6
 
 STEEL COATINGS
 
 SECTION 616
 
 7.
 
 Consider samples exceeding 5 parts per million according to the EPA SW-846, Test Method 1311,
 Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test as hazardous waste and dispose of
 accordingly. If the sample's toxicity level has dropped to 5 parts per million or less, then transport and
 dispose of the waste as industrial waste, provided it is stabilized.
 
 8.
 
 In order to stabilize the industrial waste (below the toxicity level), add a slurry made from Portland
 Cement (10 percent of waste by volume) and water (50 percent of cement by volume) to the waste.
 Utilize a licensed hazardous waste hauler to thoroughly mix the slurry and waste at the disposal site.
 Do not dispose of blasting debris or dust collector waste as an industrial waste. Either stabilize or
 dispose of them as a hazardous waste, regardless of the results of the TCLP test.
 
 9.
 
 Deliver the samples to a laboratory approved by the Department for testing according to the EPA SW846, Test Method 1311, Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP). Should test results
 indicate that the contaminants listed in the following table are above their respective regulatory limits,
 the residue shall be deemed a hazardous waste and must be treated before disposal.

 SECTION 617
 
 ii. Clean and lubricate the exposed threads of all anchor bolts. Clean and lubricate the threads and
 bearing surfaces of all leveling nuts. Re-lubricate the exposed threads of the anchor bolts and
 the threads of the leveling nuts if more than 24 hours has elapsed since earlier lubrication, or if
 the anchor bolts and leveling nuts have become wet since they were first lubricated.
 iii. Turn the leveling nuts onto the anchor bolts and align the nuts to the same elevation.
 iv. Place structural washers on top of the leveling nuts (one washer corresponding to each anchor
 bolt).
 v. Install the base plate atop the leveling nuts, place structural washers on top of the base plate
 (one washer corresponding to each anchor bolt), and turn the top nuts onto the anchor bolts.
 vi. Tighten top nuts to a snug-tight condition in a star pattern. Snug-tight is defined as the
 maximum nut rotation resulting from the full effort of one person using a 12-inch-long wrench
 or equivalent. A star tightening pattern is one in which the nuts on opposite or near-opposite
 sides of the bolt circle are successively tightened in a pattern resembling a star. (For example,
 for an 8-bolt circle with bolts sequentially numbered 1 to 8, tighten nuts in the following bolt
 order: 1, 5, 7, 3, 8, 4, 6, 2.)
 vii. Tighten leveling nuts to a snug-tight condition in a star pattern.
 viii. Before final tightening of the top nuts, mark the reference position of each top nut in a snugtight condition with a suitable marking on one flat with a correspondence reference mark on the
 base plate at each bolt. Then incrementally turn the top nuts using a star pattern until achieving
 the required nut rotation specified in Section 615, Table 615.03-6. Turn the nuts in at least two,
 full tightening cycles (passes). After tightening, verify the nut rotation.
 ix. Tighten top bolt of double-nut assembly to snug-tight.
 c.
 
 Verify base plate is in full contact with all flat washers.
 
 d.
 
 Burr off threads of anchor bolts at face of nut after column is installed.
 
 4.
 
 Grout Pad. Do not use grout between the base plate and concrete pedestal.
 
 5.
 
 Galvanized Steel Screen. Seal the gap between the base plate and the foundation with a galvanized
 steel screen. Install galvanized steel screen to prevent entry of rodents while permitting drainage.
 Cover the entire gap with a wire screen, the bottom horizontal wire of which shall be in full contact
 with the surface of the concrete foundation and the top horizontal wire of which shall not extend
 beyond the top surface of the base plate. Vertical screen wires shall not extend beyond the top and
 bottom horizontal wires of the screen. Use one continuous section of screen with only one overlapping
 splice where the ends come together and overlap the layers 3 inches minimum. Attach the screen to
 the vertical side of the base plate with self-tapping stainless steel screws (No. 8, 1/2 inch long) with
 stainless steel washers (1/4 inch inside diameter). Drill pilot holes into the base plate to facilitate
 screw installation. Install screws on 9 inch centers maximum and at least one screw shall be installed
 through the overlapping splice to clamp the layers together. Also clamp the overlapping splice layers
 together just above the concrete foundation with an all-stainless-steel fastener assembly consisting of a
 machine screw (No. 8, 5/8 inch long), nut and two flat washers (1/4 inch inside diameter) and lock
 washer. Tightly clamp the screen layers between the flat washers.

 fabricating, erecting, treating, and painting of wood and hardware.
 621.02 Materials.
 Provide Materials as specified in:
 Wood
 
 Section 1041
 
 621.03 Construction.
 A. Ensure that all framing is true and exact. Drive nails and spikes with force just sufficient to set the heads
 flush with the surface of the wood. The Engineer may consider hammer marks in wood surfaces as
 evidence of poor quality and as sufficient cause to call for removal of the worker who caused them.
 B. Stack all lumber and timber on the site of the Work to prevent warping. Stack untreated Material on
 supports at least 12 inches above the ground surface and open-stacked. Stack treated material on supports
 at least 12 inches above the ground surface and close-stacked. Provide acceptable cover to protect all
 Material from the weather.
 C. Treated Wood:
 1. Handling. Avoid damage to treated timber and handle the timber only with web slings. Provide
 corner protectors when metal bands are used to bundle members.
 2. Framing and Boring. Cut, frame, and bore treated timbers before treatment insofar as is
 practicable. Place untreated cuts, borings, or other joint framings above the high-water elevation when
 treated timbers are to be placed in waters inhabited by marine borers.
 3. Cuts and Abrasions. Field-treat all cuts, abrasions, and recesses that occur after treating timbers in
 accordance with Section 1041.04(E).
 4. Bored Holes. Treat holes bored after treatment in accordance with Section 1041.04(E). After
 treatment, plug holes that are not filled with bolts or other items with preservative-treated plugs.
 5. Temporary Attachments. Treat holes resulting from forms or temporary braces that are attached to
 treated timber with nails or spikes, as required for bored holes, and fill by driving galvanized nails,
 spikes, or preservative-treated plugs flush with the surface.
 D. Connectors and Fasteners:
 1.
 
 Installing Connectors. When installing split rings and shear plates, use precut grooves of the specified
 dimensions or as recommended by the manufacturer. Force spike grids into the wood so that members
 will be in firm contact. Use pressure Equipment that does not damage the wood surface. Replace
 temporary high-strength bolts with specified bolts for the final installation. Embed all connectors at
 the joint simultaneously and uniformly. Cut connector grooves in wood, concentric with the bolt hole.
 Make grooves conform to the cross-sectional shape of the rings, and provide a snug fit. Make the
 inside groove diameter larger than the nominal ring diameter. Fabricate structural members using
 connectors prior to preservative treatment. Drill bolt holes perpendicular to the face of the member.
 Store wood, after fabrication, in a manner that prevents changes in the dimensions of the members
 before assembly. Cure the wood before fabrication so that its dimensions remain stable. Reject wood
 that shrinks during storage, causing predrilled grooves for split rings, plate size, or bolt hole spacing to
 change.
 
 2.
 
 Fastenings. Drill the holes for round drift bolts and dowels 1/16 inch less in diameter than the bolt or
 dowel. Drill holes for square drift bolts or dowels equal in diameter to the least dimension of the bolt
 or dowel. Drill the holes for machine bolts 1/16 inch greater than the diameter of the bolt.
 
 621 - 1
 
 WOOD STRUCTURES
 
 SECTION 621
 
 Drill the holes for lag screws with a bit not larger than the body of the screw at the base of the threaded
 portion. Drill the hole for the shank 1/16 inch greater than the diameter of the shank and to the same
 depth as the shank. Use a washer under bolt heads and nuts that would otherwise come in contact with
 wood (except for timber bolts with economy-type heads). Tighten all nuts to a snug fit condition.
 Retighten all nuts after full assembly. Lock the nuts of bolts after final tightening by burring or other
 approved method.
 3.
 
 Countersinking. Countersink hardware when smooth or flush surfaces are required. Treat all recesses
 formed for countersinking in treated timber, as specified in Section 1041.04(E).
 
 E. Framing. Cut and frame lumber and timber to a close fit so that the joints will have even bearing over the
 entire contact surfaces without requiring shims. Open joints will be rejected.
 F.
 
 Caps. Place timber caps, with ends aligned, in a manner to secure an even and uniform bearing over the
 tops of the supporting piles. Secure caps by drift bolts at least 3/4 inch in diameter, extending at least 9
 inches into the piles. Place the drift bolts approximately in the center of the pile.
 
 G. Wood Wing and Abutment Backing. Place wood backing, with horizontal members being level and secured
 directly to the pile or nailing block. Secure horizontal backing with a minimum of two lag screws, with
 washers at least 3/8 inches in diameter per pile, extending at least 4 inches into the piles. Place the lag
 screws approximately in the center of the pile and recess the heads below the top of the sheeting.
 Use tongue-and-groove lumber for vertical members of wood backing. Place vertical members of wood
 backing plumb and secured directly to the horizontal backing. Secure vertical backing with a minimum of
 two lag screws, with washers at least 3/8 inch in diameter, to each of the top two rows of horizontal
 backing. Place the lag screws so that they extend a minimum of 2 inches into the horizontal backing but do
 not extend through the horizontal backing.
 H. Bracing. Bolt bracing through the pile or cap at the ends and at intermediate intersections using a bolt of
 not less than 5/8 inch in diameter. Use bracing of sufficient length to provide a minimum distance of 8
 inches between the outside bolt and the end of the brace.
 I.
 
 Stringers. Size stringers at bearings and place in position so that knots near edges will be in the top
 portions of the stringers. Join outside stringers with lap joints or butt joints with the ends cut on a taper.
 Lap-join interior stringers to take bearing over the full width of the floor beam or cap at each end. Securely
 fasten all stringers by drift bolting. Stagger the joints when stringers are two panels in length. Place crossbridging or blocking at the center of each span. Frame the cross-bridging between stringers neatly, and
 toenail securely with at least two nails in each end. Provide full bearing of cross-bridging members, at each
 end, against the sides of stringers. Cut blocking to a snug-fit condition and secure by nailing.
 
 J.
 
 Plank Decks. Use planks for decking that are surfaced on four sides. Provide single-plank decks, as
 required, consisting of a single thickness of plank supported by stringers or joists. Lay the planks heart side
 down.
 1.
 
 Lay planks with 1/8 inch openings between them when using seasoned Material, untreated Material, or
 Material treated with oil-borne preservatives.
 
 2.
 
 Lay planks with tight joints when using unseasoned Material or Material treated with water-borne
 preservatives.
 
 3.
 
 Firmly spike each plank to each joist. Lay planks so that no two adjacent planks vary in thickness by
 more than 1/8 inch. Provide a finished surface that is free of defects.
 
 K. Glue-Laminated Panel Decks. Prepare glue-laminated deck panels by pressure-preservative-treatment in
 accordance with Section 1041.04(A). Apply a preservative treatment to untreated field-cut or drilled areas
 when it is not possible to complete the fabrication and drilling of members before treating. Plane one side
 of deck panels only. The top of the deck shall be left rough to ensure proper bonding with bituminous
 Material. Remove excess oil by absorption prior to paving. Handle and transport glue-laminated deck
 panels in a way to prevent bending the panels. Support the panels at a sufficient number of points to avoid
 overstressing, and protect the edges from damage.

 complete set of Working Drawings in accordance with Section 105.04. The submittal must include
 details and drawings of the steel elements, seals, and all other permanent elements fabricated as part of
 the joint system. The submittal must also include technical data relating to the joint Material, patching
 mortar, primer, adhesive, and other related Materials, as well as mill test reports for all steel.
 
 2.
 
 Arrange for a manufacturer’s representative to be present during the initial installation of the respective
 joint system. A manufacturer’s letter of certification as an approved installer may also be accepted in
 lieu of having a manufacturer’s representative onsite. Qualifying personnel must oversee all
 operations.
 
 B. Prefabricated Expansion Joint System
 1.
 
 For rehabilitations, remove existing joint plus enough concrete to properly install the new joint system.
 Repair concrete in accordance with Section 628 as required.
 
 2.
 
 Install the prefabricated expansion joint system, including strip seal, steel extrusion, and application of
 adhesives, in accordance with the manufacturer's written recommendations and instructions. Provide
 special tools for insertion of seals as required by the manufacturer.
 
 3.
 
 Furnish the strip seal in one piece for the full length of the joint.
 
 4.
 
 Unless approved otherwise, shop-assemble the prefabricated sealing system as a unit, including the
 neoprene strip seal, and preset prior to shipment, using prestressing bolts and adjustable temporary
 connections between positioning steel members.
 
 5.
 
 Initially set the opening of the joint at the width required for the seal at a temperature of 68 degrees
 Fahrenheit.
 
 6.
 
 Position and attach the prefabricated joint assembly to the Structure by anchorages. Make width
 adjustments at the discretion of the Engineer and manufacturer's representative. Be sure to consider all
 movements due to temperature, shrinkage, creep, mid-slab deflections, and other factors.
 
 7.
 
 Set the prefabricated joint normal to the grade and to the deck concrete slab that will be graded to meet
 flush with the edge of the joint plates.
 
 8.
 
 Before placing the deck slab, release the anchorage attached to the abutment backwall, adjacent steel,
 
 624 - 1
 
 JOINTS
 
 SECTION 624
 or concrete stringers by loosening the bolts in the slotted anchorage connections. The prestressing
 bolts and adjustable temporary connections shall remain in place. After the deck slab has cured, check
 the width of joint again and adjust if necessary.
 
 9.
 
 Tighten and weld the released anchorage, and remove the prestressing bolts and temporary
 connections. The backwall or deck on this side of the joint may then be poured after sealing the
 openings left by removal of the prestressing bolts.
 
 C. Strip Seal Gland
 1.
 
 Fully remove the existing strip seal gland and adhesive.
 
 2.
 
 Abrasive-blast-clean extrusion to remove all foreign materials. Take care not to damage existing steel
 extrusions.
 
 3.
 
 Install the prefabricated strip seal and apply adhesives in accordance with the manufacturer's written
 recommendations and instructions and as specified herein. Special tools for insertion of seals shall be
 provided by the manufacturer as may be required. Ensure that the strip seal gland is fully seated in the
 steel extrusions.
 
 4.
 
 Furnish and install the strip seal in one piece for the full width of the joint.
 
 D. Closed-Cell Joint Seal
 1.
 
 Prior to ordering the joint Material, measure the joint opening to confirm the required size of the joint
 Material. If the required size conflicts with the Contract Documents, notify the Engineer immediately.
 
 2.
 
 Strictly follow the manufacturer’s recommendations and installation procedures for preparing the
 surface of the concrete/steel substrates prior to receiving the joint Material and for installing the joint
 Material.
 
 3.
 
 Install the joint Material under a compression of 25 percent. Use the manufacturer’s recommended
 bonding agent. The bond strength must be greater than the joint material's tensile strength, which is
 115 pounds per square inch. (ASTM D3575, Suffix T).
 
 4.
 
 All directional changes in joint material must be done using the heat welding method. Place the joint
 Material ends against a teflon heating iron at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 to 20 seconds. Then place
 the ends together tightly. DO NOT test the weld until the Material has completely cooled. The Material
 can be heat welded at the site to increase lengths but not to increase depth or width. However, the
 Material may be cut down and have grooves applied by a factory representative upon written
 permission from the manufacturer.
 
 5.
 
 Heat welds are not necessary for turns from vertical to horizontal or from horizontal to vertical unless
 it is necessary to keep the Material flush at these locations. In those areas where the Material must
 remain flush, the Material may bend to conform to these turns. For vertical turns, the maximum angle
 is 115 degrees Fahrenheit without having to cut and heat weld the directional turn. For horizontal
 turns, the maximum angle is 135 degrees Fahrenheit.

 l.
 
 Sandblasting equipment, required only for installation in a concrete overlay;
 
 m. Safety clothing and Equipment as required by OSHA.
 n.
 
 Any other Material needed in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 
 2.
 
 Prepare the surface of the concrete substrates prior to receiving the joint material and install the joint
 Material in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
 
 3.
 
 Centrally locate the joint over the deck expansion gap or fixed joint. Mark out the joint to the
 recommended width of 20 inches.
 
 4.
 
 Remove the concrete in the joint by the use of saws and pneumatic hand tools. Where possible, set the
 saws to cut the full-required depth of the wearing surface and any membrane present. Variations in the
 depth of the wearing surface across the road should be considered to ensure, where possible, that the
 deck is not damaged. Remove all debris from the excavation channel to allow the full volume of new
 joint to be installed.
 
 5.
 
 Thoroughly clean and dry the entire channel. Remove small debris by using compressed air. Apply
 the Hot Compressed Air Lance throughout the length of the channel. Installation in concrete overlays
 requires sandblasting of the concrete vertical walls and adjacent deck area prior to the use of the HCA
 Lance application.
 
 6.
 
 Repair spalled and defective concrete by an approved Material as agreed upon by the Engineer.
 
 7.
 
 Install the backer rod and caulk the gap along the backer rod, allowing for approximately 1 inch of
 binder in the gap on top of the rod. If previous caulking is intact and will hold the binder, it may be
 used to take the place of the backer rod. Place a small amount of hot binder onto the caulking to
 ensure that the gap is adequately plugged.
 
 8.
 
 Immediately after cleaning and caulking, coat the entire channel with a thin layer of hot binder. If
 significant delay occurs, the channel shall be inspected by the Engineer to determine if re-cleaning is
 necessary.
 
 9.
 
 Bridge the gap with the steel plates centered over the gap by placing locating pins in the centerline of
 the plate. There must be at least 2 inches between the edge of the steel plate and the wall of the
 channel. Ensure that the steel plate sits squarely on the concrete surfaces and does not rock. If
 necessary, remove additional concrete and build up the joint using patch mortar to the required
 elevation. Once the locating pins are in place, coat the top of the plate with a thin layer of hot binder.
 
 10. The aggregate must be heated in a vented or un-vented rotating drum mixer by the use of a HCA Lance
 or a PAT torch. Once the aggregate has been heated to a temperature of 370 to 380 degrees
 Fahrenheit, coat the aggregate with a small quantity of binder. One gallon of binder per 100 pounds of
 stone should sufficiently coat the stone.
 11. Heat the binder to the recommended pouring temperature of 370 to 385 degrees Fahrenheit. At no
 time shall the recommended safe heating temperature of 400 degrees Fahrenheit be exceeded.
 12. Place layers of hot pre-coated aggregate, not more than 2-1/2 inches thick, in the channel and
 immediately cover to the level of the coated aggregate. This will ensure that the 3:1 weight ratio of
 aggregate to binder has been achieved. Layers shall be raked to insure the aggregate is completely
 624 - 3
 
 JOINTS
 
 SECTION 624
 coated and that all air pockets are eliminated. Cease this process approximately 3/4 inch from the top
 of the channel.
 
 13. Apply the surface layer as other layers except that the pre-coated aggregate is not flooded with binder.
 Transfer the pre-coated aggregate to the joint and level slightly higher than the adjacent road surface.
 On a standard 2 inch deep joint, the top-coat should be 1/4 inch higher than the road surface. Deeper
 joints will require higher levels before tamping.
 14. Compaction should take place after the joint has cooled to approximately 225 degrees Fahrenheit.
 Make the joint surface flush with the existing road surface by using the vibratory plate or roller or as
 per the manufacturer’s recommendation.
 15. After compaction, place lines of 4-inch tape 1 inch beyond the joint width on each side of the joint to
 ensure evenness of appearance. Topcoat the joint and at least 1 inch of the road surface with the hot
 binder until the surface is smooth and absent of voids. If it is impossible to topcoat the joint during the
 same working day/night, it is allowable that the topcoat step be completed on the next working
 day/night. However, the surface must be cleaned, dried, and heated with the HCA Lance.
 16. Immediately after top-coating, spread an anti-skid Material evenly over the joint to eliminate Material
 tracking.
 17. Prior to departure, ensure that the entire work area is clean of debris.
 18. In the event of a Work stoppage, fill the cavity with cold-patch asphalt in accordance with Section
 1015.
 19. After curing of the asphaltic joint Material, completely seal the parapet joints along the traffic face of
 the parapet, following all of the manufacturer's surface preparation and installation procedures.
 20. During installation and surface preparation, have qualified personnel on site to oversee and direct the
 operation for conformance with manufacturer’s specifications of both the asphaltic and parapet joint
 seals.
 F.
 
 Silicone Seal
 1.
 
 Remove and dispose of existing joint seal.
 
 2.
 
 Sand-blast the steel surfaces of the armor and/or angles to receive the silicone seal to a near-whitemetal SSPC-SP10 immediately before the application of the adhesive and installation of the seal to
 remove all traces of contaminates from the joint faces. Immediately prior to round backer rod
 installation, blow all joints clean with compressed air. The joint must be thoroughly dry and clean.
 The round backer rod may be installed by hand, but a roller device shall be used to insure a consistent,
 uniform placement at the proper depth below the bridge deck surface.
 
 3.
 
 Install the silicone sealant as soon after cleaning and round backer rod placement as reasonably
 possible to insure the joints are still clean and dry. In the event the joint does become contaminated,
 damp, or wet, remove the round backer rod, clean and dry the joint, and install a new round backer rod.
 
 4.
 
 Install the silicone sealant according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and to the shape and
 dimensions shown in the Contract Documents. Any failure of the sealed joint due to lack of adhesion
 or cohesion of joint Material, improper or unsatisfactory workmanship by the Contractor, or damage
 by the Contractor’s operations or traffic, will be cause for rejection. Repair the joint to the Engineer’s
 satisfaction at no additional cost to the Department.
 
 5.
 
 Do not install silicone seal directly on a concrete surface.
 
 6.
 
 Ensure that the silicone seal is placed at least 1/2 inch below the riding surface.
 
 7.
 
 After a joint has been sealed, remove all excess sealant or other residue on the bridge deck surface. Do
 not allow traffic on the new seal until the sealant is tack-free and until debris from traffic does not
 imbed into the sealant.
 
 G. Compression Seal
 624 - 4
 
 JOINTS
 
 SECTION 624
 
 1.
 
 Sand-blast steel surfaces of the armor and/or angles to receive the compression seal to a near-whitemetal SSPC-SP10 immediately before the application of the adhesive and installation of the seal.
 
 2.
 
 Perform all welding and steel cutting Work in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section
 615 of the Standard Specifications.
 
 3.
 
 All concrete surfaces to receive compression seal shall be free from dirt, oil, rust, and any other loose
 foreign debris that may be detrimental to effective joint sealing. Repair spalls and cracks with patch
 mortar to form a clean joint opening with sharp edges.
 
 4.
 
 Follow the manufacturer's recommendations in surface preparation, application of adhesive, and
 installation of the compression seal. Ensure that the compression seal is placed at least 1/2 inch below
 the riding surface. If any contradictions are found between these specifications and the manufacturer's
 recommendation, the latter will prevail.

 SECTION 625
 
 SECTION 625 – CONCRETE OVERLAYS
 625.01 Description.
 Furnish Materials and construct concrete overlay on concrete deck surfaces where shown in the Contract Documents
 or as directed by the Engineer.
 625.02 Materials. Provide Materials as specified in the following:
 Latex-Modified Concrete (LMC)
 
 Section 1046.01
 
 Microsilica-Modified Concrete (MSMC)
 
 Section 1046.02
 
 625.03 Construction. Submit for approval, a minimum of 5 years of documented history with experience in the use
 and placement of the intended overlay material. A manufacturer’s letter of certification as an approved installer may
 also be accepted. Qualifying personnel must oversee all operations.
 
 A. Latex-Modified or Microsilica-Modified Concrete
 1.
 
 Pre-placement Meeting
 a.
 
 Schedule a pre-placement meeting with the Engineer at least 15 Days in advance of placing the
 overlay. The meeting will discuss the plan and procedure for the Work and will acceptably
 establish the Contractor’s ability to place the overlay on a continuous basis and to consolidate,
 finish, texture, and commence curing within the time intervals specified. If placement of the
 overlay is to be made at night, the meeting will also discuss the Contractor’s plan to provide
 adequate lighting for the work area.
 
 b.
 
 Submit to the Engineer for review and conformance, all Equipment to be used for surface
 preparation, mixing, placing, and finishing the latex- or microsilica-modified concrete prior to the
 pre-placement meeting. This Equipment includes the following:
 i. Power-driven scarifier;
 ii. Chipping hammers (maximum nominal 15 pound class);
 iii. Abrasive blaster;
 iv. Overlay mixer-trucks (MSMC only);
 v. Proportioning and mixing Equipment (LMC only);
 vi. Mechanical fogger; and
 vii. Finishing machine.
 
 c.
 
 Use an approved finishing machine complying with Section 610.03(E)(4)(c)(i) and having a
 vibrating pan to properly consolidate the mix.
 
 d.
 
 For latex modified concrete use proportioning and mixing Equipment that is a self-contained,
 mobile, continuous mixing-type subject to the following:
 i. The mixer must be self-propelled and be capable of carrying sufficient unmixed dry, bulk
 cement, sand, coarse aggregate, latex modifier, and water to produce on the site not less than 6
 cubic yards of modified Portland Cement Concrete.
 ii. The mixer must be capable of positive measurement of cement being introduced into the mix. A
 recording meter must be visible at all times, and equipped with a ticket print-out to indicate the
 quantity.
 iii. The mixer must provide positive control of the flow of water and latex emulsion into the mixing
 chamber. Water flow must be indicated by a flow meter and be readily adjustable to provide for
 minor variations in the moisture of the sand and aggregate.
 
 625 - 1
 
 CONCRETE OVERLAYS
 
 SECTION 625
 
 iv. The mixer must be capable of being calibrated to automatically proportion and blend all
 components of indicated composition on a continuous or intermittent basis as required by the
 finishing operation, and it must discharge mixed material through a conventional chute directly
 in front of the finishing machine.
 v. The mixer must be capable of spraying water over the entire placement width as it moves ahead
 to insure that the surface to be overlaid is wetted prior to receiving the latex concrete.
 vi. The mixer must be calibrated to accurately proportion the specified mix. Certification of the
 calibration by an approved testing laboratory or by the Department will be accepted as evidence
 of this accuracy if the yield is shown to be true within a tolerance of 1.0 percent according to the
 following test:
 A) With the cement meter set on zero and all controls set for the desired mix, activate the
 mixer discharging mixed Material into a 0.25 cubic yard container – 36 inches x 36 inches
 x 9 inches.
 When the container is level-struck full, making provision for settling the Material into all
 corners, the cement meter must show a discharge of 1.875 bags of cement.
 2.
 
 3.
 
 Surface Preparation
 a.
 
 For decks and approach slabs with existing overlays, mill off the existing overlay. After this initial
 removal, sound the deck and outline areas of unsound concrete for removal, subject to the
 approval of the Engineer. Removal and repair Work below the initial milling will be measured
 and paid for under their respective pay Items. On any bridge decks or approach slabs where a hot
 mix surface is removed and no additional concrete milling is specified, scarify the exposed
 concrete surface an additional 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch in depth to remove all hot mix laitance prior to
 sounding the concrete as specified above and final cleaning as specified below.
 
 b.
 
 Thoroughly shot-blast or grit-blast the areas to receive the overlay not more than 24 hours before
 placement begins. Blast-clean the edge of any previously placed lanes of overlay to remove the
 trowel-cut surfacing to promote bond. If necessary to remove rust, oil, or other foreign materials
 detrimental to achieving bond, detergent-cleaning followed by shot- or grit-blasting and air-blastcleaning may be performed.
 
 c.
 
 Immediately prior to placement of concrete, thoroughly hose down the clean surface with water
 and keep wet for a period of at least one hour for latex-modified concrete and at least six hours for
 microsilica-modified concrete. Use compressed air, free of oil, to blow out any standing water in
 depressions, holes, or areas of concrete removal. Take all necessary precautions with the deck
 preparations to ensure a good bond with the overlay.
 
 d.
 
 Saw straight and vertical edges to transverse and longitudinal joints of previously placed overlay
 before overlay is placed against them.
 
 e.
 
 Prevent contamination of the cleaned and wetted deck by placing a clean 4 mil (minimum) thick
 polyethylene film (or other covering as approved by the Engineer) that completely covers the
 surface of the deck to be overlaid.
 
 Limitations of Placing Overlay Concrete
 a.
 
 The Contractor is responsible for the quality of the concrete placed in any weather or atmospheric
 conditions. A smooth, durable riding surface of uniform texture, true to the required grade and
 cross-section, must be obtained on all Bridge decks.
 
 b.
 
 Do not place the overlay concrete when rain is forecast within the intended working period. Make
 adequate preparations to provide protection of the freshly placed overlay in the event of sudden or
 unexpected rain. If rain occurs during placing of the overlay, immediately cease all operations
 other than protection of the already placed overlay. Replace Materials damaged by the rain at no
 additional cost to the Department.
 
 625 - 2
 
 CONCRETE OVERLAYS
 
 4.
 
 SECTION 625
 
 c.
 
 Place the overlay concrete only when the local ambient temperature is above 45 degrees
 Fahrenheit for the entire curing period. Do not place the overlay if the ambient air temperature is
 85 degrees Fahrenheit or higher or predicted to go above 85 degrees Fahrenheit during the overlay
 placement regardless of the surface evaporation rate. The overlay concrete must not exceed 85
 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
 d.
 
 Place the overlay concrete only if the overlay surface evaporation rate, as affected by ambient air
 temperature, concrete temperature, relative humidity, and wind velocity, is 0.15 pounds per square
 foot per hour or less. Determine and document the atmospheric conditions, subject to verification
 by the Engineer. Use the chart contained in “Plastic Cracking of Concrete” by Delmar Bloem for
 the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association and published in ACI 305 to determine the loss
 of surface moisture for the overlay. The chart may be obtained from the Department’s Materials
 and Research Section.
 
 e.
 
 Do not place an overlay adjacent to a previous overlay that has cured for less than 3 cure-days.
 
 Mixing of Materials
 a.
 
 Latex-Modified Concrete
 i. Mix the latex-modified concrete in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 1046.
 ii. Thoroughly mix the overlay concrete in an approved, thoroughly clean mixer at the site. Add
 the accurately proportioned ingredients to the mixer in accordance with the recommendations of
 the manufacturer of the latex modifier.
 iii. Do not place into the mix, bags or other containers holding ingredients, including those
 identified by the manufacturer as dissolving or breaking up during mixing.
 iv. Use minimum mixing time to secure the air content and slump desired, and in accordance with
 the recommendations of the manufacturer of the latex modifier.
 v. The overlay concrete must be uniform in composition and consistency when discharged from
 the mixer. Mixing capacity must be such that finishing operations can proceed at a steady pace
 with final finishing operations completed before the formation of the plastic surface film.
 
 b.
 
 Microsilica-Modified Concrete
 i. Centrally batch the overlay and mix in a central mixing plant or by mixer-trucks capable of
 producing a workable mixture of uniform composition and consistency. Use batching and
 mixing Equipment in accordance with Section 1022.
 ii. Introduce admixtures into the concrete in such a manner that will disperse them throughout the
 entire load.
 iii. Limit the mixer-truck charge to a maximum of 75 percent of its rated capacity or to 6 cubic
 yards, whichever is smaller.
 iv. Do not place into the mix, bags or other containers holding ingredients, including those
 identified by the manufacturer as dissolving or breaking up during mixing.
 v. Air entrainment and slump of the first Material delivered to the deck will be determined by the
 Engineer. Do not place the overlay until acceptability of the production has been verified.
 
 5.
 
 Placement
 a.
 
 Place overlay concrete in accordance with Section 610. The maximum overlay thickness per lift is
 2-1/2 inches.
 
 b.
 
 The maximum time allowed between the start of mixing to the completion of discharge of the
 overlay concrete at the worksite is sixty minutes.
 
 c.
 
 For microsilica-modified concrete, do not exceed a maximum water-cement ratio of 0.40. Mix
 any admixture added at the job site a minimum of 5 minutes or 30 revolutions. After all
 625 - 3
 
 CONCRETE OVERLAYS
 
 SECTION 625
 
 components have been added, the slump range must be 6 inches ± 2 inches. If a slump loss occurs
 after mixing and before placement of the overlay, the charge may be "re-tempered" with the highrange, water-reducing admixture to restore plasticity; re-tempering with water will not be allowed.
 The slump and air content will be rechecked to ensure conformance to the Specifications. If the
 consistency of the charge after "re-tempering" is such as to cause segregation of the components,
 this will be cause for rejection of the load. The overlay Material must still be placed within the
 original 60-minute limitation or it will be rejected.
 
 6.
 
 7.
 
 d.
 
 Immediately before the overlay is placed, clean the concrete surfaces with an air-blast (oil-free),
 clear of any standing water, and then cover with a coating of bonding grout consisting of the
 overlay placed and brushed onto the deck. Remove the coarse aggregate from the deck. Place the
 overlay only when the existing deck is "surface dry." Scrub the grout onto surface-dry decks
 (surfaces that are dry enough to absorb some of the moisture from the grout with enough care to
 ensure that all surfaces are evenly covered and that excess grout will not collect in low areas).
 Apply the bonding grout for only a short distance in advance of the placement of the overlay.
 Reapplication is required when the grout dries prior to overlay placement.
 
 e.
 
 The maximum allowable time between the discharge and the final finishing of the overlay
 concrete is ten minutes.
 
 f.
 
 Install a construction dam or bulkhead in case of a major delay in the placement operation
 exceeding one hour in duration. During minor delays of one hour or less, the end of the placement
 may be protected from drying with several layers of wet burlap.
 
 g.
 
 If overlay concrete placement is stopped or delayed for a duration of 90 minutes or more,
 discontinue further placement until after a period of not less than 12 hours. This restriction does
 not prohibit continuation of placement provided a gap is left in the lane. The gap must be
 sufficient in length for the finishing machine to clear the previously placed overlay concrete.
 
 Consolidating and Finishing
 a.
 
 Immediately following application of the bonding grout, place the overlay, consolidate, and finish,
 with vibrating devices, to the grades shown in the Contract Documents. Spud vibration is
 required in deep pockets, edges, and adjacent to joint bulkheads. Hand-finishing with a float may
 be required along the edge of the pour or on small areas of repair. Edge-tooling is required at
 joints, except next to metal expansion dams, curbs, and previously placed lanes.
 
 b.
 
 Use a 10 foot straightedge to check the overlay directly behind the finishing machine and
 transversely along the edges of the overlay where hand-finishing is done. Immediately correct any
 irregularities exceeding 1/4 inch in 10 feet. Correct any ponding problem that is noted prior to
 Final Acceptance of the overlay, at no cost to the Department. Test the overlay concrete surface
 for smoothness in accordance with Section 610.
 
 c.
 
 For microsilica-modified concrete, if needed, a water fog may be applied by the use of mechanical
 fogging Equipment attached to the paving machine to achieve an atomized water mist/fog above,
 but not on, the surface of the overlay concrete. Discharge the water fog at high velocity by the
 airstream of the mist-blower. Do not use hand-pump sprayers for the spraying.
 
 Curing
 a.
 
 As soon as the finishing operation is completed and within twenty minutes after initial concrete
 discharge, cover the finished overlay surface with a layer of clean, fully wet, saturated burlap and
 with a 4 mil (minimum) thick white opaque polyethylene film. For a period of 7 cure-days (a
 cure-day is defined as a 24-consecutive-hour period of time), keep the burlap wet by the
 continuous application of water through soaker hoses. After the 7 day cure period, remove the
 polyethylene and burlap and apply curing compound in accordance with Section 610.

 CONCRETE OVERLAYS
 
 SECTION 625
 
 b.
 
 Maintain the temperature at the overlay surface above 35 degrees Fahrenheit until the curing
 period is completed. Any day during which the air temperature at the overlay surface falls below
 45 degrees Fahrenheit will not be counted as a cure-day.
 
 c.
 
 Seal or repair any cracking that occurs prior to opening to traffic in a manner approved by the
 Engineer at no cost to the Department. Sound the deck and remove and replace any delaminated
 areas at no cost to the Department.
 
 d.
 
 Texture the surface in accordance with Section 610.

 628.03 Construction. Submit for approval, a minimum of 5 years of documented history with experience in each of
 the respective repair and rehabilitation operations and use of any specific manufactured products being proposed. A
 manufacturer’s letter of certification as an approved installer may also be accepted. Qualifying personnel must
 oversee all repair and rehabilitation operations.
 At least ten (10) Days prior to the start of Work, conduct a meeting to brief the personnel performing the Work and
 the Engineer on the operations. Submit for review and comment, formal Meeting Minutes or Concrete Repair Work
 Plan to document the Contractor’s proposed means and methods discussed during the preconstruction meeting.
 A. Epoxy Injection
 1.
 
 Cracks shall be a minimum of 1/16 inch to a maximum of 1/4 inch wide. Install injection ports or tees
 spaced at 6 inches to 12 inches for vertical repairs and 6 inches to 18 inches for horizontal repairs, but
 in no case closer together than the thickness of the concrete member if full-depth penetration is
 desired. However, in certain cases, depth and spacing of holes at injection ports or tees can be
 established with due consideration of the crack widths and depths compatible with flow characteristics
 of the epoxy and injection pressure to ensure that no further damage will be done to the member being
 repaired.
 
 2.
 
 Set ports or tees in dust-free holes made either with vacuum drills or chipping hammers. After
 injection ports or tees have been inserted into the holes, seal all surface cracks in the area to be repaired
 with epoxy binder between ports to ensure retention of the pressure-injected epoxy within the confines
 of the member. Limit the application of epoxy binder to clean and dry surfaces and substrate
 temperatures to not less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit during epoxy application. Grind down the
 injection ports or tees flush with the exposed concrete surface once the epoxy binder hardens as per
 manufacturer’s recommendations. Provide a neat-looking concrete surface once the epoxy binder
 hardens, which may require grinding.
 
 3.
 
 Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for surface preparation, mixing of the components of the
 injection epoxy system, and all other works. If there is conflict between these Specifications and the
 manufacturer's recommendations, the latter will prevail.
 
 B. Deck, Approach Slab or Sidewalk Crack Sealing
 1.
 
 Become aware of and follow the Manufacturer’s safety precautions of all Materials and exercise
 appropriate measures. Equipment used for cleaning and preparing the surface areas and for the
 application of the crack sealer is subject to approval prior to their use.
 
 2.
 
 Prior to the application of the crack sealing Material, clean the concrete surfaces in accordance with the
 Manufacturer's recommendations. This will involve removal of all traces of dust, dirt, salt, grease, oil,
 curing compounds, waxes, asphalt, laitance, and all other foreign contaminants. Ensure that the
 
 628 - 1
 
 CONCRETE REPAIR AND REHABILITATION
 
 SECTION 628
 
 substrate is clean, sound, and free of surface moisture prior to application. Closely monitor the surface
 preparation to avoid any unnecessary surface damage. Surface preparation is subject to final approval
 by the Engineer.
 3.
 
 Apply the crack sealing Material within the ambient temperature range as recommended by the
 Manufacturer, when no rain is expected within a minimum of two hours following the application, and
 when there are no high winds that would cause an improper application. If rain has preceded the
 application, allow the surface to dry at least 24 hours before the application of the crack sealer begins.
 
 4.
 
 If excess sealing Material is on the surface after the crack sealing treatment has been completed, cover
 the area with a light broadcast of a dry sand meeting the requirements of Section 1003. Use only an
 amount of sand that is sufficient to absorb the excess Material. The time of sand broadcast shall be in
 accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation.
 
 5.
 
 Keep traffic off the treated surface until the crack sealing Material has been completely absorbed and
 the surface is dry in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation.
 
 6.
 
 Perform surface preparation and application of the crack sealing material so as not to endanger any
 private and/or public property, pedestrians, workmen, marine traffic, and vehicles on, beneath, or
 adjacent to the structure.
 
 C. Rout and Seal Cracks
 1.
 
 Do not proceed with installation of joint sealants under the following conditions:
 a.
 
 When ambient and substrate temperature conditions are outside limits permitted by joint sealant
 manufacturer or are below 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
 b.
 
 When joint substrates are wet.
 
 c.
 
 When joint widths are less than those allowed by joint sealant manufacturer for applications
 indicated.
 
 2.
 
 Examine joints indicated to receive sealant, with installer present, for compliance with requirements
 for joint configuration, profile, and other conditions affecting joint-sealant performance. Proceed with
 installation only after unsatisfactory conditions have been corrected and approved.
 
 3.
 
 Rout joints as per manufacturer’s recommendations, which include the recommended joint depth and
 width to be routed.
 
 4.
 
 After routing operations are complete and immediately prior to installing joint sealant, clean out joints
 to comply with joint sealant manufacturer’s written instructions and the following requirements:
 a.
 
 Remove all foreign material from joint substrate that could interfere with adhesion of joint sealant,
 including dust, paints (except for permanent, protective coatings tested and approved for sealant
 adhesion and compatibility by sealant manufacturer), oil, grease, waterproofing, water repellants,
 water, surface dirt, and frost.
 
 b.
 
 Clean porous joint substrate surfaces by brushing, grinding, blast-cleaning, mechanical abrading,
 or a combination of these methods to produce a clean, sound substrate capable of developing
 optimum bond with joint sealants. Remove loose particles from the above cleaning operations by
 vacuuming or blowing out joints with oil-free compressed air.
 
 5.
 
 Prime joint substrates as per the joint sealant manufacturer’s recommendations, based on
 preconstruction joint sealant substrate tests, or prior experience. Apply a primer to comply with joint
 sealant manufacturer’s recommendations. Confine primers to areas of joint sealant bond; do not allow
 spillage or migration onto adjoining surfaces.
 
 6.
 
 Install joint sealant in according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the following:
 a.
 
 Place sealants so they directly contact and fully wet joint substrates.
 
 b.
 
 Completely fill recesses provided for each joint configuration.
 
 c.
 
 Produce uniform, cross-sectional shapes and depths relative to joint widths that allow optimum
 
 628 - 2
 
 CONCRETE REPAIR AND REHABILITATION
 
 SECTION 628
 
 sealant movement capability.
 7.
 
 Immediately after sealant application and before skinning or curing begins, tool non-sag sealant
 according to the following requirements to form smooth, uniform beads of configuration indicated, to
 eliminate air pockets, and to ensure contact and adhesion of sealant with sides of joint:
 a.
 
 Remove excess sealants from surfaces adjacent to joint.
 
 b.
 
 Use tooling agents that are approved in writing by sealant manufacturer and that do not discolor
 sealants or adjacent surfaces.
 
 c.
 
 Provide concave joint configuration per Figure 5A in ASTM C1193, unless otherwise indicated.
 
 8.
 
 Clean off excess sealants or sealant smears adjacent to joints as the work progresses by methods and
 cleaning materials approved in writing by manufacturers of joint sealants and of products in which
 joints occur.
 
 9.
 
 Protect joint sealants during and after curing period from contact with contaminating substances and
 from damage resulting from construction operations or other causes so sealants are without
 deterioration or damage at time of Substantial Completion. If, despite such protection, damage or
 deterioration occurs, cut out and remove damaged or deteriorated joint sealants immediately so
 installations with repaired areas are indistinguishable from the original work. This removal and
 reinstallation shall be at no additional cost to the Department.
 
 D. Repair of Existing Grout
 1.
 
 Section 628.03(D) applies to the repair of non-shrink grout used to fill shear keys between precast
 concrete elements or various pockets and voids associated with precast concrete elements.
 
 2.
 
 Remove deteriorated grout in accordance with Section 628.03(E)(4). Take care not to damage the
 adjacent precast concrete elements. Repair any damage to sound precast concrete in accordance with
 Section 628.03(E) and at no cost to the Department.
 
 3.
 
 After removal of deteriorated grout is complete, clean concrete surface in accordance with Section
 628.03(E)(5).
 
 4.
 
 Wet the concrete surfaces prior to placement of grout. Do not allow any standing water to remain in
 the area to receive grout. During grout placement, prevent any falling Material from reaching the
 roadway, waterway, or railroad area below. Prepare, place, and cure in accordance with the
 manufacturer’s recommendations.
 
 E. Spall and Delamination Repair
 1.
 
 Shallow spalls are defined as patches that do not extend below the top mat of reinforcement. Deep
 spalls are defined as patches that extend below the top mat of reinforcement. Rehabilitation of PCC
 masonry is defined as deep-spall patches that exceed the 1.0 cubic yard threshold in a single area.
 Section 628.03(E) does not apply to elements that are prestressed or whose performance relies
 primarily on post-tensioning.
 
 2.
 
 Submit for review and approval, details for deep spall repair or rehabilitation of locations under water
 or within the splash zone.
 
 3.
 
 Saw cut the edges of the area to be repaired back sharp, perpendicular to the face of the concrete to at
 least 1 inch deep, taking care not to damage any reinforcing bars. The saw cut area must be squared
 with a minimum of a 6-inch buffer between the saw cut and the visibly spalled, disintegrated,
 delaminated, deteriorated, loose, and/or honeycombed concrete.
 
 4.
 
 Remove all spalled, disintegrated, delaminated, deteriorated, loose, and honeycombed concrete.
 Collect all debris and prevent any falling Material from reaching the roadway, waterway, or railroad
 area below. All removed material shall become the property of the Contractor and shall be removed
 from the site and disposed in accordance with Section 106.08.
 a.
 
 For shallow spall, remove to above the top of the reinforcement bar. Use a 15 pound pneumatic
 628 - 3
 
 CONCRETE REPAIR AND REHABILITATION
 
 SECTION 628
 
 hammer unless otherwise noted in the Contract Documents. Alternative tools will be permitted
 upon approval by the Engineer. Do not remove concrete below top of reinforcement unless
 approved by the Engineer.
 b.
 
 For deep spall and rehabilitation of Portland Cement concrete masonry, remove to a sound
 concrete surface to a minimum of 1 inch behind the existing reinforcement. Take care not to
 damage the existing reinforcement. Use a 15 pound pneumatic hammer for the superstructure or a
 30 pound pneumatic hammer for the substructure unless otherwise noted in the Contract
 Documents. Alternative tools will be permitted upon approval by the Engineer. Limit removal at
 any one location as noted in the Contract Documents and as the Engineer deems necessary due to
 field conditions. If due to field conditions, removal of deteriorated concrete includes any bearing
 seat not specified in the Contract Documents or any area meeting the threshold for rehabilitation
 of Portland Cement concrete masonry not specified in the Contract Documents, notify the
 Engineer immediately. Do not resume Work in these areas until approval has been obtained from
 the Engineer.
 
 5.
 
 Clean and prepare the concrete surface area in accordance with the manufacturer specifications.
 
 6.
 
 For deep spall and rehabilitation of Portland Cement concrete masonry, in case of damaged rebar due
 to construction activities, lap-splice, cut, and mechanically splice, or replace the damaged rebar with a
 new bar of the same size. Ensure the ends are lapped or mechanically coupled to the ends of the
 existing rebar to the satisfaction of the Engineer. There will be no separate payment for such Work,
 and the cost will be included in the Item. Refer to Section 628.03(E)(7) for further guidance on type
 and size of the new rebars, minimum lap/splice lengths, and any necessary modifications to the limits
 of the repair area.
 
 7.
 
 For deep spall and rehabilitation of Portland Cement concrete masonry, clean to bright metal (black
 bars only) or visible epoxy coating (epoxy-coated bars only) by removing rust, coatings, or any foreign
 material using grit-blast, wire-brushing, or other approved means. Apply epoxy coating at all areas of
 the existing epoxy-coated reinforcing steel that exhibits flaked or scratched surfaces. Care must be
 taken not to epoxy-coat the concrete surface beyond the bars. It is not necessary to coat existing black
 bars. Place new epoxy-coated reinforcement bars to supplement an existing reinforcement bar when
 an existing bar has a section loss of 20 percent or more of the original cross section, as determined by
 the Engineer, or when the existing reinforcement bar is broken. Use new bar of the same crosssectional area as the existing bar and extend 30 bar diameters in each direction from where the section
 loss or breaks ends. Dual bars of equivalent or greater section may be used. The Engineer will be the
 sole judge as to which bars are in need of repairs. Where the bond between existing concrete and
 reinforcing steel has been destroyed, remove the concrete adjacent to the bar to a depth that will permit
 concrete to bond to the entire periphery of the bar so exposed. Exercise care to prevent cutting,
 deforming, or damaging any exposed reinforcing steel. Modify the limits of the repair area to meet the
 reinforcement splice lap or mechanical coupler requirements.
 
 8.
 
 All operations, including, but not limited to, the surface preparation, mortar application, and
 restrictions of the mortar prepared for repair Work, will conform to the manufacturer's
 recommendations. The finish of the repaired area shall match the existing concrete surfaces and
 architectural details. Make the depth of repair as noted in the Contract Documents; however, such
 dimension may change in field if the Engineer deems it necessary.
 
 9.
 
 For shallow spall repairs, apply the patch mortar in lifts of no more than 2 inches or as recommended
 by the manufacturer. Hand-trowel the top application of patch mortar to obtain a smooth, final surface.
 
 10. For deep spall and rehabilitation of Portland Cement concrete masonry, apply concrete in accordance
 with Section 610.
 a.
 
 For deep spall, pneumatically applied mortar and quick setting Material may be substituted for
 Class A mix design upon approval of the Engineer with an exception of bridge seat areas. Use
 Class A Concrete, or approved equal, for any spall depths greater than 6 inches.
 
 628 - 4
 
 CONCRETE REPAIR AND REHABILITATION
 
 SECTION 628
 
 b.
 
 For rehabilitation of Portland Cement concrete masonry, use Class A Concrete or approved equal.
 
 c.
 
 Apply an approved bonding agent to the existing concrete prior to placing concrete when using
 Class A concrete.
 
 d.
 
 Do not allow concrete to drop from the top of the forms that could otherwise result in the
 separation of the mix. Use only approved mixing and placing Equipment in the preparation and
 handling of the concrete. Remove all oil and other rust-inhibitors from all Equipment in contact
 with the concrete before the mixes are used.
 
 11. For deep spall and rehabilitation of Portland Cement concrete masonry, if present, expansion or
 contraction joints are to be formed in the concrete repair Material at the location of the existing joints.
 
 F. Deck Repair
 1.
 
 Section 628.03(F) applies to deck repairs of a concrete riding surface or of a milled concrete surface
 that will receive an overlay.
 
 2.
 
 Incorporate in the Concrete Repair Work Plan the means and methods intended for protecting and
 curing the patches. When Contract time constraints do not permit curing times as specified in Section
 610, the Contractor's plan must also detail what methods and/or Materials he/she will use to attain the
 necessary early strength and open it to traffic in a timely manner.
 
 3.
 
 Take precautions to assure that traffic is protected from rebound, dust, and construction activities.
 Provide appropriate shielding as required and directed by the Engineer.
 
 4.
 
 Before any patching is commenced, the Engineer will inspect the entire deck surface or, when a mill
 and overlay is utilized, the entire exposed portion of the deck surface, and indicate the type and extent
 of repair, if any, that is to be made.
 
 5.
 
 Saw cut in accordance to Section 628.03(E)(3) except that the minimum depth of vertical face will be
 1/2 inch. Keep areas from which unsound concrete has been removed free of slurry produced by
 additional wet sawing of concrete. Plan Work so that this slurry will drain away from all open areas.
 Remove all such slurry from prepared areas before patch is placed.
 
 6.
 
 Remove deteriorated areas of deck down to sound concrete in accordance to Section 628.03(E)(4). Do
 not operate mechanical chipping tools at an angle in excess of 45 degrees measured from the surface of
 the deck.
 
 7.
 
 When the depth of removal of an existing concrete deck spanning over a roadway, waterway, or
 railroad reaches 1/2 of the existing concrete deck thickness and deeper removal is anticipated, furnish
 and erect temporary protective Structures under the deck to prevent any falling Material from reaching
 the roadway, waterway, or railroad area below.
 
 8.
 
 After removal of deteriorated concrete is complete, clean concrete surface in accordance with Section
 628.03(E)(5).
 
 9.
 
 Refer to Section 628.03(E)(6) for further guidance in an event of damaged rebar due to construction
 activities.
 
 10. Refer to Section 628.03(E)(7) for further guidance on any necessary cleaning of existing reinforcement
 and the need to repair or replace existing reinforcement.
 11. Patch spalled concrete, voids, and other defects in accordance with the following:
 a.
 
 For cavities less than 1/2 inch in depth on milled surfaces, no special treatment of cavity is
 required.
 
 b.
 
 For cavities less than 1/2 inch in depth on riding surfaces, chip down the perimeter of the patch so
 that a 1/2 inch minimum depth vertical face from the top of the adjacent deck surface exists and
 fill the space with epoxy grout.
 
 c.
 
 For cavities 1/2 inch to 1 inch in depth, fill the space with epoxy grout.
 
 628 - 5
 
 CONCRETE REPAIR AND REHABILITATION
 
 SECTION 628
 
 d.
 
 For cavities 1 inch to 3 inches in depth, Contractor has the option of using epoxy grout or Class D
 mix concrete. If epoxy grout is used, place patch in layers not to exceed 1-1/2 inches in depth.
 Contractor may use one or more of any patching Material specified, provided that the total depth
 of each patch is made with only one type of patch Material.
 
 e.
 
 In areas where the depth of removal of deck material is over 3 inches in depth, place Class D
 concrete up to the concrete deck surface.
 
 12. When the deck is to receive an overlay, shot- or grit-blast the surfaces of patches repaired with epoxy
 grout to assure proper bonding with the overlay. For riding surface repairs, apply a broom or hand-tine
 finish.
 G. Drilling Holes and Placing Dowels
 1.
 
 Drill holes at the locations and to the minimum depth shown in the Contract Documents. Drill hole
 diameters in accordance with the epoxy grout manufacturer's recommendations considering the size(s)

 SECTION 707 – RIPRAP
 707.01 Description. Prepare the bedding areas, furnish and place dry, pre-mixed, bagged riprap and stone riprap
 in accordance with the Contract Documents and as directed by the Engineer.
 707.02 Materials.
 Provide Materials as specified in:
 Bagged Riprap
 
 Section 1030
 
 Stone
 
 Section 1006
 
 Geotextile
 
 Section 1060
 
 707.03 Construction Methods.
 707.03.1 Pre-Sacked Concrete Riprap. If not installed the same day of delivery, protect the pre-sacked concrete
 riprap from moisture by a waterproof covering such as polyethylene. Prior to installation, replace bags rejected by
 the Department containing Material which has begun to hydrate due to prolonged storage, inadequate protection, or
 other causes at no additional cost to the Department.
 Place pre-sacked riprap on slopes for protection in accordance with the Contract Documents. Place so the bagged
 riprap has staggered joints, in a regular pattern, and tamped into place to cause them to conform to the prepared
 slope and to adjacent bags in place. Remove and replace any bags ripped or torn with sound, unbroken bags.
 Thoroughly wet the bagged riprap by hosing, sprinklers, or other approved methods capable of providing sufficient
 water to saturate the entire installation and initiate the cement hydration process. When multiple courses are
 specified, thoroughly wet each new course of bagged riprap before the next course is placed. In multi-level
 construction, ensure all joints are clean, and intimate bag to bag contact is provided to ensure good bonding.
 Avoid disturbing the placed bags until the concrete has sufficiently set. During hot and dry weather, additional
 water curing may be required to sustain the hydration process.
 707.03.2 Stone Riprap. Place riprap to the dimensions and at the locations shown on the Plans or as established
 by the Engineer.
 Excavate the area for placement of the stone riprap to the required placement depth in accordance with the Contract
 Documents.
 Properly prepare the placement area to a relatively smooth condition, free from large stone, vegetation, debris, and
 areas of soft material. Preparation of the area may include, but is not limited to, excavating, removing unsuitable
 material, backfilling, placing Embankment and clearing and grubbing.
 Install geotextile in accordance with Section 708 and the Contract Documents.
 Carefully place the riprap on the geotextile to produce an even distribution of pieces, with a minimum of voids and
 without tearing the geotextile. Place the riprap to the full-course thickness in a manner which prevents segregation
 of stone sizes and which prevents displacement of underlying Material. If necessary, rearrange individual stones
 to ensure a uniform distribution.
 707.04 Method of Measurement. The quantity of pre-sacked concrete riprap will be measured as the actual
 number of cubic yards of riprap incorporated into the finished construction and accepted.
 The quantity of stone riprap will be measured as either the actual number of square yards, cubic yards or the actual
 number of tons of riprap for each class placed and accepted. If stone riprap is measured by the square yard, the
 quantity will be determined by computations based on field measurements taken on and along the completed
 finished surfaces (no horizontal projection) and the specified placement thickness for the class. If stone riprap is
 measured by the ton, the weight will be determined as specified in Section 109.01.
 707.05 Basis of Payment. The quantity of pre-sacked concrete riprap is paid for at the Contract Unit Price per
 cubic yard. The quantity of stone riprap is paid for at the Contract Unit Price per square yard, cubic yard or ton.
 Price and payment will constitute full compensation for excavating and preparing the bedding areas if applicable;

 for water service shut-downs and tie-ins.
 If necessary, furnish, install, and remove bypass and temporary services pipes to maintain water service to customers
 during the Work. Furnishing, installing services and other branches, maintaining, providing safety precautions and
 removal of temporary services is the responsibility of the Contractor. Use only the highest quality service pipe,
 connections and branches that are able to withstand 150 pounds per square inch pressures and all conditions of use.
 Ensure that all pipes and fittings are watertight and that care is exercised throughout the installation to avoid
 pollution of mains, hose services or temporary service pipe.
 Place temporary service pipe in the gutters where possible. Provide pipe crossings at driveways with cold patch
 cover or other methods approved by the Engineer. At street crossings, place temporary pipe in shallow trenches
 covered with temporary surfacing or other methods approved by the Engineer. Use sanitary precautions that are
 satisfactory to both the Engineer and the Owner. Chlorinate the interior of temporary service pipe in accordance
 with the latest AWWA Manual C601-81 “AWWA Standard for Disinfecting Water Mains”. Chlorine and bacteria
 testing will be performed by the Owner’s inspector.
 The Owner and the Engineer retain the sole right of determining the times that the Work can occur and the sequence
 of the Work. Do not begin Work until both the Owner and the Engineer grant permission to proceed. Notify the
 Owner a minimum of forty-eight (48) hours before beginning Work to allow the Owner to arrange inspection.
 Immediately notify both the Engineer and the Owner of all delays to the scheduled Work.
 It is of prime importance that the Contractor, in the performance of the Work, does not disrupt the operation of the
 existing water facilities in any manner or at any time, without the expressed prior approval of the Owner. Construct,
 disinfect, maintain and remove, following construction, such temporary water bypasses as may be required during

 customer water service.
 Shutdowns are not permitted if tapping sleeves and valves are specified for making the connections. Any and all
 emergency repairs required are the responsibility of the Contractor. Upon notification via telecommunication from
 the Owner, attend to any repairs immediately. In the event the Owner is unable to contact the Contractor or the
 Contractor fails to make the emergency repairs in a length of time determined by the Owner, the Owner reserves the
 right to attend to any or all emergency repair work. In such a case, the Contractor is responsible for reimbursements
 due to the Owner for the costs of the repairs.
 Remove and replace or repair all Materials and Work, or parts thereof, which are deemed unsatisfactory as to any or
 all requirements of the Owner or the Engineer or as specified herein, at no expense to the State or the Owner.
 Guarantee all workmanship, Materials and Work performed is in strict accordance with the Contract Documents, for
 a period of two years from and after the date of Completion and Acceptance of the Work. Repair, correct or replace
 as required, promptly and without charge, all Work, Equipment and Material, or parts thereof, which fail to meet the
 above guarantee, or which in any way fail to comply with or fail to be in strict accordance with the terms, provisions
 and requirements of the Contract during such two-year period.
 710.03.2 Excavation.
 Perform excavation and trenching in accordance with Section 207, except as amended by this Section. Excavate
 pipe trenches so that the bottoms of the trenches are flat and will provide bearing for the full length of pipes placed
 in them. Excavate trenches so that the elevations of water pipes and fittings placed in the trenches match the
 elevations provided in the Contract Documents. Excavate trenches for water service connections to the minimum
 standard depth required by the Owner’s specifications or to such depth as required to connect to existing mains or
 service pipes.
 The Engineer and the Owner will have the right to limit the amount of trench opened in advance of pipe to be
 placed, and the amount of pipe placed in advance of backfilling. Upon demand by either the Owner or the Engineer,
 immediately refill open trenches as directed. Claims for extra compensation due to immediate demands for
 backfilling, even if such backfilling compels the Contractor to temporarily stop other Work, will not be considered.
 If the Contractor stops Work on any trench or excavation for any reason and the excavation is left open for an
 unreasonable length of time (in the opinion of the Engineer) in advance of construction, refill such trench or
 excavation at the Contractor’s expense at no extra cost to the Owner or the State. Do not re-excavate the trench until
 the Engineer determines that the Contractor is ready and able to progress the Work.
 Where rock is encountered within the proposed limits of a water main trench, remove the rock in accordance with
 Section 202.03.6, except as modified herein, and excavate an additional six inches below grade. After the
 excavation is complete, place a bed of Borrow Type C six inches in depth at the bottom of the trench. Level off and
 thoroughly tamp the bed. If blasting is required to remove the rock, perform blasting operations in accordance with
 Section 107.08.
 710.03.3 Installation.
 Adjust, relocate, repair or install new water services and appurtenances of the sizes and to the lines in accordance

 Carefully handle and lower pipes and fittings into the trench. Take special care to ensure that all pipes are well
 bedded on solid foundations. Repair any defects due to settlement at the Contractor’s expense.
 Where the manufacturer's recommended pipe joint deflection is exceeded, place mechanical joint bends to realign
 the pipe to the satisfaction of the Owner and the Engineer at the Contractor’s expense.
 Use thrust blocks made of Portland Cement Concrete, Class B to secure all fittings and all bends equal to or greater
 than 11-1/4 degrees. Use thrust blocks of adequate size and weight to resist the force of water pressure and water
 hammer. Thrust blocks must be used unless the Owner’s specifications or the Contract Documents permit a
 different method to secure the fittings. All methods used to secure fittings, including, but not limited to, thrust
 blocks, couplings and service saddles are incidental to the fittings and no separate payment will be made for this
 Work.
 Do not place pipe on a frozen foundation or if frost is likely to penetrate the bottom of an excavation. Keep all
 excavations free from water or other liquids during the progress of the Work. Excavate and backfill trenches per the
 applicable requirements of Section 207. Remove all excess Material in accordance with Section 106.08.
 710.03.4 Pressure Testing.
 Conduct pressure tests per the specifications of the Owner. Upon completion of the relocated/new water services,
 adequately plug the ends of the line and charge the line to 150 pounds per square inch. The maximum allowable
 leakage is in accordance with AWWA C605. Install any taps required at high points on the line to expel trapped air
 prior to testing. Following the tests, tightly plug all taps with suitable threaded brass plugs.
 Water for testing purposes will be furnished by the Owner. Furnish and install adequate pumping and gauging
 Equipment to develop the required hydrostatic pressure and to measure the pressure and amount of water lost by
 leakage. Perform pressure test(s) with a duration not less than two (2) hours. Repair all visible leaks regardless of
 total leakage shown by test.
 If inspections or tests show defects, including visible leaks, replace such defective Work or Material at the expense
 of the Contractor and repeat the inspection and tests. Make all repairs using new Material. Failure to meet the
 requirements of the tests specified above will be sufficient cause to reject the Work until the defects are
 satisfactorily repaired. All expenses and costs incurred in carrying out the specified tests are borne by the
 Contractor, at no extra cost to the Owner or to the State, and included in the Contract Unit Price per linear foot bid
 for the various sizes of installing water services.
 710.03.5 Sterilization of Main, Line, Laterals and Accessories.
 Prior to the final connection of the newly installed pipe into the existing water main, and with the plugs used in the
 pressure test still in place on the installed pipe, sterilize the entire installed system using one of the procedures as
 specified in AWWA Standard C601-81 and as required by the Owner.
 Provide an adequate blowoff for use in flushing of the main. Before the water is turned on for use by the consumer
 from the relocated mains, the Owner will conduct bacteriological tests on water samples taken from the blowoff.
 All expenses incurred in the performance of these tests by the Owner are borne by the Contractor. Upon final
 sanitary approval by the Owner, return water service for use by the consumer.
 Before the final connection is made, thoroughly clean all surfaces of the relocated line, including all gaskets and
 glands, and the existing water main that are to become part of the closing joint with a 5 percent solution of Sodium
 Hypochlorite. Exercise extreme care in order to prevent the entrance of any contaminants into the main.
 All expenses and cost incurred in carrying out the specified sterilization work is borne by the Contractor at no extra
 cost to the Owner or the State and is included in the Contract Unit Price per linear foot bid for the Item for the
 various sizes.
 Abandoning and/or Removing Existing Water Mains – Remove and dispose of all existing water mains which are to

 Contract Documents and the requirements of the standards and specifications of the owner of the Utility (“Owner”).
 In cases of conflict between the Contract Documents and the standards and specifications of the Owner; the
 standards and specifications of the Owner will govern the Work.
 711.02 Materials.
 Use Materials specified in the Contract Documents and as specified by the Owner’s standard specifications. The
 Owner will have right to inspect Materials and reject any Materials that do not meet the applicable standards and
 specifications.
 Provide all Materials to complete the Work including pipe, fittings and all other appurtenances necessary to make
 permanent connections to existing utility facilities of whatever material type encountered.
 Use printed polyethylene plastic warning tape for sanitary sewer or force main with a metallic core, manufactured
 specifically for identifying buried utility lines. Use tape of a roll type, 6 inch minimum width and color coded for
 sewer (green) with warning and identification imprinted in bold black letters continuously and repeatedly over the
 entire length of the tape. Use code and letter color that is permanent and unaffected by moisture and other
 substances contained in trench backfill Materials. Imprint "Sanitary Sewer" on the tape or a similar message
 approved by the Engineer.

 SECTION 722
 
 adjustments for reduced dynamic deflection. Coordinate with the Engineer to review plan details and required
 adjustments needed prior to ordering the cable.
 Align and locate the cable barrier system in accordance with the Plans and manufacturer recommendations. The
 Contractor is responsible for all construction stake out for the line posts and end terminals. Notify the Engineer of
 any potential conflicts with underground utilities or drainage prior to construction. The Engineer may require the
 Contractor to excavate test pits to determine the exact location and depth of any existing utility that may conflict the
 proposed alignment of the high tension cable barrier system. The Contractor may need to adjust post spacing to
 avoid the conflicts with existing features and/or utilities while maintaining a maximum deflection of eight (8) feet.
 Complete all clearing and grubbing and final grading prior to installation of each section of cable barrier post
 foundations, terminals, transitions or anchor system. If a bituminous pavement maintenance strip is required,
 complete final paving prior to excavation/drilling for post foundations.
 Construct all foundations using cast-in-place, reinforced concrete per the manufacturer’s specifications. Excavate a
 properly sized hole to the diameter and depth for socketed post and end terminal foundations per the manufacturer’s
 specifications. Design the depth based on the project’s existing soil boring data; however, the minimum diameter
 shall be 14 inches and the minimum depth shall be 48 inches. If over excavation is unavoidable, use extra concrete
 to completely fill the excavation. Otherwise, form, cast and backfill the foundations per Section 207. Dispose of
 excess excavated material. Install reinforcing steel in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications. Place the
 concrete and install sockets, ensuring that the top of the foundation is flush with the final grade. Install line posts
 and fitting gasket. Posts shall be of the type specified, spaced in accordance with the manufacturer’s details and
 specifications. Set posts plumb and in line to provide acceptable line of sight. Take extreme care to ensure proper
 wire rope height is obtained.
 Install cables in accordance with the manufacturer’s details and specifications. Position all rigging screws so that
 there is no interference with posts or other rigging screws unless recommended by the manufacturer. Upon
 installation, tension each cable in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications. Use certified, calibrated
 testing equipment specified by the manufacturer at the beginning of the installation and throughout the project.
 Results from only one model of tension testing device will be accepted. Provide a calibration certificate to the
 Engineer indicating calibration of the instrument no more than 30 days prior to its first use on the project. Furnish a
 letter from the manufacturer certifying the person testing is trained and authorized by the manufacturer to perform
 tension tests on the system. Retest the tension 14 to 21 Days after the initial testing in accordance with the
 manufacturer’s specifications. Re-tensioning will be required when the test reading is less than the manufacturer’s
 recommended tension for the given temperature. Re-tension the cables by successively reading tension
 measurements at every rigging screw or turnbuckle on each cable being adjusted to the manufacturer’s
 specifications. Repeat the testing and re-tension the cable as necessary until the manufacturer certifies that the full
 cable system has been installed and tensioned in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications. Any end
 terminal movement exceeding one inch (1”) within 12 months of completed installation that results in a tension
 reduction to the cable system shall require repair and re-tensioning of the system by the Contractor at no expense to
 the Department, as directed by the Engineer. Complete a tension log showing the project name, date, time, location,
 weather conditions, ambient temperature, cable temperature, tension measurement location, actual tension reading,
 tension reading after adjustment (if necessary), any applicable notes and the signature of the person conducting the
 test. Furnish a copy of this log to the Engineer along with a letter from the manufacturer certifying that the cable has
 been tensioned in accordance with their specifications and complies with the manufacturer’s tension requirements.
 Maintain the cable barrier system during construction until final acceptance of the project. Should the cable barrier
 be damaged by the traveling public during construction, notify the Engineer immediately. Mark the affected area as
 directed by the Engineer within eight (8) hours of the initial damage. If only line posts are damaged, replace the
 posts and re-install the cable to the posts within 48-hours of Contractor notification. If an end terminal is struck and
 the cables disengaged, the system must be repaired, re-tensioned and tested within 24-hours of Contractor
 notification. After each hit, the system shall be re-tensioned if required, in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 specifications. If the cable barrier system is damaged by the traveling public during construction, the Contractor
 will be paid for the repair at the unit bid price for the respective pay items. If the cable barrier is damaged by the
 Contractor, the barrier system will be repaired at the Contractor’s expense.

 Signs and Markings Section
 Attn: Traffic Operations Manager
 P.O. Box 778
 Dover, Delaware 19901
 a.
 
 5.
 6.
 7.
 
 8.
 
 The coefficients of retroreflection, RA, are not to be less than the minimum values specified in when tested
 in accordance with ASTM E 810.
 
 Have the sheeting manufacturer submit with each lot or shipment, a certification that states the Material
 supplied will meet all the requirements listed herein.
 The Department will date all signs at the time of application. That date constitutes the start of the field
 performance obligation period.
 The retroreflective sheeting will be considered unsatisfactory if it has deteriorated due to natural causes to
 the extent that: (1) the sign is ineffective for its intended purpose when viewed from a moving vehicle
 under normal day and night driving conditions; or (2) the coefficient of retroreflection is less than the
 minimum specified for that sheeting during that period listed below:
 a. 85% of values listed in Type IV after 10 years
 b. 80% of values listed in Type IX after 12 years.
 c. 80% of values listed in Type XI after 12 years.
 Natural causes include effects of exposure to weather. Natural causes exclude (without limitation) damage
 from exposure to chemicals, abrasion and other mechanical damage (such as from fasteners used to mount
 the sign, collisions or mishandling), vandalism, or malicious mischief.
 Where it can be shown that retroreflective signs supplied and used according to the sheeting manufacturer’s
 recommendations, have not met the performance requirements of this Specification, the sheeting
 manufacturer is responsible to cover restoration costs as follows for sheeting shown to be unsatisfactory
 during:
 a. The entire 12 years (Types IX and XI) and 10 years (Type IV): the sheeting manufacturer will replace
 the sign in its entirety inclusive of the sign panel, sign sheeting, labor, and temporary traffic control
 required to restore the sign surface to its original effectiveness.
 b. Non-reflective black Material that is used on the signs will carry the same warranty period and
 replacement obligation. This Material will be considered unsatisfactory if it has deteriorated due to
 natural causes to the extent that it is visibly cracked or has experienced shrinkage of more than 1/8 inch
 from the edge of the metal it is applied.

 818.03.4 Construction Methods.
 A. Sign Face Finishing
 1. Provide clean-cut, sharp messages for all retroreflective sheeting, backgrounds, letters, numerals, symbols,
 and borders on all signs as indicated on the Plans.
 2. After the sign panel has been degreased and etched, apply retroreflective sheeting to the aluminum panels
 in accordance with sheeting manufacturer's recommendations.
 a. Application of the sheeting is not permitted when the temperature is less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
 3. Employ the height of characters and the alphabet series for the signs in conformance to the Plans and their
 references.
 4. Use on the sign panels, alphabet series from the publication titled "Standard Alphabets for Highways
 Signs" of the Federal Highway Administration.
 5. Prepare Working Drawings that clearly indicate the proposed spacing of the letters and the locations and
 arrangements of symbols and borders.
 6. Whenever it is necessary to construct the background of a sign face with two or more pieces of
 retroreflective sheeting, they must be carefully matched for color prior to application and sign fabrication,
 to provide uniform appearance and brilliance, day and night. Rotate and mount 180 degrees with respect to
 that adjacent section each full width section of retroreflective sheeting taken consecutively from the same
 roll. Use this rule as a guide when partial width sheets of retroreflective sheeting are used.
 a. Non-conformance may result in non-uniform shading and an undesirable contrast between adjacent
 widths of applied sheeting which will render signs unacceptable.
 b. Provide a uniform color, brilliance, texture, and general appearance as seen in the daytime and under
 typical automobile illumination at night for the entire background of each sign.
 c. Use no more sections of retroreflective sheeting than is necessary for backgrounds.
 i. Remnants, scraps, and odd sized pieces of sheeting are not permitted for use in the fabrication of
 any signs.
 d. Either butt or overlap no more than 3/8 inch, joints between retroreflective sheeting. Horizontal joints
 between retroreflective sheeting sections are not permitted.
 B. Sign Panel Erection:
 1. Slip-sheet, pack, and ship signs in such manner as to ensure arrival at their respective places of erection in
 an undamaged condition.
 2. All signs arriving at the erection site(s) in a condition which in the opinion of the Engineer, renders them
 unsuitable for use, are to be removed and replaced by the Contractor at his sole expense.
 3. Do not ship sign panels for erection in such a manner that results in horizontal joints of the retroreflective
 sheeting.
 4. It is not anticipated that there will be any sign panels which are required to be mounted whose messages
 will be inappropriate to the guiding of traffic at the time of sign erection. However, in the event that the
 Engineer determines that certain sign messages are inappropriate, cover the panels of such signs with an
 opaque material, until such time as the sign messages become appropriate.
 a. Provide a covering Material and manner of securing the Material to the sign panel(s) that meets with
 the approval of the Engineer.
 b. The Engineer will indicate to the Contractor which signs, if any, must be covered, and when to remove
 the covers.
 5. Included with the sign panel will be connections to supports, other attaching hardware, and other
 incidentals as shown or described in the Contract Documents.
 6. Furnish and place identification tags or decals which state the Contract number, month and year of erection
 on the lower reverse side of the panel, near the point closest to the roadway shoulder.
 7. Erect the sign panel using approved methods of erection.
 8. Attached the sign panel to the sign Structure as required by the Plans and the approved shop drawings.
 C. Sign Panel Overlay Installation:
 1. Verify all panel overlay sizes in the field before fabrication of the overlays. Such field verification is
 considered as an incidental expense to this Item.
 2. Attach any logo to the sign panel overlay as specified on the Plans and as directed by the Engineer.

 818.04 Method of Measurement.
 The quantity of sign panels will be measured as the actual number of square feet of front sign face surface area of all
 sign panels constructed and accepted. The area will be computed from the maximum width and height dimensions
 of each sign panel, as shown on the Plans, or on the approved sign panel shop drawings, (verified by field
 measurements). All sign panels will be considered either square or rectangular in shape, as the case may be, and no
 area deductions will be made for rounding of corners.
 818.05 Basis of Payment.
 The quantity of sign panel will be paid for at the Contract Unit Price per square foot. Price and payment will
 constitute full compensation for furnishing and fabricating sign panels complete in place and accepted, with
 retroreflective Materials, copy, symbols, borders, and connections to supports where necessary, and for all labor,
 Materials, tools, Equipment, and incidentals required to complete the Item.
 If required by the Contract Documents, the cost of removing and transporting existing sign panels and accessories to
 the DelDOT Sign Shop is included under this Section unless otherwise indicated on the Plans.

 Contract Documents and as directed by the Engineer.
 When this Item is required to test a highway lighting system constructed as part of the Contract, include a one year
 warranty of the highway lighting system installed under the Contract. The highway lighting system includes all
 Items of Work performed under the Contract to provide lighting of roadways, bike paths, parking lots, etc.
 The highway lighting system is comprised of all Contract Items for lighting, including but not limited to conduits,
 junction wells, cables, load centers, transformers, cabinet pads, pole bases, poles, high mast poles, light standards
 with and without davit arms, luminaires, service installations and reworked/relocated existing lighting facilities.
 843.02 Materials. Not Applicable.
 843.03 Construction Methods.
 Perform all Work in conformance to the latest editions of the National Electrical Code (NEC), the National
 Electrical Safety Code (NESC), local utility company requirements, and state and local laws and ordinances
 governing the Work. Complete all Work under the direct supervision of a master electrician licensed in the State of
 Delaware. Submit a copy of the master electrician’s license to the Engineer for approval. Apply for, obtain and pay
 for all permits, licenses and inspections required by local regulation. All electrical installations must pass an
 electrical inspection by a Delaware-approved Licensed Electrical Inspection Agency.
 At least 30 Days prior to the commencement of each test, submit the types, styles, or catalog numbers of all required
 testing Equipment. Include a written certification stating when the testing Equipment was last calibrated. Ensure
 the calibration date is within 180 days of the date when the tests are to be performed. Perform all tests in the
 presence of the Engineer.
 843.03.1 Ground Resistance Testing.
 Measure ground resistance with a three-terminal, fall-of-potential, direct-reading, battery-powered earth tester with a
 0.50 to 500 ohm scale or digital read-out. Ensure the 25 ohm reading is approximately at mid-scale. Perform the
 test according to the manufacturer's instructions and OSHA requirements. Perform the test when the soil is dry. Do
 not add any chemical or salt solutions to any portion of the grounding system. Install all grounding rods and
 foundation grounds to be tested a minimum of ten days prior to testing unless otherwise determined by the Engineer
 in the field. Drive two auxiliary copper clad ground rods into the ground at a minimum distance of 3 feet. Provide
 the lateral spacing for each test rod in writing on the test report form and the spacing will be approved by the
 Engineer. Isolate each ground rod or foundation ground with the bond wires disconnected when the test is being
 performed. Ensure the resistance to ground is 25 ohms or less. Perform two ground resistance tests unless noted
 otherwise in the Contract Documents.
 843.03.2 System Testing.
 Perform all system testing for lighting installations by a third-party licensed master electrician in the State of
 Delaware.
 Test insulation from ground, roadway lighting, performance (burn-in) and illuminance circuits as follows:
 A. Insulation from Ground. Test all underground circuits for resistance to ground with a megger both before
 and after the conduit and wiring have been buried and all ground rods have been installed and connected.
 Circuit measurement readings less than 10 megaohms to ground are not acceptable. Inspect, repair and
 retest failing circuits.
 B. Roadway Lighting Circuits. Determine the insulation resistance on all cables of every circuit, except those
 installed in lighting structures. Cable insulation resistance measurement readings less than 10 megaohms at
 500 volts D.C. are not acceptable. If the insulation resistance test of any conductor is less than 10
 megaohms, locate the fault. If the fault is in a conductor between terminal connections, replace the
 
 843 - 1
 
 ELECTRICAL TESTING
 
 SECTION 843
 
 conductor. If the fault is at a terminal connection, repair or replace the terminal device. Removing water
 from the conduit of a fault circuit is not considered a repair. If a circuit fails the insulation resistance test
 and removing water allows the circuit to pass, replace the conductors and re-test the new circuit. Endure
 the duration of circuit testing and any re-test is at least one minute.
 Demonstrate to the Engineer that all conductors are continuous, free from short circuits and unspecified
 grounds, and that all circuits are properly connected.
 Take voltage readings, with load and without load, at the power supply side of the control cabinet main
 breaker. The readings with load must be within +/- 5 percent of nominal voltage. Take voltage readings at
 the last light of each circuit. A voltage reading is acceptable if it is within 5 percent of the reading with
 load at the supply point.
 Take current (ampere) readings with a full lighting load on the load side of each distribution breaker in the
 control cabinet. A current reading is acceptable if it does not exceed 80 percent of the breaker rating.
 C. Performance (burn-in). After all issues mentioned in previous tests have been addressed to the satisfaction
 of the Engineer, perform a 2 week burn-in test on the lighting system. The burn-in test consists of normal
 dusk-to-dawn operation of all lighting system control Equipment and apparatus to ensure function without
 interruption or failure. Conduct the burn-in test at the same time for all lights that are energized from the
 same utility company service point. Burn-in test of individual circuits or groups of lights will not be
 acceptable.
 At the end of the burn-in test, inspect all lights and Equipment for normal operation. Correct failures
 occurring during the test period. Make any necessary repairs or replacements at no cost to the Department.
 Perform a retest on the repair portion of the system.
 D. Illuminance. After the lights have been energized for the minimum 2 week burn-in period, arrange a nighttime inspection with the Department’s Master Electrician to determine the optical qualities of each
 luminaire. Adjust all luminaires having unsatisfactory qualities as directed. Conduct an illumination test to
 determine illumination characteristics of the roadway lighting system. Submit test procedures to the
 Engineer for approval two weeks prior to conducting the test. Submit four copies of the test results to the
 Engineer.
 843.03.3 Inspection.
 All Work will be inspected and approved by the Engineer before concealment. Hire a third-party inspection agency
 for certification and sticker placement for the entire electrical system. This inspection agency must be independent
 and licensed to operate in the State of Delaware, having no affiliation with the Department or the Contractor.
 Inspection is to be made during the progress and after the Work has been completed. The certification inspection
 includes the lighting control cabinets, cables and all other components of the lighting system. Submit four (4)
 copies of the inspection agency’s certification document to the Engineer. The Project will not be accepted as
 complete and energizing of the lighting system is not permitted until after receipt of a certification document. The
 Department will not conduct its final electrical inspection until after receipt of the inspection agency’s certification
 document. The inspection agency is also required to submit a “cut-in card” to the utility company prior to
 energizing the service.
 The Department will inspect the highway lighting system within the Project limits for both day and night
 acceptability considering all the possible defects listed in Section 843.03. If the highway lighting system is
 considered defective because of abnormal operation or deterioration (as listed in Section 843.03), the Department
 will require repair or replacement of the defective Equipment.
 843.03.4 As-Built Plans.
 Submit two (2) complete sets of as-built plans, including one set of CADD files, for review upon completion of the
 Work, showing the location of all buried electrical circuits, with lighting system elements dimensioned from fixed
 objects or from survey stations. Provide vertical dimensions related to finished ground level for all underground

 SECTION 846
 
 846.03 Construction.
 846.03.1 Loop Wire Installation.
 Saw cut a groove into the pavement that is 5/8 inch wide and up to 3-1/2 inches deep. Perform the saw cut as a
 “wet-cut” and in the directions and sizes specified in the Contract Documents. Remove sharp edges in the saw cut
 and round the corners. Blow out the saw cut with compressed air to remove all dust, water and particles of loose
 Material prior to sealing.
 Install the loop detector wire using blunt tools so as to prevent damage to the polyethylene outer cover. Tag one end
 of a loop detector wire to indicate start (“S”). Place a 5/8 inch backer rod on top of the wire in the saw cut as needed
 to secure the wiring within the saw cut. The Engineer may require a High Voltage Ground Test with a 500 volts DC
 megger after the loop detector installation is complete and prior to sealing saw cuts. If the resistance to ground is
 less than 100 megaohms, remedy the Work.
 Apply a sealer and sealer accelerant or retarder (if necessary) in the saw cut in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 directions and protect saw cut area from traffic until it has set. Install a minimum of 1 inch of sealer on top of the
 loop detector wire and finish flush with the pavement. Seal any drilled holes in the pavement.
 Install two loop detector wires in a saw cut from the loop to the edge of the road. Extend these two wires from the
 end of the saw cut to a junction well. Twist the wires a minimum of 5 wraps per foot in a parallel direction, and tape
 every 12 inches to 18 inches from the end of the saw cut to a junction well up to the splice. Where the junction well
 is directly behind the edge-of-pavement, curb or sidewalk, bore a 1-1/2 inch rotary drill hole between the edge-ofpavement, curb or sidewalk and the junction well as shown in the Contract Documents. Install loop detector lead-in
 wire through the rotary drill hole into the junction well and splice accordingly. Where the junction well is set farther
 away from the edge of pavement, usually on the backside of a grass buffer, install a length of 1-1/2 inch galvanized
 rigid metal conduit and weatherproof fitting between the rotary drill hole and junction well in accordance with the
 Contract Documents. Install the loop detector lead-in wire through the rotary drill hole, 1-1/2 inch conduit and
 junction well and splice accordingly.
 Install the loop detector wire in a continuous manner and without splices from the junction well, through the saw
 cuts and through the conduit.
 846.03.2 Home-run Wire Installation.
 Refer to Sections 831 and 832 for cable installation and conduit installation specifications. Refer to the Contract
 Documents for details.
 846.03.3 Splicing.
 Complete splices between the loop detector wire and home-run cable in accordance with the Contract Documents.
 Place conductors to be soldered side-by-side with the exposed copper aligned. Twist the copper clockwise to
 achieve a mechanical connection. Coat the splice with flux, heat with a soldering iron and rosin core solder in a
 manner that minimizes insulation damage. Insulate each soldered connection with heat-shrink tubing.
 Test to ensure that all circuits are complete after the electrical and mechanical connection is completed and before
 the splicing kit is installed. Install an approved splice kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The
 Department will perform a continuity test at the cabinet after the splicing kit is applied. Remake the splice and/or
 loop at no cost to the Department if the continuity test fails.
 Remake the splice at no cost to the Department if that splice becomes faulty within 90 Calendar Days of installation.
 The Department’s ITS Technician will make the determination if the splice is not water tight or if the wires are
 crossed or mislabeled.

 turbidity to adjacent waters during the removal of the turbidity curtain and all related
 components. The turbidity curtain and related components are the property of the Contractor.
 E. Stream Diversion. Construct, maintain and remove the stream diversion as follows:
 1.
 
 Construction of Stream Diversion. Construct the stream diversion as follows:
 Dewatering of the Work area shall be in accordance with Section 902 of the Standard Specifications.
 The design shown in the Plans is based on the most conservative stream diversion approach anticipated at
 the time of Bid, i.e., the largest footprint needed to complete the Work. Make every effort to implement
 the design within the limits shown on the Plans without additional impacts to the stream or wetland
 depicted on the Environmental Compliance sheet(s).
 If additional stream and/or wetland impacts are necessary, submit a preliminary layout of the impacts to the
 Engineer. Obtain written permission before proceeding with final design. Assume all cost of design and
 construction of alternate plans.
 The design of the alternate plans must comply with all applicable hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
 standards in effect when preparing the proposed alternative stream diversion plan regarding capacity of the
 system and potential surface water impacts upstream and downstream of the stream diversion.
 If permission is granted to proceed with final design of a proposal for an alternate stream diversion, prepare
 and submit the alternate in accordance with Section 105.04 of the Standard Specifications. Prepare
 alternate plans and submit three (3) copies of the final design as follows for review:
 a.
 
 Plans require sufficient detail to demonstrate the adequacy of the Materials, methods, and Equipment
 in providing stream diversion and erosion and sediment control;
 
 b.
 
 Include an itemized list of all Materials and Equipment to be used;
 
 c.
 
 Scaled drawings of the proposal overlaid on the Environmental Compliance sheet(s) in the Plans;
 
 d.
 
 supporting computations, maps, tables, etc.;
 
 e.
 
 all necessary supporting paperwork required for the submission of the permit modification request to
 the appropriate permitting agency;
 
 f.
 
 A table of any increased temporary impacts to wetlands and open waters.
 
 The alternate plans must be signed and sealed by a Professional Engineer licensed in the State of Delaware.
 The Department’s Environmental Studies Office will make application for permit modifications through the
 appropriate permitting authorities. The Environmental Studies Office will advise the Engineer of any
 missing or additional information needed to process the permit modification.
 The Department cannot guarantee the approval of any proposed alternative plan by any permitting authority
 or the Department. Denial of the alternate plan, long review times, or multiple submissions to any or all
 permitting authorities to gain approval does not relieve the Contractor from its obligation to complete the
 Project on time. The time between submission of the final status of the permit modification(s) and response
 from the Engineer may take as long as two months. No additional time will be granted for delays resulting
 from failing to schedule sufficient time for permit modification review and final decision.
 Installation and testing of the approved stream diversion system is required to demonstrate its
 effectiveness to the satisfaction of the Engineer before disturbance of the existing Structure. Correct
 any deficiencies found by the Engineer at no additional cost to the Department.

 910.03 Construction.
 A. Infiltration Stone (No. 3, No. 8, or No. 57) Use the following construction methods for infiltration stone.
 1.
 
 Subgrade Establishment.
 a.
 
 Establish the soil subgrade to the design subgrade elevation. Excavate the area in a manner that
 the subgrade elevation will be left in as near an undisturbed condition as possible. Use only low
 ground pressure Equipment to traffic the soil within the infiltration area.
 
 b.
 
 Where erosion of the native material subgrade has caused accumulation of fine materials and/or
 surface ponding, remove this material with light Equipment and scarify the underlying soils to a
 minimum depth of 6 inches with a York rake or equivalent and light tractor.
 
 c.
 
 Bring the subgrade to the lines, grades, and elevations indicated on the Plans. Fill and lightly
 regrade any areas damaged by erosion, ponding, or traffic compaction before placing the
 aggregate subbase.
 
 d.
 
 After excavation is complete, line the bottom and sides of the stone reservoir with geotextile to
 prevent upward piping of the underlining or underlying soil. Place the fabric as smoothly as
 possible with a 12 inch minimum overlap or greater as recommended by the manufacturer.
 
 2. Aggregate Placement.
 a.
 
 Prior to the placement of aggregate, remove any excess soils or contaminated soils from the
 surface of the subgrade.
 
 b.
 
 Place Materials in layers not exceeding 6 inched bulk and 4 inches compacted in depth, unless
 noted otherwise on the Plans.
 
 3. Aggregate Compaction.
 Use a static tandem drum type roller of not less than five tons weight to compact aggregate. Roll until
 no visible movement or significant settlement of the stone occurs beneath the roller drum. Plate
 compactors may be used for smaller areas where the larger Equipment cannot reach.
 4. Aggregate Tolerances.
 a.
 
 When placing base course aggregate in areas to be paved with pervious pavement (asphalt or
 concrete), construct the surface of the aggregate to compacted grade within the range of - 0.50
 inch and + 0.00 inch. Use string lines or electronic grade controls to establish the finished grade
 of each lift of stone.
 
 b.
 
 Upon completion of fine grading, compaction, and Contractor confirmation of conformance with
 the tolerances, notify the Engineer and schedule an inspection for approval. Do not pave or place
 concrete over the infiltration stone until it has been inspected and approved by the Engineer.
 
 B. Clay Borrow. Use the following construction methods for clay borrow.
 Place and compact clay borrow in accordance with the requirements of Section 910.03.D.4 and as directed
 by the Engineer.
 C. Outlet Structure, Concrete. Use the following construction methods for Outlet Structure, Concrete.
 1.
 
 Excavation. Excavate for the outlet Structure to the required depth. Compact the foundation upon
 which the Structure is to be placed to a firm and level, and unyielding surface.
 
 2.
 
 Riser. To construct concrete risers pour the concrete in place or use pre-cast concrete elements. If the
 concrete risers are pre-cast, design the lifting lugs, and all hardware required to transport and install the
 Structure. Do not use the top slab to lift the riser Structure. Fill any space between pipes and the walls
 910 - 2
 
 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FACILITIES
 
 SECTION 910
 
 of the pre-cast riser with grout. The largest dimension of the opening in the riser of connection of the
 outfall pipe shall be no greater than the outfall pipe diameter plus 4 inches.
 3.
 
 Anti-Seep Collars. To construct anti-seep collars, excavate the subgrade to the dimensions of the
 bottom half of the collars. Use the excavation as the form for the bottom half of the anti-seep collars.
 Place formwork for the top half of the anti-seep collars.
 
 4.
 
 Principal Spillway Outfall Pipe. Use Class A pipe bedding, per Standard Construction Details, for the
 principal spillway pipe.
 
 5.
 
 a.
 
 Use concrete shims to establish grade and alignment of the pipe. Do not use lumber or bricks for
 shims. Exercise care during backfill to prevent any pipe movement from the proposed horizontal
 and vertical alignment.
 
 b.
 
 When the principal spillway outfall pipe is to be placed partially or completely in fill, perform the
 Work in the following order: first, construct the fill Embankment 24 inches above the proposed
 top of pipe. Second, excavate the trench to the required grade with side slopes no steeper than 1:1.
 
 c.
 
 Place bell and spigot pipes with the bell ends upstream. Keep the pipe trench free of standing
 water during pipe placement and backfilling using an approved dewatering method.
 
 Backfill. Place backfill Material next to pipes and other Structures to the required elevation in 4 inches
 horizontal loose-thickness lifts at the same rate on all sides to prevent damage to the Structures from
 unequal loading.
 a.
 
 Compact each lift using a manually directed power tamper under and around the pipe and other
 Structures to 95 percent or more of maximum dry density by AASHTO T-99 Method C, Modified.
 
 b.
 
 Do not place backfill Material next to cast- in-place concrete Structures until the concrete has
 reached the strength requirements of Section 610.03.K.
 
 c.
 
 Place a minimum depth of 24 inches of hand compacted backfill Material over the pipe before
 crossing it with construction Equipment.

 Use the following construction methods to construct stormwater
 
 Use all suitable excavated Material to construct the dam foundation and Embankment. If
 permitted by the Engineer, Materials determined by the Engineer to be unsuitable for use in the
 dam foundation and Embankment may be deposited on slopes. Otherwise, use all excess Material
 meeting the requirements for Embankment to construct Embankments as required by the Contract
 Documents. Remove and dispose of all Material in excess of the Project’s Embankment
 requirements and all Material that is unsuitable for Embankment. Excess material is to be utilized
 per Section 202.03.e. Excavate rock per the requirements of Section 202. Rock excavation will be
 paid under Section 202.
 
 Dam Foundation and Reservoir Preparation. Prior to constructing the dam foundation and reservoir,
 clear the area of trees, logs, stumps, roots, brush, boulders, sod, topsoil and rubbish. Grade all surfaces
 under the foundation to remove irregularities. Scarify the surfaces parallel to the axis of the fill to
 loosen the soil a minimum of 2 inches in depth. Control the moisture content of the loosened Material
 as specified in Section 910.03.D.4.
 a.
 
 Keep the foundation area free of standing water during placement of the Material for the dam
 through the use of approved dewatering methods. Clean exposed rock surfaces under the
 foundation of all loosened earth Material.

 Foundation Cutoff Trench. Locate the foundation cutoff trench under the dam centerline or as shown
 on the Plans. Key the foundation cutoff trench into the original ground extending down to a relatively
 impervious layer and up the abutment slope to at least the ten-year pool elevation. Excavate the
 foundation cutoff trench prior to placing the dam Embankment. Extend the cutoff trench a minimum
 of 4 feet below the original ground surface or as indicated on the Plans. The trench shall have a
 minimum 4 foot bottom width or be wide enough to accommodate the Equipment used for excavation,
 backfill, and compaction. The side slopes of the cutoff trench shall be no steeper than 1:1.
 
 4.
 
 Dam Foundation and Embankment Placement and Compaction. Do not place fill until the required
 foundation preparation has been completed and the foundation excavation has been inspected and
 approved by the Engineer. Do not place fill on frozen surfaces. Do not use frozen Materials to
 construct the fill.
 
 5.
 
 a.
 
 If the surface of any layer becomes too hard, smooth or dry for proper bond with the next layer,
 scarify the surface of the layer parallel to the axis of the dam to a depth of not less than 2 inches
 and bring the Material to the optimum moisture content before the next layer is placed.
 
 b.
 
 Fill Material shall contain the optimum moisture to obtain the required density. If the Material is
 too wet or dry, remove and replace it. If the Material is too dry, add water and mix the soil until
 the optimum moisture content is met.
 
 c.
 
 Place fill Material beginning at the lowest area in 8 inches to 12 inches thick continuous,
 horizontal layers over the entire length of the fill. Obtain compaction using approved rollers or
 compactors. Begin compaction or rolling at the edges of the fill and progress towards the center of
 the Embankment. Continue compaction until each layer of the full width of the Embankment is
 thoroughly and uniformly compacted to at least 95 percent or more of maximum dry density by
 AASHTO T-99 Method C, Modified.
 
 Maintenance of the Stormwater Management Pond. When the stormwater management pond is used
 as a sediment basin, sediment will be removed when the cleanout elevation is reached. Dispose of the
 sediment at a location approved by the Engineer.

 be accepted, with the exception of plant Material delivered prior to planting as outlined in Section 911.03.3.
 
 B.
 
 Measurements. Furnish plants conforming to all sizes and measurements specified in the Plant List
 provided with the Contract Documents. Plants that conform to the requirements specified in the Plant List
 but do not have a normal balance between height and spread will not be accepted. Where any requirement
 or exact measurement is omitted, the plants furnished shall be normal for the species and variety as listed in
 "American Standard for Nursery Stock" (ANSI Z60.1). Plants for use where symmetry is required shall be
 matched as close as possible. All plants shall be measured for height and spread with the branches in their
 normal position. The trunk diameter of all trees shall be taken 6 inches above the ground level for up to
 and including 4 inch diameter sizes, and 12inches above the ground level for larger sizes. The height of the
 branches on the tree trunks need not be as specified if the required height can be obtained by pruning the
 lower branches without leaving unsightly scars and damaging the trunk. Pruning of branches for this effect
 is not permitted before delivery to the site unless approved. Plants larger in size than specified may be
 used. Larger plants, when selected for use over that which is specified, shall be dug with an earth ball or
 root spread proportionate to the increased size. If plants smaller than specified are provided, submit a

 5.
 
 Ground Cover and Herbaceous Perennials. Use one 20 g tablet for each plant.
 
 No backfill shall be placed in any pit until the excavation has been inspected. Excess excavated Material shall be
 removed from the Project site.
 911.03.3 Digging and Handling. All precautions customary in good trade practice shall be taken in preparing
 plants for transplanting. Plants transplanted with workmanship that fails to meet the highest standards will be
 rejected. All balled and burlapped plants shall have firm, natural balls of earth of ample proportions and diameter
 not less than as specified in AAN's "USA Standards for Nursery Stock". Plants with cracked, broken, or crushed
 balls, which occur either before or during planting operations, will be rejected or shall be removed from the site
 immediately. Handle all plants so that roots are adequately protected and moist at all times. Protect all plants by
 covering with canvas, wet straw, burlap, moss, or other suitable Material and keep covered until ready to be planted.
 Trees should not be planted with frozen earth balls. Containerized plant Material shall be growing in the specified
 size container for at least six months and shall not display signs of being root bound or unnatural ratio of planting
 medium versus root mass.
 911.03.4 Location of Plants. Place plants as indicated on the Plans. Locations of the plants may be shifted to avoid
 utilities subject to the approval of the Engineer. No excavation shall commence until locations are approved.
 911.03.5 Planting. Plant all trees and shrubs in pits as detailed in the Construction Documents. Pits shall not be
 excavated with vertical sides. Pits shall be of such a depth that, when planted and settled, the crown of the plant
 shall bear the same relation to finished grade as it did to soil surface in its place of growth. With the approval of the
 Engineer, the Contractor may elect to plant wetland grown containerized shrubs on small mounds raised no more
 than 2 inches above the final grading elevation shown on the Plans.
 Open plant pits shall not be allowed overnight in residential areas or in any location where it is determined by the
 Engineer to pose a potential hazard to pedestrians or traffic.
 Cover all backfill topsoil with a waterproof Material after mixing. Backfill pits with specified soil mix and compact
 firmly under ball of roots to establish a firm foundation. Set plants in the center of pits in a vertical position so that
 the crown of the plant is level with the finished grade after allowing for watering and settling of soil. With care,
 firmly tamp the "Soil Mixture" under and around the base of the ball to fill all voids. When partially backfilled and
 compacted, remove the burlap and any wire baskets from the sides and tops of the balls and cut away to prevent air
 pockets, leaving the burlap from under the balls. Properly dispose of all burlap, wire baskets and other containers
 from the jobsite at the end of each Day. Fill the balance of the planting hole with the planting mixture, and form a
 ring of earth around the plant to produce a dish for watering. Water all plants immediately after planting as directed
 by the Engineer. For this initial watering, completely saturate all backfill in the pits and beds during the same Day
 of planting. Use care during all planting operations to ensure that no excavated Material is dumped on any grassed
 911 - 5
 
 PLANTINGS
 
 SECTION 911
 
 area unless a suitable type of matting or protective underlay is used. Repair any damage to all grassed, planted, or
 other landscaped areas, caused by the Contractor, to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 Prepare ground cover and herbaceous perennial areas by rototilling to a minimum depth of 10 inches. The mixing of
 peat moss, peat humus, or approved equal may be performed separately in order to obtain the proportion of ground
 cover or herbaceous perennial soil mixture as specified. Beyond the minimum excavation as stated above for soil
 mixing, the root system of the plant determines the actual depth for individual plant excavation. Backfill plants with
 the soil mixture and compact firmly around roots. Place a minimum of 2 inches of approved mulch on a smooth and
 uniform grade.
 A. Pruning. Prune all plants immediately after planting or transplanting to remove all injured or dead wood.
 All trees inspected and tagged at the nursery shall conform to AAN Standards, and any subsequent pruning
 by the Contractor shall in no way alter the natural habit or shape of the plant. Perform all pruning using
 sharp tools by workers skilled in this operation. Make all cuts flush, leaving no stubs. On all cuts over 3/4
 inch in diameter and bruises or scars on the bark, trace back and remove the injured cambium to living
 tissue; smooth and shape all wounds so as to preserve the branch bark ridge.
 B. Watering. Water all plants, in accordance with Section 911.03.6, on the same Day as planting unless
 otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 C. Mulching. Place a minimum of 4 inches of mulch on all areas of trees and shrubs. Place mulch the same
 Day of planting, unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 D. Wire baskets, nylon binding and treated burlap. Cut away and remove the wire baskets, nylon binding, and
 burlap from the top half of the root ball.
 E. Staking and Guying. Install all staking and guying specified on the same Day as planting and mulching,
 unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 F.
 
 Cleaning Up. Throughout the course of planting, remove from the site all excess and waste materials, keep
 seeded areas clean, and take all precautions to avoid damage to existing Structures, trees, shrubs, plants,
 and grass. When planting in an area that has been otherwise completed, clear area of all debris, rubbish,
 subsoil, and remove all waste materials from the site immediately upon completion of the planting. Rake
 all ground surfaces smooth. Repair all sodded areas disturbed as a result of construction at no additional
 cost to the Department.
 
 911.03.6 Plant Establishment. The plant establishment period for all planting begins immediately after all planting
 and replacements (as specified under Section 911.03.5, Planting) are complete and acceptable to the Engineer. The
 plant establishment period will consist of one full growing season during which time the Contractor is responsible
 for all Work necessary to keep the plants in a live and healthy condition. A growing season is defined as the period
 from May 1 through September 30. If the Contractor completes all planting in accordance with the Contract
 Documents by May 1, the inspection will be held on or about October 1 of that year. In the event the Contractor
 does not complete all planting by May 1, the inspection will be held on or about October 1 of the following year.
 All replacement plant Material determined to be necessary at the inspection must then be approved at the
 replacement plant source by October 15. At this time, the Engineer will direct the Contractor to replace those plants
 determined to be dead or unhealthy by December 1. Notify the Engineer in writing that all replacement planting has
 been accomplished. The Engineer will conduct an inspection within 15 Days after such notification to determine the
 acceptability of the replacements. If all replacements are determined satisfactory by the Engineer, the Contractor
 will be relieved of all further responsibility for care and replacement.
 Keep all planting areas free of weeds and grass during the life of the Contract. The Contractor may utilize a pre- or
 post-emergent herbicide to control such grass and broadleaf weeds incidental to the cost of planting and be totally
 responsible for the proper use and placement of any such herbicide. Weed within all plant beds and within the
 saucer limits of individual plants, beginning 10 Days after the date of notification by the Engineer. Prune and apply
 insecticides or fungicides as required, repair or replace stakes and guy wires, tighten guy cable or wire and repair
 plant saucer washouts when and as specified by the Engineer.
 Reset at the proper grades, any plants that settle below or rise above the desired finished grades.

 PILE MATERIALS
 
 SECTION 1032
 
 SECTION 1032 – PILE MATERIALS
 1032.01 Description.
 Provide Materials for treated and untreated timber piles and test piles, cast-in-place concrete piles and test piles,
 steel H pile and test piles, and precast, prestressed concrete piles and test piles as specified herein.
 1032.02 Timber Pile Materials.
 1032.02.1 Classification.
 Use any species of wood that satisfactorily withstands driving for untreated timber piles that will be below water
 level at all times.
 Provide untreated timber piles for use in exposed Work with a diameter of heartwood at the butt not less than 80
 percent of the required diameter of the pile. Use southern yellow pine or Douglas fir for treated timber piles, unless
 otherwise specified.
 1032.02.2 Requirements.
 Cut all piling from sound, live timber. Do not use timber that contains unsound knots. Sound knots will be allowed
 provided the diameter of the knot does not exceed the lesser of 4 inches or one-third the diameter of the pile at the
 point where the knot occurs. Do not use timber with any defect or combination of defects, which impairs the
 strength of the pile more than that of the maximum allowable knot. Saw the butts square. Saw the tips square or
 taper to a point not less than 4 inches square where soil conditions warrant pointing the tip. Limit the slope of the
 spiral grain, if present, so that it does not exceed 1 inch in height for 12 inches in length.
 Provide piles with a uniform taper from butt to tip. Reject any pile in which a line drawn from the center of the butt
 to the center of the tip falls outside the center of the pile at any point more than 0.5 percent of the length of the pile.
 Reject piles with bends which may cause difficulty in driving.
 Do not use piles with season checks which penetrate more than one-sixth of the diameter of the pile or are more than
 1/4 inch in width. A check is defined as a lengthwise separation of the wood across the rings of normal growth,
 extending from the surface toward the pith, but not extending through the piece. Piles must meet the requirements of
 AASHTO M 168.
 1032.02.3 Preparation.
 Remove the outer bark from untreated piles. Remove by peeling all the outer bark and at least 80 percent of the
 inner bark from treated piles. Do not leave any strip of inner bark on the pile over 3/4 inch wide or over 8 inches
 long, and ensure that there is at least 1 inch of clean wood surface between any two such strips.
 1032.02.4 Dimensions.
 Measure the diameter that designates the size of piles 3 feet from the butt. Use piles with a minimum tip diameter of
 8 inches for piles under 40 feet in length and 7 inches for 40 feet and longer piles. Measure all dimensions under the
 bark. Do not exceed a maximum diameter of 20 inches at butt of any pile.
 1032.02.5 Preservation Treatment.
 If specified, treat piles with preservative treatment in accordance with AASHTO M 133 and the AWPA preservation
 standards specified therein. Use CCA applied with the full-cell or modified full-cell method unless otherwise
 specified. Treat piles to be used on land, in freshwater or in foundations with a retention rate of 0.8 pounds per cubic
 foot for Southern Pine and with a retention rate of 1.0 pounds per cubic foot for Douglas Fir. Treat piles to be
 exposed to a marine environment with a retention rate of 2.5 pounds per cubic foot for Southern Pine. Do not use
 piles made of Douglas Fir in a marine environment.
 1032.02.6 Inspection.
 The timber, and the operation of treatment, will be inspected at the treating plant, both before and after treating, and
 all acceptable timber will be marked with the Department’s standard hammer mark. All timber piles are also subject
 to inspection at the site of the Work. If the pile is found defective, it will be rejected.

 PILE MATERIALS
 
 SECTION 1032
 
 1032.02.7 Storing and Handling.
 Handle piles in accordance with Section 605.03.1. Field protect all cuts, holes, and injuries of the surface of treated
 Material by brushing, spraying, dipping, soaking, or coating. Ensure that all injuries, such as abrasions and nail and
 spike holes, are thoroughly saturated with the field-treating solution. Do not cut or trim treated piles in any manner
 after they are driven other than to saw off the tops as hereinafter specified. Treat holes bored in pressure treated
 Material by pouring them full of preservative. Treat horizontal holes, such as those for sway brace bolts, by pouring
 the preservative into them with a bent funnel. Fill all holes made for determining penetration and retention of
 preservatives with tight fitting treated cylindrical plugs.
 1032.03 Cast-in-place Concrete Pile Materials.
 1032.03.1 Shells (Steel Casings).
 Use fluted steel pile shells for cast-in-place concrete piles, unless steel pipe pile shells are specified on the Plans.
 If steel pipe piles are used, use steel pipe pile shell conforming to the requirements of ASTM A 252, Grade 2 with a
 minimum wall thickness of 1/4 inch. For welded pipe piles, provide seams that are straight or spiral-butt welded
 having full strength welded joints. Seamless steel pipe piles are also acceptable. Equip all piles with cast steel,
 inside-flange, extra strong, ribbed 60 degree conical points. Securely fit the conical points to the bottom of the pile
 shells by welding with a 30 degree beveled groove weld all around and in such a manner to minimize any extrusion
 beyond the outside surface of the steel casings. A maximum protrusion of 1/4 inch is permissible. If the protrusion
 exceeds 1/4 inch, grind the protruding weld flush with the outside surface of the pile shell.
 If fluted steel pile shells are used, provide a tapered section with a tip diameter of 8 inches with a closed conical
 point and taper rate of 0.4 inch per foot. Provide fluted steel piles closed or open ended as specified on the Plans.
 Splice piles by cutting the walls in a serrated pattern, inserting the added section, crimping back, and welding along
 the entire perimeter with a continuous 3/8 inch fillet weld. Perform welding with AWS certified welders approved
 by the Department. Welding certifications shall be current and must show passing qualifications for the type of
 welding to be performed. Use steel shells conforming to SAE 1010 or 1015 and have a minimum yield point of
 50,000 pounds per square inch and a minimum thickness of 7 gage.
 Construct all field splices to have the full strength of the sections they connect. Keep a minimum distance of 40 feet
 between field splices when possible. Obtain approval from the Engineer for all field splices.
 1032.03.2 Protective Coating.
 When indicated on the Plans, protect the pile shells (steel casings) with a coating consisting of either coal tar epoxy
 or fusion bonded epoxy.
 If coal tar epoxy coating is specified, apply two coats of dark red coal tar epoxy. Thoroughly dry and commercially
 blast clean the pile shell according to SSPC-SP 6 before coating. Perform the two coat application, final drying time,
 touch-up, and inspection in conformance to the Specifications of the SSPC. Provide a dry film thickness of each coat
 of 8 mils minimum and 16 mils for the two-coat system.

 utilizing Type III cement will be considered acceptable for placement in the wall prior to 28 days only
 when compressive strength test results indicate that the strength meets the 28 day specification.
 
 2.
 
 Casting – Cast the panels on a flat area with the front face of the panel at the bottom and the back face
 at the upper part. Set coil loop inserts, rebar, PVC pipe and lifting devices in place to the dimensions
 and tolerances shown on the drawings prior to casting. Place the PVC pipe in a manner as to insure
 that it is not bent or bowed. Set coil loop inserts on the rear face. Place the concrete in each unit
 without interruption and consolidate by the use of an approved vibrator, supplemented by hand
 tamping as may be necessary to force the concrete into the corners of the forms and prevent the
 formation of aggregate pockets, air bubbles or cleavage planes. Use clear form oil of the same
 manufacturer throughout the casting operation.

 MECHANICALLY STABILIZED EARTH WALL MATERIALS
 
 SECTION 1048
 
 the vertical and horizontal alignment of the coil loop inserts, free of all concrete or debris, loose or
 otherwise, 2-1/4 inch deep in the finished panel. Ensure that no concrete or other debris is on the
 interior surfaces of the coils of the coil loop inserts in the finished panels. Immediately after the
 alignment template is removed, place duct tape over the coil loop insert holes in order to prevent debris
 from entering the holes. Removal of the duct tape is only permitted by the crew that is assembling the
 wall. Take care to insure that the duct tape is not removed during shipping.
 4.
 
 Curing – Cure the units for at least 72 hours. Any panel which does not reach specified strength within
 28 days will be rejected.
 
 5.
 
 Removal of forms – Do not remove the forms until they can be removed without damage to the unit.
 
 6.
 
 Concrete Finish:
 
 7.
 
 a.
 
 Front - As specified on Plans
 
 b.
 
 Rear - Unformed surface, roughly screeded to eliminate open pockets of aggregate and surface
 distortions in excess of 1/4 inch.
 
 Tolerances:
 a.
 
 Panel dimensions – within 3/16 inch except that the lateral position of tie strips within 1 inch.
 
 b.
 
 Panel squareness – within 1/2 inch as determined by the difference between the two diagonals.
 
 c.
 
 Panel surface defects:
 i.
 
 Smooth formed surfaces – not to exceed 1/8 inch per 5 foot length.
 
 ii. Textured finished surfaces – not to exceed 5/16 inch per 5 foot length.
 8.
 
 Compressive strength - Acceptance of the concrete panels with respect to compressive strength will be
 determined on a basis of production lots. A production lot is defined as a group of panels representing
 40 panels or a single day's production, whichever is less.
 a.
 
 During the production of the concrete panels, randomly sample the concrete in accordance with
 AASHTO R 60. A single compressive strength sample consists of a minimum of 4 cylinders
 randomly selected for every production lot. Prepare 6 inch x 12 inch cylinders for compressive
 strength tests and test in accordance with AASHTO T 23 and T 22, respectively. For every
 compressive strength sample, cure a minimum of 2 cylinders in the same manner as the panels and
 test at approximately 7 days. The average compressive strength of these cylinders, will determine
 the initial strength of the concrete. In addition, cure 2 cylinders in accordance with AASHTO T
 23 and test at 28 days. The average compressive strength of these two cylinders, will determine
 the compressive strength of the production lot.
 
 b.
 
 If the initial strength test results indicate a compressive strength in excess of 4500 pounds per
 square inch, then these test results will be utilized as the compressive strength test results for that
 production lot and the requirement for testing at 28 days will be waived for that particular
 production lot.
 
 c.
 
 Acceptance of a production lot will be made if the compressive strength test result is greater than
 or equal to 4500 pounds per square inch. If the compressive strength test result is less than 4500
 pounds per square inch, the acceptance of the production lot will be based on its meeting the
 following acceptance criteria in its entirety:
 i. Ninety (90) percent of the compressive strength test results for the overall production exceeds
 4,670 pounds per square inch.
 ii. The average of any six (6) consecutive compressive strength test results exceeds 4,750 pounds
 per square inch.
 iii. No individual compressive strength test result falls below 4,050 pounds per square inch.
 
 d.
 
 If a production lot fails to meet the specified compressive strength requirements, the production lot
 1048 - 3
 
 MECHANICALLY STABILIZED EARTH WALL MATERIALS
 
 SECTION 1048
 
 will be rejected. The rejection prevails unless the manufacturer, at his own expense, obtains and
 submits evidence of a type acceptable to the Engineer that the strength and quality of the concrete
 placed within the panels of the production lot are acceptable. If the evidence consists of tests
 made on cores taken from the panels within the production lot, obtain and test the cores in
 accordance with the requirements of AASHTO T 24.
 9.
 
 Rejection – Units are subject to rejection because of failure to meet any of the requirements specified
 above. In addition, any or all of the following defects may be sufficient cause for rejection:
 a.
 
 Defects that indicate imperfect molding.
 
 b.
 
 Defects that indicate honeycombed or open texture concrete.
 
 c.
 
 Defects in the physical characteristics of the concrete, such as broken or chipped concrete.
 
 d.
 
 Stained form face, due to excessive form oil or others.
 
 e.
