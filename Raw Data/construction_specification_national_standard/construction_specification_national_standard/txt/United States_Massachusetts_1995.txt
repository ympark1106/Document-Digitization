 PREFACE
 Introduction
 The 1995 Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges uses the
 metric system exclusively for all measurements. This change is in response to the Federal Government mandate that all
 highway construction contracts receiving Federal-aid funding, and advertized after September 30, 1996, have Plans,
 Specifications and Estimates (PS&E’s) prepared exclusively in metric units. Therefore, any project designed by any
 state agency/authority and/or which involves Federal and/or Massachusetts Highway Department (MHD) funding and
 scheduled for advertising after September 30, 1996, must be prepared in metric units.
 Legal Basis for Highway Conversion
 The use of the metric system has been established over the past two decades by the Federal Government in a
 series of acts, regulations, and orders, the most important of which are summarized below. The intent of these initiatives
 is to have the United States adopt a measurement system that is simpler to use, uses only one unit for measuring each
 physical quantity, and provides industry the opportunity to rethink their designs and to incorporate efficient practices. It
 also brings the United States into line with the rest of the world, which now is virtually all metric.
 Metric Conversion Act of 1975
 The 1975 Act (15 U.S.C. 2056) declared a national policy of coordinating and encouraging the increased use
 of the metric system. The Act required that the conversion be led by industry and the key word was “voluntary.”
 Although conversion activities were somewhat increased, there was no widespread support from industry for complete
 metrication. The American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHTO) decided at that time to defer further
 activity on conversion until national legislation was adopted.
 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988
 Section 5164(b) of the Trade and Competitiveness Act (Public Law 100-418) amended the Metric Conversion
 Act of 1975 to declare that the metric system is the preferred system of weights and measures for U.S. trade and
 commerce. Further, it requires each Federal agency to convert to the metric system to the extent feasible by September
 30, 1992 for all procurements, grants, and business-related activities. The obvious intent of this Act was to use the
 substantial buying power of the Federal government to lead the country to the metric system.
 U.S. DOT Metric Conversion Planning Guidelines
 On May 8, 1990, the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) issued order 1020.1C which established
 policy and administrative procedures for the transition. The U.S. DOT Order requires agencies to develop plans for
 metric conversion to the extent practical including specific dates for changeover to metric in all procurements, grants,
 and other business-related activities. In response to this Order the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) developed
 an approved conversion plan and a timetable which is intended to lead to complete metric implementation by September
 30, 1996.
 Executive Order 12770
 On July 25, 1991, President Bush issued Executive Order 12770, Metric Usage in Federal Government
 Programs. The intent of this Order is clear. Federal Agencies are to convert to metric and they are to do so within a
 fixed period of time.

 The 1995 Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges has
 undergone an extensive review during its preparation and conversion to the metric system. Users of this document
 should note the following:
 1. Metric measurements noted herein have been developed based on information available at the time this document
 was published and generally accepted metric conversion practices. Some measurements have been “soft” converted
 while other measurements have been “hard” converted. In “soft” conversion, an inch-pound measurement is
 mathematically converted to its exact (or nearly exact) metric equivalent. With “hard” conversion, a new rounded,
 rationalized metric number is created that is convenient to work with and remember.
 2. As the transition to the metric system continues in the United States, it is inevitable that changes to some metric
 measurements noted herein will be modified, particularly as more products become “hard” converted.
 3. In addition to the exclusive use of metric units in the 1995 Massachusetts Highway Department Standard
 Specifications for Highways and Bridges there have also been changes to various sections and new sections added
 that are not in the 1988 edition of this document. It is therefore necessary to use only the appropriate document for a
 particular project.

 SECTION 2.00
 PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS
 2.01
 
 Proposal Forms and Plans.
 
 A. Prequalification Prior to Requesting Proposal Forms.
 Subject to the requirements of Chapter 29, Section 8B of the General Laws, each prospective Bidder proposing
 to bid on any work, excepting the construction, reconstruction, repair or alteration of buildings, to be awarded by the
 Department or by a municipality under the provisions of Section 34 of Chapter 90, must be prequalified in accordance
 with 720 CMR 5.00, “Prequalification of Contractors”, if the amount of the proposal added to the value of the
 uncompleted work already under contract with the Department will aggregate $50,000 or more.
 For work aggregating under $50,000, prequalification is desirable but not required.
 B. Issuance of Proposal Forms and Plans.
 All prospective Bidders who intend to bid on work to be awarded by the Department, may obtain plans
 and specifications from the Department at the place specified in the Notice to Contractors.
 For projects to be awarded under the provisions of Section 34, Chapter 90 of the General Laws, bidders may
 obtain plans and specifications from the applicable municipality at the place specified in the Notice to Contractors.
 Only a prequalified bidder shall be entitled to receive an officially numbered non-transferable Proposal
 Pamphlet along with a set of plans for the project (if required). Informational copies of plans and specifications are
 available to non-prequalified individuals and firms.
 Payment of the specified fee is required prior to receipt of plans and specifications from the Department. The
 amount will be refunded to only those who submit a formal bid for the project within the time stipulated on the proposal
 form furnished by the Department, provided the Notice to Contractors so specifies and further provided that the plans
 are returned in good condition within one week from the date of bid opening, or to a common carrier or the post office
 department not later than the Friday following bid opening for subsequent delivery to the Department.
 Except for projects for which Prequalification is not required under 720 CMR 5.04(2), proposals for a project
 shall be limited to those bidders who have been Prequalified by the Prequalification Committee in the specified class of
 work on or before the time of bid opening, and who have not exceeded the Aggregate Bonding Capacity established by
 the bidder's surety company, and who have, if applicable, a Single Project Limit in an amount equal to or in excess of the
 Proposal amount, and who are otherwise in compliance with these regulations.
 Official Proposal Books shall contain an officially numbered non-transferable, itemized proposal form
 specifying the location and description of the contemplated work; the approximate estimates of the various quantities of
 work to be performed and materials to be furnished; the time in which the work must be completed; and also a Notice to
 Contractors and Special Provisions or requirements for the particular project. The prospective Bidder shall also be
 entitled to a set of project plans and profiles, either full size or reduced size at the option of the Department, a set of full
 size bridge plans, and detail sheets showing the preliminary estimate of quantities with information pertinent thereto.
 No municipality may award a contract until the Department has determined that the bidder was prequalified in
 the specified class of work on or before the time of bid opening, and has not exceeded the Aggregate Bonding Capacity
 established by the bidder's surety company, and has, if applicable, a Single Project Limit in an amount equal to or in
 excess of the Proposal amount, and is otherwise in compliance with 720 CMR 5.00, “Prequalification of Contractors”.
 2.02
 
 Interpretation of Basic Estimate of Quantities.
 
 A. All bids will be compared on the estimate of quantities of work to be done, as shown in the Proposal.
 The parties expressly agree that these quantities are being set forth as a basis for the comparison of bids only
 and the parties also expressly agree that the actual amount of work may not correspond therewith. The Department
 expressly reserves the right to adjust said quantities in accordance with actual conditions as found to exist during the
 course of work.
 Bidders agree to submit their estimate upon the following express condition, which shall apply to and become
 part of every bid received, viz:
 
 I.10
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 An increase or decrease in the quantity for any item shall not be regarded as cause for an increase or decrease
 in the contract unit prices, nor in the time allowed for the completion of the work, except as provided in the Contract.
 (Also see Subsections 4.06 and 9.03.)
 B. The excavation, masonry and other parts of the work have been divided into classes and items in order to
 enable the Bidder to bid on the different portions of the work in accordance with the Bidder’s estimate of their cost, so
 that in the event of an increase or decrease in the quantities of any particular class of work the actual quantities executed
 shall be paid for that particular class of work, (except in structures bid as a lump sum item where the payment for an
 increase or decrease in the quantities of concrete will be adjusted as stipulated in Section 995).
 2.03
 
 Examination of Plans, Specifications, Special Provisions, and Site of Work.
 
 The Department will prepare plans and specifications giving directions which will enable any competent
 mechanic or contractor to carry them out. The Bidder is expected to examine carefully the site of the proposed work, the
 proposal, plans, specifications, supplemental specifications, special provisions, and contract forms, before submitting a
 Proposal. The submission of a bid shall be considered prima facie evidence that the Bidder has made such examination
 of the site of the proposed work, plans, proposal, etc., and is familiar with the conditions to be encountered in
 performing the work and as to the requirements of the plans, specifications, supplemental specifications, special
 provisions, and Contract.
 2.04
 
 Preparation of Proposals.
 
 A. Bid Prices.
 The Bidder shall submit his/her proposal upon the blank forms furnished by, or approved by the Department.
 The Bidder shall specify a unit price, in both words and figures, for each item for which a quantity is given, and shall
 also show the products of the respective unit prices and quantities written in figures in the column provided for that
 purpose, and the total amount of the proposal obtained by adding the amounts of the several items. All words and
 figures shall be in ink. In case of a discrepancy between the unit prices written in words and unit prices written in
 figures, the written words shall govern. In the event the bidder fails to enter a price for a particular bid item, the
 Department will consider the amount bid to be zero.
 When an item in the Proposal contains a choice to be made by the Bidder, the Bidder shall indicate his/her
 choice in accordance with the specifications for that particular item, and thereafter no further choice will be permitted.
 The price for any item, bid and contracted for, unless otherwise noted or specified, shall include full
 compensation for all materials, equipment, tools, labor and incidental work, necessary to complete the item to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer. The prices, without exception, shall be net, not subject to discount, and shall include all
 royalties and costs arising from patents, trade marks, and copyrights in any way involved in the work.
 B. Signatures.
 All Proposals shall be signed correctly with ink in the proper place provided, as follows:
 If the Proposal is made by an individual, the name and post office address shall be stated.
 If the Proposal is made by a firm, partnership or corporation, it shall be signed by a person having such legal
 authority from the said firm, partnership or corporation and the person so signing the Proposal shall give his/her own
 name and title (if any) in addition to the name and address of the firm, partnership or corporation. If the Proposal is
 made by a firm or partnership the names and addresses of the individual members shall be given.
 If the Proposal is made by a corporation, the name of the State under the Laws of which the corporation was
 chartered and the names, titles and business addresses of the President, Treasurer and Clerk shall be given.
 If a Proposal is made by two or more individuals, partnerships, or corporations, or any combination of these as
 a joint venture, each party joining to make the Proposal shall submit attached to and made part of the Proposal all
 information and all signatures in compliance with the foregoing provisions applicable to an individual, firm, partnership
 or corporation. In addition, if any of the joint ventures are a corporation, an attested copy of the vote of the corporation
 authorizing such joint venture shall be attached to the Proposal.
 C. Affidavits.
 The Bidder shall file a sworn statement executed by or on behalf of the person, firm, association or corporation
 submitting the bid, certifying that such person, firm, association or corporation has not, either directly or indirectly,
 entered into an agreement, participated in any collusion, or otherwise taken any action, in restraint of free competitive
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 I.11
 
 bidding in connection with the submitted bid. This sworn statement shall be in the form of an affidavit sworn to under
 the pains and penalties of perjury. The required form for the affidavit will be provided with the Proposal. Failure to
 submit the sworn statement on the required form as part of the bid approval package shall make the bid informal as to
 substance and not eligible for award consideration.
 2.05
 
 Delivery of Proposals.
 
 The Bidder shall submit prior to the time set for opening of the bid his/her Proposal properly sealed, delivered
 or mailed in the envelopes furnished by the Department and in accordance with the instructions printed thereon. A
 Proposal shall not be accepted unless it is submitted in the envelopes furnished by the Department.
 2.06
 
 Proposal Guaranty Required.
 
 In order to insure the faithful fulfillment of its terms, each Proposal shall be accompanied by a bid deposit in
 the amount of five percent (5%) of the bid.
 The bid deposit shall be a bid bond in a form satisfactory to the Party of the First Part furnished by a surety
 company incorporated pursuant to Chapter 175, Section 105 of the General Laws or authorized to do business in the
 Commonwealth under Chapter 175, Section 106 of the General Laws and satisfactory to the Party of the First Part; or
 cash; or a certified check drawn on a responsible bank or trust company (or a treasurer's or cashier's check issued by
 such bank or trust company), payable to the Party of the First Part.
 The bid deposit should not be enclosed in the sealed envelope with the Proposal but shall be delivered to the
 Supervisor of Fiscal Management or his/her agent.
 The bid deposit will be returned to the Bidder unless retained by the Party of the First Part under conditions
 hereinafter stipulated.
 2.07
 
 Withdrawal of Proposals.
 
 A Bidder may withdraw his/her Proposal provided the request in writing is in the hands of the Engineer by the
 time set for opening Proposals. When such proposal is reached during the opening of the bids it will be returned to the
 bidder unread.
 A bidder may withdraw a bid on a clear showing to the satisfaction of the Department that the bid amount
 resulted from bona fide clerical or mechanical error of a substantial nature or from other similar unforeseen
 circumstances. The Department will return the bid deposit.
 2.08
 
 Public Opening of Proposals.
 
 Proposals will be opened and the total price of each bid read publicly at the time and place indicated in the
 "Notice to Contractors". Any person may at reasonable times and in the presence of the Engineer examine any or all
 Proposals after they have been opened and read.
 2.09
 
 Rejection of Proposals.
 
 Proposals which fail to meet the requirements of Subsections 2.04, 2.05 and 2.06 or which are incomplete,
 conditional or obscure, or which contain additions not called for, erasures, alterations or irregularities of any kind, or in
 which errors occur, or which contain abnormally high or abnormally low prices for any class or item of work, may be
 declared informal, provided however that the Commission may, if it deems it to be in the public interest, waive any or all
 informalities as to form. Informalities as to substance, however, shall not be waived.
 More than one Proposal from the same Bidder, whether or not the same or different names appear on the
 signature page, will not be considered. Reasonable proof for believing that any Bidder is so interested in more than one
 Proposal for the work contemplated will cause the rejection of all Proposals made by him/her directly or indirectly. Any
 Proposals will be rejected if there is reason for believing that collusion exist among the Bidders. (See Subsection 3.01.)
 In accordance with 720 CMR 5.00, Proposals may also be rejected if:
 (i) award of the contract would result in the Bidder exceeding the Aggregate Bonding Capacity established by its
 
 I.12
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 Surety Company, or the Bidder's Proposal exceeds its single project limit, or the Bidder was not prequalified in the
 specified class of work on or before the time of bid opening; or
 (ii)
 the Bidder is presently debarred from performing work of any kind under the provisions of Massachusetts
 General Laws, Chapter 29, Section 29F, or any other applicable debarment provisions of the
 Massachusetts General Laws or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder; or
 (iii) the Bidder is presently debarred from performing work of any kind under the laws of any state other than the
 Commonwealth of Massachusetts, or by any Federal agency or authority; or
 (iv) there is substantial reason to believe that the condition of the Bidder's firm is less favorable than at the time of
 its last Application for Prequalification; or
 (v) the Bidder does not have sufficient equipment, or sufficient assets to provide necessary equipment either
 through purchase or lease agreements; or
 (vi) the Bidder's performance on past or current work with the Department or other awarding authorities is or has
 been unsatisfactory; or
 (vii) on current projects of the Department or other public authorities the Bidder frequently fails or has failed to pay
 its subcontractors or material suppliers in a timely manner, or that five (5) or more subcontractors or material suppliers
 of the Contractor for a project currently under construction have filed demands for direct payment with the project’s
 awarding authority in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 30, Section 39F;or
 (viii) the Bidder is not otherwise an eligible and responsible Bidder capable of performing the work.
 2.10
 
 Disqualification of Bidders.
 
 Bidders whose Proposals have been rejected because of evidence of collusion may be subject to debarment
 under applicable provisions of state and federal law.
 2.11
 
 Determination of Lowest Bid.
 
 The lowest bid shall be determined by the Department on the basis of the total price for which the entire work
 will be performed, arrived at by a correct computation of all the items specified in the Proposal at their estimated
 quantities and the unit prices submitted therefor.
 2.12
 
 Material Guaranty.
 
 Before any Contract is awarded, the Bidder may be required to furnish without expense to the Department a
 complete statement of the origin, composition and manufacture of any or all materials proposed to be used in the
 construction of the work, together with samples, which may be subjected to the tests required by the Department to
 determine the quality and fitness of the material.

 SECTION 3.00
 AWARD AND EXECUTION OF CONTRACT
 3.01
 
 Consideration of Proposals.
 
 The Party of the First Part reserves the right to reject any and all bids, or any bid item, to advertise for new
 Proposals for the project, to waive technicalities, to waive informalities as to form, or to proceed to do the work
 otherwise, as may be deemed to be in the best interest of the Department.
 Nothing herein shall be construed as depriving the Highway Commission of the right to reject any bid when
 such bid does not fully comply with the specifications for the project or the applicable public bidding law or regulations,
 or the Contractor is otherwise not eligible or responsible to receive award of the contract.
 A proposal will be considered irregular and will be rejected if it is determined that any of the unit prices are
 materially unbalanced to the detriment of the Department. The bidder will be required to justify in writing the price or
 prices bid for the work in question before the Department decides to award the contract or reject the bid.
 3.02
 
 Award of Contract.
 
 Subject to the reservations in Subsection 3.01, the Contract will be awarded to the lowest eligible and
 responsible Bidder.
 It is anticipated that the Contract will be awarded within 30 days after the opening of bids, or, for projects
 requiring concurrence by the FHWA, or other Agencies, within 45 days after the opening of bids.
 The successful bidder will be notified by mail or otherwise that the bid has been accepted and that the bidder
 has been awarded the Contract.
 3.03
 
 Retention of Proposal Guaranty.
 
 The two lowest Bidders shall keep their bids open for at least 30 days after the opening of bids, or, for projects
 requiring concurrence by the FHWA, or other Agencies, for at least 45 days after the opening of bids. The Proposal
 guaranties of the two lowest Bidders will be retained until after execution of the Contract, prior to which, however,
 either Bidder may substitute a bid bond, cash or certified check (or cashier's or treasurer's check), all as described in
 Subsection 2.06, for the guaranty already deposited with the Supervisor of Fiscal Management of the Department. The
 Department will endeavor to return the Proposal guaranties of all Bidders other than the two lowest Bidders within three
 days after the opening of bids.
 After the bid has been kept open for the required number of days the low Bidder may withdraw his/her bid and
 request the return of his/her proposal guaranty, in which case the guaranty of both the two lowest Bidders will be
 returned and the second lowest Bidder's Proposal shall not be considered for award. After the bid has been kept open for
 the required number of days the second lowest Bidder may withdraw his/her bid and request the return of his proposal
 guaranty, in which case only the proposal guaranty of the second lowest Bidder will be returned.
 3.04
 
 Contract Bonds Required.
 
 A. A Performance Bond in the full amount of the Contract will be required by the Party of the First Part to
 ensure the faithful performance of the Contract, including Subsection 7.18.
 B. A Payment Bond in an amount of the contract price will be required to be furnished by the Contractor to
 the Party of the First Part as security for payment by the Contractor and Subcontractors for labor, materials, rental
 equipment and for such other purposes as are more specifically set forth in General Laws, Chapter 149, Section 29 and
 Chapter 30, Section 39A and all amendments thereto.
 The payment bond referred to in Chapter 149, Section 29 and Chapter 30, Section 39A is the sole security
 under said sections for payment by the Contractor and Subcontractor for labor performed or furnished and materials
 used or employed therein; said security to remain in force until the validity of all such claims shall be established and
 
 I.14
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 finally determined and if determined and established as valid, all such claims shall be paid by the surety.
 The Performance Bond and the Payment Bond shall be in a form satisfactory to the Party of the First Part,
 furnished by a surety company incorporated pursuant to Chapter 175, Section 105 of the General Laws or authorized to
 do business in the Commonwealth under Chapter 175, Section 106 of the General Laws and satisfactory to the awarding
 authority. The name of the agency or agent writing these bonds shall be identified with or on the bond.
 All alterations, extensions of time, extra work and any other changes authorized under these specifications, or
 under any part of the Contract may be made without obtaining the consent of the surety or sureties on the contract bonds.
 3.05
 
 Execution of Contract.
 
 The prepared Contract forms, bond forms and certificate of insurance forms will be sent with the notification of
 award to the successful Bidder who shall execute and deliver the Contract and furnish the required surety to the
 Department within 14 days after the date of the notice of award.
 The Contract shall be in writing. When the Party of the First Part is the Commonwealth, the Contract shall be
 executed in duplicate, one of which duplicates shall be kept by the Department and one delivered to the Contractor.
 When the Party of the First Part is a municipality it shall be executed in triplicate, one of which triplicates shall be kept
 by the municipality, one delivered to the Department, and one delivered to the Contractor.
 3.06
 
 Failure to Execute Contract.
 
 Should the successful bidder fail to execute the contract and furnish the bonds and certificate of insurance
 within the time stipulated, the Party of the First Part may, at its option, determine that the Bidder has abandoned the
 Contract and thereupon the Proposal and acceptance shall be null and void. In accordance with Massachusetts General
 Laws, Chapter 30, Section 39M, the guaranty accompanying the Proposal may be retained and collected by the Party of
 the First Part as liquidated damages for the delay and expense caused by the abandonment of the Contract.

 drawings when in the judgment of the Engineer it is necessary, and the alterations shall be made accordingly.
 The Contractor shall accept as full compensation for work performed under an alteration order the contract unit
 prices stipulated in the Contract for the actual quantity of work performed in an acceptable manner.
 4.03
 
 Extra Work (Also see Subsection 4.05).
 
 The Contractor shall do any work not herein otherwise provided for when and as ordered in writing by the
 Engineer, such written order to contain particular reference to this Subsection and to designate the work to be done as
 Extra Work.
 Unless specifically noted in the Extra Work Order, Extra Work will not extend the time of completion of the
 Contract as stipulated in Subsection 8.10, Part F.
 The determination of the Engineer shall be final upon all questions concerning the amount and value of Extra
 Work (except as provided in Subsection 7.16).
 Payment for Extra Work will be provided in Subsection 9.03.

 Changed Conditions.
 In accordance with Chapter 30, Section 39N of the General Laws, as amended, the following paragraph is
 included in its entirety:
 
 I.16
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 If, during the progress of the work, the Contractor or the awarding authority discovers that the actual
 subsurface or latent physical conditions encountered at the site differ substantially or materially from those shown on the
 plans or indicated in the contract documents either the Contractor or the contracting authority may request an equitable
 adjustment in the contract price of the Contract applying to work affected by the differing site conditions. A request for
 such an adjustment shall be in writing and shall be delivered by the party making such claim to the other party as soon as
 possible after such conditions are discovered. Upon receipt of such a claim from a Contractor, or upon its own initiative,
 the contracting authority shall make an investigation of such physical conditions, and, if they differ substantially or
 materially from those shown on the plans or indicated in the contract documents or from those ordinarily encountered
 and generally recognized as inherent in work of the character provided for in the plans and contract documents and are
 of such a nature as to cause an increase or decrease in the cost of performance of the work or a change in the cost of
 performance of the work or a change in the construction methods required for the performance of the work which results
 in an increase or decrease in the cost of the work, the contracting authority shall make an equitable adjustment in the
 contract price and the Contract shall be modified in writing accordingly.
 The filing, investigation and settlement of all claims made under said Chapter and Section shall be as follows:
 (a) The Contractor shall promptly, and before such conditions are disturbed notify the Engineer in writing
 describing in full detail the subsurface or latent physical conditions at the site which the Contractor maintains differ
 substantially or materially from those shown on the plans or indicated in the contract documents. The Engineer shall
 promptly investigate the conditions, and shall promptly submit a written report of his/her findings and determinations to
 the Commission with a copy of the same to the Contractor, and if the Contractor finds that such conditions as have been
 described in detail by the Contractor do exist and in fact do so differ materially or substantially, an equitable adjustment
 shall be made and the Contract modified in writing accordingly. No such claim of the Contractor shall be allowed unless
 the Contractor has given the detailed notice specified, nor shall it be allowed if such conditions are disturbed prior to
 their investigation by the Engineer.
 (b) No adjustment or allowance of any kind except as provided in Subsection 8.10 will be made to the
 Contractor on account of any delay or suspension of work or any portion thereof where the actual subsurface or latent
 physical conditions encountered at the site differ substantially and materially from those shown on the plans or indicated
 in the contract documents.
 (c) No claim will be approved or any adjustment or allowance made on account of encountering subsurface or
 latent physical conditions at that site that differ substantially and materially from those shown on the plans or indicated
 in the contract documents unless such conditions were in existence at the time of the award of the Contract.
 (d) Any dispute concerning a question of fact under this Subsection which is not disposed of by agreement
 shall be decided by the Chief Engineer.
 (e) If as provided in (a) of this Subsection an equitable adjustment is to be made or contemplated, the
 Contractor shall submit promptly in writing to the Engineer an itemized statement of the details and amount of work
 together with his/her estimated costs for the same and the Engineer shall require the Contractor to keep actual costs and
 certify the same to the Department in writing.
 If the Contractor and the Department fail to agree on an equitable adjustment to be made under this Subsection,
 then the Contractor shall accept as full payment for the work in dispute an amount equal to the following:
 (1) The actual cost for direct labor, materials and use of equipment, plus 10 percent of this total for overhead.
 (2) Plus actual cost of Workmen's Compensation and Liability Insurance, Health, Welfare and Pension
 benefits, Social Security deductions, Employment Security Benefits and such additional fringe benefits which the
 Contractor is required to pay as a result of Union Labor Agreements and/or is required by authorized governmental
 agencies.
 (3) Plus 10 percent of the total of (1) and (2).
 (4) Plus the estimated proportionate cost of surety bonds. For work performed by a Subcontractor, the
 Contractor shall accept as full payment therefor an amount equal to the actual cost to the Contractor of such work as
 determined by the Engineer plus 10 percent of such cost.
 No allowance shall be made for general superintendence and the use of small tools and manual equipment.
 The Contractor shall, when requested by the Engineer, furnish itemized statements of the cost of the work
 ordered and give the Engineer access to all accounts, bills and vouchers relating thereto, and unless the Contractor shall
 furnish all such itemized statements, access to all accounts, bills and vouchers, the Contractor shall not be entitled to
 payment for any items of extra work for which such information is sought by the Engineer.
 Pending final decision of any dispute hereunder unless otherwise ordered by the Chief Engineer, the Contractor
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 I.17
 
 shall proceed diligently with the performance of the Contract and in accordance with the Chief Engineer's decision.
 The Contract shall be considered modified in writing by the processing of an Extra Work Order.
 The Contractor shall be estopped to rely on and deemed to waive under said Section 39N and this Subsection
 his/her right to have an equitable adjustment of a unit price bid by him/her which, in the opinion of the Chief Engineer, is
 an unrealistic unit price, abnormally low for the unit item priced and which does not reflect the actual cost of performing
 such unit item of work. It shall be the obligation of the Chief Engineer to notify the Contractor prior to award of the
 Contract of any unit price that has been determined to be abnormally low for the unit item priced and that the unrealistic
 low unit price not reflecting the actual cost of performing such unit item of work would bar the Contractor from an
 equitable adjustment under said Section 39N and this Subsection.
 Any unit item price determined by the Chief Engineer to be an unrealistically high unit price not reflecting the
 actual cost of performing such unit item of work is subject to the provisions of said Section 39N and this Subsection.
 The provisions of Section 39N of Chapter 30 of the General Laws, as amended, do not apply to:
 (1) Construction Contracts entered into on behalf of the Commonwealth which provide that payments for the
 work be made on a lump sum basis.
 (2) Construction Contracts entered into on behalf of a municipality under the provisions of Section 34,
 Chapter 90 of the General Laws.
 4.05
 
 Validity of Extra Work.
 
 The Engineer shall be authorized to issue Extra Work Orders for such additional work outside the scope of the
 original Contract as in his/her judgment is reasonably necessary for the satisfactory completion of the project provided
 that the work to be done under such an Extra Work Order, either standing alone or in conjunction with any previously
 authorized Extra Work Order, shall not result in a change of such magnitude as to be incompatible with the provisions of
 Chapter 29, Section 20A and Chapter 149, Section 44J of the General Laws.
 4.06
 
 Increased or Decreased Contract Quantities.
 
 The Department reserves the right to increase or decrease the quantity of any particular item of Work.
 Where the quantity of a Unit Price pay item in this Contact is an estimated quantity and where the actual
 quantity of such pay item varies more than twenty-five (25) percent above or below the estimated quantity stated in this
 Contract, an equitable adjustment in the Contract Price for that pay item shall be negotiated upon demand of either party.
 The equitable adjustment shall be strictly based upon any increase or decrease due solely to the variation above one
 hundred twenty-five (125) percent or below seventy-five (75) percent of the estimated quantity. In this regard, no
 allowances will be made for loss of anticipated profits suffered or claimed by the Contractor resulting directly or
 indirectly from such increased or decreased quantities or from unbalanced allocation among the contract items from any
 other cause.
 4.07
 
 Maintenance of Detours.
 
 A. Where the Department authorizes or directs general traffic from a travelled way to be detoured over Town
 or City streets, the Department will be responsible for maintenance of such detours and placing them in the equivalent
 condition they were in prior to general traffic being detoured over same. The Contractor shall do all work required
 hereunder as directed by the Engineer.
 Payment for such work shall be made as specified in Subsection 9.03, Payment for Extra Work.
 B. Where a Contractor uses public roads or streets as haul roads, unless the road is properly posted for
 tonnage limitations, the Contractor has a legal right to use such roads or streets if his/her vehicles are properly registered.
 C. Inferred or alleged overloading, causing either excessive mass beyond registered capacity, or spillage is a
 Police matter for the local authorities.
 D. Where a Contractor uses a private way for hauling, it is a matter between the Contractor and the owners of
 the private way.
 E. It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to ascertain whether haul routes are over accepted public or
 private ways prior to using same for hauling purposes and it is his/her further responsibility to ascertain if any have
 posted legal mass limitations or other restrictions and to abide by them.

 Removal and Disposal of Structures and Obstructions.
 
 Existing structures such as bridges, culverts or drainage pipes found within the location lines, which are to be
 replaced or rendered useless by new construction shall be removed by the Contractor at his/her own expense unless
 otherwise provided in these specifications or in the Special Provisions. When their location is such as not to interfere
 with the work, the removal shall not be done until the new structures replacing them are ready for traffic or other
 purpose for which the replaced structures are designed, or until the Engineer shall permit.
 All material in the above mentioned types of existing structures requiring removal shall remain the property of
 the owner. The material shall be removed without damage, in sections which will permit easy handling and disposal, to
 locations within the limits of the project, and convenient for their subsequent removal by the owner, or as directed by the
 Engineer.
 Unless otherwise provided the material from any existing structure may be used temporarily by the Contractor
 during construction. Such material may not be cut, bent, broken or otherwise damaged. All discarded material, rubbish,
 or debris shall be removed from the work and disposed of as directed. No foreign material or debris shall be permitted
 to remain or move in a waterway.
 4.09
 
 Rights in the Use of Materials Found on the Work.
 
 The Contractor, with the prior written approval of the Engineer, may take suitable ledge, gravel, sand, loam,
 clay or other material from within the location lines of the project under construction and use it on the same project for
 other purposes than for forming embankments. If such use necessitates securing additional material for forming
 embankments, the Contractor shall replace at his/her own expense material of a satisfactory quality. (See Section 120.)
 The Contractor shall not excavate or remove any material which is not within the excavation as indicated by the slope
 stakes and grade lines without written approval. No excavated material for use shall be wasted unless otherwise
 directed.
 Nothing in the Contract shall be construed as vesting in the Contractor any right of property in the materials
 used after they have been attached or affixed to the work or the soil; but all such materials shall, upon being so attached
 or affixed, become the property of the Party of the First Part.
 4.10
 
 Final Cleaning Up.
 
 Upon completion of the work and before acceptance and final payment, the Contractor shall remove and
 dispose of in an approved manner, at his/her own expense, from the right-of-way, construction site, dredging site and
 adjoining property, all temporary structures and all surplus materials and rubbish which the Contractor may have
 accumulated during the prosecution of the work, and shall leave the areas in a neat and orderly condition.
 No equipment or material shall be left within any of the aforementioned areas after acceptance of the Contract
 without the written permission of the Engineer. The Contractor shall not abandon any material at or near the site
 regardless of whether or not it has any value.

 SECTION 5.00
 CONTROL OF WORK
 5.01
 
 Authority of the Engineer.
 
 The Engineer shall decide all questions which may arise as to the interpretation of the plans and specifications,
 and the Engineer may alter, adjust and approve same when necessary; all questions which may arise as to the quality,
 quantity, value and acceptability of materials furnished or to be furnished and work performed or to be performed; all
 questions which may arise as to the progress of the work and need for and manner of correcting same, and also the need
 for and terms of delays and suspensions; all questions relating to the need for and terms of extra work; all questions
 relating to the supervision, control and direction of work on the site and the use thereof; all questions as to the acceptable
 fulfillment of the Contract on the part of the Contractor.
 5.02
 
 Plans and Detail Drawings.
 
 Approved plans, profiles and sections on file in the office of the Department will show the location, details and
 dimensions of the highway, bridges and other work contemplated, and all work shall be in conformity therewith and with
 the specifications.
 Supplemental plans and detail drawings as required in the specifications and furnished by the Contractor or the
 Department shall upon approval, become part of the complete plans. Supplemental plans for temporary structures, steel
 sheeting, cofferdams, sign and traffic supports, etc., the original design for which is the responsibility of the Contractor,
 shall bear the seal of a Professional Engineer registered in Massachusetts.
 Such approval by the Engineer of supplemental plans or detail drawings, however, shall not operate to relieve
 the Contractor of any of his/her responsibility under the Contract nor for errors in dimensions, details or quantities or for
 nonconformance with details of the original approved design. Any work done or materials ordered for the structures
 involved prior to the approval of supplemental plans and detail drawings shall be at the Contractor's own risk.
 Nothing in the above shall be construed to hold the Contractor liable for the design of any of the permanent
 structures.
 When submitting detail drawings for approval, complete sets of prints as directed shall be furnished the
 Engineer who will return one set either approved or with corrections marked thereon. Finally, the Contractor shall
 furnish the Engineer with complete sets of prints as directed of the corrected and approved detail drawings. No changes
 shall be made in the approved drawing without the written consent of the Engineer.
 All computations, shop drawings, design plans and other criteria submitted to the Department for review and
 approval shall be stamped by a Professional Engineer registered in Massachusetts.
 The shop drawings, other than Department Standards, which do not contain original design shall be stamped by
 a Professional Engineer registered in Massachusetts as an indication of compliance with the design or appropriate
 standards, but shall not be construed as indicating any responsibility for the original design.
 Detail drawings will not be accepted from other than approved suppliers as noted in Subsection 6.01.
 The Contractor, upon completion of the work shall submit to the Engineer a 35 mm microfilm copy of each
 structural steel detail drawing, which shall become the property of the Department. For all overhead and cantilever sign
 structures and all steel mast arm assemblies, the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer one (1) silver master aperture
 card and one (1) diazo duplicate of each shop drawing. All microfilm shall be prepared in accordance with the
 instructions of the Department's Microfilm section.
 The contract prices shall include the cost of furnishing all detail drawings and microfilms and the Contractor
 will be allowed no extra compensation therefor.
 
 5.03
 
 Conformity with Plans and Specifications.
 
 I.20
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 Attention is directed to Chapter 30, Section 39I which provides that no wilful and substantial deviation from
 plans and specifications shall be made unless authorized in writing by the awarding authority or by the Engineer in
 charge of the work who is duly authorized by the awarding authority to approve such deviation. This act further
 provides that in order to avoid delays in the prosecution of the work, such deviation may be authorized by a written
 order of the awarding authority, or such Engineer as is authorized to approve such deviation, and that within 30 days
 thereafter such written order shall be confirmed by a certificate of the awarding authority.
 All work performed and all materials furnished shall be in reasonably close conformity with the lines, grades,
 cross sections, dimensions, details, gradations, physical and chemical characteristics of materials and other specific
 requirements of the Contract. Where the terms "in conformity with", "in agreement with", "in compliance with" or terms
 of like exactness occur in these specifications they shall be construed to mean "in reasonably close conformity with".
 Where definite tolerances are specified in the Contract, such tolerances shall fix the limits of reasonably close
 conformity. Where tolerances are not specified in the Contract, the Engineer will determine the limits of reasonably
 close conformity in each individual case and his/her decision shall be final and conclusive and mutually accepted by all
 parties.
 In the event the Engineer finds the materials or the finished product in which the materials are used not within
 reasonably close conformity with the plans and specifications but that reasonably acceptable work has been produced,
 the Engineer shall then make a determination if the work shall be accepted and remain in place. In this event, the
 Engineer will document the basis of acceptance by contract modification which will provide for an appropriate
 adjustment in the contract price for such work or materials as the Engineer deems necessary to conform to his/her
 determination based on engineering judgment, and in accordance with current construction practices.
 In the event the Engineer finds the materials or the finished product in which the materials are used or the work
 performed are not in reasonably close conformity with the plans and specifications and have resulted in an inferior or
 unsatisfactory product, the work or materials shall be removed and replaced or otherwise corrected by and at the expense
 of the Contractor.
 Deviations from the approved plans and working drawings, that may be required by the need of the
 construction, will be determined by the Engineer and authorized by the Engineer in writing.
 5.04
 
 Coordination of Special Provisions, Plans, Supplemental Specifications
 and Standard Specifications.
 
 The Special Provisions, Plans (including Departmental Standards), Supplemental Specifications, Standard
 Specifications and all supplementary documents are essential parts of the Contract, and a requirement occurring in one is
 as binding as though occurring in all. They are intended to be complementary and to describe and provide for a
 complete work. In the event of any discrepancy between the drawing and figures written thereon, the figures, unless
 obviously incorrect, are to govern over scaled dimensions. In the case of any discrepancy between the plans and the
 specifications, the plans are to govern. If there is a discrepancy between these Standard Specifications and
 Supplemental Specifications, the Supplemental Specifications are to govern. Special Provisions shall govern over
 Supplemental Specifications, plans and Standard Specifications.
 The Contractor shall take no advantage of any apparent error or omission in the plans or specifications. In the
 event the Contractor discovers such an error or omission, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Engineer. The
 Engineer will then make such corrections and interpretations as may be deemed necessary for fulfilling the intent of the
 Contract.
 5.05
 
 Cooperation by Contractor.
 
 The Contractor will be given three copies of full size approved contract drawings, detail sheets and contract
 specifications (except Standard Specifications).
 The Contractor shall purchase any required Standard Specifications from the Department. The Contractor may
 request and the Engineer may approve furnishing additional copies of contract drawings either full or half-size at the
 Contractor's expense. The Contractor shall have one copy of all such information and a copy of the Standard
 Specifications on the work site and available for reference at all times during the prosecution of the work. The
 Contractor shall have on the work at all times, as his/her agent, a competent superintendent or foreman capable of
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 I.21
 
 reading and thoroughly understanding the plans and specifications and thoroughly experienced in the type of work being
 performed, authorized to receive orders and to act for him/her.
 Whenever the Contractor is not present on any part of the work, if it is necessary or desirable that directions be
 given, such directions or orders will be given by the Engineer and they shall be received and executed by the foreman or
 superintendent who is in charge of the particular work with reference to which the orders are given.
 The Contractor shall provide all reasonable facilities to enable the Engineer to make necessary measurements
 and to inspect the workmanship and materials entering into the work. The Contractor shall cooperate in the matter of
 setting and preserving stakes, bench marks, etc., for controlling the work.
 The Contractor shall so carry on his/her work under the direction of the Engineer that Public Service
 Corporations, or Municipal Departments may enter on the work to make changes in their structures or to place new
 structures and connections therewith without interference, and the Contractor shall have no claim for, or on account of
 any delay which may be due to or result from said work of Public Service Corporations or Municipal Departments. No
 allowance of any kind will be made except as provided in Subsection 8.10. Nothing contained herein shall be construed
 to hold the Contractor responsible for any acts or omissions by such Public Service Corporations, Municipal
 Departments or their Contractors.
 5.06
 
 Adjacent Contracts.
 
 The Department reserves the right at any time to contract for and perform other or additional work on or near
 the work covered by the Contract. The intent of this section is to provide for the cooperation of Contractors in cases
 where the Department deems it expedient or necessary and in the best interest of the Commonwealth to let a separate
 Contract for the performance of other work on or near the same project location as the work being performed under the
 Contract, but it is not intended to indicate any intention on the part of the Department to let a separate Contract for any
 work within the scope of or necessary for the successful completion of the Contract.
 When separate Contracts are let within the limits of any one project (either prior to award of Contract, or as
 specified in project proposal, or as specified above), each Contractor shall conduct his/her work so as not to interfere
 with or hinder the progress or completion of the work being performed by other Contractors. Contractors working on
 the same project shall cooperate with each other as directed.
 Each Contractor involved shall assume all liability, financial or otherwise, in connection with his/her Contract
 and shall protect and save harmless the Department from any and all damage or claims that may arise because of
 inconvenience, delay, or loss experienced by him/her because of the presence and operations of other Contractors
 working within the limits of the same project. No allowance of any kind will be made except as provided in Subsection
 8.10.
 The Contractor shall arrange his/her work and shall place and dispose of the materials being used so as not to
 interfere with the operations of the other Contractors within the limits of the same project. The Contractor shall join
 his/her work with that of the others in an acceptable manner and shall perform it in proper sequence to that of the others.
 5.07
 
 Construction (Stakes) Stakings.
 
 The Department will furnish the following survey work:
 A. Establishment of base lines or centerlines of construction for main roadways, ramps, service roads, side
 streets and other major dry land items. Reproduction of base lines and centerlines, or lines offset to them when roadway
 cuts and fills have been completed. Levels may be taken on the points marking these lines.
 B. General bench mark control for the project.
 C. Original grade stakes at 20 meter intervals.
 D. Preliminary and final surveys of pits (if borrow is paid by pit measure) and dredging areas, semifinal cross
 sections on ledge, peat, loam, etc.
 E. Control for structure, which shall consist of range lines on centerline of bearings or centerline of piers, face
 of abutments and wingwalls, horizontal and vertical control for beam seats, along with bench marks close to structures
 for vertical control. Structures shall include but shall not be limited to bridges, culverts, dams, buildings and walls.
 F. Control for alignment of curbing or edging on ramps and at other complicated locations.
 G. Bound points and sideline stakes.
 
 I.22
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 H. All necessary stakes for pipes and head walls, and establish all catch basin and manhole locations as to line
 and grade.
 The Contractor shall employ qualified engineering personnel to insure adequate control and shall furnish and
 set stakes of the quality used by the Department for control staking. Rough stakes may be used to denote top and bottom
 of slopes, edge of pavement, gutter lines, etc.
 The Contractor shall furnish and set, at his/her own expense, all remaining stakes (such as batter boards, slope
 stakes, pins, offset stakes, etc.) required for the construction operations and the Contractor shall be solely responsible for
 the accuracy of the line and grade of all features of his/his/her work.
 The Contractor shall be held responsible for the preservation of all stakes and marks placed by the Engineer. If
 any of such stakes or marks are disturbed or destroyed by the Contractor the cost of replacing them shall be deducted
 from the payment for the work as stipulated in Subsection 9.05.
 5.08
 
 Authority and Duties of Engineer's Assistants.
 
 The Engineer may appoint such assistants and representatives as desired and they shall be authorized to inspect
 work and materials, to give directions pertaining to the work or to the safety and convenience of the public, to approve
 or reject materials, to make measurements of quantities and to perform such other duties as may be designated by the
 Engineer.
 In case of any dispute arising between the Contractor and the Engineer's assistants, as to materials furnished or
 the manner of performing the work, the Engineer's assistants shall have the authority to reject the materials or to suspend
 the work until the question at issue can be referred to and decided by the Engineer.
 Engineer's assistants are not authorized to revoke, alter, enlarge, relax or release any requirements of these
 specifications nor to issue instructions contrary to the plans and specifications.
 In no case shall the Engineer's assistants act as foremen or perform other duties for the Contractor.
 5.09
 
 Inspection of Work.
 
 All materials and each part or detail of the work shall be subject to inspection by the Engineer. The Engineer
 shall be allowed access to all parts of the work and shall be furnished with such information and assistance by the
 Contractor as is required to make a complete and detailed inspection , (such assistance may include furnishing labor,
 boats, tools, equipment, etc., at no expense to the Department).
 If the Engineer so requests, the Contractor, at any time before acceptance of the work, shall remove or uncover
 such portions of the finished work as may be directed. After examination, the Contractor shall restore said portions of
 the work to the standard required by the specifications. Should the work thus exposed or examined prove acceptable,
 the uncovering, or removing, and the replacing of the covering or making good of the parts removed will be paid for as
 extra work; but should the work so exposed or examined prove unacceptable, the uncovering or removing and the
 replacing of the covering or making good of the parts removed, will be at the Contractor's expense.
 Any work done or materials used without authorization by the Engineer may be ordered removed and replaced
 at the Contractor's expense.
 The Contractor shall furnish written information to the Engineer stating the original sources of supply of all
 materials manufactured away from the actual site of the work. In order to insure a proper time sequence for required
 inspection and approval this information shall be furnished at least two weeks (or as otherwise directed by the Engineer)
 in advance of the incorporation in the work of any such materials. The Department strongly encourages the use of
 recycled products, provided the manufacturer of the product stipulates that such product meets or exceeds the
 performance standards for the intended use of said product. The Contractor must identify wherever recycled products
 are to be used.
 For the purpose of observing work that affects their respective properties, inspectors for the municipalities,
 public agencies and the utility companies shall be permitted access to the work, but all official orders and directives to
 the Contractor will be issued by the Engineer.
 Such inspection shall in no sense make any unit of government or political subdivision a party to this Contract,
 and shall in no way interfere with the rights of either party hereunder.
 The inspection of the work shall not relieve the Contractor of any of his/her obligations to fulfill the terms of
 the Contract as herein prescribed by the plans and specifications.
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 I.23
 
 Failure to reject any defective work or materials shall not in any way prevent later rejection when such defect is
 discovered, nor obligate the Department to make final acceptance.
 The Contractor shall give prior notice to the Engineer when work on the various items is to be performed by
 him/her or his/her Subcontractors. If work is suspended on any item, prior notice shall be given to the Engineer before
 resumption of such work. Except in case of an unforeseen emergency, neither the Contractor nor any Subcontractor
 shall perform any work requiring inspection at hours other than during the normal work day without prior approval of
 the Engineer.
 5.10
 
 Removal of Defective or Unauthorized Work.
 
 All defective work shall be removed, repaired or made good, notwithstanding that such work has previously
 been inspected and approved or estimated for payment. If the work or any part thereof shall be found defective at any
 time before the final acceptance of the whole work, the Contractor shall at his/her own expense make good such defect
 in a satisfactory manner.
 Any work done beyond the lines and grades shown on the plans or as given, except as herein provided, or any
 extra work done without authority, shall be considered as unauthorized and at the expense of the Contractor. Such work
 will not be measured nor compensation allowed therefor. Work so done may be ordered removed at the Contractor's
 expense.
 Upon failure of the Contractor to remove and satisfactorily dispose of any or all defective or unauthorized
 work, and to remedy the same after being so notified, the Engineer may cause such defective work to be remedied,
 removed and replaced; and such unauthorized work to be removed, and to deduct the costs therefor from any moneys
 due or to become due the Contractor.
 5.11
 
 Final Acceptance (Also see Subsections 7.20 and 9.05)
 
 Upon due notice from the Contractor by certified mail of presumptive completion of the entire project, the
 Engineer will make an inspection. If all construction provided for and contemplated by the Contract is found completed
 to his/her satisfaction, that inspection shall constitute the final inspection and the Chief Engineer shall in writing make
 acceptance of the physical work, which acceptance shall relieve the Contractor from further responsibility only with
 respect to the physical work. Subsequent to the final acceptance of the physical work and upon compliance with the
 terms of the Contract relating to submission of contractually required reports or other documents, the Engineer will
 recommend final acceptance of the Contract to the Board of Commissioners (see Subsection 9.05).
 If the work or any part thereof is not acceptable to the Engineer at the time of the inspection, the Contractor
 will be notified in writing of the particular defects or parts to be remedied before final acceptance. If the Contractor has
 not arranged within a period of five days after the date of transmittal of such notice of nonacceptability, to complete the
 work speedily as described by the Engineer, the Engineer may without further notice and without in any way affecting
 the Contract make such other arrangements as may be considered necessary to insure the satisfactory completion of the
 project. The cost of so completing the work shall be deducted from any moneys due or which may become due the
 Contractor under the Contract.
 After the Contractor has finished installing the controller and all other associated traffic signal control
 equipment and after the Contractor has set the signal equipment to operate as specified in the contract documents, the
 fine tuning, adjusting and testing period shall begin. During this period, the Contractor, under the direction of the
 Engineer and with the cooperation of the local community representatives, if applicable, will make necessary
 adjustments and tests to ensure safe and efficient operation of the equipment. This period shall not last for more than 30
 days, and the contract completion date has taken this testing period into consideration. No request for final acceptance
 will be considered until successful completion of the testing period.

 SECTION 6.00
 CONTROL OF MATERIALS
 6.01
 
 Source of Supply and Quality.
 
 If the Engineer so desires, materials may be approved at the source of supply before delivery is started.
 The Department reserves the right to require approval of the source of supply for any material to be
 incorporated into the work prior to delivery or manufacture.
 The Engineer reserves the right to prohibit the use of materials, products or components which in his/her
 opinion may be supplied in a manner not reasonably consistent with contract requirements.
 The determination of the Engineer shall be final upon all questions which pertain to supplier approval.
 Fabricators of structural steel, miscellaneous steel, and aluminum products must be on the Department’s
 approved fabricators list, as noted in Subsection 960.61, prior to the bid opening date. Only approved fabricators will be
 allowed to perform work for the Department.
 Unless otherwise stipulated in the Special Provisions, the Contractor shall furnish all materials required for the
 work specified in the Contract, and said materials shall meet the requirements of the specifications for the kind of work
 involving their use.
 Chapter 7, Section 22, Clause 17, of the General Laws, as amended, shall apply to the purchase by the
 Contractor of supplies and materials to be used in the execution of this Contract.
 The rules referred to require a preference in the purchase of supplies and materials, other considerations being
 equal, in favor first, of supplies and materials manufactured and sold within the Commonwealth, and second, of supplies
 and materials manufactured and sold within the United States. On Federal Aid Projects the following shall also apply:
 No requirements shall be imposed and no procedure shall be enforced by any State in connection with a project
 which may operate to require the use or provide a price differential in favor of articles or materials produced within the
 State, or otherwise to prohibit, restrict or discriminate against the use of articles or materials shipped from or prepared,
 made or produced in any State, territory or possession of the United States.
 In Contracts requiring structural steel, the Contractor shall furnish approved erection procedures to the
 inspector of structural materials at the source of supply or site of fabrication. The inspector shall not stamp his/her
 approval or release material for shipment until such approved procedures are received.
 Unless otherwise provided, only new and first quality materials conforming to the requirements of these
 specifications and approved by the Engineer shall be used in the work, except for material used by the Contractor for
 his/her convenience and which is not to be incorporated in the permanent work.
 If, after test(s), it is found that sources of supply which have been approved do not furnish a uniform product,
 or if the product from such source proves unacceptable at any time, the Contractor shall, at his/her own expense, take
 any and all steps necessary to furnish approved materials.
 Where no inspection of materials is arranged for by the Party of the First Part and before such materials are
 incorporated into the work, the Contractor shall submit to the Party of the First Part for approval, three notarized copies
 of the Manufacturer’s or Supplier’s statement for each kind of material furnished, which shall certify compliance with
 the specifications and shall contain the following information:
 1. Contract Number, City or Town, Name of Road and Federal Aid Number.
 2. Name of the Contractor to which the material is supplied.
 3. Kind of material supplied.
 4. Quantity of material represented by the certificate.
 5. Means of identifying the consignment, such as label, marking, seal number, etc.
 6. Date and method of shipment.
 7. Statement to the effect that the material has been tested and found in conformity with the pertinent parts of
 the Contract.
 8. Results of all required tests including the chemical analysis in the case of metal: or in lieu of furnishing the
 results a statement that results of all required tests pertinent to the certificate and not submitted shall be maintained
 available by the undersigned for a period of not less than three years from date of final acceptance or not less than three
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 I.25
 
 years from date of final payment to the State from Federal Funds (whichever period is the longest shall apply).
 9. Signature of a person having legal authority to bind the supplier.
 If the Contractor has new materials purchased for use on a previous Department Contract which have never
 been used and which comply with the specifications, these materials may be furnished and used provided the Contractor
 submits his/her own sworn statement certifying that such materials were purchased for use on a previous Contract
 (naming and identifying such Contract) and that certificates of compliance were furnished for such materials on the
 previous Contract, to which reference can be made.
 Any cost involved in furnishing the certificate shall be borne by the Contractor.
 6.02
 
 Samples and Tests.
 
 The inspection and sampling of materials will be carried out, ordinarily, at the source or at the site of the
 Contract work in accordance with established policies and procedures of the Department; but the Department will not
 assume any obligation for the inspection and sampling of materials at the source. The responsibility of incorporating
 satisfactory material in the work rests entirely with the Contractor, notwithstanding any prior inspection or test.
 Tests of materials will be made by the Department or under its direction in accordance with the Standards of
 the test as designated. The Contractor or his/her suppliers shall furnish such facilities as the Engineer may require for
 collecting and forwarding samples, and shall not make use of, nor incorporate in the work, any material represented by
 the samples until the required tests have been made and the material accepted, unless otherwise directed. The
 Contractor in all cases shall furnish the required samples without charge.
 Materials such as crushed stone, gravel borrow, ordinary borrow, etc., will be sampled at the source and
 approved for use. However, such preliminary approval by the Engineer does not relieve the Contractor of the
 responsibility for placing satisfactory material in the work as determined by subsequent samples taken at the source or
 on the project prior to the material being incorporated into the work and if the project samples test satisfactorily the
 material will be considered to meet the Contract requirements as to quality. If such sampling and testing reveal that the
 material is unsatisfactory it will then be the responsibility of the Contractor to remove it from the work or blend it with
 such other materials so that an acceptable material will be produced. The removal and blending of such material shall be
 done by the Contractor without additional compensation.
 6.03
 
 Delivery and Storage of Materials.
 
 Materials and equipment shall be progressively delivered at the site so that there will be neither delay in the
 progress of the work nor an accumulation of materials that is not to be used within a reasonable time.
 Materials shall be so stored as to assure the preservation of their quality and fitness for the work. Stored
 materials, even though approved before storage, may again be inspected prior to their use in the work. Stored materials
 shall be located so as to facilitate their prompt inspection. Approved portions of the right-of-way may be used for
 storage purposes and for the placing of the Contractor’s plant and equipment, but any additional space required therefor
 must be provided by the Contractor at his/her expense. Private property shall not be used for storage purposes without
 written permission of the owner or lessee, and if requested by the Engineer copies of such written permission shall be
 furnished to him/her. All storage sites shall be restored to their original condition by the Contractor at his/her expense.
 This shall not apply to the stripping and storing of topsoil, or to other materials salvaged from the work.
 6.04
 
 Defective Materials.
 
 Materials not conforming to these specifications shall be rejected and removed from the work by the
 Contractor as directed. No rejected material, the defects of which have been subsequently corrected, shall be used
 except with the permission of the Engineer. Should the Contractor fail to remove defective material within the time
 indicated in writing, the Engineer shall have the authority to remove and replace the defective material, and the cost of
 such removal and replacement will be deducted from any moneys due or to become due the Contractor.

 Prevention of Water Pollution – Sanitary Provisions.
 
 A. General.
 The Contractor shall exercise every reasonable precaution to prevent or minimize the silting of rivers, streams
 or water impoundments during actual construction and periods when the work may be temporarily suspended. Similar
 precautionary measures shall be taken with respect to temporary roads and access roads to borrow pits. This work shall
 also consist of temporary control measures ordered by the Engineer during the life of the Contract to control water
 pollution, through use of berms, dikes, dams, sediment basins, crushed stone, gravel, mulches, grasses, waterways, and
 other erosion control devices or methods.
 The temporary pollution control provisions contained herein shall be coordinated with the permanent erosion
 control features specified elsewhere in the Contract to the extent practical to assure economical, effective and continuous
 erosion control throughout the construction and post-construction period.
 B. Schedule of Work.
 At the preconstruction conference, the Contractor shall submit for acceptance and approval his/her procedure
 
 I.28
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 for the accomplishment of temporary erosion control work, and his/her schedule for the accomplishment of permanent
 erosion control work for all applicable phases of construction.
 Since circumstances may require that certain pollution control work be done as promptly as possible, the
 Contractor’s procedure must indicate his/her ability with men, equipment and material to take the necessary action.
 C. Borrow Pits, Haul Roads and Disposal Areas.
 Prior to entering or constructing haul roads or opening any borrow pit or waste disposal area, the Contractor
 shall submit his/her work plan for erosion control of such roads, pits or disposal areas. No work shall be started until the
 erosion control program and methods of operation have been accepted and are approved by the Engineer.
 Wherever practicable so to do, unless objection thereto is made by the borrow pit owner, the Contractor shall
 save sufficient good topsoil from the excavated area and use it in establishing a vegetative cover which will blend the pit
 area into the surrounding landscape when the work on the project is completed. Vegetative cover will be similarly
 established in areas where waste material is placed. (See also Subsection 150.21 Borrow Pit Restrictions).
 D. Construction Requirements.
 The Engineer has the authority to limit the surface area of erodible earth material exposed by clearing and
 grubbing or excavation, borrow and fill operations and to direct the Contractor to provide immediate permanent or
 temporary pollution control measures to prevent contamination of adjacent streams or other watercourses, lakes, ponds
 or areas of water impoundment. Such work may involve the construction of temporary berms, dikes, dams, sediment
 basins, waterways, and use of temporary mulches, seeding or other control devices or methods as necessary to control
 erosion. All slopes shall be seeded and mulched as the earthwork proceeds to the extent considered desirable as
 practicable.
 Where erosion is likely to be a problem, clearing and grubbing operations should be so scheduled and
 performed that grading operations and permanent erosion control features can follow immediately thereafter if the
 project conditions permit; otherwise temporary erosion control measures will be required between successive
 construction stages.
 The Engineer will limit the area of excavation, borrow and embankment operations in progress commensurate
 with the Contractor’s capability in keeping the finish grading, mulching, seeding and other such permanent pollution
 control measures current in accordance with the accepted schedule. Should seasonal limitations make such coordination
 unrealistic, temporary erosion control measures shall be taken immediately to the extent feasible and justified.
 If, in the judgment of the Engineer, the surface area of erodible earth material exposed has the potential for
 causing water pollution, the Engineer shall direct the Contractor to cease the applicable operations until satisfactory
 temporary or permanent erosion control measures are taken. In the event of conflict between these requirements and
 pollution control laws, rules or regulations of other Federal or State or local agencies, the more restrictive laws, rules or
 regulations shall apply.
 The Contractor will be required to incorporate all permanent erosion control features into the project at the
 earliest practicable time, as outlined in his/her accepted schedule. Temporary pollution control measures will be used to
 correct conditions that develop during construction that were not foreseen during the design stage; that are needed prior
 to installation of permanent pollution control features; or that are needed temporarily to control erosion that develops
 during normal construction practices, but are not associated with permanent control features on the project.
 The Contractor shall take reasonable precaution to prevent grass and brush fires within the work site thereby
 eliminating further sources of erosion due to burned over areas.
 E. Work in or Near Streams, Rivers and Impoundments.
 The fording of streams with equipment shall be kept to a minimum. Where frequent stream crossings are
 contemplated and where fording might create sediment detrimental to fish, wildlife, water supplies or irrigation systems,
 temporary bridges or culverts shall be installed, the cost of which shall be absorbed by the Contractor.
 Unless otherwise approved in writing by the Engineer, construction operations in rivers, streams, and
 impoundments shall be restricted to those areas where channel changes are shown on the plans and to those areas which
 must be entered for the construction of temporary or permanent structures. Rivers, streams and impoundments shall be
 promptly cleared of all falsework, piling, debris, or other obstructions placed therein or caused by the construction
 operations.
 Excavation from the roadway, channel changes, cofferdams, etc., shall not be deposited in or so near to rivers,
 streams, or impoundments that it will be washed away by high water or runoff.
 When the Contractor uses water from natural sources for any of his/her operations, intake methods shall be
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 I.29
 
 such as to avoid contaminating the source of supply and maintain adequate downstream flow when the source is a
 stream.
 Pollutants such as chemicals, fuels, lubricants, bitumens, raw sewage and other harmful waste shall not be
 discharged into or alongside of rivers, streams, impoundments or into natural or man-made channels leading thereto.
 F. Sanitary Provisions.
 The Contractor shall provide and maintain in a neat sanitary condition such accommodations for use of his/her
 employees as may be necessary to comply with the requirements of the Department of Public Health, local health
 officials or other authorities having jurisdiction.
 7.03
 
 Permits and Licenses.
 
 The Contractor shall procure all required permits and licenses, pay all charges, fees and taxes and shall give all
 notices necessary and incidental to the due and lawful prosecution of the work. The cost thereof shall be included in the
 prices bid for the various items listed in the Proposal. Copies of all required permits and licenses shall be filed with the
 Engineer prior to the beginning of work.
 The Contractor’s attention is directed to the provisions of General Laws, Chapter 90, Section 9 as amended, in
 which it is provided that earth-moving motor vehicles which exceed certain dimensions or mass limits as specified in
 said Act, and which are used exclusively for building, repair and maintenance of highways, may be operated without
 registration for a distance not exceeding 270 meters on any way adjacent to any highway or toll road being constructed,
 relocated or improved provided a permit, authorizing such use, to be issued by the Commissioner of Public Works or by
 the Board or officer having charge of such way, has been procured by the Contractor.
 7.04
 
 Motor Vehicles.
 
 All motor vehicles (except vehicles used solely for transporting employee(s) to and from the project) used
 wholly or in part within the Commonwealth by the Contractor or any Subcontractor, or by any person directly or
 indirectly employed by them in the execution of the Contract, shall be registered in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
 and bear Massachusetts registration plates except as stipulated in Subsection 7.03.
 Motor vehicles used solely for transporting employee(s) to and from the project shall be registered as required
 under General Laws, Chapter 90, Section 3, as amended.
 No vehicle shall be driven on any way, as defined in Section 1 of Chapter 90 of the General Laws, unless such
 vehicle is constructed or loaded so as to prevent any of its load from dropping, sifting, leaking, or otherwise escaping
 therefrom, except that sand may be dropped for the purpose of securing traction or water or other substance may be
 sprinkled on such a way in cleaning or maintaining the same (General Laws, Chapter 85, Section 30, as amended).
 
 7.05
 
 Insurance Requirements.
 
 A. Workmen’s Compensation Insurance.
 The Contractor, before commencing performance of the work required to be done under the Contract, shall
 provide for the payment of the compensation provided by Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 152, as amended, to all
 persons to be employed by him/her in connection with the said performance, and the Contractor shall continue in full
 force and effect throughout the period required for the completion of the improvement such insurance as may be
 required under said chapter. The persons for whom compensation is to be provided by such insurance shall include
 those reserve or special police officers employed by the Contractor for the purpose of directing or maintaining traffic or
 other similar purposes within the site of the improvement and paid directly by him/her for such services; they shall not
 include, however, any regular police officers employed for said purpose.
 Failure to provide and continue in force such insurance as aforesaid shall be deemed a material breach of the
 Contract and shall operate as an immediate termination thereof.
 Such insurance shall not be canceled or otherwise terminated until ten (10) days after written notice of
 cancellation or termination is given by the party proposing cancellation to the other party or until notice has been
 received that the employer has secured insurance from another insurance company or has otherwise insured the payment
 
 I.30
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 of compensation provided for by Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 152, as amended. Notice of cancellation sent to
 the party proposing cancellation by registered mail, postage prepaid, with a return receipt of the addressee requested,
 shall be sufficient notice. An affidavit of any officer, agent or employee of the insurer or of the insured, as the case may
 be, duly authorized for the purpose, that he/she has so sent such notice addressed as aforesaid, shall be prima facie
 evidence of sending thereof as aforesaid. This section shall apply to the legal representatives, trustee in bankruptcy,
 receiver, assignee, trustee and the successor in interest of any such Contractor.
 The aforesaid insurance except that required for traffic officers, shall be taken out and maintained with no
 compensation therefor other than that provided by the contract unit prices.
 B. Public Liability Insurance.

 provide that the insurance company shall notify all insured parties and the Department by registered mail at least 30 days
 in advance of termination or any change in the policy.
 7.06
 
 Patented Devices, Materials and Processes.
 
 Whenever the Contractor desires to use any design, device, material, or process covered by letters patent or
 copyright, the right for such use shall be secured by suitable legal agreement with the patentee or owner, and a copy of
 this agreement shall be filed with the Party of the First Part.
 This article shall not be construed as imposing any obligation on the Party of the First Part to see that such
 agreements are secured or filed or complied with. The Contractor shall be solely responsible for the use of any such
 design, device, material or process.
 7.07
 
 Restoration of Surfaces Opened by Permit.
 
 The Contractor shall not allow any party to make an opening in the highway for any purpose except upon the
 direction of the Engineer and the presentation of a duly authorized permit. The holder of such a permit shall be
 considered in the same class as a Contractor on an adjacent project, and the provisions of Subsections 5.05 and 5.06
 shall apply.
 7.08
 Federal Participation (Applicable only to Contracts where the cost
 of any portion thereof is paid out of Federal Funds).
 Attention is directed to the provisions of the Federal Highway Act of November 9, 1921 (42 U.S. Statutes at
 large, page 212) as modified and as extended, and 72 U.S. Statutes at large 885, U.S. Code Title 23, and any other
 provisions of law, or amendments thereto whereby such Federal Participation is authorized, and any regulations properly
 and lawfully promulgated thereunder, under which the United States shall aid the individual states in the construction of
 highways. When the United States Government is to pay any portion of the cost of the project the above act of Congress
 provides that the construction work and labor in each State shall be done in accordance with the laws of that state and
 applicable Federal Laws. The work embraced in this Contract will therefore be subject to such inspection by the Federal
 Highway Administration as may be necessary to meet the above requirements. Such inspection shall however, in no
 sense make the United States Government a party to this Contract, and will in no way interfere with the rights of either
 party hereunder.
 7.09
 
 Public Safety and Convenience.
 
 The Contractor shall at all times, until written acceptance of the physical work by the Chief Engineer, be
 responsible for the protection of the work and shall take all precautions for preventing injuries to persons or damage to
 property on or about the project. If the Contractor constructs temporary bridges or provides temporary crossings of
 streams, his/her responsibility for accidents shall include the roadway and sidewalk approaches as well as the structures
 of such crossings.
 Where the Contract involves dredging, excavation or other construction work in navigable waters, the work
 shall be so conducted as to cause no unnecessary obstruction to the free passage of vessels.
 The decision for routing traffic through or around the work and provisions for the control of same will be made
 
 I.32
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 by the Engineer. Whenever it is deemed advisable, special detours will be provided for truck or bus traffic. On major
 projects and projects in urban areas traffic patterns and schedules will be studied in the design stage and included in the
 Special Provisions.
 Subject to the approval of the Engineer, the Contractor shall schedule the temporary or permanent closing of
 highways to travel only after consultation with the Police Chief and Fire Chief of the municipality or municipalities
 concerned. The temporary closing of highways shall be kept to a minimum.
 When a road or portion thereof is under construction and is closed to through traffic and when detours around
 the work are provided on existing city or town ways, the Contractor shall maintain such city or town ways as required in
 Subsection 4.07 and be compensated as specified in Subsection 4.07.
 Where the new construction coincides with the present traveled way, the Contractor shall carry on his/her work
 in a manner acceptable to the Engineer so that a reasonably safe uninterrupted traffic flow is maintained through the
 project during the entire construction period over traffic lane patterns approved by the Engineer; and the Contractor shall
 provide and maintain in a reasonably safe condition the temporary approaches and the crossings of intersecting
 highways. When grading operations are in progress, each level of excavation or fill shall be graded as near as
 practicable to an even surface so as to provide a satisfactory passageway for the use of traffic.
 The Contractor shall maintain all temporary roadways in a manner which will provide reasonably safe and
 convenient travel. When temporary roadways outside the project limits are abandoned, the surfaces shall be removed
 and all fill graded to a smooth, neat, natural appearance, free from water pockets and as directed by the Engineer.
 Abandoned temporary or existing roads beyond the limits of the main roadway slopes, but within the project
 limits, shall be excavated, graded, loamed and seeded as directed to present a neat, natural appearance and provide for
 proper drainage. Compensation for this work will be included under the respective items of work involved.
 Snow removal on detours or present traveled ways will not be required of the Contractor.
 The Contractor, as directed, shall at all times so conduct the work that the abutters shall have reasonable access
 to their property. When public or private property is isolated by the closure of a road, the Contractor shall be
 responsible for providing such reasonably safe means of access to a public way as the Engineer deems essential and the
 Contractor shall be compensated for all such work directed by the Engineer at the contract unit prices for the type of
 work and materials involved. When it is necessary to leave materials and equipment upon the highway they shall be
 placed so as to cause the least possible obstruction to drainage, pedestrians and other travel.
 When the work in any way affects the operation, management, maintenance, business or traffic on any railroad,
 such work shall be carried on in a manner satisfactory to the said railroad; but all orders, directions or instructions to the
 Contractor relative to work under the Contract will be issued only by the Engineer of the Department. The Contractor
 shall use all possible vigilance in order effectively to guard against all accidents or damages on the railroad due to
 his/her work, and the Contractor shall at all times during the progress of the work so manage and execute the same as to
 cause the least possible interference with the operation, management, business or traffic of the railroad.
 Trenches shall not be opened in traveled ways until all materials and equipment required for the work are at the
 site and available for immediate use. When work is not in progress trenches in areas subject to public travel shall be
 covered with steel plates capable of safely sustaining an MS18 truckload with impact. The work at each trench shall be
 practically continuous, with the placing of conduit and piping, backfilling and patching of the surface closely following
 each preceding operation.
 At the end of each working day where trenches in areas of public travel are covered with steel plates, each edge
 of such plates shall either be bevelled or protected by a slope of 25 millimeters vertically to 600 millimeters horizontally.
 Any temporary patching material may be used to construct the ramps. The cost of necessary patching materials, and
 their maintenance and removal, will be considered incidental to the item involved with no separate payment.
 Pending installation of castings, all structures in travel ways or deemed hazardous by the Engineer shall be
 protected with suitable covers (steel plates or equal) capable of withstanding an MS18 truckload with impact. The cost
 of necessary covers or plates will be considered incidental to the item involved with no separate payment.
 7.10
 
 Barricades and Warning Signs.
 
 The Department may furnish, erect and maintain regulatory, warning and guide signs, traffic control signals,
 markings, safety lighting and any other traffic devices as it deems necessary for the safe flow of traffic during
 construction.
 Highways wholly or partly closed to traffic shall be protected by suitable barricades, barrier fences, traffic signs
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department

 I.33
 
 and other traffic devices, furnished and erected by the Contractor at locations shown on the plans, or as directed, and the
 Contractor shall be compensated therefor in accordance with the contract unit prices for the items of work involved.
 The Contractor shall at his/her own expense provide and erect, acceptable or as directed, barricades, barrier
 fences, traffic signs, and all other traffic devices, not covered in his/her Contract as payment item, to protect the work
 from traffic, pedestrians, or animals. The Contractor shall at his/her own expense provide sufficient temporary lighting
 such as flares, lanterns, or other approved illuminated traffic signs and devices, not covered in his/her Contract as a
 payment item, to afford adequate protection to the traveling public. The Contractor shall also at his/her own expense
 furnish a sufficient number of watchmen at all times to protect the work.
 All barricades, barrier fences, traffic signs and other traffic devices must conform with the Department’s
 manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
 The Contractor shall be held responsible for all damage to the work due to any failure of barricades, barriers,
 warning signs or lights to properly protect the work from traffic, pedestrians or other causes.
 7.11
 
 Traffic Officers and Railroad Flagging Service.
 
 The Contractor shall provide such police officers as the Engineer deems necessary for the direction and control
 of traffic within the site of the improvement. Such officers shall wear regulation policemen’s uniforms. They may be
 reserve or special officers subject to the control of and paid directly by the Contractor; or regular officers not subject to
 the control of the Contractor. Compensation for the services of said regular police officers may be paid by the
 Contractor to their employers, or paid directly by the Contractor to such regular police officers, or paid by the
 Contractor to a designated municipal official, at a patrolman’s rate of pay, subject to all rules and regulations, ordinances
 or by-laws in effect in the city or town in which the work is to be performed.
 The Party of the First Part will reimburse the Contractor for payments made for the services of all required
 traffic officers, together with such payments as the Contractor will have made for reserve or special officers under the
 Massachusetts Workmen’s Compensation Act (General Laws, Chapter 152, Section 1, as amended), Liability Insurance,
 and for payments as the Contractor is required in writing by proper authority to make under the Massachusetts
 Employment Security Act (General Laws, Chapter 151A) and the Federal Social Security Act (United States Code, Title
 26 and 42). The Contractor is required to submit to the Engineer copies of this written requirement for the
 Massachusetts Employment Security Act and the Federal Social Security Act.
 The rates of wages paid by the Contractor to such police officers shall be the same as those paid to police
 officers working on special details. When the Contractor is required to submit weekly certified copies of payroll,
 separate certified copies of payroll covering only such reserve and special police officers shall be submitted containing
 complete payroll information.
 If any of the work required to be done by the Contractor may obstruct the tracks of a railroad or in any way
 endanger the operation of its trains, and the services of a flagman or flagmen or other railroad employees are required by
 the Chief Engineer of the railroad company and men are assigned by him/her for the protection of the property and
 traffic of the Railroad against hazards capable of being caused by the Contractor, the cost of all such flagging services
 shall be borne by the Contractor and no compensation therefor shall be made other than that provided by the contract
 unit prices.
 The Department will reimburse the Contractor for the above costs required by the Railroad when the
 preliminary estimate of bid items for a project is $250,000 or less.
 7.12
 
 Use of Explosives.
 
 When the use of explosives is necessary for the prosecution of the work, the Contractor shall exercise the
 utmost care not to endanger life and property including new work and whenever directed, the number and size of the
 charges shall be reduced. The Contractor shall be responsible for all damage resulting from the use of explosives. All
 explosives shall be stored in a secure manner in conformance with all the State laws and regulations, as well as any local
 requirements; and all such storage places shall be marked – “Dangerous – Explosives”.
 The Contractor shall be required to conform to the regulations of the Massachusetts Department of Public
 Safety concerning storage, handling and use of explosives.
 Prior to start of the blasting, the Contractor shall give at least a 24-hour notice and a schedule of his/her
 operations thereof to the operating official, company, or companies, leasing, owning or responsible for pipes, conduits,
 
 I.34
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 poles, wires, railroad tracks, or any other public or private utility which may be endangered by the blasting in order that
 a representative of said owner or lessee may be present at the site. The Contractor shall take proper precaution to
 prevent injury to said properties during all blasting operations.
 7.13
 
 Protection and Restoration of Property.
 
 The Contractor shall, at his/her own expense, preserve and protect from injury all property either public or
 private along and adjacent to the proposed work, and the Contractor shall be responsible for and repair at his/her own
 expense any and all damage and injury thereto, arising out of or in consequence of any act of omission, neglect or
 misconduct in the execution of the work, or in consequence of the non-execution thereof by the Contractor or his/her
 employees or Subcontractors in the performance of the work covered by the Contract prior to completion and
 acceptance thereof. The Contractor shall exercise special care during his/her operations to avoid injury to underground
 structures such as water or gas mains, pipes, conduits, manholes, catch basins, etc.
 Written notice shall be given by the Contractor to all public service corporations or officials owning or having
 charge of public or private utilities of his/her intention to commence operations affecting such utilities at least 48 hours
 (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) in advance of the start of such operations in accordance with
 Chapter 82, Section 40 of the General Laws, as amended, and the Contractor shall at the same time file a copy of said
 notice with the Engineer.
 When necessary, the Contractor shall cooperate with representatives of public service companies in order to
 avoid damage to their structures by furnishing and erecting suitable supports, props, shoring or other means of
 protection. Fire hydrants adjacent to the work at all times shall be readily accessible to fire apparatus and no material or
 other obstructions shall be placed within a radius of 3 meters of a fire hydrant.
 Although the plans may indicate the approximate location of existing subsurface utilities in the vicinity of the
 work, the accuracy and completeness of the information is not guaranteed by the Department. Before commencing any
 work or operations which may endanger or damage any subsurface structures, the Contractor shall carefully locate all
 such structures and conduct his/her operations in such manner as to avoid damage thereto. The Contractor shall not
 interrupt live services until new services have been provided. All abandoned services shall be plugged or otherwise
 made secure.
 The Contractor shall receive no extra compensation for such work unless said compensation is authorized in
 writing by the Engineer, as specified under Subsection 4.03 for Extra Work (except test pits as directed to be made in
 order to locate existing underground structures).
 If the Contractor wishes to have any utilities temporarily relocated for his/her convenience other than
 contemplated by the Department, the Contractor shall make the necessary arrangement with the owners and make
 reimbursement for the cost thereof at his/her own expense.
 Land monuments and property marks shall be carefully protected and if necessary to remove the same, the
 Contractor shall do so only at the Engineer’s direction and after an authorized agent has witnessed or otherwise
 referenced their location. The Contractor shall not injure or remove trees or shrubs without proper authority. Insofar as
 possible the Contractor shall confine his/her movements and operations to the area within the limits of the location and
 the area outside the scope of the work shall not be disturbed except as directed.
 The Contractor’s attention is directed to Chapter 231 of the Acts of 1977 which stipulates that, surveyors of
 highways, road commissioners, or any other person, agency or authority responsible for road or highway repairs shall
 notify the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority not later than forty-eight hours prior to the repair, construction or
 reconstruction of any road or highway used by said Authority in the operation of regular route service if such repairs,
 construction or reconstruction shall prohibit the operation of regular route service by the Authority over such road or
 highway.
 The bidder’s attention is directed to the code of Federal Regulations Part 1926 - Safety and Health Regulations
 for Construction, Subpart N 1926.550, relating to construction equipment clearances at overhead electric lines, which
 states in part “, . . . The minimum clearance between the lines and any part of the crane
 or load must be at least 3.05 meters from lines rated 50 KV or below, and greater distances for higher
 voltages, . . .”. For the protection of personnel and equipment, the Contractor should be aware of this regulation
 especially during paving operations using large semi-trailer vehicles.
 7.14
 
 Responsibility for Damage Claims.
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 I.35
 
 The Contractor shall indemnify, defend and save harmless the Commonwealth, the Department, the
 municipality and all of its or their offices, agents and employees against all suits, claims or liability of every name and
 nature, for or on account of any injuries to persons or damage to property arising out of or in consequence of the acts of
 the Contractor in the performance of the work covered by the Contract or failure to comply with the terms and
 conditions of said Contract, whether by the Contractor or his/her employees or Subcontractors, but only in respect of
 such injuries or damages sustained during the performance and prior to the completion and acceptance of the work
 covered by the Contract.
 The Contractor will be held responsible for any and all claims for damage to underground structures such as,
 but not restricted to, water or gas mains, pipes, conduits, manholes or catch basins, due to his/her operation or to the
 operations of any of his/her Subcontractors.
 The Contractor’s attention is directed to the provisions of General Laws, Chapter 30, Section 39H as amended.
 In accordance therewith, the Commonwealth agrees to indemnify the Contractor against loss by reason of the liability to
 pay damages to others for entry upon any land included within the boundaries of the area within which the work is to be
 performed as set forth in the construction Contract and the plans and specifications applying to such Contract or any
 approved changes thereof or for damage sustained upon any lands adjoining said land by reason of the flowage or
 drainage of water thereto or therefrom. In any case wherein such damages result from the failure of the Commonwealth
 to take an interest or easement in such adjoining area, provided that the Commonwealth acting by an authorized
 representative thereof has issued a notice in writing to the Contractor prior to the making of an entry upon such premises
 directing or permitting him/her to proceed with his/her Contract and to make such entry upon the premises for the
 purpose of performing the work required by said Contract, or any approved alteration thereof, and provided, further, that
 the Contractor has given notice in writing to the contracting authority within 15 days after receiving notice of any claim
 to come in and settle the same and upon the commencement of any action against him/her to come in and defend said
 action, but in no event shall any such damage claim be compromised or adjusted without the written consent of the
 Commonwealth. The provisions of this section shall in no way relieve the Contractor from any liability for damage to
 property of others caused by his/her negligence or that of his/her employees nor shall they be construed to require the
 Commonwealth to indemnify the Contractor against any loss resulting from such acts of negligence.
 7.15
 
 Claims Against Contractors for Payment of Labor, Materials and Other Purposes.
 
 The Contractor shall pay all bills for labor, materials, rental of equipment and for such other purposes as are
 more specifically set forth in Chapter 149, Section 29 and Chapter 30, Section 39A, General Laws, and all amendments
 thereto. It is understood that the Payment Bond required by Subsection 3.04, Paragraph B, is the sole security for
 petitions brought pursuant to said sections. The Contractor and Party of the First Part shall also comply with the
 provisions of Chapter 30, Section 39F and G.
 Chapter 149, Section 29, of the General Laws as amended reads as follows: Officers or agents contracting in
 behalf of the Commonwealth or in behalf of any county, city, town, district or other political subdivision of the
 Commonwealth or other public instrumentality for the construction, reconstruction, alteration, remodeling, repair or
 demolition of public buildings or other public works when the amount of the Contract in the case of the Commonwealth
 is more than five thousand dollars, and in any other case is more than two thousand dollars, shall obtain security by bond
 in an amount not less than one half of the total contract price, for payment by the Contractor and Subcontractors for
 labor performed or furnished and materials used or employed therein, including lumber so employed which is not
 incorporated therein and is not wholly or necessarily consumed or made so worthless as to lose its identity, but only to
 the extent of its purchase price less its fair salvage value, and including also any material specially fabricated at the order
 of the Contractor or Subcontractor for use as a component part of said public building or other public work so as to be
 unsuitable for use elsewhere, even though such material has not been delivered and incorporated into the public building
 or public work, but only to the extent of its purchase price less its fair salvage value and only to the extent that such
 specially fabricated material is in conformity with the Contract, plans and specifications or any changes therein duly
 made; for payment of transportation charges for materials used or employed therein which are consigned to the
 Contractor or to a Subcontractor who has a direct contractual relationship with the Contractor; for payment by such
 Contractor and Subcontractors of any sums due for the rental or hire of vehicles, steam shovels, rollers propelled by
 steam or other power, concrete mixers, tools and other appliances and equipment employed in such construction,
 reconstruction, alteration, remodeling, repair or demolition; for payment of transportation charges directly related to
 
 I.36
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 such rental or hire; and for payment by such Contractor and Subcontractors of any sums due trustees or other persons
 authorized to collect such payments from the Contractor or Subcontractors, based upon the labor performed or furnished
 as aforesaid, for health and welfare plans, supplementary unemployment benefit plans and other fringe benefits which
 are payable in cash and provided for in collective bargaining agreements between organized labor and the Contractor or
 Subcontractors; provided, that any such trustees or other persons authorized to collect such payments for health and
 welfare plans, supplementary unemployment benefit plans and other fringe benefits shall, subject to the following
 provisions, be entitled to the benefit of the security only in an amount based upon labor performed or furnished as
 aforesaid for a maximum of two hundred and forty consecutive calendar days.
 In order to obtain the benefit of such bond for any amount claimed, due and unpaid at any time, any claimant
 having a contractual relationship with the Contractor principal furnishing the bond, who has not been paid in full or any
 amount claimed due for the labor, materials, equipment, appliances or transportation included in the paragraph (1)
 coverage within sixty-five days after the due date for same, shall have the right to enforce any such claim (a) by filing a
 petition in equity within one year after the day on which such claimant last performed the labor or furnished the labor,
 materials, equipment, appliances or transportation included in the claim and (b) by prosecuting the claim thereafter by
 trial in the superior court to final adjudication and execution for the sums justly due the claimant as provided in this
 section.
 Any claimant having a contractual relationship with a Subcontractor performing labor or both performing labor
 and furnishing materials pursuant to a Contract with the general Contractor but no contractual relationship with the
 Contractor principal furnishing the bond shall have the right to enforce any such claim as provided in subparagraphs (a)
 and (b) of paragraph (2) only if such claimant gives written notice to the Contractor principal within sixty-five days after
 the day on which the claimant last performed the labor or furnished the labor, materials, equipment, appliances or
 transportation included in the paragraphs (1) coverage, stating with substantial accuracy the amount claimed, the name
 of the party for whom such labor was performed or such labor, materials, equipment, appliances or transportation were
 furnished; provided, that any such claimant shall have the right to enforce any part of a claim covering special fabricated
 material included in the paragraph (1) coverage only if such claimant has given the Contractor principal written notice of
 the placement of the order and the amount thereof not later than twenty days after receiving the final approval in writing
 for the use of the material. The notices provided for in this paragraph (3) shall be served by mailing the same by
 registered or certified mail postage prepaid in an envelope addressed to the Contractor principal at any place at which
 the Contractor principal maintains an office or conducts his/her business, or at the Contractor principal’s residence, or in
 any manner in which civil process may be served.
 Upon motion of any party, the court shall advance for speedy trial a petition to enforce a claim pursuant to this
 section. Sections 59 and 59B of Chapter 231 shall apply to petitions to enforce claims pursuant to this section. The
 court shall enter an interlocutory decree upon which execution shall issue for any part of a claim found due pursuant to
 said Sections 59 or 59B and shall, upon motion of any party, advance for speedy trial the petition to enforce the
 remainder of the claim. Any party aggrieved by such interlocutory decree shall have the right to appeal therefrom as
 from a final decree. The court shall not consolidate for trial the petition of any claimant under this section with the
 petition of one or more other claimants on the same bond, unless the court finds that a substantial portion of the evidence
 of the same events during the course of construction (other than the fact that the claims sought to be consolidated arise
 under the same general Contract) is applicable to the petitions sought to be consolidated, and that such consolidation will
 prevent unnecessary duplication of evidence.
 The court shall not dismiss any petition on the ground that it was filed before the sixty-fifth day after the day
 the claimant last performed the labor or furnished the labor, materials, equipment, appliances or transportation included
 in the claim, nor shall the court dismiss any petition on the ground that a claim involves more than one Contract with the
 same party and that the one year period has elapsed as to any one Contract; provided, that the court shall not enter a
 decree upon any claim or part thereof prior to the seventieth day after the day the claimant last performed the labor or
 furnished the labor, materials, equipment, appliances or transportation included in the claim.
 A decree in favor of any claimant under this section shall include reasonable legal fees based upon the time
 spent and the results accomplished as approved by the court and such legal fees shall not in any event be less than the
 published rate of any recommended fee schedule of a state-wide bar association or of a bar association in which the
 office of counsel for claimant is located, whichever is higher.
 Any person employing persons or any public works hereinbefore referred to shall post conspicuously, at such
 place or places as will provide reasonable opportunity for all employees to read the same, a correct copy of this section.
 The Department shall enforce this paragraph. (Refers to the Department of Labor and Industries.)

 I.37
 
 In conformity with the requirements of Chapter 30, Section 39F of the General Laws, as amended, the
 following is quoted from Chapter 30, Section 39F.
 “(1) Every contract awarded pursuant to sections forty-four A to L. inclusive, of chapter one hundred and fortynine shall contain the following subparagraphs (a) through (i) and every contract awarded pursuant to section thirty-nine
 M of chapter thirty shall contain the following subparagraphs (a) through (h) and in each case those subparagraphs shall
 be binding between the general contractor and each subcontractor.
 “(a) Forthwith after the general contractor receives payment on account of a periodic estimate, the general
 contractor shall pay to each subcontractor the amount paid for the labor performed and the materials furnished by that
 subcontractor, less any amount specified in any court proceedings barring such payment and also less any amount
 claimed due from the subcontractor by the general contractor.
 “(b) Not later than the sixty-fifth day after each subcontractor substantially completes his/her work in
 accordance with the plans and specifications, the entire balance due under the subcontract less amounts retained by the
 awarding authority as the estimated cost of completing the incomplete and unsatisfactory items of work, shall be due the
 subcontractor; and the awarding authority shall pay that amount to the general contractor. The general contractor shall
 forthwith pay to the subcontractor the full amount received from the awarding authority less any amount specified in any
 court proceedings barring such payment and also less any amount claimed due from the subcontractor by the general
 contractor.
 “(c) Each payment made by the awarding authority to the general contractor pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and
 (b) of this paragraph for the labor performed and the materials furnished by a subcontractor shall be made to the general
 contractor for that account of that subcontractor; and the awarding authority shall take reasonable steps to compel the
 general contractor to make each such payment to each such subcontractor. If the awarding authority has received a
 demand for direct payment from a subcontractor for any amount which has already been included in a payment to the
 general contractor or which is to be included in a payment to the general contractor for payment to the subcontractor as
 provided in subparagraphs (a) and (b), the awarding authority shall act upon the demand as provided in this section.
 “(d) If, within seventy days after the subcontractor has substantially completed the work, the subcontractor has
 not received from the general contractor the balance due under the subcontract including any amount due for extra labor
 and materials furnished to the general contractor, less any amount retained by the awarding authority as the estimated
 cost of completing the incomplete and unsatisfactory items of work, the subcontractor may demand direct payment of
 that balance from the awarding authority. The demand shall be by a sworn statement delivered to or sent by certified
 mail to the awarding authority, and a copy shall be delivered to or sent by certified mail to the general contractor at the
 same time. The demand shall contain a detailed breakdown of the balance due under the subcontract and also a
 statement of the status of completion of the subcontract work. Any demand made after substantial completion of the
 subcontract work shall be valid even if delivered or mailed prior to the seventieth day after the subcontractor has
 substantially completed the subcontract work. Within ten days after the subcontractor has delivered or so mailed the
 demand to the awarding authority and delivered or so mailed a copy to the general contractor, the general contractor
 may reply to the demand. The reply shall be by a sworn statement delivered to or sent by certified mail to the awarding
 authority and a copy shall be delivered to or sent by certified mail to the subcontractor at the same time. The reply shall
 contain a detailed breakdown of the balance due under the subcontract including any amount due for extra labor and
 materials furnished to the general contractor and of the amount due for each claim made by the general contractor
 against the subcontractor.
 “(e) Within fifteen days after receipt of the demand by the awarding authority, but in no event prior to the
 seventieth day after substantial completion of the subcontract work, the awarding authority shall make direct payment to
 the subcontractor of the balance due under the subcontract including any amount due for extra labor and materials
 furnished to the general contractor, less any amount (i) retained by the awarding authority as the estimated cost of
 completing the incomplete or unsatisfactory item of work, (ii) specified in any court proceedings barring such payment,
 or (iii) disputed by the general contractor in the sworn reply; provided that the awarding authority shall not deduct from
 a direct payment any amount as provided in part (iii) if the reply is not sworn to, or for which the sworn reply does not
 contain the detailed breakdown required by subparagraph (d). The awarding authority shall make further direct
 payments to the subcontractor forthwith after the removal of the basis for deductions from direct payments made as
 provided in parts (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph.
 “(f) The awarding authority shall forthwith deposit the amount deducted from a direct payment as provided in
 part (iii) of subparagraph (e) in an interest-bearing joint account in the names of the general contractor and the
 subcontractor in a bank in Massachusetts selected by the awarding authority or agreed upon by the general contractor
 
 I.38
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 and the subcontractor and shall notify the general contractor and the subcontractor of the date of the deposit and the
 bank receiving the deposit. The bank shall pay the amount in the account, including accrued interest, as provided in an
 agreement between the general contractor and the subcontractor or as determined by decree of a court of competent
 jurisdiction.
 “(g) All direct payments and all deductions from demands for direct payments deposited in an interest-bearing
 account or accounts in a bank pursuant to subparagraph (f) shall be made out of amounts payable to the general
 contractor at the time of receipt of a demand for direct payment from a subcontractor and out of amounts which later
 become payable to the general contractor and in the order of receipt of such demands from subcontractors. All direct
 payments shall discharge the obligation of the awarding authority to the general contractor to the extent of such payment.
 “(h) The awarding authority shall deduct from payments to a general contractor amounts which, together with
 the deposits in interest-bearing accounts pursuant to subparagraph (f), are sufficient to satisfy all unpaid balances of
 demands for direct payment received from subcontractors. All such amounts shall be earmarked for such direct
 payments, and the subcontractors shall have a right in such deductions prior to any claims against such amounts by
 creditors of the general contractor.
 “(i) If the subcontractor does not receive payment as provided in subparagraph (a) or if the general contractor
 does not submit a periodic estimate for the value of the labor or materials performed or furnished by the subcontractor
 and the subcontractor does not receive payment for same when due less the deductions provided for in subparagraph (a),
 the subcontractor may demand direct payment by following the procedure in subparagraph (d) and the general
 contractor may file a sworn reply as provided in that same subparagraph. A demand made after the first day of the
 month following that for which the subcontractor performed or furnished the labor and materials for which the
 subcontractor seeks payment shall be valid even if delivered or mailed prior to the time payment was due on a periodic
 estimate from the general contractor. Thereafter the awarding authority shall proceed as provided in subparagraphs (e),
 (f), (g), and (h).”
 Chapter 30, Section 39G, of the General Laws, as amended reads as follows:
 Upon substantial completion of the work required by a contract with the Commonwealth, or any agency or
 political subdivision thereof, for the construction, reconstruction, alteration, remodeling, repair or improvement of public
 ways, including bridges and other highway structures, sewers and water mains, airports and other public works, the
 contractor shall present in writing to the awarding authority its certification that the work has been substantially
 completed. Within twenty-one days thereafter, the awarding authority shall present to the contractor either a written
 declaration that the work has been substantially completed or an itemized list of incomplete or unsatisfactory work items
 required by the contract sufficient to demonstrate that the work has not been substantially completed. The awarding
 authority may include with such list a notice setting forth a reasonable time, which shall not in any event be prior to the
 contract completion date, within which the contractor must achieve substantial completion of the work. In the event that
 the awarding authority fails to respond, by presentation of a written declaration or itemized list as aforesaid, to the
 contractor’s certification within the twenty-one pay period, the contractor’s certification shall take effect as the awarding
 authority’s declaration that the work has been substantially completed.
 Within sixty-five days after the effective date of a declaration of a substantial completion, the awarding
 authority shall prepare and forthwith send to the contractor for acceptance a substantial completion estimate for the
 quantity and price of the work done and all but one percent retainage on that work, including the quantity, price and all
 but 10% retainage for the undisputed part of each work item and extra work item in dispute but excluding the disputed
 part thereof, less the estimate cost of completing all incomplete and unsatisfactory work items and less the total periodic
 payments made to date for the work. The awarding authority also shall deduct from the substantial completion estimate
 an amount equal to the sum of all demands for direct payment filed by subcontractors and not yet paid to subcontractors
 or deposited in joint accounts pursuant to section thirty-nine F, but no contract subject to said section thirty-nine F shall
 contain any other provision authorizing the awarding authority to deduct any amount by virtue of claims asserted against
 the contract by subcontractors, material suppliers or others.
 If the awarding authority fails to prepare and send to the contractor any substantial completion estimate
 required by this section on or before the date hereinabove set forth, the awarding authority shall pay to the contractor
 interest on the amount which would have been due to the contractor pursuant to such substantial completion estimate at
 the rate of three percentage points above the rediscount rate then charged by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston from
 such date to the date on which the awarding authority sends that substantial completion estimate to the contractor for
 acceptance or to the date of payment therefor, whichever occurs first. The awarding authority shall include the amount
 of such interest in the substantial completion estimate.
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 I.39
 
 Within fifteen days after the effective date of the declaration of substantial completion, the awarding authority
 shall send to the contractor by certified mail, return receipt requested, a complete list of all incomplete or unsatisfactory
 work items, and, unless delayed by causes beyond his/her control, the contractor shall complete all such work items
 within forty-five days after the receipt of such list or before the then contract completion date, whichever is later. If the
 contractor fails to complete such work within such time, the awarding authority may, subsequent to seven days’ written
 notice to the contractor by certified mail, return receipt requested, terminate the contract and complete the incomplete or
 unsatisfactory work items and charge the cost of same to the contractor.
 Within thirty days after receipt by the awarding authority of a notice from the contractor stating that all of the
 work required by the contract has been completed, the awarding authority shall prepare and forthwith send to the
 contractor for acceptance a final estimate for the quantity and price of the work done and all retainage on that work less
 all payments made to date, unless the awarding authority’s inspection shows that work items required by the contract
 remain incomplete or unsatisfactory, or that documentation required by the contract has not been completed. If the
 awarding authority fails to prepare and send to the contractor the final estimate within thirty days after receipt of notice
 of completion, the awarding authority shall pay to the contractor interest on the amount which would have been due to
 the contractor pursuant to such final estimate at the rate hereinabove provided from the thirtieth day after such
 completion until the date on which the awarding authority sends the final estimate to the contractor for acceptance or the
 date of payment therefor, whichever occurs first, provided that the awarding authority’s inspection shows that no work
 items required by the contract remain incomplete or unsatisfactory. Interest shall not be paid hereunder on amounts for
 which interest is required to be paid in connection with the substantial completion estimate as hereinabove provided.
 The awarding authority shall include the amount of the interest required to be paid hereunder in the final estimate.
 The awarding authority shall pay the amount due pursuant to any periodic, substantial completion or final
 estimate within thirty-five days after receipt of written acceptance for such estimate from the contractor and shall pay
 interest on the amount due pursuant to such estimate at the rate hereinabove provided from that thirty-fifth day to the
 date of payment. In the case of periodic payments, the contracting authority may deduct from its payment a retention
 based on its estimate of the fair value of its claims against the contractor, a retention for direct payments to
 subcontractors based on demands for same in accordance with the provisions of section thirty-nine F, and a retention to
 secure satisfactory performance of the contractual work not exceeding five percent of the approved amount of any
 periodic payment, and the same right to retention shall apply to bonded subcontractors entitled to direct payment under
 section thirty-nine F of chapter thirty; provided, that a five percent value of all items that are planted in the ground shall
 be deducted from the periodic payments until final acceptance.
 No periodic, substantial completion or final estimate or acceptance or payment thereof shall bar a contractor
 from reserving all rights to dispute the quantity and amount of, or the failure of the awarding authority to approve a
 quantity and amount of, all or part of any work item or extra work item.
 Substantial completion, for the purposes of this section, shall mean either that the work required by the contract
 has been completed except for work having a contract price of less than one percent of the then adjusted total contract
 price, or substantially all of the work has been completed and opened to public use except for minor incomplete or
 unsatisfactory work items that do not materially impair the usefulness of the work required by the contract.
 7.16
 
 Claims of Contractor for Compensation.
 
 No person or corporation, other than the signer of the Contract as Contractor, now has any interest hereunder,
 and no claim shall be made or be valid; and neither Party of the First Part nor any member, agent or employee thereof,
 shall be liable for, or be held to pay, any money except as provided in Subsections 4.02, 4.03, 4.04, 4.06 and 9.02 of
 these Specifications and Clause 3 of the Contract.
 All claims of the Contractor for compensation other than as provided for in the Contract on account of any act
 of omission or commission by the Party of the First Part or its agents must be made in writing to the Engineer within one
 week after the beginning of any work or the sustaining of any damage on account of such act, such written statement to
 contain a description of the nature of the work performed or damage sustained; and the Contractor shall, on or before the
 15th day of the month succeeding that in which such work is performed or damage sustained, file with the Engineer an
 itemized statement of the details and amount of such work or damage and unless such statement shall be made as
 required, his/her claim for compensation shall be forfeited and invalidated, and the Contractor shall not be entitled to
 payment on account of any such work or damage. Such notice by the Contractor and the keeping of costs by the
 Engineer shall not in any way be construed as providing the validity of the claim. The provisions of this paragraph shall
 
 I.40
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 not apply to changes in quantities as provided under Subsection 4.06 or to Extra Work ordered by the Engineer in
 writing.
 On the basis of information provided in writing by his/her own employees, servants, or agents the Contractor
 will be required to certify, in writing, that the work for which the Contractor is claiming payment, other than as provided
 for in the Contract, is work actually performed, and the costs as shown are the amounts legally due for performing such
 work for which payment is claimed.
 The Engineer shall determine all questions as to the amount and value of such work, and the fact and extent of
 such damage and shall so notify the Contractor in writing of his/her determination. Such determination of the Engineer
 may be appealed to the Board of Contract Appeals in accordance with General Law, Chapter 16, Section 5b, as
 amended.
 The appeal shall set forth the contract number, city or town project is in, the name and address of the
 Contractor, the amount of the claim (and breakdown of how amount was computed), a clear, concise statement of the
 specific determination from which appeal is taken, including the reasons for appealing the determination and shall be
 signed by the Contractor.
 The Commission Secretary shall record the date and time any such appeal is received, and shall keep the appeal
 on record. The Commission Secretary shall forward a copy of the appeal to the Hearing Examiner who shall set the
 matter down for hearing in accordance with rules adopted by the Commission.
 Interest on judgments for contractor claims filed with the Superior Court of Massachusetts shall be computed
 from the date of the breach or demand or, if not established, from the date of the action in Superior Court and shall be at
 the rate of three percentage points above the discount rate then charged by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston with a
 cap of twelve percent.
 The acceptance by the Contractor of the final payment made under the provisions of Subsection 9.05 shall
 operate as and shall be a release to the Party of the First Part and every member, agent and employee thereof, from all
 claim and liability to the Contractor for anything done or furnished for, or relating to, the work, or for any act or neglect
 of the Party of the First Part or of any person relating to or affecting the work, except the claim against the Party of the
 First Part for the remainder, if any there be, of the amounts kept or retained as provided in Subsection 7.15. For claims
 for extensions of time see Subsection 8.10.
 7.17
 
 Traffic Accommodation.
 
 Any portion of the work which is in an acceptable condition for travel may be opened for traffic as directed in
 writing by the Engineer, but such opening for traffic shall not be construed as an acceptance of the work or part thereof,
 nor shall it act as a waiver of any of the provisions of these specifications or of the Contract; provided, however, that on
 such portions of the project as are opened for use of traffic, the Contractor shall not be required to assume any expense
 entailed in maintaining the roadway for traffic. The Party of the First Part will be responsible for maintenance and any
 damage to the work caused solely by traffic on any portion of the project which has been opened to public travel as
 stipulated above, and it may order the contractor to repair or replace such damage, whereupon the Contractor shall make
 such repairs at contract unit prices so far as the same are applicable, or as Extra Work under the provisions of Subsection
 4.03 if there are no applicable items in the Contract. Any damage to the highway not attributable to traffic which might
 occur on such section, shall be repaired by the Contractor at his/her expense.
 No hauling or other traffic shall be permitted over any portions of the work unless so authorized by the
 Engineer.
 If the Contractor is dilatory in completing shoulders, drainage structures or other features of the work, the
 Engineer may order all or a portion of the project open to traffic, but in such event the Contractor shall not be relieved of
 his/her liability and responsibility during the period the work is so opened prior to final acceptance. The Contractor
 shall conduct the remainder of his/her construction operations so as to cause the least obstruction to traffic.
 Where the new construction coincides with the present traveled way, the Engineer may order the installation of
 various items of work for safety and convenience of the public due to the highway being open to traffic. The Party of
 the First Part will be responsible for damage to the following items of work caused solely by traffic on any portion of the
 project which is open to public travel and on which these items of work have been ordered to be installed and partial
 acceptance made thereof by the Engineer under the terms and conditions stated below.
 1. Guard Rail
 2. Metal Bridge Railing
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 I.41
 
 3. Traffic Signal Systems
 4. Highway Lighting
 5. Traffic Attenuators
 6. Traffic Signs
 If the person or persons causing the damage has been identified, the Contractor shall be responsible for
 recovering the cost of such repair or replacement from that person or their insurance company. No additional unit price
 or extra work payment will be made by the Party of the First Part unless the Contractor has been unable to recover the
 full repair of replacement cost from said person or their insurance company. The Party of the First Part may order the
 Contractor to repair or replace such damage, whereupon the Contractor shall make such repairs at contract unit prices so
 far as the same are applicable or as Extra Work under the provisions of Subsection 4.03 if there are no applicable items
 of work in the Contract. Any damage not attributable to traffic which might occur on such traveled way shall be
 repaired by the Contractor at his/her own expense.
 7.18
 
 Contractor’s Responsibility for the Work.
 
 Until written acceptance of the physical work by the Chief Engineer, the Contractor shall assume full charge
 and care thereof and the Contractor shall take every necessary precaution against injury or damage to the work by action
 of the elements, or from any cause whatever, whether arising from the execution or the non-execution of the Contract,
 and especially when blasting is to be done.
 The Contractor shall bear all losses resulting to him/her on account of the amount or the character of the work
 or because the nature of the land in or on which the work is done is different from what was estimated or expected, or on
 account of the weather elements or other causes (except as stated in Subsection 4.04, Changed Conditions).
 The Contractor shall rebuild, repair, restore and make good all injuries or damages to any portion of the work
 occasioned by any of the above causes before the completion and written acceptance of the physical work, and shall bear
 the expense thereof, except damage to the work due to war, whether or not declared, civil war, insurrection, rebellion or
 revolution, or to any act or condition incident to any of the foregoing, to “Acts of God” (limited to hurricane, tornado,
 cyclone and earthquake as classified by the United States Weather Bureau for the particular locality and for the
 particular season of the year, and in addition thereto, damages resulting directly from flooding from any of the
 aforementioned “Acts of God”). The repair of such damages shall be done by the Contractor and paid for at the
 respective contract unit prices for the quantity and items of work involved. In any case in which the estimate for
 replacing such work or repairing such damage caused by war, whether or not declared, civil war, insurrection, rebellion
 or revolution, or to any act or condition incident to the foregoing, or an “Act of God” combined with any previously
 authorized Extra Work results in a change of such magnitude as to be incompatible with competitive bid status, the
 Department reserves the right to terminate the Contract and to call for new bids and award a new Contract for such
 work. In the event any Contract is terminated for such reason the Department shall pay the Contractor such sum as may
 be due for work performed up to the date of the “Act of God”, or of damage directly due to war, whether or not
 declared, civil war, insurrection, rebellion or revolution, or to any act or condition incident to any of the foregoing and
 shall also take over and pay for any material stored at site of the work provided said material was intended to be and
 could have been incorporated into the work; the Department shall also take over and pay for any material which was
 being especially fabricated for incorporation into the work, provided, however, that as a condition precedent to the
 Department’s liability for such material, the Contractor is legally liable therefor and the material was intended to be and
 could have been incorporated in the work.
 Issuance of an estimate on any part of the work done shall not be construed as final acceptance of any work
 completed up to that time.
 Should the Contractor fail to take prompt action whenever conditions make it necessary, the Party of the First
 Part shall make emergency repairs or cause the same to be made, with the stipulation that the costs for such repairs shall
 be charged against the Contractor and deducted from moneys due him/her.
 In case of suspension of work from any cause whatsoever, the Contractor shall be responsible for the project
 and shall take such precautions as may be necessary to prevent damage to the project, provide for normal drainage and
 shall erect any necessary temporary structures, signs, or other facilities at his/her expense. During such period of
 suspension of work, the Contractor shall properly and continuously maintain in an acceptable growing condition all
 living material in newly established plantings, seedings, and soddings furnished under his/her Contract, and shall take
 adequate precautions to protect new tree growth and other important vegetative growth against injury.

 Personal Liability of Public Officials.
 
 In carrying out any of the provisions of these specifications, or in exercising any power or authority granted to
 them by or within the scope of the Contract, there shall be no liability upon the Commissioner, Engineer, or their
 authorized representatives, either personally or as officials of the Commonwealth, it being understood that in all such
 matters they act solely as agents and representatives of the Commonwealth.
 7.20
 
 No Waiver of Legal Rights.
 
 The Party of the First Part shall not be precluded or estopped by any measurement, estimate, or certificate
 made either before or after the physical completion and final acceptance of the work and payment therefor, from
 showing the true amount and character of the work performed and materials furnished by the Contractor, nor from
 showing that any such measurement, estimate or certificate is untrue or is incorrectly made, nor that the work or
 materials do not in fact conform to the Contract. The Department shall not be precluded or estopped, notwithstanding
 any such measurement, estimate, or certificate and payment in accordance therewith, from recovering from the
 Contractor or his/her sureties, or both, such damage as it may sustain by reason of his/her failure to comply with the
 terms of the Contract. Neither the acceptance by the Department, or any representative of the Department, nor any
 payment for any acceptance of the whole or any part of the work, nor any extension of time, nor any possession taken by
 the Department, shall operate as a waiver of any portion of the Contract of any power herein reserved, or of any right to
 damages. A waiver of any breach of the Contract shall not be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.
 Any remedy provided in the Contract shall be taken and construed as cumulative, that is, in addition to each and every
 other remedy herein provided; and the Party of the First Part shall also be entitled as of right to a writ of injunction
 against any breach of the provisions of the Contract.
 7.21
 
 Preference in Employment of Labor.
 
 In the employment of mechanics, teamsters, chauffeurs and laborers in the construction of public works by the
 Commonwealth, or by a county, town or district, or by persons contracting or subcontracting for such work, preference
 shall first be given to citizens of the Commonwealth who have been residents of the Commonwealth for at least six
 months at the commencement of their employment and who are veterans as defined in General Laws, Chapter 4, Section
 7, Clause 43, as amended and who are qualified to perform the work to which the employment relates; and secondly to
 citizens of the Commonwealth, generally who have been residents of the Commonwealth for at least six months at the
 commencement of their employment, and if they cannot be obtained in sufficient numbers, then to citizens of the United
 States, and every Contract for such work shall contain a provision to this effect. Each county, town or district in the
 construction of public works, or persons contracting or subcontracting for such works shall give preference to veterans
 and citizens who are residents of such county, town or district. The Contractor’s attention is hereby directed to said
 Section 26 of Chapter 149 of the General Laws, as amended.
 The requirements in the above paragraph do not apply to any project or part thereof, financed in whole or in
 part with Federal Funds.
 
 7.22
 
 Labor, Lodging, Board, Maximum Hours of Employment,
 Weekly Payment, Keeping of Payroll Records.
 
 Every employee in public work shall lodge, board and trade where and with whom he/she elects; and no person
 or his/her agents or employees under Contract with the Commonwealth, a county, city or town, or with a department,
 board, commission or officer acting therefor, for the doing of public work, shall directly or indirectly require as a
 condition of employment therein, that the employee shall lodge, board or trade at a particular place or with a particular
 person (Chapter 149, Section 25 of the General Laws).
 No laborer, workman, mechanic, foreman or inspector working within this Commonwealth, in the employ of
 the Contractor, Subcontractor or other person doing or contracting to do the whole or a part of the work contemplated by
 this Contract, shall be required or permitted to work more than eight hours in any one day or more than 48 hours in any
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department

 I.43
 
 one week, or more than six days in any one week, except in cases of emergency, or in case any town subject to Section
 31 of Chapter 149 of the General Laws is a party to such a Contract, more than eight hours in any one day, except as
 aforesaid. The Department or the Contractor or any Subcontractor may employ laborers, Workmen, mechanics,
 foremen and inspectors for more than eight hours in any one day in the work to be done or under Contract when, in the
 opinion of the Commissioner of Labor and Industries, public necessity so requires. (Chapter 149, Section 34 of the
 General Laws, as amended.)
 Attention of Bidders is called to Section 148 of Chapter 149 of the General Laws and amendments thereof
 requiring the weekly payment of employees.
 Upon request of the Engineer or the Massachusetts Department of Labor and Industries, the Contractor shall
 furnish certified copies of any or all payrolls for the Contract, showing the name, address, and occupational classification
 of each employee on said works, and the hours worked by, and the wages paid to each such employee. Such payroll
 shall also include the rates paid for rented trucks or rental equipment of any kind used on the work. This requirement
 shall also apply to the work or any Subcontractor, having a Subcontract for any of the work performed on the project.
 Such records shall be kept in such manner as the Commissioner of Labor and Industries shall prescribe, and shall be
 open to inspection by the Engineer or any authorized representative of the Department of Labor and Industries at any
 reasonable time and as often as may be necessary.
 In the case the work covered by this Contract is financed from Federal Funds, the above provisions relative to
 the hours of employment shall be subject to such revision and amendment as are required by the Rules and Regulations
 controlling the expenditures of such Federal Funds.
 7.23
 
 Archeological and Paleontological Discoveries.
 
 The Contractor’s attention is directed to the United States Department of Transportation, Federal Highway
 Administration, Federal Aid Highway Program Manual, Volume 7, Chapter 7, Section 4, subject “Archeological and
 Paleontological Salvage”, incorporating Policy and Procedure Memorandum 20-7, dated March 31, 1971, and to the
 Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Acts of 1973, Chapter 1155. In compliance with these procedures and legislation, the
 contractor shall exercise special care during his/her operations to avoid injury to underground prehistoric and historic
 archeological remains or paleontological remains. Should any archeological or paleontological remains be encountered
 during any phase of construction, the contractor shall immediately suspend all work in the area and shall notify the
 Engineer. The Engineer shall immediately notify the State Archeologist and the Massachusetts Historical Commission.
 All Construction work in that area will be temporarily delayed while the State Archeologist and Representatives of
 Massachusetts Historical Commission inspect the site to determine the importance of the discovery. Areas of
 prehistorical, historical, or paleontological significance shall be carefully protected in accordance with Section 7.18 and
 shall not be disturbed by the Contractor until so directed by the Engineer.

 SECTION 8.00
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 8.01
 
 Subletting or Assignment of Contract.
 
 The Contractor shall not sublet, sell, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of the Contract or any portion
 thereof, or of his/her right, title or interest therein, without written consent of the Engineer. In case such consent is
 given, the Contractor will be permitted to sublet a portion thereof, but shall perform with his/her own organization, work
 amounting to not less than 50 percent of the original total Contract price, except that any items designated in the
 Contract as “specialty items” may be performed by Subcontract and the cost of any such specialty items so performed by
 Subcontracts may be deducted from the total cost computing the amount of work required to be performed by the
 Contractor with his/her own organization. No Subcontractors, or transfer of Contract, shall in any case release the
 Contractor of liability under the Contract and Bonds.
 The Contractor shall notify the Engineer, as soon as practicable after execution of the Contract, the name and
 address of each Subcontractor the Contractor intends to employ, the portion of the work which the Subcontractor is to
 do, and such other information the Engineer may require in order to ascertain whether the Subcontractor is reliable and
 able to perform the work.
 The Contractor shall direct the attention of his/her Subcontractors to the requirements of:
 (1) Subsection 7.05 regarding insurances, and also the Minimum Wage Rates and Health and Welfare and
 Pensions Fund Contributions as determined by the Commission of Labor and Industries of the Commonwealth and also
 to the provisions of Subsections 7.21 and 7.22, and
 (2) Chapter 30, General Laws, Section 39L requires (1) that the Commonwealth and every county, city, town,
 district, board, commission, shall not enter into a Contract for such work with, and shall not approve as a Subcontractor
 furnishing labor and materials for a part of any such work, a foreign corporation which has not filed with the Department
 a certificate of the State Secretary stating that such corporation has complied with Sections 3 and 5 of Chapter 181 and
 the date of such compliance. Chapter 181, Section 3 requires foreign corporations to appoint the Secretary of the
 Commonwealth as an attorney for service of process, and Section 5, Chapter 181 requires foreign corporations to file
 certain documents with the Secretary of State which will permit them to do business in Massachusetts.
 The Contractor shall also direct the attention of his/her Subcontractors and of all suppliers of material to the
 requirements of Subsection 5.09 regarding facilities for the Engineer’s inspectors.
 8.02
 
 Schedule of Operations.
 
 The Contractor shall submit, to and for the comments of the Engineer, a schedule of operations within ten days
 after the mailing of the executed Contract to the Contractor. The schedule shall show the proposed methods of
 construction and sequence of work and the time the Contractor proposes to complete the various items of work within
 the time specified in the Contract.
 If the Contractor’s operations are materially affected by changes in the plans or in the quantity of the work, or if
 the Contractor has failed to comply with the submitted and reviewed schedule, the Contractor shall submit a revised
 schedule if requested by the Engineer within seven days after the date of the Engineer’s request. This revised schedule
 shall show how the Contractor proposes to prosecute the balance of the work, so as to complete the work within the time
 specified in the Contract.
 8.03
 
 Prosecution of Work.
 
 The Contractor shall commence work within 15 days after the mailing of the executed Contract to the
 Contractor unless otherwise ordered in writing by the Engineer, and the Contractor shall thereafter prosecute the work at
 such places and in such order as the Engineer may from time to time prescribe.
 Should the prosecution of the work for any reason be discontinued, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer at
 least 24 hours in advance of resuming operations.

 Removal or Demolition of Buildings and Land Takings.
 
 When the removal or demolition of buildings within highway locations is done under other and separate
 Contracts the provisions of Subsection 5.06 shall apply and it is expressly agreed between the parties that the Party of
 the First Part shall not be held liable for any expense to the Contractor on account of any delay or interference with
 his/her work due to removal or demolition of the buildings or on account of any failure to remove or demolish any
 building or because of failure to make necessary land takings, and it is further expressly agreed that no allowance of any
 kind will be made except as provided in Subsections 8.05 or 8.10.
 8.05
 
 Claim for Delay or Suspension of the Work.
 
 The Contractor hereby agrees that he/she shall have no claim for damages of any kind on account of any delay
 in commencement of the work or any delay or suspension of any portion thereof, except as hereinafter provided.
 Provided, however, that if the Commission in their judgment shall determine that the performance of all or any
 major portion of the work is suspended, delayed, or interrupted for an unreasonable period of time by an act of the
 Department in the administration of the Contract, or by the Department’s failure to act as required by the Contract within
 the time specified in the Contract (or if no time is specified, within a reasonable time) and without the fault or negligence
 of the Contractor, an adjustment shall be made by the Department for any increase in the actual cost of performance of
 the Contract (excluding profit and overhead) necessarily caused by the period of such suspension, delay or interruption.
 No adjustment shall be made if the performance by the Contractor would have been prevented by other causes even if
 the work had not been so suspended, delayed, or interrupted by the Department.
 No claims shall be allowed under this Subsection for the Department’s failure to act as required by the Contract
 within the time specified in the Contract (or if no time is specified, within a reasonable time) for any cost incurred more
 than two weeks before the Contractor shall have notified the Department in writing of his/her claim due to the
 Department’s failure to act.
 The contractor shall submit in writing not later than 30 days after the termination of such suspension, delay or
 interruption the amount of the claim and breakdown of how the amount was computed in accordance with Subsection
 9.03B except no allowance for overhead and profit shall be allowed.
 Any dispute concerning whether the delay or suspension is unreasonable or any other question of fact arising
 under this paragraph shall be determined by the Commission, and such determination and decision, in case any question
 shall arise, shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to receive any money hereunder.
 The Contractor further agrees that the sole allowance for any such delay or suspension, other than as provided
 above, is an extension of time as provided in Subsection 8.10.
 8.06
 
 Limitations of Operations.
 
 The Contractor shall conduct the work at all times in such a manner and in such sequence as will assure the
 least interference with traffic and abutters. The Contractor shall have due regard to the location of detours and to the
 provisions for handling traffic. The Contractor shall not open up work to the prejudice or detriment of work already
 started.
 8.07
 
 Character of Workmen, Methods and Equipment.
 
 The Contractor shall at all times employ sufficient labor and equipment for prosecuting the several classes of
 work to full completion in the manner and time required by these specifications.
 All workmen shall have sufficient skill and experience to perform properly the work assigned to them.
 Workmen engaged in special work or skilled work shall have sufficient experience in such work and in the operation of
 the equipment required to perform all work properly and satisfactorily.
 Any person employed by the Contractor or by any Subcontractor who, in the Engineer’s judgment, does not
 perform his/her work in a proper and skilled manner or is intemperate or disorderly or otherwise unsatisfactory or not
 employed in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 7.21, shall at the written request of the Engineer, be removed
 
 I.46
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 forthwith by the Contractor or Subcontractor employing such person, and shall not be employed again in any portion of
 the work without the approval of the Engineer.
 Should the Contractor fail to take the necessary action to remove such person or persons as required above, or
 fail to furnish suitable and sufficient personnel for the proper prosecution of the work, the Engineer may suspend the
 work by written notice until such orders are complied with.
 All equipment which is proposed to be used on the work shall be of sufficient size and in such mechanical
 condition as to meet requirements of the work and to produce a satisfactory quality of work. Equipment used on any
 portion of the project shall be such that no injury to the roadway, adjacent property, or other highways will result from
 its use.
 When the methods and equipment to be used by the Contractor is accomplishing the construction are not
 prescribed in the Contract, the Contractor is free to use any methods or equipment that he/she demonstrates to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer which will accomplish the contract work in conformity with the requirements of the
 Contract.
 When the Contract specifies the methods and equipment by which the construction be performed, such
 methods and equipment shall be used unless others are authorized by the Engineer, in writing. If the Contractor desires
 to use a method or type of equipment other than that specified in the Contract, the Contractor may request authority from
 the Engineer to do so. The request shall be in writing and shall include a full description of the methods and equipment
 proposed to be used and an explanation of the reasons for desiring to make the change. If approval is given, it shall be
 in writing and it will be on the condition that the Contractor will be fully responsible for producing construction work in
 conformity with contract requirements. If after trial use of the substituted methods or equipment, the Engineer
 determines that the work produced does not meet contract requirements, the Contractor shall discontinue the use of the
 substitute method or equipment and shall complete the remaining construction with the specified methods and
 equipment. The Contractor shall remove the deficient work and replace it with work of specified quality, or take such
 other corrective action as the Engineer may direct. No changes will be made in basis of payment for the construction
 items involved nor in contract time as a result of authorizing a change in methods or equipment under these provisions.
 8.08
 
 Preservation of Roadside Growth.
 
 In general, the Contractor shall take special precautions at all times to protect and preserve natural
 surroundings and roadside growth either within or adjacent to the location from damage or injury due to his/her
 operations. The Contractor shall not, except by written permission of the Engineer, remove, destroy, or trim such
 roadside trees or shrubs.
 Any trees or landscape features carelessly scarred or damaged by the Contractor’s operations shall be removed
 and replaced or neatly trimmed and restored as nearly as possible to the original condition as required by the Engineer.
 In general the Contractor shall be responsible for all damage to roadside growth due to his/her operations and shall,
 without compensation, satisfactorily repair or replace all such damage.
 All scars on trees shall be painted as soon as possible with an approved tree paint.
 8.09
 
 Delay and Suspension of Work.
 
 The Engineer shall have the authority to delay the commencement of the work and delay or suspend any
 portion thereof; for such period or periods as the Engineer may deem necessary because of conditions beyond the
 control of the Commonwealth, or the Contractor; or beyond the control of the Commonwealth and the Contractor; for
 the failure of the Contractor to correct conditions unsafe for the general public; for failure to carry out provisions of the
 Contract; for failure to carry out orders; for causes and conditions considered unsuitable for the prosecution of the work;
 for acts of third persons not a party to the Contract; or for any other cause, condition, or reason deemed to be in the
 public interest.
 Upon receipt of written order of the Engineer, the Contractor shall immediately delay the commencement of
 the work or delay or suspend any portion thereof in accordance with said order. No work shall be suspended or delayed
 without the prior written approval or order of the Engineer. The work shall be resumed when conditions so warrant or
 deficiencies have been corrected and the conditions of the Contract satisfied as ordered or approved in writing by the
 Engineer. The Contractor’s attention is also directed to the requirements of Subsections 7.09 and 7.18 which shall
 govern during any period of temporary or partial suspension of work.

 I.47
 
 Determination and Extension of Contract Time for Completion.
 
 The maximum time limit for the satisfactory completion of the work set forth in the Proposal is based upon the
 requirements of public convenience and the assumption that the Contractor will prosecute the work efficiently and with
 the least possible delay, in accordance with the maximum allowable working time per week as specified herein.
 It is an essential part of this Contract that the Contractor shall perform fully, entirely, and in an acceptable
 manner, the work required within the time stated in this Contract, except that the contract time for completion shall be
 adjusted as follows:
 A. If the Contractor does not receive the Notice to Proceed for a Federally Aided project within 70 days of
 bid opening (or for a Non-Federally Aided project, within 55 days of bid opening), it shall be entitled to an extension of
 time equivalent to the number of days beyond 70 (or 55) that it takes for the Contractor to receive the Notice to Proceed.
 Any such extension of time shall be reduced by the number of days beyond 14 days from the date of receipt of the
 Notice of Award that the Contractor takes to return the executed Contract and the required surety.
 B. In case the commencing of the work is delayed or any part thereof is delayed or suspended by the Party of
 the First Part (except for unsuitable weather, winter months, or reasons caused by the fault or neglect of the Contractor),
 the Contractor will be granted an extension of time in which to complete work or any portion of the work required under
 the Contract equivalent to the duration of the delay less a reasonable period of time within which the Contractor could
 have done necessary preliminary work.
 C. If satisfactory completion of the work shall require performance of work in greater quantities than those set
 forth in the Proposal, the time allowed for performance shall be increased in the same ratio as the total final estimate
 value of the contract items bears to their total bid value.
 D. When delay occurs due to reasonable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the
 Contractor, including but not restricted to “Acts of God”, to war, whether or not declared, civil war, insurrection,
 rebellion or revolution, or to any act or condition incident to any of the foregoing, acts of the Government, acts of the
 State or any political subdivision thereof, acts of other contracting parties over whose acts the Contractor has no control,
 fires, floods, epidemics, abnormal tides (not including Spring tides), severe coastal storms accompanied by high winds
 or abnormal tides, freezing of streams and harbors, abnormal time of Winter freezing or Spring thawing, interference
 from recreational boat traffic, use of beaches and recreational facilities for recreational purposes during the Summer
 season, abnormal ship docking and berthing, unanticipated use of wharves and storage sheds, strikes except those caused
 by improper acts or omissions of the Contractor, extraordinary delays in delivery of materials caused by strikes,
 lockouts, wrecks, freight embargoes, the time for completion of work shall be extended in whatever amount is
 determined by the Engineer to be equitable.
 An “Act of God” as used in this article is construed to mean an earthquake, flood, cyclone, or other cataclysmic
 phenomenon of nature beyond the power of the Contractor to foresee or make preparation in defense of. A rain,
 windstorm, or other natural phenomenon of normal intensity, based on United States Weather Bureau reports, for the
 particular locality and for the particular season of the year in which the work is being prosecuted, shall not be construed
 as an “Act of God” and no extension of time will be granted for the delays resulting therefrom.
 Within the scope of acts of the Government, consideration will be given to properly documented evidence that
 the Contractor has been delayed in obtaining any material or class of labor because of any assignment or preference
 ratings by the Federal Government or its agencies to War, Navy or other defense Contracts. E.
 In case the work
 is delayed by Public Service Corporations or Municipal Corporations see Subsection 5.05.
 F. Each Extra Work Order as issued will include a statement of additional time, if any, that is agreed upon by
 the Contractor and the Engineer as required for the completion of this Contract by reason of this Extra Work Order, and
 no other time allowance on account of the performance of the work covered by such Extra Work Order will be allowed.
 No extension of time will be granted for any delay or any suspension of the work due to the fault of the
 Contractor, nor if a request for an extension of time on account of delay due to any of the aforesaid causes is not filed
 within 15 days of the date of the commencement of the delay nor if the request is based on any claim that the contract
 period as originally established was inadequate.
 If the approved extended date of completion falls within the period from December 1st to March 15th, due to
 reasons above then the Contractor will be allowed the same number of days beyond December 1st, extended after March
 15th. The contract period has been carefully considered and has been established for reasons of importance to the Party
 of the First Part. This time limit will be enforced and any prospective Bidder who is not willing to accept this Contract
 
 I.48
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 with the intention of complying with the time limit is cautioned not to submit a bid.
 The probable slowdown or curtailment of work during inclement weather and winter months has been taken
 into consideration in determining the total time required to complete the project, hence no extension of time will be
 allowed due to this reason.
 8.11
 
 Failure to Complete Work on Time.
 
 On or before the date stated in the proposal for completion or the date to which the time of completion shall
 have been extended under the provisions of Subsection 8.10 the whole work shall have been performed in accordance
 with the terms of the Contract. The time in which the various portions and the whole of the Contract are to be performed
 and the work is to be completed is an essential part of the Contract.
 In case the work embraced in the contract shall not have been physically completed by the time stipulated
 therein (according to the foregoing requirements) the Contractor shall pay to the Party of the First Part a designated sum
 per day for the entire period of overrun in accordance with the following Schedule of Deductions. In the event the
 Contract has been substantially completed and the project opened for traffic as directed in writing by the Engineer, but
 physical completion of the work is subject to delay because of minor uncompleted items which do not impair the
 usefulness of the project, the designated sum per day shall be 1/2 the charges shown. In addition to the daily charge, the
 Contractor shall pay without reimbursement the entire cost of all traffic officers, railroad flagmen and inspectors the
 Engineer or the Chief Engineer of the railroad determines to be necessary during the period of overrun of time.

 In the event the physical work embraced in the Contract has been completed and accepted in writing by the
 Chief Engineer but there remains to be submitted to the Department by the Contractor any reports or other documents in
 accordance with the provisions of the Contract, the Contract shall not be considered satisfactorily completed within the
 meaning of Section 39G of Chapter 30 of the General Laws until the receipt of such reports or documents by the
 Department, but the designated sum per day during this interval shall be zero.
 Whatever sum of money may become due and payable to the Party of the First Part by the Contractor under
 this Subsection may be retained out of money belonging to the Contractor in the hands and possession of the Party of the
 First Part. It is agreed that this Subsection shall be construed and treated by the parties to the Contract not as imposing a
 penalty upon said Contractor for failing fully to complete said work as agreed on or before the time specified in the
 Proposal, but as liquidated damages to compensate said Party of the First Part for all additional costs incurred by said
 Party because of the failure of the Contractor fully to complete said work on or before the date of completion specified
 in the Proposal.
 Permitting the Contractor to continue and finish the work or any part of it after the time fixed for its
 completion, or after the date to which the time for completion may have been extended, shall in nowise operate as a
 waiver on the party of the Party of the First Part of any of its rights under the Contract.

 Default Termination.
 
 If the Contractor shall be adjudged a bankrupt, or if the Contractor shall make a general assignment for the
 benefit of his/her creditors, or if a receiver of his/her property shall be appointed, or if the work to be done under the
 Contract shall be abandoned, or if the Contract or any part thereof shall be sublet without the previous written consent of
 the Party of the First Part, or if the Contract or any claim thereunder shall be assigned by the Contractor otherwise than
 as herein specified, or if at any time in the Engineer’s judgment and the Engineer so certifies in writing to the Party of
 the First Part that the work, or any part thereof, is unnecessarily or unreasonably delayed, or that the Contractor has
 violated any of the provisions of the Contract, the Party of the First Part may notify the Contractor to discontinue all
 work, or any part thereof. Such notice shall be given to the Contractor in writing and thereupon the Contractor shall
 discontinue such work or such part thereof, as the Party of the First Part may designate, and the Party of the First Part
 shall require the surety or sureties to complete the Contract.
 If the Engineer shall certify that the rate of progress is not satisfactory, the Party of the First Part may instead of
 notifying the Contractor to discontinue all work or any part thereof, notify him/her from time to time to increase the
 force, equipment and plant, or any of them, employed on the whole or any part of the work, stating the amount of
 increase required to insure the proper completion of the work. The Contractor shall provide and maintain, at no
 additional cost to the Department, any lights necessary to protect the work or the traveling public, for the safety of
 his/her construction forces and to insure the proper construction, inspection and prosecution of the work (see
 Subsections 7.09 and 7.10). Unless the Contractor shall, within five days after any such notice, increase his/her force,
 equipment and plant to the extent required therein, and maintain and employ the same from day to day until the
 completion of the work or such part thereof or until the conditions as to the rate of progress shall, in the Engineer’s
 judgment, be fulfilled, the Party of the First Part may employ and direct the labors of such additional force, equipment
 and plant as may, in the Engineer’s judgment, be necessary to insure the completion of the work or such part thereof
 within the time specified, or at the earliest possible date thereafter, and charge the expense thereof to the Contractor.
 Neither the notice from the Party of the First Part to the Contractor, to increase his/her force, equipment or plant, nor the
 employment of additional force, equipment or plant by the Party of the First Part shall be held to prevent a subsequent
 notice from the Party of the First Part to him/her to discontinue work under the provisions of the preceding portion of
 this article.
 All expenses charged under this article shall be deducted and paid by the Party of the First Part out of any
 moneys then due or to become due the Contractor under the Contract, or any part thereof, and in such accounting the
 Party of the First Part shall not be held to obtain the lowest figures for the work of completing the Contract or any part
 thereof, or for insuring its proper completion, but all sums actually paid therefor shall be charged to the Contractor. In
 case the expenses so charged are less than the sum which would have been payable under the Contract if the same had
 been completed by the Contractor, the Contractor shall be entitled to receive the difference; and in case such expenses
 shall exceed the said sum, the Contractor shall pay the amount of the excess to the Party of the First Part, upon
 completion of the work without further demand being made therefor.
 8.13
 
 Convenience Termination.
 
 If the Department determines that it is in the public interest to do so, the Department may notify the Contractor
 to discontinue all work, or any part thereof. Such notice shall be given to the Contractor in writing and thereupon the
 Contractor shall discontinue such work, or such part thereof, as the Department may designate.
 If the Department notifies the Contractor to discontinue all work, or any part thereof, the Department shall pay
 and the Contractor shall accept, as full payment for all work done and materials provided, a sum agreed to by the
 Contractor and the Department or, if a sum cannot be agreed upon, the sum of (A) plus (B) determined as follows:
 A. For Construction Related Costs
 (1) The actual costs for direct labor (direct labor costs shall include the actual salary costs of laborers,
 equipment operators, truck drivers, steel workers and other trades persons up to and including working
 foremen.
 The costs of general superintendence shall be considered included in field and/or home office overhead.), materials (less
 salvage value, if any) and use of equipment (determined in accordance with subsection 9.03 of the Standard
 Specifications), plus 10% of this total for overhead (the 10% additive is inclusive of both field and home office
 overhead); and
 
 I.50
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 (2) The actual cost for Salary Related Costs such as Workmen’s Compensation and Liability Insurance,
 Health, Welfare and Pension benefits, Social Security deductions, and Employment Security Benefits; and
 (3) 10% of the total of (1) and (2) for profit; and
 (4) The estimated proportionate cost of surety bonds; and
 (5) The actual cost to the Contractor for work performed by a subcontractor, plus 10% of such cost.
 No allowance shall be made for general superintendence and the use of small tools and manual equipment.
 General superintendence is that next level above the working foreman. The costs of general superintendence as well as
 use of small tools and manual equipment shall be considered included in field and/or home office overhead.
 
 B. For Discontinuance Costs
 The reasonable and necessary costs of storage, transportation and other costs incurred for the preservation,
 protection or disposition of the discontinued work which are pre-approved by the Department to be determined as
 follows:
 (1) The actual costs for direct labor (Direct Labor costs shall include the actual salary costs of laborers,
 equipment operators, truck drivers, steel workers and other trades persons up to and including working foremen. The
 costs of general superintendence shall be considered included in field and/or home office overhead.), materials (less
 salvage value, if any) and use of equipment (determined in accordance with subsection 9.03 of the Standard
 Specifications), plus 10% of this total for overhead (the 10% additive is inclusive of both field and home office
 overhead); and
 (2) The actual cost for Salary Related Costs such as Workmen’s Compensation and Liability Insurance,
 Health, Welfare and Pension benefits, Social Security deductions, and Employment Security Benefits.
 No allowance shall be made for general superintendence and the use of small tools and manual equipment.
 General superintendence is that next level above the working foreman. The costs of general superintendence as well
 as use of small tools and manual equipment shall be considered included in field and/or home office overhead.
 The reasonable and necessary legal costs of work discontinuance, plus an additive of 10% for overhead (the
 additive is inclusive of both field and home office overhead), is allowable. The legal costs for litigation and/or
 negotiation purposes with the Department in settlement of said discontinuances is not allowable.
 Any other reasonable and necessary costs for discontinuance that are pre-approved by the Department, plus an
 additive of 10% for overhead (the additive is inclusive of both field and home office overhead).
 When requested by the Department, the Contractor shall furnish itemized statements of the cost of the work
 performed and shall give the Department (and/or the Department’s Auditors) access to any and all financial and/or
 project records and documents, relating thereto. Unless the Contractor, when requested to do so, furnishes such itemized
 statements and access to any and all financial and/or project records and documents, the Contractor shall not be entitled
 to payment for the work for which such information is sought by the Department.
 The Contractor shall not be paid and the Contractor shall not have any claim for loss of anticipated profits or
 for any costs or profit in addition to those stipulated above; for loss of expected reimbursement or for any increased
 expenses resulting directly or indirectly from the discontinuance of any or all work or from unbalanced allocation,
 among the contract items, of overhead expense on the part of the bidder and subsequent loss of expected reimbursement
 therefor or any other cause.
 The Contractor shall incorporate the provisions of this section as provisions in its contracts with each of their
 subcontractors.
 The authority of the Department under this section shall be in addition to the authority of the Department
 and/or Engineer under other sections of these specifications.

 SECTION 9.00
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 9.01
 
 Measurement of Quantities.
 
 The quantities of the various items of work performed shall be determined for purposes of payment by the
 Engineer and by the Contract for purposes of the certification(s) of work performed that are generally required by law
 and specifically by the provisions hereof.
 Upon the completion of the work and before final payment is made the Engineer will make final measurements
 to determine the quantities of the various items of work performed, as the basis for final settlement. All measurements
 shall be made according to the United States standard units of measurements.
 The method of measurement and computations to be used in determination of quantities of material furnished
 and of work performed under the Contracts shall be selected by the Engineer.
 Unless otherwise specified, longitudinal measurements for area computations will be made horizontally, and no
 deductions will be made for individual fixtures having an area of one square meter or less. Unless otherwise specified,
 transverse measurements for area computations will be the neat dimensions shown on the plans or ordered in writing by
 the Engineer.
 Structures will be measured according to neat lines shown on the plans or as altered to fit field conditions.
 All items which are measured by the meter, such as pipe, culverts, guardrail, underdrains, etc., will be
 measured parallel to the base or foundation upon which such structures are placed, unless otherwise shown on the plans.
 In computing volumes of excavation the average end area method or other methods acceptable to the Engineer
 will be used.
 When the term “gage” refers to the measurement of wire, it will mean the wire gage specified in the AASHTO
 Designation M 32.
 All materials which are specified for measurement by mass shall be weighed on standard scales furnished by
 and at the expense of the Contractor. Such scales shall be sealed at the expense of the Contractor as often as is necessary
 to insure their accuracy. A sworn weigher to be compensated by the Contractor shall weigh all materials required to be
 weighed as above provided. The weighing of such materials may be witnessed by the Engineer. If materials are shipped
 by rail or trucks, the car masses or quarry masses may be accepted, but scales shall be used as above, if so directed.
 Mass slips shall be provided for each shipment of material weighed. Each mass slip shall be signed by the sworn
 weigher. The mass slips shall be countersigned on delivery by the Engineer and no mass slip not so countersigned shall
 be included for payment under the Contract.
 When requested by the Contractor and approved by the Engineer in writing, material specified to be measured
 by the cubic meter may be weighed and such masses will be converted to cubic meters for payment purposes. Factors
 for conversion from mass measurement to volume measurement will be determined by the Engineer and shall be agreed
 to by the Contractor before such method of measurement of pay quantity is used.
 The term “lump sum” when used as a unit of payment will mean complete payment for the work described in
 the Contract.
 When a complete structure or structural unit (in effect, “lump sum” work) is specified as the unit of
 measurement, the unit will be construed to include all necessary fittings and accessories.
 When standard manufactured items are specified such as fence, wire, plates, rolled shapes, pipe conduit, etc.,
 and these items are identified by gage, unit mass, section dimensions, etc., such identification will be considered to be
 nominal mass or dimensions. Unless more stringently controlled by tolerances in cited specifications, manufacturing
 tolerances established by the industries involved will be accepted.
 9.02
 
 Scope of Payments.
 
 The Party of the First Part will pay and the Contractor shall receive and accept the compensation as herein
 provided, in full payment for furnishing all materials, labor, tools and equipment and for performing all work
 contemplated and embraced under the Contract, also for all loss or damage arising out of the nature of the work, or from
 
 I.52
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 the action of the elements (except as specified in Subsection 7.18), or from any unforeseen difficulties or obstructions
 which may arise or be encountered during the prosecution of the work (except as set forth in Subsection 4.04) until its
 final approval by the Party of the First Part, and for all risks of every description connected with the prosecution of the
 work, also for all expenses incurred by or in consequence of the suspension or discontinuance of the said prosecution of
 the work as herein specified, and for any infringement of patent, trademark or copyright, and for completing the work in
 an acceptable manner according to the plans and specifications.
 The payment of any current estimate, or any retained percentage shall in no way constitute an acknowledgment
 of the acceptance of the work or in no way or degree prejudice or affect the obligation of the Contractor, at his/her own
 cost and expense, to repair, correct, renew or replace any defects and imperfections in the construction of, or in the
 strength of, or quality of materials used in or about the construction of the work under Contract and its appurtenances, as
 well as all damages due or attributable to such defects: which defects, imperfections or damages shall have been
 discovered on or before the final inspection and acceptance of the work. The Engineer shall be the sole judge of such
 defects, imperfections, or damages and the Contractor shall be liable to the Party of the First Part for failure to correct
 the same as provided herein (also see Subsection 7.20).
 9.03
 
 Payment for Extra Work.
 
 A. Payment for work for which there is a unit price provided for in the Contract.
 Where the Contract contains a unit price for work and the Engineer orders Extra Work for work of the same
 kind as other work contained in the Contract and is performed under similar physical conditions, the Contractor shall
 accept full and final payment at the Contract unit prices for the accepted quantities of Extra Work done.
 No allowance will be made for any increased expenses or any damages whatsoever.
 B. Payment for work or materials for which no price is contained in the Contract.
 If the Engineer directs, the Contractor shall submit promptly in writing to the Engineer an offer to do the
 required work on a lump sum or unit price basis, as specified by the Engineer. The stated price, either lump sum or unit
 price, shall be divided so as to show that it is the sum of: (1) the estimated cost of direct labor, materials, and the use of
 equipment, plus 10 percent of this total for overhead: (2) plus the actual cost of Workmen’s Compensation and Liability
 Insurance, Health, Welfare and Pension benefits, Social Security deductions, Employment Security Benefits, and such
 additional fringe benefits which the Contractor is required to pay as a result of Union Labor Agreements and/or is
 required by authorized governmental agencies: (3) plus 10 percent of the total of (1) and (2); (4) plus the estimated
 proportionate cost of surety bonds.
 Unless an agreed lump sum and/or unit price is obtained from above and is so stated in the Extra Work Order
 the Contractor shall accept as full payment for work or materials for which no price agreement is contained in the
 Contract an amount equal to the following: (1) the actual cost for direct labor, material (less value of salvage, if any)
 and use of equipment, plus 10 percent of this total for overhead: (2) plus actual cost of Workmen’s Compensation and
 Liability Insurance, Health, Welfare and Pension benefits, Social Security deductions, and Employment Security
 Benefits: (3) plus 10 percent of the total of (1) and (2); (4) plus the estimated proportionate cost of surety bonds. For
 work performed by a Subcontractor, the Contractor shall accept as full payment therefor an amount equal to the cost to
 the Contractor of such work as determined by the Engineer, plus 10 percent of such cost.
 No allowance shall be made for general superintendence and the use of small tools and manual equipment.
 The Contractor shall, when requested by the Engineer, furnish itemized statements of the cost of the work
 ordered and give the Engineer access to all accounts, bills and vouchers relating thereto, and unless the Contractor shall
 furnish such itemized statements, access to all accounts, bills and vouchers, the Contractor shall not be entitled to
 payment for any items of extra work for which such information is sought by the Engineer.
 C. Equipment Rates.
 In the event there arises the need for determination of costs of use of equipment as part of “actual costs” or
 “cost of performance” or “damages” under Subsections 4.04, 7.16, 8.05, 9.02 and/or 9.03, or under Chapter 30 of the
 Massachusetts General Laws, such costs for use of equipment shall be established in accordance with the following:
 (1) “Construction equipment” as used herein means equipment in sound workable condition, either owned or
 controlled by the Contractor or the Subcontractor at any tier, or obtained from a commercial rental source, and furnished
 for use under the contract.
 (2) Allowable hourly ownership and operating costs for contractor-owned or subcontractor-owned equipment
 shall be determined as follows:
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 I.53
 
 (a) Actual cost data from the Contractor’s accounting and operating records shall be used whenever such
 data can be determined for hourly ownership and operating costs for each piece of equipment, or groups of similar serial
 or series equipment. Actual costs shall be limited to booked costs of the annual accounting period or periods during
 which the equipment was utilized on the Contract, and will not include estimated costs not recorded and identifiable in
 the Contractor’s formal accounting records. The Contractor shall afford Department auditors full access to all
 accounting, equipment usage, and other records necessary for development or confirmation of actual hourly cost rates
 for each piece of equipment, or groups of similar serial or series equipment. The Contractor’s refusal to give such full
 access shall invalidate any request or claim for payment of the equipment costs. When costs cannot be determined from
 the Contractor’s records, hourly equipment cost rates may be determined under (b) and (c) below.
 (b) When the Department ascertains that it is not practicable to determine actual equipment cost rates
 from the Contractor's records, hourly equipment cost rates for equipment owned by the Contractor may be determined
 by the use of rate schedules (with adjustments) contained in the Rental Rate Blue Book (Volumes 1 and 2) published by
 Dataquest Incorporated; said publication is incorporated herein by reference.
 The contractor shall provide to the Department, in a format prescribed by the Department, sufficient descriptive
 ownership and operating records and documentation for each piece of equipment subject to the extra work so that the
 equipment rates may be determined and adjusted from the aforementioned Dataquest Rental Rate Blue Book as follows:
 (1) Hourly equipment rates shall be developed by dividing monthly rates contained in the Rental
 Rate Blue Book by 176 hours per month (the weekly, hourly and daily rates listed in the Rental Rate Blue Book will not
 be used);
 (2) Equipment rates shall in all cases be adjusted by application of the Rate Adjustment Tables (for
 machine age adjustment) plus adjustments to eliminate Equipment Overhead plus Regional Adjustments plus
 adjustments to the CFC to reflect for the equipments age; and
 (3) Equipment operating rates shall be further reduced by 20% to eliminate duplicate and excessive
 costs, except that the rates shall instead be reduced by 75% to determine standby equipment rates.
 The number of equipment hours to be paid for under the extra work or force account work shall be the number
 of hours that the equipment is actually used on a specific extra work or force account activity.
 The current revisions to Dataquest's Rental Rate Blue Book will be used in establishing equipment rates. The
 "current revision" applicable to specific extra work or force account work will be the revision in effect (the copyright
 date being the deciding factor) as of the Contractor's Notice to Proceed.
 In all cases, the Department reserves the right to utilize equipment rates based upon the contractor's actual
 equipment ownership costs, other equipment rate books and guides (i.e., Construction Equipment Ownership and
 Operating Expense Schedule, Region One published by the Army Corps of Engineer's) or hybrid rates determined to be
 reasonable by the Department.
 (c) In those cases where a 10 percent additive for overhead and profit is to be superimposed on the
 equipment costs as provided in Subsections 4.04, and 9.03B, equipment cost rates determined under (a) and (b) above
 shall exclude any overhead costs such as equipment insurance, licenses, or taxes. The 10 percent additive shall
 compensate the Contractor for all overhead costs, including equipment overhead, general superintendence, small tools,
 manual equipment, field overhead, and central office overhead. Where the 10 percent overhead additive is not
 applicable, overhead items clearly related to equipment, (equipment insurance, licenses, taxes), shall be includable in the
 equipment rates; provided, however, that such costs shall be identified and eliminated from any other direct or indirect
 costs or damages payable by the Department under the Contract. No element of profit shall be allowable in equipment
 cost rates for Contractor-owned equipment; it being understood that a 10 percent profit additive will be superimposed
 upon equipment costs when called for by the Contract.
 (3) Reasonable hourly costs of renting equipment are allowable subject to Contractor production of auditable
 records supporting actual costs incurred, provided further that:
 (a) Costs such as fuel, lubricants, and minor or running repairs incident to operating such rented
 equipment that are not included in the rental rate are allowable.
 (b) Costs incident to major repair and overhaul of rental equipment are not allowed.
 (c) Charges for equipment leased or rented from any division, subsidiary organization under common
 control, or business under common ownership, ordinarily will be reimbursable to the extent that they do not exceed the
 actual costs of ownership and operating costs determined as in (2), above. Rental cost of equipment leased or rented
 from any division, subsidiary, affiliate of the Contractor under common control, or business under common ownership,
 that has an established practice of renting out the same or similar equipment to unaffiliated parties, shall be allowed at
 
 I.54
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 rates higher than actual ownership and operating costs, provided that the Contractor furnishes the Department adequate
 documentation, including the rental and usage records for the same or similar equipment items, demonstrating a
 reasonable likelihood that the equipment would have been rented out if not used on this Contract, and that the rental
 rates charged are consistent with rates charged to unaffiliated parties and going market rates. Rental costs under a sale
 and leaseback arrangement will be allowable only up to the amount the Contractor would be allowed if the Contractor
 retained title.
 (4) Equipment cost rates determined in (2) and (3) shall be exclusive of labor cost of equipment operators.
 Such costs shall be reimbursable subject to Contractor production of auditable payroll and other records sufficient for
 determination of hours, pay rates, and reimbursable fringe costs as defined in Subsection 4.04 and above.
 (5) Except in cases of unit price or lump sum extra work orders approved by the Department before the work
 is done, actual reimbursable hours of equipment usage and operator time must be adequately documented by the
 Department force account records or Contractor field and office records maintained during performance of the work in a
 manner acceptable to the Department. Failure of the Contractor to so maintain time records which adequately segregate
 added equipment hours caused by extra work required by the Department, or caused by other Department actions cited
 in the Contractor’s claim for damages, from other equipment time worked on the Contract, when maintenance of such
 records would have been feasible, shall constitute a cardinal omission of the Contractor, invalidating any claim for
 equipment cost reimbursement.
 The above provisions constitute an advanced agreement made in general conformance with intent of Federal
 Acquisition Regulation 31.105, paragraph (d)(1), said intent being to maximize clarity of understanding and minimize
 possible disputes with respect to determination of reimbursable actual equipment costs under this Contract.
 9.04
 
 Partial Payments.
 
 The Engineer shall biweekly make an estimate of the total amount of the work done from one estimate to the
 next. The Department’s Computer Section will process the estimated value from the Engineer’s report. The Party of the
 First Part shall retain a portion of such estimated value, but not to exceed $500,000 on any one Contract as part security
 for the fulfillment of the Contract by the Contractor, and shall also retain from said estimates an amount sufficient to
 cover claims which it may have against the Contractor and claims filed pursuant to Chapter 149, Section 29 and Chapter
 30, Section 39A and F of the General Laws. The Party of the First Part shall pay biweekly to the Contractor while
 carrying on the work the balance not retained as hereinbefore provided. No such estimates or payment shall be required
 to be made when, in the Engineer’s judgment, the work is not proceeding in accordance with the provisions of the
 Contract, or when in his/her judgment the total value of the work done since the last estimate amounts to less than
 $1,000.00.
 There will be a retainage of ten (10) percent of the value of all planting items. For all other items of work there
 will be no retainage for the first fifty (50) percent of the bid price as determined by the Engineer. For the second fifty
 (50) percent of the bid price there will be a retainage of five (5) percent of the value of all items of work excluding
 planting items.
 Whenever the work is substantially complete, the Party of the First Part may, if it considers the amount retained
 to be in excess of the amount adequate for the protection of the Commonwealth and is required by statute, at its
 discretion, release to the Contractor all or a portion of such excess amount, and may cause the Contractor to be paid,
 temporarily or permanently, from time to time such portion of the reserve as it deems prudent.
 Upon presentation by the Contractor of certified copies of paid invoices, the Party of the First Part may include
 in the estimate, advance payments for acceptable reinforcing steel, structural steel, stone, piles, culvert pipe or other nonperishable materials purchased expressly for the work and delivered on the work or in approved storage places at the
 site, but which materials are not considered as erected or complete in place under the items of the Contract, and for
 which partial payment as specified above would not be made until such materials and items were erected or complete in
 place.
 If it is impossible due to lack of area on the site or other valid reason, the Contractor may request in writing
 permission from the Engineer to store materials off the site and still have the materials paid as material on hand and the
 Engineer may approve payment. This request will state the reason for the request, location of proposed storage site,
 methods that will be employed to insure that material is properly protected and the material will be used on the particular
 project, and any other information as may be deemed necessary in order to evaluate the request. No advance payment
 for material stored off the site will be made until written approval of the Engineer has been obtained. The amount to be

 included in the estimate will be determined by the Engineer up to a maximum of 100% of the value of the materials as
 shown by the certified copies of paid invoices. Payment will not be approved when the invoice value of such materials
 as determined by the Engineer, amounts to less than $1000.
 Deductions at rates and in amounts which are equal to the payments will be made from estimates as the
 materials are incorporated in the work.
 Payment for the materials, as aforesaid, shall not in itself constitute acceptance and any materials which do not
 conform to the specifications for same shall be rejected in accordance with the stipulation of Subsection 6.04.
 Payment for structural steel and aluminum, specifically purchased and received by fabricators for incorporation
 into a Department project may be requested by the Contractor and included in the current estimates in an amount not to
 exceed fifty (50) percent of the contract price. Certified paid invoices and material certifications must be submitted by
 the Contractor to the Department with the request for payment. The invoices must clearly identify the Department
 project for which the material is intended along with the material type and quantity. When payment is made, the raw
 material becomes the property of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. A document transferring ownership of the raw
 material to the Commonwealth shall be submitted to the Department immediately after payment is made. Such payment
 shall in no way release the Contractor from his/her responsibility for condition, protection and, in case of loss,
 replacement of such materials or from any liability resulting in any manner from the presence of such materials wherever
 they may be stored. Any material not conforming to the specifications shall be rejected in accordance with the
 stipulation of Subsection 6.04.
 In instances where the raw material is not in the process of fabrication, the material shall be segregated from
 other material, designated as “Property of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts”, and clearly marked to identify the
 project into which the material will be incorporated.
 All material shall be inspected at the fabricator’s plant by a representative of the Department prior to the
 submittal of invoices to ensure that all material has been received and is properly stored and segregated.
 For any item for which the payment is made on a lump sum basis, (except lump sum Bridge Structures) and for
 which payment may be allowed if the Contractor requests partial payment on such an item, the Contractor shall submit
 for approval by the Engineer, a schedule of the quantities and unit prices for the major components of the item. Each
 component part shall be considered as including all its concomitance so that the total cost listed for the components is
 the contract cost for the item. The approval of the schedule by the Engineer shall not be considered as a guarantee to the
 Contractor that the quantities shown on the schedule are the approximate quantities actually included in the lump sum
 item.
 The schedule is only for the purpose of estimating partial payments, and it shall not affect the contract terms in
 any way.
 The Contractor will be required to certify, in writing, that the work for which the Contractor is being paid on
 the estimate in question has in fact been done.
 9.05
 
 Final Acceptance and Final Payment.
 
 When in the opinion of the Chief Engineer the Contract has been satisfactorily completed and final acceptance
 has been voted by the Board of Commissioners, the Department Secretary shall inform the Contractor in writing of the
 date of such acceptance, upon which date the Contractor’s responsibility shall cease except as provided in his bond and
 as provided in Subsection 7.20.
 The Engineer shall, as soon as practicable after the physical completion of the Contract, make final estimate of
 the amount of work done thereunder and the value of such work. Within 65 days from and after the date the work has
 been accepted by the Board, the Party of the First Part shall forward to the Contractor a copy of the final estimate or
 semifinal estimate as stipulated in Chapter 30, Section 39G of the General Laws, as amended, together with an
 agreement form for his acceptance. After such acceptance has been filed with the Supervisor of Fiscal Management of
 the Department payments of the entire sum will be made, so found to be due thereunder after deducting therefrom all
 previous payments and all amounts to be kept and all amounts to be retained under the provisions of the Contract. All
 prior partial estimates and payments shall be subject to correction in the final estimate and payment. If within six
 months from the date the final estimate is forwarded to the Contractor, the Contractor has not filed a valid (as
 determined by the Engineer) written reason(s) for not accepting the final estimate, the final estimate will be considered
 acceptable to the Contractor and payment of the final estimate made.
 The acceptance by the Contractor of the final payment shall operate as and shall be a release to the Party of the

 CLEARING AND GRUBBING
 DESCRIPTION
 101.20
 
 General.
 
 This work shall consist of clearing, grubbing, cutting, removal and disposal of all vegetation and debris from
 areas either within or outside of the Right-of-Way as shown on the plans or designated by the Engineer. The work shall
 also include the preservation from injury or defacement of all vegetation and objects designated by the Engineer to remain.
 CONSTRUCTION METHODS
 101.60
 
 General.
 
 The burning of trees, brush, stumps, etc., will not be permitted. The Contractor shall provide other satisfactory
 methods of disposal without additional compensation.
 The Contractor shall obtain written permission of the Engineer for use of storage areas within the Right-of-Way
 requiring clearing and grubbing or selective clearing and thinning. Any clearing for the Contractor’s convenience shall be
 done at his/her own expense. All such areas shall be restored to a condition acceptable to the Engineer including
 necessary mulching, seeding, and planting without additional compensation.
 The Engineer shall be provided with notarized copies of agreements between the Contractor and owners of land
 used as disposal or storage areas.
 When fencing is installed outside normal clearing areas, every reasonable effort shall be made to preserve trees
 or shrubs whose removal is not essential to the installation of the fencing.
 Acceptable material obtained on the project may be used to produce wood chip mulch. The Contractor shall use
 an approved chipper and 6 millimeter knife setting as described under Subsection M6.04.3, Wood Chip Mulch. Material
 obtained from Elm trees shall not be accepted for use.
 Wood chips produced on the project from clearing and grubbing shall be stockpiled within the location and used
 where and as directed.
 Except for materials used for making wood chip mulch, the Contractor shall make all arrangements and
 negotiations necessary for the satisfactory disposal of trees, shrubs, stumps, roots, dead wood and other litter, in areas
 outside the Right-of-Way and in such manner that no condition or accumulation of material shall be permitted to disfigure
 or mar the finished landscape.
 101.61
 
 Clearing and Grubbing.
 
 II.4
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 The stumps of all trees, brush and major roots shall be grubbed and removed in all excavation areas and under all
 embankments where the original ground level is within 1 meter of the subgrade or slope of embankments.
 All trees, stumps, and brush shall be cut off within 150 millimeters of the ground in embankment areas where
 the original ground level is more than 1 meter below the subgrade or slope of embankments.
 Trees and shrubs that are specifically designated by the Engineer not to be cut, removed, destroyed or
 trimmed shall be saved from harm and injury.
 All damage done to trees by the Contractor’s operation and all branches of trees extending within the roadway
 shall be trimmed and painted where cut as directed to provide a 6 meter minimum vertical clearance including
 selective trimming of such trees as directed.
 101.62
 
 Selective Clearing and Thinning.
 
 A.
 General.
 The work under this item shall consist of the removal of hazardous growth and dead, dying or diseased plant
 material; the removal of groups and individual plants which interfere with the growth of more desirable types of trees
 and the clearing away of lesser growth that may obscure outstanding trees, tree groups, or scenic views. Any part of
 tree trunks or base of plant material located on the Location Lines shall be considered within the State Highway
 Limits.
 Densely wooded areas shall be thinned to provide space for healthy growth by eliminating thinner, weaker
 trees and the reduction of number of varieties.
 The Contractor’s attention is called to the requirements for work under this item. The desired appearance to
 be attained in certain areas of heavy growth may require three or more operations. First, the obvious dead, dying and
 diseased trees and undergrowth shall be cut and cleared out of the area. This work includes removal of any previously
 fallen trees, branches, uprooted stumps and other debris as directed. Next, the area is to be thinned out, as directed, by
 removing the less desirable trees and brush which interfere with the growth of the better plant material. Finally, clear
 out lesser growth which may obscure outstanding trees, tree groups or scenic views.
 Tree up-branching and shaping under this item will be restricted to trees which have limbs and branches
 restricting sight distance, extending over roadways, shoulders, turn outs, etc. Up-branching or trimming will be
 required to produce a 6 meter minimum vertical clearance over all locations described hereinbefore, and the removal
 of limbs and branches involved in this operation shall be accomplished as outlined hereafter.
 B.
 Prosecution of Work.
 (Supplementing Subsection 8.03.) Quality of work must conform with accepted tree trimming practices.
 All trimming and pruning shall conform to recognized tree surgery practices, and particular note should be
 made that painting with an approved tree dressing or paint will be required on all cuts 50 millimeters or over in
 diameter.
 The dressing or paint shall be applied no later than two days after the cuts are made.
 Recognized tree surgery practices include among many others, the fact that all limbs and branches which
 require removal and all stubs regardless of age must be cut flush either to a union with the next larger sound limb or
 branch or flush to the trunk of the tree.
 The cutting shall be performed by experienced woodsmen. Trained tree climbers are required for pruning of
 tall growth. Care shall be exercised by the Contractor to prevent injury to trees and shrubs designed to be preserved.
 Any injury to limbs, bark or roots of such plants shall be repaired by the Contractor, as directed, or the plants replaced
 without additional compensation for such repair or replacement.
 C.
 Cutting and Treatment of Stumps and Stubble.
 Standing trees, undesirable brush and existing stumps to be removed shall be cut flush with the ground and a
 50 millimeter tolerance permitted and the resulting stumps or stubble then brushed or sprayed with a chemical spray
 material conforming to the requirements of Subsection M9.02.0 of Division III, Materials.
 Application shall be by brush or spray so as to give complete coverage and wetting to the point of runoff.
 This application shall be completed within two days after the cutting.
 As the specified chemical herbicide is harmful to desirable roadside growth, the Contractor shall apply the
 chemical in such a manner that damage will not occur either from the direct spray or from drift of the chemical to any
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department

 II.5
 
 desirable growth.
 The Contractor shall use all necessary precautions to prevent injury to crops or damage to other desirable
 growth on private abutting property, as well as to those within the Right-of-Way, and shall assume full responsibility
 for any damage.
 D.
 Disposal of Cuttings.
 The Contractor may dispose of cut material by processing into a wood chip mulch as described in Subsection
 M6.04.3 and spreading uniformly throughout the cleared and thinned areas as directed by the Engineer.
 101.63
 
 Disposal of Trees.
 
 All trees to be cleared shall become the property of the Contractor, and the satisfactory disposal of the wood in
 such trees outside the Right-of-Way shall become his/her responsibility.
 The trees, including cuttings and slash, shall be disposed of after cutting as soon as practicable and in such a
 manner as not to detract from the appearance of the roadside.
 If the existing ground in the area is disturbed by any of the work or equipment, the Contractor shall rough-grade
 and loam and seed if necessary the disturbed areas, if so directed, without additional compensation.
 101.64
 
 Disposal of Stumps and Brush.
 
 After removal, all stumps including the major root system shall be disposed by the Contractor at his/her own
 responsibility outside the layout where the material will not cause obstruction to streams and will not detract from the
 appearance of the roadside.
 101.65
 
 Disposal of Dutch Elm Diseased Wood.
 
 Dutch Elm diseased wood shall be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of General Law, Chapter 87,
 Section 5 and Chapter 132, Sections 8 and 11, as amended, and in accordance with any additional local regulations.
 Where the work includes the removal of elm trees or the limbs of elm trees, such trees or limbs thereof shall be
 disposed of immediately after cutting or removal and in such a manner as to prevent the spread of Dutch Elm disease.
 This shall be accomplished by covering them with earth to a depth of at least
 150 millimeters in areas outside the highway location where the Contractor has arranged for disposal.
 Where the work includes the removal and disposal of stumps of elm trees, such stumps shall be completely
 disposed of immediately after cutting in the manner specified above.
 COMPENSATION
 101.80
 
 Method of Measurement.
 
 Clearing and grubbing shall be measured by the horizontal plane area and will be the number of hectares within
 the limiting stations of the project and/or as designated by the Engineer and the outside limits of measurement shall extend
 to a point 1.5 meters beyond the top or bottoms of slopes, excluding existing roadway and shoulder surfaces, streams or
 bodies of water.
 Areas outside of the limits specified above, when cleared and grubbed in connection with the construction of
 fences shall be computed on the basis of a three meter width multiplied by the total length of fencing installed, and when
 done in connection with excavating ditches or trenches the width shall be limited to 1.5 meters beyond the outer edges of
 the excavation.
 Measurement of selective clearing and thinning will be based on the actual number of hectares which receive the
 required attention. Approximate locations will be shown on the plans or detail sheets and as designated in the field by the
 Engineer.
 Only such trees as have a shortest diameter of at least 250 millimeters and less than 600 millimeters shall be
 included in the item of Trees Removed (Diameter Under 600 Millimeters). Only such trees as have a shortest diameter of
 
 II.6
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 600 millimeters or more shall be included in the item of Trees Removed (Diameter
 600 Millimeters and Over).
 The item of Stumps Removed shall include the removal and satisfactory disposal of all tree stumps which remain
 in their original position and measure 250 millimeters or more in shortest diameter at the cutoff point, where the trees have
 been previously removed by others. A stump shall not be construed as a tree under these specifications unless the trunk
 extends over 2 meters above the average ground.
 Trees or stumps to be removed which have the shortest diameter specified for payment will be measured in place
 by the following procedure:
 Where the tree consists of a single trunk extending more than a 1 meter vertical height above the average natural
 ground line, the shortest diameter shall be measured at the 1 meter level above the average elevation of the original
 ground.
 Any tree whose main trunk separates into multiple trunks or which has limbs or branches growing out from the
 main trunk below the 1 meter level defined hereinbefore shall have its shortest diameter measured at the lowest point on
 the main trunk where multiple growth or branching out begins.
 The shortest diameter of a stump shall be measured at the cutoff except that where multiple growth begins below
 cutoff, the shortest diameter shall be measured at the main trunk where multiple growth begins.
 Measurement for payment under the respective items shall be such that any individual growth to be classed as a
 tree stump shall be measured in a manner to limit payment to one single tree or stump at each particular location of the
 individual growth. When multiple trunks with a common root system are separated at ground level each separate trunk
 shall be considered as an individual growth under these specifications.
 The quantity of trees or stumps to be paid for will be the number actually removed by the Contractor in the
 completed and accepted work as determined by count.
 Wood chip mulch produced from Clearing and Grubbing will be measured by the cubic meter (truck load
 measure) at time of spreading.
 101.81
 
 Basis of Payment.
 
 Clearing and Grubbing and Selective Clearing and Thinning will be paid for at the contract unit price per hectare.
 When Clearing and Grubbing is not included in the Proposal as a payment item, payment for any such work will
 be included in the items of Earth Excavation or Borrow except as herein provided for the removal of trees and stumps.
 The removal of trees, including the stumps thereof and required spray material will be paid for at the contract
 unit price each for the particular kind of work involved, as defined hereinbefore when a quantity is given in the Proposal
 under their respective items, otherwise this work will be paid for at the contract unit price for excavation or at the contract
 unit price per hectare of Clearing and Grubbing or Selected Clearing and Thinning, whichever is applicable. The contract
 unit price shall include the cost of all arrangements and methods required to protect from harm all existing overhead or
 underground installations. The contract unit price for the respective items shall not include any trees or stumps removed
 from the area paid for under the item of Clearing and Grubbing or Selected Clearing and Thinning.
 No payment shall be allowed for preparation and spreading of wood chip mulch used from areas included under
 Selective Clearing and Thinning. Wood chip mulch directed to be produced from Clearing and Grubbing shall be paid for
 complete in place at the contract unit price.
 Only such trees or stumps as have a shortest diameter of 250 millimeters and over, measured as stipulated in
 Subsection 101.80 shall be included for payment.

 A. Sequence of Operations.
 When required, the Contractor shall so prosecute his/her work that traffic will be maintained over and through
 the work with a maximum of safety and convenience in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 7.09, “Public Safety
 and Convenience”.
 The sequence of all excavation operations, earth or rock, shall be such as to insure the most efficient utilization
 of excavated materials into embankments (as specified in Section 150) and the use of a minimum amount of borrow.
 When the plans require excavation in areas in close proximity to existing roads, structures and utilities it shall be the
 responsibility of the Contractor at his/her expense to construct suitable drainage ditches or use other satisfactory means
 and methods to protect and maintain the stability of such roads, and structures located immediately adjacent to but outside
 the limits of excavation.
 The Contractor’s attention is directed to the requirements of the Prevention of Water Pollution and Erosion. The
 Contractor shall prosecute the work as to prevent the ponding of water. Each lift of excavation shall be visibly crowned to
 allow drainage of surface and rain water.
 B. Disposal of Excavated Materials.
 All suitable materials obtained from the excavation or from the removal of present structures shall be used either
 in the formation of embankments, shoulders, slopes, loam or clay hardening, etc., or for backfill under, over, or around
 structures, pipe culverts or drains and at such other places as directed and the material shall be placed and compacted in a
 manner conforming to the specifications for the particular type of work required without additional compensation. It shall
 be the Contractor’s responsibility to obtain from the Engineer approval for the use and placing of various materials
 encountered in excavation.
 It shall be the Contractor’s responsibility to dispose of material designated as unsuitable and any excavated
 material which is not required, except as noted in Paragraph C of this subsection, outside of the Right-of-Way in such a
 manner as not to obstruct streams or otherwise impair the drainage, appearance, safety or efficiency of any structure or any
 other part of the road.
 No materials from the excavation, nor from construction, shall be deposited in flood plains nor within

 Wetlands Protection Act. Notification to the Engineer, in writing, will be required wherein such filling has been
 authorized by the local Conservation Commission.
 No excavated material shall be placed outside of and adjacent to the Right-of-Way without the written approval
 of the Engineer. The Contractor shall certify he/she has proper releases from property owners within
 150 meters of Right-of-Way which is used as disposal areas for unsuitable material.
 The Contractor shall construct sod or other adequate retaining banks around perimeters of the disposal areas
 outside the project to protect existing roads, stream channels, and adjoining properties (including underground water
 supplies) against the spread of, or contamination by, the excavated material. Stream channels and ditches within and
 adjacent to the project shall be maintained as at present or as specifically altered by the design of the project.
 All waste areas shall be thoroughly stabilized by means of drains, proper grading, mulching, loaming and seeding
 as required to promote vegetation and to insure the areas will not be subject to erosion.
 C. Grading Outside of the Location.
 Where directed, earth, loam, or borrow of the kind required shall be used for grading outside of the Right-ofWay and the surface shall be raked, smoothed and rolled. Excavation shall be made as directed on slopes or surfaces
 outside of and adjoining the location.

 1 horizontal to 4 vertical or steeper. Rock cuts more than 8 meters in vertical height may be presplit in stages (lifts) at the
 option of the Contractor, provided that no stage shall be less than 3 meters in depth and further provided that no payment
 will be made for additional excavated quantities caused by offsetting presplitting holes beyond the specified face in the top
 on successive stages. Presplitting holes in successive stages shall be offset not more than 600 millimeters inside of the
 previously presplit face.
 Prior to the blasting of any rock for removal, the Contractor shall presplit the rock along the designated cut face
 by the method hereinafter described to produce a uniform plane of rupture, so that the resulting face will not be affected by
 subsequent fragmentation blasting and excavation operations.
 The Contractor shall adjust his/her blasting operations according to the characteristics and structure of the rock
 formation to obtain the required slope without fracturing the rock beyond the presplit face.
 The sequence of operations shall be as follows, unless otherwise directed:
 1. Remove all overburden soil within the areas of proposed fragmentation blasting to expose the rock surface.
 2. Drill 65 millimeter or 80 millimeter nominal diameter holes not more than 1 meter on centers along the top

 1 meter of the designated presplit face, unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer.
 The plane of presplitting slope as originally drilled shall not be penetrated by subsequent fragmentation blast
 holes.
 4. The Contractor shall inspect and test each hole to determine the possible presence of any obstruction before
 placing the charge. No loading shall be permitted until the hole is clear of all obstructions. Precautions shall be used in
 placing the charge to prevent caving-in of material from the wall of the hole.
 5. Cartridge explosives prepared and packaged by explosive manufacturing firms and approved by the
 Engineer shall be used in presplitting holes except, with prior permission of the Engineer, either of the following charges
 may be used as an alternative provided the results are satisfactory:
 (a) Continuous column commercial explosives manufactured especially for presplitting.
 (b) Multiple strands of high-strength detonating fuse (Primacord) taped together at 1.2 meter to
 1.8 meter intervals.
 6. The spacing of the dynamite charge in each hole shall be accomplished by securely taping (or attaching by
 other approved means) each piece of dynamite to the detonating fuse at the selected intervals or by deck-loading. If the
 latter method is used, the dynamite must be in intimate contact with the detonating fuse to assure detonation of all charges.
 7. All space in each hole not occupied with the explosive charge shall be filled with 9.50 millimeter crushed
 stone meeting the requirements of Materials Subsection M2.01.6. No other material or type of stemming will be
 permitted.
 8. The detonation of presplit charges shall precede the detonation of adjacent fragmentation charges within the

 Topsoil Excavated and Stacked.
 
 This work shall consist of removing topsoil and stacking it where and as directed in accordance with the relevant
 requirements of Sections 120 and 751.
 Such of the topsoil as will be selected, after testing by Department of material obtained from test pits, shall be
 stacked neatly outside the limits of the proposed slopes within the Right-of-Way or such material may be temporarily
 stacked by the Contractor outside the Right-of-Way for his/her own convenience, with the approval of the Engineer, in
 which case the Contractor shall be responsible for all arrangements and negotiations. If the material stacked outside the
 Right-of-Way is not available when needed for use on the project, the Contractor will furnish at his/her expense an equal
 volume of equal material.
 If the temporary storage areas outside the Right-of-Way require clearing and grubbing, the Contractor shall do
 such work without additional compensation.
 Storage areas shall be cleared, grubbed and rough graded so that maximum amount of stacked material will be
 available for reuse.
 The Contractor shall take reasonable care to avoid leaving any unsightly condition and to avoid unnecessary
 damage or injury to natural surroundings and roadside growth. The landscape shall be left in a satisfactory, neat and trim
 condition upon completion of the work.

 CONSTRUCTION METHODS
 140.60
 
 General.
 
 A. Sequence of Operations.
 The Contractor shall prosecute his/her work so as to conform to the requirements of Subsection 120.60A.
 B. Disposal of Excavated Materials.
 The Contractor shall prosecute his/her work so as to conform to the requirements of Subsection 120.60B.
 C. Cofferdams.
 Cofferdams for foundation construction shall be carried to adequate depths and heights, shall be safely designed
 and as watertight as necessary for the proper performance of the work which must be done inside them. Sheeting shall be
 driven to a sufficient depth below the proposed foundation grade to permit reasonable change in depth of the proposed
 foundation to a maximum of 750 millimeters except where solid rock is encountered. The interior dimensions shall be
 sufficient for the unobstructed and satisfactory completion of such construction work as pile driving, form building,
 inspection and pumping. Cofferdams which become tilted or are displaced during the process of building the substructure
 shall be righted, reset or enlarged as may be necessary to provide the necessary clearances and this shall be at the sole
 expense of the Contractor. Cofferdams shall be dewatered and the proposed masonry footings placed in the dry.
 Cofferdams shall be constructed so as to protect masonry against damage from a sudden rising of water and to
 prevent damage to the foundation by erosion. No part of the cofferdam shall be left in such a way as to extend into the
 substructure masonry, without written permission of the Engineer.
 Upon request, the Contractor shall submit plans to the Engineer for his/her information showing his/her proposed
 method of cofferdam construction prior to the start of such construction. The furnishing of such plans and methods shall
 not serve to relieve the Contractor of any of his/her responsibility for the safety of the work or the responsibility for the
 successful completion of the project.
 Where the plans indicate construction of a tremie concrete seal below the footing or if in the Engineer’s opinion a
 tremie seal is necessary, he/she may require the placing of underwater concrete of such dimensions as necessary to safely
 dewater the foundations and place the footing concrete in the dry.
 All tremie concrete seals shall be placed as shown on the plans or as directed by the Engineer.
 Before placing the underwater concrete, the inside walls of the cofferdam shall be thoroughly cleaned and the
 walls made sufficiently tight to reduce the velocity of water to less than 3 meters per minute. The elevation of the water
 inside the cofferdam shall be controlled during the placing and the curing of the concrete. Concrete shall not be placed in
 water having a temperature below 2 °C. No pumping of water shall be permitted while concrete is being placed nor until
 
 II.18
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 the concrete has cured a minimum of 24 hours. Once concreting has started the tremie shall not be moved laterally
 through the deposited concrete. When necessary to move the tremie it shall be lifted out of the concrete and moved to the
 new position. Unless otherwise directed by the Engineer, spacing of the tremies shall be at the Contractor’s option.
 After each excavation is completed, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer and no construction shall be started
 until the Engineer has approved the depth of the excavation and the character of the foundation material.
 Unless otherwise provided, all parts of the cofferdams shall be removed after the completion of the substructure,
 care being taken not to disturb or otherwise injure the finished masonry.
 Sheet piling used in the construction of cofferdams may be left in place at the option of the Contractor, provided
 it is cut off at an elevation as may be directed by the Engineer, and the cutoff portions are removed from the site.
 D. Excavation for Stepped Footings.
 Where the footings for bridges are shown stepped, the Contractor shall sheet and shore the existing ground so
 that adjacent sections of the footings will rest on undisturbed ground according to the pattern shown on the plans. The
 sheeting shall be strong enough to support the earth along the designated lines, tight enough to restrain the fines in the
 concrete, and shall be left in place to the extent required to hold the concrete that is to be placed against it. Before the
 concrete is placed, the sheeting shall be cut so that none of the sheeting will extend into the concrete. Shoring and bracing
 shall be removed. If rock is encountered, it shall be stepped to the pattern shown and sheeting will not be required.
 E. Water Control in Foundation Area.
 When concrete for the foundations of a structure is to be placed in the dry, the Contractor shall use such
 equipment and perform his/her operations in such a manner that boiling or other disturbances of the ground in the
 foundation area will be prevented and shall keep the area being excavated dry by such means that will prevent the entering
 of water through or from the adjacent ground, if such entering water could affect the stability of the foundation material or
 the adjacent ground or the foundations.
 No surface pumping will be allowed. Water shall be controlled by means of properly screened sumps or well
 points. If sumps are used, they shall be installed at strategic locations but not closer than 1.5 meters from the nearest edge
 of the footing.
 The contractor shall provide temporary diversion channels, excavations, embankments, sheeting, drains, flumes,
 well point dewatering systems, pumps, or other effective procedures or structures together with all labor, materials and
 equipment necessary for dewatering the foundation areas. Such work shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer, but
 such approval will not relieve Contractor of responsibility for the adequacy of construction, maintenance, operation and
 safety of the water control system. Upon completion of the work all temporary embankments and structures shall be
 removed from the site. All temporary excavations shall be backfilled in accordance with the applicable provisions of
 Section 150 for forming embankments or as directed.
 F. Shoring and Bracing of Trenches.
 Shoring and bracing of trenches and other excavations shall be in accordance with the requirements of the
 Department of Labor and Industries Industrial Bulletin No. 12, Section 10, dated April 19, 1967, and subsequent
 amendments.
 G. Excavation.
 Trenches for pipes, structural pipes, arches, and pipe arches shall be excavated to the required line and grade and
 of sufficient width to permit thorough tamping of backfill material under the haunches. Soft or unsuitable material
 existing below the required bedding grade shall be removed as directed and replaced with sand, gravel, crushed stone or
 other suitable material and thoroughly compacted. Rock or boulders shall be removed below the bedding grade as
 specified in Subsection 140.25.
 All materials excavated from pipe trenches and subdrain trenches and not used in the backfill of the trench will
 be used as part of the embankment, when deemed suitable for this purpose by the Engineer, and no deduction will be made
 from the in-place measurement of the embankment.
 If cross pipes, conduits, drains or other unforeseen obstacles are encountered during the excavation, the proposed
 line and grade of the pipe may be altered, but only as directed by the Engineer.
 When pipes, structural pipes, arches and pipe arches are to be installed in new embankments, the Contractor shall
 first construct and compact the embankment to an elevation at least 600 millimeters above the proposed flow line.
 When culverts, storm drains or sewer pipes are to be installed in roadway areas on traveled ways, the edges of
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department

 II.19
 
 the trench through the pavement shall be cut to a neat line, using an approved pavement breaker or power saw.
 140.61
 
 Channel Excavation.
 
 The excavation shall be made and the bank sloped as shown on the plans or as directed.
 Unless otherwise directed, the banks outside of the limits of a bridge structure shall be cut to a
 1 vertical to 2 horizontal slope. Within the limits of the bridge structure, the banks shall be cut to the slope required for
 revetment.
 No waste or surplus excavation shall be left within 1.5 meters from the edge of the ditch or channel. Any such
 surplus or waste material shall be spread in a thin, uniform layer. All ditches and channels constructed on the project shall
 be maintained to the required cross section and shall be kept free from debris until final acceptance.
 140.62
 
 Class B Rock Excavation.
 
 If a rock is encountered in a location such that it may be used as a part of a base, footing, wing, or abutment of
 any structure, it shall not be removed. The surface of all rock or other hard material upon which masonry is to be placed
 shall be freed from all loose fragments, cleaned and cut to a firm surface. The surface shall be level, stepped or serrated,
 as directed by the Engineer.
 All structures shall be founded on uniform bearing materials. If rock is encountered at portions of the bottom of
 the foundation for bridges, box culverts, structural plate pipe, structural plate pipe arches and end walls and wingwalls that
 are a part of these structures, the rock shall be removed to a minimum depth of
 300 millimeters below the bottom of foundation for a depth of fill on the structure up to 8 meters. For fills over 8 meters
 the depth of excavation shall be increased 25 millimeters for every additional 600 millimeters of fill. The excavation shall
 be backfilled with gravel borrow and compacted. Payment for such excavation will be made under the item for Class B
 Rock Excavation. Where wingwalls are not integral with the bridge or culvert the overdepth excavation will not be
 required.
 140.63
 
 Drainage Structures Abandoned or Removed.
 
 The present castings shall be carefully removed. They shall be satisfactorily stored and protected until they are
 required for use or until they are removed from the project by the owners.
 Inlets and outlets of structures to be abandoned shall be plugged with brick masonry not less than
 200 millimeters in thickness, conforming to Section 201. Upper portions of the masonry shall be removed to a depth of
 900 millimeters below the finished grade at the location designated by the Engineer, and the structures shall be completely
 filled with selected excavated material placed in 150 millimeter layers and thoroughly compacted.
 The existing masonry of structures to be removed shall be completely removed.
 The cavity shall be completely filled with selected excavated materials placed in 150 millimeter layers and
 thoroughly compacted.
 COMPENSATION
 140.80
 
 Method of Measurement.
 
 All classes of excavation for structures will be measured in their original position by the cross section method
 except that where such measurement is impracticable the volume shall be measured by such other methods as the Engineer
 may determine. In calculating excavation for structures the sides of the excavation will be considered vertical.
 Bridge Excavation shall be measured as follows:
 Unless otherwise shown on the plan the quantity of excavation shall be computed within the following limits:
 1. Horizontally to vertical planes 300 millimeters outside of and parallel to the neat lines of masonry bases or
 footings.
 
 II.20
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 2. Horizontally to vertical planes 500 millimeters outside of and parallel to the inside walls of structural plate
 pipes and arches (spans 2.44 meters or more and without masonry footings) at their widest dimensions.
 3. Horizontally to vertical limits of crushed stone or gravel borrow for bridge foundation as shown on the
 plans.
 4. Vertically from the bottom of the earth excavation limits of proposed roadway and/or design slopes carried
 through the structure location or existing ground surface, whichever is lower, to the bottom of the required excavation as
 determined by the Engineer.
 In areas where unsuitable material is removed and backfilled under Item 123, Muck Excavation, excavation of
 the backfill will be measured horizontally and vertically as above except the upper limit of excavation shall be 600
 millimeters above the swamp or 600 millimeters above any water that is present, whichever is higher.
 Where masonry is ordered removed from existing substructures, only the actual quantity ordered removed shall
 be measured for payment.
 Excavation made outside the lines prescribed for payment will be considered as made for the Contractor’s
 convenience and will not be included for payment under any item of excavation, nor will the refilling of any such area be
 included under any item of filling material.
 Class A Trench Excavation shall be measured as follows:
 For masonry culverts (having a clear square span of less than 2.44 meters), inlets and walls, a width of
 300 millimeters outside the base of the masonry section shown on the plans and to the depth required. Trench excavation
 for walls in cuts shall include only that portion below the elevation of the subgrade adjacent to the wall. For walls where
 an embankment is proposed, trench excavation shall be only that portion between the existing ground and the bottom of
 the foundation. All other Class A Trench Excavation will be measured according to the amount of materials removed to
 the lines and grades shown on the plans or as directed.
 Class B Trench Excavation shall be measured as follows:
 For pipe culverts, drains and water pipes the depth of excavation shall be measured from the bottom of the pipe
 barrel to the bottom of the roadway excavation or existing ground, whichever is lower, as determined above the center line
 of the pipe, less 1.5 meters. The width of excavation shall be 1 meter greater than the rated inside diameter of the pipe up
 to a point 1.5 meters above the bottom of the pipe barrel and a width above that point equivalent to the base width plus an
 allowance for 1 to 1 slopes on the sides of the trench for the measured depth described above. The allowance for 1 to 1
 slopes will be included regardless of the actual scope excavated or whether sheeting or shoring is used that is not included
 for payment under Section 950. The sides of the trench excavation will be considered vertical when sheeting is used and
 paid for separately under Section 950 and the width shall be1 meter greater than the inside diameter of the pipe. If
 necessary to obtain a satisfactory foundation for pipe culverts, drains and water mains, trenches shall be excavated deeper
 than normally required for bedding the pipe and such excavation below the barrel of the pipe will be measured for
 payment under this item. The width of trench shall be1 meter greater than the rated inside diameter of the pipe and the
 depth shall be the actual depth as directed by the Engineer.
 Class B Rock Excavation shall be measured as follows:
 Pay limit for rock excavation actually removed in all masonry culverts, walls and bridges, will be up to a limit of
 300 millimeters outside of the foundation. This rock excavation in cuts shall include only that portion below the limits of
 payment of Roadway Earth Excavation or Class A Rock Excavation and in embankment only that portion below the
 surface of the existing ground.
 Pay limit for rock actually excavated in pipe trenches will be made to a width of 600 millimeters greater than the
 rated inside diameter of the pipe barrel, providing rock extends to that width. The maximum depth of rock to be paid for
 shall be equal to the difference in depth between the top of the original rock in the trench and a line 300 millimeters below
 the bottom of the outside of the pipe barrel. No part of any rock remaining in the trench shall come within 150 millimeters
 of any portion of the pipe. Rock actually excavated in the construction of catch basins, manholes, and leaching basins will
 be calculated on a basis of
 300 millimeters outside of the outer walls and 150 millimeters below the bottom of the structure. Rock excavation in
 subdrain trenches will be measured as specified above for pipe trenches.
 Rock excavation in post and bound holes not already paid for in previous rock excavation shall be based on an
 area of 0.4 square meters multiplied by the depth of rock encountered in the post or bound hole required plus 150
 millimeters.

 equipment.
 CONSTRUCTION METHODS
 148.60
 
 General.
 
 The material shall be removed by dredging plant and equipment either by the Hydraulic Method or by placing
 the material in scows and disposing of it outside of the dredging areas. The method(s) to be used will be specified in the
 Special Provisions.
 If no area for the disposal of material is stated in the Special Provisions, it shall be the Contractor’s responsibility
 for the negotiations necessary to furnish all required areas for disposal of materials.
 In the dredging and disposal of dredged material, the Contractor will be required to observe all laws of the
 United States, all requirements of the U.S. Corps of Engineers and all local or state authorities in relation thereto. The
 Contractor’s attention is directed to the fact that material disposal of below mean high water requires a permit from the
 U.S. Corps of Engineers and a license from the Commonwealth.
 The areas shown on the plans, or as laid out in the field, shall be dredged so that they shall have throughout upon
 completion of the work the specified depths over their whole extent as shown on the plans, with the banks at the sides
 sloped at an angle of approximately 1 vertical to 3 horizontal, unless otherwise shown on the plan. The Contractor shall
 make the bottom of the dredged areas as smooth and level as possible to or slightly below the required depths.
 The Contractor shall exercise extreme caution in any location in which the dredging operations are in close
 proximity to structures. The Contractor shall bear full responsibility for damage of any nature to structures caused by
 dredging beyond the limits shown on the plan or as laid out in the field and such damage shall be satisfactorily remedied at
 the sole expense of the Contractor.
 The Contractor shall conduct his/her dredging and disposal operations so as to cause a minimum of interference
 with navigation.
 The Contractor shall furnish regularly to inspectors on board the dredge or other craft upon which they are
 employed, when transportation ashore is impracticable, a suitable room for office and sleeping purposes. The room shall
 be properly heated, ventilated and lighted and shall have a desk which can be locked, a comfortable bed and chair for each
 Inspector, and washing conveniences. If such quarters and conveniences are not provided, or the work is so located that
 transportation ashore can be furnished without interference with the work, the Contractor shall provide the Inspector with
 transportation to and from such points ashore as the Engineer may from time to time designate.
 If the Contractor maintains on his/her work an establishment for the subsistence of his/her own employees, he/she
 shall furnish to Inspectors and survey parties when employed on the work, meals of satisfactory quality.
 
 II.24
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department

 Each Bidder shall state in his/her Proposal whether the plant proposed to be used on the work has facilities for
 furnishing the meals and accommodations required.
 The entire cost to the Contractor for furnishing, equipping and maintaining the foregoing accommodations,
 providing transportation ashore, and furnishing meals, shall be included in the price bid for dredging.
 COMPENSATION
 148.80
 
 Method of Measurement.
 
 The amount of material dredged and disposed of will be determined by preliminary and final cross sections taken
 by the Engineer in the dredging area. If this method is impracticable, the Engineer will determine the method of
 measurement.
 If the alternate method of measurement is by measuring the dredging materials in the scows in which it is placed
 for disposal, such actual scow quantities as determined by the measurements shall be divided by 1.15 to compensate for
 bulking or swelling. The quotient for this division shall then be the quantity to be paid for.
 The quantity of materials shown in the Proposal has been computed to the payment limits.
 The Engineer may take additional soundings before the work is started, which soundings shall be the preliminary
 soundings for payment purposes.
 Pay limits for material actually dredged and disposed will be as follows:
 A. Bottom – Depth up to and including 8 meters below mean low water plus 300 millimeters below the
 required depths. Depths more than 8 meters below mean low water plus 600 millimeters below the required
 depths.
 B. Side slopes shall be as shown on the plans.
 Rocks. Removed from Dredged areas and Disposed will be determined by measurement made by the Engineer.
 Ledge. Removed from Dredged Areas and Disposed will be determined by preliminary and final cross sections
 taken by the Engineer in the dredging area. The overlying material shall be removed prior to the Engineer taking
 preliminary cross sections. If this method of measurement is impracticable, the Engineer will determine the method of
 measurement.
 Mobilization and Demobilization will be paid for at the contract lump sum price. The Contractor will be paid
 sixty percent of the lump sum price upon completion of his/her mobilization at the work site. The remaining forty percent
 will be included in the final payment for work under the Contract.

 DESCRIPTION
 150.20
 
 General.
 
 Construction of all embankment fill shall be done in accordance with the relevant provisions of Sections 120,
 150 and 170 and in accordance with the procedures described herein.
 This work comprises the formation of embankments with suitable material obtained from excavation and borrow,
 thoroughly compacted to produce a stabilized embankment. The work shall be performed in accordance with the lines and
 grades shown on the plans as directed.
 Material available from widened cuts outside the slopes as indicated on the plans or as ordered by the Engineer
 may be used in embankments or elsewhere upon written request by the Contractor and subsequent written approval by the
 Engineer. The Engineer shall determine the suitability of any excavation material for incorporation in the embankment.
 If the Contractor desires to waste excavated material and provide borrow to replace it for his/her own
 convenience, he/she may do so only after obtaining the written approval of the Engineer and after satisfactory
 arrangements have been made for the measurements and disposal of the material.
 When it is determined by the Engineer that there is not sufficient material available either from excavation within
 the Right-of-Way or the slope lines of the section under Contract for the formation of embankments, roadbeds in cut
 sections, foundations, shoulders, or backfill the Contractor shall obtain such additional material as may be necessary from
 outside the location, and this material will be borrow material.
 150.21
 
 Borrow Pit Restrictions.
 
 With the exception of commercial borrow pits, the location, material removal operation and final shaping and
 finishing of borrow pits, regardless of location, must conform with all local and State regulations, and for the purpose of
 preventing water pollution shall be subject to approval by the Engineer prior to use, during the material removal operation
 and upon completion. Borrow pits shall be so graded and finished after material removal is completed that there can be no
 reasonable possibility of a safety hazard nor ponding of water nor water pollution caused by later erosion of the pit.
 Borrow pits located adjacent to the Right-of-Way shall be finished by extending the slope of the cross section to
 a berm to be constructed or left within the Right-of-Way at the side line. The berm shall be a minimum of 1.5 meters high
 and 600 millimeters wide across the top with natural slopes in both directions, or as otherwise directed. The floor of the
 pit shall slope away from the location line at a minimum rate of 5% for at least 15 meters.
 Portions of borrow pits (within 150 meters of the project or any other highway location line) which may be
 noticeable from a traveled way, residence or place of business, shall be neatly trimmed and left in a condition satisfactory
 to the Engineer. Particular attention shall be given to make the slopes harmonize with the general appearance of the
 adjacent landscape, provided however, that no slope shall be steep enough to constitute a public menace. No unsightly
 accumulation of material shall be permitted which may in any manner deface the finished landscape.
 The cost for the final shaping and finishing of borrow pits shall be included in the contract unit price of the type
 of borrow furnished with no additional compensation.
 MATERIALS
 150.40
 
 General.
 
 All embankment materials, whether coming from excavation or borrow shall consist of solid, sound mineral
 aggregate. It shall be free from deleterious, organic, elastic or foreign matter and shall be adequately graded for
 satisfactory compaction into a stabilized soil structure.
 These materials will be classified into particular groups according to AASHTO M 145, “The Classification of
 Soils and Soil Aggregate Mixtures for Highway Construction Purposes”.
 All borrow material to be furnished shall meet the requirements specified in the following Subsections of

 CONSTRUCTION METHODS
 150.60
 
 General.
 
 Prior to starting work, the Contractor shall obtain approval for the compaction equipment to be used. Unless
 otherwise required in the Special Provisions, each layer of embankment material shall be thoroughly compacted with
 power rollers or tamping rollers. Other equipment or equivalent compactive capacity may be used subject to trial on the
 project and approval by the Engineer. Compacting equipment will not be used for any other purpose during compaction
 operations.
 The use of tractors, trucks, scrapers or other equipment designed primarily for purposes other than compaction
 and being used for purposes other than solely compaction will not be considered as compaction equipment, but traffic of
 such vehicles shall be distributed over this fill in such a manner as to take advantage of the additional compaction afforded
 thereby.
 Sufficient leveling and compacting equipment shall be provided to do the work of spreading and compacting the
 material promptly after it has been deposited. When, in the Engineer’s judgment, such equipment is inadequate to spread
 and compact the material properly, the Contractor shall reduce the rate of excavation and placing of the fill to a rate not to
 exceed the capacity of the leveling and compacting equipment or employ additional equipment.
 The Contractor shall plan his/her grading operation to use all rock possible from all excavation either as backfill
 in excavated muck areas or in areas of greatest depth.
 Before placing of any fill, the areas under embankments shall be cleared, grubbed, and stripped as specified in
 Section 101 and 120.
 Frozen material shall not be placed on embankments nor shall embankments be placed on material frozen to a
 depth of over 75 millimeters. If during the construction of an embankment, the top layer becomes frozen to a depth of
 over 75 millimeters, the frozen material shall be removed before a succeeding layer is placed on the embankment. This
 work shall be performed at no additional expense to the Department.
 Frozen excavated material, if suitable when dry, shall be allowed to thaw and dry and then be placed in the
 embankment. No compensation will be allowed for the storing and rehandling of these materials.
 Embankments shall be formed by placing successive layers of material uniformly distributed and compacted over
 the full width of the cross section unless otherwise directed. Stumps, rubbish, sod, frozen or other unsuitable materials
 shall not be incorporated in the embankment.
 The Contractor shall prosecute his/her work so that no damage will occur to drainage pipe lines or masonry or
 brick structures (See Subsection 150.64).
 150.61
 
 Preparation of Foundation Areas.
 
 The foundation areas shall be cleared, grubbed and stripped as required, and all soft, spongy or other material
 unsuitable for embankment foundation shall be removed. When, in the Engineer’s judgment, there is reasonable doubt as
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.27
 
 to the suitability of the existing material for embankment foundation, no further work shall be performed in the area in
 question until the material is tested and approved for use or remedial methods are ordered by the Engineer.
 Embankment areas 1 meter or less in height from the subgrade to the existing ground shall be rough graded and
 compacted to not less than 95 percent of the maximum dry density of the material as determined by the AASHTO
 Standard Method of Test T 99, Method C at optimum moisture content, as determined by the Engineer, without additional
 compensation before placing any fill. If the material retained on the
 4.75 millimeter sieve is 50% or more of the total sample this test shall not apply and the material shall be compacted to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer.
 For embankments greater in height than 1 meter below the proposed subgrade to existing ground no additional
 embankment foundation area preparation will be required, provided the material within the area is suitable for the purpose.
 Regardless of the height of fill, where embankment is to be placed against existing earth slopes steeper than 1
 vertical to 3 horizontal, the slope shall be broken up into steps of random width as the fill is placed in order to provide a
 suitable bond between the existing ground and the new embankment. Both the material cut out and the bottom of the area
 cut into shall be compacted along with and to the same degree as the material being placed in the embankment without
 additional compensation for excavation, benching or compacting.
 Where foundations for bridges, culverts (span 2.44 meters or more) and major wall structures are to be founded
 on the embankment, the embankment to the extent shown on the plans shall be constructed of Gravel Borrow for Bridge
 Foundations and/or Crushed Stone for Bridge Foundations.
 At the sites of footings for abutments, piers or other structures having pile foundations, the material shall be
 placed in embankment prior to driving piles and shall be of a quality and grading that will not obstruct driving of the piles.
 Where foundations for structures are to be supported on newly formed embankments and where flying wingwalls
 are to be constructed, the embankment shall be placed to an elevation of at least 600 millimeters above the bottom of the
 proposed foundation or flying wingwalls and thoroughly and satisfactorily compacted.
 After the above work is completed the material within the area of the proposed foundation or flying wingwalls
 will be excavated to the grade of the bottom of the concrete. Excavation of this compacted fill will be paid for under the
 item of Bridge Excavation as stipulated in Subsection 140.21.
 150.62
 
 Embankment Construction With Materials Other Than Rock.
 
 Embankment construction with materials other than rock shall not be placed from December 1 to
 April 1, except with written permission of and under such special conditions and restrictions as may be imposed by the
 Engineer.
 Embankment 3 meters or more in height from the elevation of the subgrade to the original ground elevation shall
 be constructed to the elevation of the proposed subgrade and then allowed to settle for 60 days (or such other period as the
 Engineer shall direct in writing) before the pavement structure is constructed thereon. If the condition of the subgrade is
 suitable, not frozen or muddy and is shaped, compacted and fine graded within the tolerance provided in the Specification,
 the Contractor may apply and the Engineer may approve the placing but not the fine grading of the subbase prior to the
 termination of the 60 day waiting period.
 Earth embankment shall be placed and compacted in uniform layers not exceeding 300 millimeters in depth,
 loose measurement; each layer of material shall be spread on the entire width of the embankment and leveled off by
 approved equipment.
 The embankment materials shall be compacted to not less than 95 percent of the maximum dry density of the
 embankment material as determined by AASHTO Standard Method of Test T 99, Method C at optimum moisture content.
 If the material retained on the 4.75 millimeter sieve is 50 percent or more of the total sample, this test shall not apply and
 the material shall be compacted to the satisfaction of the Engineer. The Contractor shall, without additional
 compensation, employ whatever measures that may be necessary to adjust the natural water content of the suitable
 embankment material to permit the placement and compaction as hereinbefore specified. The Engineer, during the
 progress of the work, may make tests as required, determining the in-place density of the soil by one of the following
 Standard Methods of Test: Density of Soil and Soil Aggregate In-Place by Nuclear Methods (Shallow Depth), AASHTO
 T 238; Density of Soil In-Place by the Sand-Cone Method, AASHTO T 191; or Density of Soil In-Place by the RubberBalloon Method, T 205.
 
 II.28
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 Each lift of compacted materials shall be visibly crowned to allow drainage of surface and rain waters off the
 surface of the embankment. No stones larger than 75 millimeters shall be used to fill where piles are to be driven.
 Embankment constructed in basement areas of demolished buildings and other areas restricting the use of power rollers,
 etc., shall be compacted by mechanical tamping with approved power tools.
 If the natural-in-place moisture of the excavated material makes it impractical to compact the soil, the Contractor
 shall dry the soil by disking, harrowing, blading, rotary mixing or by other approved means, or compaction of the layer of
 wet material may be deferred until the layer has dried so that it can be properly compacted. If these above methods do no
 produce the desired results, or when in the judgment of the Engineer, excess moisture resulting from climactic conditions
 beyond the control of the Contractor is considered to have affected adversely the stability of the previously placed and
 satisfactorily compacted embankment materials, the Engineer may direct the placement of single layers of “Special
 Borrow” to act as stabilizing drainage layers. When so ordered by the Engineer, the Contractor shall place a layer of
 “Special Borrow” having a depth of not more than 300 millimeters in thickness, loose measure. Such materials shall be
 placed completely over the entire width between the limits designated by the Engineer, and shall be compacted as
 hereinafter specified before the succeeding layer of suitable embankment materials from the roadway excavation is placed.
 The work may be ordered suspended if the weather and climactic conditions are such that the embankment and
 excavation cannot be performed in accordance with the specifications. No additional compensation will be allowed to the
 Contractor for such suspension of work. If the work is ordered suspended due to weather or other climactic conditions not
 under the control of the Contractor, an extension of time may be granted to the Contractor by the Engineer.
 150.63
 
 Rock in Embankment.
 
 Where rock is used in embankments the materials shall be carefully spread so that all large stones shall be well
 distributed and the interstices of each layer shall be practically filled with smaller stones and suitable material from
 excavation or borrow to form a solid and dense layer of embankment. No rock in excess of
 150 millimeters in its largest dimension shall be incorporated in the top 600 millimeter layer of embankment immediately
 below the subgrade. The maximum size of boulders or ledge fragments used in embankments shall be such that they can
 be incorporated into layers not exceeding 1 meter in depth. Any stones or fragmented material too large to be placed in 1
 meter layers shall be broken down by blasting or other means to appropriate size.
 Rock in fills shall not be placed adjacent to masonry or brick structures or to any pipe lines. At bridge abutments
 rock fill shall not be placed within 6 meters of the backwall of the abutment.
 150.64
 
 Backfilling for Structures and Pipes.
 
 A. General.
 All backfilling shall consist of suitable materials uniformly distributed and thoroughly compacted. When
 suitable backfilling materials cannot be obtained from excavation, the material shall consist of satisfactory borrow.
 When directed, mechanical tampers shall be used in compacting backfill for trenches, and in hard to reach areas
 around masonry.
 No backfill whatever shall be placed on or against structures, pipes, or other masonry, until permitted by the
 Engineer. It shall be formed of successive layers not more than 150 millimeters in depth, uniformly distributed and each
 layer thoroughly compacted.
 B. Structures.
 The backfill in back of abutments and wingwalls of bridges shall consist of gravel. The gravel shall meet the
 specifications of Subsection M1.03.0, Type b. Measurement of “Gravel Borrow” under this work will not include any
 filling made beyond a vertical plane 300 millimeters outside the footings except as directed.
 Whenever backfill is placed in back of or over arches, culverts or rigid frames, the fill shall be first placed
 midway between the ends of the structure. The remainder of the fill shall then be placed to equal depths on both sides of
 the structure, working equally both ways from the center of the structure toward the ends. This procedure shall continue
 up to the bottom of the subbase of the roadway.
 C. Pipes.
 No load greater than 70 kilonewtons shall be moved over any pipe until a fully compacted backfill of at least 600
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.29
 
 millimeters has been placed over the top of the pipe. This minimum will be increased to 1 meter for a 180 kiloNewton
 single wheel load and to 1.2 meters for a 270 kilonewton single wheel load. The required fully compacted backfill cover
 shall be placed a minimum of 15 meters on both sides of the pipe crossing. However, compliance with this requirement is
 not to be construed as relieving the Contractor of any responsibility concerning damage to the pipe.
 Material used for backfilling to a point 600 millimeters over the pipe shall contain no stones larger than 75
 millimeters in greatest dimension.
 Backfill below the haunches shall be placed in 150 millimeter layers and compacted simultaneously on both sides
 of the pipe with railroad tampers or approved mechanical rammers which shall not come in contact with the pipe. Backfill
 above the haunches shall be placed in 150 millimeter layers and compacted as directed. Backfill material shall be moist
 prior to and during compaction.
 If directed, backfill material shall consist of gravel borrow, type c.
 Backfilling for structural plate pipe, pipe-arches and arches shall be placed evenly on both sides of the structure
 in layers not exceeding 150 millimeters in depth. Backfilling shall be placed uniformly on both sides of pipe. The fill
 material shall be thoroughly tamped around the pipe or pipe-arch, between the pipe or pipe-arch and the sides of the
 trench, or for a minimum distance each side of the pipe or pipe-arch equal to the diameter or span of the structure.
 In all cases the filling material shall be thoroughly tamped. Puddling or jetting the backfill will not be permitted,
 except with written approval of the Engineer.
 150.65
 
 Backfilling Muck Excavation Areas.
 
 Backfilling after muck is removed shall consist of rock fragments, boulders up to 1.5 cubic meters in size, if
 available, or selected clean granular material not more than 15% of which will pass through a
 75 micrometer sieve as determined by AASHTO Test T 11. The backfill shall be obtained from suitable excavation on
 the project, or from Special Borrow under Item 150.1. When rock is used as backfill, granular material meeting the
 specifications described above shall also be provided and used with the rock backfill. The volume of the granular material
 shall be sufficient to fill all voids and interstices of the rock backfill.
 Where directed, backfilling shall be placed immediately after the muck has been excavated in order that any
 remaining soft material may be pushed ahead of the backfill and readily removed.
 The backfill shall be placed at least 600 millimeters above the top of the swamp area or at least
 600 millimeters above the level of any water that is present whichever will give the highest elevation of backfill.
 The surface of the embankment shall be kept free of unsuitable material. No muck or unsuitable material shall be
 entrapped by any successive deposits of fill.
 150.66
 
 Gravel Borrow for Bridge Foundations.
 
 The gravel shall be placed on firm material free from standing water and thoroughly compacted in layers not
 exceeding 300 millimeters in depth, loose measurement, in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 150.62 to a
 minimum total depth of 600 millimeters, except the requirements of AASHTO T 180 shall apply.
 In areas where it is not practicable to compact the gravel for bridge foundations by rollers or other rolling moving
 equipment the compaction shall be accomplished by means of mechanical or pneumatic tampers and the density of the
 compacted gravel as tested in the field shall not be less than 95% of the laboratory maximum density as determined by
 AASHTO Test T 180 Method D. If the material retained on the
 4.75 millimeter sieve is 40% or more of the total sample this test shall not apply and the material shall be compacted to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer.
 Compaction of the gravel and any adjoining embankment material shall be done simultaneously so that the
 respective materials will be confined substantially to the indicated lines.
 150.67
 
 Crushed Stone for Bridge Foundation.
 Crushed stone shall be furnished and placed where shown on the plans and where directed by the Engineer.
 
 II.30
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 In no case shall crushed stone be placed on other than firm material.
 The crushed stone shall be placed to an elevation 300 millimeters above ground water level or lowered water
 level.
 The entire mass of crushed stone shall be compacted into place by overlapping coverage by pneumatic tired earth
 rollers having 4 wheels abreast and loaded, vibratory plate type compactors, vibratory rollers or by other means that shall
 achieve equivalent compaction and are approved by the Engineer.
 The compaction operation shall be continued until there is no moving stone directly ahead of the wheels of the
 moving machine.
 150.68
 
 Crushed Stone for Drainage, Revetment, and/or Water Works Foundations.
 
 When directed in writing by the Engineer to place crushed stone in the bottom of the excavation of revetment,
 drainage and water system installation to stabilize the foundation, the work will be performed under this item.
 The minimum total depth of crushed stone to be placed under this item of work shall be
 150 millimeters. No compaction will be required for depth up to 300 millimeters. For any depth over
 300 millimeters, the crushed stone shall be placed and compacted in layers not to exceed 150 millimeters. Compaction
 will be accomplished by means of mechanical or pneumatic tampers. Compaction effects shall continue until the stones
 are firmly interlocked and the surface is unyielding.

 150.80
 
 Method of Measurement.
 
 All borrow with the exception of sand borrow and crushed stone will be measured in place. When this method of
 measurement is impracticable and the Engineer, prior to the start of construction, so directs and the Contractor agrees in
 writing, borrow, with the exception of sand borrow and crushed stone, will be measured in its original position in the pit
 after stripping by the cross-section method.
 When ordinary borrow is paid for as measured in place, it shall be measured from existing or compacted old
 ground surface to the lines and grades applicable to embankment as shown on the plans or as directed.
 The volume of ordinary and special borrow when in place measure is necessary, shall be determined as follows:
 1. Measure the total volume of embankment in place;
 2. Add 12.5 percent of this quantity (for compaction);
 3. Deduct the total volume of all suitable materials available for embankments, including rock excavation;
 except that excavated under Section 140.60;
 4. Deduct an additional 25 percent of the volume of rock excavation.
 When not measured in its original position in the pit by the cross section method, gravel borrow used in subbase,
 gravel for base course, gravel for surfacing, gravel for bridge foundations and gravel for backfilling around structures and
 pipes, will be paid for as measured in place plus 15%.
 When not measured in its original position in the pit by cross section method gravel borrow used in slope
 stabilization and other miscellaneous uses will be paid as measured in place plus 12.5%.
 If material that is measured in place is taken from a cross sectioned pit, the amount of material to be deducted
 from the cross-section pit quantity shall be equal to the material measured in place plus any allowable percent added to the
 in place measurement.
 Sand borrow will be measured by the cubic meter by load measurement. The quantity shall be the volume of the
 load, as measured, divided by 1.15.
 If stone screenings are used the volume shall be obtained from its mass using 1600 kilograms as the mass of a
 cubic meter of stone screenings.
 Crushed stone complete in place will be measured by the metric ton.
 The weight slips shall be countersigned on delivery by the Engineer, and no weight slip not so countersigned
 shall be included for any payment under the Contract.

 BORINGS
 DESCRIPTION
 190.20
 
 General.
 
 This work shall consist of making soil-test borings, obtaining and preserving acceptable samples, preparing a
 report of the results obtained and delivery of the report and samples.
 The Engineer will establish the location and provide the ground surface elevation for each boring. No change in
 boring locations shall be made unless prior consent of the Engineer is obtained. The Contractor shall complete the borings
 to the specified highest bottom elevations or as directed. The actual location at which each boring is made shall be shown
 on the plans and the actual starting grade shown on the boring log.
 The Contractor shall confine his/her operation as closely as possible to each location where work is to be
 performed. The Contractor shall take precautions necessary to prevent damage to existing structures and conduits both
 above and below ground, and to lawns, walks and pavements.
 When the work at each borehole is completed, the hole shall be adequately blocked and solidly filled to a depth
 of at least 1.5 meters in a manner to preclude any possibility of injury to man or animal, or damage to property. Special
 Provisions for backfilling boreholes on railroad property may also be employed in accordance with railroad requirements.
 Boreholes within the limits of travel ways, shoulders, sidewalks and paved areas shall be backfilled
 and compacted with granular materials and brought to the grade of the adjacent surface with a minimum of
 150 millimeters of bituminous concrete or cement concrete, whichever is applicable.
 The Department reserves the right, at any time during the life of the Contract, to determine the order in which
 remaining borings are to be taken and reserves the right to eliminate borings from, or to add borings to those shown on
 the plans and the right to increase or decrease the depth of any and/or all borings.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for any claims resulting from damage to underground pipes, conduits, and
 structures. It is suggested that possible damage to such utilities can be minimized or eliminated by hand augering the first
 several meter of each borehole. The Contractor’s attention is called to Subsection 7.13 of the Standard Specifications
 regarding Protection and Restoration of Property.
 190.21
 
 Boring Samples and Reports.
 
 All Borings including Trial Borings, Auger Borings, Wellpoints and Test Pits shall require boring logs and/or
 records. Four copies of the typewritten boring report shall be submitted to the Research and Materials Engineer within ten
 (10) calendar days after completion of the work at each site. One (1) copy shall be on transparent paper (onion skin,
 vellum, etc.) from which satisfactory prints can be made. Abbreviations shall not be used on the final typewritten log.
 Boring samples, packaged, packed and labeled as required and described hereinafter under each type of boring
 and sample, shall be delivered at the time the boring report is submitted, transportation prepaid, to the Research and
 Materials Engineer, Massachusetts Highway Department, 400 D Street, South Boston, Massachusetts 02210-1953.
 In advance of shipment of boring samples, a letter of transmittal shall be sent to the Research and Materials
 Engineer, with a copy of the boring report and one copy of the Boring Record Cards as required in Subsection 190.61. A
 supply of Boring Record Cards for Department projects may be obtained upon request from the Research and Materials
 Engineer.
 Where Control Borings are specified on the plans or in the Special Provisions, a legible copy of the driller’s field
 
 II.34
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department

 log shall be forwarded to the Research and Materials Engineer or as directed in the Special Provisions the day after the
 Control Boring work at each site is completed.
 The original drillers field log (copy) will be submitted to the Research and Materials Engineer with the drillers
 field description unaltered. Should the Contractor’s office engineer or geologist after review find it necessary to change a
 description he/she shall do so on a separate copy of the field log, date, sign, and clip the copy to the original driller’s log.
 Copies of these logs shall be sent to the Research and Materials Engineer, District Highway Engineer and all others
 concerned. The field logs shall be sent to all concerned no later than one (1) day after the completion of each borehole.
 190.22
 
 Supervision.
 
 The work shall be performed under the supervision of the authorized representative of the Engineer. No
 subsurface exploratory work shall be done in the absence of the Inspector.
 The Contractor shall furnish the means and the men required to transport safely the Inspector to and from high
 ground and the position of borings located on water, in a swamp, or other surface conditions over which it is impossible or
 difficult to travel on foot.
 The Contractor shall notify the Research and Materials Engineer and the District Highway Engineer, who is
 supplying the inspector, not less than forty eight (48) hours in advance of when he/she intends to commence work at a
 particular job site or when he/she intends to increase or decrease the number of rigs on a project in order that the Engineer
 may have time to provide a proper number of inspectors for the project.
 190.23
 
 Driller Qualifications.
 
 The driller of each boring crew shall be responsible for determining changes in the soil. The driller shall be
 experienced in detecting variations in the soil by changes in the feel and sound of the hollow rod to which the bit is
 attached. The driller shall also be competent to classify the recovered soil samples in accordance with the Department’s
 Visual Identification of Soils Table (copies may be obtained from the Research and Materials Engineer).
 Before beginning on the Department’s work, the Contractor shall certify in writing to the Engineer, the name of
 each driller he/she proposes to use. The driller shall be qualified as acceptable to the Engineer by exhibiting satisfactory
 abilities using the methods defined herein.
 Once qualified a driller need not be requalified for subsequent projects, although approval must be obtained for
 his/her employment on each Contract. The Engineer reserves the right to determine the acceptability of the driller at any
 time during the prosecution of the work. The Contractor shall designate a field supervisor on each Project.
 DRILLING METHODS
 190.60
 
 General.
 
 A. Starting Boring
 Every boring shall start as a Drive Sample Boring, except Hollow Stem Auger, Auger, Undisturbed Sample
 Preparatory, and Vane Shear Test Preparatory Borings.
 Where the resistance to penetration with earth boring tools, as defined herein by “Practical Refusal” (Section F.),
 is encountered above the specified highest bottom elevation, the borehole nevertheless shall be made to said elevation.
 Should bedrock be encountered above the specified highest bottom elevation, the borehole shall be continued as a rock
 core boring for 3 meters unless otherwise directed.
 B. Casing
 Casing shall be of a size that will permit the specified soil sample or rock core to be obtained, or groundwater
 observation well to be installed, or to allow for telescoping and spinning of casing. All pieces of casing and wash-pipe
 shall be equal in length. Casing may be driven into the ground only so far as is necessary to keep the wall of the borehole
 in place and then open hole techniques may be employed. However if the Contractor so elects, casing may be used
 throughout the borehole as required. Casing for rock core borings shall be sealed on bedrock to prevent loose material
 from entering the hole and to prevent the loss of drilling fluid return, regardless of the type or types of material
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.35
 
 encountered. Except for the first piece, when starting each borehole, the bottom of the casing should not be advanced
 below the bottom of the borehole that has been made with a chopping or drilling bit without the approval of the Engineer.
 C. Making the Borehole
 Independent of whether casing or open hole techniques are employed, the borehole shall be started and made by
 loosening the soil with a bit attached to the lower end of a hollow rod and given a chopping motion with a clockwise twist
 at the bottom of each stroke. An auger, either hand or power driven, a well-drill or a rotary drill shall not be used for
 advancing the borehole in less than “Dense” or “Very Dense” or “Practical Refusal” soil. However when casing is used a
 rotary bit may be used to clean the casing. A sampler shall not be used instead of a chopping or drilling bit for making a
 borehole. To make a borehole through “Dense”, “Very Dense” or “Practical Refusal” soil, boulders, rockfill or other
 similar material the Contractor may employ whatever method he/she chooses, including roller bits, telescoping and
 spinning of a casing without endangering life and property or affecting the purpose for which the boring is being made.
 The Contractor shall not use a backhoe or other earth moving equipment without the express approval of the Engineer to
 start a boring. The soil thus loosened shall be borne to the surface in a liquid which is forced down through the hollow
 rod, out through the discharge ports in the bit, and up the annular space between the hollow rod and the wall of the
 borehole and/or casing. Except when preparing the borehole for special sampling, the discharge ports shall direct the flow
 downward. The returning liquid shall be discharged into a settling basin and shall be reused (recirculated) to form a native
 mud. Water alone, for transporting the loosened soil, shall not be used except at the very beginning of each borehole. If a
 contractor elects to use open hole techniques, an effective mud for the purpose of transporting out the loosened soil and
 for stabilizing the wall and bottom of the borehole may be manufactured by adding a fat clay or bentonite, or one of its
 derivatives, in sufficient amount, to the native mud. When making boreholes in very porous material, the Contractor may,
 with the prior consent of the Engineer, drive casing to seal the wall of the borehole. The volume of mud to be calculated
 at any time shall be no more than is necessary to transport the loosened soil, but in no event more than 40 liters per minute
 when making the borehole in 63.5 millimeter casing. No rig shall be removed from its position above the borehole nor
 shall the casing be pulled from the hole until the inspector has been shown a copy of the field log for that hole and has
 approved the removal of the rig and/or of the casing.
 D. Changes in Soil
 At each change in soil, as detected by the driller with intervals not to exceed those as stated under Item 190.61,
 the drilling operation shall cease and the borehole conditioned for sampling by slowing the pump, raising the bit off the
 bottom and circulating the liquid to remove from suspension large particles which might become settled solids and thus a
 part of the sample. The bit on the bottom end of the hollow rod shall then be replaced with a 34.9 millimeter inside
 diameter split-tube sampler which shall be entered into the undisturbed soil at the bottom of the borehole for the sample.
 E. Obstructions
 Should an obstruction be encountered in a drive sample boring, the Engineer may require the Contractor to make
 additional borings at locations to be determined by the Engineer to attempt to pass the obstruction and complete the
 boring. “Practical Refusal”, boulders, hard material or rock fill will not be considered an obstruction. Final determination
 when and if an obstruction is encountered shall be made by the Engineer. Borings terminating on obstructions shall be
 considered trial borings and paid as a drive sample boring.
 F. “Practical Refusal”
 The term “Practical Refusal” shall mean failure of the sampler to penetrate at least 300 millimeters, when driven
 120 blows using a 63.5 kilogram mass, free-falling 760 millimeters. In each case the Engineer by observation shall
 determine that a Practical Refusal actually has been encountered. A Practical Refusal will not be accepted as the
 termination of a borehole above the highest bottom elevation as specified on the plans or stated elsewhere.
 190.61
 
 Drive Sample Borings.
 
 Control Borings and Complementary Borings, when required for design and/or construction purposes, shall be
 started as drive sample borings and compensated for as hereinafter provided. Control Borings should be completed and
 boring reports on same submitted as specified under Subsection 190.21 before any Complementary Borings are started.
 All, some, or none of the Complementary Borings may be required, depending on analysis of the Control Boring Data.
 A sample shall be obtained at the beginning of each borehole and at each change in:
 a. soil
 
 II.36
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 b. consistency of a plastic stratum
 c. density of a granular stratum
 In addition to the above, samples shall be taken so that no sampling interval exceeds 1.5 meters in a continuous
 stratum. However the sampling procedure of obtaining a sample at each change as specified will take precedent.
 In addition to taking the samples as mentioned, a sample shall also be obtained at specific elevations for certain
 borings when shown on the boring plans. These samples from certain elevations shall be placed in as many 120 milliliter
 jars as necessary to accommodate the contents of the entire sample recovered from the split spoon sampler and all jars
 shall be properly labeled and preserved as specified in the Standard Specifications. If a sample is lost during the recovery
 then the borehole shall be sampled again to recover a suitable sample at the specific elevation (or as close to it as possible)
 as given on the plans for certain borings. An acceptable minimum size sample shall be at least 150 millimeters in length.
 This requirement shall not apply if bedrock is encountered above the specified elevation.
 A sampler of the size and type specified in Subsection 190.60D shall be driven to obtain the sample. Between
 each blow of the drive-weight, the sampler shall be turned clockwise at least one-quarter of a revolution to keep it free.
 In no event will washed, bucketed, or bobbed samples be accepted.
 Before sampling, the driller shall mark the drill rods in three successive 150 millimeter increments so that the
 advance of the sampler under the impact of the hammer can be easily observed for each 150 millimeter increment.
 During the sampling operation, the driller of the boring crew shall count and record the number of blows
 required to effect each 150 millimeter increment of penetration or fraction thereof for a distance of
 450 millimeters using a of 63.5 kilogram mass free-falling 760 millimeters.
 The number of blows required to effect each 150 millimeters of penetration or fraction thereof for a distance of
 450 millimeters shall be recorded on the field log and final log.
 The first 150 millimeters shall be considered to be the seating drive. The summation of the number of blows for
 the second and third 150 millimeter increments of penetration shall be the penetration resistance (N).
 The blow counts shall be shown on the final boring log as recorded in 150 millimeter increments or fraction
 thereof, if the sampler fails to penetrate the 150 millimeters, with the corresponding sample depth.
 The borehole shall be kept completely full of drilling liquid during the sampling and recovery operation.
 Each sample, immediately upon its recovery, shall be placed (not jammed) in a 120 milliliter glass jar. Sample
 jars shall be of the same diameter for their full length and shall have screw tops fitted with gaskets. Samples of cohesive
 soils shall be struck even with the top of the jar. Jars containing samples shall be stored in a cool, damp place, free from
 exposure to frost or excessive heat. Each jar shall be properly labeled and its lid marked to identify its contained sample.
 The labeling shall be typewritten and the label glued to the side of the jar.
 These labels shall show the following information in a neat, legible manner:
 Name and address of boring contractor.
 Date the boring was made.
 Location and name of project.
 Number of each boring as shown on the boring plans and log.
 Number of the sample as shown on the boring log.
 Depth at which the sample was obtained.
 Number of blows required to drive the sampler 300 millimeters, using a 63.5 kilogram mass freefalling 760
 millimeters.
 Brief description of the classification of the material composing the sample.
 All jars shall be packed one tier in clean, unused, substantial, partitioned paperboard cartons. Each carton shall
 contain exactly 24 jars. If the number of jars containing soil samples is less than 24, the remaining spaces in the carton
 shall be filled with empty jars.
 In each carton the jars shall be arranged in successive order as the samples were obtained from each borehole,
 starting in the upper left hand corner, which shall be clearly identified with a felt tip marker on the outside, then moving
 from the top to the bottom of each succeeding row until all compartments have been filled. Jars left over to complete a
 borehole shall be similarly arranged, starting in the next numbered carton. Cartons shall be numbered successively on
 both ends with a felt tip marker. On both ends of each carton shall be glued a typewritten paper label, containing in the
 same format the information required on the boring Record Cards, which fully describes its contents.

 II.37
 
 Each driller shall sign only the notes for the borings he/she has made. These notes shall be preserved by the
 Contractor for future reference. The Inspector shall sign the field copy of the notes also.
 At the completion of the boring work, the Contractor shall prepare a boring report containing a graphic
 representation (or log) of the results obtained. The log for each boring shall be a continuous vertical column, without
 discontinuity or offset and plotted to not less than a 1:100 scale. The logs for all borings for each structure or construction
 unit shall be plotted to the same scale, on a type of transparent paper such as onion skin, size A4, and contain one log per
 sheet.
 The boring report shall contain the following minimum information and be typewritten:
 (1) Date, location and name of project.
 (2) Boring number or other designation.
 (3) Survey station and offset.
 (4) Starting grade of each boring (to be supplied by the Engineer).
 (5) Depth and a brief, proper classification by visual and manual inspection of each type of material including
 rock successively encountered in each borehole. Granular soils shall be classified by apparent grain size and state of
 denseness; clay soils by color and state of consistency, either as hard, medium or soft, and silts as organic or inorganic all
 in accordance with the Department’s Visual Identification of Soils Table. Abbreviations shall not be used on the final
 typewritten log.
 (6) The resistance offered to penetration of the sampler, when sampling each stratum of soil, as represented by
 the number of blows required to drive the specified sampler 300 millimeters, or the designated fraction or multiple thereof,
 with a 63.5 kilogram mass free falling 760 millimeters.
 (7) Special Note “CHANGED LOCATION” shall be made on each boring log to indicate any field change
 from survey layout, and an explanation of the reason for the change.
 (8) Distance below starting grade to the surface of water in the borehole at its completion and at other times
 (if any) as required in the Special Provisions, and any unusual behavior of ground-water observed during the boring
 operation.
 (9) Every unusual condition noted during the entire operation. When boulders or cobbles are encountered the
 driller shall note this on the log and how the boring was made through the boulders or cobbles.
 (10) Below each boring log shall be noted the hour and date of start and completion, the actual hours worked to
 complete the borehole and the name of the driller and inspector.
 190.62
 
 Hollow Stem Auger Borings.
 
 This type of Boring, when specified by the Engineer will be made in accordance with the specifications and the
 special provisions of the Contract. When Hollow Stem Augers are used the type samplers specified under Section
 190.60D shall be used. A center rod, plug, and pilot bit will be in place unless otherwise directed while advancing the
 hole by rotation but to a depth no greater than the sampling interval. The center rod, plug, and pilot bit shall be removed
 and the sample obtained by driving the sampler
 450 millimeters into the undisturbed material below the bottom of the auger. When sampling below the water table, the
 Hollow Stem Auger shall be kept full of water or drilling fluid unless otherwise directed. The auger flights shall be 1.5
 meters in length and the maximum sampling interval shall not be greater than 1.5 meters.
 However, the sampling procedure of obtaining a sample at each change shall take precedent as specified in
 Section 190.61. If the hollow stem auger encounters cobbles, boulders or similar material and fails to penetrate the
 material after an attempt has been made, then the Engineer may direct the contractor to make the boring by other methods
 such as a drive sample boring. However, the Engineer will decide when and if this procedure will be employed. Logs,
 samples and other pertinent information will be as specified in Section 190 contained herein.
 190.63
 
 Core Borings.
 
 This type of boring is made after the casing has been sealed on bedrock to prevent loose material from entering
 the hole and to prevent the loss of drilling fluid return, regardless of the type or types of material encountered. Core
 Borings into bedrock shall be accomplished by the diamond bit, rotary drilling method. The minimum distance of coring
 
 II.38
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 into bedrock shall be 3 meters. The minimum diameter of acceptable core shall be 34.9 millimeters. Where rock cores
 are required, the coring shall be done with a Double Tube Core Barrel in runs of 1.5 meters or less.
 Every effort and precaution shall be made by the Contractor to insure the best possible recovery and preservation
 of the rock cores.
 Should the recovered length of core be less than 75% of the depth cored, the Contractor shall adopt measures as
 may be necessary to improve the percentage of recovery.
 Measures to improve recovery may include changes in:
 (1) Type of diamond bit.
 (2) Rate of feed.
 (3) Speed of rotation.
 (4) Volume of cooling water.
 (5) Style of core barrel.
 (6) Depth of coring for each removal of core.
 (7) Machine operator.
 (8) Type of machine.
 All recovered cores, including fragments, shall be carefully handled to avoid breakage. They shall be placed in
 wooden boxes furnished by the Contractor. Boxes shall be in accordance with details furnished by the Department.
 Cores shall be placed in the box in consecutive order as they are removed from the core barrel. The trough
 containing each core shall be fully identified and marked to show the top and bottom of the core.
 Upon completion of each core boring all information obtained, including a brief description of the rock type,
 length or run, length recovered, percentage recovered, coring time, type of barrel used, etc., shall be added to the log of
 the corresponding boring. The boxed cores and completed logs shall be delivered to the Research & Materials Engineer,
 as required under Subsection 190.21. All lengths and percentages recovered shall be verified by the Inspector.
 190.64
 
 Thin-Wall Steel Tube Drive Samples.
 
 Where organic and inorganic clay or other soils are encountered while making a borehole, the Engineer may
 require the Contractor to obtain thin-wall steel tube drive samples. The tube shall not be less than
 50.8 millimeters in diameter nor less than 450 millimeters long and need not be sharpened. The diameter of the thin-wall
 tube shall be specified in the special provisions. Making the borehole shall follow the procedure outlined under
 Subsection 190.60C. The steel tube shall be driven its full length into the material to be sampled. The loaded steel tube
 shall be sealed, marked for identification and handled in the manner described under Subsection 190.66.
 190.65
 
 Undisturbed Sample Preparatory Borings.
 
 The results of Drive Sample borings will determine whether Undisturbed Samples are required and the elevations
 at which they can be obtained.
 The applicable parts of Subsection 190.60C shall be followed in making this type of boring. The volume of mud
 circulated shall be increased just enough to transport the loosened soil from the borehole. The last 600 millimeters of
 borehole above the elevation at which an undisturbed sample is to be obtained shall be made with a bit built to deflect the
 flow of mud from a downward direction. Final preparation of the borehole to the top of each undisturbed sample shall be
 accomplished with a properly constructed and operated clean-out auger. The borehole shall be free of soil particles, soil
 shavings and settled solids to the surface of undisturbed soil and shall be full of mud to the overflow nipple at the top of
 the casing.
 (1) Drilling Procedure.
 “Open hole” techniques may be allowed for advancement of the borehole. When casing is used the diameter
 shall be at least 25.4 millimeters larger than the diameter of the undisturbed sample called for.
 Independent of the hole advancement technique (casing or open hole) selected, heavyweight drilling fluid with a
 unit mass between 1200 and 1500 kilograms per cubic meter will be required. The unit mass employed will be selected by
 the Engineer or his/her representative in the field, based on hole depth and soil characteristics. The purpose of the drilling
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.39
 
 fluid is to maintain hole stability and minimize sample disturbance.
 (2) Drilling Fluid.
 Drilling Fluid shall be produced using clean water and bentonite or one of its derivatives. The drilling fluid shall
 be mixed to a uniform consistency acceptable to the Engineer. A drilling fluid net mass of 1200 to 1500 kilograms per
 cubic meter (as determined by the Engineer) shall be obtained and thereafter maintained during execution of the borings,
 from which undisturbed samples are obtained. The boreholes shall be filled with drilling fluid; the fluid level shall be
 maintained above the ground or water surface at all times until the last sample is taken from the drill hole.
 (3) Drill Rods
 Drill rods provided for drilling, washing, and sampling within the borehole shall be of such a size that sufficient
 fluid flow (as determined by the Engineer) can be delivered to the bottom of the hole to permit complete flushing of soil
 when drilling at maximum depth. Drill rod fittings shall be provided to permit attachment of the drill rods to the thin wall
 tube sampler.
 (4) Pump
 The Contractor shall furnish a suitable pump capable of pumping and recirculating the weighted drilling fluid use
 for the depth and diameter of boring required.
 The use of casing for Undisturbed Sample Preparatory Boring shall follow the procedure outlined under
 Subsection 190.60B. The casing shall have a nominal diameter at least 25.4 millimeters larger than that of the undisturbed
 sample called for in the Special Provisions. Drive Samples shall be obtained as directed by the Engineer.
 Immediately after recovery of an undisturbed sample, as described in Subsection 190.66 the Inspector will
 examine the ends of the tube for adequacy and condition of the sample. If unacceptable, the borehole shall be re-prepared
 and additional samples taken until a satisfactory recovery is made.
 190.66
 
 Undisturbed Samples.
 
 Undisturbed samples shall be obtained with a stationary piston, thin-wall, steel tube sampler operated by a
 separate piston rod (actuating rod) and a sampler head with an appropriate spring and piston rod cone check. The
 diameter of the undisturbed samples shall be as specified in the Special Provisions. The sampler must be kept in perfect
 mechanical condition and operated at all times in a manner that will produce acceptable undisturbed samples.
 The Osterberg method for obtaining an undisturbed sample may be substituted for the stationary piston method,
 if approved by the Engineer.
 The seamless steel tube shall have a wall thickness not greater than 1.65 millimeters. It shall be of a proper
 length to produce a net sample 600 millimeters long. Its bottom edge shall be drawn and reamed knife-sharp to an internal
 diameter approximately 1.75% less than the inside diameter of the tube. The tube shall be free of all scale or other
 deleterious material and may have a coat of thin enamel paint, lacquer, teflon, or other similar material. Just before being
 lowered to sample, the inside of the tube shall be wiped dry. Tubes with rusted surfaces shall not be used.
 After being fully assembled and lowered to sampling position, the sampler shall be entered into the undisturbed
 soil by a rapid, continuous movement, without rotation.
 A rest period of not less than 15 minutes shall be allowed for the sample to develop friction on the inside of the
 tube. The loaded tube shall then be rotated by turning the top of the drill-rod. A direct, slow and steady pull,
 accompanied by rotation, shall remove the loaded tube from the soil. Raising the tube to the surface shall be done without
 quick starts, sudden stops or vibrations. The borehole is to be kept full of mud during the entire recovery operation.
 To free the loaded tube from the sampler-head, without damaging the sample, the vacuum breaker shall be
 opened. Immediately after the tube is freed, its end shall be inspected and if found satisfactory shall be sealed against loss
 of moisture.
 The top and bottom of the tube shall be sealed with molten beeswax or a microcrystalline petroleum wax heated
 to a temperature not higher than its melting point. The total thickness of seal shall be approximately
 20 millimeters. Any space remaining at either end shall be filled to within 20 millimeters of the end of the tube with
 firmly pressed damp sand. Sealing wax shall then be poured flush with the end of the tube, which shall be covered with
 several layers of electrician’s tape.
 A paper label, on which is recorded in ink all pertinent information as required in Subsection 190.61 relating to
 the contained sample, shall be glued to the tube. The same data shall be printed directly on the tube with a felt-tip marker
 
 II.40
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 of a contrasting color.
 The loaded tubes shall be packed in well built wooden boxes at the sampling site. Each box shall contain not
 more than one 127 millimeter nor more than two 76.2 millimeter or four 50.8 millimeter tubes. Each tube shall be
 surrounded by at least 50 millimeters of resilient packing. A record of its contents shall be marked on the lid of each box
 with a felt-tip marker. The boxes shall be delivered at the completion of each borehole as directed in writing by the
 Engineer.
 An acceptable undisturbed sample for laboratory tests shall, when split in two longitudinally and partially dried,
 disclose no observable distortions in its stratifications and/or shear planes that can be reasonably attributed to the sampling
 and handling operations. The Engineer may direct the Contractor to alter the cutting edge clearance of the sampling tube.
 Where undisturbed samples are to be taken over water (tidal or otherwise), the Contractor shall have the
 necessary equipment to properly obtain an undisturbed sample on water and have the necessary devices to stabilize the
 barge or raft while making an undisturbed sample.
 190.67
 
 Vane Shear Test Preparatory Borings.
 
 The borehole shall be made under applicable parts of Subsection 190.60C and 190.65 to a point
 1.2 meters above the elevation at which a vane shear test is to be made. The next 600 millimeters of borehole shall be
 made with a bit built to deflect the flow of mud from a downward direction. By means of a clean-out auger built for the
 purpose, all soil and shavings shall be removed to an elevation 300 millimeters above the position of the top of the vane
 tool during the test. Drive samples shall be obtained as directed by the Engineer.
 190.68
 
 Vane Shear Test.
 
 The in-place shear strengths of cohesive soils shall be measured by means of field vane shear tests. The
 Contractor shall have the required vanes as specified in the contract.
 The penetrating edge of the vane blade shall be sharpened having an included angle of 90 degrees. A ball
 bearing casing guide shall be attached to the drill rods 600 millimeters above the vane and additional ball bearing casing
 guides shall be provided for each 6 meters of drill rods required thereafter. All drill rods shall be made up tightly. The
 vane shall be pushed into the soil below the bottom of the hole in a manner that will prevent rotation during insertion. The
 bottom of the vane shall be inserted 450 millimeters into the undisturbed soil at the bottom of the hole.
 After insertion, the drill rods shall be clamped securely to a thrust type ball bearing reacting against the casing,
 this bearing should support the entire weight of the vane and rods during test. A rotation of the vane shall be
 accomplished by means of a mechanical gear driven mechanism which shall produce a uniform rate of rotation of about 1
 degree every 10 seconds (6 degrees per minute). Accurately calibrated torque mechanism or proving rings with maximum
 readings of 65 newton-meters shall be provided to measure the applied torque. Acceptable equipment is the Acker
 Precision Drive, Barros, Geonor, Sprague & Henwood, or approved equal in good working condition. Torque wrenches
 will not be allowed. Calibration of Vane Shear Equipment by an acceptable organization capable and specializing in this
 work will be required. If said equipment has been calibrated and checked within the last six months by a recognized
 laboratory no additional calibration will be necessary. Certificate of Proof will be required.
 A friction check will be run prior to each test when directed by the Engineer.
 One man shall rotate the vane while the Engineer observes the torque gauge. Special attention shall be given to
 determine the maximum torque registered.
 Following the determination of the maximum torque the remolded shear strength shall be determined in the same
 manner after rapidly rotating the drill rods about 12 revolutions. The determination of the remolded strength should be
 started immediately after completion of the rapid rotation and in all cases within one minute after the remolded process.
 During the tests, readings of time, applied torque and angular rotation should be recorded at 15 sec. intervals
 unless otherwise directed until the maximum torque is achieved. The maximum torque in newton-meters, the time and
 angle of rotation measured from the start of the test to the development of maximum torque shall also be recorded. A
 complete description of the apparatus and detailed dimensions of the vane shear tool shall be submitted with the test
 report.
 Completion of the procedure described above including determination of the remolded shear strength shall
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.41
 
 constitute one (1) field vane shear test for payment purposes.
 If the Contractor is unable to push or drive the vane into the soil below the bottom of the hole after lowering the
 drill rods and vane to the required depth or if the Contractor is unable to rotate the vane to determine the maximum torque
 due to the stiffness of the soils or due to an obstruction, compensation will be considered included in the Unit Bid Price
 per meter for Vane Shear Test Preparatory Boring and no further compensation will be made.
 190.69

 General.
 
 The installation or removal and reinstallation of water systems or parts thereof shall conform to the following
 construction procedures:
 A. Pipe Fittings, etc.
 All pipe fittings, valves, hydrants and other heavy accessories shall be carefully handled by the use of hoists or
 skidways to avoid shock or damage. Pipe handled on skidways shall be not skidded or rolled against pipe already on the
 ground. The Contractor shall replace or repair, at his/her own expense, any materials that have been damaged due to
 his/her negligence.
 Where pipes are required in less than standard lengths, the cutting shall be done in a neat and workman-like
 manner without damage to the pipe.
 B. Excavation.
 See Subsection 140.60.
 C. Bedding Pipe.
 See Subsection 230.61.
 D. Bridging.
 Where required, the Contractor shall provide suitable bridges for traffic to cross open trenches at streets and
 driveways.
 E. Cleaning and Plugging Pipe.
 The pipes and fittings shall be thoroughly cleaned before being laid and shall be kept clean until accepted in the
 finished work. The ends of all uncompleted lines shall be tightly closed with temporary plugs at all times when the pipe
 laying is not in progress, and no trench water or debris shall be permitted to enter the pipe.
 F. Removal of Castings.
 In the work of removing hydrants and other castings to be reset, or stacked for the municipality, the castings
 shall be exposed, care being taken that they are not damaged by excavating or other machinery, the joints shall then be
 opened and the castings carefully removed.
 Any materials damaged during this work due to the Contractor's negligence shall be replaced by the Contractor
 at his/her own expense.
 G. Laying Pipe.
 Proper tools and equipment for the safe and convenient handling and laying of the pipes shall be used. The
 Contractor shall exercise reasonable caution during his/her operations in order to avoid damaging the pipes, castings, or
 fittings and any which are damaged shall be replaced by him/her at his/her own expense.
 The Contractor shall furnish the necessary pumps and tools to handle any water encountered in the pipe trench,
 and shall maintain the trench in a satisfactory condition, free from water, during the laying of the pipe. The pipe, after
 being laid in place, shall not under any circumstances be used as a drain pipe for the trench.
 Cast iron pipe sections shall be laid with the bell on the upgrade end, unless otherwise directed. Before laying
 the pipe, the outside of the spigot and the inside of the bell shall be wire brushed and wiped clean and dry. When
 placing a length of pipe, the yarning material for the joint shall be held around the bottom of the spigot so that it will
 enter the bell as the pipe is shoved into position.
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.61
 
 H. Setting Gates and Hydrants.
 Gates and gate boxes shall be set in the pipe lines as directed. Care shall be taken to see that the spigot ends
 are securely seated in the bell ends. Blocking or supports of a permanent nature shall be placed under each valve to
 insure against settlement. The blocking or permanent supports shall conform to Owner's Specifications. Each gate shall
 be tightly closed before being placed in the line and shall remain so until the joints on each side are completely made.
 Gate boxes shall be set for all gates. They shall be carefully fitted together and to the gate and securely held during
 backfilling. The earth around them shall be thoroughly tamped in place and the cover set to the finished grade.
 New gate and service boxes, and existing gate and service boxes that are designated to be removed and reset or
 adjusted to line or grade, which are located in roadway pavement areas shall have concrete collars constructed around
 them. The concrete collars shall conform to the details of design shown in the Department's Standards for Concrete
 Collars.
 Hydrants shall be properly supported and held plumb while the joints are being made and during backfilling.
 Crushed stone or screened gravel with a minimum volume of 0.03 cubic meters shall be placed to drain each hydrant
 drip. The hydrants shall be satisfactorily braced near the bottom of the stem.
 I. Yarning.
 The strands of yarn for cast iron bell-and-spigot joints shall be cut longer than the circumference of the pipe so
 that the ends will overlap a maximum of 50 millimeters.
 The yarning material shall be thoroughly packed into the bell leaving a depth of not less than
 60 millimeters for the sealing compound. Loose or frayed ends shall be left to protrude into the space left for the
 compound.
 J. Jointing.
 For cast iron bell-and-spigot joints the melting furnace shall be kept reasonably close to the point where the
 joints are being made. The joint material shall be melted in a pot, the top or flange of which will fit snugly into a
 furnace, so designed that heat from a low fire will completely surround the bottom of the melting pot.
 The melting pot, ladle and pouring pot shall be thoroughly cleaned before melting the joint material. No dirt or
 foreign material of any kind shall be allowed to enter the melting pot while in use.
 The joint material shall be brought to such temperature that when stirred it will show a rapid change of color
 and when poured into the joint space will insure a perfect joint. Before pouring, all scum shall be removed from the
 molten material.
 The joint space shall be free from all dirt, water, mud, oil, grease or other deleterious material before placing
 the joint runner.
 The joint runner, soaked in water and rubbed with clay to prevent adherence to the molten joint material shall
 be placed snugly against the face of the bell and the outside of the pipe. The joint runner and the pouring gate shall be
 clayed to prevent the material from breaking out.
 The molten material shall be poured slowly but continuously through the gate until the joint is completely filled
 to the top of the gate.
 After cooling, the filled joints shall be caulked with pneumatic tools, or hand tools, until thoroughly compacted
 to form watertight joints without overstraining the bells.
 K. Thrust Blocks and Pipe Anchors.
 Reaction or thrust blocks of concrete shall be constructed at all tees, plugs, and bends as directed or as detailed
 on the drawings with 20 MPa - 40 mm - 280 kg Cement Concrete Masonry. The blocks shall be poured against
 undisturbed original ground and shall be so placed that pipe joints will be accessible for any possible future repairs.
 Yokes and tie-rods shall be installed in addition to or in lieu of thrust blocks. Pipe anchors shall be used when and as
 directed.
 L. Testing.
 After completion, the trenches shall be partially backfilled leaving the joints exposed for examination, and the
 pipe line then subjected to a hydrostatic pressure of 50 percent above the normal operating pressure. The pipe shall be
 tested between points as designated by the Engineer by slowly filling the test section with water by means of a pump
 connected to the pipe but not before the pipe has been relieved of air through taps made where required. Any defects in
 the pipe or joints revealed by this pressure test shall be repaired or replaced and the pipe line again subjected to a
 hydrostatic pressure test as described above for possible leakage over the allowable limits. Pump, connections, gauges
 and a measuring device shall be furnished by the Contractor. The pressure test shall be maintained for at least 2 hours
 during which time all exposed joints, fittings, valves and hydrants will be carefully examined.

 II.68
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 Contractor from the responsibility of fulfilling the requirements of this specification.
 Any gradation deficiencies in the existing materials, as indicated by the test pits, shall be corrected by blending
 the appropriate aggregate size(s) into the mixture.
 CONSTRUCTION METHODS
 403.60
 
 General.
 
 Reclaiming operations shall not be permitted when the existing pavement or sub-base contains frost, when the
 sub-base is excessively wet as determined by the Engineer, nor when the air or surface temperature is below 5 °C.
 Reclaiming operations shall not commence before April 15 and shall terminate on or before October 15 unless
 otherwise approved in writing by the Engineer.
 Prior to the start of reclaiming operations, the Contractor shall locate and protect existing drainage and utility
 structures and underground pipes, culverts, conduits and other appurtenances.
 The limit of each sequence of the reclamation process shall be 1.6 kilometers full width or as directed by the
 Engineer in order that the placing of pavement structure, up to the binder course, will be completed before beginning the
 next sequence of roadway reclamation work.
 403.61
 
 Equipment.
 
 The recycling equipment shall have a positive depth control to insure a uniform depth of processing. This
 equipment shall have the ability to process the complete design depth specified into a homogeneous mass. It shall also be
 capable of crushing all oversize material encountered except ledge, or boulders larger than
 200 millimeters in diameter.
 A minimum of fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the proposed start of work, the Contractor shall submit in
 writing to the Engineer for approval, a description of the specific equipment and construction methods to be used in
 performing the work. The Contractor will be required to demonstrate, to the Engineer, the ability of the work crew and
 equipment to produce reclaimed material conforming to specifications at a rate of production consistent with the time
 allowed under the Contract. A test section shall be constructed approximately 150 meters long and one lane wide, and be
 located within the project limits at a location determined by the Engineer. The forward speed and processing direction
 (e.g., up cutting vs. down cutting) of the recycling equipment shall be recorded during construction of the test section.
 Representative samples of the reclaimed material shall be taken from this test section for analysis by the Engineer. Full
 scale production will not be allowed to commence until the Engineer has reviewed the test results and gives written
 approval of the equipment and construction methods used in the construction of the test strip.
 Failure to meet gradation requirements or an insufficient production rate may be considered cause for rejection of
 the equipment, the construction methods, or both. The Contractor must then submit, in writing, the proposed changes in
 equipment and/or construction methods and either construct another test section or reconstruct the original section, as
 determined by the Engineer. This procedure may be repeated until acceptable results are obtained, at no additional
 compensation.
 Otherwise, failure to meet gradation requirements due to improper equipment or construction methods shall not
 constitute a reason for any additional compensation for the import and blending of any aggregate to meet the deficiencies.
 Approval of equipment includes the speed and processing direction it was operated at during construction of the
 test section. Therefore, the same operating speed and processing direction must be maintained during normal production.
 Changes in the equipment’s operating speed and/or processing direction may only be made with the Engineer’s written
 approval.
 At least one vibratory roller shall be used on each reclaimed surface, and shall have a compacting width of not
 less than 1.5 meters. Each roller shall have a gross mass of not less than 14.6 metric tons.
 Approved equipment shall be maintained in satisfactory working condition at all times.
 403.62
 
 Structure Lowering and Raising.
 All work shall be done in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 220.
 All drainage, utility, and municipality structures are to be referenced and lowered to a minimum depth
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.69
 
 150 millimeters below the bottom of the proposed reclaimed base course. Lowered structures shall be covered with steel
 plates conforming to the requirements specified in Subsection 7.09. The voids remaining after the structures have been
 lowered are to be filled with a suitable material as determined by the Engineer. The Contractor will be responsible for the
 coordination with the respective utility companies for the lowering and raising of privately owned structures and gate
 boxes. The reclaiming operation shall not begin until all structures and boxes are lowered.
 It shall be the Contractor’s responsibility to maintain drainage functioning properly in the areas under
 construction up to the time when the final system is put into use. All structures lowered will be raised to the binder grade
 elevation upon placement of the binder course material for that section. Adjustment of the castings to final grade will not
 be allowed until the Engineer approves the placement of bituminous concrete top course material throughout the project.
 Any drainage structure found to be deteriorated below the plated depth shall be rebuilt from the bottom of the
 deterioration to the plated depth.
 403.63
 
 Reclaiming Operations.
 
 Prior to the start of reclamation, the existing pavement shall be swept with a power sweeper to remove all trash,
 sand, dirt, organic matter, and other undesirable material, to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 Also, the existing pavement shall be sawcut full depth within the areas where the adjacent surface is to be
 protected (curb, side streets, etc.) as shown on the plans and/or as directed by the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall reclaim only that area of pavement that can be processed and compacted by the end of the
 same working day, at which time it must be opened to traffic, with the Engineer’s approval. In any section, reclamation
 work shall be done on one-half the road width at a time. One-way traffic will be allowed only during working hours with
 traffic police present. Two-way traffic shall be maintained at all other times. Suitable ramping shall be in place at the
 beginning and end of work zone to allow for smooth and safe travel. This shall be considered incidental to the work for
 this item. The required density shall be maintained until the bituminous concrete pavement has been placed. Any
 imperfections discovered prior to its placement shall be repaired, as directed by the Engineer, at no additional
 compensation.
 The total thickness of the pavement structure, unless otherwise indicated, and uppermost portion of the sub-base
 layer shall be recycled to the design depth specified on the typical section(s). The Engineer shall perform a sieve analysis
 of the reclaimed material for every 4200 square meters of material processed or as often as conditions may require as
 determined by the Engineer. Test results shall be made available to the Contractor. If conditions warrant, the Engineer
 may stop work until the required test results become available. If the Engineer directs, due to gradation deficiencies in the
 existing materials as indicated by the test pits, the appropriate crushed stone aggregate size(s) shall be blended with the
 recycled material to produce a uniform mixture meeting the gradation requirements. Additionally, if the Engineer directs,
 dense graded crushed stone shall be added for volume purposes.
 Any required modifications to the remaining sub-base such as, but not limited to, cuts, fills, and grade
 realignment shall be made. Existing unsuitable material shall be removed to the lines and grades established by the
 Engineer and replaced with a suitable material, as determined by the Engineer. Existing surplus reclaimed material shall
 be used, when available, at no additional compensation.
 All unsuitable material and/or excess reclaimed material shall become the property of the Contractor to be
 properly disposed of outside the project limits.
 403.64
 
 Compaction and Dust Control.
 
 The reclaimed material shall be rolled, compacted and fine graded to the specified cross section(s) and/or grades
 as shown or as established by the Engineer.
 The reclaimed base course shall be tested for compaction and smoothness and accuracy of grade in accordance
 with the applicable provisions of Subsection 401.60. The required density shall be measured by a Nuclear Density Gauge
 supplied by the Department. If any portions are found to be unacceptable by the Engineer, such portions shall be
 reprocessed, regraded, and recompacted until the required smoothness and accuracy are obtained.
 At the end of each day’s progress, the Contractor shall apply Calcium Chloride in accordance with the applicable
 provisions of Section 440. Water for roadway dust control shall be applied as directed.
 A grader, roller and water wagon shall be maintained on the project site during the reclamation process. The
 Contractor shall submit to the Engineer, in writing, a twenty-four (24) hour availability telephone number for any

 Composition and Compaction Acceptance Tests.
 
 Where plant inspection is maintained, the material will be considered acceptable for use when the specified tests
 from samples obtained at the production plant indicate conformance to M3.11.09.
 The densities of the completed pavement shall not be less than 95% of the density obtained from Laboratory
 compaction of a mixture composed of the same materials in like proportions. Laboratory compaction will be performed
 by Department Standard Methods as outlined in M3.11.00.
 The bituminous mixture and the labor for obtaining these samples in the field shall be furnished without charge
 by the Contractor. The samples shall be taken in accordance with AASHTO T 230.

 General.
 
 The Engineer may require the Contractor to remove and replace at his/her own expense, any defective mix not
 conforming to the specified job mix formula within the stipulated tolerances on the basis of the Department testing.
 Samples of the actual mixture in use will be taken as many times daily as necessary and the mixture shall be maintained
 uniform for the project as specified herein. The Engineer may suspend further approval for use of the Plant mixtures in
 Department work if the mixtures are not uniformly furnished as specified until any necessary changes have been made so
 that the mixtures do conform to the specified requirements.
 If, at any time before the final acceptance of the work, any soft, imperfect places or spots shall develop in the
 surface all such places shall be removed and replaced with new materials and then compacted until the edges at which the
 new work connects with the old become invisible.
 Grade control survey shall conform to Subsection 5.07. The Contractor shall furnish, set, and maintain all line
 and grade stakes necessary to guide the automated grade control equipment. Where required these control stakes shall be
 maintained by the Contractor and used throughout the operations, from the grading of the sub-base material up to and
 including the final layers of the pavement.
 With prior approval of the Engineer and with no increase in cost, a plant may substitute a limited amount (up to
 1000 metric tons per project) of binder mix for black base. The substitution will be only within the station limits,
 locations, depths and tonnage as permitted by the Engineer.
 The Contractor will supply an approved dial type asphalt thermometer (range of 10 °C to 260 °C) for each
 paving machine in operation on the project. The thermometers will remain the property of the Contractor upon
 completion of the project.
 Under normal conditions, where more than one course of bituminous concrete is to be constructed, the use of the
 stringline for grade control may be eliminated or discontinued after the construction of the initial layer of bituminous
 concrete. For resurfacing projects, where only one course of bituminous concrete is to be constructed, the use of the
 stringline for grade control may be eliminated. The use of an approved “ski” may then be substituted for the stringline
 where lines and grades are found to be satisfactory by the Engineer.

 On each contract specifying 4000 metric tons of pavement or more, the Contractor shall submit for approval a
 schedule of proposed paving and compaction equipment. The schedule shall project approximate daily production for the
 “paving train” and provide sufficient data for proper evaluation of paving and compaction procedures.
 460.61
 
 Transportation and Delivery of Mixtures.
 
 The mixtures shall be transported from the plant to the work in vehicles previously cleaned of all foreign
 materials. During transportation of the mixture from the plant to the spreader on the work, each load shall be fully
 covered at all times, without exception, with canvas or other suitable material of sufficient size and thickness to furnish
 complete protection. The mixture shall not be transported such a distance that segregation of the ingredients takes place or
 that any crust if formed on the surface, bottom or sides of said mixture which will not crumble or flatten out when the
 mixture is dumped or shall otherwise be deleterious to the mixture in place on the roadway.
 The vehicles for transporting the mixture shall be tight and inside of the bodies shall be evenly and lightly coated
 with a suitable thin oil or approved soap solution, but no excess of lubricant shall be allowed to accumulate in low spots in
 the body.
 During paving operations, the Contractor shall provide continuous radio communication between the plant and
 the project to insure immediate response due to breakdowns, emergencies such as accidents, and to insure the best quality
 results possible.
 When necessary, proper insulation of the vehicles transporting the mixture shall be made to insure that the
 mixture is delivered for placing at the proper temperature.
 The dispatching of trucks from the plant shall be so arranged that all material which is to be delivered at or on the
 road surface during any day may be placed and shall have received final compaction before nightfall of the same day;
 unless artificial light, satisfactory to the Engineer is provided.
 The temperature of the mixture, within a tolerance of plus or minus 9 °C, when delivered at the project site will
 be governed by the temperature of the base upon which the mix is placed as follows:

 Tack Coat.
 
 When it is required that the existing hardened surface shall be utilized as a base for the new pavement, a tack
 coat of bituminous material of the kind and grade shown on the plans shall be uniformly applied by mechanical means
 to the present surface, at the rate of application of either 0.20 liters per square meter or that and by the method
 indicated on the plans or as directed by the Engineer, immediately prior to laying the bottom course of the new
 pavement.
 When and if the surface is in a condition which in the Engineer’s judgment is unsatisfactory for the direct
 placement of the surface course, it shall be sprayed as specified above with tack coat in the amount and by the method
 
 II.82
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 directed by the Engineer.
 When a tack coat is required and its need is found to be the direct fault of the Contractor the surface shall be
 treated with a tack coat as directed by the Engineer and the entire cost for such treatment shall be entirely borne by the
 Contractor.
 The existing surface shall be cleaned of all foreign matter and loose material and shall be dry before the tack
 coat is placed.
 460.63
 
 Spreading and Finishing.
 
 The equipment for spreading and finishing shall be mechanical, self powered pavers, capable of spreading
 and finishing the mixture true to line, grade, width, and crown by means of fully automated controls for both
 longitudinal and transverse slope.
 The pavers shall be equipped with hoppers and distributing screws of the reversing type to place the mixture
 evenly in front of adjustable screeds. They shall be equipped with a quick and efficient steering device and shall have
 reverse as well as forward traveling speeds.
 The pavers shall employ mechanical devices such as equalizing runners, straight edge runners, evener arms or
 other compensating devices to adjust the grade and confine the edges of the mixture to true lines. They shall be
 capable of spreading the mixture without segregation in layers to the depths and widths required. They shall be
 equipped with automatic joint matching attachment for use on adjacent mat or curb; automatic grade and slope control
 with a floating beam mobile reference system with minimum length of beam (“ski”) of
 9 meters for averaging longitudinal errors in the grade over which paving is being performed. The joint matching
 attachment and floating beam mobile reference system shall be employed on all paving courses unless otherwise
 directed by the Engineer.
 When extensions are added to the paver, they shall be provided with the same vibrating screed or tamper
 action as the main unit of the paver, except for paving variable width areas. The extensions shall also be equipped
 with a continuation of the automatically controlled spreading augers. The screed and any extensions shall be provided
 with an approved method of heat distribution.
 The screed shall be adjustable for profile and shall have an indicating level attached.
 An approved device will be required for heating the screed to the temperature required for the laying of the
 mixtures without pulling or marring.
 The term “screed” includes any “strike-off” device operated by cutting, crowding, or other practicable action,
 which is effective on the mixtures at permissible workable temperatures without tearing, shoving, or gouging and
 which produces a finished surface of the evenness and texture required.
 The pavers employed on projects requiring in excess of 10 000 metric tons shall be capable of operating by
 the use of a sensing grid for operation to a stringline and matching shoe for joints.
 The pavers shall operate while bituminous mixture is being spread at a speed which will produce a uniform
 surface texture free of any rippling or unevenness.
 The paver employed on deep lift construction shall be capable of satisfactorily feeding the mix without
 intermittent stopping during the discharge of the mix from the trucks into the paving machine.
 If during construction it is found that the spreading and finishing equipment in use leaves tracks or indented
 areas or produces other permanent blemishes in the pavement which are not satisfactorily corrected by the scheduled
 operations the use of such equipment shall be discontinued and other satisfactory spreading and finishing equipment
 shall be provided by the Contractor.
 The mixtures shall be placed and compacted only at such times as to permit the proper inspection and
 checking by the Engineer.
 The mixtures shall only be placed in the work when they can be efficiently and satisfactorily placed by the
 methods stipulated herein. Unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer for special particular conditions, only machine
 methods of placing shall be used.
 The construction of bituminous concrete pavement shall terminate November 15 and shall not be resumed
 prior to April 1 except as determined and directed in writing by the Engineer depending upon the necessity and
 emergency of attendant conditions, weather conditions, and location of the project.
 When the air temperature falls below 10 °C, extra precautions shall be taken in drying the aggregates,
 controlling the temperatures of the materials, placing, and compacting the mixtures.
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.83
 
 No mixture shall be placed unless the breakdown and intermediate rolling can be completed by the time the
 material has cooled to 75 °C, and provided that the density of the completed pavement attains at least 95% of the
 laboratory compacted density.
 The mixtures shall be placed only upon approved surfaces that are clean from foreign materials and dry and
 when weather conditions are suitable. The Engineer may however, at the entire responsibility of the Contractor, permit
 work to continue when overtaken by sudden rain, but only with material which may be in transit from the plant at the
 time, and then only when the temperature of the mixture is within the temperature limits specified and the existing
 surface on the roadway is not excessively wet.
 A tack coat shall be applied where required as per Subsection 460.62.
 The bituminous concrete shall be placed in courses as shown on the plans, as specified and as directed by the
 Engineer.
 When an existing surface or new base upon which the bottom course is to be placed contains unsatisfactory
 irregularities, in the Engineer’s judgment, such irregularities shall be eliminated by an adequate placing and
 compaction of mixture so as to furnish a surface with true contour and grade before placing any specified course of
 mixture.
 The contact surfaces of bridge curbings, manholes, catch basins or other appurtenant structures in pavement
 shall be painted thoroughly with a thin uniform coating of bitumen (Specification RS-1) just before any mixture is
 placed against them.
 Special attention shall be given to proper testing of the surface of each course with a straightedge. The
 finished surfaces shall be even and uniform throughout. (See Subsection 460.67 for “Testing Surfaces”)
 Any mixture which becomes loose or broken, mixed with dirt, or in any way defective shall be removed and
 replaced with new mixture which shall be compacted to conform with the surrounding area. Areas of 0.1 square meter
 or more showing an excess of bitumen shall be removed and replaced.
 The methods of spreading the bituminous concrete mixtures shall be as follows:
 A. Machine Spreading.
 All mixtures shall be deposited in an approved mechanical spreader and immediately spread thereby; and then
 struck off in a uniform layer to the full width required and of such depth that each course, when compacted, shall have
 the required thickness and shall conform to the grade and cross section contour specified.
 The mixture shall be deposited in the center of the hoppers and care exercised to avoid overloading and
 spilling. The pavers shall operate, while the mixture is being spread, at a speed which will produce a uniform surface
 texture.
 Immediately after any course is screeded and before roller compaction is started, the surface shall be checked,
 any irregularities adjusted, any accumulation from the screed removed by rake or lute, and all fat spots in any course
 removed and replaced with satisfactory material. Irregularities in alignment and grade along outside edges shall be
 corrected by the addition or removal of mixture before the edges are rolled. Indiscriminate casting of mix on the new
 screeded surface, where irregularities are not evident, shall not be permitted.
 All edges shall be true and uniform.
 B. Hand Spreading.
 Spreading by hand methods will be permitted only for particular locations in the work which because of
 irregularity, inaccessibility or other unavoidable obstacles do not allow mechanical spreading and finishing.
 460.64
 
 Compaction.
 
 After the paving mixture has been properly spread, initial compaction shall be obtained by the use of power
 rollers of approved design and mass per millimeter width of roller. The rollers shall be steel wheeled supplemented
 with pneumatic-tired rollers where required, or where permitted by the specifications, vibratory rollers.
 Steel wheel rollers for initial and intermediate rolling shall have a mass of not less than 4.3 kilograms per
 millimeter width of tread.
 Pneumatic-tired rollers, when conditions warrant, shall be provided with devices capable of varying tire
 pressures. When the mixture being spread by each paver requires more than the minimum number of steel wheel
 rollers, at least one (1) of the additional rollers for each paver shall be a pneumatic-tired roller, except where the use of
 a vibratory roller is permitted. When using a pneumatic-tired roller, care shall be taken in that initial rolling by the
 steel wheel roller be restricted to one pass where upon the pneumatic-tired roller shall immediately follow the initial
 
 II.84
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 steel wheel rolling.
 Vibratory rollers may be used on base, binder and surface courses subject to the conditions set forth herein.
 Vibratory rollers to be used may be of the single drum type with pneumatic-tired drive wheels or the double steel drum
 type with vibratory mechanism in one or both drums. All vibratory rollers shall have a static mass of at least 7.5
 metric tons and shall be equipped with an automatic disconnect device to disconnect the vibratory mechanism when
 the roller is not in motion. They shall also be equipped with a manual over-ride device to disconnect the vibratory
 mechanism if the automatic device should fail.
 All vibratory rollers shall also be equipped with the following equipment: a large and clearly visible speed
 indicator; an amplitude setting indicator and a frequency setting indicator. They shall also have instructional plates
 attached which shall include operational instructions and recommended amplitude and frequency settings. A vibratory
 tachometer shall also be provided with each roller for use by the Engineer.
 Vibratory rollers shall not be used on bridges or other structures and their use in urban areas may be
 restricted. They shall not be used on thin overlays 25 millimeters or less in thickness, except that vibratory rollers of
 the double drum type may be used in a static condition to compact such overlays, provided that when so operated they
 shall be able to obtain the degree of density and smoothness required to conform to the specifications.
 When vibratory rollers are used for the compaction of base and binder material they shall be operated at a
 high amplitude setting and a low frequency setting in the range of 1500 to 1700 VPM. When used for the compaction
 of surface courses they shall be operated at a low amplitude setting at a minimum frequency setting of at least 2200
 VPM or higher, if a higher frequency setting is recommended by the manufacturer of the roller. The use of a vibratory
 roller incapable of being operated at a frequency setting of at least 2200 VPM will not be permitted on surface courses.
 No deviation from this latter requirement will be allowed. In compacting surface courses a vibratory roller shall not
 be operated at a speed in excess of 5 kilometers per hour.
 A vibratory roller shall be operated with the vibration drum or drums in the direction of the paver and the
 vibrating action of the roller shall be completely shut off during change of direction. Due care shall be exercised to
 start the vibratory action only when the roller is in motion. During the rolling of layered pavement, in order to prevent
 creeping and aggregate crushing, care shall be taken not to exceed two passes with the vibrator in action. For deep lift
 pavements, these passes shall normally not exceed two in each direction, except that the number of vibratory passes in
 either direction may be varied in order to obtain the required density.
 The final rolling of all courses shall be performed with a steel wheeled roller of sufficient mass for final
 smoothing of the surface.
 The use of a vibratory roller may be suspended by the Engineer if, in his/her opinion, satisfactory results are
 not being obtained and no further amount of mix shall be spread in such case until a sufficient number of approved
 rollers are on the project site to satisfy compaction requirements.
 A plate shall be attached to each conventional roller which shall show the ballasted and unballasted mass per
 millimeter of tread.
 The number of rollers required shall be governed by the tonnage of hot-mix being placed daily. A sufficient
 number shall be provided to compact the mixture in accordance with the specifications. The number of passes
 required may be varied and shall be governed by compaction results. The Engineer may require that a stand-by roller
 be provided if in his/her opinion it is necessary in the event of a breakdown.
 Each roller shall be operated by a competent, experienced roller operator and shall be kept in a nearly
 continuous operation as practicable while work is underway. The mixture shall be rolled longitudinally, diagonally
 and transversely as may be necessary to produce the required contour for surface. Longitudinal rolling shall start at the
 side and proceed toward the center of the pavement, except on superelevated curves where the rolling shall begin on
 the low side and progress to the high side, overlapping on successive trips by at least 300 millimeters. The rolling
 shall be continued and so executed that all roller marks, ridges, porous spots and impressions are eliminated and the
 resulting surface has the required grade and contour. The motion of the rollers shall at all times be slow enough to
 avoid any displacement of the hot mixture. Any displacement or marring of the surface occurring as a result of
 reversing the direction of the rollers, or from any other cause, shall be corrected. To prevent adhesion with the
 mixture, the wheels of the steel rollers shall be kept lightly moistened with water but excess water will not be
 permitted. The use of oil for this purpose will not be allowed.
 To prevent “rolloff” of the pavement edges and longitudinal joints on deep lift paving, the outer
 200 millimeters ± of the deep lift mixture shall be left unrolled until the temperature of the mix ranges between,
 65 °C and 80 °C, whereupon it shall be compacted by the steel roller.
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.85
 
 Along curbs, structures and all places not accessible with a roller, the mixture shall be thoroughly compacted
 with mechanical tamping devices. The surface of the mixture after compaction shall be smooth and true to the
 established line and grade.
 The densities of the completed pavement shall not be less than 95% of the density obtained from Laboratory
 compaction of a mixture composed of the same materials in like proportions. Laboratory compaction will be
 performed by Department Standard Methods.
 460.65
 
 Joints.
 
 Placing of the mixture shall be as nearly continuous as possible and the roller shall pass over the unprotected
 end of the newly placed mixture only when the placing of the course is to be discontinued for such length of time as
 would permit the mixture to attain initial stability. In all such cases, including the formation of joints as here specified,
 provision shall be made for proper bond with the new surface for the full specified depths of the courses.
 All transverse joints, all longitudinal joints of the surface course and all longitudinal joints in the Dense
 Binder Course under Open Graded Friction Course or Open Graded Friction Course-Modified shall be treated prior to
 laying the next lane of bituminous concrete as follows:
 The joint shall be coated with a hot poured rubberized asphalt sealant meeting the requirements of Federal
 Specification Number SS-S-1401.
 When using pavers in tandem, the use of the hot poured rubberized asphalt sealer may be omitted at the
 discretion of the Engineer, if the temperature of the mixture at the longitudinal joint does not fall below
 95 °C prior to the placement of the adjacent mat. No reheating of the joint shall be permitted.
 The hot poured rubberized asphalt shall be applied to the joints from a double jacketed heating kettle with a
 positive drive gear pump that is connected to a suitable applicator. The nozzle of the applicator shall be set to deliver
 sufficient sealant to effectively bond and seal the transverse and longitudinal paving joint between two adjacent lanes
 of bituminous concrete.
 Longitudinal and transverse joints shall be made in a careful manner, well bonded and sealed, and true to line
 and grade. Where and as directed, transverse joints for all courses and longitudinal joints for the top course placed
 under this or previous contracts shall be cut back to expose the full depth of the course and, when the laying of the
 course is resumed, the exposed edge of the joint shall be treated as above.
 In making joints along any adjoining edge such as curb, gutter or an adjoining pavement, and after the
 mixture is placed by the mechanical spreader, just enough of the hot material shall be placed by hand method to fill
 any space left open. These joints shall be properly "set-up" with the back of a rake at the proper height and level to
 receive the maximum compaction. The work of "setting-up" these joints shall be performed only by competent
 workers.
 Where and as directed, the first width of any course shall be placed not less than 300 millimeters wider than
 the first width of top course, and successive widths of top and as any other courses shall be so placed that there will be
 at least a 300 millimeter overlap between the joints in the top course and the other course.
 The rolling of the successive widths of courses shall overlap and shall be performed so as to leave smooth,
 uniform joints and cross sections.
 460.66
 
 Pavement on Bridges.
 
 The bituminous concrete mixtures for protective course paving on bridges shall consist of “Dense Binder
 Course” as specified hereinbefore for such mix and work performance requirements. The mixtures shall be treated
 with an approved antistripping compound as specified under M3.10.0.
 The protective course over any area shall be placed within 24 hours after the membrane waterproofing over
 the area has been placed unless exception is granted by the Engineer.
 The use of smaller rollers may be permitted, with the approval of the Engineer for compaction of the
 protective course only.
 No vehicular traffic shall be permitted over any bare membrane waterproofing except as provided for under
 Subsection 965.62.
 The top course of pavement on bridges shall consist of “Modified Top Course” and be placed only after the
 curbing and edging are in place in the work.

 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 Testing Surfaces.
 
 The plane of the finished surfaces of the base courses and/or binder course and the top course of the
 compacted mixtures, shall be tested with a 5 meter straightedge, except that a 3 meter straightedge may be used on
 vertical curves. The straightedge shall be carefully applied immediately after first compaction by rolling and, from
 then on, as may be necessary until and after the final compaction of the material in place. The straightedge shall be
 held in successive positions parallel to the road centerline and in contact with the road surface; and the entire area
 checked from one side to the other of the pavement.
 The top course of resurfaced streets which contain manhole covers, water gate boxes, etc., shall be tested as
 specified hereinbefore except that a 3 meters straightedge shall be used. Any irregularities which vary 5 millimeters
 from a true finished surface or 10 millimeters from a true surface in base or binder course shall be corrected.
 Irregularities which may develop before the completion of rolling and while the material is still workable,
 may be remedied by loosening the surface mixture and removing or adding material as necessary. Should any
 irregularities or surface defects remain after final compaction the defective work shall be corrected by removing and
 replacing the new material, as specified to form a true and even surface of regular texture. All minor surface
 projections, joints and minor honeycombed surfaces shall be ironed out smoothly to grade, as may be directed.
 Adequate and approved straightedges shall be furnished and used by the Contractor with supervision and
 inspection by the Engineer. The Contractor shall provide or designate a competent employee whose duty shall be to
 carefully use the straightedge to check the compacted surfaces.
 The entire cost for furnishing adequate and approved straightedges with the use of same and the repair or
 removal and replacement of pavement, as may be required by the Engineer, shall be borne by the Contractor as part of
 the payment made to him/her for the relevant contract items.
 460.68
 
 Opening to Traffic.
 
 No vehicular traffic or loads shall be permitted on the newly completed pavement until adequate stability has
 been attained and the material has cooled sufficiently to prevent distortion or loss of fines. If the climatic or other
 conditions warrant it, the period of time before opening to traffic may be extended at the discretion of the Engineer.

 Method of Measurement.
 
 Bituminous concrete shall be measured by the metric ton and shall be the actual and verified metric tonnage,
 complete in place and approved. The quantity shall be determined only by weight slips that have been properly
 countersigned by the Engineer at the time of delivery.
 Bitumen used for tack coat, if required by plans or specifications or ordered by the Engineer, will be measured as
 specified in Subsection 468.80.
 Measurement for sealing of longitudinal joints in bituminous concrete shall be by the meter of joint sealed.
 460.81
 
 Basis of Payment.
 
 The metric tonnage of bituminous concrete, determined as provided above, will be paid for at the contract unit
 price per metric ton of the kind of bituminous concrete required, complete in place including butt joint sealant, if required.
 Bitumen as specified herein to be paid for as tack coat, if required, will be paid for at the contract unit price per
 liter under the item for Bitumen for Tack Coat, complete in place.

 General.
 
 The cement concrete pavement may be constructed by the Slip-Form Method or the Fixed-Form Method.
 Equipment and tools necessary for handling material and performing all parts of the work shall be approved by
 the Engineer as to design, capacity, and mechanical condition. The equipment shall be at the job site sufficiently ahead of
 the start of construction operations to be examined thoroughly and approved. Any equipment or tools which are not
 maintained in full working order or which, as used by the Contractor, prove inadequate to obtain the results prescribed,
 shall be improved or new equipment or tools substituted or added as directed.
 Grade control survey and staking shall conform to Subsection 5.07. The Contractor shall furnish, set, and
 maintain all line and grade stakes for grading and paving.
 476.61
 
 Preparation of Grade.
 
 The sub-base shall consist of gravel or dense graded crushed stone conforming to Section 401 or Section 402, or
 of soil cement, and shall be as specified on the plans. The sub-base shall be conditioned and perfected not less than 150
 meters in advance of the placing of the concrete. If any traffic is allowed to use the prepared grade, the grade shall be
 checked and corrected immediately ahead of the placing of the concrete.
 Sub-base prepared for the slip-form method shall be placed to a compacted depth approximately
 25 millimeters higher than the grade called for on the plans to allow for planing by approved mechanical means to the
 proper profile. It shall also be placed to a width 1 meter greater (500 millimeters on each side) than the required pavement
 slab width. After the sub-base has been placed and compacted to the required density, and will adequately support the
 subgrade machine and the slip-form paver, the track areas shall be cut to the proper elevation by the use of a mechanical
 form grading machine.
 Behind the form grading machine the track areas shall be rolled to a smooth, firm, and uniform surface.
 The grade on which the pavement is to be constructed shall then be brought to the proper profile by means of a
 track mounted subgrade machine operation on the prepared track line or by other mechanical means approved by the
 Engineer. When concrete is placed, the surface of the sub-base shall not be above, nor more than 20 millimeters below the
 
 II.96
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 plan subgrade elevation. If the density of the subgrade is disturbed by the subgrade machine, it shall be corrected by
 additional compaction before concrete is placed.
 The sub-base, after being conditioned, shall provide a firm unyielding support which will not be displaced under
 the movement of the paver. If the sub-base is displaced by the movement of the paver to the extent that the finished
 pavement will be affected, the two areas that will support the slip-form paver tracks shall be stabilized as provided herein.
 The areas to be stabilized will be immediately outside the edge lines of the pavement slab on both sides and are each to be
 not less than 500 millimeters in width, measured from the exterior edges of the proposed pavement slab.
 If cement is used for stabilization, the material to be stabilized shall be loosened and pulverized before any
 cement is added. Cement shall be uniformly spread on the loosened and pulverized material at the rate of approximately
 22 kilograms per square meter. The final depth of stabilization shall be not less than
 100 millimeters in the completed track area after it is brought to proper elevation. The exact amount of cement to be used
 to adequately harden the mixture of cement and subgrade material will be determined by the Engineer.
 The cement and subgrade material shall be thoroughly mixed by means of a power driven mixer until the mixture
 is of a uniform color throughout the full required depth.
 After the cement and subgrade material have been mixed, water shall be added to the mixture and mixing
 continued until the water is uniformly distributed throughout the mixture. The amount of water to be added will be
 determined by the Engineer. The moist mixture when ready for compaction shall be near its optimum moisture content.
 The mixture shall be uniformly compacted for the full depth until it is firm and unyielding, and within
 2 hours after the addition of the water. Compaction shall be with a 9 metric ton three wheeled or tandem roller, approved
 rubber-tired roller or approved mechanical vibrator.
 After compaction, the surface of the area that will support the paver tracks shall be cut to true profile and
 elevation by approved mechanical equipment and then rolled to obtain a smooth, true surface.
 The stabilization shall be protected from drying by the application of approved bituminous material
 (approximately 1.0 liter per square meter) or cover of straw, sand or earth. If straw, sand or earth is used for cover, it must
 be broomed off before the area is used in further operations. The curing material shall be applied immediately after final
 rolling and maintained for at least 2 days.
 In lieu of the above method and procedure for stabilization of the track area, other proven methods and materials
 will be considered subject to equivalent and acceptable performance.
 Regardless of the method, materials and procedures used, the burden or responsibility for the acceptability of
 work shall rest with the Contractor.
 If stabilization of the track areas is required such stabilization will not be paid for separately, but will be included
 under Item 476, Cement Concrete Pavement.
 Where fixed-form construction is specified, the use of a subgrade machine may follow form setting.
 When side forms have been securely set to grade, the sub-base shall be brought to proper cross section. The fine
 grading shall be compacted by means of approved equipment to a condition similar to that of surrounding grade. A subbase check template shall be used as a final check. The surface of the sub-base shall not be above nor more than 10
 millimeters below the plan sub-base elevation. Any deviation from the required sub-base surface exceeding this tolerance
 shall be corrected.
 The template shall span the width being paved and be supported on the side forms. It may be power or hand
 operated, with scratch teeth or pins which can be adjusted readily to the required cross section and supported in a frame of
 sufficient weight and strength to withstand the loads. The points of the teeth or pins shall be adjusted to be at the plan subbase elevation. High areas shall be trimmed to proper elevation. Low areas shall be filled and compacted to a condition
 similar to that of surrounding grade except that areas which are not more than 20 millimeters below sub-base elevation
 may be filled with concrete integral with the pavement. The finished grade shall be maintained in a smooth and
 compacted condition until the pavement is placed.
 The sub-base shall be uniformly moist when the concrete is placed. When the sub-base is dry, it shall be
 sprinkled with as much water as can be readily absorbed immediately in advance of placing concrete. It shall also have
 been similarly sprinkled not less than 8 hours or more than 24 hours before concrete is placed thereon.
 476.62
 
 Forms and Form Setting.
 
 Where fixed-form construction is specified, the straight side forms shall be made of metal and shall be furnished
 in sections not less than 3 meters in length. Forms shall have a depth equal to the prescribed edge thickness of the
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.97
 
 concrete without horizontal joint and a base width equal to the depth of the forms but not less than 200 millimeters.
 Flange braces shall extend outward on the base not less than 2/3 the height of the form. Flexible or curved forms of
 proper radius shall be used for curves of 60 meter radius or less and be of a design acceptable to the Engineer.
 Satisfactory wooden forms, as approved by the Engineer, may be used for curves of 60 meter radius or less or where the
 design of pavement is such that the metal forms cannot be used. Forms shall be provided with adequate devices for secure
 setting so that when in place they will withstand, without visible spring or settlement, the impact and vibration of the
 consolidating and finishing equipment. Forms with battered top surfaces and bent, twisted or broken forms shall be
 removed from the work. Repaired forms shall not be used until inspected and approved by the Engineer. The top face of
 the form shall not vary from a true plane by more than 1 millimeter in 1 meter, and the upstanding leg shall not vary from a
 true plane by more than 1 millimeter in 1 meter. The forms shall contain provisions for locking the ends of abutting form
 sections together tightly and for secure setting. Forms to be used for concrete which is to be furnished by hand shall have
 a base not less than 150 millimeters in width.
 The foundation under the forms shall be hard and true to grade so that the form, when set, will be firmly in
 contact for its whole length and at the specified grade. Any grade which at the form line is found below established grade
 shall be filled to grade with granular material in lifts of 10 millimeters or less for a distance of 500 millimeters on each
 side of the base of the form, and thoroughly compacted. Imperfections or variations above grade shall be corrected by
 tamping or by cutting as necessary.
 After the forms have been set to correct grade, the grade shall be thoroughly tamped, mechanically or by hand, at
 both the inside and outside edges of the base of the forms. Forms shall be joined neatly and tightly and staked securely
 with not less than 3 pins for each 3 meter section. A pin shall be placed at each side of every joint. Form sections shall be
 tightly locked free from play or movement in any direction. If any play or movement of the forms occurs, additional pins
 shall be required by the Engineer. The entire base of forms shall be directly in contact with the finished sub-base. If a
 form does not have satisfactory bearing area for its full length, it shall be removed, the bearing area of sub-base reshaped
 and compacted, and the form replaced. Building of pedestals of earth or other materials upon which to reset the forms in
 order to bring them to the required grade is not permitted. Forms shall be set at least 150 meters in advance of the point of
 placing concrete. They shall be thoroughly cleaned and greased or soaped before concrete is placed against them. No
 excessive settlement or springing of forms under the finishing machine will be tolerated.
 The forms shall be set to correct line and grade. Smooth alignment and grade shall be checked by sighting and
 with an approved 3 meter straight-edge. The alignment and grade elevations of the forms shall be checked and corrections
 made by the Contractor immediately before placing the concrete. When any form has been disturbed or any grade has
 become unstable, the form shall be reset and rechecked. Use of a straight-edge will not be required on vertical curves. A
 mechanical tamper of approved type and design will be permitted for use in the preparation of a firm, even sub-base for
 form installation.
 476.63
 
 Batching and Mixing Concrete.
 
 The materials shall be batched at a central plant. The batch plant site, layout, equipment, and provisions for
 transporting material shall be such as to assure a continuous operation of the paver employed on the project. The work
 shall be done in accordance with the relevant provisions of Subsection M4.02.08.
 Concrete may be mixed at the site of construction or at a central point. Mixers shall conform to the applicable
 requirements of Subsection M4.02.09.
 Concrete mixed at a central plant shall be hauled to the paving site by agitation trucks or other approved haul
 units in accordance with the relevant provisions of Subsection M4.02.10.
 Concrete mixed completely in truck mixers in accordance with Subsection M4.02.10 (A-1), may be allowed
 when approved by the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall obtain approval of his/her proposed central mix plant site, its capacity, concrete materials
 sources, hauling equipment, proposed haul routes, etc. prior to moving said equipment onto project.
 Concrete mixed in pavers at the site shall be mixed for a period of not less than 60 seconds including transfer
 time but no less than 50 seconds, exclusive of transfer time, after all materials, except water, are in the drum. The mixer
 shall be operated at drum speed shown on the manufacturer’s name plate. The manufacturer’s guaranteed capacity of the
 mixer shall not be less than 1 cubic meter. Except by written permission of the Engineer, the mixer shall not be operated
 in excess of its guaranteed capacity nor by more than 10% above its rated capacity as shown on the standard rating plate
 on the machine, when operating on grades not exceeding 6%.
 
 II.98
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 The batch shall be so charged into the drum that a portion of the mixing water shall enter in advance of the
 cement and aggregates. The flow of water shall be uniform and all water shall be in the drum by the end of the first 20
 seconds of the mixing period. The entire contents shall be removed from the drum before the succeeding batch is
 introduced. The inside of the drum shall be kept free from hardened concrete. The skip and throat of the mixer drum shall
 be kept clean and free of accumulation or encrustations of inert materials and the admission of these materials to the mixer
 shall be cause for rejection of the batch in which they are included. The concrete, as discharged from the mixer, shall be
 uniform in composition and consistency. If this condition is not produced with the maximum size of batch, the size of the
 batch shall be reduced or the mixing time increased, or both, until an acceptable mixture is obtained.
 As required above, all materials except water shall be admitted to the mixer simultaneously and thereafter no
 additional amount of any ingredient shall be admitted to the mixer, except on specific instructions of the Engineer or
 his/her representative, for each individual batch. Such instructions shall not be given for more than three consecutive
 batches after which the proportions of the mix shall be correct prior to the initial charging of the mixer, and further, such
 instructions shall not relax the following restrictions concerning the retempering of concrete.
 Retempering of concrete by the addition of water will not be permitted. The addition of water to the batch in the
 mixer after 10 minutes have elapsed after the initial charging, or the addition of water to the concrete after removal from
 the mixer, shall be construed as retempering. Batches of concrete prepared contrary to these restrictions shall be rejected
 and immediately removed from the site. The concrete shall be mixed only in the quantity required for immediate use and
 concrete not in place within 30 minutes from the time the ingredients were charged into the mixing drum, or that has
 developed initial set, shall not be used.
 The concrete shall have a slump of between 40 and 75 millimeters if not vibrated, or between 25 and
 50 millimeters if vibrated throughout, as measured in accordance with AASHTO Designation T 119.
 Batches shall be discharged in a manner to facilitate placing the concrete in its final position with a minimum of
 rehandling and without damage to forms, concrete previously placed, or other parts of the work.
 The interval between loads shall be controlled in order that concrete in place will not become partially hardened
 prior to placing succeeding batches and in no case shall it exceed 30 minutes. Plant capacity and transportation facilities
 shall be sufficient to insure delivery of concrete at the rate required.
 Samples of concrete for test and test specimens will be taken from transportation units at the point of discharge
 or from the concrete in place as determined by the Engineer.
 When cement concrete paving operations are done during cold weather, the stipulations as outlined in Subsection
 901.72 shall apply.
 476.64
 
 Placing Concrete.
 
 Concrete shall be placed only on an approved sub-base.
 The Contractor shall notify the Engineer at least 24 hours in advance of placing the concrete. In the event the
 Contractor desires to operate after the daylight hours, the Contractor shall provide a lighting system sufficiently adequate
 to illuminate all of the operations to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 No finishing of the concrete will be permitted after daylight hours unless an adequate and approved lighting
 system is provided by the Contractor and operated in a satisfactory manner. Approval of the lighting system by the
 Engineer must be obtained prior to its use.
 At least 150 meters of foundation shall have been prepared ahead of the mixer or concrete operations at all times.
 The depositing of concrete on excessively wet subgrades or sub-bases or a frozen foundation will not be permitted. No
 concrete shall be placed around manholes or other structures until they have been installed to the required grade and
 alignment.
 During dry weather, when traffic on the foundation or adjacent roadways would deposit wind-blown dust and dirt
 on the freshly placed concrete before it can be protected, the Contractor shall sprinkle the foundation or adjacent roadways
 with water or otherwise apply satisfactory treatment to keep down the dust.
 Unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer, all equipment used for mixing, hauling and placing the concrete
 shall be operated outside of the area being paved. Should operation of such equipment be permitted on the prepared
 foundation, suitable planks or platforms shall be provided and used for the equipment to run on, so that the foundation will
 be maintained in an approved condition.
 The concrete shall be deposited on the grade in such a manner as to require as little handling as possible.
 Concrete shall be distributed in such a manner that when consolidated and finished, the slab-thickness and surface grade
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.99
 
 required by the plans will be obtained at all points. Unless truck-mixers, truck-agitators, or nonagitating hauling
 equipment demonstrate that they will discharge concrete without segregation of the materials, the concrete shall be
 unloaded into an approved spreading device and mechanically spread on the grade in such a manner as to prevent
 segregation of the materials. Placing shall be continuous between transverse joints without the use of intermediate
 bulkheads except as specified under Subsection 476.68 for construction joints. Necessary hand spreading shall be done
 with shovels, not rakes. Workmen shall not be allowed to walk in the freshly mixed concrete with boots or shoes coated
 with earth or foreign substances.
 The concrete shall be deposited carefully at and around contraction and expansion joints. It shall be shoveled
 against both sides of expansion joints simultaneously, maintaining equal pressure on both sides. Care shall be taken that
 the concrete is worked under all metal parts of the load transfer assemblies. The concrete shall not be dumped directly
 upon or against the joints in any manner which displaces the load transfer assemblies or joint material from the true
 position.
 Should any concrete materials fall on or be worked into the surface of a completed slab, they shall be removed
 immediately by approved methods.
 Where concrete is to be placed adjoining a previously constructed lane of pavement and mechanical equipment
 will be operated upon the existing lane of pavement, that lane may be opened to traffic when curing operations have been
 completed provided that beam tests show that the concrete has attained a modulus of rupture of at least 3.8 megaPascals.
 Curing operations will not be considered completed unless a curing period of at least 7 days has elapsed since the concrete
 was placed. However, the pavement may be used at the end of 5 days if only rubber-tired finishing equipment is permitted
 to operate upon it and the concrete has attained a modulus of rupture of at least 3.8 megaPascals.
 When high early strength concrete is used, mechanical equipment may be operated upon the pavement after a
 shorter period of curing or as beam tests show that the concrete has attained a modulus of rupture of at least 3.8
 megaPascals.
 Pavers will not be permitted to operate on the finished pavement unless permission is given by the Engineer.
 Gaps in the pavement for crossovers will not be permitted. Should crossings be necessary, suitable bridging of
 slabs or sand cushioning will be provided, as approved by the Engineer.
 476.65
 
 Spreading and Strike-Off of Concrete.
 
 As soon as concrete has been placed on the sub-base, it shall be immediately struck-off accurately, by means of
 an approved mechanical spreading device, leaving a surface uniform in texture, true to grade, elevation and contour. The
 strike-off shall be so adjusted for elevation that when the concrete is consolidated, as herein designated, sufficient material
 remains above grade as is required for the final finished surface of the pavement.
 When reinforced concrete pavement is placed in two layers, the entire width of the bottom layer shall be struckoff to such length and depth that the sheet of fabric or bar mat may be laid full length on the concrete in its final position
 without further manipulation. The reinforcement shall then be placed directly upon the concrete, after which the top layer
 of the concrete shall be placed, struck-off and screeded. Any portion of the bottom layer of concrete which has been
 placed more than 30 minutes without being covered with the top layer shall be removed and replaced with freshly mixed
 concrete at the Contractor’s expense.
 A. Slip-Form Method.
 The slip-form paver shall be an approved machine designed to spread, consolidate, screed, and float finish the
 freshly placed concrete in one complete pass of the machine in such manner that a minimum of hand finish will be
 necessary to provide a dense and homogenous pavement in conformance with the plans and specifications.
 The slip-form paver shall be of the self-propelled type, equipped with crawler type tracks not less than
 6.7 meters in length.
 The machine shall vibrate the concrete for the full width and depth of the strip of pavement being placed. Such
 vibration shall be accomplished with vibrating tubes or arms working in the concrete or with a vibrating screed or pan
 operating on the surface of the concrete. The sliding forms shall be rigidly held together laterally to prevent spreading of
 the forms. The forms shall trail behind the paver for such distance that no appreciable slumping of the concrete will occur,
 and that necessary final finishing can be accomplished while the concrete is still within the forms.
 The slip-form paver shall be adjustable as to crown and super-elevation and shall shape and compact the concrete
 to the required cross section as shown on the plans. Such adjustments shall be readily controllable for accuracy in
 transitions. No tractive force shall be applied to the machine except that which is controlled from the machine.
 
 II.100
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 The concrete shall be of uniform consistency such that there will be no appreciable slumping at the edge of the
 pavement after the slip-forms have passed. The following tolerances on edge slump shall apply: edge slump, exclusive of
 edge rounding, shall not exceed 1 millimeter within 30 millimeters of the edge at the extreme outside limits of the concrete
 pavement: at the longitudinal joint along the pavement crown and along the longitudinal joint between the travel lanes and
 speed change lanes. The edges along the longitudinal joint between the two travel lanes of the same cross-slope shall be at
 true finish grade. Any deviation from these tolerances shall be corrected while the concrete is plastic.
 The slip-form paver shall be operated with as nearly a continuous forward movement as possible and all
 operations of mixing, delivering and spreading concrete shall be so coordinated as to provide uniform progress with
 stopping and starting of the paver held to a minimum. If for any reason, it is necessary to stop the forward movement of
 the paver, the vibratory and tamping elements shall also be stopped immediately.
 For reinforced pavement and where necessary, more than one machine and/or complimentary equipment will be
 allowed, subject to the Engineer’s approval.
 B. Fixed-Form Method.
 The spreading machine shall be mechanical, self-propelled, and of an approved type. It shall be capable of
 spreading the concrete evenly between the side forms, without segregation, and without introducing thrust on the side
 form. It shall be equipped with a spreading device, adjustable in height for distributing the concrete longitudinally and
 transversely, and a blade adjustable in height to strike-off the concrete at the required elevation above or below the top of
 the side form.
 Immediately after the concrete has been struck off, it shall be thoroughly consolidated against and along the faces
 of all forms and along the full length and around all parts of joint assemblies, by means of vibrators inserted in the
 concrete.
 Vibrators, for full width vibration of concrete paving slabs, may be either the surface pan type or the internal type
 with either immersed tube or multiple spuds. They may be attached to the spreader or the finishing machine, or may be
 mounted on a separate carriage. They shall not come in contact with the joint, load transfer devices, subgrade, or side
 forms. The frequency of the surface vibrators shall not be less than 3,500 impulses per minute and the frequency of the
 internal type shall not be less than 5,000 impulses per minute for tube vibrators and not less than 7,000 impulses per
 minute for spud vibrators.
 When spud type internal vibrators, either hand operated or attached to spreaders or finishing machines, are used
 adjacent to forms, they shall have a frequency of not less than 3,500 impulses per minute.
 Vibrators shall not cause the displacement of the side forms nor cause undue delay due to mechanical difficulties.
 Should these problems arise, they shall be removed from the work and be replaced by equipment meeting these
 specifications.
 Surface vibrating apparatus shall be used only on the top course or layer of the pavement and must be completely
 out of use when moving over transverse joints or when spreading the bottom course of concrete in two-course
 construction. It shall not be operated where the surface of the concrete, as spread, is below the elevation of the finished
 surface of the pavement.
 476.66
 
 Placing Steel Reinforcement.
 
 All reinforcing metal must be kept clean and free from dirt, oil, paint, grease, mill scale, loose or thick rust or any
 foreign material which could impair bond of the steel with the concrete. Welded sheet fabric and clipped bar mats shall be
 furnished in flat sheets and shall be handled carefully during the placing, and kept straight until installed.
 The reinforcement shall be placed as shown on the plans. The reinforcement shall be placed so that the extreme
 longitudinal member will be located not more than 100 millimeters from the edge of the slab section and the ends of all
 longitudinal members shall extend to within 75 millimeters of the ends of the slab sections. Adjacent sheets of welded
 fabric and clipped bar mats shall be lapped as shown on the plans.
 Mats or sheets of reinforcement shall be preformed in accordance with the schedule shown on the plans, and
 placed in the concrete by the strike-off method without chairs or other supporting devices. Laps between adjacent mats or
 sheets and positions of same with respect to longitudinal joints, transverse joints and edges of pavement shall be as shown
 on the plans.
 Concreting operations shall be performed in a manner so that the mats and sheets will be left in required position.
 When reinforced concrete is specified, or permitted by the Engineer, to be placed in one layer,the reinforcement
 may be positioned in advance of concrete placement or it may be placed in plastic concrete by mechanical or vibratory

 means immediately after the concrete has been spread and struck-off.
 476.67
 
 Finishing Concrete.
 
 Immediately after placement, concrete shall be properly finished. The sequence of operations shall be as
 follows: strike-off, consolidation, transverse screeding, longitudinal floating, straightedging, texturing and finally edging
 of formed joints. The machine method of finishing shall be employed, except that odd widths or shapes of slab may be
 finished by hand method.
 The addition of superficial water to the surface of the concrete to assist in finishing operations will not be
 permitted.
 A. Machine Finishing.
 When the concrete paver is not designed to screed and float finish the freshly placed concrete, the surface shall
 be struck-off and screeded by an approved finishing machine.
 The transverse finishing machine for the pavement shall be mechanical, self-propelled, and of an approved type.
 It shall be equipped with at least two oscillating screeds. It shall have an independent screed and traction speeds to permit
 the operator to choose a combination of speeds that will produce the required finish with the consistency of concrete being
 used. The tops of the forms shall be kept clean by an effective device attached to the machine and the travel of the
 machine on the forms shall be maintained true without lift, wobbling, or other variation tending to affect the precision
 finish.
 The transverse finishing machine shall consolidate and screed the concrete with no more than two passages over
 the slab, except with the special permission of the Engineer. The operation of the machine shall be controlled so as to
 prevent excess mortar and water from being worked to the top of the slab, and from forming a watery mortar in the roll of
 concrete in front of the screeds.
 If excess mortar does form, it shall be removed from the site and wasted. It shall not, under any circumstances,
 be placed on the sub-base or shoveled ahead on top of the slab. Segregated particles of coarse aggregate which may
 collect in front of the screed shall be wasted outside the forms.
 A uniform depth roll of concrete shall be maintained in front of the screeds at all times, in order to secure
 uniform consolidation and to prevent lifting of the screed by irregular amount or overload of concrete.
 When vibration is permitted vibrators for full width vibration of concrete paving slabs shall meet the requirement
 herein of Subsection 476.65(B). If uniform and satisfactory density of the concrete is not obtained by the vibratory
 method at joints, along forms, at structures, and throughout the pavement, the Contractor shall furnish equipment and
 methods which will produce pavement conforming to the Specifications.
 B. Longitudinal Finishing.
 As soon as possible after the transverse finishing has been completed as specified above, the surface of the
 concrete shall be further smoothed and finished by use of an approved longitudinal float.
 Mechanical Method - The float in contact with the pavement shall be at least 3.75 meters in length and at least
 300 millimeters wide. The type of float and details of its construction shall be approved by the Engineer, and it shall be in
 good working condition.
 The tracks from which the float operates shall be accurately adjusted to the required crown. The float shall be
 accurately adjusted and coordinated with the adjustments of the transverse finishing machine so that a small amount of
 mortar is carried ahead of the float at all times. The forward speed shall be adjusted so that the float will lap the distance
 specified by the Engineer on each transverse trip. The float shall pass over each area of pavement no more than twice
 except with the special permission of the Engineer. Any excess water or soupy material shall be wasted over the side
 forms on each pass.
 Hand Method - When strike-off and consolidation are done by hand methods and longitudinal floating by hand is
 required the float shall be not less than 5 meters in length, not less than 250 millimeters in width, suitably stiffened against
 flexibility and warping and equipped with suitable handles. It shall be operated from bridges spanning the pavement. It
 shall be operated with a sawing motion parallel to the center line while passing gradually from one side of the pavement to
 the other. Movement ahead shall be in successive advances of not more than one-half the length of the float. Excess
 water or soupy material shall be wasted over the side forms of each pass.
 C. Alternate Finishing and Floating.
 As an alternative to the mechanical finishing and floating method in Subsection 476.67(A) and (B) preceding, the
 Contractor may use a long wheel base combination float-finishing machine in lieu of the transverse finishing machine and
 
 II.102
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 longitudinal float, providing the combination machine can be adjusted to produce satisfactory results and final finishing is
 properly timed. Any combination of screeding, floating and finishing machines shall include at least two transverse
 oscillating screeds.
 D. Hand Finishing.
 Unless otherwise specified, hand finishing methods will not be permitted except under the following conditions:
 In the event of breakdown of the mechanical equipment, hand methods may be used to finish the concrete
 already deposited on the grade when the breakdown occurs. Narrow widths or areas of irregular dimensions
 where operations of the mechanical equipment is impractical may be finished by hand methods.
 The surface of the concrete shall be struck-off immediately after it is placed and leveled by means of an
 adjustable steel template 250 millimeters wide and 500 millimeters longer than the width of the pavement. A second
 adjustable steel template 200 millimeters wide and 500 millimeters longer than the width of the pavement shall be used
 directly behind this template. Both templates shall be constructed to produce pavement of the desired cross section and
 shall have sufficient strength to retain their shape under all working conditions. The templates shall be moved forward
 with a combined longitudinal and crosswise motion fully resting at all times on the forms, and during the operation, the
 distance between the two templates shall at no time exceed
 3 meters. The template shall be used until a true surface is obtained. While the concrete is being struck-off with the first
 template, three or more men shall be at work leveling, spading and tamping the concrete in front of the template.
 Consolidation shall be attained by the use of a suitable vibrator or other approved equipment.
 After the concrete has been struck-off with the hand templates described previously, other finishing operations
 described as following the screeding by the finishing machines shall be carried out.
 Straightedging operations following the screeding shall be sufficient to remove surface irregularities or produce a
 riding surface equivalent to that produced by machine operation.
 Experienced skilled operators and concrete finishers shall be employed. Any laxity in this respect shall be cause
 for immediate suspension of concreting operations.
 E. Finishing at Joints.
 The concrete adjacent to joints shall be compacted or firmly placed without voids or segregation against the joint
 material, under and around all load transfer devices, joint assembly units, and other features designed to extend into the
 pavement. Concrete adjacent to joints shall be mechanically vibrated as required in Subsection 476.65. After the concrete
 has been placed and vibrated adjacent to the joints the machine shall be brought forward operating in a manner to avoid
 damage or misalignment of joints. If uninterrupted operation of the finishing machine, to, over, and beyond the joints
 causes segregation of concrete, damage to or misalignment of the joints, the finishing machine shall be stopped when the
 front screed is approximately
 250 millimeters from the joint. Segregated concrete shall be removed from in front of and off the joint: the front screed
 shall be lifted and set directly on top of the joint and the forward motion of the finishing machine resumed. When the
 second screed is close enough to permit the excess mortar in front of it to flow over the joint, it shall be lifted and carried
 over the joint. Thereafter, the finishing machine may be run over the joint without lifting the screeds, provided there is no
 segregated concrete immediately between the joint and the screed or on top of the joint.
 The edges of the slabs on both sides of the transverse expansion joint shall be finished to the same grade. The
 top transverse edges of formed joints shall then be rounded to a radius of 3 millimeters by means of approved edging
 tools. The transverse edges of formed joints shall be rounded with an edging tool having a vertical leg of sufficient length
 to contact the vertical side of the preformed filler. The lateral edge adjacent to pavement already in place shall be rounded
 with an edging tool having a vertical leg 6 millimeters wide and slightly longer than that used on the first slab. Tool marks
 shall be eliminated.
 The finishing of the concrete at joints shall be done from a bridge which shall not rest on the concrete at any
 point. The finishers shall use a short straightedge not less than 1.25 meters in length when finishing transverse formed
 joints to insure that both slab ends will be at the same elevation or grade.
 F. Straightedge Testing and Surface Corrections.
 Following the longitudinal finishing operations all remaining irregularities shall be eliminated by use of scraping
 straightedges 3 meters in length, equipped with handles 600 millimeters longer than the width of one lane. Straightedges
 shall be made of redwood or aluminum. For wood the cross section shall be
 50 millimeters by 180 millimeters tapered from 180 millimeters depth at center to 100 millimeters depth at ends. For
 aluminum the preferred shape is the “T” section with bearing width of not more than 75 millimeters. For both metal and
 wood the approximate mass should be 13.5 to 16 kilograms for the 3 meter length exclusive of handle. The handle shall
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.103
 
 be attached to form an angle of about 10 degrees with the horizontal so as to present a cutting edge when in operation.
 The scraping straightedge shall be employed directly after the longitudinal finisher.
 The straightedge shall be placed on the form or edge of completed pavement nearest the operator. The handle
 shall be lowered to knee height and pushed transversely over the pavement surface. When it reaches the opposite form or
 center of full width paving, the handle shall be raised to shoulder height and the straightedge drawn back across the
 pavement in the same path. Additional passes shall be made if all irregularities are not removed by these two passes.
 Each pass shall be lapped one-half of the length of the straightedge as the work progresses. Any depressions found shall
 be immediately filled with freshly mixed concrete struck-off, consolidated, and refinished. High areas shall be cut down
 and refinished. Special attention shall be given to assure that the surface across joints meets the requirements for
 smoothness.
 Straightedge testing and surface corrections shall continue until the entire surface is found to be free from
 observable departures from the straightedge and the slab conforms to the required grade and cross section.
 Where a wood straightedge is used, the Contractor shall maintain a master straightedge on the job. Wood
 straightedges are required to be checked on the master straightedge twice a day, once in the morning before use and again
 at noon. Any variation from a true plane shall be corrected before further use.
 G. Final Finish.
 Following the scraping straightedges, the final surface texture shall be developed by use of a wet burlap strip
 dragged longitudinally over the pavement. The burlap shall be not less than 1 meter nor more than 2 meters wide without
 seams and the leading edge fastened to a wood pole for purpose of keeping burlap in proper position. The burlap shall be
 a minimum of 600 millimeters longer than the pavement width being dragged. At least 600 millimeters of the burlap drag
 shall be in contact with the surface when dragging the pavement. Generally, two such drags should be used so that the
 complete operation may be in a forward direction without backing up.
 The drags shall be cleaned of mortar when necessary so as to maintain uniform and satisfactory surface texture.
 Drags that cannot be cleaned shall be discarded and new drags substituted. When not in use, the drag shall be removed
 from the pavement surface.
 The surface of the concrete, after burlap drag operation, shall be uniform in appearance with a gritty texture, shall
 have the required grade and contour, shall be free from surplus water, rough and porous spots, irregularities, depressions
 and other objectionable surface features resulting from the improper handling of the tools. The entire operation shall be
 executed to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 Mechanically operated wire or plastic bristle brooms shall be used where specified to provide an adequate skid
 resistant surface.
 H. Edging at Forms and Joints.
 After the final finish has been completed, but before the concrete has taken its initial set, the edges of slabs along
 forms and at formed joints shall be carefully finished and tooled to form a smooth rounded surface of the radius required
 on the plans. Corners or edges of slabs which have crumbled and any areas which lack sufficient mortar for proper
 finishing shall be cleaned by removing all loose fragments and soupy mortar, and shall be solidly filled and finished with a
 mixture of correct proportions and appropriate consistence. Tool marks shall be eliminated and all edges shall be smooth
 and true to line.
 The surface of the slab shall not be unduly disturbed by tilting of the tool during use. All concrete on top of the
 joint filler shall be completely removed.
 476.68
 
 Joints.
 
 Joints shall be constructed of the types and dimensions and at the locations required by the plans, or
 specifications, or as directed by the Engineer. They shall be placed to a true alignment as shown on the plans or as
 directed. The sides of joints shall be protected during the curing period. Joint spaces shall be protected against infiltration
 of foreign materials before the time of sealing. All joints shall be sealed before the pavement is opened to any kind of
 traffic. Dowels, tie-bars and tie-bolts shall be prepared and placed across joints where indicated on the plans.
 If joints become adulterated with dirt, sand, gravel, or other foreign material during the construction period, they
 shall be reopened, cleaned and resealed prior to opening the job to traffic. This shall be done in conjunction with final
 clean-up. The Contractor shall provide sawing equipment adequate in number of units and power to complete the sawing
 with a water-cooled diamond edge saw blade or an abrasive wheel to the required dimensions and at the required rate, and
 he/she shall provide at least one standby saw in good working order. An ample supply of saw blades shall be maintained
 
 II.104
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 at the site of the work at all times during sawing operations. The Contractor shall provide adequate artificial lighting
 facilities for night sawing. All of this equipment shall be on the job both before and continuously during concrete
 placement.
 The Contractor shall submit for approval by the Engineer his/her proposed equipment for lighting and sawing
 prior to commencing work on the project.
 A. Longitudinal Joints.
 Longitudinal joints shall consist of construction joints between adjacent lanes and surface groove joints when the
 paving is placed more than one lane wide. They shall be located as shown on the plans or as directed.
 Deformed steel bars or tie-bolts of specified length, size, spacing and material shall be placed perpendicular to
 the longitudinal joints; they shall be placed by approved hand or mechanical methods or rigidly secured by chairs or other
 approved supports to prevent displacement. Tie-bars and tie-bolts shall not be painted or coated with asphalt or other
 material or enclosed in tubes or sleeves.
 When fixed-forms are used, tie-bolts shall be placed across longitudinal construction joints as shown on the plans
 or as directed. Tie-bolts shall be installed in two major parts to form an integral tie-bolt unit. Such device, as approved,
 shall result in proper installation as specified, and shall conform to all standard requirements specified herein for strength
 and design.
 Tie-bars in full width paving shall be of the size and length shown on the plans and placed at right angle to and
 across the locations of the longitudinal joint. The mid-point of the tie-bar shall be at the longitudinal joint. When
 supported above the fine grade before placing concrete, the tie-bars shall be at the mid-depth of the pavement. Tie-bars
 may be placed under the distributed reinforcement by approved hand or mechanical methods before the reinforcement is
 placed and before the top layer of concrete is placed. If placed under the distributed reinforcement, the tie-bars shall be
 not less than 70 millimeters nor more than
 120 millimeters below the finished pavement surface.
 Longitudinal construction joints shall extend for the full depth of the pavement, be perpendicular to the pavement
 surface and keyed and tied as shown on the plans. The upper edges of the slab shall be rounded as shown on the plans.
 The slab placed second shall be edged with a tool having a vertical leg 5 millimeters thick and longer than that used in the
 first slab. The joint shall be filled with sealing material.
 All honeycombed areas on the vertical faces of longitudinal joints shall be cleaned with a wire brush and
 thoroughly wetted and patched with mortar of the same composition as that used in the pavement.
 The faces of the concrete slabs at the longitudinal joints shall be painted with asphaltic material specified in
 Subsection 476.40 before the adjacent slab is placed against it.
 Longitudinal surface groove joints shall be constructed by sawing with an approved concrete saw to the depth,
 width and line shown on the plans. The width of the cut shall not be less than 5 millimeters and the depth shall not be less
 than one-fourth of the pavement thickness plus 5 millimeters. Suitable guide lines or devices shall be used to assure
 cutting the joint on the true line as shown on the plans. The joint shall be sawed before any equipment or vehicles are
 allowed on the pavement. If sawing is done before the end of the curing period, the faces of the joint shall be cured as
 provided for transverse sawed joints. The joints shall be filled with joint sealer compound as specified under Subsection
 476.40.
 Where there is more than one longitudinal joint, the cutting of this joint shall be done by tandem sawing, which
 saws shall be fixed to assure lines parallel and true, as shown on the plans.
 B. Transverse Expansion Joints.
 Transverse expansion joints shall be constructed where shown on the plans or directed by the Engineer. They
 shall consist of a preformed filler 20 millimeters thick (476.40), a top sealing cap of poured joint filler compound (476.40)
 and an approved load transfer assembly (476.40).
 The expansion joint filler shall be continuous from edge to edge shaped to the subgrade and to the keyway along
 the edge. It shall extend from the subgrade to 25 millimeters below the pavement surface.
 Preformed joint filler shall be furnished in lengths equal to the paving width or equal to the width of one lane.
 Where more than one section is used in a joint, the section shall be securely laced or clipped together. Damage or repaired
 joint filler shall not be used unless approved by the Engineer.
 A removable metal cap shall be placed over the top of the preformed joint during the concreting operations to
 maintain proper grade and alignment. Concrete shall be placed as specified and shall be carefully spaded against the joint
 filler. The metal cap shall be removed immediately after the final pass of the finishing machine. A suitable strip of the
 exact dimensions of the filler shall then be inserted in the joint as a guide and the concrete edged with a 3 millimeters

 II.105
 
 radius edging tool. The strip shall then be removed and any rough or torn places in the concrete shall be corrected.
 Particular care shall be taken to keep the concrete in exactly the same plane on the two sides of the joint. No
 plugs of concrete shall be permitted anywhere within the expansion space.
 C. Transverse Contraction Joints.
 These joints shall consist of planes of weakness created by sawing grooves in the surface of the pavement at the
 locations indicated on the plans.
 Approved load transfer assemblies shall be installed at each contraction joint as shown on the plans and in
 accordance with the Specifications.
 When approved by the Engineer, a vibrating bar may be used to move coarse aggregate off the line of the saw
 cut. The vibrating bar shall be used only in plastic concrete and so as not to produce areas of segregated mortar.
 The Contractor’s sawing equipment and method of sawing shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer. The
 timing and sawing and the order in which joints are sawed shall be subject to such control by the Engineer as in his/her
 judgment is necessary to protect the pavement from ravelling, spalling, cracking, or other damage. Normally, contraction
 joints will be sawed progressively with an approved circular saw at not less than 6 nor more than 24 hours after finishing.
 All joints shall be sawed before uncontrolled shrinkage cracking takes place. If necessary, the sawing operations shall be
 carried on both during the day and the night regardless of weather conditions.
 The pavement shall be cut for not less than 3 millimeters in width to a depth at least one-fourth of the pavement
 thickness.
 Secondary saw cuts shall be made as necessary so that the final joint width is at least 10 millimeters or as shown
 on the plans. In the event of excessive relief of the joint, care should be taken to secure this minimum opening.
 To control random cracking the Engineer may require that initial curing (for the first 24 hours) be done with wet
 burlap. The sawing of any joint shall be omitted if a crack occurs at or near the joint location prior to the time of sawing.
 Sawing shall be discontinued when a crack develops ahead of the saw. In general, all joints should be sawed in sequence.
 All contraction joints in lanes adjacent to previously constructed lanes shall be sawed before uncontrolled cracking
 occurs.
 D. Transverse Construction Joints.
 Transverse construction joints shall be placed at the end of each day’s work and when placing concrete will be
 interrupted for more than 30 minutes. No transverse construction joint shall be placed closer than
 5 meters to another transverse joint. If sufficient concrete has not been mixed at the time of interruption to form a slab at
 least 5 meters long, the excess concrete back to the last preceding joint shall be removed and disposed as directed.
 Substantial temporary wood or metal bulkheads shall be used to form construction joints. Particular care will be
 taken to provide a good riding joint and hand finishing shall be kept to a minimum. Poor riding joints will be corrected.
 When the construction joint is placed at a regular location of an expansion or contraction joint, a standard load
 transfer assembly will be used. When the construction joint is at other than the regular joint location, deformed bars will
 be used to create a bonded tie across the joint. Minimum tie steel shall be #25 metric round deformed bars, 1.2 meters
 long at 250 millimeters center to center.
 E. Load Transfer Devices.
 Dowels shall be held in position parallel to the surface and center line of the slab by a metal device meeting the
 requirements of Subsection 476.40 or shall be placed by an approved mechanical placing device.
 The sub-base at the locations where expansion, contraction, and construction joint load transfer assemblies are to
 be installed shall be trimmed accurately to the required cross section and depth of pavement. Where used, the complete
 joint assembly shall be carefully placed. If the sub-base is trimmed too low or if there are any open spaces beneath the
 preformed joint filler, the joint assembly shall be removed, the sub-base correctly graded and tamped, and the joint
 assembly reset.
 One-half the length of each slip-dowel bar of load transfer units shall be rendered bondless with a coat of either a
 graphite lubricant or a wax base grease meeting the requirements of Subsection M8.14.0. The graphite lubricant shall be
 applied by daubing, mopping or gloved hand to produce a thorough coating approximately 2 millimeters thick. Brushes
 shall not be used for the application of the graphite lubricant.
 The wax base grease shall be pre-heated to temperatures of 75 °C to 90 °C and applied either by dipping or by
 brush to produce a coating approximately 2 millimeters thick.
 Dowels shall be coated at least one hour before the concrete is placed around the dowel assembly.
 The assembly shall be held in the required position at line and grade by metal stakes or pins throughout the
 operation of placing and striking-off the concrete. No concrete shall be placed unless the methods and devices used by
 
 II.106
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 the Contractor for installing and securing the joint assembly, including any joint filler required, and finishing the joint
 meet with the approval of the Engineer. Immediately prior to depositing the concrete, the position of dowels shall be
 checked and the assemblies tightened if necessary. The installation of dowel assemblies and the placement of the
 surrounding concrete shall result in dowels tightly enclosed in concrete and parallel to both the pavement surface and
 center line at plan locations. In lieu of using dowel assemblies at contraction joints, dowel bars may be placed in the
 plastic concrete by a mechanical device approved by the Engineer.
 476.69
 
 Numbering Slabs.
 
 The pavement slabs shall be numbered consecutively as the work progresses, and the last slab placed each day
 shall be stamped with the date. The marking shall be on the right hand corner at the beginning of each slab, and so placed
 that it can be read traveling in the direction the pavement was laid. The figures and letters shall be 40 millimeters high and
 plainly and neatly stamped after the final finish of the concrete as directed. When two or more paver mixers are working,
 the distinguishing letter for each mixer shall be stamped adjacent to the number.
 476.70
 
 Surface Test.
 
 The entire surface shall be checked while the concrete is still plastic with an approved metal straightedge 3
 meters in length, and any deviation from the general surface shall be corrected at once. The surface shall be checked again
 immediately after the removal of the burlap where an initial burlap covering is used, or at the end of 72 hours where 72
 hour covering is used. The straightedge shall be placed at several points across the pavement parallel to the centerline and
 shall be advanced in 1.5 meter steps. Areas showing high spots of more than 3 millimeters but not exceeding 10
 millimeters in 3 meters shall be marked and immediately ground or rubbed down with an approved tool to an elevation
 where the area or spot will not show surface deviations in excess of 3 millimeters when tested with a 3 meter straightedge.
 This grinding or rubbing shall be conducted carefully so as to avoid loosening coarse aggregate or otherwise damaging
 the slab.
 Where the departure from correct cross section exceeds 10 millimeters, the pavement shall be removed and
 replaced by and at the expense of the Contractor.
 Any area or section so removed shall be not less than 5 meters in length nor less than the full width of the lane
 involved. When it is necessary to remove and replace a section of pavement, any remaining portion of the slab adjacent to
 the joints that is less than 5 meters in length shall also be removed and replaced.
 476.71
 
 Curing.
 
 Immediately after the finishing operations have been completed and as soon as marring of the concrete will not
 occur, the entire surface of the newly placed concrete shall be covered and cured in accordance with one of the following
 methods. In all cases in which curing requires the use of water, the curing shall have prior rights to all water supply or
 supplies. Failure to provide sufficient cover material of whatever kind the Contractor may elect to use, or a lack of water
 adequate to take care of both curing and other requirements, shall be cause for immediate suspension of concreting
 operations. The concrete shall not be left exposed for more than 1/2 hour between stages of curing or during the curing
 period. Whenever fixed-forms are not used, exceptional care shall be taken in the use of paper or burlap to prevent any
 damage to the unsupported edges of the pavement. The curing media shall be applied at the appropriate time and shall be
 applied uniformly and completely to all surfaces and edges of the pavement.
 A. Moist Curing.
 Initial Curing – Strips of burlap saturated with water shall be placed on the fresh concrete surface carefully so as
 to avoid marring, and the strips shall overlap not less than 75 millimeters. This burlap shall be kept thoroughly and
 continuously wet by sprinkling it with a fine spray of water until it is removed. Initial curing with wet burlap shall be for a
 period of not less than 24 hours. Burlap which has been used for any purpose other than curing concrete shall not be used.
 Final Curing – Following completion of initial curing the curing shall be continued using an additional layer of
 burlap or cotton mats. This double layer shall remain in place and shall be kept thoroughly and continuously saturated
 with water for a period of not less than 5 days.
 Cotton mats may be used for final curing if approved by the Engineer. Such covering shall be as effective in
 preventing evaporation of mixing water and controlling variance in temperature of the concrete as the two thicknesses of
 wet burlap. If cotton mats are used for final curing, the burlap shall be removed in such a manner that not more than 18
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.107
 
 meters of pavement is exposed at one time, followed at once by application of cotton mats.
 B. Waterproof Paper Curing.
 The top surface and sides of the pavement shall be entirely covered with waterproof paper. Each paper cover
 shall be not less than 6 meters or more than 20 meters in length, and shall be of such width that, when in place, it will
 extend to at least 500 millimeters beyond the edges of the slab to be covered.
 Paper covers may be furnished in widths corresponding to that of the slab provided supplemental stringer sheets,
 at least 500 millimeters wide are used, in which case such sheets shall be placed along the edge of the slab under the paper
 covers. On removal of forms the paper shall be brought down over the slab side and held with a continuous bank of earth.
 The junctions between the paper covers shall be lapped approximately 300 millimeters and held in place with a bank of
 earth.
 All rips or holes occurring in the paper covers while in use shall be immediately repaired with a sealed patch to
 render them airtight. Covers which have become damaged or soiled to the extent that they will not provide satisfactory
 curing or will mar the concrete shall not be used.
 The paper shall be left in place for a period of 72 hours or longer, if necessary to obtain the required strength.
 The surface of the pavement shall be moist when the paper is placed.
 C. Impervious Membrane Curing.
 After finishing operations have been completed, and immediately after the free water has left the surface, the
 surface of the slab shall be completely coated and sealed with a uniform layer of white pigmented curing compound. The
 compound shall be applied in a 2-coat continuous operation and at a total coverage of not less than 0.3 liters per square
 meter of surface.
 The compound shall be applied by means of a mechanical pressure sprayer mounted on a self-propelled carriage.
 The compound shall form a uniform, continuous, coherent film that shall not check, crack or peel and shall be free from
 pin holes, or other imperfections. If discontinuities, pin holes or abrasion exist, an additional coat shall be applied within
 30 minutes to the affected areas. The equipment shall provide adequate stirring of the compound during application.
 Also, wind protection to the spray fog shall be provided by an adequate shield when the compound is applied to the
 pavement. The equipment for applying the compound shall be approved by the Engineer before work is started. Should
 the method of applying the compound not produce a uniform film, its use shall be discontinued and the curing shall be
 done by one of the other approved methods specified herein.
 The curing compound shall be of such character that the film will harden within 30 minutes after application.
 Should the film become damaged from any cause within the required curing period, the damaged portions shall be
 repaired immediately with additional compound.
 Liquid membrane material shall not be placed on the faces of joints. Immediately after the contraction joints are
 sawed, they shall be protected and moist-cured with strips of waterproof paper or plastic. Ropes made of jute or cotton
 may also be used. The method used shall insure proper curing of the portion of the slab adjacent to the joints.
 Immediately after the forms are removed, the entire area of the sides of the slab shall be coated with the curing
 compound at the rate specified for the pavement surface. This spraying shall be a continuous process, and waiting until all
 forms have been removed before making the application will not be permitted. Handspray equipment will be permitted
 for the application of the curing compound over the sides of the slab. Care shall be used to prevent coating the ends of
 sawed contraction joints. If hair checking develops before the curing compound can be applied, the concrete shall be
 moist-cured for at least 24 hours before applying any membrane curing compound. If rain falls on the newly coated
 pavement before the film has dried sufficiently to resist damage, or if the film is damaged in any other way, the Contractor
 will be required to apply a new coat of material to the affected areas, equal to that specified for the original coat. The
 treated surface shall be protected by the Contractor from injury for a period of at least 3 days. All traffic, foot or
 otherwise, will be considered injurious to the film of the applied compound. A minimum of foot traffic will be permitted
 on the dried film as necessary to carry on the work properly, provided any damage to the film is immediately repaired by
 the application of an additional coat of compound.
 D. White Polyethylene Sheeting.
 The general requirements for the use of white polyethylene sheets shall be those for waterproof paper curing in
 Subsection 476.71B.
 E. Curing in Cold Weather.
 During cold weather, when the air temperature may be expected to drop below 5 °C, a sufficient supply of loose
 dry hay or straw or other suitable blanketing material for covering shall be provided along the line of the work, and at any
 time when the air temperature may be expected to reach the freezing point during the day or night, the material so
 
 II.108
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 provided shall be spread to a sufficient depth to prevent freezing of the concrete. The period of time such protection shall
 be maintained shall be not less than 5 days or until the concrete has hardened thoroughly. The use of such hay or straw
 does not take the place of the burlap or other covering specified herein, but shall be applied in addition to the covering.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for the quality and strength of the concrete placed during cold weather, and any
 concrete injured by frost action shall be removed and replaced at the Contractor’s expense.
 476.72
 
 Removing Forms.
 
 Forms shall not be removed for 12 hours after the concrete has been placed, or for a longer period if directed.
 Extreme care shall be taken in removing forms in order that no damage will be done to the concrete. Under no condition
 shall any bar, pick, or other tool be used which depends upon leverage on the concrete, for removal of the pins or forms.
 As soon as side forms are removed and prior to sealing joints, the ends of all joints shall be opened and all mortar
 or foreign material shall be removed from the joint opening above the filler or other space as provided so that there will be
 complete freedom for required movement of the joint. After the forms have been removed, the side of the slab shall be
 cured as outlined in one of the methods indicated previously.
 All holes or honeycomb shall be patched promptly with mortar, of the same composition as that used in the
 pavement, which has been allowed to set for about one-half hour after mixing. Major honeycombed areas will be
 considered as defective work and shall be removed and replaced. Any area or section so removed shall not be less than 5
 meters in length nor less than full width of the lane involved. When it is necessary to remove and replace a section of
 pavement, any remaining portion of the slab adjacent to the joints that is less than
 5 meters in length shall also be removed and replaced.
 476.73
 
 Sealing Joints.
 
 Joints shall be sealed after curing and before any kind of traffic is permitted on the pavement.
 The sealing of joints shall be undertaken only when the atmospheric temperature is above 5 °C, and when the
 weather is not foggy or rainy.
 Just prior to sealing, each joint shall be thoroughly cleaned of all foreign material, including curing compound,
 by means of a mechanical, power-operated concrete grooving machine or a power wire brush. The concrete grooving
 machine or wire brush shall be operated in such a manner that the vertical faces of the concrete in the joint opening will
 present thoroughly clean concrete surfaces for application of the joint sealing compound. Following this operation, each
 joint shall then be further cleaned by means of a powerful jet of compressed air.
 No joints shall be filled when there is any free water in or adjacent to the joints. Joint walls and all surfaces to
 which the sealing compound is to be applied shall be surface dry for at least 3 hours prior to placing. No joints shall be
 sealed until the joints have been approved by the Engineer as being clean and dry in accordance with the foregoing
 provisions.
 Joints shall be sealed with an approved joint sealing compound conforming to Federal Specifications for Sealer,
 Hot-Poured Type for Joints in Concrete (SS-S-164), or an approved elastic open-cell compression seal (M9.14.3).
 The melting devices used for heating the joint sealing material shall be of the double boiler, indirect heating type
 using high flash oil for heat transfer. Constant mechanical agitation during the entire melting period shall be provided and
 no material shall be subjected for more than 60 minutes to the high temperature required for melting of the material.
 Positive temperature control (preferably by thermostat) of the heating medium of the sealing compound shall be provided
 at all times.
 Hot-poured sealing compound shall not be subjected to temperatures in excess of 230 °C at any stage of the
 melting operation. Sealing material that has remained in the kettle in a molten state overnight will not be acceptable for
 use.
 Hot-poured filler for use in sealing all joints, except expansion joints, shall be applied under pressure. When hotpoured filler is applied under pressure, the material shall be applied by means of a heavy duty air operated pump, or other
 approved device. The material shall be discharged through a suitable nozzle in such a way as to fill the joint opening solid
 and uniformly in a neat and workmanlike manner.
 When the atmospheric temperature at the time of sealing is below 10 °C, the surface of the sealing compound in
 the finished joint shall be not less than 5 millimeters below the level of the pavement surface.
 The sealing shall be done in such a manner that the material will not be spilled on the exposed surfaces of the
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.109
 
 concrete. Any excess material on the surface of the concrete pavement shall be removed immediately and the pavement
 surface cleaned.
 In the event paving and construction operations must close down in the Fall because of cold weather and the
 contract cannot be completed until the following year, the Engineer shall require the Contractor to clean and seal all joints
 in the part of the pavement completed at the time of the shut-down, in the manner prescribed in this Specification. Under
 no circumstances shall any joint remain unsealed between the period of shut-down in the Fall and resumption of
 construction in the Spring.
 476.74
 
 Protection of Pavement.
 
 The Contractor shall erect and maintain suitable barricades and employ watchmen to exclude traffic from the
 newly constructed pavement for the period herein prescribed. These barriers shall be so arranged as not in any way to
 interfere with or impede public traffic on any lane intended to be kept open. Necessary signs shall be maintained by the
 Contractor clearly indicating the open lanes to the public. When it is necessary to provide for traffic across the pavement,
 the Contractor shall construct at his/her entire expense, immediately after the finishing of the concrete, the necessary
 bridges over the pavement clear of the forms and at least
 75 millimeters clear of the concrete and sufficiently strong to carry the traffic. The Contractor shall maintain these bridges
 until the concrete has attained the strength required in these Specifications for opening to traffic.
 Prior approval shall be obtained from the Engineer for crossing of existing structures with the paving train.
 When fixed-forms are not used, the Contractor shall be required to have available at all times, materials for the
 protection of the edges and surface of the unhardened concrete in order that the concrete may be properly protected
 against the effects of rain before the concrete is sufficiently hardened. Such protective materials shall consist of standard
 metal forms or wood planks having a nominal thickness of not less than
 50 millimeters and a nominal width of not less than the thickness of the pavement at its edge for the protection of the
 pavement edges, and covering material such as burlap or cotton mats, curing paper, or plastic sheeting material for the
 protection of the surface of the pavement.
 An adequate quantity of the materials described above shall be available, loaded on vehicles which can be
 promptly driven or towed to the scene of paving operations and be located not more than one kilometer from the place
 where the paving operations are in progress.
 When rain appears imminent, all paving operations shall stop and all available personnel shall begin placing
 forms against the sides of the pavement and covering the surface of the unhardened concrete with the protective covering.
 The Contractor shall have on hand at the paving site sufficient burlap or paper to cover at least
 600 square meters of freshly laid pavement as a protection against sudden thunder showers or heavy downpours of rain.
 Any part of the pavement damaged by traffic or other causes occurring prior to its final acceptance shall be
 repaired or replaced by and at the expense of the Contractor in a manner satisfactory to the Engineer. The Contractor shall
 protect the pavement against both public traffic and the traffic caused by his/her own employees and agents. The
 pavement shall be so protected until the beam test shows a strength of at least
 3.8 megaPascals.
 476.75
 
 Opening to Traffic.
 
 Upon completion of curing operations as specified, the pavement may be opened to traffic provided that beam
 tests show that the concrete has attained a modulus of rupture of at least 3.8 megaPascals. However, curing operations
 will not be considered completed unless a curing period of at least 7 days has elapsed since the concrete was placed.
 Where high-early strength concrete is used, the pavement may be opened to traffic after a shorter period of
 curing or as beam tests show that the concrete has attained a modulus of rupture of at least
 3.8 megaPascals.
 476.76
 
 Test Specimens.
 
 Test specimens shall conform to the requirements of Subsection M4.02.13. They will be taken in the field from
 batches used in the pavement to determine the adequacy of control of the materials, the proportioning and mixing of the
 concrete and compliance with the minimum strength requirements. Test beams shall be
 150 millimeters x 150 millimeters x 900 millimeters in length and shall be made, cured, and used in accordance with
 
 II.110
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 AASHTO Designations T 23 and T 97. At least two beams shall be made for each 1500 square meters or fraction thereof
 of pavement placed.
 Payment for the forms, material and assistance as the Engineer may require to make, cure and test the field
 specimens will not be paid for directly but shall be included in the contract unit price for the pavement.
 476.77
 
 Tolerance in Pavement Thickness.
 
 It is the intent of these Specifications that the pavement shall be constructed in accordance with the thickness
 shown on the plans. Before final acceptance of the work or during the progress of the work, as may be advisable or
 necessary, the thickness or depth of concrete pavement will be determined by cores taken by the Contractor under the
 direction of the Engineer or his/her designee, and unsatisfactory work shall be repaired, replaced, or will be paid for at an
 adjusted unit price. Where any pavement is found deficient in thickness, the following rules relative to replacement of the
 faulty pavement and adjustment of unit price shall govern.
 The thickness of the pavement will be determined by average caliper measurement of cores tested in accordance
 with AASHTO Designation T 48.
 For the purpose of establishing an adjusted unit price for pavement, units to be considered separately are defined
 as not more than 300 meters of pavement in each traffic lane starting at the end of the pavement bearing the smaller station
 number. A traffic lane is defined as being between longitudinal joints or between a longitudinal joint and a pavement
 edge. The last unit in each lane shall be 300 meters plus the fractional part of 300 meters remaining.
 One core will be taken at random in each unit by the Contractor.
 When the measurement of the core from a unit is not deficient by more than 5 millimeters from the plan
 thickness, the pavement in the unit represented will be paid for at full unit price.
 When such measurement is deficient by more than 5 millimeters but less than 10 millimeters, two additional
 cores at intervals of not less than 100 meters will be taken. The thickness of the unit will be considered to be the average
 of the three cores provided none is deficient by 10 millimeters or more. Payment for the pavement in the unit will be at an
 adjusted unit price as provided in Subsection 476.81.
 In calculating the average thickness of the pavement, measurements in excess of the specified thickness will be
 considered as the specified thickness. Measurements which are less than the specified thickness by 10 millimeters or more
 will not be included in the average.
 When any core is deficient by 10 millimeters or more, additional cores will be taken at 7.5 meter intervals in each
 direction until a core is found in each direction that is deficient by less than 10 millimeters. Each such exploratory core
 will represent the depth of 7.5 meters of pavement one traffic lane in width. The pavement so represented will be
 deducted from the unit of pavement being measured and the remaining area cored and measured as described previously.
 Pavement deficient by 10 millimeters or more but less than 20 millimeters may be accepted by the Engineer at no
 payment to the Contractor. However, the Contractor may, at his/her own expense, remove and replace the pavement,
 which will then be cored and measured for payment as herein provided.
 Pavement deficient by 20 millimeters or more shall be removed and replaced by the Contractor at his/her own
 expense. Payment for such replaced pavement will be as provided herein.
 Other areas such as intersections, entrances, crossovers, ramps, etc., will be considered as one unit and the
 thickness of each unit will be determined separately. Small irregular unit areas may be included as part of another unit. At
 such points as the Engineer may select in each unit, one core will be taken for each
 1500 square meters of pavement, or fraction thereof, in the unit. Thickness of each unit will be determined as described
 previously except that when additional cores in any unit are required, they will be taken at locations as directed by the
 Engineer.
 COMPENSATION
 476.80
 
 Method of Measurement.
 
 Cement concrete pavement will be measured by the square meter and the quantity paid for shall be the number of
 square meters as determined by the actual area of the finished pavement, complete in place and accepted, but subject to
 adjusted proportional payment or non-payment as stated in Subsection 476.81 for all pavement areas found deficient in
 depth.
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.111
 
 The width for measurement of the pavement shall be as shown on the typical cross sections, including additional
 widening where called for, or as otherwise directed in writing by the Engineer. The length will be measured horizontally
 along the center line of each roadway or ramp.
 476.81
 
 Basis of Payment.
 
 Standard cement concrete pavement will be paid for at the contract unit price per square meter complete in place
 subject to price adjustments as set forth below. No additional payment over the contract unit price will be made for any
 pavement having an average thickness in excess of that shown on the plans. Average thickness shall be calculated as
 stated in Subsection 476.77. Where the average thickness of pavement is deficient in thickness by more than 5
 millimeters, but less than 10 millimeters, payment will be made as follows:
 CONCRETE PAVEMENT DEFICIENCY
 Deficiency in Thickness, Determined by Cores
 
 Proportional Part of Contract
 Prices Allowed
 
 5 millimeters or less ....................................................................................................................... 100 percent
 More than 5 millimeters, but less than 10 millimeters..................................................................... 80 percent
 10 millimeters or more, but less than 15 millimeters....................................................................... 70 percent
 Where core measurements indicate that the pavement is deficient in thickness by 10 millimeters but less than 20
 millimeters the pavement may be accepted without any payment being made to the Contractor, or it may be replaced at the
 option of the Contractor with pavement of the specified thickness at his/her entire expense. If the deficiency in thickness
 is 20 millimeters or more, the Contractor shall be required to remove such deficient areas and replace them with cement
 concrete pavement conforming with all requirements of these Specifications and to the thickness shown on the plans.
 Such areas when accepted will then be duly included in the square meters for which payment shall be made at the contract
 unit price. The Contractor shall receive no compensation for materials or labor involved in removing and replacing
 deficient areas.
 When high early strength concrete is specified at the direction of the Engineer, in order to expedite the opening
 of pavement to traffic, the high early strength will be obtained by means of an increase in the cement factor and a
 reduction of the water-cement ratio. The extra cement will be paid for at the actual unit cost per kilogram to the
 Contractor for the extra quantity of cement actually incorporated in the pavement, plus an allowance of 5% of the cost per
 kilogram, which cost shall include all equipment, labor storage, transportation and work incidental to its inclusion in the
 concrete and incorporation in the finished pavement.

 having a thickness of 10 millimeters. When curb is constructed adjacent to or on concrete pavement, expansion joints
 shall be located opposite or at expansion joints in the pavement.
 B. Mixing and Placing Concrete.
 The concrete shall be of such consistency and be so spaded and worked that a smooth mortar face will be
 produced.
 C. Protection, Curing and Finishing Concrete.
 1. Protection. The forms shall be left in place for 24 hours or as directed until the concrete has set
 sufficiently so that they can be removed without injury to the castings. Particular care will be required to prevent any
 discoloration of the exposed surface.
 2. Curing.
 When the concrete has hardened sufficiently the concrete shall be covered with acceptable
 burlap or other approved material and kept wet for 3 days or longer. Under extreme weather or other particular conditions
 proper curing shall be carried out as directed.

 compensation.
 501.65
 
 Filling About Trench.
 
 After the curb, curb corners, curb inlets, and edging is set, the space between it and the wall of the trench shall be
 filled with gravel thoroughly tamped to the depth directed, care being taken not to affect the line or grade of the curb, curb
 corners, curb inlets and edging.
 501.66
 
 Bridge Curb.
 
 On bridges, after the concrete base has set and before the concrete in back of the curb is placed, Type VA5 curb
 shall be set to line and grade in full mortar beds and full mortar end joints with the anchors in the stone grouted in place.
 Each curb shall be brushed clean and free of loose particles, and thoroughly wetted with clean, fresh water before
 setting. The stone shall be carefully bedded in a full bed of mortar and in such a way as not to slide the stone on the
 mortar bed.
 Each stone shall be held securely in position by 2 steel anchors. The anchors shall be of the required dimensions
 and shapes and shall extend 75 millimeters into the curb and 150 millimeters into the concrete. Care shall be taken in
 placing the concrete in back of the curb to avoid disturbing the line or grade of the curb.
 Wherever plans indicate a construction joint in the sidewalk, or paraffin joint in coping, the curb shall be laid out
 so that a joint in the curb will be opposite the joint in the sidewalk, or coping.

 Seeding Grass.
 
 After the loamed or topsoil areas have been prepared and treated as hereinbefore described, grass seed
 conforming to the respective formulas hereinbefore specified shall be carefully sown thereon at the rate of approximately
 0.55 kilograms per 100 square meters. Seeding shall be done in two directions at right angles to each other. Seeding on
 level areas and on slopes up to and including 1:4 (1 vertical to 4 horizontal) slopes shall be done by means of an approved
 seeder that will seed and roll in one operation. On shoulders and other narrow areas, the seeding may be done
 longitudinally in one application.
 765.65
 
 Seeding Grass by Spray Machine.
 
 A hydraulic spray machine, approved by the Engineer, and designed specifically for seed dissemination may be
 utilized. The application of limestone as necessary, fertilizer and grass seed may be accomplished in one operation by the
 use of an approved spraying machine. The materials shall be mixed with water in the machine and kept in an agitated state
 in order that the materials may be uniformly suspended in the water. The spraying equipment shall be so designed that
 when the solution is sprayed over an area the resulting deposits of limestone, fertilizer and grass seed shall be equal in
 quantity to those quantities specified above in Subsections 765.61, 765.62 and 765.63.
 A certified statement shall be furnished, prior to start of work, to the Engineer by the Contractor as to the number
 of kilograms of limestone, fertilizer, and grass seed, per 100 liters of water.
 This statement should also specify the number of square meters of seeding that can be covered with the solution
 specified above.
 If the results of the spray operation are unsatisfactory, the Contractor will be required to abandon this method and
 to apply the limestone, fertilizer and seed in accordance with the requirements of Subsections 765.61, 765.62 and 765.63.
 765.66
 
 Care During Construction.
 
 The Contractor shall be responsible for the watering of all seeded and grassed areas which shall be kept moist.
 The Engineer’s decision will prevail in the event a dispute develops with the Contractor as to whether or not the seeded
 and grassed areas are moist. Seeded areas on which growth has started shall be watered to a minimum depth of 50
 millimeters to assure continuing growth. Watering shall be done in a manner which will provide uniform coverage,
 prevent erosion due to application of excessive quantities over small areas, and prevent damage to the finished surface by
 the watering equipment. The Contractor shall furnish sufficient watering equipment to apply one complete coverage to the
 seeded areas in an 8 hour period.

 150 millimeters. The sod shall be settled by watering it and by tamping on a board laid over it.
 When the sods are to be placed in temporary storage piles, and they are in the form of separate flat slabs instead
 of folds or rolls, they shall be placed in layers so that the grassy side of the first or bottom layer shall be uppermost,
 whereas in the next succeeding layer the roots shall be uppermost, and so on in such a manner as to place the grass or roots
 of each succeeding layer in immediate contact with the corresponding surface of the preceding layer, in order to avoid
 rapid growth of the grass while in storage. The piles shall be sprinkled with water and covered with burlap, straw or other
 acceptable material which shall be kept moist when required and as directed. As a rule, temporary storage will not be
 permitted for a period longer than
 5 days. The sod shall not be stored in such a manner to compress the thickness of sod below the minimum required.
 Collected natural growth sod as specified in Subsection M6.05.0 shall be placed in an excavation in the existing
 ground to the depth of the sod and shall be placed in either a staggered pattern or in strips as directed. If the staggered
 pattern is used, sods shall be placed not over 1 meter apart. If strips are used, they shall run approximately parallel with
 the roadway and not over 3 meters apart. Loam shall not be used in laying natural growth sod. Mulch shall be carefully
 replaced around sods placed in premulched areas.
 Care shall be taken that the collected sods shall be firmly embedded in the natural soil. A hole shall be excavated
 in the slope beneath the mulch to the depth and width of the sod and the sod placed therein. Soil and mulch shall then be
 placed and compacted around the sod. In all cases, the mulch must be parted at each planting location prior to planting
 and then satisfactorily replaced immediately following the planting. Collected natural growth sod shall be placed within
 one day after arrival on the project. Sods which have been stored beyond this time limit and sods which have become
 dried out or broken prior to placement in final position on the designated areas shall be rejected by the Engineer.
 770.62
 
 Fastening Sod to Slopes.
 
 On slopes steeper than 1:3 (1 vertical to 3 horizontal), lawn and field sod shall be held securely in place by
 fastening alternate lines of sod with wooden pegs. The pegs shall be not less than 300 millimeters in length, and they shall
 be spaced 1 meter apart and driven flush with the surface of the sod. Other approved methods of fastening sod to slopes
 may be used where pegging is not practicable.
 770.63
 
 Surface Dressing of Lawn and Field Sodding.
 
 When the sod has been set in final position, loam shall be used to fill the joints and as a surface dressing to cover
 the sodded areas to a depth of about 6 millimeters. A grass seed mixture conforming to the specifications stated in
 Subsection M6.03.0 for Slopes and Shoulders shall be mixed with clean, dry sand or dry sandy loam and sown upon the
 loam surface dressing at the rate of 0.25 kilograms per 100 square meters. The sodded areas shall then be compacted, and
 the compaction shall be equivalent to that produced by hand roller with a mass of between 110 and 150 kilograms per
 meter of width and to produce a smooth, uniform surface.
 Natural growth sod should be pruned after planting. All woody plants such as sweet fern, sheep laurel and
 blueberry shall be pruned 50% of their top growth.
 770.64
 
 Maintenance and Care.
 
 The Contractor shall be responsible for any necessary watering of sodded areas.
 If necessary, suitable signs and barricades of brush or other material shall be placed to protect the sodded areas.
 Before acceptance of the work, a satisfactory uniform stand of grass will be required. (See Subsection 765.66.)
 The Contractor shall maintain all of the sodded areas until the work has been officially accepted, without
 compensation in addition to the amount regularly to be paid under this item, as hereinafter provided. Maintenance shall
 include all reseeding or resodding which may be necessary, as determined by the Engineer.

 CONSTRUCTION METHODS
 771.60
 
 General.
 
 Balled and burlapped plants may be planted in the spring until June 15 and in the fall from August 15 to
 November 1.
 Container grown plants may be planted at any time the ground is not frozen (provided specified minimum time of
 growth and root development have been met).
 Bare rooted plants shall be planted only from the time ground thaws in spring until May 15.
 771.61
 
 Turf Removal.
 
 In areas of mass shrub planting where there is an established turf the Contractor will be required to excavate the
 sod, as indicated on the plans or as directed by the Engineer, to a depth sufficient to remove the root system
 (approximately 100 millimeters).
 The shape and dimensions of the areas to be so treated shall be determined in the field by the Engineer.
 It shall be the Contractor’s responsibility to dispose of all material removed in a manner satisfactory to the
 Engineer.
 771.62
 
 Excavation of Planting Pits.
 
 The dimensions of the planting pits for bare rooted or balled and burlapped plants shall be as follows:
 A. Trees more than 1.2 meters high
 Diameter at least 600 millimeters larger than the diameter of the ball or root spread; depth at least
 300 millimeters greater than the depth of the ball or root system.
 B. Trees 1.2 meters high or less
 Least dimension 600 millimeters.
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.167
 
 C. Shrubs
 Least dimension 600 millimeters.
 D. Roses, Vines and Ground Cover
 Least dimension 300 millimeters.
 The shape of the pits may vary from square to round with the approval of the Engineer. In all cases the least
 dimension of the pit shall be sufficient to easily accommodate the root system without crowding. The excavated material
 shall be disposed of as directed.
 771.63
 
 Planting Bare Rooted Plants (Except Seedlings).
 
 The backfill mixture of soil placed beneath the plant shall be firmed prior to setting the plant.
 The plant shall be set in the planting pit at a depth within 25 millimeters below the depth at which it was
 previously growing. The root system shall be carefully spread and the pit partially backfilled, making sure that the soil
 filters in among the roots. The backfill shall be formed with care taken not to injure or bruise the roots.
 When the pit is between 2/3 and 3/4 full it shall be puddled to eliminate air pockets and settle the soil. After the
 water has percolated into the soil, the rest of the pit shall be filled in. A mound shall be formed around the edge of the pit
 to form a shallow saucer to aid watering. The pit area shall then be puddled again and any depressions occurring as a
 result filled in with the backfill mixture. The plant shall be woodchip mulched, after watering, to a depth of 100
 millimeters as provided in Subsection 771.71.
 771.64
 
 Planting Balled and Burlapped Plants.
 
 The plant shall be set in the planting pit at a depth within 25 millimeters below the depth at which it was
 previously growing. The burlap shall then be untied, loosened and spread away from the ball. Any excess burlap shall be
 cut away and disposed of as directed. Roots that have been wrapped around the ball shall be made to lay in as natural a
 manner as possible. Backfill shall then be placed around the ball and firmed.
 The planting procedure shall also include that as specified in the first and third paragraphs of Subsection 771.63,
 entitled Planting Bare Rooted Plants (except Seedlings).
 771.65
 
 Planting Container Grown Plants.
 
 The plant shall be placed in a hole that is 150 millimeters larger than the diameter of the container and the
 surface of the soil of the container shall be level with the surrounding ground. Any part of a plantable container projecting
 above the level of the soil shall be removed. All metal, plastic or other non root-thru type container shall be completely
 removed during the process of planting. The part of the hole outside the container shall be backfilled with the excavated
 soil and thoroughly firmed and puddled with water to eliminate air pockets. A mound of soil shall be formed on the
 ground around the container to form a shallow saucer to aid watering. On steep slopes, the mound around the saucer may
 be omitted on the uphill side. The plant shall be woodchip mulched, after watering, to a depth of 100 millimeters as
 provided in Subsection 771.71.
 771.66
 
 Planting Bare Root Seedlings.
 
 Bare root seedlings of the variety indicated on the plan shall be planted by opening a wedge-shaped hole in the
 slope of a sufficient size to take the seedling’s roots that are to be directed downward and without kinks. The seedling
 shall be placed at a depth in the hole approximately 25 millimeters below its previously planted depth. The planting hole
 shall be closed by making a second wedge-shaped hole about 50 millimeters from the first in order to force the first closed,
 which then shall be closed and compressed with the heel.
 Bare root seedlings shall be given a liquid mud bath prior to planting.
 For seedlings to be planted on grass covered slopes, it will require removal of the sod on a
 300 millimeter square area for a maximum depth of 50 millimeters at each seedling location prior to planting.
 Seedlings must be delivered to the project in a dormant condition. If there is any evidence that growth has
 started, the entire load or lot will be rejected.
 Evergreens will be rejected if the fine roots were lost in digging.

 These trees shall be supported by one stake driven firmly 600 millimeters to 1 meter into the ground. The stake
 shall be located far enough from the tree to avoid damaging the roots and so that the top of the stake shall be about 2/3 the
 height of the tree. The point of attachment to the stake shall not be more than
 150 millimeters from the trunk. If the stake must angle toward the tree, it shall be driven at such an angle to cross the
 trunk and shall extend about 100 millimeters past the trunk.
 Secure the tree to the stake with 2.7 millimeters in diameter hose-covered wire twisted to provide tension. The
 length of the hose shall be 200 millimeters.
 Type I(b)
 Trees higher than type 1(a) and less than 75 millimeters caliper
 These trees shall be supported with two (2) stakes on opposite sides and driven into the ground at least
 600 millimeters. The stakes shall be cut off at a height in aesthetic proportion to the height of the tree. The stake shall not
 be higher than three fourths (3/4) the height of the tree. Secure the tree to stakes with
 2.7 millimeters in diameter wire with hose and twist the wire to provide tension. The length of the hose shall be 200
 millimeters.
 Type II
 Trees 75 millimeters to 100 millimeters caliper
 These trees shall be securely guyed by wire, protective material and anchors. Three guys shall be equally spaced
 around the tree. Each guy shall be fastened around the tree trunk immediately above a substantial limb located 1/2 to 2/3
 of the tree height above the ground and anchored at a distance from the trunk equal to 2/3 of the height of attachment to
 the tree. The anchor shall be a hardwood stake. The anchor stake shall be firmly driven at an angle and to a depth of at
 least 375 millimeters and the excess length of stake shall be cut off 75 millimeters above the ground.
 The guy wire with protective hose shall be placed around the tree trunk, secured at the hose by a single twist,
 extended with both wires to the anchor stake and securely fastened with enough slack in the guy to permit ten to twenty
 twists for tensioning. After installation of all guys, the wires shall be twisted by a lever in the same direction as previous
 twists to provide tension, as directed by the Engineer.
 771.68
 
 Wrapping.
 
 Only deciduous trees will require wrapping. Trunks of trees 25 millimeters caliper and over shall be completely
 wrapped with burlap or other approved material beginning at the base of the tree and extending to the first branch.
 Wrapping shall be tied at the top and bottom and at 600 millimeter intervals. Wrapping of tree trunks shall not be
 completed until after inspection and approval by the Engineer. Wrapping of tree trunks shall be completed within five (5)
 calendar days after planting.
 771.69
 
 Protective Screen.
 
 All Euonymous, Flowering Cherries and Flowering Crabs shall be protected to a height of
 300 millimeters to 450 millimeters above the ground from animals and rodents by a protective cage. The cage shall be of
 wire or plastic mesh or other approved material and shall not make any direct contact with the tree. Standard practice
 shall apply.
 771.70
 
 Mulching.
 
 No mulch shall be applied prior to the first watering of the plant. Trees and shrubs shall be mulched not later
 than one week after planting.
 Mulch material shall be furnished and placed over all pit or saucer areas of individual trees and shrubs and over
 the entire area of shrub beds to the depth indicated on the plans.
 In areas to be planted with roses, vines, or ground cover, the entire area shall be mulched before planting. The
 mulch shall be parted at the location of each hole and carefully replaced around the plant immediately after planting.
 Preparation for mulch areas of mass planting shall conform to the provisions of Subsection 767.60.
 Mulch material may be wood chips, aged pine bark or other material as indicated on the plans or approved by the

 Pruning.
 
 Pruning of all plants shall be done only by persons skilled in this work, as follows: Initially, all broken or dead
 or injured branches shall be cut flush with the trunk or limb, and broken roots shall be pruned on the plant side of the
 break. Additional pruning shall be done in accordance with accepted nursery practice for the variety of plant involved.
 The foregoing shall be done at the time of planting.
 Dieback shall be pruned before final acceptance.
 Pruning shall not deform or otherwise destroy the typical shape or symmetry of the tree and shall not reduce the
 height by more than 1/3. The leader of the tree shall not be cut back unless otherwise directed.
 Cuts larger than 25 millimeters in diameter shall be painted with approved tree paint.
 771.72
 
 Care and Maintenance.
 
 The Contractor will be held responsible for all planted material until the project is completed and accepted, at
 which time all plants shall be in a healthy, growing condition and free from weeds or other obnoxious materials or
 conditions. All plants shall be cared for during the course of the project by weeding, cultivating, pruning, trimming,
 tightening of guys, resetting or replacement of plants where necessary, and by performing other operations to keep the
 plants healthy and growing.
 771.73
 
 Weeding.
 
 The Contractor will be responsible for weeding around planted materials mulched with wood chips. All weeding
 shall be completed before the acceptance of the project. At no time shall weeds attain the height of
 150 millimeters during the period of contract prior to acceptance.
 771.74
 
 Watering.
 
 All plants shall be watered during planting and all plants, except seedlings, shall be watered at least twice each
 week for a minimum of twelve (12) waterings. At each watering the soil around each tree or shrub shall be thoroughly
 saturated. If sufficient moisture is retained in the soil, as determined by the Engineer, the required watering may be
 reduced.
 Trees will require a minimum of 40 liters of water each, and shrubs a minimum of 20 liters each.
 Trees or shrubs planted after October 15 shall be thoroughly watered at the time of planting, after which
 subsequent watering will not be required.
 771.75
 
 Period of Establishment.
 
 The Contractor shall employ all possible means to preserve the plants in a healthy growing condition. The plant
 establishment period shall be for at least one year following the satisfactory completion of all planting on the contract or
 for the duration of contract, whichever is later. Care during the establishment period includes watering, cultivating,
 pruning, repair and adjustment of guys and stakes, and such other work as specified or ordered by the Engineer.
 771.76
 
 Replacement of Defective Plant Material.
 
 The Contractor shall replace all plant material that has not shown satisfactory evidence of growth. A semi-final
 inspection by the Engineer and the Contractor will be made to determine the acceptability of the plant material at a date no
 later than September 20 prior to a November project completion date. Each tree shall show at least 75% healthy growth
 and any other plants, except seedlings, shall show at least 50% healthy growth. All dead and unsatisfactory plants shall be
 replaced in kind and size with plants as originally specified, or on approval by the Engineer in writing, by alternate or
 substitute varieties of plant material of equal value. Replacement plantings of evergreens shall be in place by October 15
 and of deciduous by November 1. Replacement plantings shall conform to the provisions of this section, except the
 requirements for establishment.

 millimeters in depth shall be constructed on the bottom of the trench to provide a proper cushion for the conduit. This
 cushion of gravel shall be thoroughly tamped.
 C. Laying Conduits.
 Unless otherwise directed, all conduit lines shall be direct from one end to the other, no bends being allowed
 except when entering a pull box or signal base. Whenever 2 or more conduit lines are to be laid in the same trench, the
 conduits shall be separated from each other by a minimum distance of 75 millimeters.
 D. Joints.
 All joints shall be made in accordance with conduit or duct manufacturer’s recommendations, NEMA, UL and the
 Massachusetts Electrical Code (MEC).
 E. End Markers.
 Dead ends of conduit lines shall be plugged with wooden, plastic or fibre stoppers. To mark the ends, sections of
 50 millimeter by 100 millimeter studs, long enough so as to project above the surface of the ground after the trench has been
 backfilled, shall be set vertically before the backfill is placed. For single conduit lines, the stud shall be butted directly
 against the stopper in the end of the conduit. Where 2 or more conduit lines converge to a common point, each line shall be
 ended 600 millimeters from the common point of intersection and a stud set up at this point. Backfill shall not be placed
 until the Engineer has established the necessary ties to the studs.
 F. Concrete Envelope.
 All Type NM Conduits or ducts marked “X” on the plans shall be encased in a concrete envelope as shown on the
 Standard Drawings.
 G. Filling Trench.
 Gravel fill shall be made around the sides of the conduit and over it for a depth of 75 millimeters and thoroughly
 tamped. A plank of spruce, fir, hemlock or other satisfactory wood, about 150 millimeters wide and
 50 millimeters thick (nominal dimensions) shall be placed over this gravel and the filling of the trench with suitable
 materials in layers of not over 150 millimeters, compacted thoroughly, shall be completed. If Extra Heavy Wall (Schedule
 80) Conduit is selected as an option for Rigid Non-Metallic Conduit, an approved underground warning tape may be
 substituted for the 50 millimeter by 150 millimeter plank.
 H. Testing Installation.
 After the trench is backfilled, the Contractor shall, in the presence of the Engineer, test the installation by pushing
 or pulling through the entire length of the conduit line a rod, rope or fish tape on the end of which is attached a brush and
 ball with a diameter not smaller than 6 millimeters less than the inside diameter of the conduit. All obstructions, including
 stones, dirt, concrete, etc., shall be removed, and damaged conduits shall be replaced at the expense of the Contractor.
 I. Conduit and Duct Crossing Paved Roadways.
 Unless otherwise specified, when a trench has been cut across a paved surface, the trench shall be bridged with a
 150 millimeter concrete slab as shown on the Standard Drawings.
 When jacking or drilling methods are specified for placing conduits under existing pavements, pavement shall not
 be disturbed without the approval of the Engineer. In the event obstructions are encountered, upon approval of the
 Engineer, small test holes may be cut in the pavement to locate the obstructions. Jacking or drilling pits shall be kept 1
 meter clear of the edge of any type pavement wherever possible.

 J. Conduit on Structures.
 Conduit system on structures shall consist of furnishing and installing all material and equipment and performing
 all work necessary for a complete conduit system. The type of conduit shall be as designated on the plans conforming to the
 requirements of Subsection M5.07.1. All conduit bends shall be made in a neat and workmanlike manner; crushed or
 deformed conduit shall not be used. Conduit ends shall be reamed to remove all burrs, and all chips resulting from reaming
 removed from the conduit before installation. The ends of all conduit runs shall be protected by grounding bushings and be
 capped if wire and cable is not to be installed immediately. Conduit shall be held rigidly in place to prevent misalignment
 during placing of concrete. Reinforcing bars shall not be cut, bent, displaced or otherwise altered from that shown on the
 design plans, unless directed otherwise by the Engineer. One manufactured expansion fitting (made of material compatible
 with the conduit) shall be used for each conduit run on structures at every expansion joint of the structure, unless flexible
 metallic conduit loops or bends are stipulated. Clamps or hangers shall be provided at intervals not exceeding 1.5 meters.
 Conduit runs shall be made with the minimum practicable number of bends. The total of the angles of bends
 between junction or pull boxes shall not exceed 270°. So far as practicable, all bends shall be formed by the use of factory
 standard radius elbows. For metal conduit, where special angles of bends or offset bends are required, they may be formed
 to a radius of not less than 6 times the nominal inside diameter, provided the bend is made on a pipe bending machine.
 Field bends may be made by the use of a conduit bender forming curves the minimum radius of any portion of which shall
 not be less than 12 times the nominal inside diameter. Short radius bends shall be accomplished by the use of junction
 boxes or special condulets. Hot bends or other methods of bending which will destroy the protective coating on the metal
 conduit will not be permitted.
 Conduit in which the cross sectional area has been reduced or which contains sharp kinks will be rejected. Unless
 the plans indicate otherwise, conduit shall be continuous from outlet to outlet: however, the runs may be interrupted by
 condulets placed for the purpose of pulling conductors or making short radius bends. All metal conduit shall be cut square,
 the ends internally reamed and threaded the proper length and assembled at all fittings in proper manner so that all joints
 will be mechanically secure, water tight, and provide electrical continuity. All threaded connections shall be given a coat of
 pipe joint compound before fitting up.
 The ends of field cut joints on non-metallic conduit, except plastic, shall be tapered to conform to factory ends.
 The sections shall be joined at couplings and fittings by tapping the ends of sections sufficiently to provide water tight joints
 without over stressing or cracking the fittings. Where non-metallic conduit is joined to metallic conduit, special tapered and
 threaded non-metallic adapters shall be used. When fitting-up compound is specified for non-metallic conduit the
 compound shall be of a type which will remain plastic during assembly and set within a reasonable period thereafter. The
 compound shall be carefully painted on joints so that excess compound will not intrude on the inner surface of the conduit
 after assembly.
 All junction boxes shall be of sufficient size to provide for proper splicing and packing of all conductors, plus
 additional space for a future increase of 50% in the number of conductors or conductor size.
 All unused openings in boxes and fitting shall be closed by tight metal plates or plugs and all dead ends of conduit,
 except where provided for drainage, shall be fitted with pipe caps.
 All terminal ends of conduit not ending in boxes or condulets shall be fitted with rubber bused caps containing the
 required number and size of holes to tightly fit the conductors running through, or fitted with standard water tight terminal
 fittings or pot-heads.
 Where an obstruction may have developed in any conduit run, it shall be removed, if practicable. If the obstruction
 is not removed, the affected portion of the conduit system shall be removed and replaced with new, clean conduit, or, if this
 cannot be accomplished, an entire new conduit shall be placed around the affected section at a location selected by the
 Engineer.
 All conduit encased in concrete shall be rigidly held in proper position during concrete placement. Non-metallic
 conduit shall be secured against separation at the joints during concrete placement by being tied to a separate steel rod at
 least 13 millimeters in diameter running the full length of the conduit. Such rod and ties shall be considered as parts of the
 electrical installation.
 Provisions for adequate drainage shall be made in all conduit systems. Horizontal runs shall be slightly pitched
 and unless completely sealed against moisture, all low points shall be drained.
 Conduit shall be adequately supported by sleeves, fixed boxes, hangers, clamps, or anchorages placed at intervals
 not exceeding 1.5 meters. Anchor bolts which are indicated on the plans as set in concrete shall be placed in the proper
 location before placing concrete.
 Condulets, pull boxes, junction boxes and caps shall be of galvanized cast or malleable iron, of the threaded
 connection type with cast waterproof covers fitted with moisture proof gaskets. The covers of junction boxes which house
 
 II.174
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 transformers or cutouts shall be attached to the box by hinges or chains.
 Conduit or raceway sleeves shall be placed during construction of the portions of the structures in which they are
 located. They shall be maintained in a clean condition and protected from damage or obstruction by placing removable
 plugs or caps until ready for use.
 In general, exposed conduit shall not be placed until all adjacent construction work has been completed. Portions
 of conduit to be encased in masonry, or boxed in between structural members, shall be placed in advance of placing
 concrete or during assembly of structural members and protected from damage and plugging by use of covers or tight fitting
 metal caps.
 801.61
 
 Electric Manholes, Handholes, Pull Boxes and Junction Boxes.
 
 A. General.
 Electric manholes, handholes, pull and junction boxes shall be built to the lines, grades, dimensions and designs
 shown on the plans or Standard Drawings with the necessary frames, covers, etc., in accordance with the applicable
 provisions of Section 201, Basins, Manholes and Inlets.
 B. Cast in Place Concrete Units.
 After excavation, all loose material shall be removed before the forms are installed. All conduits, ground rods,
 pulling irons and reinforcing steel shall be installed rigidly in place before the concrete is placed. After the concrete for the
 manhole, handhole or pull box is placed, and forms removed, all exposed portions of the concrete shall be neatly finished.
 Frame castings shall be set according to the requirements of Subsection 201.63, Placing Castings.
 C. Pre-Cast Concrete Units.
 The construction methods for pre-cast concrete units shall conform to the relevant provisions of Section 901,
 Subsection M4.02.14 and the above Subsection 801.61-B.
 D. Metallic Units.
 Metallic pull and junction boxes shall be installed at the approximate locations shown on the plans, or in long
 conduit runs, they shall not be spaced over 50 meters from each other. It shall be the option of the Contractor, at his/her
 expense, to install additional pull or junction boxes that he/she may desire to facilitate his/her work.
 Pull or junction boxes installed shall not be of dissimilar metal to the metal conduit used in any one electrical
 system.
 801.62
 
 Foundations.
 
 Light standard, lighting load center, signal post, strain pole, signal mast arm and signal control cabinet foundations
 shall be constructed with the necessary anchor bolts (supplied under the items listed in Section 815 Traffic Control Signals,
 Section 820 Highway Lighting, and Section 824 Flashing Beacons, Illuminated Warning Signs and Lighted Barrier
 Arrows), reinforcing rods, conduit elbows or sweeps, etc., as shown on the Standard Drawings, and in accordance with the
 applicable requirements of Section 901 Cement Concrete Masonry.
 For core type foundation estimating and bidding purposes, in the absence of boring samples, or the actual
 determination of the soil properties at the proposed footing location, the Department will accept an assumed soil bearing
 pressure of 100 kiloPascals for the design of the footing using the Span Wire Assembly Design Chart III of the
 Department’s Standard Drawings. The moments shall be calculated from the data obtained from the relevant traffic control
 signal plan.
 However, the augered foundations shall not be constructed prior to soil classification of the subsurface soil by a
 qualified firm or person to perform the soil classification, analysis, and footing design.
 The actual existing soil conditions shall be determined from boring samples (see Section 190). If the results of the
 auger boring show that the soil classification requires the use of a Foundation Design Chart that requires a greater depth the
 foundation shall be constructed according to the requirements of the appropriate chart and payment will be made for the
 difference in depth under Item 815.98.
 Inversely, if it is determined the soil classification permits the use of a Foundation Design Chart that requires a
 lesser depth, the Department shall be credited for the difference in depth under Item 815.98.
 All unsuitable material within the limits of the footing must be removed at the direction of the Engineer (Peat
 organic material, material that has been dumped, etc.).
 The concrete for the footing shall be placed immediately after excavation to prevent water from collecting in the
 excavated area.

 CONSTRUCTION METHODS
 813.60
 
 Wire and Cable.
 
 A. Steel Messenger Cable Fittings.
 Messenger cable (integral with Types 3 & 4 Traffic Signal Cable) shall be secured to strain poles by means of pole
 bands. Pole bands shall be installed as detailed on the Standard Drawings. Strain insulators shall be installed as shown on
 the plans. Attachments to utility owned poles shall be according to the local utility company requirements and under the
 supervision of the local utility company Engineer. The Contractor shall furnish and install back guys, head guys, anchors,
 etc. that may be requested by the local utility Engineer, where guys are necessary due to the placement of traffic signal
 equipment on utility poles.
 Traffic signal cable shall be attached to messenger cables by spinning the cable to the messenger with an approved
 lashing material (stainless steel or Kevlar-Aramid fiber core with nylon jacket) or when approved in writing, steel cable
 rings approved for the purpose may be used.
 B. Installation of Copper Wire and Cable.
 Installation of wire and cable shall not begin until the conduit system has been tested in accordance with the
 requirements of Section 801.60 Conduit, Paragraph H, Testing Installations.
 All conductors and grounding wire shall be drawn, by hand, into ducts or conduits without damage to covering,
 sheath, insulation or wires. This wiring shall not be done until all work which may damage the wires has been completed.
 In pulling, all wires shall be drawn freely into conduits without kinks or bends, twisting or lapping. In general, all
 conductors in each conduit run shall be pulled at the same time, fed from free running reels. Powdered soapstone, talcum or
 other approved lubricant may be used to assist in placing wire and cable in conduits.
 A sufficient length of slack shall be allowed for each cable in all manholes, handholes, pull and junction boxes and
 
 II.178
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 equipment enclosures, to provide for neat racking and movement due to thermal expansion and contraction.
 C. Splicing.
 Splices shall be made in accordance with the Electrical Code by Journeymen Electricians holding “Certificate B”
 issued by the Board of State Examiners of Electricians.
 Splices shall be made only in manholes, handholes, control cabinets, junction boxes or signal and lighting bases.
 Pull boxes shall not be used for splicing, except in pull boxes where vehicle detectors are used, soldered splices
 will be permitted in the pull box nearest the detector (see Subsection 813.60, B). Detector leads shall not run in the same
 cable sheath or jacket in cable carrying signal currents.
 The conductors shall be joined by the use of connectors and terminal lugs, listed by Underwriters Laboratory, and
 meet all requirements of the Massachusetts Electrical Code.
 Splices shall be insulated. Unless otherwise specified, the Contractor may use any of the following:
 1. A filler compound or moisture-resistant self-fusing tape, applied to a thickness equal to, and well lapped over,
 the original conductor insulation, followed by two layers of electrical insulating tape.
 The dielectric strength of splices shall be at least equal to that of the cable insulation.
 2. An UL approved electrical spring connector (“wire-nut”) with an approved sealing compound for protection
 from dampness and water.
 3. An approved re-enterable rigid body splice kit with a non-hardening sealing compound compatible with the
 wire insulation.
 4. An approved heat-shrinking cable sleeve or tape, designed to provide electrical insulation and protect
 overhead and underground splices from moisture penetration, corrosion and electrical breakdown.
 After wiring and splicing is completed, all conduit runs shall be plugged at all manholes, handholes, pull boxes,
 junction boxes, cabinets and foundations to form a complete closed conduit or duct system to prevent air circulation.
 Approved sealing compound (including foam) shall be used in liberal amounts, carefully forced into the ends of the
 conduits and tightly packed around all wire and cables completely sealing the opening.
 D. Highway Lighting Circuit Identification.
 The Contractor shall furnish and install colored tapes and identification tags on all lighting conductors at the points
 where they connect to equipment and on cables in all pull and junction boxes and pole shafts. The colored tapes shall cover
 150 millimeter portion of the conductor at these points, line 1 - black, neutral - white, line 2 - red, line 3 - blue. In pole
 shafts, line - black, neutral - white, photocell bypass - red. The tags shall be nylon or other suitable non-metallic material,
 not less than 20 millimeters in diameter, and not less than
 1 millimeter thick. Identification markings shall be stamped on the tags by means of small tool dies. Each tag shall be
 securely tied to the proper conductor by nylon or other suitable non-metallic cord (plastic or nylon).

 Equipment Grounding.
 
 With each cable run an equipment grounding conductor shall be installed to which all equipment shall be bonded
 in accordance with standard practice and the Code.
 Metallic cable sheaths, metal conduit, non-metallic conduit grounding conductors, ballast and transformer cases,
 metal poles and pedestals, metal junction and pull boxes, and metal cabinets shall be made mechanically and electrically
 secure to form a continuous system and shall be effectively grounded to the ground electrode installed at the service point.
 Bonding of traffic signal standards, pedestals, strain poles and mast arms shall be accomplished by installing a 5
 millimeter or larger brass bolt in the lower portion of the shaft.
 For bonding purposes in all non-metallic type conduit, the grounding conductor shall be run continuously. Where
 non-metallic conduit is to be installed for future use, the above mentioned conductor may be omitted.
 In lieu of the continuous equipment grounding conductor, when approved by the Engineer, a ground electrode may
 be installed at each pole or standard.
 Bonding of metallic conduit systems in concrete foundations and pull boxes shall be by means of approved
 grounding bushings (compatible with the conduit) and bonding jumpers.
 All expansion sleeves in metallic conduit runs shall be provided with a bonding jumper, as specified.
 813.62
 
 Ground Electrodes.
 
 A. General.
 When an underground water system is used as the grounding electrode, the grounding conductor shall be securely
 attached to the piping system by welding or brazing or other approved means.
 If a water-piping system is not available, a driven rod, as specified in Subsection 813.40C, shall be used as the
 
 II.180
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 grounding electrode. Driven rods should, as far as practical, be embedded below permanent moisture level. Except where
 rock is encountered, rods shall be driven to a depth of at least 2.5 meters. Where rock is encountered, other devices
 approved for the purpose shall be used (see Article 250 - Grounding MEC).
 B. Resistance Tests.
 Grounding electrodes shall, where practicable, have a resistance to ground not to exceed 25 ohms. Where the
 resistance is not as low as 25 ohms, additional rods shall be driven, placed at least 2.5 meters apart and connected in parallel
 with a #6 AWG bare copper solid or stranded conductor, as directed by the Engineer.
 The measurement shall be made with either a Ground Ohmer or Megger Ground Tester with all wire disconnected
 (except parallel connections and test wires) from the rod and in the presence of the Engineer. The Contractor shall furnish
 the Engineer with a report of all resistivity tests, indicating the values obtained for each and combinations (parallel
 connected) of rods tested. This report shall become a part of the “as built” records.
 813.63

 FABRICATION
 828.50
 
 General.
 
 Sign fabrication shall be done in a plant properly equipped for the production of the types of signs specified.
 Sign panels shall show careful workmanship and present a reasonably plane surface with the message and outlines
 clear and sharp.
 Finished sign panels shall be shipped in such manner as to ensure arrival on the project in an undamaged condition,
 where they shall be properly protected from dirt, scratches, hand-marks and other blemishes until erected and accepted.
 828.51
 
 Reflective Sheeting.
 
 A. Application.
 Reflective sheeting shall be applied to properly treated base panels with mechanical equipment in a manner
 specified for the manufacture of traffic control signs by the sheeting manufacturer. Heat activated adhesive coated sheeting
 shall be pre-perforated.
 Sign faces, comprising two or more pieces or panels of reflective sheeting, must be carefully matched for color at
 the time of sign fabrication to provide uniform appearance and brilliance both day and night. Alternate, successive width
 sections of either sheeting or panels must be reversed and consecutive, to insure that corresponding edges of reflective
 sheeting lie adjacent on the finished sign. Nonconformance may result in nonuniform shading and an undesirable contrast
 between adjacent widths of applied sheeting, which will not be acceptable.
 Pressure sensitive adhesive coated sheeting shall be overlapped at splices not less than 5 millimeters. Heat
 activated adhesive coated sheeting may be spliced with overlap not less than 5 millimeters or butted, gap not to exceed 1.0
 millimeter. Only butt splices shall be permitted on signs screen-processed with transparent color. Sheeting applied to
 extruded sections shall extend over top edges and down side legs a minimum of
 2 millimeters. No splices shall be allowed on sign panels 2 square meters or under. For D6 guide sign panels over 2 square
 meters, splices shall be avoided; however, a maximum of one splice is allowed if necessary.
 B. Finish (Protective Coating).
 1. When pressure sensitive adhesive coated reflective sheeting is used all sheeting splices and sign edges shall be
 sealed with materials recommended by and in a manner specified by the sheeting manufacturer.
 2. Dry heat activated adhesive coated reflective sheeting when applied to aluminum or high-density plywood
 shall be edge sealed as specified by the sheeting manufacturer.

 II.219
 
 review and approval of Shop Drawing submitted by the Contractor.
 The plans for foundations and ground mounted supports shall be based on the data included on plans titled
 “Standard Sign Support Foundations” and “Standard Ground Mounted Sign Supports – Breakaway Design.” The plans for
 overhead structures shall conform to the requirements of Section 828.21.
 In the absence of boring samples, or the actual determination of the soil properties at the proposed spread footing
 location, the Department will accept an assumed soil bearing pressure of 100 kiloPascals for the design of the spread
 footing. Boring samples or actual determination of soil properties are required for core footings.
 All unsuitable material within the limits of the footing must be removed at the direction of the Engineer (Peat,
 organic material, material that has been dumped, etc.).
 The concrete for the footing shall be placed immediately after excavation to prevent water from collecting in the
 excavated area.
 All overhead and cantilever sign support structures shall be designed so as to be supported by single poles or end
 frames having not more than two (2) vertical main members.
 All overhead and cantilever sign structures shall have as an integral part of the structure, a Department approved
 damping device, which shall be installed during erection of the structure.
 The damping devices shall be installed as follows:
 Overhead structures shall have the damping devices installed at the midpoint of the span (plus or minus
 300 millimeters), regardless of sign panel location.
 Two-chord structures shall have the damper attached to the top chord at mid-span.
 Tri-chord structures shall have the damper attached to the middle chord at mid-span.
 Box truss structures shall have the damper attached to the rear top chord at mid-span.
 Cantilever structures shall have the damper attached to the outer end of the horizontal member.
 Existing structures which do not have damping devices shall have dampers installed as part of the contract.
 Existing structures, which have dampers not attached as specified above, shall have them removed and attached as
 specified above.
 The approximate locations for the new signs are shown on the plans, the exact locations to be determined by the
 Engineer on the project.
 The Department will mark or stake the center point for each sign foundation only once whereupon it shall be the
 responsibility of the Contractor to furnish and set at his/her own expense all tie and construction stakes necessary for the
 erection of the sign.
 All measurements to fabricate and erect the overhead sign structures and supports for ground mounted signs shall
 be made by the Contractor. Field measurements needed to determine the exact span and height of each structure should be
 taken immediately upon award of the Contract for incorporation in the structural layout on the shop drawings prior to
 submission for review.
 The Contractor shall submit all design work, together with hand or computerized calculations and plans used for
 design purposes, to the Department; these to become the property of the Department and for which he/she shall receive no
 additional compensation. All design work shall bear the seal of a Registered Professional Engineer registered in
 Massachusetts.
 Certificates of compliance shall conform to the requirements of Subsection 6.01.
 Before fabricating the sign support structures the Contractor shall submit erection plans and shop drawings for
 approval of the Engineer in accordance with Subsections 5.02, 828.21 and 960.60 of these Specifications. Span lengths,
 post heights, vertical and horizontal clearances, material specifications (grade and/or alloy), anchor bolt layout, and all
 pertinent information shall be included on the shop drawings. Provisions for cambering shall also be shown to insure that
 horizontal cross beams will not deflect below the horizontal.
 A handhole 100 millimeters x 175 millimeters (minimum size) with frame and cover shall be installed in each
 overhead support structure post and positioned approximately 300 millimeters above the top of footing. The frames and
 covers shall be the same material as the posts. A removable cap with set screws shall be furnished on the top of each

 Forms.
 
 Approved centers and forms shall be provided by the Contractor. Piles shall be used for falsework if required by
 the Engineer. No extra compensation for falsework or falsework piling shall be allowed, such work being considered part
 of the form work. Falsework shall be set to give the structural camber indicated on the plans or as specified, plus
 allowance for shrinkage, shortening under load or settlement. Forms, falsework and centering shall be designed for a
 liquid head, equal to the maximum height of the liquid concrete in the forms for various placing conditions assuming the
 load of the liquid concrete to be 2400 kilograms per cubic meter, and in addition thereto a live load allowance of 2.4
 kiloPascals on horizontal surfaces.
 When not otherwise specified on the plans, or in the special provisions, forms for all exposed portions of bridges
 and structures shall be lined with approved material, or form sheathing which shall consist of five-ply water-proof
 plywood, approved metal sheathing or other approved material in order to give the concrete a smooth even finish and
 uniform appearance.
 This requirement shall not apply to the underside of the deck of a bridge over a waterway, the underside of a
 bridge over a railroad, or any part of a structure that will be at least 600 millimeters below the surface of adjacent ground
 in the completed project. Any material that will provide tight forms will be acceptable for such locations.
 Full sheets of plywood or other approved material shall be used wherever possible and shall be placed in a
 regular pattern. The use of small pieces and leftovers will not be permitted except as they may be needed to complete the
 design. Forms in good condition may be reused, but forms for any one exposed face shall be all new or all used material
 and a mixture of old and new forms will not be permitted. Forms for cylindrical pier columns shall be smooth and
 reasonably free of joints.
 The sheathing shall be jointed tightly to prevent leakage from the mix and it shall be of sufficient strength to hold
 the concrete without bulging between supports. Forms shall be properly braced and tied so as to maintain proper
 dimensions. Bolts, rods, or other satisfactory form ties shall be used for internal ties. Wire ties will not be permitted
 except when directed or where concrete is not exposed to view. The Engineer may require the Contractor to employ
 screw jacks or hard wood wedges in connection with the centering of falsework in order to take up any distortion or
 settlement in the form work either before or during the placing of the concrete.
 Approved inserts shall be used in connection with all ties in the region of exposed surfaces on the concrete. They
 shall be so designed as to permit their removal from the concrete without injury to the concrete, and the metal remaining in
 the concrete shall be not closer than 40 millimeters to the surface. The inserts shall be truly round, not more than 40
 millimeters in outside diameter and shall be treated with nonstaining mineral oil or other satisfactory material adequate for
 preventing any adherence to surrounding concrete. Special tools and methods shall be used to remove the inserts from the
 concrete in a manner to prevent damage to the concrete. When forming the concrete surface in front of coated reinforcing
 mats, all ties and any parts thereof that are to be left in place shall be either epoxy coated or galvanized within a minimum
 of 75 millimeters of that concrete surface.
 Form ties of a design with a weakened section 40 millimeters back from the concrete face may be used at places
 of minor pressure when permitted by the Engineer, but such ties shall be provided with special inserts so as to assure the
 breaking off of the ties at the proper depth inside the face of the concrete. When such ties fail to break off at the designed
 depth, the tie metal shall be drilled out before the tie hole is patched.
 The use of wooden struts within forms, or of metal ties without approved inserts, as required, will not be
 permitted.
 The centers shall be true to the lines, satisfactorily supported and firmly secured. They shall remain in place as
 long as directed and shall be replaced with new ones if they lose their proper dimensions and shape.
 Forms for the roadway deck slabs shall be so construed that under full dead load, the thickness of the slabs shall
 be the required thickness shown on the plans and the surface of the pavement will accurately conform to the profile grades,
 cross sections and alignment shown on the plans. Allowance shall be made for the camber of the floor members as erected
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.237
 
 and for the additional dead load deflections of the floor members.
 Slab haunches shall be provided over steel girders, floor beams or stringers. The depth of haunches shall be
 variable as required to maintain the uniform thickness of slab between the steel supports.
 All exposed edges and corners of concrete not otherwise specified on the plans shall be formed with a wooden
 triangular 45° chamfer strip 20 millimeters on the square sides. These triangular chamfer strips shall be machine surfaced
 on all sides and shall be of uniform dimensions throughout the project. Any chamfered or beveled corners of concrete
 specified on the plans of larger size shall be formed and finished as required for other parts of the adjacent forms.
 Where rustications are called for on the plans, as for abutments and wingwalls, the form liners for rustications
 shall be surfaced on all sides true to line, plans and dimensions in accordance with the detail on the plans. The form liners
 shall be fastened to the forms in such a manner that the form liners will remain in the concrete when the forms are
 removed. These moldings shall not be removed until the concrete has hardened sufficiently so that the edges of the
 concrete adjacent to the moldings shall not be damaged.
 Bridge bearing anchor bolts in piers shall be set accurately by template prior to placing concrete. Anchor bolts in
 abutments may be set by template or by drilling and grouting. Grout shall be a non-shrinking type.
 The shape, strength, rigidity, water-tightness and surface smoothness of re-used forms shall be maintained at all
 times. Any warped or bulged lumber must be resized before being used. Forms which are unsatisfactory in any respect
 shall not be used and shall be removed immediately from the work.
 The inside of forms shall be coated with non-staining mineral oil or other approved material to prevent adherence
 of the concrete to the forms, immediately before placing the concrete. When oil is used, it shall be applied before the
 reinforcing steel is placed. Any material which will adhere to, discolor or affect the concrete in any manner shall not be
 used. Forms for bridge decks shall not be oiled but shall be dampened with water ahead of concrete placement.
 In the construction of copings, railings and other intricate sections, extreme care shall be taken in the construction
 to insure true lines.
 Prior to placing concrete in the forms all foreign matter and any extraneous materials shall be removed.
 Forms shall be inspected immediately preceding and during the placing of the concrete. All dimensions shall be
 checked carefully and any errors, bulges, warping or other defects shall be remedied before any concrete is placed.
 Temporary openings shall be provided for inspection at the base of the column and wall forms and near the
 bottom of all deep members.
 The foregoing specifications for forms as regards design, mortar-tightness, chamfers or moldings, bracing,
 alignment, treatment by coating with oil or other approved material, removing and reuse, shall apply to metal forms when
 such forms are approved for use. The metal forms used shall be of such strength that the forms will remain true to shape.
 All bolt and rivet heads shall be countersunk. Clamps, pins or other connecting devices shall be designed to hold the
 forms rigidly together and to allow removal without injury to the concrete. Metal forms which do not present a smooth
 surface or which do not line up properly shall not be used. Special care shall be exercised to keep metal forms free from
 rust, grease or other foreign matter that will tend to discolor the concrete. Metal forms shall be provided with an
 adjustable metal section or occasional sections where wooden forms may be inserted to compensate for slight inaccuracies
 in measurement.
 Removable or stay-in-place forms for bridge decks may be used as alternates except in hazardous locations
 where stay-in-place forms shall be used. Hazardous locations are defined as high volume roadways and all railroads under
 the bridge.
 Removable forms shall be used for forming end diaphrams, bays with longitudinal construction joints, and
 overhanging portions of decks.
 Material to prevent concrete from adhering to the forms shall not be used when stay-in-place forms are used.
 Design of Permanent Steel Bridge Deck Forms.
 The following criteria shall govern the design of permanent steel bridge deck form:
 1. The steel forms shall be designed on the basis of dead load of form, reinforcement and plastic concrete plus
 2.4 kiloPascals for construction loads. The unit working stress in the steel sheets shall not be more than 0.725 of the
 specified minimum yield strength of the material furnished, but not to exceed
 250 megaPascals.
 2. Deflection under the load of the forms, the plastic concrete and reinforcement shall not exceed 1/180 of the
 form span or 13 millimeters whichever is less. In no case shall this design loading be less than
 6 kiloPascals total.
 The permissible form camber shall be based on the actual dead load condition. Camber shall not be used to
 compensate for deflection in excess of the foregoing limits.
 
 II.238
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 3. The design span of the form sheets shall be the clear span of the form plus 50 millimeters measured parallel
 to the form flutes.
 4. Physical design properties shall be computed in accordance with requirements of the American Iron and
 Steel Institute Specification for the Design of Cold Formed Steel Structural Members, latest published edition.
 5. All reinforcement shall have minimum concrete cover of 25 millimeters.
 6. The plan dimensions of both layers of primary deck reinforcement from the top surface of the concrete deck
 shall be maintained.
 7. Permanent steel bridge deck form shall not be considered as lateral bracing for compression flanges of
 supporting structural members.
 8. Permanent steel bridge deck form shall not be used in panels where longitudinal deck construction joints are
 located between stringers.
 9. Welding shall not be permitted to flanges in tension or to structural steel bridge elements fabricated from
 non-weldable grades of steel.
 10. Fabricator’s shop and erection drawings shall be submitted to the Engineer for approval. These plans shall
 indicate the grade of steel deck form sheets and a clear indication of locations where the forms are supported by steel
 beam flanges subject to tensile stresses.
 All forms shall be installed in accordance with approved fabrication and erection plans.
 Form sheets shall not be permitted to rest directly on the top of the stringer or floor beam flanges. Sheets shall be
 securely fastened to form supports and shall have a minimum bearing length of 25 millimeters at each end. Form supports
 shall be placed in direct contact with the flange of stringer or floor beam. All attachments shall be made by permissible
 welds, bolts, or clips of other approved means. However, welding of form supports to flanges of steels not considered
 weldable and to portions of flange subject to tensile stresses shall not be permitted. Welding and welds shall be in
 accordance with the provisions of AWS D2.0 pertaining to fillet welds except that 3 millimeter fillet welds will be
 permitted.
 Any permanently exposed form metal where the galvanized coating has been damaged shall be thoroughly
 cleaned, wire brushed and painted with two coats of zinc oxide-zinc dust primer, Federal Specification TT-P-64 ld, Type
 II, no color added, to the satisfaction of the Engineer. Minor heat discoloration in areas of welds need not be touched up.
 The Contractor’s method of construction should be carefully observed during all phases of the construction of the
 bridge deck slab. These phases include installation of the metal forms; location and fastening of the reinforcement;
 composition of concrete items; mixing procedures, concrete placement and vibration; and finishing of the bridge deck.
 Should the Engineer determine that the procedures used during the placement of the concrete warrant inspection of the
 underside of the deck, the Contractor shall remove at least one section of the forms at a location and time selected by the
 Engineer for each span in the contract. This should be done as soon after placing the concrete as practicable in order to
 provide visual evidence that the concrete mix and the Contractor’s procedures are obtaining the desired results. An
 additional section shall be removed if the Engineer determines that there has been any change in the concrete mix or in the
 Contractor’s procedures warranting additional inspection.
 After the deck concrete has been in place for a minimum period of 2 days, the concrete shall be tested for
 soundness and bonding of the forms by sounding with a hammer as directed by the Engineer. If areas of doubtful
 soundness are disclosed by this procedure, the Contractor will be required to remove the forms from such areas for visual
 inspection after the pour has attained adequate strength. This removal of the permanent steel bridge deck forms shall be at
 no cost to the project. At locations where sections of the forms are removed, the Contractor will not be required to replace
 the forms, but the adjacent metal forms and supports shall be repaired to present a neat appearance and assure their
 satisfactory retention. As soon as the form is removed, the concrete surfaces will be examined for cavities, honeycombing
 and other defects. If irregularities do not justify rejection of the work, the concrete shall be repaired as the Engineer may
 direct and shall be given an Ordinary Surface Finish, in accordance with the contract specifications. If the concrete where
 the form is removed is unsatisfactory, additional forms, as necessary, shall be removed to inspect and repair the slab, and
 the Contractor’s methods of construction shall be modified as required to obtain satisfactory concrete in the slab. All
 unsatisfactory concrete shall be removed or repaired as directed by the Engineer.
 The amount of sounding and form removal may be moderated, at the Engineer’s discretion, after a substantial
 amount of slab has been constructed and inspected, if the Contractor’s methods of construction and the results of the
 inspections as outlined above indicate that sound concrete is being obtained through the slabs.
 The Contractor shall provide all facilities as are reasonably required for the safe and convenient conduct of the
 Engineer’s inspection procedure.

 Reinforcement.
 
 The Contractor shall submit for approval detailed plans and schedules of the reinforcing bars so that the
 reinforcement may be properly placed and its mass readily computed. If it is impractical to obtain or use bars of the full
 length required, the bars shall be lapped for the length shown on the plans. If no lap length is provided, the lap length
 shall be calculated for the type of bar used according to the latest AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges
 for a Class C splice.
 Coated bars shall be either epoxy coated or galvanized, as specified on the plans. Where coated bars are called
 for without designation, they may be either epoxy coated bars or galvanized bars, however mixing epoxy coated and
 galvanized bars will not be permitted. Where coated bars are used in combination with uncoated bars in a reinforcing mat
 or cage and the coated bars will touch or be tied to uncoated bars with wire ties, only epoxy coated bars may be used.
 All support devices and ties for galvanized bars used in deck reinforcing shall be coated so that there is no
 electrical continuity either between reinforcing mats or between the reinforcing and the stay-in-place forms or steel beams.
 All support devices and ties for epoxy coated bars used in deck reinforcing shall be either epoxy coated or coated
 with a plastic material compatible with the epoxy reinforcing bar coating.
 The steel shall be bent in the shop true to templates and shall be placed accurately as shown on the plans with the
 following tolerance:
 1. Cover (clearance from face of concrete to bar) ± 5 millimeters.
 2. Horizontal spacing of bars ± 50 millimeters (however the required number of bars must be placed). The
 minimum spacing cannot be decreased. The reinforcement shall be placed so as to insure its remaining in the correct
 position during the placing and hardening of the concrete. No splicing shall be at points of maximum stress and the clear
 distances between spliced bars shall not be less than 1-1/2 times the nominal diameter of the bars, 1-1/2 times the
 maximum size of the coarse aggregate, nor less than
 40 millimeters.
 The required distance between reinforcing steel and the forms shall be maintained by means of stays, blocks, ties,
 hangers or other approved supports. The spacing of reinforcing supports shall not exceed
 1.2 meters.
 Steel reinforcing mats shall be firmly secured against displacement by tying every other intersection point with a
 maximum of 300 millimeters between tied joints. In addition, steel reinforcing mats (top and bottom) shall be securely
 connected together so that uniform vertical spacing can be maintained throughout. This connection may be accomplished
 by tying with coated tie wires or other means as approved by the Engineer. Connections shall be placed no farther apart
 than 1.2 meters on center. Support devices may be utilized for this purpose. Connection devices shall neither deflect the
 steel reinforcing nor interfere with the smooth flow of concrete.
 Blocks for holding reinforcement from contact with the forms shall be precast mortar blocks of approved shape
 and dimensions. Blocks for spacing reinforcing bars shall also be precast mortar blocks of approved designs and short
 enough to permit their ends to be adequately covered with concrete. The precast mortar blocks shall be made from the
 same materials and of the same proportions of sand and cement as that of the concrete in which they are to be used. They
 shall be cast and properly cured before use and shall have a wire of copper or other non-rusting metal or other approved
 device cast into each block suitably placed so that the block can be securely fastened to the reinforcement. Layers of bars,
 except for those placed in bridge decks, shall be separated by such blocks, which may be reinforced, and which shall have
 slots to receive the bars and hold them in place, or by other approved means. Any parts of metal supports that are left in
 place within
 75 millimeters of an exposed surface of the concrete shall be made of either non-rusting metal, epoxy coated or
 galvanized. Galvanizing of such parts shall be in accordance with Subsection 960.64. The use of pebbles, pieces of
 broken stone, metal pipe or wooden blocks will not be permitted.
 Reinforcement in any member or section shall be in place and approved by the Engineer before the placing of
 concrete begins. In no case shall reinforcing steel be driven or forced into the concrete after it has taken its initial set; and
 any reinforced concrete placed in violation of this provision will be rejected by the Engineer, and then shall be removed
 and replaced by the Contractor entirely at his/her own expense.
 When wire mesh is used as reinforcement, it shall be furnished and placed in accordance with the plans. If the
 wire mesh is shipped in rolls, it shall be straightened into flat sheets before being used.
 Dowels, where required, shall be furnished and placed as indicated on the plans and as directed.
 Reinforcement that extends continuously within the concrete of the substructure and the concrete of the
 superstructure, or any other reinforcement that might stain the exposed surface of the bridge shall be given a light coat of
 
 II.240
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 neat cement grout on the surfaces of the reinforcement that will be exposed for more than three weeks before being
 encased in concrete. Subsequent coats of grout may be required.
 901.62
 
 Anchors.
 
 Bent plate edging, steel curbing, expansion dams at back of parapet and fixed dam assemblies shall be anchored
 to the concrete by use of headed anchors. Headed anchors shall conform to the requirements of stud shear connectors.
 901.63
 
 Partition Tile.
 
 The tile under the sidewalk above the bridge deck slab shall be light weight hollow partition tile. The blocks
 shall be closely butted. The end blocks shall be left open at the lower end of the sidewalk.
 901.64
 
 Shear Connectors.
 
 All shear connections shall be the stud reinforcement type and the following requirements shall apply:
 A. Stud shear connectors shall be end welded to steel beams or girders with automatically time stud welding
 equipment connected to a suitable power source.
 B. If two or more stud welding guns are to be operated from the same power source, they shall be interlocked
 so that only one gun can operate at a time and so that the power source has fully recovered from making one weld before
 another weld is started. The power source shall be adequate to meet the requirements of the size of stud being welded.
 C. At the time of welding, the studs shall be free from any rust, rust pits, scale, oil or other deleterious matter
 which would adversely affect the welding operation.
 D. Welding shall not be done when the base metal temperature is below -18 °C, or when the surface is wet or
 exposed to rain or snow.
 E. While in operation the welding gun shall be held in position without movement until the welded metal has
 solidified.
 F. When necessary to obtain satisfactory welds, the areas on the beam or girder to which the studs are to be
 welded shall be wire-brushed, peened, prick-punched, or ground free of scale or rust.
 G. Longitudinal and lateral spacings of studs with respect to each other and to edges of beam or girder flanges
 shall not vary more than 10 millimeters from the dimension shown on the plans except that a variation of 25 millimeters
 will be permitted where required to avoid obstruction with other attachments on the beam or where a new stud is being
 welded to replace a defective one. The minimum distance from the edge of a stud to the edge of a beam shall be 25
 millimeters, but preferably not less than 40 millimeters.
 H. The first two studs welded on each beam or girder, after being allowed to cool, shall be bent 45° by striking
 the stud with a hammer. If failure occurs in the weld of either stud, the procedure shall be corrected and two successive
 studs successfully welded and tested before any more studs are welded to the beam or girder. The Engineer shall be
 promptly informed of any changes in the welding procedure at any time during construction.
 I. When the temperature of the base metal is below 0 °C, one stud in each 100 studs welded shall be bent 45°
 in addition to the first two bent as specified in H above.
 J. Studs on which a full 360° weld is not obtained may, at the option of the Contractor, be repaired by adding a
 5 millimeter fillet weld in place of the lack of weld, using the shielded metal-arc process with low-hydrogen welding
 electrodes.
 K. If the reduction in the height of the studs as they are welded becomes less than normal, welding shall be
 stopped immediately and not resumed until the cause has been corrected.
 L. Before welding a new stud where a defective one has been removed, the area shall be ground smooth and
 flush, or in the case of a pullout of metal, the pocket shall be filled with weld metal using the shielded metal-arc process
 with low-hydrogen welding electrodes and then ground flush. In compression areas of flanges, a new stud may be welded
 adjacent to the defective area in lieu of repair and replacement on existing weld area. (See G above.)
 M. Inspection Requirements.
 1. If visual inspection reveals any stud which does not show a full 360° weld, any stud which has been repaired
 by welding, or any stud in which the reduction in height due to welding is less than normal, such stud shall be struck with a
 hammer and bent 15° off the vertical. For studs showing less than a 360° weld, the direction of bending shall be opposite
 to the lack of weld. Studs that crack either in the weld or the shank shall be replaced.
 2. The Engineer, at his/her option, may select additional studs to be subjected to the bend test specified above.
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.241
 
 3. The studs tested that show no signs of failure may be left in the bent position.
 4. If during the progress of the work, inspection and testing indicate in the judgment of the Engineer that the
 shear connectors being obtained are not satisfactory, the Contractor will be required at his/her expense to make such
 changes in welding procedure, welding equipment and type of shear connector as necessary to secure satisfactory results.
 901.65
 
 Handling and Placing Concrete.
 
 The Contractor shall notify the Engineer at least 24 hours in advance of his/her intention to place concrete.
 All concrete shall be placed during daylight, and the placing of concrete shall not be started unless it can be
 completed and finished during daylight hours, except that when an adequate and approved lighting system is provided
 beforehand, the Engineer may waive this requirement.
 No concrete shall be placed in a bridge or other structure where piles are required until all piles in the structure
 have been driven, unless otherwise directed by the Engineer. However, the placing of concrete in the steel shells for castin-place concrete piles and steel pipe piles shall be done as specified in Subsection 940.69.
 No concrete shall be placed until the depth, character and water conditions of the foundations, the adequacy of
 falsework and forms, the absence of debris in the forms, the condition of the construction joints, and the condition and
 spacing of the reinforcing steel have been inspected and approved by the Engineer.
 The placing of concrete shall be so regulated that the pressures caused by the wet concrete shall not cause
 distortion or movement of the forms.
 The operation of handling and placing the concrete shall be conducted so as to form an artificial stone of
 maximum density and impermeability and of uniform texture which shall show smooth surfaces when the forms are
 removed.
 Concrete shall be deposited in such manner that the total deflection or settlement of supporting members and the
 final finishing of the surface shall have occurred before initial set of the concrete takes place. An approved admixture
 shall be used as necessary to retard setting.
 Calcium Chloride or any other admixture containing chloride salts shall not be used in concrete placed on
 permanent steel deck forms.
 A. Transportation.
 The concrete shall be transported from the mixer and placed in the forms by a method which will permit handling
 concrete of the slump required without segregation. Buggies and wheelbarrows used for this purpose shall be equipped
 with pneumatic tires. Chutes may be used but the use of long chutes will be permitted only on authority from the
 Engineer. If such conveyors are allowed and the quality of the concrete as it reaches the forms or the methods of placing
 or working it therein are not satisfactory, the Engineer may order their use discontinued and the substitution of a
 satisfactory method of placing. Chutes shall be metal or metal lined, inclined so as to have a slope of between 1:2 (1
 vertical to 2 horizontal) and 1:3 (1 vertical to
 3 horizontal); and shall extend as nearly as possible to the point of placing concrete. Long chutes shall be provided with
 reverse flow or remixing hoppers in order to correct for segregation. All chutes shall be kept clean and free from coatings
 of hardened concrete.
 Transportation of concrete by pumping will be permitted provided that the required slump or air content can be
 maintained at the discharge end of the hose and there is no adverse effect to the mix design. The equipment shall be
 suitable in kind and adequate in capability for the work. The operation shall be such that a continuous stream of concrete
 without air pockets is produced. When pumping is completed, the concrete remaining in the pipeline shall be ejected in
 such a manner that there will be no separation of the ingredients.
 Pumping through aluminum piping will not be permitted.
 At the conclusion of placement, the entire equipment shall be thoroughly cleaned.
 B. Depositing.
 The concrete shall be placed in the form in the approved manner to prevent stone pockets, voids or segregation
 and to reduce handling and flowing in the forms to a minimum. The concrete shall not be dropped more than 1 meter or
 dragged more than 3 meters in the forms. Points of deposit shall be spaced not more than 6 meters apart nor more than 3
 meters from the ends of the forms. Concrete shall be properly distributed in the forms by hand shoveling. The forms shall
 be filled at a rate of 300 millimeters to 1 meter in depth per hour unless an alternate form design is submitted and
 approved by the Engineer. Care shall be taken to avoid splashing the forms and reinforcing above the level of the concrete
 as placed. Beams and slabs shall be placed in one continuous operation.
 C. Consolidation.
 
 II.242
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 Each layer shall be thoroughly consolidated by rodding and vibration. The face of the forms shall be carefully
 spaded, if possible, to bring a dense mortar to the face, and produce a good finish.
 All concrete for masonry structures, unless otherwise directed, shall be compacted by means of approved
 mechanical vibrators operated within the mass of the concrete. The Contractor shall provide approved methods of
 vibration to fully consolidate the mix. Vibrators shall be of internal type of standard make and approved capacity, and
 shall be capable of transmitting vibrations of the concrete at frequencies of not less than 4500 impulses per minute.
 Vibration of forms or reinforcing shall not be permitted except where internal vibration is not practicable and
 then only with the approval of the Engineer.
 The vibrator shall be applied directly to the mass at the point and time of deposit and moved throughout the mass
 continuously from point to point in the mix using care to avoid over vibration, causing segregations, over finished surface
 and excess water gain. Vibrators shall not be used close to the forms.
 When concrete is placed in lifts, vibrators shall be inserted into at least half the depth of the underlying lift so as
 to thoroughly consolidate the two lifts into an integral mass without streaks or hardened lift lines. Vibrators shall not be
 used to move concrete in the forms.
 A sufficient number of vibrators shall be provided to obtain proper compaction in accordance with the rate of
 deposit.
 Extreme care shall be taken to prevent penetrating or disturbing previously placed concrete which has become
 partially set.
 D. Placing Concrete Under Water.
 Concrete may be deposited in water only when provided by the plans or in the Special Provisions or by approval
 in writing by the Engineer; and only under the direct supervision of the Engineer.
 The concrete shall be of the designation required except that an additional 10 percent of cement shall be added to
 all concrete deposited under water except that mass concrete shall be placed with the cement content required by Special
 Provisions.
 The method and equipment to be used shall be approved by the Engineer before work is begun.
 Concrete deposited under water shall be carefully placed in a compound mass in its final position and shall not be
 disturbed after being deposited. Special care must be taken to maintain still water at the point of deposit. No concrete
 shall be placed in running water and all form work designed to retain concrete under water shall be watertight. The
 consistency of the concrete shall be carefully regulated and special care shall be taken to prevent segregation of the
 materials. The concrete shall be distributed uniformly over the entire area between forms in order to maintain a level
 surface.
 The work shall be carried out in a continuous operation with sufficient rapidity to prevent the formation of layers
 or inclined seams. Concrete shall not be placed in water having a temperature below 2 °C. Pumping of water will not be
 permitted while the concrete is being deposited nor before it is sufficiently hardened.
 One of the following methods may be used:
 1. Bottom Dump Bucket.
 The bucket shall be open top type and have a capacity of not less than 1 cubic meter, and shall also be of a type
 that cannot be dumped until it rests on the surface on which the concrete is to be deposited. The bottom doors, when
 tripped, shall open freely downward and outward. The bucket shall be filled to strike-off capacity and shall be slowly
 lowered to avoid back wash. It shall then be raised very slowly as the concrete is discharged, only to the height necessary
 to permit emptying of the bucket, after which the bucket shall be slowly withdrawn to well above the surface of the water,
 in order to maintain, as nearly as possible, still water at the point of discharge and to avoid agitating the mixture. The
 bottom dump bucket shall not be used in a pile footing or where deposited through reinforcing steel.
 2. Tremie.
 The tremie shall be watertight, consisting of a tube constructed in sections with flange couplings fitted with
 gaskets, and the inside diameter shall be sufficiently large to permit a free flow of concrete. The spacing of tremie tubes
 shall not exceed 6 meters on centers or 3 meters from the forms. Tremie tubes shall not be moved horizontally or the seal
 purposely broken once placing of concrete is started.
 The radius of influence of a tremie shall not be assumed to exceed 3 meters. The means of supporting the tremie
 shall be as such as to permit it to be rapidly lowered when necessary to retard or stop the flow of concrete. The discharge
 end shall be closed at the start of the work so as to prevent water from entering the tube and shall be kept entirely sealed at
 all times and the tremie tube kept full to the bottom of the hopper during the depositing of the concrete. When a batch is
 dumped into the hopper the tremie shall be slightly raised, but not out of the concrete at the bottom, until the batch
 discharges to the bottom of the hopper. The flow shall then be stopped by lowering the tremie. Special care shall be taken
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.243
 
 to maintain as nearly as practicable a uniform flow and to avoid dropping the concrete through the water. The flow shall
 be continuous until the work is completed. If the charge is lost during depositing, the tremie shall be withdrawn and
 refilled.
 Dewatering may start when the concrete seal has reached a compressive strength of 8.5 megaPascals.
 All laitance and scale shall be removed so that sound, durable concrete is exposed to the area on which the
 construction is to be based and shall be leveled off with epoxy bonded concrete or mortar.
 E. Concrete Exposed to Sea Water.
 Concrete structures so located as to be subject to the action of sea water shall be constructed in a manner to
 provide a maximum resistance to its disintegrating action.
 The concrete shall be of the class required with an additional 10 percent of cement and shall be mixed for a
 period of time 50 percent more than the time specified in Subsection M4.02.10. The water content shall be carefully
 controlled and so regulated as to produce concrete of maximum impermeability. In placing concrete, care shall be taken
 to avoid the formation of pockets and the concrete shall be thoroughly compacted to the satisfaction of the Engineer. The
 original surface of the concrete shall be left undisturbed. In order to secure a thick and dense surface film, the surfaces of
 the forms shall be heavily coated with shellac or an approved form oil. The range of possible disintegration of the
 concrete from an elevation below that of low tide to an elevation above that of extreme high tide shall be determined by
 the Engineer, and, except with his/her special permission, no construction joints shall be located within this range. In the
 determination of this range, due consideration shall be given to wave action, ice formation and other conditions affecting
 the extreme limits of possible deterioration and disintegration.
 Concrete in sea water within the range as above determined shall, except when especially provided for by the
 plans or in the Special Provisions, be deposited in the dry and no sea water shall be allowed to come in direct contact with
 the concrete until it has been permitted to harden for at least 10 days and preferably for a longer period.
 901.66
 
 Joints.
 
 A. Construction Joints.
 Concrete in structures shall be placed in such a manner that all construction joints shall be exactly horizontal or
 vertical, as the case may be, and that they shall be straight and as inconspicuous as possible.
 When construction joints are definitely shown on the plans, all concrete between consecutive joints shall be
 placed in a continuous operation.
 In order to allow for shrinkage, concrete shall not be placed against the second side of the construction joints for
 at least 12 hours after that on the first side has been placed.
 Approval of the Engineer in writing must be secured before the placing of any construction joints not shown on
 the plans, except in case of emergency as specified in paragraph D hereinafter.
 The plans on which a day’s work is to terminate shall be predetermined before depositing of concrete begins.
 They shall in general be perpendicular to the lines of principal stress and in regions of small shears. Horizontal joints will
 not be permitted in concrete girders, beams, abutments, or retaining walls, unless otherwise indicated on the plans. Slabs
 acting with concrete beams or girders shall be place continuously as a unit, unless otherwise indicated on the plans.
 Unless otherwise indicated on the plans, interlocking or keying at construction joints shall be provided by use of
 keyways or dowels in a manner approved by the Engineer.
 Horizontal joints in piers or abutments shall generally be avoided and when used shall not be located within 1
 meter of normal water level.
 In piers or abutments or walls requiring a construction joint it shall generally be a keyed vertical joint extending
 the full height above the footing. In piers, abutments or retaining walls the second portion placed at a vertical joint shall
 be placed not earlier than 24 hours after the first portion is placed, except with special permission of the Engineer.
 Construction joints not shown on the plans and above ordinary low water level in abutments and retaining walls
 that retain earth fills shall have approved waterstops and shall be furnished at the Contractor’s expense.
 Joints in cantilevered members, unless shown on the plans, shall be avoided.
 When making a horizontal construction joint, care shall be taken to have the concrete below the joint as dry as
 possible and any excess water or creamy material shall be removed before the concrete sets. Within 12 hours after the
 concrete below the joint has been placed, the top surface shall be thoroughly cleaned by the use of wire brushes and all
 laitance and loose material removed so as to expose clean, solid concrete. Care must be taken not to loosen any of the
 course aggregate in the concrete. If for any reason this laitance is not removed before the concrete has hardened in place,
 it shall be removed using such tools and methods as may be necessary to secure the results specified above. Immediately
 
 II.244
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 before placing concrete above the joint, the surface of the concrete below the joint which has been cleaned as specified
 above shall be thoroughly wetted and coated with mortar of the same proportions used in the concrete. This mortar shall
 be thoroughly brushed into all openings and crevices with a stiff broom and new concrete shall be placed before this
 mortar has taken initial set. On all exposed surfaces, the line of the proposed joint shall be made truly straight by tacking a
 temporary horizontal straight edge on the inside of the form with its lower edge on the line of the joint and then placing the
 concrete sufficiently higher than this edge to allow for settlement. Immediately before placing the new concrete, the forms
 shall be drawn tightly against the concrete already in place.
 In construction joints, approved waterstops of plastic material shall be placed not less than
 75 millimeters from the face of concrete and shall extend a minimum of 65 millimeters into the concrete unless otherwise
 shown on plans.
 Prior to the use of plastic waterstops, the manufacturer’s installation instructions shall be furnished to the
 Engineer.
 B. Expansion Joints.
 Expansion joints constructed in bridges, walls and other structures shall be of the thickness shown and as located
 on the plans. The joint filler shall be cut to the same shape as the area to be covered except that it will be 5 millimeters
 smaller along all surfaces that will be exposed in the finished work unless shown otherwise on the plans. The filler shall
 be fixed firmly against the surface of the concrete already in place in such a manner that it will not be displaced when the
 concrete is deposited against it. When necessary to use more than one piece to cover any surface, the abutting pieces shall
 be placed in close contact and the joint between the separate pieces shall be covered with a layer of two-ply roofing felt,
 one side of which shall be covered with hot asphalt to insure proper adhesion. The 5 millimeter spaces along the edges at
 exposed faces shall be filled with wooden strips of the same thickness as the joint material. These wooden strips shall be
 saturated with oil and have sufficient draft to make them readily removable after the concrete is placed.
 Whatever material is used, the exposed edge of the filler shall be the finished edge as it comes from the fabricator
 in order to avoid exposure of material roughened by cutting. Each piece of filler shall be fastened to the concrete on one
 side of the joint with a single line of No. 10 gauge insulation nails 75 millimeters long and
 300 millimeters on centers.
 Immediately after forms are removed, the expansion joint shall be carefully inspected and any concrete or mortar
 that has sealed across the joint shall be cut neatly and removed. The outer edge of the joint shall be straight, parallel and
 satisfactory in appearance.
 In expansion joints, approved waterstops of plastic material shall be placed not less than 75 millimeters from the
 face of the concrete and shall extend a minimum of 115 millimeters into the concrete, measured from the center line of the
 joint, unless shown otherwise on the plans.
 Prior to the use of plastic waterstops, the manufacturer’s installation instructions shall be furnished to the
 Engineer.
 All surfaces to which sealants are to be applied shall be thoroughly cleaned to remove all loose concrete, dirt, oil,
 grease, paint, lacquer, rust, scales, bituminous or other foreign materials. Projections of concrete into joint space shall be
 removed. Steel surfaces shall be sandblasted or mechanically brushed to obtain a bright, clean, metal surface. Loose
 particles or dirt shall be removed and the joint shall be dried before application of primer and/or sealer. A bond breaker
 shall be used so that the joint sealer shall not be placed in direct contact with bituminous material or bituminous filler.
 A primer shall be used, when so designated in the manufacturer’s instructions. The sealant shall be mixed and
 applied in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Application shall be made only when air temperature is 10 °C
 or over. The sealant shall be installed in a neat and workmanlike manner to the depth specified on the plans. The sealant
 surface shall be either flush with, or be not more than 3 millimeters above adjacent joint surfaces.
 Any material that does not adhere or bond to the applied surface, or fails to set up properly, will be removed and
 replaced at the expense of the Contractor. Any material improperly mixed or which sets up before placement will likewise
 be rejected and be replaced at the expense of the Contractor.
 C. Bonding to Concrete Already Set.
 In bonding new concrete to concrete already set, the surface of the concrete shall be thoroughly cleaned,
 roughened, wetted with clean water, and then flushed with a mortar composed of equal parts of the cement and sand
 specified for the new concrete, before new concrete is placed adjacent thereto. New concrete shall be placed before
 mortar has taken initial set. In lieu of the mortar, an epoxy adhesive suitable for bonding fresh concrete to hardened
 concrete may be used. The epoxy adhesive shall be applied in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 D. Emergency.
 When the work of placing concrete is unexpectedly interrupted by breakdowns, storms or other causes and the
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.245
 
 concrete as placed would produce an improper construction joint, the Contractor shall form a construction joint to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer. When such a joint occurs at a section on which there is a shearing stress, the Contractor shall
 provide an adequate mechanical bond across the joint by forming a key, inserting reinforcing steel or by some other
 satisfactory means, which will prevent a plane of weakness.
 901.67
 
 Weep Holes and Drains.
 
 Weep holes shall be provided through all structures as indicated on the plans and as directed. Ends of weep
 holes that are to be covered by filling material shall be protected by 6.35 millimeter mesh galvanized wire screen 23 gauge
 and not less than one cubic meter of screened gravel or crushed stone conforming to Subsection M2.01.1.
 Drains shall be provided for bridge superstructures as indicated on the plans.
 901.68
 
 Protection, Curing and Finishing.
 
 A. Protection.
 Suitable precautions shall be taken to thoroughly protect the concrete from any damage by weather conditions or
 otherwise during and after placing.
 1. Hot and Dry Weather.
 During hot dry weather, and as directed, all new concrete shall be kept shaded from the sun, shielded from the
 wind and kept wet with water, or protected by other approved methods to retain the moisture in the concrete throughout
 the curing period.
 2. Rainy Weather.
 During rainy weather all new concrete shall be properly covered, as may be necessary to prevent damage.
 Sufficient approved material for covering shall be available at the site of the work for immediate use as may be needed.
 3. Cold Weather.
 During cold weather all new concrete shall be fully protected, by methods approved by the Engineer, until
 properly set and hardened to prevent damage. See Subsection 901.72.
 B. Curing.
 All concrete shall be kept fully saturated and protected against any drying action by methods of curing specified
 herein or as otherwise approved by the Engineer for not less than 5 days after placing standard cement concrete or for not
 less than 2 days after placing high early strength cement concrete.
 All surfaces of concrete which are to receive a rubbed surface finish or on which bitumen is to be placed, and
 concrete at construction joints and exposed bridge deck concrete shall be cured in accordance with requirements below for
 water curing. All other concrete may be cured in accordance with requirements below for water curing or waterproof
 membrane curing.
 1. Water Curing.
 Curing of concrete shall begin by fog spraying immediately after the initial set. Fog spraying shall continue until
 the burlap cover has been placed. The amount of fog spray shall be strictly controlled, so that accumulations of standing
 or flowing water on the surface of concrete shall not occur.
 Should atmospheric conditions render the use of fog spray impractical, the Contractor shall use plastic covers of
 suitable weight and securely weighed down, but not directly in contact with the deck concrete. The covers shall be used
 only until the initial set has taken place. The burlap covers shall be placed immediately thereafter. On the windward side
 of the panel being cured, the Contractor shall erect canvas barriers of suitable height when necessary to protect the curing
 concrete from the direct force of the wind.
 The area of concrete to be cured shall be covered by wet burlap blankets when concrete has set sufficiently, but
 in no case later than 5 hours after placing of concrete. Fog spray or covers shall be used continuously during this period.
 The materials for the coverings shall conform to the pertinent requirements for the same provided under
 Subsection M9.06.03. The coverings shall be kept thoroughly wet by sprinkling with a fine spray of water until they may
 be removed. Wooden forms without liners, if left in place longer than 2 days after the placing of the concrete, shall be
 thoroughly wet down at least once each day for the remainder of the required curing period. Formed surfaces shall, after
 the removal of forms, be cured in like manner for the remainder of the required period, the entire surface of the concrete
 being thoroughly drenched with water and covered immediately after the forms are removed. Portions of the covering
 material may be removed temporarily when and as necessitated by any required finishing or waterproofing operation.
 2. Impervious Liquid Membrane Curing.
 Immediately after the free water has disappeared on surfaces not protected by forms and immediately after the
 
 II.246
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 removal of forms, if such are removed before the end of the required curing period, the concrete shall be sealed by
 spraying as a fine mist a uniform application of the membrane curing material in a manner as to provide a continuous
 uniform, water impermeable film without marring or otherwise damaging the concrete. The impervious liquid membrane
 material used shall conform to the requirements for the same provided under Subsection M9.06.5 except that only
 AASHTO M 148, Type I shall be permitted.
 The membrane curing shall be applied in one or more separate coats at the rate of at least 3.0 liters per
 10 square meters. If, in the Engineer’s judgment, discontinuities or pinholes exist or if rain falls on the newly coated
 surface before the film has dried sufficiently to resist damage, an additional coat of the material shall be applied
 immediately to those affected areas at the specified rate. If a slight delay in application shall occur, which permits the
 concrete surface to dry, the surface of the concrete shall be thoroughly moistened with water, immediately prior to the
 application of the membrane curing material. Application of membrane curing may be delayed for 12 hours if the
 concrete surface is protected and kept moist by the use of wetted burlap.
 The membrane compound shall be thoroughly agitated immediately before application. The liquid shall be
 applied under pressure by means of an approved pressure spray which shall be held not more than
 600 millimeters away from the concrete and the spray protected from any wind by suitable means as may be necessary, so
 as to apply the material directly onto the concrete surface.
 The sprayed surface film shall be protected from abrasion or damage for the duration of the required curing
 period. The placing of materials or unnecessary walking on the surface will not be allowed until the film is at least 2 days
 old; and then only if no damage is caused to the surface film during the required curing time.
 3. Curing by Other Methods.
 a. Waterproof Paper. Subject to approval by the Engineer, waterproofed paper may be used for curing
 particular surfaces of concrete and, if allowed, shall be furnished and used entirely in accordance with the provisions for
 such under Subsection 476.74, except that the length of time for the curing period shall be as specified herein.
 b. Other methods of curing may be used only when approved in writing by the Engineer prior to any use in
 the work.
 C. Finishing.
 The external surface of all concrete shall be thoroughly vibrated and spaded during the operation of depositing
 the concrete by means of tools of an approved type. The vibrating and spading shall be such as to force all coarse
 aggregate away from the surface and slowly work the mortar against the forms to produce a smooth finish free from water
 and air pockets or honeycomb.
 Unless otherwise shown on the plans or provided in the Special Provisions, the final finish required on particular
 concrete shall be as follows:
 1. Formed Surfaces not Exposed to View.
 Immediately after forms have been removed and form ties cut back from the face of the concrete, all voids and
 cavities shall be filled with a stiff mortar of the same composition and air-entrainment as the mortar in the original
 concrete mix. The mortar for filling shall have been mixed and let set for 30 minutes and then remixed before placing in
 the work. In case the operation of filling is delayed, the surface of the concrete shall be thoroughly cleaned and washed
 with water, if necessary, before the mortar is applied.
 2. Formed Surfaces Exposed to View.
 Within 48 hours after the forms have been removed and form ties cut back from the face of the concrete, all fins,
 projections and irregularities shall be carefully removed and all voids and cavities shall be carefully and completely filled
 with a stiff mortar of the same composition and air-entrainment as the mortar in the original concrete mix. The same
 brand and color of cement, and the same kind and color of aggregate as was used in the original concrete mix shall be used
 in this mortar. The mortar for filling shall have been mixed and let set for 30 minutes and then remixed before placing in
 the work. The surface film of all such pointed surfaces shall be carefully removed before setting of the mortar occurs.
 If the Engineer determines these surfaces as prepared do not present a uniformly smooth, clean surface of even
 texture and appearance, the surface shall be treated and rubbed to obtain a satisfactory finish. The Engineer shall be the
 sole judge of the amount of rubbing which will be required.
 If rubbing is required, the rubbing will start with 48 hours of notification that rubbing is required, the surface
 should be wetted with clean water and rubbed with a No. 16 carborundum brick or other abrasive of equal quality until
 even and smooth and of uniform appearance, without applying any cement or other coating. If additional finishing is
 necessary it shall be obtained by a thorough rubbing with a No. 10 carborundum brick or other abrasive of equal quality.
 Subject to approval by the Engineer, rubbing may be performed by use of satisfactory power equipment and tools,
 providing that the operational procedures shall be the same as those outlined above for hand rubbing.

 II.247
 
 Rubbing will be kept to a minimum found necessary to produce smooth, even surfaces of uniform appearance.
 Rubbing will not be required to fill very small surface air bubble holes, to remove a uniform wood grain pattern left by
 forms, not to remove inconspicuous lines or marking between form panels. Rubbing will not be required for the underside
 of bridge decks.
 Patches required for form ties, if carefully and properly done, may not necessitate rubbing. If however, this work
 is done in such a manner that these patches are conspicuous, the entire exposed face on which they occur shall be rubbed.
 After the final rubbing is completed, and the mortar has set up, the surface shall be thoroughly drenched and kept
 wet with clean water for a period of 5 days, unless otherwise directed.
 No rubbing will be permitted when the air temperature is below 5 °C.
 3. The use of mortar, cement water mixture or neat cement for topping or treatment of any concrete surface
 will not be permitted.
 4. Bearing Areas for Superstructure Metal.
 The surfaces of concrete on bridge seats, piers and pedestals, which are to support shoes or bearing plates of the
 superstructure, unless otherwise shown on the plans, shall be finished 5 millimeters higher than the required elevations,
 over areas extending 75 millimeters outside of the shoes or bearing plates. After the concrete has been cured and
 thoroughly hardened, these areas shall be dressed down by tooling, rubbing, grinding, or otherwise, as may be approved,
 so as to provide true level surfaces at the required elevations. Satisfactory drainage shall be provided where necessary to
 prevent water accumulation at bearing areas.
 5. Sidewalks and Median Strips on Bridges.
 After being placed, the horizontal concrete surfaces shall be properly screeded and finished to true grade and
 surface. The finish shall be with an approved float, followed by light brushing with a fine brush but without the addition
 of any water to remove the cement film, leaving a fine grained, smooth but sanded texture. The surfaces shall then be
 cured as specified herein.
 6. Bridge Approach Slabs and Bridge Decks.
 (a) Bridge Approach Slabs. After concrete is placed, the top surface shall be struck off to the proper crown and
 longitudinal profile with an approved template. Satisfactory supports, furnished by the Contractor, shall be set and
 maintained in place for proper operation of the template so that the surface shall be furnished to the required elevations.
 These supports shall be carefully removed from the concrete before any set of the concrete occurs, and the spaces left by
 such removal shall be immediately filled and finished to the level of the adjacent surfaces. The surface shall be checked,
 by means of an approved straight-edge (not less than 3 meters in length), furnished by the Contractor, as the Engineer may
 direct. Any irregularities, measuring more than
 5 millimeters vertically, shall be corrected and the whole surface shall be made smooth and even. No load of any kind
 shall be placed on the concrete after setting of the concrete has begun, and any work on the concrete then required shall be
 performed from approved bridges furnished by the Contractor, which will not rest on the new concrete in any manner.
 Where membrane waterproofing is to be used the surface of the concrete shall be screeded to the true cross
 section and left without any projections that might puncture the membrane or depressions that could retain liquid.
 (b) Bridge Decks. The placing and finishing of these surfaces shall be performed as specified herein.
 (1) The Contractor shall submit for approval by the Engineer a detailed schedule showing the time schedule and
 the sequence he/she intends to use in placing of deck concrete. Also at least 15 days before the erection of screed rails, the
 Contractor shall submit his/her screed erection plans and details for review and approval by the Engineer. These plans
 shall also include details of finishing operation equipment and equipment for placement of the concrete.
 No concrete shall be placed in any part of the work until steel reinforcement, shear connectors, anchors, drainage
 piping, conduit lines, etc. have been inspected and approved by the Engineer. The Contractor shall schedule his/her work
 in such a manner that all forms and reinforcement and other appurtenances shall be set by him/her, and checked by the
 Engineer on the day preceding the day of pour. The daily placement for the deck slab shall begin early in the morning.
 (2) Setting Screed Rails and Checking of Reinforcement Bars.
 (a) The screed rails and their support shall be of steel and be accurately set so that the finished surface shall
 conform to the profiles shown on the plans. The supports shall be adjustable, of substantial construction, and shall be
 placed and adjusted to properly provide for the deflection of forms, supporting beams, falsework, floor beam stringers and
 weight of finishing machine which may occur during placement of concrete. The supports shall be placed in order to fit
 the concrete placing procedures and furnish continuity in the required contours for the finished surface. All screed support
 devices which are to be left embedded in the concrete shall be either epoxy coated or galvanized in accordance with
 Subsection 960.64.
 (b) Prior to the placing of the concrete all reinforcing bars shall be rigidly tied to their supports after being
 
 II.248
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 accurately positioned with proper clearances from the final surfaces of the concrete. The required concrete cover over the
 top bars shall be checked by riding the screed over the bars and measuring the distance from bottom of screed to top of
 bars every 3 meters longitudinally and all bars transversely. Discrepancies which are in excess of 5 millimeters shall be
 rectified by repositioning the top bars to secure the required cover.
 (3) Placing of Concrete.
 Concrete shall be placed in a uniform manner across the entire width being cast. Dumping of mix in
 concentrated accumulations shall be avoided. Concrete shall be uniformly placed in front of the screed so that moving of
 the concrete is kept to a minimum.
 Concrete shall not be placed when the ambient temperature is below 5 °C, except as stipulated in Section 901.72,
 or above 30 °C. At no time shall the internal temperature of the concrete being placed be higher than 21 °C.
 (4) Finishing of Concrete.
 (a) Only mechanized methods of finishing the freshly placed concrete shall be allowed except at locations
 inaccessible for mechanical screed and only when approved by the Engineer. Machine finishing of deck slab will not be
 required in areas outside of curb line, which will support the second lift of concrete for sidewalks, safety curbs, medians or
 barriers.
 (b) Finishing Machines shall be mechanically operated, of rigid construction, riding on rails placed parallel to
 the bridge centerline and securely fastened to the supporting steel. They shall be of an approved type and shall be
 operated such that, when concrete is properly consolidated and finished, the surface of the concrete will be at the elevation
 indicated on the plans, or ordered by the Engineer. The finishing machine shall be set on the screed rails and be aligned
 parallel to abutments and piers and shall not be so light that it tends to ride the concrete rather than the rails. Only two
 passes of screed will be allowed over a given area of deck, and the lap of consecutive passes shall be limited to a
 minimum.
 (c) After the concrete has been struck off it shall be further smoothed by means of a longitudinal float of
 suitable design approved by the Engineer. The float shall be worked from a bridge with a dragging motion while held in
 position parallel to the road centerline, and passed gradually from one side of the deck to the other. Where membrane
 waterproofing is to be used, the surface of the concrete shall be checked to ensure that it is without any projections that
 might puncture the membrane or depressions that could retain liquid.
 (d) Where the surface of the concrete is to be used as the riding surface for traffic, once all the irregularities
 have been removed, a wet burlap bag consisting of a double thickness of approved burlap without seams and about 1
 meter in drag width and long enough to span the entire width of surface being finished shall be pulled along the surface in
 a longitudinal sweeping manner by workers operating from outside the edges of the pavement, or such a burlap drag may
 be attached to the finishing machine. Where narrow areas adjacent to edges of surface have not been reached in the
 aforementioned operation, they shall be satisfactorily finished with approved burlap as directed by the Engineer.
 The pavement wearing surface shall then be given a final finish by pulling a light broom (about
 750 millimeters wide and having two thin rows of flat bristles) gently and squarely across the surface from one edge to the
 other so as to remove any laitance and other surface blemishes and so as to produce uniform corrugations, not more than 3
 millimeters in depth. Walking on the fresh surface of the concrete shall not be permitted.
 (e) Where the deck slab will support a sidewalk, safety curb, median or barrier, the surface of the concrete will
 be finished as follows. A 25 millimeter wide strip immediately adjacent to the curb and coping lines will be given a
 smooth tooled finish. The remainder of the concrete surface will be raked to a maximum
 6 millimeter amplitude parallel with the curb line.
 (f) As specified herein and as may be found further necessary, in the judgment of the Engineer, any required
 work of finishing shall be done from adequate bridges furnished by the Contractor and they shall not be in contact with the
 surface of the concrete in any manner.
 (g) While the concrete is still plastic the surface of the pavement shall be tested with a 3 meters straight-edge
 attached to a handle of sufficient length to permit testing of the full width of the slab. The straight-edge shall be laid
 parallel to the centerline of the pavement and any irregularity of 3 millimeters or greater shall be corrected immediately.
 (h) Within 24 hours after completion and hardening the surface shall again be checked by the Contractor in the
 presence of the Engineer, with the straight-edge held parallel to the centerline, and variations exceeding 3 millimeters shall
 be plainly marked and shall be corrected at the Contractor’s expense in a manner satisfactory to the Engineer.
 (i) Hand Finishing. When hand finishing is used the surface of the concrete shall be struck off by means of a
 wooden or steel template of approved section. The template shall be constructed to produce the desired surface contour
 and have sufficient strength to retain its strength under all working conditions. For its proper use, the template should be
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.249
 
 at least 600 millimeters longer than the width of the surface to be struck off. In general, vibrating templates shall be used
 for this operation. Subject to prior approval by the Engineer, non-vibrating templates may be used; the approval for such
 use to depend on the extent of the work and design requirements.
 Satisfactory supports, furnished by the Contractor, shall be set and maintained in place for proper operation of
 the template so that the surface of the concrete shall be finished to the required elevations for the finished surface. The
 supports shall be carefully removed from the concrete as soon as possible during the finishing operations, and the spaces
 left by such removal shall be immediately filled and finished to the level of the adjacent surface.
 After the concrete has been deposited, spread and consolidated as required herein, it shall be struck off
 immediately with the template above the grade so that there will be sufficient concrete to fill low and porous spots. The
 template shall be operated by moving forward with a combined longitudinal and transverse motion and so manipulated
 that it bears fully on the control supports. A slight excess of material shall be kept in front of the cutting edge. The
 concrete shall be worked so as to embed coarse aggregate and to remove porous spots but not so as to force excess mortar
 or water to the surface. Low spots shall be filled and the material worked into place. The resulting surface shall be only
 slightly above the required grade and shall be uniform in appearance, density and composition.
 The concrete shall then be brought to the required grade and density, and all surplus material removed, by
 striking off the concrete with the template in the operational manner required above except that the template shall be held
 firmly on the supports and operated in a slow, even speed. Finishing with the template and removing of any projections or
 depressions shall be continued until the required surface is obtained.
 As soon as possible after finishing as specified, the surface of the concrete shall be finished in accordance with
 the operations and requirements prescribed herein after completion of the machine finishing under the subsection
 “Machine Finishing.”
 Satisfactory supports, furnished by the Contractor, shall be set and maintained in place for proper operation of the
 machines so that the surface of the concrete shall be finished to the required elevations.
 Unless otherwise shown on the plans, the roadway concrete shall be placed and finished the entire width of the
 roadway area. When shown on the plans, longitudinal keyed and reinforced construction joints shall be constructed at
 such locations and in accordance with the details required by the plans or as approved by the Engineer.
 901.69
 
 Removal of Forms and Loading on Structures.
 
 The word forms as used herein shall include all supports of the actual forms enclosing the concrete.
 The forms for any portion of the structure shall not be removed until the concrete is strong enough, as determined
 by the Engineer, to avoid possible injury from such removal. Forms shall not be removed or disturbed without the prior
 approval of the Engineer. Form (supports) shall be removed in such a manner as to permit the concrete to uniformly and
 gradually take the stresses due to its own weight.
 When test cylinders are taken from the concrete in the members of a structure, the forms shall be left in place
 until the concrete has attained the strength designated in the following table, and, regardless of strength attained, for the
 minimum period indicated. In the absence of cylinder tests, the forms shall remain in place for the period specified under
 minimum loading period. However, in order to facilitate any particular finishing operations, side forms carrying no load
 may be removed 24 hours to 72 hours (depending on weather conditions and class of concrete) after the placing of the
 concrete has been completed, subject to the approval of the Engineer and with the complete curing process to be continued
 as required.
 No superimposed load of any kind or for any purpose will be allowed on a structure before the expiration of the
 period of time prescribed in the table, whether or not the forms have been removed, except as follows:
 (A) A superimposed live load not exceeding 2400 kilograms, operated at a speed not to exceed
 8 kilometers per hour, may be allowed on bridge deck concrete 5 days after standard cement concrete is placed and 3 days
 after high early strength cement concrete is placed provided the concrete has reached a compressive strength of 23
 megaPascals.
 (B) A superimposed dead load mass not exceeding 39 kilograms per square meter may be allowed under the
 same time and strength requirements as for a live load, provided the load is placed near the ends of the beam spans.
 Where possible, the load shall be spread over two or more beams.

 In case a particular increase in strength of concrete in a particular period of time is required by the Contract, or is
 directed or approved by the Engineer, and is between the strength attained by the use of standard cement concrete and the
 strength attained by the use of high early strength cement concrete, the time periods as required in the tables above shall be
 adjusted proportionally to fit the particular time in which the stated strength is attained by such procedure. The strength
 shall be attained by an extra amount of Standard Cement or by the use of particular elements of approved admixtures.
 The time requirements provided in both the above tables date from the complete placing of concrete in the
 member, and are the minimum requirements for the most favorable weather conditions. Longer periods, as directed by the
 Engineer, will be required to compensate adequately for adverse weather conditions.
 For a concrete deck supported on steel stringer beams or floor beams, the span will be considered as the distance
 between center of beams. For composite concrete and steel beams the span governing the “Minimum Days for Forms in
 Place” shall be the distance between center of beams, and the span governing the “Minimum Days Before Design
 Loading” shall be the distance between the center lines of main bearings. For concrete slabs, T-beams, and girders the
 distance shall be between center lines of main bearings; and for arches and rigid frames, the distance between springing
 lines.
 If a placing sequence is not stated on the plans or in the Special Provisions of a contract which includes the
 construction of a continuous span structure, the forms for the entire continuous group shall remain in place until every span
 of the group has been supported for the minimum required period of time.
 No backfill or any other operation that could in any way cause stress in the concrete shall begin prior to the
 period of time required before loading of the structure.
 Any defective work discovered after the forms have been removed shall be immediately removed and replaced.
 If the surface of the concrete is bulged, uneven or show excessive voids or form joint marks which cannot be repaired
 satisfactorily, the entire section shall be removed and replaced. All repairs and renewals due to defective work shall be
 done at the expense of the Contractor.
 901.70
 
 Protection of Pipes and Conduits.
 
 The Contractor shall care for and protect from injury all pipes, wires and conduits encountered in the work by
 furnishing and maintaining suitable supports, including steel bars, where directed on the bridge during construction.
 The Contractor shall provide suitable openings in the abutments, walls, piers, and superstructures as shown on the
 plans and as may be directed. If required, the opening shall be filled with brick masonry in a satisfactory manner.
 901.71
 
 Date, Seal, Bench Marks and Ornaments.
 
 A. Date.
 The Contractor shall place a date on bridges as shown on the plans or as directed. The date shall be cast or cut in
 masonry as directed. Detail drawings of the date will be furnished by the Department.
 B. Seal.
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.251
 
 If indicated on the plans, the Contractor shall place a bronze replica of the State Seal on Bridges, as directed by
 the Engineer. The seal will be furnished by the Department.
 C. Ornaments.
 Concrete ornaments shall be furnished and placed by the Contractor on bridges when indicated on the plans. The
 ornamental castings may be either cast in place or precast.
 901.72
 
 Concrete Construction During Cold Weather.
 
 Any concrete placed during cold weather shall be placed at the Contractor’s risk and any damage or
 unsatisfactory concrete shall be removed and replaced at the Contractor’s expense. Concrete mixed or placed when the air
 temperature is below 5° C will be considered cold weather concrete and will require special treatment. In general the
 special treatment is indicated below.
 No concrete shall be placed when the atmospheric temperature in the shade and away from artificial heat is below
 2° C or when the temperature may be expected to drop below -1° C within 24 hours, except upon permission in writing by
 the Engineer, which shall not be granted until satisfactory provisions have been made to protect the work.
 If the air temperature in the shade and away from artificial heat may be expected to reach 5 °C or lower at any
 time during the day or night of the 24 hours following the placing of the concrete, protective cover, heating or protective
 cover and heating will be required on all exposed surfaces. When the air in the shade and away from artificial heat is 5 °C
 or lower temperature, the mixing water and/or aggregates may be heated (prior to cement being added) by approved
 methods so that the temperature of the aggregates and water mixture is not less than 20 °C nor more than 60 °C. The
 temperature of the concrete shall not be less than 15 °C nor more than 30 °C at the time of placing it in the forms. The
 heating shall be done in a manner to preclude the occurrence of overheated areas which might result in damage to the
 materials. Any material containing frost or lumps of hardened material shall not be used.
 Where it may be expected that considerable heat will be generated by the hydration of the concrete, and in some
 cases where heat is not rapidly dissipated, suitable coverings shall be used to protect concrete. Heavy footings in which
 the concrete is placed at a temperature of 20 °C and protected by the surrounding earth, except on top, shall be protected
 down to an air temperature of about -10 °C by a tarpaulin placed over the top with an air space between the concrete and
 the tarpaulin. Mass concrete, when concrete as such is so specified on the plans or so defined by the Engineer, may be
 protected down to an air temperature of about,
 -7 °C by enclosure with tight wooden forms at least 16 millimeters in thickness and the concrete is placed at a temperature
 of 20 °C except at corners and edges. Double sheating, insulation board or tarpaulins with a dead air space between the
 covering and the forms shall be placed to equally protect such edges and corners. Enclosures and added artificial heat will
 be required for such concrete placed at lower air temperatures.
 The Contractor shall have readily available for installing on the work adequate material for the proper enclosure
 or covering of the concrete together with adequate equipment for satisfactory heating as may be necessary.
 As much as possible of any enclosure for protection shall be in place before depositing of any concrete and the
 remainder shall be installed as rapidly as possible in order to reduce heat losses to a minimum.
 The temperature of the concrete inside the enclosure shall be held above a minimum temperature of
 10 °C and the air surrounding the fresh concrete shall be kept a temperature within a 10 °C to 25 °C range. The
 temperature of the concrete shall be maintained above 20 °C for the first three days or above 10 °C for the first five days
 after the concrete is completed in place, except periods of time may be reduced when satisfactory strength is attained
 sooner, as with the use of high early strength cement concrete, then a minimum of 20 °C for two days or 10 °C for four
 days will be required. In any case the periods of time provided above are minimum requirements and extensions of these
 periods of time will be required provided that such may be necessary to develop satisfactory strength in the concrete.
 After the concrete has been cured for the required length of time, the temperature within the housing shall be
 gradually reduced no faster than 0.5 °C per hour until it equals the surrounding air temperatures.
 Heating within the enclosure shall be attained by such means of artificial heat as will maintain the temperatures
 specified continuously and with a reasonable degree of uniformity in all parts of the enclosures. All exposed surfaces of
 concrete within the enclosure shall be kept sufficiently moist to prevent any rapid drying of the surface concrete with
 possible resulting damage to the concrete in place. Heating appliances shall not be placed in such a manner as to endanger
 the enclosure, forms or supports, or expose any area of concrete to rapid drying out or other injury due to excessive
 temperatures.
 Should the Contractor wish to secure permission to use other methods than those provided above for protective
 retaining of heat within the concrete or direct protective heating of the concrete by adequate facilities for same, such
 
 II.252
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 request shall be made in writing by him/her to the Engineer and shall include verifiable evidence of satisfactory results
 obtained by use of such methods. Other methods than those provided herein shall not be used unless approved in writing
 by the Engineer, and then only under the full responsibility of the Contractor.
 901.73
 
 Concrete Penetrant/Sealer.
 
 Concrete penetrant/sealer shall be applied to bridge copings, beam seats, parapets, end posts, median barriers and
 other cement concrete surfaces as designated and shown on the plans and in accordance with these and the manufacturer’s
 specifications. This work shall consist of furnishing all necessary labor, materials and equipment to treat concrete
 surfaces, including surface preparation and application.
 The concrete penetrant/sealer shall conform to M9.15.0. Clear concrete penetrant/sealers after complete
 application, shall not stain, discolor or darken the concrete to any appreciable degree. Application of the penetrant/sealer
 shall not alter the surface texture and shall be compatible with the use of surface finish coatings and/or caulkings. The
 surface shall dry to a tack free condition. Application of the penetrant/sealer shall be in accordance with the
 manufacturer’s recommendations, including condition and preparation of surfaces to be treated.
 The preparation process shall not cause any undue damage to the concrete surface, remove or alter the existing
 surface finish, or expose the coarse aggregate of the concrete.
 Concrete surfaces prepared for treatment shall be approved by the Engineer.
 The concrete penetrant/sealer shall be used as supplied by the manufacturer and not diluted or altered in any way.
 The penetrant/sealer shall be applied onto the concrete surfaces at the manufacturer’s recommended rate of coverage.
 Manufacturer’s safety precautions shall be strictly adhered to.
 The Contractor shall exercise all reasonable precaution to prevent the penetrant/sealer from coming in contact
 with any joint sealers, so as to prevent any possible loss of bond of the joint sealer.
 901.74
 
 Dowel Bar Splicer/Reinforcing Bar Splicer.
 
 Dowel Bar Splicer/Reinforcing Bar Splicer, a mechanical device to join steel reinforcing bars, shall meet the
 following requirements:
 1. All mechanical splicers shall develop, as required, at least 125% of the specified yield strength of steel
 reinforcing in tension and compression. Reinforcing Bar Splicers which have been tested and approved and are on the
 approved products list are acceptable for use on Massachusetts Highway Department bridge projects. A copy of the
 approved product list may be obtained from the Department’s Research and Materials Section.
 2. Equivalent Joining devices may be used but they must be submitted to the MHD Research and Material
 Laboratory for testing and approval. The contract time shall not be extended to allow for the above testing and approval
 process.
 3. Special consideration shall be given to the minimum concrete cover requirements over stirrups, ties and
 spirals at the reinforcing bar splicer locations. All portions of the reinforcing bar Splicer shall meet the cover requirements
 as specified in construction drawings.
 4. During testing, ultimate testing failure must occur in the reinforcing bar being joined, rather than the joining
 device. The mechanical connection device must not introduce notch effects that would cause the bar to rupture at the
 mechanical connection device before the required yielding can occur in the adjoining bar stock. Assembly features shall
 provide for reasonably error free work under construction conditions.
 5. Reinforcing Bar Splicers shall be tested with epoxy coated reinforcing steel, and the final assembly shall be
 in conformance with the specifications for epoxy coating. The Engineer will be the sole judge for the above criteria.

 Method of Measurement.
 
 Cement concrete masonry will be measured by the cubic meter and the quantity shall be determined in
 accordance with dimensions shown on the plans and such alteration of the plans as are specifically ordered by the Engineer
 in writing. No deduction shall be made in bridges for rustications, chamfered corners of dimensions less than 100
 millimeters on the square sides, or for the volume of pipes less than 500 millimeters in diameter, drainage inlets, or for
 anchor bolts or reinforcing bars. The volume occupied by pipe culverts in headwalls shall be deducted.

 II.253
 
 Reinforcement for cement concrete masonry structures shall be measured by the kilogram. The mass of bars
 shall be the product of the length as shown on the approved plans and schedules and the standard mass per meter of length
 as adopted by the Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute. Wire, metal clips, metal chairs or other fastening and supporting
 devices used for keeping the reinforcement continuous and in correct position will not be considered reinforcement and the
 Contractor will receive no additional compensation for their use.
 The mass of wire mesh (incorporated in the structure) shall be the computed mass in accordance with the plans
 based on the standard mass accepted by the trade for the unit area of the particular mesh.
 901.81
 
 Basis of Payment.
 
 Cement concrete masonry will be paid for at the contract unit price per cubic meter under the particular item of
 Cement Concrete Masonry of the Class required, as shown on the plans or as directed, complete in place and accepted.
 The Contractor shall have no claims for special allowances for extra cement or apparent shrinkage due to
 inaccurate proportioning or control, bulging of forms, spilling, waste or for any other project conditions within his/her
 control.
 Payment for additional cement required to be used in proportioning by volume and in placing of concrete under
 water shall be included in the contract unit price paid for the particular designation of cement concrete masonry specified
 or directed.
 When high early strength cement concrete masonry is used (where originally standard cement concrete was
 specified) by order of the Engineer after the Contract has been executed, the Contractor will be paid in addition to the
 contract unit price for such standard cement concrete masonry the sum of $5.00 per cubic meter for all high early strength
 cement concrete masonry as is so directed to be used. When the contract has specified that high early strength cement
 concrete shall be used, or if the Contractor is permitted to choose such concrete as an option, then no additional payment
 will be made for such concrete.
 Latex Modified Mortar and Concrete Overlayments will be paid for at the contract unit price per square meter,
 complete in place and accepted including surface preparation.
 Steel reinforcement including wire mesh will be paid for at the contract unit price per kilogram under the item for

 CONSTRUCTION METHODS
 930.60
 
 General.
 
 Prestressed concrete beams shall be installed to the line and grade shown on the plans in accordance with the
 Contractor’s approved erection procedures and in accordance with relevant provisions of these Standard Specifications.
 The prestressed concrete beams shall not be shipped for a minimum of 14 days from casting. Beams shall not be
 stacked on top of each other either at the fabricator’s yard, during transit or at the site. At all times blocking shall be
 located at the center line of bearing of the beam. The bridge seats for the elastomeric bearings shall be prepared in
 accordance with Section 901.68, C., 4. Bearing Areas for Superstructure Metal.
 930.61
 
 Erection.
 
 Within sixty days of the date of the Notice to Proceed, the Contractor shall submit an erection procedure. The
 submitted method of erection is subject to review, comment, and approval by the Engineer. The method must be
 submitted with detailed procedures which include drawings and calculations sufficient to enable the Engineer to determine
 the adequacy of the proposed method.
 The preparation and submission of this erection procedure, including the information and calculations to be
 provided, shall be in accordance with the relevant requirements of Section 960.61, D. Erection, for beams and girders.
 The prestressed concrete beams shall be lifted only by the lifting hooks, and the utmost care shall be taken to
 prevent distortion of the beams during handling, transportation or storage. Under no circumstances are the beams to be
 handled in other than an upright position. The design of the lifting hooks shall be the responsibility of the Fabricator of
 the beams. The lifting hooks shall be designed to meet the requirements for lifting devices as specified under Section
 960.61, D. Erection.
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.255
 
 Suitable spreaders shall be used during lifting so that only a vertical pull will be made on the hooks. A nonvertical lifting force may be permitted if prior written approval is given by the Engineer. This approval will be contingent
 on the Contractor demonstrating by calculations, prepared by a Professional Engineer registered in Massachusetts, that the
 beams will not be damaged by the non-vertical lifting force and by documentation that the capacity of the lifting hooks is
 adequate for the non-vertical lifting force.
 930.62
 
 Butted Prestressed Concrete Deck and Box Beams.
 
 A. Beam Layout.
 Prior to erection, the location of the beams on the abutments and piers shall be layed out according to the
 nominal width of the beams as shown on the plans. Each beam will be erected such that the distance from its edge to the
 corresponding nominal width line shall be as shown on the plans everywhere along the entire length of the beam. After
 erection, the beam shall lie entirely within the horizontal lines defined by its nominal width for its entire length and shall
 not infringe on the space allocated for any adjacent beam.
 After all beams are erected, the actual overall width of the butted deck assembly shall not deviate from the
 nominal dimension shown on the framing plan by more than +0, – 30 millimeters.
 B. Mortaring Keyways.
 The keyways shall not be filled until 28 days have elapsed from casting of the youngest beam in the butted
 assembly except under the following condition. If the beams have been cast in a continuous sequence and adjacent beams
 are not more than two days different in age, then keyways may be filled after 14 days have elapsed since casting of the
 youngest beam.
 Mortar (M4.04.0) shall be placed in strict accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations and instructions.
 The keyways shall be filled flush to the top of the beams and any vertical misalignment between beams shall be
 feathered out on a slope of 1:10 (1 vertical to 10 horizontal). Curing shall be performed in strict accordance with the
 manufacturer’s recommendations. The keyways shall not be filled in cold weather when either the ambient temperature or
 the precast member’s temperature is below the mortar manufacturer’s recommendation. No localized heating of either the
 precast members or of the air surrounding the keyway will be permitted in an attempt to reach application temperatures.
 No vehicular or construction traffic will be allowed on the bride until the mortar has attained its full strength.
 C. Traverse Tie Tensioning.
 Unless shown otherwise on the plans, the ties shall be tensioned to 20 kiloNewtons before the keyways are filled.
 After the keyways are filled with mortar (M4.04.0) and the mortar has cured, the ties shall be tensioned to 135
 kiloNewtons.
 If the plans show that the ties are to be tensioned before mortaring, then the strands shall be tensioned to 135
 kiloNewtons with multipolymer (plastic) shims in place as shown on the plans to maintain a uniform joint width. If
 excessive time elapses between the tensioning of the ties and the mortaring of the keyways, the Contractor shall verify that
 the 135 kiloNewton post tension force is still in the strand.
 D. Closure Pour for Continuity.
 Prior to erecting the beams, the restraint key cast into the top of the pier cap shall be lined with closed cell foam
 to the limits and thickness shown on the plans.
 The concrete for the closure pour shall not be placed until after the keyway mortar has cured and the transverse
 ties have been fully tensioned. The pier cap restraint key shall be cleaned of all loose and extraneous material prior to
 placing the concrete. Stytofoam shall be placed outside of the restraint key as shown on the plans to prevent the closure
 pour concrete from coming in contact with the pier cap itself.
 E. Final Deck Assembly Work.
 After the final deck assembly has been accepted by the Engineer, the lifting hooks shall be cut off below the top
 of the beam, and the recesses shall be filled with mortar (M4.02.15). The Contractor shall also remove projections and fill
 all depressions in the tops of the beams with mortar (M4.02.15).
 After all mortar has cured, the Engineer shall inspect and approve the surface of the deck assembly before the
 Contractor will be permitted to apply the membrane waterproofing in accordance with the requirements of Section 965,
 System 3 - Preformed Sheet Membranes.
 F. Backwalls, Curtain Walls and Keeper Blocks.
 The backwalls, the curtain walls at the abutment bridge seats, and the keeper blocks shall be cast only after the
 deck assembly has been accepted. Closed cell foam shall be attached to the bridge structure to the limits and thickness as
 shown on the plans and the backwall/curtain wall/keeper block concrete shall be placed directly against it.
 
 II.256
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 The sidewalk, safety curb or barrier sections may be cast after the curtain walls and exterior pier keeper blocks
 have been cast. In this case, the curtain walls and keeper blocks shall be accurately formed above the beams to the shape
 and dimensions of the coping, including the thickness of the closed cell foam, as shown on the plans. Closed cell foam
 will be attached to the curtain wall/keeper block prior to placing the coping concrete.
 930.63
 
 Prestressed I-Beam, Bulb Tee, and Spread Box Beam Sections.
 
 Anchor bolts, where called for on the plans, shall be set as follows: in piers, anchor bolts shall be accurately set
 by template prior to placing concrete; in abutments, anchor bolts may be set by template or by drilling and grouting.
 Grout shall be a non-shrink type.
 Keeper blocks on the abutments and pier caps, where called for on the plans, shall be cast after the beams have
 been erected. Closed cell foam of the thickness shown on the plans shall be attached to sides of the beam within the limits
 of the keeper blocks prior to placing the concrete.
 As beams are being erected, temporary blocking or bracing shall be installed at the ends of the beams to prevent
 the beams from accidentally rotating and tipping over. The detail for this bracing shall be included with the erection
 procedure submittal.
 After the reinforced concrete diaphragms have been poured and allowed to reach a minimum of 70% of the
 required 28 day strength, the temporary bracing may be removed. In addition, the placement of the deck concrete will not
 be permitted until these concrete diaphragms have been installed and have reached this minimum strength.
 The top of the beam shall be clean, free of all laitance and shall have a rough surface raked across the width of
 the beam. Deck concrete shall be placed against the beam concrete without the use of any bonding agents.

 Special care shall be used in the storage and handling of piles to avoid damage.
 The method of handling of precast-prestressed concrete piling shall prevent cracking or fracture by impact or
 induced bending stresses. At the discretion of the Engineer, cracked or fractured piling shall be either rejected or repaired
 with epoxy. Fine cracks, which do not extend to the reinforcing steel as determined by the Engineer, will neither require
 repair or be cause for rejection. The Contractor’s proposed method for repair with epoxy or the like shall be submitted to
 the Engineer for approval.
 E. Pile Shoes and Tips.

 CONSTRUCTION METHODS
 940.50
 
 Equipment for Driving Piles.
 
 940.51
 
 Hammers.
 
 A. General.
 Piles shall be driven by approved power hammers or by a combination of jetting and power hammers. Power
 hammers include single, double and differential acting air or steam hammers, and open or closed-end diesel hammers.
 Drop (Gravity) hammers may be used with the written permission of the Engineer to drive timber piles.
 Valve mechanisms and other parts of power hammers shall be maintained in good condition. Hammers shall be
 capable of delivering the manufacturer’s rated energy and shall be operated at the manufacturer’s specified maximum
 blows per minute. Power sources such as steam boilers and air compressors shall be capable of continuously maintaining
 the hammer manufacture’s recommended pressure and flow rate at the intake of the hammer. Boilers and Compressors
 shall be equipped with pressure gauges or other devices, calibrated against the rated hammer energy. When directed by
 the Engineer, a gauge readable from the ground surface shall be provided at the hammer intake to determine the actual
 pressure delivered to the hammer.
 The Contractor shall equip open-end diesel hammers with a calibrated scale to enable accurate observation of
 ram stroke from the ground surface.
 The Contractor shall also provide the Engineer a chart from the hammer manufacturer equating stroke and blows
 per minute for the open-end diesel hammer to be used.
 Double acting diesel hammers (closed-end) shall be equipped with a gauge to measure pressure in the bounce
 chamber. The gauge shall be readable from the ground surface. Alternatively the gauge can be equipped with a hose
 sufficiently long to enable reading on the ground surface. The gauge and hose assembly shall be calibrated to allow for
 losses in the hose. The Contractor shall provide charts relating the throttle setting and/or bounce chamber pressure to
 rated hammer energy.
 B. Minimum Energy Requirements.
 Power Hammers shall have a ram mass of not less than 900 kilograms and shall develop not less than
 8000 joules of energy per blow. When driving to final resistance, the total energy in joules to drive the pile the last 150
 millimeters shall not exceed 1700 times the pile tip diameter in millimeters.
 Drop (Gravity) Hammers may be used only with the written permission of the Engineer. Such hammers shall
 have a mass of between 900 and 1600 kilograms, but in no case shall the mass of the hammer be less than the combined
 mass of driving head and pile. The fall shall be so regulated as to avoid damage to the pile and in no case shall exceed 4.5
 meters.
 To control excessive stress in concrete piling during driving, the Engineer may require:
 1. Increase in cushion thickness, or change the materials comprising the cushion,
 2. Reduction of ram stroke,
 3. Reduced ram stroke for driving through very soft soil and increased ram stroke as soil resistance increases,
 4. Combination of increased cushion thickness and reduced ram stroke,
 5. Combination of increased cushion thickness and shorter stroke, or
 6. Use of pilot holes or jetting when driving through hard or alternating hard and soft strata.
 C. Submittals.
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.259
 
 The Contractor shall submit to the Engineer for approval, a description of the proposed driving equipment with
 manufacturer’s specifications. The equipment description shall include hammer type, hammer cushion, drivehead, and
 pile cushion, etc. as contained in the “Pile and Driving Equipment Data Form” included in the contract documents or
 supplied by the Engineer.
 D. Approval Criteria.
 Power hammers shall have an energy rating that will provide the required pile capacity with a penetration
 resistance between 20 and 50 blows per 100 millimeters. The energy required for these rates shall be determined by the
 formula given in Section 940.61A for piles with a required capacity less than
 450 kiloNewtons. For piles with required capacity over 450 kiloNewtons, or as directed by the Engineer, the Contractor
 shall submit to the Engineer the results of a Wave Equation Analysis performed in accordance with Section 940.61B for
 the proposed driving equipment. The analysis shall evaluate the acceptability of the driving equipment with regard to
 energy transfer to the pile top and the potential for impending pile damage due to induced driving stresses.
 The pile stresses which are indicated by the wave equation to be generated by the driving equipment shall not
 exceed the values where pile damage impends, if the equipment is to be acceptable. That value is determined by the
 magnitude of the induced compressive stresses.
 The point of impending damage in steel piles is defined herein as a compressive driving stress of
 90 percent of the yield point of the pile material. For concrete piles, tensile stresses using units of kiloPascals shall not
 exceed 7.8 multiplied by the square root of the concrete compressive strength, f’c, in kiloPascals plus the effective
 0.5
 prestress value [7.8(f’c) + prestress] and compressive stresses shall not exceed 85 percent of the compressive strength
 minus the effective prestress value (0.85 f’c – prestress). For timber piles, the compressive driving stress shall not exceed
 three times the allowable static design strength listed on the plans. These criteria will be used in evaluating wave equation
 results to determine acceptability of the Contractor’s proposed driving system. The results of the analysis, including input
 parameters, shall be subject to the review and approval of the Engineer prior to any pile installations.
 The Contractor will be notified of the acceptance or rejection of the driving system within 14 calendar days of
 the Engineer’s receipt of the “Pile and Driving Equipment Data Form.” If the wave equation analyses show that either pile
 damage or inability to drive the pile with a reasonable blow count to the desired ultimate capacity will result from the
 Contractor’s proposed equipment or methods, the Contractor shall modify or replace the proposed methods or equipment
 until subsequent wave equation analyses indicate the piles can be reasonably driven to the desired ultimate capacity,
 without damage.
 Approval of the equipment by the Engineer will not relieve the Contractor of his/her responsibility to provide and
 install piles capable of supporting the design loads given on the contract documents.
 940.52
 
 Driving Appurtenances.
 
 A. Pile Drive Head.
 Pile driven with impact hammers require an adequate drive head to distribute the hammer blow to the pile head.
 The drive head shall be axially aligned with the hammer and the pile. The drive head should be guided by the leads and
 not be free-swinging. The drive head should fit around the pile head in such a manner as to prevent transfer of torsional
 forces during driving while maintaining proper alignment of hammer and pile.
 1. For steel and timber piling, the pile heads shall be cut squarely and a drive head, as recommended by the
 hammer manufacturer, be provided to hold the axis of the pile in line with the axis of the hammer.
 2. For precast concrete and prestressed concrete piles, the pile head shall be plane and perpendicular to the
 longitudinal axis of the pile to prevent eccentric impacts.
 3. For special types of piles, appropriate driving heads, mandrels or other devices shall be provided in
 accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations so that the piles may be driven without damage.
 B. Bands.
 Collars, bands, or other devices to protect timber piles against splitting and brooming shall be provided by the
 Contractor.
 C. Hammer Cushion.
 All pile driving equipment shall be equipped with a suitable thickness of hammer cushion material to prevent
 damage to the hammer or pile and to insure uniform driving behavior. Hammer cushions shall be made of durable,
 manufactured materials, provided in accordance with the hammer manufacturer’s guidelines except that all wood, wire
 rope, and asbestos hammer cushions are specifically disallowed and shall not be used. A striker plate as recommended by
 the hammer manufacturer shall be placed on the hammer cushion to insure uniform compression of the cushion material.
 
 II.260
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 The hammer cushion shall be inspected in the presence of the Engineer when beginning pile driving at each substructure
 element or after each 100 hours of pile driving, whichever is less. Any reduction of hammer cushion thickness shall be
 replaced by the Contractor before driving is permitted to continue.
 D. Pile Cushion.
 The heads of concrete piles shall be protected by a pile cushion made of plywood or other similar material
 approved by the Engineer. The minimum plywood thickness placed on the pile head prior to driving shall not be less than
 100 millimeters. A new pile cushion shall be provided for each pile. In addition during the driving of each pile, the pile
 cushion shall be replaced if during the driving the cushion is either compressed more than one-half the original thickness
 or begins to burn. The pile cushion dimensions shall match the cross-sectional area of the pile top.
 E. Leads.
 The pile driver shall be equipped with fixed leads that are an integral part of the machine. The pile driving
 hammer shall ride in the ways of the leads. Fixed leads shall be used for driving all piles unless written approval to the
 contrary is obtained from the Engineer.
 F. Followers.
 Followers shall only be used when approved in writing by the Engineer, or when specifically stated in the
 contract documents. The follower shall be of such material and dimensions to permit the piles to be driven to the length
 determined necessary from the driving of the full length piles. The final position and alignment of the first two piles
 installed with followers in each substructure unit shall be verified to be in accordance with the location tolerances in this
 specification before additional piles are installed.
 G. Jets.
 Jetting shall only be permitted if approved in writing by the Engineer or when specifically stated in the contract
 documents.
 Jetting will not be allowed when driving through newly placed embankment.
 The use of water jets will be permitted only when excess of water will not affect adjacent structures. In general,
 jetting will not be permitted near railroad tracks.
 When jetting is permitted, the Contractor shall determine the number of jets and the volume and pressure of
 water at the jet nozzles necessary to freely erode the material adjacent to the pile without affecting the lateral stability of
 the final in-place pile. The Contractor shall control, treat if necessary, and dispose of all jet water such as to meet
 environmental considerations. The Contractor shall be responsible for all damage to the site caused by jetting operations.
 The jetting plant shall have sufficient capacity to deliver at all times a pressure equivalent to at least 700 kiloPascals at two
 20 millimeter jet nozzles. Unless otherwise indicated, jet pipes shall be removed when the pile tip is a minimum of 1.5
 meters above prescribed tip elevation and the pile shall be driven to the required bearing capacity with an impact hammer.
 H. Preaugering.
 Preaugering shall only be permitted if approved in writing by the Engineer or when specifically stated in the
 Contract documents. When permitted, the Contractor shall provide the necessary equipment such as augers, well drilling
 machines, etc. to preauger holes at pile locations and to the depths required by the Engineer.
 PILE INSTALLATION
 940.60
 
 Preparation for Driving.
 
 A. Excavation.
 When piles are located in an area where excavation is to be made or in an area where embankment is to be
 placed, the piles shall not be driven until the excavation has been made or the embankment has been placed. For either of
 the foregoing, the grade shall be brought to such an elevation as to compensate for possible uplift or subsidence of the
 surrounding earth. Adjustments in the grade shall be made after all the piles at the location have been driven. Additional
 excavation or embankment will be considered as part of the process of pile driving and will not be included in the payment
 for either excavation or borrow.
 B. Preaugering.
 Where timber, cast-in place, precast-prestressed concrete piles, or steel piles are to be driven through an
 embankment, and the depth of the embankment at the pile location is in excess of 1.5 meters, the Contractor shall make a
 hole for the full depth of the embankment for each pile with an auger or by other approved methods. The hole shall have a
 diameter of not less than the butt diameter of the pile. After driving, the annular space around the pile shall be filled to the
 ground surface with dry sand, fine gravel or pea stone. Material resulting from drilling holes shall be disposed of in
 accordance with Section 120, Excavation.

 Driven Pile Capacity.
 
 For piles with proposed capacities greater than 450 kiloNewtons, the safe bearing values shall be determined by a
 Wave Equation Analysis conducted by a Registered Professional Engineer experienced in the method of analysis, at the
 expense of the Contractor. For piles with proposed capacities not greater than
 450 kiloNewtons, the safe bearing values may be determined by the following formula unless directed otherwise by the
 Engineer.
 A. Formula Method.
 0.5
 
 Ru = 211 (E)
 
 0.5
 
 log (10N) – 127(E)
 
 – 440
 
 Where:
 Ru = Ultimate Pile Capacity (kiloNewtons)
 E = Manufacturer’s rated energy of the hammer, at stroke observed in field, in kilojoules.
 Log (10N) = Logarithm to the base 10 of the quantity “10” multiplied by N, the number of hammer blows
 per 100 millimeters at final penetration (blows per 100 millimeters).
 The above formula is applicable only when:
 (a) A follower is not used.
 (b) The hammer is operated within the range established by the manufacturer.
 A design safety factor of 3.5 is to be used when using this formula to determine the safe design load, i.e., if a
 design load of 450 kiloNewtons is required in the bearing layer, then an ultimate capacity of
 1575 kiloNewtons should be used in the formula to determine the necessary hammer blow count.
 The above formula may be modified by the Engineer if he/she deems it necessary on the basis of information
 obtained from a loading test or dynamic field measurements during pile driving.
 B.
 Wave Equation Method.
 When required in the contract documents, the ultimate pile resistance shall be determined by the Engineer based
 on a wave equation analysis. Piles shall be driven with the approved driving equipment to the ordered length or other
 lengths necessary to obtain the required ultimate pile resistance. Jetting, pre-augering or other methods to facilitate pile
 penetration shall not be used unless specifically permitted either in the contract documents or approved by the Engineer
 after a revised driving resistance is established from the wave equation analysis. Adequate pile penetration shall be
 considered to be obtained when the specified wave equation resistance criteria is achieved within 1.5 meters of the tip
 elevation based on ordered length. Piles not achieving the specified resistance within these limits shall be driven to
 penetrations established by the Engineer.
 The Contractor is required to perform a wave equation analysis upon each pile type, each pile size, at each
 significant variation in soil profile, and at each pile driven for the static load test as shown on the plans. When dynamic
 load tests are required then a wave equation analysis must be performed for each pile to be dynamic load tested by the
 “Pile Driving Analyzer” (PDA) as determined by the Engineer. The wave equation analysis shall be made as outlined in
 the latest edition of the FHWA publication entitled “Manual on Design and Construction of Driven Pile Foundations.”
 If more than one driving system is proposed by the Contractor, a wave equation analysis shall also be made for
 each driving system. The driving system, as detailed on the “Pile Driving and Equipment Data Form,” shall be completed
 by the Contractor and furnished for use as wave equation input data.
 No change in driving equipment will be permitted after an evaluation by the Wave Equation Method without
 prior approval of the Engineer and a revaluation of the driving system. The Engineer may modify the results from the
 Wave Equation Analysis, if he/she deems it necessary on the basis of information obtained from loading tests or dynamic
 field measurement.
 The wave equation analysis will be performed by an engineer, registered with the Commonwealth of
 Massachusetts as a Professional Engineer and experienced in such work. The Contractor’s engineer shall be experienced
 in the performance of the wave equation analysis and its function as related to pile capacity determination. The
 Contractor’s engineer conducting the wave equation analysis shall be thoroughly familiar with the Geotechnical report for
 the project, the subsurface conditions at the site, and with the proposed foundation design.
 The Contractor shall submit a written report with a summary of each wave equation analysis to the Department at
 least 2 weeks prior to pile driving. That submission shall include a copy of the entire “wave equation analysis program”
 
 II.262

 (WEAP) output in the form as specified in the above referenced FHWA Manual. The summary in the report will contain
 the plotted curves (3) of ultimate resistance vs. blowcount and compressive stresses vs. blowcount and tensile stresses vs.
 blowcount for each WEAP output for each embedded length and for several stroke-lengths if a variable stroke (diesel)
 hammer is used.
 The Contractor’s engineer conducting the wave equation analysis shall also be the same engineer to conduct the
 dynamic load tests with the PDA when the Contractor is required to perform such dynamic load tests.

 The piles to be tested shall be driven in accordance with the requirements under the item for the type of pile to be
 used on the project. These tests shall be made before driving production on piles.
 Each pile to be tested shall be driven to the design load as determined by either the Formula in Section 940.61A
 or a Wave Equation Analysis in accordance with Section 940.61B and, at the discretion of the Engineer, by dynamic pile
 measurements in accordance with Section 940.62C.
 B. Static Tests.
 Static pile load tests shall be conducted in accordance with ASTM D 1143, “Standard Method of Testing Piles
 under Static Axial Compressive Load,” except as modified herein.
 1. General.
 The top elevation of the test pile shall be determined immediately after driving and again just before load testing
 to check for heave. Any pile which heaves more than 5 millimeters shall be redriven or jacked to the original elevation
 prior to testing. Unless otherwise specified in the contract, a minimum 3 day waiting period shall be observed between the
 driving of any anchor piles or the load test pile and the commencement of the load test.
 Tell-tales shall be installed in all test piles to determine the percent of the applied test load being transferred to
 the bearing stratum. Number and location of tell-tales shall be as shown on the plans.
 The Department will furnish levels and the personnel necessary to make all evaluations. All measuring devices
 and gauges that will be required, other than levels, shall be furnished by the Contractor.
 Readings of settlement and rebound shall be referred to a fixed benchmark and shall be made using at least two
 micrometer dial extensometers graduated to one-hundredth of a millimeter and located 90 degrees apart along the axis of
 the exposed portion of the pile. Readings shall be taken at intervals specified in Sections 4, 5, or 6, Test Procedures.
 Readings shall be taken from gauges mounted on a reference beam supported at each end by reliable supports located at
 least 3 meters from the center of the test pile.
 In addition to these readings, elevations to the nearest one-half of a millimeter by use of an Engineer’s level and
 rod shall be recorded. The entire measuring installation shall be protected from direct sunlight, frost action and other
 disturbances that might affect its reliability.
 The head of each test pile shall be cut-off level or shall be capped in such a manner as to produce a plane,
 horizontal bearing surface.
 All records obtained during the test shall be the property of the Department. Furnishing and driving the piles,
 complete in place, will be paid for under the item for the type of piles on which the test is made.
 Before starting the work, the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer, for approval, a written description of the
 equipment and method which he/she intends to use. The method must be of an approved type and shall be altered as
 necessary to meet the approval of the Engineer.
 2. Load Application.
 The method of applying the load to the pile will be at the option of the Contractor, provided the method is
 adaptable to accurate measuring of the applied load, and the method avoids eccentric loading on the pile. The first
 increment of load shall include allowance for weight of the equipment. Hydraulic Jacks shall be of an approved type and
 capable of supplying a minimum jacking capacity equal to the maximum test load plus 20%. The Contractor shall provide
 a load cell, subject to the approval of the Engineer, which is capable of determining load transfer to the test pile. The load
 cell shall have a capacity equal to the jack capacity, and shall be calibrated by a certified testing laboratory. In addition,
 the Contractor shall provide a calibration certificate from a certified testing laboratory relating pressure gauge reading to
 jack load. The Contractor shall submit to the Engineer both calibration certificates prior to load testing.
 3. Reaction Loads.
 The total reaction load shall be not less than 250 percent of the design load for both the short duration and
 maintained load tests and 400 percent of the design load for the quick load test method.

 II.263
 
 Any one of the following devices for applying the vertical loads may be used:
 a. Load Supported Directly by Pile. A loading platform or box shall be supported on top of the pile to be
 tested. The construction of the box and the application of the loads shall be such that no lateral forces will be applied to
 the top of the pile and no impact will occur as the loads are placed. In cases where the test pile is in an excavation below
 the natural ground surface, an extension column of structural steel or steel pile may be used to extend from pile head up to
 the test box.
 b. Load from Weighted Box or Platform Applied to Pile by Hydraulic Jack. A test box or test platform resting
 on cribbing shall be constructed over the pile and loaded with suitable material. A hydraulic jack with a recently
 calibrated pressure gauge shall be interposed between the pile head and the load box and load applied to the pile by
 operating the jack.
 c. Load Applied to Pile by Hydraulic Jack Acting Against Anchored Reaction Members. Two or more piles to
 be used as anchor piles shall be driven at a minimum distance of 1.5 meters from the test pile. A girder of sufficient
 strength to act as a reaction beam shall be fastened to the upper ends of the anchor piles. A hydraulic jack with a recently
 calibrated pressure gauge shall be interposed between the head of the test pile and the underside of the reaction beam and
 the test load applied to the pile by operating the jack.
 d. Test Procedures. The Contractor shall use the load sequence specified under “Short Duration Load Test”
 unless otherwise directed by the Engineer or the Contract Documents to use the load sequence specified for “Quick Load
 Test” or “Maintained Load Test.”
 The application of the test load shall not begin sooner than 72 hours after placing concrete in Cast-in place and
 Steel pipe piles and no sooner than 48 hours after other type piles are driven.
 A single pile shall be load-tested to not less than twice the design load. When two (2) or more piles are to be
 tested as a group, the total load shall be not less than one and one-half (1-1/2) times the design load for the group.
 4. Short Duration Test.
 The load sequence shall be as follows:
 a. Apply 25% of the design load every one-half hour up to the greater of the following: two hundred percent
 (200%) of design load; to an applied load which transfers one hundred percent (100%) of design load to the bearing strata
 as determined from tell-tale measurements but not greater than 90% of the reaction load. Longer time increments may be
 used, but each time increment should be the same.
 b. At the maximum applied load, maintain the load for a minimum of one hour and until the settlement
 (measured at the lowest point on the pile at which measurements are made) over a one-hour period is not greater than 0.25
 millimeters.
 c. Remove 25% of the applied load every 15 minutes until zero load is reached. Longer time increments may
 be used, but each should be the same.
 d. Measure rebound at zero load for a minimum of one hour. In no case shall a load be changed if the rate of
 settlement is not decreasing with time. For each load increment or decrement, take readings at the top of the pile and on
 the internal instrumentation at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 15 minutes and at 15 minutes intervals thereafter.
 Provided that the design load does not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the load transferred to the bearing
 stratum at the maximum test load, the design load from this test type shall be the greater of the following:
 a.
 
 Design Load Based on Settlement During Loading:
 
 1.
 
 For Piles 610 millimeters or less in diameter:
 Fifty percent (50%) of the applied test load which cause a gross settlement at the pile cutoff grade equal to
 the sum of: a) the theoretical elastic compression of the pile in millimeters, assuming all the load on the butt
 is transmitted to the tip, plus b) 4 millimeters, plus c) one hundred twentieth of the pile tip diameter or pile
 width in millimeters, i.e.,
 =
 S + (4 + D/120)
 Sf
 Where:
 Sf = Settlement at failure in millimeters
 D = Pile diameter or width in millimeters
 S = Elastic deformation of pile length in millimeters
 
 2.
 
 For Piles greater than 610 millimeters in diameter or width:
 
 II.264
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 Sf
 
 =
 
 S + D/30
 
 If the settlement are so small that the load-settlement curve does not intersect the failure criterion, the
 maximum test load shall be taken as the failure load.
 b.
 
 Design Load Based on Net Settlement After Rebound:
 Fifty percent (50%) of the applied test load which results in a net settlement of the top of the pile of 13
 millimeters, after rebound for a minimum of one hour at zero load.
 5. Maintained Load Test.
 The test loads shall be applied in at least five increments equal to 50, 100, 150, 175 and 200 percent of the
 design load. All intermediate load steps shall be maintained constant for a period of two hours. During the loading cycle,
 the contemplated design load and twice the design load shall be maintained constant until settlement does not exceed 0.5
 millimeters in 12 consecutive hours, or until the pile has failed as determined by the Engineer. The loading period for
 twice the design load shall be no less than 24 hours.
 The total test load shall be removed in decrements not exceeding 1/4 of the total test load. Each step of
 unloading shall be maintained constant for a period of 4 hours.
 During loading, record readings of time, load, and movement at intervals not exceeding 10 minutes during the
 first one-half (1/2) hour, 30 minute intervals up to two (2) hours at one (1) hour intervals up to
 12 hours and 2 hour intervals thereafter.
 During unloading, take readings at intervals not exceeding 20 minutes for the first hour and 1 hour intervals
 thereafter. Take a final rebound reading 4 hours after all load has been removed.
 The design load shall be determined in accordance with the procedures specified in the Short Duration Load
 Test.
 6. Quick Load Test.
 This load test shall be performed on individual piles only.
 The load shall be applied in increments of 50 to 100 kiloNewtons and shall not exceed 10% of the design load.
 The time interval between readings shall be 2-1/2 minutes or as otherwise specified. Add load increments until continuous
 jacking is required to maintain the test load or until the capacity of either the loading apparatus or reaction load is reached.
 Hold the failure load or maximum applied load for not less than five (5) minutes. Unload the pile in no less than four
 equal increments.
 Record time, load, and movements immediately, before and after the application or removal of each load
 increment. Take a final rebound reading 15 minutes after removing all loads. The design load shall be determined in
 accordance with the procedures specified in the Short Duration Load Test.
 C. Dynamic Load Tests.
 1. Dynamic Load Test Preparation.
 Dynamic measurements will be taken by the Engineer during driving piles designated as Dynamic Load Test
 (DLT) piles.
 Prior to placement in the leads, the Contractor shall make each designated concrete and/or timber pile available
 for taking of wave speed measurements and for predrilling the required instrument attachment holes. When wave speed
 measurements are made, the piling shall be in a horizontal position and not in contact with other piling. The Engineer
 shall furnish the equipment, materials, and labor necessary for drilling holes in the piles for mounting the instruments. The
 instruments will be attached near the head of the pile with bolts placed in masonry anchors for the concrete piles or
 through drilled holes on the steel piles.
 The Contractor shall provide the Engineer reasonable means of access to the pile for attaching instruments after
 the pile is placed in the leads. If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the instruments cannot be installed before pile is placed in
 the leads, then a platform with a minimum size of 1.2 meters x 1.2 meters designed to be raised to the top of the pile while
 the pile is located in the leads shall be provided by the Contractor. It is estimated that the Engineer will need
 approximately 1 hour per pile to install the dynamic load test equipment.
 The Contractor shall furnish electric power for the dynamic load test equipment. The power supply at the outlet
 shall be 10 ampere, 115 volt, 55-60 hertz, A.C. only. Field generators used at the power source shall be equipped with
 functioning meters for monitoring voltage and frequency levels.
 The Contractor shall furnish a shelter to protect the dynamic load test equipment from the elements. The shelter
 shall have a minimum floor size of 2.4 meters x 2.4 meters and minimum roof height of 2.1 meters. The inside
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.265
 
 temperature of the shelter shall be maintained above 7 °C. The shelter shall be located within
 15 meters of the test location.
 The pile shall be driven to the depth at which the dynamic analyzer indicates that the ultimate pile resistance
 shown in the contract plans has been achieved unless directed otherwise by the Engineer.
 The stresses in the piles will be monitored during driving with the dynamic analyzer to ensure that the pile
 stresses determined do not exceed the values which would cause pile damage. The point of impending damage in steel
 piles is defined herein as a compressive driving stress of 90% of the yield point of the pile material. For concrete piles,
 tensile stresses in units of kiloPascals shall not exceed 7.8 multiplied by the square root of the concrete compressive
 0.5
 strength, f’c in kiloPascals, plus the effective prestress value, [7.8(f’c) + prestress] and compressive stresses shall not
 exceed 85% of the compressive strength minus the effective prestress value (0.85 f’c – prestress). For timber piles, the
 compressive driving stress shall not exceed three times the allowable static design strength listed on the plans. If
 necessary, the Contractor shall reduce the driving energy output of the hammer in order to maintain stresses below these
 values. If non-axial driving is indicated by the dynamic analyzer measurements, the Contractor shall immediately realign
 the driving system.
 When directed by the Engineer, the Contractor shall wait 12 to 24 hours and then after the instruments are
 reattached, retap the dynamic load test pile. It is estimated that the Engineer will require approximately
 1/2 hour to reattach the instruments. A cold hammer shall not be used for the redrive. The hammer shall be warmed up
 before redrive begins by applying at least 20 blows to another pile. The maximum amount of penetration required during
 redrive will be 150 millimeters or the maximum total number of hammer blows required will be 50, whichever occurs
 first. After retapping, the Engineer will either provide the cut-off elevation or specify additional pile penetration and
 testing.
 2. Dynamic Load Test by Contractor.
 When directed in the Contract documents, dynamic measurements will be taken by the Contractor during pile
 driving and shall be subject to the Department’s field review. Those piles to be tested will be designated as dynamic load
 test piles or “DLT” on the plans and shall be located by the Department. Preliminary location of the piles to be tested are
 subject to revision by the Engineer. The piles to be static load tested and approximately 10% of the remaining driven piles
 will be tested by this method unless otherwise directed by the Engineer.
 The dynamic tests are to be made by the Contractor’s engineer who shall be registered with the Commonwealth
 of Massachusetts as a Professional Engineer. The same Contractor’s engineer conducting the wave equation analysis shall
 perform the dynamic load tests. Each dynamic test shall also include a “CAP-WAP” analysis in order to closely model
 actual field conditions. The damping, quake and soil resistance distribution values will be provided by the Contractor’s
 engineer. The Contractor’s engineer shall be experienced in the use of the Pile Driving Analyzer (PDA) and its purpose as
 related to pile capability determination. The Contractor’s engineer will also be proficient in the interpretation of the PDA
 and “CAP-WAP” data and shall determine the tested pile’s capacity based upon this data.
 The Contractor shall submit to the Department a written report with a summary of results upon completion of
 each PDA test including “CAP-WAP” analysis. A copy of the entire PDA and “CAP-WAP” analysis output will be
 submitted to the Department for review along with the Contractor’s report of each PDA and “CAP-WAP” test. The PDA
 and “CAP-WAP” output will not substitute for a written report which includes a summary of the results, but will be
 submitted with such a report.
 The Contractor shall submit evidence of the engineer’s proficiency to the Department at least 2 weeks in advance
 of the work to allow the Department adequate time for review and approval or comments. No pile driving will be allowed
 until written approval has been received from the Engineer.
 a. PDA Equipment.
 The equipment to perform the dynamic tests shall be a Model GC pile driving analyzer by Globe, Rausche,
 Likins and Associates, Inc., 4423 Emery Industrial Parkway, Cleveland, Ohio 44128, telephone (216) 831-6131, or
 approved equal. The equipment shall be complete with all pertinent peripheral equipment necessary to complete and
 record the test data and complete the analysis of pile capacity.
 b. Pile Testing Program.
 At least 2 weeks prior to initiating the pile driving operation, the Contractor shall submit a “pile testing program”
 outline to the Department for review and approval. The following procedure is suggested as an example of a pile testing
 program which incorporates the wave equation analysis and the dynamic pile driving analysis including the “CAP-WAP”
 portion of the dynamic testing.
 The testing should be performed by experienced engineers. The scope and sequence of testing services is
 suggested as follows:
 
 II.266
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 1. Perform initial wave equation analysis based on subsurface conditions, pile type, pile capacity, and pile
 driving equipment to be utilized. See the previously referenced FHWA Manual for examples of the WEAP analysis
 procedure from static analysis to parameter selection. Submit written report of each wave equation analysis with complete
 print-out to the Department for review.
 2. Drive piles to be static load tested first at locations specified on the plans using the driving criteria
 established by the wave equation. The driving criteria, however, is subject to change due to actual hammer performance
 and expected soil strength changes. Dynamic testing with the PDA shall be made during the driving of all piles to be static
 load tested.
 3. After performing dynamic load testing on the piles to be static load tested, evaluate static load test piles after
 a minimum waiting period, to be determined by the Engineer, by restriking the piles with simultaneous dynamic testing by
 the PDA. Restrike testing is considered essential for service load capacity determinations if they are to include
 setup/relaxation effects since the analyzer gives the pile capacity at the time of testing.
 4. The remaining 10% of the piles at each substructure which have been designated for PDA testing should be
 tested during additional construction control visits. They should be tested on initial installation and restrike, as soil
 conditions dictate at the discretion of the Engineer. Other than these tests, the Engineer will determine if further dynamic
 tests should be made when the hammer system is replaced or modified, etc.
 5. Perform supplementary, rigorous laboratory wave analysis of the measured data using “CAP-WAP” on all
 of the piles tested to verify and refine field results, and upon restrike testing.
 6. Submit to the Department a written report including a written summary of results in addition to a copy of the
 actual print-outs. This report will show all pertinent information, upon completion of the PDA testing and “CAP-WAP”
 analysis of each pile.
 7. Based on field results, the following will be reviewed, analyzed and the results of this analysis will be
 printed in a report by the Contractor’s Engineer.
 a. Driving stresses (compression or tension)
 b. Hammer system efficiency
 c. Pile structural damage/integrity
 d. Bearing capacity
 8. It should be recognized that each site has unique and often unforeseen characteristics. Judgments are to be
 made, even during the testing program by the Contractor’s experienced engineer performing the test as to deletions or
 additions to a “standard” program which will result in the most benefit to the foundation design.
 940.63
 
 Test Piles (Indicator Piles).
 
 Test piles shall be driven when shown on the plans at the locations and to the lengths specified by the Engineer.
 All test piles shall be driven with impact hammers unless specifically stated otherwise on the plans. In general, the
 specified length of test piles will be greater than the estimated length of production piles in order to provide for variation
 in soil conditions. The driving equipment used for driving test piles shall be identical to that which the Contractor
 proposes to use on the production piling. Approval of driving equipment shall conform with the requirements of these
 specifications. The Contractor shall excavate the ground at each test pile to the elevation of the bottom of the footing
 before the pile is driven.
 In the absence of a wave equation analysis, test piles shall be driven to a penetration of 10 millimeters or less
 after 10 consecutive hammer blows unless the Engineer provides a hammer blow count established by wave equation
 analysis within a range of tip elevations or unless the driving criteria is established by the dynamic formula.
 Test piles which do not attain the bearing value specified above at a depth of 300 millimeters above the estimated
 tip elevation shown on the plans shall be allowed to “set up” for 12 to 24 hours as directed by the Engineer before being
 redriven. A cold hammer shall not be used for redrive. The hammer shall be warmed up before driving by applying at
 least 20 blows to another pile. If the bearing value is not attained on redriving, the Engineer may direct the Contractor to
 drive a portion or all of the remaining test pile length and repeat the “set up” redrive procedure. Test piles driven to plan
 grade and not having the bearing required shall be spliced and driven until the required bearing is obtained.
 A record of driving of test piles will be prepared by the Contractor which includes the number of hammer blows
 per meter for the entire driven length, the as driven length of test pile, cutoff elevation, penetration in ground, and any
 other pertinent information requested by the Engineer. The Contractor shall provide the information listed in the “Pile
 Driving and Equipment Form” to the Engineer for inclusion in the record. If redrive is necessary the Engineer shall record
 the number of hammer blows per 20 millimeters of pile movement for the first 300 millimeters of redrive. The Contractor
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.267
 
 shall not order piling to be used in the permanent structure until test pile data has been reviewed and pile lengths are
 authorized by the Engineer.
 940.64
 
 Determinations of Required Pile Driving Resistance and Depth of Penetration.
 
 Practical Refusal.
 Unless otherwise specified practical refusal will be considered attained when ten blows of an adequate hammer,
 operating at the number of blows per minute for which the hammer is rated by the manufacturer, are required to produce a
 total penetration of 10 millimeters. Driving should then cease, provided that the pile has not hit an obstruction and has
 been driven to the depth at which the borings indicate refusal material or bedrock.
 When pile are not either required or directed to be driven to bedrock or refusal, the Engineer shall determine the
 required driving resistance for safe bearing values and shall establish minimum tip elevations or acceptable bearing
 stratum depending on subsurface condition. The required driving resistance will be established as described in Section
 940.61.
 When determining the final driving resistance of the pile, the hammer shall be operated at a speed not less than
 ninety percent (90%) of the maximum blows per minute specified by the manufacturer. The final driving resistance shall
 be appropriately adjusted to the actual hammer energy delivered as specified by the manufacturer for the operating speed.
 When directed by the Engineer, the Contractor shall make dynamic field measurements to demonstrate that the
 percentage of the hammer’s rated energy transferred to the pile head.
 940.65
 
 Procedure for Driving.
 
 A. General.
 No piles shall be driven except in the presence of the Engineer. Where practicable, piles shall be driven
 continuously to the required penetration and bearing capacity. When the continuous installation of a pile has been stopped
 for any reason, the pile advancement shall be started in a manner which will not damage the pile. Any pile which cannot
 be advanced or which is damaged in the process shall be rejected and either cut-off and repaired or replaced at the
 discretion of the Engineer. Rejected piles shall be replaced or repaired at no cost to the Department. Unless specified
 otherwise by the Engineer, any pile restarted shall be advanced no less than 75 millimeters before determining the final
 driving resistance.
 The order of placing individual piles in pile groups shall be either starting from the center of the group and
 proceeding outwards in both directions or starting at the outside row and proceeding progressively across the group.
 If any driven pile is raised more than 10 millimeters by the subsequent driving of adjacent piles, it shall be
 redriven to the required final resistance to penetration with no compensation for the additional driving.
 Cast-in-place and steel pipe piles shall not be filled with concrete until all piles within a footing have been
 checked for uplift and redriven where necessary unless otherwise directed by the Engineer.
 All piles shall be driven a minimum of 3 meters into original ground unless otherwise directed by the Engineer.
 B. Accuracy of Driving.
 The tops of piles at cut-off elevation shall be within 150 millimeters of plan locations. Furthermore, the asdriven center of gravity of any pile group at cut-off elevation shall be within 5% of the plan location of the center of
 gravity. No pile shall be nearer than 100 millimeters from any edge of the cap. Any increase in size of cap to meet this
 edge distance requirement shall be at the Contractor’s expense.
 Piles shall be installed so that the axial alignment of the top 3 meters of the pile is within 4% of the specified
 alignment. For piles that cannot be inspected internally after installation, an alignment check shall be made before
 installing the last 1.5 meters of pile or after installation is completed provided the exposed portion of the pile is not less
 than 1.5 meters in length. The Engineer may require that driving be stopped in order to check the pile alignment. If the
 location and/or alignment tolerances specified are exceeded, the extent of overloading shall be investigated and if, in the
 judgment of the Engineer, corrective measures are necessary, suitable measures shall be designed and constructed by the
 Contractor at no cost to the Department. Pulling laterally on piles to correct misalignment shall not be permitted.
 C. Obstruction.
 If conditions during driving indicate that the pile is hitting an obstruction and the obstruction is not in
 embankment that has been placed under the contract the following shall apply:
 1. If the elevation of the top of the obstruction is less than 1.5 meters below the elevation of the bottom of the
 footing, the Contractor shall drive through the obstruction or shall use whatever means are necessary to remove or
 circumvent the obstruction without any additional compensation.
 
 II.268
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 2. If the elevation at the top of the obstruction is 1.5 meters or more below the elevation of the bottom of the
 footing, the Contractor shall use a combination of water jet and hammer to drive through the obstruction without any
 additional compensation.
 3. If the use of the combination water jet and hammer (2) above does not allow pile to be driven through the
 obstruction, upon approval by the Engineer, the Contractor shall exercise one of the following options; (a) Drive all
 surrounding and adjacent piles to the hand-up pile or piles to determine the approximate size of the obstruction, (b)
 Employ the services of a test boring or other such exploratory method.
 4. After the approximate size of the obstruction is obtained, the Engineer will determine whether the
 obstruction is to be removed or if the footing will be redesigned leaving the obstruction in place.
 5. If it is determined that the obstruction (3) above is to be removed, the Contractor shall be paid for the work
 of removing the obstruction under Subsection 9.03.
 6. If the footing is redesigned any additional piles or excavation required shall be paid at contract unit prices.
 Any change in concrete or steel reinforcement shall be paid as specified under Subsection 995.80.
 7. No allowance of any kind other than (5) and (6) above and as provided in Subsection 8.09 will be allowed
 for the above.
 940.66
 
 Splices.
 
 A. General.
 Full length piles shall always be used where practical.
 B. Timber Piles.
 Splicing of timber piles will not be permitted.
 C. Steel Pipe Piles and Steel H Piles.
 Where these piles have to be extended, the spliced connection shall be a continuous full penetration butt-weld.
 The butt-welding shall be made to develop the full strength of the pile, both in bearing and in bending. Welding shall
 conform to the applicable provisions of Subsection 960.61.
 Butt-weld splicing of piles other than as shown on the plans will not be permitted without the express written
 consent of the Engineer.
 Welded splice connections for pipe piles shall be made with a welding or backup ring. Preheat requirements for
 the welding of pipe piles shall be as specified for ASTM A 36 steel.
 D. Precast-Prestressed Concrete Piles.
 Splices shall develop one hundred percent (100%) of the pile strength both in direct stress and in bending.
 Splices for concrete piles shall be made by the cement-dowel method. Details of the cement-dowel splice shall be shown
 in the plans. Mechanical splices for concrete or steel piles may be approved by the Engineer if the splice can transfer the
 full pile strength in compression, tension and bending. Piles shall have only one (1) splice per pile. Splices in the lower
 12 meters of the pile will not be permitted.
 940.67
 
 Defective Piles.
 
 The procedure incident to the driving of piles shall not subject them to excessive and undue abuse, producing:
 injurious splitting, splintering and brooming of the wood; deformation of steel; breakage and cracking in precastprestressed concrete piles.
 Manipulation of piles to force them into proper position will not be permitted when considered to be excessive
 by the Engineer. Piles damaged by reason of internal defects, by improper handling, driving, defective welds or piles
 driven out of proper location, shall be corrected at the Contractor’s expense by one of the following methods approved by
 the Engineer for the piles in question.
 1. The pile shall be withdrawn and replaced by a new and if necessary, a longer pile.
 2. A second pile shall be driven adjacent to the defective or low pile.
 Damaged steel piles may be spliced at some point such that the completed pile shall be satisfactory.
 After the shells for cast-in-place piles and pipe for pipe piles have been driven, they shall be inspected and will
 be classified defective if any of the following are discovered:
 1. The casing shows signs of buckling.
 2. The diameter varies more than 15 percent from the original value.
 3. The point of the casing deviates more than 10% of the length of the pile below plan cut-off elevation from
 the design alignment.
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.269
 
 4. The casing deviates more than 6% of its length from a straight line connecting the mid-points of the ends of
 the casing. This requirement shall be taken as satisfied if some segment of the bottom of the casing is visible. If the
 bottom of the casing is out of sight, the shape and alignment of the casing shall be surveyed with a suitable instrument
 supplied by the Contractor and approved by the Engineer.
 5. The inside of the casing shows any signs of water or soil.
 The Contractor shall provide sufficient lights and other equipment necessary to inspect each shell throughout its
 length.
 Precast-prestressed concrete piles which break within 3 meters from the ground surface shall be, at the discretion
 of the Engineer, either replaced or cut-off and spliced at no cost to the Department. Piles which break below 3 meters
 from the ground surface shall be rejected and replaced by the Contractor at no cost to the Department. The Engineer may
 elect to use dynamic measurements to aid in evaluating pile integrity.
 940.68
 
 Cutoffs.
 
 A. Timber Piles.
 The tops of piles shall be sawed off to a true plane at the grades shown on the plans. All cuts and abrasions on
 treated piles shall be repaired in accordance with AWPA Standard M4.
 Nail holes shall be filled by driving galvanized nails flush with the surface of the pile.
 B. Steel or Cast-In-Place Piles.
 After driving has been completed the steel or cast-in-place piles shall be cut off at the directed grade. Cutting of
 piles shall not be done until it is certain that further operations will have no effect on the previously driven piles.
 Temporary capping devices shall be provided for cast-in-place and steel pipe piles immediately upon cut-off to
 prevent soil and water from entering driven piles prior to placing concrete.
 C. Precast-Prestressed Concrete Piles.
 Precast-prestressed concrete piles shall be cut-off at the grades specified on the plans or contract documents.
 Piles shall not be cut-off until it is certain that further pile driving operations will have no effect on the driven piles.
 940.69
 
 Placing and Protecting Concrete Filled Piles.
 
 No concrete shall be placed in a shell or pipe until all piles within a footing have been satisfactorily driven,
 inspected and approved by the Engineer. No concrete shall be placed except in the presence of the Engineer.
 Prior to placing concrete in each pile, 0.03 cubic meter of mortar, having a slump of not more than
 75 millimeters, shall be deposited in the bottom of the pile.
 Concrete shall then be deposited in the casing through a funnel having a neck not more than
 450 millimeters long and not more than 180 millimeters in diameter. The funnel shall be provided with supports at the

 Method of Payment
 
 Payment will be based only on computed masses of steel complete in place in the structure. No additional
 allowance in mass will be made for the shop coat of paint or for any other coat of paint or other protective covering.
 The mass of the rolled shapes and of the plates, regardless of the width of the plates, shall be computed on the
 basis of their nominal mass and of their dimensions as shown on the approved shop drawings, deducting for copes and
 cuts, and for all open holes that are not to be filled with rivets, bolts or plug welded.
 Steel for expansion assemblies at the roadway level of bridges and similar structures (whether or not attached to
 the structural steel of the deck) and bronze or other metal for expansion bearings, drainage troughs and baffles, shall be
 included in the mass to be paid for as structural steel. Where no separate items are in the contract for galvanized nose
 angles on piers, or curb plates or angles in bridge curbs, such steel will be paid for by the kilogram as structural steel, with
 no additional compensation for the galvanizing.
 The computed mass shall not include the mass of welds. The density of the various metals shall be assumed as
 follows:
 Steel (Structural, Cast, Galvanized)
 Cast Iron
 Bronze
 
 7850 kilograms per cubic meter
 7210 kilograms per cubic meter
 8680 kilograms per cubic meter
 
 The mass of the nuts and heads of bolts shall be included in the computed mass, assuming the mass to be as
 shown below.
 Payment for bolt heads and nuts will be made by the kilogram. Where rivets are used in the permanent
 construction, the heads of the rivets shall be considered, for purpose of payment, as bolt heads for bolts equal in diameter
 to the rivets, regardless of the material of which they are composed or the materials which they fasten.
 All permanent washers will be paid for by the kilogram. The shank of a bolt will be considered as part of the
 material through which it passes and will be paid for as that material. No allowance or payment will be made for that part
 of a bolt shank that extends through and past the nut.

 Preparation of Surface.
 
 All concrete surfaces which are to be waterproofed shall be screeded to the true cross section. Depressions shall
 be filled to a smooth flush surface with 1:2 mortar (1 part cement to two parts sand) or an approved rapid setting patching
 mortar. Other surfaces shall be trimmed free of rough spots, projections or other defects which might cause puncture of
 the membrane.
 No waterproofing shall be done in wet, damp or foggy weather, nor when the ambient temperature is
 5 °C or below, without permission of the Engineer.
 The membrane waterproofing on bridge decks shall not be placed unless the Contractor is ready to follow within
 24 hours with the first layer of bituminous concrete pavement; a longer period of time will be allowed only with the
 approval of the Engineer.
 Immediately prior to the membrane application, the concrete surface shall be thoroughly swept and blown clean
 with an air compressor to remove any loose debris.
 965.61
 
 Application.
 
 A. System 1 – Coal Tar Emulsion reinforced with two plies of Coated Glass Fabric.
 Apply the first coat of coal tar emulsion on a dampened but puddle free concrete surface. Application shall be
 made by squeegees or suitable push broom. The emulsion shall be evenly spread to a uniform thickness. When this
 application is thoroughly dry a second application of emulsion shall be placed at the same rate of spread. Immediately
 following the second application the first ply of coated glass fabric shall be laid. After the second application of emulsion
 with fabric has thoroughly dried, the third and fourth applications of emulsions shall be spread.
 No applications of emulsion shall be spread until the previous application has thoroughly dried.
 Immediately after the fourth application of emulsion the second ply of coated glass fabric shall be laid at a right
 angle to the first ply. This shall be followed by the fifth application of emulsion. All applications of coal tar emulsion
 shall be uniformly spread at a minimum rate of 0.6 liters per square meter.
 The coated glass fabric shall be laid with edges slapped at least 75 millimeters. The first ply shall be laid
 transverse to the center line of the bridge and the second ply parallel with the center line.
 Where curb or edging is placed, the membrane shall be turned up as shown on the plans.
 Where membrane waterproofing is placed abutting steel expansion joints, scuppers, manholes or other metal
 projecting through the concrete, the membrane will be turned up about 40 millimeters and sealed to the metal.
 The bituminous overlayment shall be placed within 24 hours, in accordance with Item 965.62, but not before the
 membrane has completely cured.
 B. System 2 – Thermoplastic Asphalt Membrane.
 Surface preparation shall be the same as in Item 965.60 with the added requirement that if the concrete surface is
 damp it shall be dried by use of a propane gas torch or similar equipment. Immediately prior to the application of the
 primer and by use of an air compressor, the surface shall be blown clean of all debris, dust, etc.
 Priming:
 The primer shall be applied by a hand sprayer, or similar equipment. Application shall be at the rate
 recommended by the manufacturer of the thermoplastic membrane.
 The primer shall thoroughly dry before application of the thermoplastic membrane.
 Membrane Application:
 Melting of the thermoplastic membrane shall be done in a double jacketed indirect-fired heating kettle. Oil shall
 be used as the heat transfer medium. The kettle shall be equipped with a suitable agitator and temperature gauges for both
 the kettle and the oil-bath jacket.
 Sufficient lead time shall be allowed for heating of the thermoplastic so that it will be in a fluid state at the time
 scheduled for application. Usually two to three hours are required for this phase of the operation.
 A few packages of the thermoplastic shall be placed in the heating kettle and continuously agitated until
 thoroughly fluid. More material shall be added until the kettle is full and the material is fluid. As material is drawn off for
 application, additional packages shall be added.
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 II.285
 
 Caution should be observed that the melting temperature does not exceed manufacturer’s recommendation. This
 is usually between 175 °C to 220 °C. When fluid, the material shall be drawn off in suitable containers and poured onto
 the primed and dried deck surface.
 It shall be evenly spread with squeegees to a minimum thickness of 3 millimeters. All horizontal surfaces shall
 be completely covered and vertical surfaces (curbing, edging, etc.) shall be covered up to a minimum of 100 millimeters.
 Cracks greater than 2 millimeters but less than 12 millimeters shall be covered with 150 millimeter to 300
 millimeter wide strips of butyl or neoprene sheeting. The sheeting shall be embedded in the freshly spread hot membrane
 material. A second coat of membrane material shall be spread overlapping the strip edges at least 100 millimeters.
 After application of the membrane is completed and the material has set, it shall be dusted thoroughly with dry
 portland cement. This will eliminate all tackiness.
 To eliminate any possible damage to the membrane and in accordance with Subsection 965.62, the bituminous
 overlayment shall be applied as soon as possible. The only caution that must be observed is that the paving spreader travel
 in a straight course and not make any turns that could cause damage to the membrane.
 C. System 3 – Preformed Sheet Membranes.
 This system shall consist of the application of preformed reinforced rubberized asphalt or reinforced tar and resin
 sheet membranes.
 Composition and dimensional requirements shall be as stipulated by the manufacturer of the sheet membrane.
 Membrane application shall be in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The only exception, if
 required by the manufacturer, shall be the need for a separation or protection layer. As with System 1 and 2, the first
 course of the bituminous concrete overlayment shall serve as the protective course.
 The bituminous overlayment shall be placed as soon as possible and as described in Subsection 965.62.
 965.62
 
 Bituminous Concrete Protective Course.
 
 The first course of the bituminous concrete overlayment shall serve as the protective course. It shall be placed
 within 24 hours after the membrane has been installed.
 The bituminous concrete protective course shall be spread upon the entire membrane to a finished depth as
 specified in accordance with the following requirements:
 The precautions hereinbefore noted for Section 460, Bituminous Concrete Pavement, shall be strictly observed.
 1. Spreading Mixture.
 a. The use of rubber tired mechanical pavers and trucks on the membrane during the paving operations
 will be permitted provided workmanship is satisfactory to the Engineer. If work is judged unsatisfactory, the Engineer
 will require that subsequent placement be by hand.
 b. Hand spreading of the mixture shall be accomplished by dumping the mixture from the trucks onto metal or
 wooden platforms which shall be of such a size that the mixture will not fall off when dumped thereon or work off during
 spreading. Each load of mixture shall be dumped outside of the area over which it will be spread and only as fast as can
 be handled by the shovelers. The mixture shall be deposited upon the membrane with shovels and spread with lutes, care
 being taken not to spread the mixture faster than it can be handled by the rakers.
 2. Compacting.
 After the mixture has been properly spread, it shall be rolled. Delays in the initial rolling of the freshly placed
 mixture will not be permitted. In all places inaccessible to a roller, the required compression shall be secured with hot
 tampers. Rolling shall be done with a roller conforming to the requirements as specified for Class I-1 Bituminous
 Concrete in Section 460, except where power rollers are impracticable to use, approved hand rollers and tampers shall be
 used, as directed. Steel wheel rollers will not be allowed on bare membrane.
 3. Joints.
 The bituminous concrete shall be so placed that the number of joints required shall be reduced to a minimum.
 Where joints are necessary, they shall be constructed in the manner specified in Section 460. Edges of the bituminous
 concrete at the edge of parapets shall be protected by planks which shall be firmly secured and left in place until the course
 has been properly rolled and is thoroughly set.
 No bituminous work shall be done during rainy weather or when weather conditions as to temperature or
 otherwise are, in the Engineer’s judgment, unsuitable for obtaining satisfactory results.

 General.
 
 These mixtures shall be composed of mineral aggregate, mineral filler (if required), bituminous material, and
 reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). The use of RAP shall be at the Contractor’s option unless otherwise provided by
 the special provisions of the contract.
 Plants producing recycled mix shall be equipped so that they can properly proportion, blend and mix all
 components of a recycled mixture so that the end product is in conformance with the designated job-mix formula.
 M3.11.02
 
 Composition of the Mixture.
 
 The mineral aggregate, filler (if required), bituminous material, asphalt modifier (if required) and RAP shall
 be proportioned and mixed to conform with the designated mixture as tabulated in Table A hereinafter.
 M3.11.03
 
 Job-Mix Formula.
 
 The composition limits in Table A are master ranges of tolerances of materials in general. In order to obtain
 standard texture, density and stability, the Contractor will furnish to the Engineer a specific job-mix formula for the
 particular uniform combination of materials and sources of supply to be used on each project. The job-mix formula
 for each mixture shall establish a single percentage of aggregate passing each required sieve size, a single percentage
 of bituminous material to be added to the aggregate and for batch plants, the number of seconds for dry mixing time
 and the number of seconds for wet mixing time. AASHTO T 195 (Ross Count) with a coating factor of 98% will be
 used when necessary to evaluate proper mixing time. The job-mix formula shall also specify a single source or
 uniform blend of particular sources for fine aggregate, a single source for each nominal size of coarse aggregate, a
 single source of supply for mineral filler and sources for asphalt.
 The use of RAP will be permitted at the option of the Contractor and provided that the end product is in
 conformance with the designated job-mix formula. The proportion of RAP to virgin aggregate shall be limited to a
 maximum of 40% for drum mix plants and 20% for modified batch plants. The maximum amount of RAP for
 surface courses shall be 10% except no RAP will be allowed in the open graded friction course (OGFC).
 Two or more job-mix formulas may be approved for a particular plant; however, only material conforming to
 one job-mix formula will be permitted to be used on any given calendar day. The job-mix formula shall bind the
 Contractor to furnish paving mixtures not only within the master ranges, but also conforming to the exact formula
 thus set up for the project, within allowable tolerances as follows:

 Proportioning.
 
 Concrete shall be proportioned with the specified minimum cement content for each class and shall be mixed
 to the required consistency as determined by standard slump test AASHTO T 119.
 A. Proportioning by Mass.
 Cement and aggregates shall be proportioned by mass in an approved manner. Scales shall be calibrated and
 sealed by the proper authority within the preceding year, or following any reassembly, or as the Engineer may direct.
 B. Scope of Control for Proportioning.
 The responsibility of the Department is confined to the inspection of the following four factors controlling
 the mix:
 1. Minimum Cement Content and Minimum Strength.
 The cement proportion is subject to adjustment and approval by the Engineer in order to insure compliance
 with minimum strength requirements. Standard field test specimens (AASHTO T 23) shall be taken on the job and
 the Contractor shall be required to add additional cement as directed by the Engineer if test specimens, strength fails
 to meet the requirements of ASTM C 94, Section 17.
 No claims shall be allowed for extra cement or extra concrete due to variations in materials, proportioning,
 dimensions, shrinkage, waste and similar causes. The Contractor is advised to anticipate a normal loss in yield of 1%
 or 2% due to the foregoing causes.
 The volume of plastic concrete in a given batch shall be determined from the total mass of the batch divided
 by the actual mass per cubic meter of the concrete. The total mass of the batch shall be calculated as the sum of the
 masses of all materials including water. The mass per cubic meter shall be determined in accordance with the
 Method of Test for Weight per Cubic Meter Yield and Air Content (Gravimetric) of Concrete (AASHTO T 121).

 100 ± 25 mm slump
 100 ± 25 mm slump
 150 ± 25 mm slump
 
 When the specified slump is less than 75 millimeters the tolerance shall be plus or minus
 13 millimeters. When the specified slump is 75 millimeters or greater the tolerance shall be plus or minus
 25 millimeters. The Engineer will specify the lowest slump with which it is practical to properly place and
 consolidate the mix within the forms.
 3. Workability.
 The Engineer may vary the proportion of fine aggregate in order to regulate the workability or density of the
 mix, making an equivalent change in the course aggregate to keep the yield constant.
 4. Air Content.
 The air content of the concrete by volume shall be as shown in the table above when tested in accordance
 with AASHTO T 152. A tolerance of plus or minus 1% in the above percentages will be allowed.
 C. Automatic Proportioning Plants.
 All plants shall be equipped with an approved automatic weighing, cycling and monitoring system installed
 as part of the batching equipment. Each plant shall include equipment for accurate proportioning batches containing
 the various components by mass or by volume for admixtures and water in the proper sequence and for controlling
 the sequence and timing of mixing operation. The automatic proportioning system shall be capable of consistently
 delivering each constituent within the tolerances indicated in M4.02.07. Interlocks shall be provided which will hold
 or delay the automatic batch cycling whenever the batched quantity of any component is not within the specific
 weight tolerance, when any aggregate bin becomes empty or when there is a malfunction in any portion of the control
 system. The mass setting and time controls shall be so equipped that they may be locked when directed by the
 Engineer.
 The weighing equipment shall be so arranged that the batch plant operator can conveniently observe all
 scales from his/her operation station.
 The controls shall be set so that:
 1. The batcher inlet gates cannot be opened while the discharge gates are open.
 2. The batcher discharge gates cannot be opened:
 a) Until the full batch masses are registered on the scales;
 b) While the hopper is being filled;
 c) If batch masses are over or under the delivery tolerances specified on M4.02.07.
 3. A new batch cannot be weighed until the hopper is entirely empty of the previous batch and all scales
 have returned to zero.
 Discharge chutes shall be so arranged that they are not suspended from any part of the weighing system and
 so that no materials will lodge therein or be lost on discharge.
 Each weighing unit shall include a springless dial which shall indicate the scale load at all stages of the
 weighing operation from zero to full capacity.
 If at any time the automatic proportioning system becomes inoperative, the plant will be allowed to batch
 materials manually for a period not in excess of 2 working days. Manual batching for longer periods will require
 written permission of the Engineer. All plant scales shall be tested at the expense of the producer by a competent
 scale technician as follows:

 admixtures into the concrete. At least two admixture dispensing systems shall be required for plants supplying
 structural concrete.
 E. Recording the Batching.
 All concrete batching plans equipped with automatic proportion systems shall have digital recording
 instruments approved by the Engineer which shall be so located as to be readily accessible and readable to the
 operator from his/her normal work station. The recording instruments shall be designed to record the quantities of
 each aggregate component, cement, fly ash (when used), water and the presence of admixture for each batch of
 concrete produced. All records of batches shall show the batch number, the day, the month, the year, and time of day
 to the nearest minute for each batch and they shall be imprinted on the record so that each batch may be permanently
 identified. The Department shall be provided with a clear and legible copy of all batch records.
 Cement, fly ash, and aggregate component weight quantities shall be recorded separately. Water may be
 removed by mass or volume.
 Masses and/or volumes shall be recorded as indicated on the batching scale or meter within an accuracy of ±
 1 scale or meter gradation. The minimum recorder resolution shall be equivalent to or less than minimum gradation
 on the scale or meter, unless otherwise approved by the Engineer. When the automation system is capable of
 producing other than standard size batches (full, half, or quarter cubic meter increments), the recoordination
 requirements shall be in accordance with written directives from the Engineer.
 Each plant site shall be equipped with an approved instrument capable of automatically applying a time-date
 stamp to each delivery ticket as the delivery vehicle departs from the plant site.

 Measuring Materials.
 
 A. Cement shall be measured by mass or in bags of 42 kilograms each. When fly ash is specified in the
 mix design, it may be weighed cumulatively with cement. Cement should be weighed before fly ash. When cement
 is measured by mass, it shall be weighed on a scale separate from those used for other materials, and in a hopper
 entirely free and independent of the hoppers used for weighing the aggregates. All beam type scales for weighing
 cement shall be equipped with a tare beam. When cement is measured in bags, no fraction of a bag shall be used
 unless weighed. The cement as weighed shall be within 1% of required mass.
 B. Aggregates shall be measured by mass. Batch masses shall be based on dry materials and shall be the
 required masses of dry materials plus the total mass of moisture (both absorbed and surface) contained in the
 aggregate. The individual aggregates as weighed shall be within ± 1% of the required mass.
 C. Mixing water shall consist of water added to batch, ice added to batch, water occurring as surface water
 on the aggregates, and water introduced in the form of admixtures. Water shall be measured by volume or by mass.
 The device for the measurement of the water shall be readily adjustable and shall be capable of being set to deliver
 the required amount and cut off the flow automatically when this amount has been discharged. Under all operating
 conditions the device shall have an accuracy within 1% of the quantity of water required for the batch. The device
 shall be so arranged that measurements will not be affected by variable pressures in the water supply line. Measuring
 tanks shall be of adequate capacity to furnish the maximum mixing water required and shall be equipped with outside
 taps and valves to provide for checking their calibration unless other means are provided for readily and accurately
 determining the amount of water in the tank. All wash water must be removed from truck mixers or agitators. All
 water measuring systems shall be capable of discharging total quantity of measured water into the mixer drum in a
 time not greater than one-third of the specified mixing time.
 D. Dry admixtures shall be measured by mass, and paste or liquid admixtures by mass or volume, within a
 limit of accuracy of 3%. When admixtures are used in small quantities in proportion to the cement, as in the case of
 air-entraining admixtures, mechanical dispensing equipment shall be used.

 Draped Pretensioned Strands.
 
 Draped pretensioned strands may be tensioned partially by jacking at the end of the bed and partially by
 uplifting or depressing strands or they may be tensioned entirely by jacking with the strands being held in their draped
 positions by means of rollers or pins or other approved methods during the jacking operation.
 Whatever means is used, low friction devices must be used at all points of change in slope of strand
 trajectory at the time of tensioning.
 The tension for draped strands applied by jacking is done in essentially the same manner and must conform
 to the same requirements as the tensioning for straight strand, unless otherwise noted.
 If draped strands are tensioned in their draped position, they should be supported by lubricated rollers with
 bronze bushings or roller bearings at all hold-up points and low friction free turning rollers at all hold-down points.
 A recommended procedure for tensioning draped strands in the deflected trajectory by single strand jacking
 is as follows:
 1. Applying initial tensioning load to strand.
 2. Mark the strand for elongation measurement.
 3. Apply the full tension load as determined by the jack gauge, not by elongation.
 4. Measure elongation and determine the remaining elongation required for full tension based on computed
 elongation.
 5. Jack the strand from the other end to remaining required elongation and note the load measured by the
 jack gauge. The actual gauge reading will probably be in excess of the theoretical gauge reading but should not
 exceed it by more than 5%.
 Single strand tensioning of strands in the draped position by jacking the strands from only one end is
 permissible provided the required strand elongation is obtained without the jack gauge pressures exceeding the
 theoretical by more than 5%.
 When strands are deflected after partial tensioning, the strands must be raised or depressed exactly the
 correct distances and they should be deflected simultaneously at all points or in an approved specific sequence.
 Disregard of these requirements could result in incorrect strand tension and put stress distribution along the strand.
 The lengths of the strands to be used in calculating elongations should be the actual length of the strand
 along its trajectory between the fixed anchorage and the reference point at the jacking end of the strand.
 It is imperative that the actual dimensions of the bed layout and locations of hold-up and hold-down points
 agree with the dimensions shown on the approved working drawings.
 Up-lift and hold-down devices must be attached in such a manner as to maintain the specified center-tocenter spacing of strands in both the vertical and the horizontal directions.
 Provisions should be made for a minimum of 25 millimeters of concrete cover on all metal parts of the holddown devices remaining within the beams. Use of approved fiber sleeves for the hold-down bolts is satisfactory.
 M4.03.10
 
 Mix Design.
 
 Unless otherwise specified on the Plans the concrete mix shall be designed to produce a minimum 28 day
 strength of 45 MPa. The job-mix design shall be submitted by the fabricator and approved by the Engineer. No jobmix design will be approved with a cement content less than 385 kilograms. The use of additives will be at the option
 of the fabricator with approval of the Engineer.
 M4.03.11
 
 Slump.
 
 The Engineer shall specify the consistency of the mix to have a minimum slump so as to place the stiffest
 mix practical without excessive vibration, free from segregation and voids. The Contractor shall control the slump, as
 directed, uniformly within a tolerance specified in M4.02.06.

 Mixing, Placing and Curing Concrete.
 
 The concrete shall be proportioned as specified in M4.02.06 and mixed in accordance with M4.02.10.
 No delay or shutdown of over 30 minutes duration in continuous filling of individual forms will be allowed.
 The forms shall be cleaned and properly oiled, and the mix shall be carefully placed without excess vibration
 to avoid segregation or displacement of reinforcing or forms. The surface shall be cured during the initial setting
 period to avoid shrinkage cracking. The beams shall be cast true to line and dimensions, free from checking,
 cracking, voids and surface honeycomb without requiring additional rubbing or patching.
 The top surface of pretensioned butted deck beams and box beams shall be screeded to a smooth surface
 except where concrete is to be placed over the top surface, in which case the surface shall be rough. The top surface
 of all prestressed I beams, bulb tees, and spread deck and box beams shall be rough. Recesses shall be provided
 where the handling hooks enter the concrete surface of the beams. The recesses shall be
 50 millimeters greater in diameter of the bar or strand, and 25 millimeters deep. For purpose of definition the
 following is provided:
 Rough = Raked to a minimum 6 millimeters amplitude in any direction (intended for concrete to concrete
 secondary casting).
 Smooth = A float finish with maximum amplitude of 3 millimeters at ridges (intended for application of
 membrane waterproofing).
 Sleeves and galvanized steel or cast inserts shall be placed in the beams as shown on the plans. They shall
 be carefully located and securely fastened to the forms to prevent displacement. Sleeves or inserts not properly
 placed may be cause for rejection of the beams.
 Curing.
 The beams shall be cured at a minimum temperature of 21 °C and minimum humidity of 95% for the
 minimum curing period necessary to produce the minimum cylinder strength as specified on the plans transferring
 prestress. A longer period of curing shall be required if curing test specimens fail to meet the minimum compressive
 strength. Steam curing may be permitted under the Engineer’s direction and approval as specified in M4.02.14D.
 M4.03.13
 
 Test Requirements.
 
 Unless another concrete strength is specified on the Plans, standard comparison test specimens of concrete
 shall meet a minimum strength requirement of 45 MPa as follows:
 Concrete made with:
 Type I or II Cement
 Type III Cement
 
 28 Days
 7 Days
 
 Three representative test cylinders shall be made for each day’s pour and they shall be cured under standard
 job conditions (AASHTO T 23). Failure of any test specimen to meet 90% of minimum strength, or failure of
 average to meet the full minimum strength requirement, shall be cause for rejection of all beams poured that day.
 M4.03.14
 
 Transferring Tension to Concrete.
 
 In pretensioning, after the concrete has developed the required strength the tension in the strands shall be
 transferred to the concrete gradually. This may be done by a system of jacking or by burning or cutting the strands.
 If the latter method is used, the strands shall be cut by burning, and the number of strands cut at a time shall be such
 that the stress in the remaining strands will not reach the ultimate-strength of the strands after due allowance has been
 made for the friction in the bed. They shall be cut or burned between each pair of beams in the casting bed so that all
 of the tension in these strands is transferred to the concrete before other strands are cut or burned.
 A symmetrical pattern shall be followed in releasing the tension by this method. In order for release of the
 
 III.46
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 strands to occur gradually they should not be quickly cut, but should be heated until the metal gradually loses its
 strength.
 Draped pretensioned strands should be detensioned in accordance with the following:
 A. Unless the total load of the precast concrete member is as much as twice the total of the forces required
 to hold the strands in the low position within the member, or unless the members are loaded or restrained in an
 approved manner to resist the uplifting forces on the member at the hold-down points, the following sequence should
 be followed for detensioning:
 1. Release the tensions in the draped strands at the ends of the members by heating each strand until it fails.
 The draped strands should be heated to failure at each up-lifted point in accordance with an approved sequence as
 shown on the working drawings.
 2. All hold-down devices for the draped strands should be released and the hold-down bolts within the
 members removed.
 3. If any straight pretensioned strands are located within the members, they should be detensioned after the
 draped strands have been detensioned. Straight strands shall be detensioned by releasing the tension in these strands
 gradually and uniformly.
 B. When the total load of the precast concrete member is more than twice the total of the forces required to
 hold the deflected strand in the low position within the member, the following sequence may be used, at the
 fabricator’s option, for detensioning the prestressed strands:
 1. Hold-down devices for the deflected strands may be released and the hold-down bolts within the
 members removed.
 2. Deflected strands and straight strands may be detensioned by releasing the tension in the strands
 gradually and uniformly.
 When the total load of the member is less than twice the total of the hold-down forces, loads or approved
 vertical restraint may be applied to the member in order to counteract the uplifting forces at the hold-down points
 when hold-down devices are released.
 The load or approved vertical restraint added to the member should be placed directly over the hold-down
 points for the deflected strands. When the total of the load of the member plus the added loads or restraint is more
 than twice the hold-down forces, the strand-detensioning method of releasing hold-down devices before strand
 tension may be followed.
 It is very important that the procedures for transfer of prestressing forces to members with deflected
 pretensioned strands are followed. Disregarding the procedures for transferring the forces to the members will
 probably result in unacceptable members.

 aggregates, latex modifier, and water to produce on the site not less than 4.5 cubic meters of concrete.
 2. The mixer shall be capable of positive measurement of cement being introduced into mix. A recording
 meter visible at all times and equipped with a ticket printout shall indicate this quantity.
 3. Mixers shall be calibrated to accurately proportion the specified mix at 75 cubic meter intervals.
 Certification of the calibration by approved testing authority will be accepted as evidence of this accuracy if the yield
 is shown to be true within a tolerance of 1.0% according to the following test:
 With the cement meter set on zero and all controls set for the desired mix, activate the mixer, discharging
 mixed material into a one quarter cubic meter container (1 meter x 1 meter x 250 millimeters) and when the container
 is level-struck full, making provision for settling the material into all corners, the cement meter must show a discharge
 of 96 kilograms of cement for modified concrete, (385 kilograms/cubic meter).
 4. The mixer shall provide positive control of the flow of water and polymeric emulsion into the mixing
 chamber. Water flow shall be indicated by flow meter and be readily adjustable to provide minor variations in
 aggregate moisture.
 5. The mixer shall be capable of being calibrated to automatically proportion and blend all components of
 the indicated composition on a continuous or intermittent basis as required by the finishing operation. It shall
 discharge mixed material through a conventional chute directly in front of the finishing machine.
 6. The mixer shall be capable of spraying water over the entire placement width as it moves ahead to insure
 that the surface to be overlaid is damp prior to receiving the modified material.
 C. Mixing and Delivery Control: Cement and aggregates shall be proportioned, measured and batched by a
 volumetric mass equivalent method. In operation, the entire measuring and batching mechanism must produce the
 specified proportions of each ingredient. Tolerance in proportioning the various ingredients shall be as follows:
 Cement, mass
 Aggregates, mass
 Water, mass or volume

 The tolerances are based on a mass/volume relationship established during the calibration or by the
 measuring devices.
 During mixing, the drive shaft speed as indicated by the tachometer shall be maintained at operation speed
 ±50 rpms. The auger mixer angle shall be set in the range determined by the manufacturer. The interval between the
 continuous placing of succeeding batches shall not exceed 30 minutes.
 D. Placing and Finishing Equipment shall include hand tools for placement and brushing-in freshly mixed
 latex modified material and for distributing it to approximately the correct level for striking off with the screed.
 An approved finishing machine complying with the following requirements shall be used for finishing the
 work:
 The finishing machine shall be self-propelled and capable of forward and reverse movement under positive
 control. Provisions shall be made for raising all screeds to clear the screeded surface for traveling in reverse.

 50 millimeter pipe rail or approved equal.
 One or more suitable portable lightweight or wheeled work bridges shall be required and used behind the
 finishing operation for touch-up work, surface texturing and curing cover pavement.
 
 CONSTRUCTION METHODS
 A. Preparing the surface.
 1. For new construction:
 Newly constructed concrete bridge decks shall be cured a minimum of 14 days before placement of the latex
 modified concrete wearing surface.
 Within 24 hours prior to applying the latex modified concrete overlayment, the concrete surface to be
 covered shall be thoroughly blast cleaned. This operation shall remove all hardened curing compound and/or laitance
 layer and shall expose the concrete aggregate. The edge of previously placed lanes shall be similarly treated to
 promote bond. The surface shall be thoroughly cleared of all debris created by this operation and then pressure
 flushed with clean water. Immediately prior to placement of the latex cement composition, the clean surface shall be
 thoroughly wetted for a period of not less than one hour. Any standing water shall be blown clear before the
 placement is made.
 2. For Repair or Deck Restoration:
 Prior to applying the latex modified concrete overlayment, the concrete surface to be covered shall be
 machine scarified to the depth shown on the plans. In areas where scarifying cannot reach, in areas of deep spalling
 and where steel reinforcement is exposed, deteriorated concrete will be removed to sound material by chipping and
 by use of hand tools.
 Forty-eight hours of good curing shall have elapsed prior to scarifying or chipping on adjacent concrete
 within 2 meters of latex modified concrete.
 Area from which unsound concrete and epoxy patches have been removed shall be kept free of slurry
 produced by wet sawing or wet scarifying by planning the work so that this slurry will drain away from the complete
 areas of preparation. All such slurry shall be removed from prepared areas before resurfacing. Before placement
 begins, and within 24 hours, the entire surface shall be thoroughly cleaned by blasting. The edge of previously placed
 lanes of overlayment shall be blasted to remove the trowel cut surfacing and promote bond. If necessary, to remove
 rust, oil and other foreign materials detrimental to achieving bond, detergent cleaning followed by sandblasting and
 air blast cleaning will be required. Immediately prior to placement of latex modified concrete, the clean surface shall
 be thoroughly wetted for a period of not less than one hour. Any standing water in depressions, holes or areas of
 concrete removal shall be blown out with compressed air.
 All corroded reinforcing bars shall be thoroughly cleaned by blasting. Those bars that have lost 1/4 or more
 of their original diameter shall be supplemented by new bars spliced in place. In splicing new bars they shall be
 lapped sufficiently to develop the full strength of the bar and, if necessary additional chipping will be required to
 provide for this lap. Dual bars of equivalent or greater section may be used. Where the bond between existing
 concrete and reinforcing steel has been destroyed, or where more than half the diameter of the steel is exposed, the
 concrete adjacent to the bar shall be removed to a depth that will permit modified concrete to bond to the entire
 periphery of the bar exposed. A minimum of 19 millimeters clearance shall be required except where lower bar mats
 makes this impractical. Care shall be exercised to prevent cutting, stretching or damaging any exposed reinforcing
 steel. Any exposed old copper waterstop shall be removed to the limits designated by the Engineer.
 B. Proportioning and Mixing of Latex Modified Concrete:
 The operations of proportioning and mixing latex cement materials shall comply with the following
 requirements:
 Mixers shall be clean and the ingredients accurately proportioned.
 Latex Modified Concrete shall be mixed at the site in accordance with the specified requirements for the
 equipment used. The latex modified concrete as discharged from the mixer shall be uniform in composition and
 consistency. Mixing capability shall be such that finishing operations can proceed at a steady pace with final
 finishing completed before the formation of the plastic surface film.
 
 III.52
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 C. Placing and Finishing.
 Existing expansion joints and dams shall be raised prior to placing overlayment.
 A bulkhead shall be installed to the required grade and profile prior to placing latex cement material. Joint
 filler and STYROFOAM (trademark of Dow Chemical Company) or equal brand plastic foam may be used but
 casting full across the joint and later sawing will not be allowed.
 Travel rails shall be placed and fastened in position to insure finishing at the new surface to the required
 profile. Anchorage for supporting rails shall provide horizontal and vertical stability.
 All surfaces shall be completely cleaned as approved by the Engineer prior to placing mixtures.
 The latex cement mix shall be brushed onto the wetted, prepared surface. Care shall be exercised to insure
 that all vertical as well as horizontal surfaces receive a thorough, even coating and that the rate of the progress is
 limited so that the brushed material does not become dry before it is covered with additional material as required for
 the final grade. Material used for brushing which has had the mortar used up shall be disposed.
 The mixture shall be placed and struck-off to approximately 6 millimeters above final grade. It shall then be
 consolidated and finished at final grade with the vibrating devices. Spud vibration will be required at edges and
 adjacent to joint bulkheads. Hand finishing with a float may be required along the edge of the pour. Edge tooling is
 required at joints, except next to metal expansion dams, curbs, and previously placed lanes.
 When a tight uniform surface has been achieved it shall be textured to provide a relatively skid resistant
 surface. Texturing shall be done by use of wire rake before the plastic film forms on the surface. The wire rake shall
 have flexible tines approximately 13 millimeters on center and will be subject to the approval of the Engineer.
 Screed rails and/or construction bulkheads shall be separated from the newly placed material by passing a
 pointing trowel along their inside face. Metal expansion dams shall not be separated from the overlayment. Care
 shall be exercised to insure that this trowel cut is made for the entire depth and length of rails after the mixture has
 stiffened sufficiently.
 The surface shall be promptly covered with a single layer of clean, wet burlap as soon as the surface will
 support it without deformation.
 Immediately following covering with wet burlap, a layer or polyethylene film (minimum
 10 micrometers) shall be placed on the wet burlap and the surface cured for 24 hours. The curing material shall then
 be removed for an additional 72 hours air cure. Wet burlap-polyethylene sheets may be substituted for the
 polyethylene film with the approval of the Engineer, but shall not replace the initial wet burlap.
 Limitation of Operations:
 No vehicular traffic shall be permitted on the latex cement composition until at least 5 days after placement.
 No latex cement composition shall be placed at temperatures lower than 7 °C. They may be placed at 7 °C
 and rising.
 At temperatures below 13 °C, the Engineer will require a longer curing period and compliance with
 applicable sections of the Standard Specifications for curing bridge deck concrete during cold weather.
 At temperatures above 30 °C, the Engineer may require placement to be made at night or early morning
 hours, if in his/her opinion a satisfactory placement is not being achieved.
 A construction dam or bulkhead shall be installed in case of major delay in the placement operation
 exceeding one hour in duration. During minor delays of one hour or less the end of the placement may be protected
 from drying with several layers of wet burlap.
 Adequate precautions shall be taken to protect freshly placed material from sudden or unexpected rain. All
 placing operations shall stop when it starts to rain. The Engineer may order removal of any material damaged by
 rainfall.
 Application of Live Loads:
 Truck mixers and other heavy equipment shall not be permitted on the latex modified concrete overlay, nor
 the traveling public until authorized by the Engineer. Such authorization may only be given after the prescribed
 curing period has taken place, after the last concrete has been placed, and provided the concrete in the deck has
 attained a minimum strength of 25 MPa. Specimens shall be cured in the same manner as the deck.

 Controlled Density Fill.
 
 Controlled Density Fill (CDF) material is a flowable, self consolidating, rigid setting, low density material
 that can substitute for compacted gravel for backfills, fills and structural fills. There are two main categories of
 CDF’s, excavatable and non-excavatable with a subcategory of flowable and very flowable. It shall be a mixture of
 portland cement, flyash (if very flowable), sand, and water designed to provide strengths within the range specified.
 The categories of CDF’s are:
 Type 1
 Type 1E
 Type 2
 Type 2E
 
 Very Flowable (Non-Excavatable)
 Very Flowable (Excavatable)
 Flowable (Non-Excavatable)
 Flowable (Excavatable)
 
 The Very Flowable mixes (Type 1 and 1E) shall contain a minimum of 115 kilograms of Class F Fly Ash or
 high air (25% plus) and will be self leveling.

 Decimal Prefixes
 Many numbers resulting from metric calculation using the units above are too large or small to be practically
 used in design and construction. Therefore, three decimal prefixes are commonly used with the base units to
 produce a manageable number.

 RULES FOR WRITING METRIC SYMBOLS, NAMES, AND NUMBERS
 · Print unit symbols in upright type and in lower case except for liter (L) or unless the unit name is derived from a
 proper name such as Pascal (P).
 · Print unit names in lower case, even those derived from a proper name.
 · Print decimal prefixes in lower case for magnitudes 103 and lower, i.e., k, m, µ, and n, and print the prefixes in upper
 6
 case for magnitudes 10 and higher, e.g., M and G.
 · Leave a space between a numeral and a symbol (write 45 kg or 2.37 mm, not 45kg or 2.37mm). Exceptions: No
 space is left between the numerical value and the symbols for degree, minute and second of plane angle, e.g., write
 27°30′ and not 27 ° 30 ′. In the case of the symbol for the “degree Celsius” this space is optional, but the degree
 symbol must always be attached to C, e.g., write 20°C or 20 °C and not 20° C.
 · Do not leave a space between a unit symbol and its decimal prefix (write kg, not k g).
 · Do not use the plural of unit symbols, e.g., write 45 kg, not 45 kgs, but do use the plural of written unit names, e.g..,
 several kilograms.
 · For technical writing, use symbols in conjunction with numerals, e.g., the area is 10 m2; write out unit names if

 E.3
 
 numerals are not used, e.g., carpet is measured in square meters. Numerals may be combined with written unit names
 in nontechnical writing, e.g., 10 meters.
 · Indicate the product of two or more units in symbolic form by using a dot positioned above the line, e.g., kg·m·s-2.
 · Do not mix names and symbols, e.g., write N·m or newton meter, not N·meter or newton·m.
 · Do not use a period after a symbol, e.g., write 12 g, not 12 g. except when it occurs at the end of a sentence.
 · Always use decimals, not fractions, e.g., write 0.75 g, not 3/4 g.
 · Use a zero before the decimal marker for values less than one, e.g., write 0.45 g, not .45 g.
 · Use spaces instead of commas to separate blocks of three digits for any number over four digits, e.g., write 45 138 kg
 or 0.004 46 kg or 4371 kg. Note that this does not apply to the expression of amounts of money.
 · In the United States, the decimal marker is a period; in other countries a comma usually is used.
 
 CONVERSION AND ROUNDING
 Soft Metric Conversion
 · Soft Metric means “No Physical Change.” This means that the product in question will not be physically modified to
 be used in a metric project but rather a direct mathematical conversion is performed to its exact (or nearly exact)
 metric equivalent.
 · All that is required is that the product literature and engineering data on these products be available with metric
 dimensions. It is acceptable if product literature contains both metric and english dimensions. Since product literature
 costs can be substantial, firms without metric product literature need only develop a supplement to their existing
 literature. Supplements will be accepted as submittals for an interim period.
 · There is no problem with competitive availability of soft converted products on a metric project, since these same
 products are competitively available today.
 · In the future, as standard international metric product sizes are developed by ISO (International Standard
 Organization) or another standards organization, these products may undergo modification to be compatible in the
 world market.
 Hard Metric Conversion
 · Hard Metric means “Product Requires Physical Change”. The product in question must be physically modified in
 order to be efficiently utilized in a metric project, which is planned on a metric grid.
 · A handful of currently used construction products must undergo hard conversion to new metric sizes.
 General Notes
 · When converting numbers from inch-pounds to metric, round the metric value to the same number of significant digits
 as there were in the inch-pound number, e.g., 11 miles at 1.609 km/mi equals 17.699 km, which rounds to 18 km.
 · Convert mixed inch-pound units (feet and inches, pounds and ounces) to the smaller inch-pound unit before
 converting to metric and rounding, e.g., 10 feet, 3 inches = 123 inches; 123 inches x 25.4 mm/in = 3124.2 mm; round
 to 3124 mm.
 · Wherever possible, convert measurements to rounded, rationalized “hard” metric numbers. For instance, if anchor
 bolts are to be embedded to a depth of 10 inches, the exact converted length of 254 mm might be rounded to either
 
 E.4
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 250 mm (9.84 inches) or 260 mm (10.24 inches). The less critical the number, the “rounder” it can be, but ensure that
 allowable tolerances or safety factors are not exceeded. When in doubt, stick with the exact “soft” conversion.
 · Round to “preferred” metric numbers. While the preferred numbers for the “1 foot = 12 inches” system are, in order
 of preference, those divisible by 12, 6, 4, 3, 2 and 1, preferred metric numbers are, in order of preference, those
 divisible by 10, 5, 2.5 and 1 or decimal multiples thereof.
 · Use hand calculators or software conversion programs that convert inch-pounds to metric. They are readily available
 and are indispensable to the conversion process.
 · Be careful with the decimal marker when converting areas and volumes; metric numbers can be significantly larger
 than inch-pound numbers (a cubic meter, for instance, is one billion cubic millimeters).
 
 VISUALIZING METRIC UNITS
 A few basic comparisons are worth remembering to help visualize metric units:
 · One meter is the length of a yardstick plus about 3-1/3 inches.
 · One gram is about the mass (weight) of a large paper clip.
 · One kilogram is about the mass (weight) of a one liter bottle of soda (about 2.2 pounds)
 · One liter is about the volume of a 4 inch cube (100 x 100 x 100 millimeters). One liter of water has a mass of 1
 kilogram.
 · One inch is just 1/64 inch longer than 25 millimeters (1 inch = 25.4 millimeters; 25 millimeters = 63/64 inch).
 · Four inches are about 1/16 inch longer than 100 millimeters (4 inches = 101.6 millimeters; 100 millimeters = 3-15/16
 inches).
 · One foot is about 3/16 inch longer than 300 millimeters (12 inches = 304.8 millimeters; 300 millimeters =
 11-13/16 inches).
 · The metric equivalent of a typical 2-foot by 4-foot ceiling grid is 600 x 1200 mm, so metric ceiling tiles and lighting
 fixtures are about 3/8 inch smaller in one dimension and 3/4 inch smaller in the other.
 · Similarly, the metric equivalent of a 4 by 8 sheet of plywood or drywall is 1200 x 2400 millimeters, so metric sheets
 are about 3/4 inch narrower and 1-1/2 inches shorter.
 · “Rounding down” from multiples of 4 inches to multiples of 100 mm makes dimensions exactly 1.6 percent smaller
 and areas about 3.2 percent smaller. About 3/16 inch is lost in every linear foot.
 · One foot is about 3/16 inch longer than 300 millimeters (12 inches = 304.8 millimeters; 300 millimeters =
 11-13/16 inches).

 USE OF METRIC UNITS IN DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION
 Linear Measurement (Length)
 · Use only the millimeter (mm), meter (m), and kilometer (km) in highway design and construction.
 · Use millimeters to represent all linear measurements less than one (1.0 meter).
 · Use meters to represent all linear dimensions greater than one (1.0 meter).
 · Use the kilometer for long distances and the micrometer for precision measurements.
 · Do not use the centimeter.
 · For survey measurement, use the meter and the kilometer.
 · Survey stationing will be at 100 meter intervals.
 · Since 1893, the U.S. basis of length measurement has been derived from metric standards. In 1959, the definition of
 the length of the “foot” was changed from 1200/3937 to 0.3048 exactly, which resulted in the new value being shorter
 by two parts in a million. At the same time it was decided that any data derived from and published as a result of
 geodetic surveys within the United States would remain with the old standard. Thus all land measurements in U.S.
 customary units are based upon the “U.S. survey foot” which related to the meter by the old standard (1200/3937 =
 0.304 800 610). MHD survey is based on the “U.S. survey foot”.
 Area
 · The square meter (m2) is preferred.
 · Very large areas may be expressed in square kilometers (km2) and very small areas, in square millimeters (mm2)
 · Use the hectare (ha) which is equal to 10 000 square meters for land and water measurement only.
 · Do not use the square centimeter.
 · Linear dimensions such as 40 mm x 90 mm may be used; if so, indicate width first and length second.
 Volume and Fluid Capacity
 · Cubic meter (m3) is preferred for dry volumes in construction and for large storage tanks.
 · Use liter (L) and milliliter (mL) for fluid capacity (liquid volume).
 Plane and Solid Angles, and Slope
 · Plane angles in surveying (cartography) will continue to be measured in degrees (either decimal degrees or degrees,
 minutes, and seconds) rather than the metric radian.
 · The radian (rad) and steradian (sr) denote plane and solid angles. They are used in lighting work and in various
 engineering calculations.
 · Slope is expressed as a non-dimensional ratio – avoid the use of angles or percentages. The vertical component is
 shown first and then the horizontal. For instance, a rise of one meter in four meters is expressed as 1:4. The units that
 are compared should be the same (meters to meters, millimeters to millimeters, etc.)
 
 Massachusetts Highway Department
 1995 Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges
 
 E.7
 
 · For slopes less than 45°, the vertical component should be unitary (for example, 1:20). For slopes over 45°, the
 horizontal component should be unitary (for example, 5:1)
 Time
 · The preferred unit of time is the second (s).
 · In cases where time relates to life customs or calendar cycles, the minute, hour, day, and other calendar units may be
 necessary. For example, vehicle speed will normally be expressed in kilometers per hour.
 Temperature
 · Celsius temperature (°C) – formerly called centigrade – is more commonly used than kelvin (K) and will be used by
 MHD. Both have the same temperature gradients, i.e., Celsius temperature is simply 273.15 degrees warmer than
 kelvin, which begins at absolute zero. For instance, water freezes at 273.15 K and at 0 °C, while it boils at 373.15 K
 and at 100 °C. To move between Celsius and Kelvin, add or subtract 273.15, i.e., temperature in Celsius =
 temperature in Kelvin minus 273.15.
 Mass, Force, and Weight
 · The kilogram (kg) is the base unit for mass, which is the unit quantity of matter independent of gravity.
 · The metric ton (t), which is equal to 1000 kg, is used to denote large loads such as those used in excavating.
 · The newton (N) is the derived unit for force (mass times acceleration, or kg·m/s2). For calculations where the force is
 due to the self-weight of an object, acceleration is the acceleration due to gravity and is equal to
 2
 9.81 m/s .
 · The principal departure of the metric system from other measuring systems is the use of explicitly distinct units for
 mass and force. In metric, the name kilogram is restricted to the unit of mass, and the kilogram-force (from which the
 suffix force was in practice often erroneously dropped) should not be used. In its place the metric unit of force, the
 newton, is used (see next page). Likewise, the newton rather than the kilogram-force is used to form derived units
 2
 which include force, for example, pressure or stress (N/m = Pa), energy (N·m = J), and power (N·m/s = W).
 · Considerable confusion exists in the use of the term weight as a quantity to mean either force or mass. In commercial
 and everyday use, the term weight nearly always means mass; thus, when one speaks of a person’s weight the quantity
 referred to is mass. This nontechnical use of the term weight in everyday life will probably persist. In science and
 technology, the term weight of a body has usually meant the force that if applied to the body, would give it an
 acceleration equal to the local acceleration of free fall. The use of force of gravity (mass time acceleration of gravity)
 instead of weight with this meaning is often recommended. Because of the dual use of the term weight as a quantity,
 this term should be avoided in technical practice except under circumstances in which its meaning is completely clear.
 When the term is used, it is important to know whether mass or force is intended and to use metric units properly, by
 using kilograms for mass or newtons for force.
 · The term load means either mass or force, depending on its use. A load that produces a vertically downward force
 because of the influence of gravity acting on a mass may be expressed in mass units (kilograms). Any other load is
 expressed in force units (Newtons).
 Pressure, Stress, and Elastic Modulus
 · The pascal (Pa) is the unit for pressure and stress and is defined as Pa = N/mm2. The term “bar” is not a metric unit
 and should not be used.
 · Structural calculations should be shown in MPa or kPa. It may be convenient to note that MPa = N/mm2.

 Energy
 ·
 
 The joule (J) is the unit for energy and is defined as J = N·m.
 
 ·
 
 The joule is used wherever energy is specified, such as energy absorption in Charpy V-notch tests.
 
 ·
 
 Do not use the joule to designate torque or bending moment, always use newton-meter (N·m) or kilonewtonmeter (kN·m).
