 Foreword
 These Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge, and Municipal Construction have been
 developed to serve as a baseline for the work delivered to the public by the Washington State
 Department of Transportation (WSDOT). The Standard Specifications are incorporated into
 the written agreement (Contract) between WSDOT as Contracting Agency and the Contractor,
 except where the Contract indicates that a particular specification has been amended or
 replaced with a special provision to resolve project-specific issues. The decision to amend or
 replace any standard specification with a special provision is made during the design process
 and is based upon the sound engineering judgment of the project designer.
 These Standard Specifications reflect years of refinement through the literally hundreds
 of projects the Department delivers each year. In addition, the standards are the result of
 countless hours of development and review by both our internal WSDOT staff as well
 as our industry partners through the joint WSDOT/Associated General Contractors’
 Standing Committees.
 Finally, these standards reflect the contracting philosophy and balance of risk-allocation
 that the Department has adopted through the years. We believe that this balance of risks
 provides us the lowest final cost solution to our transportation needs. For example, shifting
 risk to the Contractor can provide more certainty on final cost, but may result in higher initial
 cost. On the other hand, accepting more risk by the owner can result in lower initial costs, but
 less certainty on the final cost. We at the Department of Transportation believe that we have
 reached the optimum point of balance for risk, and we will continue to consider this balance
 on all future specification revisions.
 The language above indicates that these specifications are to be used only as a guideline
 during the design process, and that is true. Once they have been incorporated into a Contract,
 however, they become the legal and enforceable language of that Contract. The Standard
 Specifications, the Amendments to the Standards, and the Project Special Provisions, along
 with any attachments in the Contract documents, define a Contract and are no longer seen as
 guidelines. Rather, they are the written agreement, subject to revision only through the change
 order process.
 This preface is for informational purposes only and is not to be used to interpret or affect
 the terms.

 Bid Procedures and Conditions

 1-02  Bid Procedures and Conditions
 1-02.1  Prequalification of Bidders
 The Contracting Agency will provide a Bid Proposal Form only after a prospective Bidder
 submits a “Standard Questionnaire and Financial Statement”. This questionnaire enables the
 Contracting Agency to decide whether or not the Bidder is qualified to perform Highway,
 road, or other public work. The questionnaire shall be sworn to before a person authorized
 to take oaths.
 On the basis of this questionnaire, the Contracting Agency will either specify the type
 and amount of Work it considers the prospective Bidder prequalified to perform or advise
 the prospective Bidder of the reasons they failed to be prequalified. To remain prequalified,
 the Bidder must submit an updated questionnaire once a year and supplements whenever
 required by the Contracting Agency.
 A submittal deadline applies to any prospective Bidder not prequalified or from whom
 a supplemental questionnaire is due. To receive consideration for issuance of a Bid Proposal
 Form on a specific project, the questionnaire (or supplement) must be received by the
 Prequalification Engineer no less than 15 days prior to the scheduled Bid opening.
 The Contracting Agency may withdraw a Bidder’s prequalification or reduce its amount if:
 1. The extent of other work the Bidder has under Contract (Contracting Agency or
 otherwise) justifies such action, or
 2. Past or present work on a Contracting Agency Contract has been less than satisfactory.
 If a Bidder’s questionnaire does not contain sufficient information, the Contracting Agency
 may refuse to provide a Bid Proposal Form and disregard any Bid submitted. After opening
 Bids, the Contracting Agency may decide that a prequalified Bidder is not responsible and
 may refuse to accept the Bid on that basis. Such a refusal will be conclusive unless the
 Bidder appeals within five days to the Superior Court of Thurston County. Any appeal shall
 be heard within ten days after it is filed and shall provide at least five days’ notice to the
 Contracting Agency.
 The Bidder shall ensure that the combination of the Bid amount and other Contract work
 with the Contracting Agency does not exceed the prequalification amount. If this combination
 does exceed the prequalification amount, the Contracting Agency may determine the Bidder
 to be not responsible and refuse to Award a Contract.
 Two or more prospective Bidders may, in a joint venture, prequalify and Bid jointly on
 a single Contract. Each shall have filed a “Standard Questionnaire and Financial Statement”.
 Together they shall also file a standard form of “Individual Project Statement of Joint Venture”
 and a joint venture agreement in a form acceptable to the Contracting Agency.
 To Bid jointly on a continuous joint venture on more than one Contract, two or more
 prospective Bidders shall submit:
 1. A “Standard Questionnaire and Financial Statement” compiled for the joint venture;
 2. A “Standard Questionnaire and Financial Statement” for each member (if the
 Contracting Agency has no copy on file); and
 3. A copy of the “Joint Venture Agreement” signed by each member of the joint venture
 and naming each person authorized to sign documents on its behalf. (If any member
 is a corporation, a corporate resolution shall accompany the agreement. This resolution
 shall authorize the joint venture agreement and name the officer(s) authorized to sign
 the joint venture agreement or Contract on behalf of the corporation.)
 The Contracting Agency will treat the continuing joint venture as a new firm and decide
 its prequalification on that basis.
 Any joint venture and each of its members is subject to Section 1-02.14.

 Payment will be made on the basis of the actual quantities of each item of Work completed
 in accordance with the Contract requirements.
 1-02.4  Examination of Plans, Specifications, and Site of Work
 1-02.4(1)  General
 The Bidder shall carefully examine the Bid Documents as defined in Section 1-01.3.

 performance; and
 f.	 The site biological hazards and associated physical hazards.
 3.	 Has satisfied itself as to the character, quality, and quantity of surface and subsurface
 materials or obstacles to be encountered insofar as this information is reasonably
 ascertainable from an inspection of the Work site (including material sites) as well
 as from the Bid Documents and other information made a part of this Contract; and
 4.	 Has satisfied itself as to the adequacy of time allowed for the completion of the
 physical Work on the Contract.
 Any failure of the Bidder to take the actions described and acknowledged in this clause
 shall not relieve the Bidder from responsibility for estimating properly the difficulty and cost
 of successfully performing the Work, or from proceeding to successfully perform the Work
 without additional expense to the Contracting Agency.
 The Bidder agrees that the Contracting Agency shall not be liable to it on any claim
 for additional payment or additional time or any claim whatsoever if the claim directly or
 indirectly results from the Bidder’s failure to investigate and familiarize itself sufficiently
 with the conditions under which the Contract is to be performed.
 The Bidder shall be familiar and comply with all Federal, State, tribal, and local laws,
 ordinances, and regulations which might affect those engaged in the Work. The Contracting
 Agency will not consider any plea of misunderstanding or ignorance of such requirements.
 Bid prices shall reflect what the Bidder anticipates to be the cost of completing the Work,
 including methods, materials, labor, and equipment. Except as the Contract may provide,
 the Bidder shall receive no payment for any costs that exceed those in the Bid prices.
 Prospective Bidders are advised that projects with Work on or adjacent to water may
 require insurance coverage in compliance with:
 1.	 The Longshoremen’s and Harbor Worker’s Compensation Act (administered
 by U.S. Department of Labor), or
 2.	 The State Industrial Insurance (administrated by the Washington State Department
 of Labor and Industries), or
 3.	 Both.
 The Contractor shall bear all cost for such insurance as provided in Section 1-07.10.
 No Claim shall be allowed because of any ambiguity in the Contract if:
 1.	 The Bidder discovers an ambiguity but fails to notify the Contracting Agency, or
 2.	 The Bidder failed to discover a patent ambiguity that would be discovered
 by a reasonably prudent contractor in preparing its Bid.
 Any prospective Bidder desiring an explanation or interpretation of the Bid Documents,
 shall request the explanation or interpretation in writing by close of business on the Thursday
 preceding the bid opening to allow a written reply to reach all prospective Bidders before
 the submission of their Bids. Oral explanations, interpretations, or instructions given by
 anyone before the Award of a Contract will not be binding on the Contracting Agency.
 Any information given a prospective Bidder concerning any of the Bid Documents will be
 furnished to all prospective Bidders as an Addendum if that information is deemed by the
 Contracting Agency to be necessary in submitting Bids or if the Contracting Agency concludes
 that the lack of the information would be prejudicial to other prospective Bidders.

 Bid Procedures and Conditions
 
 1-02.4(2)  Subsurface Information
 If the Contracting Agency has made subsurface investigation of the site of the proposed
 Work, the boring log data, soil sample test data, and geotechnical recommendations reports
 obtained by the Contracting Agency will be made available for inspection by the Bidders
 at the location specified in the Special Provisions. The Summary of Geotechnical Conditions,

 as to the condition, materials, or proportions of the materials between the specific borings
 regardless of any subsurface information the Contracting Agency may make available to the
 prospective Bidders.
 The availability of subsurface information from the Contracting Agency shall not relieve
 the Bidder or the Contractor from any risks or of any duty to make examinations and
 investigations as required by Section 1-02.4(1) or any other responsibility under the Contract
 or as may be required by law.
 1-02.5  Proposal Forms

 minimum 5 percent required. The Surety shall: (1) be registered with the Washington State
 Insurance Commissioner, and (2) appear on the current Authorized Insurance List in the State
 of Washington published by the Office of the Insurance Commissioner.
 The failure to furnish a Bid deposit of a minimum of 5 percent with the Bid or as a physical
 supplement to the electronic Proposal Form shall make the Bid nonresponsive and shall cause
 the Bid to be rejected by the Contracting Agency.

 file a sworn or unsworn statement executed by, or on behalf of the person, firm, association, or
 corporation submitting the Bid, certifying that such persons, firm, association, or corporation
 has not either directly or indirectly, entered into any agreement, participated in any collusion,
 or otherwise taken any action in restraint of free competitive Bidding in connection with
 the submitted Bid. Failure to submit the sworn or unsworn statement as part of the Bid
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 for the declaration to prospective Bidders and that the declaration shall be executed by such
 persons, firm, association, or corporation under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
 United States.
 Therefore, by including the Non-collusion Declaration as part of the signed bid Proposal,
 the Bidder is deemed to have certified and agreed to the requirements of the Declaration.

 lobbying by the Contractor and any Subcontractor or lower tier subcontractor whose contract
 exceeds $100,000. A Certification for Federal-Aid Contracts (WSDOT Form 272-040) is
 provided in the Proposal Form for Contracts exceeding $100,000 to address this requirement.

 Award and Execution of Contract
 
 1-03  Award and Execution of Contract
 1-03.1  Consideration of Bids
 After opening and reading Proposals, the Contracting Agency will check them for
 correctness of extensions of the prices per unit and the total price. If a discrepancy exists
 between the price per unit and the extended amount of any Bid item, the price per unit will
 control. The total of extensions, corrected where necessary, will be used by the Contracting
 Agency for Award purposes and to fix the amount of the Contract Bond.
 The right is reserved by the Contracting Agency to waive informalities in the bidding,
 accept a Proposal of the lowest responsible Bidder, reject any or all Bids, republish the call
 for Bids, revise or cancel the Work, or require the Work to be done in another way if the best
 interest of the Contracting Agency is served.
 A Bidder who wishes to claim error after the Bids have been publicly opened and read
 as required by RCW 47.28.090 shall promptly notify the Contracting Agency that an error
 occurred. The Bidder shall submit a notarized affidavit or declaration under penalty of perjury
 signed by the Bidder and accompanied by the work sheets used in the preparation of the Bid,
 requesting relief from the responsibilities of Award. The affidavit or declaration shall describe
 the specific error(s) and certify that the work sheets are the ones used in preparing the Bid.
 The affidavit or declaration shall be submitted no later than 5:00 p.m. on the first business
 day after Bid opening or the claim will not be considered. The Contracting Agency will
 review the affidavit or declaration and the certified work sheets to determine the validity of
 the claimed error and if the error is of the kind for which the law allows relief from forfeiture
 of the Bid deposit. If the Contracting Agency concurs in the claim of error and determines
 that the error is of the kind which allows relief from forfeiture, the Bidder will be relieved
 of responsibility and the Bid deposit of the Bidder will be returned. If the Contracting
 Agency does not concur in the error or determines that the error is not the kind for which
 the law allows relief, the Contracting Agency may Award the Contract and if the Bidder
 refuses to execute the Contract, the Bidder’s Bid deposit shall be forfeited as required by
 RCW 47.28.100.
 1-03.1(1)  Identical Bid Totals
 After opening Bids, if two or more lowest responsive Bid totals are exactly equal, then
 the tie-breaker will be determined by drawing as described in this section. Two or more
 slips of paper will be marked as follows: one marked “Winner” and the other(s) marked
 “unsuccessful”. The slips will be folded to make the marking unseen. The slips will be
 placed inside a box. One authorized representative of each Bidder shall draw a slip from
 the box. Bidders shall draw in alphabetic order by the name of the firm as registered with
 the Washington State Department of Licensing. The slips shall be unfolded and the firm
 with the slip marked “Winner” will be determined to be the successful Bidder and eligible
 for Award of the Contract. Only those Bidders who submitted a Bid total that is exactly
 equal to the lowest responsive Bid are eligible to draw.
 1-03.2  Award of Contract
 Normally, Contract Award or Bid rejection will occur within 45 calendar days after Bid
 opening. If the lowest responsible Bidder and the Contracting Agency agree, this deadline
 may be extended. If they cannot agree on an extension by the 45 calendar day deadline, the
 Contracting Agency reserves the right to Award the Contract to the next lowest responsible
 Bidder or reject all Bids. The Contracting Agency will notify the successful Bidder of the
 Contract Award in writing.

 Award and Execution of Contract
 
 1-03
 
 1-03.3  Execution of Contract
 Within 20 calendar days after the Award date, the successful Bidder shall return the
 signed Contracting Agency-prepared Contract, an insurance certification as required by
 Section 1-07.18, and a satisfactory bond as required by law and Section 1-03.4, and shall
 be registered as a contractor in the state of Washington.
 Until the Contracting Agency executes a Contract, no Proposal shall bind the Contracting
 Agency nor shall any Work begin within the project limits or within Contracting Agencyfurnished sites. The Contractor shall bear all risks for any Work begun outside such areas
 and for any materials ordered before the Contract is executed by the Contracting Agency.
 If the Bidder experiences circumstances beyond their control that prevents return of the
 Contract documents within 20 calendar days after the Award date, the Contracting Agency
 may grant up to a maximum of 20 additional calendar days for return of the documents,
 provided the Contracting Agency deems the circumstances warrant it.
 1-03.4  Contract Bond
 The successful Bidder shall provide an executed Contract Bond for the full
 Contract amount. This Contract Bond shall:
 1.	 Be on a Contracting Agency-furnished form;
 2.	 Be signed by an approved Surety (or Sureties) that:
 a.	 Is registered with the Washington State Insurance Commissioner; and
 b.	 Appears on the current Authorized Insurance List in the State of Washington
 published by the Office of the Insurance Commissioner,
 3.	 Be conditioned upon the faithful performance of the Contract by the Contractor within
 the prescribed time;
 4.	 Be conditioned upon the payment of taxes, increases, and penalties incurred on the
 project under titles 50, 51, and 82 RCW; and
 5.	 Guarantee that the Surety shall indemnify, defend, and protect the Contracting Agency
 against any claim of direct or indirect loss resulting from the failure:
 a.	 Of the Contractor (or any of the employees, Subcontractors, or lower tier
 subcontractors of the Contractor) to faithfully perform the Contract; or
 b.	 Of the Contractor (or the Subcontractors or lower tier subcontractors of the
 Contractor) to pay all laborers, mechanics, Subcontractors, lower tier subcontractors,
 material person, or any other person who provides supplies or provisions for
 carrying out the Work.
 The Contracting Agency may require Sureties or Surety companies on the Contract Bond
 to appear and qualify themselves. Whenever the Contracting Agency deems the Surety or
 Sureties to be inadequate, it may, upon written demand, require the Contractor to furnish
 additional Surety to cover any remaining Work. Until the added Surety is furnished, payments
 on the Contract will stop.
 1-03.5  Failure to Execute Contract
 Failure to return the insurance certification and bond with the signed Contract as required
 in Section 1-03.3, or failure to provide Disadvantaged, Minority or Women’s Business
 Enterprise information if required in the Contract, or failure or refusal to sign the Contract,
 or failure to register as a contractor in the state of Washington shall result in forfeiture of the
 proposal bond or deposit of this Bidder. If this should occur, the Contracting Agency may then
 Award the Contract to the second lowest responsible Bidder or reject all remaining Bids. If
 the second lowest responsible Bidder fails to return the required documents as stated above
 within the time provided after Award, the Contract may then be Awarded successively in a like
 manner to the remaining lowest responsible Bidders until the above requirements are met or
 the remaining Proposals are rejected.

 1-03.6  Return of Bid Deposit
 When Proposals have been examined and corrected as necessary, proposal bonds and
 deposits accompanying Proposals ineligible for further consideration will be returned.
 All other proposal bonds and deposits will be held until the Contract has been properly
 executed. When the Contract has been properly executed, all remaining deposits or bonds,
 except those subject to forfeiture, will be returned.
 1-03.7  Judicial Review
 Any decision made by the Contracting Agency regarding the Award and execution of the
 Contract or Bid rejection shall be conclusive subject to the scope of judicial review permitted
 under Washington Law. Such review, if any, shall be timely filed in the Superior Court of
 Thurston County, Washington.

 1-04  Scope of the Work
 1-04.1  Intent of the Contract
 The intent of the Contract is to prescribe a complete Work. Omissions from the Contract
 of details of Work that are necessary to carry out the intent of the Contract shall not relieve
 the Contractor from performing the omitted Work.
 1-04.1(1)  Bid Items Included in the Proposal
 The Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, tools, equipment, transportation, supplies,
 and incidentals required to complete all Work for the items included in the Proposal.
 1-04.1(2)  Bid Items Not Included in the Proposal
 When the Contract specifies Work that has no Bid item, and the Work is not specified as
 being included with or incidental to other Bid items, an equitable adjustment will be made in
 accordance with Section 1-04.4 unless that Work is customarily considered as incidental to
 other items.
 1-04.2  Coordination of Contract Documents, Plans, Special Provisions, Specifications,
 and Addenda
 The complete Contract includes these parts: the Contract Form, Bidder’s completed
 Proposal Form, Contract Plans, Contract Provisions, Standard Specifications, Standard Plans,
 Addenda, various certifications and affidavits, supplemental agreements, change orders, and
 subsurface boring logs (if any). These parts complement each other in describing a complete
 Work. Any requirement in one part binds as if stated in all parts. The Contractor shall provide
 any Work or materials clearly implied in the Contract even if the Contract does not mention
 it specifically.
 Any inconsistency in the parts of the Contract shall be resolved by following this order of
 precedence (e.g., 1 presiding over 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7; 2 presiding over 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7; and
 so forth):
 1.	Addenda,
 2.	 Proposal Form,
 3.	 Special Provisions,
 4.	 Contract Plans,
 5.	 Amendments to the Standard Specifications,
 6.	 Standard Specifications, and
 7.	 Standard Plans.
 On the Contract Plans, Working Drawings, and Standard Plans, figured dimensions shall
 take precedence over scaled dimensions.
 This order of precedence shall not apply when Work is required by one part of the Contract
 but omitted from another part or parts of the Contract. The Work required in one part must be
 furnished even if not mentioned in other parts of the Contract.
 Whenever reference is made in these Specifications or the Special Provisions to codes,
 rules, specifications, and standards, the reference shall be construed to mean the code, rule,
 specification, or standard that is in effect on the Bid advertisement date, unless otherwise
 stated or as required by law.
 If any part of the Contract requires Work that does not include a description for how
 the Work is to be performed, the Work shall be performed in accordance with standard
 trade practice(s). For purposes of the Contract, a standard trade practice is one having such
 regularity of observance in the trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed by the
 Contractor in doing the Work.
 In case of any ambiguity or dispute over interpreting the Contract, the Engineer’s decision
 will be final as provided in Section 1-05.1.

 Scope of the Work
 
 1-04.3  Reference Information
 Reference Information provided to the Contractor is not part of the Contract. The
 Contracting Agency does not guarantee the accuracy of the Reference Information and is
 not responsible for the content of the Reference Information in any manner. Any use of
 Reference Information by the Contractor is done solely at the Contractor’s risk. If a document
 that is provided as reference information contains material also included as a part of the
 Contract, that portion of the document shall be considered a part of the Contract and not
 as Reference Information.
 1-04.4  Changes
 The Engineer reserves the right to make, at any time during the Work, such changes in
 quantities and such alterations in the Work as are necessary to satisfactorily complete the
 project. Such changes in quantities and alterations shall not invalidate the Contract nor
 release the Surety, and the Contractor agrees to perform the Work as altered. Among others,
 these changes and alterations may include:
 1.	 Deleting any part of the Work.
 2.	 Increasing or decreasing quantities.
 3.	 Altering Specifications, designs, or both.
 4.	 Altering the way the Work is to be done.
 5.	 Adding new Work.
 6.	 Altering facilities, equipment, materials, services, or sites, provided by the Contracting
 Agency.
 7.	 Ordering the Contractor to speed up or delay the Work.
 The Engineer will issue a written change order for any change unless the remainder of this
 section provides otherwise.
 If the alterations or changes in quantities significantly change the character of the Work
 under the Contract, whether or not changed by any such different quantities or alterations, an
 adjustment, excluding loss of anticipated profits, will be made to the Contract. The basis for
 the adjustment shall be agreed upon prior to the performance of the Work. If a basis cannot
 be agreed upon, then an adjustment will be made either for or against the Contractor in such
 amount as the Engineer may determine to be fair and equitable. If the alterations or changes
 in quantities do not significantly change the character of the Work to be performed under the
 Contract, the altered Work will be paid for as provided elsewhere in the Contract. The term
 significant change shall be construed to apply only to the following circumstances:
 A.	 When the character of the Work as altered differs materially in kind or nature from that
 involved or included in the original proposed construction; or
 B.	 When an item of Work, as defined elsewhere in the Contract, is increased in excess of
 125 percent or decreased below 75 percent of the original Contract quantity. For the
 purpose of this Section, an item of Work will be defined as any item that qualifies for
 adjustment under the provisions of Section 1-04.6.
 For item 1, an equitable adjustment for deleted Work will be made as provided in
 Section 1-09.5.
 For item 2, if the actual quantity of any item, exclusive of added or deleted amounts
 included in agreed change orders, increases or decreases by more than 25 percent from the
 original Plan quantity, the unit Contract prices for that item may be adjusted in accordance
 with Section 1-04.6.
 For any changes except item 1 (deleted Work) or item 2 (increasing or decreasing
 quantities), the Engineer will determine if the change should be paid for at unit Contract
 price(s). If the Engineer determines that the change increased or decreased the Contractor’s
 costs or time to do any of the Work including unchanged Work, the Engineer will make an
 equitable adjustment to the Contract. The equitable adjustment will be by agreement with
 Page 1-20
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Scope of the Work
 
 1-04
 
 the Contractor. However, if the parties are unable to agree, the Engineer will determine the
 amount of the equitable adjustment in accordance with Section 1-09.4 and adjust the time
 as the Engineer deems appropriate. Extensions of time will be evaluated in accordance with
 Section 1-08.8. The Engineer’s decision concerning equitable adjustment and extension of
 time shall be final as provided in Section 1-05.1.
 The Contractor shall proceed with the Work upon receiving:
 1.	 A written change order approved by the Engineer, or
 2.	 An oral order from the Engineer before actually receiving the written change order.
 Within 14 calendar days of delivery of the change order the contractor shall endorse
 and return the change order, request an extension of time for endorsement or respond in
 accordance with Section 1-04.5. The Contracting Agency may unilaterally process the change
 order if the Contractor fails to comply with these requirements. Changes normally noted on
 field stakes or variations from estimated quantities, except as provided in subparagraph A or B
 above, will not require a written change order. These changes shall be made at the unit prices
 that apply. The Contractor shall respond immediately to changes shown on field stakes without
 waiting for further notice.
 The Contractor shall obtain written consent of the Surety or Sureties if the Engineer
 requests such consent.
 1-04.4(1)  Minor Changes
 Payments or credits for changes amounting to $25,000 or less may be made under the
 Bid item “Minor Change”. At the discretion of the Contracting Agency, this procedure
 for Minor Changes may be used in lieu of the more formal procedure as outlined in
 Section 1-04.4, Changes.
 The Contractor will be provided a copy of the completed order for Minor Change.
 The agreement for the Minor Change will be documented by signature of the Contractor,
 or notation of verbal agreement. If the Contractor is in disagreement with anything required
 by the order for Minor Change, the Contractor may protest the order as provided in
 Section 1-04.5.
 Payments or credits will be determined in accordance with Section 1-09.4. For the purpose
 of providing a common Proposal for all Bidders, the Contracting Agency has entered an
 amount for “Minor Change” in the Proposal to become a part of the total Bid by the Contractor.
 1-04.4(2)  Value Engineering Change Proposal (VECP)
 1-04.4(2)A General
 A VECP is a Contractor proposed change to the Contract Provisions which will accomplish
 the projects functional requirements in a manner that is equal to or better than the requirements
 in the Contract. The VECP may be: (1) at a less cost or time, or (2) either no cost savings or a
 minor increase in cost with a reduction in Contract time. The net savings or added costs to the
 Contract Work are shared by the Contractor and Contracting Agency.
 The Contractor may submit a VECP for changing the Plans, Specifications, or other
 requirements of the Contract. The Engineer’s decision to accept or reject all or part of the
 proposal is final and not subject to arbitration under the arbitration clause or otherwise subject
 to litigation.
 The VECP shall meet all of the following:
 1.	 Not adversely affect the long term life cycle costs.
 2.	 Not adversely impact the ability to perform maintenance.
 3.	 Provide the required safety and appearance.
 4.	 Provide substitution for deleted or reduced Condition of Award Work, Apprentice
 Utilization and Training.
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 1-21
 
 1-04
 
 Scope of the Work
 
 VECPs that provide a time reduction shall meet the following requirements:
 1.	 Time saving is a direct result of the VECP.
 2.	 Liquidated damages penalties are not used to calculate savings.
 3.	 Administrative/overhead cost savings experienced by either the Contractor or
 Contracting Agency as a result of time reduction accrue to each party and are not used
 to calculate savings.
 1-04.4(2)B  VECP Savings
 1-04.4(2)B1  Proposal Savings
 The incentive payment to the Contractor shall be one-half of the net savings of the proposal
 calculated as follows:
 1.	 (gross cost of deleted work) – (gross cost of added work) = (gross savings)
 2.	 (gross savings) – (Contractor’s engineering costs) – (Contracting Agency’s costs) =
 (net savings)
 3.	 (net savings) / 2 = (incentive pay)
 The Contracting Agency’s costs shall be the actual consultant costs billed to the
 Contracting Agency and in-house costs. Costs for personnel assigned to the Engineer’s office
 shall not be included.
 1-04.4(2)B2  Added Costs to Achieve Time Savings
 The cost to achieve the time savings shall be calculated as follows:
 1.	 (cost of added work) + (Contractor’s engineering costs - Contracting Agency’s
 engineering costs) = (cost to achieve time savings)
 2.	 (cost to achieve time savings) / 2 = (Contracting Agency’s share of added cost)
 If the timesaving proposal also involves deleting work and, as a result, creates a savings for
 the Contracting Agency, then the Contractor shall also receive one-half of the savings realized
 through the deletion.
 1-04.4(2)C  VECP Approval
 1-04.4(2)C1  Concept Approval
 The Contractor shall submit a written proposal to the Engineer for consideration.
 The proposal shall contain the following information:
 1.	 An explanation outlining the benefit provided by the change(s).
 2.	 A narrative description of the proposed change(s). If applicable, the discussion shall
 include a demonstration of functional equivalency or a description of how the proposal
 meets the original contract scope of work.
 3.	 A cost discussion estimating any net savings. Savings estimates will generally follow
 the outline below under the section, “Proposal Savings”.
 4.	 A statement providing the Contracting Agency with the right to use all or any part of the
 proposal on future projects without future obligation or compensation.
 5.	 A statement acknowledging and agreeing that the Engineer’s decision to accept or reject
 all or part of the proposal is final and not subject to arbitration under the arbitration
 clause or otherwise be subject to claims or disputes.
 6.	 A statement giving the dates the Engineer must make a decision to accept or reject the
 conceptual proposal, the date that approval to proceed must be received, and the date
 the work must begin in order to not delay the contract. If the Contracting Agency does
 not approve the VECP by the date specified by the Contractor in their proposal the
 VECP will be deemed rejected.
 7.	 The submittal will include an analysis on other Work that may have costs that changed
 as a result of the VECP. Traffic control and erosion control shall both be included in
 addition to any other impacted Work.

 After review of the proposal, the Engineer will respond in writing with acceptance or
 rejection of the concept. This acceptance shall not be construed as authority to proceed with
 any change contract work. Concept approval allows the Contractor to proceed with the Work
 needed to develop final plans and other information to receive formal approval and to support
 preparation of a change order.
 1-04.4(2)C2  Formal Approval
 The Contractor’s submittal to the Engineer for formal approval shall include the following:
 1.	 Deleted Work – Include the calculated quantities of unit price Work to be deleted.
 Include the proposed partial prices for portions of lump sum Work deleted. For deletion
 of force account items include the time and material estimates.
 2.	 Added Work – Include the calculated quantities of unit price Work to be added, either
 by original unit Contract prices or by new, negotiated unit prices. For new items of
 Work include the quantities and proposed prices.
 3.	 Contractor’s Engineering Costs – Submit the labor costs for the engineering to develop
 the proposal; costs for Contractor employees utilized in contract operations on a regular
 basis shall not be included.
 4.	 Schedule Analysis – If the VECP is related to time savings, the Contractor shall submit
 a partial progress schedule showing the changed Work. The submittal shall also include
 a discussion comparing the partial progress schedule with the approved progress
 schedule for the project.
 5.	 Working Drawings – Type 3 Working Drawings shall be submitted; those drawings
 which require engineering shall be a Type 3E.
 Formal approval of the proposal will be documented by issuance of a change order.
 The VECP change order will contain the following statements which the Contractor agrees
 to by signing the change order:
 1.	 The Contractor accepts design risk of all features, both temporary and permanent,
 of the changed Work.
 2.	 The Contractor accepts risk of constructability of the changed Work.
 3.	 The Contractor provides the Contracting Agency with the right to use all or any part
 of the proposal on future projects without further obligation or compensation.
 VECP change orders will contain separate pay items for the items that are applicable to
 the Proposal. These are as follows:
 1.	 Deleted Work.
 2.	 Added Work.
 3.	 The Contractor’s engineering costs, reimbursed at 100 percent of the Contractor’s cost.
 4.	 Incentive payment to the Contractor.
 When added Work costs exceed Deleted Work costs, but time savings make a viable
 proposal, then items 3 and 4 above are replaced with the following:
 3.	 The Contracting Agency’s share of added cost to achieve time savings.
 4.	 The Contractor’s share of savings from deleted Work.
 1-04.4(2)C3  Authority to Proceed with Changed Work
 The authority for the Contractor to proceed with the VECP Work will be provided by
 one of the following options:
 1.	 Execution of the VECP change order, or
 2.	 At the Contractor’s request the Contracting Agency may provide approval by letter
 from the Engineer for the Work to proceed prior to execution of a change order. All
 of the risk for proceeding with the VECP shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.
 Additionally, the following criteria are required to have been met:
 a.	 Concept approval has been granted by the Contracting Agency.
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 1-23
 
 1-04
 
 Scope of the Work
 b.	 All design reviews and approvals have been completed, including plans
 and specifications.
 c.	 The Contractor has guaranteed, in writing, the minimum savings to the
 Contracting Agency.
 
 1-04.5  Procedure and Protest by the Contractor
 The Contractor accepts all requirements of a change order by: (1) endorsing it, (2) writing a
 separate acceptance, (3) not responding within the allotted time as outlined in Section 1-04.4,
 or (4) not protesting in the way this section provides. A change order that is not protested as
 provided in this section shall be full payment and final settlement of all claims for Contract
 time and for all costs of any kind, including costs of delays, related to any Work either covered
 or affected by the change. By not protesting as this section provides, the Contractor also
 waives any additional entitlement and accepts from the Engineer any written or oral order
 (including directions, instructions, interpretations, and determinations).
 If in disagreement with anything required in a change order, another written order, or
 an oral order from the Engineer, including any direction, instruction, interpretation, or
 determination by the Engineer, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Immediately give a signed written notice of protest to the Engineer or the Engineer’s
 field Inspectors before doing the Work;
 2.	 Supplement the written protest within 14 calendar days with a written statement and
 supporting documents providing the following:
 a.	 The date and nature of the protested order, direction, instruction, interpretation
 or determination;
 b.	 A full discussion of the circumstances which caused the protest, including names
 of persons involved, time, duration and nature of the Work involved, and a review
 of the Plans and Contract Provisions referenced to support the protest;
 c.	 The estimated dollar cost, if any, of the protested Work and a detailed breakdown
 showing how that estimate was determined;
 d.	 An analysis of the progress schedule showing the schedule change or disruption
 if the Contractor is asserting a schedule change or disruption; and
 e.	 If the protest is continuing, the information required above shall be supplemented
 upon request by the Engineer until the protest is resolved.
 Throughout any protested Work, the Contractor shall keep complete records of extra costs
 and time incurred. The Contractor shall permit the Engineer access to these and any other
 records related to the protested Work as determined by the Engineer.
 The Engineer will evaluate all protests provided the procedures in this section are followed.
 If the Engineer determines that a protest is valid, the Engineer will adjust payment for Work
 or time by an equitable adjustment in accordance with Section 1-09.4. Extensions of time
 will be evaluated in accordance with Section 1-08.8. No adjustment will be made for an
 invalid protest.
 If the Engineer determines that the protest is invalid, that determination and the reasons
 for it will be provided in writing to the Contractor. The determination will be provided within
 14 calendar days after receipt of the Contractor’s supplemental written statement (including
 any additional information requested by the Engineer to support a continuing protest)
 described in item 2 above.
 If the Contractor does not accept the Engineer’s determination then the Contractor shall
 pursue the dispute and claims procedures set forth in Section 1-09.11. In spite of any protest
 or dispute, the Contractor shall proceed promptly with the Work as the Engineer orders.
 By failing to follow the procedures of Sections 1-04.5 and 1-09.11, the Contractor
 completely waives any claims for protested Work.

 Scope of the Work
 
 1-04
 
 1-04.6  Variation in Estimated Quantities
 Payment to the Contractor will be made only for the actual quantities of Work performed
 and accepted in conformance with the Contract. When the accepted quantity of Work
 performed under a unit item varies from the original Proposal quantity, payment will be at
 the unit Contract price for all Work unless the total accepted quantity of any Contract item,
 adjusted to exclude added or deleted amounts included in change orders accepted by both
 parties, increases or decreases by more than 25 percent from the original Proposal quantity.
 In that case, payment for Contract Work may be adjusted as described herein.
 The adjusted final quantity shall be determined by starting with the final accepted quantity
 measured after all Work under an item has been completed. From this amount, subtract any
 quantities included in additive change orders accepted by both parties. Then, to the resulting
 amount, add any quantities included in deductive change orders accepted by both parties.
 The final result of this calculation shall become the adjusted final quantity and the basis for
 comparison to the original Proposal quantity.
 1.	 Increased Quantities – Either party to the Contract will be entitled to renegotiate the
 price for that portion of the adjusted final quantity in excess of 1.25 times the original
 Proposal quantity. The price for excessive increased quantities will be determined by
 agreement of the parties, or, where the parties cannot agree, the price will be determined
 by the Engineer based upon the actual costs to perform the Work, including reasonable
 markup for overhead and profit.
 2.	 Decreased Quantities – Either party to the Contract will be entitled to an equitable
 adjustment if the adjusted final quantity of Work performed is less than 75 percent of
 the original Bid quantity. The equitable adjustment shall be based upon and limited to
 three factors:
 a.	 Any increase or decrease in unit costs of labor, materials or equipment, utilized for
 Work actually performed, resulting solely from the reduction in quantity;
 b.	 Changes in production rates or methods of performing Work actually done to the
 extent that the nature of the Work actually performed differs from the nature of the
 Work included in the original plan; and
 c.	 An adjustment for the anticipated contribution to unavoidable fixed cost and
 overhead from the units representing the difference between the adjusted final
 quantity and 75 percent of the original Plan quantity.
 The following limitations shall apply to renegotiated prices for increases and/or equitable
 adjustments for decreases:
 1.	 The equipment rates shall be actual cost but shall not exceed the rates set forth in the
 AGC/WSDOT Equipment Rental Agreement (referred to in Section 1-09.6) that is in
 effect at the time the Work is performed.
 2.	 No payment will be made for extended or unabsorbed home office overhead and field
 overhead expenses to the extent that there is an unbalanced allocation of such expenses
 among the Contract Bid items.
 3.	 No payment for consequential damages or loss of anticipated profits will be allowed
 because of any variance in quantities from those originally shown in the Proposal form,
 Contract Provisions, and Contract Plans.
 4.	 The total payment (including the adjustment amount and unit prices for Work
 performed) for any item that experiences an equitable adjustment for decreased quantity
 shall not exceed 75 percent of the amount originally Bid for the item.
 If the adjusted final quantity of any item does not vary from the quantity shown in the
 Proposal by more than 25 percent, then the Contractor and the Contracting Agency agree that
 all Work under that item will be performed at the original Contract unit price.
 When ordered by the Engineer, the Contractor shall proceed with the Work pending
 determination of the cost or time adjustment for the variation in quantities.
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 1-25
 
 1-04
 
 Scope of the Work
 
 The Contractor and the Contracting Agency agree that there will be no cost adjustment for
 decreases if the Contracting Agency has entered the amount for the item in the Proposal form
 only to provide a common Proposal for Bidders.
 1-04.7  Differing Site Conditions (Changed Conditions)
 During the progress of the Work, if preexisting subsurface or latent physical conditions
 are encountered at the site, differing materially from those indicated in the Contract, or if
 preexisting unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature, differing materially from those
 ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the Work provided for in the
 Contract, are encountered at the site, the party discovering such conditions shall promptly
 notify the other party in writing of the specific differing site conditions before they are
 disturbed and before the affected Work is performed.
 Upon written notification, the Engineer will investigate the conditions and if he/she
 determines that the conditions materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the
 cost or time required for the performance of any Work under the Contract, an adjustment,
 excluding loss of anticipated profits, will be made and the Contract modified in writing
 accordingly. The Engineer will notify the Contractor of his/her determination whether or
 not an adjustment of the Contract is warranted.
 No Contract adjustment which results in a benefit to the Contractor will be allowed unless
 the Contractor has provided the required written notice.
 The equitable adjustment will be by agreement with the Contractor. However, if the parties
 are unable to agree, the Engineer will determine the amount of the equitable adjustment in
 accordance with Section 1-09.4. Extensions of time will be evaluated in accordance with
 Section 1-08.8.
 If the Engineer determines that different site conditions do not exist and no adjustment
 in costs or time is warranted, such determination shall be final as provided in Section 1-05.1.
 If there is a decrease in the costs or time required to perform the Work, failure of
 the Contractor to notify the Engineer of the differing site conditions shall not affect the
 Contracting Agency’s right to make an adjustment in the costs or time.
 No claim by the Contractor shall be allowed unless the Contractor has followed the
 procedures provided in Sections 1-04.5 and 1-09.11.
 1-04.8  Progress Estimates and Payments
 Engineer-issued progress estimates or payments for any part of the Work shall not be used
 as evidence of performance or quantities. Progress estimates serve only as basis for partial
 payments. The Engineer may revise progress estimates any time before final acceptance.
 If the Engineer deems it proper to do so, changes may be made in progress estimates and in
 the final estimate.
 1-04.9  Use of Buildings or Structures
 The Engineer will decide whether any building or Structure on the Right of Way may
 remain during the Work and whether the Contractor may use such a building or Structure.
 1-04.10  Use of Materials Found on the Project
 With the Engineer’s written approval, the Contractor may use on the project: stone, gravel,
 sand, other materials from on-site excavation, or timbers removed in the course of the Work.
 Approval will not be granted if:
 1.	 The excavated materials or timber fail to meet Contract requirements;
 2.	 The excavated materials or timber are required for other use under the Contract;
 3.	 The excavated materials are required for use as Selected Materials under Section
 2-03.3(10); or
 4.	 Such use is not in the best interests of the Contracting Agency as determined by the
 Engineer, whose decision shall be final as provided in Section 1-05.1.
 Page 1-26
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Scope of the Work

 Any material disturbed by, but not used in, the Work shall be disposed of as provided
 elsewhere in the Contract or as ordered by the Engineer in accordance with Section 1-04.4.
 1-04.11  Final Cleanup
 The Contractor shall perform final cleanup as provided in this section to the Engineer’s
 satisfaction. The Engineer will not establish the Physical Completion Date until this is done.
 The Highway Right of Way, material sites, and all ground the Contractor occupied to do the
 Work shall be left neat and presentable. The Contractor shall:
 1.	 Remove all rubbish, surplus materials, discarded materials, falsework, camp buildings,
 temporary structures, equipment, and debris; and
 2.	 Deposit in embankments, or remove from the project, all unneeded, oversized rock
 left from grading, surfacing, or paving.
 The Contractor shall not remove warning, regulatory, or guide signs unless the
 Engineer approves.

 Control of Work
 
 1-05  Control of Work
 1-05.1  Authority of the Engineer
 The Engineer shall be satisfied that all the Work is being done in accordance with the
 requirements of the Contract. The Contract and Specifications give the Engineer authority
 over the Work. Whenever it is so provided in this Contract, the decision of the Engineer
 shall be final: provided, however, that if an action is brought within the time allowed in
 this Contract challenging the Engineer’s decision, that decision shall be subject to the
 scope of judicial review provided in such cases under Washington case law.
 The Engineer’s decisions will be final on all questions including the following:
 1.	 Quality and acceptability of materials and Work,
 2.	 Measurement of unit price Work,
 3.	 Acceptability of rates of progress on the Work,
 4.	 Interpretation of Plans and Specifications,
 5.	 Determination as to the existence of changed or differing site conditions,
 6.	 Fulfillment of the Contract by the Contractor,
 7.	 Payments under the Contract including equitable adjustment,
 8.	 Suspension(s) of Work,
 9.	 Termination of the Contract for default or public convenience,
 10.	Determination as to unworkable days, and
 11.	Approval of Working Drawings.
 The Engineer represents the Contracting Agency with full authority to enforce Contract
 requirements. If the Contractor fails to respond promptly to the requirements of the Contract
 or orders from the Engineer:
 1.	 The Engineer may use Contracting Agency resources, other contractors, or other means
 to accomplish the Work; and
 2.	 The Contracting Agency will not be obligated to pay the Contractor, and will deduct
 from the Contractor’s payments any costs that result when any other means are used
 to carry out the Contract requirements or Engineer’s orders.
 At the Contractor’s risk, the Engineer may suspend all or part of the Work according to
 Section 1-08.6.
 Nothing in these Specifications or in the Contract requires the Engineer to provide the
 Contractor with direction or advice on how to do the Work. If the Engineer approves or
 recommends any method or manner for doing the Work or producing materials, the approval
 or recommendation shall not:
 1.	 Guarantee that following the method or manner will result in compliance with
 the Contract,
 2.	 Relieve the Contractor of any risks or obligations under the Contract, or
 3.	 Create any Contracting Agency liability.
 1-05.2  Authority of Assistants and Inspectors
 The Engineer may appoint assistants and Inspectors to assist in determining that the Work
 and materials meet the Contract requirements. Assistants and Inspectors have the authority to
 reject defective material and suspend Work that is being done improperly, subject to the final
 decisions of the Engineer.
 Assistants and Inspectors are not authorized to accept Work, to accept materials, to issue
 instructions, or to give advice that is contrary to the Contract. Work done or material furnished
 which does not meet the Contract requirements shall be at the Contractor’s risk and shall not
 be a basis for a claim even if the Inspectors or assistants purport to change the Contract.
 
 Page 1-28
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Control of Work
 
 1-05
 
 Assistants and Inspectors may advise the Contractor of any faulty Work or materials
 or infringements of the terms of the Contract; however, failure of the Engineer or the assistants
 or Inspectors to advise the Contractor does not constitute acceptance or approval.
 1-05.3  Working Drawings
 The Contract may require the Contractor to submit Working Drawings for the performance
 of the work. Working Drawings shall be submitted by the Contractor electronically to the
 Engineer in PDF format; drawing details shall be prepared in accordance with conventional
 detailing practices. If the PDF format is found to be unacceptable, at the request of the
 Engineer, the Contractor shall provide paper copies of the Working Drawings with drawings
 on 11 by 17 inch sheets and calculations/text on 8½ by 11 inch sheets.
 Working Drawings will be classified under the following categories:
 1.	 Type 1 – Submitted for Contracting Agency information. Submittal must be received
 by the Contracting Agency a minimum of 7 calendar days before Work represented
 by the submittal begins.
 2.	 Type 2 – Submitted for Contracting Agency review and comment. Unless otherwise
 stated in the Contract, the Engineer will require up to 20 calendar days from the date
 the Working Drawing is received until it is returned to the Contractor. The Contractor
 shall not proceed with the Work represented by the Working Drawing until comments
 from the Engineer have been addressed.
 3.	 Type 2E – Same as a Type 2 Working Drawing with Engineering as described below.
 4.	 Type 3 – Submitted for Contracting Agency review and approval. Unless otherwise
 stated in the Contract, the Engineer will require up to 30 calendar days from the date
 the Working Drawing is received until it is returned to the Contractor. The Contractor
 shall obtain the Engineer’s written approval before proceeding with the Work
 represented by the Working Drawing.
 5.	 Type 3E – Same as a Type 3 Working Drawing with Engineering as described below.
 All Working Drawings shall be considered Type 3 Working Drawings except as specifically
 noted otherwise in the Contract. Unless designated otherwise by the Contractor, submittals
 of Working Drawings will be reviewed in the order they are received by the Engineer. In the
 event that several Working Drawings are received simultaneously, the Contractor shall specify
 the sequence in which they are to be reviewed. If the Contractor does not submit a review
 sequence for simultaneous Working Drawing submittals, the review sequence will be at the
 Engineer’s discretion.
 Working Drawings requiring Engineering, Type 2E and 3E, shall be prepared by (or under
 the direction of) a Professional Engineer, licensed under Title 18 RCW, State of Washington,
 and in accordance with WAC 196-23-020. Design calculations shall carry the Professional
 Engineer’s signature and seal, date of signature, and registration number on the cover page.
 The cover page shall also include the Contract number, Contract title and sequential index
 to calculation page numbers.
 If more than the specified number of calendar days is required for the Engineer’s review
 of any individual Working Drawing or resubmittal, an extension of time will be considered
 in accordance with Section 1-08.8.
 Review or approval of Working Drawings shall neither confer upon the Contracting
 Agency nor relieve the Contractor of any responsibility for the accuracy of the drawings
 or their conformity with the Contract. The Contractor shall bear all risk and all costs of any
 Work delays caused by rejection or nonapproval of Working Drawings.
 Unit Bid prices shall cover all costs of Working Drawings.
 1-05.4  Conformity With and Deviations From Plans and Stakes
 The Special Provisions may require that the Contractor be contractually responsible for
 part or all of the project surveying. For survey requirements not the responsibility of the
 Contractor, the Engineer will lay out and set construction stakes and marks needed to establish
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 1-29
 
 1-05
 
 Control of Work
 
 the lines, grades, slopes, cross-sections, and curve superelevations. These stakes and marks
 will govern the Contractor’s Work. The Contractor shall take full responsibility for detailed
 dimensions, elevations, and slopes measured from them.
 All Work performed shall be in conformity with the lines, grades, slopes, cross-sections,
 superelevation data, and dimensions as shown in the Plans, or as staked. If the Plans, Special
 Provisions, or these Specifications, state specific tolerances, then the Work shall be performed
 within those limits. The Engineer’s decision on whether the Work is in conformity shall be
 final, as provided in Section 1-05.1.
 The Contractor shall not deviate from the approved Plans and Working Drawings unless
 the Engineer approves in writing.
 When the Contracting Agency is responsible for roadway surveying, and the Contractor
 trims the Subgrade with an automatic machine guided by reference lines, the Engineer will
 set control stakes for line and grade only once after grading is complete. To gain better control
 with unusual pavement widths or for other reasons, the Engineer may set more control stakes
 without added cost to the Contractor. The Contractor shall set reference lines from these
 control stakes for trimming Subgrade, for surfacing, and for controlling the paving machines.
 The Contractor shall work to preserve stakes, marks, and monuments set by the Engineer.
 The Contracting Agency will deduct from payments due the Contractor all costs to replace
 such stakes, marks, and monuments carelessly or willfully damaged or destroyed by the
 Contractor’s operation.
 The Contractor shall provide enough safe areas to permit the Engineer to set those points
 and elevations that are the responsibility of the Contracting Agency and to perform random
 checks of the surveying performed by the Contractor.
 The Contractor shall keep the Engineer informed of staking requirements to provide the
 Engineer with adequate time to set the stakes for which the Contracting Agency is responsible.
 Contractor requests for stakes shall be made at least 3 working days before the Engineer needs
 to begin the staking operation.
 1-05.5 Vacant
 1-05.6  Inspection of Work and Materials
 The Engineer may inspect all Work and materials for conformity with Contract terms.
 To ensure the Engineer’s safety and access during these inspections, the Contractor shall
 provide any equipment needed, such as walkways, railings, ladders, and platforms.
 When the Engineer requests, the Contractor shall (without charge) provide samples of
 materials used or to be used in the Work. If the Contractor uses materials tested and approved
 for one project in an unrelated project, the Contracting Agency may deduct its testing and
 inspection costs from payments due the Contractor. The Engineer may order the Contractor
 to remove and replace, and bear the cost of doing so, any materials used without inspection.
 Any inspections, tests, measurements, or other actions by Contracting Agency employees
 serve only one purpose: to assure the Engineer that Work, materials, progress rate, and
 quantities comply with Contract terms. Such work by Contracting Agency employees shall not
 relieve the Contractor from doing any Contract-assigned Work or from determining whether
 Contract requirements are being met. The Contractor shall correct any substandard Work or
 materials. The Engineer will reject unsuitable Work or materials even though inspected or
 paid for in a progress estimate.
 If the Engineer requests, then the Contractor shall remove or uncover any area of the
 completed Work. After the Engineer inspects it, the Contractor shall restore the area to the
 standard the Contract requires. The Contractor shall bear the cost of uncovering, removing,
 and restoring the exposed Work: (a) if it proves unacceptable, or (b) if it was placed without
 authority or without due notice to the Engineer. The Contracting Agency will pay these costs
 by agreed price or by force account if the Work proves to be acceptable and the Contractor
 had performed the original Work with the authority of and due notice to the Engineer.
 Page 1-30
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Control of Work
 
 1-05
 
 The Contractor, if advised to do so by the Engineer, shall permit representatives from
 other agencies to inspect the Work when it is to be done:
 1.	 On any railroad, utility, or facility of a public agency; or
 2.	 To the satisfaction of any federal, state, or municipal agency.
 In any crushing or screening operation, the Contractor shall provide and install a
 mechanical sampler that:
 1.	 Is automatic or semi-automatic;
 2.	 Can safely and easily obtain representative samples of the materials being produced;
 3.	 Can convey the samples to ground level in Contracting Agency-provided sacks;
 4.	 Moves at an even rate through the full width of the materials stream falling from the
 discharge end of the belt, gate, or chute;
 5.	 Is power driven during the material intercept cycle; and
 6.	 Can be adjusted to take samples of about 100 pounds as often as the Engineer requires.
 No material from the crushing or screen operation will be accepted until after the Engineer
 has approved the design and operation of the sampling equipment. The Contractor shall bear
 all costs of providing the sampling equipment, the power to operate it, and the space for
 its use.
 1-05.7  Removal of Defective and Unauthorized Work
 The Contracting Agency will not pay for unauthorized or defective Work. Unauthorized or
 defective Work includes: Work and materials that do not conform to Contract requirements;
 Work done beyond the lines and grades set by the Plans or the Engineer; and extra Work
 and materials furnished without the Engineer’s written approval. At the Engineer’s order,
 the Contractor shall immediately remedy, remove, replace, or dispose of unauthorized or
 defective Work or materials and bear all costs of doing so.
 1-05.8 Vacant
 1-05.9 Equipment
 At the Engineer’s request, the Contractor shall provide an operating and maintenance
 manual for each model or type of mixing, placing, or processing equipment before using
 it in the Work. The Contractor shall also provide test instruments to confirm whether the
 equipment meets operating requirements, such as vibration rate, revolutions-per-minute,
 or any other requirements.
 The Contract may require automatically controlled equipment for some operations. If the
 automatic controls on such equipment fail, then the Contractor may operate the equipment
 manually for the remainder of that normal working day, provided the method of operation
 produces results otherwise meeting the Specifications. Continued operation of the equipment
 manually beyond this working day will be permitted only by specific authorization of
 the Engineer.
 The Engineer will reject equipment that repeatedly breaks down or fails to produce results
 within the required tolerances. The Contractor shall have no claim for additional payment or
 for extension of time due to rejection and replacement of any equipment.
 1-05.10  Guarantees
 The Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Agency any guarantee or warranty
 furnished as a customary trade practice in connection with the purchase of any equipment,
 materials, or items incorporated into the project.
 1-05.11  Final Inspection
 The Engineer will not make the final inspection until the physical Work required by
 the Contract, including final cleanup and all extra Work ordered by the Engineer, has been
 completed. The Physical Completion Date for the Contract will be determined as provided
 in Section 1-08.5.
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 1-05
 
 Control of Work
 
 1-05.12  Final Acceptance
 The Contractor must perform all the obligations under the Contract before a Completion
 Date and final acceptance can occur. Failure of the Contractor to perform all the obligations
 under the Contract shall not bar the Contracting Agency from unilaterally accepting the
 Contract as provided in Section 1-09.9. The Secretary accepts the completed Contract and
 the items of Work shown in the final estimate by signature of the Final Contract Voucher
 Certification. The date of that signature constitutes the acceptance date. Progress estimates
 or payments shall not be construed as acceptance of any Work under the Contract.
 The Contractor agrees that neither completion nor final acceptance shall relieve the
 Contractor of the responsibility to indemnify, defend, and protect the Contracting Agency
 against any claim or loss resulting from the failure of the Contractor (or the Subcontractors
 or lower tier subcontractors) to pay all laborers, mechanics, Subcontractors, materialpersons,
 or any other person who provides labor, supplies, or provisions for carrying out the Work
 or for any payments required for unemployment compensation under Title 50 RCW or for
 industrial insurance and medical aid required under Title 51 RCW.
 Final acceptance shall not constitute acceptance of any unauthorized or defective work
 or material. The Contracting Agency shall not be barred from requiring the Contractor to
 remove, replace, repair, or dispose of any unauthorized or defective work or material or
 from recovering damages for any such work or material.
 1-05.13  Superintendents, Labor, and Equipment of Contractor
 At all times, the Contractor shall keep at the Work site a set of the Plans, Specifications,
 Special Provisions, and Addenda. The Contractor shall devote the attention required to make
 reasonable progress on the Work and shall cooperate fully with the Engineer and Inspectors.
 Either the Contractor in person or an authorized representative shall remain on site
 whenever the Work is underway. Before the Work begins, the Contractor shall name in writing
 an experienced superintendent who understands the Contract and is able to supervise the
 Work. This superintendent shall have full authority to represent and act for the Contractor. Any
 superintendent who repeatedly fails to follow the Engineer’s written or oral orders, directions,
 instructions, or determinations, shall be subject to removal from the project. Upon the written
 request of the Engineer, the Contractor shall immediately remove such superintendent and
 name a replacement in writing.
 Competent supervisors experienced in the task being performed shall continuously oversee
 the Contract Work. At the Engineer’s written request, the Contractor shall immediately remove
 and replace any incompetent, careless, or negligent employee.
 Noncompliance with the Engineer’s request to remove and replace personnel at any level
 shall be grounds for terminating the Contract under the terms of Section 1-08.10.
 The Contractor shall keep all machinery and equipment in good, workable condition.
 It shall be adequate for its purpose and used by competent operators.
 The Engineer will rate the Contractor’s performance and Contract compliance in
 these categories:
 1.	 Progress of Work,
 2.	 Quality of Work,
 3.	 Equipment,
 4.	 Administration/Management/Supervision, and
 5.	 Coordination and Control of Subcontractors.
 Whenever the Contracting Agency evaluates the Contractor’s prequalification under
 RCW 47.28.070, it will take these reports into account.

 1-06.1  Approval of Materials Prior to Use
 Prior to use, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer of all proposed materials.
 The Contractor shall use the Qualified Product List (QPL), the Aggregate Source Approval
 (ASA) Database, or the Request for Approval of Material (RAM) form.
 All equipment, materials, and articles incorporated into the permanent Work:
 1.	 Shall be new, unless the Special Provisions or Standard Specifications permit otherwise;
 2.	 Shall meet the requirements of the Contract and be approved by the Engineer;
 3.	 May be inspected or tested at any time during their preparation and use; and
 4.	 Shall not be used in the Work if they become unfit after being previously approved.
 1-06.1(1)  Qualified Products List (QPL)
 The QPL is a listing of manufactured products that have been evaluated and determined
 suitable for use in Highway construction.
 If the Contractor elects to use the QPL, the most current list available at the time the
 product is proposed for use, shall be used. The QPL submittal shall be prepared by the
 Contractor in accordance with the instructions in the QPL and submitted to the Engineer
 prior to use.
 The QPL identifies the approved products, the applicable Specification Section, and the
 basis for acceptance at the project level. The listing is divided into two categories, “Approved”
 and “Conditionally Approved”. “Approved” products are denoted with an “A”. Those products
 may be accepted without additional sampling. “Conditionally Approved” products are denoted
 with a “CA”. The acceptance and use of these products is based upon additional job sampling
 and/or documentation. All additional acceptance actions need to be completed prior to the
 material being incorporated into the Work.
 The Contractor shall advise the Engineer of the intended items for use from the QPL by
 reference to the Contract Bid item.
 The use of listed products shall be restricted to the Standard Specification for which they
 are listed and fulfillment of the acceptance requirement defined in the QPL. Qualified products
 not conforming to the Specifications, not fulfilling the acceptance requirements, or improperly
 handled or installed, shall be replaced at the Contractor’s expense.
 To qualify for continued listing on the QPL, products may be sampled and tested for
 conformance to the Standard Specifications. The Contracting Agency reserves the right to
 make revisions to the QPL at any time.
 If there is a conflict between the QPL and the Contract, the provisions of the Contract
 shall take precedence over the QPL.
 The current QPL can be accessed online at www.wsdot.wa.gov/business/materialslab/QPL.htm.
 1-06.1(2)  Request for Approval of Material (RAM)
 The RAM shall be used when the Contractor elects not to use the QPL or the material
 is not listed in the QPL. The RAM shall be prepared by the Contractor in accordance with the
 instructions on Form 350-071 and submitted to the Engineer for approval before the material
 is incorporated into the Work.
 Approval of the material does not constitute acceptance of the material for incorporation
 into the Work.
 Additional acceptance actions as noted on the RAM need to be completed prior to the
 materials being incorporated into the Work.
 When requesting approval of an item that requires fabrication, both the fabricator and
 the manufacturer of the base material shall be identified on the RAM.

 1-06.1(3)  Aggregate Source Approval (ASA) Database
 The ASA is a database containing the results of WSDOT preliminary testing of aggregate
 sources. This database is used by the Contracting Agency to indicate the approval status
 of these aggregate sources for applications that require preliminary testing as defined in
 the Contract. The ASA ‘Aggregate Source Approval Report’ identifies the currently approved
 applications for each aggregate source listed. The acceptance and use of these aggregates
 is contingent upon additional job sampling and/or documentation. The ASA database can
 be accessed online at the agency website.
 Aggregates approved for applications on the ASA ‘Aggregate Source Approval Report’ not
 conforming to the Specifications, not fulfilling the acceptance requirements, or improperly
 handled or installed, shall be replaced at the Contractor’s expense.
 Aggregate materials that are not approved for use in the ASA data base may be sampled
 and tested by the Agency, for a specified use on a project, from the source or from a processed
 stockpile of the material and all cost for the sampling and testing will be deducted from
 the Contract.
 The Contractor agrees to authorize the Engineer to deduct the sampling and testing costs
 from any money due or coming due to the Contractor.
 1-06.1(4)  Fabrication Inspection Expense
 In the event the Contractor elects to have items fabricated beyond 300 miles from Seattle,
 Washington, the Contracting Agency will deduct from monies due or that may become due to
 the Contractor all costs to perform plant approval and fabrication acceptance inspection for
 the items listed in Table 1 and costs for initial plant approval for items listed in Table 2. Plants
 currently listed on the QPL for the items shown in Table 1 and Table 2 in this section do not
 require plant approval.

 The Contractor shall deliver representative samples (from the Contractor, Producer,
 or Fabricator) to the Engineer without charge before incorporating material into the Work.
 In providing samples, the Contractor shall provide the Engineer with sufficient time and
 quantities for testing before use. The Engineer may require samples at any time. Samples
 not taken by or in the presence of the Engineer will not be accepted for test, unless the
 Engineer permits otherwise.
 The Contractor shall designate specific Contractor employees as points of contact for
 concrete testing and acceptance. Alternates shall be designated to ensure that direct contact
 is maintained during concrete placement. If designated by the Contractor to the Engineer,
 the concrete supplier will receive all 28-day concrete strength test results.
 The Engineer will designate specific Contracting Agency employees as points of contact
 for concrete testing and acceptance.
 The Contractor may observe any of the sampling and testing performed by the
 Engineer. If the Contractor observes a deviation from the specified sampling and testing
 procedures, the Contractor shall verbally describe the deviations observed to the Engineer
 or designated representative immediately, and shall confirm these observed deviations in
 writing to the Engineer within 24 hours, referencing the specific procedures and steps. The
 Engineer will respond in writing within 3 working days of the receipt of the Contractor’s

 All field and Laboratory materials testing by the Engineer will follow methods described
 in Contract documents, or in the WSDOT Materials Manual M 46-01, using qualified testing
 personnel and calibrated or verified equipment. The standard or tentative standard in effect
 on the Bid advertising date will apply in each case.
 Revisions to the WSDOT Materials Manual M 46‑01 or revisions to other Specifications
 or test methods such as AASHTO, ASTM, or Federal Specifications will be considered as in
 effect 60 calendar days after publication.
 1-06.2(2)  Statistical Evaluation of Materials for Acceptance
 1-06.2(2)A General
 Where specified, acceptance sampling and testing will be performed by the Contracting
 Agency and statistically evaluated for acceptance by the provisions of this Subsection.
 All test results for a lot will be analyzed collectively and statistically by the quality level
 analysis procedures shown at the end of this Subsection to determine the total percent of
 the lot that is within Specification limits and to determine an appropriate pay factor. Lots
 and sublots are defined in the appropriate Subsection of these Specifications for the material
 being statistically evaluated.
 Quality level analysis is a statistical procedure for determining the percent compliance
 of the material with these Specifications. Quality level is the computed percent of material
 meeting these Specifications and is determined from the arithmetic mean, (Xm), and the
 sample standard deviation (S), for each constituent of the lot.
 Any necessary rounding off of test results or calculations will be accomplished according
 to the individual testing procedure, or, if not defined in the procedure then accomplished
 according to the following rule:
 1.	 The final significant digit will not be changed when the succeeding digit is less than 5.
 2.	 The final significant digit will be increased by one when the succeeding digit is 5
 or greater.

 Note: If the value of (PU + PL) - 100 does not correspond to a (PU + PL) - 100 value in this table, use the next smaller (PU + PL) - 100
 value.
 
 1-06.2(2)B  Financial Incentive
 As an incentive to produce superior quality material, a pay factor greater than 1.00 may
 be obtained with the maximum pay factor being 1.05. A lot containing non-Specification
 material will be accepted provided the Composite Pay Factor reaches the minimum value
 specified elsewhere. A lot containing non-Specification material which fails to obtain at least
 the specified minimum Composite Pay Factor will be rejected by the Engineer. The Engineer
 will take one or more of the following actions when rejected material has been incorporated
 into the Work:
 1.	 Require complete removal and replacement with Specification material at no additional
 cost to the Contracting Agency.
 2.	 At the Contractor’s written request, allow corrective work at no additional cost to the
 Contracting Agency and then an appropriate price reduction that may range from no
 reduction to no payment.
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 1-06
 
 Control of Material
 
 3.	 At the Contractor’s written request, allow material to remain in place with an
 appropriate price reduction that may range from a designated percentage reduction
 to no payment.
 Any lot for which at least three samples have been obtained, and all of the test results meet
 one of the appropriate criteria listed below, will receive at least a 1.00 Composite Pay Factor:
 1.	 All test results are within the allowable limits specified for the item, or
 2.	 All test results that only have a lower Specification limit are greater than or equal
 to that limit, or
 3.	 All test results that only have an upper Specification limit are less than or equal
 to that limit.
 Computation of the quality level in these instances will be for determining the amount
 of any bonus that might be warranted.
 Lots represented by less than three samples or unsampled lots will be exempt from
 statistical based acceptance.
 1-06.2(2)C  Removed and Rejected Materials
 The Contractor may, prior to sampling, elect to remove any defective material and replace
 it with new material at no expense to the Contracting Agency. Any such new material will be
 sampled, tested, and evaluated for acceptance as a part of the sublot in accordance with this
 statistical sampling and testing procedure.
 The Engineer may reject a sublot that tests show to be defective. Such rejected material
 shall not be used in the Work, and the results of tests run on the rejected material will not be
 included in the original lot acceptance tests.
 1-06.2(2)D  Quality Level Analysis
 1-06.2(2)D1 General
 The quality level calculations for HMA and other materials are completed using the
 formulas in Section 1-06.2(2)D4. For HMA, the definition of the “x” value used in the
 calculations and the definition of the upper and lower specification limit are in Section
 1-06.2(2)D2. For other materials, the definition of the “x” value used in the calculations
 and the definition of the upper and lower specification limit are in Section 1-06.2(2)D3.
 All other terms and variables are the same for all calculations.

 1-06.3  Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance
 When authorized by these Specifications or the Special Provisions and prior to use,
 the Engineer may accept certain materials on the basis of a Manufacturer’s Certificate of
 Compliance as an alternative to material inspection and testing.
 The Contractor may request, in writing, authority from the Engineer to install such
 materials prior to submitting the required certification; however, no payment will be made
 for the Work in the absence of an acceptable Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance. The
 Contracting Agency reserves the right to deny the request for good cause. If for any reason
 the Contractor has not provided an acceptable Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance by
 the Physical Completion Date established by Section 1-08.5, the Contracting Agency will
 assess the usefulness of the installed material. At the Engineer’s discretion, the Contracting
 Agency will either require replacement of the material by the Contractor at no expense to
 the Contracting Agency or process the final payment as provided by Section 1-09.9 without

 Control of Material
 
 paying for the materials or any portion of the Work performed to install the materials provided
 on such a basis. The unit Contract prices for the Work shall be used to determine the amount
 to be withheld. Where unit Contract prices do not exist, as in a lump sum item, the amount
 to be withheld shall be an equitable adjustment, covering labor, equipment and materials,
 determined in accordance with Section 1-09.4.
 The Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance must identify the manufacturer, the type
 and quantity of material being certified, the applicable Specifications being affirmed, and
 the signature of a responsible corporate official of the manufacturer and include supporting
 mill tests or documents. A Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance shall be furnished with
 each lot of material delivered to the Work and the lot so certified shall be clearly identified in
 the certificate.
 All materials used on the basis of a Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance may be
 sampled and tested at any time. Any material not conforming to the requirements will be
 subject to rejection whether in place or not. The Contracting Agency reserves the right to
 refuse to accept materials on the basis of a Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance.
 1-06.4  Handling and Storing Materials
 In storage and handling, the Contractor shall protect materials against damage from
 careless handling, from exposure to weather, from mixture with foreign matter, and from
 all other causes. The Engineer will reject and refuse to test materials improperly handled
 or stored.
 The Contractor shall repair, replace, or make good all Contracting Agency-provided
 materials that are damaged or lost due to the Contractor’s operation or while in the
 Contractor’s possession, at no expense to the Contracting Agency.
 1-06.5  Owners Manuals and Operating Instructions
 For equipment and materials that are permanently incorporated in the Work, the Contractor
 shall provide to the Engineer all owners manuals and operating instructions furnished by the
 equipment or material manufacturer.
 1-06.6  Recycled Materials
 The Contractor shall make their best effort to utilize recycled materials in the construction
 of the project; the use of recycled concrete aggregate as specified in Section 1-06.6(1)A is a
 requirement of the Contract.
 The Contractor shall submit a Recycled Material Utilization Plan as a Type 1 Working
 Drawing within 30 calendar days after the Contract is executed. The plan shall provide the
 Contractor’s anticipated usage of recycled materials for meeting the requirements of these
 Specifications. The quantity of recycled materials will be provided in tons and as a percentage
 of the Plan quantity for each material listed in Section 9-03.21(1)E Table on Maximum
 Allowable percent (By Weight) of Recycled Material. When a Contract does not include Work
 that requires the use of a material that is included in the requirements for using materials the
 Contractor may state in their plan that no recycled materials are proposed for use.
 Prior to Physical Completion the Contractor shall report the quantity of recycled materials
 that were utilized in the construction of the project for each of the items listed in Section
 9-03.21. The report shall include hot mix asphalt, recycled concrete aggregate, recycled
 glass, steel furnace slag and other recycled materials (e.g. utilization of on-site material and
 aggregates from concrete returned to the supplier). The Contractor’s report shall be provided
 on WSDOT Form 350-075, Recycled Materials Reporting.

 1-06.6(1)  Recycling of Aggregate and Concrete Materials
 1-06.6(1)A General
 The minimum quantity of recycled concrete aggregate shall be 25 percent of the total
 quantity of aggregate that is incorporated into the Contract for those items listed in Section
 9-03.21(1)E Table on Maximum Allowable percent (By Weight) of Recycled Material that
 allow the use of recycled concrete aggregate. The percentage of recycled material incorporated
 into the project for meeting the required percentage will be calculated in tons based on the
 quantity of recycled concrete used on the entire Contract and not as individual items.
 If the Contractor’s total cost for Work with recycled concrete aggregate is greater than
 without the Contractor may choose to not use recycled concrete aggregate. If the Recycled
 Material Utilization Plan does not indicate the minimum usage of recycled concrete aggregate
 required above, or if completed project quantities do not meet the minimum usage required,
 the Contractor shall develop the following:
 1.	 A cost estimate for each material listed in Section 9-03.21(1)E that is utilized on the
 Contract. The cost estimate shall include the following:
 a.	 The estimated costs for the Work for each material with 25 percent recycled concrete
 aggregate. The cost estimate shall include for each material a copy of the price quote
 from the supplier with the lowest total cost for the Work.
 b.	 The estimated costs for the Work for each material without recycled
 concrete aggregate.
 The Contractor’s cost estimates shall be submitted as an attachment to the Recycled
 Material Utilization Plan, or with the Reporting form.

 Legal Relations and Responsibilities to the Public
 
 1-07  Legal Relations and Responsibilities to the Public
 1-07.1  Laws to be Observed
 The Contractor shall always comply with all Federal, State, tribal, or local laws,
 ordinances, and regulations that affect Work under the Contract. The Contractor shall
 indemnify, defend, and save harmless the State (including the Governor, Commission,
 Secretary, and any agents, officers, and employees) against any claims that may arise because
 the Contractor (or any employee of the Contractor or Subcontractor or materialperson)
 violated a legal requirement.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for the safety of all workers and shall comply with
 all appropriate state safety and health standards, codes, rules, and regulations, including,
 but not limited to, those promulgated under the Washington Industry Safety and Health
 Act RCW 49.17 (WISHA) and as set forth in Title 296 WAC (Department of Labor
 and Industries). In particular the Contractor’s attention is drawn to the requirements of
 WAC 296.800 which requires employers to provide a safe workplace. More specifically
 WAC 296.800.11025 prohibits alcohol and narcotics from the workplace. The Contractor shall
 likewise be obligated to comply with all federal safety and health standards, codes, rules, and
 regulations that may be applicable to the Contract Work. A copy of all safety plans (e.g., fall
 protection work plan) that are developed by the Contractor shall be submitted to the Engineer
 as a Type 1 Working Drawing. When requested by the Engineer, the Contractor shall provide
 training to Contracting Agency employees working on-site for any activity covered by a safety
 plan. Costs for training that is provided solely to Contracting Agency employees will be paid
 to the Contractor in accordance with Section 1-09.4.
 U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration rules apply when the project includes pit or
 quarry operations. Among other actions, these regulations require the Contractor to notify the
 nearest Mine Safety and Health sub district office (1) of the project before it begins, (2) of the
 starting date, and (3) of the Physical Completion Date.
 Without usurping the authority of other agencies, the Contracting Agency will cooperate
 with them in their efforts to enforce legal requirements. Upon awareness of a violation of
 a legal requirement, the Engineer will notify the Contractor in an effort to achieve compliance.
 The Engineer may also notify the agency responsible for enforcement if the Engineer deems
 that action is necessary to achieve compliance with legal requirements. The Engineer will
 also assist the enforcement agency to obtain Contractor compliance to the extent such
 assistance is consistent with the provisions of the Contract.
 The Contracting Agency will not adjust payment to compensate the Contractor for
 changes in legal requirements unless those changes are specifically within the scope of
 RCW 39.04.120. For changes under RCW 39.04.120, the Contracting Agency will compensate
 the Contractor by negotiated change order as provided in Section 1-04.4.
 Under certain conditions, the Contracting Agency will adjust payment to compensate for
 tax changes. First, the changes shall involve federal or state taxes on materials or fuel used in
 or consumed for the project. Second, the changes shall increase or decrease Contractor-paid
 taxes by more than $500. For items in the original Contract, the tax change must occur after
 the Bid opening date. For negotiated Contracts or items in a supplemental agreement, the tax
 change must take place after the execution date of the Contract or agreement. Within these
 conditions, the Contracting Agency will adjust compensation by the actual dollar amounts
 of increase or decrease caused by the tax changes. If the Engineer requests it, the Contractor
 shall certify in writing that the Contract price does not include any extra amount to cover a
 possible change in taxes.
 The Contracting Agency may audit the records of the Contractor as provided in
 Section 1-09.12, to verify any claim for compensation because of changes in laws or taxes.

 1-07.2  State Taxes
 The Washington State Department of Revenue has issued special rules on the state sales
 tax. Sections 1-07.2(1) through 1-07.2(3) are meant to clarify those rules. The Contracting
 Agency will not adjust its payment if the Contractor bases a Bid on a misunderstood
 tax liability.
 The Contracting Agency may deduct from its payments to the Contractor, retainage or lien
 the bond, in the amount the Contractor owes the State Department of Revenue, whether the
 amount owed relates to the Contract in question or not. Any amount so deducted will be paid
 into the proper State fund on the contractor’s behalf. For additional information on tax rates
 and application refer to applicable RCWs, WACs or the Department of Revenue website.
 1-07.2(1)  State Sales Tax: WAC 458-20-171 – Use Tax
 For Work designated as Rule 171, Use Tax, the Contractor shall include for compensation
 the amount of any taxes paid in the various unit Bid prices or other Contract amounts.
 Typically, these taxes are collected on materials incorporated into the project and items
 such as the purchase or rental of; tools, machinery, equipment, or consumable supplies not
 integrated into the project.
 The Summary of Quantities in the Contract Plans identifies those parts of the project that
 are subject to Use Tax under Section 1-07.2(1).
 1-07.2(2)  State Sales Tax: WAC 458-20-170 – Retail Sales Tax
 For Work designated as Rule 170, Retail Sales Tax, the Contractor shall collect from the
 Contracting Agency, Retail Sales Tax on the full Contract price. The Contracting Agency will
 automatically add this Retail Sales Tax to each payment to the Contractor and for this reason;
 the Contractor shall not include the Retail Sales Tax in the unit Bid prices or in any other
 Contract amount. The Contractor (Prime or Subcontractor) shall include sales or use tax on the
 purchase or rental of tools, machinery, equipment, or consumable supplies not integrated into
 the project, in the unit bid prices.
 The Summary of Quantities in the Contract Plans identifies those parts of the project that
 are subject to Retail Sales Tax under Section 1-07.2(2).
 1-07.2(3)  Services
 Any contract wholly for professional or other applicable services is generally not subject
 to Retail Sales Tax and therefore, the Contractor shall not collect Retail Sales Tax from the
 Contracting Agency on those Contracts. Any incidental taxes paid as part of providing the
 services shall be included in the payments under the contract.
 1-07.3  Forest Protection and Merchantable Timber Requirements
 1-07.3(1)  Forest Fire Prevention

 1-07.5(4)  Air Quality
 The Contractor shall comply with all rules of local air pollution authorities. If there are
 none, air-quality rules of the State Department of Ecology shall govern the Work.
 The Washington Clean Air Act requires that rock crushing, rock drilling, asphalt batch
 plants, and concrete plants receive an air quality permit in advance of the operation. The
 air quality permit process may include additional State Environment Policy Act (SEPA)
 requirements. Contractors or operators should contact the appropriate air pollution control
 authority well in advance of intended start-up. The permit process may require up to 30 days.
 When the Work includes demolition of any existing facility, the Contractor shall comply
 with the requirements of the National Emission Standards for Asbestos. Any requirement
 included in state or Federal regulations on this subject that applies to the “owner or operator”
 shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.

 The Contracting Agency will support the Contractor in efforts to obtain a temporary
 operating permit in its name if:
 1.	 A local rule or an agency policy prevent issuing the permit to a private firm;
 2.	 The Contractor takes all action to obtain the permit;
 3.	 The permit will serve the public interest;
 4.	 The permit applies only to Work under the Contract;
 5.	 The Contractor agrees in writing: (a) to comply with all the issuing agency requires,
 and (b) to hold the Contracting Agency harmless for any Work-related liability incurred
 under the permit; and
 6.	 The permit costs the Contracting Agency nothing.
 1-07.7  Load Limits
 1-07.7(1)  General
 While moving equipment or materials on any public Highway, the Contractor shall comply
 with all laws that control traffic or limit loads. The Contract neither exempts the Contractor
 from such laws nor licenses overloads. At the Engineer’s request, the Contractor shall provide
 any facts needed to compute the equipment’s weight on the Roadway.
 When the Contractor moves equipment or materials within the project limits as shown in
 the Plans, legal load limits shall apply on:
 1.	 Any road open to and in use by public traffic; or
 2.	 Any existing road not scheduled for major reconstruction under the current Contract; or

 3.	 Any newly paved road (with final lift in place) built under this Contract. The Contractor
 may haul overloads (not more than 25 percent above load limits) on such roads not open
 to public traffic if this does not damage completed Work. The Contractor shall pay all
 repair costs of any overload damage.
 Elsewhere on the project, the Contractor may operate equipment with only the load-limit
 restrictions in 1, 2, and 3 in Section 1-07.7(2). The Contractor shall remain responsible,
 however, for all load-caused damage. All vehicles subject to license on a tonnage basis
 shall be licensed to maximum legal capacity before operating under these limits.
 If necessary and safe to do so, and if the Contractor submits a Type 2E Working Drawing,
 the Engineer may allow higher load limits than those in the load-limit restrictions in 1, 2, and
 3 in Section 1-07.7(2). The submittal shall:
 1.	 Describe loading details;
 2.	 Describe the arrangement, movement, and position of equipment on the Structure or
 over culverts and pipes; and
 3.	 State that the Contractor assumes all risk for damage.
 Unit prices shall cover all costs for operating over bridges and culverts. Nothing in this
 section affects the Contractor’s other responsibilities under these Specifications or under
 public Highway laws.
 1-07.7(2)  Load-Limit Restrictions
 1.	 Structures Designed for Direct Bearing of Live Loads – The gross or maximum
 load on each vehicle axle shall not exceed the legal load limit by more than 35 percent.
 No more than one vehicle shall operate over any Structure at one time. The Contractor
 shall immediately remove any dirt, rock, or debris that may gather on the Structure’s
 Roadway surface.
 	 If the Contractor desires to utilize work methods resulting in load that exceed any
 of the restrictions described above, the Contractor shall submit a Type 3E Working
 Drawing consisting of calculations and other supporting information (as specified in
 Section 6-01.6 for bridges under construction).
 2.	 Underpasses and Reinforced Concrete Box Culverts Under Embankments – Loads
 shall not exceed 24,000 pounds on a single axle and 16,000 pounds each on tandem
 axles spaced less than 10 feet apart. These limits are permitted only if the embankment
 has: (a) been built to Specifications, and (b) reached at least 3 feet above the top of the
 underpass or culvert.
 	 When the embankment has reached 5 feet above the top of the underpass or culvert,
 the Contractor may increase per-axle loads up to 100,000 pounds if outside wheel
 spacing is at least 7 feet on axle centers.
 3.	 Pipe Culverts and Sewer Pipes – Loads over pipe culverts and sewer pipes shall not
 exceed 24,000 pounds on a single axle and 16,000 pounds each on tandem axles spaced
 less than 10 feet apart. These limits are permitted only if: (a) the culvert or pipe has
 been installed and backfilled to Specifications, and (b) the embankment has reached at
 least 2 feet above the top limit of pipe compaction.
 	 When the embankment has reached 5 feet above the top limit of pipe compaction, the
 Contractor may increase per-axle loads up to 100,000 pounds if outside wheel spacing
 is at least 7 feet on axle centers, except that:
 a.	 For Class III reinforced concrete pipes, the embankment shall have risen above the
 top limit of compaction at least 6 feet.
 b.	 For Class II reinforced concrete pipes, the maximum load for each axle shall be

 All personnel, except those performing the Work described in Section 1-10, shall wear
 high-visibility apparel meeting the ANSI/ISEA 107 Class 2 or 3 standard.
 1-07.9  Wages
 1-07.9(1)  General
 This Contract is subject to the minimum wage requirements of RCW 39.12 and to
 RCW 49.28 (as amended or supplemented). On Federal-aid projects, Federal wage laws
 and rules also apply. The hourly minimum rates for wages and fringe benefits are listed in
 the Contract Provisions. When Federal wage and fringe benefit rates are listed, the rates
 match those identified by the U.S. Department of Labor’s “Decision Number” shown in
 the Contract Provisions.
 The Contractor, any Subcontractor, and all individuals or firms required by RCW 39.12,
 WAC 296-127, or the Federal Davis-Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA) to pay minimum
 prevailing wages, shall not pay any worker less than the minimum hourly wage rates and
 fringe benefits required by RCW 39.12 or the DBRA. Higher wages and benefits may be paid.
 By including the hourly minimum rates for wages and fringe benefits in the Contract
 Provisions, the Contracting Agency does not imply that the Contractor will find labor available
 at those rates. The Contractor shall be responsible for any amounts above the minimums that
 will actually have to be paid. The Contractor shall bear the cost of paying wages above those
 shown in the Contract Provisions.
 When the project is subject to both State and Federal hourly minimum rates for wages
 and fringe benefits and when the two rates differ for similar kinds of labor, the Contractor
 shall not pay less than the higher rate unless the State rates are specifically preempted by
 Federal law. When the project involves highway Work, heavy Work, and building Work, the
 Contract Provisions may list a Federal wage and fringe benefit rate for the highway Work,
 and a separate Federal wage and fringe benefit rate for both heavy Work and building Work.
 The area in which the worker is physically employed shall determine which Federal wage
 and fringe benefit rate shall be used to compare against the State wage and fringe benefit rate.

 If employing labor in a class not listed in the Contract Provisions on state funded projects
 only, the Contractor shall request a determination of the correct wage and benefits rate for that
 class and locality from the Industrial Statistician, Washington State Department of Labor and
 Industries (State L&I), and provide a copy of those determinations to the Engineer.
 If employing labor in a class not listed in the Contract Provisions on federally funded
 projects, the Contractor shall request a determination of the correct wage and benefit for
 that class and locality from the U.S. Secretary of Labor through the Engineer. Generally, the
 Contractor initiates the request by preparing standard form 1444 Request for Authorization
 of Additional Classification and Rate, available at www.wdol.gov/docs/sf1444.pdf, and
 submitting it to the Engineer for further action.
 The Contractor shall ensure that any firm (Supplier, Manufacturer, or Fabricator)
 that falls under the provisions of RCW 39.12 because of the definition “Contractor” in
 WAC 296‑127-010, complies with all the requirements of RCW 39.12.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for compliance with the requirements of the
 DBRA and RCW 39.12 by all firms (Subcontractors, lower tier subcontractors, Suppliers,
 Manufacturers, or Fabricators) engaged in any part of the Work necessary to complete this
 Contract. Therefore, should a violation of this Subsection occur by any firm that is providing
 Work or materials for completion of this Contract whether directly or indirectly responsible
 to the Contractor, the Contracting Agency will take action against the Contractor, as provided
 by the provisions of the Contract, to achieve compliance, including but not limited to,
 withholding payment on the Contract until compliance is achieved.
 In the event the Contracting Agency has an error (omissions are not errors) in the listing
 of the hourly minimum rates for wages and fringe benefits in the Contract Provisions, the
 Contractor, any Subcontractor, any lower tier subcontractor, or any other firm that is required
 to pay prevailing wages, shall be required to pay the rates as determined to be correct by State
 L&I (or by the U.S. Department of Labor when that agency sets the rates). A change order will
 be prepared to ensure that this occurs. The Contracting Agency will reimburse the Contractor
 for the actual cost to pay the difference between the correct rates and the rates included in the
 Contract Provisions, subject to the following conditions:
 1.	 The affected firm relied upon the rates included in the Contract Provisions to prepare its
 Bid and certifies that it did so;
 2.	 The allowable amount of reimbursement will be the difference between the rates
 listed and rates later determined to be correct plus only appropriate payroll markup
 the employer must pay, such as, social security and other payments the employer must
 make to the Federal or State Government;
 3.	 The allowable amount of reimbursement may also include some overhead cost, such as,
 the cost for bond, insurance, and making supplemental payrolls and new checks to the
 employees because of underpayment for previously performed Work; and
 4.	 Profit will not be an allowable markup.
 Firms that anticipated, when they prepared their Bids, paying a rate equal to, or higher
 than, the correct rate as finally determined will not be eligible for reimbursement.
 Listing Recovery Act (and other) new hire opportunities with the Employment
 Security Department.
 There are many talented people currently unemployed. As the signs on the Contracting
 Agency’s projects advertise, the Recovery Act is about creating jobs and putting people back
 to work. As a companion effort, the Employment Security Department has been charged
 with giving people the opportunity to compete for these jobs. Their tool for doing so is
 WorkSource. WorkSource is a free service located across the State that screens, shortlists,
 and refers qualified candidates.
 WorkSource employees are aware that the Contractor has other commitments as part of
 your business practices and as part of the Contract. Contractors may be subject to hiring
 commitments such as Equal Employment Opportunity or union commitments. However,
 utilizing WorkSource can be an essential effort as part of their various good faith efforts.

 subject to the defense, indemnity, and insurance provisions of these Standard Specifications.
 Claims will be deemed tendered to the Contractor and insurer, who has named the State as
 a named insured or an additional insured under the Contract’s insurance provisions, once
 the claim has been forwarded via certified mail to the Contractor. The Contractor shall be
 responsible to provide a copy of the claim to the Contractor’s designated insurance agent
 who has obtained/met the Contract’s insurance provision requirements.
 Within 60 calendar days following the date a claim is sent by the Contracting Agency to the
 Contractor, the Contractor shall notify the Claimant and WSDOT (Risk Management Office,
 PO Box 47418, Olympia, WA 98504-7418) of the following:
 a.	 Whether the claim is allowed or is denied in whole or in part, and, if so, the specific
 reasons for the denial of the individual claim, and if not denied in full, when payment
 has been or will be made to the claimant(s) for the portion of the claim that is
 allowed, or
 b.	 If resolution negotiations are continuing. In this event, status updates will be reported
 no longer than every 60 calendar days until the claim is resolved or a lawsuit is filed.
 If the Contractor fails to provide the above notification within 60 calendar days, then
 the Contractor shall yield to the Contracting Agency sole and exclusive discretion to allow
 all or part of the claim on behalf of the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be deemed to
 have WAIVED any and all defenses, objections, or other avoidances to the Contracting
 Agency’s allowance of the claim, or the amount allowed by the Contracting Agency,
 under common law, constitution, statute, or the Contract and these Standard Specifications.
 If all or part of a claim is allowed, the Contracting Agency will notify the Contractor via
 certified mail that it has allowed all or part of the claim and make appropriate payments to
 the claimant(s) with State funds.
 Payments of State funds by the Contracting Agency to claimant(s) under this section will
 be made on behalf of the Contractor and at the expense of the Contractor, and the Contractor
 shall be unconditionally obligated to reimburse the Contracting Agency for the “total
 reimbursement amount”, which is the sum of the amount paid to the claimant(s), plus all costs
 incurred by the Contracting Agency in evaluating the circumstances surrounding the claim,
 the allowance of the claim, the amount due to the claimant, and all other direct costs for the
 Contracting Agency’s administration and payment of the claim on the Contractor’s behalf.
 The Contracting Agency will be authorized to withhold the total reimbursement amount from
 amounts due the Contractor, or, if no further payments are to be made to the Contractor under
 the Contract, the Contractor shall directly reimburse the Contracting Agency for the amounts
 paid within 30 days of the date notice that the claim was allowed was sent to the Contractor.
 In the event reimbursement from the Contractor is not received by the Contracting Agency
 within 30 days, interest shall accrue on the total reimbursement amount owing at the rate of
 12 percent per annum calculated at a daily rate from the date the Contractor was notified that
 the claim was allowed. The Contracting Agency’s costs to enforce recovery of these amounts
 are additive to the amounts owing.
 The Contractor specifically assumes all potential liability for actions brought by employees
 of the Contractor and, solely for the purpose of enforcing the defense and indemnification
 obligations set forth in Section 1-07.14, the Contractor specifically waives any immunity
 granted under the State industrial insurance law, Title 51 RCW. This waiver has been mutually
 negotiated by the parties. The Contractor shall similarly require that each Subcontractor
 it retains in connection with the project comply with the terms of this paragraph, waive
 any immunity granted under Title 51 RCW, and assume all liability for actions brought by
 employees of the Subcontractor.

 excess of $50,000.00.
 10.	With the exception of the Commercial Automobile liability coverage, no policies of
 insurance required under this section shall contain an arbitration or alternative dispute
 resolution clause applicable to disputes between the insurer and its insureds. Any and

 within two business days of receipt of cancellation.
 13.	Failure on the part of the Contractor to maintain the insurance as required, or not
 to provide certification and copies of the insurance prior to the time specified in
 Subsection 11 above, shall constitute a material breach of Contract upon which the
 Contracting Agency may, after giving 5-business days notice to the Contractor to
 correct the breach, immediately terminate the Contract or, at its discretion, procure or
 renew such insurance and pay any and all premiums in connection therewith, with any
 sums so expended to be repaid to the Contracting Agency on demand, or at the sole
 discretion of the Contracting Agency, offset against funds due the Contractor from the
 Contracting Agency. All costs for insurance, including any payments of deductible
 amounts, shall be considered incidental to and included in the unit Contract prices and
 no additional payment will be made.

 Agency as specified in other sections of these Specifications. Nothing contained in this
 Contract is intended to create any third-party beneficiary rights in favor of the public or any
 individual utilizing the Highway facilities being constructed or improved under this Contract.
 1-07.23(1)  Construction Under Traffic
 The Contractor shall conduct all operations with the least possible obstruction and
 inconvenience to the public. The Contractor shall have under construction no greater length
 or amount of Work than can be prosecuted properly with due regards to the rights of the
 public. To the extent possible, the Contractor shall finish each section before beginning Work
 on the next. The Contractor shall enter interstate Highways only through legal movements
 from existing roads, streets, and through other access points specifically allowed by the
 Contract documents.

 To disrupt public traffic as little as possible, the Contractor shall permit traffic to pass
 through the Work with the least possible inconvenience or delay. The Contractor shall maintain
 existing roads, streets, sidewalks, and paths within the project limits, keeping them open and
 in good, clean, safe condition at all times. Accessibility to existing or temporary pedestrian
 push buttons shall not be impaired. Deficiencies caused by the Contractor’s operations
 shall be repaired at the Contractor’s expense. The Contractor shall also maintain roads,
 streets, sidewalks, and paths adjacent to the project limits when affected by the Contractor’s
 operations. Snow and ice control will be performed by the Contracting Agency on all
 projects. Cleanup of snow and ice control debris will be at the Contracting Agency’s expense.
 The Contractor shall perform the following:
 1.	 Remove or repair any condition resulting from the Work that might impede traffic
 or create a hazard.
 2.	 Keep existing traffic signal and Highway lighting systems in operation as the
 Work proceeds. (The Contracting Agency will continue the routine maintenance
 on such system.)
 3.	 Maintain the striping on the Roadway at the Contracting Agency’s expense. The
 Contractor shall be responsible for scheduling when to renew striping, subject to the
 approval of the Engineer. When the scope of the project does not require Work on the
 Roadway, the Contracting Agency will be responsible for maintaining the striping.
 4.	 Maintain existing permanent signing. Repair of signs will be at the Contracting
 Agency’s expense, except those damaged due to the Contractor’s operations.
 5.	 Keep drainage Structures clean to allow for free flow of water. Cleaning of existing
 drainage Structures will be at the Contracting Agency’s expense when approved by
 the Engineer, except when flow is impaired due to the Contractor’s operations.
 To protect the rights of abutting property owners, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Conduct the construction so that the least inconvenience as possible is caused to
 abutting property owners;
 2.	 Maintain ready access to driveways, houses, and buildings along the line of Work;
 3.	 Provide temporary approaches to crossing or intersecting roads and keep these
 approaches in good condition; and
 4.	 Provide another access before closing an existing one whenever the Contract calls for
 removing and replacing an abutting owner’s access.
 When traffic must pass through grading areas, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Make cuts and fills that provide a reasonably smooth, even Roadbed;
 2.	 Place, in advance of other grading Work, enough fill at all culverts and bridges to permit
 traffic to cross;
 3.	 Make Roadway cuts and fills, if ordered by the Engineer, in partial-width lifts,
 alternating lifts from side to side to permit traffic to pass on the side opposite the Work;
 4.	 Install culverts on half the width of the Traveled Way, keeping the other half open to
 traffic and unobstructed until the first half is ready for use;
 5.	 After rough grading or placing any subsequent layers, prepare the final Roadbed to a
 smooth, even surface (free of humps and dips) suitable for use by public traffic; and
 6.	 Settle dust with water, or other dust palliative, as the Engineer may order.
 If grading Work is on or next to a Roadway in use, the Contractor shall finish the grade
 immediately after rough grading and place surfacing materials as the Work proceeds.
 The Contractor shall conduct all operations to minimize any drop-offs (abrupt changes
 in roadway elevation) left exposed to traffic during nonworking hours. Unless otherwise
 specified in the Traffic Control Plan, drop-offs left exposed to traffic during nonworking
 hours shall be protected as follows:
 1.	 Drop-offs up to 0.20 foot, unless otherwise ordered by the Engineer, may remain
 exposed with appropriate warning signs alerting motorists of the condition.
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 1-71
 
 1-07
 
 Legal Relations and Responsibilities to the Public
 
 2.	 Drop-offs more than 0.20 foot that are in the Traveled Way or Auxiliary Lane will not
 be allowed unless protected with appropriate warning signs and further protected as
 indicated in 3b or 3c below.
 3.	 Drop-offs more than 0.20 foot, but no more than 0.50 foot, that are not within the
 Traveled Way shall be protected with appropriate warning signs and further protected
 by having one of the following:
 a.	 A wedge of compacted stable material placed at a slope of 4:1 or flatter.
 b.	 Channelizing devices (Type I barricades, plastic safety drums, or other devices
 36 inches or more in height) placed along the traffic side of the drop-off and a
 new edge of pavement stripes placed a minimum of 3 feet from the drop-off.
 The maximum spacing between the devices in feet shall be the posted speed in
 miles per hour. Pavement drop-off warning signs shall be placed in advance and
 throughout the drop-off treatment.
 c.	 Temporary concrete barrier or other approved barrier installed on the traffic side
 of the drop-off with 2 feet between the drop-off and the back of the barrier and
 a new edge of pavement stripe a minimum of 2 feet from the face of the barrier.
 An approved terminal, flare, or impact attenuator will be required at the beginning
 of the section. For night use, the barrier shall have standard delineation such as
 paint, reflective tape, lane markers, or warning lights.
 4.	 Drop-offs more than 0.50 foot not within the Traveled Way or Auxiliary Lane shall be
 protected with appropriate warning signs and further protected as indicated in 3a, 3b,
 or 3c if all of the following conditions are met:
 a.	 The drop-off is less than 2 feet;
 b.	 The total length throughout the project is less than 1 mile;
 c.	 The drop-off does not remain for more than 3 working days;
 d.	 The drop-off is not present on any of the holidays listed in Section 1-08.5; and
 e.	 The drop-off is only on one side of the Roadway.
 5.	 Drop-offs more than 0.50 foot that are not within the Traveled Way or Auxiliary Lane
 and are not otherwise covered by No. 4 above shall be protected with appropriate
 warning signs and further protected as indicated in 3a or 3c.
 6.	 Open trenches within the Traveled Way or Auxiliary Lane shall have a steel-plate
 cover placed and anchored over them. A wedge of suitable material, if required,
 shall be placed for a smooth transition between the pavement and the steel plate.
 Warning signs shall be used to alert motorists of the presence of the steel plates.
 1-07.23(2)  Construction and Maintenance of Detours
 Unless otherwise approved, the Contractor shall maintain two-way traffic during
 construction. The Contractor shall build, maintain in a safe condition, keep open to traffic,
 and remove when no longer needed:
 1.	 Detours and detour bridges that will accommodate traffic diverted from the Roadway,
 bridge, sidewalk, or path during construction;
 2.	 Detour crossings of intersecting Highways; and
 3.	 Temporary approaches.
 Unit Contract prices will cover construction, maintenance, and removal of all detours
 shown in the Plans or proposed by the Contracting Agency.
 The Contractor shall pay all costs to build, maintain, and remove any other detours,
 whether built for the Contractor’s convenience or to facilitate construction operations.
 Any detour proposed by the Contractor shall not be built until the Engineer approves.
 Surfacing and paving shall be consistent with traffic requirements.

 Upon failure of the Contractor to immediately provide, maintain, or remove detours or
 detour bridges when ordered to do so by the Engineer, the Contracting Agency may, without
 further notice to the Contractor or the Surety, provide, maintain, or remove the detours or
 detour bridges and deduct the costs from any payments due or coming due the Contractor.
 1-07.24  Rights of Way
 All rights of way for the completed facility will be provided by the Contracting Agency
 in advance of construction. Any exceptions will be noted in the Special Provisions. Should
 the necessary Right of Way not be available as provided in the Contract, an extension of time
 will be considered in accordance with Section 1-08.8.
 1-07.25  Opening of Sections to Traffic
 The Contracting Agency reserves the right to use and open to traffic any portion of
 the Work before the Physical Completion Date of the entire Contract without constituting
 acceptance of any of the Work. This action will not cause the Contracting Agency to incur
 any liability to the Contractor except as may otherwise be provided in the Contract.
 If the Contracting Agency opens any portion of the Work prior to the Physical Completion
 Date of the entire Contract because early opening is specified in the Contract or when the
 Contractor has failed to prosecute the Work continuously and efficiently, any Work remaining
 shall be performed by the Contractor at the unit Contract prices for the items of Work
 involved. No additional payment will be made for costs incurred by the Contractor because
 of: (1) inconvenience, additional length of travel to conform to established traffic patterns
 and planned access features; (2) compliance with statutes governing traffic regulations and
 limitations of loads; or (3) additional flagging costs necessary to protect the operations and
 the traveling public. The Contractor shall take all costs due to traffic using portions of the
 Work into account when submitting the Bid Proposal, and the unit Contract prices for the
 various items of Work involved shall include these costs.
 1-07.26  Personal Liability of Public Officers
 Neither the Governor, the Commission, the Secretary, the Engineer, nor any other officer
 or employee of the State shall be personally liable for any acts or failure to act in connection
 with the Contract, it being understood that in such matters, they are acting solely as agents
 of the State.
 1-07.27  No Waiver of State’s Legal Rights
 The State shall not be precluded or estopped by any measurement, estimate, or certificate
 made either before or after the completion and acceptance of the Work and payment therefore
 from showing the true amount and character of the Work performed and materials furnished by
 the Contractor, or from showing that any such measurement, estimate, or certificate is untrue
 or incorrectly made, or that the Work or materials do not conform in fact to the Contract. The
 State shall not be precluded or estopped, notwithstanding any such measurement, estimate,
 or certificate, and payment in accordance therewith, from recovering from the Contractor and
 the Sureties such damages as it may sustain by reason of the Contractor’s failure to comply
 with the terms of the Contract. Neither the acceptance by the Secretary, nor any payment
 for the whole or any part of the Work, nor any extension of time, nor any possession taken
 by the State shall operate as a waiver of any portion of the Contract or of any power herein
 reserved or any right to damages herein provided, or bar recovery of any money wrongfully
 or erroneously paid to the Contractor. A waiver of any breach of the Contract shall not be
 held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.
 The Contractor and the State recognize that the impact of overcharges to the State
 by the Contractor resulting from antitrust law violations by the Contractor’s suppliers
 or Subcontractors adversely affects the State rather than the Contractor. Therefore, the
 Contractor agrees to assign to the State any and all claims for such overcharges.

 1-08.1  Subcontracting
 Work done by the Contractor’s own organization shall account for at least 30 percent of
 the Awarded Contract price. Before computing this percentage, however, the Contractor may
 subtract (from the Awarded Contract price) the costs of any subcontracted Work on items the
 Contract designates as specialty items.
 The Contractor shall not subcontract Work unless the Engineer approves in writing. Each
 request to subcontract shall be on the form the Engineer provides. If the Engineer requests,
 the Contractor shall provide proof that the Subcontractor has the experience, ability, and
 equipment the Work requires. The Contractor shall require each Subcontractor to comply
 with Section 1-07.9 and to furnish all certificates and statements required by the Contract.
 Prior to subcontracting any Work, the Contractor shall verify that every first tier
 Subcontractor meets the responsibility criteria stated below at the time of subcontract
 execution. The Contractor shall include these responsibility criteria in every subcontract,
 and require every Subcontractor to:
 1.	 Possess any electrical contractor license required by RCW 19.28 or elevator contractor
 license required by RCW 70.87, if applicable;
 2.	 Have a certificate of registration in compliance with chapter RCW 18.27;
 3.	 Have a current State unified business identifier number;
 4.	 If applicable, have:
 a.	 Industrial insurance coverage for the bidder’s employees working in Washington
 (Title 51 RCW);
 b.	 An employment security department number (Title 50 RCW);
 c.	 A State excise tax registration number (Title 82 RCW);
 5.	 Not be disqualified from bidding on any public works contract under RCW 39.06.010
 or RCW 39.12.065(3).
 6.	 Verify these responsibility criteria for every lower tier subcontractor at the time of
 subcontract execution; and,
 7.	 Include these responsibility criteria in every lower tier subcontract.
 Along with the request to sublet, the Contractor shall submit the names of any contracting
 firms the Subcontractor proposes to use as lower tier subcontractors. Collectively, these lower
 tier subcontractors shall not do Work that exceeds 25 percent of the total amount subcontracted
 to a Subcontractor. When a Subcontractor is responsible for construction of a specific Structure
 or Structures, the following Work may be performed by lower tier Subcontractors without
 being subject to the 25 percent limitation:
 1.	 Furnishing and driving of piling, or
 2.	 Furnishing and installing concrete reinforcing and post-tensioning steel.
 Except for the 25 percent limit, lower tier subcontractors shall meet the same requirements
 as Subcontractors.
 The Engineer will approve the request only if satisfied with the proposed Subcontractor’s
 record, equipment, experience, and ability. Approval to subcontract shall not:
 1.	 Relieve the Contractor of any responsibility to carry out the Contract,
 2.	 Relieve the Contractor of any obligations or liability under the Contract and the
 Contractor’s bond,
 3.	 Create any contract between the Contracting Agency and the Subcontractor, or
 4.	 Convey to the Subcontractor any rights against the Contracting Agency.
 The Contracting Agency will not consider as subcontracting: (1) purchase of sand, gravel,
 crushed stone, crushed slag, batched concrete aggregates, ready-mix concrete, off-site
 fabricated structural steel, other off-site fabricated items, and any other materials supplied by
 Page 1-74

 established and recognized commercial plants; or (2) delivery of these materials to the Work
 site in vehicles owned or operated by such plants or by recognized independent or commercial
 hauling companies hired by those commercial plants. However, the Washington State
 Department of Labor and Industries may determine that RCW 39.12 applies to the employees
 of such firms identified in 1 and 2 above in accordance with WAC 296-127. If this should
 occur, the provisions of Section 1-07.9, as modified or supplemented, shall apply.
 On all projects, the Contractor shall certify to the actual amounts paid to all firms that
 were used as Subcontractors, lower tier subcontractors, manufacturers, regular dealers, or
 service providers on the Contract. This includes all Disadvantaged, Minority, Small, Veteran or
 Women’s Business Enterprise firms. This Certification shall be submitted to the Engineer on a
 monthly basis each month between Execution of the Contract and Physical Completion of the
 Contract using the application available at: https://wsdot.diversitycompliance.com. A monthly
 report shall be submitted for every month between Execution of the Contract and Physical
 Completion regardless of whether payments were made or work occurred.
 The Contractor shall comply with the requirements of RCW 39.04.250, 39.76.011,
 39.76.020, and 39.76.040, in particular regarding prompt payment to Subcontractors.
 Whenever the Contractor withholds payment to a Subcontractor for any reason including
 disputed amounts, the Contractor shall provide notice within 10 calendar days to the
 Subcontractor with a copy to the Contracting Agency identifying the reason for the
 withholding and a clear description of what the Subcontractor must do to have the withholding
 released. Retainage withheld by the Contractor prior to completion of the Subcontractors work
 is exempt from reporting as a payment withheld and is not included in the withheld amount.
 The Contracting Agency’s copy of the notice to Subcontractor for deferred payments shall
 be submitted to the Engineer concurrently with notification to the Subcontractor.
 If dissatisfied with any part of the subcontracted Work, the Engineer may request in writing
 that the Subcontractor be removed. The Contractor shall comply with this request at once and
 shall not employ the Subcontractor for any further Work under the Contract.
 1-08.1(1)  Prompt Payment, Subcontract Completion and Return of Retainage Withheld
 The following procedure shall apply to all subcontracts entered into as a part of
 this Contract:
 Requirements
 1.	 Upon request, the Engineer will provide a copy of any or all progress payment
 estimates, with regard to contract payments to any interested party to the project.
 2.	 The Contractor shall make payment to the Lower Tier Subcontractor not later than ten
 calendar days after receipt of payment for work satisfactorily completed by the Lower
 Tier Subcontractor, to the extent of the Lower Tier Subcontractor’s interest therein.
 3.	 In the event the Contractor believes they have the right under the Contract or
 Subcontract to withhold payment in part or whole from a Lower Tier Subcontractor they
 shall provide immediate notification to that Lower Tier Subcontractor and the Engineer.
 The notice shall include an accounting of payments to date, the value and reason for the
 withheld amount, and an explanation of what must be done to have the withheld amount
 released. The Lower Tier Subcontractor shall be paid within eight calendar days after
 the Subcontractor completes the remedial action identified.
 4.	 Every subcontract and lower tier subcontract shall have a dispute resolution process
 incorporated for resolving issues between the parties to the subcontract, or one shall be
 established as necessary.
 5.	 If the parties agree, the Contracting Agency will make a third party neutral available
 provided the parties to the dispute agree that the cost of doing so is split between them.
 6.	 The Engineer will withhold the same amount of funds from the Contractor as was
 withheld if the issue is not resolved by the next progress estimate.
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 1-08
 
 Prosecution and Progress
 
 7.	 Failure by a Contractor or Subcontractor to comply with these requirements may result
 in one or more of the following:
 a.	 Reflected in the Prime Contractor’s Performance Evaluation.
 b.	 Cancellation, termination or suspension of the Contract, in whole or in part.
 c.	 Sanctions as provided by the Contract; subcontract; or by law under applicable
 prompt payment statutes including RCW 39.04.250.
 8.	 The Subcontractor shall make a written request to the Contractor for the release of the
 Subcontractor’s retainage or retainage bond.
 9.	 Within 10 calendar days of the request, the Contractor shall determine if the subcontract
 has been satisfactorily completed including any required lien releases, documentation
 and material testing and shall inform the Subcontractor, in writing, of the Contractor’s
 determination.
 10.	If the Contractor determines that the subcontract has been satisfactorily completed, the
 Subcontractor’s retainage or retainage bond shall be released by the Contractor within
 10 calendar days from the date of the written notice. If the Contractor determines that
 the Subcontractor has not achieved satisfactory completion of the subcontract, the
 Contractor must provide the Subcontractor with written notice, stating specifically why
 the subcontract Work is not satisfactorily completed and what has to be done to achieve
 completion. The Contractor shall release the Subcontractor’s retainage or retainage
 bond within 10 calendar days after the Subcontractor has satisfactorily completed the
 Work identified in the notice.
 11.	In determining whether satisfactory completion has been achieved, the Contractor may
 require the Subcontractor to provide documentation such as certifications and releases,
 showing that all laborers, lower-tiered Subcontractors, suppliers of material and
 equipment, and others involved in the Subcontractor’s Work have been paid in full. The
 Contractor may also require any documentation from the Subcontractor that is required
 by the subcontract or by the Contract between the Contractor and Contracting Agency
 or by law such as affidavits of wages paid, and material acceptance certifications to the
 extent that they relate to the Subcontractor’s Work.
 12.	If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of the Specification and the
 Subcontractor’s retainage or retainage bond is wrongfully withheld, the Contractor will
 be subject to the actions described in No. 7 listed above. The Subcontractor may also
 seek recovery against the Contractor under applicable prompt pay statutes in addition
 to any other remedies provided for by the subcontract or by law.
 Conditions
 1.	 This clause does not create a contractual relationship between the Contracting Agency
 and any Subcontractor as stated in Section 1-08.1. Also, it is not intended to bestow
 upon any Subcontractor, the status of a third-party beneficiary to the Contract between
 the Contracting Agency and the Contractor.
 2.	 This section of the Contract does not apply to retainage withheld by the Contracting
 Agency from monies earned by the Contractor. The Contracting Agency shall continue
 to process the release of that retainage based upon the Completion Date of the project as
 defined in Section 1-08.5 Time for Completion and in accordance with the requirements
 and procedures set forth in RCW 60.28.
 Payment
 The Contractor shall be solely responsible for any additional costs involved in paying
 retainage to the Subcontractors prior to total project completion. Those costs shall be
 incidental to the respective Bid items.

 1-08.2  Assignment
 The Contractor shall not assign all or any part of the Work unless the Engineer approves
 in writing. The Engineer will not approve any proposed assignment that would relieve the
 original Contractor or Surety of responsibility under the Contract.
 Money due (or that will become due) to the Contractor may be assigned. If given written
 notice, the Contracting Agency will honor such an assignment to the extent the law permits.
 But the assignment shall be subject to all setoffs, withholdings, and deductions required by law
 and the Contract.
 1-08.3  Progress Schedule
 1-08.3(1)  General Requirements
 The Contractor shall submit Type A or Type B Progress Schedules and Schedule Updates
 to the Engineer for approval. Schedules shall show Work that complies with all time and order
 of Work requirements in the Contract. Scheduling terms and practices shall conform to the
 standards established in Construction Planning and Scheduling, Second Edition, published by
 the Associated General Contractors of America. Except for Weekly Look-Ahead Schedules,
 all schedules shall meet these General Requirements, and provide the following information:
 1.	 Include all activities necessary to physically complete the project.
 2.	 Show the planned order of Work activities in a logical sequence.
 3.	 Show durations of Work activities in working days as defined in Section 1-08.5.

 6.	 Show the Physical Completion of all Work within the authorized Contract time.
 Total float belongs to the project and shall not be for the exclusive benefit of any party.
 The Contracting Agency allocates its resources to a Contract based on the total time
 allowed in the Contract. The Contracting Agency may accept a Progress Schedule indicating
 an early Physical Completion Date but cannot guarantee the Contracting Agency’s resources
 will be available to meet an accelerated schedule. No additional compensation will be allowed
 if the Contractor is not able to meet their accelerated schedule due to the unavailability of
 Contracting Agency’s resources or for other reasons beyond the Contracting Agency’s control.
 If the Engineer determines that the Progress Schedule or any necessary Schedule Update
 does not provide the required information, then the schedule will be returned to the Contractor
 for correction and resubmittal.
 The Engineer’s approval of any schedule shall not transfer any of the Contractor’s
 responsibilities to the Contracting Agency. The Contractor alone shall remain responsible for
 adjusting forces, equipment, and Work schedules to ensure completion of the Work within the
 time(s) specified in the Contract.
 1-08.3(2)  Progress Schedule Types
 Type A Progress Schedules are required on all projects that do not contain the Bid item for
 Type B Progress Schedule. Type B Progress Schedules are required on all projects that contain
 the Bid item for Type B Progress Schedule. Weekly Look-Ahead Schedules and Schedule
 Updates are required on all projects.
 1-08.3(2)A  Type A Progress Schedule
 The Contractor shall submit five copies of a Type A Progress Schedule no later than
 10 days after the date the contract is executed, or some other mutually agreed upon submittal

 schedule, bar chart, or other standard schedule format. The Weekly Look-Ahead Schedule
 shall be submitted to the Engineer by the midpoint of the week preceding the scheduled
 Work or some other mutually agreed upon submittal time.
 1-08.3(3)  Schedule Updates
 The Engineer may request a Schedule Update when any of the following events occur:
 1.	 The project has experienced a change that affects the critical path.
 2.	 The sequence of Work is changed from that in the approved schedule.
 3.	 The project is significantly delayed.
 4.	 Upon receiving an extension of Contract time.
 The Contractor shall submit five copies of a Type A or Type B Schedule Update within
 15 calendar days of receiving a written request, or when an update is required by any other

 Payment of 80 percent of the lump sum price will be made upon approval of the
 Progress Schedule.
 Payment will be increased to 100 percent of the lump sum price upon completion of
 80 percent of the original total Contract Award amount.
 All costs for providing Type A Progress Schedules and Weekly Look-Ahead Schedules
 are considered incidental to other items of Work in the Contract.
 No payment will be made for Schedule Updates that are required due to the Contractors
 operations. Schedule Updates required by events that are attributed to the actions of the
 Contracting Agency will be paid for in accordance with Section 1-09.4.
 1-08.4  Prosecution of Work
 The Contractor shall begin Work within 21 calendar days from the date of execution of the
 Contract by the Contracting Agency, unless otherwise approved in writing. The Contractor
 shall diligently pursue the Work to the Physical Completion Date within the time specified in
 the Contract. Voluntary shutdown or slowing of operations by the Contractor shall not relieve
 the Contractor of the responsibility to complete the Work within the time(s) specified in
 the Contract.
 When shown in the Plans, the first order of work shall be the installation of high visibility
 fencing to delineate all areas for protection or restoration, as described in the Contract.

 1-08.5  Time for Completion
 The Contractor shall complete all physical Contract Work within the number of “working
 days” stated in the Contract Provisions or as extended by the Engineer in accordance with
 Section 1-08.8. Every day will be counted as a “working day” unless it is a nonworking day
 or an Engineer determined unworkable day. A nonworking day is defined as a Saturday, a
 Sunday, a whole or half day on which the Contract specifically prohibits Work on the critical
 path of the Contractor’s approved progress schedule, or one of these holidays: January 1, the
 third Monday of January, the third Monday of February, Memorial Day, July 4, Labor Day,
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 Prosecution and Progress
 
 November 11, Thanksgiving Day, the day after Thanksgiving, and Christmas Day. When any
 of these holidays fall on a Sunday, the following Monday shall be counted a nonworking day.
 When the holiday falls on a Saturday, the preceding Friday shall be counted a nonworking day.
 The days between December 25 and January 1 will be classified as nonworking days.
 An unworkable day is defined as a half or whole day the Engineer declares to be
 unworkable because of weather or conditions caused by the weather that prevents satisfactory
 and timely performance of the Work shown on the critical path of the Contractor’s approved
 progress schedule. Other conditions beyond the control of the Contractor may qualify for an
 extension of time in accordance with Section 1-08.8.
 Contract time shall begin on the first working day following the 21st calendar day after the
 date the Contracting Agency executes the Contract. If the Contractor starts Work on the project
 at an earlier date, then Contract time shall begin on the first working day when on-site Work
 begins. The Contract Provisions may specify another starting date for Contract time, in which
 case, time will begin on the starting date specified.
 Each working day shall be charged to the Contract as it occurs, until the Contract Work
 is physically complete. If Substantial Completion has been granted and all the authorized
 working days have been used, charging of working days will cease. Each week the Engineer
 will provide the Contractor a statement that shows the number of working days: (1) charged
 to the Contract the week before; (2) specified for the Physical Completion of the Contract;
 and (3) remaining for the Physical Completion of the Contract. The statement will also show
 the nonworking days and any half or whole day the Engineer declares as unworkable. Within
 10 calendar days after the date of each statement, the Contractor shall file a written protest
 of any alleged discrepancies in it. To be considered by the Engineer, the protest shall be in
 sufficient detail to enable the Engineer to ascertain the basis and amount of time disputed.
 By not filing such detailed protest in that period, the Contractor shall be deemed as having
 accepted the statement as correct.
 The Engineer will give the Contractor written notice of the Physical Completion Date for
 all Work the Contract requires. That date shall constitute the Physical Completion Date of the
 Contract, but shall not imply the Secretary’s acceptance of the Work or the Contract.
 The Engineer will give the Contractor written notice of the Completion Date of the
 Contract after all the Contractor’s obligations under the Contract have been performed by the
 Contractor. The following events must occur before the Completion Date can be established:
 1.	 The physical Work on the project must be complete; and
 2.	 The Contractor must furnish all documentation required by the Contract and required
 by law, to allow the Contracting Agency to process final acceptance of the Contract.
 The following documents must be received by the Engineer prior to establishing a
 Completion Date:
 a.	 Certified Payrolls (Federal-aid Projects)
 b.	 Material Acceptance Certification Documents
 c.	 Monthly Reports of Amounts Paid as MBE/WBE Participants, or Monthly Reports
 of Amounts Credited as DBE Participation, as required by the Contract Provisions
 d.	 Final Contract Voucher Certification
 e.	 Copies of the approved “Affidavit of Prevailing Wages Paid” for the Contractor
 and all Subcontractors
 1-08.6  Suspension of Work
 The Engineer may order suspension of all or any part of the Work if:
 1.	 Unsuitable weather prevents satisfactory and timely performance of the Work; or
 2.	 The Contractor does not comply with the Contract; or
 3.	 It is in the public interest.
 When ordered by the Engineer to suspend or resume Work, the Contractor shall do so
 immediately.
 Page 1-80
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Prosecution and Progress
 
 1-08
 
 If the Work is suspended for reason (1) above, the period of Work stoppage will be counted
 as unworkable days. But if the Engineer believes the Contractor should have completed the
 suspended Work before the suspension, all or part of the suspension period may be counted
 as working days. The Engineer will set the number of unworkable days (or parts of days) by
 deciding how long the suspension delayed the entire project.
 If the Work is suspended for reason (2) above, the period of Work stoppage will be counted
 as working days. The lost Work time, however, shall not relieve the Contractor from any
 Contract responsibility.
 If the performance of all or any part of the Work is suspended, delayed, or interrupted for
 an unreasonable period of time by an act of the Contracting Agency in the administration
 of the Contract, or by failure to act within the time specified in the Contract (or if no time is
 specified, within a reasonable time), the Engineer will make an adjustment for any increase
 in the cost or time for the performance of the Contract (excluding profit) necessarily caused
 by the suspension, delay, or interruption. However, no adjustment will be made for any
 suspension, delay, or interruption if (1) the performance would have been suspended, delayed,
 or interrupted by any other cause, including the fault or negligence of the Contractor, or (2) an
 equitable adjustment is provided for or excluded under any other provision of the Contract.
 If the Contractor believes that the performance of the Work is suspended, delayed, or
 interrupted for an unreasonable period of time and such suspension, delay, or interruption
 is the responsibility of the Contracting Agency, the Contractor shall immediately submit a
 written notice of protest to the Engineer as provided in Section 1-04.5. No adjustment shall
 be allowed for any costs incurred more than 10 calendar days before the date the Engineer
 receives the Contractor’s written notice of protest. If the Contractor contends damages have
 been suffered as a result of such suspension, delay, or interruption, the protest shall not be
 allowed unless the protest (stating the amount of damages) is asserted in writing as soon
 as practicable, but no later than the date of the Contractor’s signature on the Final Contract
 Voucher Certification. The Contractor shall keep full and complete records of the costs and
 additional time of such suspension, delay, or interruption and shall permit the Engineer to have
 access to those records and any other records as may be deemed necessary by the Engineer to
 assist in evaluating the protest.
 The Engineer will determine if an equitable adjustment in cost or time is due as provided
 in this section. The equitable adjustment for increase in costs, if due, shall be subject to the
 limitations provided in Section 1-09.4, provided that no profit of any kind will be allowed
 on any increase in cost necessarily caused by the suspension, delay, or interruption.
 Request for extensions of time will be evaluated in accordance with Section 1-08.8.
 The Engineer’s determination as to whether an adjustment should be made will be final
 as provided in Section 1-05.1.
 No claim by the Contractor under this clause shall be allowed unless the Contractor has
 followed the procedures provided in this section and in Sections 1-04.5 and 1-09.11.
 1-08.7  Maintenance During Suspension
 Before and during any suspension (as described in Section 1-08.6) the Contractor shall
 protect the Work from damage or deterioration. Suspension shall not relieve the Contractor
 from anything the Contract requires unless this section states otherwise.
 At no expense to the Contracting Agency, the Contractor shall provide through the
 construction area safe, smooth, and unobstructed roadways and pedestrian access routes for
 public use during the suspension (as required in Section 1-07.23 or the Special Provisions).
 This may include a temporary road, alternative pedestrian access route or detour.
 If the Engineer determines that the Contractor failed to pursue the Work diligently before
 the suspension, or failed to comply with the Contract or orders, then the Contractor shall
 maintain the temporary Roadway in use during suspension. In this case, the Contractor shall
 bear the maintenance costs. If the Contractor fails to maintain the temporary Roadway, the
 Contracting Agency will do the Work and deduct all resulting costs from payments due to
 the Contractor.
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 1-81
 
 1-08
 
 Prosecution and Progress
 
 If the Engineer determines that the Contractor has pursued the Work diligently before the
 suspension, then the Contracting Agency will maintain the temporary Roadway (and bear
 its cost). This Contracting Agency-provided maintenance work will include only routine
 maintenance of:
 1.	 The Traveled Way, Auxiliary Lanes, Shoulders, and detour surface;
 2.	 Roadway drainage along and under the traveled Roadway or detour; and
 3.	 All barricades, signs, and lights needed for directing traffic through the temporary
 Roadway or detour in the construction area.
 The Contractor shall protect and maintain all other Work in areas not used by traffic.
 All costs associated with protecting and maintaining such Work shall be the responsibility
 of the Contractor except those costs associated with implementing the TESC Plan according
 to Section 8-01.
 After any suspension during which the Contracting Agency has done the routine
 maintenance, the Contractor shall accept the traveled Roadway or detour as is when Work
 resumes. The Contractor shall make no claim against the Contracting Agency for the condition
 of the Roadway or detour.
 After any suspension, the Contractor shall resume all responsibilities the Contract assigns
 for the Work.
 1-08.8  Extensions of Time
 The Contractor shall submit any requests for time extensions to the Engineer in writing
 no later than 10 working days after the delay occurs. The requests for time extension shall be
 limited to the effect on the critical path of the Contractor’s approved schedule attributable to
 the change or event giving rise to the request.
 To be considered by the Engineer, the request shall be in sufficient detail (as determined by
 the Engineer) to enable the Engineer to ascertain the basis and amount of the time requested.
 The request shall include an updated schedule that supports the request and demonstrates
 that the change or event: (1) had a specific impact on the critical path, and except in cases of
 concurrent delay, was the sole cause of such impact, and (2) could not have been avoided by
 resequencing of the Work or by using other reasonable alternatives. If a request combined
 with previous extension requests, equals 20 percent or more of the original Contract time
 then the Contractor’s letter of request must bear consent of Surety. In evaluating any request,
 the Engineer will consider how well the Contractor used the time from Contract execution
 up to the point of the delay and the effect the delay has on any completion times included in
 the Special Provisions. The Engineer will evaluate and respond within 15 calendar days of
 receiving the request.
 The authorized time for Physical Completion will be extended for a period equal to the
 time the Engineer determines the Work was delayed because of:
 1.	 Adverse weather causing the time requested to be unworkable, provided that the
 Engineer had not already declared the time to be unworkable and the Contractor has
 filed a written protest according to Section 1-08.5.
 2.	 Any action, neglect, or default of the Contracting Agency, its officers, or employees,
 or of any other contractor employed by the Contracting Agency.
 3.	 Fire or other casualty for which the Contractor is not responsible.
 4.	Strikes.
 5.	 Any other conditions for which these Specifications permit time extensions such as:
 a.	In Section 1-04.4 if a change increases the time to do any of the Work including
 unchanged Work.
 b.	In Section 1-04.5 if increased time is part of a protest that is found to be a
 valid protest.
 c.	In Section 1-04.7 if a changed condition is determined to exist that caused a
 delay in completing the Contract.
 Page 1-82

 Prosecution and Progress
 
 1-08
 
 d.	In Section 1-05.3 if the Contracting Agency does not approve properly prepared
 and acceptable drawings within 30 calendar days.
 e.	In Section 1-07.13 if the performance of the Work is delayed as a result of damage
 by others.
 f.	In Section 1-07.17 if the removal or the relocation of any utility by forces other
 than the Contractor caused a delay.
 g.	In Section 1-07.24 if a delay results from all the Right of Way necessary for
 the construction not being purchased and the Special Provisions does not make
 specific provisions regarding unpurchased Right of Way.
 h.	In Section 1-08.6 if the performance of the Work is suspended, delayed, or
 interrupted for an unreasonable period of time that proves to be the responsibility
 of the Contracting Agency.
 i.	In Section 1-09.11 if a dispute or claim also involves a delay in completing the
 Contract and the dispute or claim proves to be valid.
 j.	In Section 1-09.6 for Work performed on a force account basis.
 6.	 If the actual quantity of Work performed for a Bid item was more than the original
 Plan quantity and increased the duration of a critical activity. Extensions of time will
 be limited to only that quantity exceeding the original Plan quantity.
 7.	 Exceptional causes not specifically identified in items 1 through 6, provided the request
 letter proves the Contractor had no control over the cause of the delay and could have
 done nothing to avoid or shorten it.
 Working days added to the Contract by time extensions, when time has overran, shall only
 apply to days on which liquidated damages or direct engineering have been charged, such as
 the following:
 If Substantial Completion has been granted prior to all of the authorized working days
 being used, then the number of days in the time extension will eliminate an equal number
 of days on which direct engineering charges have accrued. If the Substantial Completion
 Date is established after all of the authorized working days have been used, then the
 number of days in the time extension will eliminate an equal number of days on which
 liquidated damages or direct engineering charges have accrued.
 The Engineer will not allow a time extension for any cause listed above if it resulted from
 the Contractor’s default, collusion, action or inaction, or failure to comply with the Contract.
 The Contracting Agency considers the time specified in the Special Provisions as sufficient
 to do all the Work. For this reason, the Contracting Agency will not grant a time extension for:
 1.	 Failure to obtain all materials and workers unless the failure was the result of
 exceptional causes as provided above in Subsection 7;
 2.	 Changes, protests, increased quantities, or changed conditions (Section 1-04) that do
 not delay the completion of the Contract or prove to be an invalid or inappropriate time
 extension request;
 3.	 Delays caused by nonapproval of drawings or plans as provided in Section 1-05.3;
 4.	 Rejection of faulty or inappropriate equipment as provided in Section 1-05.9;
 5.	 Correction of thickness deficiency as provided in Section 5-05.5(1)B.
 The Engineer will determine whether the time extension should be granted, the reasons
 for the extension, and the duration of the extension, if any. Such determination will be final
 as provided in Section 1-05.1.
 1-08.9  Liquidated Damages
 Time is of the essence of the Contract. Delays inconvenience the traveling public, obstruct
 traffic, interfere with and delay commerce, and increase risk to Highway users. Delays also
 cost tax payers undue sums of money, adding time needed for administration, engineering,
 inspection, and supervision.

 When the Contract Work has progressed to the extent that the Contracting Agency has
 full use and benefit of the facilities, both from the operational and safety standpoint, all the
 initial plantings are completed and only minor incidental Work, replacement of temporary
 substitute facilities, plant establishment periods, or correction or repair remains to physically
 complete the total Contract, the Engineer may determine the Contract Work is substantially
 complete. The Engineer will notify the Contractor in writing of the Substantial Completion
 Date. For overruns in Contract time occurring after the date so established, the formula for
 liquidated damages shown above will not apply. For overruns in Contract time occurring after
 the Substantial Completion Date, liquidated damages shall be assessed on the basis of direct
 engineering and related costs assignable to the project until the actual Physical Completion
 Date of all the Contract Work. The Contractor shall complete the remaining Work as promptly
 as possible. Upon request by the Engineer, the Contractor shall furnish a written schedule for
 completing the physical Work on the Contract.
 Liquidated damages will not be assessed for any days for which an extension of time
 is granted. No deduction or payment of liquidated damages will, in any degree, release the
 Contractor from further obligations and liabilities to complete the entire Contract.
 1-08.10  Termination of Contract
 1-08.10(1)  Termination for Default
 The Contracting Agency may terminate the Contract upon the occurrence of any one or
 more or the following events:
 1.	 If the Contractor fails to supply sufficient skilled workers or suitable materials or
 equipment;
 2.	 If the Contractor refuses or fails to prosecute the Work with such diligence as will
 ensure its Physical Completion within the original Physical Completion time and any
 extensions of time which may have been granted to the Contractor by change order
 or otherwise;
 3.	 If the Contractor is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or makes a general assignment
 for the benefit of creditors, or if the Contractor or a third party files a petition to take
 advantage of any debtor’s act or to reorganize under the bankruptcy or similar laws
 concerning the Contractor, or if a trustee or receiver is appointed for the Contractor or
 for any of the Contractor’s property on account of the Contractor’s insolvency, and the
 Contractor or its successor in interest does not provide adequate assurance of future
 performance in accordance with the Contract within 15 calendar days of receipt of a
 request for assurance from the Contracting Agency;
 4.	 If the Contractor disregards laws, ordinances, rules, codes, regulations, orders or similar
 requirements of any public entity having jurisdiction;
 Page 1-84
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Prosecution and Progress
 
 1-08
 
 5.	 If the Contractor disregards the authority of the Contracting Agency;
 6.	 If the Contractor performs Work which deviates from the Contract, and neglects or
 refuses to correct rejected Work; or
 7.	 If the Contractor otherwise violates in any material way any provisions or requirements
 of the Contract.
 Once the Contracting Agency determines that sufficient cause exists to terminate the
 Contract, written notice shall be given to the Contractor and its Surety indicating that the
 Contractor is in breach of the Contract and that the Contractor is to remedy the breach within
 15 calendar days after the notice is sent. In case of an emergency such as potential damage
 to life or property, the response time to remedy the breach after the notice may be shortened.
 If the remedy does not take place to the satisfaction of the Contracting Agency, the Engineer
 may, by serving written notice to the Contractor and Surety either:
 1.	 Transfer the performance of the Work from the Contractor to the Surety; or
 2.	 Terminate the Contract and at the Contracting Agency’s option prosecute it to
 completion by contract or otherwise. Any extra costs or damages to the Contracting
 Agency shall be deducted from any money due or coming due to the Contractor under
 the Contract.
 If the Engineer elects to pursue one remedy, it will not bar the Engineer from pursuing
 other remedies on the same or subsequent breaches.
 Upon receipt of a notice that the Work is being transferred to the Surety, the Surety shall
 enter upon the premises and take possession of all materials, tools, and appliances for the
 purpose of completing the Work included under the Contract and employ by contract or
 otherwise any person or persons satisfactory to the Engineer to finish the Work and provide the
 materials without termination of the Contract. Such employment shall not relieve the Surety of
 its obligations under the Contract and the bond. If there is a transfer to the Surety, payments on
 estimates covering Work subsequent to the transfer shall be made to the extent permitted under
 law to the Surety or its agent without any right of the Contractor to make any claim.
 If the Engineer terminates the Contract or provides such sufficiency of labor or materials
 as required to complete the Work, the Contractor shall not be entitled to receive any further
 payments on the Contract until all the Work contemplated by the Contract has been fully
 performed. The Contractor shall bear any extra expenses incurred by the Contracting Agency
 in completing the Work, including all increased costs for completing the Work, and all
 damages sustained, or which may be sustained, by the Contracting Agency by reason of such
 refusal, neglect, failure, or discontinuance of Work by the Contractor. If liquidated damages
 are provided in the Contract, the Contractor shall be liable for such liquidated damages until
 such reasonable time as may be required for Physical Completion of the Work. After all the
 Work contemplated by the Contract has been completed, the Engineer will calculate the total
 expenses and damages for the completed Work. If the total expenses and damages are less than
 any unpaid balance due the Contractor, the excess will be paid by the Contracting Agency to
 the Contractor. If the total expenses and damages exceed the unpaid balance, the Contractor
 and the Surety shall be jointly and severally liable to the Contracting Agency and shall pay
 the difference to the State of Washington, Department of Transportation on demand.
 In exercising the Contracting Agency’s right to prosecute the Physical Completion of the
 Work, the Contracting Agency shall have the right to exercise its sole discretion as to the
 manner, method, and reasonableness of the costs of completing the Work. In the event that
 the Contracting Agency takes Bids for remedial Work or Physical Completion of the project,
 the Contractor shall not be eligible for the Award of such Contracts.
 In the event the Contract is terminated, the termination shall not affect any rights of
 the Contracting Agency against the Contractor. The rights and remedies of the Contracting
 Agency under the Termination Clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies
 provided by law or under this Contract. Any retention or payment of monies to the
 Contractor by the Contracting Agency will not release the Contractor from liability.

 Prosecution and Progress
 
 If a notice of termination for default has been issued and it is later determined for any
 reason that the Contractor was not in default, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be
 the same as if the notice of termination had been issued pursuant to Termination for Public
 Convenience in Section 1-08.10(2). This shall include termination for default because of
 failure to prosecute the Work, and the delay was found to be excusable under the provisions
 of Section 1-08.8.
 1-08.10(2)  Termination for Public Convenience
 The Engineer may terminate the Contract in whole, or from time to time in part, whenever:
 1.	 The Contractor is prevented from proceeding with the Work as a direct result of an
 Executive Order of the President with respect to the prosecution of war or in the interest
 of national defense; or an Executive Order of the President or Governor of the State
 with respect to the preservation of energy resources;
 2.	 The Contractor is prevented from proceeding with the Work by reason of a preliminary,
 special, or permanent restraining order of a court of competent jurisdiction where the
 issuance of such restraining order is primarily caused by acts or omissions of persons
 or agencies other than the Contractor; or
 3.	 The Engineer determines that such termination is in the best interests of the
 Contracting Agency.
 1-08.10(3)  Termination for Public Convenience Payment Request
 After receipt of Termination for Public Convenience as provided in Section 1-08.10(2),
 the Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Agency a request for costs associated with the
 termination. The request shall be prepared in accordance with the claim procedures outlined
 in Sections 1-09.11 and 1-09.12. The request shall be submitted promptly but in no event later
 than 90 calendar days from the effective date of termination.
 The Contractor agrees to make all records available to the extent deemed necessary by the
 Engineer to verify the costs in the Contractor’s payment request.
 1-08.10(4)  Payment for Termination for Public Convenience
 Whenever the Contract is terminated in accordance with Section 1-08.10(2), payment
 will be made in accordance with Section 1-09.5 for the actual Work performed.
 If the Contracting Agency and the Contractor cannot agree as to the proper amount
 of payment, then the matter will be resolved as outlined in Section 1-09.13 except that,
 if the termination occurs because of the issuance of a restraining order as provided in
 Section 1-08.10(2), the matter will be resolved through mandatory and binding arbitration
 as described in Sections 1-09.13(3)A and B, regardless of the amount of the claim.
 1-08.10(5)  Responsibility of the Contractor and Surety
 Termination of a Contract shall not relieve the Contractor of any responsibilities under
 the Contract for Work performed. Nor shall termination of the Contract relieve the Surety
 or Sureties of obligations under the Contract Bond or retainage bond for Work performed.

 Measurement and Payment
 
 1-09
 
 1-09  Measurement and Payment
 1-09.1  Measurement of Quantities
 In measuring all acceptably completed Bid items of Work, the Engineer will:
 1.	 Use United States standard measure;
 2.	 Make all measurements as described in this section, unless individual Specifications
 require otherwise;
 3.	 Follow methods generally recognized as conforming to good engineering practice;
 4.	 Conform to the usual practice of the Contracting Agency by carrying measurements
 and computations to the proper significant figure or fraction of units for each item; and
 5.	 Measure horizontally or vertically (unless otherwise specified).
 The terms listed below shall be defined as follows in all measurements under this section:
 “Lump Sum” (when used as an item of payment): complete payment for the Work
 described for that item in the Contract.
 “Gage” (in measurement of plates): the U.S. Standard Gage.
 “Gage” (in measurement of galvanized sheets used to manufacture corrugated metal pipe,
 metal plate pipe culverts and arches, and metal cribbing): that specified in AASHTO M 36,
 M 167, M 196, M 197, or M 219.
 “Gage” (in measurement of wire): that specified in AASHTO M 32.
 “Ton”: 2,000 pounds of avoirdupois weight.
 Items of payment that have “Lump Sum” or “Force Account” in the Bid item of Work shall
 have no specific unit of measurement requirement.
 For each basis of measurement listed below, the Engineer will use the method of
 measurement described. For Bid items or materials measured on the basis of:
 Hour – Measured for each hour that Work is actually performed. Portions of an hour will
 be rounded up to a half hour.
 Square Yard or Square Foot – The measurement shall be a calculation from the neat
 dimensions shown in the Plans or as altered by the Engineer. If there is an exception within
 the measured area where the item of Work is not performed (such as a drainage vault within
 a measured sidewalk) and if the exception area is greater than 9 square feet, then the area of
 the exception will be subtracted from the payment area calculated from the neat dimensions.
 Linear Foot (pipe culverts, guard rail, underdrains, etc.) – Measured parallel to the
 Structure’s base or foundation, unless the Plans require otherwise.
 Weight – Weighed as required in Section 1-09.2.
 Volume (of excavation and embankment) – Measured by the average-end-area method or
 by the finite element analysis method utilizing digital terrain modeling techniques. All or some
 computations may be based on ground elevations and other data derived photogrammetrically.
 The Engineer may correct for curvature.
 Volume (in the hauling vehicle) – Measured at the point of delivery. Hauling vehicles
 may be of any size or type the Engineer approves provided that the body is of such shape that
 the actual contents may be readily and accurately determined. If the Engineer requires, the
 Contractor shall level loads at the delivery point to facilitate measurement.
 For each item listed below, the Engineer will use the method of measurement described.
 Structures – Measured on the neat lines shown in the Plans or as altered by the Engineer.
 When a complete Structure or structural unit is specified as the unit of measurement, the unit
 shall include all fittings and accessories.
 Timber – Measured by the thousand board feet (MBM) actually used in the Structure.
 Measurements will be based on nominal widths and thicknesses and the extreme length of
 each piece.
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 1-87
 
 1-09
 
 Measurement and Payment
 
 Standard Manufactured Items (fence, wire, plates, rolled shapes, pipe conduit, etc.,
 when specified) – Measured by the manufacturer’s identification of gage, unit weight, section
 dimension, etc. The Engineer will accept manufacturing tolerances set by each industry unless
 cited Specifications require more stringent tolerances.
 Cement – Measured by the pound, ton, or sack. A sack shall be 94 pounds.
 Asphalt – Measured by the gallon or ton. If measured by gallon, measurement will be
 made at 60 F (or will be corrected to the volume at 60 F in keeping with ASTM D1250).
 If shipped by rail, truck, or transport, measurement will be by net certified scale masses
 or certified volumes (corrected for material lost en route or not actually incorporated into
 the Work).
 No measurement will be made for:
 1.	 Work performed or materials placed outside lines shown in the Plans or set by
 the Engineer;
 2.	 Materials wasted, used, or disposed of in a manner contrary to the Contract;
 3.	 Rejected materials (including those rejected after placement if the rejection resulted
 from the Contractor’s failure to comply with the Contract);
 4.	 Hauling and disposing of rejected materials;
 5.	 Material remaining on hand after the Work is completed, except as provided in
 Sections 1-09.5 and 1-09.10; or
 6.	 Any other Work or material contrary to any Contract Provision.
 1-09.2  Weighing Equipment
 1-09.2(1)  General Requirements for Weighing Equipment
 Unless specified otherwise, any Highway or bridge construction materials to be
 proportioned or measured and paid for by weight shall be weighed on a scale.
 Scales – Scales shall:
 1.	 Be accurate to within 0.5 percent of the correct weight throughout the range of use;
 2.	 Not include spring balances;
 3.	 Include beams, dials, or other reliable readout equipment;
 4.	 Be built to prevent scale parts from binding, vibrating, or being displaced and to
 protect all working parts from falling material, wind, and weather; and
 5.	 Be carefully maintained, with bunkers and platforms kept clear of accumulated
 materials that could cause errors and with knife edges given extra care and protection.
 Scale Operations – “Contractor-provided scale operations” are defined as operations
 where a scale is set up by the Contractor specifically for the project and most, if not all,
 material weighed on the scale is utilized for Contract Work. In this situation, the Contractor
 shall provide a person to operate the project scale, write tickets, perform scale checks and
 prepare reports.
 “Commercial scale operations” include the use of established scales used to sell materials
 to the public on a regular basis. In addition, for the purposes of this Specification, all batch,
 hopper, and belt scales are considered to be commercial scales. When a commercial scale is
 used as the project scale, the Contractor may utilize a commercial scale operator provided it
 is at no additional cost to the Contracting Agency.
 In addition, the Contractor shall ensure that:
 1.	 The Engineer is allowed to observe the weighing operation and check the daily scale
 weight record;
 2.	 Scale verification checks are performed at the direction of the Contracting Agency
 (see Section 1-09.2(5));
 3.	 Several times each day, the scale operator records and makes certain the platform scale
 balances and returns to zero when the load is removed; and

 4.	 Test results and scale weight records for each day’s hauling operations are provided to
 the Engineer daily. Unless otherwise approved, reporting shall utilize WSDOT Form
 422-027 Scaleman’s Daily Report.
 Trucks and Tickets – Each truck to be weighed shall bear a unique identification
 number. This number shall be legible and in plain view of the scale operator. Each vehicle
 operator shall obtain a weigh or load ticket from the scale operator. The Contracting Agency
 will provide item quantity tickets for scales that are not self-printing. The Contractor
 shall provide tickets for self-printing scales. All tickets shall, at a minimum, contain the
 following information:
 1.	 Date of haul;
 2.	 Contract number;
 3.	 Contract unit Bid item;
 4.	 Unit of measure;
 5.	 Identification number of hauling vehicle; and
 6.	 Weight delivered:
 a.	 Net weight in the case of batch and hopper scales.
 b.	 Gross weight, tare and net weight in the case of platform scales (tare may be omitted
 if a tare beam is used).
 c.	 Approximate load out weight in the case of belt conveyor scales.
 The vehicle operator shall deliver the ticket in legible condition to the material receiver at
 the material delivery point. The material delivery point is defined as the location where the
 material is incorporated into the permanent Work.
 1-09.2(2)  Specific Requirements for Batching Scales
 Each batching scale shall be designed to support a weighing container. The arrangement
 shall make it convenient for the operator to remove material from the weighing container
 while watching readout devices. Any weighing container mounted on a platform scale shall
 have its center of gravity directly over the platform centerline. Batching scales used for
 portland cement concrete or hot mix asphalt shall not be used for batching other materials.
 Readout devices used for batching or hopper scales shall be marked at intervals evenly
 spaced throughout and shall be based on the scale’s nominal rated capacity. These intervals
 shall not exceed one-tenth of 1 percent of the nominal rated capacity. Before use at a new site
 and then at 6-month intervals, all batching and hopper scales shall be: approved under rules
 of the Weights and Measures Section of the Washington State Department of Agriculture, or
 serviced and tested with at least 10,000 pounds by an agent of its manufacturer. In either case,
 the Contractor shall provide the Engineer with a copy of the final test results.
 1-09.2(3)  Specific Requirements for Platform Scales
 Each platform scale shall be able to weigh the entire hauling vehicle or combination
 of connected vehicles at one time. No part of the vehicle or vehicle combination will be
 permitted off the platform as it is weighed. A tare weight shall be taken of each hauling vehicle
 at least once daily.
 Any platform scale shall be installed and maintained with the platform level and with rigid
 bulkheads at either end to prevent binding or shifting. The readout device shall be marked at
 intervals of no more than 40 pounds. Test records shall show results to the nearest 20 pounds.
 During weighing operations, weights shall be read and recorded to the nearest 100 pounds.
 Before use at a new site and then at 6-month intervals, any platform scale shall be: approved
 under rules of the Washington State Department of Agriculture’s Weights and Measures
 Section, or serviced and tested with at least 10,000 pounds by an agent of its manufacturer.
 In either case, the Contractor shall provide the Engineer with a copy of the final test results.

 1-09.2(4)  Specific Requirements for Belt Conveyor Scales
 The Engineer may approve conveyor-belt weighing of untreated materials if the method
 and device meet all general requirements for weighing equipment. The recording tape,
 odometer, totalizer, calibration adjustment, and clock-time imprinter shall be kept locked and
 the Engineer shall retain all keys. All belt-conveyor scales shall comply with the requirements
 for Belt-Conveyor Scales in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
 Handbook No. 44, except where these Specifications modify those requirements.
 A static load test shall be made: each day after the belt-conveyor has run continuously
 for about 30 minutes, and again, immediately after the air temperature changes significantly.
 If the static load test reveals a need for adjustment, the Contractor shall perform a chain
 test. The Contractor shall make the computation of the test chain calibration, the calibration
 procedures and results, and related records available for the Engineer’s review. The test
 chain shall be clearly marked with its calibration, carried in a suitable container, and kept
 immediately available for testing.
 1-09.2(5) Measurement
 Scale Verification Checks – The Engineer will verify the accuracy of each batch, hopper,
 or platform scale. The frequency of verification checks will be such that at least one test
 weekly is performed for each scale used in weighing contract items of Work.
 Verification checks may not be routinely conducted for weighed material, whose proposal
 quantity multiplied by the unit Bid price, has a value less than $20,000.
 The verification will consist of one of the following methods and be at the Contractor’s
 option:
 1.	 Weigh a loaded truck on a separate certified platform scale designated by the
 Contractor, for the purpose of scale verification.
 2.	 Weigh a vehicle that weighs at least 10,000 pounds on a separate certified scale and
 then check the project scale with it.
 3.	 Establish a certified fixed load weighing at least 10,000 pounds as a check-weight. The
 certification shall consist of an affidavit affirming the correct weight of the fixed load.
 Should the scale verification check reveal a weight difference of more than 0.5 percent,
 a second scale verification check shall be performed immediately. If the weight differences
 of both comparison checks exceed the 0.5-percent limit and the scale has been overweighing,
 the Contractor shall immediately stop weighing and the scale shall be recertified at
 the Contractor’s expense. If the weight difference of both comparison checks exceed
 the 0.5 percent limit and the scale is underweighing, it shall be adjusted immediately.
 Contractor will not be compensated for any loss from underweighing.
 Belt Scales – To test the accuracy of a belt-conveyor scale, the Contractor shall weigh five
 or more payloads from sequential hauling units and compare these weights with weights of
 the same payloads taken on a separate certified platform scale. If the test results fluctuate, the
 Engineer may require more than five check loads. Conveyor weights will be based on tonnage
 values taken from the sealed odometer at the beginning and end of each check period.
 If scale verification checks shows the scale has been under weighing, it shall be adjusted
 immediately. The Contractor shall not be compensated for any loss from under weighing.
 If scale verification checks show the scale has been overweighing, its operation will cease
 immediately until adjusted.
 Minor Construction Items – If the Specifications and Plans require weight measurement
 for minor construction items, the Contractor may request permission to convert volume to
 weight. If the Engineer approves, an agreed factor may be used to make this conversion and
 volume may be used to calculate the corresponding weight for payment.

 1-09.2(6)  Payment
 Unless specified otherwise, the Contracting Agency will pay for no materials received by
 weight unless they have been weighed as required in this section or as required by another
 method the Engineer has approved in writing.
 The Contractor shall not be compensated for any loss from underweighing that is revealed
 by scale verification checks.
 If scale verification checks reveal that the scale is overweighing, then payment for all
 material weighed since the last valid scale verification check will be adjusted. The Contracting
 Agency will calculate the combined weight of all materials weighed after the last verification
 check showing accurate results. This combined weight will then be reduced for payment by
 the percentage of scale error that exceeds 0.5 percent unless the Contractor demonstrates to
 the satisfaction of the Engineer that the defect in the scale was present for a lesser period
 of time.
 Unit Contract prices for the various pay items of the project cover all costs related to
 weighing and proportioning materials for payment. These costs include but are not limited to:
 1.	 Furnishing, installing, certifying, and maintaining scales;
 2.	 Providing a weigher to operate a Contractor-provided scale;
 3.	 Providing a weigher to operate a commercial scale, if necessary;
 4.	 Providing self-printing tickets, if necessary;
 5.	 Rerouting a truck for verification weighing;
 6.	 Assisting the Engineer with scale verification checks;
 7.	 Any other related costs associated with meeting the requirements of this section.
 1-09.3  Scope of Payment
 The payment provided for in the Contract shall be full payment to the Contractor for:
 1.	 Furnishing all materials and performing all Work under the Contract (including changes
 in the work, materials, or Plans) in a complete and acceptable manner;
 2.	 All risk, loss, damage, or expense of whatever character arising out of the nature or
 prosecution of the work; and
 3.	 All expense incurred resulting from a suspension or discontinuance of the Work as
 specified under the Contract.
 The payment of any estimate or retained percentage shall not relieve the Contractor of the
 obligation to make good any defective Work or materials.
 Unless the Plans and Special Provisions provide otherwise, the unit Contract prices for the
 various Bids items shall be full payment for all labor, materials, supplies, equipment, tools,
 and all other things required to completely incorporate the item into the Work as though the
 item were to read “In Place”.
 If the “Payment” clause in the Specifications, for an item included in the Proposal, covers
 and considers all Work and material essential to that item, then the Work or materials will not
 be measured or paid for under any other item that may appear elsewhere in the Proposal or
 Specifications.
 Certain payment items appearing in these Specifications may be modified in the Plans and
 Proposal to include:
 1.	 The words “For Structure”, “For Concrete Barrier”, “For Bridge”, etc., with the intent
 of clarifying specific use of the item; or
 2.	 The words “Site (Site Designation)”, with the intent of clarifying where a specific item
 of Work is to be performed.
 Modification of payment items in this manner shall in no way change the intent of the
 Specifications relating to these items.

 1-09.4  Equitable Adjustment
 The equitable adjustment provided for elsewhere in the Contract shall be determined in
 one or more of the following ways:
 1.	 If the parties are able to agree, the price will be determined by using:
 a.	 Unit prices; or
 b.	 Other agreed upon prices;
 2.	 If the parties cannot agree, the price will be determined by the Engineer using:
 a.	 Unit prices; or
 b.	 Other means to establish costs.
 The following limitations shall apply in determining the amount of the equitable
 adjustment:
 1.	 The equipment rates shall be actual cost but shall not exceed the rates set forth in
 the AGC/WSDOT Equipment Rental Agreement in effect at the time the Work is
 performed as referred to in Section 1-09.6, and
 2.	 To the extent any delay or failure of performance was concurrently caused by the
 Contracting Agency and the Contractor, the Contractor shall be entitled to a time
 extension for the portion of the delay or failure of performance concurrently caused,
 provided it make such a request pursuant to Section 1-08.8; however, the Contractor
 shall not be entitled to any adjustment in Contract price.
 3.	 No claim for anticipated profits on deleted, terminated, or uncompleted Work will
 be allowed.
 4.	 No claim for consequential damages of any kind will be allowed.
 1-09.5  Deleted or Terminated Work
 The Engineer may delete Work by change order as provided in Section 1-04.4 or may
 terminate the Contract in whole or part as provided in Section 1-08.10(2). When the Contract
 is terminated in part, the partial termination shall be treated as a deletion change order for
 payment purposes under this section.
 Payment for completed items will be at unit Contract prices.
 When any item is deleted in whole or in part by change order or when the Contract is
 terminated in whole or in part, payment for deleted or terminated Work will be made as follows:
 1.	 Payment will be made for the actual number of units of Work completed at the unit
 Contract prices unless the Engineer determines the unit prices are inappropriate for
 the Work actually performed. When that determination is made by the Engineer,
 payment for Work performed will be as mutually agreed. If the parties cannot agree
 the Engineer will determine the amount of the equitable adjustment in accordance
 with Section 1-09.4;
 2.	 Payment for partially completed lump sum items will be as mutually agreed. If the
 parties cannot agree, the Engineer will determine the amount of the equitable
 adjustment in accordance with Section 1-09.4;
 3.	 To the extent not paid for by the Contract prices for the completed units of Work,
 the Contracting Agency will pay as part of the equitable adjustment those direct costs
 necessarily and actually incurred by the Contractor in anticipation of performing the
 Work that has been deleted or terminated;
 4.	 The total payment for any one item in the case of a deletion or partial termination shall
 not exceed the Bid price as modified by approved change orders less the estimated cost
 (including overhead and profit) to complete the Work and less any amount paid to the
 Contractor for the item;
 5.	 The total payment where the Contract is terminated in its entirety shall not exceed the
 total Contract price as modified by approved change orders less those amounts paid to
 the Contractor before the effective date of the termination; and
 Page 1-92
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Measurement and Payment
 
 1-09
 
 6.	 No claim for damages of any kind or for loss of anticipated profits on deleted or
 terminated Work will be allowed because of the termination or change order.
 Contract time shall be adjusted as the parties agree. If the parties cannot agree, the
 Engineer will determine the equitable adjustment for Contract time.
 Acceptable materials ordered by the Contractor prior to the date the Work was terminated
 as provided in Section 1-08.10(2) or deleted as provided in Section 1-04.4 by the Engineer,
 will either be purchased from the Contractor by the Contracting Agency at the actual cost
 and shall become the property of the Contracting Agency, or the Contracting Agency will
 reimburse the Contractor for the actual costs connected with returning these materials
 to the suppliers.
 1-09.6  Force Account
 The terms of the Contract or of a change order may call for Work or material to
 be paid for by force account. If so, then the objective of this Specification is to reimburse
 the Contractor for all costs associated with the Work, including costs of labor, small tools,
 supplies, equipment, specialized services, materials, applicable taxes and overhead and
 to include a profit commensurate with those costs. The amount to be paid shall be determined
 as described in this section.
 1.	 For Labor – Labor reimbursement calculations shall be based on a “Project Labor
 List” (List) prepared and submitted by the Contractor and by any Subcontractor before
 that firm commences force account Work. Once a List is approved by the Engineer,
 it shall be used to calculate force account labor payment until a new List is submitted
 and approved. The Engineer may compare the List to payrolls and other documents
 and may, at any time, require the Contractor to submit a new List. The Contractor may
 submit a new List at any time without such a requirement. Prior payment calculations
 shall not be adjusted as a result of a new List.
 	 To be approved, the List must be accurate and meet the requirements of this
 section. It shall include regular time and overtime rates for all employees (or work
 classifications) expected to participate in force account Work. The rates shall include
 the basic wage and fringe benefits, the current rates for Federal Insurance Compensation
 Act (FICA), Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and State Unemployment Tax
 Act (SUTA), the company’s present rates for Medical Aid and Industrial Insurance
 premiums and the planned payments for travel and per diem compensation.
 	 In the event that an acceptable initial List or requested revised List is not received
 by the time that force account calculations are begun, the Engineer will develop a List
 unilaterally, utilizing the best data available, that will be used until a Contractor’s List
 is received and approved. Again, prior calculations, prepared using the Engineer’s List,
 will not be revised as a result of differences with the Contractor’s List.
 	 In addition to compensation for direct labor costs defined above, the Contracting
 Agency will pay Contractor 29 percent of the sum of the costs calculated for labor
 reimbursement to cover project overhead, general company overhead, profit, bonding,
 insurance required by Sections 1-07.10 and 1-07.18, Business & Occupation tax,
 and any other costs incurred. This amount will include any costs of safety training
 and health tests, but will not include such costs for unique force account Work that is
 different from typical Work and which could not have been anticipated at time of Bid.
 2.	 For Materials – The Contracting Agency will reimburse invoice cost for Contractorsupplied materials. For the purpose of this provision, “Materials” shall include those
 items incorporated into the Work, supplies used during the Work and items consumed.
 This cost shall include freight and handling charges and applicable taxes. Before Work
 is started, the Engineer may require the Contractor to obtain multiple quotations for the
 materials to be utilized and select the vendor with prices and terms most advantageous
 to the Contracting Agency.
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 Measurement and Payment
 
 	
 
 The Contracting Agency will provide a list of the types and quantities of Contractorsupplied materials witnessed by the Contracting Agency as being utilized in force
 account Work. The list will be furnished promptly after the material is incorporated,
 on a daily basis unless agreed otherwise. The Contractor may propose corrections to
 the list and will supply prices for the materials and other costs and return the list to the
 Contracting Agency. To support the prices, the Contractor shall attach valid copies of
 vendor invoices. If invoices are not available for materials from the Contractor’s stocks,
 the Contractor shall certify actual costs (at a reasonable level) by affidavit. The Engineer
 will review the prices and any Contractor-proposed corrections and, if reasonable,
 approve the completed list. Once approved, the prices will be utilized in the calculation
 of force account reimbursement for materials.
 	 If, in the case of non-invoiced materials supported by Contractor affidavit, the price
 appears to be unreasonable, the Engineer will determine the cost for all or part of
 those materials, utilizing the best data available.
 	 The Contracting Agency reserves the right to provide materials. In this case, the
 Contractor will receive no payment for any costs, overhead, or profit arising from
 the value of the materials themselves. Additional costs to handle and place the
 Agency‑furnished material shall be compensated as described in this Specification.
 	 In addition to compensation for direct materials cost, the Contracting Agency
 will pay the Contractor 21 percent of the sum of the costs calculated for materials
 reimbursement to cover project overhead, general company overhead, profit, bonding,
 insurance, required by Sections 1-07.10 and 1-07.18, Business & Occupation tax, and
 any other costs incurred.
 3.	 For Equipment – The Contracting Agency will reimburse the Contractor for the cost
 of equipment utilized in the Work. The equipment provided by the Contractor shall be
 of modern design and in good working condition. For the purpose of this provision,
 “provided” shall mean that the equipment is owned (either through outright ownership
 or through a long-term lease) and operated by the Contractor or Subcontractor or that
 the equipment is rented and operated by the Contractor or Subcontractor. Equipment
 that is rented with operator shall not be included here, but shall be considered a service
 and addressed according to Subsection 4 of this provision.
 	 The amount of payment for any Contractor-owned equipment that is utilized shall be
 determined according to the version of the AGC/WSDOT Equipment Rental Agreement
 which is in effect at the time the force account is authorized. The rates listed in the
 Rental Rate Blue Book (as modified by the current AGC/WSDOT Equipment Rental
 Agreement) shall be full compensation for all fuel, oil, lubrication, ordinary repairs,
 maintenance, and all other costs incidental to furnishing and operating the equipment
 except labor for operation.
 	 Payment for rented equipment will be made on the basis of a valid invoice, covering
 the time period of the Work. Before Work is started, the Engineer may require the
 Contractor to obtain multiple quotations for the rental of equipment to be utilized
 and select the vendor with prices and terms most advantageous to the Contracting
 Agency. In the event that prior quotations are not obtained and the vendor is not a firm
 independent from the Contractor or Subcontractor, then after-the-fact quotations may
 be obtained by the Engineer from the open market in the vicinity and the lowest such
 quotation may be used in place of submitted invoice.
 	 In addition to the payments for Contractor-owned and rented equipment, one or more
 lump-sum payments may be made for small tools. The amount to be paid shall be
 determined as outlined in the AGC/WSDOT Equipment Rental Agreement.
 	 The Contracting Agency will add 21 percent to equipment costs to cover project
 overhead, general company overhead, profit, bonding, insurance, required by Sections
 1-07.10 and 1-07.18, Business & Occupation tax, and any other costs incurred.

 This markup will be over and above those equipment costs and will not be adjusted for
 any equipment overhead amounts included in the Blue Book rates.
 	 Copies of the AGC/WSDOT Equipment Rental Agreement will be maintained on the
 Contracting Agency’s website at www.wsdot.wa.gov.
 4.	 For Services – Compensation under force account for specialized services shall be
 made on the basis of an invoice from the providing entity. A “specialized service”
 is a work operation that is not typically done by worker classifications as defined by
 the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries and by the Davis Bacon Act,
 and therefore bills by invoice for work in road, bridge and municipal construction.
 Before Work is started, the Engineer may require the Contractor to obtain multiple
 quotations for the service to be utilized and select the provider with prices and terms
 most advantageous to the Contracting Agency. In the event that prior quotations are
 not obtained and the service invoice is submitted by a Subcontractor, then after-the-fact
 quotations may be obtained by the Engineer from the open market in the vicinity and
 the lowest such quotation may be used in place of the submitted invoice.
 	 Except as noted below, the Contracting Agency will pay the Contractor an additional
 21 percent of the sum of the costs included on invoices for specialized services to cover
 project overhead, general company overhead, profit, bonding, insurance, required by
 Sections 1-07.10 and 1-07.18, Business & Occupation tax, and any other costs incurred.
 	 When a supplier of services is compensated through invoice, but acts in the
 manner of a Subcontractor, as described in Subsection 6 of this provision, then
 markup for that invoice shall be according to Subsection 6, “Contractor Markup on
 Subcontractors’ Work”.
 5.	 For Mobilization – Force account mobilization is defined as the preparatory Work
 performed by the Contractor including procurement, loading and transportation of
 tools and equipment, and personal travel time (when such travel time is a contractual
 obligation of the Contractor or a customary payment for the Contractor to all
 employees). Mobilization also includes the costs incurred during demobilization.
 Pro‑rata adjustments may be made when the mobilization applies to both force account
 and other Contract Work. The Contracting Agency will pay for mobilization for offsite preparatory Work for force account items provided that notice has been provided
 sufficiently in advance to allow the Engineer to witness the activity, if desired.
 	 Any costs experienced during mobilization activities for labor, equipment, materials
 or services shall be listed in those sections of the force account summary and
 paid accordingly.
 6.	 For Contractor Markup on Subcontractor’s Work – When Work is performed
 on a force account basis by one or more approved Subcontractors, by lower-tier
 subcontractors or suppliers, or through invoice by firm(s) acting in the manner of a
 Subcontractor, the Contractor will be allowed an additional markup, from the table
 below, applied to the costs computed for Work done by each Subcontractor through
 Subsections 1, 2, 3, and 4, to compensate for all administrative costs, including project
 overhead, general company overhead, profit, bonding, insurance required by Sections
 1-07.10 and 1-07.18, Business & Occupation tax, and any other costs incurred.
 	 A firm may be considered to be acting as a Subcontractor when the Engineer observes
 one or more of the following characteristics:
 a.	 The person in charge of the firm’s activities takes an active role in managing
 the overall project, including extensive coordination, interpretation of Plans,
 interaction with the Contracting Agency or management of a complex and
 interrelated operation.
 b.	 Rented equipment is provided fueled, operated and maintained by the firm.
 Operators of rented equipment are supervised directly by the firm’s representative.
 There is little interaction between the Contractor and the employees of the firm.
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 Measurement and Payment
 
 c.	 The firm appears to be holding the risk of performance and quality of the Work.
 d.	 The firm appears to be responsible for liability arising from the Work.
 	 Markups on Work Performed by Subcontractor(s):
 (1)	On amounts paid for Work performed by each Subcontractor
 on each force account and calculated through
 Subsections 1-4,	
 up to $25,000	
 12 percent
 (2)	On amounts greater than	
 $25,000 up to $100,000	 10 percent
 (3)	On amounts greater than	
 $100,000	
 7 percent
 	 The amounts and markup rates shall be calculated separately for each Subcontractor
 on each force account item established.
 The payments provided above shall be full payment for all Work done on a force account
 basis. The calculated payment shall cover all expenses of every nature, kind, and description,
 including those listed above and any others incurred on the Work being paid through force
 account. Nothing in this provision shall preclude the Contractor from seeking an extension
 of time or time-related damages to unchanged Work arising as a result of the force account
 Work. The amount and costs of any Work to be paid by force account shall be computed by
 the Engineer, and the result shall be final as provided in Section 1-05.1.
 An item that has been Bid at a unit price or lump sum in the Proposal will not be paid as
 force account unless a change as defined in Section 1-04.4 has occurred and the provisions
 require a payment adjustment. Items which are included in the Proposal as Force Account or
 which are added by change order as Force Account may, by agreement of the parties at any
 time, be converted to agreed unit prices or lump sums applicable to the remaining Work.
 1-09.7  Mobilization
 Mobilization consists of preconstruction expenses and the costs of preparatory Work and
 operations performed by the Contractor which occur before 10 percent of the total original
 Contract amount is earned from other Contract items. Items which are not to be included in
 the item of Mobilization include but are not limited to:
 1.	 Any portion of the Work covered by the specific Contract item or incidental Work
 which is to be included in a Contract item or items.
 2.	 Profit, interest on borrowed money, overhead, or management costs.
 3.	 Any costs of mobilizing equipment for force account Work.
 Based on the lump sum Contract price for “Mobilization”, partial payments will be made
 as follows:
 1.	 When 5 percent of the total original Contract amount is earned from other Contract
 items, excluding amounts paid for materials on hand, 50 percent of the amount Bid for
 mobilization, or 5 percent of the total original Contract amount, whichever is the least,
 will be paid.
 2.	 When 10 percent of the total original Contract amount is earned from other Contract
 items, excluding amounts paid for materials on hand, 100 percent of the amount Bid for
 mobilization, or 10 percent of the total original Contract amount, whichever is the least,
 will be paid.
 3.	 When the Substantial Completion Date has been established for the project, payment of
 any amount Bid for mobilization in excess of 10 percent of the total original Contract
 amount will be paid.
 Nothing herein shall be construed to limit or preclude partial payments otherwise provided
 by the Contract.

 1-09.8  Payment for Material on Hand
 The Contracting Agency may reimburse the Contractor for materials purchased before their
 use in the Work if they:
 1.	 Meet the requirements of the Plans and Specifications;
 2.	 Are delivered to or stockpiled near the project or other Engineer-approved storage
 sites; and
 3.	 Consist of: sand, gravel, surfacing materials, aggregates, reinforcing steel, bronze
 plates, structural steel, machinery, piling, timber and lumber (not including forms or
 falsework), large signs unique to the project, prestressed concrete beams or girders,
 or other materials the Engineer may approve.
 The Contracting Agency may reimburse the Contractor for traffic signal controllers
 as follows:
 1.	 Fifty percent when the traffic signal controller and all components are received and
 assembled into a complete unit at the State Materials Laboratory.
 2.	 One hundred percent when the traffic signal controller is approved for shipment to
 the project by the State Materials Laboratory.
 The Contractor shall provide sufficient written evidence of production costs to enable
 the Engineer to compute the cost of Contractor-produced materials (such as sand, gravel,
 surfacing material, or aggregates). For other materials, the Contractor shall provide invoices
 from material suppliers. Each invoice shall be detailed sufficiently to enable the Engineer to
 determine the actual costs. Payment for materials on hand shall not exceed the total Contract
 cost for the Contract item.
 If payment is based upon an unpaid invoice, the Contractor shall provide the Engineer
 with a paid invoice within 60 calendar days after the Contracting Agency’s initial payment
 for materials on hand. If the paid invoice is not furnished in this time, any payment the
 Contracting Agency had made will be deducted from the next progress estimate and withheld
 until the paid invoice is supplied.
 The Contracting Agency will not pay for material on hand when the invoice cost is less
 than $2,000. As materials are used in the Work, credits equaling the partial payments for them
 will be taken on future estimates. Partial payment for materials on hand shall not constitute
 acceptance. Any material will be rejected if found to be faulty even if partial payment for it
 has been made.
 1-09.9  Payments
 The basis of payment will be the actual quantities of Work performed according to the
 Contract and as specified for payment.
 The Contractor shall submit a breakdown of the cost of lump sum Items to enable the
 Engineer to determine the Work performed on a monthly basis. Lump sum item breakdowns
 shall be submitted prior to the first progress payment that includes payment for the Bid Item in
 question. A breakdown is not required for lump sum Items that include a basis for incremental
 payments as part of the respective Specification. Absent a lump sum breakdown, the Engineer
 will make a determination based on information available. The Engineer’s determination of
 the cost of Work shall be final.
 Payments will be made for Work and labor performed and materials furnished under the
 Contract according to the price in the Proposal unless otherwise provided.
 Partial payments will be made once each month, based upon partial estimates prepared by
 the Engineer. The determination of payments under the Contract will be final in accordance
 with Section 1-05.1. Unless otherwise provided, payments will be made from the Motor
 Vehicle Fund.
 Failure to perform any of the obligations under the Contract by the Contractor may be
 decreed by the Contracting Agency to be adequate reason for withholding any payments until
 compliance is achieved.

 Measurement and Payment
 
 Upon completion of all Work and after final inspection (Section 1-05.11), the amount
 due the Contractor under the Contract will be paid based upon the final estimate made by the
 Engineer and presentation of a Final Contract Voucher Certification signed by the Contractor.
 Such voucher shall be deemed a release of all claims of the Contractor unless a claim is
 filed in accordance with the requirements of Section 1-09.11 and is expressly excepted
 from the Contractor’s certification on the Final Contract Voucher Certification. The date the
 Secretary signs the Final Contract Voucher Certification constitutes the final acceptance date
 (Section 1-05.12).
 If the Contractor fails, refuses, or is unable to sign and return the Final Contract Voucher
 Certification or any other documentation required for completion and final acceptance of
 the Contract, the Contracting Agency reserves the right to establish a Completion Date
 (for the purpose of meeting the requirements of RCW 60.28) and unilaterally accept the
 Contract. Unilateral final acceptance will occur only after the Contractor has been provided
 the opportunity, by written request from the Engineer, to voluntarily submit such documents.
 If voluntary compliance is not achieved, formal notification of the impending establishment
 of a Completion Date and unilateral final acceptance will be provided by certified letter
 from the Secretary to the Contractor, which will provide 30 calendar days for the Contractor
 to submit the necessary documents. The 30 calendar day period will begin on the date the
 certified letter is received by the Contractor. The date the Secretary unilaterally signs the Final
 Contract Voucher Certification shall constitute the Completion Date and the final acceptance
 date (Section 1-05.12). The reservation by the Contracting Agency to unilaterally accept the
 Contract will apply to Contracts that are Physically Completed in accordance with Section
 1-08.5, or for Contracts that are terminated in accordance with Section 1-08.10. Unilateral
 final acceptance of the Contract by the Contracting Agency does not in any way relieve the
 Contractor of their responsibility to comply with all Federal, State, tribal, or local laws,
 ordinances, and regulations that affect the Work under the Contract.
 Payment to the Contractor of partial estimates, final estimates, and retained percentages
 shall be subject to controlling laws.
 1-09.9(1)  Retainage
 Pursuant to RCW 60.28, a sum of 5 percent of the monies earned by the Contractor will be
 retained from progress estimates. Such retainage shall be used as a trust fund for the protection
 and payment (1) to the State with respect to taxes imposed pursuant to Title 82 RCW, and
 (2) the claims of any person arising under the Contract.
 Monies retained under the provisions of RCW 60.28 shall, at the option of the Contractor, be:
 1.	 Retained in a fund by the Contracting Agency; or
 2.	 Deposited by the Contracting Agency in an escrow (interest-bearing) account in a bank,
 mutual saving bank, or savings and loan association (interest on monies so retained
 shall be paid to the Contractor). Deposits are to be in the name of the Contracting
 Agency and are not to be allowed to be withdrawn without the Contracting Agency’s
 written authorization. The Contracting Agency will issue a check representing the sum
 of the monies reserved, payable to the bank or trust company. Such check shall be
 converted into bonds and securities chosen by the Contractor as the interest accrues.
 At the time the Contract is executed the Contractor shall designate the option desired. The
 Contractor in choosing option (2) agrees to assume full responsibility to pay all costs that may
 accrue from escrow services, brokerage charges or both, and further agrees to assume all risks
 in connection with the investment of the retained percentages in securities. The Contracting
 Agency may also, at its option, accept a bond in lieu of retainage.
 Release of the retainage will be made 60 days following the Completion Date (pursuant to
 RCW 39.12, and RCW 60.28) provided the following conditions are met:
 1.	 On Contracts totaling more than $35,000, a release has been obtained from the
 Washington State Department of Revenue.
 2.	 Affidavits of Wages Paid for the Contractor and all Subcontractors are on file with the
 Contracting Agency (RCW 39.12.040).

 3.	 A certificate of Payment of Contributions Penalties and Interest on Public Works
 Contract is received from the Washington State Employment Security Department.
 4.	 Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (in accordance with
 Section 1-07.10) shows the Contractor is current with payments of industrial insurance
 and medical aid premiums.
 5.	 All claims, as provided by law, filed against the retainage have been resolved. In
 the event claims are filed and provided the conditions of 1, 2, 3, and 4 are met, the
 Contractor will be paid such retained percentage less an amount sufficient to pay any
 such claims together with a sum determined by the Contracting Agency sufficient to
 pay the cost of foreclosing on claims and to cover attorney’s fees.
 1-09.10 Payment for Surplus Processed Materials
 After the Contract is completed, the Contractor will be reimbursed actual production costs
 for surplus processed material produced by the Contractor from Contracting Agency-provided
 sources if its value is $3,000 or more (determined by actual production costs).
 The quantity of surplus material eligible for reimbursement of production costs shall be the
 quantity produced (but an amount not greater than 110 percent of Plan quantity or as specified
 by the Engineer), less the actual quantity used. The Contracting Agency will determine the
 actual amount of surplus material for reimbursement.
 The Contractor shall not dispose of any surplus material without permission of the
 Engineer. Surplus material shall remain the property of the Contracting Agency without
 reimbursement to the Contractor if it is not eligible for reimbursement.
 1-09.11  Disputes and Claims
 When protests occur during a Contract, the Contractor shall pursue resolution through the
 Engineer. The Contractor shall follow the procedures outlined in Section 1-04.5.
 If the negotiations using the procedures outlined in Section 1-04.5 fail to provide
 satisfactory resolution of protests, then the Contractor shall provide the Engineer with written
 notification that the Contractor will continue to pursue the dispute in accordance with the
 provisions of Section 1-09.11. The written notification shall be provided within 7 calendar
 days after receipt of the Engineer’s written determination that the Contractor’s protest is
 invalid pursuant to Section 1-04.5. The Contractor’s written notice of dispute shall indicate
 whether the Contractor prefers to resolve the dispute through the use of a Disputes Review
 Board as outlined in Section 1-09.11(1), or to submit a formal claim directly to the Contracting
 Agency pursuant to Section 1-09.11(2).
 If a Disputes Review Board is requested by the Contractor, the Contracting Agency will
 notify the Contractor in writing whether the use of a Disputes Review Board is agreed upon
 within 7 calendar days after receiving the Contractors written notice of dispute. If both parties
 to the dispute agree, then the dispute will be referred to a Disputes Review Board according
 to Section 1-09.11(1). If the parties do not mutually agree to establish a Disputes Review
 Board then none shall be used, and the Contractors shall submit a formal claim directly to
 the Contracting Agency as outlined in Section 1-09.11(2), Claims.
 In spite of any protest or dispute, the Contractor shall proceed promptly with the Work
 as the Engineer orders.
 1-09.11(1)  Disputes Review Board
 In order to assist in the resolution of disputes arising out of the Work of this project, the
 Contract provides for the establishment of a Disputes Review Board, hereinafter called the
 “Board”. The Board is created when negotiations using the procedures outlined in Section
 1-04.5 fail to provide a satisfactory resolution and the Contracting Agency and Contractor
 mutually agree to use a Board as part of the disputes resolution process prior to the
 Contractor filing a formal claim pursuant to Section 1-09.11(2).
 The Board will consider disputes referred to it and furnish recommendations to the
 Contracting Agency and Contractor to assist in the resolution of the differences between
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 1-99
 
 1-09
 
 Measurement and Payment
 
 them. The purpose of the Board response to such issues is to provide nonbinding findings
 and recommendations designed to expose the disputing parties to an independent view of
 the dispute.
 The Board members will be especially knowledgeable in the type of construction involved
 in the Project and shall discharge their responsibilities impartially and independently
 considering the facts and conditions related to the matters under consideration and the
 provisions of the Contract.
 1-09.11(1)A  Disputes Review Board Membership
 The Board shall consist of one member selected by the Contracting Agency and one
 member selected by the Contractor, with these two members to select the third member.
 The first two members shall be mutually acceptable to both the Contracting Agency and the
 Contractor. If one or both of the two members selected are not acceptable to the Contracting
 Agency or Contractor, another selection shall be made.
 The Contracting Agency and Contractor shall each select their respective Board member
 and negotiate an agreement, separate and apart from this Contract, with their respective Board
 member within 14 calendar days after the parties have agreed to establish a Board, as outlined
 in Section 1-09.11(1).
 The agreements with these two Board members shall contain language imposing the
 “Scope of Work” and “Suggested Administrative Procedures” for Disputes Review Boards
 available at www.wsdot.wa.gov/business/consulting. These negotiated agreements shall also
 include clauses that require the respective selected members to immediately pursue selection
 of a third member. The goal is to obtain a third Board member who will complement the first
 two by furnishing a needed expertise, which will facilitate the Board’s operations.
 In case a member of the Board needs to be replaced, the replacement member will be
 appointed in the same manner as the replaced member was appointed. The appointment
 of a replacement Board member will begin promptly upon determination of the need for
 replacement and shall be completed within 30 calendar days.
 Service of a Board member may be terminated at any time with not less than 30 calendar
 days notice as follows:
 1.	 The Contracting Agency may terminate service of the Contracting Agency
 appointed member.
 2.	 The Contractor may terminate service of the Contractor appointed member.
 3.	 The third member’s services may be terminated by agreement of the other two members.
 4.	 By resignation of the member.
 Termination of a member will be followed by appointment of a substitute as
 specified above.
 No member shall have a financial interest in the Contract, except for payments for services
 on the Board. The Contracting Agency-selected member and the Contractor-selected member
 shall not have been employed by the party who selected them within a period of 1 year;
 except that, service as a member of other Disputes Review Boards on other contracts will not
 preclude a member from serving on the Board for this Contract.
 Compensation for the Board members, and the expenses of operation of the Board, shall
 be shared by the Contracting Agency and Contractor in accordance with the following:
 1.	 The Contracting Agency will compensate directly the wages and travel expense for
 its selected member.
 2.	 The Contractor shall compensate directly the wages and travel expense for its
 selected member.
 3.	 The Contracting Agency and Contractor shall share equally in the third member’s
 wages and travel expense, and all of the operating expenses of the Board. These equally
 shared expenses shall be billed to and paid by the Contracting Agency. The Contractor’s
 share will be deducted from monies due or coming due the Contractor.

 4.	 The Contracting Agency, through the Engineer, will provide administrative services,
 such as conference facilities and secretarial services, to the Board and the Contracting
 Agency will bear the costs for this service.
 The Contracting Agency and Contractor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Board
 Members from and against all claims, damages, losses, and expenses, including but not limited
 to, attorney’s fees arising out of and resulting from the actions and recommendations of
 the Board.
 1-09.11(1)B  Disputes Review Board Procedures
 The Board, the Contracting Agency, and the Contractor shall develop by agreement the
 Board’s rules of operation and procedures to be followed for the Project. In developing the
 agreement, the parties shall take into consideration their respective duties and responsibilities
 set forth in the “Scope of Work” section of their agreements.
 The parties may also consider the “Suggested Administrative Procedures” for the Board’s
 operation included in their agreements. These Procedures express, in general terms, the policy
 for the creation and operation of the Board.
 No dispute shall be referred to the Board unless the Contractor has complied with the
 requirements of Sections 1-04.5 and 1-09.11 and the parties have mutually agreed to refer the
 dispute to the Board in an attempt to resolve the dispute prior to the Contractor filing a claim
 according to Section 1-09.11(2). If the dispute is referred to the Board, then the Board will
 consider the matter in dispute and provide recommendations concerning:
 1.	 The interpretation of the Contract.
 2.	 Entitlement to additional compensation or time for performance.
 3.	 The amount of additional compensation or time for performance following a
 recommendation of entitlement by the Board provided that; (1) the parties were not
 able to reach a resolution as to the amount of the equitable adjustment or time; (2) the
 Engineer has made a unilateral determination of the amount of compensation for time;
 and (3) the Contractor has protested the Engineer’s unilateral determination.
 4.	 Other subjects mutually agreed by the Contracting Agency and Contractor to be
 a Board issue.
 Once the Board is established, the dispute resolution process shall be as follows:
 1.	 Board hearing dates will be scheduled by agreement of the parties.
 2.	 The Contractor and the Contracting Agency shall each be afforded an opportunity
 to be heard by the Board and to offer evidence. Either party furnishing any written
 evidence or documentation to the Board must furnish copies of such information to the
 other party a minimum of 15 calendar days prior to the date the Board sets to convene
 the hearing for the dispute. Either party shall produce such additional evidence as the
 Board may deem necessary to an understanding and determination of the dispute and
 furnish copies to the other party.
 3.	 After the hearing is concluded, the Board shall meet in private and reach a conclusion
 supported by two or more members. Its findings and recommendations, together with its
 reasons shall then be submitted as a written report to both parties. The recommendations
 shall be based on the pertinent Contract Provisions and facts and circumstances
 involved in the dispute. The Contract shall be interpreted and construed in accordance
 with the laws of the State of Washington. The Board shall make every effort to reach
 a unanimous decision. If this proves impossible, the dissenting member may prepare
 a minority report.
 4.	 Within 30 calendar days of receiving the Board recommendations, both the Contracting
 Agency and the Contractor shall respond to the other in writing signifying that the
 dispute is either resolved or remains unresolved. Although both parties should place
 weight upon the Board recommendations, the recommendations are not binding.
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 1-09
 
 Measurement and Payment
 
 In the event the Board’s recommendations do not lead to resolution of the dispute,
 all Board records and written recommendations, including any minority reports, will be
 admissible as evidence in any subsequent litigation.
 If the Board’s assistance does not resolve the dispute, the Contractor must file a claim
 according to Section 1-09.11(2) before seeking any form of judicial relief.
 1-09.11(2)  Claims
 If the Contractor claims that additional payment is due and the Contractor has pursued
 and exhausted all the means provided in Sections 1-04.5 and 1-09.11(1) to resolve a dispute,
 including the use of a Disputes Review Board if one was established, the Contractor may file
 a claim as provided in this section. The Contractor agrees to waive any claim for additional
 payment if the written notifications provided in Section 1-04.5 are not given, or if the Engineer
 is not afforded reasonable access by the Contractor to complete records of actual cost and
 additional time incurred as required by Section 1-04.5, or if a claim is not filed as provided
 in this section. The fact that the Contractor has provided a proper notification, provided a
 properly filed claim, or provided the Engineer access to records of actual cost, shall not in
 any way be construed as proving or substantiating the validity of the claim. If the claim, after
 consideration by the Engineer, is found to have merit, the Engineer will make an equitable
 adjustment either in the amount of costs to be paid or in the time required for the Work,
 or both. If the Engineer finds the claim to be without merit, no adjustment will be made.
 All claims filed by the Contractor shall be in writing and in sufficient detail to enable the
 Engineer to ascertain the basis and amount of the claim. All claims shall be submitted to the
 Engineer as provided in Section 1-05.15. As a minimum, the following information must
 accompany each claim submitted:
 1.	 A detailed factual statement of the claim for additional compensation and time, if any,
 providing all necessary dates, locations, and items of Work affected by the claim.
 2.	 The date on which facts arose which gave rise to the claim.
 3.	 The name of each Contracting Agency individual, official, or employee involved
 in or knowledgeable about the claim.
 4.	 The specific provisions of the Contract which support the claim and a statement
 of the reasons why such provisions support the claim.
 5.	 If the claim relates to a decision of the Engineer which the Contract leaves to the
 Engineer’s discretion or as to which the Contract provides that the Engineer’s decision
 is final, the Contractor shall set out in detail all facts supporting its position relating
 to the decision of the Engineer.
 6.	 The identification of any documents and the substance of any oral communications
 that support the claim.
 7.	 Copies of any identified documents, other than Contracting Agency documents and
 documents previously furnished to the Contracting Agency by the Contractor, that
 support the claim (manuals which are standard to the industry, used by the Contractor,
 may be included by reference).
 8.	 If an extension of time is sought:
 a.	 The specific days and dates for which it is sought,
 b.	 The specific reasons the Contractor believes a time extension should be granted,
 c.	 The specific provisions of Section 1-08.8 under which it is sought, and
 d.	 The Contractor’s analysis of its progress schedule to demonstrate the reason for
 a time extension.
 9.	 If additional compensation is sought, the exact amount sought and a breakdown of that
 amount into the following categories:
 a.	Labor;
 b.	Materials;
 Page 1-102
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Measurement and Payment

 c.	 Direct equipment. The actual cost for each piece of equipment for which a claim
 is made or in the absence of actual cost, the rates established by the AGC/WSDOT
 Equipment Rental Agreement which was in effect when the Work was performed.
 In no case shall the amounts claimed for each piece of equipment exceed the
 rates established by that Equipment Rental Agreement even if the actual cost for
 such equipment is higher. The Contracting Agency may audit the Contractor’s
 cost records as provided in Section 1-09.12 to determine actual equipment cost.
 The following information shall be provided for each piece of equipment:
 (1)	Detailed description (e.g., Motor Grader Diesel Powered Caterpillar 12 “G”,
 Tractor Crawler ROPS & Dozer Included Diesel);
 (2)	The hours of use or standby; and
 (3)	The specific day and dates of use or standby;
 d.	 Job overhead;
 e.	 Overhead (general and administrative);
 f.	 Subcontractor’s claims (in the same level of detail as specified herein is required
 for any Subcontractor’s claims); and
 g.	 Other categories as specified by the Contractor or the Contracting Agency.
 10.	A notarized statement shall be submitted to the Engineer containing the following
 language:
 	 Under the penalty of law for perjury or falsification, the undersigned,
 ____________________________, ______________________________
    (name)           (title)

 It will be the responsibility of the Contractor to keep full and complete records of the costs
 and additional time incurred for any alleged claim. The Contractor shall permit the Engineer
 to have access to those records and any other records as may be required by the Engineer to
 determine the facts or contentions involved in the claim. The Contractor shall retain those
 records for a period of not less than three years after final acceptance.
 The Contractor shall pursue administrative resolution of any claim with the Engineer or
 the designee of the Engineer.
 Failure to submit with the Final Contract Voucher Certification such information and
 details as described in this section for any claim shall operate as a waiver of the claims by the
 Contractor as provided in Section 1-09.9.

 Provided that the Contractor is in full compliance with all the provisions of this section and
 after the formal claim document has been submitted, the Contracting Agency will respond,
 in writing, to the Contractor as follows:
 1.	 Within 45 calendar days from the date the claim is received by the Contracting Agency
 if the claim amount is less than $100,000;
 2.	 Within 90 calendar days from the date the claim is received by the Contracting Agency
 if the claim amount is equal to or greater than $100,000; or
 3.	 If the above restraints are unreasonable due to the complexity of the claim under
 consideration, the Contractor will be notified within 15 calendar days from the date
 the claim is received by the Contracting Agency as to the amount of time which will
 be necessary for the Contracting Agency to prepare its response.
 Full compliance by the Contractor with the provisions of this section is a contractual
 condition precedent to the Contractor’s right to seek judicial relief.
 1-09.11(3)  Time Limitation and Jurisdiction
 For the convenience of the parties to the Contract it is mutually agreed by the parties
 that any claims or causes of action which the Contractor has against the State of Washington
 arising from the Contract shall be brought within 180 calendar days from the date of final
 acceptance (Section 1-05.12) of the Contract by the State of Washington; and it is further
 agreed that any such claims or causes of action shall be brought only in the Superior Court of
 Thurston County. The parties understand and agree that the Contractor’s failure to bring suit
 within the time period provided, shall be a complete bar to any such claims or causes of action.
 It is further mutually agreed by the parties that when any claims or causes of action which the
 Contractor asserts against the State of Washington arising from the Contract are filed with the
 State or initiated in court, the Contractor shall permit the State to have timely access to any
 records deemed necessary by the State to assist in evaluating the claims or action.
 1-09.12  Audits
 1-09.12(1) General
 The Contractor’s wage, payroll, and cost records on this Contract shall be open to
 inspection or audit by representatives of the Contracting Agency during the life of the Contract
 and for a period of not less than 3 years after the date of final acceptance of the Contract. The
 Contractor shall retain these records for that period. The Contractor shall also guarantee that
 the wage, payroll, and cost records of all Subcontractors and all lower tier Subcontractors
 shall be retained and open to similar inspection or audit for the same period of time. The audit
 may be performed by employees of the Contracting Agency or by an auditor under contract
 with the Contracting Agency. The Contractor, Subcontractors, or lower tier subcontractors
 shall provide adequate facilities, acceptable to the Engineer, for the audit during normal
 business hours. The Contractor, Subcontractors, or lower tier subcontractors shall make a
 good faith effort to cooperate with the auditors. If an audit is to be commenced more than
 60 calendar days after the final acceptance date of the Contract, the Contractor will be given
 20 calendar days notice of the time when the audit is to begin. If any litigation, claim, or audit
 arising out of, in connection with, or related to this Contract is initiated, the wage, payroll,
 and cost records shall be retained until such litigation, claim, or audit involving the records
 is completed.
 1-09.12(2)  Claims
 All claims filed against the Contracting Agency shall be subject to audit at any time
 following the filing of the claim. Failure of the Contractor, Subcontractors, or lower tier
 subcontractors to maintain and retain sufficient records to allow the auditors to verify all
 or a portion of the claim or to permit the auditor access to the books and records of the
 Contractor, Subcontractors, or lower tier subcontractors shall constitute a waiver of a claim
 and shall bar any recovery thereunder.

 The type of nonbinding ADR process shall be agreed upon by the parties and shall be
 conducted within the State of Washington at a location mutually acceptable to the parties.
 The Contractor agrees that the participation in a nonbinding ADR process does not in any
 way waive the requirement that binding arbitration or litigation proceedings must commence
 within 180 calendar days of final acceptance of the Contract, the same as any other claim or
 causes of action as provided in Section 1-09.11(3).
 1-09.13(3)  Claims $250,000 or Less
 The Contractor and the Contracting Agency mutually agree that those claims which

 disputes or through a mutually agreed upon nonbinding ADR process, the Contractor shall
 advise the Engineer, in writing, that mandatory and binding arbitration is desired. The parties
 may agree on an arbitration process, or, if the parties cannot agree a demand for arbitration
 shall be filed by the Contractor, in accordance with the AAA rules, with the Contracting

 Unresolved disputes which do not involve delays or impacts to unchanged Work may
 be brought to binding arbitration prior to Physical Completion of the project, provided that:
 1.	 All the administrative remedies provided for in the Contract have been exhausted;
 2.	 The dispute has been pursued to the claim status as provided in Section 1-09.11(2); and
 3.	 The Contractor certifies in writing that claims for delays or impacts to the Work will not
 result from the dispute.
 Unless the Contracting Agency and the Contractor agree otherwise, all other unresolved
 claims (disputes which have been pursued to the claim status) which arise from a Contract
 must be brought in a single arbitration hearing and only after Physical Completion of the
 Contract. The total of those unresolved claims cannot be greater than $250,000 to be eligible
 for arbitration.
 In addition, the Contractor agrees arbitration proceedings must commence, by filing of the
 aforementioned demand for arbitration, within 180 calendar days of final acceptance of the
 contract, the same as any other claim or causes of action as provided in Section 1-09.11(3).
 The scope and extent of discovery shall be determined by the arbitrator in accordance with
 AAA rules. In addition, each party for claims greater than $25,000 shall serve upon the other
 party a “statement of proof”. The statement of proof shall be served, with a copy to the AAA,
 no less than 20 calendar days prior to the arbitration hearing and shall include:
 1.	 The identity, current business address, and residential address of each witness who will
 testify at the hearing;
 2.	 The identity of a witness as an expert if an expert witness is to be called, a statement
 as to the subject matter and the substance of the facts and opinions on which the expert
 is expected to testify, a summary of the grounds for each opinion, and a resume of the
 expert’s qualifications; and
 3.	 A list of each document that the party intends to offer in evidence at the arbitration
 hearing. Either party may request from the other party a copy of any document listed.
 If such a request is made, a copy of the document shall be provided within 5 calendar
 days from the date the request is received.
 The arbitrator may permit a party to call a witness or offer a document not shown or
 included in the statement of proof only upon a showing of good cause.
 1-09.13(4)  Claims in Excess of $250,000
 The Contractor and the Contracting Agency mutually agree that those claims in excess
 of $250,000, submitted in accordance with Section 1-09.11 and not resolved by nonbinding
 ADR processes, shall be resolved through litigation unless the parties mutually agree to
 resolve the claim through binding arbitration.

 The Contractor shall provide flaggers and all other personnel required for labor
 for traffic control activities that are not otherwise specified as being furnished by the
 Contracting Agency.
 The Contractor shall perform all procedures necessary to support the Contract Work.
 Unless otherwise permitted by the Contract or approved by the Engineer, the Contractor
 shall keep all existing pedestrian routes and access points (including sidewalks, paths, and
 crosswalks) open and clear at all times.
 The Contractor shall keep lanes, on-ramps, and off-ramps, open to traffic at all times except
 when Work requires closures. Ramps shall not be closed on consecutive interchanges at the
 same time, unless approved by the Engineer. Lanes and ramps shall be closed for the minimum
 time required to complete the Work. When paving hot mix asphalt the Contractor may apply
 water to the pavement to shorten the time required before reopening to traffic.
 The Contractor shall provide signs and other traffic control devices not otherwise specified
 as being furnished by the Contracting Agency. The Contractor shall erect and maintain all
 construction signs, warning signs, detour signs, and other traffic control devices necessary to
 warn and protect the public at all times from injury or damage as a result of the Contractor’s

 Upon failure of the Contractor to immediately provide flaggers; erect, maintain, and
 remove signs; or provide, erect, maintain, and remove other traffic control devices when
 ordered to do so by the Engineer, the Contracting Agency may, without further notice to
 the Contractor or the Surety, perform any of the above and deduct all of the costs from the
 Contractor’s payments.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for providing adequate labor, sufficient signs, and other
 traffic control devices, and for performing traffic control procedures needed for the protection
 of the Work and the public at all times regardless of whether or not the labor, devices or
 procedures have been ordered by the Engineer, furnished by the Contracting Agency, or paid
 for by the Contracting Agency.
 Wherever possible when performing Contract Work, the Contractor’s equipment shall
 follow normal and legal traffic movements. The Contractor’s ingress and egress of the Work
 area shall be accomplished with as little disruption to traffic as possible. Traffic control devices
 shall be removed by picking up the devices in a reverse sequence to that used for installation.
 This may require moving backwards through the work zone. When located behind barrier or at
 other locations shown on approved traffic control plans, equipment may operate in a direction
 opposite to adjacent traffic.
 The Contractor is advised that the Contracting Agency may have entered into operating
 agreements with one or more law enforcement organizations for cooperative activities. Under
 such agreements, at the sole discretion of the Contracting Agency, law enforcement personnel
 may enter the work zone for enforcement purposes and may participate in the Contractor’s
 traffic control activities. The responsibility under the Contract for all traffic control resides
 with the Contractor and any such participation by law enforcement personnel in Contractor
 traffic control activities will be referenced in the Special Provisions or will be preceded by
 an agreement and, if appropriate, a cost adjustment. Nothing in this Contract is intended to
 create an entitlement, on the part of the Contractor, to the services or participation of the law
 enforcement organization.
 1-10.2  Traffic Control Management
 1-10.2(1) General
 It is the Contractor’s responsibility to plan, conduct, and safely perform the Work. The
 Contractor shall manage temporary traffic control with his or her own staff. Traffic control
 management responsibilities shall be formally assigned to one or more company supervisors
 who are actively involved in the planning and management of field Contract activities. The
 Contractor shall provide the Engineer with a copy of the formal assignment. The duties of
 traffic control management may not be subcontracted.
 The Contractor shall designate an individual or individuals to perform the duties of the
 primary Traffic Control Supervisor (TCS). The designation shall also identify an alternate
 TCS who can assume the duties of the primary TCS in the event of that person’s inability to
 perform. The TCS shall be responsible for safe implementation of approved Traffic Control
 Plans provided by the Contractor.
 The primary and alternate TCS shall be certified by one of the organizations listed in the
 Special Provisions. Possession of a current Washington State TCS card and flagging card by
 the primary and alternate TCS is mandatory. A traffic control management assignment and a
 TCS designation are required on all projects that will utilize traffic control.
 The Contractor shall maintain 24-hour telephone numbers at which the Contractor’s
 assigned traffic control management personnel and the TCS can be contacted and be available
 upon the Engineer’s request at other than normal working hours. These persons shall have
 the resources, ability and authority to expeditiously correct any deficiency in the traffic
 control system.

 1-10.3(1)B Other Traffic Control Labor and be compensated under those Bid items, provided
 that the duties of the TCS are accomplished.
 1-10.2(2)  Traffic Control Plans
 The traffic control plan or plans appearing in the Contract documents show a method
 of handling vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic. All construction signs, flaggers, and
 other traffic control devices are shown on the traffic control plan(s) except for emergency
 situations. If the Contractor proposes adding the use of flaggers to a plan, this will constitute a
 modification requiring approval by the Engineer. The modified plans shall show locations for
 all the required advance warning signs and a safe, protected location for the flagging station.
 If flagging is to be performed during hours of darkness, the plan shall include appropriate
 illumination for the flagging station.
 When the Contractor’s chosen method of performing the Work in the Contract requires
 some form of temporary traffic control, for vehicles, bicyclists, or pedestrians, the Contractor
 shall either: (1) submit a Type 1 Working Drawing designating and adopting, in writing,
 the traffic control plan or plans from the Contract documents that support that method; or
 (2) submit a Type 2 Working Drawing consisting of the Contractor’s plan that modifies,
 supplements or replaces a plan from the Contract documents. Any Contractor-proposed
 modification, supplement or replacement shall show the necessary construction signs, flaggers,
 and other traffic control devices required to support the Work. Any Contractor-proposed traffic
 control plan shall conform to the established standards for plan development as shown in the
 MUTCD, Part 6 and the most current edition of the PROWAG. The Contractor shall be solely
 responsible for submitting any proposed traffic control plan or modification, obtaining the
 Engineer’s acceptance and providing copies of the accepted Traffic Control Plans to the Traffic
 Control Supervisor.
 1-10.2(3)  Conformance to Established Standards
 Flagging, signs, and all other traffic control devices and procedures furnished or provided
 shall conform to the standards established in the latest WSDOT adopted edition of the
 MUTCD, published by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Washington State
 Modifications to the MUTCD, and the most current edition of the Public Rights-of-Way
 Accessibility Guidelines (PROWAG). Judgment of the quality of devices furnished will be
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 1-111
 
 1-10
 
 Temporary Traffic Control
 
 based upon Quality Guidelines for Temporary Traffic Control Devices, published by the
 American Traffic Safety Services Association. Copies of the MUTCD and Quality Guidelines
 for Temporary Control Devices may be purchased from the American Traffic Safety Services
 Association, 15 Riverside Parkway, Suite 100, Fredericksburg, VA 22406-1022. The
 Washington State Modifications to the MUTCD may be obtained from the Department of
 Transportation, Olympia, WA 98504. The most current edition of the Public Rights-of-Way
 Accessibility Guidelines (PROWAG) can be downloaded from the United States Access
 Board website at www.access-board.gov/prowac under Revised Draft Guidelines (2005).
 In addition to the standards of the MUTCD described above, the Contracting Agency has
 crashworthiness requirements for most work zone devices. The National Cooperative Highway
 Research Project (NCHRP) Report 350 and the AASHTO Manual for Assessing Safety
 Hardware (MASH) have established requirements for crash testing. Work zone devices are
 divided into four categories. Each of those categories is described below:
 Category 1 includes those items that are small and lightweight, channelizing, and
 delineating devices that have been in common use for many years and are known to be
 crashworthy by crash testing of similar devices or years of demonstrable safe performance.
 These include cones, tubular markers, flexible delineator posts, and plastic drums. All
 Category 1 devices used on the project shall meet the requirements of NCHRP 350 or MASH
 as certified by the manufacturer of the device.
 Category 2 includes devices that are not expected to produce significant vehicular velocity
 change, but may otherwise be hazardous. Examples of this class are barricades, portable
 sign supports and signs. All Category 2 devices shall meet the requirements of NCHRP 350
 or MASH. For the purpose of definition, a sign support and sign shall be considered a single
 unit. A new sign may be purchased for an existing sign support and the entire unit will be
 defined as “existing equipment”.
 Category 3 is for hardware expected to cause significant velocity changes or other
 potentially harmful reactions to impacting vehicles. Barriers, fixed sign supports, crash
 cushions, transportable attenuators and other work zone devices not meeting the definitions
 of Category 1 or 2 are examples from this category. Many Category 3 devices are defined in
 the design of the project. Where this is the case, NCHRP 350 or MASH requirements have
 been incorporated into the design and the Contractor complies with the requirements by
 constructing devices according to the Plans and Specifications. Where the device is a product
 chosen by the Contractor, the device chosen must be compliant with the requirements of
 NCHRP 350 or MASH.
 Category 4 includes portable or trailer-mounted devices such as arrow displays, temporary
 traffic signals, area lighting supports, and portable changeable message signs. Crash testing is
 not required for these devices.
 The condition of signs and traffic control devices shall be acceptable or marginal as defined
 in the book Quality Guidelines for Temporary Traffic Control Devices, and will be accepted
 based on a visual inspection by the Engineer. The Engineer’s decision on the condition of a
 sign or traffic control device shall be final. A sign or traffic control device determined to be
 unacceptable shall be removed from the project and replaced within 12 hours of notification.
 1-10.3  Traffic Control Labor, Procedures, and Devices
 1-10.3(1)  Traffic Control Labor
 The Contractor shall furnish all personnel for flagging, for the execution of all procedures
 related to temporary traffic control and for the setup, maintenance and removal of all
 temporary traffic control devices and construction signs necessary to control vehicular,
 bicycle, and pedestrian traffic during construction operations.
 Vests and other high-visibility apparel shall be in conformance with Section 1-07.8.

 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Temporary Traffic Control
 
 1-10
 
 1-10.3(1)A Flaggers
 Flaggers shall be posted where shown on approved Traffic Control Plans or where directed
 by the Engineer. All flaggers shall possess a current flagging card issued by the State of
 Washington, Oregon, Montana, or Idaho. The flagging card shall be immediately available and
 shown to the Contracting Agency upon request.
 Flagging stations shall be shown on Traffic Control Plans at locations where construction
 operations require stopping or diverting public traffic. Flagging stations shall be staffed only
 when flagging is required. This staffing may be continuous or intermittent, depending on
 the nature of the construction activity. Whenever a flagger is not required to stop or divert
 traffic, the flagger shall move away from the flagging station to a safer location. During hours
 of darkness, flagging stations shall be illuminated in a manner that insures that flaggers can
 easily be seen but that does not cause glare to the traveling public.
 Flagger station illumination shall meet the requirements of the MUTCD and
 these Specifications.
 The Contractor shall provide portable lighting equipment capable of sufficiently
 illuminating a flagger and their station without creating glare for oncoming motorists, yet
 will meet the mobility requirements of the operation. The lighting stations shall be located on
 the same side of the roadway as the flagger and aimed either parallel or perpendicular to the
 traveled lanes to minimize glare. The lighting devices shall be located 5 to 10 feet from the
 edge of the travel lane with a mounting height of 15 to 25 feet above the ground. The flagger
 should be visible and discernable as a flagger from a distance of 1,000 feet.
 Flaggers shall be equipped with portable two-way radios, with a range suitable for the
 project. The radios shall be capable of having direct contact with project management
 (foremen, superintendents, etc.).
 The Contractor shall furnish Stop/Slow paddles conforming to the requirements of
 Section 9-35.1 for all flagging operations.
 1-10.3(1)B  Other Traffic Control Labor
 In addition to flagging duties, the Contractor shall provide personnel for all other traffic
 control procedures required by the construction operations and for the labor to install, maintain
 and remove any traffic control devices shown on Traffic Control Plans.
 1-10.3(2)  Traffic Control Procedures
 1-10.3(2)A  One-Way Traffic Control
 The project Work may require that traffic be maintained on a portion of the Roadway
 during the progress of the Work using one-way traffic control. If this is the case, the
 Contractor’s operation shall be confined to one-half the Roadway, permitting traffic on the
 other half. If shown on an approved traffic control plan or directed by the Engineer, one-way
 traffic control, in accordance with the MUTCD, shall be provided and shall also conform to
 the following requirements:
 In any one-way traffic control configuration, side roads and approaches will be closed or
 controlled by a flagger or by appropriate approved signing. A side road flagger will coordinate
 with end flaggers where there is line of sight and with the pilot car where the end flaggers
 cannot be seen.
 Queues of vehicles will be allowed to take turns passing through the work zone in the single
 open lane. When one-way traffic control is in effect, Contractor vehicles shall not use the open
 traffic lane except while following the same rules and routes required of the public traffic.
 As conditions permit, the Contractor shall, at the end of each day, leave the Work area in
 such condition that it can be traveled without damage to the Work, without danger to traffic,
 and without one-way traffic control. If, in the opinion of the Engineer, one-way traffic control
 cannot be dispensed with after working hours, then the operation will be continued throughout
 the non-working hours.
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 1-10
 
 Temporary Traffic Control
 
 1-10.3(2)B  Rolling Slowdown
 Rolling slowdown traffic control operations are not to be used for routine Work that can
 be addressed by standard lane or shoulder closure traffic control. When a short-term roadway
 closure is needed for an infrequent, nonrepetitive Work operation such as a sign bridge
 removal or utility wire crossing, the Contractor may implement a rolling slowdown on a
 multilane roadway, as part of an accepted traffic control plan.
 The Contractor shall submit Type 2 Working Drawings consisting of a traffic control plan
 detailing the expected delay time, interchange ramp control, and rolling slowdown distance.
 A portable changeable message sign shall be placed ahead of the starting point of the traffic
 control to warn traffic of the slowdown. The sign shall be placed far enough ahead of the Work
 to avoid any expected backup of vehicles.
 A rolling slowdown shall use traffic control vehicles with flashing amber lights. At least
 one traffic control vehicle will be used for every two lanes to be slowed, plus a control vehicle
 will serve as a following (chase) vehicle for traffic ahead of the blockade. The traffic control
 vehicles shall enter the roadway and form a moving blockade to reduce traffic speeds and
 create a clear area ahead of the blockade in which to accomplish the Work without a total
 stoppage of traffic.
 The location where the traffic control vehicles shall begin the slowdown and the speed at
 which the moving blockade will be allowed to travel will be calculated to accommodate the
 estimated time needed for closure. The chase control vehicle shall follow the slowest vehicle
 ahead of the blockade. When the chase vehicle passes, the Contractor may begin the Work
 operation. In the event that the Work operation is not completed when the moving blockade
 reaches the site, all Work except that necessary to clear the Roadway shall cease immediately
 and the Roadway shall be cleared and reopened as soon as possible.
 All ramps and entrances to the Roadway between the moving blockade and Work operation
 shall be temporarily closed using flaggers. Radio communications between the Work operation
 and the moving blockade shall be established and utilized to adjust the speed of the blockade
 to accommodate the closure time needed.
 1-10.3(2)C  Lane Closure Setup/Takedown
 Where allowed by the Contract and where shown on approved traffic control plans or
 directed by the Engineer, the Contractor shall set up traffic control measures to close one
 or more lanes of a multi-lane facility. When this is to occur, the following sequence shall
 be followed:
 1.	 If the Plans show a portable changeable message sign, it shall be established in
 advance of the operation, far enough back to provide warning of both the operation
 and any queue of traffic that has formed during the operation.
 2.	 Advance warning signs are set up on the Shoulder of the Roadway opposite the lane
 to be closed.
 3.	 Advance warning signs are set up on the same Shoulder as the lane to be closed.
 4.	 A transportable attenuator, with arrow board, is moved into place at the beginning
 of the closure taper.
 5.	 Channelization devices are placed to mark the taper and the length of the closure
 as shown on the traffic control plan.
 Once the lane is closed, the transportable attenuator/arrow board combination shall
 be replaced with an arrow board without attenuator.
 If additional lanes are to be closed, this shall be done in sequence with previous lane
 closures using the same sequence of activities. A transportable attenuator with arrow board
 is required during the process of closing each additional lane and is to be replaced with an
 arrow board without attenuator after the lane is closed. Each closed lane shall be marked
 with a separate arrow board at all times.
 
 Page 1-114
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Temporary Traffic Control
 
 1-10
 
 Channelization devices shall not be moved by traffic control personnel across an open lane
 of traffic. If an existing setup or staging of traffic control devices require crossing an open
 lane of traffic, the traffic control devices shall be taken down completely and then set up in the
 new configuration.
 Traffic control for lane closures shall be removed in the reverse order of its installation.
 1-10.3(2)D  Mobile Operations
 Where construction operations are such that movement along the length of a Roadway
 is continuous or near-continuous to the extent that a stationary traffic control layout will not
 be effective, the Contractor may implement a moving, or mobile, traffic control scheme.
 Such moving control shall always be conducted in the same direction as the adjacent traffic.
 Where shown on an approved traffic control plan or where directed by the Engineer, mobile
 traffic control shall consist of portable equipment, moving with the operation. A portable
 changeable message sign shall be established in advance of the operation, far enough back to
 provide warning of both the operation and of any queue of traffic that has formed during the
 operation. The advance sign shall be continuously moved to stay near the back of the queue at
 all times. A transportable attenuator, with arrow board, shall be positioned and maintained at a
 fixed distance upstream of the Work. A shadow vehicle, with transportable attenuator shall be
 positioned and maintained immediately upstream of the Work.
 1-10.3(2)E  Patrol and Maintain Traffic Control Measures
 At all times, when temporary traffic control measures are in place, the Contractor shall
 provide for patrolling and maintaining these measures. The Work shall consist of resetting
 errant devices, assuring visibility of all devices, cleaning and repairing where necessary,
 providing maintenance for all equipment, including replacing batteries and light bulbs as well
 as keeping motorized and electronic items functioning, and adjusting the location of devices
 to respond to actual conditions, such as queue length, unanticipated traffic conflicts and other
 areas where planned traffic control has proven ineffective.
 This Work shall be performed by the Contractor, either by or under the direction of the
 Traffic Control Supervisor. Personnel, with vehicles if necessary, shall be dispatched so that
 all traffic control can be reviewed at least once per hour during working hours and at least
 once during each non-working day.
 1-10.3(3)  Traffic Control Devices
 Traffic control devices, including signs, furnished or provided shall conform to the
 standards established in the latest WSDOT-adopted edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic
 Control Devices for Streets and Highways (MUTCD) published by the U.S. Department of
 Transportation and the Washington State Modifications to the MUTCD. Requirements for
 pedestrian traffic control devices are addressed in the MUTCD.
 1-10.3(3)A  Construction Signs
 All construction signs required by approved traffic control plans, as well as any other
 appropriate signs directed by the Engineer shall be furnished by the Contractor. The Contractor
 shall provide the posts or supports and erect and maintain the signs in a clean, neat, and
 presentable condition until the need for them has ended. Post mounted signs shall be installed
 as shown in the Standard Plans. When the need for construction signs has ended, the
 Contractor, upon approval of the Engineer, shall remove all signs, posts, and supports from
 the project and they shall remain the property of the Contractor.
 No passing zones on the existing Roadway that are marked with paint striping and which
 striping is to be obliterated by construction operations shall be replaced by “Do Not Pass” and
 “Pass With Care” signs. The Contractor shall provide and install the posts and signs. The signs
 shall be maintained by the Contractor until they are removed or until the Contract is Physically
 Completed. When the project includes striping by the Contractor, the signs and posts shall be
 removed by the Contractor when the no passing zones are reestablished by striping. The signs
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 1-115
 
 1-10
 
 Temporary Traffic Control
 
 and posts will become the property of the Contractor. When the Contractor is not responsible
 for striping and when the striping by others is not completed when the project is Physically
 Completed, the posts and signs shall be left in place and shall become the property of the
 Contracting Agency.
 All existing signs, new permanent signs installed under this Contract, and construction
 signs installed under this Contract that are inappropriate for the traffic configuration at a
 given time shall be removed or completely covered in accordance with Section 8-21.3(3).
 Construction signs will be divided into two classes. Class A construction signs are those signs

 existing steel reinforcing bars which extend from the existing members and are specified
 to remain. Steel reinforcing bars that are not designated to remain shall be cut a minimum
 of 1-inch behind the final surface. The void left by removal of the steel reinforcing bar shall
 be filled with mortar conforming to Section 9-20.4(2). The mortar shall match the color of
 the existing concrete surface as nearly as practicable.
 The Contractor shall roughen, clean, and saturate existing concrete surfaces, against which
 fresh concrete will be placed, in accordance with Section 6-02.3(12)B. When a portion of
 existing concrete is to be removed without replacement, concrete shall be removed to a clean
 line with a smooth surface of less than 1/16 inch profile.
 2-02.3(2)A3  Use of Explosives for Bridge Demolition
 Explosives shall not be used for bridge demolition, except as specifically allowed by the
 Special Provisions.
 2-02.3(3)  Removal of Pavement, Sidewalks, Curbs, and Gutters
 In removing pavement, sidewalks, curbs, and gutters, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Haul broken-up pieces into the Roadway embankment or to some off-project site.
 2.	 Material that is to be incorporated into the embankment shall be broken into pieces not
 exceeding 18 inches in any dimension, and no part of any piece shall be within 3 feet
 of the top, side, or end surface of the embankment or any Structure.
 3.	 Make a vertical full depth saw cut between any existing pavement, sidewalk, curb, or
 gutter that is to remain and the portion to be removed. For portland cement concrete
 pavement removal, a second vertical full depth relief saw cut offset 12 to 18 inches
 from and parallel to the initial saw cut is also required, unless the Engineer approves
 otherwise. For removal of bituminous pavement, asphalt planing equipment may be
 used in lieu of sawcutting provided that a clean vertical edge remains.
 4.	 Replace at no expense to the Contracting Agency any existing pavement designated
 to remain that is damaged during the removal of other pavement.

 2-03  Roadway Excavation and Embankment
 2-03.1 Description
 The Work described in this section, regardless of the nature or type of the materials
 encountered, includes excavating and grading the Roadway, excavating in borrow pits,
 excavating below grade, excavating channels and ditches, removing slide material, and
 disposing of all excavated material. These activities may be performed in making cuts,
 embankments, slopes, Roadway ditches, approaches, parking areas, Highway-driveway
 intersections, and in completing related Work. The Work includes the removal of pavement,
 sidewalks, curbs and gutters as described in Section 2-02 when these items lie within an
 excavation area.
 The Work excludes these items if they are designated as pay items in the Contract:
 1.	Haul.
 2.	 Excavation for Structures and ditches.
 3.	 Removal of unsuitable materials.
 The Plans may divide the project into separate areas (Roadway Excavation, Area A,
 Roadway Excavation, Area B, etc.). Such division does not imply any classification
 of materials in the areas. The boundaries of the areas shall not be changed regardless
 of how similar or dissimilar the materials are from one area to another.
 All Work described here must reasonably conform to the alignment, grade, and
 cross‑sections shown in the Plans or established by the Engineer.
 2-03.2 Vacant
 2-03.3  Construction Requirements
 2-03.3(1)  Widening of Cuts
 If routine cuts do not supply enough material to form the embankment, the Contractor shall
 obtain more material from areas inside or outside the Right of Way and/or from widening one
 or both sides of existing cuts as determined by the Engineer. The Contractor shall dress the
 sides of the cuts to any slopes the Engineer may require. If the Contractor has dressed a cut
 before the Engineer determines to widen it, the Contracting Agency will pay for the resloping
 as provided in Section 1-04.4. In addition, material obtained from areas beyond the cuts shown
 in the Plans that result in additional haul will be paid by the Contracting Agency as provided
 in Section 1-04.4.
 2-03.3(2)  Rock Cuts
 1.	 Preserving Rock Below Subgrade – The Contractor shall take care not to break down,
 loosen, or damage the rock under the Subgrade line, except as provided by Section
 2-03.3(3). Normally cuts will be made from the top, lift by lift, to protect the rock bench
 that will remain. The Contractor shall be responsible for methods used and for any
 damage caused to the Roadbed, regardless of any previous approvals by the Engineer.
 2.	 Scaling and Dressing – To leave rock cuts in a safe, stable condition, the Contractor
 shall scale and dress them, removing all loose fragments and rocks not firmly fastened
 to the rock slope. The Contractor shall also remove any overhanging rock the Engineer
 sees as a hazard to Roadway users.
 	 If the Engineer requires it, the Contractor shall remove loose fragments and rocks lying
 outside the slope stakes. Payment for such extra Work shall be by force account as
 provided in Section 1-09.6. The Contracting Agency will pay for loading and hauling
 these materials at the unit Contract prices that apply or as provided in Section 1-04.4.
 3.	 Drilling and Blasting – Not less than 2 weeks prior to commencing drilling and
 blasting operations or at any time the Contractor proposes to change the drilling and
 blasting methods, the Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working Drawing consisting
 of a blasting plan. The blasting plan shall contain the full details of the drilling and
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 2-7
 
 2-03
 
 Roadway Excavation and Embankment
 
 blasting patterns and controls the Contractor proposes to use for both the controlled and
 production blasting. The blasting plan submittal is required for all blasting operations
 and shall contain at least the following information:
 a.	 Station limits of proposed shot.
 b.	 Plan and section views of proposed drill pattern including free face, burden, blast
 hole spacing, blast hole diameter, blast hole angles, lift height, and subdrill depth.
 c.	 Loading diagram showing type and amount of explosives, primers, initiators, and
 location and depth of stemming.
 d.	 Initiation sequence of blast holes including delay times and delay system.
 e.	 Manufacturer’s data sheets for all explosives, primers, and initiators to be employed.
 	 Review of the blasting plan by the Engineer shall not relieve the Contractor of the
 responsibility for the accuracy and adequacy of the plan when implemented in the field.
 4.	 Controlled Blasting – When blasting to establish slopes 0.5:1 or steeper, and more than
 10 feet high, the Contractor shall use controlled blasting. The Engineer may require the
 Contractor to use controlled blasting to form the faces of other slopes, even if the slopes
 could be formed by nonblasting methods.
 	 Controlled blasting refers to the controlled use of explosives and blasting accessories
 in carefully spaced and aligned drill holes to provide a free surface or shear plane in
 the rock along the specified backslope. Controlled blasting techniques covered by
 this Specification include presplitting and cushion blasting.
 	 In addition to the blasting plan submittal, when using controlled blasting the
 Contractor shall:
 a.	 Prior to commencing full-scale blasting operations, the Contractor shall demonstrate
 the adequacy of the proposed blast plan by drilling, blasting, and excavating short
 test sections, up to 100 feet in length, to determine which combination of method,
 hole spacing, and charge works best. When field conditions warrant, the Contractor
 may be ordered to use test section lengths less than 100 feet.
 	 Unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer, the Contractor shall begin the tests
 with the controlled blast holes spaced 30 inches apart, then adjust if needed, until
 the Engineer accepts the spacing to be used for full-scale blasting operations.
 b.	 The Contractor shall completely remove all overburden, soil, and loose or
 decomposed rock along the top of the excavation for a distance of at least 30 feet
 beyond the end of the production hole drilling limits, or to the end of the cut, before
 drilling the presplitting holes.
 c.	 The controlled blast holes shall be not less than 2½ inches nor more than 3 inches
 in diameter.
 d.	 The Contractor shall control drilling operations by the use of the proper equipment
 and technique to ensure that no hole deviates from the plane of the planned slope by
 more than 9 inches either parallel or normal to the slope. Drill holes exceeding these
 limits will not be paid for unless satisfactory slopes are being obtained.
 e.	 Controlled blast holes shall extend a minimum of 30 feet beyond the limits of the
 production holes to be detonated, or to the end of the cut as applicable.
 f.	 The length of controlled blast holes for any individual lift shall not exceed 20 feet
 unless the Contractor can demonstrate to the Engineer the ability to stay within
 the above tolerances and produce a uniform slope. If greater than 5 percent of
 the presplit holes are misaligned in any one lift, the Contractor shall reduce the
 height of the lifts until the 9-inch alignment tolerance is met. Upon satisfactory
 demonstration, the length of holes may be increased to a maximum of 60 feet with
 written acceptance of the Engineer.
 
 Page 2-8
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Roadway Excavation and Embankment
 
 2-03
 
 g.	 When the cut height requires more than one lift, a maximum 2-foot offset between
 lifts will be permitted to allow for drill equipment clearances. The Contractor shall
 begin the controlled blast hole drilling at a point that will allow for necessary offsets
 and shall adjust, at the start of lower lifts, to compensate for any drift that may have
 occurred in the upper lifts.
 h.	 Before placing charges, the Contractor shall determine that the hole is free of
 obstructions for its entire depth. All necessary precautions shall be exercised so
 that the placing of the charges will not cause caving of material from the walls
 of the holes.
 i.	 The maximum diameter of explosives used in presplit holes shall not be greater than
 ½ the diameter of the presplit hole.
 j.	 Only standard explosives manufactured especially for controlled blasting shall
 be used in controlled blast holes, unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer. Bulk
 ammonium nitrate and fuel oil (ANFO) shall not be loaded in the presplit holes.
 k.	 If fractional portions of standard explosive cartridges are used, they shall be firmly
 affixed to the detonating cord in a manner that the cartridges will not slip down the
 detonating cord nor bridge across the hole. Spacing of fractional cartridges along the
 length of the detonating cord shall not exceed 30 inches center to center and shall be
 adjusted to give the desired results.
 l.	 Continuous column cartridge type of explosives used with detonating cord shall
 be assembled and affixed to the detonating cord in accordance with the explosive
 manufacturer’s instructions, a copy of which shall be submitted as a Type 1
 Working Drawing.
 m.	The bottom charge of a presplit hole may be larger than the line charges but shall
 not be large enough to cause overbreak. The top charge of the presplitting hole
 shall be placed far enough below the collar, and reduced sufficiently, to avoid
 overbreaking and heaving.
 n.	 The upper portion of all presplit holes, from the top most charge to the hole collar,
 shall be stemmed. Stemming materials shall be sand or other dry angular material,
 all of which passes a ⅜-inch sieve.
 o.	 If presplitting is specified, the detonation of these holes shall be fired first.
 p.	 If cushion blasting is specified, the detonation of these holes shall be fired last on
 an instantaneous delay after all other blasting has taken place in the excavation.
 q.	 Production blast holes shall not be drilled closer than 6 feet to the controlled blast
 line, unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer. The bottom of the production holes
 shall not be lower than the bottom of the controlled blast holes. Production holes
 shall not exceed 6 inches in diameter, unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer.
 Detonation of production holes shall be on a delay sequence toward a free face.
 r.	 The use of horizontal blast holes for either production or controlled blasting
 is prohibited.
 2-03.3(3)  Excavation Below Subgrade
 Rock Excavation – When the Contractor finds rock or other hard material at the Subgrade
 elevation, it shall be excavated the full width of the Roadbed to at least 6 inches below
 Subgrade, then backfilled with rock fragments, gravel, or other free-draining material not more
 than 4 inches in diameter.
 If the Contractor uses a Subgrade trimmer, the backfill shall be rock, gravel, or other
 free-draining material not more than 2 inches in diameter. The Contractor shall save the finer
 free-draining material from excavations or borrow pits to use in backfilling the top 6 inches of
 the Subgrade. All such material shall be approved by the Engineer.
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 2-9
 
 2-03
 
 Roadway Excavation and Embankment
 
 Sub excavation – At any time, the Engineer may order excavation below Subgrade to
 remove soft and uncompactible material. The replacement material shall be free-draining and
 granular, or other materials as determined by the Engineer.
 Draining Rock Pockets – If blasting below Subgrade leaves a rock pocket that will not
 drain, the Contractor shall dig a trench from the pocket bottom to the roadside ditch, then
 backfill both the pocket and the trench with rock fragments, gravel, or other material approved
 by the Engineer, at no expense to the Contracting Agency.
 Compaction – If the density of the natural earth under any area of the Roadway is less
 than that required in Section 2-03.3(14)C, Method B, the Engineer may order the Contractor
 to perform any or all of the following:
 1.	 Scarify the earth to a depth of 6 inches.
 2.	 Aerate or water.
 3.	 Compact the scarified area to the required density.
 4.	 Excavate to a specific depth.
 5.	 Backfill the excavated area in layers, using the previously excavated material or
 other material.
 6.	 Compact each layer to meet the compaction requirements for embankments.
 2-03.3(4)  Sluicing
 The Contractor shall not excavate by sluicing unless the Special Provisions specifically
 call for it.
 2-03.3(5)  Slope Treatment
 The tops of all Roadway cut slopes, except solid rock cuts, shall be rounded in accordance
 with the Standard Plans. Unless otherwise noted in the Plans or Special Provisions, Class A
 slope treatment shall be utilized.
 If a layer of earth covers a rock cut, the slope shall be rounded above the rock as if it were
 an earth slope.
 When the Contractor removes stumps or any embedded material from the rounded area,
 the void shall be backfilled and stabilized to prevent erosion.
 All Work required to complete slope treatment, including excavation, haul, and slope
 rounding, shall be included in the unit Bid price for Roadway excavation.
 2-03.3(6)  Deposit of Rock for the Contracting Agency’s Use
 At the Engineer’s direction, the Contractor shall deposit excavated rock at the roadside
 or elsewhere. If this requires the Contractor to use material that would otherwise have gone
 into an embankment, the Contracting Agency will pay for the extra cubic yards of excavation
 needed to complete the embankment. Any such rock deposit shall be Contracting Agency
 property. The Contractor shall be responsible for safekeeping the deposit until the Contracting
 Agency has removed it or until the Contract is completed.
 2-03.3(7)  Disposal of Surplus Material
 2-03.3(7)A  General
 The Contractor shall haul all excavation to the nearest embankment unless the Engineer
 declares the hauling distance to be too great. If excavation yields more material than needed
 for nearby embankments, the Contractor shall dispose of the excess in keeping with the
 Special Provisions or as the Engineer directs.
 2-03.3(7)B Haul
 When the Contract includes a payment item for haul, the Contracting Agency will pay as
 follows for hauling excess excavation to a disposal site:
 
 Page 2-10
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Roadway Excavation and Embankment
 
 2-03
 
 1.	 If the Contracting Agency provides a site, but the Contractor chooses to haul elsewhere,
 the Contracting Agency will pay for the actual distance up to but not exceeding the
 distance that would have been necessary using the Contracting Agency site.
 2.	 If the Contracting Agency does not provide a site, the Contracting Agency will pay for
 the actual distance up to but not exceeding the distance necessary to haul to a site 1 mile
 from the project limits.
 2-03.3(7)C Contractor-Provided Disposal Site
 If the Contracting Agency provides no waste site, but requires disposal of excess
 excavation or other materials, the Contractor shall arrange for disposal at no expense to the
 Contracting Agency, except as provided in Section 2-03.3(7)B, item 2.
 The Contractor shall acquire all permits and approvals required for the use of the disposal
 sites before any waste is hauled off the project. The Contractor shall submit a Type 1 Working
 Drawing consisting of copies of the permits and approvals for any disposal sites to be used.
 The cost of any such permits and approvals shall be included in the Bid prices for other Work.
 Disposal of excess material within a wetland area will not be allowed without a Section
 404 permit issued by the U.S. Corps of Engineers and approval by the local agency with
 jurisdiction over the wetlands.
 The Contractor shall protect, indemnify, and save harmless the Contracting Agency from
 any damages that may arise from the Contractor’s activities in making these arrangements.
 Such indemnity shall be in accordance with RCW 4.24.115 as amended by CH. 305,
 Laws of 1986. Any action required to satisfy any permit and/or any approval requirements
 in a Contractor-provided disposal site shall be performed by the Contractor at no additional
 expense to the Contracting Agency.
 Reclamation of a Contractor-supplied waste site must conform to the requirements
 of Section 3-03.
 2-03.3(8)  Wasting Material
 If, against the Engineer’s orders, the Contractor wastes material needed for the
 embankment, it shall be replaced at no expense to the Contracting Agency with material the
 Engineer approves.
 2-03.3(9)  Roadway Ditches
 At each transition from cut to fill, the Contractor shall divert any Roadway ditch away
 from the embankment in natural ground. Ditches shall never permit water to flow into or
 upon embankment material.
 2-03.3(10)  Selected Material
 When the Contract or the Engineer calls for it, selected material shall be used for finishing
 the top part of the Subgrade, for structural or other backfill, or for other purposes. Unless the
 Special Provisions specify otherwise, the Engineer may identify as “selected” any material
 excavated within the right-of-way, including the excavation of local borrow.
 Direct Hauling – If it is practical, the Contractor shall haul selected material immediately
 from excavation to its final place on the Roadbed. The Contracting Agency will pay for such
 Work at the unit Contract prices for excavating, hauling, watering, and compacting.
 Delayed Excavation – If it is impractical to haul selected material to its final place at once,
 the Contractor shall delay excavation until the placement will be workable. The Contracting
 Agency will not pay extra for delayed excavation.
 Stockpiling – The Engineer may allow the Contractor to stockpile selected materials if
 delaying the excavation will hamper grading or force impractical movements of equipment.
 In this case, the Engineer will direct where and when the Contractor shall excavate, stockpile,
 haul, and place the selected materials.
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 2-11
 
 2-03
 
 Roadway Excavation and Embankment
 
 Sections 2-03.4 and 2-03.5 describe how the Contracting Agency will measure and pay for
 excavating and hauling these stockpiled selected materials. The neat line volume of material
 removed will provide the basis for measuring material taken from the stockpile.
 2-03.3(11)  Slides
 If a slide occurs on a finished slope before final acceptance of the Work, the Contractor
 shall remove or replace the slide material. The Contractor shall also refinish the slope to the
 condition and with the materials required by the Engineer.
 The Contracting Agency will pay for the excavation at the unit Contract price and for
 resloping on a force account basis. The Engineer may authorize payment for the excavation
 by agreed price or force account if:
 1.	 The slide material cannot be measured accurately, or
 2.	 Excavation of slide material requires equipment not available on the project.
 If the Contractor undercuts or destroys a slope, or has failed to implement erosion
 control devices as shown in the Contract or in the TESC plan, it shall be resloped to
 the original alignment or to a new one established by the Engineer at no expense to the
 Contracting Agency.
 2-03.3(12)  Overbreak
 Overbreak includes that part of any material excavated, displaced, or loosened outside
 the staked or reestablished slope or grade. Such material is considered overbreak whether
 its movement resulted from blasting, from the character of the material itself, or from any
 other cause. Overbreak, however, does not include material from slides as described in
 Section 2-03.3(11).
 If the Engineer does not approve use of the overbreak, the Contractor shall remove, haul,
 and dispose of it at no expense to the Contracting Agency. In this case, the Contractor shall
 follow the procedure for handling surplus described in Section 2-03.3(7).
 If the Engineer approves, the Contractor may use overbreak:
 1.	 To complete an embankment when the excavated material unexpectedly falls short
 of the amount required. The Contracting Agency will pay the Roadway excavation
 Contract price for the volume of material the overbreak replaces, and will pay the
 Contract price for haul. However, no payment will be made if overbreak is used
 when other material is available within the neat lines of the Roadway prism.
 2.	 To replace borrow excavation originally planned for an embankment. The Contracting
 Agency will pay for overbreak used this way at the unit Contract price for Roadway
 or borrow excavation, whichever costs less. The Engineer will include haul to be paid
 as in the original Proposal in comparing the costs under the two payment methods.
 2-03.3(13)  Borrow
 Borrow is the excavation of material outside the Roadway prism or outside the limits of
 any other excavation area required by the Contract. Before any borrow site can be used, it
 must be measured and approved by the Engineer. Any material excavated from a borrow site
 before the site is measured will not be paid for. The widening of Roadway cuts and ditches
 will be considered Roadway excavation, not borrow.
 If the Contract documents designate borrow sources, the Contractor may utilize those
 sources or may obtain borrow from other sites. If borrow is obtained from a Contractorprovided site, there will be no additional cost to the Contracting Agency beyond the Contract
 unit price for the excavated borrow material. There will be no payment for aeration of the
 borrowed material from a Contractor-provided site, even if the Contract contains an item for
 aeration and even if the Contract documents designate borrow sources.
 If neither the Plans nor the Special Provisions name a source for borrow, the Contractor
 shall provide a source at no expense to the Contracting Agency.
 The Contractor shall reclaim all borrow sites, Contracting Agency-owned, Contracting
 Agency-supplied, or obtained by the Contractor, in keeping with Section 3-03.

 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Roadway Excavation and Embankment
 
 2-03
 
 2-03.3(14)  Embankment Construction
 The Contracting Agency classifies embankment construction as:
 1.	 Rock Embankment – In which the material in all or any part of an embankment
 contains 25 percent or more, by volume, gravel or stone 4 inches or more in diameter.
 Section 2-03.3(14)A.
 2.	 Earth Embankment – Made of any material other than that used in rock embankment.
 Section 2-03.3(14)B.
 Unstable Base – If the Engineer believes the natural earth base will impair an embankment
 or make it unstable, the Contractor shall stabilize or remove and dispose of the base material
 in keeping with this section or Section 2-03.3(14)E.
 Hillside Terraces – The Contractor shall terrace the original ground or embankment when
 the slope of the surface is 2H:1V or steeper unless otherwise directed by the Engineer. The
 face of each terrace shall be a minimum of 1 foot and a maximum of 5 feet in height and
 shall be vertical or near vertical as required to remain stable during material placement and
 compaction. The bench of the terrace shall slope outward to drain and shall not be inclined
 steeper than 0.05 foot per foot. Terraces damaged during work shall be reestablished. The
 Engineer may order the Contractor to place gravel backfill, pipe drains or both to drain
 any seepage.
 All costs for building terraces shall be included in the prices for other Work.
 Soft Base – On wet or swampy ground, the Contractor shall haul and spread embankment
 material by methods that will disturb the base as little as possible. If the Engineer approves,
 the Contractor may place the lower part of the fill by dumping and spreading successive loads
 to form a uniform layer just thick enough to support equipment used to place and compact
 upper layers.
 Normally the Contractor shall not increase the planned depth of the embankment over a
 soft base merely to permit the use of heavier equipment. But if the Contractor proves that the
 planned depth will not support light hauling vehicles, the Engineer may approve a deeper
 fill. The Contractor shall not claim extra pay if these restrictions require the use of lighter
 equipment or different construction methods than originally planned for use on the soft base.
 2-03.3(14)A  Rock Embankment Construction
 The Contractor shall build rock embankments in horizontal layers. No layer shall be deeper
 than 18 inches unless the rocks in the fill material average more than 18 inches in diameter.
 The Contractor shall separate and distribute the larger pieces of rock and fill the spaces
 between them with smaller rocks and earth. With the Engineer’s approval, the Contractor may
 dispose of rocks larger than the average size instead of placing them in the embankment.
 Compacting – The Contractor shall use a 50-ton compression roller or a vibratory roller
 having a dynamic force of at least 40,000 pounds impact per vibration and at least 1,000
 vibrations per minute. In either case, the roller shall make one full coverage for each 6 inches,
 or any fraction of 6 inches, of lift depth.
 When lift depth is 18 inches or less, the Contractor may use a 10-ton compression roller or
 a vibratory roller having a dynamic force of at least 30,000-pounds impact per vibration and at
 least 1,000 vibrations per minute. In either case, the roller shall make four full coverages for
 each 6 inches, or any fraction of 6 inches, of lift depth.
 Rollers must exert reasonably even pressure over the area covered. The Contractor shall
 limit the speed of compression rollers to no more than 4 mph, and the speed of vibratory
 rollers to no more than 1½ mph.
 If possible, the Contractor shall compact the material even further by routing empty and
 loaded hauling equipment evenly over the entire width of the embankment.
 When the Engineer believes rolling to be physically impractical, rolling may be omitted
 on part or all of a layer.
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 2-13
 
 2-03
 
 Roadway Excavation and Embankment
 
 Should excessive moisture threaten the stability of the embankment the Engineer may
 order the Contractor to alter the operation. This may include alternating layers of wet and dry
 materials, drying materials before placing, or halting Work in the problem areas. In this case
 the Contracting Agency will not increase payment, but will pay the unit Contract prices for
 the pay items that apply.
 Top Layer – The Contractor shall build each rock embankment up to 6 inches below
 Subgrade. The top 6-inch layer of embankment shall be of rock, gravel, or other free-draining
 material that does not exceed 4 inches in diameter. When the Plans require use of a Subgrade
 trimmer, these materials in the top layer may not exceed 2 inches in diameter.
 When practical, and as approved by the Engineer, the Contractor shall save the finer freedraining material from excavations or borrow pits for use in topping rock fills. If selected
 materials suitable for topping are available, the Contracting Agency will pay for them as
 described in Section 2-03.3(10). If such materials are not available on site, the Contracting
 Agency will pay for imported materials by including them in the unit Contract price for
 gravel borrow or borrow excavation, each including haul. If the Proposal does not include
 these items, the Contracting Agency will pay as provided in Section 1-04.4.
 2-03.3(14)B Earth Embankment Construction
 The Contractor shall place earth embankments in horizontal layers of uniform thickness.
 These layers shall run full width from the top to the bottom of the embankment. Slopes shall
 be compacted to the required density as part of embankment compaction.
 During grading operations, the Contractor shall shape the surfaces of embankments and
 excavations to uniform cross-sections and eliminate all ruts and low places that could hold
 water. The Contractor shall raise the center of an embankment above the sides. When the
 surface of an embankment intersects a side hill, the surface shall be sloped away at a rate
 not to exceed 20:1.
 2-03.3(14)C  Compacting Earth Embankments
 This section describes three methods (A, B, and C) for building earth embankments.
 The Contractor shall use Method B unless the Special Provisions require another method.
 Method A – Each embankment shall be made of layers no more than 2 feet thick. The
 Contractor shall compact each layer by routing loaded haul equipment over its entire width.
 If the Engineer approves, the Contractor may use end dumping to begin placing a side hill
 fill too narrow for hauling equipment. When the fill is wide enough, the remaining layers
 shall be compacted by the loaded hauling equipment.
 Method B – The top 2 feet of each embankment shall be compacted to 95 percent
 of the maximum density as determined by the compaction control tests described in
 Section 2-03.3(14)D. All material below the 2-foot level shall be compacted to 90 percent
 of the same maximum density.
 In the top 2 feet, horizontal layers shall not exceed 4 inches in depth before compaction.
 No layer below the top 2 feet shall exceed 8 inches in depth before compaction.
 The Contractor shall use compacting equipment approved by the Engineer.
 Method C – Each layer of the entire embankment shall be compacted to 95 percent
 of the maximum density as determined by the compaction control tests described in
 Section 2-03.3(14)D.
 In the top 2 feet, horizontal layers shall not exceed 4 inches in depth before compaction.
 No layer below the top 2 feet shall exceed 8 inches in depth before compaction.
 The Contractor shall use compacting equipment approved by the Engineer.
 Under Methods B or C, the Engineer may permit the Contractor to increase layer
 thickness up to 18 inches before compaction, provided:
 1.	 The layer is more than 2 feet below the top of the embankment,
 2.	 An approved vibratory roller is used, and
 3.	 The required density is obtained throughout the full depth and width of each layer.
 Page 2-14
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Roadway Excavation and Embankment
 
 2-03
 
 Whatever the method used, any embankment inaccessible to large compacting equipment
 shall be compacted with small mechanical or vibratory compactors.
 Moisture Content – The Contractor shall adjust moisture content during compaction
 to produce a firm, stable and unyielding embankment. The embankment shall be free from
 pumping and rutting due to excessive moisture and is the Contractor’s responsibility to
 manage and adjust as necessary.
 The Contracting Agency will consider all costs for drying embankment material to be
 incidental to other Work, including excessive moisture due to inclement weather. If, however,
 the Contract includes an aeration item, the Contracting Agency will pay for such Work as
 specified in Sections 2-03.4 and 2-03.5.
 The Contractor shall repair, at no expense to the Contracting Agency, any partial or
 complete embankment that loses stability because of continued hauling across it. Evidence of
 lost stability includes pumping, rutting or lateral displacement of embankment. The Contractor
 shall also alter hauling equipment or procedures to prevent further damage.
 2-03.3(14)D  Compaction and Moisture Control Tests
 Maximum density and optimum moisture content shall be determined by one of the
 following methods:
 1.	 Materials with less than 30 percent by weight retained on the No. 4 sieve shall be
 determined using FOP for AASHTO T 99 Method A.
 2.	 Materials with 30 percent or more by weight retained on the No. 4 sieve and less than
 30 percent retained on the ¾-inch sieve shall be determined by WSDOT T 606 or FOP
 for AASHTO T 180 Method D. The determination of which test procedure to use will
 be made solely by the Contracting Agency.
 3.	 Materials with 30 percent or more retained on the ¾-inch sieve shall be determined by
 WSDOT T 606.
 In place density will be determined using Test Methods FOP for AASHTO T 310 and
 WSDOT SOP 615.
 2-03.3(14)E  Unsuitable Foundation Excavation
 When the Contract or the Engineer requires it, the Contractor shall excavate unstable
 natural ground before building any embankment over it. This unstable material may include
 peat, muck, swampland, buried logs and stumps, or other material not fit for an embankment
 base. The Contractor shall excavate such material to the boundaries set by the Engineer.
 The Work will not be considered unsuitable foundation excavation if the materials:
 1.	 Came from the Roadway cut, ditch, or channel-change prisms.
 2.	 Resulted from Structure excavation Class A or B.
 3.	 Are covered in Section 2-03.3(3).
 If the Contract provides no Bid item for unsuitable foundation excavation, the Contracting
 Agency will pay as provided in Section 1-04.4.
 2-03.3(14)F  Displacement of Unsuitable Foundation Materials
 If the Contract requires it, the Contractor shall displace or remove any overburden of peat,
 muck, or other unstable material to permit placing the embankment on underlying firm ground.
 The Engineer will determine the elevation at which the ground is firm enough to support
 the embankment.
 To displace such material, the Contractor shall use explosives or any other method the
 Engineer requires. If this Work upheaves overburden material outside the slopes of the new
 fill, the Contractor shall level the material to make it presentable.
 The Contracting Agency will pay for the Work described in this section by force account.
 Any other costs related to the Work shall be incidental to building the embankment and shall
 be included in the unit Contract prices for the Work items that apply.

 2-03.3(14)G  Backfilling
 When water fills an area after the removal of soft or unstable materials, the Contractor
 shall, if possible, drain the site so that any backfill may be compacted. If drainage is not
 possible, the Contractor shall use granular material for backfilling in water, including areas
 where blasting has displaced the soft material. The Special Provisions may require other
 backfilling methods.
 The costs of pumping or digging temporary drainage ditches shall be incidental to and
 included in other items of Work that apply.
 2-03.3(14)H Prefabricated Vertical Drains
 The Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, equipment and materials, and perform
 all operations necessary for the installation of prefabricated vertical drains in accordance
 with the details shown in the Plans and with the requirements of these Specifications.
 The prefabricated drain shall consist of a continuous plastic drainage core wrapped in
 a nonwoven geotextile material as specified in the Contract.
 The drains shall be free of defects, rips, holes, or flaws. During shipment and storage,
 the drain shall be wrapped in a heavy-duty protective covering. The storage area shall
 protect the drain material from sunlight, mud, dirt, dust, debris, and detrimental substances.
 Manufacturer certification shall be provided for all drain materials delivered to the project.
 Vertical drains shall be staked by the Contractor and constructed prior to
 embankment construction.
 Prior to installation of vertical drains, a sand drainage blanket shall be placed on
 the ground surface for use as a working platform. This platform shall have a minimum
 depth of 2 feet and shall consist of uncompacted material meeting the requirements of
 Section 9-03.13(1).
 Vertical drains shall be installed with equipment that will cause a minimum of subsoil
 disturbance. A mandrel or sleeve shall be advanced through the subsoil using vibratory,
 constant load, or constant rate of advance methods. The mandrel shall have a maximum
 cross‑sectional area of 14 square inches, shall protect the prefabricated drain material from
 tears, cuts, and abrasions during installation, and shall be provided with an “anchor” plate
 or rod. The “anchor” plate or rod shall provide sufficient strength to prevent the soil from
 entering the bottom during installation and shall anchor the bottom of the drain at the required
 depth when the mandrel is removed. Use of falling weight impact hammers or jetting will not
 be allowed within the compressible subsoil to be drained.
 The prefabricated drains shall be installed vertically from the working surface to the
 required elevations and in a sequence that will not require equipment to travel over previously
 installed drains. The Contractor shall provide the Engineer with a suitable means of verifying
 the plumbness of the equipment and determining the depth of the drain at any time. The
 equipment shall not deviate more than 0.25 inches per foot from vertical.
 Splices or connections in the prefabricated drain material shall be done in a professional
 manner to ensure continuity of the wick material. The prefabricated drain shall be cut to leave
 at least 6 inches protruding above the working platform at each drain location.
 Where obstructions are encountered which cannot be penetrated the Contractor shall
 abandon the hole. A maximum of two attempts shall be made to install a new drain within
 18 inches of the obstructed hole. Drains that otherwise deviate from the Plan location by
 more than 6 inches, or that are damaged or improperly installed, will be rejected.
 Installation of the drains should consider and be coordinated with the geotechnical
 instrumentation shown in the Plans. Special care shall be taken when installing drains near
 instrumentation already in place. Replacement of instrumentation damaged by the Contractor
 will be the responsibility of the Contractor.

 Roadway Excavation and Embankment
 
 2-03
 
 The Contractor shall demonstrate that the equipment, method, and materials produce
 a satisfactory installation in accordance with these Specifications. For this purpose, the
 Contractor shall be required to install trial drains at different locations within the Work area.
 The Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working Drawing consisting of details of the
 sequence and method of installation. The submittal shall, at a minimum, contain the
 dimensions and length of mandrel, a detailed description of the proposed method(s) for
 overcoming obstructions, and the proposed method(s) for splicing drains.
 Approval by the Engineer will not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to install
 prefabricated vertical drains in accordance with the Plans, Special Provisions, and these
 Specifications. If, at any time, the Engineer considers the method of installation does not
 produce a satisfactory drain, the Contractor shall alter the method and equipment as necessary.
 2-03.3(14)I  Embankments at Bridge and Trestle Ends
 This Work consists of filling around the ends of trestles and bridges, the area defined in
 Section 1-01.3. The Contractor shall begin and complete this Work as soon as possible after
 each bridge is completed or when the Engineer requires.
 The Contractor shall select fill material from the excavation sources elsewhere on the
 project. Bridge Approach Embankments shall be compacted to at least 95 percent of the
 maximum density as determined by the tests described in Section 2-03.3(14)D. In any
 embankment area where piles will be installed, the Contractor shall remove all solid material,
 rocks, broken concrete, etc., larger than 3 inches across that would interfere with pile driving.
 To prevent the bridge from being distorted or displaced, the Contractor shall place backfill
 evenly around all sides and parts of the Structure. The Contractor shall not backfill any
 abutment prior to placing the Superstructure. After the Superstructure is in place, use of small
 compactors may be required to compact the backfill around the Structure. Embankments and
 backfill behind the abutments shall be brought up in layers and compacted concurrently. The
 difference in backfill height against each abutment shall not exceed 2 feet unless otherwise
 allowed by the Engineer.
 The Contractor may request to place the abutment backfill (either full or partial height)
 prior to placement of the Superstructure by submitting Type 2E Working Drawings consisting
 of calculations confirming that the abutment is stable, both for overturning and sliding,
 without the Superstructure in place. The stability calculations shall assume a loading of 30 lbs/
 ft3 equivalent fluid pressure and include at least a 2-foot surcharge for the backfill placement
 equipment. If the abutment backfill is allowed to be placed prior to completion of the
 Superstructure, the Contractor shall bear any added cost that results from the change.
 The Contractor shall build the embankment under the bridge to the dimensions shown in
 the Standard Plans or detailed in the Plans.
 Cost related to all Work described in this section shall be incidental to other Work and
 included in the unit Contract prices that apply.
 2-03.3(14)J  Gravel Borrow Including Haul
 When required by the Plans or the Engineer, the Contractor shall use gravel borrow
 meeting the requirements of Section 9-03.14(1) to:
 1.	 Build structural embankments.
 2.	 Backfill excavation of unsuitable foundation material above the ground water table.
 3.	 Backfill below-grade excavation above the ground water table.
 4.	 Construct mechanically stabilized earth walls.
 5.	 Construct reinforced soil slopes.
 Gravel borrow shall be compacted according to Sections 2-03.3(14)C and 2-03.3(14)D.

 the requirements of Section 9-03.14(2), or common borrow meeting the requirements of
 Section 9-03.14(3) to:
 1.	 Build embankments.
 2.	 Backfill excavation of unsuitable foundation material above the ground water table.
 3.	 Backfill below-grade excavation above the ground water table.
 Where specified, select borrow may be used for constructing reinforced slopes.
 Select borrow and common borrow shall be compacted according to Sections 2-03.3(14)C
 and 2-03.3(14)D.
 2-03.3(14)L  Embankment Widening for Guardrail
 Embankments widened for the installation of beam guardrail shall be terraced in
 accordance with the requirements for hillside terraces in Section 2-03.3(14). Compaction shall
 be in accordance with Method A, as specified in Section 2-03.3(14)C. Guardrail posts shall
 not be installed until the embankment widening is completed and compacted.
 2-03.3(14)M  Excavation of Channels and Ditches
 Channel Excavation includes open excavations 8 feet wide or more at the bottom,
 but excludes channels that are part of the Roadway.
 Ditch Excavation includes open excavations less than 8 feet wide at the bottom,
 but excludes ditches that are part of the Roadway.
 Before excavating channels or ditches, the Contractor shall clear and grub the area
 in accordance with Section 2-01.
 2-03.3(15)  Aeration
 The Contracting Agency may include aeration as a Contract item if material from test holes
 in excavation or borrow sites is too wet to compact properly. Even if the Contract includes
 such an item, the Contractor shall make every effort to reduce the need for aeration. The
 Contractor shall do so by using methods known to be effective in building embankments with
 wet materials. Such methods include open ditching to drain excavation areas or alternating
 layers of wet and dry materials. These and similar methods will be incidental to excavation
 and their costs shall be included in the unit Contract price for Roadway excavation, for borrow
 excavation (including haul), and for haul.
 If aeration is not a Contract item, its cost shall be incidental to and included in the
 excavation and embankment items.
 Aeration Equipment – The Engineer may direct the Contractor to use aeration equipment
 in these areas: Roadway excavation, borrow sites, or embankments. The Contracting Agency
 does not guarantee the moisture-reducing effectiveness of any single type of equipment.
 The Engineer may, however, require the use of any type that will best aerate a given area.
 If the Contractor uses any of the following types of equipment, it shall meet these
 minimum requirements:
 1.	 Heavy-Duty Power Grader – This machine shall have a moldboard measuring 12 feet
 long, 24 inches high, and ¾ inch thick. Each grader shall carry its maximum number
 of standard scarifier-rippers or discs.
 2.	 Heavy-Duty Gang Plow – It shall have at least five 16-inch bottoms. Its tractor shall be
 able to move no less than 1½ mph while plowing at least 9 inches deep through fairly
 wet material.
 3.	 Heavy-Duty Tandem Discs – This machine shall cut a swath at least 8 feet wide
 with discs no less than 28 inches in diameter. Its tractor shall be able to turn fairly wet
 material at least 6 inches deep while moving at 2 mph or more.

 4.	 Heavy-Duty Self-Propelled, Rotary Pulverizer – This machine shall have paddles
 attached to a transverse shaft. It shall travel 1½ mph or more while aerating a swath at
 least 6 feet wide to a depth of 6 inches.
 The Contractor shall not use any aerating equipment listed above in tandem nor use any of
 this equipment to carry out other Bid items of Work while aerating.
 The Engineer may halt aerating Work when weather conditions prevent satisfactory results.
 2-03.3(16)  End Slopes
 The Engineer will determine when and where to build end slopes, whether these occur at
 the beginning or end of a project, at the borders of excavation or embankments, at bridge ends,
 or elsewhere. The Contractor shall build end slopes not detailed in the Plans to the line and
 grade designated by the Engineer regardless of centerline limits shown in the Plans. All Work
 to complete and maintain these end slopes shall be considered as Work to be performed under
 the Contract.
 2-03.3(17)  Snow Removal
 If snow deep enough to interfere with the Work covers a cut or an embankment, the
 Contractor shall remove and deposit it outside the slope stakes. Snow removal must be done at
 least 100 feet ahead of excavation and embankment Work. The Contractor shall remove snow
 at no expense to the Contracting Agency.
 2-03.3(18)  Stepped Slope Construction
 When the Plans or the Engineer requires it, the Contractor shall shape slopes cut in soft
 rock to a stepped pattern conforming closely to the typical cross-section in the Plans. Stepped
 slopes shall meet these requirements:
 1.	 Each step shall be 1 to 2 feet high.
 2.	 The horizontal depth of each step will depend on its relationship to the staked slope
 ratio. The approximate midpoint of each horizontal tread shall occur on the staked
 slope line.
 3.	 The treads shall be approximately level in all directions.
 4.	 The ends of the steps shall be blended into the natural ground, with loose material
 removed from transitional areas.
 5.	 If the Contractor cannot rip a rock outcropping within a cut, the steps shall be blended
 into the rock.
 6.	 Large rocks and material that may fall into the ditch line or onto the Roadway shall be
 removed, but scaling is not required.
 The compaction and seeding requirements of Section 8-01.3(2) shall not apply to stepped
 slope construction.
 The Contracting Agency will measure stepped slope excavation by the area defined by the
 staked slope line. The unit Contract price per cubic yard for Roadway or borrow excavation
 shall be full pay for all labor and equipment required to build stepped slopes.
 2-03.3(19)  Removal of Pavement, Sidewalks, Curbs, and Gutters
 The requirements of Section 2-02.3(3) shall also apply when pavements, sidewalks, curbs,
 and gutters lie within an excavation.
 2-03.4  Measurement
 Roadway excavation, channel excavation, ditch excavation, unsuitable foundation
 excavation, and common borrow items will be measured by the cubic yard. All excavated
 material will be measured in the position it occupied before the excavation was performed.
 An original ground measurement will be taken using cross-section or digital terrain modeling
 survey techniques. For Roadway excavation, channel excavation, and ditch excavation items,
 the original ground will be compared with the planned finished section shown in the Plans.
 Slope/ground intercept points defining the limits of the measurement will be as staked. For
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 2-19
 
 2-03
 
 Roadway Excavation and Embankment
 
 unsuitable foundation excavation and common borrow items, the original ground will be
 compared with a survey of the excavation area taken after the Work is completed. When the
 Contracting Agency requires excavated material to be stockpiled, re-excavated and moved
 again, a second measurement will be made, adding quantity for the same item used in the
 original excavation. The second measurement will be a comparison of the original crosssection of the stockpile with a cross-section of the stockpile area after the second excavation
 is completed.
 If the excavation item does not include Haul, then the measurement provisions of
 Section 2-04 shall apply.
 Gravel borrow and select borrow will be measured by the cubic yard or ton. Measurement
 by cubic yard will be made in the hauling vehicle.
 Sand drainage blanket will be measured by the ton with deductions made for the weight
 of moisture above 8 percent.
 Embankment compaction (Methods B and C in Section 2-03.3(14)C) will be measured by
 the cubic yard. An original ground measurement will be taken using cross-section or digital
 terrain modeling survey techniques. Quantities will be determined based on a comparison
 of the original ground measurement with the finished embankment section as staked. No
 allowance will be made for material that settles. No deduction will be taken for other items
 constructed within the embankment (bridge abutments, piers, columns, backfill, pipes, etc.).
 The Contracting Agency will exclude from compaction measurement material that is wasted
 or placed under water and not compacted in layers as provided by Sections 2-03.3(14)A
 and 2-03.3(14)C. In cuts, where excavation has been made below the planned Subgrade
 elevation, and in fills where excavation has been made below original ground, compaction
 will be measured by the cubic yard in the cross-section of compacted backfill material. When
 material below grade in cuts or in original ground beneath fills is scarified and recompacted,
 embankment compaction will be measured by its compacted depth, up to a maximum of
 6 inches. There is no specific unit of measure and no measurement will be made for method
 A compaction as described in Section 2-03.3(14)C.
 Controlled blasting of rock face will be measured by the linear foot of hole drilled. Holes
 will be measured from the top of the rock surface to the elevation of the Roadway ditch or
 to a bench elevation set by the Engineer. Quantities shown in the Plans are based on 30-inch
 hole spacing. Actual quantities will depend on field conditions and results from test sections.
 Prefabricated vertical drains will be measured by the linear foot. Trial drains will be
 measured and included in the payment quantity for the prefabricated vertical drains. The
 drains will be measured from the top of the working platform to the bottom of each hole.

 2-04  Haul
 2-04.1 Description
 This Work consists of transporting excavated material from its original site to its final place
 in the Work.
 The balance points shown in the Plans are only approximate. The Engineer may change
 the balance points to help equalize quantities of materials or to dispose of surpluses.
 When the Plans require hauling, the Contractor shall not substitute wasting or borrowing.
 The Contracting Agency will not pay extra for cross-hauling unless the Engineer so orders.
 2-04.2 Vacant
 2-04.3 Vacant
 2-04.4 Measurement
 The Contracting Agency will measure haul in units of haul where one unit equals
 100-cubic yards of excavated material hauled 100 feet.
 Excavated material will be measured in its original position. The Engineer will provide
 a copy of the location mass diagram upon request.
 Haul On Right of Way – To compute units of haul, the Contracting Agency will measure
 haul distance parallel to the centerline (or base line) of the Highway. Lateral distance
 (cross‑hauling) will not be measured.
 Quantities to be measured in this way include: (1) material from the Roadway prism or
 prisms; (2) borrow from widened cuts; (3) waste deposited in the Right of Way or alongside
 it; and (4) material from Auxiliary Lanes – Frontage Roads, speed change lanes, paralleling
 and loop ramps, cross roads, and other lanes that supplement through-traffic movements.
 If the Plans show more than one centerline or base line (as in a multi-lane Highway),
 the Plans or Special Provisions will describe the line by which haul will be computed.
 Waste Haul Off Right of Way – The Contracting Agency will measure the cross-section
 and length of any waste embankment to calculate waste quantities. If the Plans or Special
 Provisions do not specify a haul route, the Contracting Agency will compute haul along the
 long axis of the waste embankment, thence along a line running perpendicular to the Highway
 center line, starting at the center line and ending at the nearest end of the waste embankment.
 However, when a route is specified, haul distance will be measured along that route. If the
 Contractor chooses to use a route shorter than that computed or specified, the Contracting
 Agency will base payment on the length of the route actually used.
 2-04.5 Payment

 This Work consists of preparing graded Roadbed for surfacing or surfaced Roadbed
 for paving.
 2-06.2 Vacant
 2-06.3  Construction Requirements
 2-06.3(1)  Subgrade for Surfacing
 In preparing the Roadbed for surfacing, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Remove from the Roadbed, immediately before placing surfacing materials, all brush,
 weeds, vegetation, grass, and other debris.
 2.	 Dispose of all debris as the Engineer directs.
 3.	 Drain water from all low spots or ruts.
 4.	 Shape the entire Subgrade to a uniform surface running reasonably true to the line,
 grade, and cross-section as staked.
 5.	 If necessary, the Contractor shall process the Subgrade in cut areas to remove materials
 too coarse for mechanical trimming and recompaction.
 6.	 Compact the Subgrade to a depth of 6 inches. Compaction shall achieve 95 percent
 of the maximum density determined under the tests described in Section 2-03.3(14)D.
 If the underlying material is too soft to permit proper compaction of the Subgrade,
 the Contractor shall loosen, aerate (or excavate and remove), and compact the
 Subgrade until the top layer can be compacted as required.
 7.	 Remove excess material that does not drift to low spots during grading and shaping.
 The Contractor shall dispose of this excess by placing it where the Subgrade lacks
 material or by wasting it, as the Engineer directs.
 8.	 Add materials as the Engineer directs where the Subgrade needs more to bring it up
 to grade. The Contractor shall water and compact these added materials as needed
 to produce a true finished Subgrade.
 If the Contract requires a trimming machine, it shall:
 1.	 Maintain the grade and transverse slopes automatically through sensors that respond
 to reference lines on both edges of each Roadway.
 2.	 Create a smooth, uniform surface free from chatter and ripples.
 2-06.3(2)  Subgrade for Pavement
 Before any paving is placed, the Contractor shall bring the Subgrade to the required line,
 grade, and cross-section. The Contractor shall compact the Subgrade to a depth of 6 inches
 to 95 percent of maximum density as determined by the compaction control tests for granular
 materials. The compacted area shall be wide enough to let paving machines operate without
 visible distortion of surfacing material.
 The Contractor shall maintain the Subgrade in the required condition until the pavement
 is placed. The Contractor may remove material just before paving if the Plans require thicker
 areas of pavement.

 2-06.5(1)  Subgrade Constructed Under Same Contract
 Surfacing or Treated Base – If the Contractor builds a Subgrade for surfacing or treated
 base, the Contracting Agency will consider Subgrade preparation as part of the construction
 Work. In this case, measurement and payment will conform to Section 2-03. Such payment
 shall be the full price for all Subgrade preparation Work.
 Pavement – If the Contractor builds a Subgrade for pavement, the Contracting Agency will
 follow the criteria in Section 5-04 (for HMA pavement) or Section 5-05 (for cement concrete
 pavement) to measure and pay for materials used to prepare the Subgrade. The Contracting
 Agency will measure and pay for water as specified in Section 2-07.

 Structure Excavation
 
 2-09.3(1)E  Backfilling
 The backfilling of openings dug for Structures shall be a necessary part of and incidental
 to the excavation. Unless the Engineer directs otherwise, backfill material shall be nonclay
 material containing no pieces more than 3 inches across, no frozen lumps, and no wood or
 other foreign material.
 When specified in the Contract or when approved by the Engineer, the Contractor shall
 supply controlled density fill as backfill material.
 Alternative Sources. When material from Structure excavation is unsuitable for use
 as backfill, the Engineer may require the Contractor to:
 1.	 Use other material covered by the Contract if such substitution involves Work that
 does not differ materially from what would otherwise have been required,
 2.	 Substitute selected material in accordance with Section 2-03.3(10),
 3.	 Use Controlled Density Fill (CDF) also known as Controlled Low Strength Material
 (CLSM)), or
 4.	 Obtain material elsewhere. Material obtained elsewhere will be paid for in accordance
 with Section 1-04.4.
 Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low-Strength Material (CLSM) – CDF
 is a self compacting, cementitious, flowable material requiring no subsequent vibration or
 tamping to achieve consolidation. The Contractor shall provide a mix design in writing to the
 Engineer on WSDOT Form 350-040 and utilize ACI 229 as a guide to develop the CDF mix
 design. No CDF shall be placed until the Engineer has reviewed the mix design. CDF shall be
 designed to have a minimum 28-day strength of 50 psi and a maximum 28-day strength not to
 exceed 300 psi. The CDF consistency shall be flowable (approximate slump 3 to 10 inches).
 The following testing methods shall be used by the Contractor to develop the CDF mix design:
 	 28-day compressive strength – ASTM D4832;
 	 Unit weight, yield, and air content – ASTM D6023;
 	 Slump – FOP for AASHTO T 119.
 The water/cement ratio shall be calculated on the total weight of cementitious material.
 Cementitious materials are those listed in Section 5-05.2.
 Admixtures used in CDF shall meet the requirements of Section 9-23.6, Admixtures
 for Concrete, and foaming agents, if used, shall meet the requirements of ASTM C869.
 Admixtures shall be used in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations and
 non‑chloride accelerating admixtures may be used to accelerate the hardening of CDF.
 CDF shall meet the requirement of Section 6-02.3(5)C and shall be accepted based on
 a Certificate of Compliance. The producer shall provide a Certificate of Compliance for each
 truckload of CDF in accordance with Section 6-02.3(5)B.
 Stockpiling – The Engineer may require the Contractor to selectively remove and stockpile
 any usable material excavated for a Structure. If this material meets the requirements for
 gravel backfill for walls it may replace gravel as wall or abutment backfill.
 If the Contractor stockpiles excavated material for use as backfill, it shall be protected with
 plastic sheeting or by some other method from contamination and weather damage. If the
 material becomes too wet or contaminated in the stockpile, the Contractor shall dispose of
 and replace it with an equal amount of suitable material, all at no expense to the Contracting
 Agency. All costs for storing, protecting, rehandling, and placing stockpiled material shall
 be included in the unit Contract price for Structure excavation, Class A or B.
 Compaction – Backfill from Structure excavation shall be placed and compacted
 in keeping with the following requirements:
 1.	 Backfill supporting Roadbed, Roadway embankments, or Structures, including
 backfill providing lateral support for noise barrier wall foundations, luminaire poles,
 traffic signal standards, and roadside and overhead sign Structure foundations shall
 be placed in horizontal layers no more than 6 inches thick with each layer compacted
 Page 2-30
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Structure Excavation
 
 2-09
 
 to 95 percent of the maximum density determined by the Compaction Control Test
 according to Section 2-03.3(14)D.
 2.	 Gravel backfill for drains shall be placed in horizontal layers no more than 12 inches
 thick, with each layer compacted by at least three passes of a vibratory compactor
 approved by the Engineer.
 3.	 All other structure excavation backfill shall be placed in layers no more than 2 feet thick
 (loose), with each layer tamped and graded so that final settling will leave the backfill
 flush with surrounding ground.
 4.	 Compaction of controlled density fill will not be required.
 Timing – Backfill shall not be placed against any concrete Structure until the concrete has
 attained 90 percent of its design strength and a minimum age of 14 days, except that reinforced
 concrete retaining walls 15 feet in height or less may be backfilled after the wall has attained
 90 percent of its design compressive strength and curing requirements of Section 6-02.3(11)
 are met. Footings and columns may be backfilled as soon as forms have been removed, so long
 as the backfill is brought up evenly on all sides.
 The Engineer may order the Contractor to use lean concrete in backfilling around piers
 and in front of abutments and walls. The Contracting Agency will pay for such backfilling
 as provided in Section 1-04.4.
 If water prevents the Contractor from properly placing and compacting backfill, it shall
 be removed by pumping or other means.
 All costs not defined in this section that relate to providing, placing, and compacting
 backfill shall be at the Contractor’s expense.
 2-09.3(1)F  Items to Remain
 If the Contractor damages or removes pavement or anything else meant to remain outside
 the excavation area, it shall be repaired or replaced at no expense to the Contracting Agency.

 4.	 Maintain water depth and horizontal clearances required for traffic to pass on navigable
 streams, furnishing any channel signals or lights required during construction.
 5.	 Place riprap around the outside of cofferdams, as specified, to repair local scour.
 2-09.3(3)B  Excavation Using Open Pits – Extra Excavation
 The Contractor may dig open pits or perform extra excavation without shoring or
 cofferdams, if:
 1.	 Footings can be placed in dry material away from running water.
 2.	 The integrity of the completed Structure and its surroundings is not reduced.
 3.	 Worker safety is ensured as required by law.
 4.	 The excavation does not disturb the existing pavement or any other adjacent
 structural elements.
 If a slide occurs in an open pit, the Contractor shall remove the slide material. If the
 slide disturbs an area over which a Highway will be built, the Contractor shall backfill and
 compact the site to the original ground line as approved by the Engineer. If the slide damages
 an existing facility such as a Roadway or Structure, the Contractor shall repair the damage
 caused by the slide. The Contractor shall pay all costs related to removing slide material and
 restoring the slide area, including the repair of any pavement or structural elements damaged
 by the slide.
 The Contractor shall drain or pump any water from the pit, taking care not to stir up or
 soften the bottom. If equipment in the pit or inadequate water removal makes the foundation
 material unstable, the Contractor shall, at no expense to the Contracting Agency, remove and
 replace it with material acceptable to the Engineer.
 When the Engineer believes ground water flow may impair a concrete footing, the
 Contractor shall place under it a layer of gravel at least 6 inches thick. Before placing the
 gravel, the Contractor shall excavate to whatever grade the Engineer requires. This provision
 shall not apply to the building of concrete seals.
 The Contractor may omit forms when the earthen sides of a footing excavation will stand
 vertically. In this case, the Contractor may excavate to the neat line dimensions of the footing
 and pour concrete against the undisturbed earth. If the hole is larger than neat line dimensions,
 the Contractor shall bear the cost of the extra concrete.
 For open temporary cuts, the following requirements shall be met:
 1.	 No vehicular or construction traffic, or construction surcharge loads will be allowed
 within a distance of 5 feet from the top of the cut.
 2.	 Exposed soil along the slope shall be protected from surface erosion.

 location of adjacent traffic; and
 7.	 A monitoring plan to evaluate the excavation performance throughout its design life.
 2-09.3(3)C  Preparation for Placing Foundations
 When a foundation will rest on rock, excavation shall penetrate it at least 1 foot, or more
 if the Plans require, to form a key for the footing. The Contractor shall cut the bottom of the
 excavation to a firm surface, level, stepped, or serrated as the Engineer directs, and remove
 all loose material.
 For an arch abutment, the back face shall be trimmed to true lines so that concrete can
 be poured against undisturbed material.
 If concrete will rest on any excavated surface other than solid rock, the Contractor shall
 not disturb the bottom of the excavation. The Contractor shall also remove all loose or soft
 material just before pouring the concrete.
 Upon completing any foundation excavation, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer.
 No concrete or other permanent part of the Structure may be placed until the Engineer has
 given permission to proceed.
 2-09.3(3)D  Shoring and Cofferdams
 Definitions – Structural shoring is defined as a shoring system that is installed prior to
 excavation. Structural shoring shall provide lateral support of soils and limit lateral movement
 of soils supporting Structures, Roadways, utilities, railroads, etc., such that these items are not
 damaged as a result of the lateral movement of the supporting soils.
 Structural shoring systems includes driven cantilever sheet piles, sheet piles with tiebacks,
 sheet pile cofferdams with wale rings or struts, prestressed spud piles, cantilever soldier piles
 with lagging, soldier piles with lagging and tiebacks, and multiple tier tieback systems.
 Trench boxes, sliding trench shields, jacked shores, shoring systems that are installed after
 excavation, and soldier pile, sheet pile, or similar shoring walls installed in front of a preexcavated slope, are not allowed as structural shoring.
 A cofferdam is any watertight enclosure, sealed at the bottom and designed for the
 dewatering operation, that surrounds the excavated area of a Structure. The Contractor shall
 use steel sheet pile or interlocking steel pile cofferdams in all excavation that is under water
 or affected by ground water.
 Submittals and Design Requirements – The Contractor shall submit Type 2E Working
 Drawings with supporting calculations showing the proposed methods and construction details
 of structural shoring or cofferdams in accordance with Sections 1-05.3 and 6-02.3(16).
 Structural shoring and cofferdams shall be designed for conditions stated in this section
 using methods shown in Division I Section 5 of the AASHTO Standard Specifications for
 Highway Bridges Seventeenth Edition – 2002 for allowable stress design, or the AASHTO
 LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, Third Edition, 2004 and current interims for load and
 resistance factor design. The USS Steel Sheet Piling Design Manuals, published by United
 States Steel, may be used for shoring walls that do not support other Structures and that
 are 15 feet in height or less. Allowable stresses for materials shall not exceed stresses and

 conditions allowed by Section 6-02.3(17)B. The shoring design shall also be in compliance
 with the WSDOT Geotechnical Design Manual M 46-03. In the case of conflict or discrepancy
 between manuals, the WSDOT Geotechnical Design Manual M 46-03 shall govern.
 For open temporary cuts associated with a shoring system, the requirements for open
 temporary cuts specified in Section 2-09.3(3)B shall be met.
 The structural shoring system shall be designed for site specific conditions which shall be
 shown and described in the Working Drawings. The structural shoring system design shall
 include the design of the slopes for stability above and below the shoring system. Except
 as otherwise noted, the design height of all structural shoring in design calculations and
 Working Drawings shall be for the depth of excavation as required by the Plans, plus an
 additional 2 feet to account for the possibility of overexcavation. If the Contractor provides
 written documentation to the satisfaction of the Engineer that the soil conditions at the site
 are not likely to require overexcavation, the Engineer may waive the requirement for 2 feet
 of overexcavation design height.
 Examples of such items that shall be shown on the structural shoring submittal and
 supported by calculations include, but are not limited to, the following:
 1.	 Heights; soil slopes; soil benches; and controlling cross sections showing adjacent
 existing foundations, utilities, site constraints, and any surcharge loading conditions

 Structure Excavation
 
 2-09
 
 Existing foundations shall be supported with structural shoring if the excavation is within
 the limits defined by a plane which extends out from the nearest edge of the existing footing
 a level distance of ½ the width of the existing footing and then down a slope of 1.5:1.
 When structural shoring or cofferdams are utilized, all excavation and structural shoring
 shall be constructed in accordance with the processed structural shoring submittal, including
 any required construction sequence noted in the Working Drawings. The Contractor shall
 remain responsible for satisfactory results.
 If soldier piles are placed in drilled holes, and lagging is installed concurrently with the
 excavation, all backfill above the bottom of the lagging shall consist of controlled-density
 fill or lean concrete. Backfill below the bottom of the lagging may consist of pea gravel.
 If full-height steel sheet lagging is installed prior to excavation, soldier pile holes may
 be backfilled with pea gravel.
 If lagging is used, void space behind the lagging shall be minimized. If the Engineer
 determines that the voids present could result in damage or serviceability problems for the
 structural shoring system or any Structures or facilities adjacent to the structural shoring
 system, the Contractor shall cease excavation and lagging installation, and shall fill the voids
 specified by the Engineer in accordance with the approved structural shoring submittal.
 Further excavation and lagging placement shall not continue until the specified voids are
 filled to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 Excavation shall not proceed ahead of lagging installation by more than 4 feet or by
 the height that the soil will safely stand, whichever is least. For tieback shoring systems,
 excavation shall not proceed ahead by more than 4 feet of the tie installation and proof testing.
 In using cofferdams or structural shoring, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Extend cofferdams well below the bottom of the excavation, and embed structural
 shoring as shown in the structural shoring submittal as approved by the Engineer.
 2.	 Provide enough clearance for constructing forms, inspecting concrete exteriors, and
 pumping water that collects outside the forms. If cofferdams tilt or move laterally
 during placement, the Contractor, at no expense to the Contracting Agency, shall
 straighten or enlarge them to provide the required clearance.
 3.	 Secure the cofferdam in place to prevent tipping or movement.
 4.	 Place structural shoring or cofferdams so that they will not interfere with any pile
 driving required.
 5.	 Not place any shoring, braces, or kickers inside the cofferdams and structural shoring
 that will induce stress, shock, or vibration to the permanent Structure.
 6.	 Vent cofferdams at the elevation commensurate with seal weight design, or as shown
 in the Plans.
 7.	 Remove all bracing extending into the concrete being placed.
 When the Work is completed, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Remove all structural shoring to at least 2 feet below the finished ground line.
 2.	 Remove all cofferdams to the natural bed of the waterway.
 2-09.3(3)E  Bearing Tests
 The Engineer may stop the excavation to make bearing tests at any time. The Contractor
 shall assist with these tests in any way the Engineer requires.
 During any test period, the Contractor shall, at no expense to the Contracting Agency,
 maintain ordinary working conditions at the bottom of the hole. The Contracting Agency
 will pay force account for all labor and materials the Contractor supplies for such tests.
 A single test shall not exceed 72 hours.

 Structure Excavation
 
 2-09.3(4)  Construction Requirements, Structure Excavation, Class B
 The above requirements for Structure excavation Class A, shall apply also to Structure
 excavation Class B, except as revised below. In addition, the Contractor shall follow
 Division 7 of these Specifications as it applies to the specific kinds of Work.
 The hole for any catch basin or manhole shall provide at least 1 foot of clearance between
 outside structural surfaces and the undisturbed earth bank.
 If workers enter any trench or other excavation 4 feet or more in depth that does not meet
 the open pit requirements of Section 2-09.3(3)B, it shall be shored or other safety method
 constructed in conformance with WISHA requirements. The Contractor alone shall be
 responsible for worker safety and the Contracting Agency assumes no responsibility.
 The Contractor shall submit Type 2E Working Drawings in accordance with
 Section 2-09.3(3)D.
 Trench boxes may be used for Structure excavation, Class B. Acceptance of trench boxes
 as a shoring method for Class B Structure excavation can be done by the Engineer provided
 it is not used to support adjacent traffic, existing footings, or other Structures. The Working
 Drawing submittal shall include the manufacturer’s certified trench box plans with depth
 restrictions, and the serial number for field verification of the trench box.
 Upon completing the Work, the Contractor shall remove all shoring unless the Plans
 or the Engineer direct otherwise.
 2-09.4  Measurement
 Excavated materials will be measured in their original position by the cubic yard. The
 Contracting Agency will measure and pay for only the material excavated from inside the
 limits this section defines. If the Contractor excavates outside these limits or performs extra
 excavation as described in Section 2-09.3(3)B, it shall be considered for the Contractor’s
 benefit and shall be included in the cost of other Bid items.
 Horizontal Limits – The Contracting Agency will use the sides of the trench or pit
 as horizontal limits in measuring excavation. No payment for Structure excavation will
 be made for material removed (1) more than 1 foot outside the perimeter of any pile cap,
 footing, or seal; (2) more than 3 feet beyond the Roadway side of a wing wall; (3) more
 than 1 foot beyond the other sides and end of a wing wall; (4) more than 1 foot outside
 the perimeter of the soil reinforcement area for geosynthetic and structural earth walls; and
 (5) more than 4-feet beyond the inside opening of precast reinforced concrete box culverts
 and precast reinforced concrete split box culverts. For precast reinforced concrete three sided
 structures, no payment for Structure excavation will be made for material removed more than
 1 foot outside the perimeter of the footing or more than 4 feet beyond the inside opening,
 whichever is greater.
 For all pipes, pipe arches, structural plate pipes, and underpasses, the Structure excavation
 quantity will be calculated based on the following trench widths:
 For drain and underdrain pipes, trench width = I.D. + 12 inches.
 For pipes 15 inches and under, trench width = I.D. + 30 inches.
 For pipes 18 inches and over, trench width = (1.5 × I.D.) + 18 inches.
 For a manhole, catch basin, grate inlet, or drop inlet, the limits will be 1 foot outside the
 perimeter of the Structure.
 For drywells, the limits shall be in accordance with the Standard Plans.
 Lower Limits – For a pile cap, footing, or seal, the bottom elevation shown in the Plans,
 or set by the Engineer, will serve as the lower limit in measuring Structure excavation. For a
 wing wall, the lower limit will follow a line parallel to the bottom and 1 foot below it. Any
 swell from pile driving will be excluded from excavation quantities.
 For pipelines the lower limit in measuring structure excavation will be the foundation level
 as shown in the Plans or as directed by the Engineer.

 sanitary sewer, manholes, and catch basins, will be measured by the cubic yard in place
 determined by the neat lines required by the Plans.
 Shoring or Extra Excavation – No specific unit of measurement shall apply to the lump
 sum item of shoring or extra excavation Class A. Shoring or extra excavation Class B will
 be measured by the square foot as follows:
 The area for payment will be one vertical plane measured along the centerline of the
 trench, including Structures. Measurement will be made from the existing ground line to the
 bottom of the excavation and for the length of the Work actually performed. If the Contract
 includes a pay item for grading to remove materials, the upper limit for measurement will be
 the neat lines of the grading section shown in the Plans. The bottom elevation for measurement
 will be the bottom of the excavation as shown in the Plans or as otherwise established by
 the Engineer.
 Controlled density fill will be measured by the cubic yard for the quantity of material
 placed in accordance with the producer’s invoice.

 2-12  Construction Geosynthetic
 2-12.1 Description
 The Contractor shall furnish and place construction geosynthetic in accordance with the
 details shown in the Plans.
 2-12.2 Materials
 Materials shall meet the requirements of the following section:
 	 Construction Geosynthetic	
 9-33
 Geosynthetic roll identification, storage, and handling shall be in conformance to
 ASTM D4873. During periods of shipment and storage, the geosynthetic shall be stored off
 the ground. The geosynthetic shall be covered at all times during shipment and storage such
 that it is fully protected from ultraviolet radiation including sunlight, site construction damage,
 precipitation, chemicals that are strong acids or strong bases, flames including welding sparks,
 temperatures in excess of 160ºF, and any other environmental condition that may damage the
 physical property values of the geosynthetic.
 Unless specified otherwise in the Plans, the geotextile required for underground drainage
 shall be “Moderate Survivability” and “Drainage Class C” and permanent erosion control
 applications shall be “High Survivability” and “Drainage Class C”.
 2-12.3  Construction Requirements
 The area to be covered by the geosynthetic shall be graded to a smooth, uniform condition
 free from ruts, potholes, and protruding objects such as rocks or sticks. The geosynthetic
 shall be spread immediately ahead of the covering operation. The geosynthetic shall not be
 left exposed to sunlight during installation for a total of more than 14 calendar days. The
 geosynthetic shall be laid smooth without excessive wrinkles. Under no circumstances shall
 the geosynthetic be dragged through mud or over sharp objects which could damage the
 geosynthetic. The cover material shall be placed on the geosynthetic such that the minimum
 initial lift thickness required will be between the equipment tires or tracks and the geosynthetic
 at all times. Construction vehicles shall be limited in size and weight, to reduce rutting in the
 initial lift above the geosynthetic, to not greater than 3 inches deep to prevent overstressing the
 geosynthetic. Turning of vehicles on the first lift above the geosynthetic will not be permitted.
 Soil piles or the manufacturer’s recommended method, shall be used as needed to hold the
 geosynthetic in place until the specified cover material is placed.
 Should the geosynthetic be torn, punctured, or the overlaps or sewn joints disturbed,
 as evidenced by visible geosynthetic damage, Subgrade pumping, intrusion, or Roadbed
 distortion, the backfill around the damaged or displaced area shall be removed and the
 damaged area repaired or replaced by the Contractor at no expense to the Contracting Agency.
 The repair shall consist of a patch of the same type of geosynthetic placed over the damaged
 area. The patch shall overlap the existing geosynthetic from the edge of any part of the
 damaged area by the minimum required overlap for the application.
 If geotextile seams are to be sewn in the field or at the factory, the seams shall consist
 of one row of stitching unless the geotextile where the seam is to be sewn does not have a
 selvage edge. If a selvage edge is not present, the seams shall consist of two parallel rows of
 stitching, or shall consist of a J-seam, Type SSn-1, using a single row of stitching. The two
 rows of stitching shall be 1.0 inch apart with a tolerance of plus or minus 0.5 inch and shall
 not cross except for restitching. The stitching shall be a lock-type stitch. The minimum seam
 allowance, i.e., the minimum distance from the geotextile edge to the stitch line nearest to
 that edge, shall be 1½ inches if a flat or prayer seam, Type SSa-2, is used. The minimum seam
 allowance for all other seam types shall be 1.0 inch. The seam, stitch type, and the equipment
 used to perform the stitching shall be as recommended by the manufacturer of the geotextile
 and as approved by the Engineer.
 The seams shall be sewn in such a manner that the seam can be inspected readily by the
 Engineer or a representative. The seam strength will be tested and shall meet the requirements
 stated herein.

 Construction Geosynthetic
 
 2-12.3(1)  Underground Drainage
 Trench walls shall be smooth and stable. The geotextile shall be placed in a manner
 which will ensure intimate contact between the soil and the geotextile (i.e., no voids, folds,
 or wrinkles).
 The geotextile shall either be overlapped a minimum of 12 inches at all longitudinal and
 transverse joints, or the geotextile joints shall be sewn for medium survivability drainage
 applications. In those cases where the trench width is less than 12 inches, the minimum
 overlap shall be the trench width.
 In moderate survivability geotextile underdrain applications, the minimum overlap shall
 be 12 inches, or the geotextile joints shall be sewn, except where the geotextile is used in
 area drains. An area drain is defined as a geotextile layer placed over or under a horizontal
 to moderately sloping layer of drainage aggregate. For area drains, the geotextile shall be
 overlapped a minimum of 2 feet at all longitudinal and transverse joints, or the geotextile
 joints shall be sewn together. The minimum initial lift thickness over the geotextile in the
 area drain shall be 12 inches.
 In all cases, the upstream geotextile sheet shall overlap the next downstream sheet.
 2-12.3(2) Separation
 The geotextile shall either be overlapped a minimum of 2 feet at all longitudinal and
 transverse joints, or the geotextile joints shall be sewn together. The initial lift thickness
 shall be 6 inches or more.
 2-12.3(3)  Soil Stabilization
 The geotextile shall either be overlapped a minimum, of 2 feet at all longitudinal and
 transverse joints, or the geotextile shall be sewn together. The initial lift thickness shall be
 12 inches or more. Compaction of the first lift above the geotextile shall be by Method A
 according to Section 2-03.3(14)C. No vibratory compaction will be allowed on the first lift.
 2-12.3(4)  Permanent Erosion Control and Ditch Lining
 Unless otherwise shown in the Plans, the geotextile shall either be overlapped a minimum
 of 2 feet at all longitudinal and transverse joints, or the geotextile joints shall be sewn together.
 If overlapped, the geotextile shall be placed so that the upstream strip of geotextile will
 overlap the next downstream strip. When placed on slopes, each strip shall overlap the next
 downhill strip.
 Placement of aggregate and riprap or other cover material on the geotextile shall start at
 the toe of the slope and proceed upwards. The geotextile shall be keyed at the top and the
 toe of the slope as shown in the Plans. The geotextile shall be secured to the slope, but shall
 be secured loosely enough so that the geotextile will not tear when the riprap or other cover
 material is placed on the geotextile. The geotextile shall not be keyed at the top of the slope
 until the riprap or other cover material is in place to the top of the slope.
 All voids in the riprap or other cover material that allow the geotextile to be visible shall
 be backfilled with quarry spalls or other small stones, as designated by the Engineer, so that
 the geotextile is completely covered. When an aggregate cushion between the geotextile and
 the riprap or other cover material is required, it shall have a minimum thickness of 12 inches.
 An aggregate cushion will be required to facilitate drainage when hand placed riprap,
 as specified in Section 9-13.1(4), is used with the geotextile.
 Grading of slopes after placement of the riprap or other cover material will not be allowed
 if grading results in stone movement directly on the geotextile. Under no circumstances shall
 stones with a weight of more than 100 pounds be allowed to roll down slope. Stones shall
 not be dropped from a height greater than 3 feet above the geotextile surface if an aggregate
 cushion is present, or 1 foot if a cushion is not present. Lower drop heights may be required if
 geotextile damage from the stones is evident, as determined by the Engineer. If the geotextile
 is placed on slopes steeper than 2:1, the stones shall be placed on the slope without free-fall
 for moderate survivability, high survivability, and ditch lining geotextiles.

 Aggregate Production
 and Acceptance
 
 3-01  Production From Quarry and Pit Sites
 3-01.1 Description
 This Work shall consist of manufacturing and producing crushed and screened aggregates
 including pit run aggregates of the kind, quality, and grading specified for use in the
 construction of portland cement concrete, hot mix asphalt, crushed surfacing, maintenance
 rock, ballast, gravel base, gravel backfill, gravel borrow, riprap, and bituminous surface
 treatments of all descriptions.
 The requirements specified shall apply whether the source is ledge rock, talus, gravel,
 sand, or any combination thereof.
 3-01.2  Material Sources, General Requirements
 3-01.2(1)  Approval of Source
 Material sources must be approved in advance of use in the Work in accordance with the
 requirements of Section 1-06. This approval of source may require sampling and testing.
 If sampling is required, the samples must be taken at locations designated and witnessed
 by the Engineer or a designated representative. The Contractor is responsible for providing
 representative preliminary samples of aggregate sources to the Engineer.
 3-01.2(2)  Preparation of Site
 The portion of the quarry or pit site to be used shall be cleared and grubbed, and the
 area from which materials are to be taken shall be stripped of overburden as provided in
 Section 3-01.2(3). All combustible debris resulting from these operations shall be disposed
 of by the Contractor in a manner satisfactory to the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall provide sufficient space as required for the setup and operation
 of the Contracting Agency’s field testing facilities at the site of crushing or hot mix
 asphalt production.
 As directed by the Engineer, the Contractor shall provide one of the following to ensure
 24-hour per day operation of the Contracting Agency’s laboratory trailer(s) that may be set
 up at the site during production:
 1.	 A power source and a power cord of sufficient length to reach the Contracting Agency’s
 laboratory trailer(s) which may be set up at the site. The cord shall be capable of
 carrying at least 120/240 volts, 60 cycles at a sustained load of up to 200 amps. The
 cord and trailer(s) electrical hookup shall meet the NEC code. Power shall be provided
 and connected when requested by the Engineer. The laboratory trailer(s) hookup shall
 be protected by a 2 pole 50 amp 240 VAC circuit breaker.
 2.	 A daily supply of fuel adequate for operation of the Contracting Agency’s generator(s).
 Potable water shall be provided to the Contracting Agency’s laboratory trailer(s) for use
 during plant operations when requested by the Engineer.
 3-01.2(3)  Stripping Quarries and Pits
 Stripping of quarries and pits shall consist of the removal, after clearing and grubbing,
 of the surface material and overburden which is unsuitable for the kind of material to be
 borrowed or produced for use. Materials from stripping, to be used later as provided on the
 site reclamation plan specified in Section 3-03, shall be deposited within the quarry or pit
 site at such a location as not to interfere with future development within the site.
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 Production From Quarry and Pit Sites
 
 3-01.2(4)  Production Requirements
 All oversize stones, rock fragments, or boulders occurring in the source, up to and
 including those measuring 18 inches in the greatest dimension, shall be utilized in the
 manufacture of crushed material.
 If the grading or quality of raw material in sources used for the manufacture of products
 covered by this section is such that the fracture, grading, or quality of the product specified
 cannot be obtained by utilizing the natural material, fine portions of the raw material shall
 be rejected to the extent necessary to produce products meeting all requirements of these
 Specifications. Failure of the Contracting Agency to include a scalping requirement in
 the Special Provisions shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for rejecting
 fine portions of the material if such becomes necessary to produce products meeting all
 requirements of these Specifications. Scalping shall be performed after the pit-run or
 quarry‑run material has passed through the primary crusher.
 When scalping over a screen of a specified size is required in the Special Provisions,
 the scalping screen shall be of such size and capacity that enough of the fine material will
 be removed to produce Work that conforms to the Specifications.
 Washing and reclaiming of the reject material and subsequent addition of this material
 to any finished products will not be allowed unless specifically authorized in writing by
 the Engineer.
 Surplus screenings accumulated during the crushing and screening of specified Roadway
 materials will be considered separate and distinct from reject material resulting from
 scalping operations.
 Both fine and coarse concrete aggregates shall be thoroughly washed in order to remove
 clay, loam, alkali, bark, sticks, organic castings, or other deleterious matter. Washing will be
 required in the production of other materials if necessary to produce products meeting all the
 quality requirements of these Specifications.
 When producing screened gravel or sand materials, the Contractor shall remove all
 oversize material by screening at the pit site. The Contractor’s operations in the pit shall be
 conducted so that the grading of individual loads will be reasonably uniform. In general,
 the Contractor shall utilize the most suitable materials available and shall make as many
 moves of the loading equipment as may be necessary to fulfill these requirements.
 Where pit-run materials meet Specifications, screening or processing will not be required.
 3-01.2(5)  Final Cleanup
 Upon completion of the Contractor’s operation, the quarry or pit shall be cleared of all
 rubbish, temporary Structures, and equipment, and shall be left in a neat and presentable
 condition. The pit or quarry shall be reclaimed in accordance with the approved site
 reclamation plan specified in Section 3-03.
 3-01.3  State Furnished Material Sources
 Unless specified in the Special Provisions, no Contracting Agency material sources are
 provided and the Contractor shall bear full responsibility for furnishing all materials.
 3-01.3(1)  Quality and Extent of Material
 Contracting Agency furnished material sources will be shown in the Plans and described
 in the Special Provisions. The quality of material in such sources will be acceptable in
 general, but the Contractor shall determine the amount of Work required to produce the
 material meeting these Specifications. It shall be understood that it is not feasible to ascertain
 from samples, the limits for an entire source, and that variations shall be considered as usual
 and are to be expected. The Engineer may order procurement of material from any portion
 of a source and may reject portions of the source as unacceptable.
 Since many material sources are acquired in fee by the Contracting Agency for use on
 future projects as well as for this Contract, it is in the public interest to preserve the future
 Page 3-2
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Production From Quarry and Pit Sites
 
 3-01
 
 usefulness and adequacy of a source insofar as may be practical. To achieve this end, the
 Contractor shall not perform any Work within the source until receiving the Engineer’s
 approval of the Contractor’s work plan within the limits of the source.
 3-01.3(2)  When More Than One Site is Provided
 When more than one quarry or pit site is provided in the Special Provisions, the Contractor
 may obtain material from any of the sources. The Contracting Agency will specify the quantity
 of raw material available, as determined by tests, in each quarry or pit site. If the Contractor
 sets up in a site, and it is found that the quantity of raw material from that site, when the site
 is exhausted, is less than that specified by the Contracting Agency, then the provisions of
 Section 3-01.3(5) will apply.
 3-01.3(3)  Reject Materials
 All scalpings that are unsatisfactory for use under these Specifications or Special
 Provisions shall be considered as reject material, subject to disposal as approved by the
 Engineer. Reject material shall be placed at such a location as not to interfere with future
 development within the site.
 3-01.3(4)  Surplus Screenings
 The surplus screenings accumulated during the production of the specified materials shall
 be stockpiled at a location within the site provided and become the property of the Contracting
 Agency. The stockpile site shall be prepared and constructed by the Contractor in accordance
 with the provisions of Section 3-02. All costs incurred in producing, hauling, and stockpiling
 the surplus screenings shall be incidental to the production of the specified materials and shall
 be included by the Contractor in the unit Bid prices in the Contract.
 3-01.3(5)  Moving Plant
 If, in the opinion of the Engineer, there should be insufficient suitable material in any
 quarry or pit site made available by the Contracting Agency, the Contracting Agency will
 acquire at its expense an additional source, in which event the Contractor will be required
 to move the crushing plant to the new quarry or site. Under such conditions, payment for
 the Contractor’s costs for the move will be made on a force account basis. Payment will be
 limited to the labor, equipment, and materials required for the move, and no allowance will
 be made for payment of standby costs for the crushing plant nor other equipment which may
 be temporarily idle as a result of the move.
 The clearing, grubbing, and preparing of the new quarries or pit sites as specified
 in Section 3-01.2(2) will be paid for in the manner provided in these Specifications for
 “Clearing”, “Grubbing”, and “Stripping Including Haul”. If there is no Bid item applicable,
 the payment for the preparation of the new site will be as provided in Section 1-04.4.
 If the moving of the plant due to shortage of the supply of material necessitates a longer
 haul on materials than required from the original source, the Contracting Agency will
 reimburse the Contractor for the additional haul at the rate of $0.25 per ton-mile haul. The
 unit ton-mile shall be the equivalent of 1 ton of material hauled a distance of 1 mile. The haul
 distance will be measured in ½-mile units, fractional half-miles being allowed as full halfmiles. If the requirement for moving of the crushing plant results in a delay of performance
 of Work which is critical to completion of the project, as shown by the Contractor’s approved
 progress schedule, the Engineer will authorize a suspension of Work for the time required for
 the move.
 The above allowances, insofar as they may be applicable, shall be full pay for all claims
 of any kind or description by reason of the necessity of changing from one site to another
 due to shortage of the supply from sources made available by the Contracting Agency. Before
 moving a crushing plant as outlined above, the Contractor shall secure from the Engineer an
 order in writing to do so. Should the Contractor fail to secure such order, it shall be considered
 sufficient proof that the move was immaterial insofar as to cost, and no allowance or pay will
 be made by reason of such move.

 3-01.4  Contractor Furnished Material Sources
 3-01.4(1)  Acquisition and Development
 If, under the terms of the Contract, the Contractor is required to provide a source of
 materials, or if the Contractor elects to use materials from sources other than those provided
 by the Contracting Agency, the Contractor shall, at no expense to the Contracting Agency,
 make all necessary arrangements for obtaining the material and shall ensure the quantity of
 suitable material is available. Preliminary samples shall be taken by or in the presence of the
 Engineer or a designated representative unless the Engineer permits otherwise. Approval of
 the source does not relieve the Contractor from meeting these Specification requirements,
 nor does it guarantee that the material will meet these requirements without additional or
 proper processing. The Engineer may require additional preliminary samples at any time.
 Approval of a Contractor’s source offered in lieu of a Contracting Agency-provided source
 will be contingent upon the material therein being of equal quality, and no additional costs
 will accrue to the Contracting Agency as a result of such approval. Equivalency of quality
 will be based on those test values listed in the Special Provisions as being representative of
 material in the Contracting Agency-provided source. If no such values are listed, the minimum
 Specification requirements will apply. When measurement by weight is specified and when
 the specific gravity of material produced from the Contractor’s source is greater than that from
 the Contracting Agency-furnished source, any additional material required to construct the
 minimum specified surfacing depth shall be furnished by the Contractor at no expense to the
 Contracting Agency.
 The Contractor shall notify the State Departments of Ecology, Fish and Wildlife, and
 Natural Resources, in writing, of the intent to furnish the source, and shall, at no expense
 to the Contracting Agency, make all necessary arrangements with these agencies for the
 determinations of regulations which might be imposed upon the Contractor during removal
 of materials from the source.
 The source shall be selected so that, after the materials have been removed, the pit will
 drain to a natural drainage course and no ponding will result. Should the source selected by
 the Contractor be one which would not drain as outlined herein, permission shall be obtained
 by the Contractor from the governing body of the city or county for the removal of materials
 from the pit or quarry.
 The Contractor will not be permitted to operate a pit or a quarry site visible from a State
 Highway unless it can be demonstrated to the complete satisfaction of the Engineer that no
 unsightly condition will result from or remain as a result of the Contractor’s operations. If, in
 the opinion of the Engineer, unsightly conditions exist after removal of materials from the site,
 the Contractor shall correct such unsightly conditions as hereinafter provided.
 Following removal of materials from the pit, the entire site shall be cleared of all rubbish,
 temporary Structures, and equipment which have resulted from the Contractor’s occupancy
 and operations. The Contractor shall obliterate or screen to the satisfaction of the Engineer
 any unsightly conditions that remain. The Contractor shall secure a written release from the
 permitter upon fulfillment of these requirements. All costs for cleaning up the pit site and
 for the installation or erection of screening or for other work required to correct unsightly
 conditions shall be at the Contractor’s expense. The requirements of this paragraph shall
 not apply to pits being operated commercially.
 All costs in connection with acquiring the rights to take materials from the source, for
 exploring and developing the site, for complying with the regulations of the aforesaid State
 agencies, for preparing the site as provided in Sections 3-01.2(2) and 3-03, for cleaning up
 the site, and for correcting unsightly conditions, shall be included in the unit Contract prices
 for the various pay items of Work involved.

 Provided by the Contracting Agency
 If the Contractor elects to substitute a gravel deposit of an approved source for the
 manufacture of ballast, crushed surfacing, or mineral aggregate in lieu of a ledge rock or talus
 source provided by the Contracting Agency in the Contract, all pit run materials passing a
 ½-inch-square sieve, or larger if ordered by the Engineer, shall be removed prior to crushing.
 3-01.4(4)  Gravel Base
 If the Contract requires the Contractor to provide the source of Gravel Base, or if the
 Contractor elects to furnish said material from sources other than those provided by the
 Contracting Agency, the material shall be produced from approved sources in accordance

 height shall be limited to a maximum of 24 feet.
 Stockpiles in excess of 200 cubic yards shall be built up in layers not more than 4 feet in
 depth. Stockpile layers shall be constructed by trucks, clamshells, or other methods approved
 by the Engineer. Pushing aggregates into piles with a bulldozer will not be permitted. Each
 layer shall be completed over the entire area of the pile before depositing aggregates in the
 succeeding layer. The aggregate shall not be dumped so that any part of it runs down and
 over the lower layers in the stockpile. The method of dropping from a bucket or spout in one
 location to form a cone shaped pile will not be permitted. Any method of placing aggregates
 in stockpiles, which in the opinion of the Engineer, breaks, degrades, or otherwise damages
 the aggregate, will not be permitted. Plank runways will be required, when deemed necessary
 by the Engineer, for operating trucks on stockpiles to avoid tracking dirt or other foreign
 matter onto the stockpiled materials. Stockpiles of less than 200 cubic yards shall be piled
 in a manner to prevent segregation of the various sizes of material.
 No equipment other than pneumatic tired equipment shall be used in constructing the
 stockpiles of processed or manufactured aggregates.
 Stockpiles of different types or sizes of aggregate shall be spaced far enough apart, or
 separated by suitable walls or partitions, to prevent the mixing of the aggregates. Aggregate
 shall not be deposited where traffic, vehicles, or Contractor’s equipment will either run over
 or through the piles, or in any way cause foreign matter to become mixed with the aggregates.
 3-02.2(7)  Removing Aggregates From Stockpiles
 Aggregates shall be removed from stockpile in a manner to avoid separation of sizes or
 admixture of dirt or foreign material. The method and equipment used for loading will be
 approved by the Engineer.

 3-04  Acceptance of Aggregate
 3-04.1 Description
 This work shall consist of acceptance of aggregate as provided for under statistical or
 nonstatistical evaluation.
 All aggregates shall meet the requirements in Section 9-03.
 Acceptance of aggregate by statistical evaluation is administered under Section 1-06.2.
 Statistical evaluation will be used for an aggregate material when the proposed plan quantity
 of the aggregate material exceeds two sublots as shown in Table 1.
 Nonstatistical evaluation will be used for the acceptance of aggregate materials when the
 proposed plan quantity is equal to or less than two sublots as shown in Table 1.
 3-04.2 Materials
 Material shall meet the requirements of the following section:
 	Aggregates	
 
 9-03
 
 3-04.3  Construction Requirements
 3-04.3(1) General
 For the purpose of statistical and nonstatistical acceptance sampling and testing, all test
 results obtained for a material type will be evaluated collectively. Sublot sampling and testing
 will be performed on a random basis at the frequency of one sample per sublot. Based on plan
 quantities, the sublot size will be determined to the nearest 100 tons (50 cy). The maximum
 sublot size will be as defined in Table 1.
 3-04.3(2)  Point of Acceptance
 The point of acceptance shall be as designated by the Engineer. Multiple sources shall
 not be placed within the same limits of each separate spreading operation or in such a way
 that the intermingling of different sources occurs. Individual compaction lifts may be of a
 different source.
 3-04.3(3) Sampling
 The sampling of aggregate materials shall be performed on a random basis using WSDOT
 T 716, Method of Random Sampling. Samples for acceptance testing shall be obtained by
 the Engineer, or their designated representative. If ordered by the Engineer, the Contractor
 shall obtain the sample in the presence of the Engineer or their representative. The aggregate
 material shall be sampled in accordance with FOP for AASHTO T 2 and Section 1-05.6. The
 sample size shall be equal to the minimum requirements of FOP for AASHTO T 2.
 3-04.3(4)  Testing Results
 The results of all acceptance testing performed in the field and the Composite Pay Factor
 (CPF) of the lot after three sublots have been tested will be available to the Contractor through
 WSDOT’s website.
 3-04.3(5)  Nonstatistical Evaluation
 Each lot of aggregate materials produced under nonstatistical evaluation and having all
 constituents falling within the specification limits shall be accepted with no further evaluation.
 When one or more constituents fall outside the specification limits, the material will be
 statistically evaluated. A minimum of three sublots will be sampled and tested, when less
 than three sublots exist additional samples shall be tested to provide a minimum of three sets
 of results for evaluation. The test results of the sublots shall be evaluated in accordance with
 Section 1-06.2 using the price adjustment factors from Table 2 to determine the appropriate
 CPF. The maximum CPF shall be 1.00. If the CPF is below 1.00 but is equal to or above 0.75,
 a price adjustment will be calculated in accordance with Section 3-04.3(8).
 When the aggregate does not have established price adjustment factors, use the appropriate
 price adjustment factors from “Other Materials” as listed in Table 2.

 Acceptance of Aggregate
 
 3-04.3(6)  Statistical Evaluation
 For statistical evaluation a lot is defined as 15 sublots, the final lot will be increased to
 a maximum of 25 sublots. All test results obtained for a material type will be evaluated in
 accordance with Section 1-06.2. Each lot of aggregate materials produced under statistical
 evaluation will be determined to be acceptable if the Composite Pay Factor (CPF) when
 calculated in accordance with Section 1-06.2(2) using the price adjustment factors from
 Table 2 is 1.00 or greater. The Contractor shall be paid the unit bid price for aggregate
 materials with a CPF of 1.00 or greater. If the CPF is below 1.00 but is equal to or above
 0.75, calculate the price adjustment in accordance with Section 3-04.3(8).
 When the aggregate does not have established price adjustment factors, use the
 appropriate price adjustment factors from “Other Materials” as listed in Table 2.
 3-04.3(7)  Rejected Work
 3-04.3(7)A General
 Work that is defective or does not conform to Contract requirements shall be rejected.
 3-04.3(7)B  Rejection by Contractor
 The Contractor may, prior to sampling, elect to remove any defective material and
 replace it with new material. Any such new material will be sampled, tested, and evaluated
 for acceptance.
 3-04.3(7)C  Rejection Without Testing
 The Engineer may, without sampling, reject any load or stockpile that appears defective.
 Material rejected before placement shall not be incorporated into the work. Any rejected work
 shall be removed.
 No payment will be made for the rejected materials unless the Contractor requests that
 the rejected material be tested. If the Contractor elects to have the rejected material tested, a
 minimum of three representative samples shall be obtained and tested. Acceptance of rejected
 material will be based on conformance with the statistical acceptance Specification. If the CPF
 for the rejected material is less than 0.75, no payment will be made for the rejected material;
 in addition, the cost of sampling and testing shall be borne by the Contractor. If the CPF is
 greater than or equal to 0.75, the cost of sampling and testing will be borne by the Contracting
 Agency. If the material is rejected before placement and the CPF is greater than or equal to
 0.75, compensation for the rejected material will be at a CPF of 0.75. If rejection occurs after
 placement and the CPF is greater than 0.75, compensation for the rejected mix will be at the
 calculated CPF with an addition of 25 percent of the unit Contract price added for the cost of
 removal and disposal.
 3-04.3(7)D  Lots and Sublots
 3-04.3(7)D1  A Partial Sublot
 In addition to the preceding random acceptance sampling and testing, the Engineer may
 also isolate from a normal sublot any material that is suspected of being defective.
 Such isolated material will not include an original sample location. A minimum of three
 random samples of the suspect material will be obtained and tested. The material will then
 be evaluated as an independent lot in accordance with Section 1-06.2(2).
 3-04.3(7)D2  An Entire Sublot
 An entire sublot that is suspect of being defective may be rejected. When a sublot is
 rejected a minimum of two additional samples from this sublot will be obtained. These
 additional samples and the original sublot will be evaluated as an independent lot in
 accordance with Section 1-06.2(2).

 An entire lot with a CPF of less than 0.75 will be rejected.
 3-04.3(8)  Price Adjustments for Quality of Aggregate
 All aggregate material will be subject to price adjustments. The maximum attainable
 Composite Pay Factor (CPF) shall be 1.00. The aggregate Compliance Price Adjustment for
 acceptance of the aggregate will be calculated as follows:
 	
 
 Aggregate Compliance Price Adjustment = (Composite Pay Factor – 1.00)
 (quantity of material) (unit bid price or Contingent Unit Price as shown in Table 1,
 whichever is higher)
 
 For aggregate materials lacking a separate unit bid price, the unit bid prices shall be taken
 as the value listed in Table 1 for “Contingent Unit Price”.
 If a component is not measured in accordance with these specifications, its individual pay
 factor will be considered 1.00 in calculating the composite pay factor.

 on the project and approved by the Engineer prior to beginning work. If central mix plant
 methods are used, the central mixing plant shall comply with the following requirements:
 The cold aggregate feeder shall be mechanically operated and adjustable to the extent
 necessary to provide a uniform and continuous flow of materials. These materials shall be
 deposited in an approved mixer with a sufficient amount of water being added to obtain
 the required density when spread and compacted. The water shall be weighed or metered,
 and dispensed through a device providing uniform dispersion across the mixer.
 The mixing plant shall be provided with weighing or calibrating devices, feeders,
 provisions for sampling, and other devices and equipment so designed, coordinated, and
 operated to produce a uniform mixture, and to permit the sampling of the materials before
 and after mixing. The mixer shall be kept in good condition, and mixing blades or paddles
 shall be of proper size, adjustment, and clearance to provide positive and uniform mixing
 of the mixture at all times.
 The capacity of the plant and equipment furnished for the Work shall be adequate at all
 times to provide for efficient and continuous operations insofar as practical.
 4-04.3(2) Subgrade
 The Subgrade shall be prepared as specified in Section 2-06 and shall be approved by the
 Engineer before placing ballast or surfacing materials.
 4-04.3(3)  Mixing
 Unless otherwise specified, the Contractor may use either, or both, of the following
 described methods:
 1.	 Central Plant Mix Method – The surfacing material and water shall be mixed in an
 approved mixing plant as described in Section 4-04.3(1). The completed mixture shall
 be a thoroughly mixed combination of proportioned materials and water, uniform in
 distribution of particle sizes and moisture content. A mixture containing water in excess
 of the proportion established by the Engineer will not be accepted.

 4-04
 
 4-04.3(4)  Placing and Spreading
 1.	 Central Plant Mix Method – After mixing, material for each layer of surfacing shall
 be transported to the Roadway in approved vehicles. Vehicles for hauling the mixture
 shall be capable of depositing the mixture within the receiving hopper of the spreading
 equipment, or in windrows of uniform size in front of the spreading equipment, with a
 minimum of segregation of the mix.
 	 A motor grader may be used as the spreading machine or the spreading machine shall be
 capable of receiving the material by direct deposit in its hopper from the hauling vehicle
 or from a uniform windrow, and be capable of spreading and screeding the material to a
 depth and surface that when compacted will be true to line, grade, depth of course, and
 cross-section without further shaping.
 2.	 Road Mix Method – Each layer of surfacing material shall be spread by equipment
 that is approved by the Engineer. Equipment that causes segregation of the surfacing
 material during the spreading operation will not be allowed. Similar types of spreading
 equipment shall be used throughout the limits of each separate spreading operation.
 Spreading on small areas of less than 2,000 square yards or on areas irregular in shape,
 may be accomplished by other means as approved by the Engineer.
 The following nominal depth of compacted material shall not be exceeded in any one
 course without the approval of the Engineer:
 	 Ballast	
 0.50 foot
 Gravel Base	
 0.75 foot
 Crushed Surfacing	
 0.35 foot
 4-04.3(5)  Shaping and Compaction
 Immediately following spreading and final shaping, each layer of surfacing shall be
 compacted to at least 95 percent of maximum density determined by the requirements of
 Section 2-03.3(14)D before the next succeeding layer of surfacing or pavement is placed.
 The determination of field in-place density shall be made by the Nuclear gauge. When the
 thickness of surfacing is less than 0.15 foot, density testing will not be required and the
 Engineer will determine the number of coverages required for the particular compaction
 equipment available. Vibratory compactors and rollers shall obtain the specified density
 for each layer. A mist spray of water shall be applied as needed to replace moisture lost by
 evaporation. The completed layer shall have a smooth, tight, uniform surface true to the
 line, grade, and cross-section shown in the Plans, or as staked.
 4-04.3(6)  Keystone
 When necessary, as determined by the Engineer, crushed surfacing top course shall be
 used for keystone to key the top surface of ballast, gravel base, crushed surfacing base course,
 or any other surfacing course that requires keying. The keystone shall be spread evenly on
 top of the surfacing course by means of approved spreading equipment. The surface shall be
 watered and, if necessary, bladed lightly until the keystone is worked into the interstices of
 the surfacing course without excessive displacement and shall be compacted. The operations
 of adding keystone, wetting, blading, and compacting shall be continued until the course has
 become thoroughly keyed and compacted.
 When keystone is required, that is subject to public traffic, it shall be placed before
 terminating each day’s operation.
 Keystone placed for the convenience of the Contractor, with approval of the Engineer, for
 the purpose of creating a more dense surface on which to pave will be allowed within the top
 0.20 foot of crushed surfacing base course, gravel base, or ballast. Keystone placed for this
 purpose will be paid for at the lower unit Contract price for either the base material being
 keyed or crushed surfacing top course.

 cross-section by grading, watering, and rolling until placing the next succeeding course. The
 first course of surfacing material shall be placed on all available Subgrade before placing the
 succeeding course unless otherwise authorized by the Engineer. Unless otherwise approved,
 there shall be a distance of not less than one station between the construction of any two
 courses of surfacing or ballast.
 Should irregularities develop in any surface during or after compaction, they shall be
 remedied by loosening the surface and correcting the defects after which the entire area
 including the surrounding surface shall be thoroughly recompacted. Any additional materials
 necessary to make the repairs shall be furnished by the Contractor at the unit Contract price.
 4-04.3(8)  Weather Limitations
 When, in the opinion of the Engineer, the weather is such that satisfactory results cannot be
 obtained, the Contractor shall suspend operations until the weather is favorable. No surfacing
 materials shall be placed in snow or on a soft, muddy, or frozen Subgrade.
 4-04.3(9) Hauling
 Hauling equipment shall be routed over the Roadway in a manner to be most effective
 in the compacting of the surfacing. Hauling over any of the surfacing in the process of

 with a vibratory compactor of a type acceptable to the Engineer. The density requirements
 of Section 4-04.3(5) shall not apply.
 4-04.4 Measurement
 Crushed surfacing top course, base course, ballast, and gravel base, when mixed at a central
 plant, will be measured by the ton. The weight of water added at the plant will be deducted
 on a daily basis from the total tonnage of aggregates, including water, placed that day which
 were processed through the central plant and placed on the Roadway. The resultant tonnage
 of surfacing materials will be paid for at the unit Contract price. The weight of deducted
 water will be converted to gallons and will be paid for at the unit Contract price for water.
 Crushed surfacing top course, base course, ballast, and gravel base, when mixed by
 the road mix method, will be measured by the ton or by the cubic yard. If measured by the

 Page 5-22
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Hot Mix Asphalt
 
 5-04
 
 Equip the paver with automatic screed controls and sensors for either or both sides of the
 paver. The controls shall be capable of sensing grade from an outside reference line, sensing
 the transverse slope of the screed, and providing automatic signals that operate the screed to
 maintain the desired grade and transverse slope. Construct the sensor so it will operate from a
 reference line or a mat referencing device. The transverse slope controller shall be capable of
 maintaining the screed at the desired slope within plus or minus 0.1 percent.
 Equip the paver with automatic feeder controls, properly adjusted to maintain a uniform
 depth of material ahead of the screed.
 Manual operation of the screed is permitted in the construction of irregularly shaped and
 minor areas. These areas include, but are not limited to, gore areas, road approaches, tapers
 and left-turn channelizations.
 When specified in the Contract, provide reference lines for vertical control. Place reference
 lines on both outer edges of the Traveled Way of each Roadway. Horizontal control utilizing
 the reference line is permitted. Automatically control the grade and slope of intermediate
 lanes by means of reference lines or a mat referencing device and a slope control device.
 When the finish of the grade prepared for paving is superior to the established tolerances and
 when, in the opinion of the Engineer, further improvement to the line, grade, cross-section,
 and smoothness can best be achieved without the use of the reference line, a mat referencing
 device may be substituted for the reference line. Substitution of the device will be subject to
 the continued approval of the Engineer. A joint matcher may be used subject to the approval of
 the Engineer. The reference line may be removed after completion of the first course of HMA
 when approved by the Engineer. Whenever the Engineer determines that any of these methods
 are failing to provide the necessary vertical control, the reference lines will be reinstalled by
 the Contractor.
 Furnish and install all pins, brackets, tensioning devices, wire, and accessories necessary
 for satisfactory operation of the automatic control equipment.
 If the paving machine in use is not providing the required finish, the Engineer may suspend
 Work as allowed by Section 1-08.6.
 5-04.3(3)D  Material Transfer Device or Material Transfer Vehicle
 Use a material transfer device (MTD) or material transfer vehicle (MTV) to deliver the
 HMA from the hauling equipment to the paving machine for any lift in (or partially in) the top
 0.30 feet of the pavement section used in traffic lanes. However, an MTD/V is not required for
 HMA placed in irregularly shaped and minor areas such as tapers and turn lanes, or for HMA
 mixture that is accepted by Visual Evaluation. At the Contractor’s request the Engineer may
 approve paving without an MTD/V; the Engineer will determine if an equitable adjustment
 in cost or time is due. If a windrow elevator is used, the Engineer may limit the length of the
 windrow in urban areas or through intersections.
 To be approved for use, an MTV:
 1.	 Shall be self-propelled vehicle, separate from the hauling vehicle or paver.
 2.	 Shall not be connected to the hauling vehicle or paver.
 3.	 May accept HMA directly from the haul vehicle or pick up HMA from a windrow.
 4.	 Shall mix the HMA after delivery by the hauling equipment and prior to placement into
 the paving machine.
 5.	 Shall mix the HMA sufficiently to obtain a uniform temperature throughout the mixture.
 To be approved for use, an MTD:
 1.	 Shall be positively connected to the paver.
 2.	 May accept HMA directly from the haul vehicle or pick up HMA from a windrow.
 3.	 Shall mix the HMA after delivery by the hauling equipment and prior to placement into
 the paving machine.
 4.	 Shall mix the HMA sufficiently to obtain a uniform temperature throughout the mixture.

 5-04.3(3)E Rollers
 Operate rollers in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. When requested
 by the Engineer, provide a Type 1 Working Drawing of the manufacturer’s recommendation
 for the use of any roller planned for use on the project. Do not use rollers that crush aggregate,
 produce pickup or washboard, unevenly compact the surface, displace the mix, or produce
 other undesirable results.
 5-04.3(4)  Preparation of Existing Paved Surfaces
 Before constructing HMA on an existing paved surface, the entire surface of the pavement
 shall be clean. Entirely remove all fatty asphalt patches, grease drippings, and other deleterious
 substances from the existing pavement to the satisfaction of the Engineer. Thoroughly clean all
 pavements or bituminous surfaces of dust, soil, pavement grindings, and other foreign matter.
 Thoroughly remove any cleaning or solvent type liquids used to clean equipment spilled on
 the pavement before paving proceeds. Fill all holes and small depressions with an appropriate
 class of HMA. Level and thoroughly compact the surface of the patched area.
 Apply a uniform coat of asphalt (tack coat) to all paved surfaces on which any course of
 HMA is to be placed or abutted. Apply tack coat to cover the cleaned existing pavement with
 a thin film of residual asphalt free of streaks and bare spots. Apply a heavy application of tack
 coat to all joints. For Roadways open to traffic, limit the application of tack coat to surfaces
 that will be paved during the same working shift. Equip the spreading equipment with a
 thermometer to indicate the temperature of the tack coat material.
 Do not operate equipment on tacked surfaces until the tack has broken and cured. Repair
 tack coat damaged by the Contractor’s operation, prior to placement of the HMA.
 Unless otherwise approved by the Engineer, use cationic emulsified asphalt CSS-1, CSS1h, STE-1, or Performance Graded (PG) asphalt for tack coat. The CSS-1 and CSS-1h may
 be diluted with water at a rate not to exceed one part water to one part emulsified asphalt. Do
 not allow the tack coat material to exceed the maximum temperature recommended by the
 asphalt supplier.
 When shown in the Plans, prelevel uneven or broken surfaces over which HMA is to be
 placed by using an asphalt paver, a motor patrol grader, or by hand raking, as approved by
 the Engineer.
 5-04.3(4)A  Crack Sealing
 5-04.3(4)A1 General
 When the Proposal includes a pay item for crack sealing, seal all cracks ¼ inch in width
 and greater.
 Cleaning: Ensure that cracks are thoroughly clean, dry and free of all loose and foreign
 material when filling with crack sealant material. Use a hot compressed air lance to dry and
 warm the pavement surfaces within the crack immediately prior to filling a crack with the
 sealant material. Do not overheat pavement. Do not use direct flame dryers. Routing cracks is
 not required.
 Sand Slurry: For cracks that are to be filled with sand slurry, thoroughly mix the
 components and pour the mixture into the cracks until full. Add additional CSS-1 cationic
 emulsified asphalt to the sand slurry as needed for workability to ensure the mixture will
 completely fill the cracks. Strike off the sand slurry flush with the existing pavement surface
 and allow the mixture to cure. Top off cracks that were not completely filled with additional
 sand slurry. Do not place the HMA overlay until the slurry has fully cured.
 Hot Poured Sealant: For cracks that are to be filled with hot poured sealant, apply the
 material in accordance with these requirements and the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Furnish a Type 1 Working Drawing of the manufacturer’s product information and
 recommendations to the Engineer prior to the start of work, including the manufacturer’s
 recommended heating time and temperatures, allowable storage time and temperatures after
 initial heating, allowable reheating criteria, and application temperature range. Confine hot

 poured sealant material within the crack. Clean any overflow of sealant from the pavement
 surface. If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the Contractor’s method of sealing the cracks with
 hot poured sealant results in an excessive amount of material on the pavement surface, stop
 and correct the operation to eliminate the excess material.
 5-04.3(4)A2  Crack Sealing Areas Prior to Paving
 In areas where HMA will be placed, use sand slurry to fill the cracks.
 5-04.3(4)A3  Crack Sealing Areas Not to be Paved
 In areas where HMA will not be placed, fill the cracks as follows:
 1.	 Cracks ¼ inch to 1 inch in width - fill with hot poured sealant.
 2.	 Cracks greater than 1 inch in width – fill with sand slurry.
 5-04.3(4)B  Soil Residual Herbicide
 Where shown in the Plans, apply one application of an approved soil residual herbicide.
 Comply with Section 8-02.3(3)B. Complete paving within 48 hours of applying the herbicide.
 Use herbicide registered with the Washington State Department of Agriculture for
 use under pavement. Before use, obtain the Engineer’s approval of the herbicide and the
 proposed rate of application. Include the following information in the request for approval of
 the material:
 1.	 Brand Name of the Material,
 2.	Manufacturer,
 3.	 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Registration Number,
 4.	 Material Safety Data Sheet, and
 5.	 Proposed Rate of Application.
 5-04.3(4)C  Pavement Repair
 Excavate pavement repair areas and backfill these with HMA in accordance with the details
 shown in the Plans and as staked. Conduct the excavation operations in a manner that will
 protect the pavement that is to remain. Repair pavement not designated to be removed that is
 damaged as a result of the Contractor’s operations to the satisfaction of the Engineer at no cost
 to the Contracting Agency. Excavate only within one lane at a time unless approved otherwise
 by the Engineer. Do not excavate more area than can be completely backfilled and compacted
 during the same shift.
 Unless otherwise shown in the Plans or determined by the Engineer, excavate to a depth of
 1.0 feet. The Engineer will make the final determination of the excavation depth required.
 The minimum width of any pavement repair area shall be 40 inches unless shown
 otherwise in the Plans. Before any excavation, sawcut the perimeter of the pavement
 area to be removed unless the pavement in the pavement repair area is to be removed by
 a pavement grinder.
 Excavated materials shall be the property of the Contractor and shall be disposed of in
 a Contractor-provided site off the Right of Way or used in accordance with Sections 2-02.3(3)
 or 9-03.21.
 Apply a heavy application of tack coat to all surfaces of existing pavement in the pavement
 repair area, in accordance with Section 5-04.3(4).
 Place the HMA backfill in lifts not to exceed 0.35-foot compacted depth. Thoroughly
 compact each lift by a mechanical tamper or a roller.
 5-04.3(5)  Producing/Stockpiling Aggregates, RAP, & RAS
 Produce aggregate in compliance with Section 3-01. Comply with Section 3-02 for
 preparing stockpile sites, stockpiling, and removing from stockpile each of the following:
 aggregates, RAP, and RAS. Provide sufficient storage space for each size of aggregate, RAP
 and RAS. Fine aggregate or RAP may be uniformly blended with the RAS as a method of
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 preventing the agglomeration of RAS particles. Remove the aggregates, RAP and RAS from
 stockpile(s) in a manner that ensures minimal segregation when being moved to the HMA
 plant for processing into the final mixture. Keep different aggregate sizes separated until they
 have been delivered to the HMA plant.
 5-04.3(5)A  Stockpiling RAP or RAS for High RAP/Any RAS Mixes
 Do not place any RAP or RAS into a stockpile which has been sequestered for a High
 RAP/Any RAS mix design. Do not incorporate any RAP or RAS into a High RAP/Any RAS
 mixture from any source other than the stockpile which was sequestered for approval of that
 particular High RAP/Any RAS mix design.
 RAP that is used in a Low RAP/No RAS mix is not required to come from a sequestered
 stockpile.
 5-04.3(6) Mixing
 The asphalt supplier shall introduce anti-stripping additive, in the amount designated on the
 QPL for the mix design, into the asphalt binder prior to shipment to the asphalt mixing plant.
 Anti-strip is not required for temporary work that will be removed prior to
 Physical Completion.
 Use asphalt binder of the grade, and from the supplier, in the approved mix design.
 Prior to introducing reclaimed materials into the asphalt plant, remove wire, nails, and
 other foreign material. Discontinue use of the reclaimed material if the Engineer, in their sole
 discretion, determines the wire, nails, or other foreign material to be excessive.
 Size RAP and RAS prior to entering the mixer to provide uniform and thoroughly mixed
 HMA. If there is evidence of the RAP or RAS not breaking down during the heating and
 mixing of the HMA, immediately suspend the use of the RAP or RAS until changes have been
 approved by the Engineer.
 After the required amount of mineral materials, RAP, RAS, new asphalt binder and
 recycling agent have been introduced into the mixer, mix the HMA until complete and uniform
 coating of the particles and thorough distribution of the asphalt binder throughout the mineral
 materials, RAP and RAS is ensured.
 Upon discharge from the mixer, ensure that the temperature of the HMA does not exceed
 the optimum mixing temperature shown on the approved Mix Design Report by more than
 25°F, or as approved by the Engineer. When a WMA additive is included in the manufacture of
 HMA, do not heat the WMA additive (at any stage of production including in binder storage
 tanks) to a temperature higher than the maximum recommended by the manufacturer of the
 WMA additive.
 A maximum water content of 2 percent in the mix, at discharge, will be allowed providing
 the water causes no problems with handling, stripping, or flushing. If the water in the HMA
 causes any of these problems, reduce the moisture content.
 During the daily operation, HMA may be temporarily held in approved storage facilities.
 Do not incorporate HMA into the Work that has been held for more than 24 hours after
 mixing. Provide an easily readable, low bin-level indicator on the storage facility that indicates
 the amount of material in storage. Waste the HMA in storage when the top level of HMA
 drops below the top of the cone of the storage facility, except as the storage facility is being
 emptied at the end of the working shift. Dispose of rejected or waste HMA at no expense to
 the Contracting Agency.

 Use HMA pavers complying with Section 5-04.3(3) to distribute the mix. On areas where
 irregularities or unavoidable obstacles make the use of mechanical spreading and finishing
 equipment impractical, the paving may be done with other equipment or by hand.
 When more than one JMF is being utilized to produce HMA, place the material produced
 for each JMF with separate spreading and compacting equipment. Do not intermingle HMA
 produced from more than one JMF. Each strip of HMA placed during a work shift shall
 conform to a single JMF established for the class of HMA specified unless there is a need
 to make an adjustment in the JMF.
 5-04.3(8)  Aggregate Acceptance Prior to Incorporation in HMA
 Sample aggregate for meeting the requirements of Section 3-04 prior to being incorporated
 into HMA. (The acceptance data generated for the Section 3-04 acceptance analysis will
 not be commingled with the acceptance data generated for the Section 5-04.3(9) acceptance
 analysis.) Aggregate acceptance samples shall be taken as described in Section 3-04.
 Aggregate acceptance testing will be performed by the Contracting Agency. Aggregate
 contributed from RAP and/or RAS will not be evaluated under Section 3-04.
 For aggregate that will be used in HMA mixture which will be accepted by Statistical
 Evaluation, the Contracting Agency’s acceptance of the aggregate will be based on:
 1.	 Samples taken prior to mixing with asphalt binder, RAP, or RAS;
 2.	 Testing for the materials properties of fracture, uncompacted void content, and
 sand equivalent;
 3.	 Evaluation by the Contracting Agency in accordance with Section 3-04, including price
 adjustments as described therein.
 For aggregate that will be used in HMA which will be accepted by Visual Evaluation,
 evaluation in accordance with items 1, 2, and 3 above is at the discretion of the Engineer.

 5-04.3(9)A  Test Sections
 This section applies to HMA mixture accepted by Statistical Evaluation. A test section is
 not allowed for HMA accepted by Visual Evaluation.
 The purpose of a test section is to determine whether or not the Contractor’s mix design
 and production processes will produce HMA meeting the Contract requirements related
 to mixture. Construct HMA mixture test sections at the beginning of paving, using at least
 600 tons and a maximum of 1,000 tons or as specified by the Engineer. Each test section shall
 be constructed in one continuous operation.
 5-04.3(9)A1  Test Section – When Required, When to Stop
 Use Tables 8 and 9 to determine when a test section is required, optional, or not allowed,
 and to determine when performing test sections may end. Each mix design will be evaluated
 independently for the test section requirements.
 If more than one test section is required, each test section shall be evaluated separately
 by the criteria in Tables 8 and 9.

 5-04.3(9)B  Mixture Acceptance – Statistical Evaluation
 5-04.3(9)B1  Mixture Statistical Evaluation – Lots and Sublots
 HMA mixture which is accepted by Statistical Evaluation will be evaluated by the
 Contracting Agency dividing that HMA tonnage into mixture lots, and each mixture lot will
 be evaluated using stratified random sampling by the Contracting Agency sub-dividing each
 mixture lot into mixture sublots. All mixture in a mixture lot shall be of the same mix design.
 The mixture sublots will be numbered in the order in which the mixture (of a particular mix
 design) is paved.
 Each mixture lot comprises a maximum of 15 mixture sublots, except:
 •	 The final mixture lot of each mix design on the Contract will comprise a maximum of
 25 sublots.
 •	 A mixture lot for a test section will consist of three sublots.
 Each mixture sublot shall be approximately uniform in size with the maximum mixture
 sublot size as specified in Table 10. The quantity of material represented by the final mixture
 sublot of the project, for each mix design on the project, may be increased to a maximum of
 two times the mixture sublot quantity calculated.

 •	 For a mixture lot in progress with a mixture CPF less than 0.75, a new mixture lot will
 begin at the Contractor’s request after the Engineer is satisfied that material conforming
 to the Specifications can be produced. See also Section 5-04.3(11)F.
 •	 If, before completing a mixture lot, the Contractor requests a change to the JMF
 which is approved by the Engineer, the mixture produced in that lot after the approved
 change will be evaluated on the basis of the changed JMF, and the mixture produced
 in that lot before the approved change will be evaluated on the basis of the unchanged
 JMF; however, the mixture before and after the change will be evaluated in the same
 lot. Acceptance of subsequent mixture lots will be evaluated on the basis of the
 changed JMF.
 5-04.3(9)B2  Mixture Statistical Evaluation – Sampling
 Comply with Section 1-06.2(1).
 Samples of HMA mixture which is accepted by Statistical Evaluation will be randomly
 selected from within each sublot, with one sample per sublot. The Engineer will determine the
 random sample location using WSDOT Test Method T 716. The Contractor shall obtain the
 sample when ordered by the Engineer. The Contractor shall sample the HMA mixture in the
 presence of the Engineer and in accordance with FOP for WAQTC T 168.
 5-04.3(9)B3  Mixture Statistical Evaluation – Acceptance Testing

 of the mixture described in Sections 5-04.3(9)B3, 5-04.3(9)B4, 5-04.3(9)B5, and 5-04.3(9)B6.
 5-04.3(9)B4  Mixture Statistical Evaluation – Pay Factors
 Comply with Section 1-06.2(2).
 The Contracting Agency will determine a pay factor (PFi) for each of the properties in
 Table 11 of Section 5-04.3(9)B3, for each mixture lot, using the quality level analysis in
 Section 1-06.2(2)D. For Gradation, a pay factor will be calculated for each of the sieve sizes
 listed in Table 11 of Section 5-04.3(9)B3, which is equal to or smaller than the maximum
 allowable aggregate size (100 percent passing sieve) of the HMA mixture. The USL and
 LSL shall be calculated using the Job Mix Formula Tolerances (for Statistical Evaluation) in
 Section 9-03.8(7).
 If a constituent is not measured in accordance with these Specifications, its individual pay
 factor will be considered 1.00 in calculating the Composite Pay Factor (CPF).
 5-04.3(9)B5  Mixture Statistical Evaluation – Composite Pay Factors (CPF)
 Comply with Section 1-06.2(2).
 In accordance with Section 1-06.2(2)D4, the Contracting Agency will determine a
 Composite Pay Factor (CPF) for each mixture lot from the pay factors calculated in Section
 5-04.3(9)B4, using the price adjustment factors in Table 12. Unless otherwise specified, the
 maximum CPF for HMA mixture shall be 1.05.

 5-04.3(9)B7  Mixture Statistical Evaluation – Retests
 The Contractor may request that a mixture sublot be retested. To request a retest, submit
 a written request to the Contracting Agency within 7 calendar days after the specific test
 results have been posted to the website or emailed to the Contractor, whichever occurs first.
 The Contracting Agency will send a split of the original acceptance sample for testing by
 the Contracting Agency to either the Region Materials Laboratory or the State Materials
 Laboratory as determined by the Engineer. The Contracting Agency will not test the split of
 the sample with the same equipment or by the same tester that ran the original acceptance
 test. The sample will be tested for a complete gradation analysis, asphalt binder content, and
 Va, and the results of the retest will be used for the acceptance of the HMA mixture in place
 of the original mixture sublot sample test results. The cost of testing will be deducted from
 any monies due or that may come due the Contractor under the Contract at the rate of $250
 per sample.
 5-04.3(9)C Vacant
 5-04.3(9)D  Mixture Acceptance – Visual Evaluation
 Visual Evaluation of HMA mixture will be by visual inspection by the Engineer or, in the
 sole discretion of the Engineer, the Engineer may sample and test the mixture.
 5-04.3(9)D1  Mixture Visual Evaluation – Lots, Sampling, Testing, Price Adjustments
 HMA mixture accepted by Visual Evaluation will not be broken into lots unless the
 Engineer determines that testing is required. When that occurs, the Engineer will identify
 the limits of the questionable HMA mixture, and that questionable HMA mixture shall
 constitute a lot. Then, the Contractor will take samples from the truck, or the Engineer will
 take core samples from the roadway at a minimum of three random locations from within
 the lot, selected in accordance with WSDOT Test Method T 716, taken from the roadway in
 accordance with WSDOT SOP 734, and tested in accordance with WSDOT SOP 737. The
 Engineer will test one of the samples for all constituents in Section 5-04.3(9)B3. If all
 constituents from that test fall within the Job Mix Formula Tolerances (for Visual Evaluation)
 in Section 9-03.8(7), the lot will be accepted at the unit Contract price with no
 further evaluation.
 When one or more constituents fall outside those tolerance limits, the other samples will be
 tested for all constituents in Section 5-04.3(9)B3, and a Job Mix Compliance Price Adjustment
 will be calculated in accordance with Table 13.

 5-04.3(9)E  Mixture Acceptance – Notification of Acceptance Test Results
 The results of all mixture acceptance testing and the Composite Pay Factor (CPF) of the lot
 after three sublots have been tested will be available to the Contractor through the Contracting
 Agency’s website.
 The Contracting Agency will endeavor to provide written notification (via email to the
 Contractor’s designee) of acceptance test results through its web-based materials testing
 system Statistical Analysis of Materials (SAM) within 24 hours of the sample being made
 available to the Contracting Agency. However, the Contractor agrees:

 1.	 Quality control, defined as the system used by the Contractor to monitor, assess, and
 adjust its production processes to ensure that the final HMA mixture will meet the
 specified level of quality, is the sole responsibility of the Contractor.
 2.	 The Contractor has no right to rely on any testing performed by the Contracting Agency,
 nor does the Contractor have any right to rely on timely notification by the Contracting
 Agency of the Contracting Agency’s test results (or statistical analysis thereof), for
 any part of quality control and/or for making changes or correction to any aspect of the
 HMA mixture.
 3.	 The Contractor shall make no claim for untimely notification by the Contracting
 Agency of the Contracting Agency’s test results or statistical analysis.
 5-04.3(10)  HMA Compaction Acceptance
 For all HMA, the Contractor shall comply with the General Compaction Requirements
 in Section 5-04.3(10)A. The Contracting Agency will evaluate all HMA for compaction
 compliance with one of the following - Statistical Evaluation, Visual Evaluation, or Test Point
 Evaluation - determined by the criteria in Table 14:

 table applies to all HMA, and shall be the sole basis for determining the acceptance method for compaction.
 
 The Contracting Agency may, at its sole discretion, evaluate any HMA for compliance with
 the Cyclic Density requirements of Section 5-04.3(10)B.
 5-04.3(10)A  HMA Compaction – General Compaction Requirements
 Immediately after the HMA has been spread and struck off, and after surface irregularities
 have been adjusted, thoroughly and uniformly compact the mix. The completed course shall
 be free from ridges, ruts, humps, depressions, objectionable marks, and irregularities and shall
 conform to the line, grade, and cross-section shown in the Plans. If necessary, alter the JMF in
 accordance with Section 9-03.8(7) to achieve desired results.
 Compact the mix when it is in the proper condition so that no undue displacement,
 cracking, or shoving occurs. Compact areas inaccessible to large compaction equipment by
 mechanical or hand tampers. Remove HMA that becomes loose, broken, contaminated, shows
 an excess or deficiency of asphalt, or is in any way defective. Replace the removed material
 with new HMA, and compact it immediately to conform to the surrounding area.
 The type of rollers to be used and their relative position in the compaction sequence
 shall generally be the Contractor’s option, provided the specified densities are attained. An
 exception shall be that pneumatic tired rollers shall be used for compaction of the wearing
 course beginning October 1st of any year through March 31st of the following year. Coverage
 with a steel wheel roller may precede pneumatic tired rolling. Unless otherwise approved by
 the Engineer, operate rollers in the static mode when the internal temperature of the mix is less
 than 175°F. Regardless of mix temperature, do not operate a roller in a mode that results in
 checking or cracking of the mat.

 On bridge decks and on the five feet of roadway approach immediately adjacent to the end
 of bridge/back of pavement seat, operate rollers in static mode only.
 5-04.3(10)B  HMA Compaction – Cyclic Density
 Low cyclic density areas are defined as spots or streaks in the pavement that are less than
 90 percent of the theoretical maximum density. At the Engineer’s discretion, the Engineer may
 evaluate the HMA pavement for low cyclic density, and when doing so will follow WSDOT
 SOP 733. A $500 Cyclic Density Price Adjustment will be assessed for any 500-foot section
 with two or more density readings below 90 percent of the theoretical maximum density.
 5-04.3(10)C  HMA Compaction Acceptance – Statistical Evaluation
 HMA compaction which is accepted by Statistical Evaluation will be based on acceptance
 testing performed by the Contracting Agency, and statistical analysis of those acceptance tests
 results. This will result in a Compaction Price Adjustment.
 5-04.3(10)C1  HMA Compaction Statistical Evaluation – Lots and Sublots
 HMA compaction which is accepted by Statistical Evaluation will be evaluated by the
 Contracting Agency dividing the project into compaction lots, and each compaction lot will
 be evaluated using stratified random sampling by the Contracting Agency sub-dividing each
 compaction lot into compaction sublots. All mixture in any individual compaction lot shall be
 of the same mix design. The compaction sublots will be numbered in the order in which the
 mixture (of a particular mix design) is paved.
 Each compaction lot comprises a maximum of 15 compaction sublots, except for the
 final compaction lot of each mix design on the Contract, which comprises a maximum of
 25 sublots.
 Each compaction sublot shall be uniform in size as shown in Table 15, except that the last
 compaction sublot of each day may be increased to a maximum of two times the compaction
 sublot quantity calculated. Minor variations in the size of any sublot shall not be cause to
 invalidate the associated test result.

 The following will cause one compaction lot to end prematurely and a new compaction lot
 to begin:
 •	 For a compaction lot in progress with a compaction CPF less than 0.75, a new
 compaction lot will begin at the Contractor’s request after the Engineer is
 satisfied that material conforming to the Specifications can be produced. See also
 Section 5-04.3(11)F.
 All HMA which is paved on a bridge and accepted for compaction by Statistical Evaluation
 will compose a bridge compaction lot. If the contract includes such HMA on more than
 one bridge, compaction will be evaluated on each bridge individually, as separate bridge
 compaction lots.
 Bridge compaction sublots will be determined by the Engineer subject to the following:
 •	 All sublots on a given bridge will be approximately the same size.
 •	 Sublots will be stratified from the lot.
 •	 In no case will there be less than 3 sublots in each bridge compaction lot.
 •	 No sublot will exceed 50 tons.
 •	 Compaction test locations will be determined by the Engineer in accordance with
 WSDOT Test Method T 716.

 5-04.3(10)C2  HMA Compaction Statistical Evaluation – Acceptance Testing
 Comply with Section 1-06.2(1).
 The location of HMA compaction acceptance tests will be randomly selected by the
 Contracting Agency from within each sublot, with one test per sublot. The Contracting Agency
 will determine the random sample location using WSDOT Test Method T 716.
 Use Table 16 to determine compaction acceptance test procedures and to allocate
 compaction acceptance sampling and testing responsibilities between the Contractor and the
 Contracting Agency. HMA cores shall be taken or nuclear density testing shall occur after
 completion of the finish rolling, prior to opening to traffic, and on the same day that the mix
 is placed.

 core diameter shall be 4-inches unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 Contractor shall take the core samples in the presence of the Engineer, at locations designated by the Engineer, and deliver
 the core samples to the Contracting Agency.
 3 The Contracting Agency will determine, in its sole discretion, whether it will take cores or use the nuclear density gauge to
 determine in-place density. Exclusive reliance on cores for density acceptance is generally intended for small paving projects and is
 not intended as a replacement for nuclear gauge density testing on typical projects.
 4 The basis for test of all compaction sublots in a bridge compaction lot shall be cores. These cores shall be taken by the Contractor
 when the Proposal includes the bid item “HMA Cores – Bridge”. When there is no bid item for “HMA Cores – Bridge”, the Engineer
 will be responsible for taking HMA cores for all compaction sublots in a bridge compaction lot. In either case, the Engineer will
 determine core location, in-place density of the core, theoretical maximum density, rolling average of theoretical maximum density,
 and percent compaction using the procedure called for in this section.
 2 The
 
 When using the nuclear density gauge for acceptance testing of pavement density, the
 Engineer will follow WSDOT SOP 730 for correlating the nuclear gauge with HMA cores.
 When cores are required for the correlation, coring and testing will be by the Contracting
 Agency. When a core is taken for gauge correlation at the location of a sublot, the relative
 density of the core will be used for the sublot test result and is exempt from retesting.
 5-04.3(10)C3  HMA Statistical Compaction – Price Adjustments
 For each HMA compaction lot (that is accepted by Statistical Evaluation) which has
 less than three compaction sublots, for which all compaction sublots attain a minimum of
 91 percent compaction determined in accordance with WSDOT FOP for AASHTO T 355
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 5-35
 
 5-04
 
 Hot Mix Asphalt
 
 (or WSDOT SOP 736 when provided by the Contract), the HMA will be accepted at the unit
 Contract price with no further evaluation.
 For each HMA compaction lot (that is accepted by Statistical Evaluation) which does
 not meet the criteria in the preceding paragraph, the compaction lot shall be evaluated in
 accordance with Section 1-06.2(2) to determine the appropriate Compaction Price Adjustment
 (CPA). All of the test results obtained from the acceptance samples from a given compaction
 lot shall be evaluated collectively. Additional testing by either a nuclear density gauge or cores
 will be completed as required to provide a minimum of three tests for evaluation.
 For the statistical analysis in Section 1-06.2, use the following values:
 	 x = percent compaction of each sublot
 USL = 100
 LSL = 91
 Each CPA will be determined as follows:
 CPA = [0.40 × (CPF – 1.00)] × Q × UP
 Where
 CPA = Compaction Price Adjustment for the compaction lot ($)
 CPF = Composite Pay Factor for the compaction lot (maximum is 1.05)
 Q = Quantity in the compaction lot (tons)
 UP = Unit price of the HMA in the compaction lot ($/ton)
 5-04.3(10)C4  HMA Statistical Compaction – Requests for Retesting
 For a compaction sublot that has been tested with a nuclear density gauge that did not meet
 the minimum of 91 percent of the theoretical maximum density in a compaction lot with a
 CPF below 1.00 and thus subject to a price reduction or rejection, the Contractor may request
 that a core, taken at the same location as the nuclear density test, be used for determination of
 the relative density of the compaction sublot. The relative density of the core will replace the
 relative density determined by the nuclear density gauge for the compaction sublot and will be
 used for calculation of the CPF and acceptance of HMA compaction lot. When cores are taken
 by the Contracting Agency at the request of the Contractor, they shall be requested by noon of
 the next workday after the test results for the compaction sublot have been provided or made
 available to the Contractor. Traffic control shall be provided by the Contractor as requested
 by the Engineer. Failure by the Contractor to provide the requested traffic control will result
 in forfeiture of the request for retesting. When the CPF for the compaction lot based on the
 results of the cores is less than 1.00, the Contracting Agency will deduct the cost for the coring
 from any monies due or that may become due the Contractor under the Contract at the rate of
 $200 per core and the Contractor shall pay for the cost of the traffic control.
 5-04.3(10)D  HMA Compaction – Visual Evaluation
 Visual Evaluation will be the basis of acceptance for compaction of the Bid items “HMA
 for Pavement Repair Cl. ___ PG ___” and “HMA for Prelevelling Class___ PG___”. This
 HMA shall be thoroughly compacted to the satisfaction of the Engineer. HMA that is used
 to prelevel wheel ruts shall be compacted with a pneumatic tire roller.
 5-04.3(10)E  HMA Compaction – Test Point Evaluation
 When compaction acceptance is by Test Point Evaluation, compact HMA based on a test
 point evaluation of the compaction train. Perform the test point evaluation in accordance with
 instructions from the Engineer. The number of passes with an approved compaction train,
 required to attain the maximum test point density, shall be used on all subsequent paving.
 5-04.3(10)F  HMA Compaction Acceptance – Notification of Acceptance Test Results
 The obligations and responsibilities for notifying the Contractor of compaction acceptance
 test results are the same as for mixture acceptance test results. See Section 5-04.3(9)E.

 5-04.3(11)  Reject Work
 This section applies to HMA and all requirements related to HMA (except aggregates prior
 to being incorporated into HMA). For rejection of aggregate prior to its incorporation into
 HMA refer to Section 3-04.
 5-04.3(11)A  Reject Work – General
 Work that is defective or does not conform to Contract requirements shall be rejected.
 The Contractor may propose, in writing, alternatives to removal and replacement of rejected
 material. Acceptability of such alternative proposals will be determined at the sole discretion
 of the Engineer.
 5-04.3(11)B  Rejection by Contractor
 The Contractor may, prior to acceptance sampling and testing, elect to remove any
 defective material and replace it with new material. Any such new material will be sampled,
 tested, and evaluated for acceptance.
 5-04.3(11)C  Rejection Without Testing (Mixture or Compaction)
 The Engineer may, without sampling, reject any batch, load, or section of Roadway
 that appears defective. Material rejected before placement shall not be incorporated into
 the pavement.
 No payment will be made for the rejected materials or the removal of the materials
 unless the Contractor requests the rejected material to be tested. If the Contractor requests
 testing, acceptance will be by Statistical Evaluation, and a minimum of three samples will be
 obtained and tested. When uncompacted material is required for testing but not available, the
 Engineer will determine random sample locations on the roadway in accordance with WSDOT
 Test Method T 716, take cores in accordance with WSDOT SOP 734, and test the cores in
 accordance with WSDOT SOP 737.
 If the CPF for the rejected material is less than 0.75, no payment will be made for the
 rejected material; in addition, the cost of sampling and testing shall be borne by the Contractor.
 If the CPF is greater than or equal to 0.75, the cost of sampling and testing will be borne by
 the Contracting Agency. If the material is rejected before placement and the CPF is greater
 than or equal to 0.75, compensation for the rejected material will be at a CPF of 0.75. If
 rejection occurs after placement and the CPF is greater than or equal to 0.75, compensation for
 the rejected material will be at the calculated CPF with an addition of 25 percent of the unit
 Contract price added for the cost of removal and disposal.
 5-04.3(11)D  Rejection – A Partial Sublot (Mixture or Compaction)
 In addition to the random acceptance sampling and testing, the Engineer may also isolate
 from a mixture or compaction sublot any material that is suspected of being defective in
 relative density, gradation or asphalt binder content. Such isolated material will not include
 an original sample location. The Contracting Agency will obtain a minimum of three random
 samples of the suspect material and perform the testing. When uncompacted material is
 required for testing but is not available, the Engineer will select random sample locations
 on the roadway in accordance with WSDOT Test Method T 716, take cores samples in
 accordance with WSDOT SOP 734, and test the material in accordance with WSDOT
 SOP 737. The material will then be statistically evaluated as an independent lot in accordance
 with Section 1-06.2(2).
 5-04.3(11)E  Rejection – An Entire Sublot (Mixture or Compaction)
 An entire mixture or compaction sublot that is suspected of being defective may be
 rejected. When this occurs, a minimum of two additional random samples from this sublot
 will be obtained. When uncompacted material is required for the additional samples but
 the material has been compacted, the Contracting Agency will take and test cores from the
 roadway as described in Section 5-04.3(11)D. The additional samples and the original sublot
 will be evaluated as an independent lot in accordance with Section 1-06.2(2).

 such time as the Engineer is satisfied that material conforming to the Specifications can be
 produced when:
 1.	 the Composite Pay Factor (CPF) of a mixture or compaction lot in progress drops below
 1.00 and the Contractor is taking no corrective action, or
 2.	 the Pay Factor (PFi) for any constituent of a mixture or compaction lot in progress drops
 below 0.95 and the Contractor is taking no corrective action, or
 3.	 either the PFi for any constituent (or the CPF) of a mixture or compaction lot in
 progress is less than 0.75.
 5-04.3(11)G  Rejection – An Entire Lot (Mixture or Compaction)
 An entire lot with a CPF of less than 0.75 will be rejected.
 5-04.3(12) Joints
 5-04.3(12)A  HMA Joints
 5-04.3(12)A1  Transverse Joints
 Conduct operations such that the placement of the top or wearing course is a continuous
 operation or as close to continuous as possible. Unscheduled transverse joints will be
 allowed, but the roller may pass over the unprotected end of the freshly laid HMA only when
 the placement of the course is discontinued for such a length of time that the HMA will
 cool below compaction temperature. When the Work is resumed, cut back the previously
 compacted HMA to produce a slightly beveled edge for the full thickness of the course.
 Construct a temporary wedge of HMA on a 50H:1V where a transverse joint as a result
 of paving or planing is open to traffic. Separate the HMA in the temporary wedge from the
 permanent HMA upon which it is placed by strips of heavy wrapping paper or other methods
 approved by the Engineer. Remove the wrapping paper and trim the joint to a slightly beveled
 edge for the full thickness of the course prior to resumption of paving.
 Waste the material that is cut away and place new HMA against the cut. Use rollers or
 tamping irons to seal the joint.
 5-04.3(12)A2  Longitudinal Joints
 Offset the longitudinal joint in any one course from the course immediately below by
 not more than 6 inches nor less than 2 inches. Locate all longitudinal joints constructed in
 the wearing course at a lane line or an edge line of the Traveled Way. Construct a notched
 wedge joint along all longitudinal joints in the wearing surface of new HMA unless otherwise
 approved by the Engineer. The notched wedge joint shall have a vertical edge of not less than
 the maximum aggregate size nor more than ½ of the compacted lift thickness, and then taper
 down on a slope not steeper than 4H:1V. Uniformly compact the sloped portion of the HMA
 notched wedge joint.
 On one-lane ramps a longitudinal joint may be constructed at the center of the traffic lane,
 subject to approval by the Engineer, if:
 1.	 The ramp must remain open to traffic, or
 2.	 The ramp is closed to traffic and a hot-lap joint is constructed.
 a.	 Two paving machines shall be used to construct the hot-lap joint.
 b.	 The pavement within 6 inches of the hot-lap joint will not be excluded from random
 location selection for compaction testing.
 c.	 Construction equipment other than rollers shall not operate on any
 uncompacted HMA.
 When HMA is placed adjacent to cement concrete pavement, construct longitudinal
 joints between the HMA and the cement concrete pavement. Saw the joint to the dimensions

 Section 5-04.3(12)B1 and the following requirement:
 1.	 Clean and seal the existing joint between concrete panels in accordance with
 Section 5-01.3(8) and the details shown in the Standard Plans.
 5-04.3(13)  Surface Smoothness
 The completed surface of all courses shall be of uniform texture, smooth, uniform as to
 crown and grade, and free from defects of all kinds. The completed surface of the wearing
 course shall not vary more than ⅛ inch from the lower edge of a 10-foot straightedge placed
 on the surface parallel to the centerline. The transverse slope of the completed surface of the
 wearing course shall vary not more than ¼ inch in 10 feet from the rate of transverse slope
 shown in the Plans.
 When deviations in excess of the above tolerances are found that result from a high place
 in the HMA, correct the pavement surface by one of the following methods:
 1.	 Remove material from high places by grinding with an approved grinding machine, or
 2.	 Remove and replace the wearing course of HMA, or
 3.	 By other method approved by the Engineer.
 Correct defects until there are no deviations anywhere greater than the allowable
 tolerances.
 Deviations in excess of the above tolerances that result from a low place in the HMA and
 deviations resulting from a high place where corrective action, in the opinion of the Engineer,
 will not produce satisfactory results will be accepted with a price adjustment. The Engineer
 shall deduct from monies due or that may become due to the Contractor the sum of $500.00
 for each and every section of single traffic lane 100 feet in length in which any excessive
 deviations described above are found.
 When portland cement concrete pavement is to be placed on HMA, the surface tolerance of
 the HMA shall be such that no surface elevation lies above the Plan grade minus the specified
 Plan depth of portland cement concrete pavement. Prior to placing the portland cement
 concrete pavement, bring any such irregularities to the required tolerance by grinding or other
 means approved by the Engineer.
 When utility appurtenances such as manhole covers and valve boxes are located in
 the Traveled Way, pave the Roadway before the utility appurtenances are adjusted to the
 finished grade.

 80 percent analyzed in accordance with Section 1-06.2(2)D. In addition the Contractor
 shall fabricate, cure, and test five sets of cylinders, for evaluation of 28-day strengths,
 according to AASHTO T 22 and FOP for AASHTO T 23 using the same mix design as
 used in fabrication of the beams.
 	 Mix designs submitted by the Contractor shall provide a unique identification for each
 proposal and shall include test data confirming that concrete made in accordance with
 the proposed design will meet the requirements of these Specifications and the 28-day
 compressive strength result. Test data shall be from an independent testing lab or from
 a commercial concrete producer’s lab. If the test data is developed at a producer’s lab,
 the Engineer or a representative may witness all testing.
 3.	 Mix Design Modifications – The Contractor may initiate adjustments to the aggregate
 proportions of the approved mix design. An adjustment in both the fine and coarse
 aggregate batch target weights of plus or minus 200 pounds per cubic yard will be
 allowed without resubmittal of the mix design. The adjusted aggregate weights shall

 or nonstatistical acceptance. Determination of statistical or nonstatistical shall be based on
 Proposal quantities and shall consider the total of all Bid items involving of a specific class.
 Statistical acceptance will apply only to Contracts advertised, Awarded and administered
 by WSDOT, unless specifically provided otherwise in the Special Provisions. Contracting
 agencies other than WSDOT must specifically invoke statistical acceptance in their Special
 Provisions if it is desired.
 Statistical Acceptance, (1) applies only to WSDOT projects, (2) is administered under
 the provisions of Section 5-05.5, and (3) will be used for a class of mix when the Proposal
 quantities for that class of mix is 1,500 cubic yards or greater.

 The point of acceptance will be per WAQTC TM 2 or at the point of discharge when
 a pump is used.
 Acceptance of Concrete. The concrete producer shall provide a certificate of compliance
 for each truckload of concrete in accordance with Section 6-02.3(5)B.
 For the purpose of acceptance sampling and testing, a lot is defined as having a maximum
 of 15 sublots that was produced for the same class of mix. The final lot may be increased to
 25 sublots. All of the test results obtained from the same lot shall be evaluated collectively.
 The quantity represented by each sample will constitute a sublot. Sampling and testing shall
 be performed on a random basis at the frequency of one sample per sublot. Sublot size shall
 be determined to the nearest 10 cubic yards to provide not less than three uniform sized
 sublots with a maximum sublot size of 500 cubic yards.
 Acceptance testing for compliance of air content and 28-day compressive strength shall be
 conducted from samples prepared according to FOP for WAQTC TM 2. Air content shall be
 determined by conducting FOP for AASHTO T 152. Compressive strength shall be determined
 by FOP for AASHTO T 23 and AASHTO T 22.
 The Contractor shall provide cure boxes in accordance with Section 6-02.3(5)H, and
 protect concrete cylinders in cure boxes from excessive vibration and shock waves during
 the curing period in accordance with Section 6-02.3(6)D. Payment for cure boxes shall be
 in accordance with Section 6-02.5.
 Rejection of Concrete
 1.	 Rejection by the Contractor – The Contractor may, prior to sampling, elect to remove
 any defective material and replace it with new material at no expense to the Contracting
 Agency. Any such new material will be sampled, tested, and evaluated for acceptance.
 2.	 Rejection Without Testing – The Engineer may reject any load that appears defective
 prior to placement. Material rejected before placement shall not be incorporated into
 the pavement. No payment will be made for the rejected materials unless the Contractor
 requests that the rejected material be tested. If the Contractor elects to have the rejected
 materials tested, a sample will be taken and both the air content and strength shall
 be tested by WSDOT.
 Payment for rejected material will be based on the results of the one sample, which was
 taken and tested. If the rejected material fails either test, no payment will be made for the
 rejected material; in addition, the cost of sampling and testing at the rate of $250.00 per
 sample shall be borne by the Contractor. If the rejected material passes both tests, the mix
 will be compensated at a CPF of 1.00 and the cost of the sampling and testing will borne
 by the Contracting Agency.
 Statistical Acceptance
 The results of all acceptance testing performed in the field and the Composite Pay Factor
 (CPF) of the lot after three sublots have been tested will be available to the contractor through
 WSDOT’s website.
 The Specification limits as defined in Section 1-06.2(2)D shall be as follows. The lower
 Specification limit for Air Content shall be 3 percent, and the upper Specification limit for
 Air Content shall be 7 percent. The lower Specification limit for compressive strength shall
 be 4,000 psi.
 The price adjustment factor (fi) defined in Section 1-06.2(2)D shall be six for compressive
 strength and four for air content.
 If either the air content or compressive strength is not measured in accordance with this
 section its individual pay factor will be considered to be 1.00 in calculating the Composite
 Pay Factor.
 Non-Statistical Acceptance
 Concrete will be accepted based on conformance to the requirement for air content and
 the compressive strength at 28 days for sublots as tested and determined by the Contracting
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 5-47
 
 5-05
 
 Cement Concrete Pavement
 
 Agency. The lower Specification limit for air content shall be 3 percent, and the upper
 Specification limit for air content shall be 7 percent. The lower Specification limit for
 compressive strength shall be 4,000 psi.
 Each sublot will be deemed to have met the specified compressive strength requirement
 when both of the following conditions are met:
 1.	 Individual strength tests do not fall below the lower specification limit for strength
 by more than 12½ percent, or 500 psi, whichever is least.
 2.	 An individual strength test averaged with the two preceding individual strength tests
 meets or exceeds the lower specification limit for strength.
 When compressive strengths fail to satisfy one or both of the above requirements, the
 Contractor may request acceptance of in-place concrete strength based on core results. This
 method will not be used if the Engineer determines coring would be harmful to the integrity
 of the Structure. Cores, if allowed, will be obtained by the Contractor in accordance with
 AASHTO T 24 and delivered to the Contracting Agency for testing in accordance with
 AASHTO T 22. If the concrete in the Structure will be dry under service conditions, the core
 will be air-dried at a temperature of between 60°F and 80°F and at a relative humidity of less
 than 60 percent for 7 days before testing, and will be tested air dry.
 Acceptance for each sublot by the core method requires that the average compressive
 strength of three cores be at least 85 percent of the specified strength with no one core less
 than 75 percent of the specified strength. When the Contractor requests strength analysis by
 coring, the results obtained will be accepted by both parties as conclusive and supersede all
 other strength data for the concrete sublot.
 If the Contractor elects to core, cores shall be obtained no later than 50 days after initial
 concrete placement. The Engineer will concur in the locations to be cored. Repair of cored
 areas shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. The cost incurred in coring and testing
 these cores, including repair of core locations, shall be borne by the Contractor.
 5-05.3(5)  Mixing Concrete
 The concrete may be mixed in a batching plant or in truck mixers. The mixer shall be of
 an approved type and capacity. Mixing time shall be measured from the time all materials
 are in the drum. Ready-mixed concrete shall be mixed and delivered in accordance with the
 requirements of Sections 6-02.3(4), 6-02.3(4)A, and 6-02.3(4)B.
 When mixed in a batching plant, the mixing time shall not be less than 50 seconds nor
 more than 90 seconds.
 The mixer shall be operated at a drum speed as shown on the manufacturer’s nameplate
 on the mixer. Any concrete mixed less than the specified time shall be discarded and disposed
 of by the Contractor at no expense to the Contracting Agency. The volume of concrete mixed
 per batch shall not exceed the mixer’s rated capacity, as shown on the manufacturer’s standard
 rating plate on the mixer.
 Each concrete mixing machine shall be equipped with a device for counting automatically
 the number of batches mixed during the day’s operation.
 Retempering concrete by adding water or by other means will not be permitted.
 5-05.3(5)A  Limitations of Mixing
 Concrete shall not be mixed, placed, or finished when the natural light is inadequate,
 as determined by the Engineer, unless an adequate and approved artificial lighting system
 is operated.
 Mixing and placing concrete shall be discontinued when a descending air temperature in
 the shade away from artificial heat reaches 40ºF and shall not be resumed until an ascending
 air temperature in the shade and away from artificial heat reaches 35ºF unless authorized in
 writing by the Engineer.
 
 Page 5-48
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Cement Concrete Pavement
 
 5-05
 
 When mixing and placing is authorized during cold weather, the aggregates may be heated
 by either steam or dry heat prior to being placed in the mixer. The apparatus used shall heat the
 mass uniformly and shall be arranged to preclude the possible occurrence of overheated areas
 which might injure the materials. Unless otherwise authorized, the temperature of the mixed
 concrete shall be not less than 50ºF and not more than 90ºF at the time of discharge into the
 hauling conveyance. No concrete shall be mixed with frozen aggregates.
 5-05.3(6)  Surface Preparation
 The Subgrade surface shall be prepared and compacted a minimum of 3 feet beyond each
 edge of the area which is to receive concrete pavement in order to accommodate the slipform equipment.
 Concrete shall not be placed during a heavy rainfall. Prior to placing concrete:
 1.	 The surface shall be moist;
 2.	 Excess water (e.g., standing, pooling or flowing) shall be removed from the surface.
 3.	 The surface shall be clean and free of any deleterious materials.
 4.	 The surface temperature shall not exceed 120°F or be frozen.
 5-05.3(7)  Placing, Spreading, and Compacting Concrete
 The provisions relating to the frequency and amplitude of internal vibration shall be
 considered the minimum requirements and are intended to ensure adequate density in the
 hardened concrete. Referee testing of hardened concrete will be performed by cutting cores
 from the finished pavement after a minimum of 24 hours of curing. Density determination
 will be made based on the water content of the core as taken. WSDOT T 810 shall be used for
 the determination of core density. Reference cores will be taken at the minimum rate of one
 for each 500 cubic yards of pavement, or fraction thereof. These same cores will be used for
 thickness measurements as required by Section 5-05.5(1).
 The average density of the cores shall be at least 97 percent of the approved mix design
 density or the actual concrete density when determined by the Contractor using AASHTO
 T 121 with no cores having a density of less than 96 percent.
 Failure to meet the above requirement will be considered as evidence that the minimum
 requirements for vibration are inadequate for the job conditions, and additional vibrating
 units or other means of increasing the effect of vibration shall be employed so that the density
 of the hardened concrete as indicated by further referee testing shall conform to the above
 listed requirements. Primary units of pavement, as defined in Section 5-05.5(1), not meeting
 the prescribed minimum density shall be removed and replaced with satisfactory material.
 At the option of the Engineer, noncompliant material may be accepted at a reduced price.
 5-05.3(7)A  Slip-Form Construction
 The concrete shall be distributed uniformly into final position by a self-propelled slip-form
 paver without delay. The alignment and elevation of the paver shall be regulated from outside
 reference lines established for this purpose, or by an electronic control system capable of
 controlling the line and grade within required tolerances. The paver shall vibrate the concrete
 for the full width and depth of the strip of pavement being placed and the vibration shall
 be adequate to provide a consistency of concrete that will stand normal to the surface with
 sharp well-defined edges. The sliding forms shall be rigidly held together laterally to prevent
 spreading of the forms.
 The plastic concrete shall be effectively consolidated by internal vibration with transverse
 vibrating units for the full width of pavement and/or a series of equally spaced longitudinal
 vibrating units. The space from the outer edge of the pavement to the outer longitudinal
 unit shall not exceed 9 inches. The spacing of internal units shall be uniform and not exceed
 18 inches.
 The term internal vibration means vibration by vibrating units located within the specified
 thickness of pavement section.
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 5-49
 
 5-05
 
 Cement Concrete Pavement
 
 The rate of vibration of each vibrating unit shall be not less than 7,500 cycles per minute,
 and the amplitude of vibration shall be sufficient to be perceptible on the surface of the
 concrete along the entire length of the vibrating unit and for a distance of at least 1 foot.
 The frequency of vibration or amplitude shall be varied proportionately with the rate of
 travel to result in a uniform density and air content. The paving machine shall be equipped
 with a tachometer or other suitable device for measuring and indicating the actual frequency
 of vibrations.
 The concrete shall be held at a uniform consistency. The slip-form paver shall be operated
 with as nearly a continuous forward movement as possible and all operations of mixing,
 delivering, and spreading concrete shall be coordinated to provide uniform progress with
 stopping and starting of the paver held to a minimum. If, for any reason, it is necessary to stop
 the forward movement of the paver, the vibratory and tamping elements shall also be stopped
 immediately. No tractive force shall be applied to the machine, except that which is controlled
 from the machine.
 When concrete is being placed adjacent to an existing pavement, that part of the equipment
 which is supported on the existing pavement shall be equipped with protective pads on crawler
 tracks or rubber-tired wheels on which the bearing surface is offset to run a sufficient distance
 from the edge of the pavement to avoid breaking the pavement edge.
 5-05.3(7)B  Stationary Side Form Construction
 Side form sections shall be straight, free from warps, bends, indentations, or other defects.
 Defective forms shall be removed from the Work. Metal side forms shall be used unless other
 forms are approved by the Engineer.
 Side forms may be built up by rigidly attaching a section to either top or bottom of forms.
 If such buildup is attached to the top of metal forms, the buildup shall be of metal.
 Side forms shall be of sufficient rigidity, both in the form and in the interlocking
 connection with adjoining forms, that springing will not occur under the weight of grading
 and paving equipment or from the pressure of concrete. The Contractor shall provide sufficient
 forms so that there will be no delay in placing the concrete due to lack of forms.
 Before placing side forms, the underlying material shall be at the proper grade. Side forms
 shall be placed to the required grade and alignment of the edge of the finished pavement.
 Wood wedges may be used to adjust the form elevation provided they do not extend into
 the concrete. The forms shall be firmly supported during the entire operation of placing,
 compacting, and finishing the pavement.
 Forms shall be drilled in advance of being placed to line and grade to accommodate tie
 bars where these are specified.
 Immediately in advance of placing concrete and after all Subgrade operations are
 completed, side forms shall be trued and maintained to the required line and grade for a
 distance sufficient to prevent delay in placing concrete.
 Side forms shall remain in place at least 12 hours after the concrete has been placed, and
 in all cases until the edge of the pavement no longer requires the protection of the forms.
 Curing compound shall be applied to the concrete immediately after the forms are removed.
 Side forms shall be thoroughly cleaned and oiled each time they are used and before
 concrete is placed against them.
 Concrete shall be spread, screeded, shaped, and consolidated by one or more selfpropelled machines. These machines shall uniformly distribute and consolidate concrete
 without segregation so that completed pavement will conform to required cross section with
 a minimum of handwork.
 The number and capacity of machines furnished shall be adequate to perform the Work
 required at a rate equal to that of concrete delivery.
 Concrete for the full paving width shall be effectively consolidated by means of surface
 vibrators, in combination with internal vibrators, or by some other method of consolidation
 that produces equivalent results without segregation.

 When vibrators are used to consolidate concrete, the rate of vibration shall be not less
 than 3,500 cycles per minute for surface vibrators and shall be not less than 7,000 cycles
 per minute for internal vibrators. Amplitude of vibration shall be sufficient to be perceptible
 on the surface of the concrete more than 1 foot from the vibrating element. The Contractor
 shall furnish a tachometer or other suitable device for measuring and indicating frequency
 of vibration.
 Power to vibrators shall be connected so that vibration ceases when forward or backward
 motion of the machine is stopped.

 Longitudinal contraction joints shall be sawed as required to control cracking and as soon
 as practical after the initial control transverse contraction joints are completed.
 Any damage to the curing material during the sawing operations shall be repaired
 immediately after the sawing is completed.
 When cement concrete pavement is placed adjacent to existing cement concrete pavement,
 the vertical face of all existing working joints shall be covered with a bond-breaking material
 such as polyethylene film, roofing paper, or other material as approved by the Engineer.
 5-05.3(8)B  Sealing Sawed Contraction Joints
 Sawed contraction joints shall be filled with a joint sealant filler conforming to the
 requirements of Section 9-04.2. Joints shall be thoroughly clean at the time of sealing and
 if the hot-poured type is used the joints shall be dry. Care shall be taken to avoid air pockets.
 The hot-poured compound shall be applied in two or more layers, if necessary. The hot-poured
 compound and the cold-poured compound shall be applied under sufficient pressure to fill the
 groove from bottom to top and the cured joint sealant shall be between ¼ and ⅝ inch below
 the top surface of the concrete. The joint filled with cold-poured compound shall then be
 covered with a strip of nonabsorbent paper at least twice as wide as the joint and the paper
 shall be left in place.

 When fresh concrete pavement is to be placed against pre-project existing cement concrete
 pavement, tie bars shall be drilled and set into the existing pavement with an epoxy bonding
 agent in accordance with the Standard Plans and specified tolerances for placement of tie bars.
 The epoxy-bonding agent shall be either Type I or IV epoxy resin as specified in Section 9-26.
 The Contractor may use any method for drilling the holes, provided the method selected
 does not damage the existing concrete. Any damage caused by the Contractor’s operations
 shall be repaired by the Contractor at no cost to the Contracting Agency in accordance with
 Section 1-07.13.
 The tie bar holes shall be blown clean with compressed air before grouting. The bar shall
 be centered in the hole for the full length of embedment before grouting. The grout shall then
 be pumped into the hole around the bar in a manner that the back of the hole will be filled first.
 Blocking or shimming shall not impede the flow of the grout into the hole. Dams, if needed,
 shall be placed at the front of the holes to confine the grout. The dams shall permit the escape
 of air without leaking grout and shall not be removed until grout has cured in the hole.

 5-05.3(11)  Finishing
 After the concrete has been given a preliminary finish by means of finishing devices
 incorporated in the slip-form paving equipment, the surface of the fresh concrete shall be
 checked by the Contractor with a straightedge device not less than 10 feet in length. High
 areas indicated by the straightedge device shall be removed by the hand-float method. Each
 successive check with the straightedge device shall lap the previous check path by at least
 ½ of the length of the straightedge. The requirements of this paragraph may be waived if
 it is successfully demonstrated that other means will consistently produce a surface with
 a satisfactory profile index and meeting the 10-foot straightedge requirement specified in
 Section 5-05.3(12).
 Any edge slump of the pavement, exclusive of specified edging, in excess of ¼ inch
 shall be corrected before the concrete has hardened. If edge slump on any 1 foot or greater
 length of hardened concrete exceeds 1 inch, the concrete shall be repaired as provided in
 Section 5-05.3(22).
 The standard method of surface finish shall be longitudinal tining. In advance of curing
 operations, where longitudinal tining is required, the pavement shall be given an initial and
 a final texturing. Initial texturing shall be performed with a burlap drag or broom device that
 will produce striations parallel with the centerline. Final texturing shall be performed with a
 wire comb tine device that will produce grooves parallel with the centerline. The wire comb
 tine device shall be operated within 5 inches, but not closer than 3 inches, of pavement edges.
 Burlap drags, brooms, and tine devices shall be installed on self-propelled equipment
 having external alignment control. The installation shall be such that, when texturing, the
 area of burlap in contact with the pavement surface shall be maintained constant at all
 times. Broom and tine devices shall be provided with positive elevation control. Downward
 pressure on pavement surface shall be maintained at all times during texturing so as to achieve
 uniform texturing without measurable variations in pavement profile. Self-propelled texturing
 machines shall be operated so that travel speed when texturing is maintained constant. Failure
 of equipment to conform to all provisions in this paragraph shall constitute cause for stopping
 placement of concrete until the equipment deficiency or malfunction is corrected. The wire
 comb of the final texturing device shall be rectangular in cross section, 3/32 to 1/8 inch wide,
 on ¾-inch centers, ± 1/8-inch, and of sufficient length, thickness, and resilience to form grooves
 approximately 1/8 inch deep in the fresh concrete surface. Final texture shall be uniform in
 appearance with substantially all of the grooves having a depth between 1/16 and 3/16 inch.
 On projects requiring less than 1,000 square yards of cement concrete pavement, for
 irregular areas or areas not accessible to slip-form pavers, the surface finish may be either
 longitudinal tined or transverse tined.
 Transverse tining shall be done by texturing with a wire comb perpendicular to the
 centerline of the pavement. The wire comb tines shall be rectangular in cross section, 3/32 to
 1/8 inch wide, on ½-inch centers ± 1/8 inch, and of sufficient length, thickness, and resilience
 to form grooves approximately 1/8 inch deep in the fresh concrete surface. Final texture shall
 be uniform in appearance with substantially all of the grooves having a depth between 1/16 to
 3/16 inch. Finishing shall take place with the elements of the wire comb as nearly perpendicular
 to the concrete surface as is practical, to eliminate dragging the mortar.
 If the tining equipment has not been previously approved, a test section shall be
 constructed prior to approval of the equipment.
 Regardless of the surface finish, if the pavement has a raised curb without a formed
 concrete gutter, the texturing shall end 2 feet from the curb line.
 At the beginning and end of paving each day, the Contractor shall, with an approved stamp,
 indent the concrete surface near the right hand edge of the panel to indicate the date, month,
 and year of placement.
 At approximate 500-foot intervals where designated by the Engineer the Contractor shall,
 with an approved stamp, indent the concrete surface near the right hand edge of the pavement
 with the stationing of the Roadway.

 Cement Concrete Pavement
 
 5-05.3(12)  Surface Smoothness
 The pavement smoothness will be checked with equipment furnished and operated by
 the Contractor, under supervision of the Engineer, within 48 hours following placement of
 concrete. Smoothness of all pavement placed, except shoulders, ramp tapers, intersections,
 tight horizontal curves, and small or irregular areas as defined by Section 5-05.3(3),
 unless specified otherwise, will be measured with a recording profilograph, as specified in
 Section 5-05.3(3), parallel to centerline, from which the profile index will be determined in
 accordance with WSDOT T 807. Tight horizontal curves are curves having a centerline radius
 of curve less than 1,000 feet and pavement within the superelevation transition of those curves.
 For the purpose of qualifying the equipment and methods used by the Contractor, a daily
 profile index will be computed. For pavement placed in a 12-foot width or less, the daily
 profile index will be the average of two profiles made approximately 3 feet from and parallel
 to each edge of the pavement. If the pavement is placed in a width greater than 12 feet, the
 daily profile index will be computed as the average of profiles made approximately 3 feet from
 and parallel to each edge and at the approximate location of each planned longitudinal joint.
 The daily profile index of the finished pavement thus determined will be 7 inches per mile,
 or less. Only equipment and methods that consistently produce a finished surface meeting this
 requirement shall be used. Should the daily profile index exceed the rate of 7 inches per mile,
 the paving operations shall be discontinued until other methods or equipment are provided by
 the Contractor. Such revised methods and equipment shall again be discontinued if they do not
 produce a finished surface having a daily profile index of 7 inches per mile, or less. Operations
 shall not be resumed until the Engineer approves further changes in methods and equipment as
 proposed by the Contractor.
 All areas representing high points having deviations in excess of 0.3 inch as determined
 by procedures described in WSDOT T 807, shall be reduced by abrasive methods until such
 deviations do not exceed 0.1 inch as determined by reruns of the profilograph. High areas
 of individual profiles shall be reduced by abrasive means so that the profile index will not
 exceed 0.7 inch in any 0.1-mile section. All high areas in excess of 0.1 inch shall be reduced
 to 0.0 inch prior to reducing any high points of 0.1 inch or less. Low spots exceeding .25 inch
 shall be corrected in a manner approved by the Engineer.
 When any of the daily profile indexes exceed 7 inches per mile, final acceptance of the
 pavement for smoothness parallel to the centerline will be based on profile indexes as
 measured with the profilograph, operating by the Contractor under the supervision of the
 Engineer, along a line parallel to the edge of pavement and each longitudinal joint and will not
 be averaged for acceptance purposes. The final acceptance profile indexes will be measured
 after all corrective Work is complete and will demonstrate that all 0.1-mile sections on the
 project are within the 0.7-inch Specification.
 When cement concrete pavement abuts bridges, the finished pavement parallel to centerline
 within 15 feet of the abutting joint shall be uniform to a degree that no variations greater than
 ⅛ inch are present when tested with a 10-foot straightedge.
 When paving intersections, small or irregular areas, as defined in Section 5-05.3(3),
 surface smoothness will be measured with a 10-foot straightedge no later than 5:00 p.m. of
 the day following the placing of the concrete. A 10-foot straightedge will be placed parallel
 to the centerline so as to bridge any depressions and touch all high spots. Should the surface
 vary more than ⅛ inch from the lower edge of the straightedge, the high portion shall be
 reduced by the Contractor to the ⅛-inch tolerance by abrasive means at no expense to the
 Contracting Agency. It is further provided that if reduction of high portions of the surface
 involves breaking, dislodging, or other disturbance of the aggregates, such cutting will not be
 permitted until the pavement has achieved its design strength. If in the opinion of the Engineer
 irregularities cannot be satisfactorily removed by such methods, the Contractor shall remove
 and replace the pavement at no expense to the Contracting Agency.
 Smoothness perpendicular to the centerline will be measured with a 10-foot straightedge
 across all lanes with the same cross slope, including shoulders when composed of cement
 Page 5-54
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Cement Concrete Pavement
 
 5-05
 
 concrete pavement. The overlapping 10-foot straightedge measurement shall be discontinued
 at a point 6 inches from the most extreme outside edge of the finished cement concrete
 pavement. The transverse slope of the finished pavement shall be uniform to a degree such
 that no variations greater than ¼ inch are present when tested with a 10-foot long straightedge
 laid in a direction perpendicular to the centerline. Any areas that are in excess of this specified
 tolerance shall be corrected by abrasive means.
 5-05.3(13)  Curing
 Immediately after the finishing operations have been completed and as soon as marring of
 the concrete will not occur, the entire surface of the newly placed concrete shall be cured in
 accordance with one of the following methods the Contractor may elect.
 5-05.3(13)A  Curing Compound
 Liquid membrane-forming concrete curing compound Type 2 meeting the requirements of
 Section 9-23.2 shall be applied to the entire area of the exposed surface of the concrete with
 an approved mechanical spray machine. The spray fog shall be protected from the wind with
 an adequate shield. It shall be applied uniformly at the rate of one gallon to not more than
 150-square feet.
 The compound shall be applied with equipment of the pressure tank or pump type equipped
 with a feed tank agitator which ensures continuous agitation of the compound during spraying
 operations. The nozzle shall be of the two-line type with sufficient air to properly atomize
 the compound.
 The curing compound shall not be applied during or immediately after rainfall. If it
 becomes necessary to leave the pavement uncoated overnight, it shall be covered with
 polyethylene sheeting, which shall remain in place until weather conditions are favorable
 for the application of the curing compound.
 In the event that rain falls on the newly coated pavement before the film has dried
 sufficiently to resist damage, or in the event of damage to the film from any cause, the
 Contractor shall apply a new coat of curing compound in one or two applications to the
 affected area at the rate which, in the opinion of the Engineer, will result in a film of curing
 value equal to that specified in the original coat.
 Before placing the curing compound in the spray tank, it shall be thoroughly agitated
 as recommended by the Manufacturer. The compound shall not be diluted by the addition
 of solvents nor be altered in any manner. If the compound has become chilled to the extent
 that it is too viscous for proper stirring or application or if portions of the vehicle have been
 precipitated from solution, it shall be heated to restore proper fluidity but it shall not be heated
 above 100ºF. All curing compound shall have approval prior to placing in the spray tanks.
 The curing compound shall be applied immediately after the concrete has been finished and
 after any bleed water that has collected on the surface has disappeared, or at a time designated
 by the Engineer. If hair checking develops in the pavement before finishing is completed, the
 Engineer may order the application of the curing compound at an earlier stage, in which event
 any concrete cut from the surface in finishing operations shall be removed entirely from the
 pavement. If additional mortar is then needed to fill torn areas, it shall be obtained ahead of
 the spraying operations. All areas cut by finishing tools subsequent to the application of the
 curing compound shall immediately be given new applications at the rate specified above.
 The curing compound, after application, shall be protected by the Contractor from injury
 until the pavement has reached a minimum compressive strength of 2,500 psi. All traffic, either
 by foot or otherwise, shall be considered as injurious to the film of the applied compound.
 The Contractor shall provide on the job a sufficient quantity of white polyethylene sheeting
 to cover all the pavement laid in 3 hours of maximum operation. This sheeting shall be
 reserved exclusively for the protection of the pavement in case of rain or breakdown of the
 spray equipment used for applying the curing compound. The protective sheeting shall be
 placed over the pavement when ordered, and in the manner specified by the Engineer.
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 5-55
 
 5-05
 
 Cement Concrete Pavement
 
 Areas from which it is impossible to exclude traffic shall be protected by a covering of
 sand or earth not less than 1 foot in thickness or by other suitable and effective means. The
 protective covering shall be placed no earlier than 24 hours after application of the compound.
 The Contractor shall assume all liabilities for and protect the Contracting Agency from any
 damages or claims arising from the use of materials or processes described herein.
 5-05.3(13)B  White Polyethylene Sheeting
 The sheeting shall be placed over the pavement immediately after finishing operations are
 completed, or at a time designated by the Engineer.
 The sheeting shall be laid so that individual sheets overlap at least 2 feet, and the lapped
 areas shall be held in close contact with the pavement by weighting with earth or boards to
 prevent movement by the wind. The sheeting shall extend downward to cover the edges of the
 pavement and shall be secured to the Subgrade with a continuous bank of earth or surfacing
 material. Any holes occurring in the sheeting shall be patched immediately to the satisfaction
 of the Engineer. The sheeting shall be maintained against injury and remain in place until the
 pavement has reached a minimum compressive strength of 2,500 psi.
 5-05.3(13)C Wet Curing
 Wet curing shall be accomplished by applying a continuous fog or mist spray to the
 entire pavement surface until it has reached a minimum compressive strength of 2,500 psi.
 If water runoff is not a concern, continuous sprinkling is acceptable. Sprinkling shall not
 begin until the concrete has achieved initial set as determined by AASHTO T 197 or other
 approved method.
 5-05.3(14)  Cold Weather Work
 When the air temperature is expected to reach the freezing point during the day or night
 and the pavement has not reached 50 percent of its design strength or 2,500 psi which ever
 is greater the concrete shall be protected from freezing. The Contractor shall, at no expense
 to the Contracting Agency, provide a sufficient supply of straw, hay, grass, earth, blankets,
 or other suitable blanketing material and spread it over the pavement to a sufficient depth
 to prevent freezing of the concrete. The Contractor shall be responsible for the quality and
 strength of the concrete thus cured. Any concrete injured by frost action or freezing shall be
 removed and replaced at the Contractor’s expense in accordance with these Specifications.
 5-05.3(15)  Concrete Pavement Construction in Adjacent Lanes
 Unless otherwise shown in the Plans or in the Special Provisions, the pavement shall
 be constructed in multiple lanes; that is, two or more adjacent lanes paved in a single
 operation. Longitudinal contraction joints shall be used between adjacent lanes that are
 paved concurrently, and construction joints shall be used when lanes are paved separately.
 Tie bars shall be installed during initial lane construction.
 The Contractor shall replace, at no expense to the Contracting Agency, any panels on the
 new pavement that are cracked or broken as a result of the Contractor’s operations.
 5-05.3(16)  Protection of Pavement
 The Contractor shall protect the pavement and its appurtenances from any damage.
 Protection shall include personnel to direct traffic and the erection and maintenance of warning
 signs, lights, barricades, temporary take-down bridges across the pavement with adequate
 approaches, and whatever other means may be necessary to accommodate local traffic and
 to protect the pavement during the curing period or until opened to traffic as determined by
 the Engineer.
 The operation of construction equipment on the new pavement will not be allowed until
 the pavement has developed a compressive strength of 2,500 psi as determined from cylinders,
 made at the time of placement, cured under comparable conditions, and tested in accordance
 with AASHTO T 22. Exceptions would be one track from a slip-form paving machine when
 paving adjacent lanes or light vehicles required for sawing operations or taking cores.
 Page 5-56
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Cement Concrete Pavement
 
 5-05
 
 Placement of Shoulder material may commence when the pavement has developed a
 compressive strength of 1,800 psi as determined from cylinders made at the time of placement,
 cured under comparable conditions, and tested in accordance with AASHTO T22 as long as
 construction equipment is not operated on the new pavement.
 A continuous barrier of the design shown in the Plans shall be constructed and maintained
 along the edge of the pavement being constructed and adjacent to the portion of the Roadway
 used for traffic. The barriers shall be left in place until the new pavement is ready to be opened
 to traffic and shall then be removed by the Contractor.
 Any damage to the pavement occurring prior to final acceptance shall be replaced or
 repaired in accordance with Section 5-05.3(22).
 5-05.3(17)  Opening to Traffic
 The pavement may be opened to traffic when the concrete has developed a compressive
 strength of 2,500 psi as determined from cylinders, made at the time of placement, cured under
 comparable conditions, and tested in accordance with AASHTO T 22.
 Fabrication, curing, and testing of cylinders to measure early strength shall be the
 responsibility of the Contractor. The Contractor shall obtain the services of an independent
 Laboratory to perform these activities and these laboratories shall be approved by the
 Engineer. At the Contractor’s option, the time for opening pavement may be determined
 through the use of the maturity test in accordance with ASTM C1074. The Contractor shall
 develop the maturity-strength relationship and provide maturity curves along with supporting
 data for approval by the Engineer. The Contractor shall furnish all equipment, including
 thermal or maturity meter, thermocouples, wire, and qualified personnel to monitor maturity
 and provide information to the Engineer. Field procedures to monitor maturity shall be
 submitted to the Engineer for approval prior to use. The pavement shall not be opened to
 traffic until the maturity-strength relationship shows the pavement has a compressive strength
 of 2,500 psi and approved by the Engineer.
 The pavement shall be cleaned prior to opening to traffic.
 All costs associated with early-strength cylinders shall be at the Contractor’s expense.

 5-05.3(22)  Repair of Defective Pavement Slabs
 Broken slabs, slabs with random cracks, nonworking contraction joints near cracks,
 edge slumping and spalls along joints and cracks shall be replaced or repaired as specified
 at no expense to the Contracting Agency, and shall be accomplished prior to completion of
 joint sealing.
 Pavement slabs containing more than one crack shall be entirely removed and replaced.
 Pavement slabs containing a single crack shall be removed and replaced such that the
 minimum dimension of the removed slab is 6 feet long and full panel width. The portion of
 the panel to remain in place shall have a minimum dimension of 6 feet in length and full panel
 width, otherwise entire removal and replacement of the slab is required. There shall be no new
 joints closer than 3 feet to an existing transverse joints. Saw cutting full pavement depth is
 required along all longitudinal joints and at transverse locations. Tie bars and dowel bars shall
 be used in accordance Section 5-05.3(10).
 Spalls and edge slumping shall be repaired by making vertical saw cuts at least 3 inches
 outside the affected area and to a minimum depth of 2 inches. Spall repairs that encounter
 dowel bars or are within 6 inches of a dowel bar will not be permitted. These spall areas shall
 be repaired by replacing a half or full panel as permitted by the Engineer. Removal of the
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 5-57
 
 5-05
 
 Cement Concrete Pavement
 
 existing pavement shall not damage any pavement to be left in place. If jackhammers are used
 for removing pavement, they shall not weigh more than 30 pounds, and chipping hammers
 shall not weigh more than 15 pounds. All power-driven hand tools used for the removal of
 pavement shall be operated at angles less than 45 degrees as measured from the surface of
 the pavement to the tool. The patch limits shall extend beyond the spalled area a minimum
 of 3 inches. Repair areas shall be kept square or rectangular. Repair areas that are within
 12 inches of another repair area shall be combined.
 The Contractor shall remove material within the perimeter of the saw cut to a depth of
 2 inches, or to sound concrete as determined by the Engineer. The surface patch area shall be
 sandblasted and all loose material removed. All sandblasting residue shall be removed using
 dry oil-free air.
 When a partial depth repair is placed directly against an adjacent longitudinal joint, a bondbreaking material such as polyethylene film, roofing paper, or other material as approved by
 the Engineer shall be placed between the existing concrete and the area to be patched.
 Patches that abut working transverse joints or cracks require placement of a compressible
 insert. The new joint or crack shall be formed to the same width as the existing joint or
 crack. The compressible joint material shall be placed into the existing joint 1 inch below the
 depth of repair. The compressible insert shall extend at least 3 inches beyond each end of the
 patch boundaries.
 Patches that abut the lane/shoulder joint require placement of a formed edge, along the slab
 edge, even with the surface.
 The patching material shall be mixed, placed, consolidated, finished, and cured according
 to manufacturer’s recommendations. Slab/patch interfaces that will not receive pavement
 grinding shall be sealed (painted) with a 1:1 cement-water grout along the patch perimeter.
 The Contractor shall reseal all joints in accordance with Section 5-05.3(8)B.
 Opening to traffic shall meet the requirements of Section 5-05.3(17).
 Low areas which grinding cannot feasibly remedy, shall be sandblasted, filled with
 epoxy bonded mortar, and textured by grinding. The epoxy bonding agent shall meet the
 requirements of Section 9-26.1(1)B for Type II epoxy.
 5-05.4 Measurement
 Cement concrete pavement will be measured by the cubic yard for the completed
 pavement. The volume will be determined from measurements taken as listed below.
 1.	 The width measurement will be the width of the pavement shown on the typical crosssection in the Plans, additional widening where called for, or as otherwise specified in
 writing by the Engineer.
 2.	 The length will be measured along the center of each Roadway or ramp.
 3.	 The depth will be determined from the reference cores. The depth utilized to calculate
 the volume shall not exceed the Plan depth plus 0.04 feet.
 The volume of the pavement section represented by the reference core shall equal the
 measured length × width × reference core depth.
 Corrosion resistant dowel bar will be measured per each for the actual number of bars used
 in the completed Work.
 Tie bar with drill hole will be measured per each for the actual number of bars used
 in the completed Work. Tie bars with drill holes in cement concrete pavement placed under
 the Contract will not be measured.
 The ride smoothness compliance adjustment calculation is the volume of pavement,
 in cubic yards, represented by the profilograph.
 The calculation for portland cement concrete compliance adjustment is the volume
 of concrete represented by the CPF and the Thickness deficiency adjustment.

 adjustment, times the percent of adjustment determined from the calculated CPF and the
 Deficiency Adjustment listed in Section 5-05.5(1)A.
 5-05.5(1)  Pavement Thickness
 Cement concrete pavement shall be constructed in accordance with the thickness
 requirements in the Plans and Specifications. Tolerances allowed for Subgrade construction
 and other provisions, which may affect thickness, shall not be construed to modify such
 thickness requirements.
 A primary unit of pavement is defined as the area of pavement placed in each day’s paving
 operations or a complete intersection. Within such primary unit of pavement, there may be
 an area or areas, which are deficient in thickness by more than 0.05 foot. This deficient area
 or areas will be defined as a secondary unit or units. If secondary units are found to exist,
 the primary unit area will be reduced by the secondary unit area included therein. At a time
 determined by the Engineer, thickness measurements will be made in each primary unit of
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 5-59
 
 5-05
 
 Cement Concrete Pavement
 
 pavement at the minimum rate of one measurement for each 500 cubic yards of pavement,
 or fraction thereof. The exact location and number of thickness measurements within each
 primary unit, both longitudinally and transversely, will be determined by the Engineer.
 In general, thickness measurements will be made at uniform intervals throughout each
 primary unit of pavement.
 If thickness deficiencies greater than 0.05 foot are found to exist, supplemental thickness
 measurements will be made in accordance with Section 5-05.5(1)B. Pavement thickness
 variations, if any, from the thickness requirements in the Plans and Specifications will be
 determined by comparing the actual thickness measurement with the thickness specified
 at the location where the measurement was made. Such variation will be determined to the
 nearest 0.01 foot as either excess or deficient thickness.
 Additional cores may be requested by the Contractor to isolate the area that has a thickness
 deficiency within the 0.05 feet of the design thickness. These cores will be used to create a
 secondary unit. All costs for the additional cores including grouting the core holes will be the
 responsibility of the Contractor.
 5-05.5(1)A  Thickness Deficiency of 0.05 Foot or Less
 If no thickness measurements in a primary unit are deficient by more than 0.05 foot, all
 thickness measurements in such unit will be averaged to the nearest 0.01 foot to determine
 the average thickness deficiency, if any, in that primary unit. For the purpose of determining
 the average thickness deficiency, an excess thickness variation of more than 0.04 foot will be
 considered to be 0.04 foot greater than the specified thickness.
 For each primary unit of pavement which is deficient in average thickness by not more
 than 0.05 foot, the Contractor shall pay to the Contracting Agency, or the Contracting Agency
 may deduct from any moneys due or that may become due the Contractor under the Contract,
 a sum computed by multiplying the deficiency adjustment from the following table by the unit
 Contract price by the volume of such unit.

 5-05.5(1)B  Thickness Deficiency of More Than 0.05 Foot
 Where a thickness deficiency greater than 0.05 foot is encountered, the Engineer will
 determine from supplemental thickness measurements the limits of the secondary unit area.
 Thickness measurements will be made in each panel of pavement adjacent transversely
 and longitudinally to the panel of the original measurement. This procedure will continue,
 regardless of unit boundaries, until such secondary unit area is bounded by panels with a
 thickness deficiency of 0.05 foot or less. Cores taken to isolate the secondary unit will not
 be used to compute average thickness of the primary unit.
 Panels are the areas bounded by longitudinal and transverse joints and pavement edges.
 If longitudinal or transverse joints are eliminated by the Special Provisions, by the Plans, or
 for any other reasons, the limits of panels will be determined by the Engineer as if such joints
 had been constructed.
 The secondary unit area will be made up of entire panels only. The entire panel will be
 considered to be of the thickness shown by measurement.
 After the Engineer has determined the limits of the secondary unit area, a further
 determination will be made whether any panels within this area are usable and may be left in
 place. Following this determination, the Contractor shall remove and replace at no expense
 to the Contracting Agency such panels as the Engineer may designate in accordance with
 the following:
 Page 5-60
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Cement Concrete Pavement
 
 5-05
 
 If the area to be removed is not bounded by longitudinal or transverse joints, the Contractor
 shall saw, at no expense to the Contracting Agency, weakened plane joints at the locations
 designated by the Engineer. The Subgrade shall be lowered to meet the full thickness
 requirements. The replaced pavement will be tested for thickness by means of additional
 measurements and will be subject to all of the requirements of the Specifications.

 The Engineer is not responsible for any delays to the Contractor due to problems in getting the
 plant certified.
 6-02.3(4)A  Qualification of Concrete Suppliers
 Batch Plant Prequalification requires a certification by the National Ready Mix Concrete
 Association (NRMCA). Information concerning NRMCA certification may be obtained from
 the NRMCA at 900 Spring Street, Silver Springs, MD 20910 or online at www.nrmca.org.
 The NRMCA certification shall be valid for a 2-year period from the date of certificate. The
 following documentation shall be submitted to the Engineer; a copy of the current NRMCA
 Certificate of Conformance, the concrete mix design(s) (WSDOT Form 350-040), along with
 copies of the truck list, batch plant scale certification, admixture dispensing certification, and
 volumetric water batching devices (including water meters) verification.
 For central-mixed concrete, the mixer shall be equipped with a timer that prevents the
 batch from discharging until the batch has been mixed for the prescribed mixing time.
 A mixing time of 1 minute will be required after all materials and water have been introduced
 into the drum. Shorter mixing time may be allowed if the mixer performance is tested in
 accordance with (AASHTO M157 Annex A1 Concrete Uniformity Requirements). Tests
 shall be conducted by an independent testing lab or by a commercial concrete producer’s lab.
 If the tests are performed by a producer’s lab, the Engineer or a representative will witness
 all testing.
 For shrink-mixed concrete, the mixing time in the stationary mixer shall not be less than
 30 seconds or until the ingredients have been thoroughly blended.
 For transit-mixed or shrink-mixed concrete, the mixing time in the transit mixer shall be
 a minimum of 70 revolutions at the mixing speed designated by the manufacturer of the mixer.
 Following mixing, the concrete in the transit mixer may be agitated at the manufacturer’s
 designated agitation speed. A maximum of 320 revolutions (total of mixing and agitation) will
 be permitted prior to discharge.
 
 Page 6-8
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02
 
 All transit-mixers shall be equipped with an operational revolution counter and a functional
 device for measurement of water added. All mixing drums shall be free of concrete buildup
 and the mixing blades shall meet the minimum Specifications of the drum manufacturer.
 A copy of the manufacturer’s blade dimensions and configuration shall be on file at the
 concrete producer’s office. A clearly visible metal data plate (or plates) attached to each mixer
 and agitator shall display: (1) the maximum concrete capacity of the drum or container for
 mixing and agitating, and (2) the rotation speed of the drum or blades for both the agitation
 and mixing speeds. Mixers and agitators shall always operate within the capacity and
 speed-of-rotation limits set by the manufacturer. Any mixer, when fully loaded, shall keep
 the concrete uniformly mixed. All mixers and agitators shall be capable of discharging the
 concrete at a steady rate. Only those transit-mixers which meet the above requirements will be
 allowed to deliver concrete to any Contracting Agency project covered by these Specifications.
 In transit-mixing, mixing shall begin within 30 seconds after the cement is added
 to the aggregates.
 Central-mixed concrete, transported by truck mixer/agitator, shall not undergo more
 than 250 revolutions of the drum or blades before beginning discharging. To remain below
 this limit, the suppler may agitate the concrete intermittently within the prescribed time
 limit. When water or admixtures are added after the load is initially mixed, an additional
 30 revolutions will be required at the recommended mixing speed.
 For each project, at least biannually, or as required, the Plant Manager will examine
 mixers and agitators to check for any buildup of hardened concrete or worn blades. If this
 examination reveals a problem, or if the Engineer wishes to test the quality of the concrete,
 slump tests may be performed with samples taken at approximately the ¼ and ¾ points as
 the batch is discharged. The maximum allowable slump difference shall be as follows:
 If the average of the two slump tests is < 4 inches, the difference shall be < 1 inch or
 if the average of the two slump tests is >4 inches, the difference shall be < 1½ inches.
 If the slump difference exceeds these limits, the equipment shall not be used until the
 faulty condition is corrected. However, the equipment may continue in use if longer mixing
 times or smaller loads produce batches that pass the slump uniformity tests.
 All concrete production facilities will be subject to verification inspections at the discretion
 of the Engineer. Verification inspections are a check for: current scale certifications; accuracy
 of water metering devices; accuracy of the batching process; and verification of coarse
 aggregate quality.
 If the concrete producer fails to pass the verification inspection, the following actions will
 be taken:
 1.	 For the first violation, a written warning will be provided.
 2.	 For the second violation, the Engineer will give written notification and the Contracting
 Agency will assess a price reduction equal to 15 percent of the invoice cost of the
 concrete that is supplied from the time of the infraction until the deficient condition
 is corrected.
 3.	 For the third violation, the concrete supplier is suspended from providing
 concrete until all such deficiencies causing the violation have been permanently
 corrected and the plant and equipment have been reinspected and meets all the
 prequalification requirements.
 4.	 For the fourth violation, the concrete supplier shall be disqualified from supplying
 concrete for 1 year from the date of disqualification. At the end of the suspension period
 the concrete supplier may request that the facilities be inspected for prequalification.
 6-02.3(4)B Jobsite Mixing
 For small quantities of concrete, the Contractor may mix concrete on the job site provided
 the Contractor has requested in writing and received written permission from the Engineer.
 The Contractor’s written request shall include a mix design, batching and mixing procedures,
 and a list of the equipment performing the job-site mixing. All job site mixed concrete shall
 be mixed in a mechanical mixer.
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 Concrete Structures
 
 If the Engineer permits, hand mixing of concrete will be permitted for pipe collars, pipe
 plugs, fence posts, or other items receiving the concurrence of the Engineer, provided the hand
 mixing is done on a watertight platform in a way that distributes materials evenly throughout
 the mass. Mixing shall continue long enough to produce a uniform mixture. No hand mixed
 batch shall exceed ½ cubic yard.
 Concrete mixed at the jobsite is never permitted for placement in water.
 6-02.3(4)C Consistency
 The maximum slump for concrete shall be:
 1.	 3½ inches for vibrated concrete placed in all bridge decks, bridge approach slabs,
 and flat slab bridge Superstructures.
 2.	 4½ inches for all other vibrated concrete.
 3.	 7 inches for non-vibrated concrete. (Includes Class 4000P)
 4.	 9 inches for shafts when using Class 4000P, provided the water cement ratio does not
 exceed 0.44 and a water reducer is used meeting the requirements of Section 9-23.6.
 5.	 5½ inches for all concrete placed in curbs, gutters, and sidewalks.
 When a high range water reducer is used, the maximum slump listed in 1, 2, 3, and
 5 above, may be increased an additional 2 inches.
 For self-consolidating concrete (SCC), the slump requirements specified above do not
 apply, and are instead replaced by the target slump flow and slump flow range specified as part
 of the SCC mix design.
 6-02.3(4)D  Temperature and Time For Placement
 Concrete temperatures shall remain between 55°F and 90°F while it is being placed,
 except that Class 4000D concrete temperatures shall remain between 55°F and 75°F during
 placement. Precast concrete that is heat cured in accordance with Section 6-02.3(25)D shall
 remain between 50°F and 90°F while being placed. The batch of concrete shall be discharged
 at the project site no more than 1½ hours after the cement is added to the concrete mixture.
 The time to discharge may be extended to 1¾ hours if the temperature of the concrete being
 placed is less than 75°F. With the concurrence of the Engineer and as long as the temperature
 of the concrete being placed is below 75°F, the maximum time to discharge may be extended
 to 2 hours. When conditions are such that the concrete may experience an accelerated initial
 set, the Engineer may require a shorter time to discharge. The time to discharge may be
 extended upon written request from the Contractor. This time extension will be considered
 on a case by case basis and requires the use of specific retardation admixtures and the
 concurrence of the Engineer.
 6-02.3(5)  Acceptance of Concrete
 6-02.3(5)A General
 Concrete for the following applications will be accepted based on a Certificate of
 Compliance to be provided by the supplier as described in Section 6-02.3(5)B:
 1.	 Lean concrete.
 2.	 Commercial concrete.
 3.	 Class 4000P concrete for Roadside Steel Sign Support Foundations.
 4.	 Class 4000P concrete for Type II, III, and CCTV Signal Standard Foundations that are
 12’-0” or less in depth.
 5.	 Class 4000P concrete for Type IV and V Strain Pole Foundations that are 12’-0” or less
 in depth.
 6.	 Class 4000P concrete for Steel Light Standard Foundations Types A & B.
 Slip-form barrier concrete will be accepted based on conformance to the requirements
 for temperature, air content and compressive strength at 28 days for sublots as tested
 and determined by the Contracting Agency. All other concrete will be accepted based on
 Page 6-10
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02
 
 conformance to the requirement for temperature, slump, air content for concrete placed above
 finished ground line, and the specified compressive strength at 28 days for sublots as tested
 and determined by the Contracting Agency.
 A sublot is defined as the material represented by an individual strength test. An individual
 strength test is the average compressive strength of cylinders from the same sample
 of material.
 Each sublot will be deemed to have met the specified compressive strength requirement
 when both of the following conditions are met:
 1.	 Individual strength tests do not fall below the specified strength by more than
 12½ percent or 500 psi, whichever is least.
 2.	 An individual strength test averaged with the two preceding individual strength tests
 meets or exceeds specified strength (for the same class and exact mix I.D. of concrete
 on the same Contract).
 When compressive strengths fail to satisfy one or both of the above requirements, the
 Contractor may:
 1.	 Request acceptance based on the Contractor/Suppliers strength test data for
 cylinders made from the same truckload of concrete as the Contracting Agency
 cylinders; provided:
 a.	 The Contractor’s test results are obtained from testing cylinders fabricated, handled,
 and stored for 28 days in accordance with FOP for AASHTO T 23 and tested in
 accordance with AASHTO T 22. The test cylinders shall be the same size cylinders
 as those cast by the Contracting Agency.
 b.	 The technician fabricating the cylinders is qualified by either ACI, Grade 1 or
 WAQTC to perform this Work.
 c.	 The Laboratory performing the tests in accordance with AASHTO T 22 has an
 equipment calibration/certification system, and a technician training and evaluation
 process in accordance with AASHTO R-18.
 d.	 Both the Contractor and Contracting Agency have at least 15 test results from the
 same mix to compare. The Contractor’s results could be used if the Contractor’s
 computed average of all their test results is within one standard deviation of the
 Contracting Agency’s average test result. The computed standard deviation of the
 Contractor’s results must also be within plus or minus 200 psi of the Contracting
 Agency’s standard deviation.
 2.	 Request acceptance of in-place concrete strength based on core results. This method
 will not be used if the Engineer determines coring would be harmful to the integrity of
 the Structure. Cores, if allowed, will be obtained by the Contractor in accordance with
 AASHTO T 24 and delivered to the Contracting Agency for testing in accordance with
 AASHTO T 22. If the concrete in the Structure will be dry under service conditions,
 the core will be air dried at a temperature of between 60°F and 80°F and at a relative
 humidity of less than 60 percent for 7 days before testing, and will be tested air dry.
 Acceptance for each sublot by the core method requires that the average compressive
 strength of three cores be at least 85 percent of the specified strength with no one core less
 than 75 percent of the specified strength. When the Contractor requests strength analysis by
 coring, the results obtained will be accepted by both parties as conclusive and supersede all
 other strength data for the concrete sublot.
 If the Contractor elects to core, cores shall be obtained no later than 50 days after initial
 concrete placement. The Engineer will concur in the locations to be cored. Repair of cored
 areas shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. The cost incurred in coring and testing
 these cores, including repair of core locations, shall be borne by the Contractor.

 6-02.3(5)E  Point of Acceptance
 Determination of concrete properties for acceptance will be made based on samples taken
 as follows:
 Bridge decks, overlays, bridge approach slabs, and barriers at the discharge of the
 placement system. All other placements at the truck discharge.
 It shall be the Contractor’s responsibility to provide adequate and representative samples
 of the fresh concrete to a location designated by the Engineer for the testing of concrete
 properties and making of cylinder specimens. Samples shall be provided as directed in
 Sections 1-06.1 and 1-06.2. Once the Contractor has turned over the concrete for acceptance
 testing, no more mix adjustment will be allowed. The concrete will either be accepted
 or rejected.
 6-02.3(5)F  Water/Cement Ratio Conformance
 The actual water cement ratio shall be determined from the certified proportions of the mix,
 adjusting for on the job additions. No water may be added after acceptance testing or after
 placement has begun, except for concrete used in slip forming. For slip-formed concrete, water
 may be added during placement but shall not exceed the maximum water cement ratio in the
 mix design, and shall meet the requirements for consistency as described in Section 6-02.3(4)C.
 If water is added, an air and temperature test shall be taken prior to resuming placement to
 ensure that Specification conformance has been maintained.
 6-02.3(5)G  Sampling and Testing for Temperature, Consistency, and Air Content
 Concrete properties shall be determined from concrete as delivered to the project and as
 accepted by the Contractor for placement. The Contracting Agency will perform acceptance
 testing on all concrete for temperature and air content, if applicable. Concrete that is not selfconsolidating concrete will be tested for slump. The following additional acceptance tests will
 be performed on self-consolidating concrete:
 1.	 Slump flow within the target slump flow range.
 2.	 J ring passing ability less than or equal to 1.5 inches.
 3.	 VSI less than or equal to 1.
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-13
 
 6-02
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 Sampling and testing will be performed before concrete placement from the first load.
 Concrete shall not be placed until all tests have been completed by the Engineer, and the
 results indicate that the concrete is within acceptable limits. If the concrete is not within
 acceptable limits, sampling and testing will continue before concrete placement for each load
 until one load meets all of the applicable acceptance requirements. After one test indicates that
 the concrete is within specified limits, the concrete may be placed and the sampling and testing
 frequency may decrease to one for every 100 cubic yards. Sampling shall be performed in
 accordance with FOP for WAQTC TM 2 and random samples shall be selected in accordance
 with WSDOT T 716. After the first acceptable load of concrete, up to ½ cubic yard may be
 placed from subsequent loads to be tested prior to testing for acceptance.
 When the results for any subsequent acceptance test indicates that the concrete as delivered
 and approved by the Contractor for placement does not conform to the specified limits, the
 sampling and testing frequency will be resumed for each load. Whenever one subsequent
 test indicates that the concrete is within the specified limits, the random sampling and testing
 frequency of one for every 100 cubic yards may resume.
 Sampling and testing for a placement of one class of concrete consisting of 50 cubic
 yards or less will be as listed above, except that after one set of tests indicate that the
 concrete is within specified limits, the remaining concrete to be placed may be accepted by
 visual inspection.
 6-02.3(5)H  Sampling and Testing for Compressive Strength and Initial Curing
 Acceptance testing for compressive strength shall be conducted at the same frequency
 as the acceptance tests for temperature, consistency, and air content.
 The Contractor shall provide and maintain a sufficient number of cure boxes in accordance
 with FOP for AASHTO T 23 for curing concrete cylinders. The cure boxes shall be readily
 accessible and no more than 500 feet from the point of acceptance testing, unless otherwise
 allowed by the Engineer. The Contractor shall also provide, maintain and operate all necessary
 power sources and connections needed to operate the cure boxes. The cure boxes shall be
 in-place and functioning at the specified temperature for curing cylinders prior to concrete
 placement. Concrete cylinders shall be cured in the cure boxes in accordance with FOP for
 AASHTO T 23. The cure boxes shall have working locks and the Contractor shall provide
 the Engineer with one key to each of the locks. Once concrete cylinders are placed in the cure
 box, the cure box shall not be disturbed until the cylinders have been removed. The Contractor
 shall retain the cure box Temperature Measuring Device log and provide it to the Engineer
 upon request.
 The Contractor shall protect concrete cylinders in cure boxes from excessive vibration
 and shock waves during the curing period in accordance with Section 6-02.3(6)D.
 All cure box costs shall be incidental to the associated item of work.
 6-02.3(5)I  Test Section for Cast-In-Place SCC
 Unless otherwise approved by the Engineer, the Contractor shall construct a test section of
 the element being constructed of cast-in-place SCC. The Contractor shall confirm, through the
 SCC placement operation in the test section, the SCC flows the distance required, completely
 filling the forms and encapsulating the reinforcement as required without leaving voids and
 pockets and causing segregation of the SCC mix. The test section forms, reinforcing steel and
 concrete placing operations shall be identical to those to be used in the production elements.
 For horizontal elements, the test section shall simulate the flow of concrete for the
 maximum distance anticipated during production concrete placement. The depth and width of
 the test section for horizontal element may be smaller than the actual depth and width of the
 element to be cast. For vertical elements, the test section shall be a minimum of 33-percent of
 the height of the tallest element to be constructed. The Contractor shall submit Type 2 Working
 Drawings consisting of formwork and reinforcement details of the test section and SCC
 placement procedures.
 Page 6-14
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02
 
 After removing the forms, the test section will be inspected for signs of honeycombs,
 cracks, aggregate segregation, sedimentation, cold joints, and other surface and concrete
 placement defects. If such defects are present, the Contractor shall revise the formwork and
 SCC placement procedures as necessary to eliminate such defects.
 Acceptance of the test section and the SCC mix design is contingent on acceptable visual
 inspection, and a minimum of two 4-inch minimum diameter core samples taken from the
 placement location and the furthest-most limits of the concrete as identified by the Engineer.
 The number of core locations will be specified by the Engineer. The difference in average unit
 weight of the locations represented by the core samples shall be less than 5-percent.
 The Contractor shall use the same SCC placement procedures confirmed by the Engineer
 accepted test section for casting the production members.
 6-02.3(5)J Vacant
 6-02.3(5)K  Rejecting Concrete
 Rejection Without Testing – The Engineer, prior to sampling, may reject any batch or
 load of concrete that appears defective in composition; such as cement content or aggregate
 proportions. Rejected material shall not be incorporated in the Structure.
 6-02.3(5)L  Concrete With Non-Conforming Strength
 Concrete with cylinder compressive strengths (fc) that fail to meet acceptance level
 requirements shall be evaluated for structural adequacy. If the material is found to be adequate,
 payment shall be adjusted in accordance with the following formula:
 2(f’c – fc)(UP)(Q)
 Pay adjustment =
 f’c
 Where:
 f’c

 Quantity of concrete represented by an acceptance test based on the
 required frequency of testing.
 
 Where these Specifications designate payment for the concrete on other than a per cubic
 yard basis, the unit Contract price of concrete shall be taken as $300 per cubic yard for
 concrete Class 4000, 5000, and 6000. For concrete Class 3000, the unit contract price for
 Concrete shall be $160 per cubic yard.
 6-02.3(6)  Placing Concrete
 The Contractor shall not place concrete:
 1.	 On frozen or ice-coated ground or Subgrade;
 2.	 Against or on ice-coated forms, reinforcing steel, structural steel, conduits, precast
 members, or construction joints;
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-15
 
 6-02
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 3.	 Under rainy conditions; placing of concrete shall be stopped before the quantity of
 surface water is sufficient to affect or damage surface mortar quality or cause a flow
 or wash the concrete surface;
 4.	 In any foundation until the Engineer has accepted its depth and character;
 5.	 In any form until the Engineer has accepted it and the placement of any reinforcing
 in it; or
 6.	 In any Work area when vibrations from nearby Work may harm the concrete’s initial
 set or strength.
 When a foundation excavation contains water, the Contractor shall pump it dry before
 placing concrete. If this is impossible, an underwater concrete seal shall be placed that
 complies with Section 6-02.3(6)B. This seal shall be thick enough to resist any uplift.
 All foundations, forms, and contacting concrete surfaces shall be moistened with water just
 before the concrete is placed. Any standing water on the foundation, on the concrete surface,
 or in the form shall be removed.
 The Contractor shall place concrete in the forms as soon as possible after mixing. The
 concrete shall always be plastic and workable. For this reason, the Engineer may reduce the
 time to discharge even further. Concrete placement shall be continuous, with no interruption
 longer than 30 minutes between adjoining layers unless the Engineer allows a longer time. The
 Type 2 Working Drawing submittal shall include justification that the concrete mix design will
 remain fluid for interruptions longer than 30 minutes between placements. Each layer shall be
 placed and consolidated before the preceding layer takes initial set. After initial set, the forms
 shall not be jarred, and projecting ends of reinforcing bars shall not be disturbed.
 In girders or walls, concrete shall be placed in continuous, horizontal layers 1½ to 2½ feet
 deep. Compaction shall leave no line of separation between layers. In each part of a form, the
 concrete shall be deposited as near its final position as possible.
 Any method for placing and consolidating shall not segregate aggregates or displace
 reinforcing steel. Any method shall leave a compact, dense, and impervious concrete with
 smooth faces on exposed surfaces. Plastering is not permitted. Any section of defective
 concrete shall be removed at the Contractor’s expense.
 To prevent aggregates from separating, the length of any conveyor belt used to transport
 concrete shall not exceed 300 feet. If the mix needs protection from sun or rain, the
 Contractor shall cover the belt. When concrete pumps are used for placement, a Contractor’s
 representative shall, prior to use on the first placement of each day, visually inspect the pumps
 water chamber for water leakage. No pump shall be used that allows free water to flow past
 the piston.
 If a concrete pump is used as the placing system, the pump priming slurry shall be
 discarded before placement. Initial acceptance testing may be delayed until the pump priming
 slurry has been eliminated from the concrete being pumped. Eliminating the priming slurry
 from the concrete may require that several cubic yards of concrete are discharged through the
 pumping system and discarded. Use of a concrete pump requires a reserve pump (or other
 backup equipment) at the site.
 If the concrete will drop more than 5 feet, it shall be deposited through a sheet metal (or
 other accepted) conduit. If the form slopes, the concrete shall be lowered through accepted
 conduit to keep it from sliding down one side of the form. No aluminum conduits or tremies
 shall be used to pump or place concrete.
 Before placing bridge deck concrete on steel spans, the Contractor shall release the
 falsework under the bridge and let the span swing free on its supports. Concrete in flat slab
 bridges shall be placed in one continuous operation for each span or series of continuous spans.
 Concrete for bridge decks and the stems of T-beams or box-girders shall be placed in
 separate operations if the stem of the beam or girder is more than 3 feet deep. First the beam
 or girder stem shall be filled to the bottom of the slab fillets. Bridge deck concrete shall not be
 placed until enough time has passed to permit the earlier concrete to shrink (at least 12 hours).
 Page 6-16
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02
 
 If stem depth is 3 feet or less, the Contractor may place concrete in 1 continuous operation if
 the Engineer concurs.
 Between expansion or construction joints, concrete in beams, girders, bridge decks,
 piers, columns, walls, and traffic and pedestrian barriers, etc., shall be placed in a
 continuous operation.
 No traffic or pedestrian barrier shall be placed until after the bridge deck is complete for
 the entire Structure. No concrete barriers shall be placed until the falsework has been released
 and the span supports itself. The Contractor may choose not to release the deck overhang
 falsework prior to the barrier placement. The Contractor shall submit Type 2E Working
 Drawings consisting of calculations indicating the loads induced into the girder webs due
 to the barrier weight and any live load placed on the Structure do not exceed the design
 capacity of the girder component. This analysis is not required for bridges with concrete
 Superstructures. No barrier, curb, or sidewalk shall be placed on steel or prestressed concrete
 girder bridges until the bridge deck reaches a compressive strength of at least 3,000 psi.
 The Contractor may construct traffic and pedestrian barriers by the slipform method.
 However, the barrier may not deviate more than ¼ inch when measured by a 10-foot
 straightedge held longitudinally on the front face, back face, and top surface. Electrical
 conduit within the barrier shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements
 of Section 8-20.3(5).
 When placing concrete in arch rings, the Contractor shall ensure that the load on the
 falsework remains symmetrical and uniform.
 Unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer, arch ribs in open spandrel arches shall be placed
 in sections. Small key sections between large sections shall be filled after the large sections
 have shrunk.
 6-02.3(6)A  Weather and Temperature Limits to Protect Concrete
 6-02.3(6)A1  Hot Weather Protection
 The Contractor shall provide concrete within the specified temperature limits. Cooling of
 the coarse aggregate piles by sprinkling with water is permitted provided the moisture content
 is monitored and the mixing water is adjusted for the free water in the aggregate. Shading
 or cooling aggregate piles (sprinkling of fine aggregate piles with water is not allowed). If
 sprinkling of the coarse aggregates is to be used, the piles moisture content shall be monitored
 and the mixing water adjusted for the free water in the aggregate. In addition, when removing
 the coarse aggregate, it shall be removed from at least 1 foot above the bottom of the pile.
 Refrigerating mixing water; or replacing all or part of the mixing water with crushed ice,
 provided the ice is completely melted by placing time.
 If air temperature exceeds 90°F, the Contractor shall use water spray or other accepted
 methods to cool all concrete-contact surfaces to less than 90°F. These surfaces include forms,
 reinforcing steel, steel beam flanges, and any others that touch the mix.
 6-02.3(6)A2 Cold Weather Protection
 Concrete shall be maintained at or above a temperature of 40°F during the first seven
 days of the Cold Weather Protection Period and at or above a temperature of 35°F during the
 remainder of the Cold Weather Protection Period. Cold weather protection requirements do not
 apply to concrete in shafts and piles placed below the ground line.
 Prior to placing concrete in cold weather, the Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working
 Drawing with a written procedure for cold weather concreting. The procedure shall detail how
 the Contractor will adequately cure the concrete and prevent the concrete temperature from
 falling below the minimum temperature. Extra protection shall be provided for areas especially
 vulnerable to freezing (such as exposed top surfaces, corners and edges, thin sections, and
 concrete placed into steel forms). Concrete placement will only be allowed if the Contractor’s
 cold weather protection plan has been accepted by the Engineer.
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-17
 
 6-02
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 Prior to concrete placement, the Contractor shall review the 7-day temperature predictions
 for the job site from the Western Region Headquarters of the National Weather Service (www.
 wrh.noaa.gov). When temperatures below 35°F are predicted, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Install temperature sensors in each concrete placement. One sensor shall be installed for
 every 100 cubic yards of concrete placed. Sensors shall be installed at locations directed
 by the Engineer, and shall be placed 1.5 inches from the face of concrete.
 2.	 Immediately after concrete placement, temperature sensors shall be installed on the
 concrete surface at locations directed by the Engineer. One sensor shall be installed for
 every 100 cubic yards of concrete placed.
 Temperatures shall be measured and recorded a minimum of every hour for the duration
 of the Cold Weather Protection Period. Temperature data shall be submitted to the Engineer
 as a Type 1 Working Drawing within three days following the end of the Cold Weather
 Protection Period.
 For each day that the concrete temperature falls below 40°F during the first seven days
 of the Cold Weather Protection Period, no curing time is awarded for that day and the Cold
 Weather Protection Period is extended for one additional day. If the concrete temperature
 falls below 35°F during the Cold Weather Protection Period, the concrete may be rejected by
 the Engineer.
 6-02.3(6)B  Placing Concrete in Foundation Seals
 If the Plans require a concrete seal, the Contractor shall place the concrete underwater
 inside a watertight cofferdam, tube, or caisson. Seal concrete shall be placed in a compact
 mass in still water. It shall remain undisturbed and in still water until fully set. While seal
 concrete is being deposited, the water elevation inside and outside the cofferdam shall
 remain equal to prevent any flow through the seal in either direction. The cofferdam shall be
 vented at the vent elevation shown in the Plans. The thickness of the seal is based upon this
 vent elevation.
 The seal shall be at least 18 inches thick unless the Plans show otherwise. The Engineer
 may change the seal thickness during construction which may require redesign of the footing
 and the pier shaft or column. Although seal thickness changes may result in the use of more or
 less concrete, reinforcing steel, and excavation, payment will remain as originally defined in
 unit Contract prices.
 To place seal concrete underwater, the Contractor shall use a concrete pump or tremie.
 The tremie shall have a hopper at the top that empties into a watertight tube at least 10 inches
 in diameter. The discharge end of the tube on the tremie or concrete pump shall include a
 device to seal out water while the tube is first filled with concrete. Tube supports shall permit
 the discharge end to move freely across the entire Work area and to drop rapidly to slow
 or stop the flow. One tremie may be used to concrete an area up to 18 feet per side. Each
 additional area of this size requires one additional tremie.
 Throughout the underwater concrete placement operation, the discharge end of the tube
 shall remain submerged in the concrete and the tube shall always contain enough concrete to
 prevent water from entering. The concrete placement shall be continuous until the Work is
 completed, resulting in a seamless, uniform seal. If the concreting operation is interrupted,
 the Engineer may require the Contractor to prove by core drilling or other tests that the seal
 contains no voids or horizontal joints. If testing reveals voids or joints, the Contractor shall
 repair them or replace the seal at no expense to the Contracting Agency.
 Concrete Class 4000W shall be used for seals, and it shall meet the consistency
 requirements of Section 6-02.3(4)C.
 6-02.3(6)C Dewatering Concrete Seals and Foundations
 After a concrete seal is constructed, the Contractor shall pump the water out of the
 cofferdam and place the rest of the concrete in the dry. This pumping shall not begin until the
 seal has set enough to withstand the hydrostatic pressure (3 days for gravity seals and 10 days
 Page 6-18
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02
 
 for seals containing piling or shafts). The Engineer may extend these waiting periods to ensure
 structural safety or to meet a condition of the operating permit.
 If weighted cribs are used to resist hydrostatic pressure at the bottom of the seal, the
 Contractor shall anchor them to the foundation seal. Any method used (such as dowels or
 keys) shall transfer the entire weight of the crib to the seal.
 No pumping shall be done during or for 24 hours after concrete placement unless done
 from a suitable sump separated from the concrete Work by a watertight wall. Pumping shall
 be done in a way that rules out any chance of concrete being carried away.
 6-02.3(6)D  Protection Against Vibration
 Freshly placed concrete shall not be subjected to excessive vibration and shock waves
 during the curing period until it has reached a 2,000 psi minimum compressive strength for
 structural concrete and lower-strength classes of concrete.
 After the first 5 hours from the time the concrete has been placed and consolidated, the
 Contractor shall keep all vibration producing operations at a safe horizontal distance from
 the freshly placed concrete by following either the prescriptive safe distance method or the
 monitoring safe distance method. These requirements for the protection of freshly placed
 concrete against vibration shall not apply for plant cast concrete, nor shall they apply to the
 vibrations caused by the traveling public.
 6-02.3(6)D1  Prescriptive Safe Distance Method
 After the concrete has been placed and consolidated, the Contractor shall keep all vibration
 producing operations at a safe horizontal distance from the freshly placed concrete as follows:
 Minimum Compressive
 Strength, f’c
 < 1,000 psi
 1,000 to < 1,400 psi
 1,400 to 2,000 psi

 1The
 
 safe horizontal distance shall be reduced to 10 feet for small rubber tire construction equipment like backhoes under
 50,000 pounds, concrete placing equipment, and legal Highway vehicles if such equipment travels at speeds of:
   •  ≤ 5 mph on relatively smooth Roadway surfaces or
   •  ≤ 3 mph on rough Roadway surfaces (i.e., with potholes)
 2Equipment Class L (Low Vibration) shall include tracked dozers under 85,000 pounds, track vehicles, trucks (unless excluded
 above), hand-operated jack hammers, cranes, auger drill rig, caisson drilling, vibratory roller compactors under 30,000 pounds,
 and grab-hammers.
 3Equipment Class H (High Vibration) shall include pile drivers, vibratory hammers, machine-operated impact tools, pavement
 breakers, and other large pieces of equipment.
 
 After the concrete has reached a minimum compressive strength specified above, the safe
 horizontal distance restrictions would no longer apply.
 6-02.3(6)D2  Monitoring Safe Distance Method
 The Contractor may monitor the vibration producing operations in order to decrease the
 safe horizontal distance requirements of the prescriptive safe distance method. If this method
 is chosen, all construction operations that produce vibration or shock waves in the vicinity
 of freshly placed concrete shall be monitored by the Contractor with monitoring equipment
 sensitive enough to detect a minimum peak particle velocity (PPV) of 0.10 inches per second.
 Monitoring devices shall be placed on or adjacent to the freshly placed concrete when the
 measurements are taken. During the time subsequent to the concrete placement, the Contractor
 shall cease all vibration or shock producing operations in the vicinity of the newly placed
 concrete when the monitoring equipment detects excessive vibration and shock waves defined
 as exceeding the following PPVs:

 6-02.3(7) Vacant
 6-02.3(8) Vacant
 6-02.3(9) Vibration of Concrete
 The Contractor shall supply enough vibrators to consolidate the concrete (except that
 placed underwater) according to the requirements of this section. Each vibrator shall:
 1.	 Be designed to operate while submerged in the concrete,
 2.	 Vibrate at a rate of at least 7,000 pulses per minute, and
 3.	 Receive the Engineer’s acceptance on its type and method of use.
 Immediately after concrete is placed, vibration shall be applied in the fresh batch at the
 point of deposit. In doing so, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Space the vibrators evenly, no farther apart than twice the radius of the visible effects
 of the vibration;
 2.	 Ensure that vibration intensity is great enough to visibly affect a weight of 1-inch
 slump concrete across a radius of at least 18 inches;
 3.	 Insert the vibrators slowly to a depth that will effectively vibrate the full depth of each
 layer, penetrating into the previous layer on multilayer pours;
 4.	 Protect partially hardened concrete (i.e., nonplastic, which prevents vibrator penetration
 when only its own weight is applied) by preventing the vibrator from penetrating it or
 making direct contact with steel that extends into it;
 5.	 Not allow vibration to continue in one place long enough to form pools of grout;
 6.	 Continue vibration long enough to consolidate the concrete thoroughly, but not so long
 as to segregate it;
 7.	 Withdraw the vibrators slowly when the process is complete; and
 8.	 Not use vibrators to move concrete from one point to another in the forms.
 When vibrating and finishing top surfaces that will be exposed to weather or wear, the
 Contractor shall not draw water or laitance to the surface. In high lifts, the top layer shall be
 shallow and made up of a concrete mix as stiff as can be effectively vibrated and finished.
 To produce a smooth, dense finish on outside surfaces, the Contractor shall hand tamp
 the concrete.
 Vibration of SCC shall only be used as described below or as approved by the Engineer:
 1.	 To prevent the formation of a cold joint in between placement of successive batches
 of SCC.
 2.	 Near the end of an SCC placement to aid in leveling the SCC in the forms.
 When vibration of SCC is allowed, the magnitude and duration of the applied vibration
 shall be kept as minimal as possible.
 6-02.3(10)  Bridge Decks and Bridge Approach Slabs
 6-02.3(10)A  Pre-Deck Pour Meeting
 A pre-deck pour meeting shall be held 5 to 10 working days before placing deck concrete
 to discuss construction procedures, personnel, equipment to be used, concrete sampling and
 testing and deck finishing and curing operations. Those attending shall include, at a minimum,
 Page 6-20
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02
 
 the superintendent, foremen in charge of placing and finishing concrete, and representatives
 from the concrete supplier and the concrete pump truck supplier.
 If the project includes more than one bridge deck, and if the Contractor’s key personnel
 change between concreting operations, or at request of the Engineer, additional conferences
 shall be held before each deck placement.
 6-02.3(10)B  Screed Rail Supports
 The Contractor shall place screed rails outside the finishing area. When screed rails
 cannot be placed outside the finishing area as determined by the Engineer, they shall rest
 on adjustable supports that can be removed with the least possible disturbance to the
 screeded concrete. The supports shall rest on structural members or on forms rigid enough
 to resist deflection. Supports shall be removable to at least 2 inches below the finished
 surface. For staged constructed bridge decks, the finishing machine screed rails shall not be
 supported on the completed portion of deck and shall deflect with the portion of structure
 under construction.
 Screed rails (with their supports) shall be strong enough and stiff enough to permit the
 finishing machine to operate effectively on them. All screed rails shall be placed and secured
 for the full length of the deck/slab before the concreting begins. If the Engineer concurs in
 advance, the Contractor may move rails ahead onto previously set supports while concreting
 progresses. However, such movable rails and their supports shall not change the set elevation
 of the screed.
 On steel truss and girder spans, screed rails and bulkheads may be placed directly
 on transverse steel floorbeams, with the strike-board moving at right angles to the centerline
 of the Roadway.
 6-02.3(10)C  Finishing Equipment
 The finishing machine shall be self-propelled and be capable of forward and reverse
 movement under positive control. The finishing machine shall be equipped with a rotating
 cylindrical single or double drum screed not exceeding 60 inches in length. The finishing
 machine shall have the necessary adjustments to produce the required cross section, line, and
 grade. Provisions shall be made for the raising and lowering of all screeds under positive
 control. The upper vertical limit of screed travel shall permit the screed to clear the finished
 concrete surface.
 For bridge deck widening of 20 feet or less, and for bridge approach slabs, or where jobsite
 conditions do not allow the use of the conventional configuration finishing machines described
 above, the Contractor may submit a Type 2 Working Drawing proposing the use of a handoperated motorized power screed such as a “Texas” or “Bunyan” screed. This screed shall be
 capable of finishing the bridge deck and bridge approach slab to the same standards as the
 finishing machine.
 On bridge decks, the Contractor may use hand-operated strike-boards only when the
 Engineer concurs for special conditions where self-propelled or motorized hand-operated
 screeds cannot be employed. These boards shall be sturdy and able to strike off the full
 placement width without intermediate supports. Strike-boards, screed rails, and any specially
 made auxiliary equipment shall receive the Engineer’s concurrence before use. All finishing
 requirements in these Specifications apply to hand-operated finishing equipment.
 6-02.3(10)D  Concrete Placement, Finishing, and Texturing
 6-02.3(10)D1  Test Slab Using Bridge Deck Concrete
 After the Contractor receives the Engineer’s acceptance of the Class 4000D concrete mix
 design, and a minimum of seven calendar days prior to the first placement of bridge deck
 concrete, the Contractor shall construct a test slab using concrete of the accepted mix design.
 The test slab may be constructed on grade, shall have a minimum thickness of 8-inches,
 shall have minimum plan dimensions of 10-feet along all four edges, and shall be square
 or rectangular.
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-21
 
 6-02
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 During construction of the test slab, the Contractor shall demonstrate concrete sampling
 and testing, use of the concrete temperature monitoring system, the concrete fogging system,
 concrete placement system, and the concrete finishing operation. The Contractor shall
 conduct the demonstration using the same type of equipment to be used for the production
 bridge decks, except that the Contractor may elect to finish the test slab with a hand-operated
 strike-board.
 After the construction of the test slab and the demonstration of bridge deck construction
 operations is complete, the Contractor shall remove and dispose of the test slab in accordance
 with Sections 2-02.3 and 2-03.3(7)C.
 6-02.3(10)D2  Preparation for Concrete Placement
 Before placing bridge approach slab concrete, the subgrade shall be constructed in
 accordance with Sections 2-06 and 5-05.3(6).
 Before any concrete is placed, the finishing machine shall be operated over the entire
 length of the deck/slab to check screed deflection. Concrete placement may begin only if the
 Engineer accepts after this test.
 Immediately before placing concrete, the Contractor shall check (and adjust if necessary)
 all falsework and wedges to minimize settlement and deflection from the added mass of the
 concrete deck/slab. The Contractor shall also install devices, such as telltales, by which the
 Engineer can readily measure settlement and deflection.
 6-02.3(10)D3  Concrete Placement
 The placement operation shall cover the full width of the bridge deck or the full width
 between construction joints. The Contractor shall locate any construction joint over a beam or
 web that can support the deck/slab on either side of the joint. The joint shall not occur over a
 pier unless the Plans permit. Each joint shall be formed vertically and in true alignment. The
 Contractor shall not release falsework or wedges supporting bridge deck placement sections
 on either side of a joint until each side has aged as these Specifications require.
 Placement of concrete for bridge decks and bridge approach slabs shall comply with
 Section 6-02.3(6). In placing the concrete, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Place it (without segregation) against concrete placed earlier, as near as possible
 to its final position, approximately to grade, and in shallow, closely spaced piles;
 2.	 Consolidate it around reinforcing steel by using vibrators before strike-off by the
 finishing machine;
 3.	 Not use vibrators to move concrete;
 4.	 Not revibrate any concrete surface areas where workers have stopped prior to screeding;
 5.	 Remove any concrete splashed onto reinforcing steel in adjacent segments before
 concreting them;
 6.	 Maintain a slight excess of concrete in front of the screed across the entire width of the
 placement operation;
 7.	 Operate the finishing machine to create a surface that is true and ready for final finish
 without overfinishing or bringing excessive amounts of mortar to the surface; and
 8.	 Leave a thin, even film of mortar on the concrete surface after the last pass of the
 finishing machine pan.
 Workers shall complete all post screeding operations without walking on the concrete.
 This may require work bridges spanning the full width of the deck/slab.
 After removing the screed supports, the Contractor shall fill the voids with concrete
 (not mortar).
 If the surface left by the finishing machine is porous, rough, or has minor irregularities,
 the Contractor shall float the surface of the concrete. Floating shall leave a smooth and even
 surface. Float finishing shall be kept to the minimum number of passes necessary to seal the
 surface. The floats shall be at least 4-feet long. Each transverse pass of the float shall overlap
 Page 6-22
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02
 
 the previous pass by at least half the length of the float. The first floating shall be at right
 angles to the strike-off. The second floating shall be at right angles to the centerline of the
 span. A smooth riding surface shall be maintained across construction joints.
 The edge of completed roadway slabs at expansion joints and compression seals shall have
 a ⅜-inch radius.
 After floating, but while the concrete remains plastic, the Contractor shall test the entire
 deck/slab for flatness (allowing for crown, camber, and vertical curvature). The testing shall
 be done with a 10-foot straightedge held on the surface. The straightedge shall be advanced
 in successive positions parallel to the centerline, moving not more than one half the length of
 the straightedge each time it advances. This procedure shall be repeated with the straightedge
 held perpendicular to the centerline. An acceptable surface shall be one free from deviations of
 more than ⅛-inch under the 10-foot straightedge.
 If the test reveals depressions, the Contractor shall fill them with freshly mixed concrete,
 strike off, consolidate, and refinish them. High areas shall be cut down and refinished.
 Retesting and refinishing shall continue until a surface conforming to the requirements
 specified above is produced.
 6-02.3(10)D4  Monitoring Bridge Deck Concrete Temperature After Placement
 The Contractor shall measure and record the concrete temperature and ambient temperature
 a minimum of every hour for seven calendar days after concrete placement. The Contractor
 shall place two temperature sensors in the bridge deck at locations specified by the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall measure ambient temperature near the locations where concrete
 temperature is being measured. When the bridge deck is being enclosed and heated to meet
 cold weather requirements, ambient temperature readings shall be taken within the enclosure.
 The Contractor shall submit the concrete temperature and ambient temperature data as a
 Type 1 Working Drawing in spreadsheet format within 14 calendar days from placing the
 bridge deck concrete.
 The Contractor shall submit a Type 1 Working Drawing consisting of the type and model of
 each device and the method used to measure and record the temperatures.
 6-02.3(10)D5  Bridge Deck Concrete Finishing and Texturing
 Except as otherwise specified for portions of bridge decks receiving an overlay or sidewalk
 under the same Contract, the Contractor shall texture the surface of the bridge deck as follows:
 	 The Contractor shall texture the bridge deck using diamond tipped saw blades mounted
 on a power driven, self-propelled machine that is designed to texture concrete surfaces.
 The grooving equipment shall provide grooves that are ⅛" ± 1/64" wide, 3/16" ± 1/16" deep,
 and spaced at ¾" ± ⅛". The bridge deck shall not be textured with a metal tined comb.
 	 The Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working Drawing consisting of the type
 of grooving equipment to be used. The Contractor shall demonstrate that the method
 and equipment for texturing the bridge deck will not chip, spall or otherwise damage
 the deck.
 	 Unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer, the Contractor shall texture the concrete
 bridge deck surface either in a longitudinal direction, parallel with centerline or in a
 transverse direction, perpendicular with centerline. The Contractor shall texture the
 bridge deck surface to within 3-inches minimum and 15-inches maximum of the edge
 of concrete at expansion joints, within 1-foot minimum and 2-feet maximum of the curb
 line, and within 3-inches minimum and 9-inches maximum of the perimeter of bridge
 drain assemblies.
 	 The Contractor shall contain and collect all concrete dust and debris generated by the
 bridge deck texturing process, and shall dispose of the collected concrete dust and
 debris in accordance with Section 2-03.3(7)C.
 If the Plans call for placement of a sidewalk or an HMA or concrete overlay on the bridge
 deck, the Contractor shall produce the final finish of these areas by dragging a strip of damp,
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-23
 
 6-02
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 seamless burlap lengthwise over the bridge deck or by brooming it lightly. Approximately
 3-feet of the drag shall contact the surface, with the least possible bow in its leading edge.
 It shall be kept wet and free of hardened lumps of concrete. When the burlap drag fails to
 produce the required finish, the Contractor shall replace it. When not in use, it shall be lifted
 clear of the bridge deck.
 After the bridge deck has cured, the surface shall conform to the surface smoothness
 requirements specified in Section 6-02.3(10)D3.
 The surface texture on any area repaired to address out-of-tolerance surface smoothness
 shall match closely that of the surrounding bridge deck area at the completion of the repair.
 Methods used to remove high spots shall cut through the mortar and aggregate without
 breaking or dislodging the aggregate or causing spalls.
 6-02.3(10)D6  Bridge Approach Slab Finishing and Texturing
 Bridge approach slabs that are being built as part of a bridge construction project shall
 be textured in accordance with Section 6-02.3(10)D5. All other bridge approach slabs shall
 be textured using metal tined combs in the transverse direction, except bridge approach
 slabs receiving an overlay in the same Contract shall be finished as specified in Section
 6-02.3(10)D5 only.
 The comb shall be made of a single row of metal tines. It shall leave striations in the fresh
 concrete approximately 3/16-inch deep by ⅛-inch wide and spaced approximately ½-inch
 apart. The Engineer will decide actual depths at the site. If the comb has not been accepted,
 the Contractor shall obtain the Engineer’s acceptance by demonstrating it on a test section.
 The Contractor may operate the combs manually or mechanically, either singly or with several
 placed end to end. The timing and method used shall produce the required texture without
 displacing larger particles of aggregate.
 Texturing shall end 2-feet from curb lines. This 2-foot untextured strip shall be hand
 finished with a steel trowel.
 Surface smoothness, high spots, and low spots shall be addressed as specified in Section
 6-02.3(10)D5. The surface texture on any area cut down or built up shall match closely that
 of the surrounding bridge approach slab area. The entire bridge approach slab shall provide
 a smooth riding surface.
 6-02.3(10)E Sidewalk
 Concrete for sidewalk shall be well compacted, struck off with a strike-board, and floated
 with a wooden float to achieve a surface that does not vary more than ⅛ inch under a 10-foot
 straightedge. An edging tool shall be used to finish all sidewalk edges and expansion joints.
 The final surface shall have a granular texture that will not turn slick when wet.
 6-02.3(10)F  Bridge Approach Slab Orientation and Anchors
 Bridge approach slabs shall be constructed full bridge deck width from outside usable
 Shoulder to outside usable Shoulder at an elevation to match the Structure. Unless otherwise
 shown in the Plans, the pavement end of the bridge approach slab shall be constructed normal
 to the Roadway centerline. The bridge approach slabs shall be modified as shown in the Plans
 to accommodate the grate inlets at the bridge ends if the grate inlets are required.
 Bridge approach slab anchors shall be installed as detailed in the Plans, and the anchor
 rods, couplers, and nuts shall conform to Section 9-06.5(1). The steel plates shall conform
 to ASTM A36. All metal parts of the approach expansion anchor shall receive one coat
 of paint conforming to Section 9-08.1(2)F or be galvanized in accordance with AASHTO
 M232. The pipe shall be any nonperforated PE or PVC pipe of the diameter specified in
 the Plans. Polystyrene shall conform to Section 9-04.6. The anchors shall be installed parallel
 both to profile grade and centerline of Roadway. The Contractor shall secure the anchors to
 ensure that they will not be misaligned during concrete placement. For Method B anchor
 installations, the epoxy bonding agent used to install the anchors shall be Type IV conforming
 to Section 9-26.1. The compression seal shall be as noted in the Contract documents. Dowel

 bars shall be installed in the bridge approach slabs in accordance with the requirements of the
 Standard Plans and Section 5-05.3(10).
 The compression seal shall be a 2½ inch wide gland selected from the current Qualified
 Products List.
 After curing bridge approach slabs in accordance with Section 6-02.3(11), the
 bridge approach slabs may be opened to traffic when a minimum compressive strength
 of 2,500 psi is achieved.
 6-02.3(11) Curing Concrete
 After placement, concrete surfaces shall be cured as follows:
 1.	 Bridge sidewalks, roofs of cut and cover tunnels – curing compound covered by white,
 reflective type sheeting or continuous wet curing. Curing by either method shall be for
 at least 10 days.
 2.	 Bridge decks — See Section 6-02.3(11)B.
 3.	 Bridge approach slabs (Class 4000A concrete) – Two coats of curing compound and
 continuous wet cure for at least 10 days.
 4.	 Concrete barriers and rail bases – See Section 6-02.3(11)A.
 5.	 All other concrete surfaces – Continuous wet cure for at least 3 days.
 During the continuous wet cure, the Contractor shall keep all exposed concrete surfaces
 saturated with water. Formed concrete surfaces shall be kept in a continuous wet cure by
 leaving the forms in place. If forms are removed during the continuous wet cure period, the
 Contractor shall treat the concrete as an exposed concrete surface. Runoff water shall be
 collected and disposed of in accordance with all applicable regulations. In no case shall runoff
 water be allowed to enter any lakes, streams, or other surface waters.
 When curing Class 4000A, two coats of curing compound that complies with Section
 9-23.2 shall be applied immediately (not to exceed 15 min.) after tining any portion of the
 bridge approach slab. The continuous wet cure shall be established as soon as the concrete has
 set enough to allow covering without damaging the finish.
 For all other concrete requiring curing compound, the Contractor shall apply two coats
 (that complies with Section 9-23.2) to the fresh concrete. The compound shall be applied
 immediately after finishing. Application of the second coat shall run at right angles to that
 of the first. The two coats shall total at least 1 gallon per 150 square feet and shall obscure
 the original color of the concrete. If any curing compound spills on construction joints or
 reinforcing steel, the Contractor shall clean it off before the next concrete placement.
 If the Plans call for an asphalt overlay on the bridge approach slab, the Contractor shall use
 the clear curing compound (Type 1, Class B), applying at least 1 gallon per 150 square feet to
 the concrete surface. Otherwise, the Contractor shall use white pigmented curing compound
 (Type 2), agitating it thoroughly just before and during application. If other materials are to
 be bonded to the surface, the Contractor shall remove the curing compound by sandblasting
 or acceptable high pressure water washing.
 The Contractor shall have on the site, back-up spray equipment, enough workers, and
 a bridge from which they will apply the curing compound. The Engineer may require the
 Contractor to demonstrate (at least 1 day before the scheduled concrete placement) that the
 crew and equipment can apply the compound acceptably.
 The Contractor shall cover the top surfaces with white, reflective sheeting, leaving it in
 place for at least 10 days. Throughout this period, the sheeting shall be kept in place by taping
 or weighting the edges where they overlap.
 6-02.3(11)A  Curing and Finishing Concrete Traffic and Pedestrian Barrier
 The Contractor shall supply enough water and workers to cure and finish concrete barrier
 as required in this section. Unit contract prices shall cover all curing and finishing costs.

 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02.3(11)A1  Fixed-Form Barrier
 The edge chamfers shall be formed by attaching chamfer strips to the barrier forms.
 After troweling and edging a barrier (while the forms remain in place), the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Brush the top surface with a fine bristle brush;
 2.	 Cover the top surface with heavy, quilted blankets; and
 3.	 Spray water on the blankets and forms at intervals short enough to keep them
 thoroughly wet for 3 days.
 After removing the forms, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Remove all lips and edgings with sharp tools or chisels;
 2.	 Fill all holes with mortar conforming to Section 9-20.4(2);
 3.	 True up corners of openings;
 4.	 Remove concrete projecting beyond the true surface by stoning or grinding;
 5.	 Cover the barrier with heavy, quilted blankets (not burlap);
 6.	 Keep the blankets continuously wet for at least 7 days.
 The Contractor may do the finishing Work described in steps 1 through 4 above during
 the second (the 7-day) curing period if the entire barrier is kept covered except the immediate
 Work area. Otherwise, no finishing Work may be done until at least 10 days after pouring.
 After the 10-day curing period, the Contractor shall remove from the barrier all formrelease agent, mud, dust, and other foreign substances in either of two ways: (1) by light
 sandblasting and washing with water, or (2) by spraying with a high-pressure water jet.
 The water jet equipment shall use clean fresh water and shall produce (at the nozzle) at least
 1,500 psi with a discharge of at least 3 gpm. The water jet nozzle shall have a 25-degree tip
 and shall be held no more than 9 inches from the surface being washed.
 After cleaning, the Contractor shall use brushes to rub mortar conforming to
 Section 9-20.4(2) at a ratio of 1:1 cement/aggregate ratio into air holes and small crevices on
 all surfaces except the brushed top. As soon as the mortar takes its initial set, the Contractor
 shall rub it off with a piece of sacking or carpet. The barrier shall then be covered with wet
 blankets for at least 48 hours.
 No curing compound shall be used on fixed-form concrete barrier. The completed surface
 of the concrete shall be even in color and texture.
 6-02.3(11)A2  Slip-Form Barrier
 The edge radius shall be formed by attaching radius strips to the barrier slip form.
 The Contractor shall finish slip-form barrier by: (1) steel troweling to close all surface
 pockmarks and holes; and (2) for plain surface barrier, lightly brushing the front and back face
 with vertical strokes and the top surface with transverse strokes.
 After finishing, the Contractor shall cure the slip-form barrier by using either Method A
 (curing compound) or B (wet blankets) described below.
 Method A – Under the curing compound method, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Spray two coats of clear curing compound (Type 1) on the concrete surface after the
 free water has disappeared. (Coverage of combined coats shall equal at least 1 gallon
 per 150 square feet.)
 2.	 No later than the morning after applying the curing compound, cover the barrier with
 white, reflective sheeting for at least 10 days.
 3.	 After the 10-day curing period, remove the curing compound as necessary by light
 sandblasting or by spraying with a high-pressure water jet to produce an even surface
 appearance. The water jet equipment shall use clean fresh water and shall produce
 (at the nozzle) at least 2,500 psi with a discharge of at least 4 gpm. The water jet
 nozzle shall have a 25-degree tip and shall be held no more than 9 inches from the
 surface being cleaned. The Contractor may propose to use a curing compound/concrete

 sealer. The Engineer will evaluate the proposal and if found acceptable, will accept the
 proposal in writing. As a minimum, the Contractor’s proposal shall include:
 Product identity
 Manufacturer’s recommended application rate
 Method of application and necessary equipment
 Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)
 Sample of the material for testing
 	 Allow 14 working days for evaluating the proposal and testing the material.
 Method B – Under the wet cure method, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Provide an initial cure period by continuous fogging or mist spraying for at least the
 first 24 hours.
 2.	 After the initial cure period, cover the barrier with a heavy quilted blanket.
 3.	 Keep the blankets continuously wet for at least 10 days. (No additional finishing is
 required at the end of the curing period.)
 6-02.3(11)B  Curing Bridge Deck
 6-02.3(11)B1 Equipment
 The Contractor shall maintain a wet sheen, without developing pooling or sheeting water,
 using a fogging apparatus consisting of pressure washers with a minimum nozzle output of

 The Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working Drawing consisting of the bridge
 deck curing plan a minimum 14 calendar days prior to the pre-concreting conference.
 The Contractor’s plan shall describe the sequence and timing that will be used to fog the
 bridge deck, apply pre-soaked burlap, install soaker hoses and cover the deck with white
 reflective sheeting.
 6-02.3(11)B2 Curing
 The fogging apparatus shall be in place and charged for fogging prior to beginning concrete
 placement for the bridge deck.
 The Contractor shall presoak all burlap to be used to cover the deck during curing.
 Immediately after the finishing machine passes over finished concrete, the Contractor shall
 implement the following tasks:
 1.	 The Contractor shall fog the bridge deck while maintaining a wet sheen without
 developing pooling or sheeting water.
 2.	 The Contractor shall apply the presoaked burlap to the top surface to fully cover the
 deck without damaging the finish, other than minor marring of the concrete surface.
 The Contractor shall not apply curing compound.
 3.	 The Contractor shall continue to keep the burlap wet by fog spraying until the burlap
 is covered by soaker hoses and white reflective sheeting. The Contractor shall place
 the soaker hoses and white reflective sheeting after the concrete has achieved initial
 set. The Contractor shall charge the soaker hoses frequently so as to keep the burlap
 covering the entire deck wet during the course of curing.
 As an alternative to tasks 2 and 3 above, the Contractor may propose a curing system
 using proprietary curing blankets specifically manufactured for bridge deck curing.
 The Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working Drawing consisting of details of the proprietary
 curing blanket system, including product literature and details of how the system is to be
 installed and maintained.
 The wet curing regime as described shall remain in place for at least 14 consecutive

 6-02.3(12)  Construction Joints
 6-02.3(12)A  Construction Joints in New Construction
 If the Engineer allows, the Contractor may add, delete, or relocate construction joints
 shown in the Plans. Any request for such changes shall be in writing, accompanied by
 a drawing that depicts them. The Contractor will bear any added costs that result from
 such changes.
 All construction joints shall be formed neatly with grade strips or other accepted methods.
 The Contracting Agency will not accept irregular or wavy pour lines. All joints shall be
 horizontal, vertical, or perpendicular to the main reinforcement. The Contractor shall not use
 an edger on any construction joint, and shall remove any lip or edging before making the
 adjacent pour.
 If the Plans require a roughened surface on the joint, the Contractor shall strike it off to
 leave grooves at right angles to the length of the member. Grooves shall be installed using one
 of the following options:
 1.	 Grooves shall be ½ to 1 inch wide, ¼ to ½ inch deep, and spaced equally at twice the
 width of the groove. Grooves shall terminate approximately 1½-inches from the face
 of concrete.
 2.	 Grooves shall be 1 to 2 inches wide, a minimum of ½-inch deep, and spaced
 a maximum of three times the width of the groove. Grooves shall terminate
 approximately 1½-inches from the face of concrete.
 If the Engineer allows, the Contractor may use an alternate method to produce a roughened
 surface on the joint, provided that such an alternate method leaves a roughened surface of
 at least a ¼-inch amplitude.
 If the first strike-off does not produce the required roughness, the Contractor shall repeat
 the process before the concrete reaches initial set. The final surface shall be clean and without
 laitance or loose material.
 If the Plans do not require a roughened surface, the Contractor shall include shear keys at
 all construction joints. These keys shall provide a positive, mechanical bond. Shear keys shall
 be formed depressions and the forms shall not be removed until the concrete has been in place
 at least 12 hours. Forms shall be slightly beveled to ensure ready removal. Raised shear keys
 are not allowed.
 Shear keys for the tops of beams, at tops and bottoms of boxed girder webs, in diaphragms,
 and in crossbeams shall:
 1.	 Be formed with 2 by 8-inch wood blocks;
 2.	 Measure 8 inches lengthwise along the beam or girder stem;
 3.	 Measure 4 inches less than the width of the stem, beam, crossbeam, etc.
 (measured transverse of the stem); and
 4.	 Be spaced at 16 inches center to center.
 Unless the Plans show otherwise, in other locations (not named above), shear keys shall
 equal approximately ⅓ of the joint area and shall be approximately 1½ inches deep.
 Before placing fresh concrete against cured concrete, the Contractor shall thoroughly clean
 and saturate the cured surface. All loose particles, dust, dirt, laitance, oil, or film of any sort
 shall be removed by method(s) as accepted by the Engineer. The cleaned surface shall be
 saturated with water for a minimum of four hours before the fresh concrete is placed.
 Before placing the reinforcing mat for footings on seals, the Contractor shall: (1) remove
 all scum, laitance, and loose gravel and sediment; (2) clean the construction joint at the top
 of the seals; and (3) chip off any high spots on the seals that would prevent the footing steel
 from being placed in the position required by the Plans.

 6-02.3(12)B  Construction Joints Between Existing and New Construction
 If the Plans or Special Provisions require a roughened surface on the joint, the Contractor
 shall thoroughly roughen the existing surface to a uniformly distributed ¼-inch minimum
 amplitude surface profile, with peaks spaced at a maximum of 1 inch.
 If the Plans or Special Provisions do not require a roughened surface on the joint, the
 Contractor shall remove all loose particles, dust, dirt, laitance, oil, or film of any sort.
 Before placing fresh concrete against existing concrete, the Contractor shall thoroughly
 clean and saturate the existing surface. All loose particles, dust, dirt, laitance, oil, or film of
 any sort shall be removed. The cleaned surface shall be saturated with water for a minimum
 of 4 hours before the fresh concrete is placed.
 6-02.3(13) Expansion Joints

 If the gland is installed in the field, the Contractor shall have the services of a strip seal
 expansion joint system manufacturer’s technical representative physically present at the
 job site. The manufacturer’s technical representative shall train the Contractor’s personnel
 performing the field installation of the gland, provide technical assistance for installing the
 gland, and observe and inspect the installation of at least the first complete joint.
 The strip seal gland shall be continuous for the full length of the joint with no splices
 permitted, unless otherwise shown in the Plans.
 Other than items shown in the Plans, threaded studs used for construction adjustments are
 the only items that may be welded to the steel shapes provided they are removed by grinding
 after use, and the area repaired by application of an accepted corrosion protection system.
 After the joint system is installed, the joint shall be flooded with water and inspected, from
 below the joint, for leakage. If leakage is observed, the joint system shall be repaired by the
 Contractor, as recommended by the manufacturer.

 Compression seal glands shall be selected from the current Qualified Products List and
 sized as shown in the Plans.
 The compression seal expansion joint system shall be installed in accordance with the
 manufacturer’s written recommendations. The Contractor shall submit a Type 1 Working
 Drawing consisting of the manufacturer’s written installation procedure and repair procedures
 if leakage testing fails.
 After the joint system is installed, the joint area shall be flooded with water and inspected,
 from below the joint, for leakage. If leakage is observed, the joint system shall be repaired by
 the Contractor, as recommended by the manufacturer.
 6-02.3(14) Finishing Concrete Surfaces
 All concrete shall show a smooth, dense, uniform surface after the forms are removed.
 If it is porous, the Contractor shall bear the cost of repairing it. The Contractor shall clean and
 refinish any stained or discolored surfaces.
 Subsections A and B (below) describe two classes of surface finishing.
 6-02.3(14)A  Class 1 Surface Finish
 The Contractor shall apply a Class 1 finish to all surfaces of concrete members to the limits
 designated in the Contract Plans.
 The Contractor shall follow steps 1 through 8 below. When steel forms have been used
 and when the surface of filled holes matches the texture and color of the area around them,
 the Contractor may omit steps 3 through 8. To create a Class 1 surface, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Remove all bolts and all lips and edgings where form members have met;
 2.	 Fill all holes greater than ¼ inch and float to an even, uniform finish with mortar
 conforming to Section 9-20.4(2) at a 1:2 cement/aggregate ratio;
 3.	 Thoroughly wash the surface of the concrete with water;
 4.	 Brush on a mortar conforming to Section 9-20.4(2) at a 1:1 cement/aggregate ratio,
 working it well into the small air holes and other crevices in the face of the concrete;
 5.	 Brush on no more mortar than can be finished in 1 day;
 6.	 Rub the mortar off with burlap or a piece of carpet as soon as it takes initial set (before
 it reaches final set);
 7.	 Fog-spray water over the finish as soon as the mortar paint has reached final set; and
 8.	 Keep the surface damp for at least 2 days.
 If the mortar becomes too hard to rub off as described in step 6, the Contractor shall
 remove it with a Carborundum stone and water. Random grinding is not permitted.

 6-02
 
 6-02.3(14)B  Class 2 Surface Finish
 The Contractor shall apply a Class 2 finish to all above-ground surfaces not receiving a
 Class 1 finish as specified above unless otherwise indicated in the Contract. Surfaces covered
 with fill do not require a surface finish.
 To produce a Class 2 finish, the Contractor shall remove all bolts and all lips and edgings
 where form members have met and fill all form tie holes.
 6-02.3(14)C  Pigmented Sealer for Concrete Surfaces
 The Contractor shall submit a Type 1 Working Drawing consisting of the pigmented sealer
 manufacturer’s written instructions covering, at a minimum, the following:
 1.	 Surface preparation.
 2.	 Application methods.
 3.	 Requirements for concrete curing prior to sealer application.
 4.	 Temperature, humidity and precipitation limitations for application.
 5.	 Rate of application and number of coats to apply.
 All surfaces specified in the Plans to receive pigmented sealer shall receive a Class 2
 surface finish (except that concrete barrier surfaces shall be finished in accordance with
 Section 6-02.3(11)A). The Contractor shall not apply pigmented sealer from a batch greater
 than 12 months past the initial date of color sample acceptance of that batch by the Engineer.
 The pigmented sealer color or colors for specific concrete surfaces shall be as specified in
 the Special Provisions.
 The final appearance shall be even and uniform without blotchiness, streaking or uneven
 color. Surface finishes deemed unacceptable by the Engineer shall be re-coated in accordance
 with the manufacturer’s recommendations at no additional expense to the Contracting Agency.

 fascia panels, and noise barrier wall panels, the pigmented sealer shall extend to 1 foot below
 the finish ground line, unless otherwise shown in the Plans.
 6-02.3(14)D  General Requirements for Concrete Surface Finishes Produced by
 Form Liners
 Horizontal and vertical joints shall be spliced in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 printed instructions. The Contractor shall submit a Type 1 Working Drawing consisting of the
 manufacturer’s joint splice instructions.
 Horizontal splicing of ABS and plastic form liners to achieve the required height is not
 permitted and there shall be no horizontal joints. The concrete formed with ABS and plastic
 form liners shall be given a light sandblast to remove the glossy finish.
 Once the forms are removed, the Contractor shall treat the joint areas by patching or light
 sandblasting as required by the Engineer to ensure that the joints are not visible.
 Form liners shall be cleaned, reconditioned, and repaired before each use. Form liners
 with repairs, patches, or defects which, in the opinion of the Engineer, would result in
 adverse effects to the concrete finish shall not be used.
 Care shall be taken to ensure uniformity of color throughout the textured surface.
 A change in form release agent will not be allowed.
 All surfaces formed by the form liner shall also receive a Class 2 surface finish. Form ties
 shall be a type that leaves a clean hole when removed. All spalls and form tie holes shall be
 filled as specified for a Class 2 surface finish.
 6-02.3(15) Date Numerals
 Standard date numerals shall be placed where shown in the Plans. The date shall be for
 the year in which the Structure is completed. When an existing Structure is widened or

 6-02.3(16) Plans for Falsework and Formwork
 The Contractor shall submit all plans for falsework and formwork as Type 2E Working
 Drawings. A submittal is not required for footing or retaining wall formwork if the concrete
 placement is 4 feet or less in height.
 The design of falsework and formwork shall be based on:
 1.	 Applied loads and conditions which are no less severe than those described
 in Section 6-02.3(17)A;
 2.	 Allowable stresses and deflections which are no greater than those described
 in Section 6-02.3(17)B;
 3.	 Special loads and requirements no less severe than those described
 in Section 6-02.3(17)C;
 4.	 Conditions required by other Sections of 6-02.3(17).
 The falsework and formwork plans shall be scale drawings showing the details of
 proposed construction, including: sizes and properties of all members and components;
 spacing of bents, posts, studs, wales, stringers, wedges and bracing; rates of concrete
 placement, placement sequence, direction of placement, and location of construction joints;
 identification of falsework devices and safe working loads as well as identification of any
 bolts or threaded rods used with the devices including their diameter, length, type, grade, and
 required torque. The falsework plans shall show the proximity of falsework to utilities or any
 nearby Structures including underground Structures. Formwork accessories shall be identified
 according to Section 6-02.3(17)H. All assumptions, dimensions, material properties, and other
 data used in making the structural analysis shall be noted on the drawing.
 The Contractor shall furnish associated design calculations to the Engineer as part of the
 submittal. The design calculations shall include the structural and geotechnical design of the
 foundation and shall show the stresses and deflections in all load-carrying members that are
 part of the falsework system. Construction details which may be shown in the form of sketches
 on the calculation sheets shall be shown in the falsework or formwork drawings as well.
 Falsework or formwork plans will not be accepted in cases where it is necessary to refer to
 the calculation sheets for information needed for complete understanding of the falsework and
 formwork plans or how to construct the falsework and formwork.
 6-02.3(16)A Vacant
 6-02.3(16)B  Pre-Contract Review of Falsework and Formwork Plans
 The Contractor may request pre-contract review of formwork plans for abutments,
 wingwalls, diaphragms, retaining walls, columns, girders and beams, box culverts, railings,
 and bulkheads. Plans for falsework supporting the bridge deck for interior spans between
 precast prestressed concrete girders may also be submitted for pre-contract review.
 To obtain pre-contract review, the Contractor shall electronically submit drawings and
 design calculations in PDF format directly to: BridgeConstructionSupport@wsdot.wa.gov
 The Bridge and Structures Office, Construction Support Engineer will return the falsework
 or formwork plan to the Contractor with review notes, an effective date of review, and any
 revisions needed prior to use.
 For each contract on which the pre-reviewed falsework or formwork plans will be used, the
 Contractor shall submit a copy to the Engineer. Construction shall not begin until the Engineer
 has given concurrence.
 If the falsework or formwork being constructed has any deviations to the preapproved
 falsework or formwork plan, the Contractor shall submit plan revisions for review and
 approval in accordance with Section 6-02.3(16).
 6-02.3(17) Falsework and Formwork
 Formwork and falsework are both structural systems. Formwork contains the lateral
 pressure exerted by concrete placed in the forms. Falsework supports the vertical and/
 Page 6-32
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02
 
 or the horizontal loads of the formwork, reinforcing steel, concrete, and live loads
 during construction.
 The Contractor shall set falsework, to produce in the finished Structure, the lines
 and grades indicated in the Contract Plans. The setting of falsework shall allow for
 shrinkage, settlement, falsework girder camber, and any structural camber the Plans or
 the Engineer require.
 Concrete forms shall be mortar tight, true to the dimensions, lines, and grades of the
 Structure. Curved surfaces shown in the Contract Plans shall be constructed as curved
 surfaces and not chorded, except as allowed in Section 6-02.3(17)J. Concrete formwork
 shall be of sufficient strength and stiffness to prevent overstress and excess deflection as
 defined in Section 6-02.3(17)B. The rate of depositing concrete in the forms shall not exceed
 the placement rate in the formwork plan Working Drawing. The interior form shape and
 dimensions shall also ensure that the finished concrete will conform with the Contract Plans.
 If the new Structure is near or part of an existing one, the Contractor shall not use the
 existing Structure to suspend or support falsework unless the Plans or Special Provisions
 state otherwise. For prestressed girder and T-beam bridge widenings or stage construction,
 the bridge deck and the diaphragm forms may be supported from the existing Structure or
 previous stage, if accepted by the Engineer. For steel plate girder bridge widenings or stage
 construction, only the bridge deck forms may be supported from the existing Structure or
 previous stage, if accepted by the Engineer. See Section 6-02.3(17)E for additional conditions.
 On bridge decks, forms designed to stay in place made of steel or precast concrete panels
 shall not be used.
 For post-tensioned Structures, both falsework and forms shall be designed to carry the
 additional loads caused by the post-tensioning operations. The Contractor shall construct
 supporting falsework in a way that leaves the Superstructure free to contract and lift off the
 falsework during post-tensioning. Forms that will remain inside box girders to support the
 placement of the bridge deck concrete shall, by design, resist girder contraction as little as
 possible. See Section 6-02.3(26) for additional conditions.
 6-02.3(17)A  Design Loads
 The design load for falsework shall consist of the sum of dead and live vertical loads, and
 a design horizontal load. The minimum total design load for any falsework shall not be less
 than 100 lbs/sf for combined live and dead load regardless of Structure thickness.
 The entire Superstructure cross-section, except traffic barrier, shall be considered to be
 placed at one time for purposes of determining support requirements and designing falsework
 girders for their stresses and deflections, except as follows:
 For concrete box girder bridges, the girder stems, diaphragms, crossbeams, and
 connected bottom slabs, if the stem wall is placed more than 5 days prior to the top slab,
 may be considered to be self supporting between falsework bents at the time the top slab is
 placed, provided that the distance between falsework bents does not exceed four times the
 depth of the portion of the girder placed in the preceding concrete placements.
 Falsework bents shall be designed for the entire live load and dead load, including all load
 transfer that takes place during post-tensioning, and braced for the design horizontal load.
 Dead loads shall include the weight of all successive placements of concrete, reinforcing
 steel, forms and falsework, and all load transfer that takes place during post-tensioning. The
 weight of concrete with reinforcing steel shall be assumed to be not less than 160 pounds per
 cubic foot.
 Live loads shall consist of a minimum uniform load of not less than 25 psf, applied over
 the entire falsework plan area, plus the greater of:
 1.	 Actual weights of the deck finishing equipment applied at the rails, or;
 2.	 A minimum load of 75 pounds per linear foot applied at the edge of the bridge deck.
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-33
 
 6-02
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 The design horizontal load to be resisted by the falsework bracing system in any direction
 shall be:
 The sum of all identifiable horizontal loads due to equipment, construction sequence,
 side-sway caused by geometry or eccentric loading conditions, or other causes, and an
 allowance for wind plus an additional allowance of 1 percent of the total dead load to
 provide for unexpected forces. In no case shall the design horizontal load be less than
 3 percent of the total dead load.
 The minimum horizontal load to be allowed for wind on each heavy-duty steel shoring
 tower having a vertical load carrying capacity exceeding 30 kips per leg shall be the sum of
 the products of the wind impact area, shape factor, and the applicable wind pressure value for
 each height zone. The wind impact area is the total projected area of all the elements in the
 tower face normal to the applied wind. The shape factor for heavy-duty steel shoring towers
 shall be taken as 2.2. Wind pressure values shall be determined from the following table:
 Wind Pressure on Heavy-Duty Steel Shoring Towers
 Wind Pressure Value
 Height Zone (Feet Above Ground)
 Adjacent to Traffic
 At Other Locations
 0 to 30
 20 psf
 15 psf
 30 to 50
 25 psf
 20 psf
 50 to 100
 30 psf
 25 psf
 Over 100
 35 psf
 30 psf
 
 The minimum horizontal load to be allowed for wind on all other types of falsework,
 including falsework girders and forms supported on heavy-duty steel shoring towers, shall be
 the sum of the products of the wind impact area and the applicable wind pressure value for
 each height zone. The wind impact area is the gross projected area of the falsework support
 system, falsework girders, forms and any unrestrained portion of the permanent Structure,
 excluding the areas between falsework posts or towers where diagonal bracing is not used.
 Wind pressure values shall be determined from the following table:
 Wind Pressure on All Other Types of Falsework
 Wind Pressure Value
 For Members Over and Bents
 Height Zone (Feet Above Ground)
 Adjacent to Traffic Openings
 At Other Locations
 0 to 30

 2.0 Q psf
 50 to 100
 3.0 Q psf
 2.5 Q psf
 Over 100
 3.5 Q psf
 3.0 Q psf
 
 The value of Q in the above tabulation shall be determined as follows:
 Q = 1 + 0.2W; but Q shall not be more than 10.
 Where:
 W	
 =	 is the width of the falsework system, in feet, measured normal to the
 direction of the wind force being considered.
 The falsework system shall also be designed so that it will be sufficiently stable to resist
 overturning prior to the placement of the concrete. The minimum factor of safety against
 falsework overturning in all directions from the assumed horizontal load for all stages
 of construction shall be 1.25. If the required resisting moment is less than 1.25 times the
 overturning moment, the difference shall be resisted by bracing, cable guys, or other means
 of external support.
 Design of falsework shall include the vertical component (whether positive or negative)
 of bracing loads imposed by the design horizontal load. Design of falsework shall investigate
 Page 6-34
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02
 
 the effects of any horizontal displacement due to stretch of the bracing. This is particularly
 important when using cable or rod bracing systems.
 If the concrete is to be post-tensioned, the falsework shall be designed to support any
 increased or redistributed loads caused by the prestressing forces.
 6-02.3(17)B  Allowable Design Stresses and Deflections
 The maximum allowable stresses listed in this section are based on the use of identifiable,
 undamaged, high-quality materials. Stresses shall be appropriately reduced if lesser quality
 materials are to be used.
 These maximum allowable stresses include all adjustment factors, such as the short-term
 load duration factor. The maximum allowable stresses and deflections used in the design of
 the falsework and formwork shall be as follows:
 6-02.3(17)B1  Deflection
 Deflection resulting from dead load and concrete pressure for exposed visible surfaces,
 1⁄360 of the span.
 Deflection resulting from dead load and concrete pressure for unexposed non-visible
 surfaces, including the bottom of the deck slab between girders, 1⁄270 of the span.
 In the foregoing, the span length shall be the center line to center line distance between
 supports for simple and continuous spans, and from the center line of support to the end of the
 member for cantilever spans. For plywood supported on members wider than 1½ inches, the
 span length shall be taken as the clear span plus 1½ inches. Also, dead load shall include the
 weight of all successive placements of concrete, reinforcing steel, forms and falsework self
 weight. Only the self weight of falsework girders may be excluded from the calculation of
 the above deflections provided that the falsework girder deflection is compensated for by the
 installation of camber strips.
 Where successive placements of concrete are to act compositely in the completed
 Structure, deflection control becomes extremely critical. Maximum deflection of supporting
 members — 1⁄500 of the span for members constructed in several successive placements
 (such as concrete box girder and concrete T-beam girder Structures) falsework components
 shall be sized, positioned, and/or supported to minimize progressive increases in deflection
 of the Structure which would preload the concrete or reinforcing steel before it becomes
 fully composite.
 6-02.3(17)B2 Timber
 Each species and grade of timber/lumber used in constructing falsework and formwork
 shall be identified in the drawings. The allowable stresses and loads shall not exceed the lesser
 of stresses and loads given in the table below or factored stresses for designated species and
 grade in Table 7.3 of the Timber Construction Manual, latest edition, by the American Institute
 of Timber Construction.
 Compression perpendicular to the grain reduced to 300 psi for use when moisture content
 is 19 percent or more (areas exposed to rain, concrete curing water, green lumber).
 Compression parallel to the grain but not to exceed 1,500 psi.

 Flexural stress for members with a nominal depth greater than 8 inches.
 Flexural stress psi for members with a nominal depth of 8 inches or less.
 The maximum horizontal shear.
 AXIAL tension.
 The maximum modulus of elasticity (E) for timber.
 Where:
 L	 is the unsupported length; and
 d	 is the least dimension of a square or rectangular column, or the width of a square of equivalent
 	 cross-sectional area for round columns.
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 Concrete Structures
 
 The allowable stress for compression perpendicular to the grain, and for horizontal shear
 shall not be increased by any factors such as short duration loading. Additional requirements
 are found in other parts of Section 6-02.3(17). Criteria for the design of lumber and timber
 connections are found in Section 6-02.3(17)I.
 Plywood for formwork shall be designed in accordance with the methods and stresses
 allowed in the APA Design/Construction Guide for Concrete Forming as published by
 the American Plywood Association, Tacoma, Washington. As concrete forming is a
 special application for plywood, wet stresses shall be used and then adjusted for forming
 conditions such as duration of load, and experience factors. Concrete pour pressures shall be
 in accordance with Section 6-02.3(17)J.

 Roadways or railroads, all connections shall be bolted through the members using ⅝-inch
 diameter or larger bolts.
 Concrete traffic barrier shall be used to protect all falsework adjacent to traveled
 Roadways. The falsework shall be located so that falsework footings, mudsills, or piles are
 at least 2 feet clear of the traffic barrier and all other falsework members shall also be at least
 2 feet clear of the traffic barrier. Traffic barrier used to protect falsework shall not be fastened,
 guyed, or blocked to any falsework but shall be fastened to the pavement according to details
 shown in the Plans. The installation of concrete traffic barrier shall be completed before
 falsework erection is begun. The traffic barrier at the falsework shall not be removed until
 allowed by the Engineer. Falsework openings which are provided for the Contractor’s own use

 6-02.3(17)D3  Bents, Shoring Towers, Piling, Posts, and Caps
 Plans for falsework bents or shoring tower systems, including manufactured tower systems
 shall have plan, cross-section, and elevation view scale drawings showing all geometry.
 Show in the falsework plans the proximity of falsework to utilities or any nearby Structures
 including underground Structures. The ground elevation, cross-slopes, relation of stringers to
 one another, and dimensions to posts or piling shall be shown in the falsework plans. Column,
 pile, or tower heights shall be indicated. Member sizes, wall thickness and diameter of steel
 pipe columns or piles shall be shown in the falsework plans. Location of wedges, minimum
 bearing area and type of wedge material shall be identified in the falsework plans. Bracing
 size, location, material and all connections shall be described in the falsework plans.
 The relationship of the falsework bents or shoring tower systems to the permanent
 Structure’s pier and footing shall be shown. Load paths shall be as direct as possible. Loads
 shall be applied through the shear centers of all members to avoid torsion and buckling
 conditions. Where loads cause twisting, biaxial bending, or axial loading with bending, the
 affected members shall be designed for combined stresses and stability.
 Posts or columns shall be constructed plumb with tops and bottoms carefully cut to provide
 full end bearing. Caps shall be installed at all bents supported by posts or piling unless the
 falsework Working Drawings specifically permit otherwise. Caps shall be fastened to the
 piling or posts. The falsework shall be capable of supporting non uniform or localized loading
 without adverse effect. For example, the loading of cantilevered ends of stringers or caps shall
 not cause a condition of instability in the adjacent unloaded members.
 Timber posts and piling shall be fastened to the caps and mudsills by through-bolted
 connections, drift pins, or other accepted connections. The minimum diameter of round timber
 posts shall be shown in the falsework plans. Timber caps and timber mudsills shall be checked
 for crushing from columns or piling under maximum load.
 Steel posts and piling shall be welded or bolted to the caps, and shall be bolted or welded to
 the foundation. Steel members shall be checked for buckling, web yielding, and web crippling.
 Wedges shall be used to permit formwork to be taken up and released uniformly. Wedges
 shall be oak or close-grained Douglas fir. Cedar wedges or shims shall not be used anywhere
 in a falsework or forming system. Wedges shall be used at the top or bottom of shores, but
 not at both top and bottom. After the final adjustment of the shore elevation is complete, the
 wedges shall be fastened securely to the sill or cap beam. Only one set of wedges (with one

 optional block) shall be used at one location. Screw jacks (or other allowed devices) shall
 be used under arches to allow incremental release of the falsework.
 Sand jacks may be used to support falsework and are used for falsework lowering only.
 Sand jacks shall be constructed of steel with snug fitting steel or concrete pistons. Sand jacks
 shall be filled with dry sand and the jack protected from moisture throughout its use. They
 shall be designed and installed in such a way to prevent the unintentional migration or loss
 of sand. All sand jacks shall be tested in accordance with Section 6-02.3(17)G.
 When falsework is over or adjacent to Roadways or railroads, all details of the falsework
 system which contribute to the horizontal stability and resistance to impact shall be installed at
 the time each element of the falsework is erected and shall remain in place until the falsework
 is removed. For other requirements see Section 6-02.3(17)C.
 Transverse construction joints in the Superstructure shall be supported by falsework at the
 joint location. The falsework shall be constructed in such a manner that subsequent pours will
 not produce additional stresses in the concrete already in place.
 6-02.3(17)D4  Manufactured Shoring Tower Systems and Devices
 Manufactured proprietary shoring tower systems shall be identified in the falsework plans
 by make and model and safe working load capacity per leg. The safe working load for shoring
 tower systems shall be based upon a minimum 2½ to 1 factor of safety.
 The safe working load capacity, anticipated deflection (or settlement), make and model
 shall be identified in the falsework plans for manufactured devices such as: single shores,
 overhang brackets, support bracket and jack assemblies, friction collars and clamps, hangers,
 saddles, and sand jacks. The safe working load for shop manufactured devices shall be
 based on a minimum ultimate strength safety factor of 2 to 1. The safe working load for field
 fabricated devices and all single shores shall be based on a minimum ultimate strength safety
 factor of 3 to 1.
 The safe working load of all devices shall not be exceeded. The design loads shall be
 as defined by Section 6-02.3(17)A. The maximum allowable free end deflection of deck
 overhang brackets under working loads applied shall not exceed 3⁄16 inch measured at the
 edge of the concrete slab regardless of the fact that the deflection may be compensated for
 by pre-cambering or of setting the elevations high. The Contractor shall comply with all
 manufacturer’s Specifications; including those relating to bolt torque, placing washers under
 nuts and bolt heads, cleaning and oiling of parts, and the reuse of material. Devices which are
 deteriorated, bent, warped, or have poorly fitted connections or welds, shall not be installed.
 Shoring tower or device capacity as shown in catalogs or brochures published by the
 manufacturer shall be considered as the maximum load which the shoring is able to safely
 support under ideal conditions. These maximum values shall be reduced for adverse loading
 conditions; such as horizontal loads, eccentricity due to unbalanced spans or placing sequence,
 and uneven foundation settlement.
 Copies of catalog data and/or other technical data shall be furnished with the falsework
 plans to verify the load-carrying capacity, deflection, and manufacturers installation
 requirements of any manufactured product or device proposed for use. Upon request by the
 Engineer, the Contractor shall furnish manufacturer certified test reports and results showing
 load capacity, deflection, test installation conditions, and identify associated components
 and hardware for shoring tower systems or other devices. In addition to manufacturer’s
 requirements, the criteria shown in the following sections for manufactured proprietary
 shoring tower systems and devices shall be complied with when preparing falsework plans,
 calculations, and installing these shoring tower systems and devices as falsework.
 Alternative criteria and/or systems shall be submitted as a Type 2 Working Drawing
 consisting of a written statement on the manufacturer’s letterhead, signed by the shoring
 or device manufacturer (not signed by a material supplier or the Contractor) addressing
 the following:
 1.	 Identity of the specific Contract on which the alternative criteria and/or system will apply;
 2.	 Description of the alternative criteria and/or system;
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-39
 
 6-02
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 3.	 Technical data and test reports;
 4.	 The conditions under which the particular alternative criteria may be followed; and
 5.	 That a design based on the alternative criteria will not overstress or over deflect any
 shoring component or device nor reduce the required safety factor.
 In any case where the falsework drawings detail a manufactured product and the
 manufacturer’s safe working load, load versus deflection curves, factor of safety, and
 installation requirements cannot be found in any catalog, the Engineer may require load
 testing in accordance with Section 6-02.3(17)G to verify the safe working load and
 deflection characteristics.
 Tower leg loads shall not exceed the limiting values under any loading condition or
 sequence. Frame extensions and any reduced capacity shall be shown in the falsework plans.
 Screw jacks shall fit tight in the leg assemblies without wobble. Screw jacks shall be plumb
 and straight. Shoring towers shall be installed plumb, and load distribution beams shall
 be arranged such that vertical loads are distributed to all legs for all successive concrete
 placements. There shall be no eccentric loads on shoring tower heads unless the heads have
 been designed for such loading. Shoring towers shall remain square or rectangular in plan
 view and shall not be skewed. There shall be no interchanging of parts from one manufactured
 shoring system to another. Bent or faulty components shall not be used.
 For manufactured shoring towers that allow ganging of frames, the number of ganged
 frames shall be limited to one frame per opposing side of a tower, and the total number of legs
 per ganged tower shall not exceed eight legs. Ganged frames shall be installed in accordance
 with the manufacturer’s published standards using the manufacturer’s components. Other gang
 arrangements shall not be used.
 For manufactured steel shoring tower systems, the Contractor shall have bracing
 designed and installed for horizontal loads and falsework overturning in accordance with
 Section 6-02.3(17)A. Minimum bracing criteria and allowable leg loads are described in
 the following paragraphs.
 All shoring tower systems and bracing shall be thoroughly inspected by the Contractor
 for plumb vertical support members, secure connections, and straight bracing members
 immediately prior to, at intervals during, and immediately after every concrete placement.
 For manufactured shoring tower systems, the maximum allowable deviation from the vertical
 is ⅛ inch in 3 feet. If this tolerance is exceeded, concrete shall not be placed until adjustments
 have brought the shoring towers within the acceptable tolerance.
 6-02.3(17)E  Stringers, Beams, Joists, Bridge Deck Support, and Deck Overhangs
 All stringers, beams, joists, and bridge deck support shall be designed for the design loads,
 deflections, and allowable stresses described in the preceding Section 6-02.3(17)A, B, and C
 and for the following conditions.
 At points of support, stringers, beams, joists, and trusses shall be restrained against rotation
 about their longitudinal axis. The effect of biaxial bending shall be investigated in all cases
 where falsework beams are not set plumb and the Structure cross-slope exceeds 3 percent.
 For box girder and T-beam bridges, the centerline of falsework beams or stringers shall
 be located within 2 feet of the bridge girder stems and preferably directly under the stems or
 webs. Stringers supporting formwork for concrete box girder and T-beam slab overhangs shall
 be stiff enough so that the differential deflection due to the placement of bridge deck concrete
 is no more than 3/16 inch between the outside edge of the bridge deck and the exterior web
 even if camber strips can compensate for the deflection.
 Friction shall not be relied upon for lateral stability of beams or stringers. If the
 compression flange of a beam is not laterally restrained, the allowable bending stress shall be
 reduced to prevent flange buckling. If flange restraint is provided and since it is impossible
 to predict the direction in which a compression flange will buckle, positive restraint shall be
 provided in both directions. Flange restraint shall be designed for a minimum load of 2 percent
 of the calculated compression force in the beam flange at the point under consideration.
 Page 6-40
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02
 
 Camber strips shall be used to compensate for falsework take-up and deflection, vertical
 alignment, and the anticipated Structure dead load deflection shown in the camber diagram
 in the Contract Plans. Camber is the adjustment to the profile of a load-supporting beam or
 stringer so that the completed Structure will have the lines and grades shown in the Plans.
 The dead load camber diagram shown in the Contract Plans is the predicted Structure dead
 load deflection due to self mass. This dead load camber shall be increased by:
 1.	 Amount of anticipated falsework take up,
 2.	 Anticipated deflection of the falsework beam or stringer under the actual load
 imposed, and
 3.	 Any vertical curve compensation.
 Camber strips shall be fastened by nailing to the top of wood members, or by clamping or
 banding in the case of steel members. Camber strips shall have sufficient contact bearing area
 to prevent crushing under total load. As a general rule, camber strips are not required unless
 the total camber adjustment exceeds ¼ inch for exterior falsework stringers and ½ inch for
 interior stringers.
 On concrete box girder Structures, the forms supporting the bridge deck shall rest on
 ledgers or similar supports and shall not be supported from the bottom slab except as provided
 below. The form supports shall be fastened within 18 inches of the top of the web walls,
 producing a clear span between web walls. The bridge deck forms may be supported or posted
 from the bottom slab if the following conditions are met:
 1.	 Permanent access, shown in the Contract Plans, is provided to the cells, and the
 centerline to centerline distance between web walls is greater than 10 feet;
 2.	 Falsework stringers designed for total load, stresses and deflections in accordance with
 Section 6-02.3(17)A and B are located directly below each row of posts;
 3.	 Posts have adequate lateral restraint; and
 4.	 All forms (including the bridge deck forms), posts, and bracing are completely removed.
 The falsework and forms on concrete box girder Structures supporting a sloping web and
 deck overhang shall consist of a lateral support system which is designed to resist all rotational
 forces acting on the stem, including those caused by the placement of bridge deck concrete,
 bridge deck formwork mass, finishing machine, and other live loads. Stem reinforcing
 steel shall not be stressed by the construction of the bridge deck slab placement. Overhang
 brackets shall not be used for the support of bridge deck forms from sloping web concrete box
 girder bridges.
 Deck slab forms between girders or webs shall be constructed such that there is no
 differential settlement relative to the girders. The support systems for form panels supporting
 concrete deck slabs and overhangs on girder bridges (such as steel plate girders and
 prestressed girders) shall be designed as falsework. Falsework supporting deck slabs and
 overhangs on girder bridges shall be supported directly by the girders so that there will
 be no differential settlement between the girders and the deck forms during placement of
 deck concrete.
 6-02.3(17)F Bracing
 All falsework bracing systems shall be designed to resist the horizontal design load in
 all directions with the falsework in either the loaded or unloaded condition. All bracing,
 connection details, specific locations of connections, and hardware used shall be shown
 in the falsework plans. Falsework diagonal bracing shall be thoroughly analyzed with
 particular attention given to the connections. The allowable stresses in the diagonal braces
 may be controlled by the joint strength or the compression stability of the diagonal. Timber
 bracing for timber falsework bents shall have connections designed in accordance with
 Section 6-02.3(17)I. Any damaged cross-bracing, such as split timber members shall be
 replaced. Steel strapping shall avoid making sharp angles or right-angle bends. A means
 of preventing accidental loss of tension shall be provided for steel strapping. See Sections
 6-02.3(17)A, B, and C for design loads and allowable stresses.
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 6-02
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 Bracing shall not be attached to concrete traffic barrier, guardrail posts, or guardrail.
 To prevent falsework beam or stringer compression flange buckling, cross-bracing
 members and connections shall be designed to carry tension as well as compression. All
 components, connection details and specific locations shall be shown in the falsework plans.
 Bracing, blocking, struts, and ties required for positive lateral restraint of beam flanges shall
 be installed at right angles to the beam in plan view. If possible, bracing in adjacent bays shall
 be set in the same transverse plane. However, if because of skew or other considerations, it is
 necessary to offset the bracing in adjacent bays, the offset distance shall not exceed twice the
 depth of the beam.
 All falsework and bracing shall be inspected by the Contractor for plumbness of vertical
 support members, secure connections, tight cables, and straight bracing members immediately
 prior to, during, and immediately after every concrete placement.
 Bracing shall be provided to withstand all imposed loads during erection of the falsework
 and all phases of construction for falsework adjacent to any Roadway, sidewalk, or railroad
 track which is open to the public. All details of the falsework system which contribute to
 horizontal stability and resistance to impact, including the bolts in bracing, shall be installed
 at the time each element of the falsework is erected and shall remain in place until the
 falsework is removed. The falsework plans shall show provisions for any supplemental
 bracing or methods to be used to conform to this requirement during each phase of erection
 and removal. Wind loads shall be included in the design of such bracing or methods. Loads,
 connections, and materials for falsework adjacent to Roadways, shall also be in accordance
 with Section 6-02.3(17)C.
 6-02.3(17)F1  Cable or Tension Bracing Systems
 When cables, wire rope, steel rod, or other types of tension bracing members are used as
 external bracing to resist horizontal forces, or as temporary bracing to support bents while
 falsework is being erected or removed adjacent to traffic, all elements of the bracing system
 shall be shown in the falsework plans. Bracing shall not be attached to concrete traffic barrier,
 guardrail posts, or guardrail. Any damaged bracing, such as frayed and kinked guying systems
 shall be replaced. Wire rope shall avoid making sharp angles or right-angle bends and a means
 of preventing accidental loss of tension shall be provided. The following information shall be
 submitted as a Type 2 Working Drawing:
 1.	 Cable diameter, rod, or tension member size, and allowable working load.
 2.	 Location and method of attaching the cable, rod, or tension member to the falsework.
 The connecting device shall be designed to transfer both horizontal and vertical forces
 to the cable without overstressing any falsework component.
 3.	 The type of cable connectors or fastening devices (such as U-bolt clips, plate clamps,
 etc.) to be used and the efficiency factor for each type. If cables are to be spliced, the
 splicing method shall be shown.
 4.	 Method of tightening cables, rods, or tension members after installation if tightening is
 necessary to ensure their effectiveness. Method of preventing accidental loosening.
 5.	 Anchorage details, including the size and mass of concrete anchor blocks, the assumed
 coefficient of friction for surface anchorages, and the assumed lateral soil bearing
 capacity for buried anchorages.
 6.	 Method of pre-stretching or preloading cable or tension members.
 7.	 Determination of the potential stretch or elongation of the tension member under the
 design load and if the resulting lateral deflection will cause excessive secondary stresses
 in the falsework.

 6-02
 
 Copies of manufacturer’s catalog or brochure showing technical data pertaining to the type
 of cable to be used shall be furnished with the falsework plans. Technical data shall include the
 cable diameter, the number of strands and the number of wires per strand, ultimate breaking
 strength or recommended safe working strength, and any other information as may be needed
 to identify the cable.
 In the absence of sufficient technical data to identify the cable, or if it is old and obviously
 worn, the Contractor shall perform cable breaking tests to establish the safe working load for
 each reel of cable furnished. For static guy cable the minimum factor of safety shall be 3 to 1.
 The Contractor shall provide the Engineer an opportunity to witness these tests.
 When cable bracing is used to prevent the overturning of heavy-duty shoring, attention
 shall be given to the connections by which forces are transferred from the shoring to
 the cables. Cable restraint shall be designed to act through the cap system to prevent the
 inadvertent application of forces which the shoring is not designed to withstand. Cables shall
 not be attached to any tower component.
 Cable splices made by lapping and clipping with “Crosby” type clamps shall not be used.
 Other splicing methods may be used; however, at each location where the cable is spliced,
 cable strength shall be verified by a load test.
 When cables are used as external bracing to resist overturning of a falsework system, the
 horizontal load to be carried by the cables shall be calculated as follows:
 1.	 When used with heavy-duty shoring systems, cables shall be designed to resist the
 difference between 1.25 times the total overturning moment and the resistance to
 overturning provided by the individual falsework towers.
 2.	 When used with pipe-frame shoring systems where supplemental bracing is required,
 cables shall be designed to resist the difference between 1.25 times the total overturning
 moment and the resistance to overturning provided by the shoring system as a whole.
 3.	 When used as external bracing to prevent overturning of all other types of falsework,
 including temporary support during erection and removal of falsework at traffic
 openings, cables shall be designed to resist 1.25 times the total overturning moment.
 The maximum allowable cable design load shall be determined using the following criteria:
 1.	 If the cable is new, or is in uniformly good condition, and if it can be identified by
 reference to a manufacturer’s catalog or other technical publication, the allowable load
 shall be the ultimate strength of the cable as specified by the manufacturer, multiplied
 by the efficiency of the cable connector, and divided by a safety factor of 3 (i.e., safe
 working load = breaking strength × connector efficiency/safety factor).
 2.	 If the cable is used but still in serviceable condition, or is new or nearly new but cannot
 be found in a manufacturer’s catalog, the Contractor shall perform load breaking tests.
 In this case, the cable design load shall not exceed the breaking strength, as determined
 by the load test, multiplied by the connector efficiency factor, and divided by a safety
 factor of 3.
 3.	 If the cable is used and still in serviceable condition, or is a new or nearly new cable
 which cannot be identified, and if load breaking tests are not performed, the cable
 design load shall not exceed the safe working load shown in the wire rope capacities
 table multiplied by the cable connector efficiency.
 	 Cable connectors shall be designed in accordance with criteria shown in the following
 tables “Efficiency of Wire Rope Connections” and “Applying Wire Rope Clips”.
 Cable safe working loads are provided in table “Wire Rope Capacities”.

 6-02.3(17)F2  Applying Wire Rope Clips
 The only correct method of attaching U-bolt wire rope clips to rope ends is to place the
 base (saddle) of the clip against the live end of the rope, while the “U” of the bolt presses
 against the dead end.
 The clips are usually spaced about six rope diameters apart to give adequate holding
 power. A wire-rope thimble shall be used in the loop eye to prevent kinking when wire rope
 clips are used. The correct number of clips for safe application, and spacing distances, are
 shown below:

 6-02.3(17)F3  Anchor Blocks
 Concrete anchor blocks and connections used to resist forces from external bracing shall
 be shown in the falsework plans. Concrete anchor blocks shall be proportioned to resist both
 sliding and overturning. When designing anchor block stability, the mass of the anchor block
 shall be reduced by the vertical component of the cable or brace tension to obtain the net or
 effective mass to be used in the anchorage computations. The coefficient of friction assumed in
 the design shall not exceed the following:
 Anchor block set on sand
 Anchor block set on clay
 Anchor block set on gravel
 Anchor block set on pavement
 
 Friction Coefficient
 0.40
 0.50
 0.60
 0.60
 
 Multiply the friction coefficient by 0.67 if it is likely the supporting material is wet or
 will become wet during the construction period.
 
 The method of connecting the cable or brace to the anchor block is part of the anchor
 block design. The connection shall be designed to resist both horizontal and vertical forces.
 6-02.3(17)F4  Temporary Bracing for Bridge Girders During Erection
 Steel girders shall be braced in accordance with Section 6-03.3(7)A.
 Prestressed concrete girders shall be braced sequentially during girder erection. The 
 bracing shall be designed and detailed by the Contractor and shall be shown in the falsework/
 formwork Working Drawings. The Contractor shall furnish, install, and remove the bracing at
 no additional cost to the Contracting Agency.
 At a minimum, the Contractor shall brace girders at each end and at midspan to prevent
 lateral movement or rotation. This bracing shall be placed prior to the release of each
 girder from the erection equipment. If the bridge is constructed with cast-in-place concrete
 diaphragms, the bracing may be removed once the concrete in the diaphragms has been placed
 and cured for a minimum of 24 hours.
 6-02.3(17)F5  Temporary Bracing for Bridge Girders During Diaphragm and Bridge
 Deck Concrete Placement
 Prestressed concrete girders shall be braced to resist forces that would cause rotation or
 torsion in the girders caused by the placing of precast concrete deck panels and concrete for
 the bridge deck.

 Concrete Structures
 
 Bracing shall be designed and detailed by the Contractor and shall be shown in the
 falsework/formwork Working Drawings. These braces shall be furnished, installed, and
 removed by the Contractor at no additional cost to the Contracting Agency. The Contractor
 may consider the bracing effects of the diaphragms in developing the falsework/formwork
 plans. The Contractor shall account for the added load from concrete finishing machines and
 other construction loadings in the design of the bracing.
 Falsework support brackets and braces shall not be welded to structural steel bridge
 members or to steel reinforcing bars.
 6-02.3(17)G  Testing Falsework Devices
 The Contractor shall establish the load capacity and deflection (or settlement) of all friction
 collars and clamps, brackets, hangers, saddles, sand jacks, and similar devices utilizing a
 recognized independent testing Laboratory accepted by the Engineer. Laboratory tests shall
 use the same materials and design that will be used on the project. Test loads shall be applied
 to the device in the same manner that the device will experience loading on the project. Any
 bolts or threaded rods used with the device shall be identified as to diameter, length, type,
 grade, and torque. Any wedges, blocks, or shims used with the device on the project shall also
 be tested with the device. Any adjustable jack system used as a part of a device shall be tested
 with the device and shall have its maximum safe working extended height identified. Devices
 shall not be tested in contact with the permanent Structure. Independent members with the
 same properties as the permanent Structure shall be used to test device connections.
 At least 14 days prior to the test, the Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working Drawing
 consisting of the test procedure and scale drawing showing how the device will be tested
 and how data will be collected. The Contractor shall provide the Engineer an opportunity to
 witness these tests.
 The independent testing Laboratory shall provide a certified test report which shall be
 signed and dated. The test report shall clearly identify the device tested including trademarks
 and model numbers; identify all parts and materials used, including grade of steel, or lumber,
 member section dimensions; location, size, and the maximum tested extended height of any
 adjustable jacks; indicate condition of materials used in the device; indicate the size, length
 and location of all welds; indicate how much torque was used with all bolts and threaded rods.
 The report shall describe how the device was tested, report the results of the test, provide a
 scale drawing of the device showing the location(s) of where deflections or settlements were
 measured, and show where load was applied. Deflections or settlements shall be measured
 at load increments and the results shall be clearly graphed and labeled. Prior to installation
 of falsework devices named in this section, the Contractor shall submit Type 2 Working
 Drawings consisting of the certified test reports.
 The safe working load for shop manufactured devices named in this section shall be
 derived by dividing the ultimate strength by a safety factor of 2.0. The safe working load for
 field fabricated or field modified devices (including the use of timber blocks or wedges with
 the device) shall be determined by dividing the ultimate strength by a safety factor of 3.0.
 Working load shall include masses of all successive concrete placements, falsework, forms,
 all load transfer that takes place during post-tensioning, and any live loads; such as workers,
 Roadway finishing machines, and concrete delivery systems. The maximum allowable free
 end deflection of deck overhang brackets with combined dead and live working loads applied
 shall be 3⁄16 inch even though deflection may be compensated for by pre-cambering or setting
 the elevations high. The Contractor shall comply with all manufacturer’s Specifications;
 including those relating to bolt torque, cleaning and oiling of parts, and the reuse of material.
 Devices which are deteriorated, bent, warped or have poorly fitted connections or welds,
 shall not be installed.
 6-02.3(17)H  Formwork Accessories
 Formwork accessories such as form ties, form anchors, form hangers, anchoring inserts,
 and similar hardware shall be specifically identified in the formwork plans including the name
 Page 6-46
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02
 
 and size of the hardware, manufacturer, safe working load, and factor of safety. The grade of
 steel shall also be indicated for threaded rods, coil rods, and similar hardware. Wire form ties
 shall not be used. Welding or clamping formwork accessories to Contract Plan reinforcing
 steel will not be allowed. Driven types of anchorages for fastening forms or form supports
 to concrete, and Contractor fabricated “J” hooks shall not be used. Field drilling of holes in
 prestressed girders is not allowed.
 Taper ties may be used provided the following conditions are met:
 1.	 The structure is not designed to resist water pressure (pontoons, floating dolphins,
 detention vaults, etc.).
 2.	 After the taper tie is removed, plugs designed and intended for plugging taper tie
 holes shall be installed at each face of concrete. The plug shall be installed a minimum
 of 1½ inches clear from the face of concrete.
 3.	 After the plug is installed, the hole shall be cleaned of all grease, contamination and
 foreign matter.
 4.	 Holes on the exposed faces of concrete shall be patched and finished to match the
 surrounding concrete.
 The following table from ACI 347R-88 provides minimum safety factors for formwork
 accessories. The hardware proposed shall meet these minimum ultimate strength requirements
 or the manufacturer’s minimum requirements, whichever provides the greater factor of safety.
 The Contractor shall attach copies of the manufacturer’s catalog cuts and/or test data of
 hardware proposed, to the formwork plans and submit the falsework and formwork Working
 Drawings with supporting calculations in accordance with Section 6-02.3(16). In situations
 where catalog cuts and/or test data are not available, testing shall be performed in accordance
 with Section 6-02.3(17)G.

 *Safety factors are based on ultimate strength of the formwork accessory.
 
 The bearing area of external holding devices shall be adequate to prevent excessive bearing
 stress on form lumber. Form ties and form hangers shall be arranged symmetrically on the
 supporting members to minimize twisting or rotation of the members. Form tie elongation
 shall not exceed the allowable deflection of the wale or member that it supports. Inserts, bolts,
 coil rods, and other fasteners shall be analyzed and designed for appropriately combined
 bending, shear, torsion, and tension stresses. The formwork shall not be attached to Contract
 Plan rebar or rebar cages. However, the Contractor may install additional reinforcing steel for
 formwork anchorage.
 Frictional resistance shall not be considered as contributing to the stability of any
 connection or connecting device, except those designed as friction connectors such as U-bolt
 friction-type connectors.
 Form anchors and anchoring inserts shall be designed considering concrete strength at time
 of loading, available embedment, location in the member, and any other factors affecting their
 working strength, and shall be installed in concrete in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 published requirements. Form anchors and anchoring inserts embedded in previous concrete
 placements shall not be loaded until the concrete has reached the required design strength.
 The required design strength of concrete for loading of an anchor shall be shown in the
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 Concrete Structures
 
 formwork drawing if it is assumed that the anchor will be loaded before the concrete has
 reached its 28-day strength.
 Installation of permanent concrete inserts, such as form ties hangers, or embedded anchor
 assemblies, shall permit removal of all metal to at least ½ inch below the concrete surface.
 Holes shall be patched in accordance with Section 6-02.3(14). During removal of the outer
 unit, the bond between the concrete and the inner unit or rod shall not be broken.
 6-02.3(17)I  Timber Connections
 Timber connections shall be designed in accordance with the methods, stresses, and loads
 allowed in the Timber Construction Manual, Third Edition by the American Institute of Timber
 Construction (AITC). Timber falsework and formwork connections shall be designed using
 wet condition stresses for all installations West of the Cascade Range crest line and by criteria
 provided in the following sections. Frictional resistance shall not be considered as contributing
 to the stability of any timber connection.
 6-02.3(17)I1  Bolted Connections
 Tabulated values in the AITC Timber Construction Manual, Current Edition are based on
 square posts. For a round post or pile, the main member thickness shall be the side of a square
 post having the same cross-sectional area as the round post used.
 The AITC Table 6.20 for Douglas Fir-Larch bolt Group 3 and for Hem-Fir bolt Group
 8 show design values for bolts to be used when the load is applied either parallel or
 perpendicular to the direction of the wood grain. When the load is applied at an angle to the
 grain, as is the case with falsework bracing, the design value for the main member shall be
 obtained from the Hankinson formula shown in the AITC manual.
 Design values in the AITC Table 6.20 apply only to three-member joints (bolt in doubleshear) in which the side members are each ½ the thickness of the main member. This joint
 configuration is not typical of bridge falsework where side members are usually much
 smaller than main members. For two-member joints (single shear bolt condition), the AITC
 Table 6.20 values shall be adjusted by a single shear load factor as follows:
 1.	 0.75 for installations East of the Cascade Range crest line, except as shown in item
 3 below;
 2.	 0.50 for installations West of the Cascade Range crest line; and
 3.	 0.50 for load acting at an angle to the bolt axis, as is the case with longitudinal bracing
 when falsework bents are skewed.
 Except for connections in falsework adjacent to or over railroads or Roadways, threaded
 rods and coil rods may be used in place of bolts of the same diameter with no reduction in
 the tabulated values. At openings for Roadways and railroads, all connections shall be bolted
 using ⅝-inch diameter or larger through bolts.
 Bolt holes shall be a minimum 1⁄32 inch to a maximum ⅛ inch larger than the bolt diameter.
 A washer not less than a standard cut washer shall be installed between the wood and the bolt
 head and between the wood and the nut to distribute the bearing stress under the bolt head and
 nut and to avoid crushing the fibers. In lieu of standard cut washers, metal plates or straps with
 dimensions at least equal to that of a standard cut washer may be substituted.
 When steel bars or shapes are used as diagonal bracing, the tabulated design values shown
 in AITC Table 6.20 for the main members loaded parallel to grain (P value) are increased
 75 percent for joints made with bolts ½ inch or less in diameter, 25 percent for joints made
 with bolts 1½ inch in diameter, and proportionally for intermediate diameters. No increase in
 the tabulated values is allowed for perpendicular-to-grain loading (Q value).
 Clearance requirements for end, edge, and bolt spacing distance shall be as shown below.
 All distances are measured from the end or side of the wood member to the center of the bolt
 hole. For members which are subject to load reversals the larger controlling distances shall be
 used for design. For parallel-to-grain loading, the minimum distances for full design load:
 1.	 In tension, minimum end distance shall be seven times the bolt diameter;
 Page 6-48
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02
 
 2.	 In compression, minimum end distance shall be four times the bolt diameter; and
 3.	 In tension or compression, the minimum edge distance shall be one and one-half times
 the bolt diameter.
 For perpendicular-to-grain loading, the minimum distance for full design load:
 1.	 Minimum end distance shall be four times the bolt diameter;
 2.	 Edge distance toward which the load is acting shall be at least four times the bolt
 diameter; and
 3.	 Distance on the opposite edge shall be at least 1½-bolt diameters.
 Minimum clearance (spacing) between adjacent bolts in a row shall be four times the bolt
 diameter, measured center-to-center of the bolt holes.
 When more than two bolts are used in a line parallel to the axis of the side member,
 additional requirements shall be followed as shown in the AITC manual.
 6-02.3(17)I2  Lag Screw Connections
 Design values for lag screws subject to withdrawal loading are found in AITC Table 6.27.
 Values for wood having a specific gravity of 0.51 for Douglas Fir-Larch or 0.42 for Hem‑Fir
 shall be assumed when using the table. The withdrawal values are in pounds per inch of
 penetration of the threaded part of the lag screw into the side grain of the member holding
 the point, with the axis of the screw perpendicular to that member. The maximum load on
 a given screw shall not exceed the allowable tensile strength of the screw at the root section.
 AITC recommends against subjecting lag screws to end-grain withdrawal loading.
 However, if this condition cannot be avoided, the design value shall be 75 percent of the
 corresponding value for withdrawal from the side grain.
 Values in the Group II wood species column shall be used for Douglas Fir-Larch and the
 Group III wood species column shall be used for Hem-Fir. When the load is applied at an
 angle to the grain, as is the case with falsework bracing, the design value shall be obtained
 from the Hankinson formula shown in the AITC manual.
 When lag screws are subjected to a combined lateral and withdrawal loading, as would
 be the case with longitudinal bracing when the falsework bents are skewed, the effect of the
 lateral and withdrawal forces shall be determined separately. The withdrawal component of
 the applied load shall not exceed the allowable value in withdrawal. The lateral component
 of the applied load shall not exceed the allowable lateral load value.
 Lag screws shall be inserted in lead holes as follows:
 1.	 The clearance hole for the shank shall have the same diameter as the shank, and the
 same depth of penetration as the length of unthreaded shank;
 2.	 The lead hole for the threaded portion shall have a diameter equal to 60 to 75 percent
 of the shank diameter and a length equal to at least the length of the threaded portion.
 The larger percentile figure in each range shall apply to screws of the greater diameters
 used in Group II wood species;
 3.	 The threaded portion of the screw shall be inserted in its lead hole by turning with
 a wrench, not by driving with a hammer; and
 4.	 To facilitate insertion, soap or other lubricant shall be used on the screws or in the
 lead hole.
 6-02.3(17)I3  Drift Pin and Drift Bolt Connections
 When drift pins or drift bolts are used, the required length and penetration shall be
 determined using the following criteria. The lateral load-carrying capacity of drift pins and
 drift bolts driven into the side grain of a wood member shall be limited to 75 percent of the
 design values for a common bolt of the same diameter and length in the main member. For
 drift pin connections, the pin penetration into the connected members shall be increased
 to compensate for the absence of a bolt head and nut. For drift bolts or pins driven into the
 end grain of a member, the lateral load-carrying capacity shall be limited to 60 percent of
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-49
 
 6-02
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 the allowable side grain load (perpendicular to grain value) for an equal diameter bolt with
 nut. To develop this allowable load the drift bolt or pin shall penetrate at least 12 diameters
 into the end grain. To fully develop the allowable load of the drift bolts or pins, they shall
 be driven into predrilled holes, 1⁄16 inch less in diameter than the drift pin or bolt diameter.
 The criteria shown in the AITC Timber Construction Manual, Current Edition shall apply
 to drift bolt or pin connection allowable loads for the following conditions:
 1.	 Withdrawal resistance; and
 2.	 When there are more than two drift bolts or pins in a joint, allowable loads shall be further
 reduced by applying applicable modification factors shown in the AITC Table 6.3.
 6-02.3(17)I4  Nailed and Spiked Joints
 Joints using nails or spikes shall conform to the provisions of AITC. For side grain
 withdrawal, the values in AITC Table 6.35 for wood having a specific gravity of 0.51 for
 Douglas Fir-Larch and a specific gravity of 0.42 for Hem-Fir shall be used. End grain
 withdrawal shall not be used. For lateral loading, the values in AITC Table 6.36 for wood
 species Group II for Douglas Fir-Larch and wood species Group III for Hem-Fir shall be used.
 Diameters listed in the tables apply to fasteners before application of any protective coating.
 When more than one nail or spike is used in a joint, the total design value for the joint in
 withdrawal or lateral resistance shall be the sum of the design values for the individual nails
 or spikes.
 The tabulated design values for lateral loads are valid only when the nail penetrates
 into the main member at least 11 diameters for Douglas Fir-Larch and 13 diameters for
 Hem-Fir. Note that the values are maximum values for the type and size of fastener shown.
 The tabulated values shall not be increased even if the actual penetration is exceeded.
 When main member penetration is less than 11 diameters for Douglas Fir-Larch and
 13 diameters for Hem-Fir, the design value shall be determined by straight-line interpolation
 between zero and the tabulated load, except that penetration shall not be less than ⅓ of
 that specified.
 Double-headed or duplex nails used in falsework and formwork construction are shorter
 than common wire nails or box nails of the same size designation. They have less penetration
 into the main member and therefore their load-carrying capacity shall be adjusted accordingly.
 Nail and spike minimum spacing in timber connections shall be as follows:
 1.	 The average center-to-center distance between adjacent nails, measured in any
 direction, shall not be less than the required penetration into the main member for
 the size of nail being used; and
 2.	 The minimum end distance in the side member, and the minimum edge distance
 in both the side member and the main member, shall not be less than ½ of the
 required penetration.
 Allowable values for withdrawal and lateral load resistance are reduced when toe nails
 are used in accordance with the following:
 1.	 For withdrawal loading, the design load shall not exceed ⅔ of the value shown in
 the applicable design table; and
 2.	 For lateral loading, the design load shall not exceed 5⁄6 of the value shown in the
 applicable design table.
 Toe nails are recommended to be driven at an approximate angle of 30 degrees with the
 piece and started approximately ⅓ of the length of the nail from the end or side of the piece.
 6-02.3(17)I5  Timber Connection Adjustment for Duration of Load
 Tabulated values for timber fasteners are for normal duration of load and may be increased
 for short duration loading, except for connections used in falsework and formwork for post
 tensioned Structures and staged construction sequences. Duration of load adjustment for
 timber connections shall not be allowed for all post tensioned Structures and for staged
 Page 6-50
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02
 
 construction sequences where delayed and/or staged loading occurs for any type of concrete
 Structure. The adjustment for duration of load as described in this section applies only
 to design values for timber connectors, such as nails, bolts, and lag screws. Allowable
 stresses for timber and structural steel components used in the connection, as described in
 Section 6-02.3(17)B, are maximums and thus shall not be increased.
 Tabulated values for nails, bolts, and lag screws may be adjusted by the following durationof-load factors:
 1.	 1.25 for falsework design governed by the minimum design horizontal load or greater
 (3 percent or greater of the dead load),
 2.	 1.33 for falsework design governed by wind load, and
 3.	 2.00 for falsework design governed by impact loading.
 6-02.3(17)J Face Lumber, Studs, Wales, and Metal Forms
 Elements of this section shall be designed for the loads, allowable stresses, deflections,
 and conditions which pertain from other Subsections of Section 6-02.3(17).
 Forms battered or inclined above the concrete will tend to lift up as concrete is placed
 and shall have positive anchorage or counterweights designed to resist uplift and shall be
 shown in the formwork plans. Where the concrete pouring sequence causes fresh concrete
 to be significantly higher along one side of tied forms than the opposite side, a positive form
 anchorage system shall be designed capable of resisting the imbalance of horizontal thrust,
 and prevent the dislocation and sliding of the entire form unit.
 Wooden forms shall be faced with smooth sanded, exterior plywood. This plywood shall
 meet the requirements of the National Bureau of Standards, U.S. Product Standard PS 1, and
 the Design Specification of the American Plywood Association (APA). Each full sheet shall
 bear the APA stamp. The Contractor shall list in the form plans the grade and class of plywood.
 If the Engineer accepts the manufacturer’s certification of structural properties, the Contractor
 may use plywood that does not carry the APA stamp. Plywood panels stamped “shop” or “shop
 cutting”, shall not be used.
 Plyform is an APA plywood specifically designed and manufactured for concrete forming.
 Plyform differs from conventional exterior plywood grades in strength and the exterior face
 panels are sanded smooth and factory oiled. Likewise, there is a significant difference between
 grades designated Class 1, Class 2, and Structural I Plyform.
 The grades of plywood for various form applications shall be as follows:
 1.	 Traffic and Pedestrian Barriers (except those that will receive an architectural
 surface treatment) – Plywood used for these surfaces shall be APA grade High-Density
 Overlaid (HDO) Plyform Class I. But if the Contractor coats the form to prevent it
 from leaving joint and grain marks on the surface, plywood that meets or exceeds APA
 grades B-B Plyform Class I or B-C (Group I species) may be used. Under this option,
 the Contractor shall provide for the Engineer’s acceptance a 4-foot-square, test panel
 of concrete formed with the same plywood and coating as proposed in the form plans.
 This panel shall include one form joint along its centerline. The Contractor shall apply
 coating material, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, before applying chemical
 release agents.
 2.	 Other Exposed Surfaces (all but those on traffic and pedestrian barriers) – Plywood
 used to form these surfaces shall meet or exceed the requirements of APA grades B-B
 Plyform Class I or B-C (Group I series). If one face is less than B quality, the B (or
 better) face shall contact the concrete.
 3.	 Unexposed Surfaces (such as the underside of the bridge deck between girders, the
 interiors of box girders, etc., and traffic and pedestrian barriers where surfaces will
 receive an architectural treatment) – Plywood used to form these surfaces may be APA
 grade CDX, provided the Contractor complies with stress and deflection requirements
 stated elsewhere in these Specifications.
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-51
 
 6-02
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 Form joints on an exposed surface shall be in a horizontal or vertical plane. But in
 wingwalls and box girders, side form joints shall be placed at right angles and parallel to the
 Roadway grade. Joints parallel to studs or joists shall be backed by a stud or joist. Joints at
 right angles to studs and joists shall be backed by a stud or other backing the Engineer accepts.
 Perpendicular backing is not required if studs or joists are spaced:
 1.	 Nine inches or less on center and covered with ½-inch plywood, or
 2.	 Twelve inches or less on center and covered with ¾-inch plywood.
 The face grain of plywood shall run perpendicular to studs or joists unless shown otherwise
 on the Contractor’s formwork Working Drawings. Proposals to deviate from the perpendicular
 orientation shall be accompanied by supporting calculations of the stresses and deflections.
 Forming for all exposed curved surfaces shall follow the shape of the curve shown in the
 Contract Plans and shall not be chorded except as follows. On any retaining wall that follows
 a horizontal circular curve, the wall stems may be a series of short chords if:
 1.	 The chords within the panel are the same length, unless otherwise allowed
 by the Engineer;
 2.	 The chords do not vary from a true curve by more than ½ inch at any point; and
 3.	 All panel points are on the true curve.
 Where architectural treatment is required, the angle point for chords in wall stems shall
 fall at vertical rustication joints.
 For exposed surfaces of abutments, wingwalls, piers, retaining walls, and columns,
 the Contractor shall build forms of plywood at least ¾ inch thick with studs no more than
 12 inches on center. The Engineer may allow exceptions, but deflection of the plywood,
 studs, or wales shall never exceed 1⁄360 of the span (or 1⁄270 of the span for unexposed surfaces,
 including the bottom of the deck slab between girders).
 All form plywood shall be at least ½ inch thick except on sharply curved surfaces.
 There, the Contractor may use ¼-inch plywood if it is backed firmly with heavier material.
 Round columns or rounded pier shafts shall be formed with a self-supporting metal shell
 form or form tube that leaves a smooth, nonspiralling surface. Wood forms are not permitted.
 Metal forms shall not be used elsewhere unless the Engineer is satisfied with the surface
 and allows use in writing. The Engineer may withdraw allowing use of metal forms at any
 time. If permitted to use a combination of wood and metal in forms, the Contractor shall coat
 the forms so that the texture produced by the wood matches that of the metal. Aluminum shall
 not be used for metal forms.
 For design purposes, the Contractor shall assume that on vertical surfaces concrete exerts
 150 pounds per square foot per foot of depth. However, when the depth is reached where the
 rate of placement controls the pressure, the following table applies:

 All corners shall be beveled ¾ inch. However, footings, footing pedestals, and seals need
 not be beveled unless required in the Plans.
 All forms shall be as mortar-tight as possible with no water standing in them as the
 concrete is placed.
 The Contractor shall apply a parting compound on forms for exposed concrete surfaces.
 This compound shall be a chemical release agent that permits the forms to separate cleanly
 from the concrete. The compound shall not penetrate or stain the surface and shall not
 attract dirt or other foreign matter. After the forms are removed, the concrete surface shall
 be dust-free and have a uniform appearance. The Contractor shall apply the compound at the
 manufacturer’s recommended rate to produce a surface free of dusting action and yet provide
 easy removal of the forms.
 The Engineer may reject any forms that will not produce a satisfactory surface.
 6-02.3(17)K  Concrete Forms on Steel Spans
 Concrete forms on all steel Structures shall be removable and shall not remain in place.
 Where needed, the forms shall have openings for truss or girder members. Each opening shall
 be large enough to leave at least 1½ inches between the concrete and steel on all sides of the
 steel member after the forms have been removed. Unit Contract prices cover all costs related
 to these openings.
 The Contractor shall not weld any part of the form to any steel member.
 The compression member or bottom connection of cantilever formwork support
 brackets shall bear either within 6 inches maximum vertically of the bottom flange or
 within 6 inches maximum horizontally of a vertical web stiffener. The Contractor’s bridge
 deck form system shall be designed to prevent rotation of the steel girder. This can be
 achieved by temporary struts and ties or other methods the Contractor shows to be effective.
 Partial depth cantilever formwork support brackets that do not conform to the above
 requirements shall not be used unless the Contractor submits Type 2E Working Drawings
 consisting of details showing the additional formwork struts and ties used to brace the steel
 girder against web distortion caused by the partial depth bracket.
 If the Engineer permits bolt holes in the web to support form brackets, the holes shall be
 shop drilled unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer. The Contractor shall fill the holes
 with fully torqued ASTM F3125 Grade A325 bolts in accordance with Section 6-03.3(33).
 Each bolt head shall be placed on the exterior side of the web. There shall be no holes made in
 the flanges.

 6-02.3(17)L  Finishing Machine Support System
 Before using any finishing machine, the Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working Drawing
 consisting of detailed drawings that show the system proposed to support it. The Contractor
 shall not attach this (or any other) equipment support system to the sides or suspend it from
 any girder unless the Engineer permits. The Engineer will not permit such a method if it will
 unduly alter stress patterns or create too much stress in the girder.
 6-02.3(17)M Restricted Overhead Clearance Sign
 The Contractor shall notify the Engineer not less than 15 working days before the
 anticipated start of each falsework and girder erection operation whenever such falsework or
 girders will reduce clearances available to the public traffic. Falsework openings shall not be
 more restrictive to traffic than shown in the Contract Plans.
 Where the height of vehicular openings through falsework is less than 15 feet, a
 W 12-2 “Low Clearance Symbol Sign” shall be erected on the Shoulder in advance of the
 falsework and two or more W 12-301 and/or W 12-302 signs shall be attached to the falsework
 to provide accurate usable clearance information over the entire falsework opening. The
 posted low clearance shall include an allowance for anticipated falsework girder deflection
 (rounded-up to the next whole inch) due to design dead load, including all successive concrete
 pours. W 12-302 signs shall be used to designate prominent clearance restrictions and limits of
 usable clearance. In addition, where the clearance is less than the legal height limit (14 feet),
 a W 12-2 sign shall be erected in advance of the nearest intersecting road or wide point in the
 road at which a vehicle can detour or turn around. A W 13-501 sign indicating the distance
 to the low clearance shall be installed below the advance sign. The Engineer will furnish the
 above noted signs and the Contractor shall erect and maintain them, all in accordance with
 Section 1-10.3(3).
 When erecting falsework that restricts overhead clearance above a railroad track, the
 Contractor shall immediately (as soon as the restriction occurs) place restricted overhead
 clearance signs. Sign details are shown in the Standard Plans. Unit Contract prices cover
 all costs relating to these signs.
 6-02.3(17)N Removal of Falsework and Forms
 If the Engineer does not specify otherwise, the Contractor may request to remove forms
 based on the criteria in the table below. Both compressive strength and minimum time criteria
 shall be met if both are listed in the applicable row. The minimum time shall be from the time
 of the last concrete placement in the forms. In no case shall the Contractor remove forms or
 falsework without the Engineer’s concurrence.

 decision will be based on whether removing them would harm the cofferdam or crib and
 whether the forms will show in the finished Structure.
 All cells of a box girder Structure which have permanent access shall have all forms
 completely removed, including the bridge deck forms. All debris and all projections into the
 cells shall be removed. Unless otherwise shown in the Plans, the bridge deck interior forms in
 all other cells where no permanent access is available, may be left in place.
 Falsework and forms supporting sloping exterior webs shall not be released until the
 bridge deck and deck overhang concrete has obtained its removal strength and number of
 days criteria listed in the table above. Stem reshoring shall not be used.
 Open joints shown in the Plans shall have all forms completely removed, including
 Styrofoam products and form anchors, allowing the completed Structure to move freely.
 If the Contractor intends to support or suspend falsework and formwork from the bridge
 Structure while the falsework and formwork is being removed, the Contractor shall submit
 a Type 2 Working Drawing consisting of the falsework and formwork removal plan and
 calculations. The falsework and formwork removal plan shall include the following:
 1.	 The location and size of any cast-in-place falsework lowering holes and how the holes

 7.	 Place no additional load on the masonry plate until the grout has set at least 72 hours.
 After all grout under the masonry plate and in the anchor bolt cavities has attained a
 minimum strength of 4,000 psi, the anchor bolt nuts shall be tightened to snug tight. “Snug
 tight” means either the tightness reached by (1) a few blows from an impact wrench, or (2) the
 full effort of a person using a spud wrench. Once the nut is snug tight, the anchor bolt threads
 shall be burred just enough to prevent loosening of the nut.
 6-02.3(21) Drainage of Box Girder Cells
 To drain box girder cells, the Contractor shall provide and install, according to details
 in the Plans, short lengths of nonmetallic pipe in the bottom slab at the low point of each
 cell. The pipe shall have a minimum inside diameter of 4 inches. If the difference in Plan
 elevation is 2 inches or less, the Contractor shall install pipe in each end of the box girder
 cell. All drainage holes shall be screened in accordance with the Plan details.
 6-02.3(22) Drainage of Substructure
 The Contractor shall use weep holes and gravel backfill that complies with

 heating procedures, and any inspection or testing requirements.
 Field bending shall not be done on reinforcement within the top or bottom third of column
 lengths or within plastic hinge regions identified in the Plans. Field bending shall not be done
 on bar sizes No. 14 or No. 18.
 In field-bending steel reinforcing bars, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Make the bend gradually using a bending tool equipped with a bending diameter
 as listed in Table 1. Bending shall not be done by means of hammer blows and
 pipe sleeves. When bending to straighten a previously bent bar, move a hickey bar
 progressively around the bend.
 2.	 Apply heat as described below for bending bar sizes No. 6 through No. 11 and
 for bending bar sizes No. 5 and smaller when the bars have been previously bent.
 Previously unbent bars of sizes No. 5 and smaller may be bent without heating when
 the bar temperature is 40°F or higher. When previously unbent bars of sizes No. 5 and
 smaller have a bar temperature lower than 40°F, they shall be heated to within the range
 of 100°F to 150°F prior to bending. In applying heat for field-bending steel reinforcing
 bars, the Contractor shall:
 a.	 Avoid damage to the concrete by insulating any concrete within 6 inches of the
 heated bar area;
 b.	 Apply two heat tips simultaneously at opposite sides of bar sizes No. 7 or larger;
 c.	 Heat the bar to within the required temperature range shown in Table 2 as verified by
 using temperature-indicating crayons or other suitable means;

 6-02.3(24)B  Protection of Materials
 The Contractor shall protect reinforcing steel from all damage. When placed into the
 Structure, the steel shall be free from dirt, loose rust or mill scale, paint, oil, and other
 foreign matter.
 When transporting, storing, or constructing in close proximity to bodies of salt water, plain
 and epoxy-coated steel reinforcing bar shall be kept in enclosures that provide protection from
 the elements.
 If plain or epoxy-coated steel reinforcing bar is exposed to mist, spray, or fog that may
 contain salt, it shall be flushed with fresh water prior to concrete placement.
 When the Engineer requires protection for reinforcing steel that will remain exposed for
 a length of time, the Contractor shall protect the reinforcing steel:
 1.	 By cleaning and applying a coat of paint conforming to Section 9-08.1(2)B over all
 exposed surfaces of steel, or
 2.	 By cleaning and painting paint conforming to Section 9-08.1(2)B on the first 6 inches
 of the steel bars protruding from the concrete and covering the bars with polyethylene
 sleeves.
 The paint shall have a minimum dry film thickness of 1 mil.
 6-02.3(24)C Placing and Fastening
 The Contractor shall position reinforcing steel as the Plans require and shall ensure that the
 steel does not move as the concrete is placed.
 When spacing between bars is 1 foot or more, they shall be tied at all intersections. When
 spacing is less than 1 foot, every other intersection shall be tied. If the Plans require bundled
 bars, they shall be tied together with wires at least every 6 feet. All epoxy-coated bars in the
 top mat of the bridge deck shall be tied at all intersections. Other epoxy-coated bars shall also
 be tied at all intersections, but shall be tied at alternate intersections when spacing is less than
 1 foot in each direction. Wire used for tying epoxy-coated reinforcing steel shall be plastic
 coated. Tack welding is not permitted on reinforcing steel.
 Abrupt bends in the steel are permitted only when one steel member bends around another.
 Vertical stirrups shall pass around main reinforcement or be firmly attached to it.
 For slip-formed concrete, the reinforcing steel bars shall be tied at all intersections
 and cross braced to keep the cage from moving during concrete placement. Cross bracing
 shall be with additional reinforcing steel. Cross bracing shall be placed both longitudinally
 and transversely.

 Concrete Structures
 
 After reinforcing steel bars are placed in a traffic or pedestrian barrier and prior to slip‑form
 concrete placement, the Contractor shall check clearances and reinforcing steel bar placement.
 This check shall be accomplished by using a template or by operating the slip-form machine
 over the entire length of the traffic or pedestrian barrier. All clearance and reinforcing steel
 bar placement deficiencies shall be corrected by the Contractor before slip‑form concrete
 placement.
 Mortar blocks (or other accepted devices) shall be used to maintain the concrete coverage
 required by the Plans. The Mortar blocks shall:
 1.	 Have a bearing surface measuring not greater than 2 inches in either dimension, and
 2.	 Have a compressive strength equal to that of the concrete in which they are embedded.
 In slabs, each mortar cube shall have either: (1) a grooved top that will hold the reinforcing
 bar in place, or (2) an embedded wire that protrudes and is tied to the reinforcing steel. If this
 wire is used around epoxy-coated bars, it shall be coated with plastic.
 Mortar blocks may be accepted based on a Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance.
 In lieu of mortar blocks, the Contractor may use metal or plastic chair supports to hold
 uncoated bars. Any surface of a metal chair support that will not be covered by at least ½ inch
 of concrete shall be one of the following:
 1.	 Hot-dip galvanized after fabrication in keeping with AASHTO M232 Class D;
 2.	 Coated with plastic firmly bonded to the metal. This plastic shall be at least 3⁄32 inch
 thick where it touches the form and shall not react chemically with the concrete when
 tested in the State Materials Laboratory. The plastic shall not shatter or crack at or
 above -5°F and shall not deform enough to expose the metal at or below 200°F; or
 3.	 Stainless steel that meet the requirements of ASTM A493, Type 302. Stainless steel
 chair supports are not required to be galvanized or plastic coated.
 In lieu of mortar blocks, epoxy-coated reinforcing bars may be supported by one of
 the following:
 1.	 Metal chair supports coated entirely with a dielectric material such as epoxy or plastic,
 2.	 Other epoxy-coated reinforcing bars, or
 3.	 Plastic chair supports.
 Plastic chair supports shall be lightweight, non-porous, and chemically inert in concrete.
 Plastic chair supports shall have rounded seatings, shall not deform under load during normal
 temperatures, and shall not shatter or crack under impact loading in cold weather. Plastic
 chair supports shall be placed at spacings greater than 1 foot along the bar and shall have at
 least 25 percent of their gross place area perforated to compensate for the difference in the
 coefficient of thermal expansion between plastic and concrete. The shape and configuration
 of plastic supports shall permit complete concrete consolidation in and around the support.
 In bridge decks, a “mat” is two adjacent and perpendicular layers of reinforcing steel. Top
 and bottom mats shall be supported adequately enough to hold both in their proper positions.
 If No. 4 bars make up the lower layer of steel in a mat, it shall be blocked at not more than
 3-foot intervals (or 4-foot intervals for bars No. 5 and larger). Wire ties to girder stirrups shall
 not be considered as blocking. To provide a rigid mat, the Contractor shall add other supports
 and tie wires to the top mat as needed.
 If a bar will interfere with a bridge drain, it shall be bent in the field to bypass the drain.
 Clearances for main bars shall be at least:
   4 inches between:	
 Bars and the surface of any concrete masonry exposed to
 		
 the action of salt or alkaline water.

 the placement of the reinforcing steel. (Any concrete placed without the Engineer’s
 permission shall be rejected and removed.)
 6-02.3(24)D  Splicing
 The Contractor shall supply steel reinforcing bars in the full lengths the Plans require.
 Unless the Engineer concurs in writing, the Contractor shall not change the number, type,
 or location of splices.
 The Engineer may permit the Contractor to use thermal or mechanical splices in place of
 the method shown in the Plans if they are of an accepted design. Use of a new design may
 be granted if:
 1.	 The Contractor provides technical data and proof from the manufacturer that the
 design will perform satisfactorily, and
 2.	 Sample splices and materials from the manufacturer pass the Engineer’s tests.
 The Contractor shall:
 1.	 Not lap-splice reinforcing bars Nos. 14 or 18.
 2.	 Not permit any welded or mechanical splice to deviate in alignment more than ¼ inch

 For the purpose of compatibility with AWS D1.4, welded lap splices for spiral or hoop
 reinforcing shall be considered Flare-V groove welds, indirect butt joints.
 The Contractor is responsible for using a welding sequence that will limit the alignment
 distortion of the bars due to the effects of welding. The maximum out-of-line permitted will
 be ¼ inch from a 3.5-foot straightedge centered on the weld and in line with the bar.
 The ground wire from the welding machine shall be clamped to the bar being welded.
 Where epoxy-coated steel reinforcing bars are specified to be spliced by welding, the
 epoxy coating shall be left off or removed from the surfaces to be heated, but in no cases

 according to the manufacturer’s instructions and all requirements of this section.
 All splices shall meet these criteria:
 1.	 Mechanical splices shall develop at least 125 percent of the specified yield strength of
 the unspliced bar. The ultimate tensile strength of the mechanical splice shall exceed
 that of the unspliced bar.
 2.	 The total slip of the bar within the spliced sleeve of the connector after loading in
 tension to 30.0 ksi and relaxing to 3.0 ksi shall not exceed the following measured

 3.	 The maximum allowable bar size for mechanical laps splices shall be No. 6.
 The Engineer will visually inspect the splices and accept all that appear to conform with
 the test samples. For sleeve-filler splices, the Engineer will allow voids within the limits on
 file in the Working Drawing design submittal. If the Engineer considers any splice defective,
 it shall be removed and replaced at the Contractor’s expense.
 In preparing sleeve-filler metal splices, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Clean the bar surfaces by: (a) oxyacetylene torch followed by power wire brushing,

 4.	 Prepare the ends of the bars as the splice manufacturer recommends and as the accepted
 procedure requires; and
 5.	 Preheat, just before adding the filler, the entire sleeve and bar ends to 300°F, plus or
 minus 50°F. (If a gas torch is used, the flame shall not be directed into the sleeve.)
 When a metallic, sleeve-filler splice is used (or any other system requiring special
 equipment), both the system and the operator shall qualify in the following way under the
 supervision of the State Materials and Fabrication Inspector. The operator shall prepare six
 test splices (three vertical, three horizontal) using bars having the same AASHTO Designation
 and size (maximum) as those to be used in the Work. Each test sample shall be 42 inches
 long, made up of two 21-inch bars joined end-to-end by the splice. The bar alignment shall
 not deviate more than ⅛ inch from a straight line over the whole length of the sample. All six
 samples must meet the tensile strength and slip criteria specified in this section.
 The Contractor shall provide labor, materials, and equipment for making these test samples
 at no expense to the Contracting Agency. The Contracting Agency will test the samples at no
 cost to the Contractor.
 6-02.3(24)G  Job Control Tests
 As the Work progresses, the Engineer may require the Contractor to provide a sample
 splice (thermal or mechanical) to be used in a job control test. The operator shall create this
 sample on the job site with the Engineer present using bars of the same size as those being
 spliced in the Work. The sample shall comply with all requirements of these Specifications,
 and is in addition to all other sample splices required for qualification. The Engineer will
 require no more than two samples on any project with fewer than 200 splices and no more
 than one sample per 100 splices on any project with more than 200 splices.

 This Work is furnishing, fabricating, coating, and placing epoxy-coated steel reinforcing
 bars as the Plans, these Specifications, and the Special Provisions require. Coating material
 shall be applied electrostatically, by spraying, or by the fluidized-bed method.
 All epoxy-coated bars shall comply with the requirements of Section 9-07. Fabrication may
 occur before or after coating.
 The Contractor shall protect epoxy-coated bars from damage using padded or nonmetallic
 slings and straps free from dirt or grit. To prevent abrasion from bending or sagging, the
 Contractor shall lift bundled bars with a strong-back, multiple supports, or a platform bridge.
 Bundled bars shall not be dropped or dragged. During shop or field storage, bars shall rest
 on wooden or padded cribbing. The Contractor may substitute other methods for protecting
 the bars if the Engineer concurs. If the Engineer believes the coated bars have been badly
 damaged, they will be rejected.
 Metal chairs and supports shall be coated with epoxy (or another inert coating accepted by
 the Engineer). The Contractor may use other support devices with the Engineer’s concurrence.
 Plastic coated tie wires (accepted by the Engineer) shall be used to protect the coated bars
 from being damaged during placement.
 The bars shall be placed as the Plans require and held firmly in place during placing and
 setting of the concrete. All bars shall be placed and fastened as specified in Section 6-02.3(24)C.
 In the interval between installing coated bars and concreting the deck, the Contractor shall
 protect the coating from damage that might result from other construction Work.
 The Engineer will inspect the coated bars after they are placed and before the deck
 concrete is placed. The Contractor shall patch any areas that show significant damage
 (as defined below).
 Significant damage means any opening in the coating that exposes the steel in an area
 that exceeds:
 1.	 0.05 square inch (approximately ¼ inch square or ¼ inch in diameter or the equivalent).
 2.	 0.012 square inches (approximately ⅛ inch square or ⅛ inch in diameter) when the
 opening is within ¼ inch of another opening of equal or larger size.
 3.	 6 inches long, any width.
 4.	 0.50 square inch aggregate area in any 1 foot length of bar.
 The Contractor shall patch significantly damaged areas with a patching material obtained
 from the epoxy resin manufacturer and accepted by the Engineer. This material shall be
 compatible with the coating and inert in concrete. Areas to be patched shall be clean and free
 of surface contaminants. Patching shall be done before oxidation occurs and according to the
 resin manufacturer’s instructions.
 6-02.3(25) Prestressed Concrete Girders
 The Contractor shall perform quality control inspection. The manufacturing plant of
 prestressed concrete girders shall be certified by the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute’s
 Plant Certification Program for the type of prestressed member to be produced and shall
 be approved by WSDOT as a Certified Prestress Concrete Fabricator prior to the start
 of production. WSDOT certification will be granted at, and renewed during, the annual
 prestressed plant review and approval process in accordance with WSDOT Materials Manual
 M 46-01.04 Standard Practice QC 6.
 Prior to the start of production of girders, the Contractor shall advise the Engineer of the
 production schedule. The Contractor shall give the Inspector safe and free access to the Work.
 If the Inspector observes any nonspecification Work or unacceptable quality control practices,
 the Inspector will advise the plant manager. If the corrective action is not acceptable to the
 Engineer, the girder(s) will be subject to rejection by the Engineer.
 The Contracting Agency intends to perform Quality Assurance Inspection. By its
 inspection, the Contracting Agency intends only to facilitate the Work and verify the quality

 reinforcing bars required in cast-in-place closures.
 6-02.3(25)B Prestressing
 Each stressing system shall have a pressure gauge or load cell that will measure jacking
 force. The gauge shall display pressure accurately and readably with a dial at least 6 inches
 in diameter or with a digital display. Each jack and its gauge shall be calibrated as a unit
 and shall be accompanied by a certified calibration chart. The Contractor shall submit a
 Type 1 Working Drawing consisting of one copy of this chart. The cylinder extension during
 calibration shall be in approximately the position it will occupy at final jacking force.

 Page 6-66
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02
 
 The Engineer may use load cells to check jacks, gauges, and calibration charts before and
 during tensioning.
 All load cells shall be calibrated and shall have an indicator that shows prestressing force
 in the strand. The range of this cell shall be broad enough that the lowest 10 percent of the
 manufacturer’s rated capacity will not be used to measure jacking force.
 From manufacture to encasement in concrete, prestressing strand shall be protected against
 dirt, oil, grease, damage, and all corrosives. Strand shall be stored in a dry, covered area
 and shall be kept in the manufacturer’s original packaging until placement in the forms. If
 prestressing strand has been damaged or pitted, it will be rejected. Prestressing strand with rust
 shall be spot-cleaned with a nonmetallic pad to inspect for any sign of pitting or section loss.
 Once the prestressing steel has been installed, no welds or grounds for welders shall be made
 on the forms or the steel in the girder, except as specified.
 Post-tensioning of spliced prestressed concrete girders shall conform to Section 6-02.3(26)
 and the following requirements:
 1.	 Before tensioning, the Contractor shall remove all side forms from the cast-in-place
 concrete closures. From this point until 48 hours after grouting the tendons, the
 Contractor shall keep all construction and other live loads off the Superstructure and
 shall keep the falsework supporting the superstructure in place.
 2.	 The Contractor shall not tension the post-tensioning reinforcement until the concrete
 in the cast-in-place closures reaches the minimum compressive strength specified in
 the Plans. This strength shall be measured with concrete cylinders made of the same
 concrete and cured under the same conditions as the cast-in-place closures.
 3.	 All post-tensioning shall be completed before placing the sidewalks and barriers on the
 Superstructure.
 6-02.3(25)C Casting
 Side forms shall be steel except that cast-in-place concrete closure forms for spliced
 prestressed concrete girders, interior forms of prestressed concrete tub girders, and end
 bulkhead forms of prestressed concrete girders may be wood. Interior voids for prestressed
 concrete slab girders with voids shall be formed by either wax soaked cardboard or expanded
 polystyrene forms. The interior void forms shall be secured in the position as shown in the
 Working Drawings, and shall remain in place.
 All concrete mixes to be used shall be preapproved in the WSDOT plant certification
 process. The temperature of the concrete when placed shall be between 50°F and 90°F.
 Slump shall not exceed 4 inches for normal concrete nor 7 inches with the use of a
 high range water-reducing admixture, nor 9 inches when both a high range water-reducing
 admixture is used and the water/cement ratio is less than or equal to 0.35. For selfconsolidating concrete (SCC), the slump requirements specified above do not apply, and are
 instead replaced by the target slump flow and slump flow range specified as part of the SCC
 mix design.
 Air-entrainment is not required in the concrete placed into prestressed concrete girders,
 including cast-in-place concrete closures for spliced prestressed concrete girders.
 6-02.3(25)C1  Acceptance Testing of Concrete for Prestressed Concrete Girders
 Compressive strength cylinders and concrete acceptance testing shall be performed
 once per prestressed concrete girder or once per fabrication line of prestressed concrete
 girders. Concrete shall not be placed until fresh concrete testing indicates concrete is within
 acceptable limits.
 Acceptance testing shall be performed by the Contractor and test results shall be submitted
 to the Engineer. Unless otherwise noted below, the test methods described in Section
 6-02.3(5)D shall be followed. Concrete compressive strength shall be in accordance with
 Section 6-02.3(25)E.
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-67
 
 6-02
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 Concrete that is not self-consolidating concrete will be accepted as follows:
 1.	 Temperature within the allowable temperature band.
 2.	 Slump below the maximum allowed.
 Concrete that is self-consolidating concrete will be accepted as follows:
 1.	 Temperature within the allowable temperature band.
 2.	 Slump flow within the target slump flow range
 3.	 VSI less than or equal to 1 in accordance with ASTM C1611, Appendix X1, using

 5.	 Rapid assessment of static segregation resistance of self-consolidating concrete using
 penetration test in accordance with ASTM C1712 shall be less than or equal to 15 mm.
 6-02.3(25)D Curing
 During curing, the Contractor shall keep the girder in a saturated curing atmosphere until
 the girder concrete has reached the required release strength. If the Engineer concurs, the
 Contractor may shorten curing time by heating the outside of impervious forms. Heat may be
 radiant, convection, conducted steam, or hot air. With steam, the arrangement shall envelop the
 entire surface with saturated steam. Hot air curing will not be allowed, unless the Contractor
 submits Type 2 Working Drawings consisting of the proposed method to envelop and maintain
 the girder in a saturated atmosphere. Saturated atmosphere means a relative humidity of at
 least 90 percent. The Contractor shall never allow dry heat to touch the girder surface at
 any point.
 Under heat curing methods, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Keep all unformed girder surfaces in a saturated atmosphere throughout the curing time;
 2.	 Embed a thermocouple (linked with a thermometer accurate to plus or minus 5°F) 6 to
 8 inches from the top or bottom of the girder on its centerline and near its midpoint;
 3.	 Monitor with a recording sensor (accurate to plus or minus 5°F) arranged and calibrated
 to continuously record, date, and identify concrete temperature throughout the
 heating cycle;
 4.	 Make this temperature record available for the Engineer to inspect;
 5.	 Heat concrete to no more than 100°F during the first 2 hours after placing the concrete,
 and then increase no more than 25°F per hour to a maximum of 175°F;
 6.	 Cool concrete, after curing is complete, no more than 25°F per hour, to 100°F; and
 7.	 Keep the temperature of the concrete above 60°F until the girder reaches release
 strength.
 The Contractor may strip side forms from prestressed concrete girders once the concrete
 has reached a minimum compressive strength of 3,000 psi. All damage from stripping is the
 Contractor’s responsibility.
 Curing of cast-in-place concrete closures for spliced prestressed concrete girders shall
 conform to Section 6-02.3(11).
 6-02.3(25)E  Contractors Control Strength
 Concrete strength shall be measured on test cylinders cast from the same concrete as that in
 the girder. These cylinders shall be cured under time-temperature relationships and conditions
 that simulate those of the girder. If the forms are heated by steam or hot air, test cylinders will
 remain in the coolest zone throughout curing. If forms are heated another way, the Contractor
 shall provide a record of the curing time-temperature relationship for the cylinders for each
 girder to the Engineer. When two or more girders are cast in a continuous line and in a
 continuous pour, a single set of test cylinders may represent all girders provided the Contractor
 demonstrates uniformity of casting and curing to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 
 Page 6-68
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02
 
 The Contractor shall mold, cure, and test enough of these cylinders to satisfy Specification
 requirements for measuring concrete strength. The Contractor may use 4- by 8-inch or 6- by
 12-inch cylinders.
 Test cylinders may be cured in a moist room or water tank in accordance with FOP
 for AASHTO T 23 after the girder concrete has obtained the required release strength. If,
 however, the Contractor intends to ship the girder prior to the standard 28-day strength
 test, the design strength for shipping shall be determined from cylinders placed with the
 girder and cured under the same conditions as the girder. These cylinders may be placed in
 a noninsulated, moisture-proof envelope.
 To measure concrete strength in the girder, the Contractor shall randomly select two test
 cylinders. The average compressive strength of the two cylinders shall be equal or greater than
 the specified strength and neither cylinder shall have a compressive strength that is more than
 5 percent below the specified strength.
 If too few cylinders were molded to carry out all required tests on the girder, the Contractor
 shall remove and test cores from the girder under the surveillance of the Engineer. If the
 Contractor casts cylinders to represent more than one girder, all girders in that line shall
 be cored and tested. Cores shall avoid all prestressing strands, steel reinforcing bars and
 interior voids.
 For prestressed concrete slab girders, a test shall consist of four cores measuring 3 inches
 in diameter by 6 inches in length (for slabs) or by the thickness of the web (for ribbed and
 double tee sections). Two cores shall be taken from each side of the girder with one on each
 side of the girder span midpoint, at locations accepted by the Engineer. The core locations
 for prestressed concrete ribbed and double tee sections shall be immediately beneath the
 top flange.
 For prestressed concrete tub girders, a test shall consist of four cores measuring
 3 inches in diameter by the thickness of the web. Two cores shall be taken from each web
 approximately 3 feet to the left and to the right of the center of the girder span.
 For all other prestressed concrete girders, a test shall consist of three cores measuring
 3 inches in diameter by the thickness of the web and shall be removed from just below the
 top flange; one at the midpoint of the girder’s length and the other two approximately 3 feet
 to the left and approximately 3 feet to the right.
 The cores shall be taken in accordance with AASHTO T 24 and shall be tested in
 accordance with AASHTO T 22. The Engineer may accept the girder if the average
 compressive strength of the all test cores from the girder are at least 85 percent of the specified
 compressive strength with no one core less than 75 percent of specified compressive strength.
 If there are more than four cored holes in a girder, the prestressing reinforcement shall
 not be released until the holes are patched and the patch material has attained a minimum
 compressive strength equal to the required release compressive strength.
 All cored holes shall be patched and cured prior to shipment of the girder. The girder
 shall not be shipped until tests show the patch material has attained a minimum compressive
 strength of 4,000 psi.
 If the annual plant approval includes procedures for patching cored holes, the cored holes
 shall be patched in accordance with this procedure. Otherwise, the Contractor shall submit a
 core hole patching procedure as a Type 2 Working Drawing.
 6-02.3(25)F  Prestress Release
 Side and flange forms that restrain deflection shall be removed before release of the
 prestressing reinforcement.
 All strands shall be released in a way that will minimize eccentricity of the prestressing
 force about the centerline of the girder. This release shall not occur until tests show each girder
 has reached the minimum compressive strength required by the Plans.
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-69
 
 6-02
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 The Contractor may request permission to release the prestressing reinforcement at a
 minimum concrete compressive strength less than specified in the Plans. This request shall
 be submitted as a Type 2E Working Drawing analyzing changes in vertical deflection, girder
 lateral stability and concrete stresses in accordance with Section 6-02.3(25)L2.
 6-02.3(25)G  Protection of Exposed Reinforcement
 When a girder is removed from its casting bed, all prestressing reinforcement strands
 projecting from the girder shall be cleaned and painted with a minimum dry film thickness
 of 1 mil of paint conforming to Section 9-08.1(2)B, and all steel reinforcing bars, including
 welded wire fabric, projecting from the girder shall be protected in accordance with Section
 6-02.3(24)B. During handling and shipping, projecting reinforcement shall be protected
 from bending or breaking. Just before placing concrete around the painted projecting bars or
 strands, the Contractor shall remove from them all spattered concrete remaining from girder
 casting, dirt, oil, and other foreign matter.
 6-02.3(25)H Finishing
 The Contractor shall apply a Class 1 finish, as defined in Section 6-02.3(14), to:
 1.	 The exterior surfaces of the outside girders; and
 2.	 The bottoms, sides, and tops of the lower flanges on all girders, including the top of the
 bottom slab between the tub girder webs.
 All other girder surfaces shall receive a Class 2 finish.
 The interface on girders that contact a cast-in-place concrete deck shall have a finish of
 dense, screeded concrete without a smooth sheen or laitance on the surface. After vibrating
 and screeding, and just before the concrete reaches initial set, the Contractor shall texture
 the interface. This texture shall be applied with a steel brooming tool that etches the surface
 transversely leaving grooves ⅛ to ¼ inch wide, between ⅛ and ¼ inch deep, and spaced ¼ to
 ½ inch apart.
 On prestressed concrete wide flange deck girders, deck bulb tee girders, ribbed section
 girders and double tee girders, the Contractor shall test the top surface for flatness and make
 corrections in accordance with Section 6-02.3(10)D3 except that the straightedge need not
 exceed the width of the girder top flange when checking the transverse direction. The top
 surface shall be finished in accordance with Section 6-02.3(10)D6.
 The Contractor may repair defects in the girder provided the repair is covered in the annual
 plant approval package. Any repairs that are not covered by the annual plant approval process
 shall be submitted to the Engineer as Type 2 Working Drawings or shall be submitted through
 the email resolution process.
 6-02.3(25)I  Fabrication Tolerances
 The girders shall be fabricated as shown in the processed shop drawings, and shall meet

 6-02.3(25)J  Horizontal Alignment
 The Contractor shall check and record the horizontal alignment (sweep) of each girder at
 the following times:
 1.	 Initial – Upon removal of the girder from the casting bed
 2.	 Shipment – Within 14 days prior to shipment; and
 3.	 Erection – After girder erection and cutting temporary top strands but prior to any
 equalization, welding ties or placement of diaphragms.
 Horizontal alignment of the top and bottom flanges shall be checked and recorded.
 Alternatively, the Contractor may check and record the horizontal alignment of the web near
 mid-height of the girder. Each check shall be made by measuring the maximum offset at
 mid-span relative to a chord that starts and stops at the girder ends. The Contractor shall check
 and record the alignment at a time when the girder is not influenced by temporary differences
 in surface temperature. Records for the initial check (item 1 above) shall be included in the
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-71
 
 6-02
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 Contractor’s prestressed concrete certificate of compliance. Records for all other checks shall
 be submitted as a Type 1 Working Drawing.
 For each check (items 1 to 3 above), the alignment shall not be offset more than ⅛ inch for
 each 10 feet of girder length. Girders not meeting this tolerance for the shipment check (item
 2 above) shall require an analysis of girder lateral stability and stresses in accordance with
 Section 6-02.3(25)L1. The Contractor shall perform this analysis and submit it as a Type 2E
 Working Drawing prior to shipment of the girder. Any girder that exceeds an offset of ⅛ inch
 for each 10 feet of girder length for the erection check (item 3 above) shall be corrected at the
 job site to the ⅛ inch maximum offset per 10 feet of girder length before concrete is placed
 into the diaphragms. The Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working Drawing for any required
 corrective action.
 The maximum distance between the side of a prestressed concrete slab girder, or the edge
 of the top flange of a wide flange deck, wide flange thin deck or deck bulb tee girder, and a
 chord that extends the full length of the girder shall be ± ½ inch after erection (item 3 above).
 6-02.3(25)K  Vertical Deflection
 The Contractor shall check and record the vertical deflection (camber) of each girder at the
 following times:
 1.	 Initial – Upon removal of the girder from the casting bed;
 2.	 Shipment – Within 14 days prior to shipment;
 3.	 Erection – After girder erection and cutting temporary top strands but prior to any
 equalization, welding ties or placement of diaphragms.
 At a minimum, survey data shall be taken at each girder end and at midspan. The
 Contractor shall perform and record each check at a time when the alignment of the girder
 is not influenced by temporary differences in surface temperature. Records for the initial
 check (Item 1 above) shall be included in the Contractor’s Prestressed Concrete Certificate of
 Compliance. Records for all other checks shall be submitted as a Type 1 Working Drawing.
 Girders with vertical deflections not meeting the limit shown in the Plans for the shipment
 check (item 2 above) shall require an analysis of girder lateral stability and stresses in
 accordance with Section 6-02.3(25)L1. The Contractor shall perform this analysis and submit
 it as a Type 2E Working Drawing prior to shipment.
 The “D” dimensions shown in the Plans are computed upper and lower bounds of girder
 vertical deflections at midspan based on a time lapse of 40 and 120 days after release of the
 prestressing strands. Any temporary top strands are assumed to be cut 30 days prior to these
 elapsed times (10 and 90 days after release of the prestressing strands). Any diaphragms
 are assumed to be placed. The “D” dimensions are intended to advise the Contractor of the
 expected range of girder vertical deflection at the time of deck placement. A positive (+) “D”
 dimension indicates upward deflection.
 If the girder vertical deflection measured for the erection check (item 3 above) is not
 between the lower “D” dimension bound shown in the Plans and the upper “D” dimension
 bound shown in the Plans plus ¾ inches, the Engineer may require corrective action. The
 Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working Drawing for any required corrective action.
 6-02.3(25)L Handling and Storage
 During handling and storage, each prestressed concrete girder shall always be kept plumb
 and upright. It shall be lifted only by the lifting embedments (strand lift loops or high-strength
 threaded steel bars) at either end.
 For strand lift loops, only ½-inch diameter or 0.6-inch diameter strand conforming to
 Section 9-07.10 shall be used, and a minimum 2-inch diameter straight pin of a shackle shall
 be used through the loops. Multiple loops shall be held level in the girder during casting in
 a manner that allows each loop to carry its share of the load during lifting. The minimum
 distance from the end of the girder to the centroid of the strand lift loops shall be 3 feet. The
 loops for all prestressed concrete girders, with the exception of prestressed concrete slab
 Page 6-72
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02
 
 girders, shall project a minimum of 1′-6″ from the top of the girder. The loops for prestressed
 concrete slab girders shall project a minimum of 4 inches. Loops shall extend to within
 3 inches clear of the bottom of the girder, terminating with a 9-inch long 90-degree hook.
 Loads on individual loops shall be limited to 12 kips, and all girders shall be picked up at a
 minimum angle of 60 degrees from the top of the girder.
 For high-strength threaded steel bars, a minimum of two 1⅜-inch diameter bars
 conforming to Section 9-07.11 shall be used at each end of the girder. The lifting hardware
 that connects to the bars shall be designed, detailed, and furnished by the Contractor. The
 minimum distance from the end of the girder to the centroid of the lifting bars shall be 3 feet.
 Lifting bars shall extend to within 3 inches clear of the bottom of the girder and shall be
 anchored in the bottom flange with steel plates and nuts. The minimum size of embedded
 plates for lifting bars shall be ½ inch thick by 3 inches square. Lifting forces on the lifting bars
 shall not exceed 58 kips on an individual bar, and shall be within 10 degrees of perpendicular
 to the top of the girder.
 For some girders, straight temporary top flange strands may be specified in the Plans.
 The lifting locations and concrete release strengths shown in the girder schedule in the Plans
 assume that these temporary strands are pretensioned. Alternatively, these temporary strands
 may be post-tensioned provided the strands are stressed on the same day that the permanent
 prestress is released into the girder and the strands are tensioned prior to lifting the girder.
 These temporary strands shall be of the same diameter and shall be tensioned to the same force
 as the permanent strands. The inside diameter of the debonding sleeves shall be large enough
 such that the temporary strands fully retract upon cutting. When temporary top strands are
 specified for spliced prestressed concrete girders, the temporary top strands shall be posttensioned prior to lifting the assembled girder. When the post-tensioned alternative is used,
 the Contractor shall be responsible for properly sizing the anchorage plates, and configuring
 the reinforcement adjacent to the anchorage plates, to prevent bursting or splitting of the
 concrete in the top flange. Temporary strands shall be cut or released in accordance with
 Section 6-02.3(25)N.
 If girders are to be stored, the Contractor shall place them on a stable foundation that will
 keep them in a vertical position. Stored girders shall be supported at the bearing recesses or,
 if there are no recesses, approximately 2 to 3 feet from the girder ends. After post-tensioning,
 spliced prestressed concrete girders shall be supported at points between 2 and 5 feet from
 the girder ends, unless otherwise shown in the Plans. For long-term storage of girders with
 initial horizontal curvature, the Contractor may wedge one side of the bottom flange, tilting the
 girders to control curvature. If the Contractor elects to set girders out of plumb during storage,
 the Contractor shall have the proposed method analyzed by the Contractor’s engineer to ensure
 against damaging the girder.
 6-02.3(25)L1  Girder Lateral Stability and Stresses
 The Contractor shall be responsible for safely lifting, storing, shipping and erecting
 prestressed concrete girders.
 The Contract documents may provide shipping and handling details for girders including
 lifting embedment locations (L), shipping support locations (L1 and L2), minimum shipping
 support rotational spring constants (Kθ), minimum shipping support center-to-center wheel
 spacings (Wcc), vertical deflections and number of temporary top strands. These shipping and
 handling details have been determined in accordance with Section 6-02.3(25)L2.
 The Contractor shall submit a Type 2E Working Drawing analyzing girder lateral stability
 and concrete stresses during lifting, storage, shipping and erection in accordance with
 Section 6-02.3(25)L2 in the following cases:
 1.	 Any of the analysis assumptions listed in Section 6-02.3(25)L2 are invalid.
 Determination of validity shall be made by the Contractor, except that analysis
 assumptions shall be considered invalid if the actual values are outside of the
 provided tolerances.

 2.	 The Contractor intends to alter the shipping and handling details provided in the
 Contract documents.
 3.	 The Contract documents do not provide shipping and handling details.
 6-02.3(25)L2  Lateral Stability and Stress Analysis
 Analysis for girder lateral stability and concrete stresses during lifting, storage, shipping
 and erection shall be in accordance with the PCI Recommended Practice for Lateral Stability
 of Precast, Prestressed Concrete Bridge Girders, First Edition, Publication CB-02-16-E
 and the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications edition identified in the Contract
 documents. The following design criteria shall be met:
 1.	 Factor of Safety against cracking shall be at least 1.0
 2.	 Factor of Safety against failure shall be at least 1.5
 3.	 Factor of Safety against rollover shall be at least 1.5
 4.	 Allowable concrete stresses shall be as specified in Section 6-02.3(25)L3
 The analysis shall address any effects on girder vertical deflection (camber), “A”
 dimensions at centerline of bearings and deck screed cambers (C).
 Shipping and handling details provided in the Contract documents have been determined
 using the following analysis assumptions:
 1.	 Girder dimensions, strand locations and lifting embedment locations are within the
 tolerances specified in Section 6-02.3(25)I
 2.	 Girder horizontal alignment (sweep) is within the tolerance specified in
 Section 6-02.3(25)J
 3.	 Girder vertical deflection (camber) at midspan is less than or equal to the value shown
 in the Plans for shipping
 4.	 Minimum concrete compressive strength at release (f’ci) has been reached before initial
 lifting from casting bed. Minimum concrete compressive strength at 28 days (f’c) has
 been reached before shipping.
 5.	 Height of girder bottom above roadway at shipping supports is less than or equal to
 72 inches
 6.	 Height of shipping support roll center above roadway is 24 inches, ± 2 inches
 7.	 Shipping support longitudinal placement (L1 and L2) tolerance is ± 6 inches
 8.	 Shipping support lateral placement tolerance is ±1 inches
 9.	 Shipping supports provide the minimum shipping support rotational spring constant
 (Kθ) and minimum shipping support center-to-center wheel spacings (Wcc) shown
 in the Plans
 10.	For shipping at highway speeds a ±20 percent dynamic load allowance (impact) is
 included with a typical roadway superelevation of 2 percent
 11.	For turning at slow speeds, no dynamic load allowance (impact) is included with a
 maximum roadway superelevation of 6 percent
 12.	Wind, centrifugal and seismic forces are not considered
 6-02.3(25)L3  Allowable Stresses
 Prestressed concrete girder stresses shall be limited to the following values at all stages of

 Specifications, structural analysis, and any other data used shall also be included.
 The concrete in piers and crossbeams shall reach at least 80 percent of design strength
 before girders are placed on them.
 The Contractor shall hoist girders only by the lifting embedments at the ends, always
 keeping the girders plumb and upright. When the girders are to receive a cast-in-place concrete
 deck, lifting embedments shall be removed after erection to provide a minimum 2½-inch
 clearance to the top of the deck. When the girders are not to receive a cast-in-place concrete
 deck, lifting embedments shall be removed 1-inch below the girder surface and grouted with
 an epoxy grout conforming to Section 9-26.3(1)A.
 The girders shall be braced in accordance with Sections 6-02.3(17)F4 and 6-02.3(17)F5.
 When temporary strands in the top flange are used, they shall be cut after the girders
 are braced and before girder deflections are equalized and the intermediate diaphragms
 are cast.
 Instead of the oak block wedges shown in the Plans, the Contractor may use Douglas fir
 blocks if the grain is vertical. The height of oak block wedges at the girder centerline shall not
 exceed the width.
 The Contractor shall fill all block-out holes with a mortar or grout acceptable to

 shall conform to Sections 6-02.3(2)A and 6-02.3(3).
 The Contractor shall construct supporting falsework in a way that leaves the Superstructure
 free to contract and lift off the falsework during post-tensioning. Forms that will remain
 inside box girders to support the bridge deck shall, by design, resist girder contraction as little
 as possible.
 Before tensioning, the Contractor shall remove all side forms from girders. From this point
 until 48 hours after grouting the tendons, the Contractor shall keep all construction and other
 live loads off the Superstructure and shall keep the falsework supporting the Superstructure
 in place.
 Once the prestressing steel is installed, no welds or welding grounds shall be attached to
 metal forms, structural steel, or reinforcing bars of the structural member.
 The Contractor shall not stress the strands until all concrete has reached a compressive
 strength of at least 4,000 psi (or the strength shown in the Plans). This strength shall be
 measured on concrete test cylinders made of the same concrete cured under the same
 conditions as the cast-in-place unit.
 All post-tensioning shall be completed before sidewalks and barriers are placed.
 6-02.3(26)A  Shop Drawings
 Before casting the structural elements, the Contractor shall submit Type 2E Working
 Drawings of the prestressing system shop drawings.
 These shop drawings shall show complete details of the methods, materials, and equipment
 the Contractor proposes to use in prestressing Work. The shop drawings shall follow the
 design conditions shown in the Plans unless the Engineer permits equally effective variations.
 In addition, the shop drawings shall show:
 1.	 The method and sequence of stressing.
 2.	 Technical data on tendons and steel reinforcement, anchorage devices, anchorage device
 efficiency and acceptance test results and records, anchoring stresses, types of tendon
 conduit, and all other data on prestressing operations.
 3.	 Stress and elongation calculations. Separate stress and elongation calculations shall be
 submitted for each tendon if the difference in tendon elongations exceeds 2 percent.
 4.	 That tendons in the bridge will be arranged to locate their center of gravity as the
 Plans require.
 5.	 Details of additional or modified reinforcing steel required by the stressing system.
 6.	 Procedures and lift-off forces at both ends of the tendon for performing a force
 verification lift-off in the event of discrepancies between measured and calculated
 elongations.
 Couplings or splices will not be permitted in prestressing strands. Couplings or splices in
 bar tendons are subject to the Engineer’s acceptance.
 Friction losses used to calculate forces of the post-tensioning steel shall be based on the
 assumed values used for the design. The assumed anchor set, friction coefficient “μ”, and
 friction wobble coefficient “k” values for design are shown in the Plans. The post-tensioning
 supplier may revise the assumed anchor set value provided all the stress and force limits listed
 in Section 6-02.3(26)G are met.
 The Contractor shall determine all points of interference between the mild steel
 reinforcement and the paths of the post-tensioning tendons. Details to resolve interferences
 shall be submitted with the shop drawings for approval. Where reinforcing bar placement
 conflicts with post-tensioning tendon placement, the tendon profile shown in the Plans shall
 be maintained.

 appropriate Bid items.
 The Contractor shall submit Type 2E Working Drawings consisting of details, certified 
 test reports, and/or supporting calculations, as specified below, which verify the structural
 adequacy of the anchorage devices. This requirement does not apply where the anchorage
 devices have been previously accepted by the Contracting Agency for the same Structure
 configuration. The Contractor shall also submit any necessary changes to the Contract Plans.
 The test report shall specify all pertinent test data.
 Dead ended anchorages will not be permitted. Dead ended anchorages are defined as

 For anchorages with separate wedge plates, n may be taken as the largest distance from
 the outer edge of the wedge plate to the outer edge of the bearing plate. For rectangular
 bearing plates, this distance shall be measured parallel to the edges of the bearing plate.
 If the anchorage has no separate wedge plate, n may be taken as the projection beyond the
 outer perimeter of the group of holes in the direction under consideration.
 For bearing plates that do not meet the slenderness requirement specified above,
 the effective gross bearing area, Ag, shall be taken as:
 1.	 For anchorages with separate wedge plates, the area geometrically similar to the
 wedge plate, with dimensions increased by twice the bearing plate thickness.
 2.	 For anchorages without separate wedge plates, the area geometrically similar to the
 outer perimeter of the wedge holes, with dimensions increased by twice the bearing
 plate thickness.

 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-85
 
 6-02
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 compressive strength shall be verified on field cured cylinders in accordance with the
 FOP for AASHTO T23.
 2.	 The Engineer is satisfied that all strands are free in the ducts.
 Tendons shall be tensioned to the values shown in the Plans (or processed shop drawings)

 shall be accompanied by a certified calibration chart. The Contractor shall provide one copy
 of this chart to the Engineer for use in monitoring. The cylinder extension during calibration
 shall be in approximately the position it will occupy at final jacking force.
 All jacks and gauges must be recalibrated and recertified: (1) at least every 180 days, and
 (2) after any repair or adjustment. The Engineer may use pressure cells to check jacks, gauges,
 and calibration charts before and during tensioning.
 These stress limits apply to all tendons (unless the Plans set other limits):
 1.	 During jacking prior to seating: 90 percent of the yield strength of the steel.
 2.	 At anchorages after seating: 70 percent of the specified tensile strength of the steel.
 3.	 At service limit state after losses: 80 percent of the yield strength of the steel.
 Tendons shall be anchored at initial stresses that will ultimately maintain service loads at
 least as great as the Plans require.
 As stated in Section 6-02.3(26)A, the assumed design friction coefficient “μ” and wobble
 coefficient “k” shown in the Plans shall be used to calculate the stressing elongation. These
 coefficients may be revised by the post-tensioning supplier by the following method provided
 it is accepted by the Engineer:
 Early in the project, the post-tensioning supplier shall test, in place, two representative
 tendons of each size and type shown in the Plans, for the purpose of accurately determining
 the friction loss in a strand and/or bar tendon.
 The test procedure shall consist of stressing the tendon at an anchor assembly with load
 cells at the dead end and jacking end. The test specimen shall be tensioned to 80 percent
 of the specified tensile strength in 10 increments. For each increment, the gauge pressure,
 elongation, and load cell force shall be recorded and the data furnished to the Engineer.
 The theoretical elongations and post-tensioning forces shown on the post-tensioning shop
 drawings shall be re-evaluated by the post-tensioning supplier using the results of the tests
 and corrected as necessary. Revisions to the theoretical elongations shall be submitted as a
 Type 2E Working Drawing. The apparatus and methods used to perform the tests shall be
 proposed by the post-tensioning supplier and be subject to the Engineer’s acceptance.
 All costs associated with testing and evaluating test data shall be included in the unit
 Contract prices for the applicable items of Work involved.
 As tensioning proceeds, the Engineer will be recording the applied load, tendon elongation,
 and anchorage seating values.
 Elongation measurements shall be made at each stressing location to verify that the tendon
 force has been properly achieved. If proper anchor set has been achieved and the measured
 elongation of each strand tendon is within plus or minus 7 percent of the accepted calculated
 elongation, the stressed tendon represented by the elongation measurements is acceptable to
 the Contracting Agency.
 In the event discrepancies greater than 7 percent exist between the measured and calculated
 elongations, the jack calibration shall be checked and stressing records reviewed for any
 evidence of wire or strand breakage. If the jack if properly calibrated and there is no evidence
 of wire or strand breakage, a force verification lift off shall be performed to verify the force
 Page 6-86
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02
 
 in the tendon. The post-tensioning supplier force verification lift off procedure shall provide
 access for visual verification of anchor plate lift off. The jacking equipment shall be capable
 of bridging and lifting off the anchor plate. The tendon is acceptable if the verification lift off
 force is not less than 99 percent of the accepted calculated force nor more than 70 percent
 of the specified tensile strength of the prestressing steel or as accepted by the Engineer.
 Elongation measurements shall be recorded for bar tendons to verify proper tensioning
 only. Acceptance will be by force verification lift off. The bar tendon is acceptable if the
 verification lift off force is not less than 95 percent nor more than 105 percent of the accepted
 calculated force or as accepted by the Engineer.
 When removing the jacks, the Contractor shall relieve stresses gradually before cutting the
 prestressing reinforcement. The prestressing strands shall be cut a minimum of 1 inch from the
 face of the anchorage device.

 Before casting the structural elements, the Contractor shall submit Type 2E Working
 Drawings of the precast panel shop drawings.
 These shop drawings shall show complete details of the methods, materials, and
 equipment the Contractor proposes to use in prestressing/precasting Work. The shop drawings
 shall follow the design conditions shown in the Plans unless the Engineer concurs with equally
 effective variations.
 The shop drawings shall contain as a minimum:
 1.	 Panel shapes (elevations and sections) and dimensions.
 2.	 Finishes and method of constructing the finish (i.e., forming, rolling).
 3.	 Reinforcing, joint, and connection details.
 4.	 Lifting, bracing, and erection inserts.
 5.	 Locations and details of hardware attached to the Structure.
 6.	 Relationship to adjacent material.
 The Contractor may deviate from the processed shop drawings only after submitting a Type
 2E Working Drawing that describes the proposed changes.
 Before completion of the Contract, the Contractor shall provide the Engineer with
 reproducible originals of the shop drawings (and any processed changes). These shall be clear,
 suitable for microfilming, and on permanent sheets that conform with the size requirements
 of Section 6-01.9.
 6-02.3(28)B Casting
 Before casting precast concrete panels, the Contractor and Fabrication Inspector shall have
 possession of a processed set of shop drawings.
 Concrete shall meet the requirements of Section 6-02.3(25)B for annual preapproval of
 the concrete mix design and slump. If SCC is used, the concrete shall conform to Sections
 6-02.3(27)B and 6-02.3(27)C.
 Precast panels shall not be removed from forms until the concrete has attained a minimum
 compressive strength of 70 percent of the specified design strength. A minimum compressive
 strength at other than 70 percent may be used for specific precast panels if the fabricator
 requests and receives acceptance as part of the WSDOT plant certification process.
 Forms may be steel or plywood faced, providing they impart the required finish to
 the concrete.
 6-02.3(28)C Curing
 Concrete in the precast panels shall be cured by either moist or accelerated curing methods.
 The methods to be used shall be preapproved in the WSDOT plant certification process.
 1.	 For moist curing, the surface of the concrete shall be kept covered or moist until such
 time as the compressive strength of the concrete reaches the strength specified for
 stripping. Exposed surfaces shall be kept continually moist by fogging, spraying, or
 covering with moist burlap or cotton mats. Moist curing shall commence as soon as
 possible following completion of surface finishing.
 Page 6-90
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Concrete Structures
 
 6-02
 
 2.	 For accelerated curing, heat shall be applied at a controlled rate following the initial set
 of concrete in combination with an effective method of supplying or retaining moisture.
 Moisture may be applied by a cover of moist burlap, cotton matting, or other effective
 means. Moisture may be retained by covering the panel with an impermeable sheet.
 Heat may be radiant, convection, conducted steam or hot air. Heat the concrete to no more
 than 100°F during the first 2 hours after placing the concrete, and then increase no more than
 25°F per hour to a maximum of 175°F. After curing is complete, cool the concrete no more
 than 25°F per hour to 100°F. Maintain the concrete temperature above 60°F until the panel
 reaches stripping strength.
 Concrete temperature shall be monitored by means of a thermocouple embedded in the
 concrete (linked with a thermometer accurate to plus or minus 5°F). The recording sensor
 (accurate to plus or minus 5°F) shall be arranged and calibrated to continuously record,
 date, and identify concrete temperature throughout the heating cycle. This temperature
 record shall be made available to the Engineer for inspection and become a part of the
 documentation required.
 The Contractor shall never allow dry heat to directly touch exposed panel surfaces at
 any point.
 6-02.3(28)D  Contractors Control Strength
 The concrete strength at stripping and the verification of design strength shall be
 determined by testing cylinders made from the same concrete as the precast panels. The
 cylinders shall be made, handled, and stored in accordance with WSDOT FOP for AASHTO
 T 23 and compression tested in accordance with AASHTO T 22 and AASHTO T 231.
 For accelerated cured panels, concrete strength shall be measured on test cylinders cast
 from the same concrete as that in the panel. These cylinders shall be cured under timetemperature relationships and conditions that simulate those of the panel. If the forms are
 heated by steam or hot air, test cylinders will remain in the coolest zone throughout curing.
 If forms are heated another way, the Contractor shall provide a record of the curing timetemperature relationship for the cylinders for each panel to the Engineer. When two or more
 panels are cast in a continuous line and in a continuous operation, a single set of test cylinders
 may represent all panels provided the Contractor demonstrates uniformity of casting and
 curing to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall mold, cure, and test enough of these cylinders to satisfy Specification
 requirements for measuring concrete strength. The Contractor may use 4- by 8-inch or 6- by
 12-inch cylinders. The Contractor shall let cylinders cool for at least ½ hour before testing for
 release strength.
 Test cylinders may be cured in a moist room or water tank in accordance with FOP for
 AASHTO T 23 after the panel concrete has obtained the required release strength. If, however,
 the Contractor intends to ship the panel prior to standard 28-day strength test, the design
 strength for shipping shall be determined from cylinders placed with the panel and cured under
 the same conditions as the panel. These cylinders may be placed in a noninsulated, moistureproof envelope.
 To measure concrete strength in the precast panel, the Contractor shall randomly select
 two test cylinders and average their compressive strengths. The compressive strength in either
 cylinder shall not fall more than 5 percent below the specified strength. If these two cylinders
 do not pass the test, two other cylinders shall be selected and tested.
 6-02.3(28)E Finishing
 The Contractor shall provide a finish on all relevant concrete surfaces as defined
 in Section 6-02.3(14), unless the Plans or Special Provisions require otherwise.

 tolerances listed in the latest edition of PCI-MNL-116, unless otherwise required by the
 Plans or Special Provisions.
 6-02.3(28)G  Handling and Storage
 The Contractor shall lift all panels only by adequate devices at locations designated
 on the shop drawings. When these devices and locations are not shown in the Plans,
 Section 6-02.3(25)L shall apply.
 Precast panels shall be stored off the ground on foundations suitable to prevent differential
 settlement or twisting of the panels. Stacked panels shall be separated and supported by
 dunnage of uniform thickness capable of supporting the panels. Dunnage shall be arranged in
 vertical planes. The upper panels of a stacked tier shall not be used as storage areas for shorter
 panels unless substantiated by engineering analysis and accepted by the Engineer.
 6-02.3(28)H Shipping
 Precast panels shall not be shipped until the concrete has reached the specified design
 strength, and the Engineer has reviewed the fabrication documentation for Contract
 compliance and stamped the precast concrete panels “Approved for Shipment”. The panels
 shall be supported in such a manner that they will not be damaged by anticipated impact on
 their dead load. Sufficient padding material shall be provided between tie chains and cables
 to prevent chipping or spalling of the concrete.
 6-02.3(28)I Erection
 When the precast panels arrive on the project, the Engineer will confirm that they are
 stamped “Approved for Shipment”. The Engineer will evaluate the present panels for damage
 before accepting them.
 The Contractor shall lift all panels by suitable devices at locations designated on the
 shop drawings. Temporary shoring or bracing shall be provided, if necessary. Panels shall
 be properly aligned and leveled as required by the Plans. Variations between adjacent panels
 shall be leveled out by a method accepted by the Engineer.
 6-02.4 Measurement
 Except as noted below, all classes of concrete shall be measured in place by the cubic yard
 to the neat lines of the Structure as shown in the Plans.
 Exception: concrete in cofferdam seals. Payment for Class 4000W concrete used in these
 seals will be based on the volume calculated using the neatline dimensions for the seal as
 shown in the Contract Plans. For calculated purposes, the horizontal dimension will be
 increased by 1 foot outside the seal neatline perimeter. The vertical dimension is the distance
 between the top and bottom neatline elevations. No payment will be made for any concrete
 that lies outside of these limits to accommodate the Contractor’s cofferdam configuration.
 If the Engineer eliminates the seal in its entirety a Contract change order will be issued.
 Exception: concrete in a separate lump-sum, Superstructure Bid item. Any concrete
 quantities noted under this item in the Special Provisions will not be measured. Although
 the Special Provisions list approximate quantities for the Contractor’s convenience, the
 Contracting Agency does not guarantee the accuracy of these estimates. Before submitting
 a Bid, the Contractor shall have verified the quantities. Even though actual quantities used may
 vary from those listed in the Special Provisions, the Contracting Agency will not adjust the
 lump sum Contract price for Superstructure (except for processed changes).
 The Contracting Agency will pay for no concrete placed below the established elevation
 of the bottom of any footing or seal.
 Lean concrete will be measured by the cubic yard for the quantity of material placed
 in accordance with the producer’s invoice, except that lean concrete included in other Contract
 items will not be measured.

 be punched or subpunched and reamed, drilled or subdrilled and reamed, or formed by
 numerically controlled drilling operations.
 The hole for each high-strength bolt shall be ¹⁄16 inch larger than the nominal diameter of
 the bolt.
 In fabricating any connection, the Contractor may subdrill or subpunch the holes then ream
 full size after assembly or drill holes full size from the solid with all thicknesses of material
 shop assembled in the proper position. If the Contractor chooses not to use either of these
 methods, then the following shall apply:
 1.	 Drill bolt holes in steel splice plates full size using steel templates.
 2.	 Drill bolt holes in the main members of trusses, arches, continuous beam spans, bents,

 6-03.3(27)A Punched Holes
 For punched holes, die diameter shall not exceed punch diameter by more than ¹⁄16 inch.
 Any hole requiring enlargement to admit the bolt shall be reamed. All holes shall be cut clean
 with no torn or ragged edges. The Contracting Agency will reject components having poorly
 matched holes.
 6-03.3(27)B  Reamed and Drilled Holes
 Reaming and drilling shall be done with short taper reamers or twist drills, producing
 cylindrical holes perpendicular to the member. Reamers and drills shall be directed
 mechanically, not hand-held. Connecting parts that require reamed or drilled holes shall
 be assembled and held securely as the holes are formed, then match-marked before
 disassembly. The Contractor shall provide the Engineer a diagram showing these matchmarks. The Contracting Agency will reject components having poorly matched holes.
 Burrs on outside surfaces shall be removed. If the Engineer requires, the Contractor
 shall disassemble parts to remove burrs.
 If templates are used to ream or drill full-size connection holes, the templates shall be
 positioned and angled with extreme care and bolted firmly in place. Templates for reaming
 or drilling matching members or the opposite faces of one member shall be duplicates.
 All splice components shall be match-marked unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 6-03.3(27)C  Numerically Controlled Drilled Connections
 In forming any hole described in Section 6-03.3(27), the fabricator may use numerically
 controlled (N/C) drilling or punching equipment if it meets the requirements in this

 proposed N/C procedures. This outline shall:
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-103
 
 6-03
 
 Steel Structures
 
 1.	 Cover all steps from initial drilling or punching through check assembly;
 2.	 Include the specific members of the Structure to be drilled or punched, hole sizes,
 locations of the common index and other reference points, makeup of check assemblies,
 and all other information needed to describe the process fully.
 N/C holes may be drilled or punched to size through individual pieces, or may be drilled
 through any combination of tightly clamped pieces.
 When the Engineer requires, the Contractor shall demonstrate that the N/C procedure
 consistently produces holes and connections meeting the requirements of these Specifications.
 6-03.3(27)D  Accuracy of Punched, Subpunched, and Subdrilled Holes
 After shop assembly and before reaming, all punched, subpunched, and subdrilled
 holes shall meet the following standard of accuracy. At least 75 percent of the holes in each
 connection shall permit the passage of a cylindrical pin ⅛ inch smaller in diameter than
 nominal hole size. This pin shall pass through at right angles to the face of the member without
 drifting. All holes shall permit passage of a pin ³⁄16 inch smaller in diameter than nominal hole
 size. The Contracting Agency will reject any pieces that fail to meet these standards.
 6-03.3(27)E  Accuracy of Reamed and Drilled Holes
 At least 85 percent of all holes in a connection of reamed or drilled holes shall show no
 offset greater than ¹⁄32 inch between adjacent thicknesses of metal. No hole shall have an offset
 greater than ¹⁄16 inch.
 Centerlines from the connection shall be inscribed on the template and holes shall be
 located from these centerlines. Centerlines shall also be used for accurately locating the
 template relative to the milled or scribed ends of the members.
 Templates shall have hardened steel bushing inserted into each hole. These bushings may
 be omitted, however, if the fabricator satisfies the Engineer (1) that the template will be used
 no more than five times, and (2) that use will produce no template wear.
 Each template shall be at least ½ inch thick. If necessary, thicker templates shall be used
 to prevent buckling and misalignment as holes are formed.
 6-03.3(27)F  Fitting for Bolting
 Before drilling, reaming, and bolting begins, all parts of a member shall be assembled,
 well pinned, and drawn firmly together. If necessary, assembled pieces shall be taken apart to
 permit removal of any burrs or shavings produced as the holes are formed. The member shall
 be free from twists, bends, and other deformation.
 In shop-bolted connections, contacting metal surfaces shall be sandblasted clean
 before assembly. Sandblasting shall meet the requirements of the SSPC Specifications for
 Commercial Blast Cleaning (SSPC-SP 6).
 Any drifting done during assembly shall be no more than enough to bring the parts into
 place. Drifting shall not enlarge the holes or distort the metal.
 6-03.3(28)  Shop Assembly
 6-03.3(28)A  Method of Shop Assembly
 Unless the Contract states otherwise, the Contractor shall choose one of the five shop
 assembly methods described below that will best fit the proposed erection method. The
 Contractor shall obtain the Engineer’s approval of both the shop assembly and the erection
 methods before Work begins.
 1.	 Full Truss or Girder Assembly – Each truss or girder is completely assembled over
 the full length of the Superstructure.
 2.	 Progressive Truss or Girder Assembly – Each truss or girder is assembled in stages
 longitudinally over the full length of the Superstructure.
 a.	 For Trusses – The first stage shall include at least three adjacent truss panels.
 Each truss panel shall include all of the truss members in the space bounded by
 Page 6-104
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Steel Structures
 
 6-03
 
 the top and bottom chords and the horizontal distance between adjacent bottom
 chord Joints.
 b.	 For Girders – The first stage shall include at least three adjacent girder shop
 sections. Shop sections are measured from the end of the girder to the first field
 splice or from field splice to field splice.
 c.	 For Trusses and Girders – After the first stage has been completed, each
 subsequent stage shall be assembled to include: at least one truss panel or girder
 shop section of the previous stage and two or more truss panels or girder shop
 sections added at the advancing end. The previous stages shall be repositioned if
 necessary, and pinned to ensure accurate alignment. For straight sections of bridges
 without skews or tapers, girders in each subsequent stage may be assembled to
 include one girder shop section from the previous stage and one or more girder shop
 sections at the advancing end.
 	 If the bridge is longer than 150 feet, each longitudinal stage shall be at least
 150 feet long, regardless of the length of individual continuous truss panels or
 girder shop sections.
 	 The Contractor may begin the assembly sequence at any point on the bridge and
 proceed in either or both directions from that point.
 	 Unless the Engineer approves otherwise, no assembly shall have less than three truss
 panels or girder shop sections.
 3.	 Full Chord Assembly – The full length of each chord for each truss is assembled with
 geometric angles at the joints. Chord connection bolt holes are drilled/reamed while
 members are assembled. The truss web member connections are drilled/reamed to steel
 templates set by relating geometric angles to the chord lines.
 	 At least one end of each web member shall be milled or scribed at right angles to its
 long axis. The templates at both ends of the member shall be positioned accurately from
 the milled end or scribed line.
 4.	 Progressive Chord Assembly – Adjacent chord sections are assembled in the same
 way as specified for Full Chord Assembly, using the procedure specified for Progressive
 Truss or Girder Assembly.
 5.	 Special Complete Structure Assembly – All structural steel members (Superstructure
 and Substructure, including all secondary members) are assembled at one time.
 6-03.3(28)B  Check of Shop Assembly
 The Contractor shall check each assembly for alignment, accuracy of holes, fit of milled
 joints, and other assembly techniques. Drilling or reaming shall not begin until the Engineer
 has given approval. If the Contractor uses N/C drilling, this approval must be obtained before
 the assembly or stage is dismantled.

 chord splices, column splices, and column bases shall be covered with grease. After erection,
 the steel shall be cleaned and painted as specified.
 All surfaces of iron and steel castings milled to smooth the surface shall be painted with
 the primer called for in the specified paint system.
 While still in the shop, machine-finished surfaces and inaccessible surfaces of rocker or
 pin-type bearings shall receive the full paint system. Surfaces of pins and holes machinefinished to specific tolerances shall not be painted. But as soon as possible and before they
 leave the shop, they shall be coated with grease.
 6-03.3(31) Alignment and Camber
 Before beginning field bolting, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Adjust the Structure to correct grade and alignment,
 2.	 Regulate elevations of panel points (ends of floorbeams), and
 3.	 Delay bolting at compression joints until adjusting the blocking to provide full and
 even bearing over the whole joint.
 On truss spans, a slight excess camber will be permitted as the bottom chords are bolted.
 But camber and relative elevations of panel points shall be correct before the top chord joints,
 top lateral system, and sway braces are bolted.
 6-03.3(31)A Measuring Camber
 The Contractor shall provide the Engineer with a diagram for each truss that shows camber
 at each panel point. This diagram shall display actual measurements taken as the truss is
 being assembled.
 6-03.3(32) Assembling and Bolting
 To begin bolting any field connection or splice, the Contractor shall install and tighten
 to snug tight enough bolts to bring all parts into full contact with each other prior to
 tightening these bolts to the specified minimum tension. “Snug tight” means either the
 tightness reached by (l) a few blows from an impact wrench or (2) the full effort of a person
 using a spud wrench.
 As erection proceeds, all field connections and splices for each member shall be securely
 drift pinned and bolted in accordance with 1 or 2 below before the weight of the member can
 be released or the next member is added. Field erection drawings shall specify pinning and
 bolting requirements that meet or exceed the following minimums:
 1.	 Joints in Normal Structures – Fifty percent of the holes in a single field connection
 and 50 percent of the holes on each side of a single joint in a splice plate shall be
 filled with drift pins and bolts. Thirty percent of the filled holes shall be pinned.
 Seventy percent of the filled holes shall be bolted and tightened to snug tight. Once all
 these bolts are snug tight, each bolt shall be systematically tightened to the specified
 minimum tension. “Systematically tightened” means beginning with bolts in the most
 rigid part, which is usually the center of the joint, and working out to its free edges.
 The fully tensioned bolts shall be located near the middle of a single field connection
 or a single splice plate.
 2.	 Joints in Cantilevered Structures – Seventy-five percent of the holes in a single field
 connection and 75 percent of the holes on each side of a single joint in a splice plate
 shall be filled with drift pins and bolts. Fifty percent of the filled holes shall be pinned.
 Fifty percent of the filled holes shall be bolted and tightened to snug tight. Once all
 these bolts are snug tight, each bolt shall be systematically tightened to the specified
 Page 6-106
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Steel Structures
 
 6-03
 
 minimum tension. The fully tensioned bolts shall be located near the middle of a single
 field connection or a single splice plate.
 Cylindrical erection pins (drift pins) shall be placed throughout each field connection and
 each field joint with the greatest concentration in the outer edges of a splice plate or member
 being bolted. Drift pins shall be double-tapered barrel pins of hardened steel. The diameter of
 the drift pins shall be at least 1/32 inch larger than the diameter of the bolts in the connection
 or the full hole diameter.
 To complete a joint following one of the methods listed above, the Contractor shall fill
 all remaining holes of the field connection or splice plate with bolts and tighten to snug
 tight. Once all of these bolts are snug tight, each bolt shall be systematically tightened to
 the specified minimum tension. After these bolts are tightened to the specified minimum
 tension, the Contractor shall replace the drift pins with bolts tightened to the specified
 minimum tension.
 The Contractor shall complete the joint or connection within ten calendar days of
 installing the first bolt or within a duration approved by the Engineer. Any bolts inserted in
 an incomplete connection, either loose or tightened snug-tight, which exceed the specified
 duration for completing the connection, shall be subject to the following requirements:
 1.	 Three assemblies for each size and length shall be removed from connection(s) that are
 to be tensioned. Rotational capacity tests shall be performed on the removed assemblies
 to demonstrate the assembly has sufficient lubricant to be tensioned satisfactorily.
 2.	 Five assemblies shall be removed from the connection to establish the
 inspection torque.
 3.	 In the case of tension controlled bolts, three assemblies shall be removed and tested in
 accordance with Section 6-03.3(33)A to verify the minimum specified tension can be
 achieved prior to shearing of the spline.
 Assemblies removed for the purpose of rotational capacity testing, determination of the
 inspection torques, or verification of tension controlled bolt performance shall be replaced
 with new bolts at no additional expense to the Contracting Agency. To minimize the number
 of removed assemblies, the Contractor may combine rotational capacity testing and inspection
 torque determination as approved by the Engineer.
 The Contractor may complete a field bolted connection or splice in a continuous operation
 before releasing the mass of the member or adding the next member. The Contractor shall
 utilize drift pins to align the connection. The alignment drift pins shall fill between 15 and
 30 percent of the holes in a single field connection and between 15 and 30 percent of the
 holes on each side of a single joint in a splice plate. Once the alignment drift pins are in
 place, all remaining holes shall be filled with bolts and tightened to snug tight starting from
 near the middle and proceeding toward the outer gage lines. Once all of these bolts are snug
 tight, the Contractor shall systematically tighten all these bolts to the specified minimum
 tension. The Contractor shall then replace the drift pins with bolts. Each of these bolts shall
 be tightened to the specified minimum tension.
 All bolts shall be placed with heads toward the outside and underside of the bridge.
 All high-strength bolts shall be installed and tightened before the falsework is removed.
 The Contractor may erect metal railings as erection proceeds. But railings shall not be
 bolted or adjusted permanently until the falsework is released and the deck placed.
 The Contractor shall not begin painting until the Engineer has inspected and accepted
 field bolting.
 6-03.3(33)  Bolted Connections

 bolts are to be installed in structural carbon steel, as specified in Section 9-06.1.
 2.	 Where the outer face of the bolted parts has a slope greater than 1:20 with respect to
 a plane normal to the bolt axis, a beveled washer shall be used.
 3.	 Washers shall not be stacked unless otherwise specified by the Engineer.
 4.	 It is acceptable to place a washer under the unturned element.
 All galvanized nuts shall be lubricated by the manufacturer with a lubricant containing
 a visible dye so a visual check for the lubricant can be made at the time of field installation.
 Black bolts shall be lubricated by the manufacturer and shall be “oily” to the touch
 when installed.
 After assembly, bolted parts shall fit solidly together. They shall not be separated by
 washers, gaskets, or any other material. Assembled joint surfaces, including those next to

 Final tightening may be done by the Turn-of-Nut Method, the direct-tension indicator
 method, or the twist off-type tension control structural bolt/nut/washer assembly method.
 Preferably, the nut shall be turned tight while the bolt is prevented from rotating. However,
 if required by either turn-of-nut or direct-tension-indicator methods because of bolt entering
 and/or wrench operational clearances, tightening may be done by turning the bolt while the
 nut is prevented from rotating.
 1.	 Turn-of-Nut Method – After all specified bolting conditions are satisfied, and before
 final tightening, the Contractor shall match-mark with crayon or paint the outer face
 of each nut and the protruding part of the bolt. Each bolt shall be final tightened to the
 specified minimum tension by rotating the amount specified in Table 2. To ensure this
 tightening method is followed, the Engineer will (1) observe as the Contractor installs,
 snug tightens, and final tightens all bolts and (2) inspect each match-mark.

 Bolt length measured from underside of head to top of nut.
 Condition 1 – Both faces at right angles to bolt axis.
 Condition 2 – One face at right angle to bolt axis, one face sloped no more than 1:20,
 without bevel washer.
 	 Condition 3 – Both faces sloped no more than 1:20 from right angle to bolt axis,
 without bevel washer.
 	 Nut rotation is relative to the bolt regardless of which element (nut or bolt) is being
 turned. Tolerances permitted plus or minus 30 degrees (1⁄12-turn) for final turns of
 ½-turn or less; plus or minus 45 degrees (⅛-turn) for final turns of ⅔-turn or more.
 	 D = nominal bolt diameter of bolt being tightened.
 	 When bolt length exceeds 12D, the rotation shall be determined by actual tests in which
 a suitable tension device simulates actual conditions.
 2.	 Direct Tension Indicator Method (DTIs) – Shall not be used under the turned
 element. DTIs shall be placed under the bolt head with the protrusions facing the bolt
 head when the nut is turned. DTIs shall be placed under the nut with the protrusions
 facing the nut when the bolt is turned.
 	 Gap refusal shall be measured with a 0.005 inch tapered feeler gage. After all specified
 bolting conditions are satisfied, the snug tightened gaps shall meet Table 3 snug
 tight limits.
 	 Each bolt shall be final-tightened to meet Table 3 final-tighten limits. If the bolt
 is tensioned so that no visible gap in any space remains, the bolt and DTI shall be
 removed and replaced by a new properly tensioned bolt and DTI.
 	 The Contractor shall tension all bolts, inspecting all DTIs with a feeler gage, in the
 presence of the Engineer. DTIs shall be installed by two-person (or more) crews, with
 one individual (1) preventing the element at the DTI from turning and (2) measuring
 the gap of the DTI to determine the proper tension of the bolt.
 	 If a bolt, that has had its DTI brought to full load, loosens during the course of
 bolting the connection, it shall be rejected. Reuse of the bolt and nut are subject to
 the provisions of this section. The used DTI shall not be reinstalled.

 3.	 Twist Off-Type Tension Control Structural Bolt/Nut/Washer Assembly Method
 (Tension Control Bolt Assembly) – Tension control bolt assemblies shall include the
 bolt, nut, and washer(s) packaged and shipped as a single assembly. Unless otherwise
 accepted by the Engineer, tension control bolt assembly components shall not be
 interchanged for testing or installation and shall comply with all provisions of ASTM
 F3125 Grade F1852. If accepted by the Engineer, the tension control bolt assembly
 components may be interchanged within the same component lot for girder web slices
 or other locations where access to both sides of the connection is restricted.
 	 The tension control bolts shall incorporate a design feature intended to either indirectly
 indicate, or to automatically provide, the minimum tension specified in Table 1.
 	 The Contractor shall submit Type 1 Working Drawings of the tension control bolt
 assembly, including bolt capacities; type of bolt, nut, and washer lubricant; method
 of packaging and protection of the lubricated bolt; installation equipment; calibration
 equipment; and installation procedures.
 	 The tension control bolt manufacturer’s installation procedure shall be followed for
 installation of bolts in the verification testing device, in all calibration devices, and
 in all structure connections.
 	 In some cases, proper tensioning of the bolts may require more than one cycle of
 systematic partial tightening prior to final yield or fracture of the tension control
 element of each bolt. If yield or fracture of the tension control element of a bolt
 occurs prior to the final tightening cycle, that bolt shall be replaced with a new one.
 	 Additional field verification testing shall be performed as requested by the Engineer.
 	 All bolts and connecting hardware shall be stored and handled in a manner to prevent
 corrosion and loss of lubricant. Bolts that are installed without the same lubricant
 coating as tested under the verification test will be rejected, and they shall be removed
 from the joint and be replaced with new lubricated bolts at no additional cost to the
 Contracting Agency.
 ASTM F3125 Grade A490 bolts, galvanized ASTM F3125 Grade A325 bolts, and ASTM
 F3125 Grade F1852 tension control bolt assemblies shall not be reused. Black ASTM F3125
 Grade A325 bolts may be reused once if accepted by the Engineer. All bolts to be reused shall
 have their threads inspected for distortion by reinstalling the used nut on the bolt and turning
 the nut for the full length of the bolt threads by hand. Bolts to be reused shall be relubricated
 in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation. Used bolts shall be subject to a
 rotational capacity test as specified in Section 6-03.3(33)A Pre-Erection Testing. Touching
 up or retightening bolts previously tightened by the Turn-of-Nut Method, which may have
 been loosened by the tightening of adjacent bolts shall not be considered as reuse, provided

 Steel Structures
 
 6-03
 
 the snugging up continues from the initial position and does not require greater rotation,
 including the tolerance, than that required by Table 2.
 6-03.3(33)A  Pre-Erection Testing
 High-strength bolt assemblies (bolt, nut, direct tension indicator, and washer), both black
 and galvanized, shall be subjected to a field rotational capacity test, as outlined below, prior
 to any permanent fastener installation. For field installations, the rotational capacity test
 shall be conducted at the jobsite. Each combination of bolt production lot, nut production
 lot, washer production lot, and direct tension indicator production lot shall be tested as an
 assembly, except tension control bolt assemblies, which shall be tested as supplied by the
 manufacturer. Each rotational capacity test shall include three assemblies. Once an assembly
 passes the rotational capacity test, it is accepted for use for the remainder of the project unless
 the Engineer deems further testing is necessary. All tests shall be performed in a bolt tension
 calibrator by the Contractor in the presence of the Engineer. High-strength bolt assemblies
 used in this test shall not be reused. The bolt assemblies shall meet the following requirements
 after being pretensioned to 15 percent of the minimum bolt tension in Table 1. The assembly
 shall be considered as nonconforming if the assembly fails to pass any one of the following
 specified requirements:
 1.	 The measured torque to produce the minimum bolt tension shall not exceed the
 maximum allowed torque value obtained by the following equation:
 Torque = 0.25 PD
 Where:
 Torque	 =	 Calculated Torque (foot-pounds)
 P	
 =	 Measured Bolt Tension (pounds)
 D	
 =	 Normal Bolt Diameter (feet)
 2.	 After placing the assembly through two cycles of the required number of turns, where
 turns are measured from the 15 percent pretension condition, as indicated in Table 2,
 a.	 The maximum recorded tension after the two turns shall be equal to or greater than
 1.15 times the minimum bolt tension listed in Table 1.
 b.	 Each assembly shall be successfully installed to the specified number of turns.
 c.	 The fastener components in the assembly shall not exhibit shear failure or stripping
 of the threads as determined by visual examination of bolt and nut threads
 following removal.
 d.	 The bolts in the assembly shall not exhibit torsional or torsional/tension failure.
 3.	 If any specimen fails, the assembly will be rejected. Elongation of the bolt between the
 bolt head and the nut is not considered to be a failure.
 Bolts that are too short to test in the bolt tension calibrator shall be tested in a steel joint.
 The Contractor shall (1) install the high-strength bolt assemblies (bolt, nut, direct tension
 indicator, and washer) in a steel joint of the proper thickness; (2) tighten to the snug tight
 condition; (3) match-mark the outer face of each nut and the protruding part of the bolt with
 crayon or paint; (4) rotate to the requirements of Table 2; and (5) record the torque that is
 required to achieve the required amount of rotation. The assembly shall be considered as
 nonconforming if the assembly fails to pass any one of the following specified requirements:
 1.	 The recorded torque to produce the minimum rotation shall not exceed the maximum
 allowed torque value obtained by the following equation:
 Torque = 0.25 PD
 Where:
 Torque	 =	 Calculated Maximum Allowed Torque (foot-pounds)
 P	
 =	 Specified Bolt Tension per Table 1, multiplied by a factor of
 1.15 (pounds)
 D	
 =	 Normal Bolt Diameter (feet)

 2.	 After placing the assembly through two cycles of the required number of turns, where
 turns are measured from the snug tight condition specified in Section 6-03.3(32):
 a.	 Each assembly shall be successfully installed to the specified number of turns.
 b.	 The fastener components in the assembly shall not exhibit shear failure or stripping
 of the threads as determined by visual examination of bolt and nut threads
 following removal.
 c.	 The bolts in the assembly shall not exhibit torsional or torsional/tension failure.
 3.	 If any specimen fails, the assembly will be rejected. Elongation of the bolt between
 the bolt head and the nut is not considered to be a failure.
 The Contractor shall submit Type 1 Working Drawings consisting of the manufacturer’s
 detailed procedure for pre-erection (rotational capacity) testing of tension control
 bolt assemblies.
 Three DTIs, per lot, shall be tested in a bolt tension calibrator. The bolts shall be tensioned
 to 105 percent of the tension shown in Table 1. If all of the DTI protrusions are completely
 crushed (all five openings with zero gap), this lot of DTIs is rejected.
 Three twist off-type tension controlled bolt assemblies, per assembly lot, shall be tested in
 a bolt tension calibrator. The bolts shall first be tensioned to a snug tight condition. Tensioning
 shall then be completed by tightening the assembly nut in a continuous operation using a
 spline drive installation tool until the spline shears from the bolt. The bolt assembly tension
 shall meet the requirements of Table 1. If any specimen fails, the assembly lot is rejected.
 6-03.3(33)B  Bolting Inspection
 The Contractor, in the presence of the Engineer, shall inspect the tightened bolt using a
 calibrated inspection torque wrench, regardless of bolting method. The Contractor shall supply
 the inspection torque wrench. Inspection shall be performed within seven calendar days from
 the completion of each bolted connection or as specified by the Engineer.
 If the bolts to be installed are not long enough to fit in the bolt tension calibrator, five bolts
 of the same grade, size, and condition as those under inspection shall be tested using DirectTension-Indicators (DTIs) to measure bolt tension. This tension measurement test shall be
 done at least once each inspection day. The Contractor shall supply the necessary DTIs. The
 DTI shall be placed under the bolt head. A washer shall be placed under the nut, which shall
 be the element turned during the performance of this tension measurement test. Each bolt
 shall be tightened by any convenient means to the specified minimum tension as indicated
 by the DTI. The inspecting wrench shall then be applied to the tightened bolt to determine
 the torque required to turn the nut 5 degrees (approximately 1 inch at a 12-inch radius) in the
 tightening direction. The job inspection torque shall be taken as the average of three values
 thus determined after rejecting the high and low values.
 Five representative bolts/nuts/washers and DTIs if used (provided by the Contractor) of
 the same grade, size, and condition as those under inspection shall be placed individually in a
 bolt tension calibrator to measure bolt tension. This calibration operation shall be done at least
 once each inspection day. There shall be a washer under the part turned in tightening each bolt
 if washers are used on the Structure. In the bolt tension calibrator, each bolt shall be tightened
 by any convenient means to the specified tension. The inspection torque wrench shall then be
 applied to the tightened bolt to determine the torque required to turn the nut or head 5 degrees
 (approximately 1 inch at a 12-inch radius) in the tightening direction. The job-inspection
 torque shall be taken as the average of three values thus determined after rejecting the high
 and low values.
 Ten percent (at least two), or as specified by the Engineer, of the tightened bolts on the
 Structure represented by the test bolts shall be selected at random in each connection. The
 job-inspection torque shall then be applied to each with the inspecting wrench turned in the
 tightening direction, with no restraint applied to the opposite end of the bolt. If this torque
 turns no bolt head or nut, the Contracting Agency will accept the connection as being properly
 tightened. If the torque turns one or more bolt heads or nuts, the job-inspection torque shall
 Page 6-112
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Steel Structures
 
 6-03
 
 then be applied to all bolts in the connection. Except for tension control bolt assemblies and
 DTIs with zero gap at all protrusion spaces, any bolt whose head or nut turns at this stage
 shall be tightened and reinspected. Any tension control bolt assemblies or DTIs that have
 zero gap at all protrusion spaces shall be replaced if the head or nut turns at this stage.
 The Contractor shall submit Type 1 Working Drawings consisting of the manufacturer’s
 detailed procedure for routine observation to ensure proper use of the tension control
 bolt assemblies.
 6-03.3(34) Adjusting Pin Nuts
 All pin nuts shall be tightened thoroughly. The pins shall be placed so that members bear
 fully and evenly on the nuts. The pins shall have enough thread to allow burring after the nuts
 are tightened.
 6-03.3(35) Setting Anchor Bolts
 Anchor bolts shall be set in masonry as required in Section 6-02.3(18). Anchor bolts shall
 be grouted in after the shoes, masonry plates, and keeper plates have been set and the span or
 series of continuous spans are completely erected and adjusted to line and camber.
 6-03.3(36)  Setting and Grouting Masonry Plates
 The following procedure applies to masonry plates for all steel spans, including shoes,
 keeper plates, and turning racks on movable bridges.
 To set masonry plates, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Set masonry plates on the anchor bolts;
 2.	 Place steel shims under the masonry plates to position pin centers or bearings to line
 and grade and in relationship to each other. Steel shims shall be the size and be placed
 at the locations shown in the Plans;
 3.	 Level the bases of all masonry plates;
 4.	 Draw anchor bolt nuts down tight;
 5.	 Recheck pin centers or bearings for alignment; and
 6.	 Leave at least ¾ inch of space under each masonry plate for grout.
 After the masonry plates have been set and the span or series of continuous spans are
 completely erected and swung free, the space between the top of the masonry and the top of
 the concrete bearing seat shall be filled with grout. Main masonry plates for cantilever spans
 shall be set and grouted in before any steel Work is erected.
 Grout shall conform to Section 9-20.3(2) and placement shall be as required in
 Section 6-02.3(20).
 6-03.3(37) Setting Steel Bridge Bearings
 Masonry plates, shoes, and keeper plates of expansion bearings shall be set and adjusted to
 center at a normal temperature of 64ºF. Adjustment for an inaccuracy in fabricated length shall
 be made after dead-load camber is out.
 6-03.3(38)  Placing Superstructure
 The concrete in piers and crossbeams shall reach at least 80 percent of design strength
 before girders are placed on them.
 6-03.3(39)  Swinging the Span
 Forms weighing less than 5 pounds per square foot of bridge deck area and uniformly
 distributed along the steel spans may be placed before the spans swing free on their supports.
 Steel reinforcing bars or concrete bridge deck shall not be placed on steel spans until the
 spans swing free on their supports and elevations are recorded. No simple span or any series
 of continuous spans will be considered as swinging free until all temporary supports have
 been released. Reinforcing steel or concrete bridge decks shall not be placed on any simple
 or continuous span steel girder bridge until all its spans are adjusted and its masonry plates,
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 Steel Structures
 
 shoes, and keeper plates grouted. For this specification, the structure shall be considered as
 continuous across hinged joints.
 After the falsework is released (spans swung free), the masonry plates, shoes, and keeper
 plates are grouted, and before any load is applied, the Contractor (or the Engineer if the
 Contracting Agency is responsible for surveying) shall survey elevations at the tenth points
 along the centerline on top of all girders and floorbeams. The Contractor shall calculate the
 theoretical top of girder or floorbeam flange elevations and compare the calculated elevations
 to the surveyed elevations. The theoretical pad or haunch depth shown in the Plans shall be
 increased or decreased by the difference between the theoretical and surveyed top of girder or
 floorbeam elevations. The soffit (deck formwork) shall be set based on the Plan bridge deck
 thickness and the adjusted pad or haunch depth.
 The Contractor shall submit all survey data and calculations to the Engineer for review ten
 working days prior to placing any load, beyond the maximum five pounds per square foot of
 form weight allowed, on the Structure.
 6-03.3(40)  Draining Pockets
 The Contractor shall provide enough holes to drain all water from pockets in trusses,
 girders, and other members. Unless shown on approved shop plans, drain holes shall not be
 drilled without the written approval of the Engineer.
 All costs related to providing drain holes shall be included in the unit Contract prices for
 structural or cast steel.
 6-03.3(41) Vacant
 6-03.3(42)  Surface Condition
 As the Structure is erected, the Contractor shall keep all steel surfaces clean and free from
 dirt, concrete, mortar, oil, paint, grease, and other stain-producing foreign matter. Any surfaces
 that become stained shall be cleaned as follows:
 Painted steel surfaces shall be cleaned by methods required for the type of staining. The
 Contract shall submit a Type 1 Working Drawing of the cleaning method.
 Unpainted steel surfaces shall be cleaned by sandblasting. Sandblasting to remove
 stains on publicly visible surfaces shall be done to the extent that, in the Engineers opinion,
 the uniform weathering characteristics of the Structure are preserved.
 6-03.3(43)  Castings, Steel Forgings, and Miscellaneous Metals
 Castings, steel forgings, and miscellaneous metals shall be built to comply with
 Section 9-06.
 6-03.3(43)A  Shop Construction, Castings, Steel Forgings, and Miscellaneous Metals
 This section’s requirements for structural steel (including painting requirements) shall also
 apply to castings, steel forgings, and miscellaneous metals.
 Castings shall be:
 1.	 True to pattern in form and dimensions;
 2.	 Free from pouring faults, sponginess, cracks, blow holes, and other defects in places
 that would affect strength, appearance, or value;
 3.	 Clean and uniform in appearance;
 4.	 Filleted boldly at angles; and
 5.	 Formed with sharp and perfect arises.
 Iron and steel castings and forgings shall be annealed before any machining, unless the

 6-03.4 Measurement
 Cast or forged metal (kind) shown in the Plans will be measured by the pound or will
 be paid for on a lump sum basis, whichever is shown on the Proposal.
 6-03.5 Payment
 Payment will be made for each of the following Bid items that are included in the Proposal:
 “Structural Carbon Steel”, lump sum.
 The lump sum Contract price for “Structural Carbon Steel” shall be full pay for all costs
 in connection with furnishing all materials, labor, tools, and equipment necessary for the
 manufacture, fabrication, transportation, erection, and painting of all structural carbon steel
 used in the completed Structure, including the providing of such other protective coatings
 or treatment as may be shown in the Plans or specified in the Special Provisions.
 For steel Structures, the estimated weight of the structural carbon steel in the project will
 be shown in the Plans or in the Special Provisions. In the event any change in the Plans is
 made which will affect the weight of materials to be furnished, payment for the additional
 structural carbon steel required as a result of the change in the Plans will be made at a unit
 price per pound obtained by dividing the Contractor’s lump sum Bid for structural carbon
 steel by the total estimated weight of structural carbon steel shown in the Plans or in the
 Special Provisions.
 Reductions in weight due to a change in the Plans will be made at the same rate as
 determined above and will be deducted from payments due the Contractor.
 Prospective Bidders shall verify the estimated weight of structural carbon steel before
 submitting a Bid. No adjustment other than for approved changes shall be made in the lump
 sum Bid even though the actual weight may deviate from the stated estimated weight.
 For concrete and timber Structures, where the structural carbon steel is a minor item, no
 estimated weight will be given for the structural carbon steel. In the event any change in the
 Plans is necessary which will affect the weight of material to be furnished for this type of
 Structure, the payment or reduction for the revision in quantity will be made at a unit price per
 pound obtained by dividing the Contractor’s lump sum Bid for the structural carbon steel by
 the calculated weight of the original material. The calculated weight will be established by the
 Engineer and will be based on an estimated weight of 490 pounds per cubic foot for steel.
 Any change in the Plans which affects the weight of material to be furnished as provided
 herein will be subject to the provisions of Section 1-04.4.
 “Structural Low Alloy Steel”, lump sum.
 “Structural High Strength Steel”, lump sum.
 Payment for “Structural Low Alloy Steel” and “Structural High Strength Steel” shall be
 made on the same lump sum basis as specified for structural carbon steel.
 “(Cast or Forged) Steel”, lump sum or per pound.
 “(Cast, Malleable, or Ductile) Iron”, lump sum or per pound.
 “Cast Bronze”, lump sum or per pound.
 Payment for “(Cast or Forged) Steel”, “(Cast, Malleable or Ductile) Iron”, and
 “Cast Bronze” will be made at the lump sum or per pound Contract prices as included
 in the Proposal.
 For the purpose of payment, such minor items as bearing plates, pedestals, forged steel
 pins, anchor bolts, field bolts, shear connectors, etc., unless otherwise provided, shall be
 considered as structural carbon steel even though made of other materials.
 When no Bid item is included in the Proposal and payment is not otherwise provided,
 the castings, forgings, miscellaneous metal, and painting shall be considered as incidental to
 the construction, and all costs therefore shall be included in the unit Contract prices for the
 payment items involved and shown.

 Mudsills shall be of pressure-treated timber, firmly and evenly bedded to solid bearing,
 and tamped in place.
 Concrete pedestals that support framed bents shall be finished so that sills will bear evenly
 on them. To anchor the sills, the Contractor shall set dowels in the pedestals when they are
 cast. The dowels shall be at least ¾ inch in diameter and protrude at least 6 inches above
 the pedestal tops. Pedestal concrete shall comply with Section 6-02.
 Each sill shall rest squarely on mudsills, piles, or pedestals. It shall be drift-bolted
 to mudsills or piles with ¾-inch diameter or larger bolts that extend at least 6 inches into
 them. When possible, the Contractor shall remove any earth touching the sills to permit free
 air circulation around them.
 Each post shall be fastened to sills with ¾-inch diameter or larger dowels that extend at
 least 6 inches into the post.
 6-04.3(10) Caps
 Timber caps shall rest uniformly across the tops of posts or piles and cap ends shall be
 aligned evenly. Each cap shall be fastened with a drift bolt ¾ inch in diameter or larger that
 penetrates the post or pile at least 9 inches. The bolt shall be approximately in the center of
 the pile or post.
 If the Roadway grade exceeds 2 percent, each cap shall be beveled to match the grade.

 When pile bents are taller than 10 feet, each shall be braced transversely and every other
 pair shall be braced longitudinally. No single cross-bracing shall brace more than 20 feet of
 vertical distance on the piles. If the vertical distance exceeds 20 feet, more than one crossbracing shall be used. Each brace end shall be bolted through the pile, post, or cap with a bolt
 ¾ inch in diameter or larger. Other brace/pile intersections shall be bolted or boat-spiked as the
 Plans require. Cross-bracing shall lap both upper or lower caps and shall be bolted to the caps
 or sills at each end.
 6-04.3(12) Stringers
 All stringers that carry laminated decking or vary more than ⅛ inch in depth shall be sized
 to an even depth at bearing points. Outside stringers shall be butt jointed and spliced. Interior
 stringers shall be lapped so that each rests over the full width of the cap or floorbeam at each
 end. Except on sharp horizontal and vertical curves, stringers may cover two spans. In this
 case, joints shall be staggered and the stringers either toenailed or drift bolted as the Plans
 require. To permit air circulation on untreated timber Structures, the ends of lapped stringers
 shall be separated. This separation shall be done by fastening across the lapping face a 1 by
 3-inch wood strip cut 2 inches shorter than the depth of the stringer.
 Any cross-bridging or solid bridging shall be neatly and accurately framed, then securely
 toenailed at each end (with two nails for cross-bridging and four nails for solid bridging).

 Wheel guards and railings shall be built as Section 6-06.3(1) requires.
 6-04.3(14) Single-Plank Floors
 Single-plank floors shall be made of a single thickness of plank on stringers or joists.
 Unless the Engineer directs otherwise, the planks shall be:
 1.	 Laid heart side down with tight joints,
 2.	 Spiked to each joist or nailing strip with at least two spikes that are at least 4 inches
 longer than the plank thickness,
 3.	 Spiked at least 2½ inches from the edges,
 4.	 Cut off on a straight line parallel to the centerline of the Roadway,
 5.	 Arranged so that no adjacent planks vary in thickness by no more than 1⁄16 inch, and
 6.	 Surfaced on one side and one edge (S1S1E) unless otherwise specified.
 6-04.3(15) Laminated Floors
 The strips shall be placed on edge and shall be drawn down tightly against the stringer or
 nailing strip and the adjacent strip and, while held in place, shall be spiked. Each strip shall
 extend the full width of the deck, unless some other arrangement is shown in the Plans or
 permitted by the Engineer.
 Each strip shall be spiked to the adjacent strip at intervals of not more than 2 feet, the

 6-05.3  Construction Requirements
 6-05.3(1)  Piling Terms
 Concrete Piles – Concrete piling may be precast or precast-prestressed concrete, or steel
 casings driven to the ultimate bearing resistance called for in the Contract which are filled with
 concrete (cast-in-place) after driving.
 Steel Piles – Steel piles may be open-ended or closed-ended pipe piles, or H-piles.
 Overdriving – Over-driving of piles occurs when the ultimate bearing resistance
 calculated from the equation in Section 6-05.3(12), or the wave equation driving criteria
 if applicable, exceeds the ultimate bearing resistance required in the Contract in order to reach
 the minimum tip elevation specified in the Contract, or as required by the Engineer.
 Maximum Driving Resistance – The maximum driving resistance is either the pile
 ultimate bearing resistance, or ultimate bearing resistance plus overdriving to reach minimum
 tip elevation as specified in the Contract, whichever is greater.
 Wave Equation Analysis – Wave equation analysis is an analysis performed using the
 wave equation analysis program (WEAP) with a version dated 1987 or later. The wave
 equation may be used as specified herein to verify the Contractor’s proposed pile driving
 system. The pile driving system includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the pile, the
 hammer, the helmet, and any cushion. The wave equation may also be used by the Engineer
 to determine pile driving criteria as may be required in the Contract.
 Ultimate Bearing Resistance – Ultimate bearing resistance refers to the vertical
 load carrying resistance (in units of force) of a pile as determined by the equation in
 Section 6-05.3(12), the wave equation analysis, pile driving analyzer and CAPWAP, static load
 test, or any other means as may be required by the Contract, or the Engineer.
 Allowable Bearing Resistance – Allowable bearing resistance is the ultimate bearing
 resistance divided by a factor of safety. The Contract may state the factor of safety to be used
 in calculating the allowable bearing resistance from the ultimate bearing resistance. In the
 absence of a specified factor of safety, a value of three shall be used.
 Rated Hammer Energy – The rated energy represents the theoretical maximum amount
 of gross energy that a pile driving hammer can generate. The rated energy of a pile driving
 hammer will be stated in the hammer manufacturer’s catalog or Specifications for that pile
 driving hammer.
 Developed Hammer Energy – The developed hammer energy is the actual amount of
 gross energy produced by the hammer for a given blow. This value will never exceed the rated
 hammer energy. The developed energy may be calculated as the ram weight times the drop
 Page 6-120
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Piling
 
 6-05
 
 (or stroke) for drop, single acting hydraulic, single acting air/steam, and open-ended diesel
 hammers. For double acting hydraulic and air/steam hammers, the developed hammer energy
 shall be calculated from ram impact velocity measurements or other means approved by the
 Engineer. For closed-ended diesel hammers, the developed energy shall be calculated from the
 measured bounce chamber pressure for a given blow. Hammer manufacturer calibration data
 may be used to correlate bounce chamber pressure to developed hammer energy. For a single
 acting diesel hammer the developed energy is determined using the blows per minute.
 Transferred Hammer Energy – The transferred hammer energy is the amount of energy
 transferred to the pile for a given blow. This value will never exceed the developed hammer
 energy. Factors that cause transferred hammer energy to be lower than the developed hammer
 energy include friction during the ram down stroke, energy retained in the ram and helmet
 during rebound, and other impact losses. The transferred energy can only be measured directly
 by use of sensors attached to the pile. A pile driving analyzer (PDA) may be used to measure
 transferred energy.
 Pile Driving Analyzer – A pile driving analyzer (PDA) is a device which can measure the
 transferred energy of a pile driving system, the compressive and tensile stresses induced in the
 pile due to driving, the bending stresses induced by hammer misalignment with the pile, and
 estimate the ultimate resistance of a pile at a given blow.
 Pile Driving System – The pile driving system includes, but is not necessarily limited to,
 the hammer, leads, helmet or cap, cushion and pile.
 Helmet – The helmet, also termed the cap, drive cap, or driving head, is used to transmit
 impact forces from the hammer ram to the pile top as uniformly as possible across the pile
 top such that the impact force of the ram is transmitted axially to the pile. The term helmet
 can refer to the complete impact force transfer system, which includes the anvil or striker
 plate, hammer cushion and cushion block, and a pile cushion if used, or just the single piece
 unit into which these other components (anvil, hammer cushion, etc.) fit. The helmet does not
 include a follower, if one is used. For hydraulic hammers, the helmet is sometimes referred to
 as the anvil.
 Hammer Cushion – The hammer cushion is a disk of material placed on top of the helmet
 but below the anvil or striker plate to relieve impact shock, thus protecting the hammer and
 the pile.
 Pile Cushion – The pile cushion is a disk of material placed between the helmet and the
 pile top to relieve impact shock, primarily to protect the pile.
 Follower – A follower is a structural member placed between the hammer assembly, which
 includes the helmet, and the pile top when the pile head is below the reach of the hammer.
 Pile Driving Refusal – Pile driving refusal is defined as 15 blows per inch for the last
 4 inches of driving. This is the maximum blow count allowed during overdriving.
 Minimum Tip Elevation – The minimum tip elevation is the elevation to which the pile
 tip shall be driven. Driving deeper in order to obtain the required ultimate bearing resistance
 may be required.
 6-05.3(2) Ordering Piling
 The Contractor shall order all piling (except cast-in-place concrete and steel piles) from
 an itemized list the Engineer will provide. This list, showing the number and lengths of piles
 required, will be based on test-pile driving (or other) data. The list will show lengths below the
 cutoff point. The Contractor shall supply (and bear the cost of supplying) any additional length
 required for handling or driving.
 The Contractor shall assume all responsibility for buying more or longer piles than those
 shown on the list provided by the Engineer. All piles purchased on the basis of the Engineer’s
 list but not used in the finished Structure shall become the property of the Contracting Agency.
 The Contractor shall deliver these as the Engineer directs. The Contractor shall keep pile
 cutoffs that are 8 feet or under and any longer ones the Contracting Agency does not require.

 6-05
 
 Piling
 
 When ordering steel casings for cast-in-place concrete and steel piling, the Contractor shall
 base lengths on information derived from driving test piles and from subsurface data. The
 Contractor shall also select the wall thickness of steel piles or steel casings for cast-in-place
 piles which will be necessary to prevent damage during driving and handling. The selection of
 wall thickness for steel piles or steel casings shall also consider the effects of lateral pressures
 from the soil or due to driving of adjacent piles. Steel piles and steel casings must be strong
 and rigid enough to resist these pressures without deforming or distorting. The Contractor shall
 select the wall thickness based on information derived from test piles, subsurface data and/or
 wave equation analysis. Wave equation analysis is required prior to ordering piling for piles
 with specified ultimate bearing resistances of 300 tons or greater. If a wave equation analysis
 is performed, the Contractor shall base the selection of wall thickness on the maximum driving
 resistance identified in the Contract to reach the minimum tip elevation, if the maximum
 driving resistance is greater than the specified ultimate bearing resistance and if a minimum
 tip elevation is specified. The wave equation analysis shall be submitted by the Contractor as
 required in Section 6-05.3(9)A. The Engineer will not supply any list for piling of these types.
 6-05.3(3)  Manufacture of Precast Concrete Piling
 Precast concrete piles shall consist of concrete sections reinforced to withstand handling
 and driving stresses. These may be reinforced with deformed steel bars or prestressed with
 steel strands. The Plans show dimensions and details. If the Plans require piles with square
 cross-sections, the corners shall be chamfered 1 inch.
 Precast or prestressed piles shall meet the requirements of the Standard Plans.
 Temporary stress in the prestressing reinforcement of prestressed piles (before loss from
 creep and shrinkage) shall be 75 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength. (For short
 periods during manufacture, the reinforcement may be overstressed to 80 percent of ultimate
 tensile strength if stress after transfer to concrete does not exceed 75 percent of that strength.)
 Prestressed concrete piles shall have a final (effective) prestress of at least 1,000 psi.
 Unless the Engineer approves splices, all piles shall be full length.
 The Contracting Agency intends to perform Quality Assurance Inspection. By its
 inspection, the Contracting Agency intends only to facilitate the Work and verify the quality of
 that Work. This inspection shall not relieve the Contractor of any responsibility for identifying
 and replacing defective material and workmanship.
 6-05.3(3)A  Casting and Stressing
 Reinforcing bars, hoops, shoes, etc., shall be placed as shown in the Contract, with all parts
 securely tied together and placed to the specified spacing. No concrete shall be cast until all
 reinforcement is in place in the forms.
 The Contractor shall perform quality control inspection. The manufacturing plant for
 precast concrete piling shall be certified by the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute’s Plan
 Certification Program for the type of precast piling to be produced and shall be approved
 by WSDOT as a Certified Precast Concrete Fabricator prior to start of production. WSDOT
 Certification will be established or renewed during the annual precast plant review and
 approval process.
 Prior to the start of production of the piling, the Contractor shall advise the Engineer of the
 production schedule. The Contractor shall give the Inspector safe and free access to the Work.
 If the Inspector observes any nonspecification Work or unacceptable quality control practices,
 the Inspector will advise the plant manager. If the corrective action is not acceptable to the
 Engineer, the piling(s) will be subject to rejection by the Engineer.
 In casting concrete piles, the Contractor shall:
 1.	 Cast them either vertically or horizontally;
 2.	 Use metal forms (unless the Engineer approves otherwise) with smooth joints and
 inside surfaces that can be reached for cleaning after each use;
 3.	 Brace and stiffen the forms to prevent distortion;

 4.	 Place concrete continuously in each pile, guarding against horizontal or diagonal
 cleavage planes;
 5.	 Ensure that the reinforcement is properly embedded;
 6.	 Use internal vibration around the reinforcement during concrete placement to prevent
 rock pockets from forming; and
 7.	 Cast test cylinders with each set of piles as concrete is placed.
 Forms shall be metal and shall be braced and stiffened to retain their shape under pressure
 of wet concrete. Forms shall have smooth joints and inside surfaces easy to reach and clean
 after each use. That part of a form which will shape the end surface of the pile shall be a true
 plane at right angles to the pile axis.
 Each pile shall contain a cage of nonprestressed reinforcing steel. The Contractor shall
 follow the Contract in the size and location of this cage, and shall secure it in position during
 concrete placement. Spiral steel reinforcing shall be covered by at least 1½ inches of concrete
 measured from the outside pile surface.
 Prestressing steel shall be tensioned as required in Section 6-02.3(25)C.
 The Plans specify tensioning stress for strands or wires. Tension shall be measured by jack
 pressure as described in Section 6-02.3(25)C. Mechanical locks or anchors shall temporarily
 maintain cable tension. All jacks shall have hydraulic pressure gauges (accurately calibrated
 and accompanied by a certified calibration curve no more than 180 days old) that will permit
 stress calculations at all times.
 All tensioned piles shall be pretensioned. Post-tensioning is not allowed.
 The Contractor shall not stress any pile until test cylinders made with it reach
 a compressive strength of at least 3,300 psi.
 6-05.3(3)B Finishing
 As soon as the forms for precast concrete piles are removed, the Contractor shall fill all
 holes and irregularities with mortar conforming to Section 9-20.4(2) mixed at a 1:2 cement/
 aggregate ratio. That part of any pile that will be underground or below the low-water line
 and all parts of any pile to be used in salt water or alkaline soil shall receive only this mortar
 treatment. That part of any pile that will show above the ground or water line shall be given
 a Class 2 finish as described in Section 6-02.3(14)B.
 6-05.3(3)C Curing
 Precast Concrete Piles – The Contractor:
 1.	 Shall keep the concrete continuously wet with water after placement for at least 10 days
 with Type I or II portland cement or at least 3 days with Type III.
 2.	 Shall remove side forms no sooner than 24 hours after concrete placement, and then
 only if the surrounding air remains at no less than 50°F for 5 days with Type I or II
 portland cement or 3 days with Type III.
 3.	 May cure precast piles with saturated steam or hot air, as described in
 Section 6-02.3(25)D, provided the piles are kept continuously wet until the concrete has
 reached a compressive strength of 3,300 psi.
 Precast-Prestressed Concrete Piles – These piles shall be cured as required in
 Section 6-02.3(25)D.
 6-05.3(4) Manufacture of Steel Casings for Cast-In-Place Concrete Piles

 At least 14-days prior to the start of production of the piling, the Contractor shall advise
 the Engineer of the production schedule. The Contractor shall give the Inspector safe and
 free access to the Work. If the Inspector observes any nonspecification Work or unacceptable
 quality control practices, the Inspector will advise the plant manager. If the corrective action
 is not acceptable to the Engineer, the piling(s) will be subject to rejection by the Engineer.
 6-05.3(6) Splicing Steel Casings and Steel Piles
 The Engineer will normally permit steel piles and steel casings for cast-in-place concrete
 piles to be spliced. But in each case, the Contractor shall submit Type 2 Working Drawings
 supporting the need and describing the method for splicing. Welded splices shall be spaced at a
 minimum distance of 10 feet. Only welded splices will be permitted.
 Splice welds for steel piles shall comply with Section 6-03.3(25) and AWS D1.1/
 D1.1M, latest edition, Structural Welding Code. Splicing of steel piles shall be performed in
 accordance with an approved weld procedure. The Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working
 Drawing consisting of the weld procedure. For ASTM A252 material, mill certification for
 each lot of pipe to be welded shall accompany the submittal. The ends of all steel pipe piling
 shall meet the fit-up requirements of AWS D1.1/D1.1M, latest edition, Structural Welding
 Code Section 5.22.3.1, “Girth Weld Alignment (Tubular),” when the material is spliced
 utilizing a girth weld.
 Splice welds of steel casings for cast-in-place concrete piles shall be the Contractor’s
 responsibility and shall be welded in accordance with AWS D1.1/D1.1M, latest edition,
 Structural Welding Code. A weld procedure submittal is not required for steel casings used for
 cast-in-place concrete piles. Casings that collapse or are not watertight, shall be replaced at the
 Contractor’s expense.
 6-05.3(7) Storage and Handling
 The Contractor shall store and handle piles in ways that protect them from damage.
 6-05.3(7)A Timber Piles
 Timber piling shall be stacked closely and in a manner to prevent warping. The ground
 beneath and around stored piles shall be cleared of weeds, brush, and rubbish. Piling shall be
 covered against the weather if the Engineer requires it.
 The Contractor shall take special care to avoid breaking the surface of treated piles. They
 shall be lifted and moved with equipment, tools, and lifting devices which do not penetrate
 or damage the piles. If timber piles are rafted, any attachments shall be within 3 feet of the
 butts or tips. Any surface cut or break shall be repaired in accordance with Section 9-09.3. The
 Engineer may reject any pile because of a cut or break.
 6-05.3(7)B Precast Concrete Piles
 The Contractor shall not handle any pile until test cylinders made with the same batch of
 concrete as the pile reach a compressive strength of at least 3,300 psi.
 Storing and handling methods shall protect piles from fractures by impact and undue
 bending stresses. Handling methods shall never stress the reinforcement more than 12,000 psi.
 An allowance of twice the calculated load shall be made for impact and shock effects. The
 Contractor shall submit Type 2 Working Drawings consisting of the method of lifting the piles.

 6-05.3(8)  Pile Tips and Shoes
 The Contracting Agency prefers that timber piles be driven with squared ends. But if
 conditions require, they may be shod with metal shoes. Pile tips and shoes shall be securely
 attached to the piles in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Where called for in the Contract, conical steel pile tips shall be used when driving steel
 casings. The tips shall be inside fit, flush-mounted such that the tip and/or weld bead does not
 protrude more than 1⁄16 inch beyond the nominal outside diameter of the steel casing.
 If conical tips are not specified, the lower end of each casing shall have a steel driving
 plate that is thick enough to keep the casing watertight and free from distortion as it is driven.
 The diameter of the steel driving plate shall not be greater than the outside diameter of the
 steel casing.
 Where called for in the Contract, inside-fit cutting shoes shall be used when driving
 open-ended steel piles. The cutting shoes shall be flush-mounted such that the shoe and/or
 weld bead does not protrude more than 1⁄16 inch beyond the nominal outside diameter of the
 steel pile. The cutting shoe shall be of an inside diameter at least ¾ inch less than the nominal
 inside diameter of the steel pile.
 Pile tips or shoes shall be of a type denoted in the Qualified Products List. If pile tips or
 shoes other than those denoted in the Qualified Products List are proposed, the Contractor
 shall submit Type 2 Working Drawings consisting of shop drawings of the proposed pile
 tip along with design calculations, Specifications, material chemistry and installation
 requirements, along with evidence of a pile driving test demonstrating suitability of the
 proposed pile tip. The test shall be performed in the presence of the Engineer or an acceptable
 independent testing agency. The test shall consist of driving a pile fitted with the proposed
 tip. If the pile cannot be visually inspected (Section 6-05.3(11)F), a sacrificial pile fitted with
 the proposed tip shall be driven outside the proposed foundation limits. The pile shall be
 driven to a depth sufficient to develop the required ultimate bearing resistance as called for
 in the Contract, in ground conditions determined to be equivalent to the ground conditions
 at the project site. For closed-ended casings or piles, the pile need not be removed if, in the
 opinion of the Engineer, the pile can be inspected for evidence of damage to the pile or the
 tip. For open-ended steel casings or piles, timber piles or H-piles, the pile shall be removed
 for inspection.
 6-05.3(9) Pile Driving Equipment
 6-05.3(9)A  Pile Driving Equipment Approval
 Prior to driving any piles, the Contractor shall submit Type 2 Working Drawings
 consisting of details of each proposed pile driving system. The pile driving system shall
 meet the minimum requirements for the various combinations of hammer type and pile type
 specified in this section. These requirements are minimums and may need to be increased in
 order to ensure that the required ultimate bearing resistance can be achieved, that minimum tip

 allowable driving stress shall be 3 f ' cm plus prestress in tension, and 0.85f’c minus prestress
 in compression. For precast concrete piles that are not prestressed, the allowable driving stress
 shall be 70 percent of the yield stress of the steel reinforcement in tension, and 0. 85f’c in

 Rult is the resistance of the pile used in the wave equation analyses. If the ultimate bearing
 resistance equals the maximum driving resistance, a setup factor of 1.3 may be used in the
 wave equation analysis to account for pile setup. To use a setup factor in the wave equation
 analysis, Rult in the analysis is the ultimate bearing resistance divided by 1.3. If the maximum
 driving resistance exceeds the ultimate bearing resistance, no setup factor should be used, and
 Rult is equal to the maximum driving resistance of the pile.

 6-05.3(9)B  Pile Driving Equipment Minimum Requirements
 For each drop hammer used, the Contractor shall weigh it in the Engineer’s presence
 or submit a Type 1 Working Drawing consisting of a certificate of its weight. The exact weight
 shall be stamped on the hammer. Drop hammers shall weigh not less than:
 1.	 3,000 pounds for piles under 50 feet long that have an ultimate bearing resistance of not
 more than 60 tons, and
 2.	 4,000 pounds for piles 50 feet and longer or that have an ultimate bearing resistance
 of 60 to 90 tons.
 If a drop hammer is used for timber piles, it is preferable to use a heavy hammer and
 operate with a short drop.
 For each diesel, hydraulic, steam, or air-driven hammer used, the Contractor shall submit
 a Type 1 Working Drawing consisting of the manufacturer’s Specifications and catalog. These
 shall show all data needed to calculate the developed energy of the hammer used.
 Underwater hammers may be used only with permission of the Engineer.
 Drop hammers on timber piles shall have a maximum drop of 10 feet. Drop hammers shall
 not be used to drive timber piles that have ultimate bearing resistance of more than 60 tons.
 When used on timber piles, diesel, hydraulic, steam, or air-driven hammers shall provide at
 least 13,000 foot-pounds of developed energy per blow. The ram of any diesel hammer shall
 weigh at least 2,700 pounds.
 Precast concrete and precast-prestressed concrete piles shall be driven with a single-acting
 steam, air, hydraulic, or diesel hammer with a ram weight of at least half as much as the
 weight of the pile, but never less than the minimums stated below. The ratio of developed
 hammer energy to ram weight shall not exceed 6. Steel casings for cast-in-place concrete,
 steel pipe, and steel H-piles shall also be driven with diesel, hydraulic, steam, or air hammers.
 These hammers shall provide at least the following developed energy per blow:

 These requirements for minimum hammer size may be waived if a Type 2E Working
 Drawing is submitted consisting of a wave equation analysis demonstrating the ability of the
 hammer to obtain the required bearing resistance and minimum tip elevation without damage
 to the pile.
 Vibratory hammers may be used to drive piles provided the location and plumbness
 requirements of this section are met. The required bearing resistance for all piles driven with
 vibratory hammers will be determined according to Section 6-05.3(12) by driving the pile
 at least an additional 2 feet using an impact hammer. This method of determining bearing
 resistance will be accepted provided the blows per inch are either constant or increasing.
 If the pile cannot be driven 2 feet, the pile will be considered acceptable for bearing if the
 pile is driven to refusal.
 If water jets are used, the number of jets and water volume and pressure shall be enough
 to erode the material next to the pile at the tip. The equipment shall include a minimum of
 two water-jet pipes and two ¾ inch jet nozzles. The pump shall produce a constant pressure
 of at least 100 psi at each nozzle.
 6-05.3(9)C  Pile Driving Leads
 All piles shall be driven with fixed-lead drivers. The leads shall be fixed on the top and
 bottom during the pile driving operation. Leads shall be long enough to eliminate the need for
 any follower (except for timber piles as specified in Section 6-05.3(11)E). To avoid bruising or
 breaking the surface of treated timber piles, the Contractor shall use spuds and chocks as little
 as possible. In building a trestle or foundation with inclined piles, leads shall be adapted for
 driving batter piles.
 A helmet of the right size for the hammer shall distribute the blow and protect the top of
 steel piling or casings from driving damage. The helmet shall be positioned symmetrically
 below the hammer’s striking parts, so that the impact forces are applied concentric to the
 pile top.
 Pile driving leads other than those fixed at the top and bottom may be used to complete
 driving, if permitted by the Engineer, when all of the following criteria are met:
 1.	 Each plumb and battered pile is located and initially driven at least 20 feet in true
 alignment using fixed leads or other approved means.
 2.	 The pile driving system (hammer, cushion and pile) will be analyzed by Pile Driving
 Analyzer (PDA) to verify driving stresses in the pile are not increased due to eccentric
 loading during driving, and transferred hammer energy is not reduced due to eccentric
 loading during driving, for all test piles and at least one production pile per pier.
 Unless otherwise specified, the cost of PDA testing shall be incidental to the various
 unit Contract prices for driving piles.

 Piling
 
 6-05.3(10) Test Piles
 If the Contract or the Engineer call for it, the Contractor shall drive test piles to determine
 pile lengths required to reach the required ultimate bearing resistance, penetration, or both.
 Test piles shall be:
 1.	 Made of the same material and have the same tip diameter as the permanent piles
 (although test piles for treated timber piles may be either treated or untreated);
 2.	 Driven with pile tips if the permanent piles will have tips;
 3.	 Prebored when preboring is specified for the permanent piles;
 4.	 Identical in cross-section and other characteristics to the permanent piles when
 the test piles are steel casings for cast-in-place concrete piles, precast concrete,
 precast‑prestressed concrete or steel pipe or H-pile;
 5.	 Long enough to accommodate any soil condition;
 6.	 Driven with equipment and methods identical to those to be used for the
 permanent piles;
 7.	 Located as the Engineer directs; and
 8.	 Driven before permanent piles in a given pier.
 Test piles may also be driven by the Contractor (at no cost to the Contracting Agency)
 as evidence that the pile driving system selected will not damage the pile or result in refusal
 prior to reaching any specified minimum tip elevation.
 Timber test piles shall be driven outside the footing and cut off 1 foot below the finished
 ground line. Timber test piles shall not be used in place of permanent piles.
 Steel and all types of concrete test piles shall become permanent piles. The Contracting
 Agency has reduced the number of permanent piles by the number of test piles.
 The Contractor shall base test pile length on test-hole data in the Contract. Any test piles
 that prove to be too short shall be replaced (or spliced if the Contract allows splicing) at the
 Contractor’s expense.
 In foundations and trestles, test piles shall be driven to at least 15 percent more than the
 ultimate bearing resistance required for the permanent piles, except where pile driving criteria
 is determined by the wave equation. When pile driving criteria is specified to be determined
 by the wave equation, the test piles shall be driven to the same ultimate bearing resistance as
 the production piles. Test piles shall penetrate at least to any minimum tip elevation specified
 in the Contract. If no minimum tip elevation is specified, test piles shall extend at least 10 feet
 below the bottom of the concrete footing or ground line, and 15 feet below the bottom of the
 concrete seal.
 When any test pile to be left as a permanent pile has been so damaged by handling or
 driving that the Engineer believes it unfit for use, the Contractor shall remove and replace
 the pile at no additional cost to the Contracting Agency. The Engineer may direct the
 Contractor to overdrive the test pile to more than 15 percent above the ultimate bearing
 resistance for permanent piles, or if the wave equation is used to determine driving criteria,
 the Engineer may direct the Contractor to overdrive the test pile above the ultimate bearing
 resistance. In these cases, the overdriving shall be at the Contractor’s expense. But if pile
 damage results from this overdriving, any removal and replacement will be at the Contracting
 Agency’s expense.
 6-05.3(11)  Driving Piles
 6-05.3(11)A Tolerances
 For elevated pier caps, the tops of piles at cut-off elevation shall be within 2 inches of the
 horizontal locations indicated in the Contract. For piles capped below final grade, the tops
 of piles at cut-off elevation shall be within 6 inches of the horizontal locations indicated in
 the Contract. No pile edge shall be nearer than 4 inches from the edge of any footing or cap.
 Piles shall be installed such that the axial alignment of the top 10 feet of the pile is within
 Page 6-128
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Piling
 
 6-05
 
 4 percent of the specified alignment. No misaligned steel or concrete piles shall be pulled
 laterally. A properly aligned section shall not be spliced onto a misaligned section for any
 type of pile. Unless the Contract shows otherwise, all piles shall be driven vertically.
 6-05.3(11)B  Foundation Pit Preparation
 The Contractor shall replace (and bear the cost of replacing) any pile damaged or destroyed
 before or during driving.
 The Contractor shall completely dig all foundation pits (and build any required cofferdams
 or cribs) before driving foundation piles. The Contractor shall adjust pit depths to allow for
 upheaval caused by pile-driving, judging the amount of adjustment by the nature of the soil.
 Before constructing the footing or pile cap, the Contractor shall restore the pit bottom to
 correct elevation by removing material or by backfilling with granular material.
 6-05.3(11)C  Preparation for Driving
 Treated and untreated timber piles shall be freshly cut square on the butt ends just before
 they are driven. If piles will be driven into hard material, caps, collars, or bands shall be placed
 on the butt ends to prevent crushing or brooming. If the head area of the pile is larger than that
 of the hammer face, the head shall be snipped or chamfered to fit the hammer. On treated piles,
 the heads shall be snipped or chamfered to at least the depth of the sapwood to avoid splitting
 the sapwood from the pile body.
 The Contractor shall match timber pile sizes in any single bent to prevent sway braces from
 undue bending or distorting.
 When driven, pile faces shall be turned as shown in the Plans or as the Engineer directs.
 No precast-prestressed pile shall be driven until test cylinders poured with it reach at
 least the specified compressive strength shown in the Contract. On all other precast piles, the
 cylinders must reach a compressive strength of at least 4,000 psi before the piles are driven.
 Helmets of approved design shall protect the heads of all precast concrete piles as they
 are driven. Each helmet shall have fitted into it a cushion next to the pile head. The bottom
 side of the helmet shall be recessed sufficiently to accommodate the required pile cushion
 and hold the pile in place during positioning and driving. The inside helmet diameter shall be
 determined before casting the pile, and the head of the pile shall be formed to fit loosely inside
 the helmet.
 Steel Casing, steel pipe or H-piles shall have square-cut ends.
 6-05.3(11)D  Achieving Minimum Tip Elevation and Bearing
 Once pile driving has started, each pile shall be driven continuously until the required
 ultimate bearing resistance shown in the Contract has been achieved. Pauses during pile
 driving, except for splicing, mechanical breakdown, or other unforeseen events, shall not
 be allowed.
 If the Contract specifies a minimum tip elevation, the pile shall be driven to at least the
 minimum tip elevation, even if the ultimate bearing resistance has been achieved, unless the
 Engineer directs otherwise. If a pile does not develop the required ultimate bearing resistance
 at the minimum tip elevation, the Contractor shall continue driving the pile until the required
 bearing resistance is achieved. If no minimum tip elevation is specified, then the piles
 shall be driven to the ultimate bearing resistance shown in the Contract and the following
 minimum penetrations:
 	 Pile supporting cross-beams, bents,
   elevated pile caps elevation	
 10 feet below final top of ground
 Piles supporting foundations	
 10 feet below bottom of foundation
 Piles with a concrete seal	
 15 feet below bottom of seal
 If overdriving is required in order to reach a specified minimum tip elevation, the
 Contractor shall provide a pile driving system which will not result in damage to the pile
 or refusal before the minimum tip elevation is reached. The cost of overdriving shall be
 incidental to the various unit Contract prices for furnishing and driving piles.
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-129
 
 6-05
 
 Piling
 
 So long as the pile is not damaged and the embankment or foundation material being
 driven through is not permanently damaged, the Contractor shall use normal means
 necessary to:
 1.	 Secure the minimum depth specified,
 2.	 Penetrate hard material that lies under a soft upper layer,
 3.	 Penetrate through hard material to obtain the specified minimum tip elevation, or
 4.	 Penetrate through a previously placed embankment.
 Normal means refer to methods such as preboring, spudding, or jetting piles. Blasting or
 drilling through obstructions are not considered normal means.
 Prebored holes and pile spuds shall have a diameter no larger than the least outside
 dimension of the pile. After the pile is driven, the Contractor shall fill all open spaces between
 the pile and the soil caused by the preboring or spudding with dry sand, or pea gravel, or
 controlled density fill as approved by the Engineer.
 If water jets are used, the jets shall be withdrawn before the pile reaches its final
 penetration, and the pile shall then be driven to its final penetration and ultimate bearing
 resistance. The pile shall be driven a minimum of 2 feet to obtain the ultimate bearing
 resistance after the jets are withdrawn, or to refusal, whichever occurs first. If the water jets
 loosen a pile previously driven, it shall be redriven in place or pulled and replaced by a new
 pile. To check on pile loosening, the Contractor shall attempt to redrive at least one in every
 five piles, but no less than one pile per bent or pier.
 The various unit Contract prices for driving piles shall cover all costs related to the
 use of water jets, preboring, or spudding. The Contracting Agency will not pay any costs
 the Contractor incurs in redriving piles loosened as a result of using water jets, preboring,
 or spudding.
 If the Engineer requires, the Contractor shall overdrive the pile beyond the ultimate bearing
 resistance and minimum tip elevation shown in the Contract. In this case, the Contractor will
 not be required to:
 1.	 Use other than normal means to achieve the additional penetration,
 2.	 Bear the expense of removing or replacing any pile damaged by overdriving, or
 3.	 Bear the expense of overdriving the pile more than 3 feet as specified in Section 6-05.5.
 In driving piles for footings with seals, the Contractor shall use no method (such as jetting
 or preboring) that might reduce friction resistance.
 6-05.3(11)E  Use of Followers for Driving
 Followers shall not be used to drive concrete or steel piles. On timber piles, the Contractor
 may use steel (not wooden) followers if the follower fits snugly over the pile head. If a
 follower is used, the Contractor shall, in every group of 10 piles, drive one long pile without
 a follower, but no less than one pile per bent or pier, to the required ultimate bearing resistance
 and minimum tip elevation. This long pile shall be used to test the bearing resistance of the
 piles driven with a follower in the group. The tip elevation of the long pile shall be similar
 to the elevation of the piles driven with the follower. If the tip elevations are significantly
 different, as determined by the Engineer, the Contractor shall redrive the remaining piles in the
 group to the tip elevation of the longer pile.
 6-05.3(11)F  Pile Damage
 The Contractor shall remove and replace (and bear the cost of doing so) any pile that is
 damaged as determined by the Engineer.
 After driving a steel casing for a cast-in-place concrete pile, the Contractor shall leave it
 empty until the Engineer has inspected and accepted it. The Contractor shall make available
 to the Engineer a light suitable for inspecting the entire length of its interior. The Engineer
 will reject any casing that is improperly driven, that shows partial collapse that would reduce
 its ultimate bearing resistance, or that has been reduced in diameter, or that will not keep out
 water. The Contractor shall replace (and bear the cost of replacing) any rejected casing.
 Page 6-130
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Piling
 
 6-05
 
 Pile heads which have been broomed, rolled, or otherwise significantly damaged as
 determined by the Engineer shall be cut back to undamaged material before proceeding with
 driving as well as final acceptance of the pile.
 6-05.3(11)G  Pile Cutoff
 The Contractor shall trim the tops of all piles to the true plane shown in the Contract and
 to the elevation the Engineer requires. If a pile is driven below cutoff elevation without the
 Engineer’s permission, the Contractor shall remove and replace it (and bear the costs of doing
 so), even if this requires a longer pile. Any pile that rises as nearby piles are driven, shall be
 driven down again if the Engineer requires.
 Any piles under timber caps or grillages shall be sawed to the exact plane of the Structure
 above them and fit it exactly. No shimming on top of timber piles to adjust for inaccurate pile
 top elevations will be permitted. If a timber pile is driven out of line, it shall be straightened
 without damage before it is cut off or braced.
 Steel casing shall be cut off at least 6 inches below the finished ground line or at the low
 water line if the casing will be visible as determined by the Engineer.
 6-05.3(11)H  Pile Driving From or Near Adjacent Structures
 The Contractor shall not drive piling from an existing Structure unless all of the following
 conditions are met:
 1.	 The existing Structure will be demolished within the Contract;
 2.	 The existing Structure is permanently closed to traffic; and
 3.	 Type 2E Working Drawings are submitted in accordance with Sections 1-05.3 and
 6-02.3(16), showing the structural adequacy of the existing Structure to safely support
 all of the construction loads.
 Freshly placed concrete in the vicinity of the pile driving operation shall be protected
 against vibration in accordance with Section 6-02.3(6)D.
 6-05.3(12) Determination of Bearing Values
 The following formula shall be used to determine ultimate bearing resistances:
 P = F × E × Ln(10N)
 Where	:
 	
 P	 =	 ultimate bearing resistance, in tons
 	
 F	 =	 1.8 for air/steam hammers
 	
 =	 1.2 for open ended diesel hammers and precast concrete or timber piles
 	
 =	 1.6 for open ended diesel hammers and steel piles
 	
 =	 1.2 for closed ended diesel hammers
 	
 =	 1.9 for hydraulic hammers
 	
 =	 0.9 for drop hammers
 	
 E	 =	 developed energy, equal to W times H1, in ft-kips
 	
 W	 =	 weight of ram, in kips
 	
 H	 =	 vertical drop of hammer or stroke of ram, in feet
 	N	 =	 average penetration resistance in blows per inch for the last
 		 4 inches of driving
 	
 Ln	 =	 the natural logarithm, in base “e”
 
 1For
 
 closed-end diesel hammers (double-acting), the developed hammer energy (E) is to be determined from the bounce
 chamber reading. Hammer manufacturer calibration data may be used to correlate bounce chamber pressure to developed
 hammer energy. For double acting hammer hydraulic and air/steam hammers, the developed hammer energy shall be
 calculated from ram impact velocity measurements or other means acceptable to the Engineer. For open ended diesel
 hammers (single-acting) use the blows per minute to determine the developed energy (E).
 
 The above formula applies only when:
 1.	 The hammer is in good condition and operating in a satisfactory manner.
 2.	 A follower is not used.
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-131
 
 6-05
 
 Piling
 
 3.	 The pile top is not damaged.
 4.	 The pile head is free from broomed or crushed wood fiber.
 5.	 The penetration occurs at a reasonably quick, uniform rate; and the pile has been driven
 at least 2 feet after any interruption in driving greater than 1 hour in length.
 6.	 There is no perceptible bounce after the blow. If a significant bounce cannot be avoided,
 twice the height of the bounce shall be deducted from “H” to determine its true value in
 the formula.
 7.	 For timber piles, bearing resistances calculated by the formula above shall be
 considered effective only when it is less than the crushing strength of the piles.
 8.	 If “N” is greater than or equal to 1.0 blow/inch.
 If “N” required to achieve the required ultimate bearing resistance using the above formula
 is less than 1.0 blow/inch, the pile shall be driven until the penetration resistance is a minimum
 of 1.0 blow/inch for the last 2 feet of driving.
 The Engineer may require the Contractor to install a pressure gauge on the inboard end of
 the hose to check pressure at the hammer.
 If water jets are used in driving, bearing resistances shall be determined either: (1) by
 calculating it with the driving data and the formula above after the jets have been withdrawn
 and the pile is driven at least 2 feet, or (2) by applying a test load.
 6-05.3(13)  Treatment of Timber Pile Heads
 After cutting timber piles to correct elevation, the Contractor shall thoroughly coat
 the heads of all untreated piles with two coats of an approved preservative that meets the
 requirements of Section 9-09 (except concrete-encased piles).
 After cutting treated timber piles to correct elevation, the Contractor shall brush three
 coats of a preservative that meets the requirements of Section 9-09 on all pile heads (except
 those to be covered with concrete footings or concrete caps). The pile heads shall then be
 capped with alternate layers of an approved roofing asphalt and a waterproofing fabric that
 conforms to Section 9-11.2. The cap shall be made of four layers of an approved roofing
 asphalt and three layers of fabric. The fabric shall be cut large enough to cover the pile top
 and fold down at least 6 inches along all sides of the pile. After the fabric cover is bent down
 over the pile, its edges shall be fastened with large-head galvanized nails or with three turns
 of galvanized wire. The edges of the cover shall be neatly trimmed.
 On any treated timber pile encased in concrete, the cut end shall receive two coats of an
 approved preservative that meets the requirements of Section 9-09 and then a heavy coat of
 an approved roofing asphalt.
 6-05.3(14)  Extensions and Buildups of Precast Concrete Piles
 The Contractor shall add extensions, or buildups (if necessary) on precast concrete piles
 after they are driven to the required ultimate bearing resistance and minimum tip elevation.
 Before adding extensions or buildups to precast-prestressed piles, the Contractor
 shall remove any spalled concrete, leaving the pile fresh-headed and with a top surface
 perpendicular to the axis of the pile. The concrete in the buildup shall be Class 5000.
 Before adding to non-prestressed precast concrete piles, the Contractor shall cut the pile
 head away to a depth 40 times the diameter of the vertical reinforcing bar. The final cut shall
 be perpendicular to the axis of the pile. Reinforcement of the same density and configuration
 as used in the pile shall be used in the buildup and shall be fastened firmly to the projecting
 steel. Forms shall be placed to prevent concrete from leaking along the pile. The concrete in
 the buildup shall be Class 4000.
 Just before placing the concrete for extensions or buildups to precast or precast-prestressed
 concrete piles, the Contractor shall thoroughly wet the top of the pile. Forms shall remain in
 place at least 3 days.

 6-05.3(15)  Completion of Cast-In-Place Concrete Piles
 After acceptance by the Engineer, driven casings shall be cut off horizontally at the
 required elevation. They shall be clean and free of water when concrete and reinforcing steel
 are placed.
 These piles shall consist of steel casings driven into the ground, reinforced as specified,
 and filled with Class 4000P concrete.
 6-05.3(15)A Reinforcement
 All bars shall be fastened rigidly into a single unit, then lowered into the casing before the
 concrete is placed. Loose bars shall not be used.
 Spiral hooping reinforcement shall be deformed steel bar, plain steel bar, cold-drawn wire,
 or deformed wire.
 6-05.3(15)B  Placing Concrete
 Before placing concrete, the Contractor shall remove all debris and water from the casing.
 If the water cannot be removed, the casing shall be removed (or cut off 2 feet below the
 ground and filled with sand) and a new one driven.
 The Contractor shall place concrete continuously through a 5-foot rigid conduit directing
 the concrete down the center of the pile casing, ensuring that every part of the pile is filled and
 the concrete is worked around the reinforcement. The top 5 feet of concrete shall be placed
 with the tip of the conduit below the top of fresh concrete. The Contractor shall vibrate, as a
 minimum, the top 10 feet of concrete. In all cases, the concrete shall be vibrated to a point at
 least 5 feet below the original ground line.
 6-05.4 Measurement
 Measurement for driving (type) pile will be the number of piles driven in place.
 In these categories, measurement will be the longer of either the number of linear feet
 driven below cutoff or as shown in the Engineer’s order list:
 1.	 Furnishing timber piling (untreated or name of treatment).
 2.	 Precast concrete and precast-prestressed concrete piling.
 In these categories, measurement will be the number of linear feet driven below cutoff,
 but no Engineer’s order list will be provided:
 1.	 Cast-in-place concrete piling.
 2.	 Furnishing steel piling.
 Measurement for furnishing and driving test piles will be the number actually furnished
 and driven as the Contract requires.
 Measurement for steel pile tips or shoes will be by the number of tips or shoes actually
 installed and driven in place on steel casings or steel piles.
 6-05.5 Payment
 Payment will be made for each of the following Bid items that are included in the Proposal:

 deck or steel reinforcing bars that are to remain in place. All removal shall be accomplished
 by making neat vertical cuts and maintaining square edges at the boundaries of the repair area.
 Cuts made by using sawing or hydro demolishing machines shall be made after sufficient
 concrete removal has been accomplished to establish the limits of the removal area. In no case
 shall the depth of the vertical cut exceed ¾ inch or to the top of the top steel reinforcing bars,
 whichever is less.
 The exposed steel reinforcing bars and concrete in the repair area shall be sandblasted or
 hydro-blasted and blown clean just prior to placing concrete.
 Where existing steel reinforcing bars inside deck repair areas show deterioration exceeding
 the limits defined in the Plans, the Contractor shall furnish and place steel reinforcing bars
 alongside the deteriorated bars in accordance with the details shown in the Plans. Payment for
 such extra Work will be by force account as provided in Section 1-09.6.

 6-09.3(7)  Surface Preparation for Concrete Overlay
 Following the completion of any required further deck preparation the entire lane or strip
 being overlaid shall be cleaned.
 If either a rotary milling machine or a shot blasting machine is used for concrete
 scarification, then the concrete deck shall be sandblasted or shot blasted, using equipment
 identified in the Working Drawing submittals, until sound concrete is exposed. Care shall be
 taken to ensure that all exposed reinforcing steel and the surrounding concrete is completely
 blasted. Bridge grate inlets, expansion dams and barriers above the surface to be blasted shall
 be protected from the blasting.
 If a hydro-demolition machine is used for concrete scarification, then the concrete deck
 shall be cleaned by water blasting with 7,000 psi minimum pressure, until sound concrete
 is exposed.
 The final surface of the deck shall be free from oil and grease, rust and other foreign
 material that may reduce the bond of the new concrete to the old. These materials shall
 be removed by detergent-cleaning or other method accepted by the Engineer followed
 by sandblasting.
 After all scarifying, chipping, sandblasting and cleaning is completed, the entire lane or
 strip being overlaid shall be cleaned in final preparation for placing concrete using either
 compressed air or vacuum machines. Vacuum machines shall be used when warranted by
 applicable air pollution ordinances.
 Scarifying with either rotary milling machines or shot blasting machines, hand tool
 chipping, sandblasting and cleaning in areas adjacent to a lane or strip being cleaned in
 final preparation for placing concrete shall be discontinued when final preparation is begun.
 Scarifying and hand tool chipping shall remain suspended until the concrete has been placed
 and the requirement for curing time has been satisfied. Sandblasting and cleaning shall remain
 suspended for the first 24 hours of curing time after the completion of concrete placing.
 If the hydro demolishing scarification process is used, scarification may proceed during the
 final cleaning and overlay placement phases of the Work on adjacent portions of the Structure
 so long as the hydro demolisher operations are confined to areas which are a minimum of
 100 feet away from the defined limits of the final cleaning or overlay placement in progress.
 If the hydro demolisher impedes or interferes in any way with the final cleaning or overlay
 placement as determined by the Engineer, the hydro demolishing Work shall be terminated
 immediately and the hydro demolishing equipment removed sufficiently away from the
 area being prepared or overlaid to eliminate the conflict. If the grade is such that water and
 contaminates from the hydro demolishing operation will flow into the area being prepared or
 overlaid, the hydro demolishing operation shall be terminated and shall remain suspended for
 the first 24 hours of curing time after the completion of concrete placement.
 If, after final cleaning, the lane or strip being overlaid becomes wet, the Contractor shall
 flush the surface with high-pressure water, prior to placement of the overlay. All freestanding
 water shall be removed prior to concrete placement. Concrete placement shall begin within
 24 hours of the completion of deck preparation for the portion of the deck to be overlaid.
 If concrete placement has not begun within 24 hours, the lane or strip being overlaid shall be
 cleaned by a light sand blasting followed by washing with the high-pressure water spray or
 by cleaning with the high-pressure spray.
 Traffic other than required construction equipment will not be permitted on any portion of
 the lane or strip being overlaid that has undergone final preparation for placing concrete unless
 allowed by the Engineer. To prevent contamination, all equipment allowed on the deck after
 final cleaning shall be equipped with drip guards.

 6-09.3(8)A  Quality Assurance for Microsilica Modified and Fly Ash Modified
 Concrete Overlays
 The Engineer will perform slump, temperature, and entrained air tests for acceptance in
 accordance with Section 6-02.3(5)D and as specified in this section after the Contractor has
 turned over the concrete for acceptance testing. Concrete samples for testing shall be supplied
 to the Engineer in accordance with Section 6-02.3(5)E. Concrete from the first truckload shall
 not be placed until tests for acceptance have been completed by the Engineer and the results
 indicate that the concrete is within acceptable limits. Sampling and testing will continue for
 each load until two successive loads meet all applicable acceptance test requirements. Except
 for the first load of concrete, up to ½ cubic yard may be placed prior to testing for acceptance.
 After two successive tests indicate that the concrete is within specified limits, the sampling and
 testing frequency may decrease to one for every three truckloads. Loads to be sampled will be
 selected in accordance with the random selection process outlined in FOP for WAQTC TM2.
 When the results of any subsequent acceptance test indicates that the concrete does not
 conform to the specified limits, the sampling and testing frequency will be resumed for each
 truckload. Whenever two successive subsequent tests indicate that the concrete is within the
 specified limits, the random sampling and testing frequency of one for every three truck loads
 may resume.
 6-09.3(8)B  Quality Assurance for Latex Modified Concrete Overlays
 The Engineer will perform slump, temperature, and entrained air tests for acceptance
 in accordance with Section 6-02.3(5)D and as specified in this section after the Contractor
 has turned over the concrete for acceptance testing. The Engineer will perform testing as
 the concrete is being placed. Samples shall be taken on the first charge through each mobile
 mixer and every other charge thereafter. The sample shall be taken after the first 2 minutes of
 continuous mixer operation. Concrete samples for testing shall be supplied to the Engineer in
 accordance with Section 6-02.3(5)E.
 During the initial proportioning, mixing, placing, and finishing operations, the Engineer
 may require the presence of a technical representative from the latex admixture manufacturer.
 The technical representative shall be capable of performing, demonstrating, inspecting, and
 testing all of the functions required for placement of the latex modified concrete as specified
 in Section 6-09.3(11). This technical representative shall aid in the proper installation of the
 latex modified concrete. Recommendations made by the technical representative on or off
 the jobsite shall be adhered to by the Contractor. The Engineer will advise the Contractor in
 writing a minimum of 5 working days before such services are required.
 6-09.3(9)  Mixing Concrete For Concrete Overlay
 6-09.3(9)A  Mixing Microsilica Modified or Fly Ash Modified Concrete
 Mixing of concrete shall be in accordance with Section 6-02, with the following exceptions:
 1.	 The mixing shall be done at a batch plant.
 2.	 The volume of concrete transported by truck shall not exceed 6-cubic yards per truck.
 6-09.3(9)B  Mixing Latex Modified Concrete
 The equipment used for mixing the concrete shall be operated with strict adherence to the
 procedures set forth by its manufacturer.
 A minimum of two mixers will be required at the overlay site for each concrete placement
 when the total volume of concrete to be placed during the concrete placement exceeds the
 material storage capacity of a single mixer. Additional mixers may be required if conditions
 require that material be stockpiled away from the jobsite. The Contractor shall have sufficient

 6-09.3(10)  Overlay Profile and Screed Rails
 6-09.3(10)A  Survey of Existing Bridge Deck Prior to Scarification
 Prior to beginning the scarifying concrete surface finish work specified under
 Section 6-09.3(5), the Contractor shall complete a survey of the existing bridge deck(s)
 specified to receive modified concrete overlay for use in establishing the existing cross
 section and grade profile elevations.
 The Contracting Agency will provide the Contractor with primary survey control
 information consisting of descriptions of two primary control points used for the horizontal
 and vertical control. Primary control points will be described by reference to the bridge or
 project-specific stationing and elevation datum. The Contracting Agency will also provide
 horizontal coordinates for the beginning and ending points and for each Point of Intersection
 (PI) on each centerline alignment included in the project. The Contractor shall provide the
 Engineer 21 calendar days notice in advance of scheduled concrete surface scarification work
 to allow the Contracting Agency time to provide the primary survey control information.
 The Contractor shall verify the primary survey control information furnished by the
 Contracting Agency and shall expand the survey control information to include secondary
 horizontal and vertical control points as needed for the project. The Contractor’s survey
 records shall include descriptions of all survey control points, including coordinates and
 elevations of all secondary control points.
 The Contractor shall maintain detailed survey records, including a description of the work
 performed on each shift, the methods utilized to conduct the survey, and the control points
 used. The record shall be of sufficient detail to allow the survey to be reproduced. A Type 1
 Working Drawing of each day’s survey record shall be provided to the Engineer within
 3 working days after the end of the shift. The Contractor shall compile the survey information
 in an electronic file format acceptable to the Contracting Agency (Excel spreadsheet format
 is preferred).
 Survey information collected shall include station, offset, and elevation for each lane line
 and curb line. Survey information shall be collected at even 20-foot station intervals and
 also at the centerline of each bridge expansion joint. The Contractor shall ensure a surveying
 accuracy to within ± 0.01 feet for vertical control and ± 0.2 feet for horizontal control.
 The survey shall extend 100 feet beyond the bridge back of pavement seat.
 Except for the primary survey control information furnished by the Contracting Agency,
 the Contractor shall be responsible for all calculations, surveying, and measuring required for
 setting, maintaining, and resetting equipment and materials necessary for the construction of
 the overlay to the final grade profile. The Contracting Agency may post-check the Contractor’s
 surveying, but these post-checks shall not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for internal
 survey quality control.
 The Contracting Agency will establish the final grade profile based on the Contractor’s
 survey, and will provide the final grade profile to the Contractor within three working days
 after receiving the Contractor’s survey information.
 The Contractor shall not begin scarifying concrete surface work specified under
 Section 6-09.3(5) until receiving the final grade profile from the Engineer.
 6-09.3(10)B  Establishing Finish Overlay Profile
 The finish grade profile shall be + ¼ inch/- ⅛ inch from the Engineer’s final grade profile.
 The final grade profile shall be verified prior to the placement of modified concrete overlay
 with the screed rails in place. The finishing machine shall be passed over the entire surface
 to be overlaid and the final screed rail adjustments shall be made. If the resultant overlay
 thickness is not compatible with the finish grade profile generated by the Contractor’s screed
 rail setup, the Contractor shall make profile adjustments as specified by the Engineer. After the
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-177
 
 6-09
 
 Modified Concrete Overlays
 
 finish overlay profile has been verified, changes in the finishing machine elevation controls
 will not be allowed. The Contractor shall be responsible for setting screed control to obtain the
 specified finish grade overlay profile as well as the finished surface smoothness requirements
 specified in Section 6-02.3(10).
 Screed rails upon which the finishing machine travels shall be placed outside the area to
 be overlaid, in accordance with item 7 of Section 6-09.3(2). Interlocking rail sections or other
 approved methods of providing rail continuity are required.
 Hold-down devices shot into the concrete are not permitted unless the concrete is to
 be subsequently overlaid. Hold-down devices of other types leaving holes in the exposed
 area will be allowed provided the holes are subsequently filled with mortar conforming
 to Section 9-20.4(2) mixed at a 1:2 cement/aggregate ratio. Hold-down devices shall not
 penetrate the existing deck by more than ¾ inch.
 Screed rails may be removed at any time after the concrete has taken an initial set.
 Adequate precautions shall be taken during the removal of the finishing machine and rails
 to protect the edges of the new surfaces.
 6-09.3(11)  Placing Concrete Overlay
 Five to ten working days prior to modified concrete overlay placement, a preoverlay
 conference shall be held to discuss equipment, construction procedures, personnel, and
 previous results. Inspection procedures shall also be reviewed to ensure coordination.
 Those attending shall include:
 1.	 (Representing the Contractor) The superintendent and all foremen in charge of placing
 and finishing the modified concrete overlay, and
 2.	 (Representing the Contracting Agency) The Engineer and key inspection assistants.
 If the project includes more than one bridge deck, an additional conference shall be held
 just before placing modified concrete overlay for each subsequent bridge deck.
 The Contractor shall not place modified concrete overlay until the Engineer agrees that:
 1.	 Modified concrete overlay producing and placement rates will be high enough to
 meet placing and finishing deadlines,
 2.	 Finishers with enough experience have been employed, and
 3.	 Adequate finishing tools and equipment are at the site.
 Concrete placement shall be made in accordance with Section 6-02 and the following
 requirements:
 1.	 After the lane or strip to be overlaid has been prepared and immediately before placing
 the concrete, it shall be thoroughly soaked and kept continuously wet with water for a
 minimum period of 6 hours prior to placement of the concrete. All freestanding water
 shall be removed prior to concrete placement. During concrete placement, the lane or
 strip shall be kept moist.
 	 The concrete shall then be promptly and continuously delivered and deposited on the
 placement side of the finishing machine.
 	 If latex modified concrete is used, the concrete shall be thoroughly brushed into the
 surface and then brought up to final grade. If either microsilica modified concrete or fly
 ash modified concrete are used, a slurry of the concrete, excluding aggregate, shall be
 thoroughly brushed into the surface prior to the overlay placement.
 	 Care shall be exercised to ensure that the surface receives a thorough, even coating
 and that the rate of progress is limited so that the brushed concrete does not become
 dry before it is covered with additional concrete as required for the final grade. All
 aggregate which is segregated from the mix during the brushing operation shall be
 removed from the deck and disposed of by the Contractor.
 	 If either microsilica modified concrete or fly ash modified concrete are used, the
 Contractor shall ensure that a sufficient number of trucks are used for concrete delivery

 to obtain a consistent and continuous delivery and placement of concrete throughout the
 concrete placement operation.
 When concrete is to be placed against the concrete in a previously placed transverse
 joint, lane, or strip, the previously placed concrete shall be sawed back 6 inches
 to straight and vertical edges and shall be sandblasted or water blasted before new
 concrete is placed. The Engineer may decrease the 6 inch saw back requirement to
 2 inches minimum, if a bulkhead was used during previous concrete placement and the
 concrete was hand vibrated along the bulkhead.
 Concrete placement shall not begin if rain is expected. Adequate precautions shall be
 taken to protect freshly placed concrete in the event that rain begins during placement.
 Concrete that is damaged by rain shall be removed and replaced by the Contractor at no
 additional expense to the Contracting Agency, and to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 Concrete shall not be placed when the temperature of the concrete surface is less than
 45ºF or greater than 75ºF, when the combination of air temperature, relative humidity,
 fresh concrete temperature, and wind velocity at the construction site produces an
 evaporation rate of 0.15 pound per square foot of surface per hour as determined from
 Table 6-02.3(6), or when winds are in excess of 10 mph. If the Contractor elects to
 Work at night to meet these criteria, adequate lighting shall be provided at no additional
 expense to the Contracting Agency.
 If concrete placement is stopped for a period of ½ hour or more, the Contractor shall
 install a bulkhead transverse to the direction of placement at a position where the
 overlay can be finished full width up to the bulkhead. The bulkhead shall be full depth
 of the overlay and shall be installed to grade. The concrete shall be finished and cured
 in accordance with these Specifications.
 Further placement is permitted only after a period of 12 hours unless a gap is left in the
 lane or strip. The gap shall be of sufficient width for the finishing machine to clear the
 transverse bulkhead installed where concrete placement was stopped. The previously
 placed concrete shall be sawed back from the bulkhead, to a point designated by the
 Engineer, to straight and vertical edges and shall be sandblasted or water blasted before
 new concrete is placed.
 Concrete shall not be placed against the edge of an adjacent lane or strip that is less
 than 36 hours old.
 
 6-09.3(12)  Finishing Concrete Overlay
 Finishing shall be accomplished in accordance with the applicable portions of
 Section 6-02.3(10) and as follows. Concrete shall be placed and struck-off approximately
 ½ inch above final grade and then consolidated and finished to final grade with a single
 pass (the Engineer may require additional passes) of the finishing machine. Hand finishing
 may be necessary to close up or seal off the surface. The final product shall be a dense
 uniform surface.
 Latex shall not be sprayed on a freshly placed latex modified concrete surface; however,
 a light fog spray of water is permitted if required for finishing, as determined by the Engineer.
 As the finishing machine progresses along the placed concrete, the surface shall be given
 a final finish by texturing with a comb perpendicular to the centerline of the bridge. The
 texture shall be applied immediately behind the finishing machine. The comb shall consist
 of a single row of metal tines capable of producing ⅛-inch wide striations approximately
 0.015 foot in depth at approximately ½-inch spacing. The combs may be operated manually
 or mechanically, either singly or in gangs (several combs placed end to end). This operation
 shall be done in a manner that will minimize the displacement of the aggregate particles. The
 texture shall not extend into areas within 2 feet of the curb line. The non-textured concrete
 within 2 feet of the curb line shall be hand finished with a steel or magnesium trowel.
 Construction dams shall be separated from the newly placed concrete by passing a pointing
 trowel along the inside surfaces of the dams. Care shall be exercised to ensure that this
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-179
 
 6-09
 
 Modified Concrete Overlays
 
 trowel cut is made for the entire depth and length of the dams after the concrete has stiffened
 sufficiently that it does not flow back.
 After the burlap cover has been removed and the concrete surface has dried, but before
 opening to traffic, all joints and visible cracks shall be filled and sealed with a high molecular
 weight methacrylate resin (HMWM). Cracks 1⁄16 inch and greater in width shall receive two
 applications of HMWM. Immediately following the application of HMWM, the wetted surface
 shall be coated with sand for abrasive finish.
 6-09.3(13)  Curing Concrete Overlay
 As the texturing portion of the finishing operation progresses, the concrete shall be
 immediately covered with a single layer of clean, new or used, wet burlap. The burlap shall
 have a maximum width of 6 feet. The Engineer will determine the suitability of the burlap for
 reuse, based on the cleanliness and absorption ability of the burlap. Care shall be exercised
 to ensure that the burlap is well drained and laid flat with no wrinkles on the deck surface.
 Adjacent strips of burlap shall have a minimum overlap of 6 inches.
 Once in place the burlap shall be lightly fog sprayed with water. A separate layer of white,
 reflective type polyethylene sheeting shall immediately be placed over the wet burlap. The
 concrete shall then be wet cured by keeping the burlap wet for a minimum of 42 hours after
 which the polyethylene sheeting and burlap may be removed.
 Traffic shall not be permitted on the finished concrete until the specified curing time is
 satisfied and until the concrete has reached a minimum compressive strength of 3,000 psi as
 verified by rebound number determined in accordance with ASTM C805.
 6-09.3(14)  Checking for Bond
 After the requirements for curing have been met, the entire overlaid surface shall
 be sounded by the Contractor, in a manner approved by and in the presence of the Engineer,
 to ensure total bond of the concrete to the bridge deck. Concrete in unbonded areas shall
 be removed and replaced by the Contractor with the same modified concrete as used in the
 overlay. Removal and replacement of the overlay in unbonded areas shall be performed at the
 expense of the Contracting Agency, except as specified in Section 6-09.3(6) when the overlay
 is placed on a bridge deck as part of the same Contract as the bridge deck construction.
 All cracks, except those that are significant enough to require removal, shall be thoroughly
 filled and sealed as specified in Section 6-09.3(12).
 After the curing requirements have been met, the Contractor may use compressed air to
 accelerate drying of the deck surface for crack identification and sealing.
 6-09.4 Measurement
 Scarifying concrete surface will be measured by the square yard of surface
 actually scarified.
 Modified concrete overlay will be measured by the cubic foot of material placed. For
 latex modified concrete overlay, the volume will be determined by the theoretical yield
 of the design mix and documented by the counts of the cement meter less waste. For both
 microsilica modified concrete overlay and fly ash modified concrete overlay, the volume will
 be determined from the concrete supplier’s Certificate of Compliance for each batch delivered
 less waste. Waste is defined as the following:
 1.	 Material not placed.
 2.	 Material placed in excess of 6 inches outside a longitudinal joint or transverse joint.
 Finishing and curing modified concrete overlay will be measured by the square yard of
 overlay surface actually finished and cured.
 Further deck preparation for Type 1 deck repair and for Type 2 deck repair will be
 measured by the square foot of surface area of deck concrete removed in accordance with
 Section 6-09.3(6).

 Approval of the Contractor’s proposed wall construction details and methods shall not
 relieve the Contractor of their responsibility to construct the walls in accordance with the
 requirements of these Specifications.
 6-14.3(3)  Excavation and Foundation Preparation
 Excavation shall conform to Section 2-09.3(3). Foundations soils found to be unsuitable
 shall be removed and replaced in accordance with Section 2-09.3(1)C.
 The Contractor shall direct all surface runoff from adjacent areas away from the retaining
 wall construction site.
 6-14.3(4)  Erection and Backfill
 The Contractor shall begin wall construction at the lowest portion of the excavation and
 shall place each layer horizontally as shown in the Plans. The Contractor shall complete each
 layer entirely before beginning the next layer.
 Geotextile splices shall consist of a sewn seam or a minimum 1-foot overlap. Geogrid
 splices shall consist of adjacent geogrid strips butted together and fastened using hog rings,
 or other methods acceptable to the Engineer, in such a manner to prevent the splices from
 separating during geogrid installation and backfilling. Splices exposed at the wall face shall
 prevent loss of backfill material through the face. The splicing material exposed at the wall
 face shall be as durable and strong as the material to which the splices are tied. The Contractor
 shall offset geosynthetic splices in one layer from those in the other layers such that the splices
 shall not line up vertically. Splices parallel to the wall face will not be allowed, as shown in
 the Plans.
 The Contractor shall stretch out the geosynthetic in the direction perpendicular to the
 wall face to ensure that no slack or wrinkles exist in the geosynthetic prior to backfilling.
 For geogrids, the length of the reinforcement required as shown in the Plans shall be
 defined as the distance between the geosynthetic wrapped face and the last geogrid node at
 the end of the reinforcement in the wall backfill.
 The Contractor shall place fill material on the geosynthetic in lifts such that 6 inches
 minimum of fill material is between the vehicle or equipment tires or tracks and the
 geosynthetic at all times. The Contractor shall remove all particles within the backfill material
 greater than 3 inches in size. Turning of vehicles on the first lift above the geosynthetic will
 not be permitted. The Contractor shall not end dump fill material directly on the geosynthetic
 without the prior permission of the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall use a temporary form system to prevent sagging of the geosynthetic
 facing elements during construction. A typical example of a temporary form system and
 sequence of wall construction required when using this form are detailed in the Plans. Soil
 piles or the geosynthetic manufacturer’s recommended method, in combination with the
 forming system shall be used to hold the geosynthetic in place until the specified cover
 material is placed.
 The Contractor shall place and compact the wall backfill in accordance with the wall
 construction sequence detailed in the Plans and Method C of Section 2-03.3(14)C, except
 as follows:
 1.	 The maximum lift thickness after compaction shall not exceed 10 inches
 2.	 The Contractor shall decrease this lift thickness, if necessary, to obtain the
 specified density.

 3.	 Rollers shall have sufficient capacity to achieve compaction without causing
 distortion to the face of the wall in accordance with Section 6-14.3(1).
 4.	 The Contractor shall not use sheepsfoot rollers or rollers with protrusions.
 5.	 The Contractor shall compact the zone within 3 feet of the back of the wall facing
 panels without causing damage to or distortion of the wall facing elements (welded
 wire mats, backing mats, construction geotextile for wall facing, precast concrete
 facing panels, and concrete blocks) by using a plate compactor. No soil density tests
 will be taken within this area.
 6.	 For wall systems with geosynthetic reinforcement, the minimum compacted backfill lift
 thickness of the first lift above each geosynthetic reinforcement layer shall be 6 inches.
 The Contractor shall construct wall corners at the locations shown in the Plans, and in
 accordance with the wall corner construction sequence and method in the Working Drawing
 submittal. Wall angle points with an interior angle of less than 150 degrees shall be considered
 to be a wall corner. The wall corner shall provide a positive connection between the sections of
 the wall on each side of the corner such that the wall backfill material cannot spill out through
 the corner at any time during the design life of the wall. The Contractor shall construct the
 wall corner such that the wall sections on both sides of the corner attain the full geosynthetic
 layer embedment lengths shown in the Plans.
 Where required by retaining wall profile grade, the Contractor shall terminate top layers
 of retaining wall geosynthetic and backfill in accordance with the method in the Working
 Drawing submittal. The end of each layer at the top of the wall shall be constructed in a
 manner that prevents wall backfill material from spilling out the face of the wall throughout
 the life of the wall. If the profile of the top of the wall changes at a rate of 1:1 or steeper, this
 change in top of wall profile shall be considered to be a corner.
 6-14.3(5)  Guardrail Placement
 The Contractor shall install guardrail posts as shown in the Plans after completing the
 wall, but before the permanent facing is installed. The Contractor shall install the posts in
 a manner that prevents bulging of the wall face and prevents ripping, tearing, or pulling of
 the geosynthetic reinforcement. Holes through the geosynthetic reinforcement shall be the
 minimum size necessary for the post. The Contractor shall demonstrate to the Engineer prior
 to beginning guardrail post installation that the installation method will not rip, tear, or pull
 the geosynthetic reinforcement.
 6-14.3(6)  Permanent Facing
 The Contractor shall apply a permanent facing to the surface of all permanent geosynthetic
 retaining walls as shown in the Plans. Shotcrete facing, if shown in the Plans, shall conform to
 Section 6-18. Concrete fascia panel, if shown in the Plans, shall conform to Section 6-15.3(9),
 if cast-in-place, and shall conform to Section 6-02.3(28), if precast.
 6-14.3(7)  Geosynthetic Retaining Wall Traffic Barrier and Geosynthetic Retaining
 Wall Pedestrian Barrier
 Geosynthetic wall traffic barrier (single slope and f-shape) and geosynthetic retaining wall
 pedestrian barrier shall be constructed in accordance with Sections 6-02.3(11)A and 6-10.3(2),
 and the details in the Plans. The moment slab supporting the geosynthetic wall traffic barrier
 and geosynthetic wall pedestrian barrier shall be continuously wet cured for 3 days in
 accordance with Section 6-02.3(11).
 6-14.4 Measurement
 Permanent geosynthetic retaining wall and temporary geosynthetic retaining wall will be
 measured by the square foot of face of completed wall. Corner wrap area and extensions of the
 geosynthetic wall beyond the area of wall face shown in the Plans or staked by the Engineer
 are considered incidental to the wall construction and will not be included in the measurement

 Page 6-208
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Soil Nail Walls
 
 6-15
 
 The accuracy of the ground cut shall be such that the required thickness of shotcrete can be
 placed within a tolerance of plus or minus 2 inches from the defined face of the wall, and over
 excavation does not damage overlying shotcrete sections by undermining or other causes.
 The Contractor should review the geotechnical recommendations report prepared for this
 project for further information on the soil conditions at the location of each wall. Copies of
 the geotechnical recommendations report are available for review by prospective Bidders at
 the location identified in the Special Provisions.
 6-15.3(6)  Soil Nailing
 The Contractor shall not handle and transport the encapsulated soil nails until the
 encapsulation grout has reached sufficient strength to resist damage during handling.
 The Contractor shall handle the encapsulated soil nails in such a manner to prevent large
 deflections or distortions during handling. When handling or transporting encapsulated soil
 nails, the Contractor shall provide slings or other equipment necessary to prevent damage
 to the soil nails and the corrosion protection. The Engineer may reject any encapsulated nail
 which is damaged during transportation or handling. Damaged or defective encapsulation shall
 be repaired in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Soil nails shall be handled and sorted in such a manner as to avoid damage or corrosion.
 Prior to inserting a soil nail in the drilled hole, the Contractor and the Engineer will examine
 the soil nail for damage. If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the epoxy coating or bar has been
 damaged, the nail shall be repaired. If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the damage is beyond
 repair, the soil nail shall be rejected.
 If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the epoxy coating can be repaired, the Contractor shall
 patch the coating with an Engineer approved patching material.
 Nail holes shall be drilled at the locations shown in the Plans or as staked by the Engineer.
 The nails shall be positioned plus or minus 6 inches from the theoretical location shown in the
 Plans. The Contractor shall select the drilling method and the grouting pressure used for the
 installation of the soil nail. The drill hole shall be located so that the longitudinal axis of the
 drill hole and the longitudinal axis of the nail are parallel. At the point of entry the soil nail
 shall be installed within plus or minus 3 degrees of the inclination from horizontal shown in
 the Plans, and the nail shall be within plus or minus 3 degrees of a line drawn perpendicular
 to the face of the wall unless otherwise shown in the Plans.
 Water or other liquids shall not be used to flush cuttings during drilling, but air may be
 used. The nail shall be inserted into the drilled hole with centralizers to the desired depth in
 such a manner as to prevent damage to the drilled hole, sheathing or epoxy during installation.
 The centralizers shall provide a minimum of 0.5 inches of grout cover over the soil nail and
 shall be spaced no further than 8 feet apart. When the soil nail cannot be completely inserted
 into the drilled hole without difficulty, the Contractor shall remove the nail from the drilled
 hole and clean or redrill the hole to permit insertion. Partially inserted soil nails shall not be
 driven or forced into the hole. Subsidence, or any other detrimental impact from drilling shall
 be cause for immediate cessation of drilling and repair of all damages in a manner approved
 by the Engineer at no additional cost to the Contracting Agency.
 If caving conditions are encountered, no further drilling will be allowed until the
 Contractor selects a method to prevent ground movement. The Contractor may use temporary
 casing. The Contractor’s method to prevent ground movement shall be approved by the
 Engineer. The casings for the nail holes, if used, shall be removed as the grout is being placed.
 Where necessary for stability of the excavation face, a sealing layer of shotcrete may be
 placed before drilling is started, or the Contractor shall have the option of drilling and grouting
 of nails through a stabilizing berm of native soil at the face of the excavation. The stabilizing
 berm shall extend horizontally from the soil face and from the face of the shotcrete a minimum
 distance of 1 foot, and shall be cut down from that point at a safe slope, no steeper than 1H:1V
 unless approved by the Engineer. The berm shall be excavated to final grade after installation
 and full length grouting of the nails. Nails damaged during berm excavation shall be repaired

 Soil Nail Walls
 
 or replaced by the Contractor, to the satisfaction of the Engineer, at no added cost to the
 Contracting Agency.
 If sections of the wall are constructed at different times than the adjacent soil nail sections,
 the Contractor shall use stabilizing berms, temporary slopes, or other measures acceptable
 to the Engineer, to prevent sloughing or failure of the adjacent soil nail sections.
 If cobbles and boulders are encountered at the soil face during excavation, the Contractor
 shall remove all cobbles and boulders that protrude from the soil face into the design wall
 section and fill the void with shotcrete. All shotcrete used to fill voids created by removal of
 cobbles and boulders shall be incidental to shotcrete facing.
 The grout equipment shall produce a grout free of lumps and undispersed cement.
 A positive displacement grout pump shall be used. The pump shall be equipped with a
 pressure gauge near the discharge end to monitor grout pressures. The pressure gauge shall
 be capable of measuring pressures of at least 150 psi or twice the actual grout pressures used
 by the Contractor, whichever is greater. The grouting equipment shall be sized to enable the
 grout to be pumped in one continuous operation. The mixer shall be capable of continuously
 agitating the grout.
 The grout shall be injected from the lowest point of the drilled hole. The quantity of the
 grout and the grout pressures shall be recorded. The grout pressures and grout takes shall be
 controlled to prevent excessive ground heave.
 The Contractor shall make and cure grout cubes once per day in accordance with WSDOT
 T 813. These samples shall be retained by the Contractor until all associated verification and
 proof testing of the soil nails has been successfully completed. If the Contractor elects to
 test the grout cubes for compressive strength, testing shall be conducted by an independent
 laboratory and shall be in accordance with the FOP for AASHTO T106.
 6-15.3(7)  Shotcrete Facing
 Prior to placing any shotcrete on an excavated layer, the Contractor shall vertically
 center prefabricated drainage mat between the columns of nails as shown in the Plans.
 The prefabricated drainage mat shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 recommendations. The permeable drain side shall be placed against the exposed soil face.
 The prefabricated drainage mat shall be installed after each excavation lift and shall be
 hydraulically connected with the prefabricated drainage mat previously placed, such that the
 vertical flow of water is not impeded. The Contractor shall tape all joints in the prefabricated
 drainage mat to prevent shotcrete intrusion during shotcrete application.
 The Contractor shall place steel reinforcing bars and welded wire fabric, and apply the
 shotcrete facing in accordance with Section 6-18 and the details shown in the Plans.
 The shotcrete shall be constructed to the minimum thickness as shown in the Plans.
 Costs associated with additional thickness of shotcrete due to over excavation or irregularities
 in the cut face shall be borne by the Contractor.
 Each soil nail shall be secured at the shotcrete facing with a steel plate as shown in the
 Plans. The plate shall be seated on a wet grout pad of a pasty consistency similar to that of
 mortar for brick-laying. The nut shall then be sufficiently tightened to achieve full bearing
 surface behind the plate. After the shotcrete and grout have had time to gain the specified
 strength, the nut shall be tightened with at least 100 foot-pounds of torque.
 6-15.3(8)  Soil Nail Testing and Acceptance
 Both verification and proof testing of the nails is required. The Contractor shall supply
 all materials, equipment, and labor to perform the tests. The Contractor shall submit Type 1
 Working Drawings of all test data. Soil nails used for verification tests and proof tests shall
 not be production soil nails, but instead shall be separate sacrificial soil nails not otherwise
 incorporated into the Work.
 The testing equipment shall include a dial gauge or vernier scale capable of measuring
 to 0.001 inch of the ground anchor movement. A hydraulic jack and pump shall be used to
 Page 6-210
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Soil Nail Walls
 
 6-15
 
 apply the test load. The movement-measuring device shall have a minimum travel equal
 to the theoretical elastic elongation of the total nail length plus 1 inch. The dial gauge or
 vernier scale shall be aligned so that its axis is within 5 degrees from the axis of the nail
 and shall be monitored with a reference system that is independent of the jacking system
 and excavation face.
 The jack and pressure gauge shall be calibrated by an independent testing Laboratory as
 a unit. Each load cell, test jack and pressure gauge, grout pump stroke counter, and master
 gauge, shall be calibrated as specified in Section 6-15.3(3), item 4b. Additionally, the
 Contractor shall not use load cells, test jacks and pressure gauges, grout pump stroke counters,
 and master gauges, greater than 60 calendar days past their most recent calibration date, until
 such items are re-calibrated by an independent testing Laboratory.
 The pressure gauge shall be graduated in increments of either 100 psi or 2 percent of
 the maximum test load, whichever is less. The pressure gauge shall be selected to place the
 maximum test load within the middle ⅔ of the range of the gauge. The ram travel of the jack
 shall not be less than the theoretical elastic elongation of the total length at the maximum test
 load plus 1 inch. The jack shall be independently supported and centered over the nail so that
 the nail does not carry the weight of the jack. The Contractor shall have a second calibrated
 jack pressure gauge at the site. Calibration data shall provide a specific reference to the jack
 and the pressure gauge.
 The loads on the nails during the verification and proof tests shall be monitored to verify
 consistency of load – defined as maintaining the test load within 5 percent of the specified
 value. Verification and proof test loads less than 20,000 pounds or sustained for 5 minutes
 or less shall be monitored by the jack pressure gauge alone. Verification and proof test
 loads equal to or greater than 20,000 pounds and sustained for longer than 5 minutes shall
 be monitored with the assistance of an electric or hydraulic load cell. The Contractor shall
 provide the load cell, the readout device, and a calibration curve from  the most recent
 calibration as specified in Section 6-15.3(3), item 4b. The load cell shall be selected to place
 the maximum test load within the middle ⅔ of the range of the load cell. The load cell shall
 be mounted between the jack and the anchor plate. The stressing equipment shall be placed
 over the nail in such a manner that the jack bearing plates, load cell and stressing anchorage
 are in alignment.
 Nails to be tested shall be initially grouted no closer to the excavation face than the
 dimension shown in the Plans. After placing the grout, the nail shall remain undisturbed until
 the grout has reached strength sufficient to provide resistance during testing. Test nails shall
 be left in the ground after testing, with the exposed portion of the test nail cut and removed to
 2 feet behind the excavated face or inside face of shotcrete. The drill holes for test nails shall
 be completely backfilled with grout or nonstructural filler after testing on those test nails has
 been completed.
 Load testing shall be performed against a temporary reaction frame with bearing pads
 that bear directly against the existing soil or the shotcrete facing. Bearing pads shall be kept
 a minimum of 12 inches from the edges of the drilled hole and the load shall be distributed
 to prevent failure of the soil face or fracture of the shotcrete. The Contractor shall submit
 Type 2E Working Drawings of the reaction frame.
 The soil nail load monitoring procedure for verification and proof test load greater than
 20,000 pounds and sustained for longer than 5 minutes shall be as follows:
 1.	 For each increment of load, attainment of the load shall be initially established and
 confirmed by the reading taken from the jack gauge.
 2.	 Once the soil nail anchor load has been stabilized, based on the jack gauge reading,
 the load cell readout device shall immediately be read and recorded to establish the
 load cell reading to be used at this load. The load cell reading is intended only as a
 confirmation of a stable soil nail load, and shall not be taken as the actual load on
 the soil nail.

 Soil Nail Walls
 
 3.	 During the time period that the load on the soil nail is held at this load increment,
 the Contractor shall monitor the load cell reading. The Contractor shall adjust the
 jack pressure as necessary to maintain the initial load cell reading. Jack pressure
 adjustment for any other reason will not be allowed.
 4.	 Soil nail elongation measurements shall be taken at each load increment as specified in
 Sections 6-15.3(8)A and 6-15.3(8)B.
 5.	 Steps 1 through 4 shall be repeated at each increment of load, in accordance with the
 load sequence specified in Sections 6-15.3(8)A and 6-15.3(8)B.
 6-15.3(8)A  Verification Testing
 Verification testing shall be performed on nails installed within the pattern of production
 nails to verify the Contractor’s procedures, hole diameter, and design assumptions. No drilling
 or installation of production nails will be permitted in any ground/rock unit unless successful
 verification testing of anchors in that unit has been completed and approved by the Engineer,
 using the same equipment, methods, nail inclination, nail length, and hole diameter as planned
 for the production nails. Changes in the drilling or installation method may require additional
 verification testing as determined by the Engineer and shall be done at no additional expense
 to the Contracting Agency. Verification tests may be performed prior to excavation for the soil
 nail wall.
 Successful verification tests are required within the limits as specified in the Special
 Provisions. Test nail locations within these limits shall be at locations selected by the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall submit Type 2E Working Drawings consisting of design details of the
 verification testing, including the system for distributing test load pressures to the excavation
 surface and appropriate nail bar size and reaction plate. The intent is to stress the bond
 between the grout and the surrounding soil/rock to at least twice the design load transfer. Prior
 to beginning verification testing, the Contractor shall measure and record the length of the
 nonbonded zone for each verification test soil nail.
 The bar shall be proportioned such that the maximum stress at 200 percent of the test load
 does not exceed 80 percent of the yield strength of the steel. The jack shall be positioned at
 the beginning of the test such that unloading and repositioning of the jack during the test will
 not be required. The verification tests shall be made by incrementally loading the nails in
 accordance with the following schedule of hold time:
 	 AL	
 1 minute
 0.25TL	
 10 minutes
 0.50TL	
 10 minutes
 0.75TL

 1.25TL	
 10 minutes
 1.50TL	
 60 minutes
 1.75TL	
 10 minutes
 2.00TL	
 10 minutes
 AL = Nail Alignment Load
 TL = Nail Test Load
 The test load shall be determined by the following equation = Test Load (TL) = Bond
 Length (BL) × Design Load Transfer (DLT).
 The load shall be applied in increments of 25 percent of the test load. Each load increment
 shall be held for at least 10 minutes. Measurement of nail movement shall be obtained at each
 load increment. The load-hold period shall start as soon as the load is applied and the nail
 movement with respect to a fixed reference shall be measured and recorded at 1 minute, 2, 3,
 4, 5, 6, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes.
 The Engineer will evaluate the results of each verification test and make a determination
 of the suitability of the test and of the Contractor’s proposed production nail design and
 installation system. Tests that fail to meet the design criteria will require additional verification
 Page 6-212
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Soil Nail Walls
 
 6-15
 
 testing or an approved revision to the Contractor’s proposed production nail design and
 installation system. If a nail fails in creep, retesting will not be allowed.
 A verification tested nail with a 60-minute load hold at 1.50TL is acceptable if:
 1.	 The nail carries the test load with a creep rate that does not exceed 0.08 inch per log
 cycle of time and is at a linear or decreasing creep rate.
 2.	 The total movement at the test load exceeds 80 percent of the theoretical elastic
 elongation of the non-bonded length.
 Furthermore, a pullout failure shall not occur for the verification test anchor at the 2.0TL
 maximum load. Pullout failure load is defined as the load at which attempts to increase the test
 load result only in continued pullout movement of the test nail without a sustainable increase
 in the test load.
 6-15.3(8)B  Proof Testing
 Proof tests shall be performed on proof test soil nails installed within the pattern of the
 production soil nails at the locations shown in the Plans. Proof test soil nails shall be installed
 using the same equipment, methods, nail inclination, nail length, and hole diameter as for
 adjacent production nails. The Contractor shall maintain the side-wall stability of the drill
 hole for the non-grouted portion during the test. The bond length shall be determined from
 the Nail Schedule and Test Nail Detail shown in the Plans. Prior to beginning proof testing,
 the Contractor shall measure and record the length of the nonbonded zone for each proof test
 soil nail.
 Proof tests shall be performed by incrementally loading the nail in accordance with
 the schedule below. The anchor movement shall be measured and recorded to the nearest
 0.001 inch with respect to an independent fixed reference point in the same manner as for
 the verification tests at the alignment load and at each increment of load. The load shall
 be monitored in accordance with Section 6-15.3(8). The scheduling of hold times shall be
 as follows:
 	 AL	
 1 minute
 0.25TL	
 5 minutes
 0.50TL	
 5 minutes
 0.75TL	
 5 minutes
 1.00TL	
 5 minutes
 1.25TL	
 5 minutes
 1.50TL	
 10 minutes
 AL = Nail Alignment Load
 TL = Nail Test Load
 The maximum load in a proof test shall be held for 10 minutes. The load hold period
 shall start as soon as the maximum load is applied and the nail movement with respect to an
 independent fixed reference shall be measured and recorded at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 minutes.
 The nail movement between 1 and 10 minutes shall not exceed 0.04 inches. If the nail
 movement between 1 and 10 minutes exceeds 0.04 inches, the maximum load shall be held an
 additional 50 minutes. If the load hold is extended, the nail movement shall be recorded at 20,
 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes. If a nail fails in creep, retesting will not be allowed.
 A proof tested nail is acceptable if:
 1.	 The nail carries the maximum load with less than 0.04 inches of movement between
 1 and 10 minutes, unless the load hold extended to 60 minutes, in which case the nail
 would be acceptable if the creep rate does not exceed 0.08 inches per log cycle of time.
 2.	 The total movement at the maximum load exceeded 80 percent of the theoretical elastic
 elongation of the non-bonded length.
 3	 The creep rate is not increasing with time during the load hold period.
 If a proof test fails, the Engineer may direct the Contractor to replace some or all of the
 installed production nails between the failed test and an adjacent proof test nail that has met
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 6-213
 
 6-15
 
 Soil Nail Walls
 
 the test criteria. The Engineer may also require additional proof testing. All additional proof
 tests, and all installation of additional or modified nails, shall be performed at no additional
 expense to the Contracting Agency.
 6-15.3(9)  Concrete Fascia Panels
 The Contractor shall construct the concrete fascia panels in accordance with Section 6-02
 and the details in the Plans. The concrete fascia panels shall be cured in accordance with the
 Section 6-02.3(11) requirements specified for retaining walls. The Contractor shall provide the
 specified surface finish as noted, and to the limits shown, in the Plans to the exterior concrete
 surface. When noted in the Plans, the Contractor shall apply pigmented sealer to the limits
 shown in the Plans.

 No more than 2 inches of loose or disturbed material, for soldier piles with permanent
 ground anchors, nor more than 12 inches of loose or disturbed material, for soldier piles
 without permanent ground anchors, shall be present at the bottom of the shaft just prior to
 beginning concrete placement.
 The excavated shaft shall be inspected and receive acceptance by the Engineer prior to
 proceeding with construction.
 When obstructions are encountered, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer promptly.
 An obstruction is defined as a specific object (including, but not limited to, boulders, logs,
 and man made objects) encountered during the shaft excavation operation that prevents or
 hinders the advance of the shaft excavation. When efforts to advance past the obstruction
 to the design shaft tip elevation result in the rate of advance of the shaft drilling equipment
 being significantly reduced relative to the rate of advance for the rest of the shaft excavation,
 then the Contractor shall remove the obstruction under the provisions of Section 6-16.5.
 The method of removal of such obstructions, and the continuation of excavation shall be as
 proposed by the Contractor and approved by the Engineer.
 Excavation of shafts shall not commence until a minimum of 12 hours after the shaft
 backfill for the adjacent shafts has been placed.
 The temporary casings for the shafts shall be removed. A minimum 5-foot head of
 concrete shall be maintained to balance the soil and water pressure at the bottom of the
 casing. The casing shall be smooth.
 6-16.3(4)  Installing Soldier Piles
 Soldier piles, if spliced, shall conform to all requirements of Section 6-05.3(6).
 The prefabricated steel soldier piles shall be lowered into the drilled shafts and secured in
 position. Concrete cover over the soldier pile shall be 3 inches minimum, except that the cover
 over the soldier pile flange plate reinforcing at permanent ground anchor locations shall be
 1½ inches minimum.
 The steel soldier piles and attachments shall be shop painted after fabrication to the limits
 shown in the Plans with one coat of inorganic zinc primer. Application of the one coat of
 primer shall be in accordance with Section 6-07. The welded shear studs may be attached
 before or after painting. Paint damaged by welding shear studs in place does not require repair.
 6-16.3(5)  Backfilling Shaft
 The excavated shaft shall be backfilled with either controlled density fill (CDF), or
 pumpable lean concrete, as shown in the Plans and subject to the following requirements:
 1.	 Dry shaft excavations shall be backfilled with CDF.
 2.	 Wet shaft excavations shall be backfilled with pumpable lean concrete.
 3.	 Pumpable lean concrete shall be a Contractor designed mix providing a minimum
 28-day compressive strength of 100 psi. Acceptance of pumpable lean concrete will
 conform to the acceptance requirements specified in Section 2-09.3(1) for CDF.
 4.	 A wet shaft is defined as a shaft where water is entering the excavation and remains
 present to a depth of 6 inches or more.
 5.	 When the Plans or test hole boring logs identify the presence of a water table at
 or above the elevation of the bottom of soldier pile shaft, the excavation shall be
 considered as wet, except as otherwise noted. Such a shaft may be considered a dry
 shaft provided the Contractor furnishes and installs casing that is sufficiently sealed
 into competent soils such that water cannot enter the excavation.
 Placement of the shaft backfill shall commence immediately after completing the shaft
 excavation and receiving the Engineer’s approval of the excavation. CDF or pumpable lean
 concrete shall be placed in one continuous operation to the top of the shaft. Vibration of shaft
 backfill is not required.

 If water is not present, the shaft backfill shall be deposited by a method that prevents
 segregation of aggregates. The shaft backfill shall be placed such that the free-fall is vertical
 down the shaft without hitting the sides of the soldier pile or the excavated shaft. The
 Contractor’s method for depositing the shaft backfill shall have approval of the Engineer prior
 to the placement of the shaft backfill.
 If water is present, the shaft backfill shall be deposited in accordance with Section 6-02.3(6)B.
 6-16.3(6)  Designing and Installing Lagging and Installing Permanent Ground Anchors
 Lagging for soldier pile walls shall conform to one of the following two categories:
 1.	 Temporary lagging is defined as lagging that is in service as a structural member for a
 maximum of 36 months before a permanent load-carrying fascia is in place, except for
 the following exception: Lagging for soldier pile walls in site soils conforming to an
 excluded soil type as defined under Section 6-16.3(6)A will be classified as permanent
 lagging conforming to Section 6-16.3(6)C, in which case this requirement will be
 specified in the Plans along with design details for such lagging.
 2.	 Permanent lagging is defined as all lagging not conforming to the definition of
 temporary lagging as specified in category 1, above.
 6-16.3(6)A  Soil Classification
 For the purposes of designing lagging for soldier pile walls, soils shall be categorized in
 the classifications defined below.
 Soil Type 1
 The following shall be considered Type 1 soils:
 1.	 Cohesive fine-grained soils either CL or CH of medium consistency with γH/Su < 5.
 2.	 Cohesive fine-grained soils either CL or CH that are stiff to very stiff and nonfissured.
 3.	 Fine-grained soils either ML or SM-ML that are above the water table.
 4.	 Coarse-grained soils either GW, GP, GM, GC, SW, SP, or SM that are medium dense
 to dense.
 Soil Type 2
 The following shall be considered Type 2 soils:
 1.	 Cohesive fine-grained soils either CL or CH that are heavily overconsolidated
 and fissured.
 2.	 Fine-grained ML soils or coarse-grained SM-ML soils that are below the water table.
 3.	 Coarse-grained SC soil that is medium dense to dense and is below the water table.
 4.	 Coarse-grained soils either SW, SP, or SM that are loose.
 Soil Type 3
 The following shall be considered Type 3 soils:

 2.	 Fine-grained slightly plastic ML soil that is below the water table.
 3.	 Coarse-grained SC soil that is loose and below the water table.
 Exclusions
 Regardless of whether site soils conform to one of the soil types defined above, site
 soils under the following conditions are excluded from the Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3
 soil classifications:
 1.	 Disturbed soils such as those in landslides or known unstable areas.
 2.	 Layered soils dipping into the excavation steeper than 4H:1V.
 Lagging for soldier pile walls located in site soils excluded from the Type 1, Type 2,

 3.	 If the lagging material is to be removed during or after installation of the permanent
 fascia, a description of how the lagging is removed without disturbing or damaging the
 fascia, soldier piles, and retained soil, and a description of how, and with what material,
 the void left by the removal of lagging is to be filled.
 4.	 For all cases, except with timber for temporary lagging, a description with appropriate
 details of how subsurface drainage is to be accommodated, either in accordance with
 Section 6-16.3(7) for timber lagging, Section 6-15.3(7) for shotcrete facing, or other
 means appropriate for the geotechnical site conditions and acceptable to the Engineer
 for other lagging materials. Lagging materials and lagging installation methods that
 cause the buildup of, and prevent the relief of, pore water pressure will not be allowed.
 Free-draining materials are defined as those materials that exhibit a greater permeability
 than the material being retained.
 Temporary lagging may be untreated timber conforming to the Section 9-09.2 requirements
 specified under Structures for timber lagging or another material selected by the Contractor.
 Timber for temporary lagging shall conform to the minimum actual thickness specified
 in the table below for the soil type, exposed wall height, and lagging clear span as shown in
 the Plans.
 Notwithstanding the requirements of Section 1-06.1, steel materials used by the Contractor
 as temporary lagging may be salvaged steel provided that the use of such salvaged steel
 materials shall be subject to visual inspection and acceptance by the Engineer. For salvaged
 steel materials where the grade of steel cannot be positively identified, the design stresses for
 the steel shall conform to the Section 6-02.3(17)B requirements for salvaged steel, regardless
 of whether rivets are present or not.

 Section 6-16.3(6)B for the design of timber lagging for permanent lagging will not be allowed.
 6-16.3(6)D  Installing Lagging and Permanent Ground Anchors
 The excavation and removal of CDF and pumpable lean concrete for the lagging
 installation shall proceed in advance of the lagging and shall not begin until the CDF and
 pumpable lean concrete are of sufficient strength that the material remains in place during
 excavation and lagging installation. If the CDF or pumpable lean concrete separates from the
 soldier pile, or caves or spalls from around the soldier pile, the Contractor shall discontinue
 excavation and lagging installation operations until the CDF and pumpable lean concrete is

 6-17.3(5)  Tendon Fabrication
 The tendons can be either shop or field fabricated. The tendon shall be fabricated as shown
 in the shop plans.
 The Contractor shall select the type of tendon to be used. The tendon shall be sized so the
 factored design load does not exceed 80 percent of the minimum guaranteed ultimate tensile
 strength of the tendon. In addition, the tendon shall be sized so the maximum test load does
 not exceed 80 percent of the minimum guaranteed ultimate tensile strength of the tendon.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for determining the bond length and tendon bond
 length necessary to develop the factored design load indicated in the Plans in accordance with
 Sections 6-17.3(8)A, 6-17.3(8)B, and 6-17.3(8)C. The minimum bond length shall be 10 feet
 in rock and 15 feet in soil.
 When the Plans require the tendon bond length to be encapsulated, the tendon bond length
 portion of the tendon shall be corrosion protected by encapsulating the tendon in a grout-filled
 PE or PVC tube as specified in Section 6-17.2 as supplemented in the Special Provisions. The
 tendons can be grouted inside the encapsulation prior to inserting the tendon in the drill hole
 or after the tendon has been placed in the drill hole. Expansive admixtures can be mixed with
 the encapsulation grout if the tendon is grouted inside the encapsulation while outside the drill
 hole. The tendon shall be centralized within the bond length encapsulation with a minimum
 of 0.20 inches of grout cover. Spacers shall be used along the tendon bond length of multielement tendons to separate the elements of the tendon so the prestressing steel will bond to
 the encapsulation grout.
 Centralizers shall be used to provide a minimum of 0.5 inches of grout cover over the
 tendon bond length encapsulation. Centralizers shall be securely attached to the encapsulation
 and the center-to-center spacing shall not exceed 10 feet. In addition, the upper centralizer
 shall be located a maximum of 5 feet from the top of the tendon bond length and the lower
 centralizer shall be located a maximum of 1 foot from the bottom of the tendon bond length.
 The centralizer shall be able to support the tendon in the drill hole and position the tendon
 so a minimum of 0.5 inches of grout cover is provided and shall permit free flow of grout.
 Centralizers are not required on encapsulated, pressure-injected ground anchor tendons
 if the ground anchor is installed in coarse grained soils (more than 50 percent of the soil larger
 than the number 200 sieve) using grouting pressures greater than 150 psi.
 Centralizers are not required on encapsulated, hollow-stem-augered ground anchor tendons
 if the ground anchor is grouted through and the hole is maintained full of a stiff grout (8-inch
 slump or less) during extraction of the auger.
 The minimum unbonded length of the tendon shall be the greater of 15 feet or that
 indicated in the Plans.
 Corrosion protection of the unbonded length shall be provided by a sheath completely
 filled with corrosion inhibiting grease or grout. If grease is used under the sheath, provisions
 shall be made to prevent the grease from escaping at the ends of the sheath. The grease shall
 completely coat the tendon and fill the voids between the tendon and the sheath.
 If the sheath is not fabricated from a smooth tube, a separate bond breaker shall be
 provided. The bond breaker shall prevent the tendon from bonding to the anchor grout
 surrounding the tendon unbonded length.
 The total anchor length shall not be less than that indicated in the Plans or the approved
 Working Drawing submittal.
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 Permanent Ground Anchors
 
 Anchorage devices shall be capable of developing 95 percent of the minimum guaranteed
 ultimate tensile strength of the prestressing steel tendon. The anchorage devices shall conform
 to the static strength requirements of Section 3.1 of the Post Tensioning Institute Specification
 for Unbonded Single Strand Tendons, First Edition – 1993.
 Non-restressable anchorage devices may be used except where indicated in the Plans.
 Restressable anchorages shall be provided on those ground anchors that require reloading.
 The post-tensioning supplier shall provide a restressable anchorage compatible with the posttensioning system provided.
 The bearing plates shall be sized so the bending stresses in the plate do not exceed the
 yield strength of the steel when a load equal to 95 percent of the minimum guaranteed ultimate
 tensile strength of the tendon is applied, and the average bearing stress on the concrete does
 not exceed that recommended in Section 3.1.3 of the Post Tensioning Institute Specification
 for Unbonded Single Strand Tendons, First Edition – 1993.
 The trumpet shall have an inside diameter equal to or larger than the hole in the bearing
 plate. The trumpet shall be long enough to accommodate movements of the Structure during
 testing and stressing. For strand tendons with encapsulation over the unbonded length, the
 trumpet shall be long enough to enable the tendon to make a transition from the diameter or
 the tendon in the unbonded length to the diameter of the tendon at the anchor head without
 damaging the encapsulation. Trumpets filled with corrosion-inhibiting grease shall have
 a permanent rubber seal provided between the trumpet and the tendon unbonded length
 corrosion protection. Trumpets filled with grout shall have a temporary seal provided between
 the trumpet and the tendon unbonded length corrosion protection or the trumpet shall overlap
 the tendon unbonded length corrosion protection.
 6-17.3(6)  Tendon Storage and Handling
 Tendons shall be handled and stored in such a manner as to avoid damage or corrosion.
 Damage to the prestressing steel as a result of abrasions, cut, nicks, welds and weld splatter
 will be cause for rejection by the Engineer. The prestressing steel shall be protected if welding
 is to be performed in the vicinity. Grounding of welding leads to the prestressing steel is
 forbidden. Prestressing steel shall be protected from dirt, rust, and deleterious substances.
 A light coating of rust on the steel is acceptable. If heavy corrosion or pitting is noted, the
 Engineer will reject the affected tendons.
 The Contractor shall use care in handling and storing the tendons at the site. Prior to
 inserting a tendon in the drill hole, the Contractor and the Engineer will examine the tendon
 for damage to the encapsulation and the sheathing. If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the
 encapsulation is damaged, the Contractor shall repair the encapsulation in accordance with
 the tendon supplier’s recommendations and as approved by the Engineer. If, in the opinion
 of the Engineer, the smooth sheathing has been damaged, the Contractor shall repair it with
 ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (PE) tape. The tape shall be spiral wound around
 the tendon so as to completely seal the damaged area. The pitch of the spiral shall ensure a
 double thickness at all points.
 6-17.3(7)  Installing Permanent Ground Anchors
 The Contractor shall select the drilling method, the grouting procedure, and the grouting
 pressure used for the installation of the ground anchor.
 When caving conditions are encountered, no further drilling will be allowed until
 the Contractor selects a method to prevent ground movement. The Contractor may use a
 temporary casing. The Contractor’s method to prevent ground movement shall be submitted as
 a Type 2 Working Drawing. The casings for the anchor holes, if used, shall be removed. The
 drill hole shall be located so the longitudinal axis of the drill hole and the longitudinal axis
 of the tendon are parallel. The ground anchor shall not be drilled in a location that requires
 the tendon to be bent in order to enable the bearing plate to be connected to the supported
 Structure. At the point of entry the ground anchor shall be installed within plus or minus
 Page 6-226
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Permanent Ground Anchors
 
 6-17
 
 3 degrees of the inclination from horizontal shown in the Plans or the Working Drawing
 submittal. The ground anchors shall not extend beyond the Right of Way limits.
 The tendon shall be inserted into the drill hole to the desired depth. When the tendon
 cannot be completely inserted without difficulty, the Contractor shall remove the tendon from
 the drill hole and clean or redrill the hole to permit insertion. Partially inserted tendons shall
 not be driven or forced into the hole.
 The Contractor shall use a grout conforming to Section 6-17.2 as supplemented in the
 Special Provisions.
 The grout equipment shall produce a grout free of lumps and undispersed cement.
 A positive displacement grout pump shall be used. The pump shall be equipped with a
 pressure gauge near the discharge end to monitor grout pressures. The pressure gauge shall
 be capable of measuring pressures of at least 150 psi or twice the actual grout pressures used
 by the Contractor, whichever is greater. The grouting equipment shall be sized to enable the
 grout to be pumped in one continuous operation. The mixer shall be capable of continuously
 agitating the grout.
 The grout shall be injected from the lowest point of the drill hole. The grout may be
 pumped through grout tubes, casing, or drill rods. The grout can be placed before or after
 insertion of the tendon. The quantity of the grout and the grout pressures shall be recorded.
 The grout pressures and grout takes shall be controlled to prevent excessive heave in soils
 or fracturing of rock formations.
 The Contractor shall make and cure grout cubes once per day in accordance with WSDOT
 T 813. These samples shall be retained by the Contractor until all associated verification,
 performance and proof testing of the permanent ground anchors has been successfully
 completed. If the Contractor elects to test the grout cubes for compressive strength, testing
 shall be conducted by an independent laboratory and shall be in accordance with the FOP for
 AASHTO T 106.
 After grouting, the tendon shall not be loaded for a minimum of 3 days.
 No grout shall be placed above the top of the bond length during the time the bond
 length grout is placed. The grout at the top of the drill hole shall not contact the back of the
 Structure or the bottom of the trumpet. Except as otherwise noted, only nonstructural filler
 shall be placed above the bond length grout prior to testing and acceptance of the anchor.
 The Contractor may place structural grout above the bond length grout prior to testing and
 acceptance of the anchor subject to the following conditions:
 1.	 The anchor unbonded length shall be increased by 8 feet minimum.
 2.	 The grout in the unbonded zone shall not be placed by pressure grouting methods.
 The corrosion protection surrounding the unbonded length of the tendon shall extend up
 beyond the bottom seal of the trumpet or 1 foot into the trumpet if no trumpet seal is provided.
 If the protection does not extend beyond the seal or sufficiently far enough into the trumpet,
 the Contractor shall extend the corrosion protection or lengthen the trumpet.
 The corrosion protection surrounding the no load zone length of the tendon shown in the
 Plans shall not contact the bearing plate or the anchor head during testing and stressing. If the
 protection is too long, the Contractor shall trim the corrosion protection to prevent contact.
 The bearing plate and anchor head shall be placed so the axis of the tendon and the drill
 hole are both perpendicular to the bearing plate within plus or minus 3 degrees and the axis of
 the tendon passes through the center of the bearing plate at the intersection of the trumpet and
 the bearing plate when fully seated with the alignment load.
 The trumpet shall be completely filled with corrosion inhibiting grease or grout. Trumpet
 grease can be placed anytime during construction. Trumpet grout shall be placed after the
 ground anchor has been tested. The Contractor shall demonstrate to the Engineer that the
 procedure selected by the Contractor for placement of either grease or grout produces a
 completely filled trumpet.

 6-17
 
 Permanent Ground Anchors
 
 All anchorages permanently exposed to the atmosphere shall be covered with a corrosion
 inhibiting grease-filled or grout-filled cover. The Contractor shall demonstrate to the Engineer
 that the procedures selected by the Contractor for placement of either grease or grout produces
 a completely filled cover. If the Plans require restressable anchorages, corrosion inhibiting
 grease shall be used to fill the anchorage cover and trumpet.
 6-17.3(8)  Testing and Stressing
 Each ground anchor shall be tested. The test load shall be simultaneously applied to the
 entire tendon. Stressing of single elements of multi-element tendons will not be permitted.
 The Engineer will record test data.
 The testing equipment shall consist of a dial gauge or vernier scale capable of measuring
 to 0.001 inch and shall be used to measure the ground anchor movement. The movementmeasuring device shall have a minimum travel equal to the theoretical elastic elongation of
 the total anchor length plus 1 inch. The dial gauge or vernier scale shall be aligned so that
 its axis is within 5 degrees from the axis of the tieback. A hydraulic jack and pump shall be
 used to apply the test load. The jack and pressure gauge shall be calibrated by an independent
 testing Laboratory as a unit. Each load cell, test jack and pressure gauge, and master pressure
 gauge, shall be calibrated as specified in Section 6-17.3(3). Additionally, the Contractor shall
 not use load cells, test jacks and pressure gauges, and master pressure gauges, greater than
 60 calendar days past their most recent calibration date, until such items are re-calibrated by
 an independent testing Laboratory.
 The pressure gauge shall be graduated in increments of either 100 psi or 2 percent of
 the maximum test load, whichever is less. The pressure gauge will be used to measure the
 applied load. The pressure gauge shall be selected to place the maximum test load within
 the middle ⅔ of the range of the gauge. The ram travel of the jack shall not be less than the
 theoretical elastic elongation of the total anchor length at the maximum test load plus 1 inch.
 The jack shall be independently supported and centered over the tendon so that the tendon
 does not carry the weight of the jack. The Contractor shall have a second calibrated jack
 pressure gauge at the site. Calibration data shall provide a specific reference to the jack and
 the pressure gauge.
 The loads on the tiebacks during the performance and verification tests shall be monitored
 to verify consistency of load as defined in Section 6-17.3(1). Performance test loads, and
 verification test loads when specified in the Special Provisions, sustained for 5 minutes or less,
 and all proof test leads, shall be monitored by the jack pressure gauge alone. Performance test
 loads, and verification test loads when specified in the Special Provisions, sustained for longer
 than 5 minutes shall be monitored with the assistance of an electric or hydraulic load cell.
 The Contractor shall provide the load cell and a readout device. The load cell shall be mounted
 between the jack and the anchor plate. The load cell shall be selected to place the maximum
 test load within the middle ⅔ of the range of the load cell. The stressing equipment shall be
 placed over the ground anchor tendon in such a manner that the jack, bearing plates, load cell
 and stressing anchorage are in alignment.
 The permanent ground anchor load monitoring procedure for performance test loads, and
 verification test loads when specified in the Special Provisions, sustained for longer than
 5 minutes shall be as follows:
 1.	 For each increment of load, attainment of the load shall be initially established and
 confirmed by the reading taken from the jack gauge.
 2.	 Once the permanent ground anchor load has been stabilized, based on the jack gauge
 reading, the load cell readout device shall immediately be read and recorded to establish
 the load cell reading to be used at this load. The load cell reading is intended only as
 a confirmation of a stable permanent ground anchor load, and shall not be taken as the
 actual load on the permanent ground anchor.

 3.	 During the time period that the load on the permanent ground anchor is held at this
 load increment, the Contractor shall monitor the load cell reading. The Contractor
 shall adjust the jack pressure as necessary to maintain the initial load cell reading.
 Jack pressure adjustment for any other reason will not be allowed.
 4.	 Permanent ground anchor elongation measurements shall be taken at each load
 increment as specified in Sections 6-17.3(8)A and 6-17.3(8)B.
 5.	 Steps 1 through 4 shall be repeated at each increment of load, in accordance with the
 load sequence specified in Sections 6-17.3(8)A and 6-17.3(8)B.
 6-17.3(8)A  Verification Testing
 Verification tests will be required only when specified in the Special Provisions.
 6-17.3(8)B  Performance Testing
 Performance tests shall be done in accordance with the following procedures. Five percent
 of the ground anchors or a minimum of three ground anchors, whichever is greater, shall be
 performance tested. The Engineer shall select the ground anchors to be performance tested.
 The first production anchor shall be performance tested.
 The performance test shall be made by incrementally loading and unloading the ground
 anchor in accordance with the following schedule, consistent with the Load Resistance Factor
 Design (LRFD) design method. The load shall be raised from one increment to another
 immediately after a deflection reading.

 shotcrete is found to be unsuitable based on the results of the test panels, the section(s) of
 the wall represented by the test panel(s) shall be repaired or replaced to the satisfaction of
 the Engineer at no additional cost to the Contracting Agency. Core acceptance testing for
 the 28‑day compressive strength will be performed in accordance with AASHTO T 24.
 6-18.3(4)  Qualifications of Contractor’s Personnel
 All nozzle operators shall have had at least 1 year of experience in the application of
 shotcrete. Each nozzle operator will be qualified, by the Engineer, to place shotcrete, after
 successfully completing one test panel for each shooting position and surface type which will
 be encountered.
 Qualification will be based on a visual inspection of the shotcrete density, void structure,
 and finished appearance along with a minimum 7-day compressive strength of 2,500 psi
 determined from the average test results from two cores taken from each test panel. The 7-day
 core compressive strength shall be tested by the Contractor in accordance with AASHTO T 24.
 The Contractor shall notify the Engineer not less than 2 days prior to the shooting of a
 qualification panel. The mix design for the shotcrete shall be the same as that slated for the
 wall being shot.
 Shotcrete shall be placed only by personnel qualified by the Engineer.

 Shotcrete Facing
 
 6-18.3(7)  Shotcrete Application
 A clean, dry supply of compressed air sufficient for maintaining adequate nozzle velocity
 for all parts for the Work and for simultaneous operation of a blow pipe for cleaning away
 rebound shall be maintained at all times. Thickness, method of support, air pressure, and
 rate of placement of shotcrete shall be controlled to prevent sagging or sloughing of freshly
 applied shotcrete.
 The shotcrete shall be applied from the lower part of the area upwards. Surfaces to be shot
 shall be damp, but free of standing water.
 The nozzles shall be held at an angle approximately perpendicular to the working face
 and at a distance that will keep rebound at a minimum and compaction will be maximized.
 Shotcrete shall emerge from the nozzle in a steady uninterrupted flow. If, for any reason,
 the flow becomes intermittent, the nozzle shall be diverted from the Work until a steady
 flow resumes.
 Surface defects shall be repaired as soon as possible after initial placement of the
 shotcrete. All shotcrete which lacks uniformity; which exhibits segregation, honeycombing, or
 lamination; or which contains any dry patches, slugs, voids, or sand pockets, shall be removed
 and replaced with fresh shotcrete by the Contractor, to the satisfaction of the Engineer at no
 cost to the Contracting Agency.
 Construction joints in the shotcrete shall be uniformly tapered over a minimum distance
 of twice the thickness of the shotcrete layer. The surface of the joints shall be cleaned and
 thoroughly wetted before adjacent shotcrete is placed. Shotcrete shall be placed in a manner
 that provides a finish with uniform texture and color across the construction joint.
 The shotcrete shall be cured by applying a clear curing compound in accordance with
 Section 9-23.2. The curing compound shall be applied immediately after final gunning. Two
 coats of curing compound shall be applied to the shotcrete surface immediately after finishing.
 When shotcrete is specified in the Plans as the final fascia finish, the curing requirements
 specified in Section 6-02.3(11) shall apply.
 If field inspection or testing, by the Engineer, indicates that any shotcrete produced, fails
 to meet the requirements, the Contractor shall immediately modify procedures, equipment,
 or system, as necessary to produce Specification Material. All substandard shotcrete already
 placed shall be repaired by the Contractor, to the satisfaction of the Engineer, at no additional
 cost to the Contracting Agency. Such repairs may include removal and replacement of all
 affected materials.
 6-18.3(8)  Shotcrete Finishing
 When the shotcrete facing is an interim coating to be covered by a subsequent shotcrete
 coating or a cast-in-place concrete fascia later under the same Contract, the Contractor
 shall strike off the surface of the shotcrete facing with a roughened surface as specified in
 Section 6-02.3(12). The grooves of the roughened surface shall be either vertical or horizontal.
 When the shotcrete facing provides the finished exposed final surface, the shotcrete face
 shall be finished using the alternative aesthetic treatment shown in the Plans. The alternatives
 are as follows:
 •	 Alternative A – After the surface has taken its initial set (crumbling slightly when cut),
 the surface shall be broom finished to secure a uniform surface texture.
 •	 Alternative B – Shotcrete shall be applied in a thickness a fraction beyond the alignment
 wires and forms. The shotcrete shall stiffen to the point where the surface does not pull
 or crack when screeded with a rod or trowel. Excess material shall be trimmed, sliced,
 or scraped to true lines and grade. Alignment wires shall be removed and the surface
 shall receive a steel trowel finish, leaving a smooth uniform texture and color. Once the
 shotcrete has cured, pigmented sealer shall be applied to the shotcrete face. The shotcrete
 surface shall be completed to within a tolerance of ½ inch of true line and grade.
 
 Page 6-234
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Shotcrete Facing
 
 6-18
 
 •	 Alternative C – Shotcrete shall be hand-sculptured, colored, and textured to simulate
 the relief, jointing, and texture of the natural backdrop surrounding the facing. The
 ends and base of the facing shall transition in appearance as appropriate to more nearly
 match the color and texture of the adjoining Roadway fill slopes. This may be achieved
 by broadcasting fine and coarse aggregates, rocks, and other native materials into the
 final surface of the shotcrete while it is still wet, allowing sufficient embedment into
 the shotcrete to become a permanent part of the surface.
 6-18.4 Measurement
 Shotcrete facing will be measured by the square foot surface area of the completed facing
 measured to the neat lines of the facing as shown in the Plans.
 6-18.5 Payment
 Payment will be made for each of the following Bid items when they are included in the
 Proposal:
 “Shotcrete Facing”, per square foot.
 All costs in connection with constructing shotcrete facing as specified shall be included in
 the unit Contract price per square foot for “Shotcrete Facing” including all steel reinforcing
 bars, premolded joint filler, polyethylene bond breaker strip, joint sealant, PVC pipe for weep
 holes, exterior surface finish, and pigmented sealer (when specified).

 only for casing splicing, tooling changes, slurry maintenance, and removal of obstructions.
 Shaft excavation operation interruptions not conforming to this definition shall be considered
 stops. Stops for uncased excavations (including partially cased excavations) shall not exceed
 16 hours duration. Stops for fully cased excavations, excavations in rock, and excavations
 with casing seated into rock, shall not exceed 65 hours duration.
 For stops exceeding the time durations specified above, the Contractor shall stabilize the
 excavation using one or both of the following methods:
 1.	 For an uncased excavation, before the end of the work day, install casing in the hole
 to the depth of the excavation. The outside diameter of the casing shall not be smaller
 than 6 inches less than either the plan diameter of the shaft or the actual excavated
 diameter of the hole, whichever is greater. Prior to removing the casing and resumption
 of shaft excavation, the annular space between the casing and the excavation shall
 be sounded. If the sounding operation indicates that caving has occurred, the casing

 shall not be removed and shaft excavation shall not resume until the Contractor has
 stabilized the excavation in accordance with the shaft installation narrative conforming
 to Section 6-19.3(2)B, item 3.
 2.	 For both a cased and uncased excavation, backfill the hole with either CDF or granular
 material. The Contractor shall backfill the hole to the ground surface, if the excavation
 is not cased, or to a minimum of 5 feet above the bottom of casing (temporary or
 permanent), if the excavation is cased. Backfilling of shafts with casing fully seated
 into rock, as determined by the Engineer, will not be required.
 During stops, the Contractor shall stabilize the shaft excavation to prevent bottom heave,
 caving, head loss, and loss of ground. The Contractor bears full responsibility for selection and
 execution of the method(s) of stabilizing and maintaining the shaft excavation, in accordance
 with Section 1-07.13. Shaft stabilization shall conform to the shaft installation narrative in
 accordance with Section 6-19.3(2)B, item 3.
 If slurry is present in the shaft excavation, the Contractor shall conform to the requirements
 of Section 6-19.3(4)B of this Special Provision regarding the maintenance of the slurry
 and the minimum level of drilling slurry throughout the stoppage of the shaft excavation
 operation, and shall recondition the slurry to the required slurry properties in accordance with

 Permanent casing is defined as casing designed as part of the shaft structure and installed to
 remain in place after construction is complete. All permanent casing shall be of ample strength
 to resist damage and deformation from transportation and handling, installation stresses, and
 all pressures and forces acting on the casing. Where the minimum thickness of permanent
 casing is specified in the Plans, it is specified to satisfy structural design requirements only.
 The Contractor shall increase the casing thickness as necessary to satisfy the requirements of
 this section.
 6-19.3(3)B3  Temporary Shaft Casing
 Temporary casing is defined as casing installed to facilitate shaft construction only, which
 is not designed as part of the shaft structure, and which shall be completely removed after
 shaft construction is complete unless otherwise shown in the Plans. All temporary casing
 shall be of ample strength to resist damage and deformation from transportation and handling,
 installation and extraction stresses, and all pressures and forces acting on the casing. The
 casing shall be capable of being removed without deforming and causing damage to the
 completed shaft and without disturbing the surrounding soil.

 reinforcement cage installation and concrete placement operations in the shaft excavation.
 After completing shaft reinforcement cage fabrication at the site and prior to installation
 of the cage into the shaft excavation, the Contractor shall install and connect thermal access
 points (TAPs) to the thermal wires. The TAPs shall record data for at least one hour after the
 cage is placed in the excavation to measure the slurry temperature and enable the steel and
 slurry temperatures to equilibrate prior to placing concrete in the shaft. The TAPs shall record
 and store data every 15 minutes. The TAPs shall remain active for a minimum of 36 hours.
 Prior to beginning concrete placement the TAPs shall be checked to ensure they are
 recording data and that the wires have not been damaged. If a TAP unit is not functioning
 due to a damaged wire, the Contractor shall repair or replace the wire. If a TAP unit fails or
 a wire breaks after concrete placement has started, the Contractor shall not stop the concrete
 placement operation to repair the wire.

 used and removed with a vibratory hammer during the concrete placement operation. Vibration
 of concrete does not affect the maximum slump allowed for the concrete class specified.
 6-19.3(7)D  Requirements for Placing Concrete Underwater
 When placing concrete underwater, including when water in a shaft excavation exceeds
 3 inches in depth, the Contractor shall place the concrete by pressure feed using a concrete
 pump, with a watertight tube having a minimum diameter of 4 inches. The discharge end of
 the tube on the concrete pump shall include a device to seal out water while the tube is first
 filled with concrete. Alternatively, the Contractor may use a plug that is inserted at the hopper
 of the concrete pump and travels through the tremie to keep the concrete separated from the
 water and slurry. Concrete placement by gravity feed is not allowed.
 Throughout the underwater concrete placement operation, the discharge end of the tube
 shall remain submerged in the concrete at least 5 feet and the tube shall always contain enough
 concrete to prevent water from entering. The concrete placement shall be continuous until the
 work is completed, resulting in a seamless, uniform shaft.
 6-19.3(7)E  Testing and Repair of Shaft Concrete Placed Underwater
 If the underwater concrete placement operation is interrupted, the Engineer may require the
 Contractor to prove by core drilling or other tests that the shaft contains no voids or horizontal
 joints. If testing reveals voids or joints, the Contractor shall repair them or replace the shaft at
 no expense to the Contracting Agency. Responsibility for coring costs, and calculation of time
 extension, shall be in accordance with Section 6-19.3(9)H.
 6-19.3(7)F  Cleaning and Removal of Previously Placed Shaft Concrete

 7-08.3  Construction Requirements
 7-08.3(1)  Excavation and Preparation of Trench
 7-08.3(1)A  Trenches
 The length of trench excavation in advance of pipe laying shall be kept to a minimum.
 Excavations shall either be closed up at the end of the day or protected per Section 1-07.23(1).
 The trench width shall be as specified in Section 2-09.4 and shall be excavated to the depth
 and grade as staked by the Engineer.
 Trenches must be of sufficient width in the pipe zone to permit proper installation and
 bedding of the pipe and to provide the required compaction of backfill. Above the top of the
 pipe zone, the Contractor may excavate to any width.
 All ledgerock, boulders, and stones shall be removed to provide a minimum of 6 inches
 clearance under all portions of the pipe.
 Placement of bedding material shall precede the installation of all pipe. This shall include
 necessary leveling of the native trench bottom or the top of the foundation material as well as
 placement and compaction of required bedding material to a uniform grade so that the entire
 length of pipe will be supported on a uniformly dense unyielding foundation.
 When, after excavating to the foundation level, the material remaining in the trench
 bottom is determined to be unsuitable by the Engineer, excavation shall be continued to such
 additional depth and width as required by the Engineer. Unsuitable foundation materials shall
 be disposed of at an approved site. The trench foundation shall be backfilled to the bottom of
 the pipe zone with gravel backfill for foundations, gravel backfill for pipe zone bedding, or
 other suitable material, and compacted to form a uniformly dense, unyielding foundation.
 All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench shall be maintained
 so that the toe of the slope is at least 2 feet from the edge of the trench. It shall be piled to
 cause a minimum of inconvenience to public travel, and provision shall be made for merging
 traffic where necessary. Free access shall be provided to all fire hydrants, water valves, and
 meters; and clearance shall be left to enable free flow of storm water in gutters, conduits, or
 natural watercourses.
 If any part of the excavated material meets the Specifications of Section 9-03.12(3), the
 Engineer may require that such material, in the quantity required, be selectively removed,
 stockpiled separately, and used as pipe bedding instead of quantities of gravel backfill for
 pipe zone bedding. If material so stockpiled becomes contaminated, the Contractor shall
 furnish suitable material in an amount equal to that lost by contamination at no expense to
 the Contracting Agency. All costs involved in storing, protecting, re-handling, and placing
 the material shall be included in other items of Work on the project.
 Excavation for manholes and other Structures connected to the pipelines shall be sufficient
 to provide a minimum of 12 inches between their surfaces and the sides of the excavation.
 The Contractor shall furnish, install, and operate all necessary equipment to keep
 excavations above the foundation level free from water during construction, and shall dewater
 and dispose of the water so as not to cause injury to public or private property or nuisance
 to the public. Sufficient pumping equipment in good working condition shall be available at
 all times for all emergencies, including power outage, and shall have available at all times
 competent workers for the operation of the pumping equipment.

 Where pipe is to be placed in a new embankment, the embankment shall be constructed
 as shown in the Plans or as designated by the Engineer for a distance each side of the pipe
 location of not less than five times the diameter and to a minimum height equal to ½ of the
 outside diameter of the pipe. The embankment material shall be compacted to 95 percent
 of maximum density and the moisture content at the time of compaction shall be between
 optimum and 3 percentage points below optimum as determined by the Compaction Control
 Tests specified in Section 2-03.3(14)D. The trench shall then be excavated to a width as
 specified in Section 2-09.4, and the pipe installed in accordance with the Standard Plans.
 7-08.3(1)B  Shoring
 The Contractor shall provide all materials, labor, and equipment necessary to shore
 trenches to protect the Work, existing property, utilities, pavement, etc., and to provide safe
 working conditions in the trench. The Contractor may elect to use any combination of shoring
 and overbreak, tunneling, boring, sliding trench shield, or other method of accomplishing the
 Work consistent with applicable local, State, or Federal safety codes.
 If workers enter any trench or other excavation 4 feet or more in depth that does not meet
 the open pit requirements of Section 2-09.3(3)B, it shall be shored. The Contractor alone shall
 be responsible for worker safety, and the Contracting Agency assumes no responsibility.
 Upon completing the Work, the Contractor shall remove all shoring unless the Plans or the
 Engineer direct otherwise.
 Shoring to be removed, or moveable trench shields or boxes, shall be located at least
 2½ pipe diameters away from metal or thermoplastic pipe if the bottom of the shoring, shield,
 or box extends below the top of the pipe, unless a satisfactory means of reconsolidating the
 bedding or side support material disturbed by shoring removal can be demonstrated.
 Damages resulting from improper shoring or failure to shore shall be the sole responsibility
 of the Contractor.
 7-08.3(1)C  Bedding the Pipe
 Pipe zone bedding material shall provide uniform support along the entire pipe barrel,
 without load concentration at joint collars or bells. All adjustment to line and grade shall be
 made by scraping away or filling in with bedding material under the body of the pipe and
 not by blocking or wedging. Bedding disturbed by pipe movement, or by removal of shoring
 movement of a trench shield or box, shall be reconsolidated prior to backfill.
 Pipe zone bedding shall be as specified in the Standard Plans and shall be placed in loose
 layers and compacted to 90 percent maximum density. Bedding shall be placed, spread, and
 compacted before the pipe is installed so that the pipe is uniformly supported along the barrel.
 Lifts of not more than 6 inches in thickness shall be placed and compacted along the sides of
 the pipe to the height shown in the Standard Plans. Material shall be worked carefully under
 the pipe haunches and then compacted.
 If the Engineer determines that the material existing in the bottom of the trench is
 satisfactory for bedding the pipe, the bedding material specified in the Standard Plans is not
 required, provided the existing material is loosened, regraded, and compacted to form a dense,
 unyielding base.
 7-08.3(2)  Laying Pipe
 7-08.3(2)A  Survey Line and Grade
 Survey line and grade control hubs will be placed in a manner consistent with accepted
 practices.
 The Contractor shall transfer line and grade into the trench where they shall be carried by
 means of a laser beam or taut grade line supported on firmly set batter boards at intervals of
 not more than 30 feet. Not less than three batter boards shall be in use at one time. Grades
 shall be constantly checked and in the event the batter boards do not line up, the Work shall
 be immediately stopped, the Engineer notified, and the cause remedied before proceeding
 with the Work. Any other procedure shall have the written approval of the Engineer.

 General Pipe Installation Requirements
 
 7-08.3(2)B  Pipe Laying – General
 After an accurate grade line has been established, the pipe shall be laid in conformity with
 the established line and grade in the properly dewatered trench. Mud, silt, gravel, and other
 foreign material shall be kept out of the pipe and off the jointing surfaces.
 All pipe laid in the trench to the specified line and grade shall be kept in longitudinal
 compression until the backfill has been compacted to the crown of the pipe. All pipe shall
 be laid to conform to the prescribed line and grade shown in the Plans, within the limits
 that follow.
 Pipe shall be laid to a true line and grade at the invert of the pipe and the Contractor shall
 exercise care in matching pipe joints for concentricity and compatibility. In no case shall two
 pipes be joined together with ends having the maximum manufacturer’s tolerance. The invert
 line may vary from the true line and grade within the limits stated to develop uniformity,
 concentricity, and uniform compression of jointing material provided such variance does not
 result in a reverse sloping invert. The limit of the variance at the invert shall not exceed plus
 or minus 0.03 feet at the time of backfill. Checking of the invert elevation of the pipe may
 be made by calculations from measurements on the top of the pipe.
 The pipe, unless otherwise approved by the Engineer, shall be laid up grade from point
 of connection on the existing pipe or from a designated starting point. The pipe shall be
 installed with the bell end forward or upgrade. When pipe laying is not in progress, the
 forward end of the pipe shall be kept tightly closed with an approved temporary plug.
 Where pipe joints must be deflected within the manufacturer’s recommended limits
 to accommodate required horizontal or vertical curvature, it shall first be joined in straight
 alignment and then deflected as required.
 Where pipe joints must be deflected to an amount greater than the manufacturer’s
 recommended limits to accommodate required horizontal or vertical curvature, the curves
 shall be achieved with a series of tangents and shop fabricated bends, subject to the approval
 of the Engineer.
 Upon final acceptance of the Work, all pipe and appurtenances shall be open, clean, and
 free draining.
 7-08.3(2)C  Pipe Laying – Concrete
 For concrete pipe with elliptical reinforcement, the markings indicating the minor axis
 of the reinforcement shall be placed in a vertical plane (top or bottom) when the pipe is laid.
 7-08.3(2)D  Pipe Laying – Steel or Aluminum
 Pipe with riveted or resistance spot welded seams shall be laid in the trench with the
 outside laps of circumferential joints upgrade and with longitudinal laps positioned other
 than in the invert, and firmly joined together with approved bands.
 Aluminum pipe or pipe arch used in cement concrete shall be painted with two coats of
 paint. The paint shall cover all the surfaces in contact with the cement concrete and extend
 one inch beyond the point of contact. The aluminum pipe to be painted shall be cleaned with
 solvent to remove contaminants. After cleaning, the pipe shall be painted with two coats of
 paint conforming to Federal Specification TT-P-645 (primer, paint, zinc chromate, alkyd
 vehicle). Aluminized steel pipe will not require painting when placed in Controlled Density
 Fill (CDF) or when in contact concrete head walls.
 All costs of cleaning and painting the aluminum surfaces as specified shall be included in
 the unit Contract price per linear foot for the aluminum pipe or pipe arch.
 7-08.3(2)E  Rubber Gasketed Joints
 In laying pipe with rubber gaskets, the pipe shall be handled carefully to avoid knocking
 the gasket out of position or contaminating it with foreign material. Any gasket so disturbed
 shall be removed, cleaned, relubricated if required, and replaced before joining the sections.
 
 Page 7-26
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 General Pipe Installation Requirements
 
 7-08
 
 The pipe shall be properly aligned before joints are forced home. Sufficient pressure shall
 be applied in making the joint to ensure that the joint is home, as defined in the standard
 installation instructions provided by the pipe manufacturer. The Contractor may use any
 method acceptable to the Engineer for pulling the pipe together, except that driving or
 ramming by hand or machinery will not be permitted. Any pipe damaged during joining and
 joint tightening shall be removed and replaced at no expense to the Contracting Agency.
 Care shall be taken to properly align the pipe before joints are entirely forced home. During
 insertion of the tongue or spigot, the pipe shall be partially supported by hand, sling or crane
 to minimize unequal lateral pressure on the gasket and to maintain concentricity until the
 gasket is properly positioned. Since most gasketed joints tend to creep apart when the end of
 the pipe is deflected and straightened, such movement shall be held to a minimum once the
 joint is home.
 Sufficient restraint shall be applied to the line to ensure that joints once home are held so
 by compacting backfill material under and alongside the pipe or by other acceptable means.
 At the end of the work day, the last pipe shall be blocked in such a manner as may be required
 to prevent creep.
 7-08.3(2)F  Plugs and Connections
 Plugs for pipe branches, stubs, or other open ends which are not to be immediately
 connected shall be made of an approved material and shall be secured in a place with a joint
 comparable to the main line joint, or stoppers may be of an integrally cast breakout design.
 7-08.3(2)G  Jointing of Dissimilar Pipe
 Dissimilar pipe shall be jointed by use of a factory-fabricated adapter coupling or a pipe
 collar as detailed in the Standard Plans.
 7-08.3(2)H  Sewer Line Connections
 Storm and sanitary sewer line connections to trunks, mains, laterals, or side sewers shall be
 left uncovered until after the Engineer has inspected and approved the Work. After approval
 of the connection, the trench shall be backfilled as specified.
 7-08.3(2)I  Side Sewer Connections
 Where a storm or sanitary side sewer is larger than the trunk, main, or lateral to which
 it is to be connected, the connection shall be made only at a standard manhole unless
 otherwise provided in the Plans or in the Special Provisions, or unless otherwise authorized
 by the Engineer.
 7-08.3(3)  Backfilling
 Placement of pipe zone backfill shall be performed in accordance with these requirements
 and the Standard Plans. Trenches shall be backfilled as soon after the pipe laying as possible.
 Pipe zone backfill material shall be clean earth or sand, free from clay, frozen lumps, roots,
 or moisture in excess of that permitting required compaction. Rocks or lumps larger than
 3 inches maximum shall not be used for pipe zone backfill.
 Pipe zone backfill shall be placed in loose layers and compacted to 90 percent maximum
 density. Backfill shall be brought up simultaneously on each side of the pipe to the top of
 the pipe zone. The pipe shall then be covered to the top of the pipe zone and the materials
 compacted in a manner to avoid damaging or disturbing the completed pipe.
 Backfill above the pipe zone shall be accomplished in such a manner that the pipe will
 not be shifted out of position nor damaged by impact or overloading. If pipe is being placed
 in a new embankment, backfill above the pipe zone shall be placed in accordance with
 Section 2-03.3(14)C. If pipe is being placed under existing paved areas, or Roadways, backfill
 above the pipe zone shall be placed in horizontal layers no more than 6 inches thick and
 compacted to 95 percent maximum density. If pipe is being placed in non-traffic areas, backfill
 above the pipe zone shall be placed in horizontal layers no more than 6 inches thick and shall
 be compacted to 85 percent maximum density. All compaction shall be in accordance with the
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 General Pipe Installation Requirements
 
 Compaction Control Test of Section 2-03.3(14)D. Material excavated from the trench shall be
 used for backfill above the pipe zone, except that organic material, frozen lumps, wood, rocks,
 or pavement chunks larger than 6 inches in maximum dimension shall not be used. Materials
 determined by the Engineer to be unsuitable for backfill at the time of excavation shall be
 removed and replaced with imported backfill material.
 Backfilling of trenches in the vicinity of catch basins, manholes, or other appurtenances
 will not be permitted until the cement in the masonry has become thoroughly hardened.
 When it is required that a blanket of select material or bank run gravel is to be placed on
 top of the native backfill, the backfill shall be placed to the elevations shown in the Plans, or to
 the elevations specified by the Engineer. Compaction of the native material shall be as required
 by the Contracting Agency and shall be performed prior to placing the select material. Surface
 material shall be loosened to whatever depth is required to prevent bridging of the top layer,
 but shall in no case be less than 18 inches.
 The Contractor shall not operate tractors or other heavy equipment over the top of the pipe
 until the backfill has reached a height of 2 feet above the top of the pipe.
 7-08.3(4)  Plugging Existing Pipe
 Where shown in the Plans or where designated by the Engineer, existing pipes shall be
 plugged on the inlet end for a distance of 2 diameters with commercial concrete. Care shall be
 used in placing the concrete in the pipe to see that the opening of the pipe is completely filled
 and thoroughly plugged.
 7-08.4 Measurement
 Gravel backfill for foundations, or gravel backfill for pipe zone bedding when used for
 foundations, shall be measured by the cubic yard, including haul, as specified in Section 2-09.
 Plugging pipes will be measured per each, for each plug installed, for pipe diameters up to
 and including 36 inches. The concrete for plugging pipes in excess of 36 inches in diameter
 will be measured by the cubic yard. Computations for corrugated metal pipes will be based
 on the nominal diameter.
 Excavation of the trench will be measured as Structure excavation Class B or Structure
 excavation Class B including haul, by the cubic yard as specified in Section 2-09. When
 excavation below grade is necessary, excavation will be measured to the limits ordered by
 the Engineer.
 Embankment construction before pipe placement under the applicable provisions of
 Section 7-08.3(1)A will be measured in accordance with Section 2-03.
 Shoring or extra excavation class B will be measured as specified in Section 2-09.4.

 7-09.3  Construction Requirements
 7-09.3(1) General
 Trench excavation required for the installation of water mains and appurtenances shall
 be unclassified. Material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench or in a
 Roadway or public thoroughfare shall be piled and maintained so that the toe of the slope of
 the spoil material is at least 2 feet from the edge of the trench. It shall be piled in a manner
 to prevent surface water from flowing into the excavation and in a manner that will cause a
 minimum of inconvenience to public travel. Free access shall be provided to all fire hydrants,
 water valves, and meters; and clearance shall be left to enable the free flow of storm water in
 gutters, conduits, and natural watercourses.
 7-09.3(2)  Ungraded Streets
 On ungraded streets, when grading is not called for in the Contract, the depth of trench
 excavation shall be as shown on the Plans and as staked.
 Where the Plans show the pipe is to be laid above the existing ground surface, an
 embankment fill shall be made and compacted to conform with the section shown on the
 Plans, and the water main trench shall be excavated therein. That portion of the embankment
 below the bottom of the pipe shall be compacted with rollers or mechanical compactors under
 controlled moisture conditions as required under Method B of Section 2-03.3(14)C.

 7-09.3(4)  Removal of Existing Street Improvements
 Removal of existing street improvements and pavement from driveways and sidewalks
 shall be performed as specified in Section 2-02. Stockpiling of waste materials along the
 trench shall not be allowed.
 7-09.3(5)  Grade and Alignment
 The location of blow off assemblies and combination air release/air vacuum valves are
 shown on the Plans.
 The Contractor shall verify the locations and establish the depth of the existing water mains
 at the points where connections are to be made prior to trenching for the pipelines. The profile
 shall be adjusted so no new high spots or low spots are created between the connection points
 to the existing water mains.
 The depth of trenching for water mains shall be such as to give a minimum cover of
 36 inches over the top of the pipe unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions. Deeper
 excavation may be required due to localized breaks in grade, or to install the new main under
 existing culverts or other utilities where necessary. Where the profile of the pipeline and
 the ground surface is shown on the Plans, the pipeline shall be laid to the elevation shown
 regardless of depth. The excavation shall be to such depth that the minimum cover over valve
 operating nuts shall be 1 foot.
 7-09.3(6)  Existing Utilities
 Existing utilities of record, except services, are shown on the Plans. These are shown for
 convenience only, and the Engineer assumes no responsibility for improper locations or failure
 to show utility locations on the Plans.
 When utility services occupy the same space as the new water main, the Contractor shall
 complete necessary excavation to fully expose such services. The Contractor shall protect said
 services, and work around them during excavating and pipe laying operations. Any damages
 to services resulting from the Contractor’s operation shall be reported to the appropriate utility.
 Such damage shall be repaired at the Contractor’s expense.
 7-09.3(7)  Trench Excavation
 The Contractor shall perform excavation of every description and in whatever materials
 encountered to the depth indicated on the Plans or specified in the Special Provisions.
 Excavations shall be made by open cut unless otherwise provided for. Trenches shall be
 excavated to true and smooth bottom grades and in accordance with the lines given by the
 Engineer or shown on the Plans. The trench bottom shall provide uniform bearing and support
 for each length of pipe.
 Bell holes shall be excavated to the extent necessary to permit accurate Work in making
 and inspecting the joints. The banks of the trenches shall be kept as nearly vertical as soil
 conditions will permit, and where required to control trench width or to protect adjacent
 Structures, the trench shall be sheeted and braced. Trench widths to 1 foot above the top of
 the pipe shall not exceed 30 inches maximum or 1½ times the outside diameter of the pipe
 plus 18 inches whichever is greater. Standard excavating equipment shall be adjusted so as to
 excavate the narrowest trench possible.
 The length of trench excavation in advance of pipe laying shall be kept to a minimum.
 Excavations shall be either closed up at the end of the day or protected per Section 1-07.23(1).
 The Contractor shall exercise sound engineering and construction practices in excavating
 the trench and maintaining the trench so that no damage will occur to any foundation,
 Structure, pole line, pipe line, or other facility because of slough or slopes, or from any
 other cause. If, as a result of the excavation, there is disturbance of the ground, which may
 endanger other property, the Contractor shall immediately take remedial action at no additional
 expense to the Contracting Agency. No act, representation, or instruction of the Engineer
 shall in any way relieve the Contractor from liability for damages or costs that result from
 trench excavation.

 Water Mains
 
 Care shall be taken not to excavate below the depth specified. Excavation below that depth
 shall be backfilled with foundation material and compacted as specified herein.
 If workers have to enter any trench or other excavation 4 feet or more in depth that does not
 meet the open pit requirements of Section 2-09.3(3)B, it shall be shored. The Contractor alone
 shall be responsible for worker safety, and the Contracting Agency assumes no responsibility.
 Upon completing the Work, the Contractor shall remove all shoring unless the Plans or the
 Engineer direct otherwise.
 7-09.3(7)A  Dewatering of Trench
 Where water is encountered in the trench, it shall be removed during pipe-laying operations
 and the trench so maintained until the ends of the pipe are sealed and provisions are made to
 prevent floating of the pipe. Trench water or other deleterious materials shall not be allowed
 to enter the pipe at any time.
 7-09.3(7)B  Rock Excavation
 Rock excavation shall cover the removal and disposal of rock that requires systematic
 drilling and blasting for its removal, and also boulders exceeding ½ cubic yard. Ledge rock,
 boulders, or stones shall be removed to provide a minimum clearance of 4 inches under
 the pipe.
 Hardpan, hard clay, glacial till, sandstone, siltstone, shale, or other sedimentary rocks,
 which are soft, weathered, or extensively fissured will not be classified as rock excavation.
 Rock is defined as one that has a modulus of elasticity of more than 200,000 psi or unconfined
 compressive strength at field moisture content of more than 2,000 psi.
 Materials removed shall be replaced with gravel backfill for pipe zone bedding, pipe zone
 backfill or trench backfill as designated by the Engineer.
 7-09.3(7)C  Extra Trench Excavation
 Changes in grades of the water main from those shown on the Plans, or as provided in the
 Special Provisions, may be necessary because of unexpected utilities, or for other reasons.
 If, in the opinion of the Engineer, it is necessary to adjust, correct, relocate, or in any way
 change the line and grade, such changes shall be made by the Contractor under the terms of
 these Standard Specifications.
 When pipeline grade is lowered in excess of 1 foot below the grade indicated on the Plans,
 the Contractor shall make such extra excavation as necessary.
 When the pipeline horizontal alignment is changed by more than 1 foot from the line
 indicated on the Plans, after the trench has been excavated, the Contractor shall excavate the
 trench at the changed location and backfill and compact the previous trench.
 Additional excavation so required will be classified as extra trench excavation.
 7-09.3(8)  Removal and Replacement of Unsuitable Materials
 Whenever in excavating the trench for water mains, the bottom of the trench exposes peat,
 soft clay, quicksand, or other unsuitable foundation material, such material shall be removed to
 the depth directed by the Engineer and backfilled with foundation material. When determined
 by the Engineer that silty soils or fine sandy soils are encountered, Class C foundation material
 shall be required. Silty soils or fine sandy soils usually flow in the presence of a stream of
 water. When determined by the Engineer that clay, peat, or other soft materials are encountered
 that become saturated with water, but do not break down into fine particles and flow, Class A
 or Class B foundation material shall be required.
 Material removed from the trench that is unsuitable for trench backfill shall be removed
 and hauled to a waste site. If material is not available within the limits of the project for
 backfilling the trench, the Contractor shall furnish trench backfill meeting the requirements
 of Section 9-03.12(3) or 9-03.19 as required.
 Unsuitable material shall be loaded directly into trucks and hauled to a waste site obtained
 by the Contractor. Stockpiling of unsuitable material at the project site shall not be allowed.

 waste, organic material, and other extraneous or objectionable materials and shall have a
 maximum dimension of 1½ inches. Gravel backfill for pipe zone bedding shall be placed to the
 depths shown in the Standard Plans. Gravel backfill for pipe zone bedding shall be rammed
 and tamped around the pipe to 95 percent of maximum density by approved hand-held tools,
 so as to provide firm and uniform support for the full length of the pipe, valves, and fittings.
 Care shall be taken to prevent any damage to the pipe or its protective coating.
 7-09.3(10)  Backfilling Trenches
 Prior to backfilling, form lumber and debris shall be removed from the trench. Sheeting
 used by the Contractor shall be removed just ahead of the backfilling.
 Backfill up to 12 inches over the top of the pipe shall be evenly and carefully placed.
 Materials capable of damaging the pipe or its coating shall be removed from the backfill
 material. The remainder of the material shall be placed by dumping into the trench by any
 method at the option of the Contractor, and shall be compacted as specified hereinafter.
 A minimum 3 inch sand cushion shall be placed between the water main and existing
 pipelines or other conduits when encountered during construction.
 7-09.3(11)  Compaction of Backfill
 Backfill shall be compacted to at least 95 percent of maximum density as specified in
 Section 2-03.3(14)D.
 At locations where paved streets, Roadway Shoulders, driveways, or sidewalks will be
 constructed or reconstructed over the trench, the backfill shall be spread in layers and be
 compacted by mechanical tampers. In such cases, the backfill material shall be placed in
 successive layers not exceeding 6 inches in loose thickness, and each layer shall be compacted
 with mechanical tampers to the density specified herein. Mechanical tampers shall be of the
 impact type as approved by the Engineer.
 7-09.3(12)  General Pipe Installation
 Pipe shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s printed Specifications
 and instructions, and to the standards of the AWWA for installing the type of pipe used.
 The Contractor shall provide tools and equipment, including any special tools required for
 installing each particular type of pipe used.

 provide the proper spacing of valves, tees, or special fittings.
 7-09.3(13)  Handling of Pipe
 Pipe shall be handled in a manner that will prevent damage to the pipe, pipe lining, or
 coating. Pipe and fittings shall be loaded and unloaded using hoists and slings in a manner
 to avoid shock or damage, and under no circumstances shall they be dropped, skidded, or
 rolled against other pipe. If any part of the coating or lining is damaged, repair thereof shall
 be made by the Contractor at no additional expense to the Contracting Agency and in a
 manner satisfactory to the Engineer. Damaged pipe shall be rejected, and the Contractor shall
 immediately place damaged pipe apart from the undamaged and shall remove the damaged
 pipe from the site within 24 hours.
 Threaded pipe ends shall be protected by couplings or other means until laid.
 Pipe and fittings shall be inspected for defects.
 Dirt or other foreign material shall be prevented from entering the pipe or pipe joint during
 handling or laying operations, and any pipe or fitting that has been installed with dirt or
 foreign material in it shall be removed, cleaned, and re-laid. At times when pipe laying is not
 in progress, the open ends of the pipe shall be closed by a watertight plug or by other means
 approved by the Engineer to ensure cleanliness inside the pipe.

 saw or by a special pipe cutter. Pipe ends shall be square with the longitudinal axis of the pipe
 and shall be reamed and otherwise smoothed so that good connections can be made. Threads
 shall be cleanly cut. Oxyacetylene torch cutting of ductile iron pipe shall not be allowed.
 7-09.3(15)  Laying of Pipe on Curves
 7-09.3(15)A  Ductile Iron Pipe
 Long radius curves, either horizontal or vertical, may be laid with standard pipe lengths by
 deflecting the joints. If the pipe is shown curved on the Plans and no special fittings are shown,
 the Contractor can assume that the curves can be made by deflecting the joints with standard
 lengths of pipe. If shorter lengths are required, the Plans will indicate maximum lengths that
 can be used. The amount of deflection at each pipe joint when pipe is laid on a horizontal or
 vertical curve shall not exceed the manufacturer’s printed recommended deflections.
 Where field conditions require deflection or curves not anticipated by the Plans, the
 Engineer will determine the methods to be used. No additional payment will be made for
 laying pipe on curves as shown on the Plans, or for field changes involving standard lengths
 of pipe deflected at the joints. When special fittings not shown on the Plans are required to
 meet field conditions, additional payment will be made for special fittings as provided in
 Section 1-09.6.
 When rubber gasketed pipe is laid on a curve, the pipe shall be jointed in a straight
 alignment and then deflected to the curved alignment. Trenches shall be made wider on curves
 for this purpose.
 7-09.3(15)B  Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Pipe (4 inches and Over)
 PVC pipe may be bent to allow for slight changes in direction. The minimum bending
 radius shall be as follows:
 Size
 4 inch
 6 inch
 8 inch
 10 inch
 12 inch
 14 inch
 
 Minimum Bending Radius
 125 feet
 175 feet
 225 feet
 275 feet
 325 feet
 400 feet
 
 Axial deflection at the pipe joints shall not be allowed.
 For 16-inch diameter pipe, changes in direction may be accomplished by axial deflection of
 the pipe joint. The maximum axial deflection allowed at each joint is 1 degree. For changes in
 direction greater than 1 degree per pipe joint, fittings shall be used.
 7-09.3(16)  Cleaning and Assembling Joint
 The pipe ends, couplings, fittings, and appurtenances shall be cleaned to remove oil, grit,
 or other foreign matter from the joint. Care shall be taken to keep the joint from contacting
 the ground.
 Pipe not furnished with a depth mark shall be marked before assembly to ensure visual
 observation of the Work.
 7-09.3(17)  Laying Ductile Iron Pipe With Polyethylene Encasement
 Where shown on the Plans, the Contractor shall lay ductile iron pipe with a polyethylene
 encasement. Pipe and polyethylene encasement shall be installed in accordance with
 AWWA C105.

 7-09.3(19) Connections
 7-09.3(19)A  Connections to Existing Mains
 Connections to the existing water main shall not be made without first making the
 necessary scheduling arrangements with the Engineer in advance. Work shall not be started
 until all the materials, equipment, and labor necessary to properly complete the Work are
 assembled on the site.
 Existing water mains shall be cut by the Contractor unless otherwise specified in the
 Special Provisions. The Contractor shall remove the portions of pipe to provide for the
 installation of the required fittings at the points of connection. Damage caused by the
 Contractor’s operations to existing joints in piping to remain in-service shall be repaired
 by the Contractor at no additional expense to the Contracting Agency. The Contractor shall
 determine the exact length of the existing water main that must be removed. The pipe ends
 shall be beveled to prevent damage to the transition coupling gasket during installation of
 the coupling. The exterior of the existing pipe end shall be cleaned to a sound, smooth finish
 before installation of the coupling.
 Transition couplings shall be installed by the Contractor and shall be provided with a
 plastic film wrap. The plastic film wrap shall be wrapped loosely around the pipe, fittings, and
 couplings, and secured with 2-inch-wide polyethylene adhesive tape. Pipelines in which the
 couplings are installed shall be wrapped a minimum of 3 feet on each side of the coupling.
 Joints or seams in the plastic film wrap shall be made using the 2-inch-wide polyethylene
 adhesive tape. The plastic film wrap need not be watertight, but no part of the pipe or coupling
 shall be exposed to the backfill. Care shall be exercised during backfilling to prevent the
 plastic film wrap from being punctured or otherwise damaged. Plastic film wrap and its
 installation shall conform to AWWA C105 except as modified herein.
 Once Work is started on a connection, it shall proceed continuously without interruption
 and as rapidly as possible until completed. No shutoff of mains will be permitted overnight,
 over weekends, or on holidays.
 If the connection to the existing system involves turning off the water, the Contractor shall
 be responsible for notifying the residents affected by the shutoff. The Engineer will advise
 which property owners are to be notified.
 The Contractor may be required to perform the connection during times other than normal
 working hours. The Contractor shall not operate any valves on the existing system without
 specific permission of the Engineer.
 The types of connections are varied and suggested piping arrangements have been shown
 on the Plans. For the installation of these connections, the surfaced portion of the Roadway
 shall not be penetrated unless the connecting point is directly under it. For connection by any
 other method, the Contractor shall furnish a detailed sketch for approval not less than 2 weeks
 prior to the expected construction.

 Water Mains
 
 7-09.3(19)B  Maintaining Service
 Where existing services are to be transferred from old to new mains, the Contractor shall
 plan and coordinate its Work with that of the Utility so that service will be resumed with the
 least possible inconvenience to customers.
 To supply customers with water during the construction of a water main project where any
 section of the pipe has passed satisfactory hydrostatic and bacteriological tests, the Utility
 reserves the right to tap corporation stops into the section of new pipe and install service
 connections at such locations as the Utility may elect. The installation of any such service
 connections by the Utility shall not be construed by the Contractor as an acceptance by the
 Contracting Agency of any part of the Work required under the Contract.
 7-09.3(20)  Detectable Marking Tape
 Detectable marking tape shall be installed over nonmetallic water lines including services
 lines. The tape shall be placed approximately 1 foot above the top of the line and shall extend
 its full length. Detectable marking tape shall meet the requirements of Section 9-15.18.
 7-09.3(21)  Concrete Thrust Blocking
 Concrete thrust blocking, as detailed on the Plans, shall be placed at bends, tees, dead
 ends, and crosses. Blocking shall be commercial concrete meeting the requirement of
 Section 6-02.3(2)B poured in place.
 Concrete blocking shall bear against solid undisturbed earth at the sides and bottom of
 the trench excavation and shall be shaped so as not to obstruct access to the joints of the pipe
 or fittings.
 7-09.3(22)  Blowoff Assemblies
 Blowoff Assemblies shall be constructed at the locations shown on the Plans and in
 accordance with the Standard Plans.
 7-09.3(23)  Hydrostatic Pressure Test
 Water main appurtenances and service connections to the meter setter shall be tested in
 sections of convenient length under a hydrostatic pressure equal to 150 psi in excess of that
 under which they will operate or in no case shall the test pressure be less than 225 psi. Pumps,
 gauges, plugs, saddles, corporation stops, miscellaneous hose and piping, and measuring
 equipment necessary for performing the test shall be furnished and operated by the Contractor.
 Sections to be tested shall normally be limited to 1,500 feet. The Engineer may require that
 the first section of pipe, not less than 1,000 feet in length, installed by each of the Contractor’s
 crews, be tested in order to qualify the crew and the materials. Pipe laying shall not be
 continued more than an additional 1,000 feet until the first section has been tested successfully.
 The pipeline shall be backfilled sufficiently to prevent movement of the pipe under
 pressure. Thrust blocks shall be in place and time allowed for the concrete to cure before
 testing. Where permanent blocking is not required, the Contractor shall furnish and install
 temporary blocking and remove it after testing.
 The mains shall be filled with water and allowed to stand under pressure a sufficient
 length of time to allow the escape of air and allow the lining of the pipe to absorb water. The
 Contracting Agency will furnish the water necessary to fill the pipelines for testing purposes
 at a time of day when sufficient quantities of water are available for normal system operation.
 The test shall be accomplished by pumping the main up to the required pressure, stopping
 the pump for 15 minutes, and then pumping the main up to the test pressure again. During the
 test, the section being tested shall be observed to detect any visible leakage.
 A clean container shall be used for holding water for pumping up pressure on the
 main being tested. This makeup water shall be sterilized by the addition of chlorine to a
 concentration of 50 mg/l.
 
 Page 7-36
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Water Mains
 
 7-09
 
 The quantity of water required to restore the pressure shall be accurately determined by
 pumping through a positive displacement water meter. The meter shall be approved by the
 Engineer. Acceptability of the test will be determined as follows:
 L=
 
 SD P
 266,400
 
 The quantity of water lost from the main shall not exceed the number of gallons per hour
 as determined by the formula:
 Where:
 L	 =	 allowable leakage, gallons/hour
 D	
 =	 nominal diameter of the pipe in inches
 P	 =	 test pressure during the leakage test (psi)
 S	  =	 gross length of pipe tested, feet
 There shall not be an appreciable or abrupt loss in pressure during the 15-minute
 test period.
 Pressure gauges used in the test shall be accompanied with certifications of accuracy
 from a testing Laboratory approved by the Engineer.
 Any visible leakage detected shall be corrected by the Contractor regardless of the
 allowable leakage specified above. Should the tested section fail to meet the pressure test
 successfully as specified, the Contractor shall, at no additional expense to the Contracting
 Agency, locate and repair the defects and then retest the pipeline.
 Tests shall be made with the hydrant auxiliary gate valves open and pressure against the
 hydrant valve. Each valve shall be tested by closing each in turn and relieving the pressure
 beyond. This test of the valve will be acceptable if there is no immediate loss of pressure on
 the gauge when the pressure comes against the valve being checked. The Contractor shall
 verify that the pressure differential across the valve does not exceed the rated working pressure
 of the valve.
 Prior to calling out the Engineer to witness the pressure test, the Contractor shall have all
 equipment set up completely ready for operation and shall have successfully performed the
 test to ensure that the pipe is in satisfactory condition.
 Defective materials or workmanship, discovered as a result of hydrostatic field test, shall be
 replaced by the Contractor at no additional expense to the Contracting Agency. Whenever it is
 necessary to replace defective material or correct the workmanship, the hydrostatic test shall
 be re-run at the Contractor’s expense until a satisfactory test is obtained.
 7-09.3(23)A  Testing Extensions From Existing Mains
 When an existing water main is extended with new pipe to a new valve and the distance
 from the existing pipe to the new valve is 18 feet or less, the section of new pipe installed
 between the new valve and the end of the existing main shall be made with pretested,
 prechlorinated pipe, and no hydrostatic test will be required. When the required hydrostatic
 tests are conducted in the new main section beyond the installed new valve in the closed
 position, the normal pressure of the existing main may be present against the other side of
 the new valve.
 Where the distance between the end of an existing water main pipe extension to the
 new valve is more than 18 feet, the connection of the new pipe to existing pipe shall not be
 made until after hydrostatic tests have been made to the required pressure in both directions
 against the new valve. This shall be accomplished by a temporary cap or plug installed on
 the end of the new pipe, beyond the new valve, as close as possible to the existing pipe for
 testing purposes.
 The short length of pipe between the temporary cap or plug end with the new valve in the
 closed position, with no hydrostatic pressure active on the opposite side of the valve, shall
 be subjected to the required test pressure. The same test shall be made against the other side
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Page 7-37
 
 7-09
 
 Water Mains
 
 of the new valve when that section of pipe is tested with no hydrostatic pressure active in the
 short section of pipe toward the existing main. The final connection to the existing main shall
 be made with pretested prechlorinated pipe.
 7-09.3(23)B  Testing Section With Hydrants Installed
 When hydrants are included with the section of main pipe to be tested, the testing shall be
 conducted in three separate tests as follows:
 Test No. 1 – Water main gate valves and hydrant auxiliary gate valves closed, with the
 hydrant operating stem valves and hose ports wide open.
 Test No. 2 – Water main gate valves and the hydrant operating the stem valves tightly
 closed but the hydrant auxiliary gate valves and hose ports wide open.
 Test No. 3 – Each hydrant shall be tested to the pressure indicated in Section 7-09.3(23)
 with the hydrant auxiliary gate valve and hose ports closed and the hydrant operating stem
 valve wide open.
 7-09.3(23)C  Testing Hydrants Installed on Existing Mains
 For hydrants installed and connected to an existing main, the hydrant connection including
 hydrant tee, connection pipe, and auxiliary gate valves, shall be installed with pretested
 materials.
 Before the hydrant connection is made to the existing main, the hydrant installation shall be
 subjected to the hydrostatic Test No. 3 as specified in Section 7-09.3(23)B. Hydrants installed
 and connected to an existing main shall have a satisfactory bacteriological sample obtained
 following the hydrostatic test.
 7-09.3(24)  Disinfection of Water Mains
 Before being placed into service, new water mains and repaired portions of, or extensions
 to, existing mains shall be chlorinated and a satisfactory bacteriological report obtained. In
 the event two unsatisfactory bacteriological reports are obtained on a section of pipe, the
 Contractor shall revise his method of disinfection and the form of applied chlorine.
 7-09.3(24)A Flushing
 Sections of pipe to be disinfected shall first be flushed to remove any solids or
 contaminated material that may have become lodged in the pipe. If a hydrant is not installed at
 the end of the main, then a tap shall be provided large enough to develop a flow velocity of at
 least 2.5 fps in the water main.
 Taps required by the Contractor for temporary or permanent release of air, chlorination
 or flushing purposes shall be provided by the Contractor as part of the construction of water
 mains.
 Where dry calcium hypochlorite is used for disinfection of the pipe, flushing shall be done
 after disinfection.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for disposal of treated water flushed from mains and
 shall neutralize the wastewater for protection of aquatic life in the receiving water before
 disposal into any natural drainage channel, i.e., receiving water, waters of the State, including
 wetlands. The Contractor shall be responsible for disposing of disinfecting solution to the
 satisfaction of the Contracting Agency and local authorities. At a minimum, chlorinated
 water shall be dechlorinated to a concentration of 0.1 parts per million (ppm) or less, and pH
 adjustment to within 6.5 – 8.5 standard units before discharging to surface waters of the State
 or to a storm sewer system that drains to surface waters of the State.
 If approved by the Engineer and by the local authority responsible for the sanitary sewer
 system, disposal of treated water from mains may be made to an available sanitary sewer,
 provided the rate of disposal will not overload the sewer.

 7-09
 
 7-09.3(24)B  Requirement of Chlorine
 Before being placed into service, new mains and repaired portions of, or extensions to,
 existing mains shall be chlorinated so that a chlorine residual of not less than 25 mg/l remains
 in the water after standing 24 hours in the pipe. The initial chlorine content of the water shall
 be not less than 50 mg/l.
 7-09.3(24)C  Form of Applied Chlorine
 Chlorine shall be applied by one of the methods which follow, to give a dosage of not less
 than 50 mg/l of available chlorine.
 7-09.3(24)D  Dry Calcium Hypochlorite
 As each length of pipe is laid, sufficient high-test calcium hypochlorite (65 to 70 percent
 chlorine) shall be placed inside the pipe to yield a dosage of not less than 50 mg/l available
 chlorine, calculated on the volume of the water that the pipe and appurtenances will contain.
 The number of grams of 70 percent test calcium hypochlorite required for a 20-foot length
 of pipe equals
 0.238 × d2, in which “d” is the diameter in inches.
 7-09.3(24)E  Liquid Chlorine
 A chlorine gas-water mixture shall be applied by means of a solution-feed chlorinating
 device, or the dry gas may be fed directly through proper devices for regulating the rate of
 flow and providing effective diffusion of the gas into the water within the pipe being treated.
 Chlorinating devices for feeding solutions of the chlorine gas, or the gas itself, must provide
 means for preventing the backflow of water into the chlorine.
 7-09.3(24)F  Chlorine-Bearing Compounds in Water
 A mixture of water and high-test calcium hypochlorite (65 to 70 percent Cl) may be
 substituted for the chlorine gas-water mixture. The dry powder shall first be mixed as a paste
 and then thinned to a 1 percent chlorine solution by adding water to give a total quantity of
 7.5 gallons of water per pound of dry powder. This solution shall be injected in one end of the
 section of main to be disinfected while filling the main with water.
 7-09.3(24)G  Sodium Hypochlorite
 Sodium hypochlorite, commercial grade (12.5 percent Cl) or in the form of liquid
 household bleach (5 to 6 percent Cl), may be substituted for the chlorine gas-water mixture.
 This liquid chlorine compound may be used full strength or diluted with water and injected
 into the main in correct proportion to the fill water so that dosage applied to the water will be
 at least 50 mg/l.
 7-09.3(24)H  Point of Application
 The point of application of the chlorinating agent shall be at the beginning of the pipeline
 extension or any valved section of it, and through a corporation stop inserted in the horizontal
 axis of the pipe. The water injector for delivering the chlorine-bearing water into the pipe
 should be supplied from a tap on the pressure side of the gate valve controlling the flow
 into the pipeline extension. Alternate points of applications may be used when approved by
 the Engineer.
 7-09.3(24)I  Rate of Application
 Water from the existing distribution system, or other source of supply, shall be controlled
 to flow very slowly into the newly-laid pipeline during application of the chlorine. The rate
 of chlorine gas-water mixture or dry gas feed shall be in such proportion to the rate of water
 entering the newly-laid pipe that the dosage applied to the water will be at least 50 mg/l.

 7-09.3(24)J  Preventing Reverse Flow
 No connections shall be made between the existing distribution system and pipelines not
 disinfected that are constructed under this Contract without a State Department of Health
 approved backflow preventer installed in the connecting line.
 7-09.3(24)K  Retention Period
 Treated water shall be retained in the pipe at least 24 hours. After this period, the chlorine
 residual at pipe extremities and at other representative points shall be at least 25 mg/l.
 7-09.3(24)L  Chlorinating Valves, Hydrants, and Appurtenances
 In the process of chlorinating newly laid pipe, valves, hydrants, and other appurtenances
 shall be operated while the pipeline is filled with the chlorinating agent and under normal
 operating pressure.
 7-09.3(24)M  Chlorinating Connections to Existing Water Mains and Water
 Service Connections
 The chlorinating procedure to be followed shall be as specified in AWWA Standard C651.
 All closure fittings shall be swabbed with a very strong chlorine solution at least as strong
 as liquid household bleach (5 to 6 percent Cl).
 7-09.3(24)N  Final Flushing and Testing
 Following chlorination, treated water shall be flushed from the newly-laid pipe until the
 replacement water throughout its length shows, upon test, the absence of chlorine. In the
 event chlorine is normally used in the source of supply, then the tests shall show a residual
 not in excess of that carried in the water supply system.
 A sample tap shall be located ahead of the flushing hose for convenience and for
 sanitary sampling.
 Before placing the lines into service, a satisfactory report shall be received from the local
 or State Health Department on samples collected from representative points in the new system.
 Samples will be collected and bacteriological tests obtained by the Engineer.
 At a minimum, chlorinated water shall be dechlorinated to a concentration of 0.1 parts
 per million (ppm) or less, and pH adjustment to within 6.5 to 8.5 standard units, if necessary,
 before discharging to surface waters of the State or to a storm sewer system that drains to
 surface waters of the State.
 7-09.3(24)O  Repetition of Flushing and Testing
 Should the initial treatment result in an unsatisfactory bacteriological test, the original
 chlorination procedure shall be repeated by the Contractor until satisfactory results are
 obtained. Failure to get a satisfactory test shall be considered as failure of the Contractor to
 keep the pipe clean during construction, or to properly chlorinate the main.
 7-09.4 Measurement
 Measurement for payment of pipe for water mains will be by the linear foot of pipe laid
 and tested and shall be measured along the pipe through fittings, valves, and couplings.

 7-17.3  Construction Requirements
 Sanitary sewers shall be constructed in accordance with Section 7-08.3.
 7-17.3(1)  Protection of Existing Sewerage Facilities
 All existing live sewers including septic tanks and drain fields shall be kept in service
 at all times. Provision shall be made for disposal of sewage flow if any existing sewers are
 damaged. Damage to existing sewers shall be repaired by the Contractor, at no expense to the
 Contracting Agency, to a condition equal to or better than their condition prior to the damage.
 Water accumulating during construction shall be removed from the new sewers but shall
 not be permitted to enter the existing system. The Contractor shall be responsible for flushing
 out and cleaning any existing sewers into which gravel, rocks, or other debris has entered
 as a result of their operations, and shall repair lift stations or other facilities damaged by the
 Contractor’s operations.
 The physical connection to an existing manhole or sewer shall not be made until authorized
 by the Engineer. Such authorization will not be given until all upstream lines have been
 completely cleaned, all debris removed, and where applicable, a pipe temporarily placed in the
 existing channel and sealed.
 7-17.3(2)  Cleaning and Testing
 7-17.3(2)A General
 Sewers and appurtenances, where required in the Plans, shall be cleaned and tested after
 backfilling by either the exfiltration or low pressure air method at the option of the Contractor,
 except where the ground water table is such that the Engineer may require the infiltration test.
 All Work involved in cleaning and testing sewer lines between manholes or rodding inlets
 as required shall be completed within 15 working days after backfilling of sewer lines and
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10

 Sanitary Sewers
 
 Structures. Any further delay will require the written consent of the Engineer. The Contractor
 shall furnish all labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to make the test, clean the
 lines, and perform all incidental Work. The Contractor shall perform the tests under the
 direction and in the presence of the Engineer. Precautions shall be taken to prevent joints
 from drawing during tests, and any damage resulting from these tests shall be repaired by the
 Contractor at no expense to the Contracting Agency. The manner and time of testing shall be
 subject to approval by the Engineer.
 All wyes, tees, and stubs shall be plugged with flexible jointed caps, or acceptable
 alternate, securely fastened to withstand the internal test pressure. Such plugs or caps shall
 be readily removable, and their removal shall provide a socket suitable for making a flexible
 jointed lateral connection or extension.
 Testing side sanitary sewers shall be for their entire length from the public sewer in the
 street to the connection with the building’s plumbing. Their testing shall be as required by the
 local sanitary agency but in no case shall it be less thorough than that of filling the pipe with
 water before backfilling and visually inspecting the exterior for leakage. The decision of the
 Engineer as to acceptance of the side sanitary sewer shall be final.
 If any sewer installation fails to meet the requirements of the test method used, the
 Contractor shall determine, at no expense to the Contracting Agency, the source or sources
 of leakage and shall repair or replace all defective materials or workmanship at no expense to
 the Contracting Agency. The complete pipe installation shall meet the requirements of the test
 method used before being considered acceptable.
 7-17.3(2)B  Exfiltration Test
 Prior to making exfiltration leakage tests, the Contractor may fill the pipe with clear water
 to permit normal absorption into the pipe walls provided, however, that after so filling the
 pipe, the Contractor shall complete the leakage test within 24 hours after filling. When under
 test, the allowable leakage shall be limited according to the provisions that follow. Specified
 allowances assume pre-wetted pipe.
 Leakage shall be no more than 0.28 gph per inch diameter per 100 feet of sewer, with a
 hydrostatic head of 6 feet above the crown at the upper end of the test section, or above the
 natural ground water table at the time of test, whichever is higher. The length of pipe tested
 shall be limited so that the pressure at the lower end of the Section tested does not exceed
 16 feet of head above the invert, and in no case shall be greater than 700 feet or the distance
 between manholes when greater than 700 feet.
 Where the test head is other than 6 feet, the maximum leakage shall not exceed the amount
 determined from the following equation:
 Maximum leakage (in gallons per hour)  = 0.28 × (√H/√6) × D × (L/100)
 Where:
 D	
 =	 diameter (in.)
 L	
 =	 length of pipe (ft.)
 H	
 =	 test head (ft.)
 When the test is to be made one joint at a time, the leakage per joint shall not exceed the
 computed allowable leakage per length of pipe.
 7-17.3(2)C  Infiltration Test
 Where the natural ground water head over the pipe is 2 feet or less above the crown of pipe
 at the upper end of the test section, the infiltration test leakage shall not exceed 0.16 gallons
 per hour per inch of diameter per 100 feet of pipe length. The length of pipe tested shall not
 exceed 700 feet or the distance between manholes when greater than 700 feet.
 Where the natural ground water head is greater than 2 feet, the maximum leakage shall not
 exceed the amount determined from the following equation:
 
 Page 7-54
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Sanitary Sewers
 
 7-17
 
 Maximum leakage (in gallons per hour) = 0.16 × (√H/√2) × D × (L/100)
 Where:
 D	
 =	 diameter (in.)
 L	
 =	 length of pipe (ft.)
 H	
 =	 natural ground water head (ft.)
 When a suitable head of ground water exists above the crown of the pipe and when the
 pipe is large enough to work inside, acceptance may be based on the repair of visible leakage
 by means satisfactory to the Engineer.
 7-17.3(2)D  Other Test Allowances
 For either the infiltration or exfiltration test, all lateral or side sewer branches included in
 the test section shall be taken into account in computing allowable leakage. An allowance of
 0.2 gallons per hour per foot of head above invert shall be made for each manhole included
 in a test section.
 Upon final acceptance of the Work all sewers, side sewers and fittings shall be open,
 clean, and free draining.
 7-17.3(2)E  Low Pressure Air Test for Sanitary Sewers Constructed of Air
 Permeable Materials
 Air permeable materials include concrete and vitrified clay. Low pressure air testing may
 be used for air permeable pipes 30 inches in diameter and smaller.
 The test equipment to be used shall be furnished by the Contractor and shall be inspected
 and approved by the Engineer prior to use. The Engineer may at any time require a calibration
 test of gauges or other instrumentation that is incorporated into the test equipment. Calibration
 tests shall be certified by an independent testing Laboratory.
 Plugs used to close the pipe for the air test must be securely braced to prevent the
 unintentional release of a plug, which can become a high velocity projectile. Gauges,
 air piping manifold, and valves shall be located at the top of the ground. No one shall be
 permitted to enter a manhole or catch basin where a plugged pipe is under pressure. Air testing
 apparatus shall be equipped with a pressure release device, such as a rupture disk or a pressure
 relief valve, designed to activate when the pressure in the pipe exceeds 2 psig above the
 required test pressure.
 If the pipe to be tested is submerged by groundwater, the backpressure on the pipe created
 by the groundwater submergence must be determined. All gauge pressures described in the test
 shall be increased by that amount.
 The first section of pipe installed by each crew shall be tested in order to qualify the crew
 and material. A successful test for the section shall be a prerequisite to further installation
 by that crew. Following the initial test, pipes shall be tested from manhole to manhole, catch
 basin to catch basin, or such shorter lengths as determined by the Contractor.
 Air shall be slowly supplied to the plugged pipe section until the internal air pressure
 reaches 4 psig. Wait at least 2 minutes to allow for pressure and temperature stabilization to
 occur within the pipe.
 When the pressure decreases to 3.5 psig, the air pressure test shall begin. The test shall
 consist of measuring the time in seconds for the pressure in the pipe to drop from 3.5 psig to
 2.5 psig. The pipe shall be considered acceptable if the time in seconds for the pressure drop
 is equal to or greater than the required time as calculated below:

 This method was developed based on an allowable air loss rate of 0.003 cubic feet per
 minute (cfm) per square foot of internal pipe surface, with the total air loss rate not less than
 2 cfm nor greater than 3.5 cfm. At the Contractor’s option, the pipe may be tested without
 pre‑wetting; however, the allowable air loss rate assumes pre-wetted pipe.
 Pipe over 30 inches in diameter shall be tested one joint at a time in accordance with
 ASTM C1103.
 7-17.3(2)F  Low Pressure Air Test for Sanitary Sewers Constructed of Non Air
 Permeable Materials
 Non air permeable materials include ductile iron, ABS composite, polyvinyl chloride
 (PVC), and polyethylene (PE). When non air permeable pipe is subjected to a low-pressure
 air test, all of the provisions of Section 7-17.3(2)E shall apply, except that the time in seconds
 for the pressure drop shall be equal to or greater than four times the required time calculated
 in Section 7-17.3(2)E.
 Pipe over 30 inches in diameter shall be tested one joint at a time in accordance with
 ASTM C1103.
 Reaches of thermoplastic pipe containing no joints shall be exempt from testing
 requirements.
 7-17.3(2)G  Deflection Test for Thermoplastic Pipe
 Sanitary sewers constructed of thermoplastic pipe shall be tested for deflection not less
 than 30 days after the trench backfill and compaction has been completed. The test shall be
 conducted by pulling a properly sized “go-nogo” mandrel through the completed pipeline.
 Testing shall be conducted on a manhole-to-manhole basis and shall be done after the line
 has been completely flushed out with water.
 The mandrel shall be a rigid, nonadjustable mandrel having an effective length of not less
 than its normal diameter and an odd-number of legs (9 legs minimum). Minimum diameter at
 any point along the full length of the mandrel shall be 95 percent of the base inside diameter
 of the pipe being tested.
 Base inside diameter is derived by subtracting a statistical tolerance package from the
 average inside diameter. The tolerance package is defined as the square root of the sum of
 squared manufacturing tolerances. The tolerance package for controlled outside diameter
 pipe consists of (1) outside diameter tolerance specified in applicable ASTM Standard,
 (2) 12 percent of one wall thickness specified in applicable ASTM Standard, and (3) out
 of roundness tolerance listed in appendix of applicable ASTM Standard. The items in the
 tolerance package for controlled inside diameter pipe consists of (1) inside diameter tolerance
 listed in appendix of applicable ASTM Standard and (2) out of roundness tolerance listed in
 appendix of applicable ASTM Standard. When out of roundness tolerance is not listed, use
 3 percent of average inside diameter.
 
 Page 7-56
 
 2018 Standard Specifications  M 41-10
 
 Sanitary Sewers
 
 7-17
 
 The average inside diameter for pipe with controlled outside diameter shall be equal to the
 average outside diameter as specified in applicable ASTM Standard minus 2 minimum wall
 thicknesses as specified in applicable ASTM Standard and minus 2 times excess wall tolerance
 of 6 percent. The average inside diameter for pipes with controlled inside diameter shall be the
 average inside diameter as specified in applicable ASTM Standard.
 The Contractor shall be required, at no expense to the Contracting Agency, to locate and
 uncover any sections failing to pass the test and, if not damaged, reinstall the pipe. The use of
 a vibratory re-rounding device or any process other than removal or reinstallation shall not be
 acceptable. The Contractor shall retest the section after replacement of the pipe.
 Pipe large enough to work inside of may be accepted on the basis of direct measurement.
 7-17.3(2)H  Television Inspection
 The Engineer may require any or all sanitary sewer lines be inspected by the use of a
 television camera before final acceptance. The costs incurred in making the initial inspection
 shall be borne by the owner of the sanitary sewer.
 The Contractor shall bear all costs incurred in correcting any deficiencies found during
 television inspection including the cost of any additional television inspection that may be
 required by the Engineer to verify the correction of said deficiency.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for all costs incurred in any television inspection
 performed solely for the benefit of the Contractor.
 7-17.4 Measurement
 The length of sewer pipe will be the number of linear feet of completed installation
 measured along the invert and will include the length through elbows, tees and fittings.
 The number of linear feet will be measured from the center of manhole to center of manhole
 or to the inside face of catch basins and similar type Structures.
 The length of testing sewer pipe in conformance with Section 7-17.3(2) will be the number
 of linear feet of completed installation actually tested.

 8-22  Pavement Marking
 8-22.1 Description
 This Work consists of furnishing, installing, and removing pavement markings upon
 the Roadway surface in accordance with the Plans, Standard Plans, the FHWA publication
 Standard Alphabet for Highway Signs and Pavement Markings and these Specifications,
 at locations shown in the Contract or as ordered by the Engineer in accordance with
 Section 1-04.4.
 Pavement Markings may be either Longitudinal (long) Line Markings or Transverse
 Markings. Longitudinal line markings are generally placed parallel and adjacent to the flow of
 traffic. Transverse markings are generally placed perpendicular and across the flow of traffic.
 Word and symbol markings are classified as transverse markings. Traffic letters used in word
 messages shall be sized as shown in the Plans.
 8-22.2 Materials
 Material for pavement marking shall be paint or plastic as noted in the Bid item meeting
 the requirements of Section 9-34. Glass beads for paint shall meet the requirements of
 Section 9-34.4. Glass beads for plastic shall be as recommended by the material manufacturer.
 8-22.3  Construction Requirements
 8-22.3(1)  Preliminary Spotting
 The Engineer will provide necessary control points at intervals agreed upon with the
 Contractor to assist in preliminary spotting of the lines before marking begins. The Contractor
 shall be responsible for preliminary spotting of the lines to be marked. Approval by the
 Engineer is required before marking begins. Preliminary spotting to guide the striping machine
 is required for all longitudinal lines except where a clearly visible separation is present.
 Preliminary spotting shall be provided at a spacing of 100 feet maximum on tangents and
 25‑feet maximum on curves. The color of the material used for spotting shall match the color
 of the permanent marking.
 8-22.3(2)  Preparation of Roadway Surfaces
 All surfaces shall be dry, free of any loose debris, and within the proper temperature
 range prior to striping. When required by the pavement marking manufacturer’s installation
 instructions, remove pavement markings from pavement surfaces that will adversely
 affect the bond of new pavement marking material to the roadway surface according to
 Section 8-22.3(6).
 Remove all other contaminants from pavement surfaces that may adversely affect the
 installation of new pavement markings by sandblasting, shot-blasting, or sweeping. Air blast
 the pavement with a high-pressure system to remove extraneous or loose material.
 Apply materials to new HMA that is sufficiently cured according to the manufacturer’s
 recommendations. Typically, Type D material applied to new HMA pavement requires a
 pavement cure period of 21 days. This cure period may be reduced if the manufacturer
 performs a successful bond test and approves the reduction of the pavement cure period.
 For new Portland cement concrete surfaces, remove curing compounds and laitance
 by an approved mechanical means. Air blast the pavement with a high-pressure system to
 remove extraneous or loose material. Apply materials to concrete that has reached a minimum
 compressive strength of 2,500 psi and that is sufficiently cured according to the manufacturer’s
 recommendations. Typically, Type D material applied to Portland cement concrete pavement
 requires a pavement cure period of 28 days. This cure period may be reduced if the
 manufacturer performs a successful bond test and approves the reduction of the pavement
 cure period.

 After the pavement surface is clean and dry, apply primer as recommended by the
 manufacturer to the area receiving the pavement markings. Apply the primer in a continuous,
 solid film according to the recommendations of the primer manufacturer and the pavement
 markings manufacturer.
 8-22.3(3)  Marking Application
 8-22.3(3)A  Marking Colors
 Lane line and right edge line shall be white in color. Centerline and left edge line shall
 be yellow in color. Transverse markings shall be white, except as otherwise noted in the
 Standard Plans.
 8-22.3(3)B  Line Patterns
 Solid Line – A continuous line without gaps.
 Broken Line – A line consisting of solid line segments separated by gaps.
 Dotted Line – A broken line with noticeably shorter line segments separated by noticeably
 shorter gaps.
 8-22.3(3)C  Line Surfaces
 Flat Lines – Pavement marking lines with a flat surface.
 Profiled Marking – A profiled pavement marking is a marking that consists of a base line
 thickness and a profiled thickness, which is a portion of the pavement marking line that is
 applied at a greater thickness than the base line thickness. Profiles shall be applied using the
 extruded method in the same application as the base line. The profiles may be slightly rounded
 provided the minimum profile thickness is the same throughout the length of the profile.
 See the Plans for the construction details.
 Embossed Plastic Line – Embossed plastic lines consist of a flat line with transverse
 grooves. An embossed plastic line may also have profiles. See the Plans for the
 construction details.
 8-22.3(3)D  Line Applications
 Surface Line – A line constructed by applying pavement marking material directly to the
 pavement surface or existing pavement marking.
 Grooved Line – A line constructed by grinding or saw cutting a groove into the pavement
 surface and spraying, extruding, or gluing pavement marking material into the groove. Groove
 depth is measured vertically from the bottom of a 2 foot or longer straightedge placed on the
 roadway surface to the ground surface. The groove depth is dependent upon the material used,
 the pavement surface, and the location. See these Standard Specifications, the project Plans,
 and Special Provisions. Grooved line pavement marking shall not be constructed on bridge
 decks or on bridge approach slabs.
 8-22.3(3)E Installation
 Apply pavement marking materials to clean, dry pavement surfaces and according to
 the following:
 1.	 Place material according to the manufacture’s recommendations,
 2.	 Place parallel double lines in one pass,
 3.	 The top of pavement marking shall be smooth and uniform,
 4.	 Line ends shall be square and clean,
 5.	 Place pavement marking lines parallel and true to line, and
 6.	 Place markings in proper alignment with existing markings.
 When applying paint, Type A or Type C material, ensure that both the pavement
 surface and the air temperature at the time of application are not less than 50°F and rising.
 When applying Type B or Type D material, ensure that both the pavement surface and the
 air temperature at the time of application are not less than 40°F and rising.

 rectangular baskets of the required sizes at the construction site. Common-wall construction
 may be used in gabion Structures up to 12 feet high. Common-wall construction includes any
 basket where its top serves as the bottom of the one above it, or where one wall also serves
 an adjacent basket. When gabion Structures are more than 12 feet high, the baskets shall have
 independent sides, ends, top, and bottom.
 Each gabion shall be divided by diaphragms into cells the same length as horizontal basket
 width. Diaphragms shall be made of the same mesh and gage as the basket body.
 All perimeter and diaphragm edges shall be laced or clipped together so that joints are
 at least as strong as the body of the mesh itself. The ends of the lacing shall be anchored by
 three tight turns around the selvage wire.
 8-24.3(3)E  Filling Baskets
 Baskets shall be filled with stone. The stone shall be placed and compacted to meet the
 unit weight requirements of Section 8-24.3(3)F.
 The stone shall be placed in compacted layers not more than 14 inches deep. If crossconnecting wires are required, the Contractor shall adjust the number and depth of layers
 so that wires occur between the compacted layers of stone.
 8-24.3(3)F  Unit Weight Requirements and Test
 The unit weight of the filled gabion basket shall be at least 100 pounds per cubic foot.
 Should the unit weight be less than 100 pounds per cubic foot, the gabion will be rejected and
 the Engineer will require the Contractor to conduct and pass additional unit weight tests before
 completing other gabions.
 The Contractor shall conduct either of the following unit weight tests to prove the density
 of completed gabions:
 1.	 A filled gabion basket shall be selected from the completed Structure and weighed.
 2.	 A gabion basket shall be filled with stone from a loaded truck that has been weighed.
 After filling, the truck and unused stone shall be weighed again. The difference
 between the two weights shall be used to determine the weight per cubic foot of the
 stone in the gabion.
 The Contractor shall conduct one unit weight test for each 500 cubic yards of gabions
 placed. The Engineer may reduce the specified frequency of these tests provided the
 specified minimum unit weight has been consistently achieved.
 In conducting unit weight test 1 or 2, the Contractor shall provide and use scales
 conforming to Section 1-09.2.
 8-24.3(3)G  Gabion Cribbing Erection
 Each row or tier of baskets shall be reasonably straight and shall conform to alignment
 and grade. Hexagonal mesh baskets shall be stretched endwise before filling. The stone
 shall be carefully placed in layers, then tamped or vibrated. The last layer of stones shall fill
 each basket completely so that the secured lid will rest upon the stones. Each basket shall
 be laced securely to all adjacent baskets and its lid then laced or clipped to the sides, ends,
 and diaphragms.
 All selvage wires of ends of adjacent baskets shall be laced together. The bottom selvage
 of the basket being constructed on a previously constructed basket shall be laced to the top
 of that basket.
 Backfilling behind or around gabions shall conform to Section 2-09.3(1)E.

 9-00  Definitions and Tests
 9-00.1  Fracture
 “Fractured aggregate is defined as an angular, rough, or broken surface of an aggregate
 particle created by crushing, or by other means. A face is considered a “fractured face”
 whenever one-half or more of the projected area, when viewed normal to that face, is fractured
 with sharp and well-defined edges: this excludes small nicks.
 9-00.2  Wood Waste
 Wood waste is defined as all material which, after drying to constant weight, has a specific
 gravity of less than 1.0.
 9-00.3  Test for Mass of Galvanizing
 At the option of the Engineer, the weight of zinc in ounce per square foot required by the
 various galvanizing Specifications may be determined by an approved magnetic thickness
 gage suitably checked and demonstrated for accuracy, in lieu of the other methods specified.
 9-00.4  Sieves for Testing Purposes
 Test sieves shall be made of either: (1) woven wire cloth conforming to AASHTO
 Designation M 92 or ASTM Designation E 11, or (2) square-hole, perforated plates
 conforming to ASTM Designation E 323.
 9-00.5  Dust Ratio
 The dust ratio is defined as the percent of material passing the No. 200 sieve divided by
 the percent of material passing the No. 40 sieve.
 9-00.6  Sand/Silt Ratio
 The sand/silt ratio is defined as the percent of material passing the No. 10 sieve divided
 by the percent of material passing the No. 200 sieve.
 9-00.7  Galvanized Hardware, AASHTO M232
 An acceptable alternate to hot-dip galvanizing in accordance with AASHTO M 232 will
 be zinc coatings mechanically deposited in accordance with AASHTO M 298, providing the
 minimum thickness of zinc coating is not less than that specified in AASHTO M232, and the
 process will not produce hydrogen embrittlement in the base metal. Sampling and testing will
 be made by the Engineer in accordance with commonly recognized national standards and
 methods used in the laboratory of the Department of Transportation.
 9-00.8  Sand Equivalent
 The sand equivalent will be the average of duplicate determinations from a single
 sample. The sand equivalent sample will be prepared in accordance with the FOP for
 AASHTO T 176.
 For acceptance, there must be a clear line of demarcation. If no clear line of demarcation
 has formed at the end of a 30-minute sedimentation period, the material will be considered
 as failing to meet the minimum specified sand equivalent.
 9-00.9  Field Test Procedures
 Field test procedures may be either a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) or a Field
 Operating Procedure (FOP) for an AASHTO, ASTM, or WAQTC test procedure. A Field
 Operating Procedure is a technically equivalent abridged version of an AASHTO, ASTM, or
 WAQTC test procedure for use in field conditions. References to manuals containing all of
 these tests and procedures can be found in Section 1-06.2(1).

 manufacture, except, however, that if Type III cement has been used, the units may be shipped
 14 days after manufacture.
 9-18.1(15)  Sampling and Inspection
 The Contractor shall submit, for the approval of the Engineer, an advance sample of curb
 which shall be at least equivalent in color, surface texture, and bottom finish to the standard as
 set forth in these Specifications. No repairing of any kind shall be done on the advance sample.
 Upon approval, the advance sample shall be stored at the plant or site of manufacture in a
 location readily accessible to the Inspector where there is adequate daylight for examination.
 The advance sample shall be protected from damage and discoloration and shall be used as a
 standard of comparison for color, surface texture, and bottom finish for all curb manufactured.
 All curb furnished shall be equivalent in the foregoing respects.
 The inspection at the plant will be made just prior to shipment, at which time examination
 will be made of the alignment, contour, color, cracks, surface damage or discoloration,
 broken corners or edges, and any other defects which may have developed, and to check
 the laboratory test reports for strength. However intermediate inspections may be made to
 determine surface checking and hidden air holes if it is impractical to examine for these
 defects at the final inspection.

 The wet performance measurements on unweathered sheeting shall be conducted in
 accordance with one of the following methods:
 1.	 The standard rainfall test specified in Federal Specification LS 300C and the brightness
 of the reflective sheeting totally wet by rain shall not be less than 90 percent of the
 above values.
 2.	 Samples shall be submerged in a tank of clean water (approximately 72°F) for a
 period of 5 minutes. Reflex-reflective performance of the sheeting shall be viewed
 in a darkened room by reflected light through the surface of the water or through a
 transparent plane surface of the tank parallel to the sample surface. Light source shall
 be such as a hand flashlight held close to the eye. The wet sheeting shall show no
 apparent loss of reflective performance as compared to dry material.
 The sheeting shall conform to the applicable daytime color and luminance factor
 requirements of ASTM D4956 when tested instrumentally in accordance with Section 8.4
 of that Specification; OR, the diffuse day color of the reflective sheeting shall be visually
 evaluated by comparison with the applicable Highway Color Tolerance Chart. Color
 comparison shall be made under north daylight or a scientific daylight having a color
 temperature from 6500 degrees to 7500 degrees Kelvin. Daytime color evaluation shall be
 illuminated at 45 degrees and viewed at 90 degrees. There shall be no significant color shift
 when viewed under nighttime (retroreflective) conditions.
 The reflective sheeting shall have a pre-coated pressure sensitive adhesive (Class 1) or a
 heat-activated adhesive (Class 2) either of which will adhere to flat, clean surfaces without
 necessity of additional adhesive coats on the reflective sheeting or application surface.
 Chemical activators shall not be used to activate Class 2 adhesive. The pre-coated adhesive
 shall be protected by an easily removed liner which, when removed, shall not have a staining
 effect on the reflective sheeting and shall be mildew resistant. The protective liner attached

 to the adhesive shall be removable by peeling without soaking in water or other solvents
 and shall be easily removed after storage for 4 hours at 150ºF under weight of 215 psi.
 The sheeting with liner removed, conditioned for 24 hours at 72°F and 50 percent relative
 humidity, shall be sufficiently flexible to show no cracking when bent around a 1.2-inch
 diameter mandrel with the adhesive side contacting the mandrel. For ease of testing, talcum
 powder may be spread on the adhesive to prevent sticking to the mandrel. The sheeting
 surface shall be smooth and flat to facilitate self-cleaning in the rain, regular cleaning, and
 wet performance, and exhibit 85 degrees glossmeter rating of not less than 50 when tested in
 accordance with ASTM D523. The sheeting surface shall be readily processed and compatible
 with transparent and opaque process colors and show no loss of the color coat with normal
 handling, cutting, and application. The sheeting shall permit cutting and color processing at
 temperatures of 60°F to 100°F and 20 to 80 percent RH. The sheeting shall be heat resistant
 and permit force curing without staining of unapplied sheeting or applied sheeting at
 temperatures recommended by the manufacturer not to exceed 150°F for unapplied sheeting or
 200°F for applied sheeting. The sheeting surface shall be solvent resistant to permit cleaning
 by wiping with a clean soft cloth dampened with VM&P Naphtha or mineral spirits.
 The adhesive shall form a durable bond to smooth, corrosion and weather resistant surfaces
 and permit the reflective sheeting to adhere securely, 48 hours after application at temperatures
 of -30°F to 200°F. The adhesive bond shall be sufficient to render the applied sheeting vandalresistant and prevent its shocking off when subjected to an impact energy of 20 ft. lbs. applied
 with a hemispherical tipped object 1 inch in diameter at -0°F. The test specimen shall be
 applied to aluminum backing not less than 0.080 inch thick and having a dimension of not less
 than 4 inches square. During testing, the specimen shall be supported on a 3-inch diameter ring.
 The adhesion test shall conform to ASTM D4956 with the addition of the temperatures
 noted above.
 The resistance to accelerated weathering shall be as described in ASTM D4956 except the
 weathering apparatus and procedure shall be in accordance with ASTM G154.
 The reflective sheeting shall be sufficiently flexible to be cut to shape easily and permit
 application over, and conform to, moderate shallow embossing characteristic of certain
 sign borders and symbols. The tensile strength of the sheeting shall be 5 to 20 pounds per
 square inch width when conditioned for 48 hours in accordance to ASTM D685 and tested in
 accordance with ASTM D828. Following liner removal, the reflective sheeting shall not shrink
 more than ¹⁄32 inch in 10 minutes nor more than ⅛ inch in 24 hours in any dimension per 9 inch
 square at 72°F and 50 percent relative humidity.
 The sheeting, when applied according to manufacturer’s recommendations to cleaned
 and etched 0.020 by 2 by 8-inch aluminum, conditioned (24 hours) and tested at 72°F and
 50 percent relative humidity, shall be sufficiently flexible to show no cracking when bent
 around a ¾-inch diameter mandrel.
 9-28.12(1) Application
 The reflective sheeting shall be applied in the manner specified by the sheeting
 manufacturer. The applied sign face shall not have bubbles, wrinkles, or foreign material
 beneath the reflective sheeting.
