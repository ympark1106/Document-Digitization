 WORDING OF SPECIFICATIONS
 Since the 2014 edition, the Minnesota Department of Transportation’s Standard Specification for Construction (Standard
 Specifications) has emphasized the active voice. In Division 1, the Contractor’s and Department’s responsibilities are written in the
 active voice-indicative mood. In a sentence written in the active voice-indicative mood, someone acts on something. For example:
 “The Engineer will take a sample.”
 In Divisions 2 and 3, only the Department’s responsibilities are written in the active voice-indicative mood.
 In Divisions 2 and 3, the Contractor’s responsibilities are written in active voice-imperative mood; the Department states
 its requirements or directions for performing the work to the Contractor. The imperative mood is used when the party issuing an
 instruction and the party receiving it are already understood. Such statements have the same force as if they contained the word
 “shall” and are considered mandatory. In an imperative sentence such as, “Pour the concrete,” the Department is indicating that it
 requires the Contractor to pour the concrete. In the material specifications in Division 3, the subject may also be the supplier,
 fabricator, or manufacturer supplying the materials, products, or equipment for use on the project.

 A review of this additional information is not a substitute for a Bidder’s own evaluation, interpretation, or judgment in
 preparing a Proposal. Bidders shall understand that this additional information is not part of the Proposal Package and will not
 become part of the Contract. The Department makes this additional information available for the Bidders’ information only and
 warns the Bidders not to rely on any included estimates or quantities. If not included in the Proposal Package, the additional
 information may be available upon request, and Bidders shall be deemed to have knowledge of the availability of this additional
 information. Bidders are solely responsible for all assumptions, deductions, and conclusions that they may reach. The Department
 does not make or imply a warranty as to the accuracy, sufficiency, or reliability of this additional information.

 Contractor.
 The Department may have taken some borings to gather information for purposes other than those related to
 the construction of the Project.
 The Department does not warrant that the information is complete, but believes that the information as to the
 conditions and materials reported within each test hole was accurate at the time the boring was taken.
 The Department does not warrant that conditions adjacent to test borings will necessarily be the same as
 shown on the logs because subsurface conditions outside of each individual test hole are unknown to the
 Department, and soil, rock, and water conditions cannot be relied upon to be consistent and uniform.
 The Department will not be responsible for any interpretations made by the Contractor.
 The absence of notations on the logs regarding water does not necessarily mean that the borings were dry or
 that the Contractor will not encounter subsurface water during the course of construction.

 The Department and the lowest responsible Bidder may mutually agree to extend the time within which the Department
 makes the Award.
 1303
 
 CANCELLATION OF AWARD
 Before Contract execution, the Department reserves the right to cancel the Award of the Contract without liability.
 
 1304
 
 RETURN OF PROPOSAL GUARANTY
 After opening and auditing the Proposals, the Department will immediately return Proposal Guaranties to all Bidders,
 except for the two lowest Bidders. The Department will retain the Proposal Guaranties of the two lowest Bidders until execution
 and approval of the Contract as required by law. After execution and approval of the Contract, the Department will return the
 Proposal Guaranties of the two lowest Bidders, except in the case of forfeiture as specified in 1307, “Failure to Execute Contract.”
 The Department will only return Proposal Guaranties that the Bidders submit as checks (certified or cashier’s).
 1305
 
 REQUIREMENT OF CONTRACT BOND
 The lowest responsible Bidder shall submit with the signed Contract a Payment Bond and a Performance Bond each equal
 to the Contract Amount as required by MN Statute § 574.26. The Department will review the Surety and form of the Contract
 Bonds and provide approval if acceptable.
 1306
 
 EXECUTION AND APPROVAL OF CONTRACT
 The lowest responsible Bidder shall return the Contract to the Department with the required Payment and Performance
 Bonds within 10 business days after Award.
 If the Contract specifies the Contract Time as working days and the lowest responsible Bidder fails to return the signed
 Contract documents within 10 business days, the Department may reduce the Contract Time to reflect the delay caused by the
 Contractor.
 If the Contract specifies the Contract Time as a completion date, the lowest responsible Bidder’s delay in returning the
 signed Contract documents is non-excusable delay under 1806.3.A, “Non-Excusable Delays,” and the Contractor is not entitled to an
 extension of the Contract Time.
 If the lowest responsible Bidder is unable to return the signed Contract documents within the specified time due to the
 absence of one or more of the required signers, the Department may extend the time if the Contractor submits satisfactory
 evidence that the Contract documents will be signed.
 A foreign or nonresident corporation that is awarded a Contract shall provide proof that it has met all legal requirements
 for transacting business in the State of Minnesota, as a condition precedent to Contract approval.
 The Department will provide the lowest responsible Bidder with a notice of approval or disapproval of the Contract and
 Contract Bonds within 10 business days after the lowest responsible Bidder properly signs and returns the Contract documents to
 the Department. The Award is not binding and the Contract is not effective until both parties fully execute the Contract and the
 Department approves the Contract, as required by law.
 1307
 
 FAILURE TO EXECUTE CONTRACT
 The Department will retain the Proposal Guaranty as liquidated damages sustained, not as a penalty, if the lowest
 responsible Bidder fails to perform any of the following within the time specified in the Proposal Package:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 Sign the Contract documents,
 Provide the required Contract Bonds, or
 Comply with any other requirements imposed as a condition precedent to the Contract approval.
 
 If the Department cancels the Award, the Department may choose any of the following actions:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 Award the Contract to the next lowest responsible Bidder,
 Advertise for new Proposals, or
 Otherwise perform the Work as decided by the Department.

 INTENT OF CONTRACT
 The intent of the Contract is to provide for construction of the Project and compensation for the Work in accordance with
 the Contract documents.
 The titles and headings of the various sections and subsections of the Contract are intended for convenience of reference.
 The Contractor shall construct and complete the Project in every detail as described in the Contract. The Department will
 require the Contractor to perform the Work diligently and vigorously to completion. The Contractor shall consider the public
 interests and the obligations and rights of all other parties concerned. The Contractor shall assume full responsibility for
 performance of the Work and shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, tools, supplies, transportation, and other incidentals
 necessary or convenient for successful completion of the Project.
 The Contract may not fully describe every detail. When the Contract is silent or omits a detailed description, the
 Contractor shall perform in accordance with the best general practice and provide materials and workmanship meeting the quality
 specified in the Contract. The Department’s failure to itemize every exception or condition in the Contract does not mean that the
 Contract provisions will be enforced equally under all conditions or on all parts of the Work.
 In the interest of avoiding repetitious wording in the Specifications, certain words and phrases have been omitted where
 reference is clearly related by expressions of authority or intention. Where certain words and terms appear, they are to be
 construed with reference to the definitions, abbreviations, heading, titles, item names, and other pertinent provisions of the
 Contract documents, as may be implied.
 1402
 
 CONTRACT REVISIONS
 
 1402.1 GENERAL
 The Engineer reserves the right to make, in writing, at any time during the progress of the work, such changes in
 quantities and such alterations in the work as are necessary to satisfactorily complete the project or for reasons of the Department’s
 interest. Revisions to the Contract will not add Work beyond the limitations imposed by law or beyond the termini of the proposed
 construction except as may be necessary to satisfactorily complete the Project. Revisions to the Contract neither invalidate the
 Contract nor release the surety, and the Contractor agrees to perform the Work as revised. Either party to the Contract may assert
 that a Contract revision has occurred.
 If the Contractor believes it has encountered a Contract revision as set forth in 1402.2, “Differing Site Conditions,”
 1402.3, “Significant Changes to the Character of Work,” 1402.4, “Suspensions of Work Ordered by the Engineer,” 1402.5, “Extra
 Work,” or 1402.6, “Eliminated Items,” the Contractor shall provide notice as required by these clauses and as required by 1403,
 “Notification for Contract Revisions.” Failure to provide notice as specified in 1403, “Notification for Contract Revisions” constitutes
 a waiver of the Contractor’s entitlement to compensation or a time extension and releases the Department from responsibility for
 providing compensation or a time extension.
 If the Engineer concludes that a Contract revision is necessary, the Department will compensate the Contractor for the
 revision in accordance with 1904, “Compensation for Contract Revisions,” 1905, “Compensation for Eliminated Items,” and 1907,
 “Payment for Surplus Material.” No payment, except as specifically provided by the payment provisions of the Contract, will be
 made for any increased expenses, loss of expected reimbursement, or loss of anticipated profits suffered or asserted by the
 Contractor, whether resulting directly from revisions in the Work or indirectly from unbalanced allocation of expenses among the
 Contract Items, for any variation between the quantities in the Bid Schedule and the actual quantities ordered and performed, or
 from any other cause. If necessary, the Engineer may extend time in accordance with 1806, “Determination and Extension of
 Contract Time.”
 In 1402.2, “Differing Site Conditions,” 1402.3, “Significant Changes to the Character of the Work,” and 1402.4,
 “Suspensions of Work Ordered by the Engineer,” the term “adjustment” means compensation in accordance with 1904,
 “Compensation for Contract Revisions,” 1905, “Compensation for Eliminated Items,” and 1907, “Payment for Surplus Material,” and
 the granting of a time extension in accordance with 1806, “Determination and Extension of Contract Time.”
 1402.2 DIFFERING SITE CONDITIONS
 During the progress of the work, if one of the following subsurface or latent physical conditions is encountered at the site,
 the party encountering such conditions shall promptly notify the other party in writing of the specific differing conditions before they
 are disturbed and before the affected work is performed:
 (1)
 
 18
 
 Differ materially from those indicated in the Contract, or
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 1402.5
 (2)
 
 If unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature, differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and
 generally recognized as inherent in the Work provided for in the Contract.
 
 Upon written notification, the Engineer will investigate the conditions. If the Engineer determines that the conditions
 materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time required for the performance of any Work under the
 Contract, the Engineer will make an adjustment, excluding loss of anticipated profits, and will modify the Contract in writing
 accordingly. The Engineer will notify the Contractor of the determination whether or not an adjustment of the Contract is
 warranted.
 The Department will not allow a Contract adjustment that results in a benefit to the Contractor, unless the Contractor has
 provided the required written notice.
 1402.3 SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE CHARACTER OF WORK
 The Engineer reserves the right to make, in writing, at any time during the progress of the work, such changes in
 quantities and such alterations in the work as are necessary to satisfactorily complete the project. Such changes in quantities and
 alterations shall not invalidate the contract nor release the Surety, and the Contractor agrees to perform the work as altered.
 If the alterations or changes in quantities significantly change the character of the work under contract, whether those
 alterations or changes are in themselves significant changes to the character of the work or, by affecting other work, cause such
 other work to become significantly different in character, an adjustment, excluding loss of anticipated profits, will be made to the
 contract. The Contractor and Department shall agree on the basis for an adjustment in writing before the performance of the work.
 If the Contractor and Department cannot agree, the Engineer will make an adjustment either for or against the Contractor in such
 amount as the Engineer determines to be fair and equitable.
 If the alterations or changes in quantities do not significantly change the character of the work under the contract, the
 Department will pay for the altered work as provided elsewhere in the contract.
 The term "significant change" shall be construed to apply only to the following circumstances:
 (1)
 (2)
 
 When the character of the work as altered differs materially in kind or nature from that involved or included in
 the original proposed construction, or
 When a major contract item of work is increased in excess of 125 percent or decreased below 75 percent of the
 original Contract quantity. Any allowance for an increase in quantity shall apply only to that portion in excess of
 125 percent of the original contract item quantity, or in case of a decrease below 75 percent, to the actual
 amount of work performed.
 
 1402.4 SUSPENSIONS OF WORK ORDERED BY THE ENGINEER
 If the performance of all or any portion of the work is suspended or delayed by the Engineer in writing for an
 unreasonable period of time (not originally anticipated, customary, or inherent to the construction industry) and the Contractor
 believes that additional compensation, or contract time, or both are due as a result of such suspension or delay, the Contractor shall
 submit to the Engineer in writing a request for adjustment no later than 7 calendar days after receipt of notice to resume work.
 The request shall set forth the reasons and support for such adjustment.
 Upon receipt, the Engineer will evaluate the Contractor's request. If the Engineer agrees that the cost, or time required
 for the performance of the Contract, or both have increased as a result of such suspension and the suspension was caused by
 conditions beyond the control of and not the fault of the Contractor, its suppliers, or subcontractors, and not caused by weather,
 the Engineer will make an adjustment (excluding profit) and modify the contract in writing accordingly. The Engineer will notify the
 Contractor of the determination whether or not an adjustment of the contract is warranted.
 The Department will not allow a contract adjustment unless the Contractor has submitted the request for adjustment
 within the time prescribed.
 The Department will not allow a contract adjustment under this clause to the extent that performance would have been
 suspended or delayed by any other cause, or for which an adjustment is provided for or excluded under any other term or condition
 of this Contract.
 1402.5 EXTRA WORK
 If the Contractor believes that it has been required to perform Extra Work, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer in
 accordance with 1403, “Notification for Contract Revisions.” Failure to provide notice as specified in 1403 constitutes a waiver of
 the Contractor’s entitlement to compensation or a time extension and releases the Department from responsibility from providing
 compensation or a time extension. If the Engineer determines, in the Engineer’s sole discretion, that Extra Work is required, the
 Department will compensate the Contractor for Extra Work in accordance with 1904, “Compensation for Contract Revisions,” and
 determine the appropriate time extension, if any, in accordance with 1806, “Determination and Extension of Contract Time.”
 The Department and the Contractor shall execute a Change Order specifying the location and nature of the work to be
 performed and the basis of payment before the Contractor is authorized to perform Extra Work. The Contractor shall perform Extra
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 19
 
 1402.5
 Work in accordance with the specifications unless otherwise specified in the Change Order authorizing the Extra Work. The Change
 Order authorizing Extra Work shall not become effective until it has been fully executed and approved as required by law.
 If the Contractor performs Extra Work before a Change Order is fully executed, the Department may consider this as
 unauthorized work and as having been done at the Contractor’s expense. The Department will compensate the Contractor for this
 work only if the Engineer determines that the work is acceptable and necessary, and the Change Order has been fully executed.
 1402.6 ELIMINATED ITEMS
 If the Department eliminates any Contract Items from the Contract, the Department will reimburse the Contractor for all
 costs incurred before notification that are not the result of unauthorized Work.
 The Department will compensate the Contractor in accordance with 1905, “Compensation for Eliminated Items.”
 1403
 
 NOTIFICATION FOR CONTRACT REVISIONS
 
 1403.1 GENERAL
 The following notification requirements apply to all potential Contract revisions including those defined in 1402, “Contract
 Revisions.” The Engineer will consider requests for Contract revisions only if the notification procedures in this section are followed.
 The specified time limits may only be extended through a written, jointly-signed agreement between the Contractor and the
 Engineer. The Engineer will address the underlying issue prompting the notification in a timely manner.
 1403.2 FIRST NOTICE, BY CONTRACTOR
 The Contractor shall notify the Engineer as soon as a Contract revision appears necessary. The Contractor shall not start
 or continue with an activity or Contract Item for which a Contract revision may be necessary without authorization from the

 The Contractor shall also leave the Project Site, including borrow pits, in a condition acceptable to the Engineer. The cost
 of final cleanup is included in the Contract Unit Prices of the Contract Items.
 1408
 
 VALUE ENGINEERING INCENTIVE
 Value engineering provisions provide an incentive to the Contractor to initiate, develop, and present cost reduction
 proposals involving changes in the Contract requirements to the Department for consideration.
 Value engineering provisions only apply if the Contractor specifically submits a proposal for consideration as a value
 engineering proposal.
 The cost reduction proposals shall produce a net savings to the Contract by providing less costly items or methods than
 those specified in the Contract without impairing essential functions and characteristics.
 The Contractor shall submit value engineering proposals to the Engineer with the following information:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 (5)
 (6)
 
 22
 
 A statement that the Contractor is submitting a value engineering proposal;
 A description of the proposal;
 An itemization of the proposed changes to the Contract requirements and a recommendation of how to make
 each change;
 An estimate of the reduction in performance costs that will result from adoption of the proposal;
 A prediction of any effects the proposed changes would have on other costs incurred by the Department;
 A statement of the time by which an agreement for adoption of the proposal must be executed to obtain the
 maximum cost reduction during the remainder of the Contract, and the reasoning for this time schedule;
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 1408
 (7)
 (8)
 
 The dates of any previous submissions of the proposal, including Contract numbers and the actions of the
 Department; and
 A statement as to the effect the proposal would have on the time for completion of the Contract.
 
 The Department will not assume any liability for not meeting the statement of the time described in the Contractor’s value
 engineering proposal. The Contractor may withdraw, in whole or in part, any value engineering proposal not accepted by the
 Department within the period identified in the proposal. The Department’s acceptance or rejection decision on a value engineering
 proposal shall be final and the provisions of 1517, “Claims for Compensation Adjustment,” will not apply.
 The Department will notify the Contractor in writing of its decision regarding each value engineering proposal. Until the
 Department accepts the proposal, the Contractor shall continue to perform Work in accordance with the requirements of the
 Contract. If the Department accepts the proposal, the Department will execute a Supplemental Agreement setting forth the terms,
 conditions, and costs of the proposal. If the Contractor performs any Work performed in accordance with the value engineering
 proposal before the execution of the Supplemental Agreement, the Department will consider that “unauthorized work” as specified
 in 1512, “Unacceptable and Unauthorized Work.”
 The Supplemental Agreement will establish the Contract modifications and the agreed net savings. The Department will
 calculate the net savings by subtracting the Contractor’s value engineering proposal cost from the Contractor’s original bid price for
 the work covered in the value engineering proposal.
 A - Contractor’s value engineering proposal cost.
 B - Contractor’s original bid price for the work covered in the value engineering proposal.
 B - A= Net Savings.
 The department reserves the right to reject any value engineering proposal that does not reflect the reasonable costs to
 perform the work covered in the value engineering proposal.
 The Department will provide a lump sum payment of 50 percent of the net savings from the value engineering proposal
 to the Contractor as the Contractor’s share of the value engineering incentive. The Department will not revise the lump sum
 payment even if the final accepted quantities vary. The Department may include conditions for consideration, approval, and
 implementation of the cost reduction proposal in the Supplemental Agreement.
 The Contractor shall design and develop the proposal at no additional cost to the Department.
 The Department will not include the costs incurred for reviewing, approving, and implementing the proposal in the net
 savings calculations.
 After the Department accepts the cost reduction proposal, any restrictions imposed by the Contractor on its use or
 disclosure of the information submitted shall be void, and the Department will have the right to use, duplicate, and disclose any
 data necessary to use the proposal.

 1503
 Contract.
 
 Accuracy of dimensions and details,
 Agreement and conformity with the Contract,
 Successful completion of the Work,
 Proper and safe design,
 Proper and safe construction of the Work, and
 Means and methods of performing the Work.
 
 CONFORMITY WITH CONTRACT DOCUMENTS
 The Contractor shall perform all Work, including providing all Materials, in conformance with the requirements of the
 
 Dimensions and values required by the Contract are target dimensions or values. The Department will accept deviations
 from these targets within the tolerances required by the Contract. Materials and workmanship shall be uniform in character and
 shall conform to the target or to the middle portion of the tolerance range. The purpose of the tolerance range is to accommodate
 occasional minor variations from the target or middle portion of the tolerance range that are unavoidable for practical reasons. If
 the Contract requires a maximum or minimum dimension or value, the Contractor shall control the production and processing of
 Material and the performance of the Work so that the Material or workmanship is not of borderline quality or dimension. If the
 Contract does not specify a tolerance for a requirement, the Engineer will accept an industry standard tolerance. If the Engineer
 determines that Materials or workmanship are consistently of borderline quality, the Engineer may direct the Contractor to suspend
 operations and may declare future Work of borderline quality to be unauthorized work in accordance with 1512, “Unacceptable and
 Unauthorized Work.”
 In constructing temporary facilities that do not become a part of the permanent improvement, the Engineer may waive
 requirements that the Engineer considers unnecessary in fulfilling the intended service or function of the facility. The Engineer may
 accept alternative designs from those required for temporary construction provided that costs to the Department do not exceed
 those that the Department would have incurred with the design required by the Contract.
 1504

 UTILITY PROPERTY AND SERVICE
 
 1507.1 GENERAL
 The Contract will specify the utilities affected by the Project. The Department will direct the utility owners affected by the
 project to relocate or adjust their facilities and related appurtenances within the Project Site at no additional cost to the Contractor,
 unless the Contract makes the Contractor responsible for relocating or adjusting designated utility facilities.
 The Department expects utility owners to complete utility relocations and adjustments as indicated in the Contract. The
 Contractor shall provide adequate notification of the scheduled Work to utility owners relocating or adjusting facilities during
 construction to prevent conflict with the Contractor’s schedule of operations.
 following:
 
 By submitting a Proposal for the Project as a Bidder, the Contractor has acknowledged that it has considered the
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 26
 
 The temporary and permanent utility facilities identified in the Contract,
 The existing location and the designed relocations of all utility facilities as shown on the Plans, and
 The precautions required to protect utility facilities in the Project site during construction activities.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 1508
 If utility owners fail to relocate or adjust their facilities as required by the Department and the Contractor sustains losses
 that could not have been avoided by the judicious handling of forces, equipment, and plant, or by reasonable revisions to the
 schedule of operations, the Engineer will adjust the Contract in accordance with 1402, “Contract Revisions.”
 All utilities related to this Project are classified as "Level D." This utility quality level was determined according to the
 guidelines of CI/ASCE 38-02, entitled "Standard Guidelines for the Collection and Depiction of Existing Subsurface Utility Data."
 The Contractor agrees that it shall use the Plan to identify the location of MnDOT storm water drainage facilities in order
 to meet the requirements of Minnesota Statutes Ch. 216D and Minnesota Rules 7560.0250 which apply to MnDOT storm water
 drainage facilities.
 1507.2 NOTIFICATION

 implement that statute. The Contractor's obligations include but are not limited to marking the proposed excavation, contacting
 “Gopher State One Call” at least 48 h before starting excavation operations (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Holidays), and
 providing support and protection for underground facilities in and near the construction area.
 When the Contractor works near electric power lines, the Contractor must provide for protection of personnel and the
 electrical power lines. The Contractor may work with the lines energized if the work can be done safely, otherwise the Contractor
 must:
 (1)
 
 (2)
 
 Make arrangements with the power company, at no expense to the Department, to:
 (a) temporarily shut off the power,
 (b) temporarily insulate the power line(s),
 (c) bypass the power from the work area, or
 Make other arrangements necessary for a safe work place.
 
 The Department makes no promises or representation as to whether the utility will temporarily shut off power, insulate its
 line(s), or charge the Contractor a fee for preparing a safe work area for the Contractor.
 The Contractor shall employ special equipment or construction methods, and hand labor if necessary, to accomplish the
 planned work adjacent to utility facilities without damaging them.
 Any work performed by the Contractor that does not comply with MnDOT 1507.2 may be considered Unauthorized Work
 in accordance with MnDOT 1512.2.
 1507.3 LIABILITY
 If the existence and approximate location of utility property was available to the Contractor before the damage occurred,
 the Contractor shall reimburse the utility owner for damage to the utility property caused by the Contractor’s operations at no
 additional cost to the Department.
 1508
 
 CONSTRUCTION STAKES, LINES, AND GRADES
 The Engineer will set construction stakes to establish lines, slopes, elevations, and continuous profile grades for grading,
 base, and pavement construction to establish the field control for the Project. The Engineer will also set construction stakes to
 establish location, line, and grade controls for drainage facilities, traffic control and protection devices, and other accessory
 structures and appurtenances.
 For Bridge construction, the Engineer will set stakes to establish the field control and working points as shown on the
 Bridge layout sheet in the Plans. The Engineer will set at least one bench mark in the vicinity of each Substructure unit for the
 Contractor's reference when excavating these units. The Engineer will set grade points for the Substructure and Superstructure
 forms, and provide beam stool heights as deemed necessary for performance of the Work.
 From the field control, the Contractor shall establish other necessary controls, detail dimensions, and measurements
 required for proper layout and performance of the Work. The Contractor shall assume full responsibility for all measurements made
 from the stakes and marks established by the Engineer.

 (4)
 
 Contract.
 
 Inspect the Work and the preparation, fabrication, or manufacture of Materials;
 Notify the Contractor of non-conforming Work;
 Reject non-conforming materials; and
 Suspend portions of the Work for the following reasons that require a decision by the Engineer:
 (4.1)
 Interpretation of requirements in the Contract,
 (4.2)
 Performance of unacceptable or unauthorized Work in accordance with 1512, or,
 (4.3)
 Safety.
 
 Inspectors do not have authorization to alter or waive requirements of the Contract or to issue instructions contrary to the
 
 Inspectors do not have an obligation or have authorization to provide direction, superintendence, or guidance to the
 Contractor, its crews, its Subcontractors, or suppliers to accomplish the Work.
 Any action or inaction of the Inspector does not waive the Department’s right to pursue any and all legal remedies for
 defective Work or Work performed by the Contractor in an unworkmanlike manner.
 1511
 
 INSPECTION OF WORK
 The Engineer may inspect Materials and the Work. The Contractor shall provide the Engineer or the Engineer’s
 representative access to the Work, information, and assistance necessary to conduct a complete inspection. The Contractor shall
 notify the Engineer at least 24 h before required inspections.
 The purpose of Department inspections is to determine whether the Work meets the requirements of the Contract. The
 Department inspections do not supplement or replace the Contractor’s own quality control and do not relieve the Contractor of its
 responsibility to correct nonconforming Work.
 If directed by the Engineer, the Contractor shall remove or uncover completed Work for inspection. After the Engineer’s
 inspection, the Contractor shall restore the Work as required by the Contract. If the inspected Work meets the Contract
 requirements, the Department will consider the Work to uncover or remove and restore the Work as Extra Work in accordance with
 1402, “Contract Revisions.” If the inspected Work does not meet the Contract requirements, the Department will not pay for the
 Work to uncover or remove and restore the Work. The Department is not responsible for Contractor losses if the removals or
 uncovering of completed Work revealed nonconforming Work or Materials.
 The Department will determine the level of inspection for any item of Work. The Contractor is responsible for the quality
 of Work and compliance with the Contract requirements regardless of the Department’s level of inspection.
 The Department will consider any Work performed or Materials used without the required certification, testing, or
 inspection by the Department as unauthorized Work in accordance with 1512.2, “Unauthorized Work.”
 The Engineer’s failure to reject nonconforming Work or Materials, from lack of discovery of the nonconforming Work or
 Materials or for any other reason, will not:
 (1)
 (2)
 
 Prevent the Department from rejecting the nonconforming Work or Materials upon later discovery, or
 Obligate the Department to issue final acceptance of the Contract in accordance with 1516.4, “Final Contract
 Acceptance.”
 
 Inspection of Work may include inspection by representatives of other government agencies, railroad corporations, or utility owners
 that pay a portion of the cost of the Work. This inspection will not make these other government agencies, railroad corporations, or
 utility owners a party to the Contract and will not interfere with the rights of the Contractor or Department.
 1512
 
 UNACCEPTABLE AND UNAUTHORIZED WORK
 1512.1 UNACCEPTABLE WORK
 The Department will consider all Work and Materials that do not meet the Contract requirements to be unacceptable.
 
 For unacceptable Work resulting from poor workmanship, use of nonconforming materials, damage through carelessness,
 or any other cause existing before final acceptance of the Work, the Department will take one of the following actions, at the
 Engineer’s sole discretion:
 
 28
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 1513
 (1)
 (2)

 (4)
 
 Require the Contractor to acceptably correct the Work and Materials, immediately upon receipt of written order
 to do so; or
 Allow the work to remain in place at an adjusted Contract Unit Price; or
 Decide the extent of acceptance for the Work to remain in place if a Contract Item fails to meet Contract
 requirements but is adequate to serve the design purpose, and document the basis of acceptance by Change
 Order to adjust the Contract Unit Price; the adjusted Contract Unit Price will be determined at the Engineer’s
 sole discretion; or
 Require the Contractor to remove and replace the unacceptable Work at the Engineer’s sole discretion.
 
 The Department may provide notice of default in accordance with 1808, “Default of Contractor,” after the Contractor has
 been given proper notice to acceptably correct the Work and Materials, and has failed to do so.
 The Contractor shall remove and replace the unacceptable Work, or correct the work, at no additional cost to the
 Department if a Contract Item does not meet specified requirements and results in Work that does not serve the design purpose.
 1512.2 UNAUTHORIZED WORK
 The Department will consider Work performed contrary to the direction of the Engineer, or any work performed beyond
 that specified in the Contract or directed by the Engineer to be unauthorized.
 The Department may consider the following as unauthorized Work:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 Work performed before the Engineer provides lines or grades or required inspections of Materials,
 Work performed before the Department’s approval of the Contract as required by law,
 Extra Work performed before Engineer approval of a Change Order.
 
 The Contractor shall remove unauthorized Work upon receipt of a written order to do so, at no additional cost to the
 Department.
 The Department may pay for unauthorized Work only if the Engineer determines the work to be acceptable or the Work is
 authorized in a Change Order.
 1512.3 NON-COMPLIANCE
 If the Contractor fails to comply immediately with any order issued by the Engineer in accordance with the requirements
 in this section, the Engineer may direct the following and deduct the costs from moneys due or becoming due to the Contractor
 under the Contract or any other contract with the Department:

 concrete, or grading material (including borrow and excess), before starting work. This cab card shall identify the truck or tractor
 and trailer by Minnesota or prorated license number and shall contain the tare, maximum allowable legal gross mass, supporting
 information, and the signature of the owner. The Contractor shall make the card available to the Engineer upon request. The
 Contract Unit Prices include Contractor-related costs in providing, verifying, and spot checking the cab card information, including
 weighing empty and loaded trucks on certified commercial scales.
 The Contractor shall not operate equipment mounted on crawler tracks or steel-tired wheels on or across concrete or
 bituminous surfaces.
 When construction operations require crossing an existing pavement, Bridges, or completed portions of the Pavement
 Structure with otherwise prohibited equipment or loads, the Contractor shall submit methods of load distribution or bridging in
 writing and obtain the Engineer’s written approval. This approval does not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for any damages
 to the Work.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 29
 
 1513
 The Contractor will not be relieved of liability for damages resulting from the operation and movement of construction
 equipment because of the issuance of a special permit, or by adherence to any other restrictions imposed.
 The Contractor may temporarily store or park construction Materials and Equipment on a Bridge deck during Bridge
 construction. Storage of Materials and Equipment shall be limited as follows:
 
 (1)
 (2)

 MAINTENANCE DURING CONSTRUCTION
 At the Contractor’s own expense and initiative, the Contractor must maintain Project Roadway on which it has performed
 Work when the Contract requires placing Materials on or the use of constructed Subgrade, base course, pavement, or Structure.
 This responsibility for maintenance includes not only Roadway where construction is complete, but also temporary, unfinished
 Roadway surface used by traffic where the existing pavement has been removed but the final surface has not yet been placed. The
 Contractor must maintain this work such that the surface is reasonably smooth, dust free, not rutted or potholed, and provides for
 the safe and convenient use by the travelling public. For Roadway on which the Contractor has performed Work, the Engineer will
 notify the Contractor, in writing, of maintenance deficiencies. The Contractor must correct deficiencies within 24 hours of receipt of
 written notice from the Engineer, or within 24 hours of when the Contractor independently encounters deficiencies requiring repair,
 whichever is earlier. If the Contractor fails to do so, the Department may immediately proceed to maintain the Work and deduct the
 cost of maintenance from money due or becoming due to the Contractor under the Contract or any other contract with the
 Department.
 For maintenance work on all other highways and roads, the Contractor must perform maintenance work or provide dust
 control as directed by the Engineer. The Contractor must promptly notify the Engineer if the Contractor encounters a deficiency
 that must be repaired to maintain the road such that the surface is reasonably smooth, dust free, not rutted or potholed, and
 provides for the safe and convenient use by the travelling public. The Contractor must comply with an Engineer’s directive to
 maintain the road within 24 hours after receipt of written notice. The Department will pay for the Engineer-directed work at
 Contract Unit Prices or as Extra Work in accordance with 1402, “Contract Revisions”. The Department will not pay for Contractor
 maintenance Work performed on Contractor-requested Detours and Contractor-selected haul roads.
 During periods of authorized winter suspension, the Department will perform routine maintenance on Project Roads.
 When resuming Work after winter suspension, the Contractor must remove, to the extent directed by the Engineer, any temporary
 construction or Materials that the Department used in Road maintenance during the suspension. The Department will pay for this
 work at the Contract Unit Prices or as Extra Work in accordance with 1402, “Contract Revisions”.
 If the Engineer partially accepts work under 1516.1, “Partial Acceptance,” then the Contractor is relieved of
 responsibility for maintenance of that portion of the Work that has been partially accepted, except as directed by the Engineer. The
 Department will pay for the Engineer-directed work at Contract Unit Prices or as Extra Work in accordance with 1402, “Contract
 Revisions”.
 1515
 
 CONTROL OF HAUL ROADS
 Haul Roads are those public Roads (other than trunk Highways) that the Contractor may use for the purposes specified in
 2051.2, “Maintenance and Restoration of Haul Roads, Definitions.”
 Haul Roads do not include a connection between a natural material source and a public Road. The Contractor must
 secure the Rights Of Way for, construct, and maintain such connections between a material source and a public Road, without
 compensation from the Department other than payment received for the Contract Items.
 The Department may, but is not required to, designate haul Roads in accordance with Minnesota Statutes §161.25. If the
 Department has made a written designation of a haul Road, then the Department will have jurisdiction over the public Roads and
 Streets included in such designation. The requirements of 2051, “Maintenance and Restoration of Haul Roads,” will govern the
 maintenance and restoration of such haul Roads.
 following:
 
 If the Department has not made a written designation of a haul Road, then the Contractor will be responsible for the
 (1)
 (2)
 
 30
 
 Arranging for the use of Roads not under the jurisdiction of the Department,
 Performing any maintenance and restoration as required by the applicable Road authority as a condition of use
 of such Road as a haul Road, and
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 1517.1
 (3)
 
 Paying any fees, charges, or damages assessed by the applicable Road authority as a condition of using such
 Road as a haul Road.
 
 All actions and costs with respect to non-designated haul Roads will be without compensation from the Department, other
 than payment received for the Contract Items.
 In preparing its Proposal, the Contractor is not entitled to assume that the Department will designate a haul Road, or that
 the haul Road designated will be the most convenient and direct route or not subject to reduced weight limits. The Department
 will not consider its decision to designate or not designate a requested haul route as a basis for a contract revision.
 
 1516
 
 ACCEPTANCE
 
 1516.1 PARTIAL ACCEPTANCE
 After completing a substantial and discrete portion of Work, the Contractor may request the Engineer to inspect that
 portion. If the Engineer determines that the portion of the Work is complete in accordance with the Contract requirements, the
 Engineer may accept the completed portion in writing. Partial acceptance relieves the Contractor of further responsibility for
 maintenance of that portion of Work, but does not invalidate or alter the terms of the Contract.
 1516.2 PROJECT ACCEPTANCE
 After completing the Work, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer and request a final inspection. If the Engineer
 determines that the Project is complete, the inspection will constitute the final inspection and the Engineer will promptly provide
 written notice of Project acceptance effective on the date of the final inspection. The notice of Project acceptance relieves the
 Contractor of further responsibility for the Work.
 If the Engineer finds unacceptable or incomplete Work, the Contractor shall immediately correct the deficiencies as
 directed by the Engineer. After correcting the deficiencies, the Contractor shall again request a final inspection.
 Acceptance of the Project does not relieve the Contractor of financial liabilities imposed on the Contractor by statute and
 does not constitute final acceptance of the Contract.
 1516.3 COMPLETION OF THE WORK
 The Department will consider the Work in all things completed when the Contractor has completed and submitted
 required documents, certifications, and affidavits including, but not limited to, the following:
 (1)

 the entire schedule; the Department will return the accepted schedule to the Contractor as “Accepted-As-Noted” or “No Exceptions
 Taken.”
 The Engineer’s acceptance of any schedule shall not transfer any of the Contractor’s responsibilities to the Department.
 The Contractor alone shall remain responsible for adjusting forces, equipment, and Work schedules to ensure completion of the
 Work within the time(s) specified in the Contract.
 A.2
 Early Completion
 Early Completion is defined as an initial schedule, baseline schedule or update schedule which anticipates completion of
 all work prior to the Completion Date established by the contract documents and the Contractor submits as an Early Completion
 Schedule. In the event that an Early Completion Schedule is accepted, the Engineer will initiate a Supplemental Agreement
 amending the Completion Date to the finish date shown on the accepted Early Completion Schedule. The amended Completion Date
 will be effective upon execution of that Supplemental Agreement and all contract provisions concerning the Completion Date such
 as incentives, disincentives, excusable delays, compensable delays, and liquidated damages will be measured against the amended
 Completion Date. The Contractor may elect not to execute the Supplemental Agreement amending the Completion Date; however,
 in so doing, the Contractor waives its rights to delay damages in meeting the projected early Completion Date.
 A.3
 Non-Compliance
 It is the Contractor’s responsibility to ensure that the Schedule submitted meets the requirements of 1803.2, “Bar Chart
 Schedules” or 1803.3, “Critical Path Method (CPM) Schedules” and accurately reflects the work progress. The Engineer may
 suspend work under 1803.6A if the schedule does not accurately reflect the actual progress of the work; the suspension may
 continue until accurate schedules are submitted.
 The Department will withhold each monthly progress estimate for failure to submit an original or updated schedule on
 time and in the manner required. Payment withheld for violation of the schedule requirements will be included in the next progress
 estimate following the Contractor’s submission of the required schedules. The Project Engineer’s approval does not attest to the
 validity of the schedule.
 A.4
 Should the Contractor fail to maintain satisfactory progress, in accordance with 1803, “Progress Schedules,” the
 Engineer will require that the Contractor provide additional resources (labor, materials, equipment, etc.) as necessary to bring the
 Work up to the level of progress reflected in the current accepted progress schedule. The Department will consider any failure by
 the Contractor to adhere to the accepted progress schedule as a failure to provide sufficient resources to ensure completion of the
 Work within the Contract Time. The Department may issue a notice of default to the Contractor in accordance with 1808, “Default
 of Contractor,” if the Contractor fails to do either of the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 
 Adhere to the current accepted progress schedule, or
 Take action as ordered to remedy unsatisfactory progress.

 to evaluate time extensions and associated costs requested by the Contractor.
 C
 Weather and Duration Contingency
 The Contractor shall allow for normal weather delays when developing the Progress Schedule. The Department will
 extend the Contract Time, except as limited by 1806.4, “Extension of Contract Time Due to Weather on calendar Day and
 Completion Date Contracts,” for delays in excess of the anticipated work days lost to inclement weather as specified in Table
 1803-2; the days in Table 1803-2 are cumulative and prorated when Contract Time starts or ends mid-month. For example, if
 Contract Time starts May 15 and there are days lost to weather in May or June, then the Contract must lose 7 days to weather (2
 days from May and 5 days from June) in addition to the anticipated days in July before a time extension would be considered due
 to weather days lost in July.

 Excessively long durations.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 53
 
 1803.3
 
 The Contractor shall obtain the Engineer’s approval before using lags or leads. The Contractor shall remove any lags or
 leads and replace with an activity identifying the lag or lead upon the request of the Engineer, regardless of whether the
 Department allowed the lag or lead in a previous Progress Schedule.
 The Contractor shall not be entitled to compensation or a time extension for delays that could have been avoided
 by revising activity durations or logic used to sequester float.
 A.5
 Use of Float
 The Contractor acknowledges that all float (including Total Float, Free Float, and Sequestered Float) is a shared
 commodity available to the Project and is not for the exclusive benefit of any party; float is an expiring resource available to
 accommodate changes in the Work, however originated, or to mitigate the effect of events that may delay performance or
 completion of all or part of the Work.
 It is understood that identified contingencies, as described in 1803.3.D, “Weather and Duration Contingency.” become
 available Float as time elapses and the contingency is not used.

 B.5
 Revised Schedule
 The Contractor shall not perform Work substantially different than depicted on the approved Progress Schedule in
 accordance with 1803.4, “Prosecution Control” and shall seek an Accepted Revised Schedule to become the new Progress Schedule.
 The Contractor shall submit a Revised Schedule upon one of the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 
 (3)
 
 The Contractor desires to substantially deviate from the current Progress Schedule sequence or durations
 of planned Work. An example would include but not limited to an altered Critical Path.
 Department’s Request.
 (2.1)
 Where the Department requires the Contractor to demonstrate how to recover any scheduled
 Milestone date(s) that differ from any dates established by the Contract or the Contract Time.
 (2.2)
 The Department concludes that there is a substantial difference between the actual sequence or
 actual duration of the Work, and the Work as depicted in the Progress Schedule.
 The issuance of a Contract Revision document that changes the planned sequence of Work or the
 method and manner of its performance.
 
 The requirement to prepare a Revised Schedule is not a directive by the Department to accelerate the Work but rather a
 directive for the Contractor to seek the Department’s Acceptance of a proposal to revise the accepted Progress Schedule, which
 may or may not include acceleration. The requirements of the Revised Schedule are otherwise the same as the Baseline Schedule.
 The requirements of the Revised Schedule are otherwise the same as the Baseline Schedule.
 B.6
 Impact Schedule
 The Contractor shall prepare an Impact Schedule:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 To quantify the effects of any contemporaneous or prospective impacts to the
 Progress Schedule
 To establish the need for a time extension to a Milestone
 At the Department’s request. An example of a reason, is the negotiation of a potential Contract Revision
 document that changes the planned sequence of Work or the method and manner of its performance
 
 The standard for preparation of the Impact Schedule is specified in 1806, “Determination and Extension of Contract
 Time,” concerning the analysis of delays using a prospective time impact analysis. The requirement to prepare an Impact Schedule
 is not a directive by the Department to accelerate the Work but rather a directive for the Contractor to provide a proposal to
 demonstrate the effects of impacts to the accepted Progress Schedule. The requirements of the Revised Schedule are otherwise
 the same as the Baseline Schedule.
 C
 Schedule Submission Requirements
 The Contractor shall include the following with the CPM schedule in its schedule submission:

 D. Weather and Duration Contingency
 It is the responsibility of the Contractor to estimate a sufficient amount of contingency to account for normal weather.
 The duration of each activity shall only include the necessary working days to actually complete the work defined by the activity;
 weather or any other contingency shall not be built into the durations but shall be accounted for within the project calendars.
 Each activity shall be assigned an appropriate calendar. The Project calendars shall indicate planned working and
 nonworking days. Each calendar, with the exception of the calendar used for tracking calendar days, shall include contingent
 nonworking days. The Contractor shall indicate contingent nonworking days on Monday through Friday only. The Engineer
 reserves the right to accept or reject the estimated amount of contingency in accordance with “Acceptance of Schedule” section
 contained herein.
 The Schedule shall use a minimum of the following calendars:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 Calendar to indicate calendar days (cure time, etc.),
 Calendar for work that can progress year round, and
 Calendar for each major item of Work affected by weather or seasonal limitations. The Contractor shall
 include a minimum of 15 percent weather contingency.
 
 Contingency will be the numbers of indicated nonworking days compared to a description of the duration (in hours) of
 the normal working day, as indicated in the narrative, of the work week, e.g., M-F (10 hrs) and Sat (6 hrs) for every calendar.
 1803.4 TEMPORARY SUSPENSIONS
 A
 Suspension of Work Ordered by the Engineer
 The Engineer will issue all suspension-of-work orders in writing specifying the effective start date and end date of the
 suspension, the operations to be suspended, and the reasons for the suspension. The Contractor may not resume work until so
 authorized in writing by the Engineer and shall resume work within a reasonable time upon the Engineer’s direction. The Engineer
 will order the resumption of Work upon determining that the conditions that caused the suspension no longer exist.
 If the Engineer issues a temporary suspension-of-work order because of any action or inaction by the Department, or
 because of incomplete Work under other contracts, and if the Contractor has not been advised in the Contract that such a
 suspension may be necessary, the Contractor shall refer to 1402.4, “Suspensions of Work Ordered by the Engineer,” regarding
 compensation and extension of Contract Time.
 If the Engineer issues a temporary suspension-of-work order due to the Contractor’s fault or negligence, such suspension
 is a non-excusable delay as specified in 1806.2.C, “Non-Excusable Delays,” and is non-compensable.
 B
 Suspension of Work Requested by the Contractor
 The Contractor shall send a written request for the temporary suspension of work to the Engineer. The Contractor’s
 request shall include the proposed effective start and end dates, the operations to be suspended, and the reasons for requesting
 
 58
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 1805
 the suspension. The Contractor shall not suspend all or any part of the Work without the Engineer's written authorization.
 Suspension of the Work for any cause whatsoever shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for maintenance of traffic,
 except as otherwise provided in 1404, “Maintenance of Traffic,” or by written agreement between the Contractor and the
 Department.
 The Engineer will not authorize the Contractor to temporarily suspend operations until the following conditions are met:
 (1)
 
 (2)
 (3)
 
 The roads that are being used by traffic and any temporary approaches or crossings and intersections with
 trails, roads, streets, businesses, parking lots, residences, garages, and farms are in such condition that only
 routine maintenance will be required to adequately accommodate through and local traffic during the
 anticipated period of suspension.
 The Contractor has performed such work as is necessary to protect all completed or partially completed
 work during the anticipated suspension period.
 The Contractor has placed all traffic control devices as specified in 1710, “Traffic Control Devices.”
 
 Should the Contractor fail to perform any of this Work before suspension, the Department reserves the right to have the
 Work performed by others and to deduct the associated costs from any moneys due or becoming due the Contractor.
 1804
 
 PROSECUTION OF WORK
 
 1804.1 PROSECUTION CONTROL
 The Contractor shall commence and prosecute the work with forces and equipment adequate to complete the Controlling
 Activity(s) of the Progress Schedule within the planned duration. The Contractor shall prosecute the work continuously and
 diligently from as many different points and in such parts and sequences as will ensure progress in accordance with the Progress
 Schedule.
 The Contractor shall prosecute the Work substantially in the same sequence as the Progress Schedule. The Department
 will provide written notice to the Contractor when the Department deems Work is being performed substantially out of sequence;
 any Work the Contractor continues to perform out of sequence will be considered unauthorized work in accordance with 1512,
 “Unacceptable and Unauthorized Work”.
 The Contractor shall mitigate the effects of any delay to the extent practicable, and demonstrate recovery through
 submission of a Revised Schedule, in accordance with 1803.2.B.5, “Revised Schedule,” or 1803.3.B.5, “Revised Schedule,” as
 appropriate.
 1804.2 LIMITATION OF OPERATIONS
 The Contractor shall conduct the Work in a manner and sequence that will ensure the least interference with traffic, with
 due regard given to the location of detours and to the provisions for handling traffic. The Contractor shall not open up Work to the
 prejudice or detriment of Work already started. The Engineer may require the Contractor to finish a section on which Work is in
 progress before starting Work on any additional sections if the opening of that section to traffic is essential for public convenience.
 The Contractor shall not perform Work during the hours of darkness without the prior approval of the Engineer. When the
 Engineer authorizes night work the Contractor shall furnish sufficient artificial lighting to permit proper and safe inspection, as well as
 to ensure quality workmanship equal to that achievable during daylight hours.
 The Contractor shall not perform Work on Sundays or legal holidays unless specifically allowed for in the Contract. The
 Contractor shall suspend construction operations for a period of 24 hours from approximately 6:00 a.m. on each Sunday or legal
 holiday until 6:00 a.m. on the following day. The Engineer may allow slight changes in these hours, but the Contractor shall comply
 with the intent of this policy. The Contractor does not have to obtain the Engineer’s permission to perform minor operations on
 Sundays and legal holidays that may be necessary to protect the work or to maintain and protect traffic.
 1805
 
 METHODS AND EQUIPMENT
 The Contractor shall use methods and Equipment capable of performing the Work specified in the Contract. The
 Contractor shall ensure the Equipment does not damage the Roadway, adjacent property, or other Highways.
 When methods and Equipment are specified in the Contract, the Contractor shall request permission from the Engineer, in
 writing, to use alternate methods and Equipment. The Contractor shall describe the proposed methods and Equipment and the
 reasons for the change. The Contractor shall perform the Work in accordance with the original basis of payment and Contract
 Time.
 When methods and Equipment are not specified in the Contract, the Contractor may use any methods and Equipment
 that complete the Work in accordance with the Contract requirements.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 59
 
 1805
 The Contractor shall discontinue performing the Work using alternate methods or Equipment, if the Work does not meet
 the Contract requirements. The Contractor shall remove and replace or repair unacceptable work at no additional cost to the
 Department.
 1806
 
 DETERMINATION AND EXTENSION OF CONTRACT TIME
 
 1806.1 GENERAL
 The Proposal Package will specify the Contract Time. The Contractor shall prosecute the Work continuously and
 effectively, with the least possible delay, to the end that all Work is completed within the Contract Time.
 If the Department issues a Notice to Proceed, the Contract Start Date established in the Notice to Proceed takes
 precedence over the Contract Start Date specified in the Proposal Package.
 The Department will not consider a plea by the Contractor that the Contract Time was not sufficient as a valid reason for
 an extension of the Contract Time.
 If the Department grants an extension of the Contract Time, the extended time for completion will be in full force and
 effect as though it was originally specified.
 The Department will only extend the Contract Time if an excusable delay, as specified in 1806.2.A, “Excusable, NonCompensable Delays,” or 1806.2.B, “Excusable, Compensable Delays,” delays Work on the Critical Path as described in items 1, 2,
 3, and 4, below.
 Mitigation of delay, whether caused by the Department, Contractor, a third-party, or an event, is a shared contract and
 legal requirement. Mitigation efforts include, but are not limited to, re-sequencing work activities, acceleration, and continuation of
 work through an otherwise planned shutdown period. The Contractor and Engineer will explore and discuss potential mitigation
 efforts promptly and agree upon costs or cost-sharing responsibilities prior to the implementation of mitigation efforts.
 The Department will not evaluate a request for extension of the Contract Time unless the Contractor notifies the Engineer
 as specified in 1403, “Notification for Contract Revisions,” and provides the required analysis as follows.
 The Contractor shall evaluate delays and calculate the appropriate time extension due based on the following:
 (1)
 
 (2)
 (3)
 
 (4)
 
 (5)
 
 The Contractor shall base all evaluations of delay and all calculations of the appropriate time extensions due on
 the schedules submitted to and accepted by the Department. The Contractor shall not use schedules that did
 not exist on the project or create schedules after the delay has occurred to demonstrate entitlement to a time
 extension.
 The Contractor shall base evaluations and calculations related to the determination of extensions of time on the
 Critical Path as established by the schedules submitted to and accepted by the Department. The Contractor is
 not entitled to a time extension for delays that do not delay the Critical Path.
 The evaluations and calculations required to establish entitlement to a time extension will vary depending on
 the nature and timing of the delay and whether the Contract Time is measured in working days, calendar days,
 or based on a fixed completion date. It will also vary depending on whether the Contract requires a bar chart
 or CPM schedule.
 The schedules relevant to the evaluation and calculation of time extensions are the most current schedules
 submitted to and accepted by the Department. For example, if the Department determines that Extra Work is
 required and the Supplemental Agreement adding this work will be dated June 2, then the determination of the
 time extension due the Contractor will be based on the last schedule submitted and accepted by the
 Department prior to June 2 of the same year.
 The Contractor’s evaluations and calculations shall comply with the following Recommended Practices published
 by the Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering, International:
 (5.1)
 Recommended Practice No. 52R-06, Time Impact Analysis As Applied in Construction. The
 Contractor shall use this Recommended Practice for delays that are in the future (prospective). The
 Contractor shall not use this recommended practice to evaluate delays that have already occurred
 (retrospective).
 (5.2)
 Recommended Practice No. 29R-03, Forensic Schedule Analysis, MIP 3.4 Observational/
 Dynamic/Contemporaneous Split approach. The Contractor shall use MIP 3.4 when evaluating delays
 that have already occurred.
 
 The Engineer will review the Contractor’s evaluations and calculations and determine the time extension due, if any. The
 Engineer will measure extensions to the Contract Time in working days for Working Day Contracts and in calendar days for
 Completion Date and Calendar Day Contracts.
 The Department will relieve the Contractor from associated liquidated damages, as specified in 1807, “Failure to Complete
 the Work on Time,” if the Department extends the Contract Time under this section (1806).

 1806.3
 1806.2 TYPES OF DELAYS
 A
 Excusable, Non-Compensable Delays
 Excusable, non-compensable delays are delays that are not the Contractor’s or the Department’s fault or responsibility,
 and that could not have been foreseen by the Contractor. The Department will not compensate the Contractor for excusable, noncompensable delays.
 Excusable, non-compensable delays include, but are not limited to:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 (5)
 (6)
 (7)
 (8)
 
 Delays due to fires, floods, tornadoes, lightning strikes, earthquakes, epidemics, or other cataclysmic
 phenomena of nature.
 Delays due to weather if the Contractor is entitled to a time extension for weather as specified in 1806.3,
 “Determination of Charges on Working Day Contracts,” and 1806.4, “Extension of Contract Time Due to
 Weather on Calendar Day and Completion Date Contracts.”
 Extraordinary delays in material deliveries the Contractor or its suppliers cannot foresee or avoid resulting from
 freight embargoes, government acts, or regional material shortages.
 Delays due to civil disturbances.
 Delays due to acts of the public enemy.
 Delays due to labor strikes that are beyond the Contractor’s, subcontractor’s, or supplier’s power to settle and
 are not caused by improper acts or omissions of the Contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.
 Delays due to acts of the government or a political subdivision other than the Department.
 All other delays not the Contractor’s or Department’s fault or responsibility and which could not have been
 foreseen by the Contractor.
 
 B
 Excusable, Compensable Delays
 Excusable, compensable delays are delays that are not the Contractor’s fault or responsibility, and are the Department’s
 fault or responsibility, or are determined by judicial proceeding to be the Department’s sole responsibility.
 Excusable, compensable, delays include, but are not limited to:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 Delays due to revised Work as specified in 1402.2, “Differing Site Conditions,” 1402.3, “Significant Changes to
 the Character of Work,” and 1402.5, “Extra Work.”
 Delays due to utility or railroad interference on the Project Site that are not anticipated as a concurrent move or
 activity by the Contract.
 Delays due to an Engineer-ordered suspension as specified in 1402.4, “Suspensions of Work Ordered by the
 Engineer.”
 Delays due to the neglect of the Department or its failure to act in a timely manner.
 
 C
 Non-Excusable Delays
 Non-excusable delays are delays that are the Contractor’s fault or responsibility. All non-excusable delays are noncompensable.
 Non-excusable delays include, but are not limited to:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 (5)
 
 Delays due to the Contractor’s, subcontractor’s, or supplier’s insolvency or mismanagement.
 Delays due to slow delivery of materials from the supplier or fabricator when the material was available in
 warehouse stock, or when delivery was delayed for reasons of priority, late ordering, financial considerations,
 or other causes.
 Delays due to the Contractor's failure to provide sufficient forces and equipment to maintain satisfactory
 progress in completing the Controlling Activities.
 Delays caused by plant and equipment failure or delays due to the Contractor's failure to provide and maintain
 the equipment in good mechanical condition or to provide for immediate emergency repairs.
 Delays caused by conditions on the project, including traffic conditions that could be foreseen or anticipated
 before the date of bid opening. Weather delays are addressed in 1806.3, “Determination of Charges on
 Working Day Contracts,” and 1806.4, “Extension of Contract Time Due to Weather on Calendar Day and
 Completion Date Contracts.”
 
 D
 Concurrent Delays
 Concurrent delays are independent sources of delay that occur at the same time.. When a non-excusable delay is
 concurrent with an excusable delay, the Contractor is not entitled to an extension of Contract Time for the period the non-excusable
 delay is concurrent with the excusable delay. When a non-compensable delay is concurrent with a compensable delay, the
 Contractor is entitled to an extension of Contract Time, but not entitled to compensation for the period the non-compensable delay
 is concurrent with the compensable delay.
 1806.3 DETERMINATION OF CHARGES ON WORKING DAY CONTRACTS
 The Department will determine working day charges as follows:
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 61
 
 1806.3
 
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 One whole day for each day of work that the Contractor makes progress or could have made progress during a
 working day on one or more Critical Activities for at least 6 continuous hours.
 One whole day when the Engineer orders a work suspension for reasons of Contractor’s fault or negligence.
 One whole day for Non-Excusable Delays as specified in 1806.2.C, “Non-Excusable Delays.”
 One half (1/2) day for each day of work that the Contractor makes progress or could have made progress
 during a working day on one or more Critical Activities for at least 2 continuous hours.
 
 The Department will not charge a working day:
 (1)
 
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 When the Contractor could not effectively prosecute Critical Activities for at least 2 continuous hours during a
 working day due to:
 (1.1)
 Excusable, Non-Compensable Delays as specified in 1806.2.A, “Excusable, Non-Compensable Delays.”
 (1.2)
 Excusable, Compensable Delays as specified in 1806.2.B, “Excusable, Compensable Delays.”
 (1.3)
 Concurrent Delays as specified in 1806.2.D, “Concurrent Delays.”
 On Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.
 During the inclusive period from November 15 through April 15, except as specified in 1806.1, “Determination
 and Extension of Contract Time, General.”
 During Suspensions of Work Ordered by the Engineer as specified in 1402.4, “Suspensions of Work Ordered by
 the Engineer,” except for work suspensions ordered by the Engineer for reasons of Contractor’s fault or
 negligence.
 
 The Department will add or subtract working days via Supplemental Agreement to the Contract. The number of working
 days to be added or subtracted will be determined as specified in 1806.1, “Determination and Extension of Contract Time, General”:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 For Differing Site Conditions as specified in 1402.2, “Differing Site Conditions.”
 For Significant Changes in the Character of the Work as specified in 1402.3, “Significant Changes to the
 Character of Work.”
 For Extra Work as specified in 1402.5, “Extra Work.”
 
 The Engineer will furnish the Contractor a weekly statement showing the working days charged to the project, except
 during periods when the Engineer determines that working day charges will not be made. The statement will include an
 accounting of all delays affecting the Critical Path. The Engineer will classify each of these delays as excusable non-compensable,
 or excusable compensable, or non-excusable, in accordance with 1806.2, “Types of Delays,” or weather-related in accordance with
 1806.3, “Determination of Charges on Working Day Contracts,” and 1806.4, “Extension of Contract Time Due to Weather on
 Calendar Day and Completion Date Contracts.”
 The Engineer will commence assessing working day charges on the Contract Starting Date and cease when the Contractor
 has completed all Work, including maintenance and final cleanup operations. However, assessments will be made for work
 conducted before the Contract Starting Date when the operations in progress result in traffic restriction. In that case, the work
 causing the traffic restriction will be considered Critical Path Work and working days will be assessed.
 Objections by the Contractor as to an improper or excessive assessment of working day charges shall be in the form of a
 written protest to the Engineer, within 10 calendar days of receipt of statement, setting forth the specific dates and justifications for
 reduced charges. If the Engineer finds the Contractor’s protest to be valid or if the Department detects an error, the Engineer will
 issue corrected weekly statements. Once accepted by the Contractor, whether explicitly or as a result of the Contractor’s failure to
 file a timely protest, the weekly statement is final and the Contractor waives entitlement to an extension of Contract Time or
 compensation for any delays not explicitly identified by the weekly statement. In case of disagreement, the Contractor may request
 an administrative review of contested charges by the Department’s Construction Engineer.
 1806.4 EXTENSION OF CONTRACT TIME DUE TO WEATHER ON CALENDAR DAY AND COMPLETION DATE
 CONTRACTS
 The Department will not consider weekends, holidays, or any days between November 15 and April 15, inclusive, as
 eligible for extensions of Contract Time due to weather unless the Engineer directs the Contractor to work those days, or the
 Contractor’s accepted progress schedule in place at the time the delay occurred indicated that the Contractor intended to perform
 Critical Path Work on those days.
 1807
 
 FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE WORK ON TIME
 
 The Department is entitled to damages for failure of the Contractor to complete the Work within the Contract Time. In
 view of the difficulty in making a precise determination of actual damages incurred, the Department will assess a daily charge not
 as a penalty but as liquidated damages to compensate the Department for the additional costs incurred.
 In suits involving assessment or recovery of liquidated damages, the reasonableness of daily charges will be presumed
 and the amount assessed will be in addition to every other remedy enforceable at law, in equity, by statute, or under the Contract.
 
 62
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 1808
 1807.1 ASSESSMENT OF LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
 The Department will deduct liquidated damages from money due the Contractor for each calendar day that the Work
 remains incomplete after the Contract Time expires. The Engineer will deduct liquidated damages based on the original Contract
 Amount and Table 1807-1.

 1807.2 WAIVER OF LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
 The Department may waive all or any portion of liquidated damages after the date the Work is substantially completed if
 the Engineer determines that the Work is in a condition that no longer requires ongoing inspection by the Department.
 The Department will not deduct liquidated damages during periods of authorized suspension.
 The Department does not waive any of its rights under the Contract by allowing the Contractor to continue and finish the
 Work or any part of the Work after the Contract Time expires. The Department does not waive its rights to recover liquidated
 damages from the Contractor or its Surety by either:
 (1)
 (2)
 
 Taking over the Work, or
 Terminating the Contract.
 
 1808
 
 DEFAULT OF CONTRACTOR
 The Commissioner, after giving due notice to the Contractor and its Sureties, will have full power and authority to take
 the prosecution of the Work out of the hands of the Contractor without violating the terms of the Contract if the Contractor commits
 any of the following events of default:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 (5)
 (6)
 (7)

 Fails to comply with the Labor Provisions required by the Contract, or
 Fails to carry on the Work in an acceptable manner for any other cause whatsoever.
 Repeatedly fails to make payment in accordance with the Contract to subcontractors or suppliers for labor or
 materials.
 
 The Engineer will give the Contractor and Sureties written notice of any default, and will identify the facts of the events of
 default together with a demand that the Contractor correct such events of default to the satisfaction of the Engineer. If within a
 period of 10 business days after such notice the Contractor and Sureties fail to correct the identified events of default, the
 Commissioner will exercise any lawful authority and take any lawful action with respect to such default and with respect to securing
 performance of the Work.
 The Contractor and Department acknowledge the following:
 (1)
 
 A notice of default is duly served when it is delivered in person or by registered mail to the Contractor and
 Sureties or to their authorized representatives, including persons in charge of their offices; and
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 63
 
 1808
 (2)
 
 The service of the notice is complete and sufficient when a properly addressed and stamped envelope
 containing the notice is registered and deposited in any post office or U.S. letter box in the State.
 
 The Commissioner's authority to take the prosecution of the Work out of the hands of the Contractor shall include the
 right to appropriate or use any or all Materials and equipment on the ground as may be suitable and acceptable, and to enter into
 an agreement with others for completion of the Work according to the terms and provisions of the Contract, or to use such other
 methods as may be required to complete the Work in an acceptable manner.
 The Department will deduct all costs and charges incurred by the Department, together with the cost of completing the
 Work under Contract, from any moneys due the Contractor or that would have become due the Contractor under the Contract if the
 Contractor had completed the Work. If the cost and charges incurred by the Department exceed the amount that would have been
 payable under the Contract, the Contractor and the Sureties shall be liable for the excess.
 If a default of the Contractor is later determined to be without cause, the default of the Contractor will revert to a
 termination of the Contract in the best public interest as allowed in 1809, “Termination of Contract.”
 1809
 
 TERMINATION OF CONTRACT
 The Department may issue a written termination of the Contract or any portion thereof for any of the following reasons
 beyond the Contractor’s control:
 (1)
 
 (2)
 
 If the Department determines that the Contractor is prevented from proceeding with or completing the Work
 within a reasonable period of time because of, but not limited to, the following:
 (1.1)
 Labor or material shortage;
 (1.2)
 Limitations imposed by law, rule, regulation, or order of the local, State, or Federal government; or
 (1.3)
 Actions of the public enemy, including those related to priorities and third-party actions.
 If the Department determines it is in the best public, State, Department, or national interest, because of, but
 not limited to, the following:
 (2.1)
 Lack of funding or a funding reallocation that prevents the completion of the Work as planned,
 (2.2)
 Discovery of significant hazardous material problems,
 (2.3)
 Right Of Way acquisition problems, or
 (2.4)
 Utility conflicts that would cause substantial delays or expense to the Contract.
 
 If the Department issues a termination of the Contract or portion thereof, the Department relieves the Contractor of its
 obligation to perform such portions of the Contract. The Department does not relieve the Contractor of its responsibilities for the
 Work completed before the termination, or the Contractor’s Surety of its responsibilities for any just claims arising out of the
 performance of the Work before the termination.
 The Department may direct the Contractor to complete certain elements of the Work before termination of the Contract.
 The Department will compensate the Contractor for completed and partially completed quantities of eliminated Contract Items in
 accordance with 1904, “Compensation for Contract Revisions,” and 1905, “Compensation for Eliminated Items.”
 
 Measurement and Payment
 1901
 
 MEASUREMENT OF QUANTITIES
 Unless otherwise specified, the Engineer will measure in accordance with this section.
 The Engineer will determine quantities of acceptable Work using one of the following methods:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 Plan dimensions — for Contract Items or portions of Contract Items designated as “P” in the Statement of
 Estimated Quantities on the Plans, the Department will use the Plan quantities for payment;
 Field measurement — for Contract Items with no “P” designation shown on the Plans, the Engineer will field
 measure quantities of Work performed; or
 A combination of Plan dimensions and field measurements.
 
 The Engineer may adjust quantities for portions of the Work or the entire Project. The Engineer will not adjust quantities
 if a difference results from use of commonly accepted dimensional approximations.
 The Engineer will determine quantities using the US customary system of weights and measures. The units and the
 methods of measurement in the Contract for each class of work will supplement or modify the provisions in this section by the
 following:
 
 64
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 1901.5
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 Imposing measurement limitations;
 Describing measurements or computation procedures;
 Establishing conversion factors or adjustment conditions; and
 Providing for the determination of accurate and representative pay quantities.
 
 Item names for pay quantities may include designated terms to indicate the basis for unit measurements, such as where
 or when the Engineer will take the unit measurements or make computations. Unless otherwise required by the Contract, the
 Engineer will make measurements and computations as specified in this section.
 The Contractor may dispute the Engineer's determination of pay quantities by submitting a written request to the
 Engineer. The Contractor shall state the Contract Item and sections of the Project disputed and provide details to justify the
 Engineer's review of the pay quantity. The request must be consistent with conditions governing the Contract Item. The Engineer
 will not review quantities unless the Contractor provides evidence substantiating that the quantity is incorrect.
 1901.1 “P” QUANTITIES
 If the Department places a “P” designation on individual Contract Items or specific portions of Contract Items in the
 Statement of Estimated Quantities on the Plans, the Department will use the Plan dimensions to calculate the pay quantity for that
 Contract Item. The Department will limit use of the “P” designated quantities to Contract Items with specified dimensions and
 controlled by field checks during, or after construction.
 The purpose of the Department’s use of “P” designated quantities is to avoid the expense of measuring dimensions, if
 original Plan dimensions remain valid. The Engineer will determine the quantities of Contract Items that do not have a “P”
 designation, using the methods of measurement required by the Contract, unless otherwise agreed in writing. The Engineer will
 use Plan dimensions as applicable for completed Work. The Engineer will only use field dimensions if required by the Contract or as
 necessary to accurately dimension completed Work.
 The Engineer will adjust a “P” designated quantity if the Engineer revises the dimensions of the Work or decides the “P”
 designated quantity is incorrect. The Engineer will only adjust quantities for the revised or corrected portions of the “P” designated
 Contract Item.
 1901.2 AREAS
 For longitudinal measurements, the Engineer will measure horizontally for computing an area and will not make
 deductions for Structures with an area less than 1 sq yd. For transverse measurements, the Engineer will use the neat line
 dimensions shown in the Plans or ordered by the Engineer.
 1901.3 STRUCTURES
 The Engineer will measure Structures using the neat line dimensions shown on the Plans, or the dimensions as altered to
 fit field conditions.
 1901.4 LENGTH
 The Engineer will measure Contract Items requiring a linear unit of measure, such as pipe culverts, guardrail, and
 underdrains, parallel to the base or foundation on which the Structure is placed.
 1901.5 VOLUME
 A
 Excavated Volume (EV) — Cubic Yard
 The Engineer will determine the cubic yards of Excavated Volume (EV) using the cross-section method or digital surface
 model method to measure the material in its original position.
 B
 Compacted Volume (CV) — Cubic Yard
 The Engineer will determine the cubic yards of Compacted Volume (CV) using the cross-section method or digital surface
 model method to measure the compacted material in its final position, in accordance with the placement dimensions required by the
 Contract or directed by the Engineer.
 C
 Loose Volume in Vehicular Measure — Cubic Yard
 The Engineer will determine the cubic yards of Loose Volume (LV) using the vehicular measure method. The Engineer
 will measure the material at the point of delivery to the nearest 0.10 cu yd. The Contractor may use vehicles for hauling material to
 the Project of any size or type if the Engineer can easily determine the vehicle body capacity and view the contents. The Engineer
 will determine the struck capacity for each vehicle. The Contractor shall mark the struck or level perimeter line on the inside of the
 box of each vehicle.
 The Contractor shall load the vehicle and level the load as directed by the Engineer. The Contractor shall provide
 over-allowance for settlement of the load during transit. The Engineer may direct the Contractor to level any load upon its arrival at
 the point of delivery. The Engineer will not measure material heaped above the struck capacity of the vehicle. The Engineer will
 make deductions in 0.5 cu yd increments on loads that contain less than the struck capacity. The Contractor shall provide hauling
 vehicles with a conspicuous, legible identification mark that is acceptable to the Engineer.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications

 1901.5
 
 D
 Stockpiled Volume (SV) — Cubic Yard
 The Engineer will determine the cubic yards of Stockpiled Volume (SV) using the cross section method or the digital
 surface model method to measure material in the stockpiled position. The Contractor shall shape the stockpile to a condition
 directed by the Engineer before measurement.
 1901.6 (BLANK)
 1901.7 (BLANK)
 1901.8 MASS
 For measuring or proportioning Material by mass, the Contractor shall provide certified weights or weigh Material on
 calibrated, approved scales. The Department will not allow the use of front-end loader scales. The Contractor shall give the
 Engineer a copy of the inspection certificate.
 The Contractor shall provide an automated weighing device for Materials hauled in trucks and paid for by mass.
 A
 Certified Weights
 The Contractor is not required to weigh materials in the presence of the Engineer if the Contractor delivers the Material in
 original containers marked with the certified weight.. If the Engineer suspects a loss of Material, the Engineer will require the
 Contractor to reweigh the Material.
 B
 
 (Blank)
 
 C
 Scale Testing and Calibration
 The Contractor shall ensure an authorized person tests and calibrates scales before use on the Project. The Contractor
 shall provide test weights, accessories, and assistance required for testing and calibrating the scales. The Contractor shall test and
 calibrate the scales in accordance with the frequency, criteria, tolerances, and sensitivity requirements in this section.
 C.1
 Authorized Person

 1904
 
 The Department’s payment based on the Contract Unit Prices is payment in full for the quantities of work
 performed by the Contractor and accepted by the Engineer.
 The Department will not pay for increased expenses, loss of expected reimbursement, or loss of anticipated
 profits or overhead suffered or claimed by the Contractor due to differences between the actual quantities of
 Work and the quantities in the Contract.
 The Department will not pay for loss of expected reimbursements from unbalanced allocation of costs among
 the Contract Items due to differences between the actual quantities of Work and the quantities in the Contract.
 
 COMPENSATION FOR CONTRACT REVISIONS
 
 1904.1 GENERAL
 If the Department revises the Contract as provided in 1402, “Contract Revisions,” the Department will compensate the
 Contractor for the Contract revision following the sequence specified in 1904.2 through 1904.4. Such compensation for the
 Contract revision constitutes final and full compensation for performing the revised Work, delay costs, and all other costs not
 expressly precluded by 1904.5, “Non-Allowable Charges.” The Engineer will determine the pricing method following the sequence
 specified in 1904.2 through 1904.4 before directing the Contractor to perform the Work in the Contract revision.
 If the Contract revision includes a time extension for compensable delays as provided by 1806, “Determination and
 Extension of Contract Time,” the Department will compensate the Contractor for the costs associated with the time extension in
 accordance with 1904.6, “Compensation for Delay.”
 1904.2 CONTRACT UNIT PRICES
 Before proceeding to another pricing method, the Engineer will attempt to price and pay for the Contract revision using
 Contract Unit Prices.
 1904.3 NEGOTIATED PRICES
 If the Engineer and Contractor are unable to agree on compensation in accordance with 1904.2, “Contract Unit Prices,”
 they will attempt to negotiate unit or lump sum prices using one or more of the following methods:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 Original Contract Unit Prices for similar Contract Items adjusted for increased or decreased Material costs;
 Representative historical unit prices of similar work and quantity;
 Unit prices computed by the Department; or
 Cost analysis of labor, material, equipment, and mark ups as allowed in 1904.4, “Force Account.”
 
 Negotiated mark-up for subcontractor work may not exceed that provided for in 1904.4.H, “Contractor Mark-up.).”
 
 68
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 1904.4
 Within 5 business days of the Department’s request, the Contractor shall submit a written proposal that includes pricing,
 cost justification, and a schedule for the Contract revision. The Department will respond within 5 business days after receipt of the
 Contractor’s submittal. The Department and the Contractor can mutually agree to extend these 5-business-day time limits.
 1904.4 FORCE ACCOUNT
 If the Engineer and Contractor are unable to negotiate a price for the Contract revision in accordance with 1904.3,
 “Negotiated Prices,” the Engineer may direct the Contractor to perform all or part of the revised Work on a force account basis.
 When the Engineer directs the Contractor to perform revised Work on a force account basis, the Department will pay the Contractor
 as specified in 1904.4.A through 1904.4.J.
 A
 Labor
 The Department will compensate the Contractor for labor at the actual rate of wage paid and shown on the payroll for
 every hour that the labor and foreman are actually engaged in the revised Work. The foreman must be in direct charge of the
 specific operations and must be at the Project Site in order to be included in this compensation. Unless already included in the
 wage rates paid, the Contractor will also receive the actual labor-related costs incurred by reason of subsistence and travel
 allowances, health and welfare benefits, pension fund, or other fringe benefits, provided those payments are required by collective
 bargaining agreement or other employment contract generally applicable to the classes of labor employed on the Work.
 The Department will prorate the wages of any foreman who is employed partly on the revised Work and partly on other
 Work. The Department will determine the prorated wage based on the number of workers employed on each class of Work as
 shown by the payrolls. The Department will prorate any subsistence or travel allowances paid to the foreman on the same basis as
 the prorated direct wages.
 The Department will pay the Contractor an amount equal to 62 percent of the actual taxable rate of wage as full
 compensation for overhead, profit, additional bond, property damage and liability insurance premiums, workers' compensation
 insurance premiums, unemployment insurance contributions, employer Social Security taxes, and other indirect labor force costs.
 This compensation is based on a Workers' Compensation insurance premium of $21.00 per $100.00 of payroll. If the revised Work
 involves labor in a classification with a higher premium rate, the Contractor may submit a written request in accordance with 1403,
 “Notification for Contract Revisions,” for the additional premium amount. The request shall include:
 (1)
 (2)
 
 A certified copy of the Contractor's latest Workers' Compensation Final Insurance Audit, and
 A certification from the insurance carrier, listing the Workers' Compensation classification code numbers and
 the premium rates that are being paid in the current year.
 
 B
 Materials
 The Department will pay the Contractor the actual cost of acceptable Materials delivered and used in the revised Work,
 including transportation charges paid by the Contractor (exclusive of equipment rentals), plus an additional 15 percent for field and
 home office overhead costs and profit.
 C
 Equipment
 The Department will pay the Contractor for Equipment at the rental rates established by the Commissioner’s Equipment
 Rental Schedule available on the Department’s website and effective on the date the two parties execute the force account
 agreement (Supplemental Agreement or Work Order). This compensation is for Equipment, fuel, and lubricants that the Engineer
 authorizes and the Contractor uses on the Project. The Department will not pay for small tools. The Department will pay for the
 actual time the Equipment is in operation on the revised Work, plus travel time or transportation allowances. The Department will
 not pay for any additional Equipment costs except as provided under 1904.4.D, “Miscellaneous Compensation.”
 If the Equipment is moved to and from the location of the revised Work under its own power, the Department will pay for
 the travel time at the above rental rates. If the Equipment is moved to and from the location of the revised Work by means other
 than its own power, the Department will pay for the actual operating time during periods of loading and unloading at the above
 rental rates and will pay for the actual transportation costs.
 D
 Miscellaneous Compensation
 If the Engineer directs the Contractor to perform the revised Work on the right of way of a railroad, in addition to the
 compensation for labor, Materials, and Equipment, the Department will pay the Contractor for actual costs related to satisfying the
 requirements of 1708, “Railroad-Highway Provisions.” The Department will only pay for these costs to the extent that there is no
 duplication or overlapping of charges provided under 1904.4.A, “Labor,” 1904.4.B, “Materials,” and 1904.4.C, “Equipment,” or by
 any existing contract items.
 The Department will pay the Contractor for the actual cost of miscellaneous fees incurred in performing the revised Work,
 including but not limited to dump fees, permits, and licenses. Any negotiated mark-up for miscellaneous fees may not exceed 5% of
 the miscellaneous fees.
 The Department will not pay the Contractor for other miscellaneous costs that the Contract does not provide for specifically.
 E
 Daily Records
 The Engineer and Contractor will document the labor, Materials, and Equipment used in performing the revised Work on a
 Daily Force Account Record (Form 2137). At the end of each workday, the Engineer and Contractor will compare and sign the Daily

 Work that the Contractor did not specifically purchase for the Work but were taken from the Contractor's stock,
 the Contractor shall submit an affidavit certifying that such Materials were taken from the Contractor's stock,
 that the quantity was actually used, and that the price and transportation costs represent the actual costs to
 the Contractor.
 
 G
 Specialty Contract Work
 If the Contractor uses specialty contracting firms to perform the revised Work, the Department will pay the Contractor by
 reasonable invoice at the discretion of the Engineer. “Specialty work” is unique work that cannot be performed by the Contractor,
 its subcontractors, or other contracting firms that generally perform work on highway construction projects.
 The provisions of 1904.4.A through 1904.4.F shall not apply to payments made by reasonable invoice. All firms or
 contractors paid under these provisions and working on the Project are subject to all Labor Provisions required by the Contract.
 The Contractor shall provide the Engineer with a cost estimate of the specialty Work or service and obtain the Engineer’s
 approval before performing the specialty Work or service. As a minimum, the cost estimate shall include a complete description of
 types of Equipment to be used, the number and job classifications of employees who will perform the specialty Work, and all
 Material costs.
 H
 Contractor Mark-Up
 For any force account work performed by a subcontractor (including work performed by a specialty contractor), the
 Department will pay the Contractor one additional mark-up on revised Work performed by a subcontractor to cover administration,
 general superintendence, overhead, profit, and expenses not otherwise recoverable. The additional mark-up will be a percentage of
 the total force account invoice for the subcontractor’s portion of the revised Work equal to 10 percent of the first $50,000.00 plus
 2 percent of the balance in excess of $50,000.00.
 I
 Acceleration
 The Engineer may order the Contractor to accelerate the Work to avoid delay costs or to complete the Project early. The
 Department will pay for accelerations in accordance with this section (1904).
 J
 Inefficiency
 The Department will compensate the Contractor for inefficiency or loss of productivity resulting from 1402, “Contract
 Revisions.” Use the Measured Mile analysis, or other reliable methods, comparing the productivity of work impacted by a change to
 the productivity of similar work performed under unimpacted (unchanged) conditions to quantify the inefficiency. The Department
 will pay for inefficiencies in accordance with this section (1904).
 1904.5 NON-ALLOWABLE CHARGES
 The Department will not pay the Contractor for the following, regardless of the method of payment for the revised Work:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 Loss of anticipated profits;
 Consequential damages, including loss of bonding capacity, loss of bidding opportunities, and insolvency;
 Indirect costs;
 Attorney’s fees, claims preparation expenses, or costs of litigation.
 
 Per 1402.4, “Suspensions of Work Ordered by the Engineer,” the Department will not pay the Contractor for profit on
 suspensions or delays ordered by the Engineer. The Department will remove profit from the mark-ups in 1904.4.A,
 “Labor,”1904.4.B, “Materials,” and 1904.4.H, “Contractor Mark-Up,” by reducing the mark-up percentages as follows:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 70
 
 Labor: from 62 percent to 57 percent;
 Materials: from 15 percent to 10 percent; and
 Contractor mark-up: from 10 percent for the first $50,000.00 to 5 percent for the first $50,000.00.

 Federal Acquisition Regulations, specifically 48 C.F.R. § 31. The Department will audit all extended or unabsorbed home office
 overhead claims in accordance with 1721, “Audits.” The Department will compensate the Contractor using the standard Eichleay
 formula.
 To recover home office overhead, the Contractor’s claim shall prove:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 (5)
 
 the delay was caused by the Owner suspending the entire project, in accordance with 1402.4, “Suspensions of
 the Work Ordered by the Engineer”.
 the Owner required the Contractor to standby during the suspension period;
 it was impractical for the Contractor to obtain replacement work during the suspension period;
 the suspension caused the contractor to be unable to complete the contract within the original contract
 performance period, as extended by any modifications; and
 the Contractor suffered actual damages as a result of the delay caused by the suspension.
 
 The Department will consider Subcontractors eligible for separate extended or unabsorbed home office overhead using
 the standard Eichleay formula, if the Subcontract does not contain language disallowing such claim compensation.

 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 1905
 
 it was not impractical to obtain replacement work during the suspension period;
 the inability to obtain other work was not caused by the suspension; or
 the Contractor or Subcontractor was able to reduce fixed overhead expenses during the period of delay or
 suspension.
 
 COMPENSATION FOR ELIMINATED ITEMS
 The Department will compensate the Contractor for eliminated items in accordance with the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 (4)
 
 For completed quantities of eliminated Contract Items, the Department will compensate the Contractor for the
 accepted quantities at the Contract Unit Price.
 For materials that the Contractor has ordered but not incorporated in the Work, the Department will
 compensate the Contractor in accordance with 1907, “Payment for Surplus Material.”
 For partially completed quantities of eliminated Contract Items, the Department will compensate the Contractor
 for that portion of the quantity of the work the Contractor has performed on the eliminated Contract Item on
 the basis of a percentage of the Contract Unit Price equal to the percentage of work performed toward
 completion of that quantity of the Contract Item. To calculate this percentage, the Engineer will consider the
 value of materials incorporated in the partially completed quantity of the eliminated Contract Items to be the
 invoice cost of the materials plus transportation costs. The Engineer will add a 15 percent mark-up to the sum
 of the invoice and transportation costs.
 For the cost of equipment, mobilization, and overhead that the Engineer considers directly attributable to the
 eliminated Contract Items and that the Department has not compensated the Contractor for through provisions
 (1), (2), and (3) of this list, the Department will compensate the Contractor in accordance with 1904,
 “Compensation for Contract Revisions.”
 
 The Department will not compensate the Contractor for loss of anticipated profits on completely or partially eliminated
 Work. The Department’s compensation to the Contractor for completed or partially completed quantities of Work on eliminated
 Contract Items in accordance with 1905 constitutes final and full compensation for the Work the Contractor has performed on
 eliminated or partially eliminated Contract Items.
 The Contractor shall allow the Department access, in accordance with 1721, “Audits,” to the Contractor's cost records and
 other data relating to the Contract as needed by the Department to determine compensation for eliminated Work.
 1906
 
 PARTIAL PAYMENTS
 
 1906.1 GENERAL
 At least once a month at regular intervals, the Engineer will prepare an estimate of the value of the Work completed to
 date. Each estimate will show the documented quantity of Work completed or substantially completed under each Contract Item.
 The Department will make partial payments once per month based on the amount of Work performed, unless the
 Engineer authorizes semi-monthly partial payments.
 The Department reserves the right to withhold partial payments under this Contract if the Contractor fails to provide
 documents as required by any other contract with the Department that prevent the Department from making the Final Estimate or
 executing the Certificate of Final Acceptance for the other contract.
 The Department reserves the right to deduct, from any payment due to the Contractor, such amount to protect the
 Department’s interests in consideration of charges or assessments against the Contractor, whether arising from this Contract or any
 other contract with the Department. The Department may withhold payment of such amount until the Contractor pays or satisfies
 the charges or assessments.
 The Department’s payment of partial estimates does not relieve the Contractor from the sole responsibility for all
 Materials and Work for which payments have been made or for the restoration of any damaged Work. The payments are not a
 waiver by the Department of any provision of the Contract or of the Department’s rights to require the Contractor to fulfill all terms
 of the Contract.
 
 72
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 1907
 
 The Contractor’s acceptance of partial payment constitutes a certification by the Contractor that the Work covered by the
 partial payment meets the Contract requirements.
 1906.2 MATERIAL ON HAND
 The Contractor may request partial payments for the value of “materials on hand,” defined as acceptable Materials
 produced for or provided to the Project, but not yet incorporated into the Work.

 MAINTENANCE AND RESTORATION OF HAUL ROADS
 
 2051.1 DESCRIPTION
 This work consists of the maintenance, repair, and restoration of designated haul roads for materials hauled for the work
 covered by the contract.
 2051.2 DEFINITIONS
 The Department defines “designated haul road” as any public road or street officially designated as a haul road, except
 for a Minnesota trunk highway or road officially designated by the Commissioner as a detour around a construction project, over
 which the following materials are hauled:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 (5)
 (6)
 
 Soil or other material for embankment construction,
 Sand, gravel, or other material for backfill,
 Sand, gravel, or crushed rock for base or surfacing courses,
 Aggregates for bituminous surfacing, including hauling bituminous mixtures from the mixing plant,
 Aggregates for concrete base or pavement, including hauling concrete batches from batch plants, and
 Bituminous materials and portland cement for paving mixtures.
 
 The Contractor may haul materials to the project or to other locations outside the project if required to complete the work
 specified in the contract.
 2051.3 DESIGNATION AND USE OF HAUL ROADS
 If the contract specifies Maintenance and Restoration of Haul Roads as a contract item, do not haul material from any
 source until the Commissioner designates the haul road from that source as a haul road. Once the Commissioner designates the
 haul road from a source, haul all materials from that source over that road.
 Make all vehicle trips, both loaded or unloaded, between material sources and the project on designated haul roads.
 If the contract is with MnDOT for State Trunk Highway Projects, select haul roads and notify the Engineer of the
 selections. Within 15 calendar days after receipt of notification of the haul road selections, the Commissioner will determine the
 acceptability of the selected haul roads. If the haul roads are acceptable, the Commissioner will designate the roads as temporary
 trunk highway haul roads.
 If the contract is with or for a governmental agency other than MnDOT, select a haul road and notify the Engineer
 representing that governmental agency of the selection. Within 15 calendar days after receipt of notification of the haul road
 selection, the Engineer will determine if the selected road is an acceptable road. If the road is acceptable, the Engineer will
 approve that road as a designated haul road.
 After a haul road is officially designated, the Contractor may select a different road for official designation using the same
 procedure specified in this section. If the haul road designation changes and any of the above described materials were hauled
 over the previously designated haul road, the Contractor shall restore the previously designated haul road to the original condition.
 A
 Bituminous Roadways
 Reimburse local government agencies for haul road use on bituminous roadways in accordance with the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 Verify spring load capacities of proposed haul roads with the local government agencies,
 For a designated haul road with a bituminous surface and a spring load capacity less than 9 tons, reimburse the
 local government agency for haul road use at a rate of $0.01 per ton per mile of material hauled,
 Make full payment to the local government agency upon receiving notice of payment due and computations
 from the Engineer, and
 Provide the Engineer with confirmation of payment to the local agency.
 
 The Department will not require payment if the amount due to an individual local government agency is less than
 $500.00.
 The Department will not require the Contractor to reimburse local government agencies for concrete surfaced roadways.
 2051.4 MAINTENANCE AND RESTORATION
 While hauling operations are in progress, maintain the haul road as approved by the Engineer. This work includes
 application of water, bituminous material, or calcium chloride to the road surface as necessary to alleviate dust nuisance and
 eliminate traffic hazards.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 79
 
 2051.4
 
 After the completion of hauling operations over a haul road, perform one of the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 
 Restore that haul road to a condition at least equal to the condition existing at the start of the hauling
 operations, or
 Compensate the local government agency in the amount approved by the local government agency and the
 Engineer for the restoration of that haul road by the local government agency.
 
 The fact that other traffic used the haul road concurrently with the Contractor’s material hauling operation does not
 relieve the Contractor of the obligation to maintain and restore the haul road as required in this section. If other contractors,
 performing highway construction under a contract with the same governmental agency, haul materials over the same road
 concurrently with the Contractor’s material hauling operation, the Engineer will determine the amount of maintenance and
 restoration obligation to be shared by each.
 The Engineer will determine the kind and amount of maintenance and restoration work required to restore the haul road
 to a condition equal to the condition existing at the time the hauling operations started. The Engineer’s decision is final, binding,
 and conclusive.
 When hauling over any designated haul road is completed and the Contractor has restored the road or has compensated
 the governmental agency for the restoration as required, the Engineer will accept such restoration or concur in such financial
 settlement for the restoration of the haul road in writing, and such acceptance shall relieve the Contractor of additional obligation in
 connection with the restoration of the designated haul road.
 2051.5 BASIS OF PAYMENT
 The contract lump sum amount for Maintenance and Restoration of Haul Roads includes the cost of maintenance,
 restoration, and the reimbursement to any local government agencies as specified in this section for use of haul roads officially
 designated and used in conjunction with the contract work.
 The Department will not make payment for Maintenance and Restoration of Haul Roads unless one or more haul roads
 were officially designated and used for hauling materials. The Department will make payment at the contract lump sum amount if
 these two conditions were met and regardless of the amount of maintenance and restoration work required, provided work was
 completed or the local government agency certified receipt of payment for such restoration.
 If the Contractor fails or refuses to perform haul road restoration or to make satisfactory financial settlement for such
 restoration as required within the period specified by the Engineer in writing, the Department will complete the restoration work and
 deduct the costs from any moneys that are or may become due the Contractor or require reimbursement from the Contractor’s
 Surety.
 The Department will pay for maintenance and restoration of haul roads on the basis of the following schedule:

 Test for compaction in areas with the greatest rutting or deflection, and near structures, and in an area at least 1 foot
 from an unconfined edge.
 Correct any area represented by a failing test. Perform additional tests in areas with the greatest rutting or deflection.
 For clean granular materials with less than 6% passing the #200 sieve, the Engineer may elect to only use the Quality
 Compaction method, 2105.3.F.2.
 Use the specified density method for virgin materials only.
 The following method may be used in lieu of point testing (penetration index, specified density, or LWD) for material
 meeting 3149.2.B.2, “Select Grading Material”, when the material thickness is 18” or less and when not adjacent to Structures per
 1101, “Definitions”.
 The Engineer may elect, with the concurrence of the Contractor, to have the Contractor test roll per 2111, “Test Rolling”,
 material meeting the requirements of 3149.2.B.2, “Select Granular Material”, in lieu of point compaction testing. If this method is
 adapted, the Contractor would be required to first place 3” of base on top of the material meeting 3149.2.B.2 prior to test rolling.
 For areas failing test rolling the Contractor would be required to remove the base and recompact the material meeting 3149.2.B.2,
 then place the base back, and retest roll. There is no additional compensation to the Contractor, if this method is adapted.
 Additionally, the material meeting 3149.2.B.2 is not accepted, until acceptable test rolling has occurred.

 Unless otherwise directed or approved by the Engineer, place the geotextile with the highest strength direction (usually the
 "machine" or roll direction) oriented in the direction of the greatest expected field stress (this will usually be at right angles to the
 centerline of the construction).
 If multiple pieces of geotextile are required, field or factory sew adjacent strips, with the seams meeting the strength as
 specified in 3733.2B. Use a "double spool" machine capable of sewing a Federal Type 401 locking stitch. Sow a flat, "J", or
 butterfly seam type, using thread with a minimum strength of strength of 25 pounds with 1-2 rows of stitching and 5-7 stitches per
 inch, and consistent with achieving the required seam strength and as recommended by the geotextile manufacturer.
 Approved adhesive listed on the MnDOT approved/qualified products list may be used in lieu of sewing for Types 1, 2, 3,
 4, and 5 geotextiles. The approved list for adhesives is found under the geosynthetic heading. Install per the Adhesive Seams
 Guidelines found on the geosynthetic/adhesive seams links on the MnDOT approved/qualified products list.
 Secure the geotextile so that it is not displaced during subsequent construction. Permit no traffic or construction
 equipment to operate directly on the geotextile. Repair any damaged geotextile to the satisfaction of the Engineer by patching and
 sewing.
 Place fill onto the fabric in uniform lifts as required by the applicable specification, but in no case exceed 12 inches. Use
 fill material as shown in the plan or as directed by the Engineer. Use granular materials for placement from 2 feet above water
 level and below.

 Maximum lift thicknesses are controlled by the capability of the equipment to uniformly compact the entire lift in
 accordance with the following:
 (1) For areas, except structural backfill, the Engineer will restrict lift thickness to no greater than 12 in (loose thickness),
 when uniform results are not achieved.
 (3) For structural backfill, the maximum lift thickness is 6 in compacted (8 in loose) thickness.
 (3) The Engineer may allow thicker lifts over saturated foundation soils. The top of the thicker lift must be at least 4 ft.
 below the grading grade.
 Uniformly blend the entire thickness of each lift before testing moisture content and compaction. Disc soils with greater
 than 20 percent passing the No. 200 sieve.
 Stagger construction traffic uniformly over the full width of the roadway embankment.

 Compaction Testing
 Test for compaction using:
 
 
 
 Quality compaction, and specified density or the LWD for materials not meeting the requirements of 3149.2.B.1,
 “Granular Materials”, or
 Quality compaction, and specified density or granular penetration index or LWD for materials meeting the
 requirements of 3149.2.B.1, “Granular Materials.”
 
 Test for compaction in areas with the greatest rutting or deflection, and near structures, and in an area at least 1 foot
 from an unconfined edge.
 Correct any area represented by a failing test. Perform additional tests in areas with the greatest rutting or deflection.
 For clean granular materials with less than 6% passing the #200 sieve, the Engineer may elect to only use the Quality
 Compaction method, 2106.3.F.2.
 Use the specified density method for virgin materials only.
 The following method may be used in lieu of point testing (penetration index, specified density, or LWD) for material
 meeting 3149.2.B.2, “Select Grading Material” when the material thickness is 18” or less and when not adjacent to Structures per
 1101, “Definitions”.
 The Engineer may elect, with the concurrence of the Contractor, to have the Contractor test roll per 2111, “Test Rolling”,
 material meeting the requirements of 3149.2.B.2, “Select Granular Material”, in lieu of point compaction Testing. If this method is
 adapted, the Contractor would be required to first place 3” of base on top of the material meeting 3149.2.B.2 prior to test rolling.
 For areas failing test rolling the Contractor would be required to remove the base and recompact the material meeting 3149.2.B.2,
 then place the base back, and retest roll. There is no additional compensation to the Contractor, if this method is adapted.
 Additionally, the material meeting 3149.2.B.2 is not accepted, until acceptable test rolling has occurred.

 105
 
 2106.3
 Prepare a smooth surface, free of stones, sticks, or other debris or irregularities that may puncture or tear the geotextile.
 Unless otherwise directed or approved by the Engineer, place the geotextile with the highest strength direction (usually the
 "machine" or roll direction) oriented in the direction of the greatest expected field stress. (This will usually be at right angles to the
 centerline of the construction.)
 If multiple pieces of geotextile are required, field or factory sew adjacent strips, with the seams meeting the strength as
 specified in 3733.2B. Use a "double spool" machine capable of sewing a Federal Type 401 locking stitch. Sow a flat, "J", or
 butterfly seam type, using thread with a minimum strength of strength of 25 pounds with 1-2 rows of stitching and 5-7 stitches per
 inch, and consistent with achieving the required seam strength and as recommended by the geotextile manufacturer.
 Approved adhesive per the MnDOT approved/qualified products list may be used in lieu of sewing for Types 1, 2, 3, 4,
 and 5 geotextiles. The approved list for adhesives is found under the geosynthetic heading. Install per the Adhesive Seams
 Guidelines found on the geosynthetic/adhesive seams links on the MnDOT approved products list.
 Secure the geotextile so that it is not displaced during subsequent construction. Permit no traffic or construction
 equipment to operate directly on the geotextile. Repair any damaged geotextile to the satisfaction of the Engineer by patching and
 sewing.
 Place fill onto the fabric in uniform lifts as required by the applicable specification, but in no case exceed 12 inches. Use
 fill material as shown in the plan or as directed by the Engineer. Use granular materials for placement from 2 feet above water
 level and below.

 Use a control strip to establish a rolling pattern. The control strip should represent a homogenous roadway section and
 have the following characteristics:
 
 
 
 Minimum area of 400 square yards
 Remain in-place and become a part of the completed work.
 
 Use the following to establish a rolling pattern after initial breakdown is complete:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 5.
 
 Randomly select three test points in the control strip and use a nuclear density device (ASTM D2950, in back-scatter
 mode) to determine a wet density at each point after each finish (steel) roller pass.
 Ensure that that the nuclear gauge rests on a flat surface. The density at each point is defined as the average of
 two readings offset 180 degrees.
 Continue compacting until additional roller coverage does not produce appreciable increase in density. Provide
 documentation of the growth curve and maximum target density to the Engineer. Use this for QA/QC process.
 Roll the remainder of that course in accordance with the pattern developed in the control strip for that roller.
 Discontinue and reevaluate the rolling operation (pattern and timing), if surface cracking or checking occurs.
 
 Use this rolling pattern until a new control strip is performed.
 Establish a new rolling pattern by performing a new control strip when there are changes in the mixture that cause the
 original control strip to no longer be representative; changes may include:
 
 
 In-place materials variation, including sections with varying thickness, construction history, etc.
 
 
 
 If vehicles leave indents in the compacted surface.
 
 
 
 Changes in RAP gradation
 
 

 2232.3 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 A
 Equipment
 Mill the existing pavement with a power operated, self-propelled cold milling machine capable of removing concrete and
 bituminous materials to the profile, cross-slope, grade, and elevation uniformly across the pavement surface as shown on the plans.
 Use automatic controls to control grade, elevation, cross-slope, and profile. Use a machine with ski, matching shoe, or an
 independent grade control to reference the existing pavement and automatically establish profile grades along each edge of the
 machine within ±¼ in.
 B
 Operations
 Mill the pavement surface to the depth, width, grade, and cross-slope as shown on the plans. Perform milling without
 tearing or gouging the underlying material. Surface irregularities exceeding ½ inch under a 10-foot straightedge laid transversely
 and longitudinally after milling is complete are unacceptable. Reference the milling operation from an independent grade control in
 areas directed by the Engineer. Establish and maintain grade control as approved by the Engineer.
 Mill the entire pavement width to a flush surface at the end of each work period, when the pavement is open to traffic. If
 uncompleted operations result in a vertical or near vertical longitudinal face, re-slope the longitudinal face to provide a taper,
 construct a temporary bituminous taper or provide protective measures, as approved by the Engineer. Taper transverse cutting
 faces at the end of each working period where pavement is open to traffic. Construct temporary bituminous tapers at intersecting
 streets, around utility appurtenances, and appropriated entrances during the milling operations, as directed by the Engineer.
 Mill areas inaccessible to the milling machine using other equipment or methods as approved by the Engineer.
 The Contractor may recycle the surfacing removed by the milling operations and use on the project in accordance with
 3138, “Aggregate for Base and Surface Courses,” or 3139, “Graded Aggregate for Bituminous Mixtures,” or dispose of the millings
 outside the right-of-way in accordance with 2104.3, “Removing Pavement and Miscellaneous Structures, Construction
 Requirements.”
 After milling to the depth shown on the plans, sweep or vacuum clean the milled area with equipment approved by the
 Engineer. Clean the milled area as approved by the Engineer. Dispose of debris from milling and cleaning operations outside of the
 right-of-way in accordance with 2104.3, “Removing Pavement and Miscellaneous Structures, Construction Requirements,” except as
 otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 Mill previously patched areas to the specified depth below the pavement surface that existed before placement of the
 previous patch, and not from the surface of the patch.
 Avoid disturbing or damaging existing drainage or utility structures on the project. Repair damage resulting from the
 milling operations at no additional cost to the Department.
 Keep the milled pavement surface free of all loose materials and dust.
 2232.4 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 The Engineer will measure pavement milling by the area of each type of surface removed. The Engineer will measure
 areas milled, based on actual finished dimensions of the work.
 2232.5 BASIS OF PAYMENT
 The contract unit price for pavement milling includes the cost of traffic safety, cleanup, and disposal operations.
 The cost of constructing a temporary milled taper and providing, placing, and removing temporary bituminous tapers is
 included in the contract unit price for other relevant contract items.
 The Department will pay for mill pavement surface on the basis of the following schedule:

 Sampling and Determination of Lots
 The Engineer will use the Coarse Aggregate Quality Incentive/Disincentive Workbook to determine the following:
 (1) Random sampling locations in accordance with the Schedule of Materials Control.
 (2) The incentive/disincentive.
 The Engineer will consider the entire project as a single lot for each of the two fractions containing the highest
 percentage by weight. If the project is planned for construction over multiple years and before placing any concrete pavement,
 request that the Engineer calculate the incentive/disincentive payment on a yearly basis. The Engineer, in conjunction with the
 Concrete Engineer, will modify the sampling and testing rates as necessary.
 The Engineer will establish a new statistical family for each change in aggregate source, fraction, or both.
 
 The Engineer will divide a lot representing the plan cubic yards of concrete by the number of samples to form sublots.
 The Engineer will multiply the number of cubic yards in a sublot by a random number to obtain the position in the sublot for the
 sample. The Engineer will split the samples and leave half of the sample for the Contractor. The Engineer’s laboratory will test the
 samples and report the individual results.
 The Engineer will calculate a Quality Index (QI) for each fraction in accordance with the following:
 
 QI  X  k (s)

 Water/Cement (w/c) Ratio
 Provide and place concrete with a water/cement ratio not to exceed 0.40 when using cement only or fly ash and 0.42
 when using slag or ternary. Make any adjustments immediately when the water/cement ratio exceeds 0.40 when using cement
 only or fly ash and 0.42 when using slag or ternary.
 The Engineer will not make incentive payments for water/cement ratio on high-early mixes.
 
 The Engineer will determine the water/cement ratio for concrete hauled in dump or agitator trucks (concrete hauled in
 truck mixers are not eligible for w/c ratio incentives) in accordance with the following:
 M.2.a
 Sampling and Determination of Lots
 The Engineer will sample, test, and record the individual results in accordance with 2301.2.M.2.b, “Water Content
 Determination,” and 2301.3.M.2.d, “Cementitious Content Determination,” at a rate defined in the Schedule of Materials Control.
 The Engineer will use the W/C Ratio Calculation Workbook for moisture testing and determining the incentive/disincentive.
 The Engineer will base the statistical analysis of acceptance for water/cement ratio on a per lot basis representing one
 day’s paving. Each individual water/cement ratio determination is considered a sublot. The lot will represent the cumulative
 average of the sublot values. The Engineer will start a new lot and test if either of the following occur:
 (1)
 Mix design change due to a water/cement ratio exceeding 0.40 when using cement only or fly ash and 0.42

 without distortion of the alignment or grade line.
 Shape and maintain the shoulders to allow surface water to drain away from the pavement and off the shoulders.
 E
 Concrete Equipment and Paving Operations
 Provide self-propelled spreading and finishing machines capable of consolidating and finishing the concrete, and
 producing a dense and homogenous finished surface meeting the requirements specified in 2301, “Concrete Pavement.”
 E.1
 Consistency
 Maintain the concrete at a uniform consistency. The Engineer will not allow an edge slump greater than ⅛ in or irregular
 edge alignment.
 For slipform concrete pavement placement, place the concrete with a slump value that optimizes placement, except
 ensure the concrete does not slough or slump and is adequately consolidated and meets all other requirements of 2301, “Concrete
 Pavement.”
 For fixed form placement, place the concrete with a slump no greater than the maximum allowable slump in accordance
 with Table 2301-4.
 E.2
 Slipform Construction
 Place concrete using a slipform paver or combination of pavers designed to spread, consolidate, screed, and float-finish
 the freshly placed concrete with minimum hand finishing. Provide a slipform paver with a non-oscillating extrusion plate with an
 adjustable angle of entry.
 Place the concrete pavement before placing curb and gutter.
 If the sequence of operations includes placing the curb and gutter before the concrete pavement, submit a jointing plan
 to the Engineer for approval. Submit the jointing plan to the Engineer a minimum of seven (7) calendar days before placing the
 curb and gutter.
 Equip the paver with automatic grade control capable of maintaining both the elevation and longitudinal line shown on
 the plans on both sides of the paver.
 Use an erected string line to achieve the line and grade reference. Tightly stretch a string line set parallel to the
 established grade for the pavement surface to achieve the grade reference. Set the control reference and support the line at
 intervals to maintain the established grade and alignment.
 When constructing concrete overlays, set and use string lines for grade control on both sides of the roadway during
 paving operations.
 Operate the slipform paver with a continuous forward movement coordinating all operations of mixing, providing
 adequate concrete hauling units, and spreading concrete to provide uniform progress with minimal stopping and starting of the
 paver.
 Consolidate the full width and depth of concrete pavement placed by a single pass of a series of internal vibrators.
 Operate full-width vibrators from 3,600 VPM to 7,000 VPM in concrete, and from 4,150 VPM to 8,000 VPM when checked in air.
 Deliver the vibrator impulses directly to the concrete and operate at an intensity to consolidate the concrete uniformly throughout
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 145
 
 2301.3
 the entire depth and width of the concrete. The Contractor may increase the vibrator frequency as approved by the Engineer.
 Perform additional testing as directed by the Engineer at no additional cost to the Department. If the vibrator fails, suspend
 operations and remove unconsolidated concrete.
 Regulate the rate of progress of the vibratory equipment and the duration of the application to fully, but not excessively,
 vibrate the concrete. If the forward progress of the paver stops, suspend the operation of vibrators.
 Attach vibrators to spreading or finishing equipment. Do not allow vibrators to come in contact with preset dowel basket
 assemblies, the grade, pavement reinforcement, or side forms. Do not allow the operation of vibrators to cause separation or
 segregation of the mix ingredients, including the downward displacement of large aggregate or the accumulation of laitance on the
 concrete surface. The Contractor may reduce the vibration frequency within the specified range if reducing the forward progress of
 the paver to avoid segregation of the concrete mix. Connect the power to all vibrators so that they cease when the machine motion
 is stopped. Stop paving operations if a vibrator fails to operate within the range specified above.
 E.2.a
 Electronic Vibration Monitoring Device
 For projects with greater than 3,500 cu. yd, provide an electronic monitoring device meeting the following characteristics
 and requirements to display the operating frequency of each individual internal vibrator for concrete pavement placed by the
 slipform method:

 Top face with deviations no greater than ⅛ in in any 10 ft section,
 Faces of straight forms with deviations no greater than ¼ in in any 10 ft section,
 Forms containing no damaged joint locks or pin pockets, and
 Form lengths at least 10 ft long with vertical joint.
 
 For pavements with radii no greater than 100 ft, use flexible or curved forms approved by the Engineer. Provide devices
 to securely set forms and withstand operation of the paving equipment without springing, settlement, or lateral displacement.
 Provide forms with joint locks to tightly join the ends of abutting form sections. Connect individual form sections using methods
 that create a continuous form.
 Set the forms to the alignment and grade shown on the plans for a distance equal to at least 3 h ahead of concrete
 placement.
 Compact the foundation before placing the forms in accordance with 2301.3.D, “Subgrade and Aggregate Base
 Preparations.” Ensure the forms have a firm and uniform bearing over the entire base area, are tightly joined and securely staked,
 and are clean and free of accumulations of hardened concrete. Coat the contact faces of the forms with an approved form coating
 material in accordance with 3902, “Form Coating Material,” before placing the concrete.
 During a rain event, remove and reset the forms as necessary to allow drainage.

 Continue vibration to achieve adequate consolidation, without segregation, for the full depth and width of the area
 Provide an adequate number and capacity of machines to perform the work at a rate equal to the concrete delivery rate.
 
 Strike-off concrete with a clary screed, unless otherwise approved by the Engineer. Finish small or irregular areas that
 are inaccessible to finishing equipment using other methods as approved by the Engineer.
 Discontinue any operation that causes displacement of the side forms from the line or grade or causes undue delay, as
 determined by the Engineer, due to mechanical difficulties.
 E.3.c
 Removal of Forms
 Do not remove side forms of pavement and back forms on integrant curb earlier than 12 h after placing the concrete,
 unless otherwise approved by the Engineer. Remove forms without exerting shock or strain, including temperature variations, on
 the pavement or curb. Cure concrete in accordance with 2301.3.M.1.a, “Membrane Curing Method.”
 F
 Placing Concrete
 Construct mainline pavement in a single layer of concrete. Place the concrete pavement in one complete pass of the
 paving machine to minimize the need for hand finishing.
 The Engineer will not allow the edges of the pavement, including longitudinal joints, to deviate from the line shown on
 the plans by greater than ½ inch at any point.
 Place concrete without any vertical surface deviations of the plastic concrete when matching into the beginning and end
 of the project, bridge approaches and decks, unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer. Correct all high and low spots identified
 within the 10 foot straight edge.
 Coordinate paving operations for mixing, delivering, spreading, and extruding the concrete to provide uniform progress of
 the paver. Use sufficient trucks to ensure a steady forward progress of the paver. If the forward movement of the paver stops for
 a period long enough to create a cold joint or honeycombing, construct a header joint in accordance with 2301.3.F.5 “Constructing
 Headers.”
 Do not add water to the surface of the concrete to aid in finishing without the approval of the Engineer. The Engineer
 will give approval to replace evaporated surface water directly behind the paver caused by a halt in forward progress from a shortterm breakdown in equipment or supply of concrete. The Contractor can request approval to add water to the surface when cutting
 bumps or filling dips in the plastic concrete each time additional water is needed. If the Contractor adds water to the pavement
 surface without approval by the Engineer, the Engineer will not pay water/cement or pavement smoothness incentives on sections
 where the water is added and the Engineer may reject the pavement in accordance with 1512, “Unacceptable and Unauthorized
 Work.”
 Set manhole and catch basin frames or rings to the elevation shown on the plans during the paving operations. Do not
 form “box-outs” of castings unless approved by the Engineer.
 Dump or discharge concrete without causing grade displacement or damage to the existing asphalt or bond breaker layer.
 Repair damage to the grade in accordance with 2301.3.D, “Subgrade and Aggregate Base Preparations,” existing asphalt or bond
 breaker layer as approved by the Engineer at no additional cost to the Department. Provide protection for turning concrete trucks.

 Handling and Placement Requirements
 Prior to the placement of the geotextile interlayer, remove loose or deteriorated surfacing in accordance with
 2231.3, “Construction” or as directed by the Engineer. The Contractor may propose a cementitious material, or
 other equivalent patching material as approved by the Engineer. The patch shall provide a flat, tight surface
 before placement of the geotextile interlayer.
 Roll geotextile out on underlying substrate. Ensure geotextile is tight without excess wrinkles and folds. Place
 the geotextile within 7 days of concrete paving in such a way that free drainage of water within the geotextile
 is not impaired.
 (2.1)
 When covering the entire surface with the geotextile, the geotextile should overlap by 8 in +/- 2 in.
 In no location should more than 3 layers of geotextile overlap.
 (2.2)
 When placing geotextile strips only under dowel bar basket assemblies, the geotextile width should
 extend longitudinally 2 to 3 in outside each side of the bottom rungs of the dowel bar basket
 assembly for the entire width of the roadway.
 Geotextile should extend at least 3 in beyond the most outside edge of the new concrete or extended out to
 the location shown in the plan.
 Geotextile must drain into subsurface drains or a drainable pavement layer as shown in the plan.
 Place the geotextile interlayer to a grade and tolerance such that the overlying PCC pavement thickness will
 meet minimum design requirements.
 Adhere the geotextile to the underlying substrate using an approved cylinder spray adhesive for geotextiles and
 recommended by the manufacturer for use to attach the geotextile to the underlying concrete or asphalt.
 Apply a minimum 12 in wide adhesive bond to attach any edge of geotextile to the underlying substrate or to
 another piece of geotextile. Apply pressure to the geotextile to set the adhesive prior to placing the concrete.
 The Contractor may propose and demonstrate alternate methods for satisfactorily anchoring the geotextile to
 the Engineer for approval.
 Slightly dampen, but not saturate, the geotextile, prior to concrete placement.
 
 F.3.b
 Maintenance Requirements
 Maintain the geotextile interlayer during and after placement throughout its entire length until placement of the concrete
 overlay. During this maintenance period, correct any deficiencies to the satisfaction of the Engineer. The bond breaker layer shall
 properly drain at all times. Do not place geotextile on areas subject to excess traffic until immediately before concrete placement.
 During construction, keep the geotextile and associated drain trenches free of fine soils or other contaminates. If
 contamination of the geotextile interlayer occurs, remove and replace or clean the surface to the satisfaction of the Engineer to
 assure drainage capacity as designed at no cost to the Department.
 If a rain event occurs after placement of the geotextile, remove excess water from the geotextile by use of rollers or any
 method acceptable to the Engineer.

 Exploratory Coring
 The Engineer will require an exploratory core in the adjacent lane if placed in the same paving operation. If the length of
 the exploratory core in the adjacent lane is at least equal to the plan thickness minus ½ in, the Engineer will not require additional
 cores in the adjacent lane.
 Take exploratory cores in accordance with the following procedure:
 (1)
 At any location within 10 ft on each side of the deficient thickness location and at the same distance from the
 pavement centerline. If the length of each of the first exploratory cores is at least equal to the plan thickness
 minus ½ in, the Engineer will not require additional cores from this location.
 (2)
 If any cores do not fall within the plan thickness minus ½ in, take additional exploratory cores at 25 ft intervals
 and at the same distance from the pavement centerline, as directed by the Engineer.
 (3)
 Perform coring in the direction of the deficiency until obtaining a core with a length at least equal to the plan
 thickness minus ½ in in each lane separately. The Engineer will use exploratory cores to determine the extent
 of deficient pavement thickness for adjusting the contract unit price or requiring pavement removal and
 replacement.
 L.6
 Non-conforming Thickness
 The Department defines the defective pavement area as the entire area surrounding the deficient core within the entire
 width of the traffic lane and between acceptable cores.
 The Department considers the pavement acceptable to remain in place in the remaining areas as the increment where the
 cores show a thickness deficiency no greater than plan thickness minus ½ in.
 L.6.a
 Defective Pavement Area between ½ in and 1 in
 For cores showing a pavement thickness greater than the plan thickness minus ½ in to 1 in, the Contractor may choose
 one of the following:
 (1)
 Remove and replace the defective pavement area at no additional cost to the Department, or
 (2)
 Leave the pavement in place with a monetary deduction of $20.00 per sq. yd for the defective pavement area,
 as approved by the Engineer.
 L.6.b
 Defective Pavement Area > 1 in
 For cores showing a pavement thickness greater than 1 in below the plan thickness, the Engineer, in conjunction with the
 Concrete Engineer, will determine whether the Contractor will do one of the following:
 (1)
 Remove and replace the defective pavement area at no additional cost to the Department, or
 (2)
 Leave the pavement in place at no cost to the Department and apply a monetary deduction of $20.00 per sq.
 yd for the defective pavement area in accordance with 1503, “Conformity with Contract Documents.”
 L.7
 Final Average Core Thickness
 After all coring (including exploratory coring) is completed; the Engineer will use all the cores (QCP-Core, PVC or QAC) to
 determine the final average core thickness for each plan thickness.
 If all of the cores (QCP-Core, PVC or QAC) meet the design plan thickness requirements of the project, the Engineer will
 consider the final average core thickness for each plan thickness acceptable.
 If any of the cores (QCP-Core, PVC or QAC) do not meet the design plan thickness requirements of the project, the
 Engineer will determine the final average core thickness for each plan thickness, except for the following:

 If exploratory cores are taken to identify the defective pavement area, substitute the two outside exploratory
 cores that are within plan thickness minus ½ in for the deficient PVC or QAC.
 If the length of a PVC or QAC exceeds the plan thickness plus 0.30 in, the Engineer will limit the core length to
 the plan thickness plus 0.30 in. If the final average core thickness for each plan thickness is deficient by more
 than the plan thickness minus 0.10 in, the Engineer will pay for the pavement by the plan thickness at the
 contract unit price less the monetary deductions in Table 2301-17, excluding areas of defective pavement as

 Concrete Curing and Protection
 After completing final finishing operations, cure all exposed concrete surfaces. Use one of the following curing methods:
 (1)
 
 (2)
 
 In accordance with 2301.3.M.1.a, “Membrane Curing Method”, place the membrane curing compound
 conforming to 3754, “Poly-Alpha Methylstyrene (AMS) Membrane Curing Compound,” or 3755, “Linseed Oil
 Membrane Curing Compound,” within 30 minutes of concrete placement or once the bleed water has
 dissipated, unless the Engineer directs otherwise in accordance with 2301.3.M.1.a, “Membrane Curing Method.”
 Place the membrane curing compound on the edges within 30 minutes after permanent removal of the forms or
 curing blankets, unless the contract requires otherwise.
 Place plastic curing blankets or completely saturated burlap curing blankets in accordance with 2301.3.M.1.b,
 “Curing Blanket Method,” as soon as practical without marring the surface.
 
 Whenever weather conditions are such as to cause unusual or adverse placing and finishing conditions or equipment
 failures occur, expedite the application of a curing method or temporarily suspend the mixing and placing operations, as the
 conditions require.
 If necessary to remove the coverings to saw joints or perform other required work, and if the Engineer approves, remove
 the covering for the minimum time required to complete that work.
 Failure to comply with the above provisions will result in the Engineer, in conjunction with the Concrete Engineer,
 applying a monetary deduction in accordance with 1503, “Conformity with Contract Documents.” When there is not a separate
 contract unit price for Structural Concrete, the Engineer will apply a monetary deduction of $30.00 per cu. yd or 50 percent of the
 Contractor-provided invoice amount for the concrete in question, whichever is less.

 Curing Methods
 
 M.1.a
 Membrane Curing Method
 Before application, agitate the curing compound as received in the shipping container to obtain a homogenous mixture.
 Protect membrane curing compounds from freezing before application. Handle and apply the membrane curing compound in
 accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Apply the curing compound in accordance with the following:
 (1.1)
 At a minimum rate of 1 gal per 150 sq. ft of surface curing area.
 (1.2)
 Apply curing compound homogeneously to provide a uniform, solid, white opaque coverage on all exposed
 concrete surfaces (equal to a white sheet of typing paper) at the time of application. If using a Department
 approved curing compound with a non-white base color, apply the compound to provide a uniform, solid,
 opaque consistency meeting the intent of the requirement in this section.
 (1.3)
 If the curing compound is damaged during the curing period, immediately repair the damaged area by respraying.
 (1.4)
 If the Engineer determines that the initial or corrective spraying result in unsatisfactory curing, the Engineer
 may require the Contractor to use the blanket curing method, at no additional cost to the Department.
 Use the fully-automatic, self-propelled mechanical power sprayer approved by the Engineer to apply the curing compound
 in accordance with the following:
 (2.1)
 Operate the equipment to direct the curing compound to the surface from two different lateral directions,
 (2.2)
 Do not allow the sprayer to ride on the pavement surface,
 
 156
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2301.3
 (2.3)
 (2.4)
 
 Ensure the sprayer covers the entire lane width and atomizes the curing compound, and
 If puddling, dripping, or non-uniform application occurs, suspend the operation to perform corrections as
 approved by the Engineer.
 
 Use a fully automatic, self-propelled mechanical power sprayer equipped with the following as approved by the Engineer:
 (3.1)
 A re-circulating bypass system that provides for continuous agitation of the reservoir material,
 (3.2)
 Separate filters for the hose and nozzle,
 (3.3)
 Check valve nozzles,
 (3.4)
 Multiple or adjustable nozzle system that provides for variable spray patterns,
 (3.5)
 A shield to control loss of material by wind action, and
 (3.6)
 A spray-bar drive system that operates independently of the wheels or track drive system.
 For applying the curing compound on pavements that are 10 ft wide or less and irregular shaped surfaces, the Engineer
 will allow an airless spraying machine that complies with the following:
 (4.1)
 A re-circulating bypass system that provides for continuous agitation of the reservoir material,
 (4.2)
 Separate filters for the hose and nozzle, and
 (4.3)
 Multiple or adjustable nozzle system that provides for variable spray patterns.
 M.1.b
 Curing Blanket Method
 After completion of the finishing operations and without marring the concrete, cover the concrete with curing blankets.
 Install in a manner that envelops the exposed concrete and prevents loss of water vapor. After the concrete has cured, apply
 membrane curing compound to the concrete surfaces that will remain exposed in the completed work.
 M.2
 Protection Against Rain
 Protect the concrete from damage due to rain. Have available, near the site of the work, materials for protection of the
 edges and surface of the concrete. Should any damage result, the Engineer will suspend operations until corrective action is taken
 and may subject the rain-damaged concrete to 1503, “Conformity with Contract Documents,” and 1512, “Unacceptable and
 Unauthorized Work.” If corrective work is performed to the satisfaction of the Engineer, the Engineer will provide payment for
 incentives provided the concrete meets all other requirements of 2301, “Concrete Pavement.”
 M.3
 Protection Against Cold Weather
 If the national weather service forecast for the construction area predicts air temperatures of 36 °F or less within the next
 24 h and the Contractor wishes to place concrete, the Contractor shall submit a cold weather protection plan.
 Protect the concrete from damage, including freezing due to cold weather. Should any damage result, the Engineer will
 suspend operations until corrective action is taken and may subject the damaged concrete to 1503, “Conformity with Contract
 Documents,” and 1512, “Unacceptable and Unauthorized Work.”
 M.3.a
 Cold Weather Protection Plan
 Submit a proposed time schedule and plans for cold weather protection of concrete in writing to the Engineer for
 acceptance that provides provisions for adequately protecting the concrete during placement and curing. Do not place concrete
 until the Engineer accepts the cold weather protection plans.
 M.4
 Vibratory and Backfilling Protection
 Protect newly placed concrete from damage by adjacent vibratory or backfilling operations for a minimum of 24 h.
 Resume vibratory and backfilling operations after the concrete has reached a minimum compressive strength of 2,000 psi or a
 flexural strength of 250 psi. Cast concrete control specimens in accordance with 2461.3.G.5, “Test Methods and Specimens.” The
 Engineer will test the control specimens. If the Engineer discovers evidence of damaged concrete, the Engineer will suspend work
 until the Contractor corrects the work. The Engineer may reject damaged concrete in accordance with 1503, “Conformity with
 Contract Documents,” and 1512, “Unacceptable and Unauthorized Work.”
 The Contractor may use hand-operated concrete consolidation equipment, walk-behind vibratory-plate compactors, rollers
 in “static” mode, and fine grading machines 24 h after placing the concrete, and other equipment as approved by the Engineer, in
 conjunction with the Concrete Engineer.
 N
 Joint Construction Operations

 Quality Control
 The Contractor is responsible for obtaining all the quality control (QC/QA) sampling and testing as per the Materials
 Control Schedule.
 I
 Polymer Modified Emulsion Membrane
 Verify the application rate of the polymer modified emulsion membrane by dividing the volume of polymer modified
 emulsion membrane used by the area of paving for that day.
 J
 Quality Assurance
 The Engineer is responsible for all quality assurance (QA) sampling according to Materials Control Schedule (MCS). The
 QA sample is the Department’s companion sample to the Contractor’s QC sample and tested as required.
 J.1
 Verification Sampling and Testing
 The Department will test at a minimum one (1) verification sample per day to assure compliance of the Contractor's QC
 program. The Department will decide daily, which QC/QA companion samples are to be submitted and tested as the verification
 sample. The verification sample can be any one or all of the QC/QA split samples.
 In addition the Engineer may obtain additional verification samples at any time and location during production to
 determine quality levels of the mixture. When additional verification samples are taken, the Department will provide the Contractor
 a verification companion. The contractor is required to test and use this verification companion sample as part of the QC program.
 Use the verification companion sample to replace the next scheduled QC sample.
 Compare the verification companion sample to the verification sample for compliance with allowable tolerances in Table
 2353-3, “UTBWC Allowable Difference between Contractor and Department Test Results”. The Department’s verification test results
 will be available to the Contractor within 2 working days from the time the sample is delivered to the District Laboratory.

 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2353.3
 If the tolerances between the Contractor’s verification companion and the Department’s verification sample do
 not meet the requirements of Table 2353-3, “UTBWC Allowable Difference between Contractor and Department Test Results”, the
 Department will retest the material. If the retests fail to meet tolerances, the Department will substitute the Department's
 verification test results for the Contractor’s results in the QC program and use those results for acceptance. The Department will
 only substitute the out-of-tolerance parameters.
 The Department will test the previously collected QA samples until they meet the tolerances or until the Department has
 tested all of the remaining samples. After testing the samples, the Department will test QA samples subsequent to the verification
 sample until tolerances are met.
 If the adj. AFT calculation does not meet the tolerance in table 2353-3, equalize the Departments adj. AFT result by
 increasing the original Department value by 0.5 microns. The increased Department adj. AFT will be the basis for acceptance.
 The Department will base acceptance on QC data with substitution of Department test results for those parameters that
 are out of tolerance. Cease mixture production and placement if reestablished test results do not meet tolerances within 48 h.
 Resume production and placement only after meeting the tolerances.

 If it is determined records were falsified.
 
 If the Engineer revokes plant certification, the Department may revoke the Technical Certification of the individual or
 individuals involved. The Department will maintain a list of companies with revoked certifications.
 G.2
 Quality Assurance (QA)
 The Engineer will perform Quality Assurance (QA) as part of the acceptance process. QA is the process of monitoring and
 evaluating various aspects of the Contractor’s testing as described below. The QA sample is the Department’s companion sample to
 the Contractor’s QC sample. QA testing is performed to accept the work. The Engineer will perform the following:

 G.3
 Verification Sample
 The Department will test a minimum of one of the companion samples to the Contractor’s QC samples and identify this as
 a verification sample. The Department’s verification sample is used to assure compliance of the Contractor's QC program. The
 verification samples can be any one or all of the splits to the Contractor’s QC samples. Additionally, the Department can take a
 random sample at any time from behind the paver or from the truck box and will consider this a verification sample. The split of
 this sample, given to the Contractor, must be tested by the Contractor and will replace the next scheduled QC sample. The
 Department recommends sampling enough material to accommodate retesting in case the samples fail.
 The Department will perform verification testing on at least one set of production tests in accordance with 2360.2.G.6.b,
 “Production,” and 2360.2.G.7, “Production Test,” on a daily basis per mix type. Use the verification companion sample to verify the
 requirements of Table 3139-2, Table 3139-3, and Table 2360-7. Compare the verification companion sample to the verification
 sample for compliance with allowable tolerances in Table 2360-9, “Allowable Differences between Contractor and Department Test
 Results.” These include the mixture properties of Gmm (mixture maximum gravity), Gmb (mixture bulk gravity), asphalt binder
 content, Adjusted AFT (calculated), Coarse and Fine Aggregate crushing, and gradation. Perform one test per week on a
 verification companion for coarse and fine aggregate crushing meeting the requirements of 2360.2.G.7.g “Coarse Aggregate
 Angularity” and 2360.2.G.7.h, “Fine Aggregate Angularity.” These do not include the aggregate bulk specific gravity Gsb, fines to
 effective asphalt, or the tensile strength ratio (TSR). Determine the asphalt binder content and gradation in accordance with the
 extraction method specified in 2360.2.G.7.a, “Asphalt Binder Content,” or 23602.G.7.b, “Gyratory Bulk Specific Gravity.
 The Contractor may access the Department's verification test results for Gmm (mixture maximum gravity), Gmb (mixture
 bulk gravity), air voids (calculated), asphalt binder content, within 2 working days from the time the sample is delivered to the
 District Laboratory. The Department will provide the gradation, crushing, and Adj. AFT (calculated) results to the Contractor within
 three working days. The Department will include the verification test results on the test summary sheet. The Department will
 compare the results with the Contractor’s verification companion for the allowable tolerances in Table 2360-9, “Allowable
 Differences between Contractor and Department Test Results.” The Department will consider the verification process complete if
 the Contractor’s verification companion meets the tolerances in Table 2360-9.
 If the tolerances between the Contractor’s verification companion and the Department’s verification sample do not meet
 the requirements of Table 2360-9, the Department will retest the material. If the retests fail to meet tolerances, the Department
 will substitute the Department's verification test results for the Contractor’s results in the QC program and use those results for
 acceptance. The Department will only substitute the out-of-tolerance parameters and will recalculate volumetric properties if
 applicable.
 If the Adj. AFT calculation does not meet the tolerance, equalize the Department Adj. AFT result by increasing the original
 Department value by 0.5 microns. Use the increased Department Adj. AFT for the Individual Adjusted AFT result and to calculate
 the Moving Average Adj. AFT results. The increased Department Adj. AFT will form the basis for acceptance.
 
 186
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2360.2
 
 If the verification sample retests do not meet tolerances, the Department will immediately investigate the cause of the
 difference that will include a review of testing equipment, procedures, worksheets, gyratory specimen height sheets, and personnel
 to determine the source of the problem. The Engineer may require both the Department and Contractor to perform at least one
 hot-cold comparison of mixture properties.
 To perform a hot-cold comparison, split the sample into three representative portions. The Engineer will observe the
 Contractor testing. Immediately compact one part while still hot. Apply additional heating to raise the temperature of the sample
 to compaction temperature if necessary. Allow the second and third part to cool to air temperature. Retain the second part and
 transport the third part to the District Materials Laboratory. On the same day and at the same time as the District Materials
 Laboratory, heat samples to compaction temperature and compact. Develop a calibration factor to compare the specific gravity of
 the hot compacted samples to reheated compacted samples. Use at least two gyratory specimens for each test. The Engineer or
 the Contractor may request that this test be repeated.
 Reheat mix samples to 160° F to allow splitting of the sample into representative fractions for the various tests. Do not
 overheat the mixture portions used for testing maximum specific gravity test.
 The Department will test the previously collected QA samples until they meet the tolerances or until the Department has
 tested all of the remaining samples. After testing the samples, the Department will test QA samples subsequent to the verification
 sample until tolerances are met. The Department will base acceptance on QC data. The Department will base acceptance on QC
 data with substitution of Department test results for those parameters out of tolerance. Cease mixture production and placement if
 reestablished test results do not meet tolerances within 48 h. Resume production and placement only after meeting the tolerances.
 The process for dispute resolution is available on the Bituminous Office website.
 If the Engineer analyzes the data using methods for determination of bias on file in the Bituminous Office and finds a bias
 in the test results, the Engineer will specify which results to use. If through analysis of data, it is determined that there is a bias in
 the test results, the Engineer will determine which results are appropriate and will govern.

 be calibrated and operational.
 Calibrate and correlate all testing equipment in accordance with the Bituminous Manual and Laboratory Manual. Keep
 records of calibration for each piece of testing equipment in the same facility as the equipment.
 G.4.b
 Sampling and Testing
 Take QC samples at random tonnage or locations, quartered from a larger sample of mixture. Sample randomly and in
 accordance with the Schedule of Materials Control. Determine random numbers and tonnage or locations using the Bituminous
 Manual; Section 5-693.7 Table A or ASTM D 3665, Section 5, or, an Engineer approved alternate method of random number
 generation. Sample either behind the paver or from the truck box at the plant site. Other sampling locations can be approved by
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 187
 
 2360.2
 the Engineer. The Contractor must decide and notify the Engineer where samples will be taken before production begins. The
 Contractor and Engineer must both agree to a change of sampling location once production has begun. The procedure for truck
 box sampling is on the Bituminous Office website. The Contractor will obtain at least a 130 pound sample. Split the sample in the
 presence of the Inspector. The Inspector will retain possession of the Agency portion of each split sample that is taken and
 randomly submit a minimum of one sample, on a daily basis, to the District Laboratory for Verification testing (see 2360.2.G.3).
 Store compacted mixture specimens and loose mixture companion samples for 10 calendar days. Label these split companion
 samples with companion numbers.
 If coarse and fine aggregate angularity are not evaluated for every QC sample retain the extracted gradation samples for
 the respective QC samples for additional testing. Keep the aggregate samples in containers with field identification labels for a
 period of 10 calendar days. The Engineer will identify which extracted gradation sample is the Verification Companion and whether
 it is to be tested for coarse and fine aggregate angularity.
 G.5
 Production Test Requirements
 Determine the planned tonnage for each mixture planned for production during the production day. Divide the planned
 production by 1,000 and round to the next highest whole number. The result is the number of production tests required for the
 mixture. Table 2360-11, “Production Testing Rates” shows the required production tests.
 Split the planned production into even increments and select sample locations as described above. If actual tonnage is
 greater than the planned tonnage, repeat the calculation above and provide additional tests if the calculation results in a higher
 number of production tests. During production, the Department will not require mixture volumetric property tests if mix production
 is no greater than 300 ton. Provide production tests if the accumulative weight on successive days is greater than 300 ton.
 If there is a choice of more than one MnDOT approved test procedure, select one method at the beginning of the project
 with the approval of the Engineer and use that method for the entire project. The Contractor and Engineer may agree to change
 test procedures during the construction of the project.
 G.5a

 G.7.g
 Coarse Aggregate Angularity
 Test the Coarse Aggregate Angularity (CAA) meeting the requirements of Laboratory Manual Method 1214 to determine
 the CAA on composite blend from aggregates used in production of hot mix asphalt. Ensure CAA test results meet the requirements
 in accordance with Table 3139-3.
 The Contractor may test mixtures containing virgin aggregates from composite belt samples. Test mixtures containing
 RAP from extracted aggregates taken from standard production samples. Test the percentage of fractured faces of the composite
 aggregate blend less than 100 percent twice a day for each mixture blend for at least two days, then one test per day if the test
 samples meet the CAA requirements. If the CAA crushing test results are greater than 8 percent of the requirements, take one
 sample per day and perform one test per week.
 Report CAA results on the test summary sheet. The Department may reduce payment in accordance with Table 2360-15,
 “Reduced Payment Schedule for Individual Test Results,” for mixture placed and represented by results below the minimum
 requirement in accordance with Table 3139-3. The Department will calculate tonnage subjected to reduced payment as the tons
 placed from the sample point of the failing test to the sampling point where the test result meets the specifications.
 G.7.h
 Fine Aggregate Angularity
 Use Laboratory Manual Method 1206 to test the composite blend from aggregates used in production of asphalt mixtures
 for Fine Aggregate Angularity (FAA) meeting the requirements of Table 3139-3. The Contractor may test mixtures that contain
 virgin aggregates from composite belt samples. Test mixtures that contain RAP from extracted aggregates taken from standard
 production samples. Perform two tests per day for each mixture blend for at least two days to test the percentage of uncompacted
 voids from the composite aggregate blend, then one test per day if the samples meet FAA requirements. If FAA test results are
 greater than 5 percent of the requirement, take one sample per day and one test per week.
 Report FAA results on the test summary sheet. The Department may reduce payment in accordance with Table 2360-16,
 “Reduced Payment Schedule for Individual Test Results,” for mixture placed and represented by results below the minimums in
 accordance with Table 3139-3. The Department will calculate tonnage subjected to reduced payment as the tons placed from the
 sample point of the failing test to the sampling point where the test result meets the specifications.

 JMF Adjustment
 Begin mixture production with aggregate proportions within 5 percent of the design proportions and mixture parameters
 in Table 2360-14 within the JMF limits shown. Use all the aggregate proportions included on the Mixture Design Report unless the
 aggregate proportion is shown as 0 percent. If the Contractor provides the District Materials Laboratory with prior documented
 production data showing how production affects the mixture properties or if the Contractor provides the District Materials
 Laboratory with a written justification or explanation of material changes since the original mixture submittal waive the preceding
 requirements.
 G.13.a JMF Request for Adjustment
 The Contractor may make a request to the Bituminous Engineer or District Materials Engineer for a JMF adjustment to the
 mix design if the QC test results indicate a necessary change to achieve the specified properties. Do not use aggregates or
 materials not part of the original mix design to make adjustments unless otherwise approved by the Engineer, in conjunction with
 the District Materials Engineer or the Department Bituminous Engineer.
 A Certified Level II Bituminous QM Mix Designer will review the requested change for the Department. If the request
 meets the design requirements in Table 3139-2,”Aggregate Gradation Broad Bands”, Table 3139-3,”Mixture Aggregate
 Requirements”, and Table 2360-7, “Mixture Requirements,” the Department will issue a revised Mixture Design Report. Each trial
 mixture design submittal in accordance with 2360.2.E, “Mixture Design” may have three JMF adjustments per mixture per project
 without charge. The Department will charge the Contractor $500 for each additional JMF adjustment requests.
 Perform an interactive process with the Engineer before making JMF adjustments. Make JMF adjustments only within the
 mixture specification gradation design broadbands in accordance with Table 3139-2. Submit a new JMF if redesigning the mixture.
 Only reduce the JMF asphalt content if the moving average Adj. AFT is 8.5µ or more and Individual Adjusted AFT is at least 7.5 µ.
 The department will not allow consecutive requests for a JMF adjustment without production data. Continue calculation
 of the moving average after the approval of the JMF.
 G.13.b JMF Request for Adjustment for Proportion Change > 10%
 If requesting a JMF adjustment for a proportion change greater than 10 percent from the currently produced mixture for
 a single stockpile aggregate, provide supporting production test data from at least four tests run at an accelerated testing rate of
 one test per 500 ton with the adjustment request. The Department will base acceptable verification and approval of the requested
 JMF on individual and moving average test results in addition to the requirements listed above. Individual test results must be
 within twice the requested JMF limits for percent
 asphalt binder, production air voids, and Adj. AFT. Individual gradations must be within the Broad Bands. The moving average
 values must be within the control limits in accordance with Table 2360-14. Continue to calculate the moving average after the
 change in proportions.
 If the mixture meets the design requirements as discussed in G.13.a, the District Materials Laboratory will sign the
 request for JMF adjustment effective from the point of the proportion change. If the mixture fails to meet the design requirements,
 the Department will either reduce the payment or direct the Contractor to remove and replace. Do not make consecutive requests
 for JMF adjustments without production data.
 G.13.c

 JMF Request for Adjustment When Cumulative Proportion Changes > 10%
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2360.2
 Submit a request for JMF adjustment when the cumulative change on any one product exceeds 10% from the original
 MDR. The Department will issue a revised MDR provided the mixture meets the requirements in Table 3139-2,”Aggregate
 Gradation Broad Bands”, Table 3139-3,”Mixture Aggregate Requirements”, and Table 2360-7, “Mixture Requirements”.
 G.14
 Failing Materials
 The Department will base material acceptance on individual and moving average test results. The Department will use
 isolated test results for acceptance of air voids at the start of mixture production. The Department will consider individual test
 results greater than two times the JMF bands as failing. The Department will fail moving average test results exceeding the JMF
 limits. Begin new summary sheets annually for winter carry-over projects.
 Stop production and make adjustments if the moving average values exceed the JMF limits. Restart production after
 performing the adjustments and notifying the Engineer. Resume testing at the accelerated rates and for the tests listed in
 Table 2360-10, “Production Start-Up Testing Rates,” for the next 2,000 ton of mixture produced. Continue calculating the moving
 average after the stop in production.
 The Department will consider mixture produced where the moving average of four exceeds the JMF limits as
 unsatisfactory in accordance with 2360.2.G.14.d, “Moving Average Failure at Mixture Start-Up – Production Air Voids,”
 2360.2.G.14.e, “Moving Average Failure at Mixture Start-Up — Adjusted AFT,” 2360.2.G.14.f, “Moving Average Failure - Production
 Air Voids,” and 2360.2.G.14.g, “Moving Average Failure — Percent Asphalt Binder Content, Gradation, and Adj. AFT.”
 If the total production of a mixture type for the entire project requires no greater than four tests the Department will
 accept the material in accordance with 2360.2.G.14.b, “Isolated Failures at Mixture Start-Up — Production Air Voids,” and
 2360.2.G.14.c, “Individual Failure — Gradation, Percent Asphalt Binder, Production Air Voids, and Adj. AFT.”
 If the Contractor's testing data fails to meet the tolerances in accordance with Table 2360-9, “Allowable Differences
 between Contractor and Department Test Results,” the Department will substitute QA and verification data to determine the
 payment factor.
 G.14.a Ratio of New Added Asphalt Binder to Total Asphalt Binder – Acceptance Criteria
 Minimum design ratio of new added asphalt binder to total asphalt binder is shown in Table 2360-15 below. During
 production the ratio must meet individual and moving average requirements as listed in Table 2360-15,”Ratio of New Added Asphalt
 Binder to Total Asphalt Binder Acceptance Criteria”. If the individual or moving average ratio drops below the minimum
 requirement, the Contractor must stop production and make adjustments to correct the process. Restart production only after
 notifying the Engineer of the adjustments made. The calculation of the moving average will continue after the stop in production.

 G.14.b Isolated Failures at Mixture Start-Up – Production Air Voids
 At the start-up of mixture production, use the first three isolated test results for production air voids before establishing a
 moving average of four. Calculate isolated production air voids using the maximum mixture specific gravity and the corresponding
 bulk specific gravity from that single test. After testing four samples and establishing a moving average of four, the Department will
 base acceptance on individual and moving average production air voids.
 The Department will not accept the material if any of the first three isolated test results for production air voids exceeds
 twice the JMF bands from the target listed on the Mixture Design Report at the start of production. The Department will reduce
 payment for unacceptable material in accordance with Table 2360-16, “Reduced Payment Schedule for Individual Test Results.”
 The Department will calculate the quantity of unacceptable material on the tonnage placed from the sample point of the failing test
 to the sample point when the isolated test result is back within twice the JMF bands. If the failure occurs at the first test after the
 start of production, the Department will calculate the tonnage subject to reduced payment as described above, including the
 tonnage from the start of production.
 If isolated air voids are less than 1.0 percent or greater than 7.0 percent, the Engineer will either reduce the payment or
 order the material removed and replaced at no additional cost to the Department. The Engineer may require the Contractor to test
 in-place mixture to better define the removal and replacement limits. The Engineer may require the Contractor to test in-place

 The Department will not accept material if the individual tests for percent asphalt binder content or production air voids
 exceeds twice the JMF bands from the target listed on the Mix Design Report. The Department will reduce payment in accordance
 with Table 2360-16, “Reduced Payment Schedule for Individual Test Results.” The Department will calculate the material subject to
 reduced payment as the material placed from the sample point of the failing test until the sample point when the test result is back
 within twice the JMF limits. If the failure occurs at the first test after the start of daily production, the Department will include
 tonnage from the start of production that day with the tonnage subjected to reduced payment.
 The Department will not accept material if individual air voids are less than 1.0 percent or greater than 7.0 percent,
 Remove and replace unacceptable material at no additional cost to the Department as directed by the Engineer. Test in-place
 mixture to better define the area to be removed and replaced as directed by the Engineer. Test mixture placed before the failing
 test result as directed by the Engineer. The Department may reduce payment for unacceptable material at 50 percent of the
 relevant contract unit price.
 G.14.d Moving Average Failure at Mixture Start-Up — Production Air Voids
 If a moving average failure occurs within any of the first three moving average results after mixture start-up (tests 4, 5,
 6), the Department will accept the mixture if the individual air void, corresponding to the moving average failure meets the JMF
 limits. The Department will not accept material if the individual air void fails to meet the JMF limit. The Department will reduce
 payment for unacceptable material unless the Engineer determines that the isolated air void corresponding to the individual air void
 meets the JMF limit. The Department will pay for unacceptable material at 70 percent of the relevant contract unit price. The
 Department will calculate the quantity of material subject to reduce payment as the tons placed from the sample point of the failing
 moving average result and corresponding individual air void beyond the JMF limit to the sampling point when the individual test
 result is back within the JMF limit. If the failure occurs at the first test after the start of daily production, the Department will
 include tonnage from the start of production that day with the tonnage subjected to reduced payment.
 G.14.e Moving Average Failure at Mixture Start-Up — Adj. AFT
 The Engineer will calculate the Moving Average (n=4) Adj. AFT during the sixth test after the beginning of mixture
 production of that specific mixture. The Engineer will include the individual results of calculations for tests No. 3, No. 4, No. 5, and
 No. 6 with this calculation.

 will pay for unacceptable mixture at 70 percent of the contract unit price. The Department will calculate the quantity of mixture
 subject to reduced payment as the tons placed from the sample point of all individual test results beyond the JMF limits, which
 contributed to the moving average value that exceeded the JMF limit, to the sampling point where the individual test result meets
 the JMF limits. If the failure occurs at the first test after the start of daily production, the Department will include the tonnage from
 the start of production that day with the tonnage subject to reduced payment.

 G.14.g Moving Average Failure - Percent Asphalt Binder Content, Gradation, and Adj. AFT
 The Engineer will consider the mixture unacceptable and subject to reduced payment for mixture properties, including
 asphalt binder content and gradation, where the moving average of four exceeds the JMF limits. The Department may reduce
 payment for unacceptable mixture properties in accordance with Table 2360-18, “Reduced Payment Schedule for Moving Average
 Test Results.” The Department will calculate the quantity of material subject to replacement or reduced payment as the tons placed
 from the sample point of all individual test results beyond the JMF limits, which contributed to the moving average value that
 exceeded the JMF limit, to the sampling point when the individual test result is back within the JMF limits. If the failure occurs at
 the first test after the start of daily production, the Department will include the tonnage from the start of production that day with
 the tonnage subjected to reduced payment.
 The Engineer will calculate the Moving Average (n=4) Adjusted AFT during the sixth test after the beginning of mixture
 production of that specific mixture. The Engineer will include the individual results of calculations for tests No. 3, No. 4, No. 5, and
 No. 6 with this calculation. The Department will consider material with the Moving Average (n=4) of the Adjusted AFT is less than
 8.0 µ as unsatisfactory and will pay for the material at 80 percent of the relevant contract unit price. The Department will calculate
 the quantity of material subject to replacement or reduced payment as the tons placed from the sample point of all Individual
 Adjusted AFT results less than 8.0µ, which contributed to the Moving Average value that was less than 8.0µ, to the sample point
 where the Individual Adjusted AFT is at least 8.0µ. If the failure occurs at the first test after the start of daily production, the
 Department will include the tonnage from the start of production that day with the tonnage subject to reduced payment.
 G.14.h Coarse and Fine Aggregate Crushing Failure
 If any CAA or FAA test results do not meet the requirements specified in Table 3139-3, the Department may reduce
 payment for the placed material in accordance with Table 2360-16, “Reduced Payment Schedule for Individual Test Results.” The
 Department will calculate the quantity of material subject to reduced payment as the tons placed from the sample point of the
 failing test until the sampling point where the test result meets the specifications. If the failure occurs at the first test after the
 start of daily production, the Department will include the tonnage from the start of production that day with the tonnage subjected
 to reduced payment.

 B.2.a
 Paver
 Provide a paver capable of spreading and finishing to widths as shown on the plans and with an operational vibratory
 screed and automatic screed control to place mix without segregation.
 Use an asphalt paver to place the mixture. When necessary, the Contractor may use a motor grader, when approved by
 the Engineer, to spread mixtures in areas that are inaccessible to a paver or when the quantity of mixture makes it impractical to
 place with a paver.
 Use a shouldering machine to spread the mixture on shoulder surfacing and uniform width widening, when the placement
 width is too narrow for a paver.
 Using a screed or strike-off assembly, produce a finished surface of the required evenness and texture without tearing,
 shoving, or gouging. For mainline paving, if the paving width is greater than the basic screed, auger and mainframe extensions,
 which meet manufacturer’s recommendations for the paving width, are required unless otherwise directed by the Engineer. The
 Department will not allow strike-off only extension assemblies for mainline wearing course paving, unless the Engineer directs
 otherwise.
 Equip all pavers with an approved automatic screed control. Sensor-operated devices need to include automatic controls
 that follow reference lines, or surfaces on one or both sides of the paver as required. Adjust the speed of the paver to produce the
 best results. A string line is only required if stated in the contract.
 Spread all mixtures without segregation to the cross sections shown on the plans (excluding tight blade and scratch
 course applications). The objective on the leveling layer is to secure a smooth base of uniform grade and cross section so that
 subsequent courses will be uniform in thickness. The Contractor may spread the leveling layer with a properly equipped paver or,
 when approved by the Engineer, a motor grader equipped with a leveling device or with other means for controlling the surface
 elevation of the leveling layer.
 Place each course over the full width of the section under construction on each day's run, unless the Engineer directs
 otherwise.
 B.2.b

 B.2.e
 Rollers
 Compact each lift of asphalt to the density require in 2360.3.D, “Compaction.”
 B.2.e(1) Steel-Wheeled Rollers
 Self-propelled steel wheeled compacting equipment must weigh at least 8 ton. If using vibratory rollers, provide rollers
 that produce 3,085 lbf per ft of width and a vibratory frequency of at least 2,400 vpm using the low amplitude setting. Provide a
 roller capable of reversing without backlash and equipped with spray attachments for moistening rollers on both sets of wheels.
 B.2.e(2) Pneumatic Tired Rollers
 Self-propelled pneumatic tired compacting equipment must have a compaction width of at least 5 ft and a gross wheel
 load force of at least 3,000 lb per wheel for traffic level 2 and level 3 mixtures, 5,000 lb per wheel for traffic level 4 and level 5
 mixtures, and, if using vibratory, at least 8 ton total mass. Provide a roller with a tire arrangement that obtains full compaction
 over the full width with each pass of the roller.
 B.2.e(3) Trench Rollers
 Self-propelled trench rollers must weigh at least 2,960 lb per foot of width.
 B.3
 Tack Coat
 Apply a uniform asphalt tack coat to the clean and dry existing asphalt or concrete surface and to the surface of each
 course or lift constructed, except for the final course or lift, in accordance with 2357. Coat the contact surfaces of all fixed
 structures and the edge of the inplace mixture in all courses at transverse joints and in the wearing course at longitudinal joints.
 Do not coat the longitudinal joint if a rubberized asphalt joint adhesive will be applied to the vertical face of the joint. A uniform
 application will not have streaks (corn rows), bare spots, puddles, or other irregular patterns. Allow emulsified asphalt tack coats
 to break, as indicated by a color change from brown to black, before placing subsequent lifts. Take tack samples from the asphalt
 distributor according to rates provided in the Material Control Schedule. The Inspector will monitor the sampling the Contractor
 performs.
 C
 
 Joints
 
 C.1
 Construction Joints
 Compact joints to produce a neat, tightly bonded joint that meets surface tolerances as described in 2360.3.E.
 Transverse and longitudinal joints are subject to the density requirement in accordance with 2360.3.D, “Compaction.”
 C.2
 Transverse Joints
 Construct a transverse joint, the full width of the paver, at right angles to the centerline when mixture placement
 operations are suspended. When work resumes, cut the end vertically for the full depth of the layer unless constructing a formed
 edge as approved by the Engineer.
 C.3
 Longitudinal Joint
 Construct the longitudinal joint between strips and parallel to the pavement centerline. In multiple lift construction,
 construct the longitudinal joints between strips in each lift at least 6 in measured transversely from the longitudinal joints in the
 previously placed lift. If constructing a wearing course in an even number of strips, place one longitudinal joint on the centerline of
 the road. When constructing a wearing course in an odd number of strips, locate the centerline of one strip on the centerline of the
 road, provided that no joint is located in the wheel path area of a traffic lane. The Contractor will align longitudinal joints in
 multiple lift construction over portland cement concrete pavements directly over the concrete pavement longitudinal joints as
 approved by the Engineer.
 At longitudinal joints formed by placing multiple strips, ensure the adjoining surface is higher but does not exceed ⅛ in,
 after final compaction of the previously placed strip. When constructing a strip adjoining a previously placed strip or a concrete
 pavement, remove to the longitudinal joint line, any fresh mixture that overlaps a previously placed strip or pavement before rolling.
 D
 Compaction
 After spreading each course, compact in accordance with the maximum density method as described in 2360.3.D.1,
 unless the ordinary compaction method is called for in the special provisions or as described in 2360.3.D.2, “Ordinary Compaction.”
 Do not allow rollers to stand on the uncompacted mixture or newly rolled pavement with a surface temperature greater than
 140 °F. Do not roll with steel-wheeled rollers if rolling produces aggregate that is crushed, cracked, or pulverized or causes
 displacement of the mixture.
 To maintain a true surface, correct the following by removing and replacing the material in the defective areas as directed
 by the Engineer at no additional cost to the Department:
 (1)
 Variations such as depressions or high areas, which may develop during rolling operations; and
 (2)
 Lean, fat, or segregated areas.
 When spreading mixtures with a motor grader, compact the mixture with pneumatic tired rollers simultaneously with the
 spreading operation.

 D.1.a
 Shoulders Greater Than 6 ft
 Unless otherwise shown on the plans or required by the special provisions, compact shoulders wider than 6 ft paved using
 the maximum density method. When shoulders are compacted by the maximum density method and are paved separately from the
 driving lane, or have a different required minimum density than the driving lane, delineate the lot tonnage placed on the shoulder in
 separate lots from the driving lanes for the day paving was conducted.
 D.1.b
 Shoulders Equal to or Less Than 6 ft
 Unless otherwise shown on the plans or required by the special provisions, use the ordinary compaction method in
 accordance with 2360.3.D.2 to compact a narrow shoulder no wider than 6 ft paved in the same pass as a driving lane or paved
 separately. The Department will exclude mixture compacted under ordinary compaction from lot density requirements and from
 incentive or disincentive payment.
 When compacting a narrow shoulder using the maximum density method, compact to densities in accordance with
 Table 2360-19. If the minimum required density of the shoulder is different than the driving lane, delineate the tonnage placed on
 the shoulder in separate lots from the driving lane.
 D.1.c
 Echelon Paving
 The Department considers echelon paving, two pavers running next to each other in adjacent lanes, as separate
 operations.
 D.1.d
 Density Determination (Core Bulk Density)
 Calculate each individual lot’s maximum density by averaging the results of the cores within the lot expressed as the
 percentage of the maximum specific gravity. Use Laboratory Test Method 1810 to determine core density unless the mixture is
 considered coarse graded. If 45 percent or less of the aggregate material passes the No. 4 sieve the Engineer may require bulk
 specific gravity be determined in accordance with Laboratory Manual Method 1816, Corelok.
 Obtain the maximum specific gravity value for calculating the percentage density for the lot from the maximum gravity
 values taken from production tests during that day’s paving. If the production tests during that day’s paving result in only one or
 two maximum specific gravity values, use the moving average value at that test point. If production tests during that day’s paving
 result in three or more maximum specific gravity values, use the average of those tests alone as indicated above.

 deficient densities.
 D.1.f
 Stop Production
 If all the lots in a day’s production or greater than 50 percent of the lots on multiple days fail to meet the minimum
 density requirement stop production and determine the source of the problem. Discuss with the Engineer what corrective action
 will be taken to bring the work into compliance with specified minimum required density.

 D.1.h
 Mat Density Cores
 Obtain four cores in each lot. Take two cores from random locations as directed by the Engineer. Take the third and
 fourth cores, the companion cores, within 1 ft longitudinally from the first two cores. Submit the companion cores to the Engineer
 immediately after coring and sawing. If the random core location falls on a longitudinal joint, cut the core with the outer edge of
 the core barrel 1 ft away laterally from the edge of the top of the mat. Do not take cores for compacted mat density within 1 ft of
 any longitudinal joint. The Contractor is responsible for maintaining traffic, coring, patching the core holes, and sawing the cores to
 the paved lift thickness before density testing.
 The Engineer may require additional density lots to isolate areas affected by equipment malfunction, heavy rain, or other
 factors affecting normal compaction operations.
 D.1.i
 Contractor Core Testing
 Take and test cores at least 4 in in diameter at locations determined and marked by the Engineer.
 Mark samples with the lot number and core number or letter. Transport the cores to the laboratory daily taking care to
 prevent damage to them. Schedule the approximate time of testing during normal project work hours to allow the Engineer to
 observe the test and to record the saturated surface dry and immersed weight of the cores.
 Determine the density by the end of the next working day after compaction. Measure each core three times for thickness
 before saw cutting. Report the average lift thickness on the core sheet. If placing multiple layers in a single day, saw and separate
 cores for each layer, test, and report by the end of the next working day. Place and compact mix into the coring hole to restore the
 surface within 24 h after coring or the Department will fine the Contractor $100 per working day per lot until restored.
 D.1.j
 Companion Core Testing
 The Department will select at least one of the two companion cores per lot to test for verification. For lots designated as
 longitudinal joint density lots, the Department will test at least one of the mat density companion cores and at least one of the
 longitudinal joint density companion cores.
 D.1.k
 
 Tolerance Comparison
 
 D.1.k(1) Tolerance Comparison – Individual
 Compare the individual core bulk specific gravities obtained by the Contractor and by the Department. If the bulk specific
 gravity between the Contractor and the Department cores differ by more than 0.030, use the Department’s bulk specific gravity.
 D.1.k(2) Tolerance Comparison – Day’s Shrinking Tolerance
 For a second comparison of the cores that pass the individual tolerance criteria, compare the average of the Contractor’s
 bulk specific gravities with the average of the Department’s bulk specific gravities. Determine the tolerance by dividing 0.030 by
 the square root of the number of samples compared. Use all the Department’s results for the day’s paving if the cores do not fall
 within the determined tolerance.

 Recoring
 The Engineer may allow the Contractor to re-core a sample if the sample was damaged in the coring process or damaged
 in transit to the laboratory through no fault of the Contractor.
 D.1.m
 Waiving Maximum Density (One Percent Reduced Density)
 The Contractor may elect to waive the maximum density requirement and reevaluate the density in accordance with one
 percent reduced density requirement, Table 2360-19, “Required Minimum Lot Density (Mat)”. The Department will exclude
 incentive payments for reduced minimum density in accordance with Table 2360-19, “Required Minimum Lot Density (Mat).” The
 Contractor may elect to waive the reduced density requirement and reevaluate the density in accordance with Table 2360-23, “1
 Percent Reduced Table”. The Contractor must notify the Engineer, in writing, by the end of the third day of paving of their intent to
 waive maximim density. Once maximum density has been waived the reduced density will remain in effect for the duration of
 mixture placement on that lift. For multi-year projects, the waiving of maximum density will be for that year only and will be reevaluated for subsequent years on an annual basis. The Contractor is required to comply with any construction requirements on
 subsequent lifts. One percent reduced density is required for the first lift constructed over PCC pavements.
 D.1.n
 Longitudinal Joint Density
 Evaluate longitudinal joint density in one lot per day unless the total daily weight is greater than 5,000 ton. If the total
 daily weight is greater than 5,000 ton, evaluate two lots per day. Randomly select the location to take cores for longitudinal joint
 density from the mat density core locations. Take six cores at this location. Take cores for longitudinal joint density with the outer
 edge of the core barrel within 6 in from the edge of the top of the mat for both sides of the mat. Take a companion core 1 ft
 [0.3 m] longitudinally from each core. Take two cores for mat density at either 2 ft right or 2 ft left of the center of the mat the
 Contractor is paving, regardless of random number generation.
 D.1.o
 Imaginary Joint
 An actual longitudinal joint will not exist if pulling the shoulder and driving lane in the same paving pass. Do not cut a
 core on the imaginary line where a joint would have existed had the shoulder and the drive lane been paved separately.
 D.1.p
 Shoulders
 D.1.p(1) Shoulder – Ordinary Compaction
 If compacting the shoulder under the ordinary density specification, do not take longitudinal joint cores in shoulders.
 Core at the centerline longitudinal edge cores (6 in from the joint) and at the mat density cores (2 ft right or left of the center of
 the paving pass).
 D.1.p(2) Shoulder-Maximum Density Specification
 Core at the following locations:
 (1)

 * Calculate the percent of maximum specific gravity to the nearest tenth.
 ║ Payment will only apply if the day's weighted average individual production air voids fall within - ½ percent of the target
 air void value. Base the weighted average air voids on all the mixture production tests in accordance with 2360.2.G.7,
 “Production Tests” for the corresponding day and weight by the tons the corresponding test represents.
 † The Department will pay for the HMA material represented by the lot at 70 percent of the relevant contract unit price;
 unless a single core density in the lot is less than 87.0 percent of the maximum specific gravity (Gmm). If a single core
 density is less than 87.0 percent of Gmm, the Engineer will decide if the mixture is subject to removal and replacement or
 if will be accepted at a reduced payment of 50 percent of the relevant contract unit price. If the Engineer decides the
 material is to be removed and replaced, the Contractor will do so at no additional cost to the Department. Take additional
 core samples to determine the limits of the removal and replacement area or 50% payment using the same offset from
 centerline as the original core. If the original low density core was taken within 1½ ft of an edge of the paver pass, take
 the additional cores at 1½ ft from the edge of the paver pass. Determine the densities at 50 ft intervals both ahead and
 behind the point of unacceptable core density until finding a point of acceptable core density (>89.0% for 4% void and
 1% reduced voids and >90.0% for 3% voids). If the 50 ft incremental testing extends into a previously accepted lot,
 removal and replacement may be required, but, these results will not be used to recalculate the previously accepted lot
 density.
 Perform the additional coring and testing at no cost to the Department. The Department will calculate the area of
 unacceptable pavement as the product of the longitudinal limits as determined by the 50 ft cores and the full width of the
 paver pass, laying in the traffic lane or lanes. The Department will exempt shoulders from this calculation unless density
 failure occurred in the shoulder area.
 Establish an additional density lot for the pavement that has been removed and replaced. Cut 2 cores randomly with
 companions for the Department (total 4 cores) and determine average density. Make payment in accordance with
 Table 2360-22 or Table 2360-23 excluding any incentive payment.
 Determine the density for the remainder of the lot by averaging the original acceptable core density value with the first
 two acceptable core densities taken ahead and behind the unacceptable core density. Make payment in accordance with
 Table 2360-22 or Table 2360-23 excluding any incentive payment.

 * Reduce the minimum by 1 percent for the first lift constructed on aggregate base (mainline and shoulder), reclaimed or
 cold inplace recycled base courses and first lift of an overlay on a roadway with a spring load restriction (including
 shoulders) no greater than 7 ton. Reduce the minimum by 1 percent on the first lift constructed on PCC pavements
 (reduced density cannot be waived on PCC).
 ║ Calculate the percent of maximum specific gravity to the nearest tenth.
 † The Department will pay for the HMA material represented by the lot at 70 percent of the relevant contract unit price;
 unless a single core density in the lot is less than 87.0 percent of the maximum specific gravity (Gmm). If a single core
 density is less than 87.0 percent of Gmm, the Engineer will decide if the mixture is subject to removal and replacement or
 if will be accepted at a reduced payment of 50 percent of the relevant contract unit price. If the Engineer decides the
 material is to be removed and replaced, the Contractor will do so at no additional cost to the Department. Take additional
 core samples to determine the limits of the removal and replacement area or 50% payment using the same offset from
 centerline as the original core. If the original low density core was taken within 1½ ft of an edge of the paver pass, take
 the additional cores at 1½ ft from the edge of the paver pass. Determine the densities at 50 ft intervals both ahead and
 behind the point of unacceptable core density until finding a point of acceptable core density (>89.0% for 4% void and
 1% reduced voids and >90.0% for 3% voids). If the 50 ft incremental testing extends into a previously accepted lot,
 removal and replacement may be required, but, these results will not be used to recalculate the previously accepted lot
 density. Perform the additional coring and testing at no cost to the Department. The Department will calculate the area
 of unacceptable pavement as the product of the longitudinal limits as determined by the 50 ft cores and the full width of
 the paver pass, laying in the traffic lane or lanes. The Department will exempt shoulders from this calculation unless
 density failure occurred in the shoulder area.
 Establish an additional density lot for the pavement that has been removed and replaced. Cut 2 cores randomly with
 companions for the Department (total 4 cores) and determine average density. Make payment in accordance with
 Table 2360-22 or Table 2360-23 excluding any incentive payment.
 Determine the density for the remainder of the lot by averaging the original acceptable core density value with the first
 two acceptable core densities taken ahead and behind the unacceptable core density. Make payment in accordance with
 Table 2360-22 or Table 2360-23 excluding any incentive payment.

 Pay Factor Determination
 Determine the pay factor in accordance with the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 Case 1: Total Pay Factor = (Pay Factor A) × (Pay Factor B) × (Pay Factor C)
 Case 2: Total Pay Factor = (Pay Factor A) × (Pay Factor B) × (Pay Factor B)
 Case 3: Total Pay Factor = (Pay Factor A) × (Pay Factor C) × (Pay Factor C)
 
 Where:
 Pay Factor A = Mat density,
 Pay Factor B = Confined edge density,
 Pay Factor C = Unsupported edge density.
 Use a pay factor of 1.00 for Pay Factor B, Pay Factor C, or both in lots where no cores are taken at the longitudinal joint.

 Ordinary Compaction
 Perform ordinary compaction for the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 (5)
 (6)
 (7)
 
 Layers identified in the typical sections with a minimum planned thickness less than 1½ in [40 mm],
 Thin lift leveling,
 Wedging layers,
 Patching layers,
 Driveways, and
 Areas the Contractor cannot compact with standard highway construction equipment and practices.
 Bike paths, walking paths, and other similar non-traffic paving areas
 
 If using the ordinary compaction method to evaluate density, use a control strip to establish a rolling pattern. Use the
 rolling pattern to compact the asphalt mixture for the layer on which the control strip is constructed or until constructing a new
 control strip. The Engineer may waive the control strip requirement in small localized areas or other areas not conducive to its
 establishment.
 D.2.a
 Control Strip
 Construct a control strip at least 395 sq. yd and of the same thickness as the lift the control strip represents at the
 beginning of the work on each lift of each course. Begin compacting immediately after spreading the mixture. Continue
 compacting until additional roller coverage does not produce appreciable increase in density. Determine densities by means of a
 portable nuclear testing device or approved alternate and create a growth curve to determine the optimum rolling pattern. Provide
 documentation of the growth curve to the Engineer. Roll the remainder of that course in accordance with the pattern developed in
 the test strip for that roller. Provide a new control strip in accordance with the following:

 Equipment
 Use rollers that meet the requirements in 2360.3.B.2.e. Use the same equipment type and weight on the remainder of
 the pavement course that was used to construct the control strip. Provide at least two rollers. Provide a tandem steel wheeled
 roller for final rolling. The Contractor may use trench rollers or mechanical tampers to compact areas inaccessible to the
 conventional type rolling equipment.
 D.2.c
 Mixture Temperature
 Refer to Table 2360-26, “Minimum Temperature Control” for the minimum laydown temperatures in all courses of the

 D.3
 Mat Density Cores (Optional Department Only Core Testing)
 The Contractor can request all density cores be tested by the Department. The written request should be made at the
 pre-construction meeting and a written response, from the Department, either approving or denying the request will be made
 within 5 calendar days from the date of the request. Once approval is granted, Department Only Core Testing will remain in effect
 for the duration of the project. For multi-year projects, Department core testing will be for that year only. Cores will be tested in
 either the Department’s Field Lab or in the Contractor’s Field Lab. The Contractor is permitted to observe and record all weighing of
 the cores.
 D.3.a
 Contractor Coring Responsibilities
 Obtain two cores in each lot. Take cores of at least 4 in in diameter at locations determined and marked by the Engineer.
 If the random core location falls on a longitudinal joint, cut the core with the outer edge of the core barrel 1 ft away laterally from
 the edge of the top of the mat. Do not take cores for compacted mat density within 1 ft of any longitudinal joint. Label samples
 with the lot number and core number or letter. The Contractor is responsible for maintaining traffic, coring, patching the core
 holes.
 Measure each core three times for thickness before saw cutting. Report the average lift thickness to the Engineer. If
 placing multiple layers in a single day, measure and record lift thickness and then saw and separate cores for each layer. Place and
 compact mix into the coring hole to restore the surface within 24 h after coring or the Department will fine the Contractor $100 per
 working day per lot until restored.
 The Engineer may require additional density lots to isolate areas affected by equipment malfunction, heavy rain, or other
 factors affecting normal compaction operations.
 D.3.b
 Department Testing Responsibilities
 The Department will take possession of the cores after they have been measured and cut. The Department will test all
 cores. Density results will be determined by the end day in which the cores were cut provided they are in the Department’s
 possession by 10:00am, otherwise, results will be available the next working day. Test results will be reported on the Core Density
 Sheet.
 D.3.c
 Longitudinal Joint Density
 Evaluate longitudinal joint density in one lot per day unless the total daily weight is greater than 5,000 ton. If the total
 daily weight is greater than 5,000 ton, evaluate two lots per day. Randomly select the location to take cores for longitudinal joint
 density from the mat density core locations. Take three cores at this location. Take cores for longitudinal joint density with the
 outer edge of the core barrel within 6 in from the edge of the top of the mat for both sides of the mat. Take one core for mat
 density at either 2 ft right or 2 ft left of the center of the mat the Contractor is paving, regardless of random number generation.

 Cut or saw and then remove and replace material placed outside the described limitations at no additional cost to the
 Department. If the Engineer determines the material can remain in place outside the limits, the Department will pay for the
 material at a reduced cost of $10 per sq. yd. The Department will consider any single occurrence of material outside the limitations
 to have a minimum dimension of at least 1 sq. yd in any dimension.
 The requirements of 2360.3.E are in addition to 2399 (Pavement Surface Smoothness) if specified in the Contract. When 2399 is
 required in Special Provisions but no pavement smoothness equation is specified evaluate using equation HMA-B.
 E.1
 Lift Thickness
 After compaction, the thickness of each lift shall be within a tolerance of ¼in of the thickness shown on the plans, except
 that, if automatic grade controls are used, this thickness requirement will not apply to the first lift placed. This thickness
 requirement will not apply to a leveling lift whether or not automatic grade controls are required. The Engineer may require
 removal and replacement of any part of any lift that is constructed to less than the minimum required thickness, at no additional
 cost to the Department.
 Measure cores taken for density determination for thickness also. Measure each core three times for thickness before
 sawing. Report the average of these three measurements. Document each lot's average core thickness and submit to the
 Engineer. If the average of the two Contractor cores exceed the specified tolerance, an additional two cores may be taken in the
 lot in question. The Engineer will use the average of all core thickness measurements per day per lift to determine daily compliance
 with thickness specifications.
 On that portion of any lift constructed to more than the maximum permissible thickness, the materials used in the excess
 mixture above that required to construct that portion of the lift to the plan thickness plus ¼ in may be excluded from the pay
 quantities or at the discretion of the Engineer and at the Contractor's expense may be required to be removed and replaced.

 and 2360.2.G.14.h, “Coarse and Fine Aggregate Crushing Failure.”
 2360.4 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 When paying for material by weight, the Engineer will measure separately asphalt mixture of each type by weight based
 on the total quantity of material hauled from the mixing plant. The Engineer will not make deductions for the asphalt materials.
 When paying for material by area, the Engineer will separately measure asphalt mixture of each type and for each
 specific lift by area and by thickness on the basis of actual final dimensions placed.
 2360.5 BASIS OF PAYMENT
 The contract unit price for asphalt mixture used in each course includes the cost of constructing the asphalt surfacing and
 providing and incorporating asphalt binder, mineral filler, hydrated lime. Anti-stripping additives may be permitted or required as

 Mixing and Compaction Temperature. Use binder supplier recommended temperatures. Unless authorized by
 the Engineer, do not produce the mixture no more than 30°F above the recommended maximum mixing
 temperature. The Department will not pay for or allow placement of any mixture produced at more than 30°F
 above the recommended maximum mixing temperature.
 Rutting of Existing Surface. Equipment used to deliver or place the mixture cannot rut the inplace aggregate
 base (filter) layer or subgrade, or tear or displace the geotextile if used. Any ruts formed must be repaired and
 leveled to satisfaction of the engineer, at no cost to the agency, prior to placing the mixture so that water
 draining through the mixture will not pond and create soft spots in the base/subgrade.
 
 B.
 Surface Preparation.
 Remove loose or deteriorated surfacing and clean the surface by power sweeping and air blasting. Removal of
 deteriorated areas from joints, cracks, bituminous patched areas, etc. may require air blasting, the use of a small milling machine,
 or handwork as directed by the Engineer. Air blasting must performed with at least 100 psi equipment.
 C.
 Maintenance.
 The contractor is responsible to maintain the integrity of the PASSRC or PASB until the concrete or bituminous pavement
 is placed on it. Any deficiencies in thickness, smoothness, or density need to be corrected.
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 Contamination. Keep the PASSRC and PASB and associated drains free of soils or other contaminates.
 Contaminated material shall be removed and replaced by the Contractor to the satisfaction of the Engineer at
 no cost to the Department.
 Drainage. Maintain drainage so water is not allowed to pond in the PASSRC or PASB.
 Construction Equipment. Concrete hauling units, either loaded or empty are permitted on the PASSRC. Only
 the paver, rollers, and bituminous haul trucks are only allowed to drive on the PASB. The bituminous haul

 2363.3
 trucks can only drive on the PASB immediately in front of the paver to unload, and then leave the PASB as soon
 as the bituminous is unloaded.
 Density. PASSRC and PASB need to be dense and stable after construction so it will not rut when the overlying
 pavement is placed.
 Damage. The contractor will repair the PASB or PASSRC promptly by the Contractor, as directed by the
 engineer, at no expense to the Agency.

 G.4
 Initial SMA Test Strip Verification
 Do not begin full-scale production of the SMA mixture until it is shown, in a test strip, that the mixture can be produced,
 placed, and compacted to the requirements of this specification. Limit the test strip to 500 tons with a minimum requirement of
 200 tons placed at the specified thickness and width indicated in the contract. During construction of the test strip take a minimum
 of 2 mixture samples to determine mixture properties as shown in the Production Start-Up Testing Rate table shown above. Take
 one sample within the first 100 tons of mixture produced and the other randomly within the remaining mixture produced. After
 both samples are obtained cease production of the SMA until mixture properties are tested and evaluated by both the Contractor
 and the Department. Resume production when:
 1)
 2)
 3)
 4)
 
 The Contractor’s and the Department’s test results are within the allowable testing tolerances shown in Table 23657, and
 Each of the Contractor’s test results are within the JMF limits as indicated on the Mixture Design Report, and
 The average of the two Contractor test results meets the requirements shown in the table for SMA mixture
 requirements, and
 The average of two cores from the roadway meets the minimum density requirement as specified in this provision.
 One core shall be taken at random in the area representative of where the first mixture sample was obtained.
 The other core shall be taken at random in the area representative of the second mixture sample.
 
 If the material in the test strip does not meet the requirements listed above another test strip will be required. With the
 approval of the Engineer, the test strip may be placed within the project limits. A final MDR will be issued once the test strip meets
 specification requirements.

 Communicate Department test results to the Contractor’s personnel on a daily basis, and
 Ensure Independent Assurance (IA) sampling and testing requirements are met.
 
 H.4
 Verification Sample
 The Department will test a verification sample to assure compliance of the Contractor's QC program. The Department will
 provide the Contractor a verification companion, which is defined as a companion sample to the verification sample MnDOT uses.
 Take all verification samples from the truck box at the plant site. Test and use this verification companion sample as part of the QC
 program. Use the verification companion sample to replace the next scheduled QC sample. The Department recommends sampling
 enough material to accommodate retesting in case the samples fail.
 Perform verification testing on at least one set of production tests daily to verify the requirements of Table 2365-1, “Stone
 Matrix Aggregate Gradation Broad Bands”, Table 2365-2, “Stone Matrix Asphalt Pavement Mixture Aggregate Requirements”, and
 Table 2365-5, “Stone Matrix Asphalt Mixture Requirements”. Compare the verification companion sample to the verification sample
 for compliance with allowable tolerances in Table 2365-7. The Department will consider the verification process complete if the
 Contractor’s verification companion meets the tolerances in Table 2365-7.
 If the tolerances between the Contractor’s verification companion and the Department’s verification sample do not meet
 the requirements of Table 2365-7, the Department will retest the material. If the retests fail to meet tolerances, the Department will
 substitute the Department's verification test results for the Contractor’s results in the QC program and use those results for acceptance.

 The mixture production targets and JMF limits are listed on the Mixture Design Report. JMF limits are used as the criteria
 for acceptance of materials based on individual (single) test results. Gradation JMF limits are not allowed outside the broadband
 requirements in Table 2365-1, “Stone Matrix Asphalt Aggregate Gradation Broad Bands”.
 M.1
 Moving Average Calculation
 Calculate a moving average as the average of the last four test results. Continue the calculation without interruption,
 except begin new summary sheets and charts annually for winter carry-over projects and if an asphalt plant is re-setup in the same
 site after it has been moved out.
 M.2
 JMF Bands
 JMF Bands are the area between the target, as identified on the Mixture Design Report, and the JMF limits.
 N
 JMF Adjustment
 Begin mixture production with materials within 5 percent of the design proportions and other mixture parameters within
 the JMF limits in accordance with Table 2365-10, “Stone Matrix Asphalt JMF Limits” for gradation, asphalt content, and aggregate
 proportions meeting the requirements of the reviewed Mixture Design Report. Use all aggregate proportions meeting the
 requirements of the Mixture Design Report unless the aggregate proportion is 0 percent.
 O
 JMF Request for Adjustment
 Make a request to the Bituminous Engineer or District Materials Engineer for a JMF adjustment to the mix design if the QC
 test results indicate a necessary change to achieve the specified properties. Do not use aggregates or materials not part of the
 original mix design to make adjustments unless otherwise approved by the Engineer, in conjunction with the District Materials
 Engineer or the Department Bituminous Engineer.
 A Certified Level II Bituminous QM Mix Designer will review the requested change for the Department. If the request
 meets the design requirements in Table 2365-1,” Stone Matrix Asphalt Pavement Aggregate Gradation Broad Bands”, Table 23652,” Stone Matrix Asphalt Pavement Mixture Aggregate Requirements”, and Table 2365-5, “Stone Matrix Asphalt Pavement Mixture
 Requirements,” the Department will issue a revised Mixture Design Report.
 Use an interactive communication process with the Engineer before making JMF adjustments. Make JMF adjustments
 only within the mixture specification gradation design broadbands in accordance with Table 2365-1, “Stone Matrix Asphalt
 Pavement Aggregate Gradation Broad Bands”. Submit a new JMF if redesigning the mixture.
 The department will not allow consecutive requests for a JMF adjustment without production data.

 Failing Materials – Gradation, Coarse Aggregate Angularity, Air Voids, VMA, and Percent Asphalt
 
 Material acceptance is based on individual and moving average test results. Use isolated test results for acceptance of air
 voids and VMA at the start of mixture production. The Department will consider individual test results greater than two times the
 JMF bands as failing. The Department will fail moving average test results exceeding the JMF limits.
 Stop production and make adjustments if the moving average values exceed the JMF limits. Restart production after
 performing the adjustments and notifying the Engineer. Resume testing at the accelerated rates and for the tests listed in
 Table 2365-8, “Production Start-Up Testing Rates,” for the next 2,000 ton of mixture produced. Continue calculating the moving
 average after the stop in production.
 The Department will consider mixture produced where the moving average of four exceeds the JMF limits as
 unsatisfactory in accordance with 2365.2.G.14.d, “Moving Average Failure at Mixture Start-Up – Production Air Voids,”
 2365.2.G.14.e, “Moving Average Failure at Mixture Start-Up — Adjusted AFT,” 2365.2.G.14.f, “Moving Average Failure - Production

 P.1
 Isolated Failures at Mixture Start-Up – Production Air Voids
 At the start-up of mixture production, use the first three isolated test results for production air voids before establishing a
 moving average of four. Calculate isolated production air voids using the maximum mixture specific gravity and the corresponding
 bulk specific gravity from that single test. After testing four samples and establishing a moving average of four, the Department will
 base acceptance on individual and moving average production air voids.
 The Department will not accept the material if any of the first three isolated test results for production air voids exceeds
 twice the JMF bands from the target listed on the Mixture Design Report at the start of production. The Department will reduce
 payment for unacceptable material in accordance with Table 2365-16, “Reduced Payment Schedule for Individual Test Results.”
 The Department will calculate the quantity of unacceptable material on the tonnage placed from the sample point of the failing test
 to the sample point when the isolated test result is back within twice the JMF bands. If the failure occurs at the first test after the
 start of production, the Department will calculate the tonnage subject to reduced payment as described above, including the
 tonnage from the start of production.
 If isolated air voids are less than 1.0 percent or greater than 7.0 percent, the Engineer will either reduce the payment or
 order the material removed and replaced at no additional cost to the Department. The Engineer may require the Contractor to test
 in-place mixture to better define the removal and replacement limits. The Engineer may require the Contractor to test in-place
 mixture placed before the failing test result. If the Engineer reduces the payment, the Department will pay for the material at
 50 percent of the contract unit price.

 tests after mixture production start-up.
 P.3
 Individual Failure at Mixture Start-Up– VMA
 At the start-up of mixture production, before a moving average of four can be established, the first three (3) individual
 test results for VMA will be used for acceptance. After 4 samples have been tested and a moving average of four can be
 established, acceptance will be based on individual and moving average VMA.
 If, at the start of production, any of the first three (3) individual VMA test results exceeds twice the JMF bands from the
 target listed on the Mixture Design Report, the material is considered unsatisfactory or unacceptable. Reduced payment as outlined
 in Table 2365-11 shall apply to all tonnage placed from the sample point of the failing test until the sample point when the test
 results are back within twice the JMF limits. When the failure occurs at the first test, after the start of production, the tonnage
 subjected to reduce payment shall be calculated as described above and shall include the tonnage from the start of production.
 P.4
 Moving Average Failure at Mixture Start-Up – Production Air Voids
 If a moving average failure occurs within any of the first three moving average results after mixture start-up (tests 4, 5,
 6), the Department will accept the mixture if the individual air void, corresponding to the moving average failure meets the JMF
 limits. The Department will not accept material if the individual air void fails to meet the JMF limit. The Department will reduce
 payment for unacceptable material unless the Engineer determines that the isolated air void corresponding to the individual air void
 meets the JMF limit. The Department will pay for unacceptable material at 70 percent of the relevant contract unit price. The
 Department will calculate the quantity of material subject to reduce payment as the tons placed from the sample point of the failing
 moving average result and corresponding individual air void beyond the JMF limit to the sampling point when the individual test
 result is back within the JMF limit. If the failure occurs at the first test after the start of daily production, the Department will
 include tonnage from the start of production that day with the tonnage subjected to reduced payment.
 P.5
 Moving Average Failure at Mixture Start-Up – VMA
 When a moving average failure occurs within any of the first 3 moving average results after mixture start-up (tests 4, 5,
 6), the mixture will be considered acceptable if the individual VMA, corresponding to the moving average failure is within the JMF
 limits. If the individual VMA is not within the JMF limit, the mixture will be considered unacceptable and the Engineer will decide
 whether the mixture is subject to removal and replacement or reduced payment. If the mixture is to be removed and replaced, the
 Contractor at his expense will perform the work. Reduced payment will be 75 percent of the Contract bid price. Tonnage subjected
 to replacement or reduced payment shall be calculated as the tons placed from the sample point of the failing moving average

 Moving Average Failure – Production Air Voids
 A moving average production air void failure occurs when the individual production air void moving average of four
 exceeds the JMF limit. The Department will consider the mixture unacceptable and subject to reduced payment. The Department
 will pay for unacceptable mixture at 70 percent of the contract unit price. The Department will calculate the quantity of mixture
 subject to reduced payment as the tons placed from the sample point of all individual test results beyond the JMF limits, which
 contributed to the moving average value that exceeded the JMF limit, to the sampling point where the individual test result meets
 the JMF limits. If the failure occurs at the first test after the start of daily production, the Department will include the tonnage from
 the start of production that day with the tonnage subject to reduced payment.

 Moving Average Failure – Percent Asphalt Binder Content, VMA, and Gradation
 For mixture properties including asphalt binder content, VMA, and gradation, where the moving average of four exceeds
 the JMF limits, the mixture is considered unacceptable and the Engineer will decide whether the mixture is subject to removal and
 replacement or reduced payment. If the mixture is to be removed and replaced, the Contractor at his expense will perform the
 work. Reduced payment, percent of the Contract bid price, is shown in Table 2365-12. Tonnage subjected to replacement or
 reduced payment is calculated as the tons placed from the sample point of all individual test results beyond the JMF limits which
 contributed to the moving average value that exceeded the JMF limit, to the sampling point when the individual test result is back
 within the JMF limits. When the failure occurs at the first test after the start of daily production, tonnage subjected to reduced
 payment shall include the tonnage from the start of production that day.

 Coarse Aggregate Crushing Failure
 If any CAA test results do not meet the requirements specified in Table 2365-1, the Department may reduce payment for
 the placed material in accordance with Table 2365-11, “Reduced Payment Schedule for Individual Test Results.” The Department
 will calculate the quantity of material subject to reduced payment as the tons placed from the sample point of the failing test until
 the sampling point where the test result meets the specifications. If the failure occurs at the first test after the start of daily
 production, the Department will include the tonnage from the start of production that day with the tonnage subjected to reduced
 payment.

 Mat Density Cores
 Obtain four cores in each lot. Take two cores from random locations as directed by the Engineer. Take the third and
 fourth cores, the companion cores, within 1 ft longitudinally from the first two cores. Submit the companion cores to the Engineer
 immediately after coring and sawing. If the random core location falls on a longitudinal joint, cut the core with the outer edge of
 the core barrel 1 ft away laterally from the edge of the top of the mat. Do not take cores for compacted mat density within 1 ft of
 any longitudinal joint. The Contractor is responsible for maintaining traffic, coring, patching the core holes, and sawing the cores to
 the paved lift thickness before density testing.
 The Engineer may require additional density lots to isolate areas affected by equipment malfunction, heavy rain, or other
 factors affecting normal compaction operations.
 E.1.f
 Contractor Core Testing
 Take and test cores at least 4 in in diameter at locations determined and marked by the Engineer.
 Mark samples with the lot number and core number or letter. Transport the cores to the laboratory daily taking care to
 prevent damage to them. Schedule the approximate time of testing during normal project work hours to allow the Engineer to
 observe the test and to record the corelok testing of the cores.
 Determine the density by the end of the next working day after compaction. Measure each core three times for thickness
 before saw cutting. Report the average lift thickness on the core sheet. If placing multiple layers in a single day, saw and separate
 cores for each layer, test, and report by the end of the next working day. Place and compact mix into the coring hole to restore the
 surface within 24 h after coring or the Department will fine the Contractor $100 per working day per lot until restored.

 Tolerance Comparison
 
 E.1.h(1) Tolerance Comparison – Individual
 Compare the individual core bulk specific gravities obtained by the Contractor and by the Department. If the bulk specific
 gravity between the Contractor and the Department cores differ by more than 0.030, use the Department’s bulk specific gravity.
 E.1.h(2) Tolerance Comparison – Day’s Shrinking Tolerance
 For a second comparison of the cores that pass the individual tolerance criteria, compare the average of the Contractor’s
 bulk specific gravities with the average of the Department’s bulk specific gravities. Determine the tolerance by dividing 0.030 by
 the square root of the number of samples compared. Use all the Department’s results for the day’s paving if the cores do not fall
 within the determined tolerance.

 with thickness specifications.
 On that portion of any lift constructed to more than the maximum permissible thickness, the materials used in the excess
 mixture above that required to construct that portion of the lift to the plan thickness plus ¼ in may be excluded from the pay
 quantities or at the discretion of the Engineer and at the Contractor's expense may be required to be removed and replaced.
 2365.4 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 When paying for material by weight, the Engineer will measure separately asphalt mixture of each type by weight based on the
 total quantity of material hauled from the mixing plant. The Engineer will not make deductions for the asphalt materials.
 2365.5 BASIS OF PAYMENT
 The contract unit price for asphalt mixture used in each course includes the cost of constructing the asphalt surfacing and
 providing and incorporating asphalt binder, mineral filler, and asphalt stabilizer.
 The Department will pay for additives required by the contract at the relevant contract unit price for the mixture. The
 Department will pay for additives incorporated as directed by the Engineer as extra work in accordance with 1402.5, “Extra Work.”
 If the plans do not show a contract pay item for shoulder surfacing and other special construction, the Department will
 include payment for the quantities of material used for these purposes in the payment for the wearing course materials.
 Complete yield checks and monitor thickness determinations to construct the work as shown on the plans. Use the
 tolerances for lift thickness in accordance with Table 2365-16, “Surface Requirements” and surface smoothness requirements in
 accordance with 2399 for occasional variations and not for continuous over-running or under-running, unless otherwise required by
 the Engineer.

 4.
 5.
 
 Randomly select three test points in the control strip and use a nuclear density device (ASTM D2950, in back-scatter
 mode) to determine a wet density at each point after each finish (steel) roller pass.
 Ensure that that the nuclear gauge rests on a flat surface. The density at each point is defined as the average of
 two readings offset 180 degrees.
 Continue compacting until additional roller coverage does not produce an appreciable increase in density. Provide
 documentation of the growth curve and maximum target density to the Engineer. Use the target density for the
 QC/QA process.
 Roll the remainder of that course in accordance with the pattern developed in the control strip for that roller.
 Discontinue and reevaluate the rolling operation (pattern and timing), if surface cracking or checking occurs.
 
 Use this rolling pattern until a new control strip is performed.
 Establish a new rolling pattern by performing a new control strip when there are changes in the CIR/CCPR mixture that
 cause the original control strip to no longer be representative; changes may include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In-place materials variation, including sections with varying thickness, construction history, etc.

 2401.3 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 A
 General
 Refer to 2402, “Steel Bridge Construction,” 2404, “Concrete Wearing Course for Bridges,” 2451, “Structure Excavations
 and Backfills,” 2452, “Piling,” 2471, “Structural Metals,” and 2472, “Metal Reinforcement,” for constructing bridges.
 B
 Falsework and Forms
 Use forms for concrete except portions of footings that extend into solid rock. Do not cast concrete against the side of an
 earth excavation instead of forming. If the special provisions allow driving the sheets along the neat line of a footing, the
 Contractor may use cofferdam sheets as forms for footings.
 B.1
 
 Material Requirements, with Allowable Stresses or Loads
 
 B.1.a
 Falsework Piling
 Calculate safe pile-bearing capacities in accordance with 2452, “Piling.”
 B.1.b
 Structural Shapes and Fabricated Assemblies
 Reduce the safe load capacity for material or fabricated assembly that has a loss of section due to corrosion, damage, or
 previous fabrication. Do not splice shapes used as beams at points of maximum bending stress. All splices shall develop yield on
 the gross section and fracture on the net section.
 Design trusses, other fabricated sections, and steel beams meeting the requirements of the AASHTO Guide Design
 Specifications for Bridge Temporary Works and the AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges. The Contractor may
 increase the allowable stresses in the AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges by no greater than one-third.
 Design and use form ties and other steel devices planned for casting into concrete so that the major part, or the entire
 device, remains permanently in the concrete. If using a device that passes through a concrete surface exposed to view in the
 completed structure, use a device removable to a depth of at least 1 inch from the concrete face without spalling or damaging the
 concrete.

 2401.3
 B.1.c
 Lumber
 Provide lumber free of defects that may adversely affect its strength or the appearance of exposed concrete lines and
 surfaces, such as crooks, twists, warps, and variations in dimensions. Surface the side of lumber pieces that will contact concrete.
 If not using form lining, surface or dress and match abutting edges to prevent mortar leakage.
 Working stresses for lumber shall not exceed the maximum stresses specified in the Bridge Construction Manual,
 Falsework and Forms section. Provide sheathing lumber, either with or without form lining, at least 1 inch nominal thick and no
 greater than 8 inches wide for exposed concrete surfaces. If a single piece of lumber will completely cover a concrete surface and
 the lumber is not cupped or warped, the Contractor may use wider lumber. For curved surfaces with a radius of less than 5 ft, the
 Contractor may use sheathing thinner than 1 inch nominal as approved by the Engineer.
 B.1.d
 Plywood Sheathing
 Provide plywood for form sheathing meeting the following requirements and characteristics:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 Consisting of at least five plies;
 Nominal thickness of at least ¾ inch;
 Plyform exterior grade with sanded or overlaid surfaces specially manufactured for use as form sheathing; and
 Strength requirements as specified in the Bridge Construction Manual, Falsework and Forms section.
 
 The Contractor may use the plywood without backing if it meets the above requirements.
 For curved surfaces with a radius of less than 5 ft and for slab sections between girders or beams, the Contractor may
 provide plywood sheathing thinner than ¾ inch nominal, as approved by the Engineer.
 B.1.e
 Form Lining
 If the contract requires form lining, use plywood sheathing with a smooth surfaced material that will produce a concrete
 surface substantially as smooth and uniform as that obtained using sanded or overlaid plywood sheathing in good condition with no
 warps or damaged areas. Use the same kind of form lining material throughout an exposed concrete face. Place the form lining to
 produce a smooth contact surface that is free of defects. Provide smooth form lining free of defects that cause irregularities that
 the specified concrete finishing operations in 2401.3.F, “Finish of Concrete,” cannot remove.
 Provide form lining material with a uniform thickness and edges that form mortar tight joints.
 Ensure that bolt, nail, or rivet heads and weld deposits are flush with the form lining face in contact with concrete.
 If using form lining sheets or sections, use material that minimizes the number of joints.
 B.1.f
 Forms for Circular Columns
 Use forms that can withstand design concrete pressures without distortion. Use forms to produce a concrete surface free
 of visible ridges and depressions. If form lining is shown on the plans, the Contractor may use fiber molds. When using form
 brands not previously used, provide the Engineer with the manufacturer’s data.
 B.1.g
 Chamfer Strips
 Provide chamfer strips, smooth on all sides and uniform in cross section dimensions without rounded corners. If using
 wood strips, provide wood strips made of straight grain soft wood. Size chamfer strips as shown on the plans and in accordance
 with 2401.3.B.6, “Form Construction.”
 B.2
 Design of Falsework and Forms
 Submit detailed plans for falsework and forms to the Engineer.
 Provide falsework members designed to safely carry the following forces:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 (5)
 
 Dead load of the falsework members only;
 Dead load of the green concrete, computed at 150 lb per cu. ft;
 A vertical live load of 20 lb per sq. ft applied on the upper concrete surface;
 Dead load of the forms and other falsework members supported by the members; and
 Equipment loads and material stockpile loads anticipated for use during construction.
 
 Provide forms designed to safely carry the following forces:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 Dead load of the forms only;
 The dead load of green concrete, computed at 150 lb per cu. ft;
 A vertical live load of 50 lb per sq. ft applied on the upper concrete surface.
 All equipment loads and material stockpile loads anticipated for use during construction.
 
 Consider the specified live load as the minimum. Adjust for concentrated loads that may produce higher live loads on a
 member than the minimums specified.
 
 240
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2401.3
 
 Provide falsework and forms designed in accordance with the following as specified in the Bridge Construction Manual,
 Falsework and Forms section:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 (5)
 
 Concrete pressures;
 Standard formulas;
 Allowable stresses;
 Deflections; and
 Deviations of alignment.
 
 Provide credible information regarding the performance of the proposed falsework and forms under concrete load
 construction for any type of construction not included in the Bridge Construction Manual, Falsework and Forms section, as
 requested by the Engineer.
 Before using devices or fabrications that the Engineer determines the Department does not have sufficient performance
 information on, conduct full scale field or laboratory testing of falsework and forms at no additional cost to the Department, as
 directed by the Engineer.
 B.3
 Form Lining Requirements
 Nail form lining backed by sheathing to prevent bulging. Fasten plywood at least ¾ inch thick to its supports to ensure
 stiffness and close contact between the plywood and supports.
 Tightly butt edges of plywood sheets and form panels without offset to form a mortar tight joint. The Engineer will allow
 the Contractor to patch or seal joints that will not seal with cold water putty, expandable foam, or an equivalent approved by the
 Engineer.
 Place joints in form lining sections or between adjacent form panels following the same horizontal line. Place horizontal
 joints on all columns of a unit to the same level. Align joints in form lining vertically and horizontally.
 On forms for concrete faces exposed to view, drill holes for form bolts through sheathing or form lining without
 splintering the face of the form in contact with the concrete. If using both sides of sheathing, avoid splintering on both faces.
 Use form lining in accordance with 2401.3.B.1.e, “Form Lining,” for formed surfaces. The Department will not require use
 of form lining for buried surfaces or surfaces hidden from view in the completed structure, except as shown on the plans.
 If using recessed rustication strips to divide a concrete surface into panels as shown on the plans, set rustications to
 cover the joints in the form lining. Concrete panels with a rubbed surface finish or a special surface finish do not require form lining
 joints to be covered by rustication strips.
 B.4
 Falsework Requirements
 Support falsework on piling, on ledge rock, on parts of the structure, or on temporary footings.
 Do not weld on stress-carrying steel members of the bridge superstructure except as specified in 2402, “Steel Bridge
 Construction.”
 Drive falsework piling to a bearing capacity and penetration that will adequately support the superimposed loads without
 settlement as shown in the falsework plans.
 Use temporary footings to support falsework in accordance with the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 Submit geotechnical borings, testing, analysis, and calculations, including soil bearing capacity, anticipated
 settlement, and sliding resistance, for proposed footings showing that detrimental settlement will not occur
 under maximum construction loads and conditions anticipated at the site.
 Protect footings from undermining, freezing, or being overspread with water.
 Use when approved by the Engineer, otherwise support with pilings.
 
 Cut off falsework piling in a bent to provide uniform bearing for the pile cap. Securely fasten caps to the pile heads or
 posts. Securely brace each falsework bent with timber of adequate size as shown on the falsework plans. Securely brace the bents
 to adjacent bents.
 Provide falsework for superstructures in widths greater than the overall width of the superstructure to brace side forms to
 the falsework.
 On bridges with separate roadways, support the form and falsework supports for each roadway slab with beams or
 girders under that roadway.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 241
 
 2401.3
 
 Locate primary supports for concrete slab spans and the bottom slab for concrete box girders no greater than 2 ft from
 the construction joints in the slabs.
 Provide falsework for slab overhangs for steel beam spans capable of resisting torsional stresses. Use knee bracing, cross
 bracing, struts, ties, or other methods approved by the Engineer to prevent pronounced deflections caused by stresses. Bracing is
 particularly critical when slab overhangs are greater than the beam depth.
 B.5
 Removal of Falsework
 Do not release falsework supporting concrete structures and concrete members until the completion of the curing period
 in accordance with 2401.3.G, “Concrete Curing and Protection,” plus 1 calendar day of drying out time. Release falsework
 supporting post tensioned structures after stressing the post tensioning tendons as described in the specifications and shown on the
 plans.
 Do not place loads on concrete members until completion of curing and after the release of falsework, unless otherwise
 approved by the Engineer.
 Determine adequate strength for the complete structure using the last concrete cast affected by the release of falsework.
 Loosen supporting falsework to allow the concrete to uniformly and gradually take the stresses due to its own weight.
 Begin releasing the falsework at or near the center of a span for the full width of the span. Simultaneously release
 falsework toward both ends of the span unless otherwise approved by the Engineer. On continuous span concrete superstructures,
 with or without cantilevers and hinges, release falsework simultaneously and uniformly in all spans unless otherwise approved by
 the Engineer.
 Remove falsework piles located within the roadbed to an elevation of at least 4 ft below the subgrade adjacent to the
 pile. Remove falsework piles located in a stream or lake bed and within the limits of low water to the elevation matching the
 surface of the stream or lake bed. In established navigation channels, remove falsework to an elevation of at least 2 ft below the
 surface of the channel bottom. Remove all other piles to an elevation of at least 2 ft below ground elevation.
 Remove falsework supports used for the top slab of concrete box girder spans and steel box girder spans.
 Unless otherwise approved by the Engineer, remove temporary footings unless the top surfaces of the footings are at
 least 4 ft below the grading grade or at least 2 ft under other ground surfaces.
 Backfill and compact open excavations resulting from the removal of falsework in accordance with 2451, “Structure
 Excavations and Backfills,” at no additional cost to the Department.
 B.6
 Form Construction
 Provide forms meeting the following requirements and characteristics:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 Designed and constructed to safely resist the pressure of fluid concrete under vibration and of other loads
 incidental to the construction operations;
 Constructed and erected mortar tight so that the finished concrete conforms to the dimensions and contours
 shown on the plans, and so that undulations and waves on exposed finished concrete surfaces do not exceed
 the maximum shown in the Bridge Construction Manual, Falsework and Form section;
 Set true to the designated lines shown on the plans; and
 Rigidly maintained until the concrete has sufficiently hardened to allow removal of forms per 2401.3.B.8,
 “Removal of Forms.”
 
 For vertical construction joints in a concrete unit with a rubbed surface finish, locate joints in form sections to allow the
 removal of the major part of the forms to allow the initial rubbed surface finish on the cast portion.
 Construct vertical forms that will permit removal independent from overhead falsework.
 Place sheathing lumber horizontally unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 Construct splices in wales so the wale remains effective continuously for its entire length. Stagger splices in each
 member of a double wale at least one stud space.
 The Contractor may leave openings in the forms to clean out extraneous matter or to facilitate the placement of concrete
 if the Engineer approves the number and location of openings. Construct closures for openings to ensure a tight fit flush with the
 adjoining surfaces.
 Unless the plans show otherwise, use chamfer strips with ¾ inch sides to form chamfered corners where exposed
 intersecting concrete surfaces meet at angles no greater than 90 degrees. The Department will not require chamfered corners at
 
 242
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2401.3
 the corners of beam stools under decks with mortar tight joints. If the contract does not require joint edging, use similar moldings
 with ½ inch sides at all joints exposed to view. Fasten moldings at intervals no greater than 6 inch.
 Set chamfer strips at the tops of pier caps supported on falsework in a manner that will allow adjustment to true bridge
 seat elevation after the placement of the bulk of the cap concrete.
 The Contractor may provide forms for keyways at construction joints in concrete constructed with nominal lumber
 dimensions and with side bevels no greater than 1:10.
 Provide forms for open joints capable of removal without damaging the joint after the removal of the form.
 If the contract requires a construction joint between the bridge slab and barriers, curbs, or medians, set the forms for
 subsequent placement after placement of the bridge slab in all spans that could cause a deflection in the span the superimposed
 concrete is cast on.
 Before setting grade elevations for curbs, sidewalks, medians, and railings, free the concrete box girder spans and
 concrete slab spans from temporary supports.
 Do not drive nails into the hardened concrete to fasten forms for roadway faces of curbs, sidewalks, and medians. Use
 braces and struts to maintain proper line and batter for roadway curb face, sidewalk, and median forms, if these are cast separately
 from the slab. Do not use internal spreaders. Remove bolts and pins set or drilled into the slab for the form work to a depth of at
 least 1½ inches below the slab surface without spalling or damaging the concrete. Fill the holes flush with non-shrink grout listed
 on the Approved/Qualified Products List.
 If constructing a bridge with a horizontal curve as shown on the plans, construct the forms for edges of slab, curbs,
 copings, medians, and railings to that degree of curvature within a tolerance of ⅛ inch in 10 ft.
 B.7
 Treatment of Forms
 Before placing reinforcement, treat the contact faces of forms with a form coating material in accordance with 3902,
 “Form Coating Material.” Apply the form coating at the rate recommended by the manufacturer.
 Protect form lining treated before erection from accumulations of dust and dirt.
 Use water to flush faces of forms that contact concrete immediately before placement of concrete.
 B.8
 Removal of Forms
 Do not remove forms until provisions are in place for continuous curing in accordance with 2401.3.G, "Concrete Curing
 and Protection."
 Remove forms and form ties carefully to prevent spalling or marring of the concrete surface and to avoid breaking off
 concrete corners.
 The Contractor may remove forms for the roadway face of curbs, sidewalks, and medians when the concrete can retain
 its shape and if weather conditions allow the start of the specified concrete finish per 2401.3.F.2.d, “Curb, Sidewalk, and Median
 Finish,” immediately after removing the forms.
 Remove column and wall forms before releasing the falsework supports from concrete supported by the column or wall.
 Do not remove forms for rustication, fluting strips, and drain recesses at the same time as the face forms. Leave
 rustication, fluting strips, and drain recesses forms in place until it is possible to remove these items without spalling, chipping, or
 marring of concrete corners or edges.
 Remove forms for the webs of concrete box girder spans and provide the web concrete with an ordinary surface finish
 before setting the forms for the top slab in place at that location.
 Remove interior forms in concrete box girder spans. Remove deck forms on the interior of steel box girder spans. Clear
 loose material from the inside of the concrete box girders and steel box girders, and sweep the box clean.
 B.9
 Re-Use of Forms
 The Contractor may reuse forms and form liners if they are sufficiently rigid so that the undulation of the concrete surface
 does not exceed 1/8 inch when checked with a 5.0 ft straightedge or template. If the form lining between supports show
 conspicuous permanent set, remove the form lining and correct before reuse.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 243
 
 2401.3
 Plug or cover open holes in sheathing. Plug open holes in form lining flush with the lining. Repair blemishes on the form
 lining surface to a smooth and even surface. Clean adhering concrete and extraneous matter from form surfaces in contact with
 concrete before reuse.
 C
 Placement of Concrete – General Requirements
 Complete the placement of forms, falsework, bracing, and reinforcement bars for the entire concrete cast and have
 concrete placement and finishing equipment and curing material on site before placing the concrete.
 Notify the Engineer at least 24 h in advance of the casting of concrete to allow the Engineer to inspect forms,
 reinforcement bars, materials, and equipment. Do not place concrete until the Engineer inspects and approves the work.
 Perform mixing, placing, and finishing of concrete under adequate lighting conditions.
 Transport and place concrete without segregating the batch materials. Place concrete in or near its final position without
 displacing the reinforcement while completely enveloping the reinforcement in the concrete.
 Keep equipment for transporting, placing, and finishing concrete free of foreign matter and coatings of hardened
 concrete. Waste the water used for cleaning equipment outside of the forms as approved by the Engineer.
 Clean forms and reinforcement bars and remove debris inside the forms before placing concrete.
 Place concrete under water only when used for a cofferdam seal and as shown on the special provisions or as approved
 by the Engineer.
 When placing concrete on or against earth and porous rock foundations, moisten the surfaces before placing concrete.
 Footings cast in solid rock will not require side forms.
 Place concrete between required or permissible joints as shown on the plans in a continuous operation. If a breakdown
 in the concrete placement operation occurs and the concrete placed to that point sets so that re-vibration is not possible, cover the
 surface of the concrete with an approved bonding agent or mortar as directed by the Engineer before placing fresh concrete against
 it.
 Place concrete at a rate that does not exceed fluid pressure for which forms were designed. Stop casting operations at
 signs of overstress or excessive deflection.
 Except for seals, deposit and compact concrete in continuous horizontal layers no greater than 1 ft thick. In columns and
 thin walls, the Contractor may increase the thickness by no greater than 3 ft. Place and compact concrete before the concrete in
 the preceding layer takes its initial set. Place layers of concrete within 1 h of placing the next layer of concrete at the same point,
 unless otherwise directed by the Engineer.
 Do not drop concrete from a height greater than 4 ft unless confined in a vertical down spout or other approved type of
 pipe or unless the Engineer approves another placement method. Use as many down spouts as needed to place concrete at a
 horizontal level. The Contractor may use inclined pipes, belts, or chutes to discharge concrete into the hopper of the downspout if
 the Contractor provides approved means of preventing segregation.
 Place concrete buckets as close as practical to the point of deposit before discharging concrete. Discharge concrete at a
 rate that does not displace reinforcement bars, forms, supports or any embedded items. Do not discharge excess concrete in a pile
 for re-handling.
 Remove laitance and foreign matter if it accumulates on the inside of the forms.
 Do not mix dried or hardened concrete accumulations with fresh concrete. As the concrete rises in the forms, keep the
 form surfaces and reinforcement bars free of concrete spatters that may harden and become part of the mix. Remove dried
 concrete and dust accumulations on the form surfaces and reinforcement bars above construction joints before placing the next
 concrete lift. Do not damage the form surfaces, reinforcement bar coating, or the steel-to-concrete bond when removing excess
 concrete.
 Work the coarse aggregate away from the forms. Force the concrete under and around the reinforcement bars without
 displacing the bars.
 If casting a wall or column greater than 5 ft tall integrally with a beam, strut, or slab, allow from 30 min to 90 min, as
 determined by the Engineer, to elapse between placement of the concrete to the level of the bottom of the beam, strut, or slab and
 placement of the concrete above this level.
 For caps supported by more than one column, cast columns uniformly and allow from 30 min to 90 min to elapse, as
 determined by the Engineer, before placing the cap.
 
 244
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2401.3
 
 Clean set concrete of loose material, laitance, and dirt before placing fresh concrete against it. Sand or water blast
 superstructure concrete to clean the set concrete. Avoid damage to coating on reinforcement bars. Before placing the fresh
 concrete, draw the forms for the fresh concrete tight against the set concrete. Keep the contact surfaces of the set concrete wet
 until depositing the fresh concrete.
 If the Engineer determines that shock waves from pile driving, blasting, or other operations will damage the concrete,
 complete these operations before placing concrete or suspend these operations until the concrete gains adequate strength per
 2401.3.G, “Concrete Curing and Protection.”
 Do not support runways for concrete transportation by the forms unless approved by the Engineer.
 Remove the span falsework and obtain an acceptable bridge slab cure before placing concrete barriers unless otherwise
 approved by the Engineer.
 D
 Compaction of Concrete
 Compact concrete, except for cofferdam seals, using mechanical vibration applied internally. Operate vibrators at a
 frequency of at least 4,500 impulses per min. Compact each batch of concrete immediately after placement.
 Apply vibrators at points no farther apart than twice the radius of the vibrator’s visibly effective range. Manipulate the
 vibrators to work the concrete around reinforcement and imbedded fixtures and into the corners and angles of the forms. Use
 spading to supplement vibration to produce smooth surfaces and dense concrete along form surfaces and in corners and locations
 unreachable by vibrators.
 Apply vibration at the point of deposit of freshly deposited concrete. Vibrate long enough to compact the concrete but
 not so long as to cause segregation and localized areas of grout. Insert and withdraw vibrators in a vertical orientation.
 Do not apply vibration to, or apply vibration directly on reinforcement bars to sections of concrete that has hardened to
 the degree that the concrete ceases to be plastic under vibration. Do not use vibrators to make concrete flow in the forms; this
 action will cause segregation.
 Use non-metallic vibrator head for compaction of concrete around epoxy-coated components per 2472.3.C.3, “Special
 Requirements for Coated Bars.”
 E
 Joint Construction
 Perform joint construction as shown on the plans and in accordance with the following:
 E.1
 Transverse Construction Joints
 Make grooves or saw cuts ⅜ inch wide by 1 inch deep in accordance with the following unless otherwise shown in the
 plans or directed by the Engineer:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 At transverse construction joints in the bridge slab unless otherwise directed by the Engineer;
 To the full width of the roadway between gutter lines; and
 Directly over the construction joint before placement of curb forms.
 
 E.2
 Weakened Plane Joints
 Use a grooving tool or a removable insert when casting the slab to extend and form a weakened plane under sidewalks
 and at other slab locations where a saw cut is not possible. Place the insert or groove to cut the fresh concrete on a straight line to
 a depth of 1 in. When using an insert, coat with oil or grease before placement. Withdraw the insert when the concrete has set
 enough to retain the groove shape with the insert removed.
 Locate the weakened plane to fall vertically below the sidewalk, curb, or median joint at that location. On skewed bridges
 with exterior girders or beams under curbs, sidewalks, or medians that are normal to the longitudinal axis of the bridge, extend the
 weakened plane using a removable insert. Place the insert as a continuation of the line to be cut, extending to the centerline of the
 exterior girders or beams.
 Outward from the centerline of the exterior girders or beams, place the weakened plane common to the joint placed in
 the curb, sidewalk, or median. Form a vertical ½ inch V-shape in the edge of the slab at the end of the weakened plane at that
 location.
 E.3
 Open or Filled Joints
 Form the distance between faces of open joints with removable inserts, headers, or templates to provide the opening
 shown on the plans for the temperature range prevailing at the time of concrete placement. Refer to the tabulation shown on the
 plans or shop drawings for the required openings at various temperatures. The temperatures listed represent the temperature
 anticipated when the slab is cast. Joints may widen due to concrete shrinkage.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 245
 
 2401.3
 
 After placing the bridge slab adjacent to an elastomeric seal expansion joint, and after curing and drying the concrete, the
 Engineer will measure the constructed joint openings. The Engineer may reject openings that deviate from the size shown on the
 plans by greater than 3/16 inch as unacceptable work in accordance with 1512, “Unacceptable and Unauthorized Work.” The
 Department will also consider offsets at joints between segments as unacceptable work.
 The Contractor may use preformed joint filler to form vertical joints. When using cork joint filler to form a vertical joint,
 anchor with copper nails 2½ inches long at 20 inch centers. Where the contract requires chamfered corners at joints created by
 using preformed material, trim the preformed filler back to the inside of the vee formed by the chamfer strip.
 E.4
 Expansion Joint Devices
 Provide, assemble, and install bridge slab expansion joint devices as shown on the plans and in accordance with
 2402.3.K, “Expansion Joint Devices.”
 F
 
 Finish of Concrete
 
 F.1
 General
 Surface finish concrete that is properly set, and only during weather conditions, or with weather protection, approved by
 the Engineer.
 F.2
 
 Formed Surfaces
 
 F.2.a
 Ordinary Surface Finish
 Provide ordinary surface finish on formed surfaces of concrete structures. If applying special surface finishes to
 conventionally formed concrete surfaces, sand or water blast the surface before ordinary surface finishing to break the surface film
 and to remove laitance, form release agent, dirt, and other foreign matter that might adversely affect adhesion of special surface
 finishes.
 Immediately after removing the forms, examine the concrete surfaces for defects. Remove and repair concrete with
 porosity, honey comb, or segregated materials, as approved by the Engineer. The Engineer will approve the time, method, and
 materials used to make concrete repairs. Repair small areas with mortar as specified for surface cavities. The Engineer may
 require formed surfaces to repair large areas. The repairs may require a bonding agent, mechanical bonds, or both. Cure repair
 work as approved by the Engineer. The Engineer may reject concrete sections with extensive, irreparable defects as unacceptable
 work in accordance with 1512, “Unacceptable and Unauthorized Work.”
 Remove fins and projections from exposed surfaces and from surfaces that will be waterproofed.
 Clean, saturate with water, and fill with mortar all surface cavities produced by form ties. Clean, saturate with water, and
 fill with mortar all surface cavities on exposed surfaces with a diameter of at least ⅜ inch. The Department defines “exposed
 surfaces,” as surfaces exposed to view in the completed structure, above low water, and above the final ground line. At unexposed
 surface locations or areas where the Engineer determines repairs will not affect the appearance of the completed structure, clean
 and fill cavities caused by removing falsework, brackets, form ties, or hanger rods with a silicone caulk listed on the
 Approved/Qualified Products List for “Moisture Cured Polymeric Joint Sealer.”
 Use mortar consisting of three parts standard Portland cement, six parts mortar sand, and water to fill surface cavities.
 Use enough water to produce a mortar consistency as dry as possible to use effectively. Mix the mortar 1 h before use.
 Provide a latex or acrylic-based bonding agent listed on the Approved/Qualified Products List for special surface finish.
 Mix the bonding agent into the mortar used for ordinary surface finishing on areas that will receive a special surface finish. Add the
 bonding agent to the mixing water at a ratio of one part bonding agent to three parts water.
 Fill the cavities with mortar. Compact the cavities in place, point, and trim flush with the concrete surface. On exposed
 surfaces, remove mortar stains or streaks outside the area of the filled cavity.
 After completing the concrete work, remove visible streaks, stains, and blemishes from the surface if the special
 provisions do not show additional surface finishing on an exposed surface. Perform additional surface finishing on an exposed
 surface for which the contract that requires only ordinary surface finish when adjoining form lining sheets present sharply
 contrasting colors or textures. Provide sack rubbed surface finish as a corrective measure if the surface appearance remains
 sharply contrasting after the completion of the ordinary surface finish.
 If applying the ordinary surface finish before the completion of the curing period, minimize interruption to the curing
 when performing the finishing.
 F.2.b
 Sack Rubbed Surface Finish
 In areas with numerous surface voids on an exposed surface, the Contractor may use sack rubbed finish to fill the smaller
 voids in lieu of the method described under ordinary surface finish. Fill form tie holes and other cavities of at least ⅜ inch in
 accordance with 2401.3.F.2.a, “Ordinary Surface Finish.”
 
 246
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2401.3
 
 Grind or sandblast the concrete surface to remove blemishes, discolorations, and thin mortar films covering surface voids.
 After the completion of the structure, and when further construction will not produce blemishes and discolorations on the
 surface, perform the following operations:
 (1)
 (1.1)
 (1.2)
 (1.3)
 (2)
 (3)
 (3.1)
 (3.2)
 
 Saturate the surface with water and, beginning at the top, use a rubber float to apply a mortar mixture to fill
 the voids. Mix the mortar using the following requirements:
 One part standard Portland cement,
 One part mortar sand, and
 Contains sufficient water to produce a moderately thick paste that will remain in place when applied.
 Rewet the concrete surface if it dries before applying the mortar paste.
 After the mortar sets in the voids, but before it completely dries, rub the floated surface using a burlap sack
 filled with a dry mix of mortar to remove mortar in excess of what was needed to fill the voids. The Engineer
 will approve equally effective means of removing the excess mortar.
 Produce a completed surface meeting the following requirements and characteristics:
 Free of blemishes, discolorations, and surface voids,
 Uniform in texture and appearance, except for the difference in texture between filled voids and the remainder
 of the surface.
 
 Correct surfaces not meeting the requirements of this section as approved by the Engineer.
 F.2.c
 Special Surface Finish
 Provide a special surface finish for bridges and surfaces required by the contract to produce a smooth surface uniform in
 texture and appearance.
 Use a Department-approved system listed on the Approved/Qualified Products List for “Special Surface Finish System,” to
 apply a special surface finishing consisting of commercially packaged mortar, bonding agent, and 100 percent acrylic paint. Blend
 the mortar, bonding agent, and water in the proportions recommended by the manufacturer. Provide 100 percent acrylic paint in
 accordance with 3584, “Exterior Masonry Acrylic Emulsion Paint,” and blend at a rate of 1 gal per 50 lb of dry mortar mix. Produce
 a mixture suitable for spray application to vertical concrete surfaces at the specified coverage rate, below.
 Mix and remix materials as recommended by the manufacturer.
 Apply two coats of the mixture by spraying, as recommended by the manufacturer, using a total coverage rate of 16 sq.
 ft per gal of material. Use the first coat to cover the entire surface, taking care not to cause runs, sags, or excessive build-up.
 The Contractor may begin special surface finishing operations, including any topcoat applications, at an ambient air
 temperature of at least 39° F and rising. Suspend special surface finishing operations if the ambient air temperature falls to 45 °F
 and is dropping.
 Begin surface finishing operations only when it is possible to perform the work continuously from beginning to completion
 on any one bridge element.
 Perform surface finishing so that after drying the final surface is uniform in color and texture, without evidence of laps or
 breaks in continuity. Perform corrective work on unsatisfactorily finished areas coated with special surface finishing or topcoat as
 directed by the Engineer and at no additional cost to the Department.
 F.2.d
 Curb, Sidewalk, and Median Finish
 Provide a surface finish on formed surfaces of medians, delineator curbs, and the roadway face of curbs and sidewalks in
 accordance with the following:
 (1)
 
 (2)
 
 Begin ordinary surface finish operations immediately after removing the forms and work continuously to
 completion. As the ordinary surface finish progresses, rub the surface with a cork float or fine carborundum
 stone to produce a paste on the surface and to expose and fill depressions and surface cavities. Float the paste
 to a smooth surface free of coarse texture, swirls, and ridges. Before the surface sets, brush the surface lightly
 with a fine bristled brush to remove cement films and produce a uniform surface with a fine grained and
 sanded texture, and
 Complete the surface finishing of the formed surface within 12 h after concrete placement.
 
 F.2.e
 Barrier Finish
 Do not allow horizontal or vertical irregularities greater than ¼ in in any 10 ft length of finished concrete barrier. The
 Engineer may reject surfaces and edges not meeting this tolerance as unacceptable work in accordance with 1512, “Unacceptable
 and Unauthorized Work.” Remove and replace unacceptable work as directed by the Engineer. Remove and replace extensive
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 247
 
 2401.3
 areas (greater than 10 percent of barrier length) with deviations greater than ½ in. If the Engineer does not direct the Contractor
 to remove and replace unacceptable work, the Contractor may leave the work in place with the following price adjustments:
 (1)
 (2)
 F.3
 
 For deviations from 5/16 inch to ½ inch, the Department will pay for concrete barrier at 75 percent of the
 contract unit price; and
 For minor areas (less than or equal to 10 percent of barrier length) with deviations greater than ½ inches, the
 Department will pay for concrete barrier at 50 percent of the contract unit price.
 Unformed Surfaces
 
 F.3.a
 Miscellaneous Unformed Surfaces
 Finish unformed upper horizontal and inclined surfaces, except for the surface of bridge slabs and the surface at
 horizontal construction joints, in accordance with the following:
 Do not use steel trowels and steel shod floats. Use wood or wood shod templates and strike-offs. Use hand floats and
 darbies with wood, canvas, rubber, or cork contact surfaces. Use metal edgers that do not form offsets greater than 1/16 in in the
 concrete surface. Do not create waves in the concrete surface when edging. In lieu of using an edger, the Contractor may form
 rounded corners using a cove strip that does not create an offset greater than 1/16 inch with adjacent concrete surfaces.
 Place excess concrete in the forms and compact by internal vibration. After a 30 min delay, strike off and screed the
 surface with a template forcing the coarse aggregate below the finished surface leaving the surface slightly above finished elevation
 to allow for settlement during curing. Repeat the screeding and strike-off operation to obtain the elevation shown on the plans and
 contour, except for edging. Waste laitance and excess mortar outside of the forms. After the final strike off and screeding, hand
 float the surface to correct irregularities and seal surface tears. Immediately after the water sheen leaves the surface, rework the
 surface to a uniform texture using a float. Tool rounded corners and edges to final radius forcing the coarse aggregate beneath the
 finished radius. Float to remove trails left by the edging tools.
 Apply final texture and finish to the surface in accordance with the following:
 (1)
 (1.1)
 (1.2)
 (1.3)
 (2)
 
 Brush or broom bridge curbs and sidewalks and the floor slabs, ramps, landings, and stair treads for pedestrian
 bridges and tunnels in a transverse direction using a fairly stiff bristled brush or broom to produce a surface
 finish meeting the following requirements and characteristics:
 Visibly serrated;
 Not slippery when wet; and
 Uniform throughout in texture and appearance.
 Brush the cement film from the surface to provide a uniform, fine grained, sanded texture using a fine bristled
 brush.
 
 Ensure the finished surface does not vary by greater than ⅛ inch from a 10 ft straightedge laid longitudinally on the
 surface, with transverse surfaces substantially as shown on the plans.
 F.3.b
 
 Bridge Slabs
 
 F.3.b(1) General
 Before placing concrete for a section of bridge slab, and after setting the strike-off rails or guides to correct elevation,
 check the top reinforcement for vertical position by operating the strike-off on the rails or guides in the presence of the Engineer.
 Attach a filler strip ¼ inch thinner than the minimum concrete cover requirements to the bottom of the strike-off during this check
 to detect reinforcement bars that may encroach on the required clearance.
 Place the following in a continuous operation proceeding uniformly from edge to edge of the slab or from end to end of
 the section:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 Each bridge slab section between joints;
 Each bridge slab section between an end bulk-head and a joint; or
 With no joints specified, the entire slab.
 
 If the contract does not require a specific sequence or direction for casting slab sections, submit plans for the proposed
 casting procedures for approval. Before starting construction, obtain the Engineer’s approval for any change to the casting plans.
 If bridge slab placement and finishing is performed at night, provide a “well-lighted” area to accomplish QC/QA
 inspections. "Well-lighted" is defined as a minimum of 50 foot candles of artificial light or natural daylight. Use a light meter with
 readings in foot candles to verify the adequacy of the lighting.
 If at least two spans of continuous beams or girders support a bridge slab section, place concrete at a rate that concrete
 will remain plastic for at least one-half a span length back of an intermediate support until placement has proceeded to a point onehalf of the span length ahead of that support. Provide approved admixtures to retard concrete setting time as required to maintain
 plasticity.
 
 248
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2401.3
 
 If simple span girders support a bridge slab section or if the Contract requires sequence casting for wide continuous beam
 bridge decks, place concrete at a forward rate of at least 20 ft per h without producing cold joints between partially hardened
 concrete and the adjacent newly placed concrete.
 At least 14 calendar days prior to slab placement, provide a slab placement and curing plan for each bridge to the
 Engineer for approval. Include the following information in the placement and curing plan:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 (5)
 (6)
 
 Anticipated concrete delivery rates;
 Estimated start and finish time;
 Material, labor and equipment proposed for placing, finishing, and curing including placement of wet burlap,
 soaker hose, or other system to maintain the deck in a moist condition during the curing period;
 Number of work bridges proposed for use;
 Number of people responsible for the various tasks; and
 Bulkheading methods and materials proposed for use if the Contractor cannot maintain the proposed concrete
 placement rates.
 
 Attend a pre-placement meeting two (2) to four (4) calendar days before the slab placement to review the information
 and details provided in the placement and curing plan. The following project personnel are required to attend the pre-placement
 meeting:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 Contractor;
 Engineer;
 Concrete supplier; and
 Concrete pump supplier, if requested by the Engineer.
 
 F.3.b(2) On-site Adjustments for Bridge Slab Concrete
 In addition to the requirements set forth in 2461.3.G.4, "Field Adjustments," comply with the following if any adjustments
 are necessary on site:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 Only admixtures originally incorporated into the mix will be allowed with the exception that Viscosity Modifying
 Admixture (VMA) may be used to adjust slump;
 a maximum of 1 gal of water addition per yd3 of concrete, including the any water necessary to dilute
 admixtures, may be on site provided that additional water is available to add per the Certificate of Compliance;
 and
 Mix the load a minimum of 5 minutes or 50 revolutions after any additions.
 The Engineer will not allow finishing aids or evaporation retarders for use in finishing of the
 
 concrete.
 F.3.b(3) Strike-Off of Bridge Slab (Applies to both Bridge Deck Slab and Bridge Structural Slab)
 Place the concrete at a rate that ensures the initial strike-off operation is never greater than 10 ft behind the placement
 operation. Maintain the head of concrete parallel with the initially screeded surface. Leave excess concrete carried in front of the
 screed on the surface when reaching the head of the concrete. Mix with freshly deposited concrete before compacting.
 Consolidate any previously consolidated concrete to remove voids, including those caused by footprints or reinforcement deflection.
 Strike off and screed the roadway surface after concrete placement and compaction. When the initial strike-off operation
 reveals low areas, fill these areas with additional concrete before continuing. Avoid walking in the concrete after the initial pass of
 the screed. Re-screed to the cross-slope and longitudinal profile as required by the contract.
 Do not work, smooth, or disturb the concrete surface while bleed water and laitance remain on the surface.
 If the use of a power-operated strike-off screed is specified, provide mechanical screeding motion with equipment moving
 on flanged or grooved wheels resting on the screed rails. If exterior beams or girders that lie under the roadway slab support the
 running rails, the Contractor may finish the area between the rail and the gutter without the use of the power-operated screed. In
 this area, use suitable guides to determine the required gutter profile and, after plastic shrinkage, straighten and true the area to
 the required profile and cross-slope. Ensure the screed carries a surplus of concrete in the front during screeding operations.
 Perform the final screeding to cover as long a section as practicable without stopping.
 F.3.b(3)(a) Bridge Structural Slabs
 The Department will not require screed rails for templates used for strike-off and screeding of a bridge structural slab. If
 using screed rails, use screed rails in accordance with this section.
 Securely tie and rigidly support top reinforcement in accordance with 2472.3.C, “Placing, Supporting, and Tying Bar
 Reinforcement.” Before placing the concrete, demonstrate that the equipment and methods proposed for use will not damage or
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 249
 
 2401.3
 displace reinforcement bars. Provide additional bar support, additional supports for template, or both upon visible deflections of
 reinforcement.
 Provide templates fabricated by a manufacturer with at least 10 years’ experience. If using templates greater than 24 ft
 long, demonstrate adjustments for crown breaks as approved by the Engineer. Evenly attach vibrators across template length and
 provide templates that will automatically shut-off vibration when forward motion stops.
 Space template supports to prevent sag in the template. For portions of template supports in contact with reinforcement,
 provide template supports consisting of round tubes or rods with a smooth, low friction surface. Provide skis at least 5 ft long with
 a gradual “turn-up” nose sufficient to prevent entrapment in reinforcement. Support transverse reinforcement bars within 6 inches
 of the location where template support skis will ride.
 Provide a manual or powered winch to advance the template. Do not anchor winch cables to reinforcement bars. The
 Contractor may attach the winch cable to beam shear studs or stirrups.
 Spread and level concrete in front of template without causing “float” or overriding. Hand-float the surface of bridge
 structural slabs only to close up areas of exposed aggregate.
 F.3.b(3)(b) Bridge Deck Slabs (Bridge slabs without separate concrete wearing course)
 Use a self-propelled power-operated strike-off machine to screed the roadway surface of monolithic bridge slabs. Provide
 a finishing machine consisting of a cylindrical finisher mated with horizontal adjustable augers, both of which are mounted on a
 transversely moving carriage unless otherwise approved by the State Bridge Construction Engineer. Sidewalk surfaces to be
 separated by a permanent concrete barrier may be screeded with equipment conforming to F.3.b(3)(a) but must meet the finish
 tolerances for bridge deck slabs.
 Use rails, bulk-heads, or the side forms as screed guides for manual strike-off. Use rails as guides for power-operated
 strike-offs, with provisions for vertical adjustment. Support the screed rails for power-operated screeds on the exterior beams,
 girders, or webs of the structure unless otherwise approved by the Engineer. Obtain the Engineer’s approval if planning to support
 screed rails on the side forms or on any falsework independent of the superstructure.
 Construct screed rails in a manner that will allow vertical adjustment after concrete is placed on concrete deck girders and
 concrete slab span bridges. During concrete placement, check elevations and vertically adjust if necessary.
 A 10 ft modified straightedge is required for Bridge Deck Slabs prior to surface texture regardless of whether diamond
 ground texture planing is specified for the final ride surface. Float slab in accordance with MnDOT Bridge Construction Manual 5
 393.358.
 If an outside webwall of a box girder is under a sidewalk or curb, the Contractor may modify the sidewalk or curb
 reinforcement to accommodate the running rail system for the power strike-off machine as approved by the Engineer and at no
 additional cost to the Department.
 F.3.b(4) Final Finish Texture
 Draw a carpet drag longitudinally along the bridge slab before the concrete attains its initial set to obtain a final finish
 texture. Adjust the carpet drag to produce a texture approved by the Engineer. Use a carpet drag meeting the following
 characteristics and requirements:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 (5)
 (6)
 (7)
 
 Mounted on a work bridge;
 A longitudinal length of 3 ft;
 Width equal to the concrete placed;
 Artificial grass type;
 Molded polyethylene pile face;
 Blade length of from ⅝ inch to 1 inch; and
 Total weight of at least 70 oz per sq. yd.
 
 In lieu of the carpet drag texturing, the Contractor may use coarse broom texturing as approved by the Engineer.
 Texture the roadway surface as approved by the Engineer to produce a final surface serrated, grooved, or roughened
 surface greater than that normally produced by conventional brooming. Do not tear out or loosen particles of coarse aggregate
 during texturing.
 Produce a final surface, including areas near expansion joints, meeting the following requirements:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 250
 
 Free of porous spots and irregularities;
 Have the required crown;
 Does not vary by greater than ⅜ inch on a bridge structural slab when checked with a 10 ft straightedge
 placed longitudinally; and
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2401.3
 (4)
 
 Does not vary by greater than ⅛ inch on a bridge deck slab when checked with a 10 ft straightedge placed
 longitudinally.
 
 Immediately following the carpet drag, texture final roadway surfaces with a metal-tine pattern unless a diamond-ground
 texture is scheduled for the surface as part of the contract. Install the transverse texturing (tining) on a slight diagonal, at an
 angle of approximately 10 degrees to a line perpendicular to the roadway centerline, produced by using a device meeting the
 following characteristics and requirements:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 Equipped with steel tines from 4 inch to 6 inch long and from 1/12 inch to ⅛ inch thick;
 Steel tines arranged to obtain randomized grooves from ⅛ inch to 5/16 inch deep; and
 Variable spacing between tines from ⅝ inch to 1 inch.
 
 The Contractor may use other texturing equipment that will produce an equivalent texture as approved by the Engineer.
 Do not texture within 1 ft of curbs.
 F.3.b(5) Bridge Slab Finish Under Curbs, Concrete Barriers, Sidewalks, and Medians
 Float the top surface of the bridge slab under curbs, concrete barriers, sidewalks, and narrow medians producing a rough
 surface with the coarse aggregate embedded in mortar. Provide a smooth finished strip 2 inches wide at the edge of the slab and
 under the roadway face of curbs, concrete barriers, sidewalks, and narrow medians.
 Choose one of the following alternates to prepare the top surface of the roadway slab directly under island type medians:
 (1)
 (2)
 
 Sandblast or shotblast the slab surface to remove laitance. Apply a cement bonding grout to the concrete
 consisting of Portland cement mixed with water forming a slurry having the consistency of paint before placing
 median concrete. Place median concrete on wet bonding grout.
 Drill and anchor ½ inch diameter epoxy coated reinforcement bars (dowels) into the slab parallel to each
 median gutterline. Place the dowels 1 ft in from the gutterlines at 2 ft centers. Drill the dowels at least
 4 inches into the roadway slab and projecting 4 inches into the median concrete. Anchor the dowels with an
 approved epoxy or approved non-shrink grout.
 
 F.3.b(6) Bridge Slab Finish for Bottom Slab Concrete Box Girders
 Strike off the top surface of the concrete in the bottom slab of concrete box girders and finish to within a ¼ inch
 tolerance when checked with a 10 ft straightedge. The Department will not require additional finishing of this surface.
 F.3.b(7) Surface Smoothness Check
 After completion of the curing period, the Engineer will check the bridge slab surface for trueness, using a 10 ft
 straightedge for transverse and longitudinal checks. The Engineer will perform at least two longitudinal checks in each traffic lane
 and one check at each gutter. Sweep the surface clean of debris before the Engineer performs the checks.
 Correct surfaces outside of the specified tolerance of a 10 ft straightedge in accordance with 2401.3.F.3.b(4), “Final Finish
 Texture,” as required by the Engineer. Mill high spots. Remove concrete in low spots designated for removal to at least 2 in below
 required grade and then recast to the proper grade with an approved product. Restore removed tine texture. The nonconforming
 areas not satisfactorily corrected are subject to 1503, “Conformity with Contract Documents,” and 1512, “Unacceptable and
 Unauthorized Work.”
 Remove high spots before filling adjacent depressions. If not placing a wearing course, coat areas corrected by surface
 grinding with a surface sealer listed on the Approved/Qualified Products List.
 F.3.b(8) Preparation of Bridge Seats
 Construct the bearing seat forms, at time of form setting, within a 0.01ft accuracy of plan elevation as compensated for
 actual bearing heights.
 After bearing seat curing and stripping of forms, grind the bearing areas of bridge seats to produce a level surface that
 does not vary by greater than 1/16 inch from the required plane for steel base plates or by greater than 1/8 inch from the required
 plane for elastomeric bearing pads. The required plane is defined as a level surface at Plan Elevation, bounded by an area over the
 bearing contact dimensions plus 2 inches outside the bearing surface. Plan Elevation is defined as the plan bearing seat elevation
 as adjusted for actual bearing heights.
 After grinding to a horizontal surface, field-survey bearing seats at center of bearing and provide an electronic copy of the
 X and Y coordinates and elevations to the Engineer.
 Adjust bearing seat elevations when the differential between adjacent bearing seats deviates by more than:
 (1)
 (2)
 
 1
 3
 
 /8 inch for steel framing fabricated by "full assembly" as specified in Spec 2471,"Structural Metals";
 /8 inch for all other bridges.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 251
 
 2401.3
 
 The differential between adjacent bearings can be determined as follows:
 Δ = |(Plan Elevation Beam A – Survey Elevation Beam A) – (Plan Elevation Beam B – Survey Elevation Beam B)|
 At a given line of bearing or within the same substructure, produce bearing seats within the following accuracy:
 (1)
 (2)
 
 Seats may be no more than 3/4 inch low from plan elevation for the lowest seat at a given substructure; and
 Seats may be no more than 3/8 inch high from plan elevation for the highest seat at a given substructure.
 
 Tolerances above are superseded by any plan notes. Plan elevation is defined as the plan bearing seat elevation as
 adjusted for actual bearing heights which have been approved by the Engineer.
 Prior to adjusting any bearing seats, submit the proposed method, material specifications, and required adjustment for
 each bearing seat to the Engineer. The Engineer must accept the correction proposal in writing prior to proceeding with any bridge
 seat modifications.
 G
 Concrete Curing and Protection
 Cure newly placed concrete by providing protection against the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 (5)
 (6)
 (7)
 
 Rapid loss of moisture;
 Freezing temperatures;
 High temperatures;
 Abrupt temperature changes;
 Vibration exceeding a normal or reasonable limit as specified in the Bridge Construction Manual,
 Chapter 5-393.362, “Vibration Protection;”
 Shock waves; and
 Prematurely applied loads.
 
 Should any damage result, the Engineer will suspend operations until corrective action is taken and may subject the
 damaged concrete to 1503, "Conformity with Contract Documents," and 1512, "Unacceptable and Unauthorized Work."
 Perform the following for defective sections as directed by the Engineer:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 Remove and replace;
 Remove to a depth as directed by the Engineer and replace; and
 Cover with an approved concrete sealer/overlay.
 
 The Department may reduce payment for defective concrete sections in accordance with 1503, "Conformity with Contract
 Documents." as directed by the Engineer.
 Whenever weather conditions are such as to cause unusual or adverse placing and finishing conditions or equipment
 failures occur, expedite the application of a curing method or temporarily suspend the mixing and placing operations, as the
 conditions require.
 G.1
 Minimum Curing Period
 The Department defines the "curing period" as the time of maintaining satisfactory moisture and temperature in concrete
 during the period immediately following placement through the specified duration, so that hydration of the cement may continue
 until development of the desired properties to a sufficient degree to meet the required service life. In no case, will the concrete
 surface show evidence of drying which includes surface color changes during the curing period.
 Maintain a minimum concrete surface temperature of 40° F or greater during the curing period. If the concrete surface
 temperature drops below 40° F during the curing period, notify the Engineer and make adjustments to the curing to raise the
 surface temperature above 40° F as prescribed in the curing plan. If the concrete surface temperature drops below 40° F during
 the curing period, add one additional day to the minimum curing period for each day the temperature drops below 40° F. Provide
 additional protection as required in accordance with 2401.3.G.5, "Protection Against Cold Weather."
 The Engineer may allow some modification of the requirement for continuous curing without interruption for the purpose
 of setting wall or column forms on footings, but only when the Contractor protects the concrete from freezing or excessive drying
 during the interruption period. Resume curing at the earliest opportunity, and cure until completion of the curing period. If using
 heated enclosures during the curing period, vent heaters and other equipment operated within the enclosure to prevent the buildup
 of carbon dioxide.
 When the plans show a permissible construction joint, the Contractor may begin subsequent concrete placement before
 completion of the curing period, unless otherwise shown on the plans.
 Determine the minimum curing period for a given element in accordance with Table 2401-1 and the following:
 
 252
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2401.3
 (1)
 (2)
 
 (3)
 
 (4)
 
 High early concrete is not allowed to accelerate strength to aid in earlier form removal;
 The Contractor may remove forms for curbs, sidewalks, median barrier, and barriers when the concrete can
 retain its shape and if weather conditions allow the start of the specified concrete finish per 2401.3.F.2.d,
 "Curb, Sidewalk, and Median Finish," immediately after removing the forms. All other forms are required to
 remain in place for at least 24 h after casting the concrete or longer if stripping the forms will damage the
 concrete or prevent disengaging the form ties, unless otherwise noted in Table 2401-1;
 If forms are removed prior to the completion of the curing period, resume 100% curing coverage within 30
 minutes for each formed face. The Engineer may consider revisions to the 30 minute requirement for
 continuous curing based on field conditions, measured evaporation rates, and the submitted curing plan in
 accordance with 2401.3.G.3, "Curing Plan;" and
 Cracking the forms loose the next day is acceptable so long as the concrete surface remains moist for duration
 of curing period.

 * The Engineer will allow the use of curing compounds meeting 3753, "Type 1-D Membrane Curing Compound,"
 provided a letter from the special surface finish manufacturer states the proposed curing compound is compatible with
 the special surface finish. Remove remaining membrane curing compound that has not completely dissipated from the
 surface prior to applying special surface finish. Removal will be required by means of sandblasting, grinding or other
 approved methods.
 G.2.a
 Membrane Curing Method
 Use membrane curing compound meeting the requirements of 3754, "Poly-Alpha Methylsytrene (AMS) Membrane Curing
 Compound," or 3753, "Type 1-D Membrane Curing Compound. Use the same type of curing compound on the entire individual
 element.
 Before application, agitate the curing compound as received in the shipping container to obtain a homogenous mixture.
 Protect membrane curing compounds from freezing before application. Handle and apply the membrane curing compound in
 accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 
 254
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2401.3
 
 Apply the curing compound in accordance with the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 
 (3)
 (4)
 
 At a minimum rate of 1 gal per 150 sq. ft of surface curing area;
 Apply curing compound homogeneously to provide a uniform, solid, white opaque coverage on all exposed
 concrete surfaces (equal to a white sheet of typing paper). If using a Department approved curing compound
 with a non-white base color, apply the compound to provide a uniform, solid, opaque consistency meeting the
 intent of the requirement in this section;
 If the curing compound is damaged during the curing period, immediately repair the damaged area by respraying; and
 If the Engineer determines that the initial or corrective spraying result in unsatisfactory curing, the Engineer
 may require the Contractor to use an alternate curing method, at no additional cost to the Department.
 
 Use an airless spraying machine that complies with the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 A re-circulating bypass system that provides for continuous agitation of the reservoir material;
 Separate filters for the hose and nozzle; and
 Multiple or adjustable nozzle system that provides for variable spray patterns.
 
 G.2.b
 Curing Blanket Method
 After completion of the finishing operations and without marring the concrete, cover the concrete with pre-wetted burlap
 or curing blankets. Install in a manner that envelops the exposed concrete and prevents loss of water vapor.
 Six (6) Mil (minimum) white plastic sheeting over a layer of wet burlap or a wet curing blanket is a method of cure in
 which the loss of mixing water is minimized due to the tight nature of the cover. Install the envelope in accordance with the
 following:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 Overlap the plastic sheeting or burlap or curing blankets a minimum of 12 inches at the seams to maintain a
 reasonably air tight seal. Secure the edges of the sheeting by any means satisfactory to the Engineer to
 provide an air-tight cover;
 On vertical and overhead surfaces they should be held in this position by wire or rope fasteners. They should
 be held in position on roadway and sidewalk slabs by holding down the burlap or blankets with sand or lumber
 at the joints and edges;
 Place burlap or curing blankets in close contact with the concrete and add water as necessary to assure that
 the concrete surface is moist at all times; and
 When using the curing blanket method over areas where reinforcement is exposed use one of the following
 methods:
 (a)
 Place wet burlap or wet curing blankets in the exposed area, drape plastic over the tops of the
 reinforcement, and weigh down the plastic adjacent to the exposed areas; or
 (b)
 Puncture the plastic sheeting and place it directly over the burlap or curing blankets with the
 reinforcement projecting through the plastic sheeting. Do not allow the burlap or curing blankets to
 dry out during the curing period.
 
 G.2.c
 Wet Curing Method
 Cover the surface of the concrete with pre-wetted burlap as soon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently to prevent
 marring the surface. Pre-soak the burlap for a minimum of 12 hours prior to placement. Overlap the burlap a minimum of 12
 inches. The Engineer will not allow the application of dry burlap and then sprayed down with water as an acceptable wet cure
 method.
 Overlap spray with soaker hoses or sprinklers to keep all unformed surfaces continuously wet for the minimum curing
 period, unless another curing method is used. Use water for curing in accordance with 3906, "Water for Concrete and Mortar."
 Limit the amount of water applied to the amount that will keep the concrete wet without running sheets or streams. If
 the concrete surface shows evidence of erosion by the curing water, the Engineer will immediately suspend the spraying or fogging.
 Remedy the conditions causing erosion or switch to another cure method that does not involve continuous wet cure.
 If the national weather service forecast for the construction area predicts air temperatures to fall below 32° F within the
 next 24 hours, suspend conventional wet curing and switch to another acceptable curing method.
 G.2.d
 Formed Curing Method
 When forms are left in direct contact with the concrete, other curing methods are not required except for exposed
 surfaces and for cold weather protection. Use another acceptable curing method if forms are removed prior to completion of the
 minimum curing period.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications

 Method and frequency for verifying no surface drying is occurring;
 Quality control person(s) name(s) for ensuring cure is maintained according to curing plan;
 Coverage rate, tint color, and dry film thickness for any membrane curing compounds;
 Special surface finish manufacturer letter stating conditions for placing special surface finish over any
 membrane curing compounds products;
 Method to maintain a minimum concrete surface temperature of 40° F or greater during the curing period.
 Action plan to restore surface temperature should the temperature drop below 40° F;
 If cold weather conditions are anticipated during the project, submit a cold weather concrete protection in
 accordance with 2401.3.G.5, "Protection Against Cold Weather"; and
 If it is anticipated that continuous curing will be interrupted for more than 30 minutes, include a table stating
 what expected weather conditions at time of form removal and applicable curing requirements are necessary to
 ensure a maximum evaporation rate of 0.3/lb/sq ft/hr is not exceeded in accordance with figure 2401-1; and
 
 For each structural element, complete the MnDOT Concrete Curing QC Form (located at:
 www.dot.state.mn.us/bridge/construction). Submit completed forms to the Engineer within seven (7) calendar days of completing
 the structural element.
 Failure to adhere to the Engineer accepted Contractor’s curing plan or observation of any surface drying during the curing
 period will result in a curing qualification period as follows:
 (1)
 
 For the next three concrete placements, as determined by the Engineer, of similar construction the forms are to
 remain in place for the minimum curing period; and
 
 (2)
 
 Once curing period is complete, demonstrate the curing plan procedures in the presence of the Engineer prior
 to reinstating the curing plan on new work.
 
 G.4
 Protection Against Rain
 Protect the concrete from damage due to rain or snow. Have available, near the site of the work, materials for protection
 of the edges and surface of the concrete. Should any damage result, the Engineer will suspend operations until corrective action is
 taken and may subject the rain or snow damaged concrete to 1503, "Conformity with Contract Documents," and 1512,
 "Unacceptable and Unauthorized Work." Do not start concrete placement when it is raining or snowing.
 G.5
 Protection Against Cold Weather

 (1)
 (2)
 
 October 1 to April 15 when working north of the 46th parallel; and
 October 15 to April 15 when working south of the 46th parallel.
 
 The Engineer will not permit the membrane curing method during the dates specified herein.
 The Engineer will base anticipated concrete placement and curing temperatures on weather forecasts or on typical
 temperature data for the time of year at the location of the structure.
 Preheat the forms, in-place concrete, reinforcement bars, and items including the top flanges of beams to a minimum of
 40° F when the temperatures of these surface areas are below freezing before placing concrete. Do not apply flames directly to
 concrete or steel.
 Provide insulated forms, insulation, or heating and housing facilities to maintain a concrete surface temperature of
 between 60° F and 120° F during the curing period. The Engineer may allow the concrete surface temperature of between 50° F
 and 120° F for concrete with strengths equal to or greater than 6000 psi.
 Protect all exposed concrete surfaces within the heated enclosures from drying and carbonation throughout the curing
 period by using one of the acceptable curing methods:
 (1)
 (2)
 
 Vent the heated enclosures to prevent the buildup of carbon dioxide; or
 Ensure a reasonably uniform temperature throughout the enclosure.
 
 Keep the forms, insulation, and housing enclosure in place until the completion of cold weather protection as defined in
 2401.3.G, “Concrete Curing and Protection.”

 Provide straight steel members of adequate strength for the intended use.
 Maintain the falsework in place until after permanent bolting of the field connection is complete and the Professional
 Engineer certifying the falsework erection approves the release of falsework supports. Remove falsework in accordance with 2401,
 “Concrete Bridge Construction.”
 Except for attachment of screed rail support pipes, do not weld on primary stress-carrying members of the bridge
 structure to fasten appurtenances not shown on the plans or on the approved detail drawings. The Contractor may weld screed rail
 support pipes to the top flange with ¼ inch longitudinal fillet welds no greater than 2 inches long. Do not weld in the negative
 moment area, as shown on the plans as “Area A,” of the top flange of primary stress-carrying members of the bridge structure.

 Field Fit-Up
 
 F.1
 Erection Plans, Stability and Safety
 Erect structural steel members in a manner that will provide safety to the workers, inspectors, and the public at all time,
 and without damaging the steel members. Temporarily anchor, brace, and stabilize primary members, such as beams and girders,
 as erected to prevent sliding, tipping, buckling, or other movement, before placing diaphragms.
 If the plans show active vehicular or railroad traffic to travel beneath beams before the complete erection of the beams
 and diaphragms in a span, submit an erection plan to the Engineer detailing the temporary works required to brace and stabilize
 beams. Have the erection plan prepared by a Professional Engineer, checked by a second Professional Engineer for completeness
 and accuracy, and certified by one of the Professional Engineers.
 The erection plan will specify the required bolt tension and the numbers of bolts to install in permanent diaphragm
 connections and in bracing to stabilize the beam. Use struts, bracing, tie cables, and other devices used for temporary restraint of a
 size and strength capable of withstanding the stresses developed. Erect and brace at least two adjacent beams or girders, including
 diaphragms and fully tightened bolts, in any one span before suspending operations for the day.
 F.2
 Assembly
 A primary member is defined as any member that carries the primary stresses of the structure. Beams and girders are
 always primary members unless otherwise noted. When the contract requires full assembly, cross frames and diaphragms are then
 considered primary members.
 members.
 
 Erect primary members using at least 25% pins and 25% snug tight erection bolts in connections to other primary
 
 During erection of steel structures the timeframe for when permanent bolting may begin changes with various situations.
 The structure type, how it was fabricated, and the means and methods utilized during erection all affect this requirement.
 Fabrication utilizes either "line assembly" or "full assembly" practices to position, locate and build structural bolted connections.
 F.2.a
 Permanent Bolting - Line Assembly
 The Department defines "line assembly" as the method by which the structure was fabricated building the structure one
 girder line at a time. It identifies that the structure has had the girder splices drilled with standard size holes in a "no load"
 condition. It also identifies that all secondary transverse members (e.g. diaphragms) are connected with oversize holes and have
 not been subject to preassembly.
 When the contract requires line assembly, do not start permanent bolting of diaphragms to lateral bracing until:
 (1)
 
 For simple spans: two adjacent lines are installed.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 265
 
 2402.3
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 For continuous spans: girder lines are supported by three points of bearing and all girder field splices are
 completed on both lines in the adjacent span(s).
 Temporary shoring with elevation adjusted to as-drilled elevation is an eligible point of bearing for erection
 purposes.
 See Figure 2.a below for conceptual illustration of requirements prior to permanent bolting.
 
 Figure 2.a: Plan view showing framing fabricated in Line Assembly and erection requirements prior to Permanent Bolting
 (without shoring towers)
 F.2.b
 Permanent Bolting - Full Assembly
 The Department defines "full assembly" as the method by which the structure was fabricated. It identifies that the
 structure has had all holes (including transverse members) drilled standard size in a "no load" assembled condition. Field erection
 practices are required to erect the steel in a manner consistent with how it was fabricated and not induce secondary stresses.
 When the contract requires full assembly, do not start permanent bolting of diaphragms to lateral bracing until:
 (1)
 For simple spans, all girder lines have been erected;
 (2)
 For continuous spans, girder lines are supported by at least three points of bearing, all girders in the span are
 erected, and all field splices are completed in the span(s) immediately adjacent to the span in question; and
 (3)
 See Figure 2.b below for conceptual illustration of requirements prior to permanent bolting without the use of
 shoring towers.
 
 Figure 2.b: Plan view showing framing fabricated in Full Assembly and erection requirements prior to Permanent Bolting
 (without shoring towers)
 
 266
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2402.3
 F.2.c
 Permanent Bolting - With shoring towers
 An exception to the requirements in F.2.a and F.2.b is allowed where shoring towers are used without interruption to
 correct alignment, camber, grade, and skew. Shoring towers that are fully supporting the members in the no-load position allow
 permanent bolting before all girders in the span are erected. Field elevation of shoring tower shall be adjusted to the "as drilled"
 condition which takes into account the shop blocking elevations and any vertical tolerances used in the fabrication assembly. For
 this exception, permanent bolting may begin when both girder lines are supported at three permanent bearing points and field
 splices are completed on both lines of the adjacent span (s). See Figure 2 c below for conceptual illustration of requirements prior
 to permanent bolting with the use of shoring towers.
 
 Figure 2.c: Plan view showing framing fabricated in Full or Line Assembly and erection requirements prior to Permanent
 Bolting (with shoring towers)
 F.2.d
 Ground Splices
 The Engineer may allow permanent bolting of field splices in beams for continuous spans on the ground before full
 assembly of adjacent spans, provided the beams to be spliced are positioned on firmly supported blocking at ¼ points of each
 girder, then adjusted and surveyed to confirm the alignment, camber, grade, and skew match those established in the fabrication.
 Before setting beams for ground splicing, present the survey results to the engineer confirming blocking matches the fabricated
 condition. Pin ground spliced beams with at least 25% pins and 25% snug tight bolts and present to the Engineer before
 permanent bolting. Primary member splice connections that are made up on the ground before erection shall be fully tensioned
 and inspected, in the no-load condition, prior to any lifting operation.
 F.3
 Pinning and Bolting
 For purposes of this provision, bolt types are defined as follows:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 Permanent bolts are placed prior to placing the concrete deck and fully tensioned per 2402.3.G.2, "Connections
 using high strength bolts". These bolts are used to maintain both final geometry and strength of the
 connection throughout the service life of the bridge.
 Erection bolts are used to hold connecting members in "snug tight" contact and in correct position during all
 bolting operations in conjunction with erection pins. These bolts should be the same diameter as the
 permanent bolts.
 Installation bolts are used to hold the pieces of the connection prior to installing erection pins and cannot be
 used in the permanent connection.
 
 Permanent bolts may be used as erection bolts provided they remain in a condition matching the as-manufactured
 condition and have not been previously tensioned. ASTM F3125 Grade A325 bolts may be re-tightened in the original location once,
 provided the bolt shows no evidence of permanent elongation, and a nut can easily be spun up to the shank of the bolt.
 Provide erection bolts in the same diameter as the permanent connectors. Do not use erection pins larger than the
 diameter of the hole or smaller than the hole diameter minus 0.030 inches. Use erection washers with erection bolts.
 Pins are considered effective for load transfer and geometry control, and erection bolts for maintaining tight steel.
 Snug tight is defined as the minimal use of an impact wrench or the full effort of an adult using an ordinary spud wrench
 to bring all plies of the connection together in firm contact. The term "snug tight" is interchangeable with the field term of "tight
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 267
 
 2402.3
 steel". Prior to beginning permanent bolting, use enough bolts tightened to a snug tight condition to bring all parts of the joint into
 full contact.
 Use the following pinning and bolting sequence on all primary stress-carrying members, for establishing the "assembled
 connection":
 (1)
 Install a minimum number of installation bolts to hold the pieces of the connection together during pin
 installation. Tension of installation bolts must not restrict alignment of the connection;
 (2)
 Install erection pins in 25% of the total number of holes in the connection. Balance the distribution of the pins
 throughout the connection. With regard to load transfer, a portion of pins may be substituted with erection
 bolts under the following conditions:
 a.
 The Erection Engineer, who is a Minnesota registered Professional Engineer, submits signed
 calculations to the Engineer demonstrating the connection forces during erection may be sustained
 by the proposed number of pins or be resisted in slip by prescribed number of tensioned erection
 bolts,
 b.
 All written comments to the calculations are addressed to the satisfaction of the Engineer, and
 c.
 This exception does not eliminate the need for some amount of pins for the purpose of geometry
 control.
 (3)
 Install erection bolts in a minimum of 25% of the total number of holes in the connection. Balance the
 distribution of the bolts throughout the connection. Tighten the erection bolts to a snug tight condition.
 Shipping bolts and installation bolts don’t count toward the erection bolt percentage requirement;
 (4)
 Where required by the Erection Engineer and authorized by the Engineer, tension erection bolts necessary to
 sustain connection slip resistance. When live loads are carried during erection, use additional bolts and erection
 pins to compensate for the additional loads; and
 (5)
 Remove installation bolts installed in step (1).
 Check bearing plates and assemblies for contact before placing the permanent connectors. Correct deviations from full
 bearing between parts, or between the bridge seat and the bearing plates as approved by the Engineer. Readjust diaphragms,
 cross frames, or splice plates, if required to correct deviations. For extreme deviations, the Engineer may direct re-cambering or
 other re-fabrication procedures. The Contractor may use properly shaped and sized fills or shims to correct minor deviations as
 approved by the Engineer.
 Make adjustments to erected sections prior to permanent bolting to meet the following requirements:
 (1)
 Maximum deviation from Plan horizontal alignment is ±1/8 inch x (total length along the girder, in feet, between
 supports)/10. Shift the spans if required to correct for alignment, skew, and proper anchorage and expansion
 device locations; and
 (2)
 Maximum deviation from Plan camber (elevation) is – 0 inch, + 1/4 inch x (total length, in feet, from the nearest
 support)/10. Modify camber and field splice plan elevations to account for as-built bearing seat elevation as
 necessary.
 The Contractor will survey the top of beams at the centerline of bearing and centerline of field splice locations. Provide
 an electronic copy of the X and Y coordinates and elevations to the Engineer. The Engineer will review the survey prior to
 authorizing permanent bolting.
 Permanent bolting will be authorized after the Contractor meets the erection tolerances and has addressed all written
 comments by the Engineer. Proceed with permanent bolting at any primary member connection as follows:
 (1)
 Install permanent connectors in open connection holes. Tighten the permanent connectors in accordance with
 2402.3.G.2.c(1);
 (2)
 Tighten bolts systematically working from the most rigid part of the connection to the free edges, in a manner
 that will minimize relaxation of previously tightened bolts;
 (3)
 Tighten fasteners by holding the head of the bolt and turning the nut; and
 (4)
 Remove pins and any erection bolts not qualified as permanent connectors individually. After removal of an
 erection pin or erection bolt, replace with a permanent connector and tension before continuing.
 Where DTI’s are used, perform quality control on permanent bolt tensioning before presenting to the Engineer for final
 inspection.
 Perform permanent connector tensioning within 10 days after initial installation as exposure to the elements affects their
 rotational capacity test characteristics. Permanent connectors installed for more than 10 days or if exposure has affected the
 rotational capacity test characteristics of the assembly, the permanent connectors will need to be removed and re-lubricated. New
 Rotational Capacity tests will need to be performed on each lot combination of re-lubricated bolt assemblies.
 F.4
 Pin Assemblies
 Before assembling pins, coat pins and pinholes, including pinholes with bronze bushings, with a “Bridge Grease” as listed
 on the Approved/Qualified Products List.
 
 268
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2402.3
 Draw pin nuts tight, except for pin nuts with cotter keys. Upset the exposed thread at the face of the nut by center
 punching to prevent back off. If tightening pin nuts with cotter keys ensure the cotter key can be freely inserted and the pin is free
 to turn without binding under the Lomas nut.
 F.5
 Construction Elevations
 After all permanent connections have been tensioned and inspected in accordance with 2402.3.G.2.d, "Inspection," take
 elevations at top of beams under steel dead load only deflections. Take elevations at five foot increments along the centerline of
 the beam starting at each centerline of bearing and proceeding up station. Restart five foot increment at each centerline of bearing
 for continuous spans.
 Allow for total dead load deflections as shown in the Plan to enable building forms to the correct grade and specified slab
 thickness. Provide a copy of the elevations to the Engineer.
 For long, multiple span, continuous bridges, the Contractor may request in writing to take elevations prior to tensioning
 and inspection of all permanent connections. Provide the Engineer with the following items:
 (1)
 Certified plans and specifications for the erection sequence;
 (2)
 Calculations to verify strength, stability, and deflections at tenth points and field section ends for each stage of
 the erection sequence; and
 (3)
 Designer should work with Bridge Construction Engineer to develop any additional deliverables required.
 
 G
 Connections
 Connections, including fill plates and shims, must be clean and undamaged so as not to impact the design slip criteria.
 Do not damage paint and maintain the appropriate thickness to meet compliance for the designed slip coefficient. Unless the
 contract requires or the Engineer approves otherwise, provide field connections made with high strength bolts or pin bolts.
 G.1
 Welded Connections
 Weld field connections in accordance with 2471, “Structural Metals.”
 G.2
 
 Connections Using High Strength Bolts
 
 G.2.a
 General
 Install bolts with heads outward for the webs of fascia girders. Install bolts with heads downward for the flanges of
 beams and girders spanning highways, streets, roadways, and walkways.
 G.2.b
 Bolted Parts
 Ensure the slope of surfaces of bolted parts in contact with the bolt head and nut is no greater than 1:20 with respect to
 a plane normal to the bolt axis. Assemble bolted parts to fit solidly together. Do not separate bolted parts by gaskets or other
 interposed compressible material.
 Assemble joint surfaces, including those adjacent to the bolt heads, nuts, or washers, free of the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 (5)
 (6)
 
 Scale, except tight mill scale;
 Dirt;
 Loose scale;
 Burrs;
 Other foreign material; and
 Other defects preventing solid seating of the parts.
 
 Ensure contact surfaces of friction-type joints are free of coating materials such as oil, galvanizing, and rust inhibitors.

 Installation
 
 G.2.c(1) Bolt Tension
 Clean contaminants and corrosion from the threaded portions of bolts and nuts, before installing. Lubricate and dye nuts
 in accordance with 3391, “Fasteners.”
 Use the turn-of-nut or direct tension indicator method to tighten nuts on threaded bolts.
 If using impact wrenches, provide wrenches capable of performing the required tightening of each bolt in 10 seconds.
 Tighten each fastener to provide the minimum bolt tension shown in Table 2402-1 when all fasteners in the joint are
 tight:

 G.2.c(2) Washers
 Provide fasteners with a hardened washer placed under the nut or bolt head being turned during tightening.
 Provide high strength bolts with a hardened washer under the bolt head and the nut if used in conjunction with full sized
 punched holes.
 If an outer face of the bolted parts has a slope greater than 1:20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis, use a
 smooth beveled washer to compensate for the lack of parallelism.
 G.2.c(3) Direct Tension Indicator (DTI) Tightening
 When using DTIs to provide the minimum bolt tensions in Table 2402-1, install the indicators, including snug tight fit-up,
 as recommended by the manufacturer except for the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 Insert a hardened flat washer between the DTI and fastener if bolting through a short-slotted or oversized hole
 in accordance with 2471.3.H.1.a, “Line Assembly;”
 If installing a DTI under the turned element, use a hardened washer to separate the turned element from the
 DTI meeting the requirements of AASHTO LRFD Bridge Construction Specification 11.5.6.4.7;
 Provide compressible washer-type indicators meeting the requirements of ASTM F959; and
 Inspect DTIs as recommended by the manufacturer, except as modified in G.2.d(3).
 
 G.2.c(4) Turn-of-Nut Tightening
 The Department defines “snug tight” as the minimal use of an impact wrench or the full effort of an adult using an
 ordinary spud wrench to bring all plies of the connection together in firm contact. Use enough bolts tightened to a “snug tight”
 condition to bring all parts of the joint into full contact. Complete the initial operation in accordance with 2402.3.F, “Field Fit-up.”
 Place bolts in the remaining holes in the connection and snug tight. Match mark and additionally tighten nuts and bolts by the
 amount of nut rotation specified in this section, and progress with tightening systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to
 its free edges. Do not rotate the part not turned by the wrench.
 For coarse thread heavy hexagon structural bolts and heavy hexagon semi-finished nuts, rotate nuts from snug tight
 condition in accordance with the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 If both faces are normal to bolt axis (with or without use of beveled washers), rotate nuts ⅓ turn for bolt
 lengths no greater than 4 diameters, ½ turn for bolt lengths greater than 4 diameters to 8 diameters, and
 ⅔ turn for bolt lengths greater than 8 diameters to 12 diameters.
 If one face is normal and the other is sloped no greater than 1:20 (beveled washers not used), rotate nuts
 ½ turn for bolt lengths no greater than 4 diameters, ⅔ turn for bolt lengths greater than 4 diameters to
 8 diameters, and 5/6 turn for bolt lengths greater than 8 diameters to 12 diameters.
 If both faces are sloped no greater than 1:20 (beveled washers not used), rotate nuts ⅔ turn for bolt lengths
 no greater than 4 diameters, 5/6 turn for bolt diameters from 4 diameters to 8 diameters and, 1 turn for bolt
 lengths from 8 diameters to 12 diameters.
 
 Measure bolt length from the underside of head to extreme end of the bolt. Measure nut rotation as relative to bolt
 regardless of the element (nut or bolt) being turned. Rotate nuts within the allowable tolerance of 1/6 turn over and zero rotation
 under the rotation specified in list items (1), (2), and (3) above.
 G.2.d
 Inspection
 The Engineer will observe the installation and tightening of bolts to determine that the tightening procedure and bolt
 tightening tensions comply with the requirements in this section. The Engineer will inspect the bolt tension in accordance with the
 following procedure unless otherwise specified:
 G.2.d(1) Calibration of Inspection Wrench
 Provide a manual inspection wrench calibrated in accordance with the following:
 Test each combination of bolt production lot, nut lot, and washer lot as an assembly. Test 3 assemblies per combination.
 Individually place bolts of the same grade, size, and condition, as the bolts under inspection in a calibration device (i.e. Skidmore
 
 270
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2402.3
 Willhelm) capable of indicating bolt tension. Place a washer under the part turned in tightening each bolt. Provide test bolts in the
 same length as the bolts used in the structure.
 Tighten each test bolt in the calibration device to an initial condition equal to 15 percent of the specified bolt tension and
 then to the minimum tension specified for its size in accordance with Table 2402-1, “Bolt Tension.” Apply the inspecting wrench to
 the tightened bolt and turn the nut or head 5 degrees, or 1 inch at 12 inch radius in the tightening direction. Measure the torque
 applied. Average the torque as measured in the tests of 3 bolts and use this “job-inspecting torque” in accordance with
 2402.3.G.2.d(3), “Inspection Procedure for Direct Tension Indicators (DTI).”
 Provide the inspection wrench and the bolt tension-indicating device as specified in this section. Allow the Engineer to
 witness the prescribed calibration tests.
 During calibration in accordance with 2402.3.G.2.d(1), ensure the bolt and nut withstand rotation to two times the
 number of turns as specified in 2402.3.G.2.c(4), “Turn-of-Nut Tightening,” without showing visible evidence of stripping the threads
 or failure of the bolt or nut.
 G.2.d(2) Inspection Procedure for Calibrated Wrench
 At the Engineer’ option, either the Engineer or the Contractor in the Engineer’s presence may operate the inspecting
 wrench as follows:
 (1)
 (2)
 
 Inspect the tightened bolts in the structure by applying, in the tightened direction, the inspecting wrench and
 its job-inspecting torque to a randomly selected 10 percent of the bolts or at least 2 bolts in each connection.
 Accept connections as properly tightened if nut or bolt heads do not turn when applying the job-inspecting
 torque as indicated in item (1) above. If a nut or bolt head turns during the application of job-inspecting
 torque, apply the job-inspecting torque to all bolts in the connection. Retighten and re-inspect nuts or bolt
 heads turned by the job-inspecting torque. The Contractor may retighten the bolts in the connection and
 resubmit the connection for the specified inspection procedure.
 
 G.2.d(3) Inspection Procedure for Direct Tension Indicators (DTI)
 Check the performance of the DTIs in the field before bolting.
 Use the gap between the protrusions to indicate the tension in the bolt.
 Furnish the Engineer with one feeler gauge per 50 DTIs prior to commencing bolting.
 Notify the Engineer after the completion of each activity:
 (1)
 Initial snugging;
 (2)
 Final tightening; and
 (3)
 Verification checks.
 Provide accommodation for the Engineer to check DTIs at any time during or after completion of snugging or final
 tightening. Department personnel will not be required to accompany the Contractor during tightening.
 At the Engineer’s option, either the Engineer or the Contractor in the Engineer’s presence may operate the tapered leaf
 thickness (feeler) gauge within the procedures below.
 Use the following procedure for inspection of bolting operations with DTIs:
 (1)
 An initial visual inspection of the DTIs after the bolts are snug tight. Remove and replace DTIs completely
 crushed during snugging;
 (2)
 Ensure the DTI protrusions are oriented away from the steel member surfaces;
 (3)
 After pretensioning, place a feeler gauge into a randomly selected 10 percent of the DTIs and at least 2 DTIs in
 each connection to inspect the tightened bolts in the structure. Measure the gap between the washer and the
 bolt head in the spaces between the protrusions using the 0.005 inch tapered leaf thickness (feeler) gauge.
 Inspect the DTIs as recommended by the manufacturer with the exception of a minimum of 1 entry by the
 feeler gauge shall be satisfied. Do not tighten DTIs beyond crushing of the protrusion. The number of
 inspected DTI’s will increase at a rate of ten times the number of failures up to 100% inspection;
 (4)
 If the feeler gauge can be inserted into more than one-half of the spaces between the protrusions of a DTI,
 retighten the bolt and retest. There is no allowance for DTIs not satisfying the inspection requirements of DTIs
 as recommended by the manufacturer, except as modified in condition (3) above; and
 (5)
 If the feeler gauge cannot be inserted into any of the spaces between the protrusions of more than 10 percent
 of DTI in an individual connection during the inspection, replace the affected bolts until less than 10 percent of
 all DTIs in the connection satisfy condition (3) above. Bolts satisfying all of the following conditions do not
 count towards the 10 percent allowance:
 
 The bolt is subsequently tightened in the presence of the Engineer,
 
 The bolt shows no evidence of extensive elongation or fully crushing all the protrusions.

 Provide a device capable of indicating the actual bolt tension to test the pin bolts before use. Provide at least 3 typical
 bolts of each size and length for tests from the supply of bolts used in the work. Test other bolts during the bolting operation, as
 directed by the Engineer. Use the same installation tool used for tightening and swaging the bolts for the field connections to apply
 tension in the bolts during the testing procedures.
 Recover the expendable pin tails from the driving tool as the pin tails break from the bolt. Do not allow expendable pin
 tails from the driving tool to drop and create hazards.
 Obtain the Engineer’s approval of the testing and installation procedures for pin bolts.

 emissions.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 279
 
 2404.3
 
 After blasting, hand sweep or use a “pickup” type power sweeper equipped with adequate dust storage capacity to sweep
 the prepared surface. Remove minor debris remaining after the sweeping operation by air blasting. Provide an air supply system
 with an oil trap placed in the air supply line between the storage tank and the nozzle.
 Shotblast, sweep, and clean the bridge structural slab before placing the concrete wearing course. Allow time for the
 Engineer to inspect the surface during daylight hours.
 After shotblasting the surface, the Engineer will perform a visual inspection of the bridge deck, and locate all cracks
 appearing on the top surface. Furnish only one of the materials listed on the Department's "Approved/Qualified Product List of
 Bridge Surface and Crack Sealers," (www.dot.state.mn.us/products/bridge). Fill all located cracks with an approved crack sealer
 following the manufacturer's recommendations, and as otherwise directed by the Engineer. Ensure the sealer is cured prior to
 preceding pre-wetting of the deck, as required for placement of a low slump concrete wearing course.
 Control the application of the crack sealer such that the maximum width of crack sealant does not exceed ¾ inch. If
 exceeding the permitted width of ¾ inch, remove excess by means of surface grinding to prevent debonding of concrete wearing
 course.
 Furnishing and placing the sealer on new structural slabs as specified above will be considered to be incidental work for
 which no direct compensation will be made. Payment for sealing cracks in existing bridge deck slabs getting a new low slump
 wearing course as provided for in the special provisions.
 Within 12 h of placing the concrete wearing course, use potable water to pre-wet the deck surface to a saturated surface
 dry condition (not absorbing water from or contributing water to the concrete mixture). Maintain the saturated surface dry
 condition for at least 6 h. Do not allow free water on the surface when placing the bonding agent as stated in 2404.2.B, “Bonding
 Grout.”
 D
 Concrete Placement and Texturing
 Place and finish concrete at a linear rate, measured parallel to the centerline of the bridge, of at least 40 ft per h under
 normal working conditions. Do not place concrete wearing course placement widths greater than 24 ft, unless otherwise shown in
 the special provisions.
 Place joints in the concrete wearing course directly above the original joints constructed in the bridge structural slab and
 in accordance with 2401.3.E, “Joint Construction.” Make saw cuts as soon as the concrete can be cut without raveling the surface
 and expeditiously to minimize the exposure of the uncured concrete to surface drying. Seal saw cuts with joint sealer in accordance
 with 3723, “Hot-Poured, Elastic Type Joint and Crack Sealer,” or 3725, “Hot-Poured, Extra-Low Modulus, Elastic-Type Joint and
 Crack Sealer.”
 After consolidating, screeding, and floating the concrete, draw a carpet drag longitudinally along the pavement before the
 concrete attains its initial set. Adjust the carpet drag to produce a texture as approved by the Engineer.
 Use artificial grass type carpet drag meeting the following characteristics and requirements:
 (1)

 position, angle of tilt, and shape of the crown. Equip the finishing machine with an adjustable power-operated paddle or auger to
 strike off concrete in front of the first screed.
 E.3
 Concrete Placement
 Scrub the bonding grout into the deck surface and adjacent contact points at a controlled rate (based on field conditions)
 to prevent drying before covering with the concrete wearing course.
 Mechanically strike off the concrete slightly above final grade before consolidating and screeding to final grade.
 Saw the wearing course at transverse and longitudinal joints to a straight, vertical edge. Remove trimmings before
 placing the adjacent wearing course. Do not operate impact equipment in the adjacent lane during the first 72 h after placing the
 concrete unless otherwise approved in writing by the Engineer. Use thinned bonding grout to seal vertical joints with adjacent
 inplace concrete surfaces after finishing and texturing to assure the vertical joint is sealed.
 E.4
 Curing Requirements

 Before application, agitate the curing compound in the shipping containers to obtain a homogeneous mixture. Apply the
 compound to provide a uniform, solid white opaque coverage equal to a white sheet of paper on exposed concrete surfaces.
 Respray areas that appear to have a coating that is less than a white sheet of paper. Respray membrane film damaged before the
 placement of the wet cure.
 Apply the membrane curing within 45 min after depositing concrete if revibrating the concrete as directed by the
 Engineer. If the Contractor fails to apply membrane curing in the required time after depositing concrete, the Department will
 consider this as unacceptable work in accordance with 1512, “Unacceptable and Unauthorized Work.” Remove and replace
 concrete in areas not coated with membrane curing compound within the required time at no additional cost to the Department.
 As soon as the concrete can be walked on without damage, place wet burlap or curing blankets in accordance with
 2401.3.G, “Concrete Curing and Protection,” for a minimum of 4 days. Maintain burlap in a wet condition for the entire curing
 period.
 After completion of the wearing course curing period, the Engineer will perform a visual inspection of the wearing course,
 and will locate all cracks appearing on the top surface. Furnish only one of the materials listed on the Department's
 Approved/Qualified Product List of "Bridge Surface and Crack Sealers". Fill all located cracks with an approved crack sealer
 following the manufacturer's recommendations, and as otherwise directed by the Engineer prior to opening the bridge to vehicular
 traffic.
 Furnishing and placing the sealer as specified above will be considered to be incidental work for which no direct
 compensation will be made
 Do not allow vehicular traffic on the concrete wearing course during the 4 day curing period. If the daily mean
 temperatures during the 4 day curing period fall below 60° F, provide additional curing time before allowing traffic on the surface as
 required by the Engineer.
 2404.4 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 The Engineer will measure the concrete wearing course by surface area based on the dimensions shown on the plans.

 (4)
 PCI Manual for Quality Control: Precast and Prestressed Concrete.
 A
 General
 The State Materials Engineer is the Engineer with authority concerning all matters of plant fabrication and inspection prior
 to delivery of the materials to the project. The Engineer has authority concerning all matters of fabrication at the project site.
 Submit a written notification to the Engineer immediately after placing orders for prestressed concrete beams. Include
 the name and address of the supplier and the beam manufacturing location.
 Notify the Materials Engineer at least 7 calendar days beforebeginning manufacturing operations. If the Contractor casts
 the beams at the bridge site, notify the Engineer at least 7 calendar days before casting to permit inspection of the forms and
 reinforcement.
 If casting the beams at a plant away from the bridge site, provide an office in accordance with 2031.3.A, “Basic
 Requirements,” with air conditioning and access to sanitary facilities. The Department will not require laboratory space.
 If, on any day, the Department inspects beam casting at a plant away from the bridge site and less than two beams are
 cast, the Department will deduct from any monies due or becoming due to the Contractor the total cost of inspection for that day.
 Ensure the Fabricator's quality control office maintains documentation containing the data required by the specifications
 and the State Materials Engineer. This documentation shall contain test data and measurements taken at times and locations
 approved by the Engineer, assuring that monitoring, by personnel not directly involved in production, is sufficient to ensure
 compliance with approved procedures.
 If the Materials Engineer's review of fabrication work discloses that approved procedures are not being followed, the
 Fabricator shall immediately correct the procedure.
 The Materials Engineer will determine what additional testing work must be done by the Fabricator or, if necessary, what
 part of the work must be repaired or replaced if fabrication work is not properly monitored and documented by the Fabricator.
 Any and all costs of required additional monitoring and testing shall be at the expense of the Contractor with no
 additional compensation.Provide a PCI Level II Certified Technician on site at the start of fabrication and throughout fabrication of
 the prestressed beams. Provide PCI Level I Certified Technicians to perform quality control functions. Provide a PCI Level II

 Take precautions to prevent contamination of prestressing steel with oil, dirt, or other deleterious substances and to
 prevent damage that may result in weakening the prestressing steel that may result in its failure under stress. The Materials
 Engineer may reject nicked or kinked prestressing steel. Do not allow sparks or pieces of molten metal from welding or burning
 equipment to contact the prestressing steel. Do not use prestressing steel as a ground for welding equipment.
 Galvanize all steel inserts or devices that will be within 1 in of the exposed surface of the finished structure. Galvanize or
 coat with zinc-rich primer all other steel inserts or devices included in the beam.
 B
 Forms
 Provide forms designed to withstand pressure from concrete, vibration, and impact without distortion. Set and maintain
 forms mortar tight, free of warp, and on a rigid foundation. Set the side form at right angles to the vertical axis of the beam and
 with the plane of bearing surfaces flat and true. Set side forms during casting as shown on the plans. Maintain side forms during
 casting until the concrete sets. Provide a tight fit without offset for joints in sectional forms.
 Set forms for prestressed concrete beams so the dimensions of the beam after prestress transfer will conform to the plan
 dimensions in accordance with 2405.3.H, “Tolerances.”
 Treat the face of the forms in contact with the concrete with form coating material in accordance with 3902, “Form
 Coating Material,” before setting the form in position. Clean the forms of accumulations of oil and other substances before use.
 Provide beam end blocks as shown on the plans. The Contractor may increase the length of the end blocks as much as
 12 in to accommodate sectional forms. Provide end blocks of the same length for beams of the same length in any one span.
 C
 Steel Units
 Place, support, and tie reinforcement bars for prestressed concrete beams in accordance with 2472, “Metal
 Reinforcement.”
 Cover the reinforcement bars with concrete at least 1 in thick.
 Set sole plates for prestressed beams so that after prestress transfer the sole plate locations match the plan locations
 within the tolerance specified for the plan length of pretensioned beams. Place the sole plates in contact with the bottom form.
 Maintain position of the sole plates during placement of concrete.
 Position floor drains as shown on the plans. Fasten the floor drains to the forms to ensure that concrete placement does
 not alter the alignment or location.
 Remove loose rust, dirt, oil, and other foreign substances from prestressing tendons before erecting the beam side forms.
 The Contractor may construct hold-down devices for deflected strands so that the Contractor can remove the device for a
 distance of at least 1 in from the face of the concrete and plug the hole with mortar. Use free-rolling devices (hold-down and holdup) at all deflection points. The device may rest on the bottom form and remain in-place. If resting the device on the bottom form,
 galvanize the part in contact with the form for a distance of at least 1 in from the form.
 D
 Placement of Concrete
 Cast the beams in an upright position. Place the concrete in each beam without interruption. Modify the casting
 procedure if the length of the beams and placement conditions cause a cold joint to form when continuing each lift full length
 before placing a subsequent lift.
 Vibrate the concrete in each beam internally, externally, or both to produce uniformly dense concrete. Do not displace
 enclosures or steel units when vibrating. Internally vibrate in accordance with 2401.3.D, “Compaction of Concrete,” using a vibrator
 with a non-metallic vibrating head no greater than 1¼ in in diameter operating at a frequency of at least 100 Hz [100 cps].
 After striking off the top surface of the beams to the required level, work and hand float the surface to seal open tears in
 the surface and depress coarse aggregate. Use transverse brooming to roughen the surface.

 Cure according to the requirements of 3240.
 F
 
 Tensioning
 
 F.1
 Equipment
 Tension prestressing tendons using hydraulic jacks or dynamometers and hydraulic jacks. Equip each jack pump with a
 hydraulic pressure gauge. Calibrate jacks, gauges, and pumps as a unit under conditions similar to operating conditions. Provide a
 dated, certified calibration curve for each combination used. Recalibrate equipment presenting erratic results during tensioning
 operations.
 
 284
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2405.3
 
 Ensure the hydraulic pressure gauges can accurately determine the actual stress on the jacks within a tolerance of
 2 percent of the total indicated stress during final elongation of the prestressing tendons.
 Calibrate the dynamometer used to measure an initial tension. Ensure the dynamometer can accurately determine the
 initial tension within a tolerance of 5 percent.
 F.2
 General Procedures
 Conduct the tensioning procedure so that it is possible to compare the indicated stress on the tendons based on gauge
 pressures and the indicated stress based on the corresponding elongation of the tendons at any time during the tensioning
 operation. If the two indicated stresses, corrected for friction loss, differ by no greater than 5 percent, stress the tendons so the
 lower of the two indicated stresses equals the required tension in the tendon. Do not tension any tendon to an indicated stress
 greater than 80 percent of its specified tensile strength at any time. If the indicated stresses differ by greater than 5 percent, stop
 tensioning operations. Determine the source of the discrepancy and correct it before resuming tensioning operations.
 When the tensioning operation includes more than two girders with all deflection points included, demonstrate proper
 tension at both ends. When tensioning more than four girders with all deflection points included, measure and ensure proper
 elongation on the interior girders that are more than one girder from an end.
 Do not tension prestressing strands in the bundled position with direct contact between adjacent strands. Maintain a
 clear space of at least ¼ in between adjacent strands during tensioning. Depress tensioned strands into a bundled position with
 contact between adjacent strands after the completion of tensioning.
 Record the gauge pressures, indicated stresses, and elongations, and submit the record to the Materials Engineer.
 The Contractor may tension strands as a group if the strands in the group are from the same manufacturer and the
 strands receive the same initial tension. When tensioning, consider initial strand tension no greater than 150 lb per strand to be
 zero tension. If the contract requires an initial tension greater than 150 lb per strand, use a dynamometer to measure the tension.
 Add the elongation due to the initial tension to the final elongation measurement.
 Tension the deflected strands so that final tension is uniform in all parts of the strand. Provide freely turning rollers to
 reduce frictional forces at the deflection points.
 Correct tension-elongation measurements for losses due to slippage of grips or anchorages, and friction to obtain the
 prestress force shown on the plans.
 If a temperature differential in the strands at the time of tensioning and at the time of concrete placement exceeds 15° F,
 consider the change in the final elongation measurements to obtain the required prestress force at the time of casting. Base the
 change in elongation due to temperature on a ⅛ in per 100 ft of strand length for each 15° F variation in temperature. Tension
 prestressing tendons when the ambient air temperature is greater than 32° F and rising.
 G
 Prestress Transfer
 Perform the prestress transfer after the control cylinders indicate that the concrete has reached a compressive strength of
 at least 4,500 psi unless otherwise shown on the plans. When breaking the controls cylinders, use a testing machine that prints all
 test data, including time and date, directly to a printer, and initial the printout. Make the prestress transfer when the concrete is
 still warm and moist.
 During the prestress transfer sequence keep the lateral eccentricity of the prestress to a minimum and prevent cracking in
 the top flange of the beams. The Contractor may perform the prestress transfer by the gradual release of hydraulic jacks, by
 heating exposed portions of individual strands to failure, or by a combination of these two methods. If heating the individual
 strands, heat in accordance with the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 
 Heat each individual strand simultaneously on the strand at no less than two locations along the casting bed.
 Sequence heating each strand along the bed and with the sequence of perform the prestress transfer between
 individual strands in a manner that will prevent damage, and
 Heat with a low oxygen flame played along the strand for a distance of at least 5 in. Control the heat to ensure
 that failure of the first wire in the strand does not occur for at least 5 sec after the application of heat followed
 by gradual elongation and failure of the remaining wires.
 
 Completely strip the forms from the beams before beginning prestress transfer.
 H
 Tolerances
 After prestress transfer, check the dimensions of the prestressed concrete beam to verify that the dimensions match what
 the plans show within the tolerances in the PCI, Structural QC Manual, MNL-116. Inform the plant inspector of any measurements
 not within the tolerance limits.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 285
 
 2405.3
 
 The Engineer will measure differential camber between adjacent members of the same design with the beams erected in
 the final position.
 The Engineer or the Materials Engineer may reject members that do not meet the dimensions shown on the plans or the
 specified tolerances.
 I
 Rejection
 The Materials Engineer may reject beams failing to meet the requirements of this section or beams showing the following
 after the removal of forms:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 Honeycombing,
 Stone pockets,
 Sand streaks, or
 Imperfect mixing and casting.
 
 The Materials Engineer will not reject beams showing minor surface cavities or irregularities that do not impair the service
 value if repaired as approved by the Materials Engineer. Make repairs after the Materials Engineer inspects the irregularities. Use
 repair materials and methods approved by the Materials Engineer.
 J
 Marking, Handling, Storage, and Transportation
 The Department will allow beams to be moved from the casting bed to a nearby storage area after attaining the minimum
 compressive strength for prestress transfer. Do not transport or install beams until the beam attains a compressive strength of at
 least 5,000 psi, as evidenced by control cylinders. When casting off-site, do not ship the beam until it has reached the full design
 strength shown in the plans.
 Mark each beam with the casting date and piecemark. If casting beams away from the bridge site, mark each beam with
 the name or trademark of the manufacturer and the bridge number. The Materials Engineer will stamp each approved beam with
 the official mark of the Department before shipment. Complete repairs before the Department stamps the unit. Do not ship beams
 without the Department stamp of approval. After completing the repair work, notify the Materials Engineer at least 1 full business
 day before intent to ship. The Engineer will perform a final inspection of units upon delivery.
 Ensure markings remain in evidence after erection, but not readily visible in the completed structure.
 Keep prestressed beams in an upright position at all times. Support prestressed beams during storage, lifting, and
 transportation at two points only. Considering beam stresses and stability, determine the support point locations in accordance with
 standard PCI methods.
 Obtain permits as required by road authorities.
 K
 Installation
 Erect prestressed concrete beams in a manner that will provide safety to the workers, inspectors, and the public at all
 times, as well as reasonable assurance against damage to the prestressed members. Prior to the placement of diaphragms,
 temporarily anchor, brace and stabilize the prestressed beams as they are erected so as to preclude sliding, tipping, buckling, or
 other movement that may otherwise occur. If active vehicular or railroad traffic will be permitted to travel beneath beams prior to
 complete erection of all the beams and diaphragms in a span, submit an erection plan prepared by an engineer, thoroughly checked
 by a second engineer for completeness and accuracy, and certified by one of the aforementioned professional engineers licensed in

 Before application, agitate the curing compound as received in the shipping container to obtain a homogenous mixture.
 Protect membrane curing compounds from freezing before application. Handle and apply the membrane curing compound in
 accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Apply the curing compound with an approved airless spraying machine in accordance with the following:
 (1.1)
 At a rate of 1 gal per 150 sq. ft of surface curing area.
 (1.2)
 Apply homogeneously to provide a uniform solid white opaque coverage on all exposed concrete surfaces
 (equal to a white sheet of typing paper) at the time of application. Some MnDOT approved curing compounds
 may have a base color (i.e. yellow) that cannot comply with the above requirement. In this case, provide a
 uniform solid opaque consistency meeting the intent of the above requirement.
 (1.3)
 If the curing compound is damaged during the curing period, immediately repair the damaged area by respraying.
 The Engineer will approve the airless spraying machine for use if it is equipped with the following:
 (2.1)
 A re-circulating bypass system that provides for continuous agitation of the reservoir material,
 (2.2)

 If the Engineer determines that the initial or corrective spraying results in unsatisfactory curing, the Engineer may require
 the Contractor to use the blanket curing method at no additional cost to the Department.
 G.1.b
 Blanket Curing Method
 After completion of the finishing operations and without marring the concrete, cover the concrete with curing blankets.
 Install in a manner that envelops the exposed concrete and prevents loss of water vapor. After the concrete has cured, apply
 membrane curing compound to the concrete surfaces that will remain exposed in the completed work.
 G.2
 Protection Against Rain
 Protect the concrete from damage due to rain. Have available, near the site of the work, materials for protection of the
 edges and surface of concrete. Should any damage result, the Engineer will suspend operations until the Contractor takes
 corrective action and may subject the rain-damaged concrete to 1503, “Conformity with Contract Documents,” and 1512,
 “Unacceptable and Unauthorized Work.”
 G.3
 Protection Against Cold Weather
 If the national weather service forecast for the construction area predicts air temperatures of 34 °F or less within the next
 24 h and the Contractor wishes to place concrete, submit a cold weather protection plan in accordance with 2406.3.G.3.a, “Cold
 Weather Protection Plan.”
 Protect the concrete from damage, including freezing due to cold weather. Should any damage result, the Engineer will
 suspend operations until the Contractor takes corrective action and may subject the damaged concrete to 1503, “Conformity with
 Contract Documents,” and 1512, “Unacceptable and Unauthorized Work.”

 2452.3 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 A
 Delivery and Inspection of Piling
 If the contract requires test piles, provide the number and lengths of piles as shown in the contract, unless otherwise
 directed by the Engineer. The Engineer may designate that piles authorized for one unit of a structure be driven in another unit of
 the same structure or any unit of another structure constructed under the same contract.
 If test piles are not specified in the contract, provide the number and lengths of piles as shown in the contract.
 Before delivery, establish the quality of the material in steel H-piles and in steel shells for cast-in-place concrete piles.
 Submit the mill test reports and mill shipping papers in accordance with 3371, “Steel Shells for Concrete Piling,” and 3372, “Steel
 Piling,” to the Engineer.
 The Contractor may request the Engineer’s written approval to use small quantities (less than 5 percent in a substructure
 unit) of piling from the Contractor’s surplus of cut-offs and overruns. Certify the small quantities of piling as remaining quantities of
 materials previously submitted with accompanying mill test reports and approved for use on other projects. The Department will
 not pay for pile splices used to make up approved piles for the Contractor’s convenience. Splices made for the Contractor’s
 convenience are not eligible for extra compensation in accordance with 2452.5.B, “Piling Delivered.”
 Do not drive piling before the Engineer accepts the material on the basis of mill test reports.
 The Engineer will visually inspect piling at the site before driving to verify the quality of welds and to determine the piles
 contain no physical defects that would cause the pile to fail during driving and are capable of performing as intended.
 B
 Handling, Transportation and Storage
 Handle, transport, and store piling without damaging piles intended for use in the completed structure.
 
 C
 
 Equipment for Driving
 
 C.1
 Requirements for Pile Hammers
 Use pile driving equipment approved by the Engineer. The Engineer will use the contractor-provided Driving System
 Submittal (C.1.1) as the basis for approval of equipment. Acceptance of the pile driving equipment does not relieve the Contractor
 of the responsibility to properly install the piling. If in the opinion of the Engineer the accepted driving system fails to perform
 satisfactorily during actual driving, the Engineer reserves the right to revise the driving criteria and/or require change of equipment.
 C.1.1
 Driving System Submittal
 The driving system submittal must be sealed and signed by a professional engineer, licensed in the State of Minnesota.
 Allow 10 business days for the Department's review. Allow an additional 10 business days for the review of any resubmittals. No
 variations in the driving system will be permitted without the Engineer’s written approval. Submit a Revised Driving System
 Submittal if the hammers or other driving system components change from those shown in the original approved submittal. Use
 the same pile hammer to drive test piles and to drive the piles authorized by the Engineer based on the results of the test pile
 driving. Any variation needs to be authorized by the Engineer.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 303
 
 2452.3
 
 For the Driving System Submittal, perform drivability studies as follows for each hammer and pile type:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 Model the proposed driving system including hammers, striker plate, hammer cushion, helmet, and pile
 cushions based on a wave equation analysis;
 Include in the analysis pile length variation to account for driven length variation, stickup length, and other
 considerations appropriate to construction requirements. As appropriate, include soil parameter variations to
 account for geotechnical uncertainties at the project site as well as possible range of hammer energy;
 Use an authorized computer program (GRLWEAP or similar program); and
 When a follower is used, include (1) an analysis of the driving system with the follower and (2) an analysis of
 the driving system without the follower.
 
 Include in the Driving System Submittal:
 1.
 
 Results of the drivability analysis showing that all proposed driving systems will install piles to the specified tip
 elevation or nominal pile bearing resistance shown on plans. The system should be adequate to overcome the
 greatest expected driving resistance or a minimum of 155% of the factored design load and account for end of initial
 driving and restrike conditions, as appropriate. Driving systems must generate sufficient energy to drive the piles
 with compressive and tensile stresses not more than 90 percent of the yield strength of a steel pile as driven;
 2. The Engineer will only accept pile driving equipment, as determined by the wave equation analysis, capable of
 operating from 30 blows per ft to 180 blows per ft at the above conditions;
 3. Include with relevant ranges when applicable scaled graphs depicting:
 (3.1)
 Pile compressive stress versus blows per foot.
 (3.2)
 Pile tensile stress vs. blows per foot.
 (3.3)
 Nominal driving resistance vs. blows per foot for expected typical and range of driving energy.
 4. Complete description of:
 (4.1)
 Soil parameters used for pile tip and skin, including soil quake and damping coefficients, skin friction
 distribution, and ratio of shaft resistance to total resistance.
 (4.2)
 Assumptions made regarding the formation of soil plugs, drilling through the center of open ended
 steel shells, pre-augering, pre-boring, jetting, use of vibratory or other systems to advance the pile
 other than impact hammers, and the use of closure plates, shoes, and other tip treatment.
 5. List of all hammer operation parameters assumed in the analysis, including fuel settings, stroke limitations, and
 hammer efficiency;
 6. Copies of all test results from any previous pile load tests, dynamic monitoring, and all driving records used in the
 analyses;
 7. Completed Pile and Driving Data Form along with manufacturer’s specifications for pile driving system components.
 Driving system components will be confirmed by the Engineer upon delivery of the hammer to the project site;
 8. An electronic copy of the WEAP input files;
 9. The penetration (blows per foot) as calculated by the MPF12 at the nominal pile bearing resistance required for the
 test piles and at 85% of the manufacturer’s maximum rated energy for the proposed hammer; and
 10. When the MnDOT Pile Formula 2012 will be used as field control, the Engineer will only accept pile driving
 equipment capable of operating at 180 blows per ft or less at the above conditions.
 C.2
 Pile Driving Caps
 Equip the top of the pile with a driving cap in the size and type, as approved by the Engineer, to protect the pile against
 damage during driving. Use a shock block of the type and size as approved by the Engineer on the upper side of the driving cap,
 when driving conditions warrant. Provide drive caps and shock blocks as recommended by the pile hammer manufacturer.
 C.3
 Pile Driver Leads
 Provide pile driver leads meeting the following requirements and characteristics:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 Capable of holding the pile and the pile hammer in alignment during driving operations;
 Long enough to preclude the use of punches or chasers; and
 Meeting the requirements of the pile hammer manufacturer.
 
 C.4
 Water Jets
 Provide jets capable of delivering water in the volume and pressure required to freely erode the material adjacent to the
 pile. Provide a water source capable of maintaining at least 100 psi of pressure at two jet nozzles, ¾ in in diameter.
 D
 Pile Driving
 Notify the Engineer at least 24 h before beginning pile driving operations. The Engineer will reestablish the working
 points for each substructure unit after the Contractor completes the excavation for that unit. Stake the pile locations.
 Excavate to the bottom of footing elevation as shown on the plans before driving foundation piles or test piles in any
 substructure. During pile driving operations, keep the water level in the excavation below the top of the pile. Do not perform
 underwater pile driving unless a concrete foundation seal is required to dewater cofferdam.
 
 304
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2452.3
 For each foundation pile, perform continuous pile driving operations unless otherwise directed by the Engineer.
 Sharpen timber piles to a square point with dimensions at least 5 in at the tip. Provide timber piles with blunt ends for
 soils with SPT below counts less than 20 as shown in plan borings or for piles having point bearing on hard stratum.
 Do not use punches or chasers for pile driving if the contract requires a concrete foundation seal in a cofferdam. If
 driving piles in a cofferdam, provide the extra length of piling to drive the piles to the cutoff elevation, at no additional cost to the
 Department. Accurately locate and space the piling as shown in the bridge plans with tolerances per 2452.3.D.4, “Foundation
 Piles,” 2452.3.D.5, “Pile Bents,” and 2452.3.F.2, “Pile Bents.”
 Provide pile material and appurtenances capable of withstanding driving to substantial refusal defined in accordance with
 2452.3.E.1, “Penetration and Bearing, General.” The Department considers failure of piles during pile driving operations to include
 buckling, bending, kinking, splitting, or rupturing that will impair the strength of the pile or reduce the effectiveness of the energy
 delivered by the pile hammer, as determined by the Engineer.
 If the Engineer determines that the piling material and appurtenances cannot withstand driving to substantial refusal,
 discontinue pile driving and correct or change the pile driving operations, equipment, or material as approved by the Engineer.
 If failure of the pile occurs after the Engineer directs the Contractor to continue driving after obtaining substantial refusal,
 the Department will pay for the cost of the failure.
 D.1
 Jetting and Preboring
 The Contractor may perform water jetting if needed, or as required by the contract, to aid in driving displacement type
 piles. Do not perform jetting in embankments or in areas where the jetting may damage the existing soils. Before reaching a
 preset depth approved by the Engineer but not less than 5 ft of the final tip elevation, withdraw the jets and drive the piles with the
 hammer to secure the final penetration. Control and dispose of jet water, as approved by the Engineer.
 Perform preboring for displacement type piles driven through embankments if the embankment depth, measured below
 the bottom of the footing, is greater than 8 ft. Perform preboring through the depth of the embankment. Continue preboring
 through shallow, dense crust at the surface of the original ground as directed by the Engineer.
 Perform preboring through embankments less than 8 ft if the material may damage the piles during driving, as directed
 by the Engineer. Perform preboring for displacement type piles if the material below the bottom of a footing precludes driving to a
 penetration of 10 ft below the bottom of the footing without damaging the piles, as directed by the Engineer. If the pile does not
 penetrate greater than 0.03 in per blow for each 1000 foot pounds of rated energy, the Engineer will consider this, the weight of
 the ram, and the type and size of the piles to determine the probability of damage.
 Make prebored holes of a diameter that will admit the largest cross-sectional diameter of the pile without creating friction
 between the faces of the pile and the prebored hole.
 D.2
 Test Piles
 Provide test piles as required by the contract. Drive test piles at the locations shown on the plans unless otherwise
 approved or directed by the Engineer.
 Place full lengths of test piles in the leads and continuously drive, unless otherwise approved by the Engineer. The
 Contractor may perform sectional driving if the Engineer determines from the survey sheet or from previous pile driving in the area
 that the test piles can be driven in sections without the danger of “set-up” during the splicing period.
 Assist the Engineer in obtaining data (examples: lay pile in a safe location, marking pile with 10 blow count, attach
 gauges as instructed) for bearing for the full length of the pile driving. Redrive the test piles as required by the Engineer and in
 accordance with 2452.3.D.8, “Pile Redriving.”
 If the Engineer determines that steel test piles have not developed adequate bearing capacity per 2452.3.E.1,
 “Penetration and Bearing, General,” provide additional lengths and splice as directed by the Engineer.
 D.3
 Static Pile Load Tests
 Provide Axial Static Compressive Load Testing (ASTM D 1143M) , Axial Static Tension Load Testing (ASTM D 3689),
 Lateral Static Load Testing (ASTM D 3966), Quasi-Static Load Testing (ASTM D 7383), O-Cell Load Testing, or similar testing for
 evaluation of either axial or lateral compressive or tensile load and deformation analysis.
 (1) Coordinate test program with Construction, Bridge, and Materials offices;
 (2) Provide materials, furnish labor, and conduct the test program as required by the contract. Install temporary and
 permanent instrumentation as required by the contract or as directed by the Engineer;
 (3) Analyze and report data both in hard-copy format and electronic format in a timely manner;
 (4) Adjust test program as directed by the Engineer based on conditions encountered in the field; and
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications

 (5) If the test program is used for construction control, provide appropriate analysis and field inspectors’ charts, as
 described in section K, for assessment of the capacity of foundation piling.
 D.4
 Foundation Piles
 Guide piles during driving. Complete pile driving with piles having the required batter or plumbness within ½ in per ft,
 and having a final position within 6 in of plan location within the footing area. The Engineer may reject or reduce payment per
 1512 for improperly positioned piles, as determined by the Engineer.
 If the Engineer determines that some piles in a unit have heaved during the driving of other piles in the unit, redrive the
 piles as directed by the Engineer to complete the pile driving.
 D.5
 Pile Bents
 The Department defines pile bents as piles meeting the following characteristics and requirements:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 Driven in single rows;
 Capped with timber, steel, or concrete caps; and
 Driven to closer tolerances than for general pile driving, as described below.
 
 Guide piles during driving. Complete pile driving with piles having the required batter or plumbness within ¼ in per ft,
 and having a final position within 3 in of plan location within the bent. The Contractor is responsible for any increase in pile cap
 dimensions or reinforcing caused by inaccurately placed piles. The Engineer may reject or reduce payment for improperly
 positioned piles, as determined by the Engineer. For timber pile bents, select piles having a uniform diameter.
 D.6
 Cast-in-Place Concrete Piles
 Equip the bottom of each pile with a driving shoe meeting the following requirements:
 (1)
 (2)
 
 Welded watertight; and
 Dimensions no greater than ¼ in larger than the dimensions of the periphery of the pile shell.

 points for cast-in-place concrete piles in lieu of flat driving shoes. Equip the bottom of each shell with a commercially manufactured
 conical pile point of cast steel welded watertight, as approved by the Engineer. Attach the conical pile point to the pile as
 recommend by the manufacturer.
 Inspect each pile with the Engineer after driving, for depth to the driving shoe and for condition of the shell. Notify the
 Engineer upon observation of impairment or damage. The Engineer, considering the bearing requirements and driving conditions,
 will determine the acceptability of the pile. Provide a light for a visual inspection of the full length of pile.
 The Department will not require the Contractor to provide reinforcement bars unless otherwise shown on the plans.
 Vibrate concrete in the portion of pile shells containing reinforcement cages.
 Do not perform pile driving and other operations that will cause detrimental vibrations near concrete-filled piles until the
 concrete has been in place for at least 3 calendar days. Refer to 2401.3.G, “Concrete Curing and Protection,” for vibration limits on
 newly placed concrete.
 Do not place concrete for footings and caps until the day after concrete placement for the piles.
 Protect concrete in the piles against freezing temperatures for at least 3 calendar days after placement. If placing
 concrete in piles during freezing temperatures, provide 30 percent additional cement to the concrete mix for concrete above 10 ft
 below the ground line or waterline.

 The Engineer will consult with the Regional Bridge Construction Engineer or Metals Quality Engineer for special welding
 requirements.
 D.8
 Pile Redriving
 Redrive of test or foundation piles determines the capacity that can be obtained by including pile “set up.” “Set up” is the
 time-dependent increase in pile resistance.
 If the contract includes a pay item for “Pile Redrive,” perform pile redrive at the direction of the Engineer a minimum of
 24 h after initial driving unless otherwise required by the contract. If driving conditions allow, continue to drive test pile to the
 length shown on the plans and in accordance with 2452.3.E.1, “Penetration and Bearing, General.” Redrive additional foundation
 piles to verify the bearing capacity as determined and directed by the Engineer.
 Do not drive other piles in the same substructure during the waiting period. Perform redriving with a warm pile hammer.
 Apply at least 20 blows to a previously driven pile or timber mats to warm the pile hammer before using it for the redrive. When
 redriving, do not strike each pile with greater than 20 blows. When using MPF12 as field control, mark the penetration of every
 blow and measure penetration using the average of the first 5 blows in which the hammer has good energy. Do not trim piles to
 the cut-off elevation shown on the plans until the Engineer has determined the need for redriving. Do not fill CIP concrete piles in
 any substructure unit with concrete until the Engineer determines that the driven piles in the unit meet the required bearing
 resistance shown on the plans and the pile shells were trimmed to the cut-off elevation.
 Weld extensions to piles authorized and subsequently driven or drive additional piles as directed by the Engineer.
 E
 
 Penetration and Bearing
 
 E.1
 General
 The Department calculated the nominal pile bearing resistances as shown on the plans using design loadings. The
 Department will use the nominal pile bearing resistance as determined by 2452.3.E.2, “Determination of Nominal Bearing
 Resistance,” to establish the minimum criteria for pile acceptance in which the driving resistance is not less than the required
 nominal bearing resistance as shown on the plans. If necessary, drive the foundation piles beyond the resistance shown on the
 plans until the piles reach the required penetration as shown on the plans or until the piles have been driven to the penetration
 determined by the Engineer and based on the test pile results.
 Drive the test pile full length unless substantial refusal is encountered at a lesser penetration. If the test pile has been
 driven full length and if the test pile has not attained 115 percent of the nominal resistance for the foundation piles as shown on the
 plans, drive the test pile further as directed by the Engineer and in accordance with 2452.3.D.2, “Test Piles,” and 2452.4.A, “Test
 Piles.” Perform pile redriving as shown on the plans with the penetration and time delays in accordance with 2452.3.D.8, “Pile
 Redriving.”
 The Engineer will consider that substantial refusal is attained, in accordance with 2452.3.D, “Pile Driving,” when the
 penetration rate equals 0.05 in per blow.
 E.2
 Determination of Nominal Bearing Resistance
 The Department bases the required nominal resistance as shown on the plans for each field control method. Determine
 the driven pile nominal resistance in accordance with the following using the appropriate corresponding field control method as
 shown on the plans. Unless the contract requires otherwise, if more than one field control method is shown on the plans,
 determine the method used in accordance with the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 
 If the contract includes a “Pile Analysis” contract item for a substructure, provide the Pile Driving Analyzer
 (PDA) for the field control; or
 If the contract does not include a “Pile Analysis” for a substructure, the Contractor may choose the field control
 method. The Department will include the cost of the PDA with the relevant contract item for piling driven.
 
 E.3
 MnDOT Pile Formula 2012 (MPF12) Used as Field Control Method
 Determine the nominal pile bearing resistance using the following dynamic formula for CIP concrete piles and steel H piles
 driven with power-driven hammers:
 
 𝑅𝑛 = 20√
 Where:
 
 Rn
 W
 H
 S
 
 𝑊×𝐻
 1000
 
 10
 
 × log( )
 𝑆
 
 = Nominal Pile Bearing Resistance in tons
 = Weight of the striking part of the hammer (ram) in pounds (see note below)
 = Height of fall in feet (see note below)
 = Average penetration in inches per blow for the last 10 blows or 20 blows, except if the pile may be damaged
 by this number of blows.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 307
 
 2452.3
 The MPF12 is not suitable for use in pile driving conditions where the average penetration during driving (S) is greater
 than 0.5 inches per blow (less than 24 blows per foot). The Contractor shall immediately notify the Engineer if the specified
 nominal pile bearing resistance shown in the plans is obtained with an average penetration greater than 0.5 inches per blow.
 The Contractor may choose any of the following options to reduce the average penetration during driving to less than 0.5
 inches per blow and achieve the specified nominal pile bearing resistance shown in the plans:
 (1) Reduce the fuel setting of the hammer for the test piles and foundation piles.
 (2) Perform redrives on the test piles and 10% of the foundation piles at a reduced fuel setting of the hammer. Perform
 redrives on the foundation piles that had the highest penetration at the end of initial drive or as determined by the
 Engineer.
 (3) Continue driving the pile until the average penetration is less than 0.5 inches per blow.
 (4) Use a qualified smaller hammer.
 The above options will be performed at no additional cost to the Department, with the exception that additional driven
 and delivered length will be paid for by the Department up to the estimated length shown in the plans.
 Regardless of the value measured during driving, the value of (S) used in the dynamic formula shall not be less than
 0.066 inches per blow (more than 180 blows per foot). If the measured average penetration for the last 10 blows is less than 0.066
 inches per blow, use 0.066 in the dynamic formula to determine the bearing resistance.
 Note: (W x H) is measured during pile driving and is also commonly referred to as the “energy”, E, hence E = W x H, for
 single acting power-driven hammers and is measured in foot-pounds. The value of (W x H) used in the dynamic formula shall not
 exceed 85 percent of the manufacturer’s maximum rated energy for the hammer used.
 In addition to the limits stated above, apply the dynamic formula only if:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 The hammer has a free fall;
 The head of the pile is free from damage;
 The penetration of the pile is at a uniform rate; and
 There is no bounce after the blow. If a bounce occurs, deduct twice the bounce height from H to determine the
 value of H in the formula.
 
 For the requirements of this section, double-acting hammers include hammers utilizing a power source for acceleration of
 the down-stroke of the ram.
 E.4
 Pile Driving Analyzer (PDA) Used as Field Control Method
 Determine the nominal pile bearing resistance using the pile driving analyzer and the Case Pile Wave Analysis Program
 (CAPWAP) as stated below, “Dynamic Monitoring of Pile Driving.” Use the refined WEAP bearing graph as required in as stated
 below, “Wave Equation Analysis,” to determine the bearing resistances recorded on the pile driving report. Attach a copy of the
 bearing graph to the pile driving report. Calculate and record the bearing resistances for informational and comparison purposes on
 the report in accordance with 2452.3.E.3, “MnDOT Pile Formula 2012 (MPF12) Used as Field Control Method.”
 E.4.1
 
 High-Strain Dynamic Monitoring of Pile Driving
 
 E.4.1.1 Description of Work
 Provide and use a Pile Driving Analyzer (PDA) to perform high-strain dynamic monitoring of driven piles meeting the
 requirements of ASTM D4945. Perform the dynamic pile testing on the initial driving and re-driving of designated piles as shown in
 the plans or directed by the Engineer. Test additional piles or designated piles at additional times as directed by the Engineer.
 E.4.1.2 Pile Preparation
 Prepare each pile to be tested by marking and attaching instrumentation to the piles. During initial driving of steel shell
 piles, attach instrumentation after the pile has been placed in the leads. In all circumstances, extra care should be exercised to
 protect the instrumentation from distress throughout the pile installation. Wireless pile instrumentation may be attached to the pile,
 if approved by the engineer, prior to placing the pile in the leads provided that the instrumentation is adequately protected against
 damage by contact with the leads, abrasion, or shear from the rope, chain, or fabric, used to pick up the pile.
 During the test, provide assistance as necessary, e.g. access, tightening gages, re-setting or replacing gages, or replacing
 cables as necessary for the successful conduct of the dynamic monitoring program. Alert the Engineer to any unanticipated or
 unusual conditions including such items as severed cables, loose gages, or unusual pile, or pile hammer performance.
 E.4.1.3 Signal Matching and Refined Wave Equation Analysis
 Following dynamic testing of the driven piling, perform a refined wave equation analysis based on driving data obtained
 from the high-strain dynamic monitoring program using the Case Pile Wave Analysis Program (CAPWAP) or other approved signal
 matching software. This work shall be performed by an engineer pre-qualified for work type 6.5 as defined by the MnDOT
 Geotechnical Manual. Complete the analysis on all piles dynamically tested, or as directed by the Engineer. Furnish PDA and
 CAPWAP electronic data and summary hardcopy outputs to the Engineer.
 
 308
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2452.3
 
 After the wave matching analysis is performed, use the GRLWEAP or similar program and the signal matching program
 (e.g. CAPWAP) data to produce a refined Wave Equation Analysis bearing graph and inspector’s chart for the basis for pile
 acceptance. Prepare similar charts if soil set-up and pile re-strikes are being evaluated. Submit the refined WEAP bearing graph and
 Inspector’s Chart for use in construction control for each substructure. Use the bearing graph to determine the foundation pile’s
 nominal bearing resistance to be recorded on the pile driving report.
 Prepare and submit a summary plot of the performance of each pile in the pile group where each pile is plotted on the
 Inspector’s chart by its observed set and the corresponding stroke of the pile hammer. Adjust this procedure as directed by the
 engineer for non-diesel hammers. Any piles not plotting in the acceptable range will be rejected.
 E.4.1.4 Deliverables
 Provide the results from each dynamic test performed with the PDA and analyzed with the CAPWAP program meeting the
 following requirements to the Engineer within the time specified:

 2452.4 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 A
 Test Piles
 If the plans show specific contract pay items for test piles, the Engineer will measure the number of test piles provided as
 required by the contract and driven as directed by the Engineer. The Engineer will not eliminate test piles from the contract, unless
 all piles for the unit are eliminated or unless mutually agreed upon by the Contractor and the Engineer.
 If the plans do not show a specific contract pay item for test piles, the Engineer will include the measurement of test piles
 with the measurement for piling delivered and piling driven.
 If the Engineer determines that steel H-test piles or steel shells for cast-in-place concrete test piles provided in the
 lengths required by the contract do not develop sufficient nominal pile bearing resistance or do not provide information per
 2452.3.D.2, “Test Piles,” for ordering foundation piles, splice extensions onto test piles or deliver longer piles as required by the
 Engineer.
 The Engineer will measure splice extensions onto test piles or longer piles, as required by the Engineer when driving
 beyond plan test pile length, in accordance with the relevant contract pay items for piling delivered and piling driven.
 B
 Piling Delivered
 If test piles are not required, the Engineer will measure piling delivered as shown on the plans for acceptable piling
 provided and delivered in the lengths and sizes of the relevant contract pay items. If the contract requires test piles, the Engineer
 will measure the lengths approved by the Engineer.
 C
 Piling Driven
 The Engineer will measure piling driven by the length of acceptable piling below cut-off.
 D
 Pile Load Tests

 “Metal Reinforcement.”
 F
 Pile Redriving
 The Engineer will measure pile redriving by the number of piles redriven as required by the contract and as directed by
 the Engineer. The Engineer will recalculate the estimated plan quantity to agree with the actual number of piles redriven at the
 project site, estimated not to exceed 25% of the total number of planned piles. The Engineer will consider any pile redriving
 completed without the direction of Engineer as unauthorized work and the Department will not compensate the Contractor for that
 work.
 G
 Dynamic Monitoring of Pile Driving
 The Engineer will measure Pile Driving Analyzer field control by the number of piles that required the pile driving analysis
 as required by the contract. The Engineer will consider initial analysis and redrive analysis on an individual pile as one pile analysis.
 The Engineer may increase or decrease the number of piles to be dynamically monitored.
 If the contract does not require the Pile Driving Analyzer field control method, the Contractor may perform the Pile
 Driving Analyzer field control method at the Contractor’s option and at no additional cost to the Department.

 Handling and Storing Materials
 
 C.1
 Batch Material Requirements
 Do not change the source, kind or gradation of batch materials after the start of concrete production for the work unless
 otherwise approved by the Engineer. If the Engineer approves use of different material, completely exhaust the supply on hand
 before changing to the different material.
 If delivering freshly washed aggregates to the batching plant, drain the aggregates for at least 12 h before using in the
 batching operation. If draining freshly washed aggregates at the site of the batching plant, completely separate the drained
 material from the undrained materials, and provide for the disposal of water that accumulates from the drainage of materials.
 Provide smooth, firm, and well-drained stockpile sites cleared of vegetation and extraneous matter. Where the natural
 foundation is unsatisfactory, as determined by the Engineer, construct the stockpiles on suitable platforms. Construct suitable
 bulkheads or partitions to separate different kinds of aggregate, gradation, or water content.
 Construct stockpiles by methods that hold segregation and degradation to a minimum. If the Engineer sees segregation
 or degradation, the Engineer may designate that pile as unacceptable for use.
 Do not use aggregates used to construct runways for loading or hauling equipment in concrete batches.
 Use of aggregates from the bottom 1 ft of a stockpile placed on an unprepared surface in concrete batches is allowed
 only under the Engineer’s direct supervision and if the material meets all requirements of 3126, “Fine Aggregate for Portland
 Cement Concrete,” and 3137, “Coarse Aggregate for Portland Cement Concrete.”
 Provide aggregates in accordance with the specified gradation requirements.
 The Engineer will consider aggregates unacceptable if the variation in moisture content carried by any of the aggregates
 causes a marked variation in the consistency of successive batches of the mixed concrete, and will suspend operations until
 corrected.
 C.2
 Concrete Temperature Control
 Produce concrete at temperatures from 50 °F to 90 °F and maintain temperatures until deposited in the work.
 If necessary to maintain placement temperature, uniformly heat or cool the water, aggregates, or both, before
 introduction into the mixer. Control the temperature of the mixing water during heating or cooling.
 Use aggregate at temperatures from 32 °F to 130 °F. Do not allow cementitious material to contact other batch material
 when the aggregate temperature exceeds 130 °F.
 Do not heat the cement, add salt, or add chemical admixtures to the concrete mix to prevent freezing.
 
 322
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2461.3

 targeted batch weight in accordance with the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 (5)
 
 Water – 1 percent,
 Cement – 1 percent,
 Other cementitious materials – 3 percent,
 Aggregates – 2 percent, and
 Admixtures – 3 percent.
 
 D.1.c
 Batching of Mixing Water
 Separately measure each type of mixing water on scales or water metering devices containing the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 A discharge indicator capable of being set to within 1 gal of a predetermined quantity,
 A positive automatic shutoff valve, and
 An approved inspection seal on the scale or water metering device dating the time of the previous calibration
 and adjustment
 
 An authorized service agency will calibrate the water meter every 6 months and make adjustments as necessary before
 use meeting the requirements of the weighing procedure in the Concrete Manual.
 Check the water meter for accuracy at least once each month as the work progresses.
 D.1.d
 Batching of Cementitious Materials
 Weigh the cementitious material independently of the aggregates in separate compartments or on separate scales.
 If the Contractor weighs the cement first and then separately records the weights of each individual cementitious
 material, the Contractor may weigh the cementitious materials cumulatively as approved by the Engineer, in conjunction with the
 Concrete Engineer.
 D.1.e
 Batching of Aggregates
 If the Contractor records each individual fraction weight of aggregates separately, the Contractor may weigh aggregates
 cumulatively as approved by the Engineer, in conjunction with the Concrete Engineer.
 D.1.f
 Admixture Proportioning
 If using two or more admixtures in a single concrete batch, add each admixture separately to prevent interaction of the
 different admixtures before mixing with other batch materials. Agitate admixtures to ensure homogeneous concentrations in
 accordance with the manufacturers recommendations.
 Incorporate admixtures to the batch mix in liquid form. Maintain admixture solutions at a uniform concentration at all
 times. Use the solution concentration and proportions designated by the manufacturer.
 If using a mechanical dispenser for proportioning Class I or Class II admixtures, provide a site gauge or meter. Have the
 admixture manufacturer check admixture dispensers yearly to determine accuracy and ensure unobstructed flow.
 D.2
 Batching by Volume
 Proportion concrete for bridge deck overlays by volume or as required by the contract.
 If the Contractor calibrates the mixer for the specific batch materials in use, the Contractor may proportion concrete on
 other items of work by volume as approved by the Engineer in writing.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 323
 
 2461.3
 
 The Engineer will approve all methods and equipment used in volumetric proportioning.
 Determine all material proportions and calibration settings on the basis of 100 lb of cementitious material.
 Provide and use only sacked cement in the original mill containers unless the Contractor calibrates the mixer for the
 specific materials in use. Do not use previously opened sacks.
 
 E
 Mixing Requirements
 The Engineer may check the water measuring equipment for accuracy before mixing operations begin and at any other
 time the Engineer considers necessary.
 Mix concrete by one of the following methods:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 A central plant (stationary plant),
 Entirely or in part in truck mixers, or
 At the construction site.
 
 Do not allow the mixing batch to merge or intermix with the subsequent dry batch during mixing.
 Discharge water remaining in the drums before batching.
 Mix concrete to provide a mixture that is homogeneous and uniform in color. The Engineer will reject concrete batches
 that show a marked variation in consistency or evidence of improper mixing as unacceptable work in accordance with 1503,
 “Conformity with Contract Documents,” and 1512, “Unacceptable and Unauthorized Work.”
 After completely mixing the concrete, either in a central plant mixer or truck mixer, continuously agitate while in transit to
 the point of placement until the concrete is discharged from the unit, unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer, in conjunction with
 the Concrete Engineer.
 If the mixing does not appear uniform, perform slump tests at the 15 percentage point and the 85 percentage points
 during unloading. If the results show a slump variation greater than 1½ in, stop work and correct the mixing unit.
 Produce concrete in such quantity and at such a rate as proper placement and finishing will permit. Do not re-temper
 partially set concrete.
 Do not hand mix concrete.
 E.1
 Mixing In Truck Mixer
 Charge the materials into the truck mixer drum by introducing sufficient water before adding solid materials. Perform
 charging operations without losing materials.
 Leave the truck mixer at the plant site for a minimum of 5 min or 50 revolutions during the mixing period. Transport the
 concrete at agitating speed to the point of placement.

 Handling and Storing Materials
 
 C.1
 Batch Material Requirements
 Do not change the source, kind or gradation of batch materials after the start of concrete production for the work unless
 otherwise approved by the Engineer. If the Engineer approves use of different material, completely exhaust the supply on hand
 before changing to the different material.
 If delivering freshly washed aggregates to the batching plant, drain the aggregates before using in the batching
 operation. If draining freshly washed aggregates at the site of the batching plant, completely separate the drained material from
 the undrained materials, and provide for the disposal of water that accumulates from the drainage of materials. Drain any excess
 water from the aggregate hoppers prior to batching concrete.
 Provide smooth, firm, and well-drained stockpile sites cleared of vegetable and extraneous matter. Where the natural
 foundation is unsatisfactory, as determined by the Engineer, construct the stockpiles on suitable platforms. Construct suitable
 bulkheads or partitions to separate different kinds of aggregate, gradation, or water content.
 Construct stockpiles by methods that hold segregation and degradation to a minimum. If the Engineer sees segregation
 or degradation, the Engineer may designate that pile as unacceptable for use.
 Do not use aggregates used to construct runways for loading or hauling equipment in concrete batches.
 Use of aggregates from the bottom 1 ft of a stockpile placed on an unprepared surface in concrete batches is allowed
 only under the Engineer’s direct supervision and if the material meets all requirements of 3126, “Fine Aggregate for Portland
 Cement Concrete,” and 3137, “Coarse Aggregate for Portland Cement Concrete.”
 Provide aggregates in accordance with the specified gradation requirements.
 The Engineer will consider aggregates unacceptable if the variation in moisture content carried by any of the aggregates
 causes a marked variation in the consistency of successive batches of the mixed concrete, and will suspend operations until
 corrected.

 Batching of Mixing Water
 Measure the mixing water on scales or water metering devices containing the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 A discharge indicator capable of being set to within 1 gal of a predetermined quantity,
 A positive automatic shutoff valve, and
 An approved inspection seal on the scale or water metering device dating the time of the previous calibration
 and adjustment
 
 An authorized service agency will calibrate the water meter in accordance with the following:
 (1)
 Before startup of the production season,
 (2)
 Every 6 months during production, and
 (3)
 When requested by the engineer.
 Make adjustments as necessary before use meeting the requirements of the weighing procedure in section 5-694.400 of

 D.1.f
 Admixture Proportioning
 If using two or more admixtures in a single concrete batch, add each admixture separately to prevent interaction of the
 different admixtures before mixing with other batch materials. Agitate admixtures to ensure homogeneous concentrations in
 accordance with the manufacturers recommendations.
 Incorporate admixtures to the batch mix in liquid form. Maintain admixture solutions at a uniform concentration at all
 times. Use the solution concentration and proportions designated by the manufacturer.
 If using a mechanical dispenser for proportioning Class I or Class II admixtures, provide a site gauge or meter. Have the
 admixture manufacturer check admixture dispensers yearly to determine accuracy and ensure unobstructed flow.
 D.2
 Batching by Volume
 Proportion concrete for precast products by volume or as required by the contract.
 The Engineer will approve all methods and equipment used in volumetric proportioning.
 Determine all material proportions and calibration settings on the basis of 100 lb of cementitious material.
 Provide and use only sacked cement in the original mill containers unless the Precaster calibrates the mixer for the
 specific materials in use. Do not use previously opened sacks.
 Increase the cementitious content by 10 percent in the computation of volume proportions unless the Precaster calibrates
 the mixer for the specific materials in use.
 E
 Mixing Requirements
 The Engineer may check the water measuring equipment for accuracy before mixing operations begin and at any other
 time, the Engineer considers necessary.
 Mix concrete by one of the following methods:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 A central plant (stationary plant),
 Entirely or in part in truck mixers, or
 At the construction site.
 
 Do not allow the mixing batch to merge or intermix with the subsequent dry batch during mixing.
 Discharge water remaining in the drums before batching.
 Mix concrete to provide a mixture that is homogeneous and uniform in color. The Engineer will reject concrete batches
 that show a marked variation in consistency or evidence of improper mixing as unacceptable work in accordance with 1503,
 “Conformity with Contract Documents,” and 1512, “Unacceptable and Unauthorized Work.”
 After completely mixing the concrete, either in a central plant mixer or truck mixer, continuously agitate while in transit to
 the point of placement until the concrete is discharged from the unit, unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer, in conjunction with
 the Concrete Engineer. Transport in non-agitating equipment is exempt from this requirement.
 If the mixing does not appear uniform, perform slump tests at the 15 percentage point and the 85 percentage points
 during unloading. If the results show a slump variation greater than 1½ in, stop work and correct the mixing unit.
 Produce concrete in such quantity and at such a rate as proper placement and finishing will permit. Do not re-temper
 partially set concrete.
 Do not hand mix concrete.
 E.1
 Mixing In Truck Mixer
 Charge the materials into the truck mixer drum by introducing sufficient water before adding solid materials. Perform
 charging operations without losing materials.

 C
 General Fabrication Practices
 Provide structural material fabricated and assembled meeting the requirements of AASHTO/NSBA Steel Bridge
 Collaboration “Steel Bridge Fabrication Guide Specification” and AWS welding codes, except as modified in this chapter. Provide
 material structurally welded meeting the requirements of ANSI/AASHTO/AWS D1.5, “Bridge Welding Code,” for major structural
 components and ANSI/AWS D1.1, “Structural Welding Code Steel,” for minor structural components. Ensure the Certified Welding
 Inspector (CWI), or an equivalent, witnesses the welder and welding operator qualification tests unless otherwise specified in this
 section.
 Before the start of work, the supplier will be pre-qualified on MnDOT’s approved suppliers for fabricated structural metals
 products list as maintained by the Structural Metals Engineer at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/bridge/pdf/approvedsuppliers.pdf, or at
 least 30 calendar days prior to beginning work, the supplier is to submit a Quality Manual (QM) to the Engineer for review. Ensure
 the QM is written in accordance with the MnDOT Supplier Qualification Standard (SQS). The Engineer will use the SQS as the basis
 of acceptance for the submitted QM. In addition to routine inspections, the Engineer will audit suppliers with approved QMs on a
 biannual or annual basis or as otherwise directed by the Engineer to ensure the implementation of the QM.
 The Department will invoke its Corrective Action Process if the routine inspections or audits indicate non-conformance.
 Any and all corrective actions deemed appropriate by the Engineer, are effective immediately and apply to any work remaining on a
 current project and all future projects. If the Engineer determines that work does not comply with the QM or that fabrication does
 not follow approved fabrication procedures, the Engineer will deem the materials as non-conforming in accordance with 1503,
 “Conformity with Contract Documents,” and 1512, “Unacceptable and Unauthorized Work.” If the Engineer finds non-conforming
 work, direct the supplier to immediately correct the procedure and submit a written non-conformance report, containing data
 required by the Engineer to ensure compliance with the QM, specifications, and drawings. Perform additional testing as required by
 the Engineer at no additional cost to the Department. For repeat offences or negligence, the Department will require corrective
 action of hiring a third party Quality Control Inspector at no additional cost to the Department. The Contractor may obtain a copy
 of the Department’s Corrective Action Process from the Engineer.
 C.1
 Prefabrication Conference
 Before fabrication, the Engineer may schedule a Prefabrication Conference with the Contractor and the fabricator to
 discuss pertinent specifications, procedures, and requirements of the job. The Engineer will consult the Contractor and the
 fabricator to decide the location, date, and agenda items for the conference.
 C.2
 Notification
 Notify the Engineer at least 5 business days before the fabricator begins work so that the Engineer may perform
 inspections. Do not allow the fabricator to begin work before notifying the Engineer.
 C.3
 Identification of Materials
 Before fabrication begins, the Fabricator will provide a copy of purchase orders, Mill Test Report (MTR), or other
 documentation required by the Engineer, indicating that the materials meet the physical, chemical, and source (mill) requirements
 of this section for each heat of steel used in the work. The Fabricator will provide copies of purchase orders when placing the
 orders. When the materials are received, the fabricator will indicate in writing or by ink stamp that the MTRs have been checked
 for compliance. Include the name of the individual who checked the MTR and the date of inspection with the purchase order. If
 the Engineer determines that the documentation is incomplete, direct the fabricator to sample and test materials as directed by the
 Engineer at no additional cost to the Department. Provide scale weights of individual members or sections as required by the
 Engineer.
 Except for the following, the Fabricator of minor structural components will provide Certificates of Compliance and
 shipping documents for each contract item to the Engineer instead of submitting purchase orders and MTRs:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 (5)
 (6)
 
 Pedestrian bridges;
 Post and truss chord materials for traffic signs;
 High mast light poles;
 Modular expansion devices;
 Pot bearings; and
 Other items designated by the Engineer.
 
 In conjunction with the fabricator, keep appropriate documentation on file for at least seven years.
 During each stage of fabrication of major structural components, ensure the fabricator provides and maintains
 identification to establish the heat of the material from which the component is fabricated. Provide the Engineer with a list showing
 heat numbers referenced to the material incorporated into each component. The Engineer will reject material that loses its identity
 unless the identity can be re-established to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 Provide wide flange beams, flanges, webs, splice plates, welded cover plates, and fracture critical members with
 identification numbers placed on each individual piece of material that referenced to the corresponding heat number.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 355
 
 2471.3
 Ensure the fabricator uses non-oil-based markers or low stress die stamps for the identification coding of material.
 C.4
 Weld Identification System
 Before implementation, ensure the fabricator uses the MnDOT standard weld identification system as described in
 2471.3.C.4.a, “Standard Weld Identification System,” or an alternate system approved by the Engineer to identify welds subject to
 radiographic testing, ultrasonic testing, or both. Use a traceability system with a unique identification assigned to all welds being
 examined. Do not repeat identification numbers. Use identification numbers traceable back to the original member examined and
 document the identification number on the shop detail drawings.
 C.4.a
 
 Standard Weld Identification System
 
 C.4.a(1) Piece Mark
 Provide material marked with the fabricator’s piece identification as shown on the approved shop detail drawings.
 C.4.a(2) Splice Plane Number

 but are not limited to the following:
 (1) False indications due to defective plates or internal faults; and
 (2) Artifacts due to non-functional pixels.
 Ensure the contrast and brightness range that demonstrates the required sensitivity be considered valid contrast and
 brightness values for interpretation. When multiple IQIs are utilized to cover different thickness ranges the contrast and brightness
 range that demonstrates the required IQI image of each IQI is determined. Intervening thicknesses may be interpreted using the
 overlapping portions of the determined contrast and brightness ranges. When there is no overlap, additional IQI(s) are to be used.
 When performing CR or DR, ensure a measuring scale is utilized to serve as a length reference. The scale is to be
 attached to the SPIP holder or DDA prior to exposure. As an alternative, when using SPIPs a transparent scale with opaque
 gradations may be placed on the SPIP prior to processing. In any case, the reference comparator cannot interfere with
 interpretation of the image.
 Provide a work station monitor for evaluating images equipped with a display resolution with a pixel count which is at
 least equal to the pixel count of the direct imaging plate.

 A
 Bending
 Bend bars to the shapes as shown on the plans. The Contractor may bend the bars cold. If hot bending a non-coated
 bar, do not heat bars to temperatures greater than 1,200° F and do not quench the bars.
 Bar bending details shall conform to the American Concrete Institute 315, “Details & Detailing of Concrete
 Reinforcement,” unless otherwise shown or noted in the plans. Ensure that the bar bend diameters are as shown “Recommended”
 in the American Concrete Institute 315.
 Repair bond loss or coating damage after bending epoxy coated reinforcement bars in accordance with 3301,
 “Reinforcement Bars.” Clean damaged areas to remove loose or deleterious material before patching. Remove rust by blast
 cleaning. The Engineer, in conjunction with the Materials Engineer, will not require the repair of hairline cracks with no bond loss or
 other damage. Perform repairs before oxidation appears.
 B
 Storage and Protection
 Do not store metal reinforcement in a manner that will cause, induce, or accelerate corrosion or contamination of the
 metal. Locate timbers (dunnage) on the ground to support the bundles and keep them free of contamination. Store materials at
 the project site to allow the Engineer to visually inspect and check the various types of reinforcement for conformance to the
 dimensions as shown on the plans. Store bars of the same type together. Identify reinforcement bars with tags bearing the
 identification symbols as shown on the plans.
 Protect coated reinforcement bars before handling or shipping to prevent damage to the coating. Pad bundling bands
 and lift bundles using an OSHA-approved spreader bar, multiple supports, or platform bridge to prevent bar-to-bar abrasion from
 sags in the bar bundle. Do not drag or drop bars or bundles. Support bars or bundles in transit to prevent damage to the coating.
 If the epoxy-coated reinforcing steel is incorporated into the Project and is exposed to the weather or stored exposed to
 the weather for more than 60 calendar days, cover the steel to protect the material from sunlight, salt-spray and weather exposure.
 Provide for air circulation around the covered steel to minimize condensation under the protective covering.

 Placing, Supporting, and Tying Bar Reinforcement
 
 C.1
 General Requirements
 Before placing concrete in a unit, ensure the reinforcement bars meet the condition defined in the current CRSI manual
 titled Placing Reinforcing Bars, Chapter VII, “Unloading, Storing, and Handling Bars on the Job.” Place the bars as specified in
 “Tolerances in Placement” section in Chapter X, “General Principles for Bar Placing, Splicing and Tying Reinforcing Bars.”
 Carefully place the beam seat/pedestal reinforcement to avoid interference with drilling holes for fixed bearing anchor
 rods. Provide a template demonstrating that the anchor rods have a 2 inch clear distance to all reinforcement for the entire
 embedment at all bearing anchor rod locations. Confirm the proper clearance to the reinforcement with the Engineer prior to
 placing the affected substructure concrete. Place the beam or girder in its final position prior to drilling or coring holes for the
 anchor rods. If reinforcement steel is encountered during the drilling or coring process, contact the Engineer, and the Engineer will
 determine how to proceed. Verify the depth of the holes in the presence of the Engineer prior to inserting the anchor rods.
 Firmly support and securely tie reinforcement bars in their proper position. Tie all outermost intersections, and enough of
 the intermediate intersections, to ensure that no shifting or displacement of the bars will occur during subsequent operations. Bar
 supports are intended to support the steel reinforcement and normal construction loads; and are not intended to, and should not be
 used to, support runways for concrete buggies or similar loads. Use black, soft iron wire of at least 16 gauge for tying the
 reinforcement bars. Do not use welded ties. Do not place concrete before the Engineer inspects and approves the placement,
 support system, and ties for the reinforcement bars.
 Provide supports with the following characteristics for reinforcement bars bearing on the falsework sheathing for exposed
 concrete surfaces:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 Stainless steel;
 Hot-dip galvanized, epoxy, vinyl, or plastic coated tips extending at least ½ inch above the sheathing; or
 Plastic.
 
 The wire coating shall not chip, peel, crack, or distort under any job conditions and temperatures.
 C.2
 Special Requirements for Bridge Slabs
 Support and tie reinforcement bars for bridge slabs in accordance with the General Requirements and the maximum
 spacing requirements specified in Table 2472-1. These spacing requirements define only the maximum permissible distances
 between ties or lines of support. Table 2472-1 does not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for providing additional supports or
 ties for holding and supporting bars firmly in their correct position.
 For bridge slabs, use slab bolsters as the primary support for the bottom transverse reinforcement bars meeting the
 requirements of “Bar Support Specifications and Standard Nomenclature” in the CRSI Manual of Standard Practice. Place the
 bolsters on the falsework sheathing in continuous lines, parallel to the beams, girders, or centerline of the roadway at locations that
 will permit placement of supports for the top transverse reinforcement bars directly over the bolsters on the bottom transverse bars.
 Use continuous lines of upper continuous high chairs with wire runners as the support system for the top transverse
 reinforcement bars. Place the high chairs to transfer load to the bottom bolsters without causing deflection in the bottom
 transverse bars. Use individual type high chairs only as supplemental support or for sections where the use of continuous type high
 chairs is not practical and the Engineer approves, in writing, the use of the individual type high chairs.
 For all interior bays on beam span bridges, place slab bolsters and upper continuous high chairs within 6 inches of the
 edge of beam flanges.
 Use tie wires to tie down the top mat of bridge slab reinforcing to the in-place beam stirrups or shear connectors at
 spacing no greater than 5 ft, as measured longitudinally along each beam.
 If the support system specified in this section is not practical, the Contractor may propose an alternative support system
 for slab span bridges or other special designs. Provide working drawings showing the proposed support system to the Engineer. If
 approved by the Engineer in writing, the Contractor may use the proposed support system.

 Support the bottom layer of longitudinal reinforcement bars for slab span bridges, cast-in-place concrete girders, beams,
 struts, and similar sections on beam bolsters or heavy beam bolsters commensurate with the mass to be supported. Do not use
 precast concrete block or brick supports on formed surfaces.
 Use the upper beam bolsters or the upper heavy beam bolsters to support subsequent layers of longitudinal bottom
 reinforcement, except for bars that can be tied to vertical bars, unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 After the completion of the placement and tying of the reinforcement bars for a section of bridge slab, and before
 ordering concrete delivery for that section, set the strike-off rails or guides to the correct elevation. Notify the Engineer when the
 section is ready for a final check. Operate the strike-off device over the entire section in the presence of the Engineer. Attach a
 filler strip, ¼ inch less in thickness than the minimum concrete cover requirement, to the bottom of the strike-off during this check
 to detect areas where the top reinforcement may encroach on the required clearance. Do not place concrete for a bridge slab
 before the Engineer inspects and approves the deck grades.
 Tie the top mat of epoxy-coated reinforcement bars at every transverse bar intersection along each continuous row of
 longitudinal bars. Tie the bottom mat of reinforcement bars and non-continuous rows of top mat bars at least at every second
 transverse bar intersection. Stagger the ties for the bottom mat along adjacent rows of longitudinal bars. Use plastic or
 nylon-coated tie wires.
 Use plastic bar supports or epoxy-coated wire bar supports with coating resistant to abrasion. Provide epoxy coating for
 bar supports at least 0.005 inch thick and in accordance with 3301, “Reinforcement Bars.” Provide plastic coated tips or additional
 epoxy coating on the legs of the supports for wire bar supports that bear on falsework sheathing for exposed concrete surfaces.
 Ensure the additional material extends at least ½ inch above the sheathing, not including portions of the supports other than the
 legs. Use a grey-colored coating with a total coating thickness on the ½ inch portion, including the initial 0.005 inches of epoxy
 coating, of at least 3/32 inch. Use incompressible and abrasion resistant plastic or epoxy material.
 C.3
 Special Requirements for Coated Bars
 The Engineer will not require the Contractor to repair damage caused during shipment of coated bars or by the
 installation procedures if the damaged area is no greater than ¼ inch × ¼ inch and the sum of damaged areas in each 1 ft length
 of bar is no greater than 2 percent of the bar surface area. Repair damage greater than ¼ inch × ¼ inch as recommended by the
 manufacturer. The Engineer will reject bars with total damage greater than 2 percent of bar surface area. Remove rejected bars.
 Ensure the total bar surface area covered by patching material is no greater than 5 percent.
 Do not flame cut coated reinforcing bar in any application.
 If using an abrasive blade to cut epoxy-coated reinforcing bar and the cut ends are properly coated with a two-part epoxy
 patching material as recommended by the manufacturer of the epoxy coating, the Department will allow cutting of epoxy-coated
 bars.
 Use a non-metallic vibrator head to consolidate the concrete around coated reinforcement bars and other components.
 D
 Splicing Metal Reinforcement
 Provide reinforcement in the lengths shown on the plans. Do not place splices unless otherwise shown on the plans or
 approved in writing by the Engineer. Place field splices at locations and with details as approved by the Engineer.

 Application of Paint
 
 E.1
 General
 For shop application of paint, submit documentation to the Quality Assurance Inspector (QAI) showing that the paint
 manufacturer's technical representative trained, all directly involved shop personnel (including QC) on the proper mixing and
 application of the coatings system for the project. Make training curriculum available to the Engineer upon request.
 Provide prime, intermediate, and finish coats of paint in accordance with 2478.2.A, “Zinc-Rich Paint Systems.” For shop
 applied duplex coating system, the hot-dip galvanize coating replaces the liquid zinc-rich prime coat.
 Do not start painting until the QAI or the Engineer approves the surface preparation and paint. Before applying paint,
 clean the surface of flash rust, dust, dirt, grease, oil, moisture, overspray, and other deleterious contaminants that will prevent the
 paint from adhering (hold point). Provide a white cloth material to the QAI for cleanliness testing.
 Apply paint to produce a smooth and uniform film free of runs, drips, sags, pinholes, blisters, mudcracking, and other
 deleterious conditions by spray application ONLY, unless a different application method is allowed in the contract. Apply paint in
 accordance with manufacturer’s printed instructions except as stated in this document. Rollers, daubers, brushes are not allowed to
 be used to apply paint, unless approved by the Engineer in writing.
 Do not apply paint to metal surfaces when weather conditions that the manufacturer’s literature defines as unsatisfactory
 are present, and when:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 The air temperature falls below 40° F;
 Metal surface temperatures are less than 5° F above the dew point;
 Water mist is in the air; and
 Metal surfaces are damp or frosted.
 
 Do not apply paint if other work operations, wind, or traffic causes the air to carry dust, dirt, or sand onto the prepared or
 newly painted metal surfaces. Do not apply spray applied paint without protective shields that prevent scattering wet paint particles
 in areas where rebounding or blowing paint particles could cause harm to persons, adjacent environment, or property. The QAI or
 Engineer will suspend spray painting operations if the Contractor does not properly control paint application.
 Do not thin paint more than as stated in the manufacturer’s written instructions. After mixing, strain the primer through
 a 30 – 60 mesh screen or a double layer of cheesecloth. Do not allow un-dispersed clumps of zinc to remain in the paint after
 mixing.
 Before applying a subsequent coat of paint, perform the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 
 Cure the previous coat to the “recoat” time as defined in the manufacturer’s Product Data Sheet; and
 Screen or scrape smooth and repaint wrinkled, detached, distorted, scuffed, abraded areas.
 
 Remove dust or chalk-like deposits. Repair or replace defective previously applied paint coats as required by the Engineer
 and at no additional cost to the Department. Apply the subsequent paint coat within the maximum time interval recommended by
 the manufacturer. If the maximum time interval is exceeded, blast the areas to SSPC-SP 10/NACE NO. 2, “Near-White Blast
 Cleaning,” and recoat at no additional cost to the Department.
 Do not paint within 2 inches of the zones requiring field welding as shown on the plans. Prepare and paint the heat
 affected areas after field welding, in accordance with this section.
 When the Contract specifies shop painting and the Contractor does not provide the specified coating(s) in the shop, apply
 the paint coat(s) for the unpainted portion at the project site.
 Submit paint repair procedures to the QAI or the Engineer for approval.
 E.2
 Spraying
 Perform power spraying using a fine, even spray. The Contractor may brush out paint applied with spray equipment to
 obtain uniform coverage and to eliminate wrinkling, blistering, sags, runs, and air holes if the brushing is done immediately. When
 spraying, maintain a “spray tip-to-surface” distance to achieve an even, wet coat, free of runs, drips, sags, overspray and dry spray.
 When using conventional air spray, equip the air lines with approved water and oil traps. Use ASTM D4285 “Standard
 Test Method for Indicating Oil or Water in Compressed Air” to ensure the compressed air is oil and water free.
 E.3
 Rollers, Brushes, and Daubers
 This section may only be used with written permission from the Engineer.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 375
 
 2478.3
 The Contractor may apply paint by rolling, brushing, or daubers in areas unsuitable for spray painting, such as small
 surface areas where over-spray would be excessive, and small areas requiring paint repair.
 If using brushes, manipulate the paint under the brush to provide a smooth, uniform coating over the entire surface,
 including corners and crevices. Perform final brush strokes horizontal and parallel to each other. Remove brush hairs on the paint
 surface.
 Equip the paint pot with an approved agitator during application of paint by rolling, brushing, or daubers.
 F
 
 Paint Coats
 
 F.1
 Measurement of Paint Thickness
 The Department refers to “Dry Film Thickness” (DFT) when using the term “thickness” in this section. Use a properly
 calibrated thickness gage to measure the paint thickness and average thickness meeting, at a minimum, the requirements of SSPCPA 2, “Measurement of Dry Coating Thickness with Magnetic Gages.” Measure paint thickness from the top of the peaks of the
 blast profile.
 Perform painting operations as recommended by the manufacturer’s literature, unless otherwise specified in this section.
 If the manufacturer’s recommended DFT differs from the DFT in accordance with this section, submit a request in writing to the
 Engineer before painting to determine the DFT deviation from the manufacturer’s written recommendations.
 Refer to 2478.3.J for deficient paint thickness.
 F.2
 
 Stripe Coats
 
 Before applying prime coat, apply a stripe coat on the edges, corners, seams, crevices, interior angles, junctions of joining
 members, rivets or bolt heads, nuts and threads, weld lines, and similar irregularities. Ensure the stripe coat completely hides the
 surface to be covered. Apply the prime coat on top of the stripe coat before it is fully cured, to its specified thickness as defined in
 this section, and after the QAI or the Engineer accepts the stripe coat (hold point).
 Apply the stripe coat per 2478.3.E.
 F.3
 Prime Coat
 Apply the stripe coat and primer coat after preparing the surface in accordance with this section and as approved by the
 QAI or the Engineer and before the surface rusts.
 Equip the paint pot with an agitator during spray painting work. Provide an agitator or stirring rod capable of reaching
 within 2 inches of the bottom of the pot to keep the paint mixed during application.
 Apply prime coat to a DFT as stated in Table 2478-2, with no spot reading measuring less than the minimum primer DFT
 listed, unless the manufacturer requires otherwise. Remain within the maximum DFT limits as defined by the manufacturer.

 after the intermediate cures to the “dry-to-topcoat,” as defined in the manufacturer’s Product Data Sheet. Ensure the finish coat
 color matches the color standard required by the contract. Assure the supplied product meets the requirements of 3501, "Basic
 Requirements for Paints." Per 3501, provide a color draw down sample on a Leneta chart per ASTM D2805, "Standard Test Method
 for Hiding Power of Paints by Reflectometry" to the Engineer. The Department requires an acceptable initial draw down sample
 prior to beginning any work because color testing is the initial control for the quality of the product.
 Apply the finish paint coat to intermediate coated surfaces exposed in the completed structure. Ensure the finished
 surface is uniform in color and free of visible lap marks and other blemishes.
 Apply the finish paint coat per 2478.3.E (hold point).
 Fillet seal crevices and cavities along the edge of faying surfaces that are separated by 1/16 inch or more with an approved
 sealant that is listed on the Approved/Qualified Products List for Bridge Structural Steel Coating Sealants and apply per the coating
 manufacturer installation instructions. Do not seal the bottom edge of vertical faying surfaces allowing the juncture to release
 trapped moisture. Ensure the sealant color is a match to the finish paint color by submitting a sample to the MnDOT lab for color
 approval or utilize an approved clear caulk. Apply the caulk in a smooth manner (hold point).
 F.6
 
 Total Paint Thickness
 
 Ensure the total paint thickness of the entire paint system averages at least 10 mils but remains in the maximum
 thickness limits defined by the manufacturer of the paint system. If the Engineer finds total paint thickness deficient or excessive
 over any part of a structure and if the Engineer does not require additional paint applications or removal of paint, the Department
 will reduce payment for the appropriate item of work.
 G
 Markings for Identification
 Stencil the year of painting and the specification numbers of the prime, intermediate, and top coats in numerals 3 inches
 high on the interior surface of fascia beams, at the same corner displaying the bridge name plate and at the corner diagonally
 opposite that corner (example: 2018 2478).
 G.1
 Stenciling after Primer
 When the primer is applied in the shop, ensure the fabricator/painter stencils the name of the paint manufacturer and the
 primer product name applied in the shop on the inside web of both fascia girders in characters 3 inches high and in a contrasting
 color compatible with the specified paint system.

 Fasteners
 
 H.1
 Requirements for Coating
 Remove all organic or other material that would interfere with the adhesion of the coating. The Contractor may use
 industrial cleaning solutions to remove fastener lubricants if the solutions do not contaminate or interfere with adherence of
 subsequently applied coating materials as approved by the QAI or the Engineer. Adhesion tests may be required by the Engineer to
 prove that there is no interference, at no additional cost to the Department.
 H.2
 Paint Thickness Requirements
 After installing fasteners and after removing lubricant and residuals from exposed parts of fasteners, apply additional
 primer to meet the required primer thickness as defined in this section. Provide the required thickness of the intermediate and
 finish coats to fasteners as defined in this section.
 I
 Handling, Storage, and Shipping of Painted Steel
 Do not apply paint to members loaded for shipment except to apply touch-up paint as approved by the QAI or the
 Engineer.
 Do not damage the painted steel in the shop and field during shipping, erection, and construction of the bridge and
 components. Do not move or handle the painted steel items until the coating cures in accordance with the manufacturer's data
 sheet (hold point). Use nylon straps, padded hooks, slings, or other non-metallic lifting devices to protect coated components or
 products during handling and loading. Use softeners and edge protection devices to protect the steel from binding chains. Provide
 padded hooks and slings to hoist the painted components.
 Store completed items in accordance with 1606, “Storage of Materials,” and the following:

 Inspect and store bundles, members, or items in one general location before final acceptance unless otherwise
 approved by the QAI or the Engineer.
 
 Support individual items or bundles of coated products in transit in a manner that will prevent damage to the coating. Do
 not drop or drag individual items or bundles of coated products. Pad when shipping, bundling, or banding materials to protect the
 components from direct contact with packaging materials that may damage the coated products finish. Use softeners and edge
 protection devices in conjunction with high-density foam or other acceptable packaging materials at all points of contact.
 J
 Paint Repair
 The Contractor may use a “Tooke Gauge” to perform a destructive test to measure the DFT, at no additional cost to the
 Department, if it is not possible to satisfactorily determine the coating thickness of any paint coat after application. Repair the
 destructively tested area as approved by the Engineer and at no additional cost to the Department. Do not perform mechanical
 grinding to reduce paint thickness. Completely remove and recoat the paint system with deficient or excessive paint thickness, as
 defined in this section, for prime, intermediate, or topcoat if directed by the Engineer.
 Submit paint repair procedures to the Engineer in writing for acceptance.

 Application of Paint
 
 E.1
 General
 For shop application of paint, submit documentation to the Quality Assurance Inspector (QAI) showing that the paint
 manufacturer's technical representative trained, all directly involved shop personnel (including QC) on the proper mixing and
 application of the coatings system for the project. Make training curriculum available to the Engineer upon request.
 Provide prime, intermediate, and finish coats of paint in accordance with 2479.2.A, “Zinc-Rich Paint Systems.”
 Do not start painting until the QAI or the Engineer approves the surface preparation and paint. Before applying paint,
 clean the surface of flash rust, dust, dirt, grease, oil, moisture, overspray, and all other deleterious contaminants that will prevent
 the paint from adhering (hold point).
 Apply paint to produce a smooth and uniform film free of runs, drips, sags, pinholes, blisters, mudcracking, and other
 deleterious conditions by spray application ONLY, unless a different application method is allowed in the contract. Apply paint in
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 383
 
 2479.3
 accordance with manufacturer’s printed instructions except as stated in this document. Rollers, daubers, brushes are not allowed to
 be used to apply paint, unless approved by the Engineer in writing.
 Do not apply paint to metal surfaces when weather conditions that the manufacturer’s literature defines as unsatisfactory
 are present, and when:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 The air temperature falls below 40° F,
 Metal surface temperatures are less than 5° F above the dew point,
 Water mist is in the air, and
 Metal surfaces are damp or frosted.
 
 Do not apply paint if other work operations, wind, or traffic causes the air to carry dust, dirt, or sand onto the prepared or
 newly painted metal surfaces. Do not apply spray painted paint without protective shields that prevent scattering wet paint
 particles in areas where rebounding or blowing paint particles cause harm to persons, adjacent environment, or property. The QAI
 or Engineer will suspend spray painting operations if the Contractor does not properly control paint application.
 Do not thin paint more than what is stated in the manufacturer’s written instructions. After mixing, strain the primer
 through a 30–60 mesh screen or a double layer of cheesecloth. Do not allow un-dispersed clumps of zinc to remain in the paint
 after mixing.
 Before applying a subsequent coat of paint, perform the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 
 Cure the previous coat to the “recoat” time defined in the manufacturer’s Product Data Sheet, and
 Screen or scrape smooth and repaint wrinkled, detached, distorted, scuffed, or abraded areas.
 
 Remove dust or chalk-like deposits. Repair or replace defective previously applied paint coats as required by the Engineer
 and at no additional cost to the Department. Apply the subsequent paint coat within the maximum time interval recommended by
 the manufacturer. If the maximum time interval is exceeded blast the areas to SSPC-SP 10/NACE NO. 2, “Near-White Blast
 Cleaning,” and recoat at no additional cost to the Department.
 Do not paint within 2 inches of the zones requiring field welding as shown on the plans. Prepare and paint the heat
 affected areas after field welding in accordance with this section.
 When the contract specifies shop painting and the Contractor does not provide the specified coating(s) in the shop, apply
 the paint coat(s) for unpainted portion at the project site.
 Submit paint repair procedures to the QAI or the Engineer for approval.
 E.2
 Spraying
 Perform power spraying using a fine, even spray. The Contractor may brush out paint applied with spray equipment to
 obtain uniform coverage and to eliminate wrinkling, blistering, sags, runs, and air holes if the brushing is done immediately.
 E.3
 Rollers, Brushes, and Daubers
 This section may only be used with written permission from the Engineer.
 The Contractor may apply paint by rolling, brushing, or daubers in areas unsuitable for spray painting, such as small
 surface areas where over-spray would be excessive, and small areas requiring paint repair.
 If using brushes, manipulate the paint under the brush to provide a smooth, uniform coating over the entire surface,
 including corners and crevices. Perform final brush strokes horizontal and parallel to each other. Remove brush hairs on the paint
 surface.
 Equip the paint pot with an approved agitator during application of zinc-rich paint by rolling, brushing, or daubers.
 F
 
 Paint Coats
 
 F.1
 Measurement of Paint Thickness
 The Department refers to “Dry Film Thickness” (DFT) when using the term “thickness” in this section. Use a properly
 calibrated thickness gage to measure the paint thickness and average thickness meeting the requirements of SSPC-PA 2,
 “Measurement of Dry Coating Thickness with Magnetic Gages.” Measure paint thickness from the top of the peaks of the blast
 profile.
 Perform painting operations as recommended by the manufacturer’s literature, unless otherwise specified in this section.
 If the manufacturer’s recommended DFT differs from the DFT in accordance with this section, submit a request in writing to the
 Engineer before painting to approve the DFT deviation to the manufacturer’s written recommendations.

 pipe.
 
 Provide backfill material in accordance with the plan, modified to 100 percent passing the 3 inch sieve within 2 ft of the
 
 Use metal connecting bands, centered over the joint, to join metal pipe sections. Place the pipe sections so that the pipe
 ends are abutting. Tighten the band to ensure a tight joint so that the soil does not infiltrate into the pipe and the sections do not
 pull apart.
 Use approved fasteners, as defined in the applicable materials specifications, to assemble structural plate culverts as
 required by the manufacturer. Tighten bolts after assembly to a torque of 100 lbf•ft to 300 lbf•ft. Provide a calibrated torque
 wrench to demonstrate the adequacy of the bolt tightening, as approved by the Engineer.
 Where beveled ends on metal pipe are shown on the plans or standard plates, cut the bevels at right angles to a vertical
 plane through the longitudinal axis of the pipe.
 C.3
 Concrete Culvert
 Lay concrete pipe with the female end of each section upgrade. Tightly join the pipe sections so that the interior of the
 pipe sections abut each other.
 Use preformed rubber or bituminous mastic elastic joint sealer material to provide flexible water-tight joint seals for
 concrete pipe. Where the pipe is designed to accommodate preformed gasket type seals, seal the joints with the preformed gasket
 as shown on the plans and meeting the performance requirements of 3726, “Preformed Plastic, Type B.”
 Where the pipe is not required to accommodate preformed gasket type seals, seal the joints with bituminous mastic and
 a full circumferential wrap of geotextile material extending at least 1 ft on each side of the joint. Secure the circumferential wrap
 against the outside of the pipe by metal or plastic strapping or by other methods approved by the Engineer.
 Apply mastic joint sealer materials as recommended by the manufacturer. Wipe joints clean on the inside after sealing.
 Plug lifting holes with a precast concrete plug, sealed and covered with mastic or mortar.
 Use approved fasteners shown on Standard Plate 3145 to tie together concrete culvert sections unless otherwise shown
 on the plans or specified in the special provisions.
 Provide backfill material in accordance with the plan, modified to 100 percent passing the 3 inch sieve within 2 ft of the
 pipe.

 Place pipes and backfill in dry conditions by controlling the water conditions. Dewater groundwater and divert surface
 runoff to keep the water level below the pipe foundation.
 Place pipes on the bedding starting at the downstream end with the female end of each section upgrade.
 Make connections with bell and spigot joints using an elastomeric rubber seal (gasket) to provide water-tight joints that
 do not allow soil, silt, or water to migrate through the joint. Install joints so connected pipe sections form a continuous surface free
 of irregularities in the flow line. Tightly join the pipe sections so that the interior of the pipe sections abut each other. Keep
 gaskets and joint surfaces clean and free from soil during installation. Follow manufacturer’s recommendation for fitting or coupling
 assembly and installation. Use a lubricant, if required, that will not deteriorate the gasket and pipe materials.
 Before allowing vehicles or heavy construction equipment to travel over the pipe trench, maintain a minimum cover depth
 of material above the pipe of at least 2 ft and meeting the requirements of AASHTO LRFD Bridge Construction Specifications,
 Section 30, Table 30.6-1.
 Perform deflection testing of all plastic pipe at least 30 days after installation. Remove obstructions such as sediment,
 standing water or safety grates that would interfere with deflection testing. Dewatering and additional work associated with
 preparing for and performing deflection testing is included in the bid price of the pipe.
 Evaluate the pipe to determine if the specific internal diameter of the barrel has deflected more than 5 percent. Use
 the following methods to perform the deflection test unless specified in the plan:
 (1)
 
 Visual inspection alone is not allowed for deflection testing.
 
 (2)
 
 Use a nine-point mandrel approved by the Engineer to perform deflection testing for pipes. Pull the mandrel
 through the pipe using non-mechanical means.
 
 (3)
 
 Direct measurements cannot be used for deflection testing unless specified in the plans and approved by the
 Engineer. Direct measurements can only be used on pipes with an inside diameter of 30 inches or greater. If
 the Department allows direct measurements, the Engineer must take measurements at randomly select
 locations, but at a minimum once every 10 ft throughout the pipe length and at the pipe ends. Visually inspect
 the pipe and take additional measurements at any location of observed anomaly or deflection. Ensure
 personnel making direct measurements meet confined space entry requirements in accordance with 1706,
 “Employee Health and Welfare.”
 
 (4)
 
 Laser scan inspection (laser ring) can be used to perform deflection testing when specified in the plans and
 approved by the Engineer.
 
 The Engineer will not accept pipe that has a deflection of more than 5 percent or is damaged. Remove unacceptable pipe
 and reinstall new pipe or undamaged deformed pipe. Re-test the re-laid pipe for deflection at least 5 calendar days after
 embedment material is installed to grade.
 Send deflection testing results to the State Hydraulic Engineer with the S.P. number, pipe location, material type, size,
 date built, date tested, and results from the mandrel test or other deflection test.
 C.5
 Extending In-Place Culverts
 Clear in-place culverts of obstructions to water flow before placing the extension pipe. The Engineer will only require the
 removal of sediment to the extent that improved flow is likely to be maintained.
 Follow backfill and bedding requirements for culvert material type.
 If the pipe ends differ because of changed design, make the connection to the in-place culvert as shown on the plans or
 as approved by the Engineer.

 SUBSURFACE DRAINS
 
 2502.1 DESCRIPTION
 This work consists of constructing subsurface drains and installing plant-fabricated pipe and appurtenant materials to
 perform the following:
 (1) Collect and discharge water infiltrating the pavement system (pavement edge drain),
 (2) Collect and discharge water accumulated in the bottom of a granular-backfilled subcut, cut off, or intercept ground
 water flowing toward the roadway (subcut drain), and
 (3) Collect and discharge water coming from a permeable aggregate base system (permeable aggregate base drain).
 Subsurface drains include materials used to collect ground water and conduct it to a discharge point at a structure or on a
 side slope. The typical system includes a drain pipe, radial connecting pipe, discharge pipe, and drain outlet.
 2502.2 MATERIALS
 Provide one of the following types of drain pipe as shown or allowed as an option on the plans. Provide fittings
 connecting multiple lengths of drain pipe made of the same material as the pipe. Provide nonperforated pipe except where the
 perforated type is shown on the plans. The Contractor may use pipe meeting the lowest strength class listed in the referenced
 materials specification, unless higher strength pipe is shown on the plans or specified in the special provisions. Provide
 nonperforated Thermoplastic (TP) pipe for discharge pipe, radial connecting pipe, and associated fittings. Provide special
 fabrication or jointing details, if shown on the plans or as approved by the Engineer. Provide appurtenances, geotextiles, metal
 oversleeves with rodent screens, and precast concrete headwalls with all subsurface drains for high bridge abutments, to intercept
 and carry off underground water in accordance with this section, 3245, “Thermoplastic Pipe,” 3733, “Geotextiles,” and as shown on
 the plans.

 2502.3 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 A
 Excavation
 Excavate the trench to the lines and grades as shown on the plans. Provide a trench with a width, as measured at the
 bottom of the excavation, at least the nominal pipe width plus two times the pipe diameter. The Contractor may use corrugated PE
 drainage tubing when placed in a narrow, controlled-width trench constructed by a chain-type or wheel-type trenching machine
 designed and used for this application and as approved by the Engineer. Use other types of rigid pipe for other uses in narrow
 trenches where compaction is not controlled. Do not install PE tubing by plowing.
 Remove rock encountered within the excavation to a width of at least the nominal pipe width plus two times the pipe
 diameter and to a depth of at least one pipe diameter below the bottom of the pipe. Except for locations shown on the plans or
 specified in this specification that require granular material, the Contractor may backfill below the bottom of the pipe with material
 meeting 2105.1.A.6 “Select Grading Material”, compacted uniformly per 2105.3.F.2, “Quality Compaction” to provide a proper
 foundation as approved by the Engineer.
 B
 Laying Drains
 Bed perforated pipe drains on fine filter aggregate. Provide aggregate in accordance with 3149.2.J.2, “Fine Filter
 Aggregate,” with a thickness of at least one pipe diameter below the bottom of the pipe, and extending upwards under the
 haunches for the full width and length of the trench, to the elevation shown on the plans or specified in this specification for the
 specified foundation preparations.
 The Engineer will not require granular bedding on nonperforated pipe installations unless otherwise shown on the plans,
 however do not place stones greater than 1 in in diameter in the trench.
 Shape the foundation for drains in the required bedding material to fit at least the lower 30 percent of the outside
 circumference of the pipe. Lay drains to line and grade shown on the plans, with uniform bearing along the drain and with the
 perforations down, unless otherwise directed.
 Wrap perforated pipe with factory-seamed or factory-produced continuous knit weave geotextile. Place the fabric seam
 at the top of the pipe, opposite the perforations. For seams at fittings or connectors, mechanically fasten or overlap the adjoining
 geotextiles at least 6 in.
 Join pipe sections with the coupling bands or fittings. Cement solvent type joints unless otherwise shown on the plans or
 specified in the specification. Close upgrade ends of subdrain pipe with caps. Use wyes or bends at junctions and turns suitable for
 cleaning and inspection.
 Where a drain connects with a structure or catch basin, make a connection that does not leak through the wall of the
 structure. Unless otherwise shown on the plans or specified in the specifications, terminate drainage outfalls at a standard precast
 concrete headwall.
 C
 Backfill and Compaction For Perforated Pipe
 Backfill drains while making the pipe installations. Backfill with material as per the plan. For perforated pipe installations,
 if plan does not designate material type, backfill with material meeting 3149.2.J.2, “Fine Filter Aggregate”, to an elevation to the
 bottom of the surface coarse. Do not use stones greater than 1 in for backfilling. Compact material in accordance with 2105.3.F,
 “Compacting Embankments.”
 D
 
 Drain Outlets
 
 D.1
 Precast Concrete Headwall
 Place precast concrete headwall outlet inverts at least 6 in, 12 in (preferred), above ditch grades. Place the uppermost
 point of the headwall flush with the in-slope at a downward grade of at least 2 percent to provide for drainage. Shape the earthen
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications

 2502.3
 side slopes adjacent to the headwall to conform to the sides and toe of the headwall. Compact the soils around and under the
 concrete headwall outlet per 2105.3.F.2, Quality Compaction.”
 If headwalls are not placed during installation of discharge pipes, mark discharge points to locate in the future. Screen
 the drain opening, and allow the drain to remain open and operational after installation. Unless otherwise approved by the
 Engineer, place concrete headwalls on discharge pipes before the end of the construction season. For pipes without headwalls,
 leave screened pipe ends open and free-flowing.
 D.2
 Discharge Pipe
 Provide nonperforated rigid TP pipe in accordance with 3245, “Thermoplastic Pipe,” for discharge pipe and connections.
 Use a 4 in diameter TP discharge pipe for 3 in and 4 in PE subsurface drains. Use a 6 in diameter TP discharge pipe for 6 in PE
 subsurface drains. Use a 3 in × 4 in TP adapter to make the connection between the 3 in PE subsurface drain and the 4 in
 diameter × 12 in straight length of TP pipe. Connect the 4 in PE subsurface drain to the 4 in diameter × 12 in straight length of TP
 pipe with a TP connector. Use a 90 degree, solvent-weld, bell and spigot elbow with a radius of at least 3 ft to make the
 connection between the 12 in length TP pipe and the variable length straight TP discharge pipe. The Contractor may use different
 configurations for similar size, radius, and pipe quality as approved by the Engineer.
 Construct the discharge pipe to the drain outlet while constructing the drains. Place the discharge pipe and the drains at
 right angles to the roadway centerline. Fully couple the discharge pipe to the headwall as approved by the Engineer. Make
 connections with one of the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 3A Grout,
 Rubber gasket on the pipe,
 Rubber or plastic gasket cast into the headwall, or
 Solvent or gasket joint into a TP coupling cast into the headwall.
 
 Ensure the coupling will secure the pipe and prevent separation caused by small movements of the headwall.
 Provide a 12 in straight length of TP connecting pipe to connect the PE subsurface drain to the TP discharge pipe. Attach
 this connector pipe to the PE edge drain with a radius of at least 3 ft to provide entry for probes, cleaners, or video cameras.
 Secure connections and solvent joints to prevent soil intrusion and decoupling during backfilling. At joints with the possibility for
 soil intrusion, wrap connections with geotextile as directed by the Engineer. Tape joints to prevent separation as directed by the
 Engineer. Orient increasers with the “smooth flow” portion at the pipe invert. Use connection and coupling methods as approved
 by the Engineer.
 Connect two drain runs that come together at a low point with a TP “Y” connection. Use a TP discharge pipe to outlet the
 “Y” connection to a single headwall.
 Construct the discharge trench similar to the drains and backfill the discharge trench with the disturbed in-place soil.
 Place discharge pipes at grades no less than the drain pipes and with at least 2 percent fall. The Engineer may approve
 trench widths greater than 10 in for the discharge pipes, if the Contractor meets the following requirements:
 (1) Cradle the pipe invert,
 (2) Compact soil adjacent to and above the pipe to prevent crushing the pipe, and
 (3) Compact the backfill soil in accordance with 2105.3.F, “Compacting Embankments.”
 Use compaction equipment capable of compacting the material in the drain trench without compacting the adjacent soils.
 Use backfill layer uncompacted thicknesses no greater than 6 in. Correct shoulder settlement above the discharge pipe as directed
 by the Engineer and at no additional cost to the Department. Replace crushed or deformed discharge pipes or connections at no
 additional cost to the Department.
 If drains discharge to storm sewers rather than through headwalls, place the drain invert from 6 in to 12 in above the
 sewer invert using a connection method approved by the Engineer at no additional cost to the Department.
 D.3
 Turf Establishment
 Perform turf establishment per specification 2575.3.L, “Turf Establishment”, concurrent with drain outlet installation.
 
 D.4
 Marking Outlet Locations
 Permanently mark the locations of outlets with a 6 in × 18 in strip of white marking tape in accordance with 3354,
 “Preformed Pavement Marking Tape for Permanent Traffic Lane Delineation and Legends.” Place the tape at the outside edge of
 the bituminous shoulder, at right angles to the roadway, and roll the tape into the shoulder while the bituminous pavement surface
 temperature is from 120 °F to 150 °F. If two runs of drain pipe come together at a low point and discharge via a “Y” to a single
 outlet, place two markings side-by-side with a 6 in spacing. For locations with no bituminous shoulder, place the tape on the
 
 396
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2502.3
 bituminous pavement or spray a white paint strip on concrete pavements. The Engineer may approve alternate methods to mark
 the edge drain outlets.
 D.5
 Inspection and Cleanout
 Once installed, maintain the discharge pipe and headwalls to prevent trapping water in the pipe. Inspect the discharge
 pipe and headwalls for proper grade, cleanliness, proper landscaping, proper erosion control installation and maintenance, and
 satisfactory operating condition. Maintain the discharge pipe and headwalls until final inspection with the Engineer.
 The Engineer will perform inspections using a probe mounted on the end of a flexible fiberglass rod 4 in long and with a
 diameter of one nominal pipe size smaller than the drain pipe being inspected. The Engineer will conduct the inspection through
 the discharge pipe, radius connection, and at least 3 ft into the main drainage line. Clean or repair inoperative discharge pipe and
 connections as approved by the Engineer at no additional cost to the Department.
 E
 Permeable Aggregate Base Type
 Construct subsurface drains to collect and discharge water coming from the following permeable aggregate base systems:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 Permeable Asphalt Stabilized Base (PASB),
 Open Graded Aggregate Base (OGAB), or
 Permeable Asphalt Stabilized Stress Relief Course (PASSRC)
 Drainable Stable Base (DSB)
 
 Provide geotextile for trench lining in accordance with 3733, “Geotextiles,” Type I. Provide perforated corrugated PE
 drainage tubing in accordance with 3278, “Corrugated Polyethylene Drainage Tubing.” Provide aggregate in accordance with
 3149.2.J.1, “Medium Filter Aggregate.”
 E.1
 Trenching
 Use a machine trencher capable of cutting the trench and placing the pipe in a continuous operation to place the drains.
 Do not plow. If the off-set between the tracks or tires of the trencher is greater than 6 in, use a self-leveling trenching machine.
 Provide trenching equipment designed and operated to prevent the excavated material from falling back into the trench. Construct
 a trench from 7 in to 10 in wide. Shape the bottom of the trench to cradle the lower one-third of the pipe. Place pipes in grades
 following pavement grades at the design depth shown on the plans. The Contractor may place the geotextile, pipe and medium
 filter aggregate while trenching or in a separate operation immediately after trenching. When using separate operations to place
 the pipe and medium filter aggregate, properly align the pipe in the cradle before placing the medium filter aggregate.
 If the trench sides are sloughing or caving in, use a shield to place the medium filter aggregate.
 The Contractor may trench drains constructed in conjunction with stabilized PASB immediately adjacent to the placed
 pavement. Place drains constructed in conjunction with unstabilized OGAB or DSB 6 in away from the pavement edge to minimize
 undercutting. The edge drain must intersect the PASB, DSB, or OGAB.
 Place drains constructed in conjunction with PCC pavement after pavement placement. Place drains constructed in
 conjunction with bituminous pavement after placement of the wear/non-wear courses and before placement of the final wearing
 course to avoid damage to the finished pavement. Construct drains before placing the additional aggregate base in the shoulder
 area.
 Dispose of materials removed by the trenching operation off the right-of-way unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 Do not contaminate the permeable aggregate base, the medium filter aggregate, or the aggregate base. Sweep trenching spoils off
 the bituminous pavement before placing the wearing course, as approved by the Engineer.
 E.2
 Geotextile Trench Lining
 Line the bottom of the drainage trench with geotextile. Do not wrap the PE pipe with geotextile. On the pavement side
 of the trench, terminate the geotextile within the aggregate base located below the permeable aggregate base. Do not extend the
 geotextile up onto the permeable aggregate base or allow it to fall below the bottom of the aggregate base. Do not allow the
 geotextile to lap up onto the permeable aggregate base. On the side of the trench farthest from the pavement, the Contractor may
 terminate the geotextile within or above the aggregate base, but not below it.
 E.3
 Compaction
 Moisten the medium filter aggregate to allow easy placement and vibratory compaction as approved by the Engineer. Do
 not use the tire-rolling method to compact medium filter aggregate. After placement and compaction, ensure the top of the
 medium filter aggregate is at least as high as the top of the permeable aggregate base.

 Place aggregate base in the shoulder area over the compacted drain and backfilled trench, to avoid contamination.
 Remove and replace contaminated materials at no additional cost to the Department. Allow the drain to remain open and operative
 after installation to prevent water from collecting in the pipe.
 F
 Subcut Drain Type
 Construct subcut drains in accordance with this section and the option details shown on the plan. Use subcut drains to
 collect and discharge infiltration water that may accumulate in the bottom of granular-backfilled subcuts. The Contractor may also
 use subcut drains to control high groundwater conditions.
 Unless otherwise shown on the plans or specified in the special provisions, the Contractor may construct the drains using
 one of the following design options:
 (1) Place 4 in perforated TP pipe in accordance with 3245, “Thermoplastic Pipe,” in the bottom corner of the subcut and
 then backfill the subcut or
 (2) Backfill the subcut and then use a machine trencher to place 4 in perforated corrugated PE pipe in accordance with
 3278, “Corrugated Polyethylene Drainage Tubing.”
 For both design options, wrap the pipe with geotextile in accordance with 3733, “Geotextiles,” Type I. Provide Fine Filter
 Aggregate in accordance with 3149.2.J.2, “Fine Filter Aggregate.”
 The Contractor may directly connect subcut drains to permanent drainage structures or outlet the drains to the ditch
 using a discharge pipe and headwall. If shown on the plans, make connections to drainage structures as approved by the Engineer.
 The Department will include the cost of connections with other relevant contract pay items.
 Place pipe as shown on the plans or as approved by the Engineer. Provide drain grades of at least 0.2 percent and place
 ditch outlets at low points and spaced no greater than 500 ft apart. The Contractor may place structure outlets spaced no greater
 than 800 ft apart if both ends of the pipe are tied to structures. If pipe grades do not follow the roadway profile at a constant
 depth, provide and use laser grade control equipment to place TP pipe and PE pipe.
 F.1
 Design Option One
 Place 4 in perforated TP pipe in the bottom of the subcut in accordance with the design typical in the plans. Place at
 least 12 in of subcut backfill above the pipe before compacting.
 The Contractor may provide pipe with either bell and spigot or sleeve couplings and either gasket or solvent joints. Leave
 solvent joints uncemented unless otherwise directed by the Engineer. Mark the depth on the ends of the bell or sleeve. Place the
 perforations down. Provide connections to drainage structures made of angle fittings no greater than 22½ degrees.
 F.2
 Design Option Two
 Place 4 in perforated corrugated PE tubing after partially or totally backfilling the subcut.
 Use a machine trencher capable of performing the following functions to place the drains:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 Cutting the trench,
 Shaping the trench bottom to cradle the lower one-third of the pipe,
 Laying the pipe, and
 Backfilling with filter aggregate in one simultaneous and continuous operation.
 
 Do not plow. Equip the trenching head with a shield to prevent adjacent material from caving. Trench to a width from
 8 in to 10 in and center the pipe in the trench.
 Backfill the trench with fine filter aggregate. Provide free flowing filter aggregate and vibratory compaction as approved
 by the Engineer. In addition to the required trench compaction, make at least one pass of the roller as directed by the Engineer
 over the trench before placing the overlying pavement structure as shown on the plans.
 Perform the trenching operation after placing and compacting at least 24 in of subcut backfill. If trenching after
 completely backfilling the subcut, only backfill the lowermost 24 in of the trench with Fine Filter Aggregate. Backfill the remaining
 trench with the same material used for the subcut and compact to the compaction requirements in 2105.3.F, “Compacting
 Embankments.”
 G
 Pavement Edge Drain Type
 Construct 3 in diameter edge drains. Use pavement edge drains to collect and discharge water infiltrating into the
 pavement system from rain or snow melt, and spring-thaw seepage.
 Provide perforated corrugated PE tubing for edge drain pipe in accordance with 3278, “Corrugated Polyethylene Drainage
 Tubing.” Wrap the pipe with geotextile in accordance with 3733, “Geotextiles,” Type I to prevent infiltration of fine filter aggregate
 into the perforated pipe. Trench backfill with fine filter aggregate in accordance with 3149.2.J.2, “Fine Filter Aggregate.”
 
 398
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2502.3
 Place drains adjacent to new pavements after constructing the pavement to prevent damage to the drain or discharge
 pipe. Use a machine trencher capable of cutting the trench and laying the pipe in a continuous operation to place the drains. Do
 not plow. Provide trenching equipment designed and operated to prevent excavated material from falling back into the trench. Use
 a self-leveling trenching machine, if the off-set between tracks or tires of the trencher is greater than 6 in. Trench to a width from
 6 in to 10 in. Shape the bottom of the trench to cradle the lower one-third of the pipe. If pipe grades do not follow pavement
 grades at a constant depth, provide and use laser grade control equipment to place pipe.
 Install the edge drains before pavement cracking when cracking in-place PCC pavement before overlay.
 If placing drains in conjunction with pavement widening, place the drains before excavating the widening-trench. Use an
 approved device on the trenching machine to ensure that the pipe is located at the design distance from the edge of the in-place
 pavement. After compaction, ensure the filter aggregate in the drain extends at least 4 in above the bottom of the pavement
 widening trench.
 For drains placed next to a PCC pavement, run the trenching head tight against the pavement to completely excavate all
 adjacent soil.
 If placing the drain next to a new bituminous pavement, construct the drain after placing the pavement base and leveling
 courses, but before placing the wearing course, to avoid damage to the finished pavement. For new and retrofit construction,
 ensure the trenching head continuously intercepts and cuts-off the roll-over portion of at least the lower bituminous pavement
 course. Ensure the trenching spoils always show evidence of bituminous materials. Clean spoils from the pavement before placing
 the wearing course for new pavements or the first bituminous lift for overlays as approved by the Engineer.
 For bituminous shoulders remaining in place after drain placement, use a coulter, saw, milling mandrel, or other method
 by the Engineer on the bituminous shoulder to leave a smooth edge and to prevent disturbance to the bituminous pavement.
 For new construction, place the aggregate base before trenching, except for bituminous pavements, place the aggregate
 base to the height of the adjacent layer at the time of trenching.
 Provide drains on grades at least 0.2 percent and place outlets to the ditch at a spacing no greater than 500 ft and at low
 points as shown on the plans.
 The Contractor may place the filter aggregate backfill simultaneously with the pipe or in a separate operation immediately
 following the trenching activity. If placing the pipe and filter aggregate in separate operations, align the pipe in the shaped cradle
 before placing the filter aggregate. If soil type or Contractor operations cause sloughing or caving from either side of the trench,
 use a shield on the trenching head and place filter aggregate within the shield as directed by the Engineer.
 Surplus excavated materials not used for backfill shall become the property of the Contractor. Dispose of surplus material
 in accordance with the disposal form submitted to and approved by the Engineer.
 Before beginning routine trenching and backfilling, construct a test trench at least 50 ft long that has the same
 requirements as the production work. The Engineer will measure adequacy of compaction in the test trench with a
 Department-supplied Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP).
 Compact the filter aggregate with equipment capable of achieving the following compaction requirement. The
 Department defines successful compaction as penetration resistances no greater than 3 in per DCP hammer blow. The Engineer
 will base successful compaction on the average of three DCP readings for similar depths in three tests taken 10 ft apart.
 Do not compact greater than 24 in of filter aggregate in any one layer. After compaction and leveling, extend the filter
 aggregate up onto the adjacent pavement as shown on the plans.
 If capping filter aggregate trench with another type of granular material or bituminous mixture as shown on the plans,
 place and compact the materials separately from the filter aggregate and do not compact with future placement of similar material.
 Heap bituminous caps at least 1 in and roll. Place granular caps at least 1 in high and roll. Place caps to provide support for
 overlying material and to incorporate a second compaction effort in the trench.
 Do not contaminate the filter aggregate. Do not deposit or mix aggregates or other soils on the adjoining concrete or
 bituminous pavement. Remove material spilled on the pavement surface by sweeping.
 After placing the drain and discharge pipe, do not allow construction equipment to travel over the drain or discharge pipe
 until the system is covered as approved by the Engineer. Allow the drain to remain open and operational after installation to
 prevent water from collecting in the pipe.

 H
 Interceptor Drains
 Install narrow, aggregate-filled Interceptor Drains, as described herein, and as shown in the plan, at the end of each
 pavement joint and at mid-panel cracks, or at other major cracks as designated by the Engineer. These trenches connect into the
 Subsurface Drains (Permeable Aggregate Base Type) and permit water collecting in the joints and cracks to drain to the adjacent
 drainage system.
 H.1
 Materials Requirements
 (A) Provide Medium Filter Aggregate meeting 3149.2.J.1.
 H.2
 Installation Requirements
 Cut trenches for the interceptor drains 4 to 6 inches in width, centered on the joint or crack, cut normal to the pavement
 edge and installed prior to placing a stress relief layer or any other overlaying work. Cut trenches 2 inches deeper than the adjacent
 pavement and running the full-depth from the in place pavement edge to at least 4 inches beyond the edge of the unbonded
 concrete overlay. (This length will thus extend at least 4 inches into the zone of the subsurface drain and will provide a connection
 once the drain is installed.)
 Clean all soil or debris from the exposed pavement crack or joint prior to backfilling the trench. The Engineer will approve
 the method and extent of joint/crack cleaning. Vibrate and compact to the requirements of 2105.3.F.2, “Quality Compaction”.
 Backfill any void space at the top of the trench.
 I
 Hold Point
 Any failure to meet a requirement creates a Hold Point, whereby no additional material may be placed until Corrective
 action and passing retest(s) have occurred, or accepted by the Engineer. All additional material placed before corrective action and
 passing retest(s) occur constitutes Unauthorized Work per 1512.2.
 2502.4 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT

 (1)
 (2)
 
 In circular type structures, lay the bricks flat and radially with the ends exposed on the inside of the structure.
 Where the thickness of the wall is greater than the length of one brick, the Contractor may lay the outside
 bricks circumferentially using full header construction in at least each sixth course.
 In rectangular type manholes, lay the bricks in regular courses of stretchers using full header construction in at
 least each sixth course. Do not use bats or spalls except for shaping around openings or for finishing out a
 course. When shaping around openings or finishing out a course, place full bricks in the corners and the bats
 in the interior of the course. Ensure the least dimension of the exposed faces of bats is at least 50 percent of
 the width of a brick.
 
 When using the alternate method of constructing the tapered portion of a manhole with concrete block as shown on the
 plans, use concrete units specifically shaped to transition between the vertical and the sloped walls.
 D
 Sectional Concrete
 Set the bottom pre-cast section in a full mortar bed and fill the joints between sections and around pipes with mortar or a
 plastic cementing compound approved by the Engineer.
 Install cover for a 4020 structure on a full mortar bed according to Standard Plate 4020.
 E
 Pipe

 2506.4 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 The Engineer will measure manholes and catch basins as drainage structures.
 A
 Constructing Drainage Structures
 If the plans specify measurement by length for vertical structures constructed on a concrete base, the Engineer will
 measure the height as the difference in elevation between the bottom of the casting and the invert elevation of the outlet pipe, plus
 an allowance of 0.70 ft for the depth of the concrete base, regardless of its actual thickness.
 If the plans specify measurement by length for pipe structures designed with a “tee” section in the sewer or culvert line,
 the Engineer will measure the length as the difference in elevation between the bottom of the casting and the flow line elevation of
 the sewer or culvert pipe for vertical construction, or as shown in the plans for other special designs not constructed vertically. The
 Engineer will measure the “run” of the pipe structure “tee” section as culvert or sewer pipe.
 If the plans specify the measurement of each structure complete in place, the Engineer will separately measure drainage
 structures of each design as individual units complete in place, including any castings provided and installed.
 B
 Reconstruction
 The Engineer will measure reconstruction to the nearest 0.1 ft, of the height from the bottom of the reconstructed portion
 to the bottom of the newly set casting, regardless of type.
 C
 Castings
 The Engineer will measure casting assembly by the number of casting assemblies provided and installed.
 The Engineer will measure install casting by the number of castings installed.
 The Engineer will not measure castings for structures measured as a unit. The Engineer will consider all castings required
 for an individual structure as one assembly.
 D
 Adjusting Castings
 The Engineer will measure adjusting castings by the number of casting assemblies adjusted. The Engineer will consider
 all castings required for an individual structure as one assembly.

 B
 
 Installing Liner
 
 B.1
 General
 Inspect the interior of the inplace pipe to identify conditions which may prevent proper installation and to confirm that the
 liner and installation method proposed by the contractor are adequate for existing site conditions.
 Use jet rodding equipment, hydro-mechanical methods or other methods approved by the Engineer to clean and dry the
 inplace pipe before inserting the liner. Remove or repair all obstructions that would prevent installation or damage the liner during
 installation. Remove debris or other materials from the inplace pipe to prevent the inserted liner from resting on or against, or be
 irregularly supported by, these materials.
 The Contractor may use a flange connector or a full encirclement with neoprene connects and stainless steel clamps to
 make final connection. Allow the liner to stabilize from 8 h to 10 h before tying the last joint or pressure grouting the annular space
 between the inplace culvert and the inserted liner.
 Use fasteners, blocks, or multiple grout layers to secure liners equal to or greater than 2 ft in diameter to the invert of the
 inplace pipe to prevent the liner from floating during the grouting operations.
 B.2
 Inserting Liner
 The Contractor may pull or push pre-fused lengths of solid wall PE liner into place. The Contractor may combine the push
 and pull techniques to insert the liners.
 B.2.a
 Pull Technique
 Use a cable or winch arrangement to pull the liner into place. Feed the cable from the winch through the inplace pipe.
 Fasten the cable to the liner to allow the liner to be pulled through the inplace pipe and into place. The Contractor may fabricate
 the pulling head out of a few extra feet of the liner by cutting out evenly spaced wedges from the leading edge, collapsing the
 fingers towards the center, and fastening the cable to the fingers.
 B.2.b
 Push Technique
 Place a choker strap around the liner outside the access point. Use a tractor mounted backhoe, backhoe, or an
 equivalent piece of equipment approved by the Engineer to pull the choker, thus pushing the liner through the inplace pipe. Ensure
 that with each stroke of the backhoe, the choker grips the liner and pushes the leading edge of the liner further into the inplace
 culvert. The Contractor may use a front-end loader or bulldozers to simultaneously push on the trailing end of the liner segment.
 B.3
 Pipe Joints
 Use heat fusion or grooved press-on joints approved by the Engineer to join PE liner meeting requirements of ASTM F714
 (DR 32.5). Heat fuse liner joints as recommended by the liner manufacturer, using an experienced operator of the heat fusion
 equipment.
 Use a threaded joint to join liner segments of closed-profile PE liner with an ASTM D3350 cell classification of 345464C as
 approved by the Engineer.
 C
 Grout
 Block off culvert ends before filling the annular space between the liner and the inplace pipe. Provide CLSM Low Density
 or CLSM High Density grout in accordance with 2519, “Cellular Concrete Grout – Controlled Low Strength Material (CLSM),” and as
 shown on the plans or as required by the contract. Use CLSM High Density grout if the plans or the contract do not specify the
 grout type. Do not allow grouting pressure to exceed the external hydrostatic collapse resistance of the liner.
 D

 2511.3
 
 B.2
 Geotextile Filter
 When placing geotextile filter material ensure that the foundation surface is relatively smooth and free of stones, sticks,
 and other debris or irregularities that might puncture the fabric. Place the filter material and conduct construction operations
 without tearing, puncturing, or shifting the fabric.
 Place the fabric with the longest dimension parallel to the direction of water flow. If using fabric that is not seamed,
 overlap splices and joints at least 18 inches, except overlap splices and joints placed under water 36 inches. Provide shingled joint
 laps in the flow direction and from top to bottom of a slope to direct water flow over the joint without undermining the geotextile
 filter. The Contractor may sew multiple fabric pieces together, as specified in 3733, “Geotextiles,” in lieu of joint overlapping. Bury
 the upgrade edges of the fabric a minimum of 6 inches to direct water flow over the fabric and prevent undermining. If not
 seamed, place washered steel pins, edge stakes, stones, or other material at locations and in quantities as approved by the
 Engineer, to prevent movement of the geotextile filter during placement of the riprap.
 Do not dump stone at the top of the slope and roll stone down the slope. If placing stones directly on the geotextile filter
 without a granular cushion, do not operate equipment on top of the stones after placement. Do not operate construction
 equipment directly on top of the geotextile.
 Do not use geotextile filter material under hand placed or grouted riprap, unless otherwise required by the contract.
 The Contractor may place geotextile filter on slopes no steeper than 1:3. For slopes steeper than 1:3, retrench the
 geotextile at least every 15 ft or as required by the contract. Do not use geotextile filter on slopes steeper than 1:2.
 C
 Riprap Stone
 Do not drop stones on the fabric from a height greater than 1 ft unless the fabric is covered with a 6 inch thick granular
 cushion course. If covered, the Contractor may drop riprap stones from a height no greater than 3 ft.
 When placing riprap, start at the lowest elevations and work upwards.
 Before placement of riprap stone on geotextile, the Engineer may require the Contractor to demonstrate that the
 placement methods will not damage the fabric. The Engineer may order the removal of at least 4 sq. yd of riprap to inspect for
 fabric damage in accordance with 1511, “Inspection of Work.”
 C.1
 Random Riprap
 Position random riprap to provide a uniform distribution of the various sizes of stone and produce a dense, well-keyed
 layer of stones with the least practical voids volume. Level the surface flush with the surrounding ground to produce a reasonably
 uniform appearance and the thickness required by the contract.
 Wash riprap clean before placing underwater.
 C.2
 Hand-Placed Riprap
 Embed the stones for hand-placed riprap in the foundation material, with the axis of the stone that most nearly
 approximates the contract-required thickness of riprap laid perpendicular to the foundation slope. Lay stones with the least
 practicable space between them. Position the stones to stagger the joints up the slope. Place each stone to allow the foundation
 material and adjacent stones to carry its mass.
 Use selected stones set to line and grade to define the ends and edges of each riprap area.

 with 1405, “Use of Materials Found on the Project,” 2101, “Clearing and Grubbing,” and 2104.3.C, “Removal Operations.” Provide a
 smooth ground profile at the fence line.
 Ensure the bottom of the fence follows the contour of the ground. At small stream crossings, drainage ditches, and other
 locations where the bottom of the standard size fence cannot conform to the ground contour, construct the fence to span the
 depression and use extra wire or fabric to close the space below the bottom of the fence, unless otherwise shown on the plans or
 directed by the Engineer. Provide and install longer posts with intermediate posts, stakes, braces, extra fabric, or wires to span the
 depression.
 Perform field repairs to fence materials as recommended by the manufacturer.
 B
 
 Installing Posts, Rails and Braces
 
 B.1
 General
 Set posts plumb, except set posts perpendicular to the slope of the ground at locations as directed by the Engineer.
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 461
 
 2557.3
 Install corner posts, pull posts, end posts, and gate posts at locations shown on the plans or as directed by the Engineer.
 Provide corner post assemblies at horizontal angle points with deflections greater than 20 degrees. Space pull posts to provide a
 braced post at points where the following occurs:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 The vertical alignment deflects by greater than 20 degrees,
 The post anchorage is necessary to counteract wire uplift, and
 An abrupt grade change on short runs that cannot be avoided by shaping the ground to a uniform contour.
 
 When driving fence posts, protect the post tops from damage. Remove and replace posts damaged during installation.
 Anchor posts placed on concrete walls, curbs, or other concrete structures as shown on the plans.
 If placing fence posts in solid rock, set the post at least 12 in [300 mm] into the rock or with the post bottom at the
 elevation shown on the plans, whichever requires the lesser excavation into the rock. Cut the post bottom to provide the height
 above the ground surface as shown on the plans. Cut holes in rock to provide a clearance of at least 1 in [25 mm] around the
 posts. Fill the holes around the posts with grout consisting of one part portland cement, two parts mortar sand, and sufficient
 water to create the proper consistency. The Contractor may add 0.1 part hydrated lime in the grout.
 Place and consolidate concrete around the posts and braces. Allow the concrete to cure for at least 3 calendar days
 before installing the fence wire.
 The Contractor may pour the concrete into prebored holes without forming, if no concrete contamination occurs during
 placement.
 Except as otherwise required for posts and braces set in rock or concrete, backfill the annular space around posts set in
 prebored holes in layers using selected material from the excavation with each layer thoroughly compacted to produce a rigid post
 setting. Use other backfill material, if required by the contract.
 Dispose of surplus excavated material in low areas along the fence line or as directed by the Engineer. Neatly finish the
 adjacent area.
 B.2
 Metal Post Installations
 Set posts for chain-link fabric fencing in concrete as shown on the plans. The Contractor may drive line posts if the post
 lengths provide a post embedment of at least 4 ft [1.2 m] into the ground.
 Drive rolled steel line posts.
 The Contractor may provide rolled steel end posts, corner posts, and pull posts, including the required braces, with
 anchor plates and brace plates. Set the posts in dug holes. The Contractor may omit the anchor and brace plates and set the posts
 and braces in concrete. Backfill excavations around the posts and braces using the excavated material. Thoroughly compact the
 backfill.
 Set rolled steel gate posts in concrete.
 Provide and install metal post extensions in the lengths directed by the Engineer at the locations shown on the plans. If
 post splicing is necessary, use a standard thread and coupling of the same material to thread and join the pipe ends at the splice.
 Avoid splicing in the exposed upper portion of the post. Provide a suitable plug in the bottom end of each extended post.
 B.3
 Wood Post Installations
 The Contractor may drive posts or set wood posts in prebored holes. Place the larger end of the post in the ground.
 When driving posts, place the square cut or pointed end in the ground. Except for holes in rock, cut post holes to a diameter
 providing a clearance of at least 3 in [75 mm] around the post to allow backfill and compaction.
 Provide wood braces in accordance with 3413, “Wood Fence Posts (Treated).” Provide wood braces with diameters at the
 small end equal to the minimum permissible diameter as shown on the plans. Ensure the diameter at the small end does not
 exceed the top diameter of the smaller adjacent post.
 C
 Installing Fence Wire
 Install and pull tight the fence wire as recommended by the manufacturer.
 C.1
 Chain Link Fabric
 Place chain link fabric in continuous runs between corner, end, and gate posts. Install the fabric on the side of line posts
 that face away from the main road except as otherwise directed by the Engineer. Ensure impacts from snow plowing stress the
 posts rather than the fasteners.
 At ends of chain link fabric, thread a stretcher bar through the fabric loops and use clamps to fasten the bar to the posts
 as shown on the plans.
 
 462
 
 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 2557.4
 
 Weave pre-bent wire of the same kind as the fabric to make splices in the chain link fabric.
 C.2
 Barbed Wire and Woven Wire
 Unless otherwise directed by the Engineer, place barbed wire and woven wire installed on tangent alignment or on curves
 no greater than 1 degree on the side of line posts that faces away from the main road. If placing the fence on horizontal curves
 greater than 1 degree, place the wire on the side of line posts on the outside of the curve. Offset posts at corners to the inside so
 that the wire will bear against the post.
 Fasten fence wire to end, corner, gate, or pull posts before fastening to intermediate line posts. Stretch woven wire to
 make longitudinal wires taut and to remove 30 percent of the factory fabricated fence crimp.
 When required by the plans, cut and splice woven wire at the pull posts to obtain and maintain uniform tension in
 horizontal wires. The Contractor may use a wire crimping tool to increase the number or depth of tension curves to maintain
 tension in horizontal wires.
 Use wire clips or clamps in accordance with 3376, “Fence Wire,” to fasten wires to metal line posts. Use galvanized
 staples to fasten wires to wood posts. Where the wire loops around end, corner, or pull posts, wrap the wire around the post at
 least four complete turns.
 Use U-shaped wire staples at least 1¾ in [45 mm] long in pine posts and at least 2 in [50 mm] long in cedar posts. The
 Contractor may use L-shaped staples with serrated, barbed or ring shanks at least 1½ in [38 mm] long.
 Diagonally drive U-shaped staples across the wood grain to prevent both points from entering between the same grain.
 Slope staples upward, against the pull of the wire, in depressions with wire up-lift. Slope staples downward on level ground and
 over knolls. Staple the wires at corner, end, and pull posts. On line posts, drive the staples to the point that allows movement of
 the wire. Do not damage the wire while driving the staples.
 To splice wire between posts, use an approved splicing sleeve as indicated in 3376, “Fence Wire,” or wrap each wire end
 around the other wire from 4 turns to 6 turns to form a lasting connection. Use a splicing tool in place of hand wrapping to obtain
 uniformly tight wraps as directed by the Engineer.
 If using splicing sleeves on woven wire, maintain the same horizontal distance between vertical wires as in the fabricated
 wire. If using the wrap method to splice woven wire, allow the two end stay wires to abut each other and enclose the wires within
 the wrap.
 D
 Installing Gates
 Install gates designed to allow locking with a Department-provided padlock and equipped with a padlock keeper at the
 locations shown on the plans.
 E
 Electrical Grounds
 Install electrical grounds consisting of copper coated steel rods with a nominal diameter of at least ⅝ in [15 mm] and a
 length of at least 8 ft [2.4 m] along each fence line at the staked locations.
 Drive ground rods to an elevation flush with the ground surface at points directly below or adjacent to the fence wire.
 Connect each ground rod to the fence with a solid No. 6 copper wire. Use approved type metal clamps as indicated in 3376, “Fence
 Wire,” to attach the ground wire to the ground rod and to the fence wires to electrically ground each longitudinal fence wire. The
 Department will not require greater than one connection on woven wire and chain link fabric near the bottom at each ground rod.
 Install electrical grounds in the following locations:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 (5)
 
 On each fence line at the point of crossing beneath an electric power line.
 Two grounds at each pedestrian gate, one on each side of the gate opening, as close to the gate posts as
 practicable.
 Additional grounds on each fence line to maintain spacing between grounds of 1,500 ft [450 m] on fences with
 metal posts and 1,000 ft [300 m] on fences with wood posts.
 At least one electrical ground on each separate section of fence. The Department defines a separate section of
 fence as a run with unbroken electrical continuity.
 On each separate section of fence, uniformly space electrical grounds and locate a ground within a distance
 from each end no greater than half of the desired maximum spacing interval.
 
 2557.4 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
 A
 Wire Fence
 The Engineer will separately measure fence of each design by length along the bottom of the fence, from center to center

 D.2
 Weed Control and Soil Cultivation
 Apply herbicide to actively growing vegetation beginning in spring or fall. Before cultivating individual planting holes and
 bed areas, kill turf and weed growth within the limits of planting areas that will receive mulch in accordance with the following:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 (4)
 
 (5)
 
 (6)
 
 (7)
 
 (8)
 
 (9)
 
 Mow existing vegetation to at least 3 in [75 mm] at least one week before spraying herbicide. Remove the
 cuttings. Allow the vegetation to re-grow to a height from 4 in to 8 in [100 mm to 200 mm] before applying
 the herbicide.
 At least three days before applying herbicide, submit to the Engineer, labels of the intended herbicides and a
 copy of a valid MN Pesticide Applicator License, including Category A and Category J.
 Spray and kill turf and weeds, including the top growth and roots, only within designated areas using a nonselective, non-residual post emergent herbicide containing 41 percent glyphosate as the active ingredient.
 Ensure personnel, licensed by the MDA and experienced in the use of chemical pesticides perform the work in
 accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and recommendations. Apply the herbicide to dry foliage on
 actively growing vegetation. Apply the herbicide in August or early September before the fall or spring Plant
 Installation Period (PIP) as required by the contract. If an August or September application is not possible for
 the spring PIP, apply the herbicide in late April or early May. If precipitation occurs within 6 hours after
 applying herbicide, reapply herbicide as needed to achieve 100 percent kill.
 Before beginning soil cultivation work, schedule and perform a Competency Test to the satisfaction of the
 Engineer. The Engineer considers a satisfactory Competency Test one that demonstrates acceptable soil
 cultivation, incorporation of soil additives, compaction levels, and soil drainage in one planting bed area and
 one individual tree planting area.
 Before placing soil additives as shown on the plans, use a spading machine to deep cultivate the planting hole
 and bed areas by loosening the soil to at least 12 in [300 mm] deep and a compaction level of no more than
 200 psi [1,400 kPa] to this depth, as measured from the finished grade elevation of the soil. The Engineer may
 approve other equipment to address site constraints, if requested by the Contractor. For hydraulic spade-type,
 machine-moved tree-transplanting, the Engineer will not require planting hole cultivation, other than loosening
 the soil outside the soil-ball perimeter in accordance with the standard plans shown on the plans.
 Unless otherwise shown on the plans, add 4 in [100 mm] of Grade 2 compost, in accordance with 3890,
 “Compost” and other soil additives shown on the plans or as requested by the Contractor and approved by the
 Engineer, over the cultivated planting hole and bed areas and use a spading machine to incorporate it to a
 depth of at least 12 in [300 mm], as measured from the finished grade elevation of the soil.
 Use a compaction tester to ensure compaction in the planting hole and bed areas does not exceed 200 psi
 [1,400 kPa] to a depth of at least 16 in [400 mm]. If Contractor-operations result in zones of hardpan or
 excessively compacted soil, repeat deep cultivation or de-compact the subsoil in accordance with 2105.3.H,
 “Finishing Operations,” specifically the requirements for turf establishment areas, at no additional cost to the
 Department.
 Ensure drainage in the planting hole and bed areas. For suspected drainage problems, perform a percolation
 test by filling a 16 in [400 mm] deep planting hole with water and measuring the time it takes the water to
 drain from the hole. The Engineer considers adequate drainage equal to or greater than a percolation rate of
 ½ in/h [12 mm/h]. If drainage does not meet these requirements, request approval from the Engineer to
 relocate or delete affected planting locations or proceed with Extra Work using one or a combination of the
 standard plans for poorly drained soils, as shown on the plans.
 Apply temporary erosion control measures in accordance with the NPDES permit, SWPPP notes, and 2573,
 “Storm Water Management.” The Contractor may use Type 6 wood chip mulch at a depth no more than 1 in
 [25 mm] for temporary erosion control in prepared planting bed areas.
 
 D.3
 Wet Soils, Rock, and Debris
 If the Contractor encounters excessively wet soils, bedrock, or excessive quantities of boulders and construction debris,
 the Contractor may request the Engineer’s approval to relocate or delete plantings, or modify soil or drainage characteristics in
 accordance with the alternative options in the standard plans shown on the plans.
 E
 Delivery and Storage of Plants
 Before installation, the Engineer will provide for inspection and acceptance of plant stock delivered to the project in
 accordance with the current edition of the ICAMMLP and 3861, “Plant Stock.”
 Install plant stock on the day of delivery to the project unless using temporary storage methods. Before installation, keep
 the roots of plants completely covered with a moisture-holding material consisting of wood chips, straw, sawdust, moss, or soil.
 Keep the moisture-holding material continuously moist and protect it from drying winds, direct sunlight, excessive heat, freezing,
 low humidity, inadequate ventilation, and animal or human harm. Remove tree trunk sleeves prior to inspection, acceptance and
 planting. Sleeves must be removed with a method that does not injure the tree. The Engineer will consider plants with damage
 that occurred or was discovered during temporary storage, unacceptable. Do not store plants from one planting season to the next.

 E.1
 Pruning — Top Growth and Roots
 Immediately before planting, prune the roots of bare-root plants, except seedlings, and the top growth of deciduous
 plants. Cut-back broken or badly bruised roots and dry root tips to sound, healthy tissue. Prune to remove dead, rubbing,
 damaged, diseased, and suckering branches, and to improve plant symmetry, structure, and vigor. Prune coniferous trees and
 shrubs only to remove damaged growth or a competing leader.
 Prune in accordance with the horticultural practices specified in the current edition of the ICAMMLP and the standard
 plans on the plans.
 Do not prune oak trees during the oak wilt season from April through July, to prevent the spread of oak wilt disease.
 Immediately treat accidental cuts or wounds to oaks with a wound dressing in accordance with the standard plans shown on the
 plans. Keep wound-dressing material on the project during the oak wilt season.
 E.2
 Buried Root Flares
 The Engineer will consider container-grown and balled and burlapped plant stock unacceptable if provided with more than
 4 in [100 mm] of soil depth above the root flare. The Engineer may accept plants provided with no more than 4 in [100 mm]
 excess soil above the root flare if the excess soil can be removed without damaging the root system of the plants.

 Installation of Plants
 
 F1
 General
 Before proceeding with plant installation work, schedule and perform a competency test demonstrating acceptable plant
 installation methods to the Engineer’s satisfaction and in accordance with the plans and standard plans, for each plant pay item and
 root category on the project. The Engineer considers a satisfactory competency test to be one that demonstrates acceptable
 handling of plants, digging of holes and beds, installation of plants, initial watering, installation of protection materials and
 mulching.
 Before digging planting holes, rake temporary erosion control wood chip mulch off prepared planting areas to prevent
 wood chip contamination of the planting soil in the holes.
 The Contractor may re-spread wood chip mulch formerly used as temporary erosion control around plants to a depth no
 greater than 1 in [25 mm] following plant installation, if newly provided and acceptable Type 6 mulch is applied over the top to the
 depth shown on the standard plans in the plans.
 Dig planting holes to the configuration and minimum dimensions shown in the standard plans on the plans. If the soil
 moisture is greater than field capacity, do not work in planting holes and beds.
 Ensure drainage in the planting hole and bed areas. For a suspected drainage problem, perform a percolation test by
 filling a 16 in [400 mm] deep planting hole with water and measuring the time it takes the water to drain from the hole. The
 Engineer considers adequate drainage equal to or greater than a percolation rate of ½ in/h [12 mm/h]. If drainage does not meet
 these requirements, request approval from the Engineer to relocate or delete affected planting locations or proceed with extra work
 using one or a combination of the standard plans for poorly drained soils as shown on the plans.

 maintain soil moisture in the root zones.
 Within 2 hours of installation, saturate the backfill soil of each plant with water. After settling, provide additional backfill
 to fill in the voids.
 H
 Mulch
 Before placing mulch, fine grade and level the planting bed soils with hand tools. Place mulch material in accordance
 with the standard planting detail shown on the plans no more than seven days after plant installation. The Engineer will consider
 placement of mulch, contaminated with soil or other materials and not complying with the requirements of 3882, “Mulch Materials,”
 unacceptable. Remove unacceptable mulch from the project.

 A
 General
 The installation locations and layouts shown on the plans are approximate. The Engineer will determine the exact
 locations and layouts of bioengineered systems.
 Provide a qualified nurseryman, landscape specialist, or experienced crews working under the direct supervision of a
 qualified nurseryman or landscape specialist to harvest and install plant material.
 Do not begin planting operations or deliver planting stock to the project until the Engineer determines that weather and
 soil conditions are suitable for planting and preparations for planting are complete.
 During placement, install components until complete. Prevent overnight drying out of plant stock by storing in water. On
 slopes, begin installing material at the bottom of slope and proceed in horizontal layers upward. On shorelines and banks, begin
 installing material below the water line and proceed up the bank.
 During the work, prevent siltation and turbidity of flowing or impounded waters of the State. If working in water, protect
 the work site with curtains, barriers, or other containment devices to prevent sediment and debris from entering the receiving water
 body.
 B
 Harvesting Plant Stock
 Obtain plant stock and cuttings from the regions, zones, or both shown on the plans.
 At least three days before harvesting planting stock for the project, notify the Engineer of the harvest date to allow for
 inspection.
 C
 Season of Placement
 Refer to Table 2577-1 for the dates for seasonal placement. The Engineer may adjust a date specified in Table 2577-1 by
 no more than 20 calendar days, based on the prevailing weather conditions.
 Provide plant material in a dormant stage; before buds burst open in the spring or after leaves change color and drop in

 Wattling
 Dig trenches along the contours of the slope, place bundles of dormant plant cuttings into the trenches, and tamp loose
 soil over the bundles. Before trenching, drive wooden stakes 16 in. on center along each trench location. Provide stakes with a
 diameter of 2 in. and a length of 2 ft. Drive the stakes to a firm hold with the tops 6 in [150 mm] above grade.
 Dig trenches no more than 1 h before installing plant materials to minimize drying of soils. Leave the overall soil surface
 in a rough condition with clods, and ridges for maximum resistance to erosion. Immediately following trenching, place bundles of
 dormant plant cuttings into the trench. Lay cuttings in bundles together with the butt ends located at alternate ends of the bundle
 and tightly tied with binder twine at least three points along the bundle. Provide bundles consisting of dormant woody cuttings
 from ⅜ in to 2 in. in diameter and from 3 ft. to 8 ft. long. Provide bundles from 6 in. to 8 in. in diameter. Overlap wattle ends in
 the trench. Drive additional stakes through bundles at a spacing no greater than 2 ft. on center. During placement of the bundles,
 cover the bundles with loose soil, working it into the wattles leaving a uniform fringe of plant material, exposed to a height from
 2 in. to 3 in.
 E
 Brush Layering
 Make trenches along the contour of the slope and embed dormant green plant cuttings into the slots and tamp loose soil
 over the cuttings. Make trenches 2 ft. deep, angled downward into the slope. Provide plant cuttings consisting of stems 3 ft. long,
 and from ½ in to 2 in. in diameter. Transport cuttings in containers of water and keep cuttings in the containers until installation.
 As soon as possible after making the trenches, place the plant cuttings into the trenches with the butt end placed into the trench
 and at least 6 in [150 mm] of the cuttings protruding out of the trench. Place the stems randomly with some crisscrossing. While
 placing plant cuttings, immediately backfill the trench cuttings with soil and firm the backfill to meet the Engineer’s approval.
 F
 Live Stakes
 Insert dormant live cuttings into the soil and tamp soil lightly around the cutting. Provide cuttings consisting of stems at
 least 3 ft. long and from 1 in. to 2 in. in diameter. Transport cut material in containers of water and keep material in water until
 installation. Insert the bottom end of the cuttings so the bottom-end is at right angles to the slope face for at least two-thirds to
 three-quarters of the cutting length and tamp. Do not split the ends or damage the bark of the cuttings. Place cuttings 2 ft. on
 center, using a triangular spacing. Place cuttings at a density of two to four stakes per square yard [square meter].
 If rip rap is less than 2 ft. thick, stake the riprap (joint planting). Make a pilot hole by driving a tool, such as a pry bar or
 rebar, through the rip rap and filter layer, to reach the ground soil. Use a dead blow hammer to tamp the cuttings and avoid
 damaging the bark. Place the cuttings in a random configuration 2 ft. on center.
 G
 Placing Coir log
 Place Sediment Control log type coir for stabilizing shorelines. Before installing the coir log, drive wooden stakes with a
 diameter of 2 in. and a length of 3 ft., 1 ft. on center along the planned alignment of the coir log. Ensure the stakes extend from
 8 in. to 10 in. above the elevation of the water surface shown on the plans. After placing the stakes, install the coir log so the
 upper surface of the coir log is parallel to the water surface and 2 in. protrude above the normal water level. Lace coir logs
 together end to end with woven nylon twine, ⅛ in. in diameter to create a continuous length. Bury both ends of the coir rolls 5 ft.
 laterally into the bank.
 H
 Root-Rap
 Place a soil filled riprap liner, and overseed or plant vegetation in accordance with the details, typical sections, and
 elevation controls as shown on the plans. The Engineer will stake the actual alignment. During the work, continuously place the
 granular channel lining or riprap and shape the channel. Begin seeding or planting within 48 hours of shaping the channel or as
 required by contract.

 For PREF TAPE or PREF THERMO, the recessing shall be performed by a self-propelled machine equipped with
 gang stacked diamond cutting blades mounted on a floating head with controls capable of providing uniform depth and
 alignment. The cutting heads shall consist of stacked 1/8 inch to 3/8 inch wide diamond tipped cutting blades. The
 spacers between each blade must be such that the raise in the bottom of the finished recess between the blades is less
 than 25% of the recessed depth. The resulting bottom of the recess shall have a fine corduroy finish. If a coarse tooth
 pattern is present, increase the number of blades and/or decrease the thickness of the spacers on the cutting head.
 For all other materials, the recessing shall be performed by either:
 a self-propelled machine equipped with gang stacked diamond cutting blades mounted on a floating
 head with controls capable of providing uniform depth and alignment. The cutting heads shall consist of
 stacked 1/8 inch to 3/8 inch wide diamond tipped cutting blades. The spacers between each blade must be
 such that the raise in the bottom of the finished recess between the blades is less than 25% of the recessed
 depth. The resulting bottom of the recess shall have a fine corduroy finish. If a coarse tooth pattern is present,
 increase the number of blades and/or decrease the thickness of the spacers on the cutting head.
 Or
 a self-propelled machine equipped with carbide cutting blades with controls capable of providing
 uniform depth and alignment.
 The equipment shall be capable of recessing the total width of the recess in one pass or be capable of
 recessing uniform depths with multiple passes. The maximum number of passes is detailed below. If multiple passes are
 used, the ridge between passes shall be mechanically removed prior to recess cleaning and pavement marking
 application.
 The equipment shall be capable of recessing double lines simultaneously or parallel lines to a uniform depth
 with two passes.
 The equipment shall be self-vacuuming and leave the cut recess ready for pavement marking installation. Dry
 cut recessing without a vacuum will only be allowed if markings run perpendicular to the roadway, such as Stop Bars. Use
 the equipment and method approved by the pavement marking manufacturer.
 Recessing Details
 The recessing shall be performed within the following tolerances. Failure to meet these tolerances will result in
 the suspension of work until the Contractor can demonstrate that these tolerances can be met to the satisfaction of the
 Engineer. The pavement marking system shall be applied so that it is centered within the recess.

 Maximum loss after 5 cycles on the coarse aggregate fraction (material retained on No. 4 sieve for any individual source
 within the mix) as follows:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 
 Percent passing the ¾ in sieve to percent retained on the ½ in sieve, ≤ 14%,
 Percent passing the ½ in sieve to percent retained on the ⅜ in sieve, ≤18%,
 Percent passing the ⅜ in sieve to percent retained on the No. 4 sieve, ≤ 23%,
 For the composite if all three size fractions are tested, the composite loss ≤ 18%, and acceptance will be
 granted if:
 (4.1)
 If the Contractor meets the composite requirement, but fails to meet at least one of the individual
 components, the Engineer may accept the source if each individual component is no greater than
 110 percent of the requirement for that component.
 (4.2)
 If the Contractor meets each individual component requirement, but fails to meet the composite, the
 Engineer may accept the source if the composite is no greater than 110 percent of the requirement

 Use for District 6 ONLY.
 If crushed carbonate quarry rock (limestone or dolostone) is used, the minus #200 sized portion of the rock insoluble
 residue shall not exceed 10% by weight.
 Blending of sources and/or beds with an insoluble residue up to 15% is allowed to meet the 10% insoluble residue
 requirement. Individual beds thinner than 6 inches [150 mm] or up to 5% of the total face height, are exempt from the 15%
 maximum insoluble residue requirement. However, the aggregate producer shall practice good quality control at all times and
 exclude poor quality stone to the extent practical, regardless of the bed thickness and/or pocket size and location.
 No carbonate quarry rock from the Platteville Geological Formation is allowed.

 any methods using an external heat source.
 D.3
 Steam Curing
 For box culvert and reinforced concrete pipe production, delay the introduction of steam into the curing enclosure for
 curing purposes, until the concrete has taken its initial set and at least 3 h after placing the concrete. During the delay period,
 maintain a temperature within the curing chamber of at least 50° F [10° C]. During the delay period, the temperature inside the
 curing chamber may be increased from the concrete temperature at the time of placement up to 10° F per hour, to no higher than
 90° F. Only use steam to maintain the curing enclosure temperature within these limits.
 For bridge girder production, delay the introduction of steam into the curing enclosure, for curing purposes, until the
 concrete has taken its initial set and at least 3 h after placing the concrete. During the delay period, maintain a temperature within
 the curing chamber of at least 50° F and no greater than 10° F higher than the temperature of the concrete at the time of
 placement. Use steam only to maintain the curing enclosure temperature within the limits.
 For all products, do not allow steam jets to impinge directly on the concrete or on the forms. Do not allow the rate of rise
 in temperature adjacent to the concrete to rise at rates greater than 30° F per hour (40° F for concrete pipe and other products not
 specifically mentioned here). Provide free circulation around the top, sides, and ends of the concrete units. Do not allow the
 temperatures adjacent to the concrete greater than 160° F. Use saturated steam within the curing enclosure. Maintain a
 temperature in the concrete unit of at least 50° F during the curing period. For bridge items, do not allow a difference in
 temperature adjacent to the concrete within the enclosure to be greater than 10° F.
 After the expiration of the steam curing period, reduce the temperature inside the chamber at a rate no greater than 40°
 F per hour until the temperature inside and outside of the chamber equalize. After removing items from the chamber, protect the
 items to avoid cooling at a rate greater than 40° F per hour until reaching the air temperature at the storage site.
 If removing forms before the completion of the steam curing cycle (including temperature taper off process), only remove
 and leave uncovered the minimum area of the curing enclosure at any one time needed to remove each individual form section.
 Close the open area in the enclosure immediately upon removing each form section or within 15 min of first uncovering the area.

 When removing the precast items from the casting bed during the cooling-off process, take appropriate measures to keep
 the items warm during the moving operations, and immediately resume the cooling-off process at the storage area.
 When control cylinders are cured in a chamber separate from the pieces represented, maintain the cylinder chamber at
 the same temperature as, or no more than 5° F higher than, the curing chamber for the precast items represented at all times
 during the curing period. Provide a continuous recording thermometer for each curing enclosure that has an individual temperature
 control (at least 50% of the curing chambers for box culvert production and at least one per 100 ft for bridge girders). Variances
 from these requirements may be allowed with approval of the Materials Engineer. Locate thermometers in each curing enclosure as
 approved by the Materials Engineer. Submit complete temperature recording charts for all recording devices to the Materials
 Engineer upon request.

 B
 Special Requirements
 Provide drainage castings of metal with a Brinell hardness number from 190 to 265.
 Provide round casting assemblies with lid-to-frame surfaces machine-milled to provide true bearing around the entire
 circumference.
 C
 Foundry Control
 Before beginning casting, the manufacturer and the Engineer will establish, in conference, a control procedure for
 correlating casting operations, arranging for foundry inspection, and establishing an approved identification system. Unless the
 Engineer otherwise agrees, the manufacturer will identify castings as follows:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 
 With a mark correlating the casting with test bars using a system of heat numbers or a calendar date and tap
 number, using numerals no greater than ½ inch;
 With a mark indicating the source of manufacture, using a symbol no greater than 1½ inches in the largest
 dimension or a letter no greater than ¾ inch high and 2 inches long;
 With the Department’s type or style number shown on the plans, in the size and location indicated.
 
 Form these identification marks on castings of sufficient size during manufacture. If the casting size is insufficient for the
 marks, use stamped metal tags wired to the castings for markings not formed in the castings. Place identification marks, subject to
 approval by the Engineer, where they will not interfere with assembly of parts and will not be removed during machine finishing
 operations. Ensure the manufacturer does not place its name on castings except as specified above.
 D
 Casting Details
 Provide castings meeting the dimensions shown on the plans. Provide draft by increasing the net dimensions. Provide
 castings within a tolerance of ⅛ inch for the overall general dimensions. Limit the tolerance in dimensions of grates and covers for
 drainage casting assemblies, and the openings into which they fit, to 1/16 inch. In no case is the metal thickness to be less than
 1
 /16 inch less than the thickness shown on the plans.
 Provide castings with a density of at least 95 percent of the theoretical density of that type, based on 442 lb/cu. ft, cast
 to the exact dimensions shown on the plans.
 Pour castings in closed molds with gating, feeders, risers, and sprues. Ensure castings completely fill the molds. Do not
 remove castings from the molds until properly cooled. Do not chill the castings.

 Minnesota 2018 Standard Specifications
 
 3322.2
 Boldly fillet castings on the inside and re-entrant corners. Round the outside corners and edges to a radius of at least
 ⅛ inch. For bridge bearings, use a ½ inch fillet except where the fillet may interfere with assembly.
 E
 Workmanship and Finish
 Remove attachments of gates, risers, and sprues from the castings and grind remaining extensions flush to the casting
 surface. The Engineer will reject castings damaged through careless removal of attachments. Do not repair by welding.
 Fabricate castings free of sponginess, cracks, blow holes, warping, sand inclusions, cold shuts, chilled iron shrinks, and
 other defects that affect the strength and value of the casting for the purpose intended. Ensure the contact surfaces between
 different castings in an assembly provide a firm, even bearing, without rattling or rocking.
 Clean castings of foundry sand, rust, scale, and other deleterious material.
 3321.3 SAMPLING AND TESTING
 Ensure the manufacturer casts the required number of test bars, as stated below, and machine finishes tension test
 specimens to the dimensions required in the Schedule for Materials Control. Unless otherwise approved by the Engineer, the
 manufacturer will deliver test specimens to the Materials Laboratory for testing.
 Cast three test bars for each heat or tap. If adding alloys in the ladle, cast three test bars for each ladle. For continuous
 furnace pouring, cast two test bars at the beginning and two test bars at the end of cast.
 For bridge bearing castings, cast at least one test bar for each casting. Pour castings and test bars in the presence of the
 Engineer, unless the test bars are cast as an integral part of the bearing castings.
 Identify each test bar separately and to the corresponding castings using symbols, letters, or numbers cast on the test
 bar and casting.
 If properly identifying castings and corresponding test bars is not possible, the Engineer may require test specimens to be
 cut from selected castings that are representative of a lot, and perform tests on those samples.

 wood materials having sufficient sapwood thickness to permit the specified penetration and retention. Ensure suitable conditioning
 and, for some species, incising prior to the treatment, and the use of treating conditions that do not damage the wood in
 accordance with AWPA Standards T1, U1, and the applicable AWPA Use Category Standards shown in Table 3491-1.
 
 B.1.b
 Incising
 Incise the wood to allow penetration of the preservative. Incise lumber and timbers of species difficult to penetrate,
 including Douglas Fir, Western Larch, Spruce, Hemlock, Redwood, and Jack Pine before treatment such that the incising will not
 make the material unfit for use. Incise pines if predominantly heartwood. The Engineer may waive the incising requirement if the
 Contractor can meet penetration and retention requirements without incising.
 B.1.c
 Seasoning
 For sawn material treated with an oil-type preservative and used in buildings or other construction where high moisture
 content or shrinkage would be objectionable, dry to a moisture content no greater than 19 percent before treatment.
 Measure the moisture content at a depth equivalent to the required preservative penetration.
 Unless the contract requires otherwise, dry lumber no greater than 4 inches in nominal thickness and plywood treated
 with a waterborne preservative to a moisture content no greater than 19 percent before and after treatment.
 C
 Method of Treatment
 Unless the contract requires otherwise, use the preservative materials listed in Table 3491-1 and the MnDOT
 Approved/Qualified Products List. Use the same preservative on the entire product provided for each contract item, unless the
 contract requires otherwise.
 Use the full-cell process to treat timber products if using with waterborne preservatives.
