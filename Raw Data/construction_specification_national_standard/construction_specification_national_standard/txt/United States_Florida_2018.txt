 DIVISION I
 General Requirements and Covenants
 SECTION 1
 DEFINITIONS AND TERMS
 1-1 General.
 These Specifications are written to the bidder, prior to award of the Contract, and to the
 Contractor. Within Divisions I and II of the specifications, sentences that direct the Contractor to
 perform work are written in the active voice-imperative mood. These directions to the Contractor
 are written as commands. In the imperative mood, the subject “the bidder” or “the Contractor” is
 understood.
 All other requirements to be performed by others, with the exception of the Method of
 Measurement and the Basis of Payment Articles, have been written in the active voice, but not in
 the imperative mood. Sentences written in the active voice identify the party responsible for
 performing the action. For example, “The Engineer will determine the density of the compacted
 material.” Certain requirements of the Contractor may also be written in the active voice, rather
 than active voice-imperative mood.
 Division III of the Specifications (Materials) is written in the passive voice writing style.

 Unless otherwise indicated in the Advertisement, the Bidder has the option to
 submit a bid either as an Internet Bid Submittal in accordance with 2-2.3 or as a Hard Copy Bid
 Submittal in accordance with 2-2.4. When an Internet bid submittal is used, the hard copy will
 not be considered.
 2-2.2 Department Modifications to Contract Documents: Notification of
 modifications to any Contract Documents will be posted on the Department’s website at the
 following URL address: http://www.fdot.gov/contracts/Lettings/Letting_Project_Info.shtm
 and will also be transmitted to the Bidder. The email address provided by the Bidder at the time

 the instructions provided in the notification of modifications to access the amendment files.
 The Bidder shall take responsibility for downloading the revised information per
 the instructions included in the notification of modifications.
 2-2.3 Internet Bid Submittals: Unless otherwise indicated in the Advertisement, the

 2-3 Interpretation of Estimated Quantities.
 2-3.1 Lump Sum Contracts: The Bidder is responsible for the determination of the
 quantities for those items constructed within the authorized plan limits or dimensions.
 The Department does not assume any responsibility for any incidental information
 in bid documents that may be construed as a quantity of work and/or materials.
 2-3.2 Contracts other than Lump Sum: For those items constructed within authorized
 plan limits or dimensions, use the quantities shown in the Plans and in the Proposal Form as the
 basis of the bid. The Department will also use these quantities for final payment as limited by the
 provisions for the individual items. For those items having variable final pay quantities that are
 dependent on actual field conditions, use and measurement, the quantities shown in the Plans and
 in the Proposal Form are approximate and provide only a basis for calculating the bid upon
 which the Department will award the Contract. Where items are listed for payment as lump sum
 units and the Plans show estimates of component quantities, the Department is responsible for
 the accuracy of those quantities limited to the provisions of 9-3.3. Where items are listed for
 payment as lump sum units and the Plans do not show estimates of component quantities, the
 Bidder is solely responsible for their own estimates of such quantities.
 The Department may increase, decrease, or omit the estimated quantities of work
 to be done or materials to be furnished.
 2-4 Examination of Plans, Specifications, Special Provisions, and Site of Work.
 Examine the Contract Documents and the site of the proposed work carefully before
 submitting a Proposal for the work contemplated. Investigate the conditions to be encountered,
 as to the character, quality, and quantities of work to be performed and materials to be furnished
 and as to the requirements of all Contract Documents.
 The Department does not guarantee the details pertaining to borings, as shown in the
 Plans, to be more than a general indication of the materials likely to be found adjacent to holes
 bored at the site of the work, approximately at the locations indicated. The Bidder shall examine
 boring data, where available, and make their own interpretation of the subsoil investigations and
 other preliminary data, and shall base their bid solely on their own opinion of the conditions
 likely to be encountered.
 The Bidder’s submission of a Proposal is prima facie evidence that the Bidder has made
 an examination as described in this Article.
 2-5 Preparation of Proposals.
 2-5.1 General: Submit Proposals on the Proposal Form described in 2-2. Any pay item
 that will be provided free or at no cost to the Department shall be indicated as “free” or “$.00”. If
 the pay item is left blank or n/a is used, the bid may be declared irregular. Show the total of the
 bid on the face of the Proposal.
 2-5.2 Internet Bid Submittals: The Bidder shall execute the Proposal under the Bidder’s
 Digital ID and enter the firm’s bidding office street address on the Bidders Information Tab in
 the Department’s bid software. This Digital ID represents the firm as an individual, partnership,
 corporation, limited liability company, or joint venture. By entering and submitting the Digital
 ID the authorized parties obligate the firm to the bid. Internet Bid Submittals must acknowledge,
 on behalf of, the person, firm, association, or corporation submitting the bid certifying that such
 person, firm, association, or corporation has not, either directly or indirectly, entered into any
 agreement, participated in any collusion, or otherwise taken any action in restraint of free

 competitive bidding in connection with the submitted bid, by indicating such in the Proposal.
 The Department will not consider any bid unless such acknowledgement is included.
 2-5.3 Hard Copy Bid Submittals: If the Proposal is made by an individual, either in the
 Bidder’s own proper person or under a trade or firm name, the Bidder shall execute the Proposal
 under the Bidder’s signature and enter the firm’s bidding office street address. If the Proposal is
 made by a partnership, execute the Proposal by setting out in full the names of the partners, the
 firm name of the partnership, if any, have two or more of the general partners or authorized
 person sign the Proposal and enter the firm’s bidding office street address. If the Proposal is
 made by a corporation, execute the Proposal by setting out in full the corporate name and have
 the president or other legally authorized corporate officer or agent sign the Proposal, affix the
 corporate seal and enter the corporation’s bidding office street address. If the Proposal is made
 by a limited liability company, execute the Proposal by setting out the company name, have the
 manager or authorized member sign the Proposal and enter the company’s bidding office
 address. If the Proposal is made by a joint venture, execute the Proposal by setting out the joint
 venture name, have the authorized parties sign the Proposal and enter the bidding office’s street
 address. File with the Department Form 375-020-08, contained in the Proposal, which includes
 an unsworn statement executed by, or on behalf of, the person, firm, association, or corporation
 submitting the bid certifying that such person, firm, association, or corporation has not, either
 directly or indirectly, entered into any agreement, participated in any collusion, or otherwise
 taken any action in restraint of free competitive bidding in connection with the submitted bid.
 The Department will not consider any bid unless such form is properly completed in accordance
 with the requirements shown thereon.
 2-6 Rejection of Irregular Proposals.
 A Proposal is irregular and the Department may reject such Proposal if the Proposal
 shows omissions, alterations of form, additions not specified or required, conditional or
 unauthorized alternate bids, or irregularities of any kind; or if the unit prices are obviously
 unbalanced, or if the cost is in excess of or below the reasonable cost analysis values, or if the
 Bidder submits a Proposal which was not generated using the Department’s bid software.
 When the Department provides for alternate bids in the Proposal Form, make only one
 entry for each alternate. A Proposal that provides for alternative bids is irregular and the
 Department may reject such Proposal if the Bidder makes entries for more than one alternate.
 2-7 Guaranty to Accompany Proposals.
 The Department will not consider any Proposal unless accompanied by a Proposal
 Guaranty of the character and amount indicated in the Advertisement, and unless made payable
 to the Florida Department of Transportation. Submit the Proposal with the understanding that the

 SECTION 3
 AWARD AND EXECUTION OF CONTRACT
 3-1 Consideration of Bids.
 For the purpose of award, after opening and reading the Proposals, the Department will
 consider as the bid the correct summation of each unit bid price multiplied by the estimated
 quantities shown in the Proposal. On this basis, the Department will compare the amounts of
 each bid and make the results of such comparison available to the public. Until the actual award
 of the Contract, however, the Department reserves the right to reject any or all Proposals and to
 waive technical errors that the Department determines, in its sole discretion, to be in the best
 interest of the State.
 The Department reserves the right to delete the bid portion of the utility relocation work
 from the Contract. When the Department deletes utility relocation work from the Contract, the
 Department will recalculate the Contract bid tabulations based on the remaining project
 quantities.
 In the event that the Department deletes utility relocation work from the Contract, the
 utility owner will relocate such utilities in accordance with the backup Utility Relocation
 Schedule contained in the Contract Documents.
 3-2 Award of Contract.
 3-2.1 General: If the Department decides to award the Contract, the Department will
 award the Contract to the lowest responsible Bidder whose Proposal complies with all the
 Contract Document requirements. If awarded, the Department will award the Contract within
 50 days after the opening of the Proposals, unless the Special Provisions change this time limit or
 the Bidder and the Department extend the time period by mutual consent.
 Prior to award of the Contract by the Department, the Bidder must provide proof
 of authorization to conduct business in the State of Florida.
 3-2.2 Bids Exceeding Bidder’s Maximum Capacity Rating: Prior to award of the
 Contract, the Department will address bids exceeding a Bidder’s maximum capacity rating, and
 the resulting impact on the Bidder’s qualification to bid, in accordance with Florida
 Administrative Code Rules 14-22.003 and 14-22.009.

 The Department reserves the right to cancel the award of any Contract at any time before
 the execution of the Contract by all parties, with no compensation due any of the Bidders.
 3-4 Release of Proposal Guaranty.
 The Department will release all Proposal Guaranties except those of the two lowest
 responsible Bidders immediately following the opening and checking of the Proposals. The

 Bidders after the successful Bidder delivers the executed Contract and a satisfactory Contract
 Bond to the Department, except that the Department will not retain the Proposal Guaranty of the
 next-to-lowest responsible Bidder longer than 50 days after the opening of the Proposals unless
 the Department awards the Contract to the next lowest responsible Bidder prior to the expiration
 of this time limit.

 3-5 Contract Bond Required.
 3-5.1 General Requirements of the Contract Bond: Upon award, furnish to the
 Department, and maintain in effect throughout the life of the Contract, an acceptable Contract
 Bond in a sum at least equal to the amount of the Contract. Execute such Contract Bond on
 Department Form 375-020-27. Obtain the Contract Bond from a Surety licensed to conduct
 business in the State of Florida, meeting all of the requirements of the laws of Florida and the
 regulations of the Department, and having the Department’s approval. Ensure that the Surety’s
 Florida Licensed Insurance Agent’s name, address, and telephone number is clearly stated on the
 Contract Bond form.
 The Department may waive the requirement for all or a portion of a Contract
 Bond if:
 1. The Contract amount is $250,000 or less, and the Department
 determines that the project is of a noncritical nature and that nonperformance will not endanger
 the public health, safety, or property;
 2. The Contractor is a qualified nonprofit agency for the blind or for the
 other severely handicapped under Section 413.036(2), Florida Statutes; or,
 3. The Contractor uses a subcontractor that is a qualified nonprofit agency
 for the blind or for the other severely handicapped under Section 413.036(2), Florida Statutes.
 However, the Department may not waive more than the amount of the subcontract.
 The Department may require alternate means of security if it waives the
 requirement for a Contract Bond.
 3-5.2 Continued Acceptability of Surety: Provide a Contract Bond that remains
 acceptable to the Department throughout the life of the Contract. In the event that the Surety
 executing the Contract Bond, although acceptable to the Department at the time of execution of
 the Contract, subsequently becomes insolvent or bankrupt, or becomes unreliable or otherwise
 unsatisfactory due to any cause that becomes apparent after the Department’s initial approval of
 the Surety, then the Department may require that the Contractor immediately replace the
 Contract Bond with a similar Contract Bond issued by a Surety that is reliable and acceptable to
 the Department. In such an event, the Department will bear all costs of the premium for the new
 Contract Bond, after deducting any amounts that are returned to the Contractor from their
 payment of premium on the original Contract Bond.
 3-5.3 Default by Contractor: In case of default on the part of the Contractor, the
 Department will charge against the Contract Bond all expenses for services incidental to
 ascertaining and collecting losses under the Contract Bond, including accounting, engineering,
 and legal services, together with any and all costs incurred in connection with renegotiation of
 the Contract.
 3-5.4 Surety to Furnish Legal Defense as to Payment and Performance Claims or
 Suits: The Surety shall indemnify and provide defense for the Department when called upon to
 do so for all claims or suits against the Department, by third parties, pertaining to Contractor
 payment or performance issues arising out of the Contract where the Contractor has failed to
 timely provide the Department such defense. It is expressly understood that the monetary
 limitation on the extent of the indemnification shall be the approved Contract amount, which
 shall be the original Contract amount as may be modified by subsequent Supplemental
 Agreements.
 3-5.5 Liability for Wrongful or Criminal Act by Contractor: The principal and Surety
 executing the Contract Bond shall be liable to the State in any civil action that might be instituted

 17
 
 by the Department or any officer of the State authorized in such cases, for double any amount in
 money or property the State might lose, or be overcharged, or otherwise be defrauded of by any
 wrongful or criminal act of the Contractor, their agent or their employees.
 3-6 Execution of Contract and Contract Bond.
 Within 10 calendar days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and State holidays, after receipt
 of the Contract award, execute the necessary agreements to enter into a Contract with the
 Department and return the Contract along with a satisfactory Contract Bond and documentation
 evidencing all insurance required by 7-13 to the Department’s Contracts Office that awarded the
 Contract. For each calendar day, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and State holidays, the
 Contractor is late in delivering to the Department’s Contracts Office all required documents in
 properly executed form, the Department will deduct one day from the Contract Time. The
 Department will not be bound by any Proposal until the Department executes the associated
 Contract.
 The Department will execute the Contract within 5 calendar days, excluding Saturdays,
 Sundays, and State holidays, after receipt of the signed Contract, necessary agreements, Contract
 Bond, and all other required documents from the Contractor.
 3-7 Failure by Contractor to Execute Contract and Furnish Bond.
 In the event that the Contractor fails to execute the awarded Contract and to submit an
 acceptable Contract Bond, as prescribed in 3-5 and 3-6, within 10 calendar days, excluding
 Saturdays, Sundays, and State holidays, of receipt of the Contract award, the Department may
 annul the award, causing the Contractor to forfeit the Proposal Guaranty to the Department as
 liquidation of damages sustained. The Department may then award the Contract to the next
 lowest responsible Bidder, re-advertise, or accomplish the Work using alternate resources.
 3-8 Audit of Contractor’s Records.
 Upon execution of the Contract, the Department reserves the right to conduct an audit of
 the Contractor’s records pertaining to the project. The Department or its representatives may
 conduct an audit, or audits, at any time prior to final payment, or thereafter pursuant to 5-13. The
 Department may also require submittal of the records from either the Contractor or any
 subcontractor or material supplier. As the Department deems necessary, records include all
 books of account, supporting documents, and papers pertaining to the cost of performance of the
 Work.
 Retain all records pertaining to the Contract for a period of not less than three years from
 the date of the Engineer’s final acceptance of the project, unless a longer minimum period is
 otherwise specified. Upon request, make all such records available to the Department or its
 representative(s). For the purpose of this Article, records include but are not limited to all books
 of account, supporting documents, and papers that the Department deems necessary to ensure
 compliance with the provisions of the Contract Documents.
 If the Contractor fails to comply with these requirements, the Department may disqualify
 or suspend the Contractor from bidding on or working as a subcontractor on future Contracts.
 Ensure that the subcontractors provide access to their records pertaining to the project
 upon request by the Department.

 SECTION 4
 SCOPE OF THE WORK
 4-1 Intent of Contract.
 The intent of the Contract is to provide for the construction and completion in every
 detail of the work described in the Contract. Furnish all labor, materials, equipment, tools,
 transportation, and supplies required to complete the work in accordance with the Contract
 Documents.
 Upon execution of the Contract, conduct all written communication associated with the
 Contract using a paperless electronic means. When the Specifications require a submission of
 documentation, such documents must be submitted and exchanged electronically using the
 Department provided web-based collaboration site.
 All documents requiring a signature must be executed electronically by both parties in
 accordance with Chapter 668, Florida Statutes, and have the same force and effect as a written
 signature. All persons requiring access to the collaboration site shall be identified during the
 preconstruction conference. Persons may be added or removed during the life of the Contract on
 an as needed basis. All signatories must acquire a digital signature certificate.
 4-2 Work not covered by Standard Specifications.
 Proposed construction and any contractual requirements not covered by these Standard
 Specifications may be covered by Contract Plan notes or by Supplemental Specifications or
 Special Provisions for the Contract, and all requirements of such Supplemental Specifications or
 Special Provisions shall be considered as a part of these Specifications.
 4-3 Alteration of Plans or of Character of Work.
 4-3.1 General: The Engineer reserves the right to make, at any time prior to or during the
 progress of the work, such increases or decreases in quantities, whether a significant change or
 not, and such alterations in the details of construction, whether a substantial change or not,
 including but not limited to alterations in the grade or alignment of the road or structure or both,
 as may be found necessary or desirable by the Engineer. Such increases, decreases or alterations
 shall not constitute a breach of Contract, shall not invalidate the Contract, nor release the Surety
 from any liability arising out of this Contract or the Surety bond. The Contractor agrees to
 perform the work, as altered, the same as if it had been a part of the original Contract.
 The term “significant change” applies only when:
 1. The Engineer determines that the character of the work as altered differs
 materially in kind or nature from that involved or included in the original proposed construction,
 or
 2. A major item of work, as defined in 1-3, is increased in excess of 125%
 or decreased below 75% of the original Contract quantity. The Department will apply any price
 adjustment for an increase in quantity only to that portion in excess of 125% of the original
 Contract item quantity in accordance with 4-3.2 below. In the case of a decrease below 75% the
 Department will only apply a price adjustment for the additional costs that are a direct result of
 the reduction in quantity.
 In (1) above, the determination by the Engineer shall be conclusive. If the
 determination is challenged by the Contractor in any proceeding, the Contractor must establish
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 20
 
 by clear and convincing proof that the determination by the Engineer was without any reasonable
 basis.
 4-3.2 Increase, Decrease or Alteration in the Work: The Engineer reserves the right to
 make alterations in the character of the work which involve a substantial change in the nature of
 the design or in the type of construction or which materially increases or decreases the cost or
 time of performance. Such alteration shall not constitute a breach of Contract, shall not invalidate
 the Contract or release the Surety.
 Notwithstanding that the Contractor shall have no formal right whatsoever to any
 extra compensation or time extension deemed due by the Contractor for any cause unless and
 until the Contractor follows the procedures set forth in 5-12.2 for preservation, presentation and
 resolution of the claim, the Contractor may at any time, after having otherwise timely submitted a
 notice of intent to claim or preliminary time extension request pursuant to 5-12.2 and 8-7.3.2,
 submit to the Department a request for equitable adjustment of compensation or time or other
 dispute resolution proposal. The Contractor shall in any request for equitable adjustment of
 compensation, time, or other dispute resolution proposal certify under oath and in writing, in
 accordance with the formalities required by Florida law, that the request is made in good faith,
 that any supportive data submitted is accurate and complete to the Contractor’s best knowledge
 and belief, and that the amount of the request accurately reflects what the Contractor in good
 faith believes to be the Department’s responsibility. Such certification must be made by an
 officer or director of the Contractor with the authority to bind the Contractor. Any such certified
 statements of entitlement and costs shall be subject to the audit provisions set forth in 5-12.14.
 While the submittal or review of a duly certified request for equitable adjustment shall neither
 create, modify, nor activate any legal rights or obligations as to the Contractor or the Department,
 the Department will review the content of any duly certified request for equitable adjustment or
 other dispute resolution proposal, with any further action or inaction by the Department thereafter
 being in its sole discretion. Any request for equitable adjustment that fails to fully comply with
 the certification requirements will not be reviewed by the Department.
 The monetary compensation provided for below constitutes full and complete
 payment for such additional work and the Contractor shall have no right to any additional
 monetary compensation for any direct or indirect costs or profit for any such additional work
 beyond that expressly provided below. The Contractor shall be entitled to a time extension only
 to the extent that the performance of any portion of the additional work is a controlling work item
 and the performance of such controlling work item actually extends completion of the project
 due to no fault of the Contractor. All time related costs for actual performance of such additional
 work are included in the compensation already provided below and any time extension
 entitlement hereunder will be without additional monetary compensation. The Contractor shall
 have no right to any monetary compensation or damages whatsoever for any direct or indirect
 delay to a controlling work item arising out of or in any way related to the circumstances leading
 up to or resulting from additional work (but not relating to the actual performance of the
 additional work, which is paid for as otherwise provided herein), except only as provided for
 under 5-12.6.2.1.
 4-3.2.1 Allowable Costs for Extra Work: The Engineer may direct in writing
 that extra work be done and, at the Engineer’s sole discretion, the Contractor will be paid
 pursuant to an agreed Supplemental Agreement or in the following manner:
 
 Return to Table of Contents

 1. Labor and Burden: The Contractor will receive payment for actual costs
 of direct labor and burden for the additional or unforeseen work. Labor includes foremen actually
 engaged in the work; and will not include project supervisory personnel nor necessary on-site
 clerical staff, except when the additional or unforeseen work is a controlling work item and the
 performance of such controlling work item actually extends completion of the project due to no
 fault of the Contractor. Compensation for project supervisory personnel, but in no case higher
 than a Project Manager’s position, shall only be for the pro-rata time such supervisory personnel
 spent on the contract. In no case shall an officer or director of the Company, nor those persons
 who own more than 1% of the Company, be considered as project supervisory personnel, direct
 labor or foremen hereunder.
 Payment for burden shall be limited solely to the following:

 At the Pre-construction conference, certify to the Engineer the
 
 a. A listing of on-site clerical staff, supervisory personnel
 and their pro-rated time assigned to the contract,
 b. Actual Rate for items listed in Table 4-3.2.1,
 c. Existence of employee benefit plan for Holiday, Sick and
 Vacation benefits and a Retirement Plan, and,
 d. Payment of Per Diem is a company practice for instances
 when compensation for Per Diem is requested.
 Such certification must be made by an officer or director of the
 Contractor with authority to bind the Contractor. Timely certification is a condition precedent to
 any right of the Contractor to recover compensations for such costs, and failure to timely submit
 the certification will constitute a full, complete, absolute and irrevocable waiver by the
 Contractor of any right to recover such costs. Any subsequent changes shall be certified to the
 Engineer as part of the cost proposal or seven calendar days in advance of performing such extra
 work.

 2. Materials and Supplies: For materials accepted by the Engineer and
 used on the project, the Contractor will receive the actual cost of such materials incorporated into
 the work, including Contractor paid transportation charges (exclusive of equipment as hereinafter
 set forth). For supplies reasonably needed for performing the work, the Contractor will receive
 the actual cost of such supplies.
 3. Equipment: For any machinery or special equipment (other than small
 tools), including fuel and lubricant, the Contractor will receive 100% of the “Rental Rate Blue
 Book” for the actual time that such equipment is in operation on the work, and 50% of the
 “Rental Rate Blue Book” for the time the equipment is directed to standby and remain on the
 project site, to be calculated as indicated below. The equipment rates will be based on the latest
 edition (as of the date the work to be performed begins) of the “Rental Rate Blue Book for
 Construction Equipment” or the “Rental Rate Blue Book for Older Construction Equipment,”
 whichever is applicable, as published by Machinery Information Division of PRIMEDIA
 Information, Inc. (version current at the time of bid), using all instructions and adjustments
 contained therein and as modified below. On all projects, the Engineer will adjust the rates using
 regional adjustments and Rate Adjustment Tables according to the instructions in the Blue Book.
 Allowable Equipment Rates will be established as set out below:
 a. Allowable Hourly Equipment Rate = Monthly Rate/176
 x Adjustment Factors x 100%.
 b. Allowable Hourly Operating Cost = Hourly Operating
 Cost x 100%.
 c. Allowable Rate Per Hour = Allowable Hourly Equipment
 Rate + Allowable Hourly Operating Cost.
 d. Standby Rate = Allowable Hourly Equipment
 Rate x 50%.
 The Monthly Rate is The Basic Machine Rate Plus Any
 Attachments. Standby rates will apply when equipment is not in operation and is directed by the
 Engineer to standby at the project site when needed again to complete work and the cost of
 moving the equipment will exceed the accumulated standby cost. Standby rates will not apply on
 any day the equipment operates for eight or more hours. Standby payment will be limited to only
 that number of hours which, when added to the operating time for that day equals eight hours.
 Standby payment will not be made on days that are not normally considered work days on the
 project.
 The Department will allow for the cost of transporting the
 equipment to and from the location at which it will be used. If the equipment requires assembly
 or disassembly for transport, the Department will pay for the time to perform this work at the rate
 for standby equipment.
 Equipment may include vehicles utilized only by Labor, as defined
 above.
 4. Indirect Costs, Expenses, and Profit: Compensation for all indirect
 costs, expenses, and profit of the Contractor, including but not limited to overhead of any kind,
 whether jobsite, field office, division office, regional office, home office, or otherwise, is
 expressly limited to the greater of either (a) or (b) below:
 a. Solely a mark-up of 17.5% on the payments in (1) through (3),
 above.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 23
 
 1. Bond: The Contractor will receive compensation for any
 premium for acquiring a bond for such additional or unforeseen work at the original Contract
 bond rate paid by the Contractor. No compensation for bond premium will be allowed for
 additional or unforeseen work paid by the Department via initial contingency pay item.
 2. The Contractor will be allowed a markup of 10% on the
 first $50,000 and a markup of 5% on any amount over $50,000 on any subcontract directly
 related to the additional or unforeseen work. Any such subcontractor mark-up will be allowed
 only by the prime Contractor and a first tier subcontractor, and the Contractor must elect the
 markup for any eligible first tier subcontractor to do so.
 b. Solely the formula set forth below and only as applied solely as
 to such number of calendar days of entitlement that are in excess of ten cumulative calendar days
 as defined below.
 D=
 
 A×C

 Where A = Original Contract Amount
 B = Original Contract Time
 C = 8%
 D = Average Overhead Per Day
 Cumulative Calendar Days is defined as the combined total
 number of calendar days granted as time extensions due to either extra work, excluding overruns
 to existing contract items, that extend the duration of the project or delay of a controlling work
 item caused solely by the Department, or the combined total number of calendar days for which a
 claim of entitlement to a time extension due to delay of a controlling work item caused solely by
 the Department is otherwise ultimately determined to be in favor of the Contractor.
 No compensation, whatsoever, will be paid to the
 Contractor for any jobsite overhead and other indirect impacts when the total number of calendar
 days granted for time extension due to delay of a controlling work item caused solely by the
 Department is, or the total number of calendar days for which entitlement to a time extension due
 to delay of a controlling work item caused solely by the Department is otherwise ultimately
 determined in favor of the Contractor to be, equal to or less than ten calendar days and the
 Contractor also fully assumes all monetary risk of any and all partial or single calendar day delay
 periods, due to delay of a controlling work item caused solely by the Department, that when
 combined together are equal to or less than ten calendar days and regardless of whether monetary
 compensation is otherwise provided for hereunder for one or more calendar days of time
 extension entitlement for each calendar day exceeding ten calendar days. All calculations under
 this provision shall exclude weather days, Holidays, and Special Events.
 Further, for (a) or (b) above, in the event there are concurrent
 delays to one or more controlling work items, one or more being caused by the Department and
 one or more being caused by the Contractor, the Contractor shall be entitled to a time extension
 for each day that a controlling work item is delayed by the Department but shall have no right to
 nor receive any monetary compensation for any indirect costs for any days of concurrent delay.

 4-3.2.2 Subcontracted Work: Compensation for the additional or unforeseen
 work performed by a subcontractor shall be limited solely to that provided for in 4-3.2.1 (1), (2),
 (3) and (4)(a). In addition, the Contractor compensation is expressly limited to the greater of the
 total provided in either 4-3.2.1(4)(a) or (4)(b), except that the Average Overhead Per-Day
 calculation is as follows:
 Ds =
 
 Subcontract amounts(s)*

 The subcontractor may receive compensation for any premium for
 acquiring a bond for the additional or unforeseen work; provided, however, that such payment for
 additional subcontractor bond will only be paid upon presentment to the Department of clear and
 convincing proof that the subcontractor has actually submitted and paid for separate bond
 premiums for such additional or unforeseen work in such amount and that the subcontractor was
 required by the Contractor to acquire a bond.
 The Contractor shall require the subcontractor to submit a certification, in
 accordance with 4-3.2.1 (1), as part of the cost proposal and submit such to the Engineer. Such
 certification must be made by an officer or director of the subcontractor with authority to bind the
 subcontractor. Timely certification is a condition precedent to any right of the Contractor to
 recover compensation for such subcontractor costs, and failure to timely submit the certification
 will constitute a full, complete, absolute and irrevocable waiver by the Contractor of any right to
 recover such subcontractor costs.
 4-3.3 No Waiver of Contract: Changes made by the Engineer will not be considered to
 waive any of the provisions of the Contract, nor may the Contractor make any claim for loss of
 anticipated profits because of the changes, or by reason of any variation between the approximate
 quantities and the quantities of work actually performed. All work shall be performed as directed
 by the Engineer and in accordance with the Contract Documents.
 4-3.4 Conditions Requiring a Supplemental Agreement or Unilateral Payment: A
 Supplemental Agreement or Unilateral Payment will be used to clarify the Plans and
 Specifications of the Contract; to provide for unforeseen work, grade changes, or alterations in
 the Plans which could not reasonably have been contemplated or foreseen in the original Plans
 and Specifications; to change the limits of construction to meet field conditions; to provide a safe
 and functional connection to an existing pavement; to settle documented Contract claims; to
 make the project functionally operational in accordance with the intent of the original Contract
 and subsequent amendments thereto.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 25
 
 A Supplemental Agreement or Unilateral Payment may be used to expand the
 physical limits of the project only to the extent necessary to make the project functionally
 operational in accordance with the intent of the original Contract. The cost of any such agreement
 extending the physical limits of the project shall not exceed $100,000 or 10% of the original
 Contract price, whichever is greater.
 Perform no work to be covered by a Supplemental Agreement or Unilateral
 Payment before written authorization is received from the Engineer. The Engineer’s written
 authorization will set forth sufficient work information to allow the work to begin. The work
 activities, terms and conditions will be reduced to written Supplemental Agreement or Unilateral
 Payment form promptly thereafter. No payment will be made on a Supplemental Agreement or
 Unilateral Payment prior to the Department’s approval of the document.
 4-3.5 Extra Work: Extra work authorized in writing by the Engineer will be paid in
 accordance with the formula in 4-3.2. Such payment will be the full extent of all monetary
 compensation entitlement due to the Contractor for such extra work. Any entitlement to a time
 extension due to extra work will be limited solely to that provided for in 4-3.2 for additional
 work.
 4-3.6 Connections to Existing Pavement, Drives and Walks: Generally adhere to the
 limits of construction at the beginning and end of the project as detailed in the Plans. However, if
 the Engineer determines that it is necessary to extend the construction in order to make suitable
 connections to existing pavement, the Engineer will authorize such a change in writing.
 For necessary connections to existing walks and drives that are not indicated in
 the Plans, the Engineer will submit direction regarding the proper connections in accordance with
 the Standard Plans.
 4-3.7 Differing Site Conditions: During the progress of the work, if subsurface or latent
 physical conditions are encountered at the site differing materially from those indicated in the
 Contract, or if unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature differing materially from those
 ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the work provided for in the
 Contract are encountered at the site, the party discovering such conditions shall promptly notify
 the other party in writing of the specific differing conditions before the Contractor disturbs the
 conditions or performs the affected work.
 Upon receipt of written notification of differing site conditions from the
 Contractor, the Engineer will investigate the conditions, and if it is determined that the
 conditions materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time required for the
 performance of any work under the Contract, an adjustment will be made, excluding loss of
 anticipated profits, and the Contract will be modified in writing accordingly. The Engineer will
 notify the Contractor whether or not an adjustment of the Contract is warranted.
 The Engineer will not allow a Contract adjustment for a differing site condition
 unless the Contractor has submitted the required written notice.
 The Engineer will not allow a Contract adjustment under this clause for any
 effects caused to any other Department or non-Department projects on which the Contractor may
 be working.
 4-3.8 Changes Affecting Utilities: The Contractor shall be responsible for identifying
 and assessing any potential impacts to a utility that may be caused by the changes proposed by
 the Contractor, and the Contractor shall at the time of making the request for a change notify the
 Department in writing of any such potential impacts to utilities.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 26
 
 Department approval of a Contractor proposed change does not relieve the
 Contractor of sole responsibility for all utility impacts, costs, delays or damages, whether direct
 or indirect, resulting from Contractor initiated changes in the design or construction activities
 from those in the original Contract Specifications, Design Plans (including Traffic Control Plans)
 or other Contract Documents and which effect a change in utility work different from that shown
 in the Utility Plans, joint project agreements or utility relocation schedules.
 4-3.9 Cost Savings Initiative Proposal:
 4-3.9.1 Intent and Objective:
 1. This Subarticle applies to any cost reduction proposal (hereinafter
 referred to as a Proposal) that the Contractor initiates and develops for the purpose of refining the
 Contract to increase cost effectiveness or significantly improve the quality of the end result. A
 mandatory Cost Savings Initiative Workshop will be held prior to Contract Time beginning for
 the Contractor and Department to discuss potential Proposals. This Subarticle does not, however,
 apply to any such proposal unless the Contractor identifies it at the time of its submission to the
 Department as a proposal submitted pursuant to this Subarticle.
 2. The Department will consider Proposals that would result in net savings
 to the Department by providing a decrease in the cost of the Contract. Proposals must result in
 savings without impairing essential functions and characteristics such as safety, service, life,
 reliability, economy of operation, ease of maintenance, aesthetics and necessary standard design
 features. However, nothing herein prohibits the Contractor from submitting Proposals when the
 required functions and characteristics can be combined, reduced or eliminated because they are
 nonessential or excessive. The Department will not recognize the Contractor’s correction of plan
 errors that result in a cost reduction, as a Proposal.
 3. The Department reserves the right to reject at its discretion any Proposal
 submitted that proposes a change in the design of the pavement system or that would require
 additional right-of-way. Pending the Department’s execution of a formal supplemental agreement
 implementing an approved Proposal, the Contractor shall remain obligated to perform the work
 in accordance with the terms of the existing Contract. The Department may grant time extensions
 to allow for the time required to develop and review a Proposal.
 4. For potential Proposals not discussed at the Cost Savings Initiative
 Workshop, a mandatory concept meeting will be held for the Contractor and Department to
 discuss the potential Proposal prior to development of the Proposal.
 4-3.9.2 Subcontractors: The Department encourages the Contractor to include
 the provisions of this Subarticle in Contracts with subcontractors and to encourage submission of
 Proposals from subcontractors. However, it is not mandatory to submit Proposals to the
 Department or to accept or transmit subcontractor proposed Proposals to the Department.
 4-3.9.3 Data Requirements: As a minimum, submit the following information
 with each Proposal:
 1. a description of the difference between the existing Contract
 requirement, including any time extension request, and the proposed change, and the comparative
 advantages and disadvantages.
 2. separate detailed cost estimates for both the existing Contract
 requirement and the proposed change. Break down the cost estimates by pay item numbers
 indicating quantity increases or decreases and deleted pay items. Identify additional proposed
 work not covered by pay items within the Contract, by using pay item numbers in the Basis of
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 27
 
 Estimates Manual. In preparing the estimates, include overhead, profit, and bond within pay
 items in the Contract. Separate pay item(s) for the cost of overhead, profit, and bond will not be
 allowed.
 3. an itemization of the changes, deletions or additions to Plan details, plan
 sheets, Standard Plans and Specifications that are required to implement the Proposal if the
 Department adopts it. Submit preliminary plan drawings sufficient to describe the proposed
 changes.
 4. engineering or other analysis in sufficient detail to identify and describe
 specific features of the Contract that must be changed if the Department accepts the Proposal
 with a proposal as to how these changes can be accomplished and an assessment of their effect
 on other project elements. The Department may require that engineering analyses be performed
 by a prequalified consultant in the applicable class of work. Support all design changes that result
 from the Proposal with drawings and computations signed and sealed by the Contractor’s
 Engineer of Record. Written documentation or drawings will be submitted clearly delineating the
 responsibility of the Contractor’s Engineer of Record.
 5. the date by which the Department must approve the Proposal to obtain
 the total estimated cost reduction during the remainder of the Contract, noting any effect on the
 Contract completion time or delivery schedule.
 6. a revised project schedule that would be followed upon approval of the
 Proposal. This schedule would include submittal dates and review time for the Department and
 Peer reviews.
 4-3.9.4 Processing Procedures: Submit Proposals to the Engineer or his duly
 authorized representative. The Department will process Proposals expeditiously; however, the
 Department is not liable for any delay in acting upon a Proposal submitted pursuant to this
 Subarticle. The Contractor may withdraw, in whole or in part, a Proposal not accepted by the
 Department within the period specified in the Proposal. The Department is not liable for any
 Proposal development cost in the case where the Department rejects or the Contractor withdraws
 a Proposal.
 The Engineer is the sole judge of the acceptability of a Proposal and of the
 estimated net savings in construction costs from the adoption of all or any part of such proposal.
 In determining the estimated net savings, the Department reserves the right to disregard the
 Contract bid prices if, in the judgment of the Engineer, such prices do not represent a fair
 measure of the value of work to be performed or to be deleted.
 Prior to approval, the Engineer may modify a Proposal, with the
 concurrence of the Contractor, to make it acceptable. If any modification increases or decreases
 the net savings resulting from the Proposal, the Department will determine the Contractor’s fair
 share upon the basis of the Proposal as modified and upon the final quantities. The Department
 will compute the net savings by subtracting the revised total cost of all bid items affected by the
 Proposal from the total cost of the same bid items as represented in the original Contract.
 Prior to approval of the Proposal that initiates the supplemental agreement,
 submit acceptable Contract-quality plan sheets revised to show all details consistent with the
 Proposal design.
 4-3.9.5 Computations for Change in Contract Cost of Performance: If the
 Proposal is adopted, the Contractor’s share of the net savings as defined hereinafter represents
 full compensation to the Contractor for the Proposal.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 28
 
 The Department will not include its costs to process and implement a
 Proposal in the estimate. However, the Department reserves the right, where it deems such action
 appropriate, to require the Contractor to pay the Department's cost of investigating and
 implementing a Proposal as a condition of considering such proposal. When the Department
 imposes such a condition, the Contractor shall accept this condition in writing, authorizing the
 Department to deduct amounts payable to the Department from any monies due or that may
 become due to the Contractor under the Contract.
 4-3.9.6 Conditions of Acceptance for Major Design Modifications of
 Category 2 Bridges: A Proposal that proposes major design modifications of a category 2
 bridge, as determined by the Engineer, shall have the following conditions of acceptance:
 All bridge Plans relating to the Proposal shall undergo an independent peer
 review conducted by a single independent engineering firm referred to for the purposes of this
 article as the Independent Review Engineer who is not the originator of the Proposal design, and
 is pre-qualified by the Department in accordance with Rule 14-75, Florida Administrative Code.
 The independent peer review is intended to be a comprehensive, thorough verification of the
 original work, giving assurance that the design is in compliance with all Department
 requirements. The Independent Review Engineer’s comments, along with the resolution of each
 comment, shall be submitted to the Department. The Independent Review Engineer shall sign
 and seal the submittal cover letter stating that all comments have been adequately addressed and
 the design is in compliance with the Department requirements. If there are any unresolved
 comments the Independent Review Engineer shall specifically list all unresolved issues in the
 signed and sealed cover letter.
 The Contractor shall designate a primary engineer responsible for the
 Proposal design and as such will be designated as the Contractors Engineer of Record for the
 Proposal design. The Department reserves the right to require the Contractor’s Engineer of
 Record to assume responsibility for design of the entire structure.
 New designs and independent peer reviews shall be in compliance with all
 applicable Department, FHWA and AASHTO criteria requirements including bridge load
 ratings.
 4-3.9.7 Sharing Arrangements: If the Department approves a Proposal, the
 Contractor shall receive 50% of the net reduction in the cost of performance of the Contract as
 determined by the final negotiated agreement between the Contractor and the Department. The
 net reduction will be determined by subtracting from the savings of the construction costs the
 reasonable documented engineering costs incurred by the contractor to design and develop a
 Proposal. The reasonable documented engineering costs will be paid by the Department.
 Engineering costs will be based on the consultant’s certified invoice and may include the costs of
 the Independent Review Engineer in 4-3.9.6. The total engineering costs to be subtracted from
 the savings to determine the net reduction will be limited to 25% of the construction savings and
 shall not include any markup by the Contractor or the costs for engineering services performed
 by the Contractor.
 4-3.9.8 Notice of Intellectual Property Interests and Department’s Future
 Rights to a Proposal:
 4-3.9.8.1 Notice of Intellectual Property Interests: The Contractor’s
 Proposal submittal shall identify with specificity any and all forms of intellectual property rights
 that either the Contractor or any officer, shareholder, employee, consultant, or affiliate, of the
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 29
 
 Contractor, or any other entity who contributed in any measure to the substance of the
 Contractor’s Proposal development, have or may have that are in whole or in part implicated in
 the Proposal. Such required intellectual property rights notice includes, but is not limited to,
 disclosure of any issued patents, copyrights, or licenses; pending patent, copyright or license
 applications; and any intellectual property rights that though not yet issued, applied for or
 intended to be pursued, could nevertheless otherwise be subsequently the subject of patent,
 copyright or license protection by the Contractor or others in the future. This notice requirement
 does not extend to intellectual property rights as to stand-alone or integral components of the
 Proposal that are already on the Department’s Approved Product List (APL) or Standard Plans,
 or are otherwise generally known in the industry as being subject to patent or copyright
 protection.
 4-3.9.8.2 Department’s Future Rights to a Proposal: Notwithstanding
 7-3 nor any other provision of the Standard Specifications, upon acceptance of a Proposal, the
 Contractor hereby grants to the Department and its contractors (such grant being expressly
 limited solely to any and all existing or future Department construction projects and any other
 Department projects that are partially or wholly funded by or for the Department) a royalty-free
 and perpetual license under all forms of intellectual property rights to manufacture, to use, to
 design, to construct, to disclose, to reproduce, to prepare and fully utilize derivative works, to
 distribute, display and publish, in whole or in part, and to permit others to do any of the above,
 and to otherwise in any manner and for any purpose whatsoever do anything reasonably

 orderly and balanced distribution of the work.
 Coordinate, review, date, stamp, approve and sign all shop
 drawings prepared by the Contractor or agents (subcontractor, fabricator, supplier, etc.) prior to
 submitting them to the Engineer of Record for review. Submittal of the drawings confirms
 verification of the work requirements, units of measurement, field measurements, construction
 criteria, sequence of assembly and erection, access and clearances, catalog numbers, and other
 similar data. Indicate on each series of drawings the specification section and sheet or drawing
 number of the Contract Plans to which the submission applies. Indicate on the shop drawings all
 deviations from the Contract drawings and itemize all deviations in the letter of transmittal.
 Likewise, whenever a submittal does not deviate from the Contract Plans, clearly state so in the
 submittal.
 Schedule the submission of shop drawings to allow for a 45 day
 review period. The review period commences upon the Engineer of Record’s receipt of the valid
 submittal or valid re-submittal and terminates upon the transmittal of the submittal back to the
 Contractor. A valid submittal includes all the minimum requirements outlined in 5-1.4.4.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 36
 
 Submit shop drawings to facilitate expeditious review. The
 Contractor is discouraged from transmitting voluminous submittals of shop drawings at one time.
 For submittals transmitted in this manner, allow for the additional review time that may result.
 Only shop drawings distributed with the approval stamps are valid
 and all work that the Contractor performs in advance of approval will be at the Contractor’s risk.
 5-1.4.6.2 Scope of Review by Engineer: The Engineer of Record’s
 review of the shop drawings is for conformity to the requirements of the Contract Documents
 and to the intent of the design. The Engineer of Record’s review of shop drawings which include
 means, methods, techniques, sequences, and construction procedures are limited to the effects on
 the permanent works. The Engineer of Record’s review of submittals which include means,
 methods, techniques, sequences, and construction procedures does not include an in-depth check
 for the ability to perform the work in a safe or efficient manner. Review by the Engineer of
 Record does not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for dimensional accuracy to ensure field
 fit and for conformity of the various components and details.
 5-1.4.6.3 Special Review by Engineer of Shop Drawings for
 Construction Affecting Public Safety: For Construction Affecting Public Safety, the Engineer
 of Record, or other Engineer as the Department appoints for this purpose, will make an
 independent review of all relevant shop drawings and similar documents. Do not proceed with
 construction of the permanent works until receiving the Engineer of Record’s written approval.
 The review of these shop drawings is for overall structural adequacy of the item to support the
 imposed loads and does not include a check for economy, efficiency or ease of construction.
 5-1.4.7 Other Requirements for Shop Drawings for Bridges:
 5-1.4.7.1 Shop Drawings for Structural Steel and Miscellaneous

 detailed submittals.
 7. Any other information pertinent to the proposed scheme or
 intended approach.
 Clearly and concisely present the above information on as few drawings as
 possible in order to provide an overall, integrated summary of the intended approach to the
 project. The Department will use these drawings for information, review planning, and to assess
 the Contractor’s approach in relation to the intent of the original design. Submittal to and receipt
 by the Engineer does not constitute any Department acceptance or approval of the proposals
 shown thereon. Include the details of such proposals on subsequent detailed shop drawing
 submittals. Submit timely revisions and re-submittals for all variations from these overall scheme
 proposals.
 5-1.4.8 Modifications for Construction: Where the Engineer allows the
 Contractor to make modifications to the permanent works for the purposes of expediting the
 Contractor’s chosen construction methods, the Contractor shall submit proposals to the Engineer
 of Record for review and approval prior to modifying the works. Submit proposals for minor
 modifications under the shop drawing process. Indicate on all drawings the deviations from the
 Contract Documents and itemize all deviations in the letter of transmittal. The Department will
 require additional submittals and/or submittal under a Cost Savings Initiative Proposal for major
 modifications.
 Minor modifications are those items that, in the opinion of the Engineer,
 do not significantly affect the quantity of measured work, or the integrity or maintainability of
 the structure or its components. (For example, adjusting concrete dimensions, substituting steel
 plate sizes, changing reinforcing bar size and spacing, etc., all within the acceptable limits of the
 design.)
 Major modifications are any modifications that, in the opinion of the
 Engineer, significantly affect the quantity of measured work, or the integrity or maintainability
 of the structure or its’ components. (For example, substituting alternative beam sizes and
 spacings, changing material strength or type, and the like.). Submit signed and sealed revised
 sheets to the Engineer for any such revisions to the Contract Plans prior to submitting shop
 drawings.
 The Engineer’s decision on the delineation between a minor and a major
 modification and the disposition of a proposal is final.

 will be subjected. The Specialty Engineer must sign and seal the letter of certification.
 5-1.5.4 Erection: For Construction Affecting Public Safety, submit an erection
 plan signed and sealed by the Specialty Engineer to the Engineer at least four weeks prior to
 erection commencing. Include, as part of this submittal, signed and sealed calculations and
 details for any falsework, bracing or other connection supporting the structural elements shown
 in the erection plan. Unless otherwise specified in the Plans, erection plans are not required for
 simple span precast prestressed concrete girder bridges with spans of 170 feet or less.
 At least two weeks prior to beginning erection, conduct a Pre-erection
 meeting to review details of the plan with the Specialty Engineer that signed and sealed the plan,
 and any Specialty Engineers that may inspect the work and the Engineer.
 After erection of the elements, but prior to opening of the facility below
 the structure, ensure that a Specialty Engineer or a designee has inspected the erected member.
 Ensure that the Specialty Engineer has submitted a written certification to the Engineer that the
 structure has been erected in accordance with the signed and sealed erection plan.
 For structures without temporary supports but with temporary girder
 bracing systems, perform, as a minimum, weekly inspections of the bracing until all the
 diaphragms and cross frames are in place. For structures with temporary supports, perform daily
 inspections until the temporary supports are no longer needed as indicated in the erection plans.
 Submit written documentation of the inspections to the Engineer within 24 hours of the
 inspection.
 5-1.6 Corrections for Construction Errors: For work that the Contractor constructs
 incorrectly or does not meet the requirements of the Contract Documents, the Contractor has the
 prerogative to submit an acceptance proposal to the Engineer for review and disposition. The
 acceptance proposal shall describe the error or defect and either describe remedial action for its
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 39
 
 correction or propose a method for its acceptance. In either case, the acceptance proposal shall
 address structural integrity, aesthetics, maintainability, and the effect on Contract Time. The
 Department will judge any such proposal for its effect on these criteria and also for its effect on
 Contract Administration.
 When the Engineer judges that a proposal infringes on the structural integrity or
 maintainability of the structure, the Contractor’s Engineer of Record will perform a technical
 assessment and submit it to the Engineer for approval. Do not take any corrective action without
 the Engineer’s written approval.
 Carry out all approved corrective construction measures at no expense to the
 Department.
 Notwithstanding any disposition of the compensation aspects of the defective
 work, the Engineer’s decision on the technical merits of a proposal is final.
 5-2 Coordination of Contract Documents.
 These Specifications, the Plans, Special Provisions, and all supplementary documents are
 integral parts of the Contract; a requirement occurring in one is as binding as though occurring in
 all. All parts of the Contract are complementary and describe and provide for a complete work.
 In addition to the work and materials specified in the Specifications as being included in any
 specific pay item, include in such pay items additional, incidental work, not specifically
 mentioned, when so shown in the Plans, or if indicated, or obvious and apparent, as being
 necessary for the proper completion of the work under such pay item and not stipulated as being
 covered under other pay items.
 In cases of discrepancy, the governing order of the documents is as follows:
 1. Special Provisions.
 2. Technical Special Provisions.
 3. Plans.
 4. Standard Plans.
 5. Developmental Specifications.

 5-3 Conformity of Work with Contract Documents.
 Perform all work and furnish all materials in reasonably close conformity with the lines,
 grades, cross-sections, dimensions, and material requirements, including tolerances, as specified
 in the Contract Documents.
 In the event that the Engineer finds that the Contractor has used material or produced a
 finished product that is not in reasonably close conformity with the Contract Documents, but that
 the Contractor has produced reasonably acceptable work, the Engineer will determine if the
 Department will accept the work in place. In this event, the Engineer will document the basis of
 acceptance by Contract modification, which provides for an appropriate reduction in the Contract
 price for such work or materials included in the accepted work as deemed necessary to conform
 to the determination based on engineering judgment.
 In the event that the Engineer finds that the Contractor has used material or produced a
 finished product that is not in reasonably close conformity with the Contract Documents, and
 that the Contractor has produced an inferior or unsatisfactory product, the Contractor shall
 remove and replace or otherwise correct the work or materials at no expense to the Department.
 
 Return to Table of Contents

 desired. These assistants and representatives are authorized to inspect all work done and all
 materials furnished. Such inspection may extend to all or any part of the work and to the
 manufacture, preparation, or fabrication of the materials to be used. Such assistants and
 representatives are not authorized to revoke, alter, or waive any requirement of these
 Specifications. Rather, they are authorized to call to the attention of the Contractor any failure of
 the work or materials to meet the Contract Documents, and have the authority to reject materials
 or suspend the work until any questions at issue can be referred to and decided by the Engineer.
 The Engineer will immediately submit written notification to the Contractor of any such
 suspension of the work, stating in detail the reasons for the suspension. The presence of the
 inspector or other assistant in no way lessens the responsibility of the Contractor.
 5-7 Engineering and Layout.
 5-7.1 Control Points Furnished by the Department: The Engineer will provide
 centerline control points (Begin Project, End Project, PIs, PTs, etc.) and bench marks at
 appropriate intervals along the line of the project to facilitate the proper layout of the work.
 Normally, the Engineer will furnish only one bench mark for water crossings. Preserve all
 reference points and bench marks that the Department furnishes.
 As an exception to the above, for projects where the Plans do not show a
 centerline or other survey control line for construction of the work (e.g., resurfacing, safety
 modifications, etc.) the Engineer will provide only points marking the beginning and ending of
 the project, and all exceptions.
 5-7.2 Furnishing of Stake Materials: Furnish all stakes, templates, and other materials
 necessary for establishing and maintaining the lines and grades necessary for control and
 construction of the work.
 5-7.3 Layout of Work: Utilizing the control points furnished by the Department in
 accordance with 5-7.1, establish all horizontal and vertical controls necessary to construct the
 work in conformity to the Contract Documents. Perform all calculations required, and set all
 stakes needed such as grade stakes, offset stakes, reference point stakes, slope stakes, and other
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 41
 
 reference marks or points necessary to provide lines and grades for construction of all roadway,
 bridge, and miscellaneous items.
 When performing utility construction as part of the project, establish all horizontal
 and vertical controls necessary to carry out such work.
 5-7.4 Specific Staking Requirements: When performing new base construction as part
 of the project, set stakes to establish lines and grades for subgrade, base, curb, and related items
 at intervals along the line of the work. If Automated Machine Guidance is utilized, set stakes as
 needed. If Automated Machine Guidance is not utilized, set stakes no greater than 50 feet on
 tangents and 25 feet on curves. Set grade stakes at locations that the Engineer directs to facilitate
 checking of subgrade, base, and pavement elevations in crossovers, intersections, and irregular
 shaped areas.
 For bridge construction stakes and other control, set references at sufficiently
 frequent intervals to ensure construction of all components of a structure in accordance with the
 lines and grades shown in the Plans.
 For projects where the Plans do not show a centerline or other survey control line
 for construction of the work (resurfacing, safety modifications, etc.), provide only such stakes as
 necessary for horizontal and vertical control of work items.
 For resurfacing and resurfacing-widening type projects, establish horizontal
 controls adequate to ensure that the asphalt mix added matches with the existing pavement. In
 tangent sections, set horizontal control points at 100 foot intervals by an instrument survey. In
 curve sections, set horizontal control points at 25 foot intervals by locating and referencing the
 centerline of the existing pavement.
 Establish by an instrument survey, and mark on the surface of the finished
 pavement at 25 foot intervals, the points necessary for striping of the finished roadway. As an
 exception, for resurfacing and resurfacing/widening projects, establish these points in the same
 manner as used for horizontal control of paving operations. Mark the pavement with white paint.
 If performing striping, the Engineer may approve an alternate method for layout of striping
 provided that the Contractor achieves an alignment equal to or better than the alignment that
 would be achieved using an instrument survey.
 For projects that include temporary or permanent striping of “no passing zones”,
 provide the location and length of these zones as shown in the Plans, except projects where the
 vertical or horizontal alignment is new or altered from preconstruction alignment. For projects
 that consist of new or altered vertical or horizontal alignment, the Department will provide the
 location and length of the "no passing zones" during construction. For these projects, submit
 written notification to the Engineer not less than 21 calendar days prior to beginning striping.
 For all projects, set a station identification stake at each right-of-way line at
 100 foot intervals and at all locations where a change in right-of-way width occurs. Mark each of
 these stakes with painted numerals, of a size readable from the roadway, corresponding to the
 project station at which it is located. As an exception to the above, for projects where Plans do
 not show right-of-way lines, set station identification stakes at locations and intervals appropriate
 to the type of work being done. For resurfacing and resurfacing/widening projects, set station
 identification stakes at 200 foot intervals.
 5-7.5 Personnel, Equipment, and Record Requirements: Employ only competent
 personnel and use only suitable equipment in performing layout work. Do not engage the
 services of any person or persons in the employ of the Department for performance of layout
 work.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 42
 
 Keep adequate field notes and records while performing as layout work. Make
 these field notes and records available for the Engineer’s review as the work progresses, and
 submit to the Engineer at the time of completion of the project. The Engineer’s inspection,
 checking, or acceptance of the Contractor’s field notes or layout work does not relieve the
 Contractor of his responsibility to achieve the lines, grades, and dimensions shown in the
 Contract Documents.
 Prior to final acceptance of the project, mark, in a permanent manner on the
 surface of the completed work, all horizontal control points originally furnished by the
 Department.
 5-7.6 Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) Work Plan: If used, submit a
 comprehensive written GNSS Work Plan to the Engineer for Department review and acceptance
 at the preconstruction conference or at least 30 days before starting work using GNSS. Update
 the plan as necessary during construction and notify the Department of all changes. The GNSS
 Work Plan shall describe how GNSS enabled Automated Machine Guidance technology will be
 integrated into other technologies employed on the project. At a minimum, the GNSS Work Plan
 will include the following:
 1. Designate which portions of the Contract will be done using GNSS
 enabled Automated Machine Guidance and which portions will be constructed using
 conventional survey methodology.
 2. Describe the manufacturer, model, and software version of the GNSS
 equipment.
 3. Provide information on the qualifications of Contractor staff. Include
 formal training and field experience. Designate a single staff person as the primary contact for
 GNSS technology issues.
 4. Describe how project control will be established. Include a list and map
 showing control points enveloping the site.
 5. Describe site calibration procedures. Include a map of the control points
 used for site calibration and control points used to validate the site calibration. Describe the
 frequency of site calibration and how site calibration will be documented. At a minimum, verify
 the site calibration twice daily.
 6. Describe the Contractor's quality control procedures for verifying
 mechanical calibration and maintenance of construction and guidance equipment. Include the
 frequency and type of verification performed to ensure the constructed grades conform to the
 Contract Documents.
 Keep on site and provide upon request, a copy of the project’s most up-to-date
 GNSS Work Plan at the project site.
 5-7.7 Payment: Include the cost of performing layout work as described above in the
 Contract unit prices for the various items of work that require layout.
 5-8 Contractor’s Supervision.
 5-8.1 Prosecution of Work: Give the work the constant attention necessary to ensure the
 scheduled progress, and cooperate fully with the Engineer and with other contractors at work in
 the vicinity.
 5-8.2 Contractor’s Superintendent: Maintain a competent superintendent at the site at
 all times while work is in progress to act as the Contractor’s agent. Provide a superintendent who
 is a competent superintendent capable of properly interpreting the Contract Documents and is
 thoroughly experienced in the type of work being performed. Provide a superintendent with the
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 43
 
 full authority to receive instructions from the Engineer and to execute the orders or directions of
 the Engineer, including promptly supplying any materials, tools, equipment, labor, and
 incidentals that may be required. Provide such superintendence regardless of the amount of work
 sublet.
 Provide a superintendent who speaks and understands English, and maintain at
 least one other responsible person who speaks and understands English, on the project during all
 working hours.
 5-8.3 Supervision for Emergencies: Provide a responsible person, who speaks and
 understands English, and who is available at or reasonably near the worksite on a 24 hour basis,
 seven days a week. Designate this person as the point of contact for emergencies and in cases
 that require immediate action to maintain traffic or to resolve any other problem that might arise.
 Submit the phone numbers and names of personnel designated to be contacted in cases of
 emergencies, along with a description of the project location, to the Florida Highway Patrol and
 all other local law enforcement agencies.
 5-9 General Inspection Requirements.
 5-9.1 Cooperation by Contractor: Do not perform work or furnish materials without
 obtaining inspection by the Engineer. Provide the Engineer with safe means of access to the
 work, so the Engineer can determine whether the work performed and materials used are in
 accordance with the requirements and intent of the Contract Documents. If the Engineer so
 requests at any time before final acceptance of the work, remove or uncover such portions of the
 finished work as directed. After examination, restore the uncovered portions of the work to the
 standard required by the Contract Documents. If the Engineer determines that the work so
 exposed or examined is unacceptable, perform the uncovering or removal, and the replacing of
 the covering or making good of the parts removed, at no expense to the Department. However, if
 the Engineer determines that the work thus exposed or examined is acceptable, the Department
 will pay for the uncovering or removing, and the replacing of the covering or making good of the
 parts removed in accordance with Section 4-4.
 5-9.2 Failure of Engineer to Reject Work During Construction: If, during or prior to
 construction operations, the Engineer fails to reject defective work or materials, whether from
 lack of discovery of such defect or for any other reason, such initial failure to reject in no way
 prevents the later rejection when such defect is discovered, or obligates the Department to final
 acceptance. The Department is not responsible for losses suffered due to any necessary removals
 or repairs of such defects.
 5-9.3 Failure to Remove and Renew Defective Materials and Work: If the Contractor
 fails or refuses to remove and renew any defective materials used or work performed, or to make
 any necessary repairs in an acceptable manner and in accordance with the requirements of the
 Contract within the time indicated in writing, the Engineer has the authority to repair, remove, or
 renew the unacceptable or defective materials or work as necessary, all at the Contractor’s
 expense. The Department will obtain payment for any expense it incurs in making these repairs,
 removals, or renewals, that the Contractor fails or refuses to make, by deducting such expenses
 from any moneys due or which may become due the Contractor, or by charging such amounts
 against the Contract bond.
 5-9.4 Inspection by Federal Government: When the United States Government pays a
 portion of the cost of construction, its representatives may inspect the construction work as they
 deem necessary. However, such inspection will in no way make the Federal Government a party
 to the Contract.

 5-10 Final Inspection.
 5-10.1 Maintenance until Acceptance: Maintain all Work until the Engineer has given
 final acceptance in accordance with 5-11.
 5-10.2 Inspection for Acceptance: Upon submittal of written notification that all
 Contract Work, or all Contract Work on the portion of the Contract scheduled for acceptance,
 has been completed, the Engineer will make an inspection for acceptance. The inspection will be
 made within seven days of such notification. If the Engineer finds that all work has been
 satisfactorily completed, the Department will consider such inspection as the final inspection. If
 any or all of the Work is found to be unsatisfactory, the Engineer will detail the remedial work
 required to achieve acceptance. Immediately perform such remedial work. Subsequent
 inspections will be made on the remedial work until the Engineer accepts all Work.
 Upon satisfactory completion of the Work, the Department will submit written
 notice of acceptance, either partial or final, to the Contractor.
 Until final acceptance in accordance with 5-11, replace or repair any damage to
 the accepted Work. Payment of such work will be as provided in 7-14.
 5-10.3 Partial Acceptance: At the Engineer’s sole discretion, the Engineer may accept
 any portion of the Work under the provisions of 5-10.2.
 5-10.4 Conditional Acceptance: The Engineer will not make, or consider requests for
 conditional acceptance of a project.
 5-11 Final Acceptance.
 When, upon completion of the final construction inspection of the entire project, the
 Engineer determines that the Contractor has satisfactorily completed the work, the Engineer will
 submit written notice of final acceptance to the Contractor.
 5-12 Claims by Contractor.
 5-12.1 General: When the Contractor deems that extra compensation or a time extension
 is due beyond that agreed to by the Engineer, whether due to delay, additional work, altered
 work, differing site conditions, breach of Contract, or for any other cause, the Contractor shall
 follow the procedures set forth herein for preservation, presentation and resolution of the claim.
 Submission of timely notice of intent to file a claim, preliminary time extension
 request, time extension request, and the certified written claim, together with full and complete
 claim documentation, are each a condition precedent to the Contractor bringing any circuit court,
 arbitration, or other formal claims resolution proceeding against the Department for the items
 and for the sums or time set forth in the Contractor’s certified written claim. The failure to
 provide such notice of intent, preliminary time extension request, time extension request,
 certified written claim and full and complete claim documentation within the time required shall
 constitute a full, complete, absolute and irrevocable waiver by the Contractor of any right to
 additional compensation or a time extension for such claim.
 5-12.2 Notice of Claim:
 5-12.2.1 Claims For Extra Work: Where the Contractor deems that additional
 compensation or a time extension is due for work or materials not expressly provided for in the
 Contract or which is by written directive expressly ordered by the Engineer pursuant to 4-3, the
 Contractor shall submit written notification to the Engineer of the intention to make a claim for
 additional compensation before beginning the work on which the claim is based, and if seeking a
 time extension, the Contractor shall also submit a preliminary request for time extension
 pursuant to 8-7.3.2 within ten calendar days after commencement of a delay and a request for

 45
 
 Contract Time extension pursuant to 8-7.3.2 within thirty calendar days after the elimination of
 the delay. If such written notification is not submitted and the Engineer is not afforded the
 opportunity for keeping strict account of actual labor, material, equipment, and time, the
 Contractor waives the claim for additional compensation or a time extension. Such notice by the
 Contractor, and the fact that the Engineer has kept account of the labor, materials and equipment,
 and time, shall not in any way be construed as establishing the validity of the claim or method
 for computing any compensation or time extension for such claim. On projects with an original
 Contract amount of $3,000,000 or less within 90 calendar days after final acceptance of the
 project in accordance with 5-11, and on projects with an original Contract amount greater than
 $3,000,000 within 180 calendar days after final acceptance of the project in accordance with
 5-11, the Contractor shall submit full and complete claim documentation as described in 5-12.3
 and duly certified pursuant to 5-12.9. However, for any claim or part of a claim that pertains
 solely to final estimate quantities disputes the Contractor shall submit full and complete claim
 documentation as described in 5-12.3 and duly certified pursuant to 5-12.9, as to such final
 estimate claim dispute issues, within 90 or 180 calendar days, respectively, of the Contractor’s
 receipt of the Department’s final estimate.
 If the Contractor fails to submit a certificate of claim as described in
 5-12.9, the Department will so notify the Contractor in writing. The Contractor shall have ten
 calendar days from receipt of the notice to resubmit the claim documentation, without change,
 with a certificate of claim as described in 5-12.9, without regard to whether the resubmission is
 within the applicable 90 or 180 calendar day deadline for submission of full and complete claim
 documentation. Failure by the Contractor to comply with the ten calendar day notice shall
 constitute a waiver of the claim.
 5-12.2.2 Claims For Delay: Where the Contractor deems that additional
 compensation or a time extension is due on account of delay, differing site conditions, breach of
 Contract, or any other cause other than for work or materials not expressly provided for in the
 Contract (Extra Work) or which is by written directive of the Engineer expressly ordered by the
 Engineer pursuant to 4-3, the Contractor shall submit a written notice of intent to the Engineer
 within ten days after commencement of a delay to a controlling work item expressly notifying
 the Engineer that the Contractor intends to seek additional compensation, and if seeking a time
 extension, the Contractor shall also submit a preliminary request for time extension pursuant to
 8-7.3.2 within ten calendar days after commencement of a delay to a controlling work item, as to
 such delay and providing a reasonably complete description as to the cause and nature of the
 delay and the possible impacts to the Contractor’s work by such delay, and a request for Contract
 Time extension pursuant to 8-7.3.2 within thirty calendar days after the elimination of the delay.
 On projects with an original Contract amount of $3,000,000 or less within 90 calendar days after
 final acceptance of the project in accordance with 5-11, and on projects with an original Contract
 amount greater than $3,000,000 within 180 calendar days after final acceptance of the project in
 accordance with 5-11, the Contractor shall submit full and complete documentation as described
 in 5-12.3 and duly certified pursuant to 5-12.9.
 If the Contractor fails to submit a certificate of claim as described in
 5-12.9, the Department will so notify the Contractor in writing. The Contractor shall have ten
 calendar days from receipt of the notice to resubmit the claim documentation, without change,
 with a certificate of claim as described in 5-12.9, without regard to whether the resubmission is
 within the applicable 90 or 180 calendar day deadline for submission of full and complete claim

 documentation. Failure by the Contractor to comply with the ten calendar day notice shall
 constitute a waiver of the claim.
 There shall be no Contractor entitlement to any monetary compensation or
 time extension for any delays or delay impacts, whatsoever, that are not to a controlling work
 item, and then as to any such delay to a controlling work item entitlement to any monetary
 compensation or time extension shall only be to the extent such is otherwise provided for
 expressly under 4-3 or 5-12, except that in the instance of delay to a non-controlling item of
 work the Contractor may be compensated for the direct costs of idle labor or equipment only, at
 the rates set forth in 4-3.2.1(1) and (3), and then only to the extent the Contractor could not
 reasonably mitigate such idleness.
 5-12.3 Content of Written Claim: As a condition precedent to the Contractor being
 entitled to additional compensation or a time extension under the Contract, for any claim, the
 Contractor shall submit a certified written claim to the Department which will include for each
 individual claim, at a minimum, the following information:
 1. A detailed factual statement of the claim providing all necessary dates,
 locations, and items of work affected and included in each claim;
 2. The date or dates on which actions resulting in the claim occurred or conditions
 resulting in the claim became evident;
 3. Identification of all pertinent documents and the substance of any material oral
 communications relating to such claim and the name of the persons making such material oral
 communications;
 4. Identification of the provisions of the Contract which support the claim and a
 statement of the reasons why such provisions support the claim, or alternatively, the provisions
 of the Contract which allegedly have been breached and the actions constituting such breach;
 5. A detailed compilation of the amount of additional compensation sought and a
 breakdown of the amount sought as follows:
 a. documented additional job site labor expenses;
 b. documented additional cost of materials and supplies;
 c. a list of additional equipment costs claimed, including each piece of
 equipment and the rental rate claimed for each;
 d. any other additional direct costs or damages and the documents in
 support thereof;
 e. any additional indirect costs or damages and all documentation in
 support thereof.
 6. A detailed compilation of the specific dates and the exact number of calendar
 days sought for a time extension, the basis for entitlement to time for each day, all
 documentation of the delay, and a breakout of the number of days claimed for each identified
 event, circumstance or occurrence.
 Further, the Contractor shall be prohibited from amending either the bases of
 entitlement or the amount of any compensation or time stated for any and all issues claimed in
 the Contractor’s written claim submitted hereunder, and any circuit court, arbitration, or other
 formal claims resolution proceeding shall be limited solely to the bases of entitlement and the
 amount of any compensation or time stated for any and all issues claimed in the Contractor’s
 written claim submitted hereunder. This shall not, however, preclude a Contractor from
 withdrawing or reducing any of the bases of entitlement and the amount of any compensation or
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 47
 
 time stated for any and all issues claimed in the Contractor’s written claim submitted hereunder
 at any time.
 5-12.4 Action on Claim: The Engineer will respond in writing on projects with an
 original Contract amount of $3,000,000 or less within 90 calendar days of receipt of a complete
 claim submitted by a Contractor in compliance with 5-12.3, and on projects with an original
 Contract amount greater than $3,000,000 within 120 calendar days of receipt of a complete claim
 submitted by a Contractor in compliance with 5-12.3. Failure by the Engineer to respond to a
 claim in writing within 90 or 120 days, respectively, after receipt of a complete claim submitted
 by the Contractor in compliance with 5-12.3 constitutes a denial of the claim by the Engineer. If
 the Engineer finds the claim or any part thereof to be valid, such partial or whole claim will be
 allowed and paid for to the extent deemed valid and any time extension granted, if applicable, as
 provided in the Contract. No circuit court or arbitration proceedings on any claim, or a part
 thereof, may be filed until after final acceptance per 5-11 of all Contract work by the Department
 or denial hereunder, whichever occurs last.
 5-12.5 Pre-Settlement and Pre-Judgment Interest: Entitlement to any pre-settlement
 or pre-judgment interest on any claim amount determined to be valid subsequent to the
 Department’s receipt of a certified written claim in full compliance with 5-12.3, whether
 determined by a settlement or a final ruling in formal proceedings, the Department shall pay to
 the Contractor simple interest calculated at the Prime Rate (as reported by the Wall Street
 Journal as the base rate on corporate loans posted by at least 75% of the nations 30 largest banks)
 as of the 60th calendar day following the Department’s receipt of a certified written claim in full
 compliance with 5-12.3, such interest to accrue beginning 60 calendar days following the
 Department’s receipt of a certified written claim in full compliance with 5-12.3 and ending on
 the date of final settlement or formal ruling.
 5-12.6 Compensation for Extra Work or Delay:
 5-12.6.1 Compensation for Extra Work: Notwithstanding anything to the
 contrary contained in the Contract Documents, the Contractor shall not be entitled to any
 compensation beyond that provided for in 4-3.2.
 5-12.6.2 Compensation for Delay: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
 contained in the Contract Documents, the additional compensation set forth in 5-12.6.2.1 shall be
 the Contractor’s sole monetary remedy for any delay other than to perform extra work caused by
 the Department unless the delay shall have been caused by acts constituting willful or intentional
 interference by the Department with the Contractor’s performance of the work and then only
 where such acts continue after Contractor’s written notice to the Department of such
 interference. The parties anticipate that delays may be caused by or arise from any number of
 events during the term of the Contract, including, but not limited to, work performed, work
 deleted, supplemental agreements, work orders, disruptions, differing site conditions, utility
 conflicts, design changes or defects, time extensions, extra work, right-of-way issues, permitting
 issues, actions of suppliers, subcontractors or other contractors, actions by third parties,
 suspensions of work by the Engineer pursuant to 8-6.1, shop drawing approval process delays,
 expansion of the physical limits of the project to make it functional, weather, weekends,
 holidays, special events, suspension of Contract Time, or other events, forces or factors
 sometimes experienced in construction work. Such delays or events and their potential impacts
 on the performance by the Contractor are specifically contemplated and acknowledged by the
 parties in entering into this Contract, and shall not be deemed to constitute willful or intentional
 interference with the Contractor’s performance of the work without clear and convincing proof
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 48
 
 that they were the result of a deliberate act, without reasonable and good-faith basis, and
 specifically intended to disrupt the Contractor’s performance.
 5-12.6.2.1 Compensation for Direct Costs, Indirect Costs, Expenses,
 and Profit thereon, of or from Delay: For any delay claim, the Contractor shall be entitled to
 monetary compensation for the actual idle labor and equipment, and indirect costs, expenses, and
 profit thereon, as provided for in 4-3.2.1(4) and solely for costs incurred beyond what reasonable
 mitigation thereof the Contractor could have undertaken.
 5-12.7 Mandatory Claim Records: After submitting to the Engineer a notice of intent to
 file a claim for extra work or delay, the Contractor must keep daily records of all labor, material
 and equipment costs incurred for operations affected by the extra work or delay. These daily
 records must identify each operation affected by the extra work or delay and the specific
 locations where work is affected by the extra work or delay, as nearly as possible. The Engineer
 may also keep records of all labor, material and equipment used on the operations affected by the
 extra work or delay. The Contractor shall, once a notice of intent to claim has been timely filed,
 and not less than weekly thereafter as long as appropriate, submit the Contractor’s daily records
 to the Engineer and be likewise entitled to receive the Department’s daily records. The daily
 records to be submitted hereunder shall be done at no cost to the recipient.
 5-12.8 Claims For Acceleration: The Department shall have no liability for any
 constructive acceleration of the work, nor shall the Contractor have any right to make any claim
 for constructive acceleration nor include the same as an element of any claim the Contractor may
 otherwise submit under this Contract. If the Engineer gives express written direction for the
 Contractor to accelerate its efforts, such written direction will set forth the prices and other
 pertinent information and will be reduced to a written Contract Document promptly. No payment
 will be made on a Supplemental Agreement for acceleration prior to the Department’s approval
 of the documents.
 5-12.9 Certificate of Claim: When submitting any claim, the Contractor shall certify
 under oath and in writing, in accordance with the formalities required by Florida law, that the
 claim is made in good faith, that the supportive data are accurate and complete to the
 Contractor’s best knowledge and belief, and that the amount of the claim accurately reflects what
 the Contractor in good faith believes to be the Department’s liability. Such certification must be
 made by an officer or director of the Contractor with the authority to bind the Contractor.
 5-12.10 Non-Recoverable Items: The parties agree that for any claim the Department
 will not have liability for the following items of damages or expense:
 1. Loss of profit, incentives or bonuses;
 2. Any claim for other than extra work or delay;
 3. Consequential damages, including, but not limited to, loss of bonding capacity,
 loss of bidding opportunities, loss of credit standing, cost of financing, interest paid, loss of other
 work or insolvency;
 4. Acceleration costs and expenses, except where the Department has expressly
 and specifically directed the Contractor in writing “to accelerate at the Department’s expense”;
 nor
 5. Attorney fees, claims preparation expenses and costs of litigation.
 5-12.11 Exclusive Remedies: Notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, the
 parties agree that the Department shall have no liability to the Contractor for expenses, costs, or
 items of damages other than those which are specifically identified as payable under 5-12. In the
 event any legal action for additional compensation, whether on account of delay, acceleration,
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 49
 
 breach of contract, or otherwise, the Contractor agrees that the Department’s liability will be
 limited to those items which are specifically identified as payable in 5-12.
 5-12.12 Settlement Discussions: The content of any discussions or meetings held
 between the Department and the Contractor to settle or resolve any claims submitted by the
 Contractor against the Department shall be inadmissible in any legal, equitable, arbitration or
 administrative proceedings brought by the Contractor against the Department for payment of
 such claim. Dispute Resolution Board, State Arbitration Board and Claim Review Committee
 proceedings are not settlement discussions, for purposes of this provision.
 5-12.13 Personal Liability of Public Officials: In carrying out any of the provisions of
 the Contract or in exercising any power or authority granted to the Secretary of Transportation,
 Engineer or any of their respective employees or agents, there shall be no liability on behalf of
 any employee, officer or official of the Department for which such individual is responsible,
 either personally or as officials or representatives of the Department. It is understood that in all
 such matters such individuals act solely as agents and representatives of the Department.
 5-12.14 Auditing of Claims: All claims filed against the Department shall be subject to
 audit at any time following the filing of the claim, whether or not such claim is part of a suit
 pending in the Courts of this State. The audit may be performed, at the Department’s sole
 discretion, by employees of the Department or by any independent auditor appointed by the
 Department, or both. The audit may begin after ten days written notice to the Contractor,
 subcontractor, or supplier. The Contractor, subcontractor, or supplier shall make a good faith
 effort to cooperate with the auditors. As a condition precedent to recovery on any claim, the
 Contractor, subcontractor, or supplier must retain sufficient records, and provide full and
 reasonable access to such records, to allow the Department’s auditors to verify the claim and
 failure to retain sufficient records of the claim or failure to provide full and reasonable access to
 such records shall constitute a waiver of that portion of such claim that cannot be verified and
 shall bar recovery thereunder. Further, and in addition to such audit access, upon the Contractor
 submitting a written claim, the Department shall have the right to request and receive, and the
 Contractor shall have the affirmative obligation to submit to the Department any and all
 documents in the possession of the Contractor or its subcontractors, materialmen or suppliers as
 may be deemed relevant by the Department in its review of the basis, validity or value of the
 Contractor’s claim.
 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Contractor shall upon written
 request of the Department make available to the Department’s auditors, or upon the
 Department’s written request, submit at the Department’s expense, any or all of the following
 documents:
 1. Daily time sheets and foreman’s daily reports and diaries;
 2. Insurance, welfare and benefits records;
 3. Payroll register;
 4. Earnings records;
 5. Payroll tax return;
 6. Material invoices, purchase orders, and all material and supply
 acquisition contracts;
 7. Material cost distribution worksheet;
 8. Equipment records (list of company owned, rented or other equipment
 used);
 9. Vendor rental agreements and subcontractor invoices;

 7-1.9 Florida Minority Business Loan Mobilization Program:
 The Loan Mobilization Program is established by Section 288.706 of the Florida
 Statutes, and has as its goal to assist minority business enterprises by facilitating working capital
 loans to those eligible businesses that are Contractors or subcontractors on Department contracts.
 The limits of such advances under this program shall be as specified in
 Section 288.706 of the Florida Statutes. In the case of a subcontractor, the amount of the advance
 will be based on the subcontract unit prices, not the contract unit prices.
 All prime Contractor vendors shall be required to incorporate the designated loan
 mobilization payment procedures in subcontract agreements with minority business enterprise
 vendors participating in this program and to cooperate in the release of designated loan
 mobilization payments to achieve the objective of providing working capital for minority
 business enterprise subcontract vendors.
 When the Contract has been awarded or, in the case of a subcontractor, a
 subcontract has been signed with the prime Contractor, application for participation in this
 program will be submitted in writing to the Engineer. Such application must be made prior to
 commencement of the work. If the application is made on behalf of a subcontractor, it shall be
 considered incomplete if the subcontract with the unit prices of the work clearly delineated is not
 included in the submittal.
 When all applicable conditions have been met, approval for participation will be
 made by the Office of the Comptroller and the applicant will be notified of the approval action
 taken.
 Once approval has been obtained and the Notice to Proceed has been issued,
 disbursement of the monies will be made at the request of the applicant. The designated loan
 mobilization payment may be paid prior to the commencement of work on the Contract.
 However, if the work on the Contract has not commenced and the payment has not been made,
 then the Contract Time may not commence until the payment is made. All designated loan
 mobilization payments will be made payable jointly to the prime Contractor and the participating
 financial institution. When a subcontractor is the participant in the program, such payments shall
 be paid to the participant within 10 business days after receipt of the funds from the Department.
 Repayment of monies advanced through this program will be made after the value
 of the work accomplished by the participant reaches 50 percent. Contractors are encouraged to
 make weekly or bi-weekly payments to subcontractors participating in this program.
 7-2 Permits and Licenses.
 7-2.1 General: Except for permits procured by the Department, as incorporated by
 Special Provision expanding this Subarticle, if any, procure all permits and licenses, pay all

 national origin, or sex in the performance of this contract. The Contractor shall carry out
 applicable requirements of 49 CFR Part 26 in the award and administration of DOT-assisted
 Contracts. Failure by the Contractor to carry out these requirements is a material breach of this
 Contract, which may result in the termination of this Contract or such other remedy as the
 recipient deems appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to,
 1. Withholding monthly progress payments;
 2. Assessing sanctions;
 3. Liquidated damages; and/or
 4. Disqualifying the Contractor from future bidding as non-responsible.”
 7-24.3 Plan Requirements: Include the following in the DBE Affirmative Action
 Program Plan:
 1. A policy statement, signed by an authorized representative (president, chief

 74
 
 authority, responsibility, and duties of the Liaison Officer and support staff. The Liaison Officer
 and staff are responsible for developing, managing, and implementing the program on a day-today basis for carrying out technical assistance activities for DBEs and for disseminating
 information on available business opportunities so that DBEs are provided an equitable
 opportunity to participate in Contracts let by the Department.
 3. Utilization of techniques to facilitate DBE participation in contracting activities
 which include, but are not limited to:
 a. Soliciting price quotations and arranging a time for the review of Plans,

 7-24.5 Counting DBE Participation and Commercially Useful Functions:
 49 CFR Part 26.55 specifies when DBE credit shall be awarded for work performed by a DBE.
 DBE credit can only be awarded for work actually performed by DBEs themselves for the types
 of work for which they are certified. When reporting DBE Commitments, only include the
 dollars that a DBE is expected to earn for work they perform with their own workforce and
 equipment. Update DBE Commitments to reflect changes to the initial amount that was
 previously reported or to add DBEs not initially reported.
 When a DBE participates in a contract, the value of the work is determined in
 accordance with 49 CFR Part 26.55, for example:
 1. The Department will count only the value of the work performed by the
 DBE toward DBE goals. The entire amount of the contract that is performed by the DBE’s own
 forces (including the cost of supplies, equipment and materials obtained by the DBE for the
 contract work) will be counted as DBE credit.
 2. The Department will count the entire amount of fees or commissions
 charged by the DBE firm for providing a bona fide service, such as professional, technical,
 consultant, or managerial services or for providing bonds or insurance specifically required for
 the performance of a Department-assisted contract, toward DBE goals, provided that the
 Department determines the fees to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees
 customarily followed for similar services.
 3. When the DBE subcontracts part of the work of its contract to another
 firm, the Department will count the value of the subcontracted work only if the DBE’s
 subcontractor is itself a DBE. Work that a DBE subcontracts to a non-DBE firm does not count
 toward DBE goals.
 4. When a DBE performs as a participant in a joint venture, the
 Department will count the portion of the dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly
 defined portion of the work the DBE performs with its own forces toward DBE goals.
 5. The Contractors shall ensure that only expenditures to DBEs that
 perform a commercially useful function (CUF) in the work of a contract may be counted toward
 the voluntary DBE goal.
 6. A DBE performs a commercially useful function when it is responsible
 for execution of the work of the contract and is carrying out its responsibilities by actually
 performing, managing, and supervising the work involved. To perform a commercially useful
 function, the DBE must also be responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the
 contract, for negotiating price, determining quality and quantity, ordering the material, and
 installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself.
 7. Contractors wishing to use joint checks involving DBE credit must
 provide written notice to the District Contract Compliance Office prior to issuance of the joint
 check. The Contractor must also provide a copy of the notice to the DBE subcontractor and
 maintain a copy with the project records.
 8. To determine whether a DBE is performing a commercially useful
 function, the Department will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices,
 whether the amount the firm is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is
 actually performing and the DBE credit claimed for its performance of the work, and other
 relevant factors.
 9. A DBE does not perform a commercially useful function if its role is
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 76
 
 limited to that of an extra participant in a transaction, contract, or project through which funds
 are passed in order to obtain the appearance of DBE participation.
 10. If a DBE does not perform or exercise responsibility for at least 30%
 of the total cost of its contract with its own workforce, or if the DBE subcontracts a greater
 portion of the work of a contract than would be expected on the basis of normal industry practice
 for the type of work involved, the DBE has not performed a commercially useful function.
 7-24.6 Prompt Payments: Meet the requirements of 9-5 for payments to all DBE
 subcontractors.
 7-25 On-The-Job Training Requirements.
 As part of the Contractor’s equal employment opportunity affirmative action program,
 training shall be provided as follows:
 The Contractor shall provide On-The-Job Training aimed at developing full
 journeymen in the type of trade or job classification involved in the work. In the event the
 Contractor subcontracts a portion of the contract work, it shall determine how many, if any, of
 the trainees are to be trained by the subcontractor provided, that the Contractor shall retain the
 primary responsibility for meeting the training requirements imposed by this Section. Ensure
 that, when feasible, 25% of trainees in each occupation are in their first year of training. The
 Contractor shall incorporate the requirements of this Section into such subcontract.
 The number of trainees will be estimated on the number of calendar days of the
 contract, the dollar value, and the scope of work to be performed. The trainee goal will be
 finalized at a Post-Preconstruction Trainee Evaluation Meeting and the goal will be distributed
 among the work classifications based on the following criteria:
 1. Determine the number of trainees on Federal Aid Contract:
 a. No trainees will be required for contracts with a Contract Time
 allowance of less than 275 calendar days.
 b. If the Contract Time allowance is 275 calendar days or more, the
 number of trainees shall be established in accordance with the following chart:
 Estimated Contract Amount
 $2,000,000 or less
 Over $2,000,000 to $4,000,000
 Over $4,000,000 to $6,000,000

 Further, if the Contractor or subcontractor requests to utilize banked trainees as discussed
 later in this Section, a Banking Certificate will be validated at this meeting allowing credit to the
 Contractor for previously banked trainees. Banked credits of prime Contractors working as
 Subcontractors may be accepted for credit. The Contractor’s Project Manager, the Construction
 Project Engineer and the Department’s District Contract Compliance Manager will attend this
 meeting. Within ten days after the Post-Preconstruction Training Evaluation Meeting, the
 Contractor shall submit to the Department for approval an On-The-Job Training Schedule
 indicating the number of trainees to be trained in each selected classification and the portion of
 the Contract Time during which training of each trainee is to take place. This schedule may be
 subject to change if any of the following occur:
 1. When a start date on the approved On-The-Job Training Schedule has been
 missed by 14 or more days;
 2. When there is a change in previously approved classifications; or
 3. When replacement trainees are added due to voluntary or involuntary
 termination
 The revised schedule will be resubmitted to and approved by the Department’s District
 Contract Compliance Manager.
 The following criteria will be used in determining whether or not the Contractor has
 complied with this Section as it relates to the number of trainees to be trained:
 1. Credit will be allowed for each trainee that is both enrolled and satisfactorily
 completes training on this Contract. Credit for trainees, over the established number for this
 Contract, will be carried in a “bank” for the Contractor and credit will be allowed for those
 surplus trainees in subsequent, applicable projects. A “banked” trainee is described as an
 employee who has been trained on a project, over and above the established goal, and for which
 the Contractor desires to preserve credit for utilization on a subsequent project.
 2. Credit will be allowed for each trainee that has been previously enrolled in the
 Department’s approved training program on another contract and continues training in the same
 job classification and completes their training on a different contract.
 3. Credit will be allowed for each trainee who, due to the amount of work
 available in their classification, is given the greatest practical amount of training on the contract
 regardless of whether or not the trainee completes training.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 78
 
 4. Credit will be allowed for any training position indicated in the approved
 On-The-Job Training Schedule, if the Contractor can demonstrate that a good faith effort to
 provide training in that classification was made.
 5. No credit will be allowed for a trainee whose employment by the Contractor is
 involuntarily terminated unless the Contractor can clearly demonstrate good cause for this action.
 Training and upgrading of minorities, women and economically disadvantaged persons
 toward journeyman status is a primary objective of this Section. Accordingly, the Contractor
 shall make every effort to enroll minority trainees and women (e.g., by conducting systematic and
 direct recruitment through public and private sources likely to yield minority and women
 trainees) to the extent such persons are available within a reasonable area of recruitment. If a
 non-minority male is enrolled into the On-The-Job Training Program, the On-The-Job Training
 Notification of Personnel Action Form notifying the District Contract Compliance Manager of
 such action shall be accompanied by a disadvantaged certification or a justification for such
 action acceptable to the Department’s District Contract Compliance Manager. The Contractor
 will be given an opportunity and will be responsible for demonstrating the steps that it has taken
 in pursuance thereof, prior to a determination as to whether the Contractor is in compliance with
 this Section. This training is not intended, and shall not be used, to discriminate against any
 applicant for training, whether a minority, woman or disadvantaged person.
 No employee shall be employed as a trainee in any classification in which they have
 successfully completed a training course leading to journeyman status, or have been employed as
 a journeyman. The Contractor may satisfy this requirement by including appropriate questions in
 the employee application or by other suitable means. Regardless of the method used, the
 Contractor’s records should document the findings in each case.
 The minimum length and type of training for each classification will be as established at
 the Post-Preconstruction Trainee Evaluation Meeting and approved by the Department.
 Graduation to journeyman status will be based upon satisfactory completion of a Proficiency
 Demonstration set up at the completion of training and established for the specific training
 classification, completion of the minimum hours in a training classification range, and the
 employer’s satisfaction that the trainee does meet journeyman status in the classification of
 training. Upon reaching journeyman status, the following documentation must be forwarded to
 the District Contract Compliance Office:
 1. Trainee Enrollment and Personnel Action Form
 2. Proficiency Demonstration Verification Form indicating completion of each
 standard established for the classification signed by representatives of both the Contractor and
 the Department.
 The Department and the Contractor shall establish a program that is tied to the scope of
 the work in the project and the length of operations providing it is reasonably calculated to meet
 the equal employment opportunity obligations of the Contractor and to qualify the average
 trainee for journeyman status in the classifications concerned, by at least, the minimum hours
 prescribed for a training classification. Furthermore, apprenticeship programs registered with the
 U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, or with a State apprenticeship
 agency recognized by the Bureau and training programs approved but not necessarily sponsored
 by the U.S. Department of Labor, Manpower Administration, Bureau of Apprenticeship and
 Training shall also be considered acceptable provided it is being administered in a manner
 consistent with the equal employment obligations of Federal Aid highway construction contract.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 79
 
 Approval or acceptance of a training schedule shall be obtained from the Department prior to
 commencing work on the classifications covered by the program.
 A voluntary On-The-Job Training Program is available to a Contractor which has been
 awarded a state funded project. Through this program, the Contractor will have the option to train
 employees on state funded projects for “banked credit” as discussed previously in this provision,
 to be utilized on subsequent Federal Aid Projects where training is required. Those Contractors
 availing themselves of this opportunity to train personnel on state funded projects and bank
 trainee hours for credit shall comply with all training criteria set forth in this Section for Federal
 Aid Projects; voluntary banking may be denied by the Department if staff is not available to
 monitor compliance with the training criteria.
 It is the intention of these provisions that training is to be provided in the construction
 crafts rather than clerk-typists or secretarial type positions. Training is permissible in lower level
 management positions such as office engineers, estimators, etc., where the training is oriented
 toward construction applications. Training in the laborer classifications, except Common/General
 Laborer, may be permitted provided that significant and meaningful training is provided and
 approved by the District Contract Compliance Office.
 When approved in advance by the District Contract Compliance Manager, credit will be
 given for training of persons in excess of the number specified herein under the current contract
 or a Contractor will be allowed to bank trainees who have successfully completed a training
 program and may apply those trainees to a training requirement in subsequent project(s) upon
 approval of the Department’s District Contract Compliance Manager. This credit will be given
 even though the Contractor may receive training program funds from other sources, provided
 such other source do not specifically prohibit the Contractor from receiving other form of
 compensation. Offsite training is permissible as long as the training is an integral part of an
 approved training program and does not compromise a significant part of the overall training.
 Credit for offsite training indicated above may only be made to the Contractor when it does one
 or more of the following and the trainees are concurrently employed on a Federal Aid Project:
 1. Contributes to the cost of the training,
 2. Provides the instruction to the trainee,
 3. Pays the trainee’s wages during the offsite training period.
 The Contractor shall compensate the trainee at no less than the laborer rate established in
 the Contract at the onset of training. The compensation rate will be increased to the journeyman’s
 wage upon graduation from the training program for the remainder of the time the trainee works
 in the classification in which they were trained.
 The Contractor shall furnish the trainee a copy of the program they will follow in
 providing the training. The Contractor shall provide each trainee with a certification showing the
 type and length of training satisfactorily completed. The Contractor shall enroll a trainee in one
 training classification at a time to completion before the trainee can be enrolled in another
 classification on the same project.
 The Contractor shall maintain records to document the actual hours each trainee is
 engaged in training on work being performed as a part of this Contract.
 The Contractor shall submit to the District Contract Compliance Manager a copy of an
 On-The-Job Training Notification of Personnel Action form no later than seven days after the
 effective date of the action when the following actions occur: a trainee is transferred on the
 project, transferred from the project to continue training on another contract, completes training,
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 80
 
 is upgraded to journeyman status or voluntary terminates or is involuntary terminated from the
 project.
 The Contractor shall furnish to the District Contract Compliance Manager a copy of a
 Monthly Time Report for each trainee. The Monthly Time Report for each month shall be
 submitted no later than the tenth day of the subsequent month. The Monthly Time Report shall
 indicate the phases and sub-phases of the number of hours devoted to each proficiency.
 Highway or Bridge Carpenter Helper, Mechanic Helper, Rodman/Chainman, and
 Timekeeper classifications will not be approved for the On-The-Job Training Program.
 The number of trainees may be distributed among the work classifications on the basis of
 the Contractor’s needs and the availability of journeymen in the various classifications within a
 reasonable area of recruitment.
 The Contractor will have fulfilled the responsibilities of this Specification when
 acceptable training has been provided to the trainee as specified above.
 7-26 Cargo Preference Act – Use of United States-Flag Vessels.
 Pursuant to Title 46 CFR 381, the Contractor agrees
 1. To utilize privately owned United States-flag commercial vessels to ship at
 least 50 percent of the gross tonnage (computed separately for dry bulk carriers, dry cargo liners,
 and tankers) involved, whenever shipping any equipment, material, or commodities pursuant to
 this Contract, to the extent such vessels are available at fair and reasonable rates for United
 States-flag commercial vessels.
 2. To furnish within 20 days following the date of loading for shipments
 originating within the United States or within 30 working days following the date of loading for
 shipments originating outside the United States, a legible copy of a rated, ‘on-board’ commercial
 ocean bill-of-lading in English for each shipment of cargo described in paragraph 1 of this
 Article to both the Contracting Officer (through the prime contractor in the case of subcontractor
 bills-of-lading) and to the Division of National Cargo, Office of Market Development, Maritime
 Administration, Washington, DC 20590.
 3. To insert the substance of the provisions of this clause in all subcontracts issued
 pursuant to this Contract.

 SECTION 8
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 8-1 Subletting or Assigning of Contracts.
 Do not, sell, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of the Contract or Contracts or any
 portion thereof, or of the right, title, or interest therein, without written consent of the
 Department. If the Contractor chooses to sublet any portion of the Contract, the Contractor must
 submit a written request to sublet work on the Certification of Sublet Work form developed by
 the Department for this purpose. With the Engineer’s acceptance of the request, the Contractor
 may sublet a portion of the work, but shall perform with its own organization work amounting to
 not less than 40% of the total Contract amount. The Certification of Sublet Work request will be
 deemed acceptable by the Department, for purposes of the Department’s consent, unless the
 Engineer notifies the Contractor within 5 business days of receipt of the Certification of Sublet
 Work that the Department is not consenting to the requested subletting.
 Include in the total Contract amount the cost of materials and manufactured component
 products, and their transportation to the project site. For the purpose of meeting this requirement
 the Department will not consider off-site commercial production of materials and manufactured
 component products that the Contractor purchases, or their transportation to the project, as
 subcontracted work.
 If the Contractor sublets a part of a Contract item, the Department will use only the sublet
 proportional cost in determining the percentage of subcontracted normal work.
 Execute all agreements to sublet work in writing and include all pertinent provisions and
 requirements of the Contract. All other agreements must be in writing and reference all
 applicable Contract provisions. Upon request, submit to the Department a copy of the
 subcontract and agreement. The subletting of work does not relieve the Contractor or the surety
 of their respective liabilities under the Contract.
 The Department recognizes a subcontractor only in the capacity of an employee or agent
 of the Contractor, and the Engineer may require the Contractor to remove the subcontractor as in
 the case of an employee.
 8-2 Work Performed by Equipment-Rental Agreement.
 The limitations set forth in 8-1, concerning the amount of work that may be sublet, do not
 apply to work performed by equipment-rental agreement. However, for any work proposed to be
 performed by equipment-rental agreement, notify the Engineer in writing of such intention
 before using the rented equipment, and indicate whether the equipment will be rented on an
 operated or non-operated basis. Include with the written notice a listing and description of the
 equipment and a description of the particular work to be performed with such equipment. As an
 exception to the above requirements, the Department will not require written notice for
 equipment to be rented (without operators) from an equipment dealer or from a firm whose
 principal business is the renting or leasing of equipment.
 The operators of all rented equipment, whether rented on an operated or a non-operated
 basis, are subject to all wage rate requirements applicable to the project. When renting equipment
 without operators, the Contractor shall carry the operators on his own payroll. For equipment that
 is rented on an operated basis, and when required by the Contract or requested by the Engineer,
 submit payrolls from the lessor with the names of the operators shown thereon.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 82
 
 When a lessor provides rentals of equipment on an operated basis that exceed $10,000,
 such lessor is subject to any Equal Employment Opportunity requirements that are applicable to
 the project.
 8-3 Prosecution of Work.
 8-3.1 Compliance with Time Requirements: Commence work in accordance with the
 accepted working schedule and provide sufficient labor, materials and equipment to complete the
 work within the time limit(s) set forth in the proposal. Should the Contractor fail to furnish
 sufficient and suitable equipment, forces, and materials, as necessary to prosecute the work in
 accordance with the required schedule, the Engineer may withhold all estimates that are, or may
 become due, or suspend the work until the Contractor corrects such deficiencies.
 8-3.2 Submission of Working Schedule: Within 21 calendar days after Contract award
 or at the preconstruction conference, whichever is earlier, submit to the Engineer a work progress
 schedule for the project. The Engineer will review and respond to the Contractor within
 15 calendar days of receipt.
 Provide a schedule that shows the various activities of work in sufficient detail to
 demonstrate a reasonable and workable plan to complete the project within the Contract Time.
 Show the order and interdependence of activities and the sequence for accomplishing the work.
 Describe all activities in sufficient detail so that the Engineer can readily identify the work and
 measure the progress on of each activity. Show each activity with a beginning work date, a
 duration, and a monetary value. Include activities for procurement fabrication, and delivery of
 materials, plant, and equipment, and review time for shop drawings and submittals. Include
 milestone activities when milestones are required by the Contract Documents. In a project with
 more than one phase, adequately identify each phase and its completion date, and do not allow
 activities to span more than one phase.
 Conduct sufficient liaison and provide sufficient information to indicate
 coordination activities with utility owners that have facilities within the limits of construction
 have been resolved. Incorporate in the schedule any utility adjustment schedules included in the
 Contract Documents unless the utility company and the Department mutually agree to changes to
 the utility schedules shown in the Contract.
 Submit a working plan with the schedule, consisting of a concise written
 description of the construction plan.
 The Engineer will return inadequate schedules to the Contractor for corrections.
 Resubmit a corrected schedule within 15 calendar days from the date of the Engineer’s return
 transmittal.
 Submit an updated Work Progress Schedule, for Engineer’s acceptance, if there is
 a significant change in the planned order or duration of an activity. The Engineer will review the
 corrected schedule and respond within 7 calendar days of receipt.
 By acceptance of the schedule, the Engineer does not endorse or otherwise certify
 the validity or accuracy of the activity durations or sequencing of activities. The Engineer will
 use the accepted schedule as the baseline against which to measure the progress.
 If the Contractor fails to finalize either the initial or a revised schedule in the time
 specified, the Engineer will withhold all Contract payments until the Engineer accepts the
 schedule.
 8-3.3 Beginning Work: Notify the Engineer not less than five days in advance of the
 planned start day of work. Upon the receipt of such notice, the Engineer may give the Contractor
 Notice to Proceed and may designate the point or points to start the work. In the Notice to
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 83
 
 Proceed, the Engineer may waive the five day advance notice and authorize the Contractor to
 begin immediately. Notify the Engineer in writing at least two days in advance of the starting
 date of important features of the work. Do not commence work under the Contract until after the
 Department has issued the Notice to Proceed. The Department will issue the Notice to Proceed
 within 20 calendar days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays, after execution of the
 Contract.
 8-3.4 Provisions for Convenience of Public: Schedule construction operations so as to
 minimize any inconvenience to adjacent businesses or residences. Where necessary, the Engineer
 may require the Contractor to first construct the work in any areas along the project where
 inconveniences caused by construction operations would present a more serious handicap. In
 such critical locations, where there is no assurance of continuous effective prosecution of the
 work once the construction operations are begun, the Engineer may require the Contractor to
 delay removal of the existing (usable) facilities.
 8-3.5 Preconstruction Conference: Immediately after awarding the Contract but before
 the Contractor begins work, the Engineer will call a preconstruction conference at a place the
 Engineer designates to go over the construction aspects of the project. Attend this meeting, along
 with the Department and the various utility companies that will be involved with the road
 construction.
 8-4 Limitations of Operations.
 8-4.1 Night Work: During active nighttime operations, furnish, place and maintain
 lighting sufficient to permit proper workmanship and inspection. Use lighting with 5 ft-cd
 minimum intensity. Arrange the lighting to prevent interference with traffic or produce undue
 glare to property owners. Operate such lighting only during active nighttime construction
 activities. Provide a light meter to demonstrate that the minimum light intensity is being
 maintained.
 Lighting may be accomplished by the use of portable floodlights, standard
 equipment lights, existing street lights, temporary street lights, or other lighting methods
 approved by the Engineer.
 Submit a lighting plan at the Preconstruction Conference for review and
 acceptance by the Engineer. Submit the plan as a PDF file, in the same scale as the Contract
 Plans, and formatted on 11 inch by 17 inch sheets. Do not start night work prior to the Engineer’s
 acceptance of the lighting plan.
 During active nighttime operations, furnish, place and maintain variable message
 signs to alert approaching motorists of lighted construction zones ahead. Operate the variable
 message signs only during active construction activities.
 Include compensation for lighting for night work in the Contract prices for the
 various items of the Contract. Take ownership of all lighting equipment for night work.
 8-4.2 Sequence of Operations: Do not open up work to the prejudice of work already
 started. The Engineer may require the Contractor to finish a section on which work is in progress
 before starting work on any additional section.
 8-4.3 Interference with Traffic: At all times conduct the work in such manner and in
 such sequence as to ensure the least practicable interference with traffic. Operate all vehicles and
 other equipment safely and without hindrance to the traveling public. Park all private vehicles
 outside the clear zone. Place materials stored along the roadway so as to cause no obstruction to
 the traveling public as possible.

 Where existing pavement is to be widened and stabilizing is not required, prevent
 any open trench from remaining after working hours by scheduling operations to place the full
 thickness of widened base by the end of each day. Do not construct widening strips
 simultaneously on both sides of the road, except where separated by a distance of at least
 1/4 mile along the road and where either the work of excavation has not been started or the base
 has been completed.
 8-4.4 Coordination with other Contractors: Sequence the work and dispose of
 materials so as not to interfere with the operations of other Contractors engaged upon adjacent
 work; join the work to that of others in a proper manner, in accordance with the spirit of the
 Contract Documents; and perform the work in the proper sequence in relation to that of other
 contractors; all as may be directed by the Engineer.
 Each contractor is responsible for any damage done by him or his agents to the
 work performed by another contractor.
 8-4.5 Drainage: Conduct the operations and maintain the work in such condition to
 provide adequate drainage at all times. Do not obstruct existing functioning storm sewers,
 gutters, ditches, and other run-off facilities.
 8-4.6 Fire Hydrants: Keep fire hydrants on or adjacent to the highway accessible to fire
 apparatus at all times, and do not place any material or obstruction within 15 feet of any fire
 hydrant.
 8-4.7 Protection of Structures: Do not operate heavy equipment close enough to pipe
 headwalls or other structures to cause their displacement.
 8-4.8 Fencing: Erect permanent fence as a first order of business on all projects that
 include fencing where the Engineer determines that the fencing is necessary to maintain the
 security of livestock on adjacent property, or for protection of pedestrians who are likely to gain
 access to the project from adjacent property.
 8-4.9 Contaminated Materials: When the construction operations encounter or expose
 any abnormal condition that may indicate the presence of a contaminated material, discontinue
 such operations in the vicinity of the abnormal condition and notify the Engineer immediately.
 Be alert for the presence of tanks or barrels; discolored or stained earth, metal, wood, ground
 water; visible fumes; abnormal odors; excessively hot earth; smoke; or other conditions that
 appear abnormal as possible indicators of the presence of contaminated materials. Treat these
 conditions with extraordinary caution.
 Make every effort to minimize the spread of any contaminated materials into
 uncontaminated areas.
 Do not resume the construction operations in the vicinity of the abnormal
 conditions until so directed by the Engineer.
 Dispose of the contaminated material in accordance with the requirements and
 regulations of any Local, State, or Federal agency having jurisdiction. Where the Contractor
 performs work necessary to dispose of contaminated material, and the Contract does not include
 pay items for disposal, the Department will pay for this work as provided in 4-4.
 The Department agrees to hold harmless and indemnify the Contractor for
 damages when the Contractor discovers or encounters contaminated materials or pollutants
 during the performance of services for the Department when the presence of such materials or
 pollutants were unknown or not reasonably discoverable. Such indemnification agreement is
 only effective if the Contractor immediately stops work and notifies the Department of the
 contaminated material or pollutant problem.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 85
 
 Such indemnification agreement is not valid for damages resulting from the
 Contractor’s willful, wanton, or intentional conduct or the operations of Contaminated and
 Hazardous Material Contractors.
 8-5 Qualifications of Contractor’s Personnel.
 Provide competent, careful, and reliable superintendents, foremen, and workmen. Provide
 workmen with sufficient skill and experience to properly perform the work assigned to them.
 Provide workmen engaged on special work, or skilled work, such as bituminous courses or
 mixtures, concrete bases, pavements, or structures, or in any trade, with sufficient experience in
 such work to perform it properly and satisfactorily and to operate the equipment involved.
 Provide workmen that shall make due and proper effort to execute the work in the manner
 prescribed in the Contract Documents, or the Engineer may take action as prescribed below.
 It is prohibited as a conflict of interest for a Contractor to subcontract with a Consultant
 to perform Contractor Quality Control when the Consultant is under contract with the
 Department to perform work on any project described in the Contractor’s Contract with the
 Department. Prior to approving a Consultant for Contractor Quality Control, the Contractor shall
 submit to the Department a Certificate from the proposed Consultant certifying that no conflict
 of interest exists.
 Whenever the Engineer determines that any person employed by the Contractor is
 incompetent, unfaithful, intemperate, disorderly, or insubordinate, the Engineer will provide
 written notice and the Contractor shall discharge the person from the work. Do not employ any
 discharged person on the project without the written consent of the Engineer. If the Contractor
 fails to remove such person or persons, the Engineer may withhold all estimates that are or may
 become due, or suspend the work until the Contractor complies with such orders. Protect, defend,
 indemnify, and hold the Department, its agents, officials, and employees harmless from all
 claims, actions, or suite arising from such removal, discharge, or suspension of employees.
 8-6 Temporary Suspension of Contractor’s Operations.
 8-6.1 Authority to Suspend Contractor’s Operations: The Engineer has the authority
 to suspend the Contractor’s operations, wholly or in part. The Engineer will order such
 suspension in writing, giving in detail the reasons for the suspension. Contract Time will be
 charged during all suspensions of Contractor’s operations. The Department may grant an
 extension of Contract Time in accordance with 8-7.3.2 when determined appropriate in the
 Department’s sole judgment.
 No additional compensation or time extension will be paid or granted to the
 Contractor when the operations are suspended for the following reasons:
 1. The Contractor fails to comply with the Contract Documents.
 2. The Contractor fails to carry out orders given by the Engineer.
 3. The Contractor causes conditions considered unfavorable for continuing
 the Work.
 Immediately comply with any suspension order. Do not resume operations until
 authorized to do so by the Engineer in writing. Any operations performed by the Contractor, and
 otherwise constructed in conformance with the provisions of the Contract, after the issuance of
 the suspension order and prior to the Engineer’s authorization to resume operations will be at no
 cost to the Department. Further, failure to immediately comply with any suspension order will
 also constitute an act of default by the Contractor and is deemed sufficient basis in and of itself
 for the Department to declare the Contractor in default, in accordance with 8-9, with the
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 86
 
 exception that the Contractor will not have ten calendar days to correct the conditions for which
 the suspension was ordered.
 8-6.1.1 State of Emergency: The Engineer has the authority to suspend the
 Contractor’s operations, wholly or in part, pursuant to a Governor’s Declaration of a State of
 Emergency. The Engineer will order such suspension in writing, giving in detail the reasons for
 the suspension. Contract Time will be charged during all suspensions of Contractor’s operations.
 The Department, at its sole discretion, may grant an extension of Contract Time and reimburse
 the Contractor for specific costs associated with such suspension. Further, in such instances, the
 Department’s determination as to entitlement to either time or compensability will be final,
 unless the Contractor can prove by clear and convincing evidence to a Disputes Review Board
 that the Department’s determination was without any reasonable factual basis
 8-6.2 Prolonged Suspensions: If the Engineer suspends the Contractor’s operations for
 an indefinite period, store all materials in such manner that they will not obstruct or impede the
 traveling public unnecessarily or become damaged in any way. Take every reasonable precaution
 to prevent damage to or deterioration of the work performed. Provide suitable drainage of the
 roadway by opening ditches, shoulder drains, etc., and provide any temporary structures
 necessary for public travel through the project.
 8-6.3 Permission to Suspend Contractor’s Operations: Do not suspend operations or
 remove equipment or materials necessary for completing the work without obtaining the
 Engineer’s written permission. Submit all requests for suspension of operations in writing to the
 Engineer, and identify specific dates to begin and end the suspension. The Contractor is not
 entitled to any additional compensation for suspension of operations during such periods.
 8-6.4 Suspension of Contractor’s Operations - Holidays and Special Events: Unless
 the Contractor submits a written request to work during one or more days of a Holiday or Special
 Event at least ten calendar days in advance of the beginning date of the Holiday or Special Event
 and receives written approval from the Engineer, the Contractor shall not work on the following
 days: Martin Luther King, Jr. Day; Memorial Day; the Saturday and Sunday immediately
 preceding Memorial Day; Independence Day; Independence Day (Observed); Labor Day; the
 Friday, Saturday, and Sunday immediately preceding Labor Day; Veterans Day; Veterans Day
 (Observed); the Wednesday immediately preceding Thanksgiving Day; Thanksgiving Day; the
 Friday, Saturday and Sunday immediately following Thanksgiving Day; December 24 through
 January 2, inclusive; and Special Events noted in the Plans. Contract Time will be charged
 during these Holiday and Special Event periods. Contract Time will be adjusted in accordance
 with 8-7.3.2. The Contractor is not entitled to any additional compensation beyond any allowed
 Contract Time adjustment for suspension of operations during such Holiday and Special Event
 periods.
 During such suspensions, remove all equipment and materials from the clear
 zone, except those required for the safety of the traveling public and retain sufficient personnel at
 the job site to properly meet the requirements of Sections 102 and 104. The Contractor is not
 entitled to any additional compensation for removal of equipment from clear zones or for
 compliance with Section 102 and Section 104 during such Holiday and Special Event periods.
 8-7 Computation of Contract Time.
 8-7.1 General: Perform the contracted work fully, entirely, and in accordance with the
 Contract Documents within the Contract Time specified in the proposal, or as may be extended
 in accordance with the provisions herein below.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 87
 
 The Department considers in the computation of the Contract Time the effect that
 utility relocation and adjustments have on job progress and the scheduling of construction
 operations required in order to adequately maintain traffic, as detailed in the Plans or as
 scheduled in the Special Provisions.
 8-7.2 Date of Beginning of Contract Time: The date on which Contract Time begins is
 either the date on which the Contractor actually begins work, or the date for beginning the
 charging of Contract Time as set forth in the proposal; whichever is earlier.
 8-7.3 Adjusting Contract Time:
 8-7.3.1 Increased Work: The Department may grant an extension of Contract
 Time when it increases the Contract amount due to overruns in original Contract items, adds new
 work items, or provides for unforeseen work. The Department will base the consideration for
 granting an extension of Contract Time on the extent that the time normally required to complete
 the additional designated work delays the Contract completion schedule.
 8-7.3.2 Contract Time Extensions: The Department may grant an extension of
 Contract Time when a controlling item of work is delayed by factors not reasonably anticipated
 or foreseeable at the time of bid. The Department may allow such extension of time only for
 delays occurring during the Contract Time period or authorized extensions of the Contract Time
 period. When failure by the Department to fulfill an obligation under the Contract results in
 delays to the controlling items of work, the Department will consider such delays as a basis for
 granting a time extension to the Contract.
 Whenever the Engineer suspends the Contractor’s operations, as provided
 in 8-6, for reasons other than the fault of the Contractor, the Engineer will grant a time extension
 for any delay to a controlling item of work due to such suspension. The Department will not
 grant time extensions to the Contract for delays due to the fault or negligence of the Contractor.
 The Department does not include an allowance for delays caused by the
 effects of inclement weather or suspension of Contractor’s operations as defined in 8-6.4, in
 establishing Contract Time. The Engineer will continually monitor the effects of weather and,
 when found justified, grant time extensions on either a bimonthly or monthly basis. The Engineer
 will not require the Contractor to submit a request for additional time due to the effects of
 weather.
 The Department will grant time extensions, on a day for day basis, for
 delays caused by the effects of rains or other inclement weather conditions, related adverse soil
 conditions or suspension of operations as defined in 8-6.4 that prevent the Contractor from
 productively performing controlling items of work resulting in:
 1. The Contractor being unable to work at least 50% of the normal
 work day on pre-determined controlling work items; or
 2. The Contractor must make major repairs to work damaged by
 weather, provided that the damage is not attributable to the Contractor’s failure to perform or
 neglect; and provided that the Contractor was unable to work at least 50% of the normal workday
 on pre-determined controlling work items.
 No additional compensation will be made for delays caused by the effects
 of inclement weather.
 The Department will consider the delays in delivery of materials or
 component equipment that affect progress on a controlling item of work as a basis for granting a
 time extension if such delays are beyond the control of the Contractor or supplier. Such delays
 may include an area-wide shortage, an industry-wide strike, or a natural disaster that affects all
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 88
 
 feasible sources of supply. In such cases, the Contractor shall submit substantiating letters from a
 representative number of manufacturers of such materials or equipment clearly confirming that
 the delays in delivery were the result of an area-wide shortage, an industry-wide strike, etc. No
 additional compensation will be made for delays caused by delivery of materials or component
 equipment.
 The Department will not consider requests for time extension due to delay
 in the delivery of custom manufactured equipment such as traffic signal equipment, highway
 lighting equipment, etc., unless the Contractor submits documentation that he placed the order
 for such equipment in a timely manner, the delay was caused by factors beyond the
 manufacturer’s control, and the lack of such equipment caused a delay in progress on a
 controlling item of work. No additional compensation will be paid for delays caused by delivery
 of custom manufactured equipment.
 The Department will consider the effect of utility relocation and
 adjustment work on job progress as the basis for granting a time extension only if all the
 following criteria are met:
 1. Delays are the result of either utility work that was not detailed
 in the Plans, or utility work that was detailed in the Plans but was not accomplished in
 reasonably close accordance with the schedule included in the Contract Documents.
 2. Utility work actually affected progress toward completion of
 controlling work items.
 3. The Contractor took all reasonable measures to minimize the
 effect of utility work on job progress, including cooperative scheduling of the Contractor’s
 operations with the scheduled utility work at the preconstruction conference and providing
 adequate advance notification to utility companies as to the dates to coordinate their operations
 with the Contractor’s operations to avoid delays.
 As a condition precedent to an extension of Contract Time the Contractor
 must submit to the Engineer:
 A preliminary request for an extension of Contract Time must be
 submitted in writing to the Engineer within ten calendar days after the commencement of a delay
 to a controlling item of work. If the Contractor fails to submit this required preliminary request
 for an extension of Contract Time, the Contractor fully, completely, absolutely and irrevocably
 waives any entitlement to an extension of Contract Time for that delay. In the case of a
 continuing delay only a single preliminary request for an extension of Contract Time will be
 required. Each such preliminary request for an extension of Contract Time shall include as a
 minimum the commencement date of the delay, the cause of the delay, and the controlling item
 of work affected by the delay.
 Furthermore, the Contractor must submit to the Engineer a request
 for a Contract Time extension in writing within 30 days after the elimination of the delay to the
 controlling item of work identified in the preliminary request for an extension of Contract Time.
 Each request for a Contract Time extension shall include as a minimum all documentation that
 the Contractor wishes the Department to consider related to the delay, and the exact number of
 days requested to be added to Contract Time. If the Contractor contends that the delay is
 compensable, then the Contractor shall also be required to submit with the request for a Contract
 Time extension a detailed cost analysis of the requested additional compensation. If the
 Contractor fails to submit this required request for a Contract Time extension, with or without a
 detailed cost analysis, depriving the Engineer of the timely opportunity to verify the delay and
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 89
 
 the costs of the delay, the Contractor waives any entitlement to an extension of Contract Time or
 additional compensation for the delay.
 Upon timely receipt of the preliminary request of Contract Time from the
 Contractor, the Engineer will investigate the conditions, and if it is determined that a controlling
 item of work is being delayed for reasons beyond the control of the Contractor the Engineer will
 take appropriate action to mitigate the delay and the costs of the delay. Upon timely receipt of
 the request for a Contract Time extension the Engineer will further investigate the conditions,
 and if it is determined that there was an increase in the time or the cost of performance of the
 controlling item of work beyond the control of the Contractor, then an adjustment of Contract
 Time will be made, and a monetary adjustment will be made, excluding loss of anticipated
 profits, and the Contract will be modified in writing accordingly.
 The existence of an accepted schedule, including any required update(s),
 as stated in 8-3.2, is a condition precedent to the Contractor having any right to the granting of an
 extension of Contract Time or any monetary compensation arising out of any delay. Contractor
 failure to have an accepted schedule, including any required update(s), for the period of potential
 impact, or in the event the currently accepted schedule and applicable updates do not accurately
 reflect the actual status of the project or fail to accurately show the true controlling or noncontrolling work activities for the period of potential impact, will result in any entitlement
 determination as to time or money for such period of potential impact being limited solely to the
 Department’s analysis and identification of the actual controlling or non-controlling work
 activities. Further, in such instances, the Department’s determination as to entitlement as to
 either time or compensability will be final, unless the Contractor can prove by clear and
 convincing evidence to a Disputes Review Board that the Department’s determination was
 without any reasonable factual basis.
 8-8 Failure of Contractor to Maintain Satisfactory Progress.
 8-8.1 General: Pursue the work to completion: Section 337.16 of the Florida Statutes
 establishes certain requirements pertaining to the suspension or revocation of a Contractor’s
 Certificate of Qualification because of delinquency on a previously awarded Contract.
 8-8.2 Regulations Governing Suspension for Delinquency:
 1. A Contractor is delinquent when the Contract Time for performing the work
 has expired, and the Contractor has not completed the Contract work.
 2. Once the Department determines that the Contractor is delinquent, the
 Department will give the Contractor written notice of intent to suspend the Contractor’s
 Certificate of Qualification. If the Contractor disagrees with the delinquency, the Contractor shall
 file a request for an administrative hearing with the Clerk of Agency Proceedings within ten days
 of receipt of the notice of intent to suspend. If the Contractor does not file a request, the
 Department will make the suspension conclusive and final. The request for hearing is filed when
 the Contractor delivers it to, and it is received by, the Clerk of Agency Proceedings, Mail
 Station 58, Room 562, Haydon Burns Building, 605 Suwannee Street, Tallahassee, Florida
 32399-0450.
 3. If the Contractor files a request for a hearing, the Department will schedule the
 hearing within 30 days of the hearing officer’s receipt of the request.
 4. The Department will continue the period of suspension of the Contractor’s
 Certificate of Qualification until the Contractor is no longer delinquent. If the Contractor
 requests an administrative hearing, the Department's final order, depending on the outcome of
 the hearing, will set forth the time period of suspension for the number of days the Department
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 90
 
 determines that the Contractor was delinquent, even if the Contractor cures the delinquency
 during the pendency of the administrative proceedings.
 5. During the period of suspension of the Contractor’s Certificate of Qualification,
 the Department will not allow the Contractor and its affiliates to bid on any Department
 Contract, regardless of dollar amount, and will not approve the Contractor as a subcontractor on
 any Department contract.
 6. The Department may grant extensions of time during the prosecution of the
 work as allowed under these Specifications regardless of the Contractor’s delinquency status.
 8-9 Default and Termination of Contract.
 8-9.1 Determination of Default: The following acts or omissions constitute acts of
 default and, except as to subparagraphs 9 and 11, the Department will give notice, in writing, to
 the Contractor and his surety for any delay, neglect or default, if the Contractor:
 1. fails to begin the work under the Contract within the time specified in the
 Notice to Proceed;
 2. fails to perform the work with sufficient workmen and equipment or with
 sufficient materials to ensure prompt completion of the Contract;
 3. performs the work unsuitably, or neglects or refuses to remove materials or to
 perform anew such work that the Engineer rejects as unacceptable and unsuitable;
 4. discontinues the prosecution of the work, or fails to resume discontinued work
 within a reasonable time after the Engineer notifies the Contractor to do so;
 5. becomes insolvent or is declared bankrupt, or files for reorganization under the
 bankruptcy code, or commits any act of bankruptcy or insolvency, either voluntarily or
 involuntarily;
 6. allows any final judgment to stand against him unsatisfied for a period of ten
 calendar days;
 7. makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors;
 8. fails to comply with Contract requirements regarding minimum wage payments
 or EEO requirements;
 9. fails to comply with the Engineer’s written suspension of work order within the
 time allowed for compliance and which time is stated in that suspension of work order; or
 10. for any other cause whatsoever, fails to carry on the work in an acceptable
 manner, or if the surety executing the bond, for any reasonable cause, becomes unsatisfactory in
 the opinion of the Department.
 11. fails to comply with 3-9.
 For a notice based upon reasons stated in subparagraphs (1) through (8) and (10):
 if the Contractor, within a period of ten calendar days after receiving the notice described above,
 fails to correct the conditions of which complaint is made, the Department will, upon written
 certificate from the Engineer of the fact of such delay, neglect, or default and the Contractor’s
 failure to correct such conditions, have full power and authority, without violating the Contract,
 to take the prosecution of the work out of the hands of the Contractor and to declare the
 Contractor in default.
 If the Contractor, after having received a prior notice described above for any
 reason stated in subparagraph (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) or (8), commits a second or subsequent act of
 default for any reason covered by the same subparagraph (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) or (8) as stated in
 the prior notice, and regardless whether the specific reason is the same, then, regardless of
 whether the Contractor has cured the deficiency stated in that prior notice, the Department will,
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 91
 
 upon written certificate from the Engineer of the fact of such delay, neglect or default and the
 Contractor’s failure to correct such conditions, have full power and authority, without any prior
 written notice to the Contractor and without violating the Contract, to take the prosecution of the
 work out of the hands of the Contractor and to declare the Contractor in default.
 Regarding subparagraph (9), if the Contractor fails to comply with the Engineer’s
 written suspension of work order within the time allowed for compliance and which time is
 stated in that suspension of work order, the Department will, upon written certificate from the
 Engineer of the fact of such delay and the Contractor’s failure to correct that condition, have full
 power and authority, without violating the Contract, to immediately take the prosecution of the
 work out of the hands of the Contractor and to declare the Contractor in default.
 Regarding subparagraph (11), if the Contractor fails to comply with 3-9, the
 Department will have full power and authority, without violating the Contract, to immediately
 take the prosecution of the work out of the hands of the Contractor and to declare the Contractor
 in default.
 The Department has no liability for anticipated profits for unfinished work on a
 Contract that the Department has determined to be in default.
 Notwithstanding the above, the Department shall have the right to declare the
 Contractor (or its “affiliate”) in default and immediately terminate this Contract, without any
 prior notice to the Contractor, in the event the Contractor (or its “affiliate”) is at any time
 “convicted” of a “contract crime,” as these terms are defined in Section 337.165(1), Florida
 Statutes. The Department’s right to default the Contractor (or its “affiliate”) for “conviction” of a
 “contract crime” shall extend to and is expressly applicable to any and all Department Contracts
 that were either advertised for bid; for which requests for proposals or letters of interest were
 requested; for which an intent to award was posted or otherwise issued; or for which a Contract
 was entered into, after the date that the underlying or related criminal indictment, criminal
 information or other criminal charge was filed against the Contractor (or its “affiliate”) that
 resulted in the “conviction.” In the event the Department terminates this Contract for this reason,
 the Contractor shall hereby forfeit any claims for additional compensation, extra time, or
 anticipated profits. The Contractor shall only be paid for any completed work up to the date of
 termination. Further, the Contractor shall be liable for any and all additional costs and expenses
 the Department incurs in completing the Contract work after such termination.
 8-9.2 Termination of Contract for Convenience: The Department may terminate the
 entire Contract or any portion thereof, if the Secretary determines that a termination is in the
 Department’s interest. The Secretary will deliver to the Contractor a Written Notice of
 Termination specifying the extent of termination and the effective date.
 When the Department terminates the entire Contract, or any portion thereof,
 before the Contractor completes all items of work in the Contract, the Department will make
 payment for the actual number of units or items of work that the Contractor has completed, at the
 Contract unit price, and according to the formulas and provisions set forth in 4-3.2 for items of
 work partially completed, and such payments will constitute full and complete compensation for
 such work or items. No payment of any kind or amount will be made for items of work not
 started. The Department will not consider any claim for loss of anticipated profits, or overhead of
 any kind (including home office and jobsite overhead or other indirect impacts) except as
 provided in 4-3.2 for partially completed work.
 The Department will consider reimbursing the Contractor for actual cost of
 mobilization (when not otherwise included in the Contract) including moving equipment to the
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 92
 
 job where the volume of the work that the Contractor has completed is too small to compensate
 the Contractor for these expenses under the Contract unit prices.
 The Department may purchase at actual cost acceptable materials and supplies
 procured for the work, that the Department has inspected, tested, and approved and that the
 Contractor has not incorporated in the work. Submit the proof of actual cost, as shown by
 receipted bills and actual cost records, at such points of delivery as the Engineer may designate.
 Termination of a contract or a portion thereof, under the provisions of this
 Subarticle, does not relieve the Contractor or the surety of its responsibilities for the completed
 portion of the Contract or its obligations for and concerning any just claims arising out of the
 work performed.
 All Contractor claims for additional payment, due to the Department’s
 termination of the entire Contract or any portion thereof, must meet the requirements of 5-12.
 8-9.3 Completion of Work by Department: Upon declaration of default, the
 Department will have full authority to appropriate or use any or all suitable and acceptable
 materials and equipment on the site and may enter into an agreement with others to complete the
 work under the Contract, or may use other methods to complete the work in an acceptable
 manner. The Department will charge all costs that the Department incurs because of the
 Contractor’s default, including the costs of completing the work under the Contract, against the
 Contractor. If the Department incurs such costs in an amount that exceeds the sum that would
 have been payable under the Contract, then the Contractor and the surety shall be liable and shall
 pay the Department the amount of the excess.
 If, after the ten day notice period and prior to any action by the Department to
 otherwise complete the work under the Contract, the Contractor establishes his intent to
 prosecute the work in accordance with the Department’s requirements, then the Department may
 allow the Contractor to resume the work, in which case the Department will deduct from any
 monies due or that may become due under the Contract, any costs to the Department incurred by
 the delay, or from any reason attributable to the delay.
 8-10 Liquidated Damages for Failure to Complete the Work.
 8-10.1 Highway Code Requirements Pertaining to Liquidated Damages:
 Section 337.18, paragraph (2) of the Florida Statutes, requires that the Department adopt
 regulations for the determination of default and provides that the Contractor pay liquidated
 damages to the Department for any failure of the Contractor to complete the Contract work
 within the Contract Time. These Code requirements govern, and are herewith made a part of the
 Contract.
 8-10.2 Amount of Liquidated Damages: Applicable liquidated damages are the
 amounts established in the following schedule:
 Original Contract Amount Daily Charge Per Calendar Day
 $50,000 and under ..........................................................$956
 Over $50,000 but less than $250,000.............................$964
 $250,000 but less than $500,000.................................$1,241
 $500,000 but less than $2,500,000..............................$1,665
 $2,500,000 but less than $5,000,000...........................$2,712
 $5,000,000 but less than $10,000,000.........................$3,447
 $10,000,000 but less than $15,000,000.......................$4,866

 93
 
 $20,000,000 and over ................ $9,198 plus 0.00005 of any
 amount over $20 million (Round to nearest whole dollar)
 8-10.3 Determination of Number of Days of Default: For all contracts, regardless of
 whether the Contract Time is stipulated in calendar days or working days, the Engineer will
 count default days in calendar days.
 8-10.4 Conditions under which Liquidated Damages are Imposed: If the Contractor
 or, in case of his default, the surety fails to complete the work within the time stipulated in the
 Contract, or within such extra time that the Department may have granted then the Contractor or,
 in case of his default, the surety shall pay to the Department, not as a penalty, but as liquidated
 damages, the amount so due as determined by the Code requirements, as provided in 8-10.2.
 8-10.5 Right of Collection: The Department has the right to apply, as payment on such
 liquidated damages, any money the Department owes the Contractor.
 8-10.6 Allowing Contractor to Finish Work: The Department does not waive its right
 to liquidated damages due under the Contract by allowing the Contractor to continue and to
 finish the work, or any part of it, after the expiration of the Contract Time.
 8-10.7 Completion of Work by Department: In the case of a default of the Contract and
 the completion of the work by the Department, the Contractor and his surety are liable for the
 liquidated damages under the Contract, but the Department will not charge liquidated damages
 for any delay in the final completion of the Department’s performance of the work due to any
 unreasonable action or delay on the part of the Department.
 8-11 Release of Contractor’s Responsibility.
 The Department considers the Contract complete when the Contractor has completed all
 work and the Department has accepted the work. The Department will then release the
 Contractor from further obligation except as set forth in his bond, and except as provided in 5-13.
 8-12 Recovery of Damages Suffered by Third Parties.
 In addition to the damages provided for in 8-10.2 and pursuant to Section 337.18 of the
 Florida Statutes, when the Contractor fails to complete the work within the Contract Time the
 Department may recover from the Contractor amounts that the Department pays for damages
 suffered by third parties unless the failure to timely complete the work was caused by the
 Department’s act or omission.

 SECTION 9
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 9-1 Measurement of Quantities.
 9-1.1 Measurement Standards: The Engineer will measure all work completed under
 the Contract in accordance with the United States Standard Measures.
 9-1.2 Method of Measurements: The Engineer will take all measurements horizontally
 or vertically.
 9-1.3 Determination of Pay Areas:
 9-1.3.1 Final Calculation: When measuring items paid for on the basis of area of
 finished work, where the pay quantity is designated to be determined by calculation, the
 Engineer will use lengths and widths in the calculations based on the station to station
 dimensions shown in the Plans; the station to station dimensions actually constructed within the
 limits designated by the Engineer; or the final dimensions measured along the surface of the
 completed work within the neat lines shown in the Plans or designated by the Engineer. The
 Engineer will use the method or combination of methods of measurement that reflect, with
 reasonable accuracy, the actual surface area of the finished work as the Engineer determines.
 9-1.3.2 Plan Quantity: When measuring items paid for on the basis of area of
 finished work, where the pay quantity is designated to be the plan quantity, the Engineer will
 determine the final pay quantity based on the plan quantity subject to the provisions of 9-3.2.
 Generally, the Engineer will calculate the plan quantity using lengths based on station to station
 dimensions and widths based on neat lines shown in the Plans.
 9-1.4 Construction Outside Authorized Limits: The Engineer will not pay for surfaces
 constructed over a greater area than authorized, or for material that the Contractor has moved
 from outside of slope stakes and lines shown in the Plans, except where the Engineer provides
 written instruction for the Contractor to perform such work.
 9-1.5 Truck Requirements: Provide all trucks with numbers and certify that all trucks
 used have a manufacturer’s certification or permanent decal showing the truck capacity rounded
 to the nearest tenth of a cubic yard placed on both sides of the truck. This capacity will include
 the truck body only and any side boards added will not be included in the certified truck body
 capacity. Ensure the lettering and numbers are legible for identification purposes at all times.
 9-1.6 Ladders and Instrument Stands for Bridge Projects: On bridge projects, in
 order to facilitate necessary measurements, provide substantial ladders to the tops of piers and
 bents, and place and move such ladders as the Engineer directs.
 For bridge projects crossing water or marshy areas, supply fixed stands for
 instrument mounting and measurements, in accordance with the details stipulated in the
 Specifications for the project.
 9-2 Scope of Payments.
 9-2.1 Items Included in Payment: Accept the compensation as provided in the Contract
 as full payment for furnishing all materials and for performing all work contemplated and
 embraced under the Contract; also for all loss or damage arising out of the nature of the work or
 from the action of the elements, or from any unforeseen difficulties or obstructions which may
 arise or be encountered in the prosecution of the work until its final acceptance; also for all other
 costs incurred under the provisions of Division I.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 95
 
 For any item of work contained in the proposal, except as might be specifically
 provided otherwise in the basis of payment clause for the item, include in the Contract unit price
 (or lump sum price) for the pay item or items the cost of all labor, equipment, materials, tools
 and incidentals required for the complete item of work, including all requirements of the Section
 specifying such item of work, except as specifically excluded from such payments.
 9-2.1.1 Fuels: The Department will, in the Contract Documents, provide an
 estimated quantity for fuel requirements for gasoline and diesel to cover the work specified in the
 Contract. Price adjustments will be made only for the amount of gasoline and diesel fuel
 estimated by the Department as required to complete the Contract. The requirement of each type
 of fuel for each pay item is estimated by multiplying the Department’s standard fuel factor for
 that pay item by the quantity of that pay item. On Contracts with an original Contract Time in
 excess of 120 calendar days, the Department will make price adjustments on each applicable
 progress estimate to reflect increases or decreases in the price of gasoline and diesel from those
 in effect during the month in which bids were received. The Contractor will not be given the
 option of accepting or rejecting these adjustments. Price adjustments for these fuels will be made
 only when the current fuel price (CFP) varies by more than 5% from the price prevailing in the
 month when bids were received (BFP), and then only on the portion that exceeds 5%.
 Price adjustments will be based on the monthly bulk average price for gas
 and diesel as derived by the Department. These average indexes shall be determined by
 averaging bulk fuel prices on the first day of each month as quoted by major oil companies that
 are reasonably expected to furnish fuel for projects in the State of Florida. Average price indices
 for gasoline and diesel will be available on the Construction Office website before the 15th of
 each month, at the following URL:
 http://www.fdot.gov/construction/fuel&Bit/Fuel&Bit.shtm .
 Payment will be based on the quantities shown on the progress estimate on
 all items for which established standard fuel factors are on a file maintained by the Department.
 Payment on progress estimates will be adjusted to reflect adjustments in
 the prices for gasoline and diesel in accordance with the following:
 When fuel prices have decreased between month of bid and month of this
 progress estimate:
 Ai = Fi (Pi - 0.95 Pb) during a period of decreasing prices.
 Ai = Total dollar amount - positive or negative - of the cost
 adjustment for each kind of fuel used by the Contractor during the month “i.”
 Fi = Total gallons calculated as being used during the month.
 Pi = Average price for fuel prevailing during month “i.”
 Pb = Average price for fuel prevailing during the month “b” when
 bids were received on this Contract.
 When fuel prices have increased between month of bid and month of this
 progress estimate:
 Ai = Fi (Pi - 1.05 Pb) during a period of increasing prices.
 Ai = Total dollar amount - positive or negative - of the cost
 adjustment for each kind of fuel used by the Contractor during the month “i.”
 Fi = Total gallons calculated as being used during the month.
 Pi = Average price for fuel prevailing during month “i.”
 Pb = Average price for fuel prevailing during the month “b” when
 bids were received on this Contract.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 96
 
 Payment will be made on the current progress estimate to reflect the index
 difference at the time work was performed.
 Adjustments will be paid or charged to the Prime Contractor only. Any
 Contractor receiving an adjustment under this provision shall distribute the proper proportional
 part of such adjustment to subcontractors who perform applicable work.
 9-2.1.2 Bituminous Material: Prepare a Contractor’s Certification of Quantities,
 using the Department’s current approved form for Superpave Asphalt Base, Turnout
 Construction (Asphalt), Asphalt Treated Permeable Base, Superpave Asphaltic Concrete,
 Miscellaneous Asphalt Pavement, Asphalt Concrete Friction Course, and Asphalt Membrane
 Interlayer pay items. Submit this certification to the Engineer no later than Twelve O’clock noon
 Monday after the estimate cut-off or as directed by the Engineer, based on the quantity of asphalt
 produced and accepted on the roadway per Contract. Ensure the certification includes the
 Contract Number, Financial Project Identification (FPID) Number, Certification Date and
 Number, the period the certification represents and the tons produced for each asphalt pay item.
 On Contracts having an original Contract Time of more than 365 calendar
 days, or more than 5,000 tons of asphalt concrete, the Department will adjust the bid unit price
 for bituminous material, excluding cutback and emulsified asphalt to reflect increases or
 decreases in the Asphalt Price Index (API) of bituminous material from that in effect during the
 month in which bids were received. The Contractor will not be given the option of accepting or
 rejecting this adjustment. Bituminous adjustments will be made only when the current
 API (CAPI) varies by more than 5% of the API prevailing in the month when bids were received
 (BAPI), and then only on the portion that exceeds 5%.
 The Department will determine the API for each month by averaging
 quotations in effect on the first day of the month at all terminals that could reasonably be
 expected to furnish bituminous material to projects in the State of Florida.
 The API will be available on the Construction Office website before the
 15th day of each month at the following URL:
 http://www.fdot.gov/construction/fuel&Bit/Fuel&Bit.shtm .
 Payment on progress estimates will be adjusted to reflect adjustments in
 the prices for bituminous materials in accordance with the following:
 $ Adjustment = (ID)(Gallons)
 Where ID = Index Difference = [CAPI - 0.95(BAPI)] when the
 API has decreased between the month of bid and month of this progress estimate.
 Where ID = Index Difference = [CAPI - 1.05(BAPI)] when the
 API has increased between the month of bid and month of this progress estimate.
 Payment will be made on the current progress estimate to reflect the index
 difference at the time work was performed.
 For asphalt concrete items payable by the ton or square yard, the number
 of gallons will be determined assuming a mix design with 6.25% liquid asphalt weighing
 8.58 pounds per gallon.
 For asphalt concrete items payable by the cubic yard, the number of
 gallons will be determined assuming a mix design with 3% liquid asphalt weighing 8.58 pounds
 per gallon.
 9-2.2 Non-Duplication of Payment: In cases where the basis of payment clause in these
 Specifications relating to any unit price in the bid schedule requires that the unit price cover and
 be considered compensation for certain work or material essential to the item, the Department
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 97
 
 will not measure or pay for this same work or material under any other pay item that may appear
 elsewhere in these Specifications.
 9-3 Compensation for Altered Quantities.
 9-3.1 General: When alteration in Plans or quantities of work not requiring a
 supplemental agreement as hereinbefore provided for are offered and performed, the Contractor
 shall accept payment in full at Contract unit bid prices for the actual quantities of work done, and
 no allowance will be made for increased expense, loss of expected reimbursement, or loss of
 anticipated profits suffered or claimed by the Contractor, resulting either directly from such
 alterations, or indirectly from unbalanced allocation among the Contract items of overhead
 expense on the part of the bidder and subsequent loss of expected reimbursement therefore, or
 from any other cause.
 Compensation for alterations in Plans or quantities of work requiring
 supplemental agreements shall be stipulated in such agreement, except when the Contractor
 proceeds with the work without change of price being agreed upon, the Contractor shall be paid
 for such increased or decreased quantities at the Contract unit prices bid in the Proposal for the
 items of work. If no Contract unit price is provided in the Contract, and the parties cannot agree
 as to a price for the work, the Contractor agrees to do the work in accordance with 4-3.2.
 9-3.2 Payment Based on Plan Quantity:
 9-3.2.1 Error in Plan Quantity: As used in this Article, the term “substantial
 error” is defined as the smaller of (1) or (2) below:
 1. a difference between the original plan quantity and final quantity
 of more than 5%,
 2. a change in quantity which causes a change in the amount
 payable of more than $5,000.
 On multiple job Contracts, changes made to an individual pay item due to
 substantial errors will be based on the entire Contract quantity for that pay item.
 Where the pay quantity for any item is designated to be the original plan
 quantity, the Department will revise such quantity only in the event that the Department
 determines it is in substantial error. In general, the Department will determine such revisions by
 final measurement, plan calculations, or both, as additions to or deductions from plan quantities.
 In the event that either the Department or the Contractor contends that the
 plan quantity for any item is in error and additional or less compensation is thereby due, the
 claimant shall submit, at their own expense, evidence of such in the form of acceptable and
 verifiable measurements or calculations. The Department will not revise the plan quantity solely
 on the basis of a particular method of construction that the Contractor selects. For earthwork
 items, the claimant must note any differences in the original ground surfaces from that shown in
 the original Plan cross-sections that would result in a substantial error to the plan quantity, and
 must be properly documented by appropriate verifiable level notes, acceptable to both the
 Contractor and the Department, prior to disturbance of the original ground surface by
 construction operations. The claimant shall support any claim based upon a substantial error for
 differences in the original ground surface by documentation as provided above.
 9-3.2.2 Authorized Changes in Limits of Work: Where the Department
 designates the pay quantity for any item to be the original plan quantity and authorizes a plan
 change which results in an increase or decrease in the quantity of that item, the Department will
 revise the plan quantity accordingly. In general, the Department will determine such revisions by
 final measurement, plan calculations or both.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 98
 
 9-3.2.3 Specified Adjustments to Pay Quantities: Do not apply the limitations
 specified in 9-3.2.1 and 9-3.2.2 to the following:
 1. Where these Specifications or Special Provisions provide that the
 Department determines the pay quantity for an item on the basis of area of finished work
 adjusted in accordance with the ratio of measured thickness to nominal thickness.
 2. Where these Specifications provide for a deduction due to test results
 falling outside of the allowable specified tolerances.
 3. To payment for extra length fence posts, as specified in 550-6.3.
 9-3.3 Lump Sum Quantities:
 9-3.3.1 Error in Lump Sum Quantity: Where the Department designates the
 pay quantity for an item to be a lump sum and the Plans show an estimated quantity, the
 Department will adjust the lump sum compensation only in the event that either the Contractor
 submits satisfactory evidence or the Department determines and furnishes satisfactory evidence
 that the lump sum quantity shown is in substantial error as defined in 9-3.2.1.
 9-3.3.2 Authorized Changes in Work: Where the Department designates the pay
 quantity for an item to be a lump sum and the Plans show an estimated quantity, the Department
 will adjust compensation for that item proportionately when an authorized plan change is made
 which results in an increase or decrease in the quantity of that item. When the Plans do not show
 an estimated plan quantity or the applicable specifications do not provide adjustments for
 contingencies, the Department will compensate for any authorized plan change resulting in an
 increase or decrease in the cost of acceptably completing the item by establishing a new unit
 price through a supplemental agreement as provided in 4-3.2.
 9-3.4 Deviation from Plan Dimensions: If the Contractor fails to construct any item to
 Plan or to authorized dimensions within the specified tolerances, the Engineer, at his discretion
 will: require the Contractor to reconstruct the work to acceptable tolerances at no additional cost
 to the Department; accept the work and provide the Contractor no pay; or accept the work and
 provide the Contractor a reduced final pay quantity or reduced unit price. The Department will
 not make reductions to final pay quantities for those items designated to be paid on the basis of
 original plan quantity or a lump sum quantity under the provisions of this Article unless such
 reduction results in an aggregate monetary change per item of more than $100, except that for
 earthwork items, the aggregate change must exceed $5,000 or 5% of the original plan quantity,
 whichever is smaller. If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the Contractor has made a deliberate
 attempt to take advantage of the construction tolerances as defined in 120-12.1 to increase
 borrow excavation in fill sections or to decrease the required volume of roadway or lateral ditch
 excavation or embankment, the Department will take appropriate measurements and will apply
 reductions in pay quantities. The Department will not use the construction tolerance, as defined
 in 120-12.1, as a pay tolerance. The construction tolerance is not to be construed as defining a
 revised authorized template.
 9-4 Deleted Work.
 The Department will have the right to cancel the portions of the Contract relating to the
 construction of any acceptable item therein, by making an adjustment in payment to the
 Contractor of a fair and equitable amount covering the value of all cancelled work less all items
 of cost incurred prior to the date that the Engineer cancels the work.

 9-5 Partial Payments.
 9-5.1 General: The Engineer will make partial payments on monthly estimates based on
 the amount of work that the Contractor completes during the month (including delivery of certain
 materials, as specified herein below). The Engineer will make approximate monthly payments,
 and the Department will correct all partial estimates and payments in the subsequent estimates
 and in the final estimate and payment.
 The Department will base the amount of such payments on the total value of the
 work that the Contractor has performed to the date of the estimate, based on the quantities
 completed and the Contract prices, less payments previously made and less any retainage
 withheld.
 Retainage will not be withheld until the percent of Contract Time used exceeds
 75%. From that time forward, the Department will withhold retainage of 10% of the amount due
 on the current estimate as retainage when the percent of Contract Time used exceeds the percent
 of Contract amount earned by more than 15%.
 Contract amount is defined as the original Contract amount adjusted by approved
 supplemental agreements.
 Retainage will be determined for each job on multiple job Contracts. The
 Department will not accept Securities, Certificates of Deposit or letters of credit as a replacement
 for retainage. Amounts withheld will not be released until payment of the final estimate.
 9-5.2 Unsatisfactory Payment Record: In accordance with Sections 255.05 and 337.16
 of the Florida Statutes, and the rules of the Department, the Department may disqualify the
 Contractor from bidding on future Department contracts if the Contractor’s payment record in
 connection with contract work becomes unsatisfactory.
 9-5.3 Withholding Payment:
 9-5.3.1 Withholding Payment for Defective Work: If the Department discovers
 any defective work or material prior to the final acceptance, or if the Department has a
 reasonable doubt as to the integrity of any part of the completed work prior to final acceptance,
 then the Department will not allow payment for such defective or questioned work until the
 Contractor has remedied the defect and removed any causes of doubt.
 9-5.3.2 Withholding Payment for Failure to Comply: The Department will
 withhold progress payments from the Contractor if he fails to comply with any or all of the
 following within 60 days after beginning work:
 1. Comply with and submit required documentation relating to prevailing
 wage rate provisions, Equal Employment Opportunity, On-The-Job Training, and Affirmative
 Action;
 2. Comply with the requirement to report all necessary information,
 including actual payments to DBEs, all other subcontractors and major suppliers, through the
 Internet based Equal Opportunity Reporting System;
 3. Comply with or make a good faith effort to ensure employment
 opportunity for minorities and females in accordance with the required contract provisions for
 Federal Aid Construction Contracts, and
 4. Comply with or make a good faith effort to meet On-The-Job Training
 goals.
 The Department will withhold progress payments until the Contractor has
 satisfied the above conditions.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 100
 
 9-5.4 Release of Retainage After Acceptance: When the Contractor has furnished the
 Department with all submittals required by the Contract, such as invoices, EEO reports, materials
 certifications, certification of materials procured, etc., (excluding Contractor’s letter of
 acceptance of final amount due and Form 21-A release) and the Engineer has determined that the
 measurement and computation of pay quantities is correct, the Department may reduce the
 retainage to $1,000 plus any amount that the Department elects to deduct for defective work as
 provided in 9-5.3.
 The Department will not allow a semifinal estimate under the provisions of the
 above paragraphs unless the time elapsing between (1) acceptance of the project and receipt of
 all test reports, invoices, etc., and (2) submission of the final estimate to the Contractor for
 acceptance, exceeds or is expected to exceed ten days.
 The Department may deduct from payment estimates any sums that the
 Contractor owes to the Department on any account. Where more than one project or job (separate
 job number) is included in the Contract, the Department will distribute the reduced retainage as
 provided in the first paragraph of this Subarticle to each separate project or job in the ratio that
 the Contract value of the work for the particular job bears to the total Contract amount.
 9-5.5 Partial Payments for Delivery of Certain Materials:
 9-5.5.1 General: The Department will allow partial payments for new materials
 that will be permanently incorporated into the project and are stockpiled in approved locations in
 the project vicinity. Stockpile materials so that they will not be damaged by the elements and in a
 manner that identifies the project on which they are to be used.
 The following conditions apply to all payments for stockpiled materials:
 1. There must be reasonable assurance that the stockpiled material
 will be incorporated into the specific project on which partial payment is made.
 2. The stockpiled material must be approved as meeting applicable
 specifications.
 3. The total quantity for which partial payment is made shall not
 exceed the estimated total quantity required to complete the project.
 4. The Contractor shall submit to the Engineer certified invoices to
 document the value of the materials received. The amount of the partial payment will be
 determined from invoices for the material up to the unit price in the Contract.
 5. Delivery charges for materials delivered to the jobsite will be
 included in partial payments if properly documented.
 6. Partial payments will not be made for materials which were
 stockpiled prior to award of the Contract for a project.
 9-5.5.2 Partial Payment Amounts: The following partial payment restrictions
 apply:
 1. Partial payments less than $5,000 for any one month will not be
 processed.
 2. Partial payments for structural steel and precast prestressed items will
 not exceed 85% of the bid price for the item. Partial payments for all other items will not exceed
 75% of the bid price of the item in which the material is to be used.
 3. Partial payment will not be made for aggregate and base course material
 received after paving or base construction operations begin except when a construction sequence
 designated by the Department requires suspension of paving and base construction after the
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 101
 
 initial paving operations, partial payments will be reinstated until the paving and base
 construction resumes.
 9-5.5.3 Off Site Storage: If the conditions of 9-5.5.1 are satisfied, partial
 payments will be allowed for materials stockpiled in approved in-state locations. Additionally,
 partial payments for materials stockpiled in approved out-of-state locations will be allowed if the
 conditions of 9-5.5.1 and the following conditions are met:
 1. Furnish the Department a Materials Bond stating the supplier
 guarantees to furnish the material described in the Contract to the Contractor and Department.
 Under this bond, the Obligor shall be the material supplier and the Obligees shall be the
 Contractor and the Florida Department of Transportation. The bond shall be in the full dollar
 amount of the bid price for the materials described in the contract.
 2. The following clauses must be added to the construction Contract
 between the Contractor and the supplier of the stockpiled materials:
 “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, <supplier> will be
 liable to the Contractor and the Florida Department of Transportation should <supplier> default
 in the performance of this agreement.”
 “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this agreement, and the
 performance bond issued pursuant to this agreement, does not alter, modify, or otherwise change
 the Contractor’s obligation to furnish the materials described in this agreement to the Florida
 Department of Transportation.”
 3. The agreement between the Contractor and the supplier of the
 stockpiled materials must include provisions that the supplier will store the materials and that
 such materials are the property of the Contractor.
 9-5.6 Certification of Payment to Subcontractors: The term “subcontractor,” as used
 herein, includes persons or firms furnishing materials or equipment incorporated into the work or
 stockpiled for which the Department has made partial payment and firms working under
 equipment-rental agreements. The Contractor is required to pay all subcontractors for
 satisfactory performance of their Contracts before the Department will make a further progress
 (partial) payment. The Contractor shall also return all retainage withheld to the subcontractors
 within 30 days after the subcontractor’s work is satisfactorily complete, as determined by the
 Department. Prior to receipt of any progress (partial) payment, the prime contractor shall certify
 that all subcontractors having an interest in the Contract were paid for satisfactory performance
 of their Contracts and that the retainage is returned to subcontractors within 30 days after
 satisfactory completion of the subcontractor’s work. Submit this certification in the form
 designated by the Department.
 Within 30 days of the Contractor’s receipt of the final progress payment or any
 other payments thereafter, except the final payment, the Contractor shall pay all subcontractors
 and suppliers having an interest in the Contract for all work completed and materials furnished.
 The Department will honor an exception to the above when the Contractor demonstrates good
 cause for not making any required payment and submits written notification of any such good
 cause to both the Department and the affected subcontractors or suppliers within said 30 day
 period.
 The Contractor shall indemnify and provide defense for the Department when
 called upon to do so for all claims or suits against the Department, by third parties, pertaining to
 Contractor payment or performance issues arising out of the Contract. It is expressly understood
 that the monetary limitation on the extent of the indemnification shall be the approved Contract
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 102
 
 amount, which shall be the original Contract amount as may be increased by subsequent
 Supplemental Agreements.
 9-6 Record of Construction Materials.
 9-6.1 General: For all construction materials used in the construction of the project,
 (except materials exempted by 9-6.2), preserve for the Department’s inspection the invoices and
 records of the materials for a period of three years from the date of completion of the project.
 Apply this requirement when subcontractors purchase materials, and obtain the invoices and
 other materials records from the subcontractors. By providing the materials, the Contractor
 certifies that all invoices will be maintained for the required period.
 9-6.2 Non-Commercial Materials: The provisions of 9-6.1 do not apply to materials
 generally classed as non-commercial, such as fill materials, local sand, sand-clay, or local
 materials used as stabilizer.
 9-7 Disputed Amounts Due the Contractor.
 The Department reserves the right to withhold from the final estimate any disputed
 amounts between the Contractor and the Department. The Department will release all other
 amounts due, as provided in 9-8.
 9-8 Acceptance and Final Payment.
 9-8.1 Acceptance and Final Payment Documents: Whenever the Contractor has
 completely performed the work provided for under the Contract and the Engineer has performed
 a final inspection and made final acceptance (as provided in 5-10 and 5-11), and subject to the
 terms of 8-11, the Engineer will prepare a final estimate showing the value of the work as soon
 as the Engineer makes the necessary measurements and computations. The Engineer will correct
 all prior estimates and payments in the final estimate and payment. The Department will pay the
 estimate, less any sums that the Department may have deducted or retained under the provisions
 of the Contract, as soon as practicable after final acceptance of the work, along with all executed
 supplemental agreements received after final acceptance.
 If the Contractor fails to furnish all required Contract Documents as listed in (1)
 through (9) below within 90 days of the Department’s offer of final payment or request for
 refund of overpayment, the Department may suspend the Contractor’s Certificate of
 Qualification under the provisions of Florida Administrative Code 14-22.
 1. The Contractor has agreed in writing to accept the balance due or refund
 the overpayment, as determined by the Department, as full settlement of his account under the
 Contract and of all claims in connection therewith, or the Contractor, has through the use of the
 Qualified Acceptance Letter, accepted the balance due or refunded the overpayment, as
 determined by the Department, with the stipulation that his acceptance of such payment or the
 making of such refund does not constitute any bar, admission, or estoppel, or have any effect as
 to those payments in dispute or the subject of a pending claim between the Contractor and the
 Department. To receive payment based on a Qualified Acceptance Letter, define in writing the
 dispute or pending claim with full particular of all items of all issues in dispute, including
 itemized amounts claimed for all particulars of all items, and submit it as part of the Qualified
 Acceptance Letter. The Contractor further agrees, by submitting a Qualified Acceptance Letter
 that any pending or future arbitration claim or suit is limited to those particulars, including the
 itemized amounts, defined in the original Qualified Acceptance Letter, and that he will
 commence with any such arbitration claim or suit within 820 calendar days from and after the
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 103
 
 time of final acceptance of the work and that his failure to file a formal claim within this period
 constitutes his full acceptance of the Engineer’s final estimate and payment. The overpayment
 refund check from the Contractor, if required, will be considered a part of any Acceptance Letter
 executed.
 2. The Contractor has properly maintained the project, as specified
 hereinbefore.
 3. The Contractor has furnished a sworn affidavit to the effect that the
 Contractor has paid all bills and no suits are pending (other than those exceptions listed, if any)
 in connection with work performed under the Contract and that the Contractor has not offered or
 made any gift or gratuity to, or made any financial transaction of any nature with, any employee
 of the Department in the performance of the Contract. Include with the listed tort liability
 exceptions, if any, evidence of adequate insurance coverage as required in 7-13.
 4. The surety on the Contract bond consents, by completion of their
 portion of the affidavit and surety release subsequent to the Contractor’s completion of his
 portion, to final payment to the Contractor and agrees that the making of such payment does not
 relieve the surety of any of its obligations under the bond.
 5. The Contractor has complied with and settled all requirements
 pertaining to any wage-rate provisions.
 6. The Contractor has submitted all required mill tests and analysis reports
 to the Engineer.
 7. The Contractor has furnished the Construction Compliance with
 Specifications and Plans Certification. Provide the Engineer with a notarized final certification of
 compliance with the requirements of Section 105 to accompany the final estimate. Certification
 must be on a form provided by the Engineer.
 8. The Contractor has submitted and the Department has accepted all asbuilt drawings and certified surveys.
 9. The Contractor has furnished all required manufacturers’ warranties to
 the Engineer.
 9-8.2 Review of Engineer’s Final Estimate: The Department may review the Engineer’s
 final estimate and make changes as necessary. If changes are made, the Contractor will be so
 notified in writing in the “Notification of Findings Due to Additional Review”. This notification
 letter will detail the changes made as a result of the review, and will stipulate the actions to be
 taken by the Department and those required by the Contractor. The issuance of a “Notification of
 Findings Due to Additional Review” will not impact the requirements of 9-8.1, above.
 Complete the required actions and submit the signed “Notification of Findings

 SECTION 104
 PREVENTION, CONTROL, AND ABATEMENT OF
 EROSION AND WATER POLLUTION
 104-1 Description.
 Provide erosion control measures on the project and in areas outside the right-of-way
 where work is accomplished in conjunction with the project, so as to prevent pollution of water,
 detrimental effects to public or private property adjacent to the project right-of-way and damage
 to work on the project. Construct and maintain temporary erosion control features or, where
 practical, construct and maintain permanent erosion control features as shown in the Plans or as
 may be directed by the Engineer.
 104-2 General.
 Coordinate the installation of temporary erosion control features with the construction of
 the permanent erosion control features to the extent necessary to ensure economical, effective,
 and continuous control of erosion and water pollution throughout the life of the Contract.
 Due to unanticipated conditions, the Engineer may direct the use of control features or
 methods other than those included in the original Contract. In such event, the Department will
 pay for this additional work as unforeseeable work.
 104-3 Control of Contractor’s Operations Which May Result in Water Pollution.
 Prevent pollution of streams, canals, lakes, reservoirs, and other water impoundments
 with fuels, oils, bitumens, calcium chloride, or other harmful materials. Also, conduct and
 schedule operations to avoid or otherwise minimize pollution or siltation of such water
 impoundments, and to avoid interference with movement of migratory fish. Do not dump any
 residue from dust collectors or washers into any live stream.
 Restrict construction operations in rivers, streams, lakes, tidal waters, reservoirs, canals,
 and other water impoundments to those areas where it is necessary to perform filling or
 excavation to accomplish the work shown in the Plans and to those areas which must be entered
 to construct temporary or permanent structures. As soon as conditions permit, promptly clear
 rivers, streams, and impoundments of all obstructions placed therein or caused by construction
 operations.
 Do not frequently ford live streams with construction equipment. Wherever an
 appreciable number of stream crossings are necessary at any one location, use a temporary bridge
 or other structure.
 Except as necessary for construction, do not deposit excavated material in rivers, streams,
 canals, or impoundments, or in a position close enough thereto, to be washed away by high water
 or runoff.
 Where pumps are used to remove highly turbid waters from enclosed construction areas
 such as cofferdams or forms, treat the water by one or more of the following methods prior to
 discharge into State waters: pumping into grassed swales or appropriate vegetated areas or
 sediment basins, or confined by an appropriate enclosure such as turbidity barriers when other
 methods are not considered appropriate.
 Do not disturb lands or waters outside the limits of construction as staked, except as
 authorized by the Engineer.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 130
 
 Obtain the Engineer’s approval for the location of, and method of operation in, borrow
 pits, material pits, and disposal areas furnished for waste material from the project (other than
 commercially operated sources) such that erosion during and after completion of the work will
 not result in probability of detrimental siltation or water pollution.
 104-4 Materials for Temporary Erosion Control.
 The Engineer will not require testing of materials used in construction of temporary
 erosion control features other than as provided for geotextile fabric in 985-3 unless such material
 is to be incorporated into the completed project. When no testing is required, the Engineer will
 base acceptance on visual inspection.
 The Contractor may use new or used materials for the construction of temporary silt
 fence, staked turbidity barriers, and floating turbidity barrier not to be incorporated into the
 completed project, subject to the approval of the Engineer.
 104-5 Preconstruction Requirements.
 Prior to the Preconstruction Conference, submit to the Department an Erosion Control
 Plan meeting the requirements or special conditions of all permits authorizing project
 construction. If no permits are required or the approved permits do not contain special conditions
 or specifically address erosion and water pollution, the project Erosion Control Plan will be
 governed by 7-1.1, 7-2.2, 7-8.1, 7-8.2, and Section 104.
 When a DEP generic permit is issued, the Contractor’s Erosion Control Plan shall be
 prepared to accompany the Department’s Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP).
 Ensure the Erosion Control Plan includes procedures to control off-site tracking of soil by
 vehicles and construction equipment and a procedure for cleanup and reporting of non-storm
 water discharges, such as contaminated groundwater or accidental spills. Do not begin any soil
 disturbing activities until Department approval of the Contractor’s Erosion Control Plan,
 including required signed certification statements have been submitted to the Department.
 Failure to sign and submit any required documents or certification statements will be
 considered a default of the Contract. Any soil disturbing activities performed without the
 required signed documents or certification statements may be considered a violation of the DEP
 Generic Permit.
 When the SWPPP is required, prepare the Erosion Control Plan in accordance with the
 planned sequence of operations and present in a format acceptable to the Department. The
 Erosion Control Plan shall describe, but not be limited to, the following items or activities:
 1. For each phase of construction operations or activities, supply the following
 information:
 a. Locations of all erosion control devices
 b. Types of all erosion control devices
 c. Estimated time erosion control devices will be in operation
 d. Monitoring schedules for maintenance of erosion control devices
 e. Methods of maintaining erosion control devices
 f. Containment or removal methods for pollutants or hazardous wastes
 2. The name and telephone number of the person responsible for monitoring and
 maintaining the erosion control devices.
 3. Submit for approval the Erosion Control Plans meeting paragraphs 3a, 3b, or 3c
 below:
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 131
 
 a. Projects permitted by the Southwest Florida Water Management District
 (SWFWMD), require the following:
 Submit the Erosion Control Plan to the Engineer for review and to
 the appropriate SWFWMD Office for review and approval. Include the SWFWMD permit
 number on all submitted data or correspondence.
 The Contractor may schedule a meeting with the appropriate
 SWFWMD Office to discuss his Erosion Control Plan in detail, to expedite the review and
 approval process. Advise the Engineer of the time and place of any meetings scheduled with
 SWFWMD.
 Do not begin construction activities until the Erosion Control Plan
 receives written approval from both SWFWMD and the Engineer.
 b. Projects permitted by the South Florida Water Management District or
 the St. Johns River Water Management District, require the following:
 Obtain the Engineer’s approval of the Erosion Control Plan.
 Do not begin construction activities until the Erosion Control Plan
 receives written approval from the Engineer.
 c. Projects authorized by permitting agencies other than the Water
 Management Districts or projects for which no permits are required require the following:
 The Engineer will review and approve the Contractor’s Erosion
 Control Plan.
 Do not begin construction activities until the Erosion Control Plan
 receives written approval from the Engineer.
 Comply with the approved Erosion Control Plan.
 104-6 Construction Requirements.
 104-6.1 Limitation of Exposure of Erodible Earth: The Engineer may limit the surface
 areas of unprotected erodible earth exposed by the construction operation and may direct the
 Contractor to provide erosion or pollution control measures to prevent contamination of any
 river, stream, lake, tidal waters, reservoir, canal, or other water impoundments or to prevent
 detrimental effects on property outside the project right-of-way or damage to the project. Limit
 the area in which excavation and filling operations are being performed so that it does not exceed
 the capacity to keep the finish grading, turf, sod, and other such permanent erosion control
 measures current in accordance with the accepted schedule.
 Do not allow the surface area of erodible earth that clearing and grubbing
 operations or excavation and filling operations expose to exceed 750,000 square feet without
 specific prior approval by the Engineer. This limitation applies separately to clearing and
 grubbing operations and excavation and filling operations.
 The Engineer may increase or decrease the amount of surface area the Contractor
 may expose at any one time.
 104-6.2 Incorporation of Erosion and Sediment Control Features: Incorporate
 permanent erosion control features into the project at the earliest practical time. Use temporary
 erosion and sediment control features found in the State of Florida Erosion and Sediment Control
 Designer and Reviewer Manual (E&SC Manual) to correct conditions that develop during
 construction which were not foreseen at the time of design, to control erosion and sediment prior
 to the time it is practical to construct permanent control features, or to provide immediate

 temporary control of erosion and sediment that develops during normal construction operations,
 which are not associated with permanent erosion control features on the project. An electronic
 version of the E&SC Manual can be found at the following URL:
 http://www.fdot.gov/programmanagement/Implemented/URLinSpecs/Files/FLErosionSe
 dimentManual.pdf
 Install all sediment control devices in a timely manner to ensure the control of
 sediment and the protection of lakes, streams, gulf or ocean waters, or any wetlands associated
 therewith and to any adjacent property outside the right-of-way as required.
 Complete the installation of sediment control devices prior to the commencement
 of any earthwork.
 After installation of sediment control devices, repair portions of any devices
 damaged at no expense to the Department. The Engineer may authorize temporary erosion and
 sediment control features when finished soil layer is specified in the Contract and the limited
 availability of that material from the grading operations will prevent scheduled progress of the
 work or damage the permanent erosion control features.
 104-6.3 Scheduling of Successive Operations: Schedule operations such that the area of
 unprotected erodible earth exposed at any one time is not larger than the minimum area necessary
 for efficient construction operations, and the duration of exposure of uncompleted construction to
 the elements is as short as practicable.
 Schedule and perform clearing and grubbing so that grading operations can follow
 immediately thereafter. Schedule and perform grading operations so that permanent erosion
 control features can follow immediately thereafter if conditions on the project permit.
 104-6.4 Details for Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Features:
 104-6.4.1 General: Use temporary erosion, sediment and water pollution control
 features found in the E&SC Manual. These features consist of, but are not limited to, temporary
 turf, rolled erosion control products, sediment containment systems, runoff control structures,
 sediment barriers, inlet protection systems, silt fences, turbidity barriers, and chemical treatment.
 For design details for some of these items, refer to the Standard Plans and E&SC Manual.
 104-6.4.2 Temporary Turf: The Engineer may designate certain areas of turf or
 sod constructed in accordance with Section 570 as temporary erosion control features. For areas
 not defined as sod, constructing temporary turf by seeding only is not an option for temporary
 erosion control under this Section. The Engineer may waive the turf establishment requirements
 of Section 570 for areas with temporary turf that will not be a part of the permanent construction.
 104-6.4.3 Runoff Control Structures: Construct runoff control structures in
 accordance with the details shown in the Plans, the E&SC Manual, or as may be approved as
 suitable to adequately perform the intended function.
 104-6.4.4 Sediment Containment Systems: Construct sediment containment
 systems in accordance with the details shown in the Plans, the E&SC Manual, or as may be
 approved as suitable to adequately perform the intended function. Clean out sediment
 containment systems as necessary in accordance with the Plans or as directed.
 104-6.4.5 Sediment Barriers: Provide and install sediment barriers according to
 details shown in the Plans, as directed by the Engineer, or as shown in the E&SC Manual to
 protect against downstream accumulation of sediment. Sediment Barriers include, but are not
 limited to synthetic bales, silt fence, fiber logs and geosynthetic barriers. Reusable barriers that
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 133
 
 have had sediment deposits removed may be reinstalled on the project as approved by the
 Engineer.
 104-6.4.6 Silt Fence:
 104-6.4.6.1 General: Furnish, install, maintain, and remove silt fences, in
 accordance with the manufacturer’s directions, these Specifications, the details as shown in the
 Plans, the Standard Plans, and the E&SC Manual.
 104-6.4.6.2 Materials and Installation: Use a geotextile fabric made
 from woven or nonwoven fabric, meeting the physical requirements of Section 985 according to
 those applications for erosion control.
 Choose the type and size of posts, wire mesh reinforcement (if
 required), and method of installation. Do not use products which have a separate layer of plastic
 mesh or netting. Provide a durable and effective silt fence that controls sediment comparable to
 the Standard Plans and the E&SC Manual.
 Erect silt fence at upland locations, across ditchlines and at
 temporary locations shown in the Plans or approved by the Engineer where continuous
 construction activities change the natural contour and drainage runoff. Do not attach silt fence to
 existing trees unless approved by the Engineer.
 104-6.4.6.3 Inspection and Maintenance: Inspect all silt fences
 immediately after each rainfall and at least daily during prolonged rainfall. Immediately correct
 any deficiencies. In addition, make a daily review of the location of silt fences in areas where
 construction activities have changed the natural contour and drainage runoff to ensure that the silt
 fences are properly located for effectiveness. Where deficiencies exist, install additional silt
 fences as directed by the Engineer.
 Remove sediment deposits when the deposit reaches approximately
 1/2 of the volume capacity of the silt fence or as directed by the Engineer. Dress any sediment
 deposits remaining in place after the silt fence is no longer required to conform with the finished
 grade, and prepare and seed them in accordance with Section 570.
 104-6.4.7 Floating Turbidity Barriers and Staked Turbidity Barriers: Install,
 maintain, and remove turbidity barriers to contain turbidity that may occur as the result of
 dredging, filling, or other construction activities which may cause turbidity to occur in the waters
 of the State. The Contractor may need to deploy turbidity barriers around isolated areas of
 concern such as seagrass beds, coral communities, etc. both within as well as outside the right-ofway limits. The Engineer will identify such areas. Place the barriers prior to the commencement
 of any work that could impact the area of concern. Install the barriers in accordance with the
 details shown in the Plans or as approved by the Engineer. Ensure that the type barrier used and
 the deployment and maintenance of the barrier will minimize dispersion of turbid waters from
 the construction site. The Engineer may approve alternate methods or materials.
 Operate turbidity barriers in such a manner to avoid or minimize the
 degradation of the water quality of the surrounding waters and minimize damage to areas where
 floating barriers installed.
 104-6.4.8 Inlet Protection System: Furnish and install inlet protection systems as
 shown in the Plans, the Standard Plans and the E&SC Manual.
 104-6.4.9 Rolled Erosion Control Products (RECPs):
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 134
 
 104-6.4.9.1 General: Install RECPs in locations where temporary
 protection from erosion is needed. Two situations occur that require artificial coverings. The two
 situations have differing material requirements, which are described below.
 1. Use RECPs composed of natural or synthetic fiber mats, plastic
 sheeting, or netting as protection against erosion, when directed by the Engineer, during
 temporary pauses in construction caused by inclement weather or other circumstances. Remove
 the material when construction resumes.
 2. Use RECPs as erosion control blankets, at locations shown in
 the Plans, to facilitate plant growth while permanent grassing is being established. For the
 purpose described, use non-toxic, biodegradable, natural or synthetic woven fiber mats. Install
 erosion control blankets capable of sustaining a maximum design velocity of 6.5 ft/sec as
 determined from tests performed by Utah State University, Texas Transportation Institute or an
 independent testing laboratory approved by the Department. Submit to the Engineer, certified test
 reports from the manufacturer showing that the erosion control blankets meet the requirements of
 this Specification. Certification must be attested, by a person having legal authority to bind the
 manufacturing company. Also, furnish two 4 by 8 inch samples for product identification. The
 manufacturers test records shall be made available to the Department upon request. Leave the
 material in place, as installed, to biodegrade.
 104-6.4.10 Chemical Treatment: Provide chemical treatment in accordance with
 the E&SC Manual. Chemical treatment may be used to clarify turbid or sediment laden water that
 does not yet meet state water quality standards or as an amendment to other erosion prevention
 and sediment control products to aid in their performance. The contractor must provide all of the
 required toxicity testing information in accordance with the E&SC Manual to the Engineer for
 review and acceptance prior to using any chemical treatment on the project site.
 104-6.5 Removal of Temporary Erosion Control Features: In general, remove or
 incorporate into the soil any temporary erosion control features existing at the time of
 construction of the permanent erosion control features in an area of the project in such a manner
 that no detrimental effect will result. The Engineer may direct that temporary features be left in
 place.
 104-7 Maintenance of Erosion and Sediment Control Features.
 104-7.1 General: Provide routine maintenance of permanent and temporary erosion and
 sediment control features, at no expense to the Department, until the project is complete and
 accepted. If reconstruction of such erosion and sediment control features is necessary due to the
 Contractor’s negligence or carelessness or, in the case of temporary erosion and sediment control
 features, failure by the Contractor to install permanent erosion control features as scheduled, the
 Contractor shall replace such erosion control features at no expense to the Department. If
 reconstruction of permanent or temporary erosion and sediment control features is necessary due
 to factors beyond the control of the Contractor, the Department will pay for replacement under
 the appropriate Contract pay item or items.
 Inspect all erosion and sediment control features at least once every seven
 calendar days and within 24 hours of the end of a storm of 0.50 inches or greater. Maintain all
 erosion control features as required in the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan, Contractor’s
 Erosion Control Plan and as specified in the State of Florida Department of Environmental

 Protection Generic Permit for Stormwater Discharge from Large and Small Construction
 Activities.
 104-8 Protection During Suspension of Contract Time.
 If it is necessary to suspend the construction operations for any appreciable length of
 time, shape the top of the earthwork in such a manner to permit runoff of rainwater, and construct
 earth berms along the top edges of embankments to intercept runoff water. Provide temporary
 slope drains to carry runoff from cuts and embankments that are in the vicinity of rivers, streams,
 canals, lakes, and impoundments. Locate slope drains at intervals of approximately 500 feet, and
 stabilize them by paving or by covering with waterproof materials. Should such preventive
 measures fail, immediately take such other action as necessary to effectively prevent erosion and
 siltation. The Engineer may direct the Contractor to perform, during such suspensions of
 operations, any other erosion and sediment control work deemed necessary.
 104-9 Method of Measurement.
 When separate items for temporary erosion control features are included in the Contract,
 the quantities to be paid for will be:
 1. the area, in square yards, of rolled erosion control products;
 2. the length, in feet, of runoff control structures, measured along the surface of
 the work constructed;
 3. the number of sediment containment systems constructed and accepted;
 4. the number of sediment containment system cleanouts accomplished and
 accepted
 5. the length, in feet, of sediment barriers;
 6. the length, in feet, of floating turbidity barrier;
 7. the length, in feet, of staked turbidity barrier;
 8. the number of inlet protection systems;
 9. the area, in square yards, of chemical treatment.
 10. the number of floc logs or drums of product for chemical treatment.
 Upon acceptance by the Engineer, the quantity of floating turbidity barriers, sediment
 barriers, staked turbidity barriers, and inlet protection devices will be paid for regardless of
 whether materials are new, used, or relocated from a previous installation on the project.
 104-10 Basis of Payment.
 Prices and payments will be full compensation for all work specified in this Section,
 including construction and routine maintenance of temporary erosion control features.
 Any additional costs resulting from compliance with the requirements of this Section,
 other than construction, routine maintenance, and removal of temporary erosion control features,
 will be included in the Contract unit prices for the item or items to which such costs are related.
 The work of performance turf designated as a temporary erosion control feature in accordance
 with 104-6.4.2 will be paid for under the appropriate pay items specified in the Contract
 Documents.
 Separate payment will not be made for the cost of constructing temporary earth berms
 along the edges of the roadways to prevent erosion during grading and subsequent operations.
 The Contractor shall include these costs in the Contract prices for grading items.

 110-6 Removal of Existing Bridges.
 110-6.1 General: The work under this Article includes bridges, as defined in 1-3.
 Remove and dispose of the materials from existing bridges. Remove
 1. those bridges and approach slabs, or portions of bridges, shown in the
 Plans to be removed,
 2. those bridges and approach slabs, or portions of bridges, found within
 the limits of the area to be cleared and grubbed, and directed by the Engineer to be removed,
 3. those bridges and approach slabs, or portion of bridges, which are
 necessary to be removed in order to complete the work, and
 4. other appurtenances or obstructions which may be designated in the
 Contract Documents to be included as an item of payment for the work under this Article.
 Submit schedule information and demolition plan for approval 15 working days
 before beginning any demolition or renovation of any structures.
 110-6.2 Method of Removal:
 110-6.2.1 General: Remove the structures in such a way so as to leave no
 obstructions to any proposed new bridge or to any waterways. Pull, cut off, or break off pilings
 to the requirements of the permit or other Contract Documents, or if not specified, not less than
 2 feet below the finish ground line. In the event that the Plans indicate channel excavation to be
 done by others, consider the finish ground line as the limits of such excavation. For materials
 which are to remain the property of the Department or are to be salvaged for use in temporary
 bridges, avoid damage to such materials, and entirely remove all bolts, nails, etc. from timbers to
 be so salvaged. Mark structural steel members for identification as directed.
 110-6.2.2 Removal of Steel Members with Hazardous Coatings: Submit to the
 Engineer for approval the “Contractor’s Lead in Construction Compliance Program”, QP2
 certification from the Society for Protective Coatings (SSPC) from the firm actually removing
 and disposing of these steel members before any members are disturbed.
 Vacuum power tool clean any coated steel member to bare metal as
 defined by SSPC-SP11 a minimum of 4 inches either side of any area to be heated (e.g. torch
 cutting, sawing, grinding, etc.) in accordance with 29 CFR 1926.354. Abrasive blasting is
 prohibited.
 110-6.3 Partial Removal of Bridges: On concrete bridges to be partially removed and
 widened, remove concrete by manually or mechanically operated pavement breakers, by
 concrete saws, by chipping hammers, or by hydro-demolition methods. Do not use explosives.
 Where concrete is to be removed to neat lines, use concrete saws or hydro-demolition methods
 capable of providing a reasonably uniform cleavage face. If the equipment used will not provide
 a uniform cut without surface spalling, first score the outlines of the work with small trenches or
 grooves. For all demolition methods, submit for review and approval of the Engineer, a
 demolition plan that describes the method of removal, equipment to be used, types of rebar
 splices or couplers, and method of straightening or cutting rebar. In addition, for hydrodemolition, describe the method for control of water or slurry runoff and measures for safe
 containment of concrete fragments that are thrown out by the hydro-demolition machine.
 110-6.4 Authority of U.S. Coast Guard: For bridges in navigable waters, when
 constructing the project under authority of a U.S. Coast Guard permit, the U.S. Coast Guard may
 inspect and approve the work to remove any existing bridges involved therein, prior to
 acceptance by the Department.

 EARTHWORK AND RELATED OPERATIONS
 SECTION 120
 EXCAVATION AND EMBANKMENT
 120-1 Description.
 120-1.1 General: Excavate and construct embankments as required for the roadway,
 ditches, channel changes and borrow material. Use suitable excavated material or authorized
 borrow to prepare subgrades and foundations. Construct embankments in accordance with
 Standard Plans, Index 120-001. Compact and dress excavated areas and embankments.
 Meet the requirements of Section 110 for excavation of material for clearing and
 grubbing and Section 125 for excavation and backfilling of structures and pipe. Material
 displaced by the storm sewer or drainage structure system is not included in the earthwork
 quantities shown in the Plans.
 120-1.2 Unidentified Areas of Contamination: When encountering or exposing any
 abnormal condition indicating the presence of contaminated materials, cease operations
 immediately in the vicinity and notify the Engineer. The presence of tanks or barrels; discolored
 earth, metal, wood, ground water, etc.; visible fumes; abnormal odors; excessively hot earth;
 smoke; or other conditions that appear abnormal may indicate the presence of contaminated
 materials and must be treated with extreme caution.
 Make every effort to minimize the spread of contamination into uncontaminated
 areas. Immediately provide for the health and safety of all workers at the job site and make
 provisions necessary for the health and safety of the public that may be exposed to any
 potentially hazardous conditions. Ensure provisions adhere to all applicable laws, rules or
 regulations covering potentially hazardous conditions and will be in a manner commensurate
 with the gravity of the conditions.
 The Engineer will notify the District Contamination Impact Coordinator (DCIC)
 who will coordinate selecting and tasking the Department’s Contamination
 Assessment/Remediation Contractor (CAR). Provide access to the potentially contaminated area.
 Preliminary investigation by the CAR Contractor will determine the course of action necessary
 for site security and the steps necessary under applicable laws, rules, and regulations for
 additional assessment and/or remediation work to resolve the contamination issue.
 The CAR Contractor will delineate the contamination areas, any staging or
 holding area required; and, in cooperation with the Prime Contractor and Engineer, develop a
 work plan that will provide the CAR Contractor’s operations schedule with projected completion
 dates for the final resolution of the contamination issue.
 The CAR Contractor will maintain jurisdiction over activities inside any outlined
 contaminated areas and any associated staging holding areas. The CAR Contractor will be
 responsible for the health and safety of workers within the delineated areas. Provide continuous
 access to these areas for the CAR Contractor and representatives of regulatory or enforcement
 agencies having jurisdiction.
 Both Contractors will use the schedule as a basis for planning the completion of
 both work efforts. The Engineer may grant the Contract Time extensions according to the
 provisions of 8-7.3.2.
 Cooperate with the CAR Contractor to expedite integration of the CAR
 Contractor’s operations into the construction project. The Prime Contractor is not expected to

 167
 
 engage in routine construction activities, such as excavating, grading, or any type of soil
 manipulation, or any construction processes required if handling of contaminated soil, surface
 water or ground water is involved. All routine construction activities requiring the handling of
 contaminated soil, surface water or groundwater will be by the CAR Contractor. Adjustments to
 quantities or to Contract unit prices will be made according to work additions or reductions on
 the part of the Prime Contractor in accordance with 4-3.
 The Engineer will direct the Prime Contractor when operations may resume in the
 affected area.
 120-2 Classifications of Excavation.
 120-2.1 General: The Department may classify excavation specified under this Section
 for payment as any of the following: regular excavation, subsoil excavation, lateral ditch
 excavation, and channel excavation.
 If the proposal does not show subsoil excavation or lateral ditch excavation as
 separate items of payment, include such excavation under the item of regular excavation.
 If the proposal shows lateral ditch excavation as a separate item of payment, but
 does not show channel excavation as a separate item of payment, include such excavation under
 the item of lateral ditch excavation. Otherwise, include channel excavation under the item of
 regular excavation.
 120-2.2 Regular Excavation: Regular excavation includes roadway excavation and
 borrow excavation, as defined below for each.
 120-2.2.1 Roadway Excavation: Roadway excavation consists of the excavation
 and the utilization or disposal of all materials necessary for the construction of the roadway,
 ditches, channel changes, etc., except as may be specifically shown to be paid for separately and
 that portion of the lateral ditches within the limits of the roadway right-of-way as shown in the
 Plans.
 120-2.2.2 Borrow Excavation: Borrow excavation consists of the excavation and
 utilization of material from authorized borrow pits, including only material that is suitable for the
 construction of roadway embankments or of other embankments covered by the Contract.
 A Cost Savings Initiative Proposal (CSIP) submittal based on using
 borrow material from within the project limits will not be considered.
 120-2.3 Subsoil Excavation: Subsoil excavation consists of the excavation and disposal
 of muck, clay, rock, or any other material that is unsuitable in its original position and that is
 excavated below the finished grading template. For stabilized bases and sand bituminous road
 mixes, consider the finished grading template as the top of the finished base, shoulders and
 slopes. For all other bases and rigid pavement, consider the finished grading template as the
 finished shoulder and slope lines and bottom of completed base or rigid pavement. For pond and
 ditches that identify the placement of a blanket material, consider the finished grading template
 as the bottom of the blanket material. Subsoil excavation also consists of the excavation of all
 suitable material within the above limits as necessary to excavate the unsuitable material.
 Consider the limits of subsoil excavation indicated in the Plans as being particularly variable, in
 accordance with the field conditions actually encountered.
 The quantity of material required to replace the excavated material and to raise
 the elevation of the roadway to the bottom of the template will be paid for under embankment or
 borrow excavation (Truck Measure).
 120-2.4 Lateral Ditch Excavation: Lateral ditch excavation consists of all excavation of
 inlet and outlet ditches to structures and roadway, changes in channels of streams, and ditches
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 168
 
 parallel to the roadway right-of-way. Dress lateral ditches to the grade and cross-section shown
 in the Plans.
 120-2.5 Channel Excavation: Channel excavation consists of the excavation and
 satisfactory disposal of all materials from the limits of the channel as shown in the Plans.
 120-3 Preliminary Soils Investigations.
 When the Plans contain the results of a soil survey, do not assume such data is a
 guarantee of the depth, extent, or character of material present.
 120-4 Removal of Unsuitable Materials and Existing Roads.
 120-4.1 Subsoil Excavation: Where muck, rock, clay, or other material within the limits
 of the roadway is unsuitable in its original position, excavate such material to the cross-sections
 shown in the Plans or indicated by the Engineer, and backfill with suitable material. Shape
 backfill material to the required cross-sections. Where the removal of plastic soils below the
 finished earthwork grade is required, meet a construction tolerance, from the lines shown in the
 Plans as the removal limits, of plus or minus 0.2 feet in depth and plus or minus 6 inches (each
 side) in width.
 120-4.2 Construction over Existing Old Road: Where a new roadway is to be
 constructed over an old one, plow or scarify the old road, and break it up full width, regardless of
 height of fill. If the Plans provide that paving materials may be incorporated into the fill,
 distribute such material in a manner so as not to create voids. Recompact the old road meeting
 the requirements of 120-10.2.
 120-4.3 Obliterating Old Road: Where the Plans call for obliteration of portions of an
 old road outside of the proposed new roadway, obliterate such sections of the old road by
 grading to fill ditches and to restore approximately the original contour of the ground or a
 contour which produces a pleasing appearance.
 120-5 Disposal of Surplus and Unsuitable Material.
 120-5.1 Ownership of Excavated Materials: Dispose of surplus and excavated
 materials as shown in the Plans or, if the Plans do not indicate the method of disposal, take
 ownership of the materials and dispose of them outside the right-of-way.
 120-5.2 Disposal of Muck on Side Slopes: As an exception to the provisions of 120-5. 1,
 when approved by the Engineer, in rural undeveloped areas, the Contractor may place muck (A-8
 material) on the slopes, or store it alongside the roadway, provided there is a clear distance of at
 least 6 feet between the roadway grading limits and the muck, and the Contractor dresses the
 muck to present a neat appearance. In addition, the Contractor may also dispose of this material
 by placing it on the slopes in developed areas where, in the opinion of the Engineer, this will
 result in an aesthetically pleasing appearance and will have no detrimental effect on the adjacent
 developments. Where the Engineer permits the disposal of muck or other unsuitable material
 inside the right-of-way limits, do not place such material in a manner which will impede the
 inflow or outfall of any channel or side ditches. The Engineer will determine the limits adjacent
 to channels within which such materials may be disposed.
 120-5.3 Disposal of Paving Materials: Unless otherwise noted, take ownership of
 paving materials, such as paving brick, asphalt block, concrete slab, sidewalk, curb and gutter,
 etc., excavated in the removal of existing pavements, and dispose of them outside the right-ofway. If the materials are to remain the property of the Department, place them in neat piles as
 directed. Existing limerock base that is removed may be incorporated in the stabilized portion of
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 169
 
 the subgrade. If the construction sequence will allow, incorporate all existing limerock base into
 the project as allowed by the Contract Documents.
 120-5.4 Disposal Areas: Where the Contract Documents require disposal of excavated
 materials outside the right-of-way, and the disposal area is not indicated in the Contract
 Documents, furnish the disposal area without additional compensation.
 Provide areas for disposal of removed paving materials out of sight of the project
 and at least 300 feet from the nearest roadway right-of-way line of any State maintained road. If
 the materials are buried, disregard the 300 foot limitation.
 120-6 Borrow.
 120-6.1 Materials for Borrow: Do not open borrow pits until the Engineer has approved
 their location.
 Do not provide borrow materials that are polluted as defined in Chapter 376 of the
 Florida Statutes (oil of any kind and in any form, gasoline, pesticides, ammonia, chlorine, and
 derivatives thereof, excluding liquefied petroleum gas) in concentrations above any local, State,
 or Federal standards.
 Prior to placing any borrow material that is the product of soil incineration,
 provide the Engineer with a copy of the Certificate of Materials Recycling and Post Burn
 Analysis showing that the material is below all allowable pollutant concentrations.
 120-6.2 Furnishing of Borrow Areas: To obtain the Engineer’s approval to use an offsite construction activity area that involves excavation such as a borrow pit or local aggregate pit,
 request in writing, a review for -cultural resources involvement. Send the request to the Division
 of Historical Resources (DHR), Department of State, State Historic Preservation Officer,
 Tallahassee, FL. As a minimum, include in the request the Project Identification Number, the
 County, a description of the property with Township, Range, Section, etc., the dimensions of the
 area to be affected, and a location map. Do not start any work at the off-site construction activity
 area prior to receiving clearance from the DHR that no additional research is warranted.
 For certain locations, the DHR will require a Cultural Resources Assessment
 (CRA) Survey before approval can be granted. When this is required, secure professional
 archaeological services to complete an historical and archaeological survey report. Submit the
 report to the DHR and to the Department. The Engineer will determine final approval or
 rejection of off-site construction activity areas based on input from the DHR.
 Before receiving approval or before use of borrow areas, obtain written clearance
 from the Engineer concerning compliance with the Federal Endangered Species Act and other
 Wildlife Regulations as specified in 7-1.4 and Section 4(f) of the USDOT Act as specified in 71.8.
 The Department will adjust Contract Time in accordance with 8-7 for any
 suspension of operations required to comply with this Article. The Department will not accept
 any monetary claims due to delays or loss of off-site construction activity areas.
 Except where the Plans specifically call for the use of a particular borrow or
 dredging area, the Contractor may substitute borrow or dredging areas of his own choosing
 provided the Engineer determines the materials from such areas meet the Department’s standards
 and other requirements for stability for use in the particular sections of the work in which it is to
 be placed, and the Contractor absorbs any increase in hauling or other costs. Stake the corners of
 the proposed borrow area and provide the necessary equipment along with an operator in order
 for the Engineer to investigate the borrow area. The Engineer will determine test locations,
 collect samples, and perform tests to investigate the proposed borrow area based on soil strata
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 170
 
 and required soil properties. The Engineer will approve use of materials from the proposed area
 based on test results and project requirements. Final acceptance of materials will be based on
 Point of Use Test as described in 6-1.2.4.
 Before using any borrow material from any substitute areas, obtain the Engineer’s
 approval, in writing, for the use of the particular areas, and, where applicable, ensure that the
 Engineer has cross-sectioned the surface. Upon such written approval by the Engineer, consider
 the substitute areas as designated borrow areas.
 When furnishing the dredging or borrow areas, supply the Department with
 evidence that the necessary permits, rights, or waivers for the use of such areas have been
 secured.
 Do not excavate any part of a Contractor furnished borrow area which is less than
 300 feet from the right-of-way of the project or any State Road until the Engineer has approved a
 plan for landscaping and restoring the disturbed area. Perform this landscaping and land
 restoration at no expense to the Department, prior to final acceptance of the project. Do not
 provide a borrow area closer than 25 feet to the right-of-way of any state road. In Department
 furnished borrow pits, do not excavate material within 5 feet of adjacent property lines.
 Upon completion of excavation, neatly shape, dress, grass, vegetate, landscape,
 and drain all exposed areas including haul roads, as necessary so as not to present an
 objectionable appearance.
 Meet the requirements of Section 104 when furnishing borrow areas, regardless of
 location.
 120-6.3 Borrow Material for Shoulder Build-up: When so indicated in the Plans,
 furnish borrow material with a specific minimum bearing value, for building up of existing
 shoulders. Blend materials as necessary to achieve this specified minimum bearing value prior to
 placing the materials on the shoulders. Take samples of this borrow material at the pit or blended
 stockpile. Include all costs of providing a material with the required bearing value in the Contract
 unit price for borrow material.
 120-6.4 Haul Routes for Borrow Pits: Provide and maintain, at no expense to the
 Department, all necessary roads for hauling the borrow material. Where borrow area haul roads
 or trails are used by others, do not cause such roads or trails to deteriorate in condition.
 Arrange for the use of all non-public haul routes crossing the property of any
 railroad. Incur any expense for the use of such haul routes. Establish haul routes which will
 direct construction vehicles away from developed areas when feasible, and keep noise from
 hauling operations to a minimum. Advise the Engineer in writing of all proposed haul routes.
 120-6.5 Authorization for Use of Borrow: When the item of borrow excavation is
 included in the Contract, use borrow only when sufficient quantities of suitable material are not
 available from roadway and drainage excavation, to properly construct the embankment,
 subgrade, and shoulders, and to complete the backfilling of structures. Do not use borrow
 material until so ordered by the Engineer, and then only use material from approved borrow pits.
 120-7 Materials for Embankment.
 120-7.1 Use of Materials Excavated from the Roadway and Appurtenances: Assume
 responsibility for determining the suitability of excavated material for use on the project in
 accordance with the applicable Contract Documents. Consider the sequence of work and
 maintenance of traffic phasing in the determination of the availability of this material.
 120-7.2 General Requirements for Embankment Materials: Construct embankments
 of acceptable material including reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP), recycled concrete aggregate

 171
 
 (RCA) and portland cement concrete rubble, but containing no muck, stumps, roots, brush,
 vegetable matter, rubbish, reinforcement bar or other material that does not compact into a
 suitable and enduring roadbed. Do not use RAP or RCA in the top 3 feet of slopes and shoulders
 that are to be grassed or have other type of vegetation established. Do not use RAP or RCA in
 stormwater management facility fill slopes.
 Remove all waste material designated as undesirable. Use material in
 embankment construction in accordance with plan details or as the Engineer directs.
 Complete the embankment using maximum particle sizes (in any dimension) as
 follows:
 1. In top 12 inches: 3-1/2 inches (in any dimension).
 2. 12 to 24 inches: 6 inches (in any dimension).
 3. In the depth below 24 inches: not to exceed 12 inches (in any
 dimension) or the compacted thickness of the layer being placed, whichever is less.
 Spread all material so that the larger particles are separated from each other to
 minimize voids between them during compaction. Compact around these rocks in accordance
 with 120-9.2.
 When and where approved by the Engineer, the Contractor may place larger rocks
 (not to exceed 18 inches in any dimension) outside the one to two slope and at least 4 feet or
 more below the bottom of the base. Compact around these rocks to a firmness equal to that of the
 supporting soil. Construct grassed embankment areas in accordance with 120-9.2.5. Where
 constructing embankments adjacent to bridge end bents or abutments, do not place rock larger
 than 3-1/2 inches in diameter within 3 feet of the location of any end-bent piling.
 120-7.3 Materials Used at Pipes, Culverts, etc.: Construct embankments over and
 around pipes, culverts, and bridge foundations with selected materials.
 120-8 Embankment Construction.
 120-8.1 General: Construct embankments in sections of not less than 300 feet in length
 or for the full length of the embankment. Do not construct another LOT over an untested LOT
 without the Engineer’s approval in writing.
 For construction of mainline pavement lanes, turn lanes, ramps, parking lots,
 concrete box culverts and retaining wall systems, a LOT is defined as a single lift of finished
 embankment not to exceed 500 feet.
 For construction of shoulder-only areas, shared use paths, and sidewalks areas, a
 LOT is defined as a single lift of finished embankment not to exceed 2000 feet.
 Isolated compaction operations will be considered as separate LOTs. For multiple
 phase construction, a LOT shall not extend beyond the limits of the phase.
 120-8.2 Dry Fill Method:
 120-8.2.1 General: Construct embankments to meet the compaction requirements
 in 120-9 and in accordance with the acceptance program requirements in 120-10.
 As far as practicable, distribute traffic over the work during the
 construction of embankments so as to cover the maximum area of the surface of each layer.
 Construct embankment using the dry fill method whenever normal
 dewatering equipment and methods can accomplish the needed dewatering.
 120-8.2.1.1 Maximum Compacted Lift Thickness Requirements:
 Construct the embankment in successive layers with lifts up to a maximum listed in the table
 below based on the embankment material classification group.

 120-8.2.1.2 Thick Lift Requirements: For embankment materials
 classified as Group 2 in the table above, the option to perform thick lift construction in
 successive layers of not more than 12 inches compacted thickness may be used after meeting the
 following requirements:
 1. Notify the Engineer and obtain approval in writing prior
 to beginning construction of a test section.
 a. Demonstrate the possession and control of
 compacting equipment sufficient to achieve density required by 120-10.2 for the full depth of a
 thicker lift.
 2. Construct a test section of the length of one full LOT of
 not less than 500 feet.
 3. Perform five Quality Control (QC) tests at random
 locations within the test section.
 a. All five QC tests and a Department Verification
 test must meet the density required by 120-10.2.
 b. Identify the test section with the compaction
 effort and soil classification in the Department’s Earthwork Records System (ERS).
 4. Obtain Engineer’s approval in writing for the
 compaction effort after completing a successful test section.
 In case of a change in compaction effort or soil classification,
 failing QC test or when the QC tests cannot be verified, construct a new test section. The
 Contractor may elect to place material in 6 inches compacted thickness at any time. Construct all
 layers approximately parallel to the centerline profile of the road.
 The Engineer reserves the right to terminate the Contractor’s use of
 thick lift construction. Whenever the Engineer determines that the Contractor is not achieving
 satisfactory results, revert to the 6 inch compacted lifts.
 120-8.2.1.3 Equipment and Methods: Provide normal dewatering
 equipment including, but not limited to, surface pumps, sump pumps and trenching/digging
 machinery. Provide normal dewatering methods including, but not limited to, constructing
 shallow surface drainage trenches/ditches, using sand blankets, sumps and siphons.
 When normal dewatering does not adequately remove the water,
 the Engineer may require the embankment material to be placed in the water or on low swampy
 ground in accordance with 120-9.2.3.
 120-8.2.2 Placing in Unstable Areas: When depositing fill material in water, or
 on low swampy ground that will not support the weight of hauling equipment, construct the
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 173
 
 embankment by dumping successive loads in a uniformly distributed layer of a thickness not
 greater than necessary to support the hauling equipment while placing subsequent layers. Once
 sufficient material has been placed so that the hauling equipment can be supported, construct the
 remaining portion of the embankment in layers in accordance with the applicable provisions of
 120-9.2.2.
 120-8.2.3 Placing on Steep Slopes: When constructing an embankment on a
 hillside sloping more than 20 degrees from the horizontal, before starting the fill, deeply plow or
 cut steps into the surface of the original ground on which the embankment is to be placed.
 120-8.2.4 Placing Outside the Standard Minimum Slope: The standard
 minimum slope is defined as the plane described by a one (vertical) to two (horizontal) slope
 downward from the roadway shoulder point or the gutter line, in accordance with Standard Plans,
 Index 120-001 and 120-002. Where material that is unsuitable for normal embankment
 construction is to be used in the embankment outside the standard minimum slope, place such
 material in layers of not more than 18 inches in thickness, measured loose. The Contractor may
 also place material which is suitable for normal embankment, outside such standard minimum
 slope, in 18 inch layers. Maintain a constant thickness for suitable material placed within and
 outside the standard minimum slope, unless placing in a separate operation.
 120-8.3 Hydraulic Method:
 120-8.3.1 Method of Placing: When the hydraulic method is used, as far as
 practicable, place all dredged material in its final position in the embankment by such method.
 Place and compact any dredged material that is reworked, or moved and placed in its final
 position by any other method, as specified in 120-9.2. Baffles or any other form of construction
 may be used if the slopes of the embankments are not steeper than indicated in the Plans.
 Remove all timber used for temporary bulkheads or baffles from the embankment, and fill and
 thoroughly compact all voids. When placing fill on submerged land, construct dikes prior to
 beginning of dredging, and maintain the dikes throughout the dredging operation.
 120-8.3.2 Excess Material: Do not use any excess material placed outside the
 prescribed slopes or below the normal high-water table to raise the fill areas. Remove only the
 portion of this material required for dressing the slopes.
 120-8.3.3 Protection of Openings in Embankment: Leave openings in the
 embankments at the bridge sites. Remove any material which invades these openings or existing
 channels without additional compensation to provide the same existing channel depth as before
 the construction of the embankment. Do not excavate or dredge any material within 200 feet of
 the toe of the proposed embankment.
 120-8.4 Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) Method:
 120-8.4.1 General: Use only RAP material stored at facilities with an approved
 Florida Department of Environmental Protection Stormwater permit or, transferred directly from
 a milling project to the Department project. Certify the source if RAP material is from an
 identifiable Department project. Do not use RAP material in the following areas: construction
 areas that are below the seasonal high groundwater table elevation; MSE Wall backfill;
 underneath MSE Walls or the top 6 inches of embankment.
 Prior to placement, submit documentation to the Engineer for his approval,
 outlining the proposed location of the RAP material.
 120-8.4.2 Soil and RAP Mixture: Place the RAP material at the location and
 spread uniformly, using approved methods to obtain a maximum layer thickness of 4 inches. Mix
 this 4 inches maximum layer of RAP with a loose soil layer 8 to 10 inches thick. After mixing,
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 174
 
 meet all embankment utilization requirements of Standard Plans, Index 120-001 for the location
 used. The total RAP and other embankment material shall not exceed 12 inches per lift after
 mixing and compaction if the contractor can demonstrate that the density of the mixture can be
 achieved. Perform mixing using rotary tillers or other equipment meeting the approval of the
 Engineer. The Engineer will determine the order in which to spread the two materials. Mix both
 materials to the full depth. Ensure that the finished layer will have the thickness and shape
 required by the typical section. Demonstrate the feasibility of this construction method by
 successfully completing a 500 foot long test section.
 120-8.4.3 Alternate Soil and RAP Layer Construction: Construct soil in 6 to
 12 inch compacted lifts and RAP in alternate layers with 6 inch maximum compacted lifts. Use
 soil with a minimum LBR value of 40 to prevent failure during compaction of the overlying RAP
 layer. Demonstrate the feasibility of this construction method by successfully completing a
 500 foot long test section.
 120-9 Compaction Requirements.
 120-9.1 Moisture Content: Compact the materials at a moisture content such that the
 specified density can be attained. If necessary to attain the specified density, add water to the
 material, or lower the moisture content by manipulating the material or allowing it to dry, as is
 appropriate.
 120-9.2 Compaction of Embankments:
 120-9.2.1 General: Uniformly compact each layer, using equipment that will
 achieve the required density, and as compaction operations progress, shape and manipulate each
 layer as necessary to ensure uniform density throughout the embankment.
 120-9.2.2 Compaction Over Unstable Foundations: Where the embankment
 material is deposited in water or on low swampy ground, and in a layer thicker than 12 inches (as
 provided in 120-8.2.2), compact the top 6 inches (compacted thickness) of such layer to the
 density as specified in 120-10.2.
 120-9.2.3 Compaction Where Plastic Material Has Been Removed: Where
 unsuitable material is removed and the remaining surface is of the A-4, A-5, A-6, or A-7 Soil
 Groups (see AASHTO M145), as determined by the Engineer, compact the surface of the
 excavated area by rolling with a sheepsfoot roller exerting a compression of at least 250 psi on
 the tamper feet, for the full width of the roadbed (subgrade and shoulders). Perform rolling
 before beginning any backfill, and continue until the roller feet do not penetrate the surface more
 than 1 inch. Do not perform such rolling where the remaining surface is below the normal water
 table and covered with water. Vary the procedure and equipment required for this operation at
 the discretion of the Engineer.
 120-9.2.4 Compaction of Grassed Shoulder Areas: For the upper 6 inch layer
 of all shoulders which are to be grassed, since no specific density is required, compact only to
 the extent directed.
 120-9.2.5 Compaction of Grassed Embankment Areas: Do not compact the
 outer layers of any embankments where plant growth will be established. Leave this layer in a
 loose condition to a minimum depth of 6 inches for the subsequent seeding or planting
 operations. Do not place RAP or RAP blended material within the top 12 inches of areas to be
 grassed.
 120-9.3 Compaction for Pipes, Culverts, etc.: Compact the backfill of trenches to the
 densities specified for embankment or subgrade, as applicable, and in accordance with the
 requirements of 125-9.2.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 175
 
 Thoroughly compact embankments over and around pipes, culverts, and bridges
 in a manner which will not place undue stress on the structures, and in accordance with the
 requirements of 125-9.2.
 120-9.4 Compaction of Subgrade: If the Plans do not provide for stabilizing, compact
 the subgrade as defined in 1-3 in both cuts and fills, to the density specified in 120-10.2. For cut
 areas, determine Standard Proctor Maximum Density in accordance with FM 1-T099 at a
 frequency of one per mile or when there is a change in soil type, whichever occurs first. For
 undisturbed soils, do not apply density requirements where constructing paved shoulders 5 feet
 or less in width.
 Where trenches for widening strips are not of sufficient width to permit the use of
 standard compaction equipment, perform compaction using vibratory rollers, trench rollers, or
 other type compaction equipment approved by the Engineer.
 Maintain the required density until the base or pavement is placed on the
 subgrade.
 120-10 Acceptance Program.
 120-10.1 General Requirements:
 120-10.1.1 Initial Equipment Comparison: Before initial production, perform
 an initial nuclear moisture density gauge comparison with the Verification and Independent
 Assurance (IA) gauges. When comparing the computed dry density of one nuclear gauge to a
 second gauge, three sets of calculations must be performed (IA to QC, IA to Verification, and
 QC to Verification). Ensure that the difference between any two computed dry densities does not
 exceed 2 lb/ft3 between gauges from the same manufacturer, and 3 lb/ft3 between gauges from
 different manufacturers. Repair or replace any gauge that does not compare favorably with the
 IA gauge.
 Perform a comparison analysis between the QC nuclear gauge and the
 Verification nuclear gauge any time a nuclear gauge or repaired nuclear gauge is first brought to
 the project. Repair and replace any QC gauge that does not compare favorably with the
 Verification gauge at any time during the remainder of the project. Calibrate all QC gauges
 annually.
 120-10.1.2 Initial Production LOT: Before construction of any production LOT,
 prepare a 500 foot initial control section consisting of one full LOT. Notify the Engineer in
 writing at least 24 hours prior to production of the initial control section. Perform all QC tests
 required in 120-10.1.4. When the initial QC test results pass specifications, the Engineer will
 perform a Verification test to verify compliance with the specifications. Do not begin
 constructing another LOT until successfully completing the initial production LOT. The
 Engineer will notify the Contractor in writing of the initial production LOT approval within three
 working days after receiving the Contractor’s QC data when test results meet the following
 conditions:
 1. QC and Verification tests must meet the density requirements.
 2. Difference between QC and Verification computed dry density
 results shall meet the requirements of 120-10.1.1.
 If Verification test result fails the density requirements of 120-10.2,
 correct the areas of non-compliance. The QC and Verification tests will then be repeated.
 120-10.1.3 Density over 105%: When a QC computed dry density results in a
 value greater than 105% of the applicable Proctor maximum dry density, the Engineer will
 perform an Independent Verification (IV) density test within 5 feet. If the IV density results in a
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 176
 
 value greater than 105%, the Engineer will investigate the compaction methods, examine the
 applicable Standard Proctor Maximum Density and material description. The Engineer may
 collect and test an IV Standard Proctor Maximum Density sample for acceptance in accordance
 with the criteria of 120-10.2.
 120-10.1.4 Quality Control (QC) Tests:
 120-10.1.4.1 Standard Proctor Maximum Density Determination:
 Determine the QC standard Proctor maximum density and optimum moisture content by
 sampling and testing the material in accordance with the specified test method listed in 120-10.2.
 120-10.1.4.2 Density Testing Requirements: Ensure compliance to the
 requirements of 120-10.2 by Nuclear Density testing in accordance with FM 1-T238. Determine
 the in-place moisture content for each density test. Use FM 1-T238, FM 5-507 (Determination of
 Moisture Content by Means of a Calcium Carbide Gas Pressure Moisture Tester), or ASTM D4643 (Laboratory Determination of Moisture Content of Granular Soils by use of a Microwave
 Oven) for moisture determination.
 120-10.1.4.3 Soil Classification: Perform soil classification tests on the
 sample collected in 120-10.1.4.1, in accordance with AASHTO T88, T89, T90, and FM 1-T267.
 Classify soils in accordance with AASHTO M145 in order to determine compliance with
 embankment utilization requirements as specified in Standard Plans, Index 120-001.
 120-10.1.5 Department Verification: The Engineer will conduct Verification
 tests in order to accept all materials and work associated with 120-10.1.4. The Engineer will
 verify the QC results if they meet the Verification Comparison Criteria, otherwise the Engineer
 will implement Resolution procedures.
 The Engineer will select test locations, including Station, Offset, and Lift,
 using a random number generator, based on the LOTs under consideration. Each Verification test
 evaluates all work represented by the QC testing completed in those LOTs.
 In addition to the Verification testing, the Engineer may perform
 additional Independent Verification (IV) testing. The Engineer will evaluate and act upon the IV
 test results in the same manner as Verification test results.
 When the project requires less than four QC tests per material type, the
 Engineer reserves the right to accept the materials and work through visual inspection.
 120-10.1.6 Reduced Testing Frequency: Obtain the Engineer’s written approval
 for the option to reduce density testing frequency to one test every two LOTs if Resolution
 testing was not required for 12 consecutive verified LOTs, or if Resolution testing was required,
 but the QC test data was upheld and all substantiating tests are recorded in the Earthwork
 Records System (ERS).
 Generate random numbers based on the two LOTs under consideration.
 When QC test frequency is reduced to one every two LOTs, obtain the Engineer’s approval to
 place more than one LOT over an untested LOT. Assure similar compaction efforts for the
 untested LOTs. If the Verification test fails, and QC test data is not upheld by Resolution testing,
 the QC testing will revert to the original frequency of one QC test per LOT. Do not apply
 reduced testing frequency in construction of shoulder-only areas, shared use paths, sidewalks,
 and first and last lift.
 120-10.1.7 Payment for Resolution Tests: If the Resolution laboratory results
 compare favorably with the QC results, the Department will pay for Resolution testing. No
 additional compensation, either monetary or time, will be made for the impacts of any such
 testing.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 177
 
 If the Resolution laboratory results do not compare favorably with the QC
 results, the costs of the Resolution testing will be deducted from monthly estimates. No
 additional time will be granted for the impacts of any such testing.
 120-10.2 Acceptance Criteria: Obtain a minimum QC density of 100% of the standard
 Proctor maximum density as determined by FM 1-T099, Method C, with the following
 exceptions: embankment constructed by the hydraulic method as specified in 120-8.3; material
 placed outside the standard minimum slope as specified in 120-8.2.4 except when a structure is
 supported on existing embankment; and, other areas specifically excluded herein.
 120-10.3 Additional Requirements:
 120-10.3.1 Frequency: Conduct QC sampling and testing at a minimum
 frequency listed in the table below. The Engineer will perform Verification sampling and tests at
 a minimum frequency listed in the table below.

 notepads or worksheets to record data for later transfer to the Density Log Book. Notify the
 Engineer upon successful completion of QC testing on each LOT prior to placing another lift on
 top.
 120-10.4 Verification Comparison Criteria and Resolution Procedures:
 120-10.4.1 Standard Proctor Maximum Density Determination: The Engineer
 will verify the QC results if the results compare within 4.5 lb/ft3 of the Verification test result.
 Otherwise, the Engineer will take one additional sample of material from the soil type in
 question. The State Materials Office (SMO) or an AASHTO accredited laboratory designated by
 the SMO will perform Resolution testing. The material will be sampled and tested in accordance
 with FM 1-T099, Method C.
 The Engineer will compare the Resolution test results with the QC test
 results. If all Resolution test results are within 4.5 lb/ft3 of the corresponding QC test results, the
 Engineer will use the QC test results for material acceptance purposes for each LOT with that
 soil type. If the Resolution test result is not within 4.5 lb/ft3 of the Contractor’s QC test, the
 Verification test result will be used for material acceptance purposes.
 120-10.4.2 Density Testing: When a Verification or IV density test fails the
 acceptance criteria, retest the site within a 5 foot radius and the following actions will be taken:
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 178
 
 1. If the QC retest meets the acceptance criteria and meets the 12010.1.1 criteria when compared with the Verification or IV test, the Engineer will accept those
 LOTs.
 2. If the QC retest does not meet the acceptance criteria and
 compares favorably with the Verification or IV test, rework and retest the LOT. The Engineer
 will re-verify those LOTs.
 3. If the QC retest and the Verification or IV test do not compare
 favorably, complete a new comparison analysis as defined in 120-10.1.1. Once acceptable
 comparison is achieved, retest the LOTs. The Engineer will perform new verification testing.
 Acceptance testing will not begin on a new LOT until the Contractor has a gauge that meets the
 comparison requirements.
 Record QC test results in the density logbook on approved Department
 forms provided by the Engineer. Submit the original, completed density logbook to the Engineer
 at final acceptance.
 120-10.4.3 Soil Classification: The Engineer will verify the QC test results if the
 Verification and the QC test results both match the soil utilization symbol listed in Standard
 Plans, Index 120-001. Otherwise, the Engineer will test the sample retained for Resolution
 testing. The SMO or an AASHTO accredited laboratory designated by the SMO will perform the
 Resolution testing. The material will be sampled and tested in accordance with AASHTO T88,
 T89, and T90, and classified in accordance with AASHTO M145.
 The Engineer will compare the Resolution test results with the QC test
 results. If the Resolution test matches the QC soil utilization symbol, the Engineer will use the
 QC soil utilization symbol for material acceptance purposes. If the Resolution test result does not
 match the Contractor’s QC soil utilization symbol, the Verification test results will be used for
 material acceptance purposes.
 120-10.4.4 Organic Content: The Engineer will verify the QC test results if the
 Verification test results satisfy the organic content test criteria in Standard Plans, Index 120-001.
 Otherwise, the Engineer will test the sample retained for Resolution testing. The SMO or an
 AASHTO accredited laboratory designated by the SMO will perform Resolution testing. The
 material will be sampled and tested in accordance with FM 1-T267. If the Resolution test results
 satisfy the required criteria, material of that soil type will be verified and accepted. If the
 Resolution test results do not meet the required criteria, reject the material and reconstruct with
 acceptable material.
 120-10.5 Disposition of Defective Materials: Assume responsibility for removing and
 replacing all defective material, as defined in Section 6.
 Alternately, submit an Engineering Analysis Scope in accordance with 6-4 to
 determine the disposition of the material.
 120-11 Maintenance and Protection of Work.
 While construction is in progress, maintain adequate drainage for the roadbed at all times.
 Maintain a shoulder at least 3 feet wide adjacent to all pavement or base construction in order to
 provide support for the edges.
 Maintain all earthwork construction throughout the life of the Contract, and take all
 reasonable precautions to prevent loss of material from the roadway due to the action of wind or
 water. Repair, at no expense to the Department except as otherwise provided herein, any slides,
 washouts, settlement, subsidence, or other mishap which may occur prior to final acceptance of

 179
 
 the work. Perform maintenance and protection of earthwork construction in accordance with
 Section 104.
 Maintain all channels excavated as a part of the Contract work against natural shoaling or
 other encroachments to the lines, grades, and cross-sections shown in the Plans, until final
 acceptance of the project.
 120-12 Construction.
 120-12.1 Construction Tolerances: Shape the surface of the earthwork to conform to
 the lines, grades, and cross-sections shown in the Plans. In final shaping of the surface of
 earthwork, maintain a tolerance of 0.3 foot above or below the cross-section with the following
 exceptions:
 1. Shape the surface of shoulders to within 0.1 foot of the cross-section shown in
 the Plans.
 2. Shape the earthwork to match adjacent pavement, curb, sidewalk, structures,
 etc.
 3. Shape the bottom of conveyance ditches so that the ditch impounds no water.
 4. When the work does not include construction of base or pavement, shape the
 entire roadbed (shoulder point to shoulder point) to within 0.1 foot above or below the Plan
 cross-section.
 5. When the work includes permitted linear stormwater management facilities,
 shape the swales and ditch blocks to within 0.1 feet of the cross-section shown in the Plans.
 Ensure that the shoulder lines do not vary horizontally more than 0.3 foot from
 the true lines shown in the Plans.
 120-12.2 Operations Adjacent to Pavement: Carefully dress areas adjacent to
 pavement areas to avoid damage to such pavement. Complete grassing of shoulder areas prior to
 placing the final wearing course. Do not manipulate any embankment material on a pavement
 surface.
 When shoulder dressing is underway adjacent to a pavement lane being used to
 maintain traffic, exercise extreme care to avoid interference with the safe movement of traffic.
 120-13 Method of Measurement.
 120-13.1 General: When payment for excavation is on a volumetric basis, the quantity to
 be paid for will be the volume, in cubic yards, calculated by the method of average end areas,
 unless the Engineer determines that another method of calculation will provide a more accurate
 result. The material will be measured in its original position by field survey or by
 photogrammetric means as designated by the Engineer, unless otherwise specified under the
 provisions for individual items.
 Where subsoil excavation extends outside the lines shown in the Plans or
 authorized by the Engineer including allowable tolerances, and the space is backfilled with
 material obtained in additional authorized roadway or borrow excavation, the net fill, plus
 shrinkage allowance, will be deducted from the quantity of roadway excavation or borrow
 excavation to be paid for, as applicable.
 The quantity of all material washed, blown, or placed beyond the authorized
 roadway cross-section will be determined by the Engineer and will be deducted from the quantity
 of roadway excavation or borrow excavation to be paid for, as applicable.

 Subsoil excavation that extends outside the lines shown in the Plans or authorized
 by the Engineer including allowable tolerances will be deducted from the quantity to be paid for
 as subsoil excavation.
 120-13.2 Roadway Excavation: The measurement will include only the net volume of
 material excavated between the original ground surface and the surface of the completed
 earthwork, except that the measurement will also include all unavoidable slides which may occur
 in connection with excavation classified as roadway excavation.
 The pay quantity will be the plan quantity provided that the excavation was
 accomplished in substantial compliance with the plan dimensions and subject to the provisions of
 9-3.2 and 9-3.4. On designated 3-R Projects, regular excavation will be paid for at the Contract
 lump sum price provided that the excavation was accomplished in substantial compliance with
 the plan dimension.
 120-13.3 Borrow Excavation: Measurement will be made on a loose volume basis,
 measured in trucks or other hauling equipment at the point of dumping on the road. If
 measurement is made in vehicles, level the material to facilitate accurate measurement.
 Unsuitable material excavated from borrow pits where truck measurement is
 provided for and from any borrow pits furnished by the Contractor, will not be included in the
 quantity of excavation to be paid for.
 120-13.4 Lateral Ditch Excavation: The measurement will include only material
 excavated within the lines and grades indicated in the Plans or as directed by the Engineer. The
 measurement will include the full station-to-station length shown in the Plans or directed by the
 Engineer and acceptably completed. Excavation included for payment under Section 125 will not
 be included in this measurement.
 The pay quantity will be the plan quantity provided that the excavation was
 accomplished in substantial compliance with the plan dimensions and subject to the provisions of
 9-3.2 and 9-3.4.
 120-13.5 Channel Excavation: The measurement will include only material excavated
 within the lines and grades indicated in the Plans or in accordance with authorized Plan changes.
 The measurement will include the full station-to-station length shown in the Plans including any
 authorized changes thereto.
 If shoaling occurs subsequent to excavation of a channel and the Engineer
 authorized the shoaled material to remain in place, the volume of any such material remaining
 within the limits of channel excavation shown in the Plans will be deducted from the measured
 quantity of channel excavation.
 120-13.6 Subsoil Excavation: The measurement will include only material excavated
 within the lines and grades indicated in the Plans (including the tolerance permitted therefore) or
 as directed by the Engineer.
 When no item for subsoil excavation is shown in the Contract but subsoil
 excavation is subsequently determined to be necessary, such unanticipated subsoil excavation
 will be paid for as provided in 4-4.
 120-13.7 Embankment: The quantity will be at the plan quantity. Where payment for
 embankment is not to be included in the payment for the excavation, and is to be paid for on a
 cubic yard basis for the item of embankment, the plan quantities to be paid for will be calculated
 by the method of average end areas unless the Engineer determines that another method of
 calculation will provide a more accurate result. The measurement will include only material
 actually placed above the original ground line, within the lines and grades indicated in the Plans

 or directed by the Engineer. The length used in the computations will be the station-to-station
 length actually constructed. The original ground line used in the computations will be as
 determined prior to placing of embankment subject to the provisions of 9-3.2, and no allowance
 will be made for subsidence of material below the surface of the original ground.
 If there are authorized changes in plan dimensions or if errors in plan quantities
 are detected, plan quantity will be adjusted as provided in 9-3.2.
 Where the work includes excavation of unsuitable material below the finished
 grading template or original ground line, whichever is lower as defined in 120-3.3, the original
 ground line is defined as the surface prior to beginning excavation, except that this surface is not
 outside the permissible tolerance of lines and grades for subsoil excavation as indicated in the
 Plans or as directed by the Engineer. Any overrun or underrun of plan quantity for subsoil
 excavation which results in a corresponding increase or decrease in embankment will be
 considered as an authorized plan change for adjustment purposes as defined in 9-3.2.2.
 No payment will be made for embankment material used to replace unsuitable
 material excavated beyond the lines and grades shown in the Plans or ordered by the Engineer.
 In no case will payment be made for material allowed to run out of the
 embankment on a flatter slope than indicated on the cross-section. The Contractor shall make his
 own estimate on the volume of material actually required to obtain the pay section.

 SECTION 125
 EXCAVATION FOR STRUCTURES AND PIPE
 125-1 Description.
 Excavate for box culverts, pipes, retaining walls, headwalls for pipes and drains, catch
 basins, drop inlets, manholes, and similar structures. Construct and remove cofferdams, sheeting,
 bracing, etc.; pump or otherwise dewater foundations; remove and dispose of any existing
 structures or portions of structures not covered by other items in the Contract, including
 foundations, abutments, piers, wings, and all other materials, obstructions, etc., found necessary
 to clear the site for the proposed work; backfill, dispose of surplus material, and perform final
 cleaning, as may be necessary for the proper execution of the work. This Section does not
 include excavation for bases or pavements, curbs, curb and gutter, valley gutter, ditch pavement,
 or rubble gutter.
 125-1.1 Trench Excavation Safety System and Shoring, Special (Trench
 Excavation): When performing trench excavation in excess of 5 feet in depth, comply with the
 Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) trench safety standards, 29 CFR 1926,
 Subpart P, and all subsequent revisions or updates adopted by the Department of Labor and
 Employment Security. Ensure that trench boxes are wide enough to accommodate compaction
 and density testing.
 Submission of bid and subsequent execution of the Contract will serve as
 certification that all trench excavation in excess of 5 feet in depth will be in compliance with
 Section 553.62, Florida Statutes.
 Consider all available geotechnical information when designing the trench
 excavation safety system.
 Consider these and any more stringent trench safety standards as minimum
 Contract requirements.
 125-2 Classification.
 Consider all materials excavated as unclassified and as excavation regardless of the
 material encountered.
 125-3 Cofferdams.
 125-3.1 Construction:
 125-3.1.1 Methods: Construct all foundations by open excavation, and shore,
 brace, or protect the foundation openings with cofferdams. Provide cofferdams or cribs for
 foundation construction below the bottom of the footings. Provide sufficient clearance in the
 cofferdam interiors to permit construction of forms and inspection of their exteriors, and for
 pumping equipment.
 125-3.1.2 Protection of Concrete: Construct cofferdams to protect green
 concrete against damage from a sudden rising of the water and to prevent damage by erosion. Do
 not leave timber or bracing in cofferdams or cribs that extend into the substructure masonry
 except where permitted in writing by the Engineer.
 125-3.1.3 Placing in the Dry: For placing footings in the dry, the Engineer may
 require cofferdam sheeting to be driven to an elevation 6 feet below the elevation of the bottom
 of the footings and require sufficient pumping equipment to dewater and maintain the cofferdam
 in a comparatively dry condition.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 188
 
 125-3.1.4 Working Drawings: For substructure work, submit drawings showing
 the proposed method of cofferdam construction and other details left to choice or not fully shown
 in the Plans. Obtain the Engineer’s approval of the type and clearance of cofferdams, insofar as
 such details affect the character of the finished work. For other details of design that do not affect
 the character of the finished work, assume responsibility for the successful construction of the
 work. Retain a Professional Engineer, registered in the State of Florida, to prepare the above
 construction drawing, and keep a signed and sealed copy on hand at the site at all times.
 125-3.2 Removal: Unless otherwise provided, remove cofferdams or cribs, with all
 sheeting and bracing, after completion of the substructure without disturbing or marring the
 finished masonry.
 125-4 Excavation.
 125-4.1 Requirements for all Excavation: Perform all excavation to foundation
 materials, satisfactory to the Engineer, regardless of the elevation shown in the Plans. Remove
 rock, boulders or other hard lumpy or unyielding material to a depth of 12 inches below the
 bottom of pipes and box culverts elevations. Remove muck or other soft material to the depth
 indicated in the Plans or as directed by the Engineer.
 125-4.2 Earth Excavation:
 125-4.2.1 Foundation Material other than the Rock: When masonry is to rest
 on an excavated surface other than rock, take special care to avoid disturbing the bottom of the
 excavation, and do not remove the final foundation material to grade until just before placing the
 masonry. In case the foundation material is soft or mucky, the Engineer may require excavation
 to a greater depth and to backfill to grade with approved material.
 125-4.2.2 Foundation Piles: Where foundation piles are used, complete the
 excavation of each pit before driving the piles. After the driving is completed, remove all loose
 and displaced material, leaving a smooth, solid, and level bed to receive the masonry.
 125-4.2.3 Removal of Obstructions: Remove boulders, logs, or any unforeseen
 obstacles encountered in excavating. Compensation will be in accordance with the requirements
 of 4-3.
 125-4.3 Rock Excavation: Clean all rock and other hard foundation material, remove all
 loose material, and cut all rock to a firm surface. Either level, step vertically and horizontally, or
 serrate the rock, as may be directed by the Engineer. Clean out all seams, and fill them with
 concrete or mortar.
 125-4.4 Pipe Trench Excavation: Excavate trenches for pipes to the elevation of the
 bottom of the pipe and to a width sufficient to provide adequate working room. Remove soil not
 meeting the classification specified as suitable backfill material in 125-8.3.2.2, to a depth of
 4 inches below the bottom of the pipe elevation. Where the soils permit, ensure that the trench
 sides are vertical up to at least the mid-point of the pipe.
 For pipe lines placed above the natural ground line, place and compact the
 embankment, prior to excavation of the trench, to an elevation at least 2 feet above the top of the
 pipe and to a width equal to four pipe diameters, and then excavate the trench to the required
 grade.
 For pipe trenches utilizing trench boxes, ensure that the trench box used is of
 sufficient width to permit thorough tamping of bedding material under and around the pipes as
 specified in 125-8.1.6.
 Do not disturb the installed pipe and its embedment when moving trench boxes.
 Move the trench box carefully to avoid excavated wall displacement or damage. As the trench
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 189
 
 box is moved, fill any voids left by the trench box and continuously place and compact the
 backfill material adjacent to and all along the side of the trench box walls to fill any voids
 created by the trench box.
 125-5 Preservation of Channel.
 125-5.1 General: Unless shown in the Plans, do not excavate outside of caissons, cribs,
 cofferdams, or sheet piling, and do not disturb the natural stream bed adjacent to the structure. If
 excavating or dredging at the site of the structure before sinking caissons, cribs, or cofferdams,
 complete the foundation and backfill all such excavations to the original ground surface or other
 required elevation, with material satisfactory to the Engineer.
 125-5.2 Removal of Excavated Materials: Do not allow materials that are deposited
 adjacent to the stream area to infiltrate the water areas. Leave the stream in its original condition.
 125-6 Disposal of Surplus.
 Use suitable excavated materials for backfilling over or around the structure. Dispose of
 unsuitable materials. Meet the disposal requirements pertaining to water pollution contained in
 Section 104 and in 7-1.1.
 125-7 Pumping.
 Pump from the interior of any foundation enclosure in such manner as to preclude the
 possibility of any portion of the concrete materials being carried away. Do not pump while
 placing concrete, or for a period of at least 24 hours thereafter, unless using a suitable pump
 separated from the concrete work by a watertight wall.
 125-8 Backfilling.
 125-8.1 General Requirements for Structures and Pipe:
 125-8.1.1 General: Backfill in the dry whenever normal dewatering equipment
 and methods can accomplish the needed dewatering. A LOT is defined as one lift of backfill
 material placement, not to exceed 500 feet in length or a single run of pipe connecting two
 successive structures, whichever is less. Backfill for structures and pipe compacted in one
 operation will be considered as one LOT within the cover zone. Backfill around structures
 compacted separately from the pipe will be considered as separate LOTs. Backfill on each side
 of the pipe for the first lift will be considered a separate LOT. Backfill on opposite sides of the
 pipe for the remaining lifts will be considered separate LOTs, unless the same compactive effort
 is applied. Same compactive effort is defined as the same type of equipment (make and model)
 making the same number of passes on both sides of the pipe. For multiple phase backfill, a LOT
 shall not extend beyond the limits of the phase.
 When placing backfill within trench box each lift of backfill is considered
 a LOT. Placement of backfill within trench box limits will be considered a complete operation
 before trench box is moved for next backfill operation. When the trench box is moved for next
 backfill operation this will start new LOTs for each lift. Follow the density testing frequency in
 125-9.3.1.
 125-8.1.2 Equipment and Methods: Provide normal dewatering equipment
 including, but not limited to, surface pumps, sump pumps, wellpoints and header pipe and
 trenching/digging machinery. Provide normal dewatering methods including, but not limited to,
 constructing shallow surface drainage trenches/ditches, using sand blankets, perforated pipe
 drains, sumps and siphons.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 190
 
 125-8.1.3 Backfill Materials: Backfill to the original ground surface or subgrade
 surface of openings made for structures, with a sufficient allowance for settlement. The Engineer
 may require that the material used for this backfill be obtained from a source entirely apart from
 the structure. Use only material accepted by the Engineer.
 Do not allow heavy construction equipment to cross over culvert or storm
 sewer pipes until placing and compacting backfill material to the finished earthwork grade or to
 an elevation at least 4 feet above the crown of the pipe.
 125-8.1.4 Use of A-7 Material: In the backfilling of trenches, A-7 material may
 be used from a point 12 inches above the top of the pipe up to the elevation shown in the
 Standard Plans as the elevation for undercutting of A-7 material.
 125-8.1.5 Time of Placing Backfill: Do not place backfill against any masonry or
 concrete abutment, wingwall, or culvert until the Engineer has given permission to do so, and in
 no case until the masonry or concrete has been in place seven days or until the specified 28 day
 compressive strength occurs.
 125-8.1.6 Placement and Compaction: Place the material in horizontal layers
 not exceeding 6 inches compacted thickness, in depth above water level, behind abutments,
 wingwalls and end bents or end rest piers, under the haunches of the pipes and around box
 culverts and all structures including pipe culverts. When the backfill material is deposited in
 water, compact as specified in 125-8.2.5 and 125-8.3.4.
 125-8.1.6.1 Thick Lift Requirements: The Contractor may elect to place
 material in thicker lifts of no more than 12 inches compacted thickness above the Soil Envelope
 if the embankment material is classified as Group 1 in the table below. If the embankment
 material is classified as Group 2 in the table below and the Contractor chooses to place material
 in thicker lifts of no more than 12 inches compacted thickness above the soil envelope then the
 Contractor must demonstrate with a successful test section that density can be achieved. Thick
 lift around structures is only allowed above the soil envelope of the connecting pipe. Notify the
 Engineer in writing prior to beginning construction of a test section. Construct a test section of
 the length of one LOT. Perform five quality control (QC) tests at random locations within the
 test section. All five tests must meet the density required by 125-9.2 and be verified by the
 Department. Identify the test section with the compaction effort and soil classification in the Log
 Book. In case of a change in compaction effort or soil classification, construct a new test section.
 When a QC test fails the requirements of 125-9.2 or when the QC tests cannot be verified,
 construct a new test section. The Contractor may elect to place material in 6 inches compacted
 thickness at any time.

 125-8.2 Additional Requirements for Structures Other than Pipe:
 125-8.2.1 Density: Where the backfill material is deposited in water, obtain a
 12 inch layer of comparatively dry material, thoroughly compacted by tamping, before verifying
 the layer and density requirements. Meet the requirements of 125-9.2.
 125-8.2.2 Box Culverts: For box culverts over which pavement is to be
 constructed, compact around the structure to an elevation not less than 12 inches above the top of
 the structure, using rapid-striking mechanical tampers.
 125-8.2.3 Other Limited Areas: Compact in other limited areas using
 mechanical tampers or approved hand tampers, until the cover over the structure is at least
 12 inches thick. When hand tampers are used, deposit the materials in layers not more than
 4 inches thick using hand tampers suitable for this purpose with a face area of not more than
 100 square inches. Take special precautions to prevent any wedging action against the masonry,
 and step or terrace the slope bounding the excavation for abutments and wingwalls if required by
 the Engineer.
 125-8.2.4 Culverts and Piers: Backfill around culverts and piers on both sides
 simultaneously to approximately the same elevation.
 125-8.2.5 Compaction Under Wet Conditions: Where wet conditions do not
 permit the use of mechanical tampers, compact using hand tampers. Use only A-3 material for
 the hand tamped portions of the backfill. When the backfill has reached an elevation and
 condition such as to make the use of the mechanical tampers practical, perform mechanical
 tamping in such manner and to such extent as to transfer the compaction force into the sections
 previously tamped by hand.
 125-8.3 Additional Requirements for Pipe Greater than 12 Inches Inside Diameter:
 125-8.3.1 General: Trenches for pipe may have up to four zones that must be
 backfilled.
 Lowest Zone: The lowest zone is backfilled for deep undercuts up to
 within 4 inches of the bottom of the pipe.
 Bedding Zone: The zone above the lowest zone is the bedding zone.
 Usually it will be the backfill which is the 4 inches of soil below the bottom of the pipe. When
 rock or other hard material has been removed to place the pipe, the bedding zone will be the
 12 inches of soil below the bottom of the pipe.
 Cover Zone: The next zone is backfill that is placed after the pipe has been
 laid and will be called the cover zone. This zone extends to 12 inches above the top of the pipe.
 The cover zone and the bedding zone are considered the Soil Envelope for the pipe.
 Top Zone: The top zone extends from 12 inches above the top of the pipe
 to the base or final grade.
 125-8.3.2 Material:
 125-8.3.2.1 Lowest Zone: Backfill areas undercut below the bedding zone
 of a pipe with coarse sand, or other suitable granular material, obtained from the grading
 operations on the project, or a commercial material if no suitable material is available.

 192
 
 125-8.3.2.2 Soil Envelope: In both the bedding zone and the cover zone
 of the pipe, backfill with materials classified as A-1, A-2, or A-3. Material classified as A-4 may
 be used if the pipe is concrete pipe.
 125-8.3.2.3 Top Zone: Backfill the area of the trench above the soil
 envelope of the pipe with materials allowed on Standard Plans, Index 120-001.
 125-8.3.3 Compaction:
 125-8.3.3.1 Lowest Zone: Compact the soil in the lowest zone to
 approximately match the density of the soil in which the trench was cut.
 125-8.3.3.2 Bedding Zone: If the trench was not undercut below the
 bottom of the pipe, loosen the soil in the bottom of the trench immediately below the
 approximate middle third of the outside diameter of the pipe.
 If the trench was undercut, place the bedding material and leave it
 in a loose condition below the middle third of the outside diameter of the pipe. Compact the
 outer portions to meet the density requirements of the acceptance criteria. Place the material in
 lifts no greater than 6 inches (compacted thickness).
 125-8.3.3.3 Cover Zone: Before placing the cover zone material, lay pipe
 according to Section 430. Excavate for pipe bells before laying pipe. Place the material in 6 inch
 layers (compacted thickness), evenly deposited on both sides of the pipe, and compact with
 mechanical tampers suitable for this purpose. Hand tamp material below the pipe haunch that
 cannot be reached by mechanical tampers. Meet the requirements of in 125-9.2.
 125-8.3.3.4 Top Zone: Place the material in layers not to exceed
 12 inches in compacted thickness. Meet the requirements of the density acceptance criteria.
 125-8.3.4 Backfill Under Wet Conditions: Where wet conditions are such that
 dewatering by normal pumping methods would not be effective, the procedure outlined below
 may be used when specifically authorized by the Engineer in writing. The Department will pay
 for any select material which is not available from the grading as Unforeseeable Work. The
 Department will not pay for select material that might be used by the Contractor for his own
 convenience instead of dewatering.
 The Department will permit the use of granular material below the
 elevation at which mechanical tampers would be effective, but only material classified as A-3.
 Place and compact the material using timbers or hand tampers until the backfill reaches an
 elevation such that its moisture content will permit the use of mechanical tampers. When the
 backfill has reached such elevation, use normally acceptable backfill material. Compact the
 material using mechanical tampers in such manner and to such extent as to transfer the
 compacting force into the material previously tamped by hand.
 The Department will permit the use of coarse aggregate below the
 elevation at which mechanical tampers would be effective. Use coarse aggregate as specified in
 Section 901 for Aggregate Size Number 89, 8, 78, 7, 68, 6, or 57. Place the coarse aggregate
 such that it will be stable and firm. Fully wrap the aggregate with a layer of Type D-4 filter
 fabric, as specified in Section 985. Do not place coarse aggregate within 4 feet of the ends of the
 trench or ditch. Use normally accepted backfill material at the ends.
 125-9 Acceptance Program.
 125-9.1 General Requirements: Meet the requirements of 120-10, except replace the
 requirements of 120-10.1.6 with 125-9.1.1, 120-10.2 with 125-9.2, and 120-10.3 with 125-9.3.

 125-9.1.1 Reduced Testing Frequency: Obtain the Engineer’s approval in
 writing for the option to reduce density testing frequency to one test every two LOTs or one
 every four LOTs for trench box operations if the following requirements are met:
 a. Resolution testing was not required for six consecutive verified
 LOTs.
 b. Resolution testing was required for any of the six consecutive
 verified LOTs, but QC test data was upheld.
 Identify the substantiating tests in the Density Log Book and notify the
 Engineer in writing prior to starting reduced frequency of testing. Generate random numbers for
 selecting test locations for the LOTs under consideration. When QC test frequency is reduced ,
 obtain the Engineer’s approval in writing to place more than one LOT over an untested LOT. Do
 not apply reduced testing frequency for the first and last lift of pipe. Assure similar compaction
 efforts for the untested sections. If the Verification test fails, and QC test data is not upheld by
 Resolution testing the QC testing will revert to the original frequency.
 125-9.2 Acceptance Criteria:
 125-9.2.1 Density: Obtain a minimum QC density in any LOT of 100% of the
 Standard Proctor maximum density as determined by FM 1-T099 or the requirements of
 125-8.3.3.1 when applicable. When the cover height below the bottom of base under asphalt
 pavement, below concrete pavement, or below unpaved ground, exceeds 15 inches, compact the
 pipe backfill in the cover zone to a density of at least 95% of the Standard Proctor maximum
 density as determined by FM1-T099.
 For density requirements around drainage structures, obtain a minimum
 QC density in any LOT of 100% of the Standard Proctor maximum density as determined by
 FM 1-T099 for a distance of one pipe diameter but not less than 3 feet from the outside face of
 the structure.
 125-9.2.2 Exceptions to Structures and Pipe Density Requirements: Compact
 the backfill to a firmness approximately equal to that of the soil next to the pipe trench in
 locations outside the plane described by a one (vertical) to two (horizontal) slope downward
 from the roadway shoulder point or the gutter line in accordance with Standard Plans, Index 120001 or 120-002. Apply 125-9.2.1 when compacting side-drain pipe backfill under driveways
 serving a property that is not a single residential lot.
 125-9.3 Additional Requirements:
 125-9.3.1 Frequency: Conduct Standard Proctor maximum density sampling and

 bank, unless otherwise directed by the Engineer. Pull false work piling unless the Engineer
 permits it to be cut or broken off in which case it will be cut or broken off at least 2 feet below
 the ground line or stream bed.
 125-13 Method of Measurement.
 When direct payment for excavation for structures is provided in the proposal, and such
 payment is on a unit basis, such excavation will be measured in its original position by the crosssection method to determine the amount of material. The cubic yard volume of excavation used
 as a basis of payment will then be that material actually removed below the original ground line
 or stream bed, but not including that shown in the Plans to be paid for either as regular
 excavation, subsoil excavation, lateral ditch excavation or channel excavation, or which is
 included in the item for grading, and except that no payment will be made for material removed
 in excavating for footings or foundations outside of an area which is bounded by vertical planes
 12 inches outside of the limits of the footing and parallel thereto. For pipe trenches the width
 used to be in the calculation shall be the diameter of the pipe, plus 24 inches.

 SECTION 145
 GEOSYNTHETIC REINFORCEMENT
 145-1 Description.
 This Section specifies the construction requirements for geosynthetics used in:
 geosynthetic reinforced soil slopes, and geosynthetic reinforced foundations constructed on soft
 in-situ soils. Furnish and place geosynthetics and any associated facing material or drainage
 blankets.
 145-2 Responsibility.
 Construct the geosynthetic reinforced feature, including materials, method, and
 installation based on information provided in the Contract Documents and the geosynthetic
 supplier’s recommendations. Submit shop drawings in accordance with Section 5 showing the
 details and distribution of the selected geosynthetics that meet the design shown in the Plans.
 Alternate designs optimizing the selected geosynthetic materials may be submitted.
 For alternate designs, submit complete design calculations and details which include:
 plan view, elevation view, and details in accordance with the Contract Documents. These shall
 show the extent, number of layers of geosynthetic reinforcement, minimum properties of each
 geosynthetic reinforcement layer, vertical spacing of geosynthetic reinforcement, orientation of
 geosynthetic facing details, details at special structures or obstructions, typical construction
 sequence, and top and bottom elevations of the geosynthetic reinforcement. Calculations shall be
 submitted to substantiate the design meets the requirements of Chapter 263 of the FDOT Design
 Manual and in accordance with the Contract Plans. As a minimum these shall clearly show the
 derivation of reinforcement requirements (i.e., type, spacing, length, etc.) and determination of
 all design parameters and factors. All plans and calculations are to be signed and sealed by a
 Professional Engineer registered in the State of Florida.
 145-3 Materials.
 145-3.1 Geosynthetic Materials: Use materials meeting the requirements of Section 985
 and are listed on the Approved Product List (APL).
 Deliver geosynthetic materials (including facing and drainage elements) to the job
 site in unopened shipping packages labeled with the supplier’s name and product name. During
 shipping and storage, protect the geosynthetic from physical damage, debris and from
 temperatures greater than 140°F. Follow the supplier’s recommendations regarding protection
 from direct sunlight. At the time of installation, the Engineer will reject the material if it has
 defects, tears, punctures, flaws, deterioration, or other damage. However, if approved by the
 Engineer, the Contractor may repair torn or punctured sections by placing a patch over the
 damaged area. Replace or repair any rejected geosynthetic at no additional expense to the
 Department.
 145-3.2 Backfill Materials: Use only free draining backfill material in the reinforced fill
 volume as shown in the Plans meeting the following gradation limits as determined in
 accordance with AASHTO T27 and FM 1-T011:
 Sieve Size
 3-1/2 inches

 Do not use backfill material containing more than an average of 2.0% by weight
 of organic material, as determined by FM 1-T267 and by averaging the test results for three
 randomly selected, representative samples from each stratum or stockpile of a particular material.
 Consider the stratum or stockpile unsuitable for construction of the reinforced fill volume if an
 individual test value exceeds 3.0%.
 Use backfill with a maximum plasticity index of six as determined by
 AASHTO T90, and a maximum liquid limit of 15 as determined by AASHTO T89. Use backfill
 materials with a pH between 4.5 and 10.0 as determined by FM 5-550. When metal pipes or
 other metal items are embedded in the backfill, use backfill with a pH between 6.0 and 10.0. Do
 not use soil cement or lime stabilized backfill unless approved by the Engineer.
 Have the backfill material tested for every soil type for pH by a Department
 approved independent testing laboratory prior to placement. Submit a signed and sealed
 certification by a Professional Engineer registered in the State of Florida, that the results have
 met the requirements of this Section.
 145-4 Construction.
 145-4.1 General: Obtain from the geosynthetic supplier, technical instructions, guidance
 in preconstruction activities, and on-site technical assistance during construction. Submit a copy
 of any instructions provided by the supplier to the Engineer prior to beginning installation.
 145-4.2 Reinforced Soil Slopes:
 145-4.2.1 Preparation: Remove all existing vegetation and all unsuitable
 foundation materials. Prepare the foundation in accordance with Section 110, except as noted
 herein.
 Proof roll the graded area with a vibratory roller weighing a minimum of
 8 tons or a sheepsfoot roller, where appropriate, exerting a compression of at least 250 pounds
 psi on the tamper foot for at least five passes in the presence of the Engineer or as directed by the
 Engineer. Remove and replace any soft or loose foundation subsoils that are, in the opinion of
 the Engineer, incapable of sustaining the required proof rolling, in accordance with Section 125.
 Provide proof rolled ground surfaces which are uniform, smooth, and free
 of abrupt changes in slope, debris, and irregularities that might damage the reinforcement.
 Promptly repair and restore to their original condition any areas outside the limits of disturbance
 shown in the Plans which are damaged as part of this work at no expense to the Department.
 Make every possible effort to avoid such damage.
 145-4.2.2 Geosynthetic Placement: Place the geosynthetics at the proper
 elevation, location and orientation as shown in the Plans. In general, place the geosynthetics used
 for slope stabilization such that its primary direction of tensile strength is perpendicular to the
 plan face of the slope. Pull the geosynthetic material tight, and secure it as necessary to lay flat
 against the soil prior to fill placement.
 Place adjacent rolls of geosynthetic to maintain 100% horizontal coverage
 at the face of the slope. When placing geosynthetic for curved embankments, do not allow less
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 198
 
 than 50% horizontal coverage or an unreinforced horizontal spacing greater than 3 feet at the end
 of the reinforcement farthest from the face of the slope. Do not allow vertical spacing of the
 geosynthetic layers to exceed the spacing shown on the shop drawings.
 Do not make any splices or seams in the primary direction of tensile
 strength in the geosynthetic without approval of the Engineer. When splices in the primary
 direction are approved, make splices full width of the geosynthetic strip by using a similar
 material with similar strength. Use a splice mechanism that allows a minimum of 95% load
 transfer from piece to piece of geosynthetic. Make only one splice per length of geosynthetic. Do
 not place splices within 6 feet of the slope face, within 6 feet below top of slope, or horizontally
 adjacent to another splice.
 Place only that amount of geosynthetic material, including facing and
 drainage material, which will be covered in a single days’ production.
 Do not operate equipment directly on the geosynthetics. Operate
 equipment such that no turning movements occur on the areas where geosynthetic is in place
 with less than 12 inches of fill cover. Fill and compact ruts of more than 3 inches in depth as they
 develop.
 145-4.2.3 Backfill Placement: Perform work in accordance with an approved QC
 Plan meeting the requirements of 105-3. A LOT is defined as a single lift of finished
 embankment not to exceed 500 feet in length. Maintain uniform moisture content of the backfill
 material prior to and during compaction throughout each layer of material. Use backfill material
 having a placement moisture content within 2% on the dry side of optimum. Do not place wet
 backfill with moisture content greater than optimum in the fill. Spread backfill material over the
 geosynthetic in the direction of geosynthetic overlaps. Do not stockpile backfill materials on the
 installed geosynthetics. Avoid construction procedures or equipment which, in the opinion of the
 Engineer, will cause excessive mudwaving.
 Compact the backfill using either smooth wheel or rubber tire rollers. Do
 not use sheepsfoot, grid rollers, or other types of equipment employing a foot. At the end of each
 day’s operation, slope the backfill surface in order to permit runoff of rainwater away from the
 slope face, or provide some other positive drainage. Do not exceed the maximum allowable lift
 thickness in Section 120.
 145.4.2.4 Repairs: Replace geosynthetic reinforcement damaged during or after
 installation at no expense to the Department. Repair geosynthetics damaged during or after
 installation only after the supplier establishes that the interior and exterior stability is not affected
 and after obtaining the Engineer’s approval. Make such repairs as follows:
 Remove all backfill material from the damaged area of the reinforcement
 geosynthetic plus an additional 4 feet in all directions beyond the limits of damage. Place a patch
 consisting of the same material as the reinforcement geosynthetic over the damaged area.
 Overlap the undamaged reinforcement geosynthetic with the patch a minimum of 3 feet in all
 directions. Then replace and compact backfill material in accordance with 145-4.2.3.
 145-4.3 Reinforced Foundations Constructed on Soft In-Situ Soils:
 145-4.3.1 Preparation: For some applications involving reinforcement of soft
 insitu soils, the Engineer may require that some vegetation be left in place. If directed in the
 Plans or by the Engineer, cut trees to within 6 inches of the ground line, and leave the stumps in
 place. Remove fallen trunks, limbs, etc. greater than 3 inches in diameter.
 145-4.3.2 Backfill Placement: Meet the requirements of 145-4.2.3.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 199
 
 145-4.3.3 Geosynthetic Placement: Position and orient the geosynthetics over
 prepared surfaces. Place a geotextile filter of a type recommended by the designer of the
 geosynthetic system under the reinforcement geosynthetic. Cut and overlap geosynthetics as
 necessary to accommodate curves. Overlap or join ends and sides of adjacent geosynthetic
 courses as shown in the Plans and in accordance with 145-4.2.2. Make any overlaps in
 geosynthetics in the same direction that covering embankment will be spread. Take care to
 ensure that the geosynthetic sections do not separate at overlaps during construction. Pull the
 geosynthetic material tight by hand to a tension that removes all slack.
 145-4.3.4 Repairs: Meet the requirements of 145-4.2.4.
 145-5 Certification.
 Submit certification from the supplier, at least ten days prior to placement, that the
 products used are the same products listed on the APL, are in accordance with the project design
 requirements and is recommended by the supplier for use at this location.
 Acceptance of furnished material will be based on the supplier’s certification and visual
 inspection by the Engineer.

 two separate samples and retain one for resolution at point of placement until LOTs represented
 by the samples are accepted.
 145-6.5 Test Selection and Reporting: Determine test locations including stations and
 offsets, using the random number generator approved by the Engineer. Do not use note pads or
 work sheets to record data for later transfer to the density log book. Notify the Engineer upon
 successful completion of QC testing on each LOT.
 145-7 Verification Comparison Criteria and Resolution Procedures.
 145-7.1 Maximum Density Determination: The Engineer will collect enough material
 to split and create two separate samples and retain one for resolution until LOTs represented by
 the samples are accepted. The Engineer will meet the requirements of 120-10.4.1 except replace
 AASHTO T99, Method C with FM 1-T180, Method D. If the Contractor selects the optional
 acceptance criteria, the Engineer will verify the QC results of AASHTO T99, Method C in
 accordance with 120-10.4.1.
 145-7.2 Density Testing: Meet the requirements of 120-10.4.2.
 145-7.3 Gradation: The Engineer will verify the QC results if the verification result
 meets the gradation limits set forth in the gradation table of 145-3.2. Otherwise, the Engineer
 will test the sample retained in 145-6.1. The State Materials Office (SMO) or an AASHTO
 accredited laboratory designated by the SMO will perform resolution testing. The material will
 be sampled and tested in accordance with AASHTO T27 and FM 1-T011.
 If the resolution test result satisfies the required gradation limits, the LOTs will be
 verified. If the resolution test results do not meet the required gradation limits, reconstruct the
 LOTs with acceptable material. The Engineer will perform new verification testing.
 145-7.4 Liquid Limit and Plasticity Index (LL&PI): The Engineer will verify the QC
 results if the verification result satisfies the plasticity index and liquid limit criteria set forth in
 548-2.6. Otherwise, the Engineer will test the sample retained in 145-6.1. The SMO or an
 AASHTO accredited laboratory designated by the SMO will perform resolution testing. The
 material will be sampled and tested in accordance with AASHTO T90 and AASHTO T89,
 respectively.
 If the resolution test result satisfies the required criteria, LOTs of that soil type
 will be verified. If the resolution test results do not meet the required criteria, reconstruct the
 corresponding LOTs with acceptable material. The Engineer will perform new verification
 testing.
 145-7.5 Soil Classification: The Engineer will meet the requirements of 120-10.4.3
 except test the sample retained in 145-6.1 instead of taking the additional one.
 145-7.6 Organic Content: The Engineer will verify the QC results if the verification
 result satisfies the organic content test criteria set forth in 145-3.2. Otherwise, the Engineer will

 collect three additional samples. The material will be sampled and tested in accordance with
 FM 1-T267 and by averaging the test results for three randomly selected samples from at least
 one lift per soil type. The SMO or an AASHTO accredited laboratory designated by the SMO
 will perform resolution testing. If the resolution test result satisfies the required criteria, material
 of that soil type will be verified and accepted. If the resolution test results do not meet the
 required criteria, reject the material and reconstruct with acceptable material.
 145-7.7 pH: The Engineer will verify the QC results if the verification result satisfies the
 pH test criteria set forth in 145-3.2. Otherwise the Engineer will collect an additional sample.
 The SMO or an AASHTO accredited laboratory designated by the SMO will perform resolution
 testing. The material will be sampled and tested in accordance with FM 5-550. If the resolution
 test result satisfies the required criteria, material of that soil type will be verified and accepted. If
 the resolution test results do not meet the required criteria, reject the material and reconstruct
 with acceptable material.
 145-8 Method of Measurement.
 145-8.1 Geosynthetic Reinforced Soil Slopes: The quantity to be paid for will be the
 plan quantity area, in square feet, of the projected vertical height of the slope face, measured
 from the top of slope to the proposed final ground line at the toe of slope and from the beginning
 to end limits as shown in the Plans, regardless of the length or number of layers of geosynthetic

 SECTION 160
 STABILIZING
 160-1 Description.
 Stabilize designated portions of the roadbed to provide a firm and unyielding subgrade,
 having the required bearing value specified in the Plans.
 160-2 Materials.
 160-2.1 Commercial Material: Meet the requirements of Section 914-2.1.
 160-2.2 Local Material: Submit test results to the Engineer at least 14 days prior to the
 stabilization operation.
 160-2.2.1 Local Stabilizing Material: Sample and test material from each source
 and meet the requirements of Section 914. The Engineer will verify the Quality Control (QC) test
 results meet the requirements of Section 914. If the QC and Verification results do not compare,
 the Engineer will take one additional sample of material from the source in question and the
 State Materials Office (SMO) or an AASHTO accredited laboratory designated by the SMO will
 perform Resolution testing. If the Resolution test results satisfy the required criteria, material
 from that source will be verified and accepted. If the Resolution test results do not meet the
 required criteria, reject the material.
 160-2.2.2 Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP): Obtain the Engineer’s approval
 in writing for the option to use 100% RAP material. Material must be milled and stockpiled
 without blending or contaminating with any other material.
 160-2.2.3 Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) Blended Material: RAP
 blended material is defined as material meeting the requirements of 914-1 and 914-2.2 except for
 the limits for organic content. If the RAP blended material meets the requirements of 914-1 and
 914-2, then the blended material will be classified as local stabilizing material. Provide test
 results to the Engineer and obtain their approval in writing before using RAP blended material.
 The Engineer will verify that the QC test results meet the acceptance criteria, otherwise the
 Engineer will perform Resolution testing procedures specified in 160-2.2.1.
 160-2.3 Existing Base: Obtain the Engineer’s approval in writing before using existing
 base. When the material from an existing base is used as all, or a portion, of the stabilizing
 additives, no further testing is required unless directed by the Engineer.
 160-2.4 Granular Subbase: The Engineer may allow, at no additional cost to the
 Department, the substitution of 6 inches of granular subbase meeting the requirements of 290-2
 and 290-3, only when 12 inches of Type B stabilization requiring a Limerock Bearing Ratio
 (LBR) value of 40 is specified in accordance with Standard Plans, Index 120-001.
 160-3 Construction Methods.
 160-3.1 General: Prior to the beginning of stabilizing operations, construct the area to be
 stabilized to an elevation such that, upon completion of stabilizing operations, the completed
 stabilized subgrade will conform to the lines, grades, and cross-section shown in the Plans. Prior
 to spreading any additive stabilizing material, bring the surface of the roadbed to a plane
 approximately parallel to the plane of the proposed finished surface.
 Construct mainline pavement lanes, turn lanes, ramps, parking lots, concrete box
 culverts, retaining wall systems, shoulder-only areas, sidewalk, and shared use path areas
 meeting the requirements of 120-8.1, except replace “embankment” with “subgrade”.

 Isolated mixing operations will be considered as separate LOTs. Curb pads and
 shoulders compacted separately shall be considered separate LOTs. Isolated compaction
 operations will be considered as separate LOTs. For multiple phase construction, a LOT shall not
 extend beyond the limits of the phase.
 160-3.2 Application and Acceptance of Stabilizing Material: After completing the
 roadbed grading operations, determine the type and quantity (if any) of stabilizing material
 necessary for compliance with the bearing value requirements. Before using any Fossil Fuel
 Combustion Products (FFCPs), submit documentation, at the preconstruction meeting or no later
 than 30 days prior to delivery of FFCP’s to the project, signed and sealed by the Specialty
 Engineer that these materials meet the requirements of 403.7047 F.S. Notify the Engineer of the
 approximate quantity to be added before spreading. When additive stabilizing materials are
 required, spread the material uniformly over the area to be stabilized.
 The Engineer may perform Independent Verification (IV) sampling and testing if
 variability in the stabilizing material is observed during inspection after spreading on the
 roadway. If the IV test results do not meet the requirements of Section 914, then remove and
 replace the failing LOTs with acceptable material. The Engineer reserves the right to reject
 stabilizing material that contains excessive deleterious substances.
 160-3.3 Mixing: Perform mixing using rotary tillers, a plant or other equipment meeting
 the approval of the Engineer. The subgrade may be mixed in one course if the equipment and
 method of construction provides the uniformity, particle size limitation, compaction and other
 desired results of 160-4. Thoroughly mix the area to be stabilized throughout the entire depth and
 width of the stabilizing limits.
 Perform the mixing operations, as specified, (either in place or in a plant)
 regardless of whether the existing soil, or any select soils placed within the limits of the
 stabilized sections, have the required bearing value without the addition of stabilizing materials.
 160-3.4 Mixed Material Requirements: At the completion of the mixing, ensure the
 gradation of the material within the limits of the area being stabilized is such that 97% will pass a
 3-1/2 inch sieve. Break down or remove from the stabilized area materials, including clay lumps
 or lumps made of clay-size particles (any particle size 2 microns or less), not meeting the
 gradation requirements. After mixing, remove any existing lumps of clay or clay-sized particles
 greater than one inch that do not meet the requirements of 160-3.2 or this Section from the
 stabilized area. The final product must meet the acceptance requirements of 160-4.
 160-3.4.1 Classification and Bearing Value: Meet the soil utilization and
 bearing value requirements for the subgrade in accordance with 160-4.
 160-3.4.2 Compaction: After completing the mixing operations and satisfying
 the requirements for bearing value, uniformity, and particle size, compact the materials at a
 moisture content permitting the specified compaction in 160-4.2.3. If the moisture content of the
 material is improper for attaining the specified density, either add water or allow the material to
 dry until reaching the proper moisture content for the specified compaction.
 160-3.4.3 Finish Grading: Shape the completed stabilized subgrade to conform
 with the finished lines, grades, and cross-section indicated in the Plans. Check the subgrade
 using elevation stakes or other means approved by the Engineer.
 160-3.4.4 Condition of Completed Subgrade: After completing the stabilizing
 and compacting operations, ensure that the subgrade is firm and substantially unyielding to the
 extent that it will support construction equipment and will have the bearing value required by the
 Plans.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 204
 
 Remove all soft and yielding material, and any other portions of the
 subgrade which will not compact readily, and replace it with suitable material so that the whole
 subgrade is brought to line and grade, with proper allowance for subsequent compaction.
 160-3.4.5 Maintenance of Completed Subgrade: After completing the subgrade
 as specified above, maintain it free from ruts, depressions, and any damage resulting from the
 hauling or handling of materials, equipment, tools, etc. The Contractor is responsible for
 maintaining the required density until the subsequent base or pavement is in place including any
 repairs, replacement, etc., of curb and gutter, sidewalk, etc., which might become necessary in
 order to recompact the subgrade in the event of underwash or other damage occurring to the
 previously compacted subgrade. Perform any such recompaction at no expense to the
 Department. Construct and maintain ditches and drains along the completed subgrade section.

 c. Method of excavation, transport, and placement to ensure excavated
 rock will be kept separate from other approved stockpiles. Excavation methods that may result in
 damage to the rock rendering it unfit to be used as base will not be approved.
 d. Proposed measures to prevent contamination and segregation.
 e. Proposed locations and methods for constructing stockpiles for
 sampling and testing.
 f. Method for sampling and reporting test results.
 3. The Engineer will coordinate the review of the “Plan” with the District
 Materials Office.
 4. Upon the Engineer’s review of the “Plan”, build a preliminary stockpile, not to
 exceed 1,000 cubic yards.
 5. Collect and test a minimum of three samples from the preliminary stockpile.
 Once the stockpile has been sampled, do not add any additional material to the stockpile.
 Determine compliance with 200-2.1, with the exception of carbonate contents. Reject any
 stockpile if the Limerock Bearing Ratio (LBR) is less than 100. The District Materials Office
 will sample and test the preliminary stockpile to verify compliance with this Section.
 6. If all test results meet the requirements of this Section, the Engineer will notify
 the Contractor in writing of the approved status of the preliminary stockpile based on the
 analysis of test data performed by the District Materials Office.

 7. If the use of existing rock is approved, continue to produce additional
 stockpiles not exceeding 1,000 cubic yards. Ensure the rock meets the requirements of this
 Section by sampling and testing each new stockpile at a minimum frequency of one sample per
 400 cubic yards. Once a stockpile has been sampled, do not add additional material to that
 stockpile. The District Materials Office may also perform sampling and testing. Materials will be
 accepted if test results meet the requirements of this Section.
 8. After 10 consecutive quality control (QC) LBR test results meet the
 requirements of the Section and no individual LBR test is less than 120, the sampling and testing
 frequency may be reduced to a minimum frequency of one sample per 800 cubic yards for each
 stockpile. Notify the Engineer in writing prior to reducing testing frequency. If any QC LBR test
 result falls below 120 or a stockpile is rejected, revert to original sampling frequency of one
 sample per 400 cubic yards.
 9. Construct a new preliminary stockpile if there is a change in material,
 conditions not addressed in the “Plan” are encountered, or if production varies from the approved
 “Plan”.
 200-3 Equipment.
 Use mechanical rock spreaders, equipped with a device that strikes off the rock uniformly
 to laying thickness, capable of producing even distribution. For crossovers, intersections and
 ramp areas; roadway widths of 20 feet or less; the main roadway area when forms are used and
 any other areas where the use of a mechanical spreader is not practicable; the Contractor may
 spread the rock using bulldozers or blade graders.
 200-4 Transporting Rock.
 Transport the rock to its point of use, over rock previously placed, if practicable, and
 dump it on the end of the preceding spread. Hauling and dumping on the subgrade will be
 permitted only when, in the Engineer’s opinion, these operations will not be detrimental to the
 subgrade.
 200-5 Spreading Rock.
 200-5.1 Method of Spreading: Spread the rock uniformly. Remove all segregated areas
 of fine or coarse rock and replace them with properly graded rock.
 200-5.2 Number of Courses: When the specified compacted thickness of the base is
 greater than 6 inches, construct the base in multiple courses of equal thickness. Individual
 courses shall not be less than 3 inches. The thickness of the first course may be increased to bear
 the weight of the construction equipment without disturbing the subgrade.
 If, through field tests, the Contractor can demonstrate that the compaction
 equipment can achieve density for the full depth of a thicker lift, and if approved by the
 Engineer, the base may be constructed in successive courses of not more than 8 inches
 compacted thickness.
 The Engineer will base approval on results of a test section constructed using the
 Contractor’s specified compaction effort. Notify the Engineer prior to beginning construction of
 a test section. Construct a test section of the length of one LOT. Perform five QC density tests at
 random locations within the test section. At each test site, test the bottom 6 inches in addition to
 the entire course thickness. All QC tests and a Department Verification test must meet the
 density required by 200-7.2.1. Identify the test section with the compaction effort and thickness
 in the Logbook. Remove the materials above the bottom 6 inches, at no expense to the
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 215
 
 Department. The minimum density required on the thicker lift will be the average of the five
 results obtained on the thick lift in the passing test section. Maintain the exposed surface as close
 to “undisturbed” as possible; no further compaction will be permitted during the test preparation.
 If unable to achieve the required density, remove and replace or repair the test section to comply
 with the specifications at no additional expense to the Department. The Contractor may elect to
 place material in 6 inches compacted thickness at any time.
 Once approved, a change in the source of base material will require the construction
 of a new test section. Do not change the compaction effort once the test section is approved. The
 Engineer will periodically verify the density of the bottom 6 inches during thick lift operations.
 The Engineer may terminate the use of thick lift construction and instruct the
 Contractor to revert to the 6 inches maximum lift thickness if the Contractor fails to achieve
 satisfactory results or meet applicable specifications.
 200-5.3 Rock Base for Shoulder Pavement: Unless otherwise permitted, complete all
 rock base shoulder construction at any particular location before placing the final course of
 pavement on the traveled roadway. When dumping material for the construction of a rock base
 on the shoulders, do not allow material capable of scarring or contaminating the pavement
 surface on the adjacent pavement. Immediately sweep off any rock material that is deposited on
 the surface course.
 200-6 Compacting and Finishing Base.
 200-6.1 General: Construct mainline pavement lanes, turn lanes, ramps, parking lots,
 concrete box culverts and retaining wall systems meeting the requirements of 120-8.1, except
 replace “embankment” with “base”.
 Construct shoulder-only areas, shared use paths, and sidewalks. Meet the
 requirements of 120-8.1 except replace “embankment” with “base” meeting the acceptance
 criteria of 200-7.2. Shoulders compacted separately shall be considered separate LOTs.
 200-6.1.1 Single Course Base: After spreading, scarify the entire surface, then
 shape the base to produce the required grade and cross-section, free of scabs and laminations,
 after compaction.
 200-6.1.2 Multiple Course Base: Clean the first course of foreign material, then
 blade and bring it to a surface cross-section approximately parallel to the finished base. Before
 spreading any material for the upper courses, allow the Engineer to make density tests for the
 lower courses to determine that the required compaction has been obtained. After spreading the
 material for the top course, scarify finish and shape its surface to produce the required grade and
 cross-section, free of scabs and laminations, after compaction.
 200-6.2 Moisture Content: When the material does not have the proper moisture content
 to ensure the required density, wet or dry it as required. When adding water, uniformly mix it in
 to the full depth of the course that is being compacted. During wetting or drying operations,
 manipulate, as a unit, the entire width and depth of the course that is being compacted.
 200-6.3 Thickness Requirements: Within the entire limits of the length and width of the
 finished base, meet the specified plan thickness in accordance with the requirements of 2007.3.1.2.
 200-6.4 Correction of Defects:
 200-6.4.1 Contamination of Base Material: If, at any time, the subgrade
 material becomes mixed with the base course material, dig out and remove the mixture, and
 reshape and compact the subgrade. Then replace the materials removed with clean base material,
 and shape and compact as specified above. Perform this work at no expense to the Department.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 216
 
 200-6.4.2 Cracks and Checks: If cracks or checks appear in the base, either
 before or after priming, which, in the opinion of the Engineer, would impair the structural
 efficiency of the base, remove the cracks or checks by rescarifying, reshaping, adding base
 material where necessary, and recompacting.
 200-6.5 Compaction of Widening Strips: Where base construction consists of widening
 strips and the trench width is not sufficient to permit use of standard base compaction equipment,
 compact the base using vibratory compactors, trench rollers or other special equipment which
 will achieve the density requirements specified herein.
 When multiple course base construction is required, compact each course prior to
 spreading material for the overlaying course.
 200-7 Acceptance Program.
 200-7.1 General Requirements: Meet the requirements of 120-10, except use 200-7.2
 instead of 120-10.2, 200-7.3 instead of 120-10.3 and 200-7.4 instead of 120-10.4.

 217
 
 requirements of 200-7.2.2 shall not apply. The Department will determine the Pit Proctor from
 statistical analysis of the base rock Modified Proctor maximum density at Department approved
 mines. For posting of Mines and Pit Proctors for each calendar quarter refer to the State
 Materials Office internet website at http://www.fdot.gov/materials/. Use the current posted Pit
 Proctor value in lieu of the Modified Proctor maximum density required by 200-7.2.1. Use the
 current posted Pit Proctor value for density acceptance during the quarter corresponding to the
 posting. Notify the Engineer in writing if returning to the provisions of 200-7.2 and 200-7.2.2 but
 do not re-elect to use the Pit Proctor until the start of the next calendar quarter.
 200-7.3 Additional Requirements:
 200-7.3.1 Quality Control Testing:
 200-7.3.1.1 Modified Proctor Maximum Density Requirement: Collect
 enough material to split and create three separate samples and retain two for the Engineer’s
 Verification and Resolution testing until the Engineer accepts the 16 LOTs represented by the
 samples.
 200-7.3.1.2 Depth and Surface Testing Requirements: Notify the
 Engineer a minimum of 24 hours before checking base depths and surface checking. Determine
 test locations including Stations and Offsets, using the Random Number generator approved by
 the Department. Do not perform depth and surface checks until the Engineer is present to
 witness. Enter test results into the Department’s database. Perform thickness check on the
 finished base or granular subbase component of a composite base. Provide traffic control,
 coring/boring equipment, and an operator for the coring/boring equipment. Traffic control is to
 be provided in accordance with the standard maintenance of traffic requirements of the Contract.
 The thickness is considered deficient, if the measured depth is over
 1/2 inch less than the specified thickness. Correct all deficient areas of the completed base by
 scarifying and adding additional base material. As an exception, if authorized by the Department,
 such areas may be left in place without correction and with no payment.
 Check the finished surface of the base course with a template cut to
 the required crown and with a 15 foot straightedge laid parallel to the centerline of the road.
 Correct all irregularities greater than 1/4 inch to the satisfaction of the Engineer by scarifying
 and removing or adding rock as required, and recompact the entire area as specified
 hereinbefore.
 200-7.3.1.3 Surface & Thickness Reduced Testing Frequency: When
 no Resolution testing is required for 12 consecutive verified LOTs, or if required, the QC test
 data was upheld, reduce the QC surface and/or thickness checks to one half the minimum
 requirements as stated in 200-7.2.2 (e.g., reduce frequency from ten per LOT to ten per two
 LOTs) by identifying the substantiating tests and notifying the Engineer in writing prior to
 starting reduced frequency of testing. If the Verification test fails, and QC test data is not upheld
 by Resolution testing the QC testing will revert to the original frequency of 200-7.2.2. The
 results of the Independent Verification testing will not affect the frequency of the QC testing.
 200-7.3.2 Department Verification Tests:
 200-7.3.2.1 Maximum Density: The Engineer will randomly select one of
 the remaining two split samples and test in accordance with FM 1-T180, Method D.
 200-7.3.2.2 Thickness and Surface Testing Requirements: The
 Department will witness the base depth and surface checks to ensure compliance with 2007.3.1.2. If the QC test results are not deficient as defined in 200-7.3.1.2, the LOT or 500-foot
 section will be accepted. If the QC test results are deficient, resolve deficiencies in accordance
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 218
 
 with 200-7.3.1.2. Repeat acceptance testing. Provide traffic control, coring/boring equipment,
 and an operator for the coring/boring equipment.
 200-7.4 Verification Comparison Criteria and Resolution Procedures:
 200-7.4.1 Modified Proctor Maximum Density: The Engineer will compare the
 Verification test results of 200-7.3.2.1 to the corresponding QC test results. If the test result is
 within 4.5 lb/ft3 of the QC test result, the LOTs will be verified. Otherwise, the Engineer will
 collect the Resolution split sample corresponding to the Verification sample tested. The State
 Materials Office or an AASHTO accredited laboratory designated by the State Materials Office
 will perform Resolution testing. The material will be sampled and tested in accordance with
 FM 1-T180, Method D.
 The Engineer will compare the Resolution Test results with the QC test
 results. If the Resolution Test result is within 4.5 lb/ft3 of the corresponding QC test result, the
 Engineer will use the QC test results for material acceptance purposes for each corresponding set
 of LOTs. If the Resolution test result is not within 4.5 lb/ft3 of the corresponding QC test, the
 Engineer will collect the remaining Verification split sample for testing. Verification Test results
 will be used for material acceptance purposes for the LOTs in question.
 200-7.4.2 Pit Proctor: When using the Pit Proctor option, the Engineer will select
 a random location to sample and test at the minimum frequency in the table below, to obtain an
 Independent Verification (IV) maximum density as determined by FM 1-T180, Method D. The
 Engineer will collect enough material to split and hold a sample for Resolution testing.

 The Engineer will compare the IV results with the Pit Proctor. If the IV
 result is lower than or equal to the Pit Proctor plus 4.5 pcf, keep the option to use the Pit Proctor.
 If the IV result is more than 4.5 pcf higher than the Pit Proctor the Engineer will test the
 Resolution sample and compare the Resolution result with the Pit Proctor. If the Resolution
 result is lower than or equal to the Pit Proctor plus 4.5 pcf, keep the option to use the Pit Proctor.
 Otherwise return to the provisions of 200-7.2.2, 200-7.3.1.1, 200-7.3.2.1, and 200-7.4.1.
 200-7.4.3 Density: When a Verification or Independent Verification density test
 does not meet the requirements of 200-7.2.1 (Acceptance Criteria), retest at a site within a 5 feet
 radius of the Verification test location and observe the following:
 1. If the QC retest meets the Acceptance Criteria and compares favorably
 with the Verification or Independent Verification test, the Engineer will accept the LOTs in
 question.
 2. If the QC retest does not meet the Acceptance Criteria and compares
 favorably with the Verification or Independent Verification test, rework and retest the material in
 that LOT. The Engineer will re-verify the LOTs in question.
 3. If the QC retest and the Verification or Independent Verification test do
 not compare favorably, complete a new equipment-comparison analysis as defined in 120-10.1.1.
 Once acceptable comparison is achieved, retest the LOTs. The Engineer will perform new

 verification testing. Acceptance testing will not begin on a new LOT until the Contractor has a
 gauge that meets the comparison requirements.
 200-7.4.4 Thickness and Surface Testing Requirements: Resolve deficiencies
 in accordance with 200-7.3.1.2.
 200-8 Priming and Maintaining.
 200-8.1 Priming: Apply the prime coat only when the base meets the specified density
 requirements and when the moisture content in the top half of the base does not exceed the
 optimum moisture of the base material. At the time of priming, ensure that the base is firm,
 unyielding and in such condition that no undue distortion will occur. Ensure the prime coat
 adheres to the base course.
 200-8.2 Maintaining: Maintain the true crown and template, with no rutting or other
 distortion, while applying the surface course.
 200-9 Calculations for Average Thickness of Base.
 For bases that are not mixed in place, the Engineer will determine the average thickness
 from the measurements specified in 200-10.1, calculated as follows:
 1. When the measured thickness is more than 1/2 inch greater than the design
 thickness shown on the typical cross-section in the Plans, it will be considered as the design
 thickness plus 1/2 inch.
 2. Average thickness will be calculated per typical cross-section for the entire job
 as a unit.
 3. Any areas of base left in place with no payment will not be included in the
 calculations.
 4. Where it is not possible through borings to distinguish the base materials from
 the underlying materials, the thickness of the base used in the measurement will be the design
 thickness.
 200-10 Method of Measurement.
 200-10.1 General: The quantity to be paid for will be the plan quantity, adjusted as
 specified below.
 200-10.2 Authorized Normal Thickness Base: The surface area of authorized normal
 thickness base to be adjusted will be the plan quantity as specified above, omitting any areas not
 allowed for payment under the provisions of 200-6.3 and omitting areas which are to be included
 for payment under 200-10.3. The adjustment shall be made by adding or deducting, as
 appropriate, the area of base represented by the difference between the calculated average
 thickness, determined as provided in 200-9, and the specified normal thickness, converted to
 equivalent square yards of normal thickness base.
 200-10.3 Authorized Variable Thickness Base: Where the base is constructed to a
 compacted thickness other than the normal thickness as shown on the typical section in the Plans,
 as specified in the Plans or ordered by the Engineer for providing additional depths at culverts or
 bridges, or for providing transitions to connecting pavements, the volume of such authorized
 variable thickness compacted base will be calculated from authorized lines and grades, or by
 other methods selected by the Engineer, converted to equivalent square yards of normal
 thickness base for payment.

 Construct a base course composed of roadbed soil stabilized with limerock.
 230-2 Materials.
 Meet the limerock material requirements as specified in Section 911.
 230-3 Equipment.
 230-3.1 For Mixing: For mixing in the roadway, provide a heavy-duty rotary tiller or
 other equipment approved by the Engineer as equally effective for this work.
 230-3.2 For Compaction: Select the equipment for compacting the stabilized material,
 except that for the final finish use a steel-wheeled roller.
 230-4 Preparation of Roadbed.
 Complete the area to be stabilized to the lines shown in the Plans and to a grade parallel
 to the finished elevation of the stabilized base, before adding the stabilizing material. Ensure that
 the elevation of the roadbed is such that the base will conform to the typical cross-section upon
 completing the work. Dispose of any surplus excavated materials resulting from this work, as
 specified in 120-5.
 230-5 Incorporation of Stabilizing Material and Mixing-In.
 230-5.1 Spreading and Mixing: Place the limerock on the areas to be stabilized, and
 spread it uniformly to the loose depth shown in the Plans or ordered by the Engineer. Then,
 thoroughly mix the limerock with the soil. Perform mixing as soon as practicable but not later
 than one week after placing the limerock on the road. Do not spread more limerock in advance of
 the mixing operations than can be mixed-in with the soil within one week.
 230-5.2 Further Mixing Operations: Repeat the mixing operations as often as may be
 necessary to distribute the limerock uniformly throughout the soil, as determined by the
 Engineer. Further manipulate the material to uniformly distribute the limerock throughout the
 width and depth of the base course.
 230-5.3 Plant Mixing: The Contractor may mix the soil, limerock, and water using the
 central plant-mix method in lieu of mixing in place, provided he obtains a uniform mixture with
 the proper amount of water.
 230-5.4 Shaping Surface: After mixing, shape the surface so it conforms to the grade
 and typical cross-section shown in the Plans after compacting.
 230-5.5 Depth of Mixing Stabilizing Material: Ensure that the depth of mixing of the
 stabilizing material is in accordance with the following table:

 In the event that the measured depth of mixing is less than the minimum specified
 above, remix the base course, as directed by the Engineer, until the stabilizing material is
 distributed to the required depth throughout the base course.
 Where the measured depth of mixing exceeds the maximum limits specified in the
 table, add 1 inch, loose measure, of stabilizing material for each 1 inch of mixing depth in excess
 of the allowable depth (but in no case less than 1 inch of material, for any excess depth), and mix
 the added material in the top 6 inches of the base as specified in 230-5.1 and 230-5.2, at no
 expense to the Department. The Department will not include the volume of stabilizing material,
 which is added to compensate for excess mixing depth, in the pay quantity, and will not allow
 any additional compensation for the extra mixing required.

 Base course mixes are designated as Type B-12.5. The Contractor may use a Type SP-12.5
 mixture (Traffic Level B, C, D, or E), in lieu of a Type B-12.5.
 Obtain Superpave asphalt base from a plant that is currently on the Department’s
 Production Facility Listing. Producers seeking inclusion on the list shall meet the requirements of
 Section 105.
 234-2 Materials.
 234-2.1 General: Use materials that conform to the requirements of Division III. Specific
 references are as follows:
 Superpave PG Asphalt Binder ...........................Section 916
 Coarse Aggregate, Stone, Slag or
 Crushed Gravel ...................................................Section 901
 Fine Aggregate ....................................................Section 902
 234-2.2 Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP): RAP may be used as a component
 material of the asphalt mixture provided the requirements of 334-2.3 are met.
 234-3 General Composition of Mixture.
 234-3.1 General: Compose the asphalt mixture using a combination of aggregate (coarse,
 fine or mixtures thereof), mineral filler if required, and asphalt binder material. Size, grade and
 combine the aggregate fractions to meet the grading and physical properties of the mix design.
 Aggregates from various sources may be combined.
 234-3.2 Mix Design: Unless otherwise specified, design the mix such that all
 requirements for a Type SP-12.5, Traffic Level B or C mixture as specified in Section 334 are
 met.
 234-3.2.1 Gradation Classification: Use a fine mix as defined in 334-3.2.2.1.
 234-3.2.2 Aggregate Consensus Properties: Meet the aggregate consensus
 properties at design as specified in 334-3.2.3. Meet the criteria specified for a depth of top of

 and transverse grades as specified in 200-7.
 234-6 Plant, Methods and Equipment.
 Meet requirements of Section 320, with the following modifications:
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 229
 
 234-6.1 Paving Equipment: A motor grader may be used to spread the first course of
 multiple course bases when the subgrade will not support the use of a mechanical spreader. The
 Engineer will not require mechanical spreading and finishing equipment for the construction of
 base widening strips less than 6 feet in width or where the shape or size of the area will not
 accommodate mechanical spreading and finishing equipment.
 234-6.2 Compaction Equipment: In areas where standard rollers cannot be
 accommodated, vibratory rollers supplemented with trucks, motor graders, or other compaction
 equipment approved by the Engineer may be used.
 234-7 Construction Requirements.
 234-7.1 General: Meet the general construction requirements of Section 330, with the
 following modifications:
 234-7.1.1 Temperature Limitations: Spread the mixture only when the air
 temperature is at least 40ºF. Do not place the material on frozen subgrade.
 234-7.1.2 Tack Coat: Unless otherwise authorized by the Engineer, apply a tack
 coat between successive layers of base material.
 234-7.1.3 Thickness of Layers: Construct each course in layers not to exceed
 3 inches compacted thickness.
 234-8 Thickness Requirements.
 234-8.1 General: The total thickness of the Type B asphalt layers will be the plan
 thickness as shown in the Contract Documents. Before paving, propose a thickness for each
 individual layer meeting the requirements of this specification, which when combined with other
 layers (as applicable) will equal the plan thickness. For construction purposes, the plan thickness
 and individual layer thickness will be converted to spread rate based on the maximum specific
 gravity of the asphalt mix being used, as well as the minimum density level, as shown in the
 following equation:
 Spread rate (lbs. per square yard) = t x Gmm x 43.3
 Where: t = Thickness (in.) (Plan thickness or individual layer thickness)
 Gmm = Maximum specific gravity from the verified mix design
 The weight of the mixture shall be determined as provided in 320-3.2. For target
 purposes only, spread rate calculations should be rounded to the nearest whole number.
 234-8.2 Spread Rate Tolerance: Control the average spread rate on a daily basis to
 within plus or minus 5% of the target spread rate for the individual layers established by the
 Engineer. When the average daily spread rate is outside this tolerance from the target, adjust the
 spread rate to the required value established by the Engineer. The Engineer will periodically
 verify the spread rate at the job site during the paving operation.
 234-8.3 Allowable Deficiencies: The Engineer will allow a maximum deficiency from
 the specified spread rate for the total thickness as follows:
 1. For pavement of a specified thickness of 2-1/2 inches or more: 50 pounds per
 square yard.
 2. For pavement of a specified thickness of less than 2-1/2 inches: 25 pounds per
 square yard.
 234-8.4 Pavement Exceeding Allowable Deficiency in Spread Rate: Where the
 deficiency in spread rate for the total thickness is in excess of 50 pounds per square yard for
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 230
 
 pavements with a specified thickness of 2-1/2 inches or more, or in excess of 25 pounds per
 square yard for pavements with a specified thickness of less than 2-1/2 inches, the Engineer may
 require removal and replacement at no cost or may require a correction as specified in 234-8.5.
 The Engineer may require the Contractor to core the pavement for thickness in order to
 determine the area of pavement with deficient thickness.
 As an exception to the above, the Contractor may leave pavement outside the
 main roadway in place without compensation when the Engineer allows, even though the
 deficiency exceeds the tolerance as specified above.
 The Department will not compensate the Contractor for any pavement removed or
 for the work of removing such pavement.
 234-8.5 Correcting Deficiency by Adding New Surface Material: In the event the total
 thickness as determined by the spread rate is excessively deficient as defined above and if
 approved by the Engineer for each particular location, correct the deficient thickness by adding
 new surface material and compacting it using a rolling pattern as approved by the Engineer. The
 Engineer will determine the area to be corrected and the thickness of new material added.
 Perform all overlaying and compacting at no expense to the Department.
 234-9 Method of Measurement.
 The quantity to be paid for will be the plan quantity. For each pay item, the pay area will
 be adjusted based upon the following formula:
 Pay Area = Surface Area (actual tonnage placed/adjusted plan quantity tonnage).
 Where: The adjusted plan quantity tonnage is calculated by multiplying the plan
 quantity square yards (including any Engineer approved quantity revisions) times the spread rate
 as defined in 234-8.1 and dividing by 2,000 pounds per ton, except the pay item’s tonnageweighted average Gmm is used instead of the design Gmm as defined in 234-8.1.
 The pay area shall not exceed 105% of the designed surface area.
 Prepare and submit a Certification of Quantities to the Engineer in accordance with 92.1.2.
 234-10 Basis of Payment.
 Prices and payments will be full compensation for all work specified in this Section,
 including the applicable requirements of Sections 320, 330 and 334. The bid price for the asphalt
 mix will include the cost of the liquid asphalt binder or the asphalt recycling agent and the tack
 coat application as directed in 300-8.
 Payment will be made under:

 SECTION 283
 RECLAIMED ASPHALT PAVEMENT BASE
 283-1 Description.
 Construct a base course composed of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) material. Use
 RAP material as a base course only on non-limited access paved shoulders, shared use paths, or
 other non-traffic bearing applications.
 283-2 Materials.
 Obtain the RAP material by either milling or crushing an existing asphalt pavement. Use
 material so that at least 97% (by weight) pass a 3-1/2 inch sieve and is graded uniformly down to
 dust.
 When the RAP material is from a Department project and the composition of existing
 pavement is known, the Engineer may approve material on the basis of the composition. When
 the composition of obtained RAP is not known, the following procedure will be used for
 approval:
 1. Conduct a minimum of six extraction gradation analyses of the RAP material.
 Take samples at random locations in the stockpile. The average asphalt cement content of the six
 stockpile samples must be 4% or greater with no individual result below 3-1/2%.
 2. Request the Engineer to make a visual inspection of the stockpile of RAP
 material. Based on this visual inspection of the stockpiled material and the results of the
 Contractor’s extraction gradation analyses, the Engineer will determine the suitability of the
 materials.
 3. The Engineer may require crushing of stockpiled material to meet the gradation
 criterion. Perform all crushing before the material is placed.
 283-3 Spreading RAP Material.
 283-3.1 Method of Spreading: Spread the RAP with a blade or device which strikes off
 the material uniformly to laying thickness and produces an even distribution of the RAP. The
 Contractor may also place the RAP material directly from the milling machine into the trench by
 a conveyor. When placing the RAP material by conveyor directly from the milling machine,
 obtain the Engineer’s approval of the milling process.
 283-3.2 Number of Courses: When the specified compacted thickness of the base is
 greater than 6 inches, construct the base in two courses. Place the first course to a thickness of
 approximately one half the total thickness of the finished base, or sufficient additional thickness
 to bear the weight of construction equipment without disturbing the subgrade.
 Except as might be permitted by the Engineer for special cases, conduct all RAP
 base construction operations for shoulders before placing the final pavement on the adjacent
 traveled roadway.
 283-4 Compacting and Finishing Base.
 283-4.1 General: Meet the requirements of 200-6.1:
 283-4.1.1 Single-Course Base: Construct as specified in 200-6.1.1.
 283-4.1.2 Multiple-Course Base: Construct as specified in 200-6.1.2.
 283-4.2 Moisture Content: Meet the requirements of 200-6.2.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 232
 
 283-4.3 Density Requirements: Compact the material to a density of not less than
 95% of maximum density as determined by FM 1-T180. Where the width of the base
 construction is not sufficient to permit use of standard base compaction equipment, perform
 compaction using vibratory compactors, trench rollers, or other special equipment which will
 provide the density requirements specified herein.
 283-4.4 Density Tests: Meet the requirements of 200-7 with the exception of 200-7.2.1.
 Within the entire limits of the width and depth of the base, obtain a minimum density in any LOT
 of 95% of the maximum density as determined by FM 1-T180.
 283-4.5 Thickness Requirements: Meets the thickness requirements of 285-6.
 283-5 Testing Surface.
 Test the surface in accordance with the requirements of 200-7-3.
 283-6 Priming and Maintaining.
 283-6.1 Priming: Apply the prime coat only when the base meets the specified density
 requirements and the moisture content in the top half of the base is within 2% of optimum. At the
 time of priming, ensure that the base is firm, unyielding, and in such condition that no undue
 distortion will occur. The Engineer will not allow priming if the surface is dry, dusty, or
 sloughing.
 283-6.2 Maintaining: Meet the requirements of 200-8.2.

 The Plans will identify the optional materials used by the Department for determining the
 earthwork quantities (Roadway Excavation, Borrow Excavation, Subsoil Excavation, Subsoil
 Earthwork, or Embankment). The Department will not revise the quantities, for those items
 having final pay based on plan quantity, to reflect any volumetric change caused by the
 Contractor’s selection of a different optional material.
 285-6 Thickness Requirements.
 285-6.1 Measurements: For non-asphalt bases, meet the requirements of 200-7.3.1.2.
 For subbases, meet the thickness requirements of 290-4.
 The Engineer will determine the thickness of asphalt base courses in accordance
 with 234-8.1.
 285-6.2 Correction of Deficient Areas: For non-asphalt bases, correct all areas of the
 completed base having a deficiency in thickness in excess of 1/2 inch by scarifying and adding
 additional base material. As an exception, if authorized by the Engineer, such areas may be left in
 place without correction and with no payment.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 236
 
 8.
 
 For asphalt bases, correct all areas of deficient thickness in accordance with 234-
 
 285-7 Calculation of Average Thickness of Base.
 For bases that are not mixed in place, the Engineer will determine the average thickness
 from the measurements specified in 285-6.1, calculated as follows:
 1. When the measured thickness is more than 1/2 inch greater than the design
 thickness shown on the typical cross-section in the Plans, it will be considered as the design
 thickness plus 1/2 inch.
 2. Average thickness will be calculated per typical cross-section for the entire job
 as a unit.
 3. Any areas of base left in place with no payment will not be included in the
 calculations.
 4. Where it is not possible through borings to distinguish the base materials from

 the cover material requirement if the primed base is not exposed to general traffic and
 construction traffic does not mar the prime coat so as to expose the base. The Contractor may use
 either sand or screenings for the cover material. For the sand, meet the requirements as specified
 in 902-2 or 902-6, and for the screenings, meet the requirements as specified in 902-5. If the
 primed base course will be exposed to general traffic, apply a cover material coated with 2 to 4%
 asphalt cement. Apply the asphalt coated material at approximately 10 pounds per square yard.
 Roll the entire surface of asphalt coated prime material with a traffic roller as required to produce
 a reasonably dense mat.
 300-2.3 Tack Coat: Unless the Contract Documents call for a specific type or grade of
 tack coat, use PG 52-28 meeting the requirements of 916-2, heated to a temperature from
 250 to 300ºF or use an undiluted emulsion listed on the APL, meeting the requirements of 916-3.
 Heat the emulsion to the temperature recommended by the tack coat manufacturer.
 For night paving, use PG 52-28 tack coat. The Engineer may approve an
 emulsified tack coat for night paving if the Contractor demonstrates, at the time of use, the
 emulsion will break and not affect the progress of the paving operation.
 300-3 Equipment.
 300-3.1 Pressure Distributor: Provide a pressure distributor equipped with pneumatic
 tires having a sufficient width of rubber in contact with the road surface to avoid breaking the
 bond or forming a rut in the surface. Ensure the distance between the centers of openings of the
 outside nozzles of the spray bar is equal to the width of the application required, plus or minus
 two inches. Ensure the outside nozzle at each end of the spray bar has an area of opening not less
 than 25% or more than 75% in excess of the other nozzles. Ensure all other nozzles have uniform

 252
 
 openings. When the application covers less than the full width, the Contractor may allow the
 normal opening of the end nozzle at the junction line to remain the same as the interior nozzles.
 300-3.2 Sampling Device: Equip all pressure distributors and transport tanks with an
 approved spigot-type sampling device.
 300-3.3 Temperature Sensing Device: Equip all pressure distributors and transport
 tanks with an approved dial type thermometer.
 Use a thermometer with a temperature range from 50 to 500ºF, no greater than
 25ºF increments, and a minimum dial diameter of two inches.
 Locate the thermometer near the midpoint of the tank’s length and within the
 middle third of the tank’s height, or as specified by the manufacturer (if in a safe and easily
 accessible location). Enclose the thermometer in a well with a protective window or by other
 means as necessary to keep the instrument clean and in the proper working condition.
 300-4 Contractor’s Quality Control.
 Provide the necessary quality control of the prime and tack coats and application in
 accordance with the Contract requirements. If the application rate varies by more than
 0.01 gallon per square yard from the rate set by the Engineer or varies beyond the range
 established in 300-7 or 300-8, immediately make all corrections necessary to bring the spread
 rate into the acceptable range. The Engineer may take additional measurements at any time. The
 Engineer will randomly check the Contractor’s measurement to verify the spread rate.
 300-5 Cleaning Base and Protection of Adjacent Work.
 Before applying any bituminous material, remove all loose material, dust, sand, dirt,
 caked clay, and other foreign material which might prevent proper bond with the existing surface
 for the full width of the application. Take particular care in cleaning the outer edges of the strip
 to be treated, to ensure the prime or tack coat will adhere.
 When applying prime or tack coat adjacent to curb and gutter, valley gutter, or any other
 concrete surfaces, cover such concrete surfaces, except where they are to be covered with a
 bituminous wearing course, with heavy paper or otherwise protect them as approved by the
 Engineer, while applying prime or tack coat. Remove any bituminous material deposited on such
 concrete surfaces.
 300-6 Weather Limitations.
 Do not apply prime and tack coats when the air temperature in the shade and away from
 artificial heat is less than 40ºF at the location where the application is to be made or when
 weather conditions or the surface conditions are otherwise unfavorable.
 300-7 Application of Prime Coat.
 300-7.1 General: Clean the surface to be primed and ensure the moisture content of the
 base does not exceed the optimum moisture. Heat the prime coat material to the temperature
 recommended by the prime coat manufacturer. Apply the material with a pressure distributor.
 Determine the application amount based on the character of the surface. Use an amount sufficient
 to coat the surface thoroughly and uniformly with no excess.
 300-7.2 Application Rate: Use an application rate as defined in Table 300-1. Control the
 application rate within the minimum and plus 0.01 gallon per square yard of the minimum
 application rate. The minimum application rate may be adjusted by the Engineer to meet specific
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 253
 
 field conditions. Determine and record the application rate a minimum of twice per day, once at
 the beginning of each day’s production and, as needed, to control the operation.

 300-7.3 Sprinkling: If required by the Engineer, lightly sprinkle the base with water and
 roll it with a traffic roller in advance of the prime coat application.
 300-7.4 Partial Width of Application: If traffic conditions warrant, the Engineer may
 require the application be made on only one-half the width of the base at one time, in which case,
 use positive means to secure the correct amount of bituminous material at the joint.
 300-8 Application of Tack Coat.
 300-8.1 General: Where the Engineer requires a tack coat prior to laying a bituminous
 surface, apply the tack coat as specified herein below.
 300-8.2 Where Required: Place a tack coat on all asphalt layers prior to constructing the
 next course. In general, the Engineer will not require a tack coat on primed bases except in areas
 that have become excessively dirty and cannot be cleaned, or in areas where the prime has cured
 to the extent all bonding effect has been lost.
 300-8.3 Method of Application: Apply the tack coat with a pressure distributor except
 on small jobs, if approved by the Engineer, apply it by other mechanical devices or by hand
 methods. Heat the bituminous material to a suitable temperature as designated by the Engineer,
 and apply it in a thin, uniform layer.
 300-8.4 Application Rate: Use an application rate defined in Table 300-2. Control the
 application rate within plus or minus 0.01 gallon per square yard of the target application rate.
 The target application rate may be adjusted by the Engineer to meet specific field conditions.
 Determine and record the application rate a minimum of twice per day, once at the beginning of
 each day’s production and again, as needed, to control the operation. When using PG 52-28,
 multiply the target application rate by 0.6.

 300-8.5 Curing and Time of Application: Apply tack coat sufficiently in advance of
 placing bituminous mix to permit drying, but do not apply tack coat so far in advance that it
 might lose its adhesiveness as a result of being covered with dust or other foreign material.
 300-8.6 Protection: Keep the tack coat surface free from traffic until the subsequent layer
 of bituminous hot mix has been laid.
 300-9 Method of Measurement.
 300-9.1 General: The quantity specified will be the volume, in gallons, of bituminous
 material actually applied and accepted. This spread rate will be determined from measurements
 made by the Contractor and verified by the Engineer based on tank calibrations, as specified in
 300-9.2. Where it is specified prime coat or tack coat material is to be diluted with water, the
 amount specified for the spread rate will be the volume after dilution.
 300-9.2 Calibration of Tanks: Ensure all distributors used for applying tack or prime
 coats are calibrated prior to use by a reliable and recognized firm engaged in calibrating tanks.
 Submit a certification of calibration and the calibration chart to the Engineer prior to use. In lieu
 of a volumetrically calibrated distributor, use a distributor equipped with a calibrated meter
 approved by the Engineer.
 300-9.3 Temperature Correction: Measure the volume and increase or decrease the
 volume actually measured to a corrected volume at a temperature of 60ºF.
 Make the correction for temperature by applying the applicable conversion factor
 (K), as shown below.
 For petroleum oils having a specific gravity (60ºF/60ºF) above 0.966, K = 0.00035
 per degree.
 For petroleum oils having a specific gravity (60ºF/60ºF) of between 0.850 and
 0.966, K = 0.00040 per degree.
 For emulsified asphalt, K = 0.00025 per degree.
 When volume-correction tables based on the above conversion factors are not
 available, use the following formula in computing the corrections for volumetric change:
 1
 
 V=
 
 Where:
 
 V
 K (T - 60) + 1
 
 V= Volume of bituminous material at 60ºF (pay volume).
 V1= Volume of bituminous material as measured.
 K= Correction factor (Coefficient of Expansion).
 T= Temperature (in ºF), of bituminous material when measured.

 320-3.1 General: Design, manufacture, coordinate, and operate the asphalt plant in a
 manner that will consistently produce a mixture within the required tolerances and temperatures
 specified.
 320-3.2 Electronic Weigh Systems: Equip the asphalt plant with an electronic weigh
 system that has an automatic printout, is certified every six months by an approved certified scale
 technician, and meets monthly comparison checks with certified truck scales as specified in 3203.2.4. Weigh all plant produced hot mix asphalt on the electronic weigh system, regardless of the
 method of measurement for payment.
 Include, as a minimum, the following information on the printed delivery ticket:
 1. Sequential load number
 2. Project number
 3. Date
 4. Name and location of plant
 5. Mix design number
 6. Place for hand-recording mix temperature

 Print the delivery ticket with an original and at least one copy. Furnish the
 original to the Engineer at the plant and one copy to the Engineer at the paving site.
 Utilize any one of the following three electronic weigh systems.
 320-3.2.1 Electronic Weigh System on the Truck Scales: Provide an electronic
 weigh system on all truck scales, which is equipped with an automatic recordation system that is
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 258
 
 approved by the Engineer. Use scales of the type that directly indicate the total weight of the
 loaded truck. Use scales meeting the requirements for accuracy, condition, etc., of the Bureau of
 Weights and Measures of the Florida Department of Agriculture, and re-certify such fact every
 six months, either by the Bureau of Weights and Measures or by a registered scale technician.
 320-3.2.2 Electronic Weigh System on Hoppers Beneath a Surge or Storage
 Bin: Provide an electronic weigh system on the hopper (hopper scales or load cells) beneath the
 surge or storage bin, which is equipped with an automatic recordation system approved by the
 Engineer.
 320-3.2.3 Automatic Batch Plants with Printout: For batch plants, provide an
 approved automatic printer system which will print the individual or cumulative weights of
 aggregate and liquid asphalt delivered to the pugmill and the total net weight of the asphalt mix
 measured by hopper scales or load cell type scales. Use the automatic printer system only in
 conjunction with automatic batching and mixing control systems that have been approved by the
 Engineer.
 320-3.2.4 Monthly Electronic Weigh System Comparison Checks: Check the
 accuracy of the electronic weighing system at the commencement of production and thereafter at
 least every 30 days during production by one of the following two methods and maintain a
 record of the weights in the Scale Check Worksheet.
 320-3.2.4.1. Electronic Weigh System on Truck Scales:
 1. The Engineer will randomly select a loaded truck of asphalt mix,
 a loaded aggregate haul truck, or another vehicle type approved by the Engineer and record the
 truck number and gross weight from the Contractor’s delivery ticket.
 2. Weigh the selected truck on a certified truck scale, which is not
 owned by the Contractor and record the gross weight for the comparison check. If another
 certified truck scale is not available, the Engineer may permit another set of certified truck scales
 owned by the Contractor to be used. The Engineer may elect to witness the scale check.
 3. The gross weight of the loaded truck as shown on the
 Contractor’s delivery ticket will be compared to the gross weight of the loaded truck from the
 other certified truck scale. The maximum permissible deviation is 8 pounds per ton of load,
 based on the certified truck scale weight.
 4. If the distance from the asphalt plant to the nearest certified
 truck scale is enough for fuel consumption to affect the accuracy of the comparison checks, a
 fuel adjustment may be calculated by using the truck odometer readings for the distance
 measurement, and 6.1 miles per gallon for the fuel consumption rate, and 115 ounces per gallon
 for fuel weight.
 5. During production, when an additional certified truck scale is
 not available for comparison checks, the Engineer may permit the Contractor to weigh the truck
 on his certified scales used during production and then weigh it on another certified truck scale,
 as soon the other scale is available for the comparison checks.
 In addition to the periodic checks as specified above, check the
 scales at any time the accuracy of the scales becomes questionable. When such inaccuracy does
 not appear to be sufficient to seriously affect the weighing operations, the Engineer will allow a
 period of two calendar days for the Contractor to conduct the required scale check. However, in
 the event the indicated inaccuracy is sufficient to seriously affect the mixture, the Engineer may
 require immediate shut-down until the accuracy of the scales has been checked and necessary
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 259
 
 corrections have been made. Include the cost of all scale checks in the bid price for asphalt
 concrete, at no additional cost to the Department.
 320-3.2.4.2. Electronic Weigh System on Hoppers Beneath a Surge or
 Storage Bin and Automatic Batch Plants with Printout:
 1. The Engineer will randomly select a loaded truck of asphalt mix
 and record the truck number, and the net weight of the asphalt mix from the Contractor’s
 delivery ticket.
 2. Weigh the selected truck on a certified truck scale, which is not
 owned by the Contractor and record the gross weight for the comparison check. If another
 certified truck scale is not available, the Engineer may permit another set of certified truck scales
 owned by the Contractor to be used. The Engineer may elect to witness the scale check.
 3. Deliver the asphalt mix to the project, then weigh the selected
 empty truck on the same certified truck scales. Record the tare weight of the truck.
 4. Compare the net weight of the asphalt mix from the delivery
 ticket to the calculated net weight of the asphalt mix as determined by the certified truck scale
 weights. The maximum permissible deviation is 8 pounds per ton of load, based on the certified
 truck scale weight.
 5. Use the fuel adjustment as specified in 320-3.2.4.1(4), when the
 distance from the asphalt plant to the nearest certified truck scale is enough for fuel consumption
 to affect the accuracy of the comparison checks.
 6. During production, when an additional certified truck scale is
 not available for comparison checks, the Engineer may permit the Contractor to load a truck with
 aggregate from the pugmill, surge or storage bin, and follow the above procedures to conduct the
 comparison checks as soon as certified truck scale is available.
 If the check shows a greater difference than the tolerance specified
 above, then recheck on a second set of certified scales. If the check and recheck indicate that the
 printed weight is out of tolerance, have a certified scale technician check the electronic weigh
 system and certify the accuracy of the printer. While the system is out of tolerance and before its
 adjustment, the Engineer may allow the Contractor to continue production only if provisions are
 made to use a set of certified truck scales to determine the truck weights.
 320-3.3 Asphalt Binder: Meet the following requirements:
 320-3.3.1 Transportation: Deliver the asphalt binder to the asphalt plant at a
 temperature not to exceed 370°F, and equip the transport tanks with sampling and temperature
 sensing devices meeting the requirements of 300-3.2.
 320-3.3.2 Storage: Equip asphalt binder storage tanks to heat the liquid asphalt
 binder to the temperatures required for the various mixtures. Heat the material in such a manner
 that no flame comes in contact with the binder. Heat or insulate all pipe lines and fittings. Use a
 circulating system of adequate size to ensure proper and continuous circulation during the entire
 operating period. Locate a thermometer, reading from 200 to 400°F, either in the storage tank or
 in the asphalt binder feed line. Maintain the asphalt binder in storage within a range of 230 to
 370°F in advance of mixing operations. Locate a sampling device on the discharge piping exiting
 the storage tank or at a location as approved by the Engineer. Provide a metal can of one quart
 capacity for binder sampling at the request of the Engineer.
 320-3.4 Aggregate: Meet the following requirements:
 320-3.4.1 Stockpiles: Place each aggregate component in an individual stockpile,
 and separate each from the adjacent stockpiles, either by space or by a system of bulkheads.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 260
 
 Prevent the intermingling of different materials in stockpiles at all times. Identify each stockpile,
 including RAP, as shown on the mix design.
 Form and maintain stockpiles in a manner that will prevent segregation. If
 a stockpile is determined to be segregated, discontinue the use of the material on the project until
 the appropriate actions have been taken to correct the problem.
 320-3.4.2 Blending of Aggregates: Stockpile all aggregates prior to blending or
 placing in the cold feed bins. If mineral filler or hydrated lime is required in the mix, feed or
 weigh it in separately from the other aggregates.
 320-3.4.2.1 Cold Feed Bin: Provide a separate cold feed bin for each
 component of the fine and coarse aggregate required by the mix design. Equip the cold feed bins
 with accurate mechanical means for feeding the aggregate uniformly into the dryer in the
 proportions required for the finished mix to maintain uniform production and temperature. When
 using RAP as a component material, prevent any oversized RAP from being incorporated into
 the completed mixture by the use of: a grizzly or grid over the RAP bin; in-line roller or impact
 crusher; screen; or other suitable means. If oversized RAP material appears in the completed
 recycled mix, take the appropriate corrective action immediately. If the appropriate corrective
 actions are not immediately taken, stop plant operations.
 Use separate bin compartments in the cold aggregate feeder that
 are constructed to prevent any spilling or leakage of aggregate from one cold feed bin to another.
 Ensure that each cold feed bin compartment has the capacity and design to permit a uniform flow
 of aggregates. Mount all cold feed bin compartments over a feeder of uniform speed, which will
 deliver the specified proportions of the separate aggregates to the drier at all times. If necessary,
 equip the cold feed bins with vibrators to ensure a uniform flow of the aggregates at all times.
 320-3.4.2.2 Gates and Feeder Belts: Provide each cold feed bin
 compartment with a gate and feeder belt, both of which are adjustable to assure the aggregate is
 proportioned to meet the requirements of the mix design.
 320-3.4.3 Screening Unit: Remove any oversized pieces of aggregate by the use
 of a scalping screen. Do not return this oversized material to the stockpile for reuse unless it has
 been crushed and reprocessed into sizes that will pass the scalping screen. Ensure that the
 quantity of aggregates being discharged onto the screens does not exceed the capacity of the
 screens to actually separate the aggregates into the required sizes.
 320-3.5 Dryer: Provide a dryer of satisfactory design for heating and drying the
 aggregate. Use a dryer capable of heating the aggregate to within the specified temperature range
 for any mix, and equip the dryer with an electric pyrometer placed at the discharge chute to
 automatically register the temperature of the heated aggregates.
 320-3.6 Asphalt Binder Control Unit: Provide a satisfactory means, either by weighing,
 metering, or volumetric measuring, to obtain the proper amount of asphalt binder material in the
 mix, within the tolerance specified for the mix design.
 320-3.7 Contractor’s Responsibilities: Acceptance of any automatic delivery ticket
 printout, electronic weight delivery ticket, other evidence of weight of the materials or approval
 of any particular type of material or production method will not constitute agreement by the
 Department that such matters are in accordance with the Contract Documents and it shall be the
 Contractor’s responsibility to ensure that the materials delivered to the project are in accordance
 with the Contract Documents.

 320-4 Additional Requirements for Batch Plants.
 320-4.1 Heating and Drying: Heat and dry the aggregate before screening. Control the
 temperature of the aggregate so the temperature of the completed mixture at the plant falls within
 the permissible range allowed by this Section.
 320-4.2 Gradation Unit: Provide plant screens capable of separating the fine and coarse
 aggregates and of further separating the coarse aggregate into specific sizes. In addition, equip
 the gradation unit with a scalping screen to restrict the maximum size of the aggregates. In the
 event that the plant is equipped with cold feed bins that are capable of adequately controlling the
 gradation of the mixture, the use of plant screens is optional.
 320-4.3 Hot Bins: Provide storage bins of sufficient capacity to supply the mixer when it
 is operating at full capacity. Provide hot bins with divided compartments to ensure separate and
 adequate storage of the appropriate fractions of the aggregate. Equip each compartment with an
 overflow chute of suitable size and location to prevent any backing up of material into other bins.
 320-4.4 Weigh Box or Hopper: Equip the batch plant with a means for accurately
 weighing each bin size of aggregate and the mineral filler into the weigh box or hopper.
 320-4.5 Pugmills: Utilize a pugmill capable of mixing the aggregate and the asphalt
 binder.
 320-5 Additional Requirements for Drum Mixer Plants.
 320-5.1 Weight Measurements of Aggregate: Equip the plant with a weigh-in-motion
 scale capable of measuring the quantity of aggregate (and RAP) entering the dryer.
 320-5.2 Synchronization of Aggregate Feed and Asphalt Binder Feed: Couple the
 asphalt binder feed control with the total aggregate weight device, including the RAP feed, in
 such a manner as to automatically vary the asphalt binder feed rate as necessary to maintain the
 required proportions.
 320-5.3 Hot Storage or Surge Bins: Equip the plant with either a surge bin or storage
 silo that is capable of storing an adequate amount of material to assure a uniform and consistent
 product.
 320-6 Preparation of the Mixture.
 320-6.1 Mixing: After the aggregate is dried and properly proportioned, mix the
 aggregate, along with any other components, with the asphalt binder to produce a thoroughly and
 uniformly coated mixture. Do not produce the mix by altering the component blend percentage
 of the RAP or sand by more than plus or minus 5.0% from the job mix formula on the approved
 mix design. For mix designs using fractionated RAP, the combined blend change for all RAP
 components must not exceed plus or minus 5.0%. The plus or minus 5.0% maximum component
 change does not apply to crushed virgin aggregate components during production.
 320-6.2 Storage: If necessary, store the asphalt mixture in a surge bin or hot storage silo
 for a maximum of 72 hours. For FC-5 mixtures, store the asphalt mixture in a surge bin or hot
 storage silo for a maximum of one hour.
 320-6.3 Mix Temperature: Produce the mixture with a temperature within the master
 range as defined in Table 320-2.
 320-6.3.1 Test Requirements: Determine the temperature of the completed
 mixture using a quick-reading thermometer through a hole in the side of the loaded truck
 immediately after loading. Locate a 1/4 inch hole on both sides of the truck body within the
 middle third of the length of the body, and at a distance from 6 to 10 inches above the surface
 supporting the mixture. If a truck body already has a hole located in the general vicinity of the
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 262
 
 specified location, use this hole. At the Engineer’s discretion, the Contractor may take the
 temperature of the load over the top of the truck in lieu of using the hole in the side of the truck.
 320-6.3.2 Test Frequency: The normal frequency for taking asphalt mix
 temperatures will be for each day, for each design mix on the first five loads and one out of every
 five loads thereafter. Take the temperature of the asphalt mix at the plant and at the roadway
 before the mix is placed at the normal frequency. Record the temperature on the front of the
 respective delivery ticket. The Engineer shall review the plant and roadway temperature readings
 and may take additional temperature measurements at any time.
 If any single load at the plant or at the roadway is within the master range
 shown in Table 320-2 but does not meet the criteria shown in Table 320-3 (for single
 measurements or the average of five consecutive measurements), the temperature of every load
 will be monitored until the temperature falls within the specified tolerance range in Table 320-3;
 at this time the normal frequency may be resumed. For warm mix asphalt, the Contractor may
 produce the first five loads of the production day and at other times when approved by the
 Engineer, at a hot mix asphalt temperature not to exceed 330°F for purposes of heating the
 asphalt paver. For this situation, the upper tolerances of Tables 320-2 and 320-3 as applied to the
 warm mix asphalt mix design do not apply.
 For windrow paving, in addition to the truck load temperature
 measurements noted above, perform windrow temperature measurements at a frequency of one
 measurement per 500 feet of windrow placed. Check the temperature of the windrow asphalt
 mixture using a quick-reading thermometer or directly in front of the windrow material transfer
 vehicle, but not so close that paving must be stopped. Measure the temperature of the windrow
 beneath the exposed surface by shoveling away a portion of the windrow and then measuring the
 temperature. For windrow temperature measurements, the requirements of Table 320-2 and 3203 apply.
 320-6.3.3 Rejection Criteria: Reject any load or portion of a load of asphalt mix
 at the plant or at the roadway with a temperature outside of its respective master range shown in
 Table 320-2. Notify the Engineer of the rejection immediately.

 coat the inside surface of the truck bodies with soapy water or an asphalt release agent as needed
 to prevent the mixture from adhering to the beds. Do not allow excess liquid to pond in the truck
 body. Do not use a release agent that will contaminate, degrade, or alter the characteristics of the
 asphalt mix or is hazardous or detrimental to the environment. Petroleum derivatives (such as
 diesel fuel), solvents, and any product that dissolves asphalt are prohibited. Provide each truck
 with a tarpaulin or other waterproof cover mounted in such a manner that it can cover the entire
 load when required. When in place, overlap the waterproof cover on all sides so that it can be
 tied down. Cover each load during cool and cloudy weather and at any time it appears rain is
 likely during transit with a tarpaulin or waterproof cover. Cover and tie down all loads of friction
 course mixtures.

 SECTION 327
 MILLING OF EXISTING ASPHALT PAVEMENT
 327-1 Description.
 Remove existing asphalt concrete pavement by milling to improve the rideability and
 cross slope of the finished pavement, to lower the finished grade adjacent to existing curb before
 resurfacing, or to completely remove existing pavement.
 When milling to improve rideability, the Plans will specify an average depth of cut.
 Take ownership of milled material.
 327-2 Equipment.
 Provide a milling machine capable of maintaining a depth of cut and cross slope to
 achieve the results specified in the Contract Documents. Use a machine with a minimum overall
 length (out-to-out measurement excluding the conveyor) of 18 feet and a minimum cutting width
 of 6 feet.
 Equip the milling machine with a built-in automatic grade control system that can control
 the transverse slope and the longitudinal profile to produce the specified results.
 To start the project, the Engineer will approve any commercially manufactured milling
 machine that meets the above requirements. If it becomes evident after starting milling that the
 milling machine cannot consistently produce the specified results, the Engineer will reject the
 milling machine for further use.
 The Contractor may use a smaller milling machine when milling to lower the grade
 adjacent to existing curb or other areas where it is impractical to use the above described
 equipment.
 Equip the milling machine with means to effectively limit the amount of dust escaping
 during the removal operation.
 For complete pavement removal, the Engineer may approve the use of alternate removal
 and crushing equipment instead of the equipment specified above.
 327-3 Construction.
 327-3.1 General: Remove the existing raised pavement markers (RPMs) before milling.
 Include the cost of removing existing RPMs in the price for milling.
 When milling to improve rideability or cross slope, remove the existing pavement
 to the average depth specified in the Plans, in a manner that will restore the pavement surface to a
 uniform cross-section and longitudinal profile. The Engineer may require the use of a stringline
 to ensure maintaining the proper alignment.
 Establish the longitudinal profile of the milled surface in accordance with the
 milling plans. Ensure the final cross slope of the milled surface parallels the surface cross slope
 shown in the Plans or as directed by the Engineer. Establish the cross slope of the milled surface
 by a second sensing device near the outside edge of the cut or by an automatic cross slope control
 mechanism. The Plans may waive the requirement of automatic grade or cross slope controls
 where the situation warrants such action.
 Operate the milling machine to minimize the amount of dust being emitted. The
 Engineer may require prewetting of the pavement.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 265
 
 Provide positive drainage of the milled surface and the adjacent pavement.
 Perform this operation on the same day as milling. Repave all milled surfaces no later than the
 day after the surface was milled.
 If traffic is to be maintained on the milled surface before the placement of the new
 asphalt concrete, provide suitable transitions between areas of varying thickness to create a
 smooth longitudinal riding surface. Produce a pattern of striations that will provide an acceptable
 riding surface. The Engineer will control the traveling speed of the milling machine to produce a
 texture that will provide an acceptable riding surface.
 Before opening an area which has been milled to traffic, sweep the pavement and
 gutters with a power broom or other approved equipment to remove, to the greatest extent
 practicable, fine material which will create dust under traffic. Sweep in a manner to minimize the
 potential for creation of a traffic hazard and to minimize air pollution. Do not sweep or allow
 milled asphalt into inlets.
 Sweep the milled surface with a power broom before placing asphalt concrete.
 In urban and other sensitive areas, use a street sweeper or other equipment capable
 of removing excess milled materials and controlling dust. Obtain the Engineer’s approval of such
 equipment, contingent upon its demonstrated ability to do the work.
 Perform the sweeping operation immediately after the milling operations or as
 directed by the Engineer.
 327-3.2 Quality Control Requirements: Furnish a four foot long electronic level
 accurate to 0.1 degree, approved by the Engineer for the control of cross slope. Make this
 electronic level available at the jobsite at all times during milling operations. Calibrate and
 compare electronic levels in accordance with 330-9.3.1 at a minimum frequency of once per day
 before any milling operation.
 Multiple cuts may be made to achieve the required pavement configuration or
 depth of cut.
 327-3.2.1 Cross Slope Measurement: Measure the cross slope of the milled
 surface by placing the level at the center of the lane and perpendicular to the roadway centerline.
 Record all the measurements to the nearest 0.1% on an approved form and submit the data to the
 Engineer.
 327-3.2.1.1 Cross Slope Measurement Frequency:
 1. Tangent Sections: Measure the cross slope at a minimum
 frequency of one measurement every 100 feet per lane. When the average absolute deviation is
 consistently within the acceptance tolerance in Table 327-1, upon approval by the Engineer, the
 frequency of the cross slope measurements can be reduced to one measurement every 200 feet.
 2. Superelevated Sections: Measure the cross slope every 100 feet
 per lane within the length of full superelevation. For curves where the length of full
 superelevation is less than 250 feet, measure the cross slope at the beginning point, midpoint, and
 ending point of the fully superelevated section. For transition sections, measure the cross slope at
 control points identified in the Plans or, if not shown in the Plans, at a control point at a location
 of 0.0% cross slope.
 327-3.2.1.2 Cross Slope Deviations and Corrections: Calculate the
 absolute deviation of each cross slope measurement and the average of the absolute deviations of
 ten consecutive cross slope measurements. The absolute deviation is the positive value of a
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 266
 
 deviation. In superelevated sections, when the number of measurements is less than ten, average
 the absolute deviation of all measurements.
 If the average absolute deviation of any cross slope measurement
 falls outside the acceptance tolerance shown in Table 327-1, stop the milling operations and
 make adjustments until the problem is resolved to the satisfaction of the Engineer. If an
 individual cross slope deviation falls outside the acceptance tolerance as shown in Table 327-1,
 make corrections only in the deficient area to the satisfaction of the Engineer at no cost to the
 Department. For pavement with multiple cuts, the deficient areas not caused by the final cut may
 be left in place upon approval of the Engineer. All milling corrections shall be completed before
 placement of the asphalt course unless stated otherwise in the Plans or as determined by the
 Engineer.
 The limits of deficient areas requiring correction may be verified
 and adjusted with more accurate measurement methods, including survey instruments, upon
 approval of the Engineer and at no cost to the Department.
 Should the Contractor wish to have any required corrections
 waived, submit a request to the Engineer for approval. The Engineer may waive the corrections at
 no reduction in payment if the deficiencies are sufficiently separated so as not to significantly
 affect the final cross slope or project grade.
 For intersections, tapers, crossovers, transitions at the beginning
 and end of the project, bridge approaches and similar areas, adjust the cross slope to match the
 actual site conditions, or as directed.

 In the event the distance between two edges of deficient areas is less than 100 feet,
 the correction work shall include the area between the deficient areas.
 327-3.3 Verification: The Engineer will verify the Contractor’s cross slope
 measurements by randomly taking a minimum of ten cross slope measurements per lane per mile
 in tangent sections, at control points in transition sections, and a minimum of three cross slope
 measurements in fully superelevated sections. The Engineer will measure the cross slope of the
 milled surface by placing the level at the center of the lane and perpendicular to the roadway
 centerline.
 327-3.3.1 Cross Slope Deviations and Corrections: If the average absolute
 deviation or an individual cross slope deviation falls outside the acceptance tolerance in Table
 327-1, immediately make a comparison check at the QC test locations to verify the QC
 measurements in the section. If the comparisons are beyond the acceptable comparison tolerance
 in accordance with 327-3.2, stop the milling operation until the issue is resolved to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer. Correct any cross slope not meeting the individual deviation

 acceptance tolerance at no cost to the Department. The Engineer reserves the right to check the
 cross slope of the milled surface at any time by taking cross slope measurements at any location.
 327-4 Milled Surface.
 Provide a milled surface with a reasonably uniform texture, within 1/4 inch of a true
 profile grade, and with no deviation in excess of 1/4 inch from a straightedge applied to the
 pavement perpendicular to the centerline. Ensure the variation of the longitudinal joint between
 multiple cut areas does not exceed 1/4 inch. The Engineer may accept areas varying from a true
 surface in excess of the above stated tolerance without correction if the Engineer determines they
 were caused by a pre-existing condition which could not have reasonably been corrected by the
 milling operations. Correct any unsuitable texture or profile, as determined by the Engineer, at no
 cost to the Department.
 The Engineer may require remilling of any area where a surface lamination causes a nonuniform texture to occur.
 327-5 Method of Measurement.
 The quantity to be paid for will be the plan quantity area, in square yards, over which
 milling is completed and accepted.
 327-6 Basis of Payment.
 Price and payment will be full compensation for all work specified in this Section,
 including hauling off and stockpiling or otherwise disposing of the milled material.
 Payment will be made under:

 HOT MIX ASPHALT GENERAL CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
 330-1 Description.
 This Section specifies the basic equipment and construction requirements for hot mix
 asphalt (including warm mix asphalt) pavements and bases. Establish and maintain a quality
 control system that provides assurance that all materials, products and completed construction
 submitted for acceptance meet Contract requirements.
 330-2 Quality Control (QC) Requirements.
 330-2.1 Minimum QC Requirements: Perform as a minimum, the following activities
 necessary to maintain process control and meet Specification requirements:
 1. Pavement Density: Monitor the pavement temperature with an infrared
 temperature device so compaction is completed before the surface temperature of the pavement
 drops to the extent that effective compaction may not be achieved or the rollers begin to damage
 the pavement. Monitor the roadway density with either 6 inch diameter roadway cores, a nuclear
 density gauge, or other density measuring device, at a minimum frequency of once per 1,500 feet
 of pavement.
 2. Mix Temperature: Determine the mix temperature at the roadway for the first
 five loads and one out of every five loads thereafter.
 3. Mix Spread Rate: Monitor the mix spread rate at the beginning of each day’s
 production, and as needed to control the operations, at a minimum of once per 200 tons placed.
 When determining the spread rate, use, at a minimum, an average of five truckloads of mix.
 4. Pavement Texture: Monitor the pavement texture to minimize pavement
 segregation. Use density gauges, infrared temperature measurement devices, or roadway cores at
 the beginning of each day’s production, and as necessary, both at truck exchanges and during
 normal paving operations.
 5. Reporting: Ensure the accuracy of the QC Roadway Reports on the
 Department’s approved form to reflect the actual surface area of the finished work and be in
 compliance with the requirements of the Contract Documents.
 330-2.2 Personnel Qualifications: Provide QC Technicians in accordance with
 Section 105.
 330-3 Limitations of Operations.
 330-3.1 Weather Limitations: Do not transport asphalt mix from the plant to the
 roadway unless all weather conditions are suitable for the paving operations.
 330-3.2 Limitations of Paving Operations:
 330-3.2.1 General: Place the mixture only when the surface upon which it is to
 be placed has been previously prepared, is intact, firm, dry, clean, and the tack or prime coat,
 with acceptable spread rate, is properly broken or cured. Do not place friction course until the
 adjacent shoulder area has been dressed and grassed.
 330-3.2.2 Ambient Air Temperature: Place the mixture only when the air
 temperature in the shade and away from artificial heat meets requirements of Table 330-1. The
 minimum ambient temperature requirement may be reduced by 5ºF when using warm mix
 technology, if mutually agreed to by both the Engineer and the Contractor.

 an exception, place the mixture at temperatures no lower than 60ºF, only when approved by the Engineer based on the
 Contractor’s demonstrated ability to achieve a satisfactory surface texture and appearance of the finished surface. The minimum
 ambient temperature may be further reduced to 55ºF when using warm mix technology, if agreed to by both the Engineer and the
 Contractor.
 
 330-3.2.3 Rain and Surface Conditions: Immediately cease transportation of
 asphalt mixtures from the plant when rain begins at the roadway. Do not place asphalt mixtures
 while rain is falling, or when there is water on the surface to be covered. Once the rain has
 stopped, standing water has been removed from the tacked surface to the satisfaction of the
 Engineer, and the temperature of the mixture caught in transit still meets the requirements as
 specified in 320-6.3, the Contractor may then place the mixture caught in transit.
 For windrow paving, immediately cease dumping of asphalt material when
 rain begins at the roadway. Stop paving operations while rain is falling or where there is water on
 the surface to be covered. Remove windrowed asphalt mixture exposed to rain. Once the rain has
 stopped, standing water has been removed from the tacked surface to the satisfaction of the
 Engineer, and the temperature of the mixture caught in transit still meets the requirements as
 specified in 320-6.3, the Contractor may then windrow the remaining material caught in transit.
 330-3.2.4 Wind: Do not place the mixture when the wind is blowing to such an
 extent that proper and adequate compaction cannot be maintained or when sand, dust, etc., are
 being deposited on the surface being paved to the extent the bond between layers will be
 diminished.
 330-4 Surface Preparation.
 330-4.1 Cleaning: Before placing the mixture, clean the surface of the base or underlying
 pavement of all loose and deleterious material by the use of power brooms or blowers,
 supplemented by hand brooming where necessary.
 330-4.1.1 Application over Asphalt Membrane Interlayer (AMI): Where an
 asphalt mix is to be placed over a newly constructed AMI, do not sweep or otherwise disturb the
 cover material before placing the asphalt mix, unless directed by the Engineer.
 330-4.2 Tacking: Apply a tack coat on all existing pavement surfaces that are to be
 overlaid with an asphalt mix as specified in Section 300 and between successive layers of all
 asphalt mixes. Apply tack on a clean surface.
 Do not place tack while rain is falling or when there is water on the surface to be
 tacked. Once the rain has stopped, standing water has been removed from the surface to be
 tacked to the satisfaction of the Engineer, the Contractor may then apply tack.
 Apply a tack coat on freshly primed bases only when directed by the Engineer.

 330-5 Paving Equipment.
 330-5.1 General Requirements: Use mechanically-sound equipment capable of
 consistently meeting Specification requirements.
 330-5.2 Asphalt Paver:
 330-5.2.1 General: Provide a self-propelled asphalt paver that can be steered, and
 is equipped with a receiving and distribution hopper and a mechanical screed. Use a mechanical
 screed capable of adjustment to regulate the depth of material spread and to produce the desired
 cross-section.
 When asphalt mix is placed in windrows, operate windrow pickup
 equipment so substantially all of the mixture deposited on the roadbed is picked up and loaded
 into the paver. Prevent the windrow pickup equipment from contaminating the mixture.
 330-5.2.2 Automatic Screed Control: For all asphalt courses placed with an
 asphalt paver, equip the paver with automatic longitudinal screed controls of either the skid type,
 traveling stringline type, or non-contact averaging ski type with a minimum length of 25 feet. On
 the final layer of asphalt base, overbuild, structural courses, and friction courses, use the joint
 matcher instead of the skid, traveling stringline, or non-contact averaging ski on all passes after
 the initial pass. Equip the asphalt paver with electronic cross slope controls.
 330-5.2.3 Screed Width: Provide an asphalt paver with a screed width greater
 than 8 feet when required to pave full width lanes. Do not use extendable screed strike-off
 devices that do not provide preliminary compaction of the mat in place of fixed screed
 extensions. Use a strike-off device only on irregular areas that would normally be done by hand
 and on shoulders 5 feet or less in width. When using the strike-off device on shoulders, instead
 of an adjustable screed extension, demonstrate the ability to obtain acceptable texture, density,
 and thickness.
 When using an extendable screed device to extend the screed’s width on
 the full width lane or shoulder by 24 inches or greater, the Engineer will require an auger
 extension, paddle, or kicker device unless written documentation from the manufacturer is
 submitted stating these are not necessary.
 330-5.3 Rollers:
 330-5.3.1 Steel-Wheeled Rollers: Provide compaction equipment capable of
 meeting the density requirements described in the Specifications. When density testing is not
 required, and the standard rolling pattern is used, provide a tandem steel-wheeled roller weighing
 5 to 15 tons for breakdown rolling. For finish rolling, use a separate roller weighing 5 to 15 tons.
 Variations from these requirements shall be approved by the Engineer.
 330-5.3.2 Traffic Rollers: Provide compaction equipment capable of meeting the
 density requirements described in the Specifications. When density testing is not required, and
 the standard rolling pattern is used, provide a self-propelled, pneumatic-tired traffic roller
 equipped with at least seven smooth-tread, low pressure tires, equipped with pads or scrapers on
 each tire. Maintain the tire pressure between 50 and 55 psi or as specified by the manufacturer.
 Use rollers with a minimum weight of 6 tons. Do not use wobble-wheeled rollers. Variations
 from these requirements shall be approved by the Engineer.
 330-5.3.3 Prevention of Adhesion: Do not allow the mixture to adhere to the
 wheels of any rollers. Do not use fuel oil or other petroleum distillates to prevent adhesion. Do
 not use any method which results in water being sprinkled directly onto the mixture.
 330-5.4 Coring Equipment: Furnish a suitable saw or drill for obtaining the required
 density cores.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 271
 
 330-5.5 Hand Tools: Provide the necessary hand tools such as rakes, shovels, and other
 similar tools, and a suitable means for keeping them clean. Do not use diesel fuel or other
 petroleum based solvents contained in an open container for cleaning purposes on the paver.
 330-6 Placing Mixture.
 330-6.1 Requirements Applicable to All Pavement Types:
 330-6.1.1 Alignment of Edges: Place all asphalt mixtures by the stringline
 method to obtain an accurate, uniform alignment of the pavement edge. As an exception,
 pavement edges adjacent to curb and gutter or other true edges do not require a stringline.
 Control the unsupported pavement edge to ensure it will not deviate from the stringline more
 than plus or minus 1.5 inches.
 330-6.1.2 Paving Width: If necessary due to the traffic requirements, place the
 mixture in strips in such a manner as to provide for the passage of traffic. As an option, where
 the road is closed to traffic, place the mixture to the full width with machines traveling in
 echelon.
 330-6.1.3 Mix Temperature: Maintain the mix temperature at the time of paving
 within the master range as defined in 320-6.3. Take mix temperatures on the roadway at the
 minimum frequency indicated in 320-6.3. Any load, or portion of a load, of asphalt mix on the
 roadway with a temperature outside of the master range shall be rejected for use on the project.
 Immediately notify the Engineer of the rejection.
 Remove any windrow material not meeting the temperature requirements
 of 320-6.3.2 from the area of deficient temperature and replace with new asphalt meeting the
 temperature requirements.
 330-6.1.4 Speed of Paver: Establish the forward speed of the asphalt paver based
 on the rate of delivery of the mix to the roadway, but not faster than the optimum speed needed
 to adequately compact the pavement.
 330-6.1.5 Thickness and Spread Rate of Layers: Construct each layer as
 defined in the following table:
 Table 330-2
 Thickness and Target Spread Rate Requirements
 Mix Type
 Specification Section and Article
 Type SP
 334-1
 Type FC
 337-8
 Type B
 234-8
 ATPB
 287-8
 330-6.1.5.1 Thickness Control: Ensure the spread rate is within plus or
 minus 5% of the target spread rate. When determining the spread rate, use, at a minimum, an
 average of five truckloads of mix and at a maximum, an average of 10 truckloads of mix, except
 for windrow paving, use an average of three truckloads of mix. When the average spread rate is
 beyond plus or minus 5% of the target spread rate, monitor the thickness of the pavement layer
 closely and adjust the construction operations.
 When the average spread rate for two consecutive days is beyond
 plus or minus 5% of the target spread rate, stop the construction operation until the issue is
 resolved.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 272
 
 330-6.1.5.2 Maximum Spread Rate Tolerances: When an individual
 spread rate, measured in accordance with 330-6.1.5.1, is beyond plus or minus 20% of the target
 spread rate, stop the construction operation until the issue is resolved. Address the unacceptable
 pavement in accordance with 330-9.5. The following areas are exempt from a work stoppage
 based solely on the calculated spread rate: median crossovers, turnouts, variable thickness
 overbuild courses, leveling courses, miscellaneous asphalt pavement, as well as, turn lanes and
 ramps less than 1,000 feet.
 As an exception, the Engineer may allow the Contractor to leave
 areas in place if it is determined by the Engineer that the deficiency is not a significant detriment
 to the pavement quality. For areas of deficient thickness, a reduction to the pay item quantity will
 be made in accordance with 330-9.5.2.
 330-6.1.6 Correcting Defects: Before starting any rolling, check the surface;
 correct any irregularities; remove all drippings, sand accumulations from the screed, and fat
 spots from any source; and replace them with satisfactory material. Do not skin patch. When
 correcting a depression while the mixture is hot, scarify the surface and add fresh mixture.
 330-6.1.7 Hand Work: In limited areas where the use of the paver is impossible
 or impracticable, the Contractor may place and finish the mixture by hand.
 330-7 Compacting Mixture.
 330-7.1 General Requirements: When density testing for acceptance is required, select
 equipment, sequence, and coverage (number of times the roller passes over a given area of
 pavement) of rolling to meet the specified density requirement. Regardless of the rolling
 procedure used, complete the final rolling before the surface temperature of the pavement drops
 to the extent effective compaction may not be achieved or the rollers begin to damage the
 pavement.
 No vibratory compaction in the vertical direction will be allowed for layers one
 inch or less in thickness or, if the Engineer or Contract Documents limit compaction to the static
 mode only. Compact these layers in the static mode only. Other non-vertical vibratory modes of
 compaction will be allowed, if approved by the Engineer; however, no additional compensation,
 cost or time, will be made.
 330-7.2 Standard Rolling Procedure: When density testing for acceptance is not
 required, propose an alternative rolling pattern to be approved by the Engineer or use the
 following standard rolling procedure:
 1. Breakdown rolling: Provide two static coverages with a tandem steel-wheeled
 roller, following as close behind the paver as possible without pick-up, undue displacement, or
 blistering of the mix.
 2. Intermediate rolling: Provide five static coverages with a pneumatic-tire roller,
 following as close behind the breakdown rolling operation as the mix will permit.
 3. Finish rolling: Provide one static coverage with a tandem steel-wheeled roller,
 after completing the breakdown rolling and intermediate rolling, but before the surface pavement
 temperature drops to the extent effective compaction may not be achieved or the rollers begin to
 damage the pavement.
 330-7.3 Rolling Procedures: Use procedures that will uniformly compact the pavement
 layer to the desired density level, while meeting the appropriate smoothness requirements,
 without damaging the pavement surface, crushing aggregate or leaving excessive roller marks,
 roller heads, or ripples. While rolling is in progress, monitor the surface continuously, and adjust
 the compaction operations to comply with the surface requirements.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 273
 
 330-7.4 Compaction of Areas Inaccessible to Rollers: Use hand tamps or other
 satisfactory means to compact areas which are inaccessible to a roller, such as areas adjacent to
 curbs, gutters, bridges, manholes, etc.
 330-7.5 Correcting Defects: Do not allow the compaction equipment to deposit
 contaminants onto the pavement surface. Remove and replace any areas damaged by such
 deposits as directed by the Engineer. Correct any depressions that develop before completing the
 rolling by loosening the mixture and adding new mixture to bring the depressions to a true
 surface. Should any depression remain after obtaining the final compaction, remove the full
 depth of the mixture, and replace it with enough new mixture to form a true and even surface.
 Correct all defects before laying the subsequent course.
 330-7.6 Use of Traffic Roller: Use a traffic roller on the first overbuild course. Use a
 traffic roller or vibratory roller (unless restricted by the Contract Documents) on the first
 structural layer placed on an AMI.
 330-7.7 Compaction at Bridge Structures: Compact asphalt mixtures placed over
 bridge decks and approach slabs using static compaction only. Use the standard rolling procedure
 described in 330-7.2 or an alternative procedure approved by the Engineer.
 330-8 Joints.
 330-8.1 General: When laying fresh mixture against the exposed edges of joints, place it
 in close contact with the exposed edge to produce an even, well-compacted joint after rolling.
 330-8.2 Transverse Joints: Place the mixture as continuously as possible to minimize
 transverse joints. When constructing permanent transverse joints, meet the surface requirements
 as defined in 330-9. Construct temporary transverse joints in such a manner to allow traffic to
 pass over it. When resuming the paving operation, construct a transverse joint by cutting back on
 the previously placed pavement at a location where the straightedge requirements are met. At the
 project limits, tie into the adjoining pavement layers as shown in the Plans.
 330-8.3 Longitudinal Joints: Place each layer of pavement so all longitudinal
 construction joints are offset 6 to 12 inches laterally between successive layers. Plan offsets in
 advance so the longitudinal joints of the friction course are not in wheel path areas. The
 longitudinal joints for friction course layers should be within 6 inches of the lane edge or at the
 center of the lane. The Engineer may waive this requirement where offsetting is not feasible due
 to the sequence of construction.
 330-8.4 Placing Asphalt Next to Concrete Pavement: When placing asphalt next to
 concrete pavement, construct the joint as shown in the Plans.
 330-9 Surface Requirements.
 330-9.1 General: Construct a smooth pavement with good surface texture and the proper
 cross-slope.
 330-9.2 Texture of the Finished Surface of Paving Layers: Produce a finished surface
 of uniform texture and compaction with no pulled, torn, raveled, crushed or loosened portions
 and free of segregation, bleeding, flushing, sand streaks, sand spots, or ripples. Some examples
 of pavement deficiencies are displayed at the following URL:
 http://www.fdot.gov/programmanagement/Implemented/URLinSpecs/Pavement.shtm. Address
 any pavement not meeting the requirements of this specification in accordance with 330-9.5.
 For dense-graded structural and dense-graded friction course mixtures, in areas
 not defined as density testing exceptions per 334-5.1.2, obtain for the Engineer, three 6 inch
 diameter roadway cores at locations visually identified by the Engineer to be segregated. For
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 274
 
 areas that the Engineer identifies as being segregated, obtain and submit cores within 30 days of
 notification. The Engineer will determine the density of each core in accordance with FM 1T166 and calculate the percent Gmm of the segregated area using the average Gmb of the roadway
 cores and the QC sublot Gmm for the questionable material. If the average percent Gmm is less
 than 89.5, address the segregated area in accordance with 330-9.5.
 Do not use asphalt concrete mixtures containing aggregates that cause a different
 color appearance in the final wearing surface unless the section is greater than or equal to one
 mile in length and across the full width of the pavement, including shoulders and turn lanes.
 Exceptions to these requirements will be permitted if approved by the Engineer.
 330-9.3 Cross Slope: Construct a pavement surface with cross slopes in compliance with
 the requirements of the Contract Documents. Furnish a four foot long electronic level accurate to
 0.1 degree, approved by the Engineer for the control of cross slope. Make this electronic level
 available at the jobsite at all times during paving operations.
 330-9.3.1 QC Calibration and Comparison: Calibrate the electronic levels a
 minimum of once per day before paving operations begin, in accordance with manufacturer’s
 instructions.
 Compare the QC level with the Verification level before paving operations
 begin, and at any time as directed. If the comparison between the QC and Verification levels is
 within plus or minus 0.2%, the QC level is considered to compare favorably and can be used for
 measurement and acceptance of cross-slopes. If the levels do not compare favorably, perform a
 second comparison using another calibrated electronic level (Department or Contractor) for
 resolution. If the resolution level compares favorably with the QC level, the QC level is
 considered to be verified. If the resolution level does not compare favorably with the QC level,
 discontinue the use of the QC electronic level and obtain another approved electronic level that
 meets the requirements of this specification. The Contractor assumes all risk associated with
 placing the pavement at the correct cross slope.
 330-9.3.2 Cross Slope Measurement: Measure the cross slope of the compacted
 pavement surface by placing the level at the center of the lane and perpendicular to the roadway
 centerline. Record all measurements to the nearest 0.1% on an approved form and submit the
 data to the Engineer.
 330-9.3.2.1 Cross Slope Measurement Frequency:
 1. Tangent Sections: Measure the cross-slope at a minimum
 frequency of one measurement every 100 feet per lane. When the average absolute deviation is
 consistently within the acceptance tolerance in Table 330-4, upon the approval of the Engineer,
 the cross slope measurements may be reduced to one measurement every 200 feet.
 2. Superelevated Sections: Measure the cross slope every 100 feet
 per lane within the length of the full superelevation. For curves where the length of full
 superelevation is less than 250 feet, measure the cross slope at the beginning point, midpoint, and
 ending point of the fully superelevated section. For transition sections, measure the cross slope at
 control points identified in the Plans, or if not shown in the Plans, at a control point at the
 location of 0.0% cross slope.
 330-9.3.2.2 Cross Slope Deviations and Corrections: Calculate the
 absolute deviation of each cross slope measurement and the average of the absolute deviations of
 ten consecutive cross slope measurements. The absolute deviation is the positive value of a
 deviation. In superelevated sections, when the number of measurements is less than ten, average
 the absolute deviation of all measurements.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 275
 
 If the average absolute deviation of any cross slope measurement falls
 outside the acceptance tolerance shown in Table 330-4, stop the paving operation and make
 adjustments until the problem is resolved to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 Address, in accordance with 330-9.5, all individual cross slope deviations
 outside the acceptance tolerances shown in Table 330-4. Complete all corrections before
 placement of the final pavement surface layer. For pavement with multiple layers, the deficient
 areas for the structural course may be left in place, if approved by the Engineer. For friction
 course layers, make corrections in accordance with 330-9.5.
 The limits of deficient areas requiring correction may be verified and
 adjusted with more accurate measurement methods, including survey instruments, upon approval
 of the Engineer and at no cost to the Department.
 Should the Contractor wish to have any required corrections waived,
 submit a request to the Engineer for approval. The Engineer may waive the corrections at no
 reduction in payment if the deficiencies are sufficiently separated so as not to affect the
 pavement’s overall traffic safety, surface drainage, ride quality, or surface texture.
 For intersections, tapers, crossovers, transitions at the beginning and end
 of the project, bridge approaches and similar areas, adjust the cross slope to match the actual site
 conditions or as directed by the Engineer.

 In the event the distance between two edges of deficient areas is less than
 100 feet, the correction work shall include the area between the deficient areas.
 330-9.3.3 Verification: The Engineer will verify the Contractor’s cross slope
 measurements by randomly taking a minimum of ten cross slope measurements per lane per mile
 in tangent sections, at control points in transition sections, and a minimum of three cross slope
 measurements in fully superelevated sections.
 The Engineer will measure the cross slope of the compacted pavement
 surface by placing the level at the center of the lane and perpendicular to the roadway centerline.
 330-9.3.3.1 Cross Slope Deviations and Corrections: If the average
 absolute deviation or an individual cross slope deviation falls outside of the acceptance tolerance
 in Table 330-4, immediately make a comparison check at the QC test locations to verify the QC
 measurements in the section. If the comparisons are beyond the acceptable comparison tolerance
 in accordance with 330-9.3.1, stop the paving operations until the issue is resolved to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer. Correct any cross slope not meeting the individual deviation
 acceptance tolerance in accordance with 330-9.5 at no cost to the Department. The Engineer
 reserves the right to check the pavement cross slope at any time by taking cross slope
 measurements at any location.

 330-9.4 Pavement Smoothness: Construct a smooth pavement meeting the requirements
 of this Specification.
 330-9.4.1 General: Furnish a 15 foot manual and a 15 foot rolling straightedge
 meeting the requirements of FM 5-509. Obtain a smooth surface on all pavement courses placed,
 and then straightedge all layers as required by this Specification.
 330-9.4.2 Test Method: Perform all straightedge testing in accordance with
 FM 5-509 in the outside wheel path of each lane. The Engineer may require additional testing at
 other locations within the lane.
 330-9.4.3 Traffic Control: Provide traffic control in accordance with Section 102
 and Standard Plans, Index 102-607 or 102-619 during all testing. When traffic control cannot be
 provided in accordance with Index 102-607 or 102-619, submit an alternative Traffic Control
 Plan as specified in 102-4. Include the cost of this traffic control in the Contract bid prices for the
 asphalt items.
 330-9.4.4 Process Control Testing: Assume full responsibility for controlling all
 paving operations and processes such that the requirements of these Specifications are met at all
 times.
 330-9.4.5 QC Testing:
 330-9.4.5.1 General: Straightedge the final Type SP structural layer and
 friction course layer in accordance with 330-9.4.2, with the exception that if the method of
 acceptance is by laser profiler, then straightedging of the friction course layer is not required
 unless otherwise stated in the Specifications. If the project’s method of acceptance is by laser
 profiler, areas not suitable for testing with the laser profiler will be tested and accepted by
 straightedging. Test all pavement lanes and ramps where the width is constant and document all
 deficiencies in excess of 3/16 inch on a form approved by the Engineer.
 330-9.4.5.2 Straightedge Exceptions: Straightedge testing will not be
 required in the following areas: shoulders, intersections, tapers, crossovers, sidewalks, shared use
 paths, parking lots and similar areas, or in the following areas when they are less than 250 feet in
 length: turn lanes, acceleration/deceleration lanes and side streets. The limits of the intersection
 will be from stop bar to stop bar for both the mainline and side streets.
 As an exception, in the event the Engineer identifies an
 objectionable surface irregularity in the above areas, straightedge and address all deficiencies in
 excess of 3/8 inch in accordance with 330-9.5.
 The Engineer may waive straightedge requirements for transverse
 joints at the beginning and end of the project, at the beginning and end of bridge structures, at
 manholes, and at utility structures if the deficiencies are caused by factors beyond the control of
 the Contractor, as determined by the Engineer. In addition, the Engineer may also waive the
 straightedging requirements on ramps and superelevated sections where the geometrical
 orientation of the pavement results in an inaccurate measurement with the rolling straightedge.
 330-9.4.5.3 Intermediate Layers and Temporary Pavement: When the
 design speed is 55 mph or greater and the intermediate Type SP layer or temporary pavement is
 to be opened to traffic, if the Engineer identifies an objectionable surface irregularity,
 straightedge and address all deficiencies in excess of 3/8 inch within 72 hours of placement in
 accordance with 330-9.5.
 330-9.4.5.4 Final Type SP Structural Layer: Straightedge the final
 Type SP structural layer in accordance with 330-9.4.2, either behind the final roller of the paving
 train or as a separate operation. Notify the Engineer of the location and time of straightedge

 testing a minimum of 48 hours before beginning testing. The Engineer will verify the
 straightedge testing by observing the QC straight edging operations. Address all deficiencies in
 excess of 3/16 inch in accordance with 330-9.5.
 When the final structural course is to be opened to traffic and the
 design speed is 55 mph or greater, if any defect is 3/8 inch or greater, the Engineer may require
 deficiencies to be corrected within 72 hours after opening to traffic.
 330-9.4.5.5 Friction Course Layer: Where required per 330-9.4.5.1, and
 in areas noted in 330-9.4.6.2 as not suitable for testing with the Laser Profiler, straightedge the
 friction course layer in accordance with 330-9.4.2, either behind the final roller of the paving
 train or as a separate operation upon completion of all paving operations. Notify the Engineer of
 the location and time of straightedge testing a minimum of 48 hours before beginning testing.
 The Engineer will verify the straightedge testing by observing the QC straightedging operations.
 Address all deficiencies in excess of 3/16 inch in accordance with 330-9.5.
 330-9.4.6 Acceptance:
 330-9.4.6.1 Straightedge Acceptance: For areas of roadways where the
 design speed is less than 55 miles per hour, and for areas of roadways where the design speed is
 greater than or equal to 55 miles per hour which are noted in 330-9.4.6.2 as not suitable for
 testing with the Laser Profiler, acceptance for pavement smoothness of the friction course will be
 based on verified QC measurements using the straightedge as required by 330-9.4.5. The
 Engineer will verify the straightedge testing by observing the QC straightedging operations.
 330-9.4.6.2 Laser Acceptance: For areas of high speed roadways where
 the design speed is equal to or greater than 55 miles per hour, acceptance testing for pavement
 smoothness of the friction course (for mainline traffic lanes only) will be based on the Laser
 Profiler. Ramps, acceleration and deceleration lanes, and other areas not suitable for testing with
 the Laser Profiler will be tested and accepted with the straightedge in accordance with 3309.4.5.5 and 330-9.4.6.1.
 The pavement smoothness of each lane will be determined by a
 Laser Profiler furnished and operated by the Department in accordance with FM 5-549 and a
 report issued with the Ride Number (RN) reported to one decimal place. If corrections are made,
 as required following Laser Acceptance, the pavement will not be retested for smoothness using
 the Laser Profiler.
 For this testing, the pavement will be divided into 0.1 mile
 segments. Partial segments equal to or greater than 0.01 mile will be considered as a 0.1 mile
 segment. The pavement will be accepted as follows:
 1. For segments with a RN greater than or equal to 4.0, the
 pavement will be accepted at full pay.
 2. For segments with a RN less than 4.0, the Engineer will
 further evaluate the data in 0.01 mile intervals for both wheel paths.
 If the RN is 3.5 or above for all 0.01 mile intervals
 in both wheel paths, the segment will be accepted at full payment.
 If the RN is less than 3.5 for one or more 0.01 mile
 intervals, the segment will be tested with the rolling straightedge in both wheel paths in
 accordance with FM 5-509. If approved by the Engineer, this straightedging may be completed
 (in both wheel paths) as part of the QC straightedging operations described in 330-9.4.5.5, before
 testing with the laser profiler. Notify the Engineer of the location and time of straightedge testing
 a minimum of 48 hours before beginning testing. The Engineer will verify the straightedge

 testing by observing the QC straightedging operations. Address all deficiencies in excess of
 3/16 inch in accordance with 330-9.5.
 Test and accept areas at the beginning and ending of the project,
 bridge approaches and departures, and areas where the segment is less than 0.01 mile, with the
 straightedge in accordance with 330-9.4.5.5 and 330-9.4.6.1.
 330-9.5 Unacceptable Pavement:
 330-9.5.1 Corrections: Address all areas of unacceptable pavement at no cost to
 the Department. Retest all corrected areas and assure the requirements of these Specifications are
 met.
 330-9.5.1.1 Structural Layers: Correct all deficiencies, as defined in the
 Specifications, in the Type SP structural layers by removing and replacing the full depth of the
 layer, extending a minimum of 50 feet on both sides (where possible) of the defective area for
 the full width of the paving lane.
 As an option, for high straightedge deficiencies only, mill the
 pavement surface the full lane width to a depth and length adequate to remove the deficiency.
 This option only applies if the structural layer is not the final surface layer.
 330-9.5.1.2 Friction Course: Correct deficiencies in the friction course or
 final surface layer by removing and replacing the full depth of the layer, extending a minimum of
 50 feet on both sides (where possible) of the defective area for the full width of the paving lane.
 As an exception, the Engineer may allow the Contractor to leave these areas in place if it is
 determined by the Engineer that the deficiency is not a significant detriment to the pavement
 quality. A reduction to the pay item quantity will be made in accordance with 330-9.5.2.
 330-9.5.2 Reduction in Pay Item Quantity: When the Engineer elects to waive
 corrections, the Department will reduce the pay quantity for the pay item in question by the
 amount of material the Contractor would have removed and replaced had the correction been
 made. When the pay quantity is in tons, the Department will base the reduction on the volume of
 material the Contractor would have removed (the length by the lane width by layer thickness)
 multiplied by the maximum specific gravity of the mix as determined through the following
 equation:
 Quantity (tons) = L x W x t x Gmm x 0.0024
 Where: L = Lane length (ft.)
 W = Lane width (ft.)
 t = Layer thickness (in.)
 Gmm = Maximum specific gravity from verified mix design
 For FC-5 open-graded friction course, the Department will base the reduction on
 the area the Contractor would have removed (the length by lane width) multiplied by a spread
 rate of 80 pounds per square yard as determined through the following equation:
 Quantity (tons) = L x W x 0.0044
 Where: L = Lane length (ft.)
 W = Lane width (ft.)

 330-10 Protection of Finished Surface.
 Keep sections of newly compacted asphalt concrete, which are to be covered by
 additional courses, clean until the successive course is laid.
 Do not dump embankment or base material directly on the pavement. Dress shoulders
 before placing the friction course on adjacent pavement.
 Equip blade graders operating adjacent to the pavement during shoulder construction
 with a 2 inch by 8 inch or larger board, or other attachment providing essentially the same
 results, attached to their blades so it extends below the blade edge and protects the pavement
 surface from damage by the grader blade.
 To prevent rutting or other distortion, protect sections of newly finished dense-graded
 friction course and the last structural layer before friction course from traffic until the surface
 temperature has cooled below 160ºF.
 The Contractor may use artificial methods to cool the pavement to expedite paving
 operations. The Department may direct the Contractor to use artificial cooling methods when
 maintenance of traffic requires opening the pavement to traffic at the earliest possible time.

 Spread rate (lbs/yd2) = t x Gmm x 43.3
 Where: t = Thickness (in.) (plan thickness or individual layer
 Gmm = Maximum specific gravity from the verified mix
 
 The weight of the mixture shall be determined as provided in 320-3.2. For target
 purposes only, spread rate calculations should be rounded to the nearest whole number.
 Note: Plan quantities are based on a Gmm of 2.540, corresponding to a spread rate
 of 110 lbs/yd2-in. Pay quantities will be based on the actual maximum specific gravity of the mix
 being used.
 334-1.4.1 Layer Thicknesses: The allowable layer thicknesses for Type SP
 Asphalt Concrete mixtures are as follows:
 Type SP-9.5................................................. 1 to 1-1/2 inches

 In addition to the minimum and maximum thickness requirements, the
 following restrictions are placed on mixes when used as a structural course:
 Type SP-9.5 - Limited to the top two structural layers, two layers
 maximum.
 Type SP-9.5 – May not be used on Traffic Level D and E
 applications.
 Type SP-19.0 - May not be used in the final (top) structural layer
 below FC-5 mixtures. Type SP-19.0 mixtures are permissible in the layer directly below FC-9.5
 and FC-12.5 mixtures.
 334-1.4.2 Additional Requirements: The following requirements also apply to
 Type SP Asphalt Concrete mixtures:
 1. A minimum 1-1/2 inch initial lift is required over an Asphalt Membrane
 Interlayer (AMI).
 2. When construction includes the paving of adjacent shoulders (less than
 or equal to 5 feet wide), the layer thickness for the upper pavement layer and shoulder must be
 the same and paved in a single pass, unless called for differently in the Contract Documents.
 3. All overbuild layers must be Type SP Asphalt Concrete designed at the
 traffic level as stated in the Contract Documents. Use the minimum and maximum layer
 thicknesses as specified above unless called for differently in the Contract Documents. On
 variable thickness overbuild layers, the minimum and maximum allowable thicknesses will be as
 specified below, unless called for differently in the Contract Documents.
 Type SP-9.5.................................................... 3/8 to 2 inches
 Type SP-12.5.................................................. 1/2 to 3 inches
 Type SP-19.0............................................... 1-1/2 to 4 inches
 4. Variable thickness overbuild layers constructed using a Type SP-9.5 or
 SP-12.5 mixtures may be tapered to zero thickness provided the contract documents require a
 minimum of 1-1/2 inches of dense-graded mix placed over the variable thickness overbuild layer.
 334-2 Materials.
 334-2.1 General Requirements: Meet the material requirements specified in
 Division III. Specific references are as follows:
 Superpave PG Asphalt Binder ............................Section 916
 Coarse Aggregate ................................................Section 901
 Fine Aggregate ....................................................Section 902
 334-2.2 Superpave Asphalt Binder: Unless specified otherwise in the Contract
 Documents, use an asphalt binder grade as determined from Table 334-1.
 334-2.3 Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) Material:
 334-2.3.1 General requirements: RAP may be used as a component of the
 asphalt mixture subject to the following requirements:
 1. When using a PG 76-22 asphalt binder, limit the amount of RAP
 material used in the mix to a maximum of 20% by weight of total aggregate. As an exception,
 amounts greater than 20% RAP by weight of total aggregate can be used if no more than 20% by
 weight of the total asphalt binder comes from the RAP material. RAP is not allowed in mixtures
 containing High Polymer asphalt binder. High Polymer asphalt is defined in Section 916.
 2. Assume full responsibility for the design, production and construction
 of asphalt mixes which incorporate RAP as a component material.

 Department project.
 
 3. Use RAP from a Department approved stockpile or millings from a
 
 4. Provide stockpiled RAP material that is reasonably consistent in
 characteristics and contains no aggregate particles which are soft or conglomerates of fines.
 5. Provide RAP material having a minimum average asphalt binder
 content of 4.0% by weight of RAP. As an exception, when using fractionated RAP, the minimum
 average asphalt binder content for the coarse portion of the RAP shall be 2.5% by weight of the
 coarse portion of the RAP. The coarse portion of the RAP shall be the portion of the RAP
 retained on the No. 4 sieve. The Engineer may sample the stockpiles to verify that this
 requirement is met.
 334-2.3.2 Material Characterization for Mix Design: Assume responsibility for
 establishing the asphalt binder content, gradation, and bulk specific gravity (Gsb) of the RAP
 material based on a representative sampling of the material by roadway cores or stockpile
 samples. For roadway core samples, assume responsibility for the degradation that will occur
 during the milling operation.
 334-2.3.3 RAP Stockpile Approval: Prior to the incorporation of RAP into the
 asphalt mixture, stockpile the RAP material and obtain approval for the stockpile by one of the
 following methods:
 1. Continuous stockpile: When RAP is obtained from one or multiple
 sources and is either processed, blended, or fractionated, and stockpiled in a continuous manner,
 assure an adequate number of test results are obtained for stockpile approval. Test the RAP
 material for gradation and asphalt content at a minimum frequency of one sample per 1000 tons
 with a minimum of six test results. Test the RAP material for Gmm (for Gsb determination) at a
 minimum frequency of one sample per 5000 tons with a minimum of two test results. Based on
 visual inspection and a review of the test data, the Engineer will determine the suitability of the
 stockpiled material. In addition, address the details and specifics of the processing, sampling,
 testing and actions to be taken in the Producer Quality Control (QC) Plan.
 2. Non-continuous single stockpile: When an individual stockpile is being
 constructed, obtain representative samples at random locations and test the RAP material for
 gradation and asphalt content at a minimum frequency of one sample per 1000 tons with a
 minimum of six test results. Test the RAP material for Gmm (for Gsb determination) at a minimum
 frequency of one sample per 5000 tons with a minimum of two test results. Based on visual
 inspection and a review of the test data, the Engineer will determine the suitability of the
 stockpiled material. Once the RAP stockpile has been approved, do not add additional material
 without prior approval of the Engineer.
 Determine the asphalt binder content and gradation of the RAP material in
 accordance with FM 5-563 and FM 1-T 030, respectively. Establish the Gsb of the RAP material
 by using one of the following methods:
 a. Calculate the Gsb value based upon the effective specific gravity
 (Gse) of the RAP material, determined on the basis of the asphalt binder content and maximum
 specific gravity (Gmm) of the RAP material. The Engineer will approve the estimated asphalt
 binder absorption value used in the calculation.
 b. Measure the Gsb of the RAP aggregate, in accordance with
 FM 1-T 084 and FM 1-T 085. Obtain the aggregate by using a solvent extraction method.

 334-2.4 Recycled Crushed Glass: Recycled crushed glass may be used as a component
 of the asphalt mixture subject to the following requirements:
 1. Consider the recycled crushed glass a local material and meet all requirements
 specified in 902-6.
 2. Limit the amount of recycled crushed glass to a maximum of 15% by weight of
 total aggregate.
 3. Use an asphalt binder that contains a minimum of 0.5% anti-stripping agent by
 weight of binder. The anti-strip additive shall be one of the products listed on the Approved
 Product List (APL). The anti-strip additive shall be introduced into the asphalt binder by the
 supplier during loading.
 4. Do not use recycled crushed glass in friction course mixtures or in structural
 course mixtures which are to be used as the final wearing surface.
 334-3 General Composition of Mixture.
 334-3.1 General: Compose the asphalt mixture using a combination of aggregate
 (coarse, fine or mixtures thereof), mineral filler, if required, and asphalt binder material. Size,
 grade and combine the aggregate fractions to meet the grading and physical properties of the mix
 design. Aggregates from various sources may be combined.
 334-3.2 Mix Design:
 334-3.2.1 General: Design the asphalt mixture in accordance with
 AASHTO R 35-12, except as noted herein. Prior to the production of any asphalt mixture, submit
 the proposed mix design with supporting test data indicating compliance with all mix design
 criteria to the Engineer. For Traffic Level B through E mix designs, include representative
 samples of all component materials, including asphalt binder. Allow the Director of the Office of
 Materials a maximum of four weeks to either conditionally verify or reject the mix as designed.
 For a Traffic Level A mixture, meet the mix design criteria for a Traffic
 Level B mixture and for a Traffic Level D mixture meet the mix design criteria for a Traffic
 Level E mixture. In addition, a Type SP mix one traffic level higher than the traffic level

 specified in the Contract Documents may be substituted, at no cost to the Department. Based on
 the previous conditions, the following substitutions are allowed:
 Traffic Level E can be substituted for Traffic Level D.
 Traffic Level D or E can be substituted for Traffic Level C.
 Traffic Level C can be substituted for Traffic Level B.
 Traffic Level B or C can be substituted for Traffic Level A.
 The same traffic level and binder type that is used for the mainline traffic
 lanes may be placed in the shoulder at no additional cost to the Department, even if the
 conditions stated above are not met for the shoulder.
 Do not use more than four mix designs per nominal maximum aggregate
 size per traffic level per binder grade per year, where the year starts at the Notice to Proceed.
 Exceeding this limitation will result in a maximum Composite Pay Factor (CPF) of 1.00 as
 defined in 334-8.2 for all designs used beyond this limit.
 Warm mix technologies (additives, foaming techniques, etc.) listed on the
 Department’s website may be used in the production of the mix. The URL for obtaining this
 information, if available, is: http://www.fdot.gov/materials/mac/production/warmmixasphalt/
 When warm mix technologies are used, for mixtures containing a PG 5228, PG 58-22, or PG 67-22 binder, a mixture will be considered a warm mix asphalt design if the
 mixing temperature is 285°F or less. For mixtures containing a PG 76-22 or High Polymer
 binder, a mixture will be considered a warm mix asphalt design if the mixing temperature is
 305°F or less.
 The Engineer will consider any marked variations from original test data
 for a mix design or any evidence of inadequate field performance of a mix design as sufficient
 evidence that the properties of the mix design have changed, and the Engineer will no longer
 allow the use of the mix design.
 334-3.2.2 Mixture Gradation Requirements: Combine the coarse and fine
 aggregate in proportions that will produce an asphalt mixture meeting all of the requirements
 defined in this specification and conform to the gradation requirements at design as defined in

 334-4 Producer Process Control (PC).
 Assume full responsibility for controlling all operations and processes such that the
 requirements of these Specifications are met at all times. Perform any tests necessary at the plant
 and roadway for process control purposes. Enter all PC test data into the Department’s database.
 The Engineer will not use these test results in the acceptance payment decision.
 Address in the Producer QC Plan how PC failures will be handled. When a PC failure
 occurs, investigate, at a minimum, the production process, testing equipment and/or sampling
 methods to determine the cause of the failure, and make any necessary changes to assure
 compliance with these Specifications. Obtain a follow up sample immediately after corrective
 actions are taken to assess the adequacy of the corrections. In the event the follow-up PC sample
 also fails to meet Specification requirements, cease production of the asphalt mixture until the
 problem is adequately resolved to the satisfaction of the QC Manager.
 334-5 Acceptance of the Mixture.
 334-5.1 General: The mixture will be accepted at the plant with respect to gradation (P-8
 and P-200), asphalt content (Pb), and volumetrics (volumetrics is defined as air voids at Ndesign).
 The mixture will be accepted on the roadway with respect to density of roadway cores.
 Acceptance will be on a LOT by LOT basis (for each mix design) based on tests of random
 samples obtained within each sublot taken at a frequency of one set of samples per sublot. A
 roadway LOT and a plant production LOT shall be the same. Acceptance of the mixture will be
 based on Contractor QC test results that have been verified by the Department.
 334-5.1.1 Sampling and Testing Requirements: Obtain the samples in
 accordance with FM 1-T 168. Obtain samples at the plant of a sufficient quantity to be split into
 three smaller samples; one for QC, one for Verification testing and one for Resolution testing;
 each sample at approximately 35 pounds. The split samples for Verification testing and
 Resolution testing shall be reduced in size and stored in three boxes each. The approximate size
 of each box must be 12 inches x 8 inches x 4 inches. Provide, label and safely store sample boxes
 in a manner agreed upon by the Engineer for future testing.
 The asphalt content of the mixture will be determined in accordance with
 FM 5-563. The gradation of the recovered aggregate will be determined in accordance with
 FM 1-T 030. Volumetric testing will be in accordance with AASHTO T 312-12and FM 1-T 209.
 Prior to testing volumetric samples, condition the test-sized sample for one hour, plus or minus
 five minutes, at the target roadway compaction temperature in a shallow, flat pan, such that the
 mixture temperature at the end of the one hour conditioning period is within plus or minus 20°F
 of the roadway compaction temperature. Test for roadway density in accordance with
 FM 1-T 166.
 334-5.1.2 Acceptance Testing Exceptions: When the total combined quantity of
 hot mix asphalt for the project, as indicated in the Plans for Type SP and Type FC mixtures only,
 is less than 2000 tons, the Engineer will accept the mix on the basis of visual inspection. The
 Engineer may require the Contractor to run process control tests for informational purposes, as
 defined in 334-4, or may run independent verification tests to determine the acceptability of the
 material.
 Density testing for acceptance will not be performed on widening strips or
 shoulders with a width of 5 feet or less, open-graded friction courses, variable thickness
 overbuild courses, leveling courses, any asphalt layer placed on subgrade (regardless of type),
 miscellaneous asphalt pavement, shared use paths, crossovers, gore areas, or any course with a
 specified thickness less than 1 inch or a specified spread rate that converts to less than 1 inch as
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 288
 
 described in 334-1.4. Density testing for acceptance will not be performed on asphalt courses
 placed on bridge decks or approach slabs; compact these courses in static mode only per the
 requirements of 330-7.7. In addition, density testing for acceptance will not be performed on the
 following areas when they are less than 500 feet (continuous) in length: turning lanes,
 acceleration lanes, deceleration lanes, shoulders, parallel parking lanes or ramps. Do not perform
 density testing for acceptance in situations where the areas requiring density testing is less than
 50 tons within a sublot.
 Density testing for acceptance will not be performed in intersections. The
 limits of the intersection will be from stop bar to stop bar for both the mainline and side streets.
 A random core location that occurs within the intersection shall be moved forward or backward
 from the intersection at the direction of the Engineer.
 Where density testing for acceptance is not required, compact these
 courses (with the exception of open-graded friction courses) in accordance with the rolling
 procedure (equipment and pattern) as approved by the Engineer or with Standard Rolling
 Procedure as specified in 330-7.2. In the event that the rolling procedure deviates from the
 procedure approved by the Engineer, or the Standard Rolling Procedure, placement of the mix
 shall be stopped.
 The density pay factor (as defined in 334-8.2) for areas not requiring
 density testing for acceptance will be paid at the same density pay factor as for the areas
 requiring density testing within the same LOT. If the entire LOT does not require density testing
 for acceptance, the LOT will be paid at a density pay factor of 1.00.
 334-5.2 Full LOTs: Each LOT will be defined (as selected by the Contractor prior to the
 start of the LOT) as either (1) 2,000 tons, with each LOT subdivided into four equal sublots of
 500 tons each, or (2) 4,000 tons, with each LOT subdivided into four equal sublots of 1,000 tons
 each. As an exception to this, the initial LOT of all new mix designs shall be defined as
 2,000 tons, subdivided into four equal sublots of 500 tons each. Before the beginning of a LOT,
 the Engineer will develop a random sampling plan for each sublot and direct the Contractor on
 sample points, based on tonnage, for each sublot during construction.
 334-5.3 Partial LOTs: A partial LOT is defined as a LOT size that is less than a full
 LOT. A partial LOT may occur due to the following:
 l. The completion of a given mix type or mix design on a project.
 2. Closure of the LOT due to time. LOTs will be closed 30 calendar days
 after the start of the LOT. Time periods other than 30 calendar days may be used if agreed to by
 both the Engineer and the Contractor, but under no circumstances shall the LOT be left open
 longer than 60 days.
 3. A LOT is terminated per 334-5.4.4.
 All partial LOTs will be evaluated based on the number of tests available, and
 will not be redefined. If a LOT is closed before the first plant random sample is obtained, then
 the LOT will be visually accepted by the Engineer and the LOT pay factor will be 1.00.
 334-5.4 QC Sampling and Testing: Obtain all samples randomly as directed by the
 Engineer.
 Should the Engineer determine that the QC requirements are not being met or that
 unsatisfactory results are being obtained, or should any instances of falsification of test data
 occur, acceptance of the Producer’s QC Plan will be suspended and production will be stopped.
 334-5.4.1 Lost or Missing Verification/Resolution Samples: In the event that
 any of the Verification and/or Resolution asphalt mixture samples that are in the custody of the
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 289
 
 Contractor are lost, damaged, destroyed, or are otherwise unavailable for testing, the minimum
 possible pay factor for each quality characteristic as described in 334-8.2 will be applied to the
 entire LOT in question, unless called for otherwise by the Engineer. Specifically, if the LOT in
 question has more than two sublots, the pay factor for each quality characteristic will be 0.55. If
 the LOT has two or less sublots, the pay factor for each quality characteristic will be 0.80. If only
 the roadway cores are lost, damaged, destroyed, or are otherwise unavailable for testing, then the
 minimum possible pay factor for density will be applied to the entire LOT in question. In either
 event, the material in question will also be evaluated in accordance with 334-5.9.5.
 If any of the Verification and/or Resolution samples that are in the custody
 of the Department are lost, damaged, destroyed or are otherwise unavailable for testing, the
 corresponding QC test result will be considered verified, and payment will be based upon the
 Contractor’s data.
 334-5.4.2 Plant Sampling and Testing Requirements: Obtain one random
 sample of mix per sublot in accordance with 334-5.1.1 as directed by the Engineer. Test the QC
 split sample for gradation, asphalt binder content and volumetrics in accordance with 334-5.1.1.
 Complete all QC testing within one working day from the time the samples were obtained.
 334-5.4.3 Roadway Sampling and Testing Requirements: Obtain five 6 inch
 diameter roadway cores within 24 hours of placement at random locations as directed by the
 Engineer within each sublot. Test these QC samples for density (Gmb) in accordance with
 334-5.1.1. Obtain a minimum of three cores per sublot at random locations as identified by the
 Engineer in situations where the sublot/LOT was closed or terminated before the random
 numbers were reached or where it is impractical to cut five cores per sublot. Do not obtain cores
 any closer than 12 inches from an unsupported edge. The Engineer may adjust randomly
 generated core locations for safety purposes or as the Engineer deems necessary. Do not perform
 density testing for acceptance in a sublot if the plant random sample for that sublot has not been
 obtained. Maintain traffic during the coring operation; core the roadway, patch the core holes
 (within three days of coring); and trim the cores to the proper thickness prior to density testing.
 Density for the sublot shall be based on the average value for the cores cut
 from the sublot with the target density being a percentage of the maximum specific gravity (Gmm)
 of the sublot, as defined in the Contract. Once the average density of a sublot has been
 determined, do not retest the samples unless approved by the Engineer. Ensure proper handling
 and storage of all cores until the LOT in question has been accepted.
 334-5.4.4 Individual Test Tolerances for QC Testing: Terminate the LOT if
 any of the following QC failures occur:
 1. An individual test result of a sublot for air voids does not meet
 the requirements of Table 334-4,
 2. The average sublot density does not meet the requirements of
 Table 334-4,
 3. Two consecutive test results within the same LOT for gradation
 or asphalt binder content do not meet the requirements of Table 334-4,
 When a LOT is terminated due to a QC failure, stop production of the
 mixture until the problem is resolved to the satisfaction of the QC Manager and/or Asphalt Plant
 Level II technician responsible for the decision to resume production after a QC failure, as
 identified in Section 105. In the event that it can be demonstrated that the problem can
 immediately be or already has been resolved, it will not be necessary to stop production. When a
 LOT is terminated, make all necessary changes to correct the problem. Do not resume production
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 290
 
 until appropriate corrections have been made. Prior to resuming production, inform the Engineer
 of the problem and corrections made to correct the problem. After resuming production, sample
 and test the material to verify that the changes have corrected the problem. Summarize this
 information and provide it to the Engineer prior to the end of the work shift when production
 resumes.
 In the event that a QC failure is not addressed as defined above, the
 Engineer’s approval will be required prior to resuming production after any future QC failures.
 Address any material represented by a failing test result, as defined above
 in this subarticle, in accordance with 334-5.9.5. Any LOT terminated under this subarticle will
 be limited to a maximum Pay Factor of 1.00 (as defined in 334-8.2) for all quality characteristics
 and will include all material placed up to the point when the LOT was terminated.
 In the event that a Gmm test result differs by more than 0.040 from the mix
 design Gmm, investigate the causes of the discrepancy and report the findings and proposed
 actions to the Engineer.

 334-5.5 Verification Testing: In order to determine the validity of the Contractor’s QC
 test results prior to their use in the Acceptance decision, the Engineer will run verification tests.
 334-5.5.1 Plant Testing: At the completion of each LOT, the Engineer will test a
 minimum of one Verification split sample randomly selected from the LOT. Results of the
 testing and analysis for the LOT will be made available to the Contractor within one working day
 from the time the LOT is completed. Verification samples shall be reheated at the target roadway
 compaction temperature for 1-1/2 hours, plus or minus 5 minutes, reduced to the appropriate
 testing size, and conditioned and tested as described in 334-5.1.1. In lieu of the 1-1/2 hours
 reheating procedure, the mixture may be reheated to within plus or minus 20°F of the roadway
 compaction temperature using a microwave oven. Stir the mixture as necessary during the
 reheating process to maintain temperature uniformity. Subsequently, condition and test the
 mixture as described in 334-5.1.1.
 The Verification test results will be compared with the QC test results
 based on the between-laboratory precision values shown in Table 334-5.

 If all of the specified mix characteristics compare favorably, then the LOT
 will be accepted, with payment based on the Contractor’s QC test data for the LOT.
 If any of the results do not compare favorably, then the Resolution
 samples from the LOT will be sent to the Resolution laboratory for testing, as described in 3345.6.
 334-5.5.2 Roadway Testing: At the completion of each LOT, the Engineer will
 determine the density (Gmb) of each core (previously tested by QC) as described in 334-5.1.1
 from the same sublot as the plant samples. For situations where roadway density is not required
 for the random sublot chosen, then another sublot shall be randomly chosen for roadway density
 cores only. Results of the testing and analysis for the LOT will be made available to the
 Contractor within one working day from the time the LOT is completed.
 The individual Verification test results will be compared with individual
 QC test results by the Engineer based on the between-laboratory precision values given in
 Table 334-5.
 If each of the core test results compare favorably, then the LOT will be
 accepted with respect to density, with payment based on the Contractor’s QC test data for the
 LOT.
 If any of the results do not compare favorably, then the core samples from
 the LOT will be sent to the Resolution laboratory for testing as specified in 334-5.6.
 334-5.6 Resolution System:
 334-5.6.1 Plant Samples: In the event of an unfavorable comparison between the
 Contractor’s QC test results and the Engineer’s Verification test results on any of the properties
 identified in Table 334-5, the Resolution laboratory will test all of the split samples from the
 LOT for only the property (or properties) in question. Resolution samples shall be reheated at the
 target roadway compaction temperature for 1-1/2 hours, plus or minus 5 minutes, reduced to the
 appropriate testing size, and conditioned and tested as described in 334-5.1.1. In lieu of the 11/2 hours reheating procedure, the mixture may be reheated to within plus or minus 20°F of the
 roadway compaction temperature using a microwave oven. Stir the mixture as necessary during
 the reheating process to maintain temperature uniformity. Subsequently, condition and test the
 mixture as described in 334-5.1.1.
 334-5.6.2 Roadway Samples: In the event of an unfavorable comparison between
 the Contractor’s QC test data and the Engineer’s Verification test data on the density results, the
 Resolution laboratory will test all of the cores from the LOT. Testing will be as described in 3345.1.1.
 334-5.6.3 Resolution Determination: The Resolution test results (for the
 property or properties in question) will be compared with the QC test results based on the
 between-laboratory precision values shown in Table 334-5.
 If the Resolution test results compare favorably with all of the QC results,
 then acceptance and payment for the LOT will be based on the QC results, and the Department
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 292
 
 will bear the costs associated with Resolution testing. No additional compensation, either
 monetary or time, will be made for the impacts of any such testing.
 If the Resolution test results do not compare favorably with all of the QC
 results, then acceptance and payment for the LOT will be based on the Resolution test data for
 the LOT, and the costs of the Resolution testing will be deducted from monthly estimates. No
 additional time will be granted for the impacts of any such testing.
 In addition, the material failure requirements of 334-5.4.4 apply to the
 Resolution test data. Address any material represented by the failing test results in accordance
 with 334-5.9.5. For this situation, the LOT will be limited to a maximum Pay Factor of 1.00 (as
 defined in 334-8.2) for all quality characteristics.
 In the event of an unfavorable comparison between the Resolution test
 results and QC test results, make the necessary adjustments to assure that future comparisons are
 favorable.
 334-5.7 Independent Verification (IV) Testing:
 334-5.7.1 Plant: The Contractor shall provide sample boxes and take samples as
 directed by the Engineer for IV testing. Obtain enough material for three complete sets of tests
 (two samples for IV testing by the Engineer and one sample for testing by the Contractor). If
 agreed upon by both the Engineer and the Contractor, only one sample for IV testing by the
 Engineer may be obtained. IV samples will be reheated at the target roadway compaction
 temperature for 1-1/2 hours, plus or minus 5 minutes, reduced to the appropriate testing size, and
 conditioned and tested as described in 334-5.1.1. The Contractor’s split sample, if tested
 immediately after sampling, shall be reduced to the appropriate testing size, and conditioned and
 tested as described in 334-5.1.1. If the Contractor’s sample is not tested immediately after
 sampling, then the sample shall be reheated at the target roadway compaction temperature for 11/2 hours, plus or minus 5 minutes, reduced to the appropriate testing size, and conditioned and
 tested as described in 334-5.1.1. For the IV and Contractor's samples, in lieu of the 1-1/2 hours
 reheating procedure, the mixture may be reheated to within plus or minus 20°F of the roadway
 compaction temperature using a microwave oven. Stir the mixture as necessary during the
 reheating process to maintain temperature uniformity. Subsequently, condition and test the
 mixture as described in 334-5.1.1. The Contractor’s test results shall be provided to the Engineer
 within one working day from the time the sample was obtained.
 If any of the IV test results do not meet the requirements of Table 334-4,
 then a comparison of the IV test results and the Contractor’s test results, if available, will be
 made. If a comparison of the IV test results and the Contractor’s test results meets the precision
 values of Table 334-5 for the material properties in question, or if the Contractor’s test results are
 not available, then the IV test results are considered verified and the Contractor shall cease
 production of the asphalt mixture until the problem is adequately resolved (to the satisfaction of
 the Engineer), unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Engineer that the problem
 can immediately be (or already has been) resolved. Address any material represented by the
 failing test results in accordance with 334-5.9.5.
 If a comparison of the IV test results and the Contractor’s test results does
 not meet the precision values of Table 334-5 for the material properties in question, then the
 second IV sample shall be tested by the Engineer for the material properties in question. If a
 comparison between the first and second IV test results does not meet the precision values of
 Table 334-5 for the material properties in question, then the first IV test results are considered
 unverified for the material properties in question and no action shall be taken.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 293
 
 If a comparison between the first and second IV test results meets the
 precision values of Table 334-5 for the material properties in question, then the first IV sample is
 considered verified and the Contractor shall cease production of the asphalt mixture until the
 problem is adequately resolved (to the satisfaction of the Engineer), unless it can be
 demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Engineer that the problem can immediately be (or already
 has been) resolved. Address any material represented by the failing test results in accordance
 with 334-5.9.5.
 The Engineer has the option to use the IV sample for comparison testing
 as specified in 334-6.
 334-5.7.2 Roadway: Obtain five 6 inch diameter roadway cores within 24 hours
 of placement, as directed by the Engineer, for IV testing. In situations where it is impractical to
 cut five cores per sublot, obtain a minimum of three cores per sublot at random locations, as
 identified by the Engineer. These independent cores will be obtained from the same LOTs and
 sublots as the Independent Verification Plant samples, or as directed by the Engineer. The
 density of these cores will be obtained as described in 334-5.1.1. If the average of the results for
 the sublot does not meet the requirements of Table 334-4 for density, then a comparison of the
 IV Gmm test results and the Contractor’s Gmm test results, if available, will be made in
 accordance with the procedure provided in 334-5.7.1. Address any material represented by the
 failing test results in accordance with 334-5.9.5.
 334-5.8 Surface Tolerance: The asphalt mixture will be accepted on the roadway with
 respect to surface tolerance in accordance with the applicable requirements of 330-9.
 334-5.9 Minimum Acceptable Quality Levels:
 334-5.9.1 PFs Below 0.90: In the event that an individual pay factor for any
 quality characteristic of a LOT falls below 0.90, take steps to correct the situation and report the
 actions to the Engineer. In the event that the pay factor for the same quality characteristic for two
 consecutive LOTs is below 0.90, cease production of the asphalt mixture until the problem is
 adequately resolved (to the satisfaction of the Engineer), unless it can be demonstrated to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer that the problem can immediately be (or already has been) resolved.
 Actions taken must be approved by the Engineer before production resumes.
 334-5.9.2 CPFs Less Than 0.90 and Greater Than or Equal to 0.80: If the
 composite pay factor for the LOT is less than 0.90 and greater than or equal to 0.80, cease
 production of the asphalt mixture until the problem is adequately resolved (to the satisfaction of
 the Engineer), unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Engineer that the problem
 can immediately be (or already has been) resolved. Actions taken must be approved by the
 Engineer before production resumes.
 334-5.9.3 CPFs Less Than 0.80 and Greater Than or Equal to 0.75: If the CPF
 for the LOT is less than 0.80 and greater than or equal to 0.75, address the defective material in
 accordance with 334-5.9.5.
 334-5.9.4 CPFs Less Than 0.75: If the CPF for the LOT is less than 0.75,
 remove and replace the defective LOT at no cost to the Department, or as approved by the
 Engineer.
 334-5.9.5 Defective Material: Assume responsibility for removing and replacing
 all defective material placed on the project, at no cost to the Department.
 As an exception to the above and upon approval of the Engineer, obtain an
 engineering analysis in accordance with Section 6 by an independent laboratory (as approved by

 the Engineer) to determine the disposition of the material. The engineering analysis must be
 signed and sealed by a Professional Engineer licensed in the State of Florida.
 The Engineer may determine that an engineering analysis is not necessary
 or may perform an engineering analysis to determine the disposition of the material.
 Any material that remains in place will be accepted with a CPF as
 determined by 334-8, or as determined by the Engineer.
 If the defective material is due to a gradation, asphalt binder content or
 density failure, upon the approval of the Engineer the Contractor may perform delineation tests
 on roadway cores in lieu of an engineering analysis to determine the limits of the defective
 material that may require removal and replacement. Prior to any delineation testing, all sampling
 locations shall be approved by the Engineer. All delineation sampling and testing shall be
 monitored and verified by the Engineer. For materials that are defective due to air voids, an
 engineering analysis is required.
 When evaluating defective material by engineering analysis or delineation
 testing, at a minimum, evaluate all material located between passing QC, PC or IV test results.
 Exceptions to this requirement shall be approved by the Engineer.
 334-6 Comparison Testing.
 At the start of the project (unless waived by the Engineer) and at other times as
 determined necessary by the Engineer, provide split samples for comparison testing with the
 Engineer. The purpose of these tests is to verify that the testing equipment is functioning
 properly and that the testing procedures are being performed correctly. In the event that the
 Engineer determines that there is a problem with the Contractor’s testing equipment and/or
 testing procedures, immediately correct the problem to the Engineer’s satisfaction. In the event
 that the problem is not immediately corrected, cease production of the asphalt mixture until the
 problem is adequately resolved to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 If so agreed to by both the Contractor and the Engineer, the split sample used for
 comparison testing may also be used for the QC sample. The split sample used for comparison
 testing must also meet the requirements for IV testing described in 334-5.7.
 334-7 Method of Measurement.
 For the work specified under this Section (including the pertinent provisions of
 Sections 320 and 330), the quantity to be paid for will be the weight of the mixture, in tons. For
 each pay item, excluding overbuild, the pay quantity will be based on the quantity placed on the
 project, limited to 105% of the adjusted plan quantity for the pay item. The adjusted plan
 quantity will be determined by dividing the pay item’s original plan quantity (including any
 Engineer approved quantity revisions) by the design Gmm stated in 334-1.4, then multiplying it
 by the tonnage-weighted average Gmm of the mixes used for the pay item.
 The bid price for the asphalt mix will include the cost of the liquid asphalt and the tack
 coat application as directed in 300-8. There will be no separate payment or unit price adjustment
 for the asphalt binder material in the asphalt mix. For the calculation of unit price adjustments of
 bituminous material, the average asphalt content will be based on the percentage specified in 92.1.2. The weight will be determined as provided in 320-3.2 (including the provisions for the
 automatic recordation system).
 Prepare and submit a Certification of Quantities to the Engineer in accordance with 92.1.2.

 334-8 Basis of Payment.
 334-8.1 General: Price and payment will be full compensation for all the work specified
 under this Section (including the applicable requirements of Sections 320 and 330).
 For materials accepted in accordance with 334-5, based upon the quality of the material, a
 pay adjustment will be applied to the bid price of the material as determined on a LOT by LOT
 basis. The pay adjustment will be assessed by calculating a Pay Factor for the following
 individual quality characteristics: pavement density, air voids, asphalt binder content, and the
 percentage passing the No. 200 and No. 8 sieves. The pay adjustment will be computed by
 multiplying a Composite Pay Factor (CPF) for the LOT by the bid price per ton.
 334-8.2 Pay Factors:
 334-8.2.1 Partial LOTs: For Partial LOTs where no random sample is obtained
 due to insufficient tonnage, a CPF of 1.00 shall be applied.
 334-8.2.2 Two or Less Sublot Test Results: In the event that two or less sublot
 test results are available for a LOT, Pay Factors will be determined based on Table 334-6, using
 the average of the accumulated deviations from the target value. (Deviations are absolute values
 with no plus or minus signs.) Use the 1-Test column when there is only one sublot test result and
 use the 2-Tests column when there are two sublots.

 (1). Each density test result is the average of five cores. The target density is 93.00 percent of Gmm (92.00 percent when
 compaction is limited to the static mode or for layers specified to be one inch thick). When compaction is limited to the static
 mode, no vibratory mode in the vertical direction will be allowed. Other vibratory modes will be allowed, if approved by the
 Engineer. In this case, the target density is 92.00 percent of Gmm.
 
 334-8.2.3 Three or More Sublot Test Results: When three or more sublot test
 results are available for a LOT, the variability-unknown, standard deviation method will be used
 to determine the estimated percentage of the LOT that is within the specification limits. The
 number of significant figures used in the calculations will be in accordance with requirements of
 AASHTO R11-06, Absolute Method.
 334-8.2.3.1 Percent Within Limits: The percent within limits (PWL) and
 Pay Factors for the LOT will be calculated as described below. Variables used in the calculations

 following equation:
 
 334-8.2.3.2 Pay Factors (PF): Pay Factors will be calculated by using the
 
 Pay Factor = (55 + 0.5 x PWL) / 100
 The PWL is determined from Step (8) of 334-8.2.3.1.
 334-8.3 Composite Pay Factor (CPF): A CPF for the LOT will be calculated based on
 the individual PFs with the following weighting applied: 35% Density (D), 25% Air Voids (Va),
 25% asphalt binder content (Pb), 10% Passing No. 200 (P-200) and 5% Passing No. 8 (P-8).
 Calculate the CPF by using the following formula:
 CPF = [(0.350 x PF D) + (0.250 x PF Va) + (0.250 x PF Pb) +
 (0.100 x PF P-200) + (0.050 x PF P-8)]
 Where the PF for each quality characteristic is determined in either 334-8.2.2 or
 334-8.2.3, depending on the number of sublot tests. Note that the number after each
 multiplication will be rounded to the nearest 0.01.
 The pay adjustment shall be computed by multiplying the CPF for the LOT by the
 bid price per ton.

 337-7 Special Construction Requirements.
 337-7.1 Hot Storage of FC-5 Mixtures: When using surge or storage bins in the normal
 production of FC-5, do not leave the mixture in the surge or storage bin for more than one hour.
 337-7.2 Longitudinal Grade Controls for Open-Graded Friction Courses: On FC-5,
 use either longitudinal grade control (skid, ski or traveling stringline) or a joint matcher.
 337-7.3 Temperature Requirements for FC-5:
 337-7.3.1 Air Temperature at Laydown: Meet the requirements of Table 330-1.
 337-7.3.2 Temperature of the Mix: Heat and combine the asphalt binder and
 aggregate in a manner to produce a mix having a temperature, when discharged from the plant,
 meeting the requirements of 320-6.3. Meet all requirements of 330-6.1.3 at the roadway. The
 target mixing temperature shall be established by the Contractor. The target mixing temperature
 may be reduced when using warm mix technology.
 337-7.4 Compaction of FC-5: Provide two, static steel-wheeled rollers, with an effective
 compactive weight in the range of 135 to 200 pounds per linear inch (PLI), determined as
 follows:
 PLI =
 
 Total Weight of Roller (pounds)
 Total Width of Drums (inches)
 
 (Any variation of this equipment requirement must be approved by the Engineer.) Establish an
 appropriate rolling pattern for the pavement in order to effectively seat the mixture without
 crushing the aggregate. In the event that the roller begins to crush the aggregate, reduce the
 number of coverages or the PLI of the rollers. If the rollers continue to crush the aggregate, use a
 tandem steel-wheel roller weighing not more than 135 PLI of drum width.
 337-7.5 Temperature Requirements for FC-9.5 and FC-12.5:
 337-7.5.1 Air Temperature at Laydown: Meet the requirements of Table 330-1.
 337-7.5.2 Temperature of the Mix: Heat and combine the asphalt binder and
 aggregate in a manner to produce a mix having a temperature, when discharged from the plant,
 meeting the requirements of 320-6.3. Meet all requirements of 330-6.1.3 at the roadway.
 337-7.6 Prevention of Adhesion: To minimize adhesion to the drum during the rolling
 operations, the Contractor may add a small amount of liquid detergent to the water in the roller.
 At intersections and in other areas where the pavement may be subjected to crosstraffic before it has cooled, spray the approaches with water to wet the tires of the approaching
 vehicles before they cross the pavement.
 337-7.7 Transportation Requirements of Friction Course Mixtures: Cover all loads
 of friction course mixtures with a tarpaulin, or waterproof cover, meeting requirements of 320-7.
 337-8 Thickness of Friction Courses.
 337-8.1 FC-9.5 and FC-12.5: The thickness of the friction course layer will be the plan
 thickness as shown in the Contract Documents. For construction purposes, the plan thickness
 will be converted to spread rate as defined in 334-1.4.
 Plan quantities are based on a G mm of 2.540, corresponding to a spread rate of
 2
 110 lbs/yd -in. Pay quantities will be based on the actual maximum specific gravity of the mix
 being used.
 337-8.2 FC-5: The total thickness of the FC-5 layer will be the plan thickness as shown
 in the Contract Documents. For construction purposes, the plan thickness will be converted to

 spread rate based on the combined aggregate bulk specific gravity of the asphalt mix being used
 as shown in the following equation:
 Spread rate (lbs/yd2) = t x G sb x 40.5
 
 mix design
 
 Where: t = Thickness (in.) (Plan thickness)
 G sb = Combined aggregate bulk specific gravity from the verified
 
 The weight of the mixture shall be determined as provided in 320-3.2.
 Plan quantities are based on a G sb of 2.635, corresponding to a spread rate of
 80 pounds per square yard for a 3/4 inch layer. Pay quantities will be based on the actual
 combined aggregate bulk specific gravity (G sb ) of the mix being used.
 337-9 Special Equipment Requirements for FC-5.
 337-9.1 Fiber Supply System: Use a separate feed system to accurately proportion the
 required quantity of mineral fibers into the mixture in such a manner that uniform distribution is
 obtained. Interlock the proportioning device with the aggregate feed or weigh system to maintain
 the correct proportions for all rates of production and batch sizes. Control the proportion of fibers
 to within plus or minus 10% of the amount of fibers required. Provide flow indicators or sensing
 devices for the fiber system, interlocked with plant controls so that the mixture production will
 be interrupted if introduction of the fiber fails.
 When a batch plant is used, add the fiber to the aggregate in the weigh hopper or
 as approved and directed by the Engineer. Increase the batch dry mixing time by 8 to 12 seconds,
 or as directed by the Engineer, from the time the aggregate is completely emptied into the
 pugmill. Ensure that the fibers are uniformly distributed prior to the addition of asphalt rubber
 into the pugmill.
 When a drum-mix plant is used, add and uniformly disperse the fiber with the
 aggregate prior to the addition of the asphalt rubber. Add the fiber in such a manner that it will
 not become entrained in the exhaust system of the drier or plant.
 337-9.2 Hydrated Lime Supply System: For FC-5 mixes containing granite, use a
 separate feed system to accurately proportion the required quantity of hydrated lime into the
 mixture in such a manner that uniform coating of the aggregate is obtained prior to the addition
 of the asphalt rubber. Add the hydrated lime in such a manner that it will not become entrained
 in the exhaust system of the drier or plant. Interlock the proportioning device with the aggregate
 feed or weigh system to maintain the correct proportions for all rates of production and batch
 sizes and to ensure that all mixture produced is properly treated with hydrated lime. Control the
 proportion of hydrated lime to within plus or minus 10% of the amount of hydrated lime
 required. Provide and interlock flow indicators or sensing devices for the hydrated lime system
 with plant controls so that the mixture production will be interrupted if introduction of the
 hydrated lime fails. The addition of the hydrated lime to the aggregate may be accomplished by
 Method A or B as follows:
 337-9.2.1 Method A - Dry Form: Add hydrated lime in a dry form to the mixture
 according to the type of asphalt plant being used.
 When a batch plant is used, add the hydrated lime to the aggregate in the
 weigh hopper or as approved and directed by the Engineer. Increase the batch dry mixing time
 by eight to twelve seconds, or as directed by the Engineer, from the time the aggregate is
 completely emptied into the pugmill. Uniformly distribute the hydrated lime prior to the addition

 306
 
 of asphalt rubber into the pugmill.
 When a drum-mix plant is used, add and uniformly disperse the hydrated
 lime to the aggregate prior to the addition of the asphalt rubber. Add the hydrated lime in such a
 manner that it will not become entrained in the exhaust system of the drier or plant.
 337-9.2.2 Method B - Hydrated Lime/Water Slurry: Add the required quantity
 of hydrated lime (based on dry weight) in a hydrated lime/water slurry form to the aggregate.
 Provide a solution consisting of hydrated lime and water in concentrations as directed by the
 Engineer. Use a plant equipped to blend and maintain the hydrated lime in suspension and to mix
 it with the aggregates uniformly in the proportions specified.
 337-9.3 Hydrated Lime Pretreatment: For FC-5 mixes containing granite, as an
 alternative to 337-9.2, pretreat the aggregate with hydrated lime prior to incorporating the
 aggregate into the mixture. Use a feed system to accurately proportion the aggregate and
 required quantity of hydrated lime, and mix them in such a manner that uniform coating of the
 aggregate is obtained. Control the proportion of hydrated lime to within plus or minus 10% of
 the amount required. Aggregate pretreated with hydrated lime in this manner shall be
 incorporated into the asphalt mixture within 45 days of pretreatment.
 337-9.3.1 Hydrated Lime Pretreatment Methods: Pretreat the aggregate using
 one of the following two methods:
 Pretreatment Method A - Dry Form: Add the required quantity of hydrated
 lime in a dry form to the aggregate. Assure that the aggregate at the time of pretreatment contains
 a minimum of 3% moisture over saturated surface dry (SSD) conditions. Utilize equipment to
 accurately proportion the aggregate and hydrated lime and mix them in such a manner as to
 provide a uniform coating.
 Pretreatment Method B - Hydrated Lime/Water Slurry: Add the required
 quantity of hydrated lime (based on dry weight) in a hydrated lime/water slurry form to the
 aggregate. Provide a solution consisting of hydrated lime and water in a concentration to provide
 effective treatment. Use equipment to blend and maintain the hydrated lime in suspension, to
 accurately proportion the aggregate and hydrated lime/water slurry, and to mix them to provide a
 uniform coating.
 337-9.3.2 Blending QC Records: Maintain adequate QC records for the
 Engineer’s review for all pretreatment activities. Include as a minimum the following
 information (for each batch or day’s run of pretreatment): pretreatment date, aggregate
 certification information, certified test results for the hydrated lime, aggregate moisture content
 prior to blending, as-blended quantities of aggregate and hydrated lime, project number,
 customer name, and shipping date.
 337-9.3.3 Certification: In addition to the aggregate certification, provide a
 certification with each load of material delivered to the hot mix asphalt plant, that the material
 has been pretreated in conformance with these specifications. Include also the date the material
 was pretreated.
 337-10 Failing Material.
 Meet the requirements of 334-5.9. For FC-5, use the Master Production Range defined in
 Table 337-2 in lieu of Table 334-4.
 337-11 Method of Measurement.
 For the work specified under this Section (including the pertinent provisions of
 Sections 320 and 330), the quantity to be paid for will be the weight of the mixture, in tons. For
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 307
 
 each pay item, the pay quantity will be based on the quantity placed on the project, limited to
 105% of the adjusted plan quantity for the pay item. For dense-graded mixes, the adjusted plan
 quantity will be determined by dividing the pay item’s original plan quantity (including any
 Engineer approved quantity revisions) by the design G mm stated in 334-1.4, then multiplying it
 by the tonnage-weighted average G mm of the mixes used for the pay item. For open graded
 mixes, the adjusted plan quantity will be determined by dividing the pay item’s original plan
 quantity (including any Engineer approved quantity revisions) by the design G sb stated in 3378.2, then multiplying it by the tonnage-weighted average G sb of the mixes used for the pay item.
 The bid price for the asphalt mix will include the cost of the asphalt binder (asphalt
 rubber (or polymer), asphalt cement, ground tire rubber, anti-stripping agent, blending and
 handling) and the tack coat application as directed in 300-8, as well as fiber stabilizing additive
 and hydrated lime (if required). There will be no separate payment or unit price adjustment for
 the asphalt binder material in the asphalt mix. The weight will be determined as provided in 3203.2 (including the provisions for the automatic recordation system).
 Prepare and submit a Certification of Quantities to the Engineer in accordance with 92.1.2.
 337-12 Basis of Payment.
 337-12.1 General: Price and payment will be full compensation for all the work
 specified under this Section (including the applicable requirements of Sections 320 and 330).
 Based upon the quality of the material, a pay adjustment will be applied to the bid
 price of the material as determined on a LOT by LOT basis. The pay adjustment will be assessed
 by calculating a Pay Factor for individual quality characteristics. The pay adjustment will be
 computed by multiplying a Composite Pay Factor for the LOT by the bid price per ton.
 337-12.2 FC-9.5 and FC-12.5: Meet the requirements of 334-8.
 337-12.3 FC-5: Meet the requirements of 334-8 with the following exceptions:

 Construct Value Added Asphalt Pavement consisting of Asphalt Concrete Structural
 Course and Asphalt Concrete Friction Course, subject to a three year warranty period after final
 acceptance of the Contract in accordance with 5-11.
 For purposes of this Specification, the Responsible Party, as designated herein, is
 responsible for performance of the Value Added Asphalt Pavement including continued
 responsibility for performing all remedial work associated with pavement distresses exceeding
 threshold values determined in accordance with this Section, and as to which notice was
 provided to the Responsible Party.
 The work specified in this Section will not be paid for directly, but will be considered as
 incidental to other Contract items.
 338-2 Materials and Construction Requirements.
 Meet the following requirements:
 Hot Bituminous Mixtures - Plant, Methods and
 Equipment ...........................................................Section 320
 Hot Bituminous Mixtures - General Construction
 Requirements ......................................................Section 330
 Superpave Asphalt Concrete ...............................Section 334
 Asphalt Concrete Friction Courses.......................Section 337
 338-3 Responsible Party.
 Prior to any Value Added Asphalt Pavement being placed on the project, the Contractor
 shall designate a Responsible Party to accept responsibility for maintaining the Value Added
 Asphalt Pavement, when remedial work is required. When the scope of the asphalt work is only
 milling and resurfacing, and there is no construction of the embankment, subgrade or base below
 the pavement included in the Contract, the Responsible Party may be either the Contractor or the
 Department approved subcontractor performing the Value Added Asphalt Pavement work. When
 the construction of the embankment, subgrade or base below the pavement is included in the
 Contract, in addition to the construction of the Asphalt Concrete Structural Course and Asphalt
 Concrete Friction Course, the Contractor shall be considered as the Responsible Party.
 When the Responsible Party is a subcontractor, the subcontractor must be pre-qualified
 with the Department in the category of asphalt, and such designation must be made to the
 Department by the Contractor. The proposed subcontractor must execute and submit to the
 Department a form, provided by the Department, prior to or concurrent with the Contractor’s
 request to sublet any Value Added Asphalt Pavement work, stipulating that the subcontractor
 assumes all responsibility as the Responsible Party for the Value Added Asphalt Pavement
 within the three-year warranty period. Failure to timely designate the Responsible Party will
 result in the Contractor being the Responsible Party unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the
 Department.
 Upon final acceptance of the Contract in accordance with 5-11, the Contractor’s
 responsibility for maintenance of all the work or facilities within the project limits of the
 Contract will terminate in accordance with 5-11; with the sole exception that the obligations set

 forth in this Section for Value Added Asphalt Pavement will continue thereafter to be the
 responsibility of the Responsible Party as otherwise provided in this Section.
 338-4 Statewide Disputes Review Board.
 The Statewide Disputes Review Board in effect for this Contract will resolve any and all
 disputes that may arise involving administration and enforcement of this Specification. The
 Responsible Party and the Department acknowledge that use of the Statewide Disputes Review
 Board is required, and the determinations of the Statewide Disputes Review Board for disputes
 arising out of this Specification will be binding on both the Responsible Party and the
 Department, with no right of appeal by either party.
 Meet the requirements of 8-3.
 338-5 Pavement Evaluation and Remedial Work.
 338-5.1 General: The Department’s Pavement Condition Survey Program, along with
 observations by the Engineer, will be used as the basis for determining the extent and the
 magnitude of the pavement distresses occurring on the project. In the event the level of distress
 exceeds any of the threshold values defined below, remedial work as described in 338-5.5 by the
 Responsible Party will be required.
 The Department will monitor the pavement for distresses and may require
 remedial action at any time. For evaluation purposes, the project will be subdivided into LOTs of
 0.1 mile per lane. When the segment is less than 0.1 mile, the segment will be called a partial
 LOT. For purposes of threshold values and remedial work, partial lots and lots will be treated as
 lots. The Department may conduct a Pavement Condition Survey of the value added pavement
 following the final acceptance of the project, and at intermediate times throughout the warranty
 period with findings provided when considered by the Department to be the obligation of the
 Responsible Party.
 The final survey, if determined by the Engineer to be necessary, will be conducted
 before the end of the warranty period with results provided to the Responsible Party for those
 conditions exceeding contract threshold values requiring remedial action that the Department
 believes to be an obligation of the Responsible Party. The Department will be responsible for all
 costs associated with the surveys.
 If the survey findings, intermediate or final, are to be disputed by the Responsible
 Party, written notification must be submitted to the Engineer within 30 calendar days of the date
 of receipt of the information from the Department.
 During the warranty period, the Responsible Party may monitor the project using
 nondestructive methods and may participate with the Department in the Pavement Condition
 Surveys upon request. The Responsible Party shall not conduct any coring, milling or other
 destructive methods without prior approval by the Engineer.
 338-5.2 Category 1 Pavement: For purposes of this Specification, “Category 1
 Pavement” is defined as mainline roadways, access roads and frontage roads with a design speed
 of 55 mph and greater.

 (1) Rutting: Rut depth to be determined by Laser Profiler in accordance with the Flexible Pavement Condition Survey Handbook.
 For any LOT that cannot be surveyed by the Laser Profiler, the rut depth will be determined manually in accordance with the
 Flexible Pavement Condition Survey Handbook, with the exception that the number of readings per LOT will be one every 20
 feet. For partial LOT, minimum of three measurements not exceeding 20 feet apart will be checked. When the average of the
 measurements obtained manually exceeds 0.40 inch, or if any individual measurement exceeds 0.6 inch, remedial work will be
 required..
 (1a) If pavement has an open graded friction course, remove and replace 2.0 inches.
 (2) Surface Deterioration: As used in Table 338-2, Surface Deterioration includes Raveling and/or Delamination affecting the
 Friction Course; Pot holes; Slippage Area(s); and Bleeding; all as defined and footnoted in Table 338-1.
 (3)Settlement/Depression: Depth of the settlement/depression to be determined by a 6 foot manual straightedge.
 
 338-5.4 Category 3 Pavement: For purposes of this Specification, “Category 3
 Pavement” is defined as bicycle paths, walking paths, median crossovers, shoulders and other

 Category 3 Pavements is excluded from this requirement.
 (2) Settlement/Depression: Depth of the settlement/depression to be determined by a 6 foot manual straightedge.
 
 338-5.5 Remedial Work: The Responsible Party will perform all necessary remedial
 work described within this Section at no cost to the Department. If the pavement distresses
 exceed threshold values and it is determined that the cause of the distress is due to the
 embankment, subgrade, base or other activities performed by the Contractor, the Responsible
 Party will be responsible for performing all remedial work associated with the pavement distress.
 Should an impasse develop in any regard as to the need for remedial work or the extent required,
 the Statewide Disputes Review Board will render a final decision by majority vote.
 Remedial work will not be required if any one of the following conditions is
 found to apply:
 a. Determination that the pavement thickness design as provided by the
 Department is deficient. The Department will make available a copy of the original pavement
 thickness design package and design traffic report to the Responsible Party upon request. The
 Responsible Party is responsible for performing all remedial work associated with the pavement
 distress if the pavement design is provided by the Contractor.
 b. Determination that the Accumulated ESALs (Number of 18 Kip
 Equivalent Single Axle Loads in the design lane) has increased by 25% or more than the
 Accumulated ESALs used by the Department for design purposes for the warranty period for the
 pavement design life. In calculating ESALs, the Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) will be
 obtained from the Department’s traffic count data and the T24 (Percent Heavy Trucks during a
 24 hour period) will be obtained from the Department’s traffic classification survey data.
 c. Determination that the deficiency was due to the failure of the existing
 underlying layers that were not part of the Contract work.
 d. Determination that the deficiency was the responsibility of a third party
 or its actions, unless the third party was performing work included in the Contract.
 If a measured distress value indicates remedial action is required per Table 338-1,
 Table 338-2 and/or Table 338-3, the Responsible Party must begin remedial work within
 45 calendar days of notification by the Department or a ruling of the Statewide Disputes Review
 Board. The Disputes Review Board will determine the allowable duration for the completion of
 the remedial work, but not to exceed 6 months.
 In the event remedial action is necessary and forensic information is required to
 determine the source of the distress, the Department may core and/or trench the pavement. The
 Responsible Party will not be responsible for damages to the pavement as a result of any forensic
 activities conducted by the Department.
 As applicable to distress criteria for rutting, ride and cracking for Category 1 and
 Category 2 pavements, when two LOTs requiring remedial action are not separated by three or
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 314
 
 more LOTs not requiring remedial action, the remedial work shall be required for the total length
 of all such contiguous LOTs, including the intermediate LOTs not requiring remedial action.
 Additionally, for Category 1 and Category 2 pavements, where such areas of
 remedial action are required due to raveling, slippage or bleeding are separated by less than
 1,000 feet, the remedial work will be required for the entire area contiguous to the distressed
 areas, including intermediate areas otherwise requiring no remedial action.
 The Responsible Party has the first option to perform all remedial work that is
 determined by the Department to be their responsibility. If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the
 problem poses an immediate danger to the traveling public and the Responsible Party cannot
 provide temporary mitigation for the defect within 4 hours of written notification and restore the
 pavement to its original design condition within 72 hours of written notification, the Engineer
 has the authority to have the remedial work performed by other forces. Temporary mitigation
 includes the use of traffic control systems such as barricades, drums, or other approved devices
 to secure the area including lane closures if necessary, and constructing temporary repairs
 making it safe for the roadway user until the defect can be restored to its original design
 condition. The Responsible Party is responsible for all incurred costs of the work performed by
 other forces should the problem (remedial work) be determined to be the responsibility of the
 Responsible Party. Remedial work performed by other forces does not alter any of the
 requirements, responsibilities or obligations of the Responsible Party.
 The Responsible Party must complete all remedial work to the satisfaction of the
 Engineer. Any disputes regarding the adequacy of the remedial work will be resolved by the
 Statewide Disputes Review Board. Approval of remedial work does not relieve the Responsible
 Party from continuing responsibility under the provisions of this Specification.
 Notify the Engineer in writing prior to beginning any remedial work. Meet the
 requirements of the Specifications when performing any remedial work. Perform all signing and
 traffic control in accordance with the current edition of the Department’s Standard Plans. Provide
 maintenance of traffic during remedial work at no additional cost to the Department. Lane
 closure restrictions listed in the original Contract will apply to remedial work. Written requests
 to obtain permission for lane closures for either forensic investigation or remedial work must be
 made to the Engineer 48 hours in advance of any lane closures. Do not perform any lane closures
 until written permission is given by the Engineer.
 If remedial work necessitates a corrective action to overlying asphalt layers,
 pavement markings, signal loops, adjacent lane(s), roadway shoulders, or other affected Contract
 work, perform these corrective actions using similar products at no additional cost to the
 Department.
 338-6 Responsible Party’s Failure to Perform.
 Should the Responsible Party fail to timely submit any dispute to the Statewide Disputes
 Review Board, fail to satisfactorily perform any remedial work, or fail to compensate the
 Department for any remedial work performed by the Department and determined to be the
 Responsible Party’s responsibility in accordance with this Specification, the Department will
 suspend, revoke or deny the Responsible Party’s certificate of qualification under the terms of
 Section 337.16(d)(2), Florida Statutes, for a minimum of 6 months or until the remedial work has
 been satisfactorily performed (or full and complete payment for remedial work performed by
 others made to the Department), whichever is longer. Should the Responsible Party choose to
 challenge the Department’s notification of intent for suspension, revocation or denial of
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 315
 
 qualification and the Department’s action is upheld, the Responsible Party will have its
 qualification suspended for an additional minimum of 6 months.
 The remedial work is not an obligation of the Contractor’s bond required by
 Section 337.18, Florida Statutes.

 SECTION 339
 MISCELLANEOUS ASPHALT PAVEMENT
 339-1 Description.
 Construct asphalt pavement in areas where vehicular traffic does not travel, such as
 pavement under guardrail, bicycle paths, median pavement, sidewalks, etc.
 Also, chemically treat the underlying soil to prevent plant growth.
 339-2 Materials.
 For the pavement, use any plant-mixed hot bituminous mixture meeting the requirements
 of a mix design verified by the Engineer, except do not use open-graded friction course (FC-5).
 For bicycle paths, use a mixture that produces a finished pavement which will not distort or mar
 under bicycle or mower wheel loads.
 In general, the Engineer will accept the mixture on the basis of visual inspection with no
 further testing required.
 339-3 Foundation and Soil Treatment.
 Shape the soil in areas where pavement is to be constructed, to a surface true to the lines,
 grades and typical cross-sections shown in the Plans. Compact the soil to a firm state.
 Immediately before placing the pavement, uniformly apply a pre-emergent herbicide in
 accordance with the requirements of 7-1.7, to the foundation soil. Ensure that the herbicide
 carries an approved label for use under paved surfaces, and that herbicide is applied in
 accordance with directions on the label.
 Prevent damage to any adjacent vegetation during herbicide application. Replace, at no
 expense to the Department, any plants damaged as the result of soil treatment outside designated
 areas.
 339-4 Placing Mixture.
 Uniformly place the hot bituminous mixture by machine or hand methods at the rate of
 spread or dimensions indicated in the Plans or as otherwise directed by the Engineer. If posts are
 to be constructed within the pavement area, the Contractor may cut holes for installation through
 the completed pavement. After completing installation of posts and compaction of the backfill
 material, patch the area around each post with fresh hot bituminous mixture.
 If directed by the Engineer, place miscellaneous asphalt pavement prior to placement of
 the final surface course.
 339-5 Compacting Mixture.
 Uniformly compact the hot bituminous mixture with lightweight rollers or vibratory
 compactors as directed by the Engineer. The Contractor may use hand tamps for compaction in
 areas which are inaccessible to other compaction equipment.
 The Engineer will not require a specific density.
 339-6 Surface Requirements.
 Provide a finished surface that is reasonably smooth, of uniform texture, and shaped so as
 to drain without ponding of water.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 317
 
 Upon completion of the pavement, shape the surface of the adjacent earth to match the
 pavement edges.
 339-7 Method of Measurement.
 For the work specified under this Section (including the pertinent provisions of
 Sections 320 and 330), the quantity to be paid for will be the weight of the mixture in tons. For
 each pay item, the pay quantity will be based on the quantity placed on the project, limited to
 105% of the adjusted plan quantity for the pay item. The adjusted plan quantity will be
 determined by dividing the original plan quantity (including any Engineer approved quantity
 revisions) by the design G mm stated in 334-1.4, then multiplying it by the tonnage-weighted
 average G mm of the mixes used on the project for the pay item. The plan quantity will be
 determined based on a spread rate of 100 pounds per square yard per inch of design thickness of
 asphalt placed over the area shown in the Plans.
 Prepare and submit a Certification of Quantities to the Engineer in accordance with 92.1.2.
 339-8 Basis of Payment.
 Price and payment will be full compensation for all work specified in this Section,
 including shaping and compacting the foundation, soil sterilization treatment, furnishing of the
 bituminous material used in the mixture, and shaping of adjacent earth surfaces.
 Payment will be made under:

 SECTION 341
 ASPHALT MEMBRANE INTERLAYER
 341-1 Description.
 Construct an asphalt membrane interlayer composed of a separate application of asphalt
 binder covered with a single application of aggregate. Obtain asphalt binder from a plant that is
 currently on the Department’s Production Facility Listing. Producers seeking inclusion on the list
 shall meet the requirements of Section 916.
 341-2 Materials.
 341-2.1 Asphalt Binder: Use a PG 76-22 meeting the requirements of Section 916 and
 listed on the Department’s Approved Products List (APL).
 341-2.2 Cover Material: Use Size No. 6 stone, slag, or gravel meeting the requirements
 of Section 901.
 341-3 Equipment.
 341-3.1 Power Broom: Provide a power broom for cleaning the existing pavement
 capable of removing all loose material from the surface.
 341-3.2 Spreading Equipment: Provide a self-propelled aggregate spreader that can be
 adjusted to accurately apply the cover material at the specified rate and that spreads the material
 uniformly.
 341-3.3 Rollers: Provide self-propelled, pneumatic-tired traffic type rollers equipped
 with at least 7 smooth-tread, low-pressure tires, and capable of carrying a gross load of at least
 8 tons. Maintain a minimum tire inflation pressure of 90 psi, or as specified by the manufacturer,
 such that in no two tires the air pressure varies more than 5 psi. Load the traffic roller as directed
 by the Engineer.
 341-3.4 Mixing Equipment: Use mixing equipment for asphalt binder designed for that
 purpose and capable of producing and maintaining a homogeneous mixture of asphalt cement at
 the specified temperature.
 341-3.5 Pressure Distributor: Use a pressure type distributor to apply asphalt binder
 capable of maintaining a homogeneous mixture of asphalt cement at the specified temperature
 and consistently apply the material in a uniform manner.
 341-4 Contractor’s Quality Control.
 Provide the necessary quality control of the asphalt binder, and interlayer construction in
 accordance with the Contract requirements. If the rate of application varies by more than 5%
 from the rate set by the Engineer in accordance with 341-6, immediately make all corrections
 necessary to bring the spread rate into the acceptable range. The Engineer may take additional
 measurements at any time. The Engineer will randomly check the Contractor’s measurement to
 verify the spread rate.
 341-5 Construction Procedure.
 341-5.1 Preparation of Surface: Prior to application of the asphalt binder, clean the
 existing pavement as specified in 300-5.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 319
 
 341-5.2 Application of Asphalt Binder: Apply the asphalt binder only under the
 following conditions:
 1. The air temperature is above 50ºF and rising.
 2. The pavement is absolutely dry.
 3. The wind conditions are such that cooling of the asphalt binder will not be so
 rapid as to prevent good bonding of the aggregate.
 Uniformly apply the asphalt binder, at the rate of 0.6 to 0.8 gal/yd2, as directed by
 the Engineer. Use an application rate corrected to 60ºF, in accordance with 300-9.3. Determine
 the rate of application after each application operation.
 341-5.3 Application of Cover Material: Immediately after application of the asphalt
 binder, uniformly spread the cover material at a rate of 0.26 and 0.33 ft3/yd2. The Engineer will
 set the exact rate. Determine the application rate at the beginning of each day’s production, and
 as needed to control the operation, a minimum of twice per day. Maintain an application rate
 such that the pavement is covered uniformly with aggregate, and is one aggregate layer thick. For
 the cover material, use aggregate that is reasonably free of any adherent coatings and that does
 not contain excessive moisture. Immediately after the application of cover material, check the
 surface to ensure a uniform distribution of cover material and a smooth surface.
 Do not separate the application of the asphalt binder and the application of the
 cover material by more than 300 feet, unless approved by the Engineer.
 341-5.4 Rolling: In order to ensure maximum embedment of the aggregate, cover the
 entire width of the mat immediately by traffic rollers. For the first coverage, provide a minimum
 of three traffic rollers in order to accomplish simultaneous rolling in echelon of the entire width
 of the spread.
 After initial rolling, immediately correct all portions of the completed surface, that
 the Engineer deems defective (not properly covered by aggregates, fat spots, excessive free
 aggregate, etc.).
 Following the first coverage, make additional coverages with traffic rollers as
 directed by the Engineer.
 341-5.5 Traffic Control: For the normal sequence of construction operations, place the
 first course of asphalt concrete overlay over the membrane prior to opening to traffic.
 341-6 Unacceptable Asphalt Membrane Interlayer.
 If the asphalt membrane interlayer is unacceptable due to incorrect blending, application
 rate, or not meeting the requirements of this Section, or damaged prior to placement of the
 asphalt concrete layer, remove and replace it as directed by the Engineer at no additional cost to
 the Department. Do not apply excessive amounts of asphalt binder.
 341-7 Placement of Asphalt Concrete Overlay.
 Ensure that the thickness and temperature of the initial layer of asphalt concrete placed on
 top of the asphalt membrane interlayer are such that the overlay bonds to the interlayer and the
 underlying layer without voids or excessive binder. Core the asphalt overlay as directed by the
 Engineer to evaluate the binder and aggregate spread rates, as well as the effectiveness of the
 asphalt concrete overlay in producing a well-bonded interlayer.

 metakaolin is incorporated into a concrete mix design, use a high range water-reducing
 admixture Type I, II, F or G.
 346-2.5.3.2 Flowing Concrete Admixtures for Precast/Prestressed
 Concrete: Use a Type I, II, F or G admixture for producing flowing concrete. If Type F or G
 admixture is used, verify the distribution of aggregates in accordance with ASTM C1610 except
 allow for minimal vibration for consolidating the concrete. The maximum allowable difference
 between the static segregation is less than or equal to 15 percent. Add the flowing concrete
 admixtures at the concrete production facility.
 346-2.5.4 Corrosion Inhibitor Admixture: Use only with concrete containing
 Type II cement, or Type II (MH) cement, and a water-reducing retardant admixture, Type D, or
 High Range Water-Reducer retarder admixture, Type G, to normalize the setting time of
 concrete.
 346-2.5.5 Accelerating Admixture for Precast Drainage and Incidental
 Concrete Products: The use of non-chloride admixtures Type C or Type E is allowed in the
 manufacturing of precast drainage and incidental concrete products.
 346-2.5.6 Type S Admixtures: When a workability retention, shrinkage reducing
 or a rheology modifying admixture is used, meet the requirements of a Type S admixture.
 346-3 Classification, Strength, Slump and Air Content.
 346-3.1 General: The separate classifications of concrete covered by this Section are
 designated as Class I, Class II, Class III, Class IV, Class V and Class VI. Strength and slump are
 specified in Table 2. The air content for all classes of concrete is less than or equal to 6.0%.
 Substitution of a higher class concrete in lieu of a lower class concrete may be
 allowed when the substituted concrete mixes are included as part of the QC Plan, or for precast
 concrete, the Precast Concrete Producer QC Plan. The substituted higher class concrete must
 meet or exceed the requirements of the lower class concrete and both classes must contain the
 same types of mix ingredients. When the compressive strength acceptance data is less than the
 minimum compressive strength of the higher design mix, notify the Engineer. Acceptance is
 based on the requirements in Table 2 for the lower class concrete.

 (a) For precast three-sided culverts, box culverts, endwalls, inlets, manholes and junction boxes, the target slump value and air
 content will not apply. The maximum allowable slump is 6 inches, except as noted in (b). The Contractor is permitted to use
 concrete meeting the requirements of ASTM C478 4,000 psi in lieu of Class I or Class II concrete for precast endwalls, inlets,
 manholes and junction boxes.
 (b) The Engineer may allow a higher target slump when a Type F, G, I or II admixture is used, except when flowing concrete is
 used. The maximum target slump shall be 7 inches.
 (c) For a reduction in the target slump for slip-form operations, submit a revision to the mix design to the Engineer.
 (d) When silica fume, ultrafine fly ash, metakaolin, or a ternary blend cement is used in Class IV, Class V, Class V (Special) or
 Class VI concrete, ensure that the concrete meets or exceeds a resistivity of 29 KOhm-cm at 28 days, when tested in accordance
 with AASHTO T358. Submit three 4 x 8 inch cylindrical test specimens to the Engineer for resistivity testing before mix design
 approval. Take the resistivity test specimens from the concrete of the laboratory trial batch or from the field trial batch of at least
 3 cubic yards. Verify the mix proportioning of the design mix and take representative samples of trial batch concrete for the
 required plastic and hardened property tests. Cure the field trial batch specimens similar to the standard laboratory curing
 methods. Submit the resistivity test specimens at least 7 calendar days prior to the scheduled 28 day test. The average resistivity
 of the three cylinders, eight readings per cylinder, is an indicator of the permeability of the concrete mix.
 (e) When precast three-sided culverts, box culverts, endwalls, inlets, manholes or junction boxes require a Class III concrete, the
 minimum cementitious materials is 470 pounds per cubic yard. Do not apply the air content range and the maximum target slump
 shall be 6 inches, except as allowed in (b).
 (f) Highly reactive pozzolans may be used outside the lower specified ranges to enhance strength and workability. Testing in
 accordance with AASHTO T358 is not required.
 
 346-3.2 Drilled Shaft Concrete: Notify the Engineer at least 48 hours before placing
 drilled shaft concrete. Obtain slump loss tests results demonstrating that the drilled shaft concrete
 maintains a slump of at least 5 inches throughout the concrete elapsed time before drilled shaft
 concrete operations begin. Ambient temperature conditions for placement of drilled shaft
 concrete for summer condition is 85°F or higher, and below 85°F for normal condition.
 Perform the slump loss test at the anticipated ambient temperature for drilled shaft
 placements greater than 30 cubic yards and an elapsed time of greater than five hours.
 Obtain slump loss test results from an approved laboratory or from a field
 demonstration. Slump loss test results for drilled shafts requiring 30 cubic yards of concrete or
 less and a maximum elapsed time of five hours or less may be done in a laboratory. Obtain all
 other slump loss test results in the field. Technicians performing the slump test must be ACI
 Field Grade I qualified.
 The concrete elapsed time is defined in Section 455. Obtain the Engineer’s
 approval for use of slump loss test results including elapsed time before concrete placement
 begins.
 Test each load of concrete for slump to ensure the slump is within the limits of
 346. Initially cure acceptance cylinders for 48 hours before transporting to the laboratory.
 If the elapsed time during placement exceeds the slump loss test data, submit an
 Engineering Analysis Scope in accordance with 6-4 by a Specialty Engineer knowledgeable in
 the area of foundations, to determine if the shaft is structurally sound and free from voids. At the
 direction of the Engineer, excavate the drilled shaft for inspection. Obtain approval from the
 Engineer before placing any additional shafts.
 346-3.3 Mass Concrete: When mass concrete is designated in the Contract Documents,
 use a Specialty Engineer to develop and administer a Mass Concrete Control Plan (MCCP).
 Develop the MCCP in accordance with Section 207 of the ACI Manual of Concrete Practice to
 ensure concrete core temperatures for any mass concrete element do not exceed the maximum
 allowable core temperature of 180°F and that the temperature differential between the element
 core and surface do not exceed the maximum allowable temperature differential of 35°F. Submit
 the MCCP to the Engineer for approval at least 14 days prior to the first anticipated mass
 concrete placement. Ensure the MCCP includes and fully describes the following:
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 326
 
 1. Concrete mix design proportions,
 2. Casting procedures,
 3. Insulating systems,
 4. Type and placement of temperature measuring and recording devices,
 5. Analysis of anticipated thermal developments for the various mass
 concrete elements for all anticipated ambient temperature ranges,
 6. Names and qualifications of all designees who will inspect the
 installation of and record the output of temperature measuring devices, and who will implement
 temperature control measures directed by the Specialty Engineer,
 7. Measures to prevent thermal shock, and
 8. Active cooling measures (if used).
 Fully comply with the approved MCCP. The Specialty Engineer or approved
 designee shall personally inspect and approve the installation of temperature measuring devices
 and verify that the process for recording temperature readings is effective for the first placement
 of each size and type mass component. The Specialty Engineer shall be available for immediate
 consultation during the monitoring period of any mass concrete element. Record temperature
 measuring device readings at intervals no greater than six hours, beginning at the completion of
 concrete placement and continuing until decreasing core temperatures and temperature
 differentials are confirmed in accordance with the approved MCCP. Leave temperature control
 mechanisms in place until the concrete core temperature is within 50°F of the ambient
 temperature. Within three days of the completion of temperature monitoring, submit a report to
 the Engineer which includes all temperature readings, temperature differentials, data logger
 summary sheets and the maximum core temperature and temperature differentials for each mass
 concrete element.
 Upon successful performance of the MCCP, reduced monitoring of similar
 elements may be requested. Submit any such requests to the Engineer for approval at least
 14 days prior to the requested date of reduced monitoring. If approved, the Specialty Engineer
 may monitor only the initial element of concrete elements meeting all of the following
 requirements:
 1. All elements have the same least cross sectional dimension,
 2. All elements have the same concrete mix design,
 3. All elements have the same insulation R value and active cooling
 measures (if used), and
 4. Ambient temperatures during concrete placement for all elements is
 within minus 10°F or plus 5°F of the ambient temperature during placement of the initial
 element.
 Install temperature measuring devices for all mass concrete elements. Resume the
 recording of temperature monitoring device output for all elements if directed by the Engineer.
 The Department will make no compensation, either monetary or time, for any impacts associated
 with reduced monitoring of mass concrete elements.
 Mass concrete control provisions are not required for drilled shafts supporting
 sign, signal, lighting or intelligent transportation (ITS) structures. At the Contractor’s option,
 instrumentation and temperature measuring may be omitted for any mass concrete substructure
 element meeting all of the following requirements:
 1. Least cross sectional dimension of six feet or less,
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 327
 
 2. Insulation R value of at least 2.5 provided for at least 72 hours
 following the completion of concrete placement,
 3. The environmental classification of the concrete element is Slightly
 Aggressive or Moderately Aggressive,
 4. The concrete mix design meets the mass concrete proportioning
 requirements of 346-2.3, and
 5. The total cementitious content of the concrete mix design is 750 lb/cy or
 less.
 6. Temperature of the concrete is 95°F or less at placement.
 If either the maximum allowable core temperature or temperature differential of
 any mass concrete element is exceeded, implement immediate corrective action as directed by
 the Specialty Engineer to remediate. The approval of the MCCP shall be revoked. Do not place
 any mass concrete elements until a revised MCCP has been approved by the Engineer. Submit an
 Engineering Analysis Scope in accordance with 6-4 for approval, which addresses the structural
 integrity and durability of any mass concrete element which is not cast in compliance with the
 approved MCCP or which exceeds the allowable core temperature or temperature differential.
 Submit all analyses and test results requested by the Engineer for any noncompliant mass
 concrete element to the satisfaction of the Engineer. The Department will make no
 compensation, either monetary or time, for the analyses and tests or any impacts upon the
 project.
 346-3.4 Flowing Concrete for Precast/Prestressed Concrete: Produce flowing
 concrete mix with target slump of 9 inches.
 Subsequent to the laboratory trial batch, perform a field demonstration of the
 proposed mix design by production and placement of at least three batches, 3 cubic yard
 minimum size each, of concrete containing flowing concrete HRWR admixture. Take
 representative samples from each batch and perform slump, air content, density (unit weight),
 and temperature tests on these samples. Cast specimens from each sample for compressive
 strength tests to verify the design mix trial. Record the ambient air temperature during the test.
 Ensure that the concrete properties are within the required specification limits. The plants that
 are producing concrete with batch sizes of less than 3 cubic yards are required to produce and
 place at least a total amount of 9 cubic yards and perform the aforementioned tests on at least
 three randomly selected batches.
 Determine the workability of the demonstration concrete batches by performing
 the slump tests on the samples taken at 15 minute intervals from each batch. Continue sampling
 and testing until the slump measures 6 inches or less. From the plot of slump versus time,
 determine the time for each batch when the slump is at 7.5 inches. The shortest time period
 determined from three consecutive batches, at 7.5 inches slump, is considered the cutoff time of
 the proposed concrete mix. For production concrete, ensure that the time between the batching
 and depositing of each load of concrete is less than the cutoff time of the mix and also does not
 exceed the allowable time limit specified in this Section.
 Ensure that the demonstration concrete is mixed, delivered, placed, consolidated
 and cured in accordance with the proposed method and sequence. Produce the flowing concrete
 batches at slumps between 7.5 inches to 10.5 inches.
 Perform inspection of the demonstration concrete during batching, delivery,
 placement and post placement. During placement, ensure that the concrete batches meet all

 328
 
 plastic property requirements of the specifications and maintain their cohesive nature without
 excessive bleeding, segregation, or abnormal retardation.
 Dispose of concrete produced for demonstration purposes at no expense to the
 Department. Subject to the Engineer’s approval, the Contractor may incorporate this concrete
 into non-reinforced concrete items and may be included for payment, provided it meets Contract
 requirements for slump, entrained air, and strength.
 After removal of the forms, perform the post-placement inspection of the in-place
 concrete. Observe for any signs of honeycombs, cracks, aggregate segregation or any other
 surface defects and ensure that the hardened concrete is free from these deficiencies. The
 Engineer may require saw cutting of the mock-up products to verify the uniform distribution of
 the aggregates within the saw cut surfaces and around the reinforcing steel and prestressing
 strands. The Engineer will require saw cutting of the demonstration mock-up products for plants
 that are demonstrating the use of the flowing concrete for the first time. Obtain core samples in
 accordance with FM 5-617, section 7 to inspect the aggregate distribution.
 Submit the results of the laboratory trial batch tests and field demonstration of
 verified test data and inspection reports to the Engineer, along with certification stating that the
 results of the laboratory trial batch tests and field demonstration tests indicate that the proposed
 concrete mix design meets the requirements of the specifications. For the proposed mix design,
 state the anticipated maximum time limit between the batching and when the concrete of each
 batch is deposited during the production.
 Upon the review and verification of the laboratory trial batch, field demonstration
 test data, inspection reports and contractor’s certification statement, the Department will approve
 the proposed mix design.
 The Department may approve proposed flowing concrete mixes, centrally mixed
 at the placement site, without the production of demonstration batches, provided that the
 proposed mix meets the following two criteria:
 1. A previously approved flowing concrete mix of the same class has
 demonstrated satisfactory performance under the proposed job placing conditions with a
 minimum of fifteen consecutive Department acceptance tests, which met all plastic and hardened
 concrete test requirements.
 2. The cementitious materials and chemical admixtures, including the
 flowing concrete HRWR admixture, used in the proposed mix are the same materials from the
 same source used in the previously approved mix, (1) above.
 Do not produce or place concrete until the design mixes have been approved.

 by the failing test results, until corrective measures are made. Submit an Engineering Analysis
 Scope in accordance with 6-4 by a Specialty Engineer knowledgeable in the areas of corrosion
 and corrosion control, to determine if the material meets the intended service life of the structure
 on all concrete produced from the mix design failing chloride test results to the previous passing
 test results..

 *The Department will use the same type of meter for Verification testing as used for QC testing. When using pressure type
 meters, use an aggregate correction factor determined by the concrete producer for each mix design to be tested. Record and
 certify test results for correction factors for each type of aggregate at the concrete production facility.
 ** Provide curing facilities that have the capacity to store all QC, Verification, “hold” and Independent Verification cylinders
 simultaneously for the initial curing. Cylinders will be delivered to the testing laboratory in their molds. The laboratory will
 remove the specimens from the molds and begin final curing.
 ***The Verification technician will use the same size cylinders as the Quality Control technician.
 **** Take the test sample from the middle portion of the batch in lieu of collecting and compositing samples from two or more
 portions, as described in ASTM C172.
 
 346-6 Quality Control.
 346-6.1 General:
 Perform QC activities to ensure materials, methods, techniques, personnel, procedures and
 processes utilized during production meet the specified requirements. For precast/prestressed
 operations, ensure that the QC testing is performed by the producer.
 Accept the responsibility for QC inspections on all phases of work. Ensure all
 materials and workmanship incorporated into the project meet the requirements of the Contract
 Documents.
 346-6.2 Concrete Design Mix: Provide concrete that has been produced in accordance
 with a Department approved design mix, in a uniform mass free from balls and lumps.
 For slump target values in excess of 6 inches or self consolidating concrete, utilize
 a grate over the conveyance equipment to capture any lumps or balls that may be present in the
 mix. The grate must cover the entire opening of the conveyance equipment and have an opening
 that is a maximum of 2 1/2 inches in any one direction. Remove the lumps or balls from the grate

 and discard them. Discharge the concrete in a manner satisfactory to the Engineer. Perform
 demonstration batches to ensure complete and thorough placements in complex elements, when
 requested by the Engineer.
 Do not place concretes of different compositions such that the plastic concretes
 may combine, except where the Plans require concrete with a surface resistivity value of
 29 Kohm-cm or below and one with higher than 29 Kohm-cm values in a continuous placement.
 Produce these concretes using separate design mixes. For example, designate the mix with
 calcium nitrite as the original mix and the mix without calcium nitrite as the redesigned mix.
 Ensure that both mixes contain the same cement, fly ash or slag, coarse and fine aggregates and
 admixtures. Submit both mixes for approval as separate mix designs, both meeting all
 requirements of this Section. Ensure that the redesigned mix exhibits plastic and hardened
 qualities which are additionally approved by the Engineer as suitable for placement with the
 original mix. The Engineer will approve the redesigned mix for commingling with the original
 mix and for a specific project application only. Alternately, place a construction joint at the
 location of the change in concretes.
 346-6.3 Delivery Certification: Ensure that an electronic delivery ticket is furnished
 with each batch of concrete before unloading at the placement site. The delivery ticket may be
 proprietary software or in the form of an electronic spreadsheet, but shall be printed. Ensure that
 the materials and quantities incorporated into the batch of concrete are printed on the delivery
 ticket. Include the following information on the Delivery Ticket:
 1. Arrival time at jobsite,
 2. Time that concrete mix has been completely discharged,
 3. Number of revolutions upon arrival at the jobsite,
 4. Total gallons of water added at the jobsite,
 5. Additional mixing revolutions when water is added,
 6. Total number of revolutions.
 Items 3 through 6 do not apply to non-agitating concrete transporting vehicles.
 Ensure the batcher responsible for production of the batch of concrete signs the
 delivery ticket, certifying the batch of concrete was produced in accordance with the Contract
 Documents.
 Sign the delivery ticket certifying that the design mix maximum specified water to
 cementitious materials ratio was not exceeded due to any jobsite adjustments to the batch of
 concrete, and that the batch of concrete was delivered and placed in accordance with the Contract
 Documents.
 346-6.4 Plastic Property Tolerances: Do not place concrete with a slump more than
 plus or minus 1.5 inches from the target slump value specified in Table 2.
 Reject concrete with slump or air content that does not fall within the specified
 tolerances and immediately notify the concrete production facility that an adjustment of the
 concrete mixture is required. If a load does not fall within the tolerances, test each subsequent
 load and the first adjusted load. If failing concrete is not rejected or adjustments are not
 implemented, the Engineer may reject the concrete and terminate further production until the
 corrections are implemented.
 Do not allow concrete to remain in a transporting vehicle to reduce slump. Water
 may be added only upon arrival of the concrete to the jobsite and not thereafter.

 346-7 Mixing and Delivering Concrete.
 346-7.1 General Requirements: Operate all concrete mixers at speeds and volumes per
 the manufacturer’s design or recommendation as stipulated on the mixer rating plate.
 346-7.2 Transit Truck Mixing: When water is added at the jobsite, mix the concrete
 30 additional drum mixing revolutions. Do not add water after the total number of drum mixing
 revolutions exceeds 130, do not make additional mix adjustments. Discharge all concrete from
 truck mixers before total drum revolutions exceed 300. Seek approval from the Engineer prior to
 using a central mixer and depositing the batch into a truck mixer.
 346-7.2.1 Transit Time: Ensure compliance with Table 6 between the initial
 introduction of water into the mix and completely discharging all of the concrete from the truck.
 Reject concrete exceeding the maximum transit time. For critical placements, the Engineer may
 authorize the placement of the concrete.

 *When a water-reducing and retarding admixture (Type D, Type G or Type II) is used.
 
 346-7.2.2 Placement Time: All the concrete in a load must be in its final
 placement position a maximum of 15 minutes after the transit time has expired unless a time
 extension is approved by the Engineer
 346-7.3 On-site Batching and Mixing: Use a mixer of sufficient capacity to prevent
 delays that may be detrimental to the quality of the work. Ensure that the accuracy of batching
 equipment is in accordance with requirements of this Section.
 346-7.4 Concreting in Cold Weather: Do not mix or place concrete when the air
 temperature is below 40ºF. Protect the fresh concrete from freezing in accordance with
 Section 400. The requirements of concreting in cold weather are not applicable to precast
 concrete mixing and placement operations occurring in a temperature controlled environment.
 346-7.5 Concreting in Hot Weather: Hot weather concreting is defined as the
 production, placing and curing of concrete when the concrete temperature at placing exceeds
 85ºF but is 100ºF or less.
 Unless the specified hot weather concreting measures are in effect, reject concrete
 exceeding 85ºF at the time of placement. Regardless of special measures taken, reject concrete
 exceeding 100ºF. Predict the concrete temperatures at placement time and implement hot
 weather measures to avoid production shutdown.
 346-7.6 Adding Water to Concrete at the Placement Site: Water may be added at the
 placement site provided the addition of water does not exceed the water to cementitious materials
 ratio as defined by the mix design. After adding water, perform a slump test to confirm the
 concrete is within the slump tolerance range; if the slump is outside the tolerance range, reject
 the load. If an adjustment is made at the concrete production facility, perform a slump test on the
 next load to ensure the concrete is within the slump tolerance range. Do not place concrete
 represented by slump test results outside of the tolerance range. Include water missing from the
 water storage tanks upon arrival at the project site in the jobsite water added.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 333
 
 346-7.7 Sample Location: Obtain acceptance samples from the point of final placement.
 Where concrete buckets are used to discharge concrete directly to the point of
 final placement or into the hopper of a tremie pipe, samples will be obtained from the discharge
 of the bucket. When the concrete is discharged directly from the mixer into the bucket and the
 bucket is discharged within 20 minutes, samples may be obtained from the discharge of the
 mixer.
 Where conveyor belts, troughs, pumps, or chutes are used to transport concrete
 directly to the point of final placement or into the hopper of a tremie pipe, samples will be
 obtained from the discharge end of the entire conveyor belt, trough, pump, or chute system.
 Where concrete is placed in a drilled shaft or other element using a tremie pipe
 and a concrete pump, samples will be obtained from the discharge of the pump line at the
 location of the tremie hopper.
 For all other placement methods, prior to each placement, obtain Department
 approval for sampling at the discharge of the mixer in lieu of sampling at the point of final
 placement. Submit the sampling correlation procedure to the Engineer for approval prior to the
 placement of the concrete. Once the comparative sampling correlation is approved by the
 Engineer, apply this correlation to the plastic properties tolerances for samples obtained from the
 discharge of mixer.
 Where a concrete pump is used to deposit concrete directly into a drilled shaft
 which is a wet excavation without the use of a tremie, or other applications as approved by the
 Engineer, ensure the discharge end of the pump line remains immersed in the concrete at all
 times after starting concrete placement.
 346-8 Plastic Concrete Sampling and Testing.
 QC tests include air content, temperature, slump, and preparing compressive strength
 cylinders for testing at later dates. In addition, calculate the water to cementitious materials ratio
 in accordance with FM 5-501 for compliance to the approved mix design.
 Ensure that each truck has a rating plate and a valid mixer identification card issued by
 the Department. Ensure that the revolution counter on the mixer is working properly, and
 calibration of the water dispenser has been performed within the last twelve months. Reject any
 concrete batches that are delivered in trucks that do not have mixer identification cards. Remove
 the mixer identification card when a truck mixer is discovered to be in noncompliance and the
 mixer deficiencies cannot be repaired immediately. When the mixer identification card is
 removed for noncompliance, make note of the deficiency or deficiencies found, and forward the
 card to the District Materials and Research Engineer who has Producer QC Plan acceptance
 authority.
 Perform plastic concrete tests on the initial delivery from each plant of each concrete
 design mix each day. Ensure QC technicians meeting the requirements of Section 105 are present
 and performing tests throughout the placement operation. Ensure one technician is present and
 performing tests throughout the placement operation at each placement site. If a project has
 multiple concrete placements at the same time, identify the technicians in the Q C Plan to ensure
 minimum sampling and testing frequencies are met. Ensure that the equipment used for delivery,
 placement and finishing meets the requirements of this Specification.
 When a truck designated for QC testing arrives at the discharge site, a subsequent truck
 may also discharge once a representative sample has been collected from the QC truck and while
 awaiting the results of QC testing. Reject non-complying loads at the jobsite. Ensure that
 corrections are made on subsequent loads. Immediately cease concrete discharge of all trucks if
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 334
 
 the QC truck has failing test. Perform plastic properties tests on all trucks prior to the first
 corrected truck and the corrected truck. When more than one truck is discharging into a pump
 simultaneously, only the truck designated for QC testing may discharge into the pump to obtain a
 representative sample of concrete from the QC truck only.
 Furnish sufficient concrete of each design mix as required by the Engineer for
 verification testing. When the Engineer’s verification test results do not compare with the QC
 plastic properties test results, within the limits defined by the Independent Assurance (IA)
 checklist comparison criteria, located in Materials Manual Chapter 5, disposition of the concrete
 will be at the option of the Contractor.
 On concrete placements consisting of only one load of concrete, perform initial sampling
 and testing in accordance with this Section. The acceptance sample and plastic properties tests
 may be taken from the initial portion of the load.
 If any of the QC plastic properties tests fail, reject the remainder of that load, and any
 other loads that have begun discharging, terminate the LOT and notify the Engineer. Make
 cylinders representing that LOT from the same sample of concrete.
 Following termination of a LOT, obtain samples from a new load, and perform plastic
 properties tests until such time as the water to cementitious materials ratio, air content,
 temperature and slump comply with the Specification requirements. Initiate a new LOT once the
 testing indicates compliance with Specification requirements.
 Suspend production when any five loads in two days of production of the same design
 mix are outside the specified tolerances. Increase the frequency of QC testing to one per load to
 bring the concrete within allowable tolerances. After production resumes, obtain the Engineer’s
 approval before returning to the normal frequency of QC testing.
 If concrete placement stops for more than 90 minutes, perform initial plastic properties
 testing on the next batch and continue the LOT. Cylinders cast for that LOT will represent the
 entire LOT.
 When the Department performs Independent Verification, the Contractor may perform
 the same tests on the concrete at the same time. The Department will compare results based on
 the Independent Assurance Checklist tolerances.
 346-9 Acceptance Sampling and Testing.
 346-9.1 General: Perform plastic properties tests in accordance with 346-8 and cast a set
 of three QC cylinders, for all structural concrete incorporated into the project. Take these
 acceptance samples randomly as determined by a random number generator (acceptable to the
 Department). The Department will independently perform verification plastic properties tests and
 cast a set of verification cylinders. The verification cylinders will be the same size cylinder
 selected by the Contractor, from a separate sample from the same load of concrete as the
 Contractor’s QC sample.
 For each set of QC cylinders verified by the Department, cast one additional
 cylinder from the same sample, and identify it as the QC “hold” cylinder. The Department will
 also cast one additional “hold” cylinder from each Verification sample. All cylinders will be
 clearly identified as outlined in the Sample/Lot Numbering System instructions located on the
 State Materials Office website. Deliver the QC samples, including the QC “hold” cylinder to the
 final curing facility in accordance with ASTM C31. At this same time, the Department will
 deliver the Verification samples, including the Verification “hold” cylinder, to their final curing
 facility.

 335
 
 Test the QC laboratory cured samples for compressive strength at the age of
 28 days, in a laboratory meeting and maintaining at all times the qualification requirements listed
 in Section 105.
 The QC testing laboratory will input the compressive strength test results into the
 Department’s sample tracking database within 24 hours. When the QC testing laboratory cannot
 input the compressive strength test results into the Department’s sample tracking database within
 24 hours, the QC testing laboratory will notify the Verification testing laboratory within 24 hours
 of testing the cylinder and provide the Verification testing laboratory the compressive strength
 test results. Ensure the compressive strength results are input into the Department’s sample
 tracking database within 72 hours of determining the compressive strength of the cylinders.
 The Department will compare the Verification sample results with the
 corresponding QC sample results. In the event that one set of compressive strength data for a set
 of cylinders falls outside the range of the other set of cylinders, use the lower Range of Average
 Compressive Strength to determine the comparison criteria. Based on this comparison, the
 Department will determine if the Comparison Criteria as shown in Table 7 has been met. When
 the difference between QC and Verification is less than or equal to the Comparison Criteria, the
 QC data is verified. When the difference between QC and Verification data exceeds the
 Comparison Criteria, the data is not verified and the Engineer will initiate the resolution
 procedure.

 346-9.2 Sampling Frequency: As a minimum, sample and test concrete of each design
 mix for water to cementitious materials ratio, air content, temperature, slump and compressive
 strength once per LOT as defined by Table 8. The Engineer will randomly verify one of every
 four consecutive LOTs of each design mix based on a random number generator. The
 Department may perform Independent Verification testing to verify compliance with
 specification requirements. All QC activities, calculations, and inspections will be randomly
 confirmed by the Department.

 *For any class of concrete used for roadway concrete barrier, the lot size is defined as 100 cubic yards, or one day’s production,
 whichever is less.
 
 346-9.2.1 Reduced Frequency for Acceptance Tests: The LOT size may
 represent 100 cubic yards when produced with the same mix design at the same concrete
 production facility for the same prime contractor and subcontractor on a given Contract. As an
 exception, the requirements for the precast/prestressed production facility will only include the
 same mix design at the same concrete production facility. Submit test results indicating the
 average compressive strength is greater than two standard deviations above the specified
 minimum strength for that class of concrete. Base calculations on a minimum of ten consecutive
 strength test results for a Class IV or higher; or a minimum of five consecutive strength results
 for a Class III or lower.
 The average of the consecutive compressive strength test results, based on
 the class of concrete, can be established using historical data from a previous Department
 project. The tests from the previous Department project must be within the last 60 calendar days
 or may also be established by a succession of samples on the current project. Only one sample
 can be taken from each LOT. Test data must be from a laboratory meeting the requirements of
 Section 105. Obtain Department approval before beginning reduced frequency LOT’s.
 If at any time a strength test is not verified or the average strength of the
 previous ten or five consecutive samples based on the class of concrete from the same mix
 design and the same production facility is less than the specified minimum plus two standard
 deviations, return to the maximum production quantity represented by the LOT as defined in
 Table 8. Notify the Engineer that the maximum production rate is reinstated. In order to reinitiate
 reduced frequency, submit a new set of strength test results.
 346-9.3 Strength Test Definition: The strength test of a LOT is defined as the average
 of the compressive strengths tests of three cylinders cast from the same sample of concrete from
 the LOT.
 346-9.4 Acceptance of Concrete: Ensure that the hardened concrete strength test results
 are obtained in accordance with 346-9.3. Do not discard a cylinder strength test result based on
 low strength (strength below the specified minimum strength as per the provisions of this
 Section).
 When one of the three QC cylinders from a LOT is lost, missing, damaged or
 destroyed, determination of compressive strength will be made by averaging the remaining two
 cylinders. If more than one QC cylinder from a LOT is lost, missing, damaged or destroyed, the
 Contractor will core the structure at no additional expense to the Department to determine the
 compressive strength. Acceptance of LOT may be based on verification data at the discretion of
 the Engineer. Obtain the approval of the Engineer to core, and of the core location prior to
 coring.
 For each QC and each QC hold cylinder that is lost, missing, damaged or
 destroyed, payment for that LOT will be reduced by $750.00 per 1,000 psi of the specified
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 337
 
 design strength [Example: loss of two Class IV (Drill Shaft) QC cylinders that has no
 verification data will require the element to be cored and a pay reduction will be assessed
 (4,000 psi / 1,000 psi) x $750 x 2 = $6,000]. This reduction will be in addition to any pay
 adjustment for low strength.
 When QC compressive strength test results are not verified, the resolution
 procedure will be used to accept or reject the concrete. Maintain the “hold” cylinders until the
 verification of the compressive strength test results.
 When QC test results are verified, the Engineer will accept the concrete based on
 QC test results. The Engineer will accept at full pay only LOTs of concrete represented by
 plastic property results which meet the requirements of the approved mix design and strength test
 results which equal or exceed the respective specified minimum strength.
 346-9.5 Resolution Procedure: The Department may initiate an IA review of sampling
 and testing methods. The resolution procedure may consist of, but need not be limited to, a
 review of sampling and testing of fresh concrete, calculation of water to cementitious materials
 ratio, handling of cylinders, curing procedures and compressive strength testing. Compare the
 Verification sample results with the verification hold cylinders results. Compare the QC sample
 results with the QC hold cylinders results. Comparison results must not be greater than the
 comparison requirements in Table 7. Core samples of the hardened concrete may be required.
 The Engineer will determine through the resolution procedure whether the QC
 strength test results or the verification strength test are deemed to be the most accurate, LOTS
 will then be considered to be verified. When the Engineer cannot determine which strength test
 results are the most accurate, the concrete represented by the four consecutive LOTs will be
 evaluated based on the QC data. The Engineer will inform the QC and the Verification lab within
 three calendar days of the acceptance compressive strength test to transport their “hold”
 cylinders to the resolution lab. The QC and Verification laboratories will transport their own
 hold cylinder to the resolution testing laboratory within 72 hours after the Engineer notifies the
 Contractor that a resolution is required. In addition, the Engineer will ensure that the QC and
 verification “hold” cylinders are tested within 14 calendar days of the acceptance strength tests.
 The resolution investigation will determine the strength test results for each of the
 four or less LOTs. When the QC strength test results are deemed to be the most accurate, the QC
 strength test results will represent the four or less consecutive LOTs and the Department will pay
 for the resolution testing and investigation. When the verification strength test results are deemed
 to be the most accurate, the Department will assess a $1,000 pay reduction for the cost of the
 Resolution Investigation.
 The results of the resolution procedure will be forwarded to the Contractor within
 five working days after completion of the investigation.
 346-9.6 Small Quantities of Concrete: When a project has a total plan quantity of less
 than 50 cubic yards, that concrete will be accepted based on the satisfactory compressive
 strength of the QC cylinders. Submit certification to the Engineer that the concrete was batched
 and placed in accordance with the Contract Documents. Submit a QC Plan for the concrete
 placement operation in accordance with Section 105. In addition, the Engineer may conduct
 Independent Verification (IV) testing as identified in 346-9. Evaluate the concrete in accordance
 with 346-10 at the discretion of the Engineer.

 346-10 Investigation of Low Strength Concrete and Structural Adequacy.
 346-10.1 General: When a concrete acceptance strength test result falls 500 psi or less
 below the specified minimum strength, coring will not be allowed and the concrete will be
 considered structurally adequate.
 When a concrete acceptance strength test result falls more than 500 psi below the
 specified minimum strength, submit an Engineering Analysis Scope in accordance with 6-4 to
 establish strength adequacy or; at the Engineer’s discretion, obtain drilled core samples as
 specified in 346-10.3 to determine the in-place strength of the LOT of concrete in question, at no
 additional expense to the Department. The Engineer will determine whether to allow coring or
 require an engineering analysis.
 When the concrete is deemed to have low strength, obtain and test the cores and
 report the data to the Engineer within 14 calendar days of the 28 day compressive strength tests.
 Core strength test results obtained from the structure will be accepted by both the Contractor and
 the Department as the in-place strength of the LOT of concrete in question. The core strength test
 results will be final and used in lieu of the cylinder strength test results for determination of
 structural adequacy and any pay adjustment. The Department will calculate the strength value to
 be the average of the compressive strengths of the three individual cores. This will be accepted
 as the actual measured value. Obtain the Engineer’s approval before taking any core samples.
 346-10.2 Investigation and Determination of Structural Adequacy: When the
 Department determines that an investigation is necessary, make an investigation into the
 structural adequacy of the LOT of concrete represented by that acceptance strength test result, at
 no additional expense to the Department. The Engineer may also require the Contractor to
 perform additional testing as necessary to determine structural adequacy of the concrete.
 If core strength test results are 500 psi or less below the specified minimum
 strength, consider the concrete represented by the cores structurally adequate. If the core strength
 test results are more than 500 psi below the specified minimum strength, submit an Engineering
 Analysis Scope in accordance with 6-4 that includes a full structural analysis. If the results of the
 structural analysis indicate adequate strength to serve its intended purpose with adequate
 durability, and is approved by the Engineer, the Contractor may leave the concrete in place
 subject to the requirements of 346-11, otherwise, remove and replace the LOT of concrete in
 question at no additional expense to the Department.
 346-10.3 Coring for Determination of Structural Adequacy: Notify the Engineer
 48 hours prior to taking core samples. The Engineer will select the size and location of the drilled
 cores so that the structure is not impaired and does not sustain permanent damage after repairing
 the core holes. Sample three undamaged cores taken from the same approximate location where
 the questionable concrete is represented by the low strength concrete test cylinders. Repair core
 holes after samples are taken with a product in compliance with Section 930 or 934 and meeting
 the approval of the Engineer.
 346-10.4 Core Conditioning and Testing: Test the cores in accordance with
 ASTM C42. Test the cores after obtaining the samples within seven calendar days.
 346-11 Pay Adjustments for Low Strength Concrete.
 346-11.1 General: Any LOT of concrete failing to meet the specified minimum strength
 as defined in 346-3, 346-9, 346-10 and satisfactorily meeting all other requirements of the
 Contract Documents, including structural adequacy, the Engineer will individually reduce the
 price of each low strength LOT in accordance with this Section.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 339
 
 346-11.2 Basis for Pay Adjustments: When an acceptance strength test result falls more
 than 500 psi below the specified minimum strength, core samples may be obtained in accordance
 with ASTM C42 from the respective LOT of concrete represented by the low acceptance
 strength test result for determining pay adjustments. A price adjustment will be applied to the
 certified invoice price the Contractor paid for the concrete or the precast product.
 Do not core hardened concrete for determining pay adjustments when the 28 day
 acceptance cylinder strength test results are less than 500 psi below the specified minimum
 strength.
 The results of strength tests of the drilled cores, subject to 346-11.5 and 346-11.6,
 will be used as the acceptance results and will be used in lieu of the cylinder strength test results
 for determining pay adjustments.
 In precast operations, excluding prestressed, ensure that the producer submits
 acceptable core sample test results to the Engineer. The producer may elect to use the products in
 accordance with 346-11. Otherwise, replace the concrete in question at no additional cost to the
 Department. For prestressed concrete, core sample testing is not allowed for pay adjustment. The
 results of the cylinder strength tests will be used to determine material acceptance and pay
 adjustment.
 346-11.3 Coring for Determination of Pay Adjustments: Obtain the cores in
 accordance with 346-10.3.
 346-11.4 Core Conditioning and Testing: Test the cores in accordance with 346-10.4.
 346-11.5 Core Strength Representing Equivalent 28 Day Strength: For cores tested
 no later than 42 calendar days after the concrete was cast, the Engineer will accept the core
 strengths obtained as representing the equivalent 28 day strength of the LOT of concrete in
 question. The Engineer will calculate the strength value to be the average of the compressive
 strengths of the three individual cores. The Engineer will accept this strength at its actual
 measured value.
 346-11.6 Core Strength Adjustments: For cores tested later than 42 calendar days after
 the concrete was cast, the Engineer will establish the equivalency between 28 day strength and
 strength at ages after 42 calendar days. The Engineer will relate the strength at the actual test age
 to 28 day strength for the design mix represented by the cores using the following relationship:
 346-11.6.1 Portland Cement Concrete without Pozzolan or Slag:
 Equivalent 28 Day Strength, f’c (28) = 1/F (Average Core Strength) x 100

 346-11.7 Calculating Pay Adjustments: The Engineer will determine payment
 reductions for low strength concrete accepted by the Department and represented by either
 cylinder or core strength test results below the specified minimum strength, in accordance with
 the following:
 Reduction in Pay is equal to the reduction in percentage of concrete cylinder
 strength (specified minimum strength minus actual strength divided by specified minimum
 strength).
 For the elements that payments are based on the per foot basis, the Engineer will
 adjust the price reduction from cubic yards basis to per foot basis, determine the total linear feet
 of the elements that are affected by low strength concrete samples and apply the adjusted price
 reduction accordingly.
 346-12 Pay Reduction for Plastic Properties
 A rejected load in accordance with 346-6.4 is defined as the entire quantity of concrete
 contained within a single ready mix truck or other single delivery vehicle regardless of what
 percentage of the load was placed. If concrete fails a plastic properties test and is thereby a
 rejected load but its placement continues after completion of a plastic properties test having a
 failing result, payment for the concrete will be reduced.
 The pay reduction for cast-in-place concrete will be twice the certified invoice price per
 cubic yard of the quantity of concrete in the rejected load.
 The pay reduction for placing a rejected load of concrete into a precast product will be
 applied to that percentage of the precast product that is composed of the concrete in the rejected
 load. The percentage will be converted to a reduction factor which is a numerical value greater
 than zero but not greater than one. The precast product payment reduction will be twice the
 Contractor’s billed price from the Producer for the precast product multiplied by the reduction
 factor.
 If the Engineer authorizes placement of the concrete, even though plastic properties
 require rejection, there will be no pay reduction based on plastic properties failures; however,
 any other pay reductions will apply.

 CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 350-1 Description.
 Construct Portland cement concrete pavement in one course, on a prepared subgrade. Use
 either the fixed-form or the slip-form method of construction. When reinforced cement concrete
 pavement is specified or required, use concrete reinforced with steel bars or welded wire
 reinforcement, in accordance with details shown in the Plans. The Engineer may require a
 demonstration of equipment and paving operations.
 If any uncontrolled cracks appear during the life of the Contract, remove and replace the
 cracked concrete at no expense to the Department. Investigate and implement immediate
 effective solutions to eliminate further cracks, in consultation with, and subject to the approval of
 the Engineer.
 350-2 Materials.
 Meet the following requirements:
 Concrete, Class I or Class I (Pavement) .............Section 346
 Grinding Concrete Pavement ..............................Section 352
 Curing Materials .................................................Section 925
 Embedded Items..................................................Section 931
 Joint Seal .............................................................Section 932
 For concrete pavement placed using the slip-form method of construction, utilize
 Concrete Class I (Pavement). For concrete pavement placed by hand in constructed forms, utilize
 Concrete Class I or Concrete Class I (Pavement). LOT size for the use of either material shall be
 as stated in Section 346 for Concrete Class I (Pavement).
 350-3 Equipment.
 350-3.1 General: Ensure the equipment and tools that are to be used meet the following:
 The capability of handling materials and performing all parts of the work.
 To be of such capacity that the paver operates continuously and at a constant rate
 of production, with starting and stopping held to a minimum.
 When equipment operates on the side forms, use scraping devices to clean
 accumulations from the top of the forms and wheels.
 The forms will be a rigid material and mortar tight. Ensure that the alignment and
 grade of all forms are in accordance with the contract documents, prior to the placing of
 concrete.
 350-3.2 Slip-Form Paver: Provide a slip-form paver that is self-propelled and equipped
 to spread, strike-off, consolidate, screed, and float-finish the freshly placed concrete in one
 complete pass of the equipment, in such a manner that a minimum amount of hand-finishing will
 be necessary to provide a dense and homogeneous pavement. Ensure that the equipment is of
 such dimensions and arrangement as to cover the full width of the pavement strip being placed.
 Use equipment that is adjustable as to crown and superelevation and that can shape and compact
 the concrete into a dense and stable mass, to the required cross-section. Ensure that the crown
 adjustment is readily controllable for accuracy in crown transitions.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 345
 
 Operate the paver on tracks having sufficient contact area to prevent track
 slippage under load. Ensure that the length of ground contact per track and the arrangement of
 tracks are adequate to meet the straightedge and other riding-quality requirements specified.
 Accomplish screeding by oscillating screeds, an extrusion device, or a
 combination of both.
 If necessary, in order to produce a pavement of the required cross-section and
 meeting the surface requirements, equip the slip-form paver with traveling side forms of
 sufficient dimension and strength and of proper shape to support the concrete laterally for a
 sufficient length of time during placing and finishing.
 If using trailing forms, provide forms that are rigidly supported laterally.
 Equip the slip-form paver with automatic guidance and grade controls which
 operate by sensing from a taut line set true to line and grade. Erect and maintain the taut line.
 Automatic grade controls are not required on the paver when the tracks of the
 slip-form paver are operating on previously placed concrete pavement. The Engineer may waive
 the use of automatic grade controls on the paver when the entire width of the tracks of the slipform paver are operating on a subgrade which has been consistently trimmed to a tolerance of
 1/8 inch above or below true grade as established by the taut line set for that purpose.
 350-3.3 Vibratory Units: Consolidate the concrete for the full width of the strip being
 placed with either surface pan type or internal type vibrators. Use a vibration method with
 sufficient intensity and duration to ensure complete consolidation of the concrete without causing
 segregation of the materials.
 For the surface vibrators, use a frequency of not less than 3,500 impulses per
 minute. For internal type vibrators, use a frequency of not less than 5,000 impulses per minute
 for tube vibrators and not less than 7,000 impulses per minute for spud vibrators. When using
 spud-type internal vibrators adjacent to forms, either hand-operated or attached to spreaders or
 finishing machines, use a frequency of not less than 3,500 impulses per minute. Measure and
 record the frequency of internal vibrators in plastic concrete and submit data to the Engineer.
 Mount spud vibrators such that the free tip trails, and space spud vibrators at a maximum interval
 of 30 inches.
 Provide an amplitude of vibration with spud vibrators that is sufficient for the
 vibration to be perceptible on the surface of the concrete along the entire width of the strip being
 placed. Measure and record the actual frequency of vibrations and submit data to the Engineer.
 Control all vibration by the forward movement of the spreader or finishing machine so that
 vibration automatically ceases when stopping the forward movement of the spreader.
 350-3.4 Device for Application of Membrane Curing Compound: Provide equipment
 for applying membrane curing compound that is self-propelled and capable of uniformly
 applying the curing compound at the specified rate. Use equipment that continuously stirs the
 curing compound, by effective mechanical means, and that thoroughly atomizes the curing
 compound during the spraying operation so that the finished surface of the fresh concrete will
 not be marred. Cover the entire surface of the pavement and, with slip-form type paving, the
 vertical faces by a single pass of the machine. Only use spray nozzles that are equipped with
 appropriate wind guards to ensure uniform application.
 Power-spray equipment may be used to apply curing compound to areas where it
 is impracticable to operate the self-propelled equipment.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 346
 
 350-3.5 Equipment for Paving Small or Narrow Areas: For variable width areas, other
 than mainline, ramps, and shoulders, the Engineer will not require the full paving train as
 specified for the standard run of paving. Use such equipment that is approved by the Engineer.
 350-3.6 Hand Finishing Tools: Provide straightedges that have a blade length of 10 feet.
 Use long-handled floats that have flat blades, approximately 4 feet long by 5 to 8 inches wide,
 and that are designed so as to remain straight and true. Use a handle for both types of tool with a
 length that exceeds 1/2 the width of the strip being placed by 3 feet.
 350-4 Subgrade Preparation.
 Keep construction of the subgrade completed for a distance of at least 500 feet ahead of
 the paving operation. Maintain the finished subgrade in a smooth, compact condition, and restore
 any areas which are disturbed prior to placing the concrete. Do not place concrete on a frozen
 subgrade.
 Ensure that the subgrade is within two percent of the optimum moisture content while
 placing the concrete. Uniformly apply water ahead of the paving operations, as directed by the
 Engineer.
 Do not allow vehicles to travel on the prepared subgrade between the subgrade trimming
 machine and the paving operations unless specifically authorized.
 Accurately trim the subgrade to the required elevation. Trim high areas to proper
 elevation. Fill low areas with suitable material, compacted to the specified density, or with
 concrete placed integrally with the pavement. When slip-form paving, include in the width to be
 trimmed the areas on which the tracks of the paver will operate.
 Remove material planed from the subgrade before placing any concrete. The Engineer
 may waive the use of the planer for small or isolated areas or any areas where its use would be
 impracticable.
 350-5 Setting Forms.
 350-5.1 General: Accurately set the forms to line and grade and such that they rest
 firmly, throughout their entire length, upon the subgrade surface. Join forms neatly and tightly,
 and brace them to resist the pressure of the equipment operating on the forms. Obtain the
 Engineer’s approval of the alignment and grade of all forms before and immediately prior to the
 placing of concrete.
 Fill any subgrade that is below the established grade at the form line to grade with
 granular material, in lifts of 1/2 inch or less, for a distance of 18 inches on each side of the
 pavement edge, and thoroughly compact the material. As an exception, when placing forms on a
 cement-treated subgrade, the Contractor may use wedging, provided that the wedging system
 used adequately supports the forms without causing detrimental deflection under the weight of
 the paving equipment.
 350-5.2 Tamping: When placing forms on other than a cement-treated subgrade,
 adequately tamp the materials below and adjacent to the forms with form-tamping machines.
 350-5.3 Advance Preparation of Forms: Keep sufficient forms on hand at all times, and
 set forms so that at least 500 feet of forms on each side of the roadway will be accurately set, and
 maintained true to line and grade, in advance of the point where concrete is being placed.
 Provide sufficient forms so that it is not necessary to remove them in less than 12 hours after
 placing the concrete.

 350-5.4 Cleaning Forms: Thoroughly clean the forms after each use and before placing
 concrete against them. Apply a release agent in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 recommendations.
 350-6 Protection from Weather.
 Meet the requirements of 400-7.1 when placing concrete. When rain appears imminent,
 stop all paving operations, and cover the surface of the unhardened concrete with the protective
 covering.
 350-7 Placement of Reinforcement.
 350-7.1 General: Where the Plans call for reinforced concrete pavement, place the steel
 reinforcement in the pavement slab in accordance with the details shown in the Plans. At the
 time of the concrete placement, ensure that the reinforcing steel is free from any of the following
 which could impair bonding of the steel with the concrete: dirt, oil, paint, grease, mill scale, and
 any loose or thick rust. Place the reinforcement as provided below.
 350-7.2 Welded Wire Reinforcement: Place welded wire reinforcement at right angles
 to the centerline of the pavement and accurately to the position and location shown in the Plans.
 Lap adjacent sheets of welded wire reinforcement not less than 6 inches. Make the laps only in
 the longitudinal members.
 350-7.3 Bars: Place bar reinforcement as shown in the Plans. Securely wire together
 transverse and longitudinal bars at their intersections. Lap splices not less than 20 times the
 nominal diameter of the bar, and only in the longitudinal members.
 350-8 Placing Concrete.
 350-8.1 Distribution: Distribute the concrete on the subgrade to such depth that, when it
 is consolidated and finished, the slab thickness required by the Plans will be obtained at all
 points. The surface will at no point be below the grade specified for the finished surface. Place
 the concrete on the subgrade in a manner which will require as little rehandling as possible.
 Place concrete as near to expansion and contraction joint assemblies as possible
 without disturbing them. Ensure that workers do not walk in the freshly placed concrete with
 their boots or shoes coated with earth or other deleterious substances.
 350-8.2 Use of Spreader: Place concrete on the subgrade by an approved spreading
 device. Do not place concrete from the discharge bucket or hopper onto an assembly without
 centering the bucket or hopper directly over the assembly.
 A spreader is not required in areas where the width of slab varies, intersections,
 and small or isolated areas where it would be impractical to use a spreader. Perform the
 necessary hand spreading with shovels (not with rakes or hoes).
 350-8.3 Placement Widths: The Contractor may construct the pavement either in lanes
 as determined by the longitudinal joints shown in the Plans, or for the full width in one
 operation. Construct the pavement to the full width of the lane or slab in a single construction
 operation. When constructing pavement in separate lanes, do not deviate the junction line from
 the true line shown in the Plans by more than 1/2 inch at any point. Tool the edges of the
 junction to the radius shown in the Plans.
 When constructing pavement in separate lanes, place the lanes adjacent to the low
 edge of the pavement, as shown on the typical section, first.
 350-8.4 Consolidation Along Forms and Joints: Thoroughly consolidate concrete
 against and along the faces of all forms, and along the full length on both sides of all joint

 348
 
 assemblies, by means of hand-operated, spud-type vibrators. Do not allow vibrators to come in
 contact with a joint assembly, reinforcement, the subgrade or a side form.
 350-8.5 Slip-Form Paver: When placing concrete with a slip-form paver, operate the
 paver with a continuous forward movement. If for any reason it is necessary to stop the forward
 movement of the paver, immediately stop operation of the vibrating or tamping elements. Do not
 apply tractive force to the paving machine except that which is controlled from the machine.
 In case of an emergency, have available for use at the project site at least 100 feet
 of forms.
 Do not insert steel tie-bars into the unsupported side of the freshly formed slab.
 The Contractor may place tie-bars into position prior to extrusion from the paver by insertion
 through the forms, by insertion through a temporary support form placed against the form slab,
 or by other means approved by the Engineer. Use a method that results in placement of the tiebars at the specified locations with no damage or disruption of the concrete.
 350-9 Striking-off, Consolidating, and Finishing Concrete.
 350-9.1 General Requirements: Immediately after placing the concrete, strike-off,
 consolidate, and finish it to produce a finished pavement in accordance with the cross-section,
 width, and surface finish required by the Contract Documents. Perform the sequence of
 operations as follows: strike-off; vibratory consolidation; screeding; floating; removal of
 laitance; straightedging; and final surface finish. Except as specified, perform strike-off,
 consolidation, screeding, and floating by the machine method.
 Use equipment that is fully and accurately adjustable to produce a pavement
 meeting project requirements. Use equipment that is capable of operating in a consistent and
 smooth manner under all conditions of use.
 As soon as possible after screeding while the concrete is plastic, correct all flaws
 such as cavities, blemishes, marks, or scratches that will not be removed by planing.
 Provide a concrete surface true to grade, cross slope and superelevation, and free
 of irregularities. If the Engineer permits adding water to assist the finishing operations, apply
 water as a fog spray by means of approved spray equipment.
 350-9.2 Machine Method: Operate the machine over each area of pavement as few times
 and at such intervals as is necessary to give proper consolidation and to leave a surface of
 uniform texture. Avoid excessive operation over a particular area.
 Perform strike-off, consolidation, and finishing in a manner such as to avoid
 damage to, or misalignment of, joint assemblies, reinforcing steel, dowels, and other embedded
 items. Smooth the surface of the concrete and remove the excess mortar from the surface. Carry
 a small amount of mortar ahead of the float device as it moves on the surface of the concrete.
 Operate the machine over the surface of the concrete as many times as required to obtain an
 acceptable surface, meeting the requirements specified herein. Discard excess mortar beyond the
 edge of the slab.
 350-9.3 Hand Methods:
 350-9.3.1 Conditions under which Allowed: Use hand methods in areas of
 narrow width or irregular dimensions, where operation of mechanical equipment is
 impracticable.
 350-9.3.2 Strike-off and Screeding: Use a portable screed of an approved
 design, constructed either of metal or of other suitable material shod with metal, to strike-off and
 screed the concrete. Use a screed that is sufficiently rigid to retain its shape and is at least 2 feet
 longer than the maximum width of the strip to be screeded.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 349
 
 350-9.3.3 Consolidation: Use hand-operated spud-type vibrators to consolidate.
 350-9.3.4 Floating: Use long-handled floats to float the concrete. Take the
 necessary care to avoid creating depressions or ridges during this operation.
 350-9.4 Work Bridges: Provide work bridges or other devices necessary for access to
 the pavement surface for the purpose of inspection, finishing, straightedging, and performing
 corrective work.
 350-10 Final Finish.
 350-10.1 Finishing: As the water sheen disappears from the surface of the pavement and
 just before the concrete achieves its initial set, drag a seamless length of damp burlap that
 extends the full width of the strip of the constructed pavement, longitudinally along the surface
 to produce a uniform gritty texture.
 Use a burlap drag that consists of two layers of medium weight burlap with the
 trailing edge of the lower layer extending approximately 2 inches behind the upper layer.
 Support the burlap drag in a manner so that a length of at least 3 feet of burlap is in contact with
 the pavement.
 Except in areas where using hand methods to construct the pavement, support the
 lead end of the burlap drag by a traveling bridge. Maintain the drag clean and free from
 encrusted mortar. Replace the burlap with new material as necessary.
 350-10.2 Edging: After applying the final finish, but before the concrete has become
 nonplastic, carefully round the edges to a 1/4 inch radius on each side of transverse expansion
 joints and construction joints and along any structure extending into the pavement. Produce a
 well-defined and continuous radius, and obtain a smooth, dense mortar finish. Completely
 remove all concrete from the top of the joint filler.
 Check all joints with a straightedge before the concrete has become nonplastic,
 and, if one side of the joint is higher than the other or the entire joint is higher or lower than the
 adjacent slabs, make corrections as necessary.
 350-11 Curing.
 350-11.1 General: After completing the finishing operations and as soon as the concrete
 has hardened sufficiently to not mar the surface, cover and cure the entire surface and, when the
 slip-form method is used, cover and cure the edges of the newly placed concrete in accordance
 with one or more of the methods described below. In cases where curing requires the use of
 water, ensure that curing has prior right to use all water supplies. If the Contractor fails to
 provide sufficient curing materials to adequately cure the concrete in place in a timely manner,
 that portion of the concrete pavement section addressed in the Quality Control Plan (QCP) will
 be suspended. Do not leave the concrete exposed for a period in excess of 30 minutes between
 stages of curing or during the curing period.
 Continuously cure the freshly placed concrete for a period of 72 hours, exclusive
 of any periods when the temperature of the surface of the concrete falls below 50ºF.
 350-11.2 White-Pigmented Curing Compound: Under this method, uniformly apply
 white-pigmented curing compound to the surfaces to be cured, in a single coat, continuous film,
 at the minimum rate of 1 gallon to every 200 ft2, by a mechanical sprayer.
 At the time of use, thoroughly mix the compound in accordance with the
 manufacturer’s recommendation.
 Do not apply curing compound during periods of rainfall. Do not apply curing
 compound to the inside faces of joints to be sealed. Should the film become damaged from any

 350
 
 cause within the required curing period, repair the damaged portions immediately with additional
 compound. If using side forms, upon their removal, immediately coat the sides of the slabs
 exposed to provide a curing treatment equal to that provided for the surface.
 350-11.3 Burlap Mats: Thoroughly saturate the mats with water before placing them.
 Use mats of such dimensions that as laid they extend to at least 2 feet beyond the edges of the
 strip of concrete placed. Place and weigh down the mats throughout the curing period to ensure
 contact with the surface being cured. Maintain the mats fully moist and in position for the entire
 portion of the required curing period.
 350-11.4 Removal of Forms: Do not remove forms from freshly placed concrete for at
 least 12 hours after placement. Remove forms carefully so as to avoid damage to the pavement.
 After removing the forms, immediately cure the sides of the slab in the same manner as the
 surface of the pavement.
 350-12 Joints.
 350-12.1 General: Construct joints at the locations and in accordance with the details
 shown in Standard Plans, Indexes 350-001 and 370-001 and the Contract Documents.
 350-12.2 Longitudinal Joints:
 350-12.2.1 Longitudinal Construction Joints: Where the pavement is poured in
 strips less than the full width of the pavement, construct longitudinal construction joints in
 accordance with the details shown in the Plans.
 350-12.2.2 Longitudinal Lane-tie Joints: Construct longitudinal lane-tie joints
 within the limits of a strip of pavement, in accordance with the details shown in the Plans.
 Construct the plane of weakness by sawing a groove in the hardened concrete. Complete sawing
 as soon as possible but in no case longer than 72 hours after placing the concrete.
 350-12.2.3 Tie Bars and Bolt Assemblies: Place deformed steel tie bars or tie
 bolt assemblies at the required depth, parallel to the finished surface, at right angles to the joint
 and at the uniform spacing specified or required in the Plans. Place them in the plastic concrete
 using approved equipment, or rigidly support them on the subgrade by approved devices capable
 of preventing displacement prior to placing of the concrete. Do not paint or coat the bars with
 any material before placing them in the concrete.
 If placing tie bars along a longitudinal construction joint using the method
 of inserting bars with a 90 degree bend in the edge of the plastic concrete and after the concrete
 hardens straightening these bars, use Grade 40 reinforcing steel for such tie bars. Replace any bar
 broken while being straightened in an approved manner.
 350-12.3 Transverse Joints:
 350-12.3.1 Transverse Construction Joints: Construct transverse construction
 joints at the end of all pours and at other locations where the paving operations are stopped for as
 long as 30 minutes. Do not place construction joints, however, within 10 feet of any other
 transverse joint or within 10 feet of either end of a section of pavement. If sufficient concrete has
 not been placed to form a slab at least 10 feet long, remove the excess concrete, back to the last
 preceding joint. Form the joints by placing a wood or metal bulkhead accurately and securely in
 place, in a plane perpendicular to the profile and centerline of the pavement. Install dowel bars at
 the construction joints. Saw or form construction joints, in a manner similar to contraction joints,
 so that a groove will be formed for holding the joint sealing compound.
 350-12.3.2 Transverse Contraction Joints: Construct transverse contraction
 joints at the interval indicated in the Plans consisting of planes of weakness created by sawing a
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 351
 
 groove in the surface of the hardened concrete. Place the groove perpendicular to the surface of
 the pavement. Install load transfer devices in transverse contraction joints.
 Ensure that the sawing equipment does not damage the pavement, and saw
 the transverse contraction joints as soon as the pavement has hardened to the degree that tearing
 and raveling are not excessive and before uncontrolled shrinkage cracking begins.
 Accomplish the joint sawing in two steps. Make the initial cut 1/8 inch
 wide by a depth at least 1/3 of the pavement thickness and as soon as possible but in no case
 longer than 12 hours after placing the concrete. Make a second saw cut, to provide the joint
 dimensions indicated in the Plans, just prior to sealing the joint.
 In cases where a strip of pavement is being placed immediately adjacent to
 a previously constructed strip of pavement, construct transverse contraction joints using extreme
 care to time sawing so as to prevent uncontrolled cracks.
 Repair any uncontrolled cracks at no expense to the Department by
 removing and replacing the pavement across the full width of all affected lanes or shoulders and
 to the nearest transverse joint in each direction.
 After the final sawing, clean the joint, install the bond breaker, and seal
 the joint.
 350-12.3.3 Transverse Expansion Joints: Form transverse expansion joints
 using preformed joint filler, and provide them with dowel load transfer, in accordance with the
 details shown on the Standard Plans, or in the Plans.
 Form the joints during the placing of the concrete, by securely staking a
 metal bulkhead accurately in place at the joint location or by other methods which will securely
 brace and support the joint filler. Where using approved devices to keep the expansion joint filler
 and dowels securely in place, the Engineer will not require a bulkhead. Protect all transverse
 expansion joints at the bottom and side edges by a sheet metal strip as specified in 931-2.1 and as
 shown in the Contract Documents.
 Cut the filler to the crown and shape of the slab cross-section and
 extended it to the subgrade. After installation, ensure that the top is not less than 1 inch, and not
 more than 1.25 inches, below the finished surface. Furnish the joint filler in lengths not less than
 the lane widths being poured, except that the Engineer will not require lengths greater than
 12 feet. Where more than one section is allowed and used in a joint, securely lace or clip the
 sections together.
 Place the filler normal to the pavement surface. Stake the assembly into
 position in such a way as to hold the assembly securely in position throughout construction.
 Ensure that the assembly is true to the line prescribed, subject to a tolerance of 1/4 inch in the
 width of the slab. Obtain the Engineer’s approval of the assembly and its installation before
 placing any concrete against it. Obtain the Engineer’s approval of the cross-section and length of
 the stakes.
 When laying the pavement in partial width slabs, place transverse joints in
 the succeeding slab in line with the like joints in the first slab. In the case of widening existing
 pavement, place transverse joints in line with like joints in the existing pavement or as otherwise
 shown in the Plans.
 350-12.4 Load-Transfer Devices: Provide dowel load-transfer devices in all transverse
 joints. Firmly hold dowel bars in a position parallel to the surface and the centerline of the slab,
 by approved steel supports and spacers of a type shown in the Plans. The Engineer may approve
 the use of dowel bar supports or assemblies other than those specifically detailed in the Plans.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 352
 
 Allow the dowels to be free to move in one slab as the concrete contracts and expands. Paint
 each dowel with one coat of zinc rich primer or red oxide alkyd based primer meeting the
 requirements of SSPC Paint 25 Type I or Type II. Wait a minimum of 7 days before coating onehalf of the dowel with a petroleum based lubricant grease to inhibit bonding to the concrete.
 Provide a cap for the free end of expansion joint dowels.
 Position each dowel such that its final deviation from parallel to the surface of the
 pavement and parallel to the longitudinal centerline of the pavement does not exceed 1/2 inch.
 Position each dowel such that its final deviation from being centered on the joint does not exceed
 2 inches. Position each dowel such that at no point in its length does it deviate from the surface
 of the pavement as shown in the Plans in excess of 1 inch. Confirm the position of dowel bars by
 suitable means acceptable to the Engineer, which may include non-destructive testing methods.
 350-12.5 Expansion Joints Around Structures:
 350-12.5.1 Expansion Joints at Manholes, Meter Boxes and other
 Projections: Form expansion joints by placing premolded expansion joint material about all
 structures and features projecting through, into or against the pavement. Ensure that such joints
 are 1/2 inch in width.
 350-12.5.2 Bridge Approach Expansion Joints: Construct in accordance with
 Standard Plans, Index 370-001.
 350-12.6 Cleaning Joints and Cracks:
 350-12.6.1 Cleaning Joints in New Pavement:
 350-12.6.1.1 Sawed Joints: Immediately after sawing the joints which
 require sealing, completely remove the resulting slurry from the joint and the immediate area by
 flushing with a jet of water under pressure and by using other tools as necessary.
 After flushing, blow out the joints with compressed air. After the
 flushed joints have dried, sandblast the joint faces to thoroughly remove all foreign material.
 Perform sandblasting in two passes, once for each face.
 Patch all spalled edges with an epoxy compound.
 Immediately prior to joint seal installation, clean the joints using
 compressed air to remove all traces of debris and dust within and on the joint surfaces.
 350-12.6.1.2 Non-Sawed Joints: Thoroughly clean joints which require
 sealing of all foreign material for the full depth of the seal installation.
 With the exception of slurry removal due to sawing, meet the
 cleaning requirements as specified for sawed joints.
 350-12.6.2 Cleaning Joints in Existing Pavement: Remove all existing jointsealing material and foreign material for the full depth of the new joint seal by sawing, wire
 brushing, sandblasting, or other methods approved by the Engineer.
 Remove any existing sealant or parting strip material below the tape or
 backer rod bond breaker and replace it with additional bond breaker. When conditions require
 removal and replacement with additional bond breaker below the new joint seal, obtain the
 Engineer’s approval of the type of bond breaker and its installation procedure. Perform cleaning
 by any method or combination of methods, as detailed in the Plans.
 Flush the joint with a pressurized jet of water, and use other tools as
 necessary, to remove loose remnants and debris.
 After flushing, blow out the joints with compressed air. After the flushed
 joints have dried, sandblast the joint faces to thoroughly remove all foreign material. Perform
 sandblasting in two passes, once for each face.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 353
 
 Patch all spalled edges with an epoxy compound.
 Immediately prior to joint seal installation, clean the joints using
 compressed air to remove all traces of debris and dust within and on the joint surfaces.
 350-12.6.3 Cleaning Random Cracks in Existing Pavement: Do not begin
 cleaning random cracks in existing pavement until all other concrete pavement repairs have
 progressed to the point where those operations will not adversely affect the installation of the
 new seal.
 Cut the random cracks to be repaired and sealed into grooved joints to the
 depth and width detailed in the Plans. Clean the joints as specified in 350-12.6.2.
 350-12.7 Sealing Joints and Cracks: Seal joints in new pavement before allowing any
 traffic or construction equipment on the pavement. Complete sealing within 72 hours (weather
 permitting) of sawing. If traffic is going to be on the pavement prior to any grinding, then seal
 the joints with a temporary material acceptable to the Engineer.
 When using silicone and non-silicone sealants in the transverse and longitudinal
 joints, respectively, always use the silicone sealants first to prevent contamination at the
 intersection of the joint faces. Remove non-silicone sealant 1 foot in each direction from the
 transverse joints, and replace it with silicone sealant.
 Use equipment equipped with nozzles that discharge the sealant at the bottom of
 the groove. Ensure that the apparatus develops sufficient pressure to extrude the joint sealer from
 the nozzles satisfactorily and to control the rate of application so as to completely fill the joint to
 within 1/4 inch of the surface of the pavement without spillage. Use an apparatus so constructed
 that it maintains the proper temperature of the sealing material within the manufacturer’s
 recommendation.
 350-12.7.1 Hot-Poured Type Sealant: When the Plans require hot poured sealant
 for specific joints, fill the joint thoroughly, without trapping air, ensuring the sealant is recessed
 below the pavement surface as required, and control the pouring rate to avoid spilling of sealant
 onto the adjacent pavement surface. If any spilling of sealant occurs, immediately remove and
 clean the entire surplus amount from the pavement surface. Place poured material when the
 ambient air temperature is 50ºF or greater.
 Use an indirect heating or double boiler type heating kettle that uses oil as
 a heat transfer medium, for hot poured sealer. Use a heating kettle that has a thermostatically
 controlled heat source, a built-in automatic agitator, and thermometers installed to indicate both
 the temperature of the melted sealing material and that of the oil bath.
 350-12.7.2 Low Modulus Silicone Sealant: Use low modulus silicone sealant of
 either Type A (non-self-leveling silicone sealant), or Type B and/or Type C (self-leveling
 silicone sealant). Because Type A will not flow into the proper shape under its own weight,
 install and tool it so that the sealant is in firm contact with the joint faces and is formed into the
 appropriate shape as specified. Types B and C will normally flow into the proper shape without
 tooling. Exercise care to provide the required depth of recess above the sealant surface and below
 the pavement surface. Install the silicone sealant at temperatures above 40ºF.
 350-13 Surface Requirements.
 Produce, by grinding in accordance with Section 352, a pavement surface that is true to
 grade and uniform in appearance with a longitudinal line type texture.

 350-14 Thickness Determinations.
 350-14.1 General: After completing the concrete pavement, including any corrective
 work to meet ride requirement, determine the thickness by one of following methods. The
 Engineer will select the locations for testing and make the determination of thickness. Sample
 locations will be taken at various points on the cross-section so that each test represents an area
 not exceeding 2,500 yd2. Provide traffic control, non-destructive equipment, coring equipment,
 and operator to obtain the samples.
 350-14.1.1 Core Borings: To determine the actual thickness, drill cores from the
 pavement and measure thickness in accordance with ASTM C174. Replace the portions of the
 pavement removed by the borings at no expense to the Department.
 350-14.1.2 Non-destructive Testing: For a determination using the impact-echo
 method, measure the thickness of the pavement in accordance with ASTM C1383. The initial
 thickness measurement will be validated by having a core boring taken at that location in
 compliance with 350-14.1.1. If the results from the impact-echo test vary by plus or minus
 0.15 inches from the core boring, then the non-destructive test method cannot be used on the
 pavement. In such case, the core boring will be used for acceptance of that LOT of concrete. The
 Engineer has the option to verify the accuracy of the results at any time.
 350-14.2 Method of Calculating Average Thickness: The Department will determine
 the average thickness of the pavement by using the following method of calculation:
 1. The Department will not take into account in the calculation, any areas of
 pavement which are left in place, but for which no payment will be made.
 2. When the thickness of the pavement is more than 1/2 inch greater than the
 specified thickness, the Department will consider it in the calculation as the specified thickness
 plus 1/2 inch.
 3. The Department will calculate the average thickness for the entire job as a unit.
 350-15 Deficient Thickness.
 350-15.1 General: The Department will not pay for any pavement which is more than
 1/2 inch less than the specified thickness. When the pavement contains no longitudinal
 construction joint, the Department will not pay for the area of such pavement that is the product
 of the full width of the strip placed as a unit times the sum of the distances each way from the
 short core or cores to the cores on each side which show measurements within the tolerance
 limits. When the pavement contains longitudinal construction joints, for the width, the
 Department will use the width between longitudinal construction joint and the edge of pavement.
 350-15.2 Deficient Pavement Requiring Removal: The Engineer will evaluate areas of
 pavement found deficient in thickness by more than 1/2 inch and if, in his judgment, the
 deficiency is enough to seriously impair the anticipated service life of the pavement, remove
 such areas and replace them with concrete of the thickness shown in the Plans. The Department
 will not pay for the area of pavement removed or for the materials or labor involved in its
 removal. When removing a section of pavement, remove the full length between transverse
 joints.
 350-15.3 Deficient Pavement Left in Place: If the Engineer determines that the
 deficiency will not seriously impair the anticipated service life of the pavement, the pavement
 may be left in place, at no compensation.
 350-15.4 Additional Borings: If the number of cores taken is not sufficient to indicate
 the thickness of the pavement, additional boring locations may be requested, with prior approval
 from the Engineer at no additional cost to the Department.

 350-16 Opening Pavement to Traffic.
 Construct an earth berm along each edge of the pavement within 36 hours of finishing
 any newly placed concrete pavement. Build the berm to the full height of the pavement and at
 least 18 inches wide, and sufficiently compacted to prevent underwash of the pavement.
 Maintain the berm until the final shoulders are complete.
 Except as provided below, keep the pavement closed to traffic for a minimum period of
 14 calendar days after placement of the concrete. The Engineer may permit opening of a section
 of pavement to traffic at an earlier time provided that representative test cylinders, made in
 accordance with ASTM C31 and tested in accordance with ASTM C39, indicate a compressive
 strength of at least 2200 psi. Cure these test cylinders in a manner identical to the corresponding
 section of pavement.
 Protect the pavement from all traffic, including construction operations, until the
 specified period of time has elapsed. Protect the pavement from ambient temperatures below
 50°F for the calendar days or until the required compressive strength has been attained.
 350-17 Method of Measurement.
 350-17.1 Concrete Pavement: The quantities to be paid for will be the plan quantity, in
 square yards, of plain cement concrete pavement and of reinforced cement concrete pavement,
 omitting any areas not allowed for payment under the provisions of 350-15.3 and adjusted for
 average thickness as provided herein.
 For purposes of payment, the average thickness of pavement will determine the
 final pay quantities for this pavement as follows:
 The area of pavement represented by the difference between the calculated
 average thickness and the specified thickness will be converted into equivalent square yards of
 specified thickness pavement, and the quantity thereby obtained will be added to, or deducted
 from, the quantity of pavement to be paid for, subject to the limitation that the maximum average
 of over-thickness permitted in the adjustment of the quantity of pavement to be paid for will be
 1/4 inch.
 Where the Plans call for cement concrete pavement that is to be covered with
 asphalt concrete surface course, payment will be made for the total thickness of the combination
 as plain cement concrete pavement. In such cases, price and payment will also include all costs
 of the asphalt concrete surface course constructed in accordance with Section 334.
 Reinforcing steel, placed and accepted, will be measured and paid for as provided
 in Section 415.
 350-17.2 Joints and Cracks: For cleaning and sealing joints in new or existing concrete
 pavement, the quantity to be paid will be the length in feet, as determined by field measurement
 along the joints.
 For cleaning and sealing random cracks in existing concrete pavement, the
 quantity to be paid will be the length in feet, as determined by field measurement along the
 cracks.
 350-17.3 Bridge Approach Expansion Joint: The quantity to be paid for will be plan
 quantity, in feet of bridge approach expansion joint installed in accordance with Standard Plans,
 Index 370-001, calculated across the pavement at right angles to the centerline of the roadway

 SECTION 352
 GRINDING CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 352-1 Description.
 Grind existing concrete pavement in the areas designated on the Plans.
 Grind new concrete pavement the full width of the travel lanes. Do not grind shoulders or
 roundabout aprons unless indicated in the Plans or required to promote drainage.
 352-2 Equipment.
 Provide a power driven self-propelled machine that is specifically designed to grind
 portland cement concrete pavement with diamond-impregnated grinding blades. Provide,
 operate, and maintain in working condition all necessary equipment to ensure performance of the
 work in the allotted time. Use equipment of the size, shape, and dimensions that does not restrict
 the movement of traffic in areas outside the designated limits of construction. The equipment
 will be of a size that can cut or plane at least 3 feet wide or as approved by the Engineer. Use
 equipment that is capable of grinding specified surfaces without causing spalls at cracks, joints,
 or other locations. The equipment will be capable of removing any slurry or residue resulting
 from the grinding operation.
 352-3 Construction Methods.
 Schedule and proceed with the construction operation in a manner that produces a
 uniform finished surface. Grind in a manner that eliminates joint or crack faults while providing
 positive lateral drainage by maintaining a constant cross-slope between grinding extremities in
 each lane. Grind transition, auxiliary or ramp lane as required from the mainline edge to provide
 positive drainage and an acceptable riding surface.
 Grind parallel to the centerline until the pavement surfaces of adjacent sides of transverse
 joints and cracks are in the same plane. Grind the concrete pavement to eliminate the faulting at
 joints and cracks, maintain the overall smoothness within the limits specified, and texture over
 the majority of the pavement surface. Take all necessary precautions to minimize the number of
 minor depressions in the first place and only resolve to grind such areas if necessary. Continue
 grinding if accumulated total areas of minor depressions exceed 30% of the total area of a
 0.1 mile section or if directed by the Engineer. Maintain the cross slope of the pavement as
 shown in the Plans.
 Establish and obtain the Engineer’s approval for a means to continuously remove
 grinding residue.
 Remove solid residue from pavement surfaces before traffic action or wind blows such
 residue. Do not allow residue to flow across lanes or shoulders used by public traffic or into
 gutters or other drainage facilities. Do not allow the discharge of any residue runoff into adjacent
 rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, or other bodies of water.
 352-4 Final Surface Finish.
 After the curing period, use a grinding process that produces a pavement surface that is
 true to grade and uniform in appearance with a longitudinal line type texture. Provide a line type
 texture that contains parallel longitudinal corrugations that present a narrow ridge with a
 corduroy type appearance. Provide a surface finish with the peaks of the ridges approximately
 1/32 inch higher than the bottoms of the grooves and with approximately 60 evenly spaced
 grooves per foot.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 358
 
 Grind to produce areas of uniform and neat surface appearance, beginning and ending at
 lines perpendicular to the pavement centerline.
 352-5 Acceptance Testing for Surface Tolerance.
 Test the pavement surface for smoothness with a 10 foot long straightedge, a 10 foot long
 rolling straightedge, or a California Type Profilograph while the Engineer observes the
 operations as described below. For pavement surfaces not meeting the smoothness requirements,
 provide corrective work and retesting to ensure conformity approved by the Engineer.
 1. Testing with a 10 foot straightedge: Use this straightedge for longitudinal
 profiling, parallel to centerline, within 15 feet of a bridge approach or existing pavement which
 is being joined. Use it for all transverse profiling of cross slopes, approaches, and as otherwise
 directed with respect to (2) or (3) below.
 Furnish and operate a 10 foot straightedge. When portland cement
 concrete pavement abuts bridge approaches or pavement not under this Contract, ensure that the
 longitudinal slope deviations of the finished pavement do not exceed 1/8 inch in 10 foot length.
 Produce transverse slope deviations of the finished pavement that do not
 exceed 1/8 inch with the straightedge laid in a direction perpendicular to the centerline.
 2. Testing with a 10 foot rolling straightedge: Use this straightedge for
 longitudinal profiling of short pavement sections up to 250 feet long, including mainline and
 non-mainline sections on tangent sections and on horizontal curves with a centerline radius of
 curve less than 1,000 feet and the pavement within the superelevation transition of such curves,
 turn lanes, ramps, tapers, and other non-mainline pavements as directed.
 Furnish and operate the straightedge. Provide and operate a 10 foot rolling
 straightedge of a design acceptable to the Engineer, able to accurately measure surface
 irregularities exceeding 1/8 inch in a 10 foot effective length of the straightedge.
 When tested with a straightedge, ensure that the finished pavement profile
 provides a uniform surface with no deviation greater than 1/8 inch in a 10 foot length. Perform
 the profiling in lines parallel to the centerline, at not more than 4 foot transversal spacing, and
 extending across the transverse joints.
 The Contractor may confine checking through traffic lanes with the
 straightedge to joints and obvious irregularities as directed.
 3. Testing With A California Type Profilograph:
 a. General: Use the profilograph on all longitudinal profiling of mainline
 full width pavement lanes longer than 250 feet and as otherwise directed.
 The following terms are defined:
 1. Profilograph: A longitudinal profile testing apparatus used to
 measure a pavement’s surface profile deviations.
 2. Profile Trace or Profilogram: A surface profile record generated
 along the individual wheel paths using a profilograph. Such a record is analyzed to determine the
 rate of roughness (or smoothness) and to identify changes in the longitudinal pavement surface
 elevation that exceed a specified threshold along the pavement length traversed by the
 profilograph.
 3. Profile Index (PI): A profile measurement is a series of numbers
 representing elevation relative to a specified reference. A Profile Index (PI) is a summary value
 calculated from these numbers above and below a blanking band over a specified length of
 pavement.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 359
 
 4. Blanking Band: A band of 0.2 inch uniform height with its
 longitudinal center positioned optimally between the highs and the lows of the profilogram
 depicting at least 100 ft of pavement.
 b. Equipment: Furnish, calibrate, and operate a California Type
 Profilograph device in accordance with FM 5-558E. The electronic model of a California Type
 Profilograph performs computerized data analysis, and is manufactured by Cox and Sons, Inc. of
 Colfax, California - Model CS 8200 or better.
 c. Surface Test: Produce a riding surface meeting the requirements of
 FM 5-558E and having a Profile Index meeting the requirements herein. Start and terminate the
 profile 15 feet from each bridge approach or existing pavement, which is being joined.
 Take at least two pavement profile traces with bump option turned
 on. Locate the position of the profiles in the traffic wheel paths. Take the profiles in the direction
 of the traffic and parallel to and approximately 3 feet from the outside edges of each traffic lane.
 The Contractor may take additional profiles to define the limits of an out-of-tolerance surface
 variation.
 Upon completion of each day’s testing, submit the profilograms to
 the Engineer for review to determine the pavement section in compliance with these
 requirements. The Engineer will retain those profilograms meeting these requirements. The
 Engineer will return profilograms with deficiencies to the Contractor for use to correct section
 deficiencies. The Engineer will retain the corrected profilograms, along with the deficient
 profilograms, for comparison purposes of the circumstances between the two profilograms.
 Ensure that pavement tested meets the Profile Index requirements
 and is applicable to the profilogram for each profile trace:
 1. Ensure that pavement on tangent alignment and
 horizontal curves having a centerline radius of curve 2,000 feet or more has a Profile Index of
 5 inches per mile or less.
 2. Ensure that pavement on horizontal curves having a
 centerline radius of curve 1,000 feet or more but less than 2,000 feet and pavement within the
 superelevation transition of such curves has a Profile Index of 7 inches per mile or less.
 3. Ensure that the pavement riding surfaces have all
 deviations in excess of 0.3 inch in 25 feet removed.
 The Engineer will evaluate the pavement in 0.1 mile consecutive
 sections. Grind all areas represented by individual points having deviations in excess of 0.3 inch
 in 25 feet or less pavement length, until such points do not exceed 0.3 inch.
 After removing all individual deviations in excess of 0.3 inch in
 25 feet, perform additional grinding as necessary to reduce the Profile Index to the specified
 requirements.
 Surface smoothness tests with a California Type Profilograph on
 bridges are specified in 400-15. Ensure that the pavement within 15 feet of a bridge approach (or
 existing pavement which is being joined) complies with the testing requirements of a 10 foot
 straightedge.
 Visually inspect transverse joints and random cracks to ensure that
 the adjacent surfaces are in the same plane. Where misalignment of the planes of the surfaces on
 adjacent sides of the joints or cracks is in excess of 1/16 inch, grind the pavement until the
 surfaces are flush.

 352-6 Surface Corrections.
 After the curing period, test the surface for pavement surface smoothness in accordance
 with 352-5. Plainly mark all variations from the required tolerances. Where pavement surfaces
 do not meet the smoothness requirements, the Engineer will require corrective work and retesting
 to ensure conformity.
 Eliminate high spots exceeding 1/8 inch in 10 feet, but not in excess of 0.3 inch in
 25 feet, by grinding either with an approved machine or with a carborundum brick and water. Do
 not use bush-hammering or other destructive means for removing irregularities. As directed by
 the Engineer, retexture corrected high areas to give skid resistance comparable to the
 surrounding area.
 Operate all milling, cutting, or grinding equipment to produce a reasonably uniform
 finished surface without spalling the pavement joints within corrected areas. The Engineer will
 not require extra grinding to eliminate minor depressions in order to provide 100% texturing of
 the pavement surface. Maintain the cross slope of the pavement as shown in the Plans. Repair all
 joint seals destroyed by grinding at no expense to the Department.
 Remove and replace any area of pavement which, after grinding, still shows a deviation
 in excess of the allowable tolerance. Ensure that the area removed and replaced is the full length
 between transverse joints and the full width of the lane involved. Replace any area of concrete
 pavement with concrete that meets the requirements of Sections 353.
 Bear the costs of all surface corrections required and of all required removal and
 replacement of defective surface concrete. If the grinding operation removes more than a total
 length of 100 consecutive feet of the grooves, then re-groove the entire width of the pavement
 for the deficient area.
 352-7 Method of Measurement.
 The quantity to be paid for will be the plan quantity, in square yards, completed and
 accepted.
 352-8 Basis of Payment.
 Price and payment will be full compensation for all work and materials specified in this

 Portland Cement Concrete* ................................Section 346
 Curing Materials .................................................Section 925
 Epoxy Compounds ..............................................Section 926
 Post-Installed Anchor Systems for Structural
 Applications in Concrete Elements .....................Section 937
 Dowel Bar Assembly ..........................................Section 931
 Calcium Chloride ......................... AASHTO M-144, Type 1
 *For concrete pavement slab replacement, the use of pozzolans and slag is
 optional.
 Concrete pavement containing only dowel bars will be considered non-reinforced
 concrete.
 353-3 Composition of Concrete.
 353-3.1 Mixture Proportions: Designate the actual proportions to be used to produce a
 concrete with a minimum 28 day compressive strength of 3,000 psi.
 Prior to producing concrete, submit the design mix for approval on a form
 acceptable to the Department. Ensure that the design mix proportions will produce a concrete
 with a minimum compressive strength of 1,600 psi, designated for opening to traffic, at the time
 period specified in the Contract Documents. Perform the plastic property tests in accordance with
 Section 346, except when the mix design contains an accelerator, perform the plastic property
 tests prior to the addition of the accelerator. Use mixes approved by the Department and obtain
 concrete from a plant that is currently on the Department’s Production Facility listing. Producers
 seeking inclusion on the list shall meet the requirements of Section 105.
 Make necessary adjustment to the concrete mix-water to account for the amount
 of water in the accelerating admixture solution.
 353-3.2 Delivery Certification: Submit a delivery ticket in accordance with Section 346.
 353-3.3 Demonstration Slab: Prior to batching production concrete, demonstrate the
 ability to furnish replacement slabs by constructing a demonstration slab. Demonstrate
 production techniques for slab removal, dowel installation, concrete placement, finishing, slab
 curing, sample preparation and curing, and proper timing of joint sawing. Demonstrate the ability
 to achieve the required compressive strengths. Use and demonstrate proficiency to the Engineer
 of the maturity method to determine when the concrete has achieved a compressive strength of
 1,600 psi in order to open the pavement to traffic. Use cylinders to verify the concrete
 compressive strength at 28 days. Schedule construction of the demonstration slab during the
 same time period specified in the Contract Documents. If the Engineer determines that elements

 363
 
 of the demonstration slab fail to meet requirements of the Contract Documents, propose
 adjustments to the construction processes and/or materials for the Engineer’s approval.
 The demonstration slab may be used in the final work with the approval of the
 Engineer. No slab replacements will be constructed until the demonstration slab is approved. The
 Engineer may require additional demonstration slabs until a demonstration slab conforms to the
 Contract Documents.
 353-4 Batching and Mixing Concrete.
 Obtain concrete that meets the requirements of Section 346 with the following additional
 requirements:
 Add all the concrete ingredients, excluding the accelerator to the truck mixer at the plant.
 Add the accelerator to the load at the job site and record the amount on the delivery
 ticket. Mix the concrete for 30 additional revolutions at mixing speed after the accelerator is
 added to the mixer. Do not add accelerator to any concrete which has attained the age of
 60 minutes, measured from the beginning of the initial mixing at the plant.
 Incorporate the accelerator into the concrete design mix in accordance with the
 recommendations of the admixture manufacturer. Do not exceed the recommendations of the
 manufacturer’s technical data sheet for the dosage rate of the accelerating admixture.
 353-5 Test Requirements.
 353-5.1 General: Perform concrete sampling and testing in accordance with Section 346.
 Unit weight testing is required. Perform the plastic property tests after all ingredients have been
 added to the load, except when the mix design contains an accelerator; perform the plastic
 property tests prior to the addition of the accelerator.
 353-5.2 Field Delivered Mix Consistency: Test the concrete for consistency subject to
 the following tolerances from the approved mix design values:
 Slump Tolerance .............................plus or minus 1.5 inches
 Unit Weight ................................... plus or minus 2.0 pounds
 Temperature .......................................... not to exceed 100°F
 *For values as specified in the approved design mix prior to the addition
 of accelerating mixture.
 Reject concrete with a slump or unit weight content that does not fall within the
 specified tolerances and immediately notify the concrete production facility that an adjustment of
 the concrete mixture is required. If a load does not fall within the tolerances, test each subsequent
 load and the first adjusted load. If concrete not within the specified tolerances is not rejected or
 adjustments are not implemented, the Engineer may reject the concrete and terminate further
 production until corrections are implemented.
 353-5.3 Verification of Maturity Curve Data: A new maturity curve will be required
 should any of the plastic properties or the unit weight measure results exceed the tolerances
 specified in Table 1, for the initial sampling.

 Use the maturity method specified in this Section to determine if the concrete has
 achieved 1,600 psi and can be opened to traffic. Use the maturity value to verify the strength of
 the last slab of each day’s placement. Additional maturity meters may be used to open other
 locations to traffic prior to the last slab of each day, as needed, provided each location has
 achieved the minimum strength.
 353-5.4 Cylinder Fabrication and Testing: The requirements of Section 346 apply to
 this Section.
 Fabricate three test cylinders for strength and maturity curve correlation testing.
 Fabricate the compressive strength cylinders after all ingredients, including the accelerator, are
 added.
 The compressive strength cylinders and maturity curve correlation testing will be
 performed for the first production day, when the mix design is changed to another mix design, at
 the discretion of the Engineer for each remaining placement week, when a new maturity curve is
 required, or until terminated by the Engineer.
 353-6 Concrete Slab Acceptance and Testing.
 Reject any Concrete not meeting the plastic property requirements of this Section.
 Acceptance will be based on achieving 1,600 psi compressive strength prior to opening the slab
 to traffic based on the maturity method, and a 28 day compressive strength of 3,000 psi.
 Meet the requirements of 346-8 and 346-9. Perform Quality Control (QC) tests for
 temperature and unit weight and prepare compressive strength cylinders once per LOT. A LOT
 is defined as one day’s production, Section 346-9.2 does not apply.
 The Engineer will evaluate the particular circumstances in each instance where a strength
 deficiency occurs. Strength deficiencies will be addressed in accordance with Section 346.
 For each quality control (QC) cylinder that is lost, missing, damaged or destroyed,
 payment for that LOT will be reduced by $750.00 per 1,000 psi of the specified design strength
 [Example: loss of two QC cylinders that have no verification data will require the element to be
 cored and a pay reduction will be assessed (3,000 psi / 1,000 psi) x $750 x 2 = $4,500]. This
 reduction will be in addition to any pay adjustment for low strength.
 Controlled cracks are cracks designed to occur at specific locations based on the
 pavement design. All other cracks in the pavement are uncontrolled cracks. Repair uncontrolled
 cracked slabs, which occur during the life of the contract, by removing and replacing the
 pavement across the full width of all affected lanes or shoulders and to the nearest transverse
 joint in each direction. Investigate and implement immediate effective solutions to eliminate
 further cracks, in consultation with, and subject to the approval of, the Engineer.
 353-7 Placing, Striking Off, Consolidating and Finishing Concrete.
 The requirements of Section 350 are applicable to this Section.
 Perform straight edging while the concrete is still in plastic state after floating is
 completed and the excess water removed. Furnish and operate a 10 foot straightedge meeting the
 requirements of Section 350. Hold the straightedge in successive positions parallel to the road
 centerline, in contact with the surface, testing until the replacement slab is straight edged from
 one side to the other. Advance along the road in successive stages of not more than one-half the
 length of the straightedge. Fill any depressions immediately with freshly mixed concrete,
 consolidate, strike-off, and refinish. Cut down and refinish any high areas. Continue straightedge
 testing and surface correction until the entire surface conforms to the required grade and cross
 section. Ensure that transverse slope deviations of the finished pavement do not exceed 1/8 inch

 365
 
 with the straightedge laid in a direction perpendicular to the centerline. When portland cement
 concrete pavement abuts bridge approaches or pavement not under this Contract, ensure that the
 longitudinal slope deviations of the finished pavement do not exceed 1/8 inch in 10 foot length.
 Produce a uniform, gritty textured final finish longitudinally along the pavement by dragging a
 broom or seamless strip of damp burlap, having at least 3 feet in contact with the pavement.
 If the Engineer identifies a surface irregularity determined to be objectionable,
 straightedge with a 10 foot long straightedge and address all deficiencies in excess of 1/8 inch by
 grinding in accordance Section 352.
 When required in the Contract Documents, produce a pavement surface that is true to
 grade and uniform in appearance with a longitudinal line type texture by grinding in accordance
 with Section 352.
 353-8 Curing.
 Cure the slab as specified in Section 350, except for time and temperature restrictions.
 Use a Type I (with dye) or Type ID (clear with dye) curing compound and apply within 1/2 hour
 after completing the finishing operations. After the curing compound has been applied, cover the
 surface and exposed edges with two layers of white burlap-polyethylene curing blanket
 conforming to Section 925 or insulating blankets approved by the Engineer. Continue curing the
 slab until the concrete achieves the required 1,600 psi compressive strength indicated by the
 maturity value.
 353-9 Joints.
 353-9.1 General: Construct transverse joints as specified in Section 350 and as shown in
 the Standard Plans, except that dowels bars are installed per this Section. Tie bars will not be
 placed along the longitudinal joints unless shown in the Contract Documents. Apply a bond
 breaker to all vertical faces of the adjacent slabs. Submit the proposed bond breaker to the
 Engineer for approval.
 Clean and seal joints in accordance with Section 350.
 353-9.2 Dowel Bars: Provide dowel bars in accordance with the details shown in the
 Contract Documents.
 353-9.2.1 Dowel Bars at Transverse Joint Between two Replacement Slabs:
 Follow the requirements of 350-12 when providing dowel bars at a transverse joint between two
 freshly placed replacement slabs.
 353-9.2.2 Dowel Bars at Transverse Joints Between Existing and
 Replacement Slabs: Follow the requirements of Section 350, except drill holes and install dowel
 bars into the sawed face or end of the existing slab. Develop load transfer between existing and
 freshly placed replacement slab. The dowels shall be free to move inside the replacement slab
 and epoxy-bonded into the existing slab.
 353-9.2.3 Dowel Bar Installation: Install dowel bars in accordance with
 Section 416 except as modified herein. Position each dowel such that its final deviation from
 parallel to the surface of the pavement and parallel to the longitudinal centerline of the pavement
 does not exceed 1/2 inch. Position each dowel such that its final deviation from centered on the
 joint does not exceed 2 inches. Position each dowel such that at no point in its length does it
 deviate from the surface of the pavement as shown in the Plans in excess of 1 inch. Confirm the
 position of dowel bars by means acceptable to the Engineer, which may include non-destructive
 testing methods.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 366
 
 Use epoxy compounds in accordance with Section 937. Dispense the
 epoxy from a cartridge or from metered equipment that indicates the amount of each component
 material being dispensed.
 Inject epoxy into the hole after cleaning and prior to dowel insertion. Start
 injection at the back of the hole to force the epoxy to move forward during dowel insertion.
 Twist the dowel a minimum of one full turn during the insertion to ensure that the epoxy
 completely surrounds the dowel. The injection process and viscosity of the epoxy shall be
 adequate to insure that the space between the surface of the dowel and the inside of the hole is
 completely filled with epoxy.
 Do not allow the epoxy to escape from the front of the hole after inserting
 the dowel in the hole. Use a grout retention disk 1/8 inch thick, fabricated from nylon or plastic,
 to hold epoxy in the hole during dowel insertion.
 353-10 Protection and Opening to Traffic.
 353-10.1 General: The requirements of Section 350 apply to this Section. Keep the
 placed slabs closed to traffic until the maturity value indicates that the compressive strength
 requirement is achieved. Submit a maturity value record to the Engineer indicating that the
 required strength was achieved prior to opening to traffic. The Engineer may allow opening to
 traffic should the maturity equipment fail to provide a reading. Opening to traffic due to
 equipment failure does not constitute acceptance of the concrete.
 Protect the pavement from all traffic, including construction vehicles, until the
 maturity value indicates that the required strength has been obtained. The protective measures
 shall be arranged so as not to interfere with traffic lanes being utilized for required maintenance
 of traffic.
 353-10.2 Maturity Method Testing: Use a maturity curve to estimate the strength of the
 concrete for opening to traffic for each day of production. Embed temperature sensors at middepth in the slab, at 6 inches from the leading edge of the transverse joint and at 6 inches from
 the longitudinal joint or at locations designated by the Engineer.
 Develop a strength-maturity relationship curve using the Arrhenius maturity
 function with an activation energy of 33,500 J/mol as outlined in FM 3-C1074, in a laboratory
 with personnel qualified to perform the method. Compressive strength tests, as specified in
 FM 3-C1074, will be performed to produce a five point curve with points before and after the
 anticipated time for opening to traffic. Submit the mix design supporting data and the maturity
 curve to the Engineer for his approval.
 Any changes of a material source or proportion in the concrete mixture will
 require a new maturity curve.
 353-11 Method of Measurement.
 The pay quantity for concrete pavement slab replacement, calculated using fieldmeasured horizontal dimensions and thickness of the removed slab, will be the volume, in cubic
 yards, of calculated concrete volume placed and accepted.
 The pay quantity for cleaning and sealing joints will be in accordance with Section 350.

 Remedial work will not be required if any one of the following conditions is found to
 
 1. Determination that the pavement thickness design as provided by the
 Department is deficient. The Department will make available a copy of the original pavement
 thickness design package and design traffic report to the Contractor upon request. The Contractor
 will be responsible for performing all remedial work associated with the pavement distress if the
 pavement design is provided by the Contractor.
 2. Determination that the Accumulated ESALs (Number of 18 Kip Equivalent
 Single Axle Loads in the design lane) have increased by 25% or more than the Accumulated
 ESALs used by the Department for design purposes for the warranty period for the pavement
 design life. In calculating ESALs, the Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) will be obtained
 from the Department’s traffic count data and the T24 (Percent Heavy Trucks during a 24 hour
 period) will be obtained from the Department’s traffic classification survey data.
 3. Determination that the deficiency was due to the failure of the existing
 underlying layers that were not part of the Contract work.
 4. Determination that the deficiency was the responsibility of a third party or its
 actions, unless the third party was performing work included in the Contract.
 If a measured distress value indicates remedial action is required per Table 355-1, begin
 remedial work within 45 calendar days of notification by the Department or a ruling of the
 Statewide Disputes Review Board. The Statewide Disputes Review Board will determine the
 allowable duration for the completion of the remedial work, but not to exceed 6 months.
 If remedial action is necessary and forensic information is required, it is the responsibility
 of the Contractor to determine the source of the distress. The Contractor will not be responsible
 for damages to the pavement as a result of any forensic activities conducted at the discretion of
 the Engineer.
 As applicable to distress criteria for ride, when two lots requiring remedial action or a
 partial lot and a lot are not separated by three or more lots not requiring remedial action, the
 remedial work shall be required for the total length of all such contiguous lots and partial lots,
 including the intermediate lots not requiring remedial action.
 The Contractor has the first option to perform all remedial work, as determined by the
 Department. If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the problem poses an immediate danger to the
 traveling public and the Contractor cannot provide temporary mitigation for the defect within
 4 hours of written notification and restore the pavement to its original design condition within
 72 hours of written notification, the Engineer has the authority to have the remedial work
 performed by other forces. Temporary mitigation includes the use of traffic control systems such
 as barricades, drums, or other approved devices to secure the area including lane closures if
 necessary, and constructing temporary repairs making it safe for the roadway user until the
 defect can be restored to its original design condition. The Contractor is responsible for all
 incurred costs of the work performed by other forces should the problem (remedial work) be
 determined to be the responsibility of the Contractor. Remedial work performed by other forces
 does not alter any of the requirements, responsibilities or obligations of the Contractor.
 Complete all remedial work to the satisfaction of the Engineer. Any disputes regarding
 the adequacy of the remedial work will be resolved by the Statewide Disputes Review Board.
 Approval of remedial work does not relieve the Contractor from continuing responsibility under
 the provisions of this Specification.

 371
 
 Notify the Engineer in writing prior to beginning any remedial work. Meet the
 requirements of the Specifications when performing any remedial work. Perform all signing and
 traffic control in accordance with the Standard Plans. Provide maintenance of traffic during
 remedial work at no additional cost to the Department. Lane closure restrictions listed in the
 original Contract will apply to remedial work. Written requests to obtain permission for lane
 closures for either forensic investigation or remedial work must be made to the Engineer
 48 hours in advance of any lane closures. Do not perform any lane closures until written
 permission is given by the Engineer.
 If remedial work necessitates a corrective action to the pavement markings, adjacent
 lanes, or roadway shoulders, perform these corrective actions using similar products at no cost to
 the Department.
 355-6 Failure to Perform.
 Failure to timely submit any dispute to the Statewide Disputes Review Board, failure to
 satisfactorily perform any remedial work, or failure to compensate the Department for any
 remedial work performed by the Department and determined to be the Contractor’s responsibility
 in accordance with this Specification, the Department will suspend, revoke or deny the
 Contractor’s certificate of qualification under the terms of Section 337.16(d)(2), Florida Statutes,
 for a minimum of 6 months or until the remedial work has been satisfactorily performed (or full
 and complete payment for remedial work performed by others made to the Department),
 whichever is longer. Should the Contractor choose to challenge the Department’s notification of
 intent for suspension, revocation or denial of qualification and the Department’s action is upheld,
 the Contractor will have its qualification suspended for an additional minimum of 6 months.
 The remedial work is not an obligation of the Contractor’s bond required by
 Section 337.18, Florida Statutes.

 400-4 Falsework.
 400-4.1 Plans: At the Engineer’s request, submit detailed plans for falsework or
 centering to the Department. The Contractor is responsible for results obtained by using these
 plans.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 374
 
 400-4.2 Design and Erection: Design and construct all falsework to provide the
 necessary rigidity and to support the loads without appreciable settlement or deformation. Use
 screw jacks or hardwood wedges to take up any settlement in the framework, either before or
 during the placing of concrete. If any weakness develops and the centering shows undue
 settlement or distortion, stop the work, remove any affected concrete, and strengthen the
 falsework before resuming work. Support falsework which cannot be founded on a satisfactory
 footing on piling. Space, drive, and remove the piling in an approved manner.
 400-4.3 Camber: Provide camber to correct for settlement and deflection of falsework.
 Give bridges permanent camber only when shown in the Plans.
 400-4.4 Bridge Deck Overhang Falsework for Steel I-Girders: Locate the lower
 contact point of bridge deck overhang falsework supporting screed rails within 6 inches above
 the bottom flange. If the lower contact point of the overhang falsework bears more than 6 inches
 above the bottom flange and/or if the deck overhang is 4 feet or greater, submit shop drawings
 and calculations to the Engineer in accordance with Section 5 and Chapter 11 of the Structures
 Design Guidelines (SDG). The deck overhang is measured from the centerline of the girder
 supporting the overhang falsework to the outside edge of the concrete deck.
 400-5 Forms.
 400-5.1 General: Provide forms, either of wood or metal, that are as follows: externally
 secured and braced where feasible; substantial and unyielding; of adequate strength to contain the
 concrete without bulging between supports and without apparent deviation from the neat lines,
 contours, and shapes shown in the Plans. Design forms to withstand the additional forces of
 vibration without apparent deviation from the desired shape or position. Assemble forms to be
 mortar-tight. If using lumber forms, construct them of dressed wood of uniform thickness. Use
 form liners on wooden forms where Class 3 surface finish is specified. Construct assembled
 forms to render a concrete surface of smooth, uniform finish. Make provisions to remove forms
 without injury to concrete surfaces. Remove blocks and bracing with the forms, and do not leave
 any portion of the forms in the concrete. Use the same form system for a type of work
 throughout.
 400-5.2 Inspection and Approval: Do not place concrete in a form until the form has
 been inspected and approved. Although the Engineer inspects and approves the forms, the
 Contractor is responsible for obtaining satisfactory concrete surfaces, free from warping, bulging,
 or other objectionable defects. Pay special attention to the ties and bracing. Where the forms
 appear to be insufficiently braced or unsatisfactorily built, stop and correct defects to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer.
 400-5.3 Non-metallic Form Materials:
 400-5.3.1 Lumber: For all surfaces, use lumber that is not less than 3/4 inch in
 thickness, dressed, and free of knot holes, loose knots, cracks, splits, warps, and other defects.
 Proportion the spacing of studs, joists, and wales to exclude warps and bulges and to produce
 true and accurate concrete surfaces. Only use structurally sound lumber.
 400-5.3.2 Form Liners: Use form liners of durable, abrasion resistant materials
 that are unaffected by water. Use liners with a hard surface texture capable of rendering concrete
 surfaces of a smooth, uniform texture, without grain marks, patterns, or blemishes. Use form
 liner material of sufficient thickness to eliminate the reflection of irregularities, undesirable
 patterns, and marks from the forms to the surfaces. Replace liners as necessary to produce a
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 375
 
 consistent concrete surface texture. Use form liners in large sheets and with true, tight-fitted
 joints which are logically located. Obtain the Engineer’s approval of the layout of sheets. Do not
 use liners which have been patched. Use liner material of the same stock throughout.
 400-5.3.3 Plywood: The Contractor may use plywood of not less than 5/8 inch in
 thickness manufactured with waterproof glue or protected with an approved impervious coating.
 Do not use pieces with bulged plies or raveled, untrue edges.
 400-5.4 Special Requirements:
 400-5.4.1 Re-entrant Angles: Use chamfered forms for exterior concrete corners
 and filleted forms for interior concrete corners. Use chamfers and fillets that are 3/4 by 3/4 inch
 and are mill-dressed on all sides to uniform dimensions. The Contractor may use plastic or metal
 chamfers and fillets provided they perform satisfactorily in producing uniform, smooth concrete
 corner surfaces without honeycomb.
 400-5.4.2 Handrails, Concrete Barriers, Traffic Railings, and Parapets:
 Construct in accordance with Section 521.
 400-5.4.3 End-bent Caps: Do not place forms for end-bent caps until the
 embankment has been constructed to within 12 inches of the bottom of the cap. Place a mass of
 embankment that is sufficient to produce the subsidence, displacement, and settlement which
 may result from the construction of the total embankment.
 400-5.4.4 Footings: Where footing concrete can be placed in dry excavation, the
 Contractor may omit cribs, cofferdams, and forms, subject to compliance with the following
 limitations and conditions:
 1. Use this procedure only in locations not exposed to view from traveled
 roadways.
 2. Obtain required elevations shown in the Plans.
 3. Obtain neat line dimensions shown in the Plans.
 4. Fill the entire excavation with concrete to the required elevation of the
 top of the footing.
 5. The Engineer will determine the volume of footing concrete to be paid
 for from the neat line dimensions shown in the Plans.
 400-5.5 Form Alignment, Bracing, and Ties: Construct forms in such manner that they
 may be adequately secured for alignment, shape, and grade. Use bracing systems, ties, and
 anchorages that are substantial and sufficient to ensure against apparent deviation from shape,
 alignment, and grade. Do not drive nails into existing concrete. Do not use bracing systems, ties,
 and anchorages which unnecessarily deface or mark, or have an injurious or undesirable effect on
 surfaces that will be a part of the finished surface.
 If metal ties and anchorages are to remain in the concrete, construct them so as to
 permit the removal of metal to at least 1 inch beneath the finished surface of concrete. Use
 accessories for metal ties and anchorages that allow the removal of metal to the prescribed depth
 while leaving the smallest possible repairable cavity.
 When using wire ties, cut or bend them back from the finished surface of the
 concrete a minimum of 1 inch. Do not use internal ties of wire when forming surfaces that are
 exposed to view.
 400-5.6 Preparation and Cleaning: Meet the following requirements for the condition
 of forms at the time of beginning concrete casting:
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 376
 
 1. Treat all forms with an approved form-release agent before placing concrete.
 Do not use material which adheres to or discolors the concrete.
 2. Clean forms of all concrete laitance from previous use and all dirt, sawdust,
 shavings, loose wire ties and other debris.
 3. Close and secure all inspection and cleanout holes.
 400-5.7 Stay-In-Place Metal Forms:
 400-5.7.1 General: Utilization of stay-in-place metal forms is permitted in lieu of
 removable forms to form concrete bridge decks between beams and between the webs of
 individual box girders when designated in the Plans. Stay-in-place metal forms may be of the
 cellular, non-cellular or non-cellular with top cover sheet type. The flutes of non-cellular stay-inplace metal forms may be filled with polystyrene foam or concrete. When polystyrene foam is
 used to fill the forms, fill form flutes completely; do not allow any portion of the polystyrene
 foam to extend beyond the limits of the flutes. Ensure that the polystyrene foam remains in its
 required position within flutes during the entire concrete placement process. Do not use
 reinforcing supports or other accessories in such a manner as to cause damage to the polystyrene
 foam. Replace all damaged polystyrene foam to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 Apply polymer sheeting to stay-in-place metal forms in accordance with
 the requirements in the following table. Apply polymer sheeting to all faces and edges (including
 sheared edges) of support angles used on bridges with Moderately and Extremely Aggressive
 Superstructure Environmental Classifications (as shown in the Plans). No polymer sheeting is
 required for beam attachment straps or clips partially embedded in concrete, and for support
 angles used on bridges with a Slightly Aggressive Superstructure Environmental Classification.
 Use polymer sheeting materials and application methods as described herein.

 Prior to using stay-in-place metal forms, submit detailed plans for
 approval of the forming system, including method of support and attachment and method of
 protecting the supporting structural steel components from welding effects. Submit design
 calculations for the forming system, which have been signed and sealed by the Specialty
 Engineer. Detail stay-in-place metal forms such that they in no way infringe upon the concrete
 outline of the slab shown on the Plans. Use stay-in-place metal forms that provide and maintain
 the dimensions and configuration of the original slab in regards to thickness and slope.
 Do not weld stay-in-place metal form supports and connections to the
 structural steel components. Do not connect polymer coated angles or other hardware that
 support polymer coated metal forms to the beam attachment straps or clips by welding. Electrical
 grounding to steel reinforcing or fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcing is prohibited.
 Protect structural steel components from damage by using a shield to
 guard against weld splatter, weld overrun, arc strikes, or other damaging effects of the welding
 process. Upon completion of welding, rest the metal form support flush on the supporting steel
 component. Should any weld spatter, weld overrun, arc strike, or other effects of the welding
 process be evident or occur to the structural steel component, immediately stop in-place welding
 of the metal form supports for the remainder of the work. In this event, weld all metal form
 supports off of the structure and erect the forms after prefabrication, or use an alternate approved
 method of attaching the form supports. Remove improper weldment, repair the supporting steel
 component for any improper welding. Perform all required verification and testing at no expense
 to the Department and to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 Do not use stay-in-place metal forms until the forming system has been
 approved by the Engineer. The Contractor is responsible for the performance of the stay-in-place
 forms.
 Structures designed, detailed, and dimensioned for the use of removable
 forms: Where stay-in-place metal forms are permitted, the Contractor is responsible and shall
 obtain the approval of the Engineer for any changes in design, etc. to accommodate the use of
 stay-in-place forms. The Engineer will compute pay quantities of the various components of the
 structure which are paid on a cubic yard basis from the design dimensions shown in the Plans
 with no allowance for changes in deflection or dimensions necessary to accommodate the stay-inplace forms or concrete to fill the form flutes. The Engineer will limit pay quantities of other
 Contract items that the Contractor increases to accommodate the use of stay-in-place forms to the
 quantity required for the original plan design.
 Submit all changes in design details of bridge structural members that
 support stay-in-place forms, showing all revisions necessary to enable the supporting components
 to withstand any additional weight of the forms and the weight of any extra concrete that may be
 required to fill the forms. Include with the design calculations a comparative analysis of the
 stresses in the supporting components as detailed on the Contract Plans and as modified to
 support the forms. Use the identical method of analysis in each case, and do not allow the
 stresses in the modified components to exceed those of the component as detailed in the Contract
 Plans. Include with the design the adjusted cambers for any changes in deflection over those
 shown on the original Plans. Modify the beams to provide additional strength to compensate for
 the added dead loads imposed by the use of stay-in-place forms. Obtain the additional strength by
 adding strands to the pre-stressed beams or by adding steel material to increase the section
 modulus of steel girders. Substantiate the added strength by the comparative calculations. Do not

 378
 
 use stay-in-place forms until the forming system and all necessary design revisions of supporting
 members have been approved by the Engineer.
 Structures designed, detailed, and dimensioned for the use of stay-in-place
 metal forms:
 Prior to using stay-in-place metal forms, submit detailed plans for
 approval of the forming system (including method of support and attachment) together with
 design calculations. Include an analysis of the actual unit weight of the proposed forming system
 over the projected plan area of the metal forms. If the weight thus calculated exceeds the weight
 allowance for stay-in-place metal forms and concrete required to fill the forms shown on the
 Plans, then modify the supporting components to support the excess weight as specified by the
 Contractor’s Specialty Engineer.
 For all structures utilizing structural steel supporting components, paint
 the vertical sides of the top flange prior to installation of the stay-in-place metal forms in
 accordance with Section 560.
 For non-polymer sheeting form surfaces, use zinc paint coating in
 accordance with Section 562 to all accessories cut from galvanized sheets, which are not
 embedded in concrete.
 400-5.7.2 Design: Meet the following criteria for the design of stay-in-place
 bridge deck forms:
 1. The maximum self weight of the stay in place metal forms, plus the
 weight of the concrete or expanded polystyrene required to fill the form flutes (where used), shall
 not exceed 20 psf.
 2. Design the forms on the basis of dead load of form, reinforcement, and
 plastic concrete plus 50 pounds per square foot for construction loads. Use a unit working stress
 in the steel sheet of not more than 0.725 of the specified minimum yield strength of the material
 furnished, but not to exceed 36,000 psi.
 3. Do not allow deflection under the weight of the forms, reinforcement,
 and plastic concrete to exceed 1/180 of the form span or 1/2 inch, whichever is less, for form
 spans of 10 feet or less, or 1/240 of the form span or 3/4 inch, whichever is less, for form spans
 greater than 10 feet. In all cases, do not use a total loading (psf) that is less than 20 plus the
 product of the deck thickness measured in inches times 12.5.
 4. Use a design span of the form equal to the clear span of the form plus
 2 inches. Measure the span parallel to the form flutes.
 5. Compute physical design properties in accordance with requirements of
 the AISI Specifications for the Design of Cold Formed Steel Structural Members, latest
 published edition.
 6. For all reinforcement, maintain the design concrete cover required by
 the Plans.
 7. Maintain the plan dimensions of both layers of primary deck
 reinforcement from the top surface of the concrete deck.
 8. Do not consider the permanent bridge deck form as lateral bracing for
 compression flanges of supporting structural members.
 9. Do not use permanent steel bridge deck forms in panels where
 longitudinal deck construction joints are located between stringers.

 10. Secure forms to the supporting members by means other than welding
 directly to the member.
 400-5.7.3 Materials:
 400-5.7.3.1 Metal Forms: Fabricate stay-in-place metal forms and
 supports from steel meeting the requirements of ASTM A653 having a coating designation
 G165. Do not use form materials that are less than 0.03 inch uncoated thickness.
 400-5.7.3.2 Polymer Sheeting: Use polymer sheeting comprised of at
 least 85% ethylene acrylic acid copolymer capable of being applied to both G165 and G210 steel
 sheet as described in ASTM A742. Ensure that the polymer sheeting has a nominal thickness of
 12 mils as manufactured and a minimum thickness of 10 mils after lamination to the steel sheet.
 Ensure that the polymer sheeting remains free of holes, tears and discontinuities and sufficiently
 flexible to withstand the forming process without any detrimental effects to bond, durability or
 performance. Ensure that the polymer sheeting is UV stabilized and contains antioxidants.
 Ensure that the as-manufactured polymer sheeting (prior to
 application) has an Oxidative Induction Time (OIT) of 60 to 75 minutes at 170°C in air when
 tested according to ASTM D3895. Perform additional OIT tests on samples taken from the
 finished product (polymer sheeting applied to forms) resulting in a minimum OIT according to
 ASTM D3895 of 32 minutes at 170°C in air. Ensure that the polymer sheeting adheres to
 galvanized metal sufficient to prevent undercutting at penetrations made through the polymer
 sheeting or metal forms to the satisfaction of the Engineer. Ensure that edges subjected to shear
 cutting are coated by the form manufacturer with two coats of a compatible liquid coating repair
 material before delivery to the site. Ensure that steel used to produce polymer laminated metal
 forms is appropriately cleaned and prepared per NCCA (National Coil Coating Association)
 standard continuous coil coating practices. Ensure that pretreatment for use in conjunction with
 the manufacturer’s polymer sheeting material is approved as compatible by the polymer sheeting
 manufacturer. Apply pretreatment in accordance with the polymer sheeting manufacturer’s
 procedures. Apply polymer sheeting in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations
 and procedures. Ensure that all steel has the polymer sheeting applied prior to fabrication of the
 stay-in-place forms and accessories.
 Ensure that the screws to be used in the fastening of the stay-inplace laminated metal forms have a corrosion resistant cladding that will not have an adverse
 effect to the system due to the contact of dissimilar metals.
 400-5.7.3.3 Certification: Submit a written certification from the manufacturer
 stating the product meets the requirements of this specification along with the delivery of the
 coated forms to the jobsite. Ensure that the certification conforms to the requirements of Section
 6. Ensure that the manufacturer has a quality control program conforming to ISO 9001 2000
 standards.
 400-5.7.3.4 Polystyrene Foam: Use polystyrene foam comprised of expanded
 polystyrene manufactured from virgin resin of sufficient density to support the weight of concrete
 without deformation. Extrude the polystyrene foam to match the geometry of the flutes and
 provide a snug fit. Use polystyrene foam that has a density of not less than 0.8 pounds per cubic
 foot. Use polystyrene foam that has water absorption of less than 2.6% when tested according to
 ASTM C272. Submit a written certification from the manufacturer stating the product meets the
 requirements of this Specification along with the delivery of the product.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 380
 
 400-5.7.4 Construction: Install all forms in accordance with approved fabrication
 and erection plans.
 Do not rest form sheets directly on the top of the stringer of floor beam
 flanges. Fasten sheets securely to form supports, and maintain a minimum bearing length of
 1 inch at each end for metal forms. Place form supports in direct contact with the flange of the
 stringer or floor beam. Make all attachments for coated metal forms by bolts, clips, screws, or
 other approved means.
 400-5.7.4.1 Form Galvanizing Repairs: For any permanent exposed steel
 where the galvanized coating has been damaged, thoroughly clean, wire brush, and paint it with
 two coats of galvanizing compound in accordance with Section 562 to the satisfaction of the
 Engineer. Do not touch up minor heat discoloration in areas of welds.
 400-5.7.4.2 Polymer Sheeting Repairs: Inspect and identify areas for
 damage to the polymer sheeting and repair with liquid polymer coating similar and compatible
 with respect to durability, adhesion and appearance in accordance with ASTM A762, as
 furnished by the stay-in-place form manufacturer. Ensure that the inspection includes checking
 the polymer sheeting for cuts, tears, cracking, surface pits, peeling, dirt, grease, oil, stains, rust or
 bare areas. Reject any panels that show coating blistering, peeling or cracking. Repair all polymer
 sheeting damage according to the following:
 1. Surface Preparation: Ensure that all surfaces to be repaired are
 clean and free of any deleterious substances. Remove all traces of dirt, soil, oil deposits, greases,
 and other surface contaminates in accordance with the polymer sheeting and coating
 manufacturer’s written specifications prior to touch-up and recoating.
 2. Application Procedures: Ensure that the liquid polymer repair
 coating is applied to a clean dry surface and in accordance with the manufacturer’s written
 specifications. Apply the repair coating using a suitable paintbrush or other means acceptable to
 the Engineer. Apply a first coat of product to the surface at 2-4 mils in thickness. Let the first
 coat air dry. Apply a second coat to form a complete layer and increase the thickness,
 immediately after verifying the first coat is dry to the touch (15 - 25 minutes depending on the
 local air drying temperature and atmospheric conditions). Apply the second coat at the same
 coating thickness as the first at 2-4 mils. Ensure that the total dry film thickness of the two coats
 is not less than 6 mils. Apply additional coats in this same manner until desired coating thickness
 is achieved.
 400-5.7.5 Placing of Concrete: Vibrate concrete to avoid honeycomb and voids,
 especially at construction joints, expansion joints, valleys and ends of form sheets. Use approved
 pouring sequences. Do not use calcium chloride or any other admixture containing chloride salts
 in the concrete.
 400-5.7.6 Inspection: The Engineer will observe the Contractor’s method of
 construction during all phases of the construction of the bridge deck slab, including the
 installation of the metal form system; location and fastening of the reinforcement; composition of
 concrete items; mixing procedures, concrete placement, and vibration; and finishing of the bridge
 deck. Should the Engineer determine that the procedures used during the placement of the
 concrete warrant inspection of the underside of the deck, remove at least one section of the metal
 forms in each span for this purpose. Do this as soon after placing the concrete as practicable in
 order to provide visual evidence that the concrete mix and the procedures are obtaining the

 381
 
 desired results. Remove an additional section in any span if the Engineer determines that there
 has been any change in the concrete mix or in the procedures warranting additional inspection.
 If, in the Engineer’s judgment, inspection is needed to check for defects in
 the bottom of the deck or to verify soundness, sound the metal forms with a hammer as directed
 by the Engineer after the deck concrete has been in place a minimum of two days. If sounding
 discloses areas of doubtful soundness to the Engineer, remove the metal forms from such areas
 for visual inspection after the concrete has attained adequate strength. Remove metal bridge deck
 forms at no expense to the Department.
 At locations where sections of the metal forms have been removed, the
 Engineer will not require the Contractor to replace the metal forms. Repair the adjacent metal
 forms and supports to present a neat appearance and to ensure their satisfactory retention and
 where they are polymer sheeted, coat all exposed surfaces of stay-in-place metal form system
 elements that are not coated or are damaged with a field applied liquid polymer coating as
 specified in 400-5.7.4.2. As soon as the form is removed, the Engineer will examine the concrete
 surfaces for cavities, honeycombing, and other defects. If irregularities are found, and the
 Engineer determines that these irregularities do not justify rejection of the work, repair the
 concrete as directed, and provide a General Surface Finish in accordance with 400-15. If the
 Engineer determines that the concrete where the form is removed is unsatisfactory, remove
 additional metal forms as necessary to inspect and repair the slab, and modify the method of
 construction as required to obtain satisfactory concrete in the slab. Remove and replace all
 unsatisfactory concrete as directed, at no expense to the Department.
 If the method of construction and the results of the inspections as outlined
 above indicate that sound concrete has been obtained throughout the slabs, the amount of
 sounding and form removal may be reduced when approved by the Engineer.
 Corrosion of assembly screws will not be considered a structural or
 aesthetic problem and is considered acceptable.
 Provide the facilities for the safe and convenient conduct of the inspection
 procedures.
 400-5.8 Stay-In-Place Concrete Forms:
 400-5.8.1 General: Permanent stay-in-place precast reinforced concrete forms
 may be used in lieu of removable forms to form concrete bridge deck slabs subject to the
 conditions contained herein. Precast reinforced concrete stay-in-place forms are not permitted to
 construct a composite concrete deck. Do not use precast prestressed concrete stay-in-place forms
 to form any permanent bridge decks.
 When detailed Plans for structures are dimensioned for the use of
 removable forms, provide additional slab thickness, elevation changes, changes in design, etc. to
 accommodate the use of stay-in-place forms, subject to the Engineer’s approval. The Engineer
 will compute pay quantities of the various component members of the structure which are paid
 on a cubic yard basis from the design dimensions shown in the Plans with no allowance for
 changes in deflection and changes in dimensions necessary to accommodate the stay-in-place
 forms. The Engineer will limit pay quantities of other Contract items which are increased to
 accommodate the use of stay-in-place forms to the quantity required for the original plan design.
 Prior to using stay-in-place forms, submit for approval detailed plans of
 the forming system and design calculations. Indicate on the plans the form panel sizes, placing
 patterns, type of mastic or felt bearing material and type and method of caulking between panels.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 382
 
 Also, submit appropriate changes in design details of structural members supporting stay-in-place
 forms showing any revisions necessary to enable the supporting components to withstand the
 additional weight of the forms and perform equally as contemplated in the Plans. All calculations
 and details submitted shall be sealed by the Contractor’s Engineer of Record. Modify the beams
 to provide additional strength to compensate for the added dead loads imposed by the use of stayin-place forms. Obtain this strength by adding additional strands to prestressed girders or
 increasing the section modulus for steel girders. Do not use stay-in-place forms until the forming
 system and any necessary design revisions of supporting structural members have been approved
 by the Engineer. The Department is not responsible for the performance of the stay-in-place
 forms by its approval.
 400-5.8.2 Materials: Construct permanent concrete forms of precast reinforced
 concrete with a Class 3 Surface Finish. As a minimum, use the same class of concrete and 28-day
 minimum compressive strength as being used to construct the bridge deck. Use welded steel wire
 reinforcement meeting the requirements of Section 931.
 400-5.8.3 Design: Use the following criteria for the design of permanent bridge
 deck forms:
 1. Design the forms on the basis of deadload of form, reinforcement, and
 plastic concrete plus an unfactored live load of 50 psf for construction loads. Meet the AASHTO
 design requirements for service loads and ultimate loads as applicable.
 2. Deflection under the weight of the forms, reinforcement, and the plastic
 concrete shall not exceed 1/180 of the form span or 1/2 inch, whichever is less. In all cases, do
 not use a loading that is less than 120 psf total.
 3. Use a design span of the form equal to the clear span of the form
 between supports. Measure the span of concrete forms parallel to the centerline of the form
 panels.
 4. Compute physical design properties of concrete forms in accordance
 with current AASHTO design procedures.
 5. Ensure that all reinforcement contained in the cast-in-place concrete has
 the minimum cover shown in the Plans or not less than one inch, whichever is greater. Measure
 the minimum cover normal to the plane of the bottom of the cast-in-place concrete. For stay-inplace concrete forms with other than plane surfaces in contact with the cast-in-place concrete,
 such as regularly spaced geometrical shapes projecting above the plane of the bottom of the castin-place concrete, meet the following special requirements:
 a. Space geometrical shapes projecting above the bottom plane of
 the cast-in-place concrete used to provide support for reinforcement no closer than 3 feet apart
 and of sufficient height to maintain the required concrete cover on the bottom mat of reinforcing
 bars.
 b. Construct all other geometrical shapes projecting above the
 plane of the bottom of the cast-in-place concrete to provide a minimum vertical clearance of
 3/4 inch between the closest surface of the projections and the secondary longitudinal reinforcing
 bars in the deck slab.
 c. Do not allow a minimum horizontal distance from the surface of
 any transverse reinforcing bars to surfaces of the stay-in-place form of less than 1 1/2 inches.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 383
 
 For all reinforcement for the stay-in-place form panels,
 provide a minimum of 1 inch concrete cover except that, for construction in a salt or other
 corrosive environment, provide a minimum of 1 1/2 inches concrete cover.
 6. Maintain the plan dimensions of both layers of primary deck
 reinforcement from the top surface of the concrete deck. Measure the minimum cover of the
 bottom mat of reinforcement normal to the top of the precast concrete form panel.
 7. Do not consider the permanent bridge deck form as lateral bracing for
 compression flanges of supporting structural members.
 8. Do not use permanent concrete bridge deck forms in panels where
 longitudinal deck construction joints are located between stringers.
 9. Do not allow the maximum weight of the concrete form to exceed
 40 pounds per square foot of form surface.
 400-5.8.4 Construction: Install all forms in accordance with approved fabrication
 and erection plans.
 For concrete forms, provide a minimum bearing length of at least
 1 1/2 inches but not exceeding 2 1/2 inches. Support concrete forms on the beams or girders by
 continuous layers of an approved mastic or felt bearing material that will provide a mortar tight
 uniform bearing. Use a mastic or felt bearing material that has a minimum width of 1 inch and a
 maximum width of 1 1/2 inches. Seal joints between concrete form panels with caulking, tape, or
 other approved method.
 400-5.8.5 Placing of Concrete: Place the concrete in accordance with the
 requirements of 400-5.7.5. Immediately prior to placing the slab concrete, saturate concrete stayin-place form panels with water.
 400-5.8.6 Inspection: Inspect the concrete in accordance with the requirements of
 400-5.7.6.
 After the deck concrete has been in place for a minimum period of two
 days, inspect the forms for cracks and excessive form deflection, and test for soundness and
 bonding of the forms by sounding with a hammer as directed by the Engineer. Remove, for visual
 inspection, form panels found to be cracked that show evidence of leakage and form panels
 which have a deflection greater than adjacent panels by 1/2 inch or more which show signs of
 leakage. If sounding discloses areas of doubtful soundness to the Engineer, remove the form
 panels from such areas for visual inspection after the concrete has attained adequate strength.
 Remove permanent bridge deck form panels at no expense to the Department.
 At locations where sections of the forms have been removed, the Engineer
 will not require the forms to be replaced. Repair the adjacent forms and supports to present a neat
 appearance and to ensure their satisfactory retention. As soon as the form is removed, the
 Engineer will examine the concrete surfaces for cavities, honeycombing, and other defects. If
 irregularities are found, and the Engineer determines that these irregularities do not justify
 rejection of the work, repair the concrete as directed and provide a General Surface Finish in
 accordance with 400-15. If the concrete where the form is removed is unsatisfactory, as
 determined by the Engineer, additional forms shall be removed as necessary to inspect and repair
 the slab, and modify the methods of construction as required to obtain satisfactory concrete in the
 slab. Remove and replace all unsatisfactory concrete as directed at no expense to the Department.

 If the methods of construction and the results of the inspections as outlined
 above indicate that the Contractor has obtained sound concrete throughout the slabs, the
 Contractor may moderate the amount of sounding and form removal, when approved.
 Provide all facilities for the safe and convenient conduct of the inspection
 procedures.
 400-6 Underdrain and Weep Holes.
 Provide weep holes in all abutments and retaining walls.
 Provide a continuous underdrain for box culverts in accordance with Standard Plans,
 Index 400-289. Provide weep holes that are at least 3 inches in diameter and not more than
 10 feet apart. Place the outlet ends of the weep holes just above the ground line in front of
 abutments and retaining walls. Cover the exterior openings of all weep holes with galvanized
 wire mesh and a minimum of 2 cubic feet of clean, broken stone or gravel wrapped in Type D 3
 filter fabric, to allow free drainage but prevent the fill from washing through.
 400-7 Placing Concrete.
 400-7.1Weather Restrictions:
 400-7.1.1 Concreting in Cold Weather: Do not place concrete when the air
 temperature at placement is below 40ºF.
 Meet the air temperature requirements for mixing and placing concrete in
 cold weather as specified in Section 346. During the curing period, if NOAA predicts the
 ambient temperature to fall below 35ºF for 12 hours or more or to fall below 30ºF for more than
 4 hours, enclose the structure in such a way that the air temperature within the enclosure can be
 kept above 50ºF for a period of 3 days after placing the concrete or until the concrete reaches a
 minimum compressive strength of 1,500 psi.
 Assume all risks connected with the placing and curing of concrete.
 Although the Engineer may give permission to place concrete, the Contractor is responsible for
 satisfactory results. If the placed concrete is determined to be unsatisfactory, remove, dispose of,
 and replace the concrete at no expense to the Department.
 400-7.1.2 Concreting in Hot Weather: Meet the temperature requirements and
 special measures for mixing and placing concrete in hot weather as specified in Section 346.
 Spray reinforcing bars and metal forms with cool fresh water just prior to
 placing the concrete in a method approved by the Engineer.
 Assume all risks connected with the placing and curing of concrete.
 Although the Engineer may give permission to place concrete, the Contractor is responsible for
 satisfactory results. If the placed concrete is determined to be unsatisfactory, remove, dispose of,
 and replace the concrete at no expense to the Department.
 400-7.1.3 Wind Velocity Restrictions: Do not place concrete for bridge decks if
 the forecast of average wind velocity at any time during the planned hours of concrete placement
 exceeds 15 mph. Obtain weather forecasts from the National Weather Service “Hourly Weather
 Graph” for the city closest to the project site.
 400-7.2 Lighting Requirements: Provide adequate lighting for all concrete operations
 conducted at night. Obtain approval of the lighting system prior to starting the concrete
 operations.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 385
 
 400-7.3 Inspections before Placing Concrete: Do not place concrete until the depth and
 character of the foundation and the adequacy of the forms and falsework have been approved by
 the Engineer. Do not deposit any concrete until all reinforcement is in place and has been
 inspected and approved by the Engineer.
 400-7.4 Exposure to Water: Do not expose concrete other than seal concrete in
 cofferdams to the action of water before final setting. Do not expose such concrete to the action
 of salt or brackish water for a period of seven days after placing the concrete. Protect the concrete
 during this period by keeping salt or brackish water pumped out of cofferdams.
 400-7.5 General Requirements for Placing Concrete: Deposit concrete as nearly as
 possible in its final position. Do not deposit large quantities at one point and then run or work it
 along the forms. Take special care to fill each part of the forms, to work coarse aggregate back
 from the face, and to force concrete under and around reinforcing bars without displacing them.
 Use a method and manner of placing concrete that avoids the possibility of
 segregation or separation of aggregates. If the Engineer determines that the quality of concrete as
 it reaches its final position is unsatisfactory, remove it and discontinue or adjust the method of
 placing until the Engineer determines that the quality of the concrete as placed is satisfactory.
 Use metal or metal-lined open troughs, chutes, or other means of concrete
 conveyance which have no aluminum parts in contact with the concrete. As an exception, chutes
 made of aluminum for ready mixed concrete trucks, no longer than 20 feet, may be used. This
 exception does not apply to any other means of concrete conveyance. Where steep slopes are
 required, use chutes that are equipped with baffles or are in short lengths that reverse the
 direction of movement. Where placing operations would involve dropping the concrete freely
 more than 5 feet, deposit it through pipes, troughs, or chutes of sheet metal or other approved
 material. Use troughs, chutes, or pipes with a combined length of more than 30 feet only with the
 Department’s authorization. Keep all troughs, chutes, and pipes clean and free from coatings of
 hardened concrete by thoroughly flushing them with water after each run or more often if
 necessary.
 Place concrete against supporting material that is moist at the time of concrete
 placement. If additional water is required, uniformly apply it ahead of the concrete placement as
 directed by the Engineer. Do not place concrete on supporting material that is frozen. The
 Contractor may use a moisture barrier in lieu of controlling the foundation grade moisture when
 approved by the Engineer.
 400-7.6 Placing Concrete by Belt Conveyor: Place concrete by means of a belt
 conveyor system with written Department authorization. Remove conveyor belt systems which
 produce unsatisfactory results before continuing operations. Take concrete samples for assurance
 testing at the discharge end of the belt conveyor system. Make available to the Engineer the
 necessary platform to provide a safe and suitable place for sampling and testing. Remove any
 concrete placed in an unsatisfactory manner at no expense to the Department before continuing
 operations.
 Use conveyor belt systems that do not exceed a total length of 550 feet, measured
 from end to end of the total assembly. Arrange the belt assembly so that each section discharges
 into a vertical hopper arrangement to the next section. To keep segregation to a minimum, situate
 scrapers over the hopper of each section to remove mortar adhering to the belt and to deposit it
 into the hopper. Equip the discharge end of the conveyor belt system with a hopper and a chute or
 suitable deflectors to cause the concrete to drop vertically to the deposit area.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 386
 
 In order to avoid delays due to breakdowns, provide stand-by equipment with an
 alternate power source prior to the beginning of the placement.
 After the beginning of the placement, direct the discharge from the belt conveyor
 so that the concrete always falls on freshly placed concrete.
 400-7.7 Placing Concrete by Pumping: In general, use concrete pumping equipment
 that is suitable in kind and adequate in capacity for the work proposed. Use a pump discharge
 line that has a minimum diameter of 4 inches. Use a pump and discharge lines that are
 constructed so that no aluminum surfaces are in contact with the concrete being pumped. Operate
 the pump to produce a continuous stream of concrete, without air pockets. When using cement
 slurry or similar material to lubricate the discharge line when pumping begins, collect such
 material at the point of discharge. Dispose of the collected slurry in areas provided by the
 Contractor. Control the pump discharge locations so that the placement locations of the various
 LOTs of concrete represented by strength test cylinders can be identified in the event the test
 cylinders indicate deficient strength. When concrete is placed by pumping, take all test samples
 of concrete at the end of the discharge line, except in accordance with the provisions of
 Section 346.
 400-7.8 Consolidation: Consolidate the concrete by continuous working with a suitable
 tool in an acceptable manner, or by vibrating as set forth in 400-7.11. When not using vibrators,
 thoroughly work and compact all thin-section work with a steel slicing rod. Spade all faces, and
 flush the mortar to the surface by continuously working with a concrete spading implement.
 400-7.9 Obstructions: In cases where, because of obstructions, difficulty is encountered
 in puddling the concrete adjacent to the forms, bring the mortar content of the mix into contact
 with the interior surfaces by vibrating the forms. Produce the vibrations by striking the outside
 surfaces of the forms with wooden mallets or by other satisfactory means. In placing concrete
 around steel shapes place it only on one side of the shape until it flushes up over the bottom
 flange of the shape on the opposite side, after which place it on both sides to completion. After
 the concrete has taken its initial set, exercise care to avoid jarring the forms or placing any strain
 on the ends of projecting reinforcing bars.
 400-7.10 Requirements for Successive Layers: Place concrete in continuous horizontal
 layers, approximately 20 inches thick. To avoid obtaining a plane of separation or a cold joint
 between layers, vibrate the concrete in accordance with 400-7.11.
 400-7.11 Vibration of Concrete:
 400-7.11.1 General: Consolidate all concrete except seal, steel pile jackets, and
 concrete for incidental construction by the use of mechanical vibrators.
 400-7.11.2 Vibrators: Provide adequate vibrators on the project that are approved
 by the Engineer before beginning concrete work. Generally, provide vibrators of the internal
 type. For thin sections, where the forms are especially designed to resist vibration, the Contractor
 may use external vibrators. Use a vibrator with a minimum frequency of 4,500 impulses per
 minute with sufficient intensity and duration to cause complete consolidation of the concrete
 without causing segregation of the materials. For vibrating thin, heavily reinforced sections, use
 heads of such size to secure proper vibration of the concrete without disturbance of either the
 reinforcing bars or the forms.
 400-7.11.3 Number of Vibrators Required: Use a sufficient number of vibrators
 to secure the compaction of each batch before the next batch is delivered, without delaying the
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 387
 
 delivery. In order to avoid delays due to breakdowns, provide at least one stand-by vibrator, with
 an appropriate power source.
 400-7.11.4 Method of Vibration: Use vibrators to consolidate properly placed
 concrete. Do not use them to move concrete about in the forms. Insert the vibrators in the surface
 of concrete at points spaced to ensure uniform vibration of the entire mass of the concrete. Insert
 the vibrator at points that are no further apart than the radius over which the vibrator is visibly
 effective. Allow the vibrator to sink into the concrete by its own weight, and allow it to penetrate
 into the underlying layer sufficiently so that the two layers are thoroughly consolidated together.
 After thoroughly consolidating the concrete, withdraw the vibrator slowly to avoid formation of
 holes.
 400-7.11.5 Hand Spading: When necessary in order to secure well-filled forms,
 free from aggregate pockets, honeycomb, bubbles, etc., spade the concrete by hand, along the
 surfaces of the forms and in all corners, following the vibration.
 400-7.12 Columns: Place concrete in columns in one continuous operation for each lift
 as shown in the Plans.
 400-7.13 Slabs and Bridge Decks:
 400-7.13.1 Bulkheads, Screed Rails, and Screeding Devices: Strike-off the
 concrete using an approved metal screed operating on rails or bulkheads. Use devices which do
 not contain aluminum parts. Prior to placing concrete, provide an approved screed capable of
 striking-off and screeding the surface of the slab or deck to the required shape. Set all necessary
 bulkheads and screed rails to the required grade. Use bulkheads, screed rails, and screeding
 devices that permit vertical profile adjustment to the grade, satisfactory for providing straight
 transverse slopes, differing transverse slopes broken as shown in the Plans and/or transverse
 slopes with changing grade along the longitudinal length of slab or deck. Locate the screed rails
 so the entire placement surface can be screeded to grade without using intermediate screed rails,
 unless approved otherwise by the Engineer.
 Use a screed consisting of a truss or heavy beams that will retain it’s shape
 under all working conditions, and a set of rotating drums with a diameter sufficient to carry a
 2 inch mortar roll in front of and parallel to the axis of the drums, while making an initial pass.
 Adjust the drums to prevent mortar buildup forming behind the trailing edges of the drums. For
 long bridges, as defined in 400-15.2.5.1, provide a device that automatically smoothes the
 concrete surface to an untextured finish and that is attached to, and is moved by, the rolling drum
 screed. As an alternate to the drum type screed, a mechanical screed with a metal strike-off may
 be used. Equip the mechanical screed with mechanical vibrators to provide continuous uniform
 vibration to the entire length unless otherwise authorized by the Engineer. Small and irregularly
 shaped areas that cannot be mechanically screeded may be screeded in a manner approved by the
 Engineer.
 400-7.13.2 Screed Demonstration: Subsequent to the placement of all
 reinforcing bars and prior to placing any slab or deck concrete, demonstrate that the proposed
 equipment and methods can finish the concrete to the specified grades while maintaining the
 specified cover over the reinforcement. Provide the demonstration over the entire length and
 width of the spans to be placed.
 400-7.13.3 Screeding Operations: Perform concrete placement and screeding as
 independently controlled mechanical operations. Ensure that the passing of the screed and
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 388
 
 forward movement of the screeding equipment are independent of the movement of concrete
 placement equipment.
 Level the concrete in front of the screed as near to the finished grade as
 possible to prevent the screed from rising off the rail and forming uneven ridges behind the
 screed. Pass the screed over the slab or deck as many times as necessary to obtain a satisfactory
 surface and provide a concrete surface true to grade and crown, and free of irregularities.
 Do not add water to the concrete surface to assist in finishing operations
 unless specifically authorized by the Engineer. If the Engineer permits the addition of water,
 apply only a fog mist, above the concrete surface, by means of approved power driven spray
 equipment.
 For long bridges, as defined in 400-15.2.5.1, do not manually or
 mechanically float the concrete surface or apply a texture by broom or any other device to the
 concrete surface produced by the screeding process. Correct isolated surface irregularities in
 accordance with 400-15.2.5.3.
 400-7.13.4 Placing Operations: Select an approved concrete design mix which
 ensures complete placement of all slab or deck concrete between construction joints before initial
 set begins in the plastic concrete. On placements of 50 yd3 or less, the minimum placement rate is
 20 cubic yards per hour. On placements of greater than 50 cubic yards, the minimum placement
 rate is 30 cubic yards per hour.
 The Engineer will not permit slab or deck placements until an acceptable
 plan for meeting the minimum placement rate is approved.
 400-7.13.5 Concrete Decks on Steel Spans: Where concrete decks are placed on
 steel spans, release the temporary supports under the bridge before placing any concrete.
 400-7.13.6 Concrete Decks on T-Beams: For cast-in-place T-beam construction,
 cast the slabs and beams in one continuous operation. As an exception, where special shear
 anchorage or keys are provided for in the Plans or approved by the Engineer, the beams and slabs
 may be constructed in successive placements.
 400-7.13.7 Diaphragms: Place concrete diaphragms at least 48 hours before the
 bridge deck slabs are placed unless otherwise indicated in the Plans.
 400-7.13.8 Weather Protection: Provide an approved means of protecting
 unhardened concrete from rain. Position the protection system to shield the concrete from rain
 and running water. Provide a shield impervious to water over the slab or deck concrete, of
 sufficient size to protect all areas of slab or deck concrete subject to water damage, and include a
 means of intercepting and diverting water away from freshly placed concrete. Arrange the
 equipment so that the weather protection system can be erected over unhardened concrete. When
 there is a possibility of rain during concrete placement operations, place the weather protection
 system in stand-by readiness, capable of being deployed in a timely manner. Use the weather
 protection immediately when rain begins so that slab or deck concrete damage will not occur. Do
 not place concrete during rain.
 Assume responsibility for damage to the slab or deck in the case of failure
 of the weather protection system.
 400-7.14 Concrete Box Culverts: In general, place the base slab or footing of concrete
 box culverts, and allow them to set before constructing the remainder of the culvert. In this case,
 make suitable provision for longitudinal keys. Construct bottom slabs, footings, and apron walls
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 389
 
 as a monolith if practicable. Where transverse construction joints are necessary, place them at
 right angles to the culvert barrel, and make suitable provision for keys.
 In the construction of box culverts having walls 6 feet or less in height, the
 sidewalls and top slab may be constructed as a monolith or may place the concrete in the walls
 and allow it to set before placing the top slab concrete.
 Where the height of the box culvert walls exceed 6 feet, place the walls, and allow
 the concrete to set at least 12 hours before placing the top slab concrete. In such cases, form keys
 in the sidewalls.
 When casting the walls and top slabs of box culverts as a monolith, ensure that
 any necessary construction joints are vertical. Design all construction joints with formed keys.
 Provide keys that are beveled as shown in the Plans or as directed, but do not allow the edge of
 the beveled material forming the key to be less than 1 1/2 inches from the edge of the concrete.
 Construct each wingwall, if possible, as a monolith. Ensure that construction
 joints, where unavoidable, are horizontal and so located that no joints will be visible in the
 exposed face of the wing above the ground line.
 Precast box culvert sections may be used in lieu of cast-in-place box culvert
 construction provided the provisions in Section 410 are satisfied.
 400-8 Seals.
 400-8.1 General: Wherever practicable, dewater all foundation excavations, and deposit
 the concrete in the dry as defined in 455-15.2. Where conditions are encountered which render it
 impracticable to dewater the foundation before placing concrete, the Engineer may authorize the
 construction of a concrete foundation seal of the required size. Then, dewater the foundation, and
 place the balance of the concrete in the dry.
 When required to place seal concrete, the Contractor is responsible for the
 satisfactory performance of the seal in providing a watertight excavation for placing structural
 concrete. The Department will provide and pay for the seal concrete as an aid to the construction
 of the structure. Repair seal concrete as necessary to perform its required function at no expense
 to the Department.
 400-8.2 Method of Placing: Carefully place concrete deposited under water in the space
 in which it is to remain by means of a tremie, a closed-bottom dump bucket of not less than
 1 cubic yard capacity, or other approved method. Do not disturb the concrete after depositing it.
 Deposit all seal concrete in one continuous placement. Do not place any concrete in running
 water, and ensure that all form work designed to retain concrete under water is watertight.
 400-8.3 Use of Tremie: Use a tremie consisting of a tube having a minimum inside
 diameter of 10 inches, constructed in sections having water-tight joints. Do not allow any
 aluminum parts to have contact with the concrete. Ensure that the discharge end is entirely seated
 at all times, and keep the tremie tube full to the bottom of the hopper. When dumping a batch
 into the hopper, keep the tremie slightly raised (but not out of the concrete at the bottom) until
 the batch discharges to the bottom of the hopper. Stop the flow by lowering the tremie. Support
 the tremie such as to permit the free movement of the discharge end over the entire top surface of
 the work and to permit its being lowered rapidly when necessary to choke off or retard the flow.
 Provide a continuous, uninterrupted flow until completing the work. Exercise special care to
 maintain still water at the point of deposit.

 390
 
 400-8.4 Time of Beginning Pumping: Do not commence pumping to dewater a sealed
 cofferdam until the seal has set sufficiently to withstand the hydrostatic pressure, and in no case
 earlier than 72 hours after placement of the concrete.
 400-9 Construction Joints.
 400-9.1 Location: Make construction joints only at locations shown in the Plans or in the
 placement schedule, unless otherwise approved in writing. If not detailed in the Plans or
 placement schedule, or in case of emergency, place construction joints as directed.
 400-9.2 Provisions for Bond and Transmission of Shear: Use shear key reinforcement
 where necessary to transmit shear or to bond the two sections together.
 400-9.3 Preparations of Surfaces: Before depositing new concrete on or against
 concrete which has hardened, re-tighten the forms. Roughen the surface of the hardened concrete
 in a manner that will not leave loosened particles, aggregate, or damaged concrete at the surface.
 Thoroughly clean the surface of foreign matter and laitance, and saturate it with water.
 400-9.4 Placing Concrete: Continuously place concrete from joint to joint. Carefully
 finish the face edges of all joints which are exposed to view true to line and elevation.
 400-9.5 Joints in Sea Water or Brackish Water: For concrete placed in sea water or
 brackish water, do not place any construction joints between points 2 feet below the mean low
 water elevation and 6 feet above the mean high water elevation.
 400-9.6 Joints in Long Box Culverts: For long concrete box culverts, vertical
 construction joints may be placed at a spacing not less than 30 feet. When using transverse
 construction joints, ensure that longitudinal reinforcing is continuous through the joint and that
 the joint is vertical.
 400-9.7 Crack Control Grooves in Concrete Bridge Decks: When the Plans require
 crack control grooves in the top surface of decks, either install a tooled “V” groove prior to initial
 concrete set or saw a groove using an early entry dry cut saw. When using an early entry dry cut
 saw, operate in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. Commence sawing as
 soon as the concrete has hardened enough to permit standing on the surface without leaving
 visible tracks or impressions and before uncontrolled concrete cracks occur.
 400-10 Expansion Joints.
 400-10.1 General: After meeting the smoothness criteria in 400-15, construct expansion
 joints to permit absolute freedom of movement. Carefully remove all loose or thin shells of
 mortar likely to cause a spall with movement at a joint from all expansion joints as soon as
 possible.
 400-10.2 Sealed Joints: Fill expansion joints with a preformed joint filler. Cut the filler
 to conform to the cross-section of the structure, and furnish it in as few pieces as practicable,
 using only a single piece in each curb section. Do not use small pieces that would tend to come
 loose. Prepare joints to be sealed and apply the sealer in accordance with approved
 manufacturer’s directions.
 400-10.3 Joint System Installation: Install expansion joints before or after the deck
 planing required by 400-15.2.5.5 following the manufacturer’s instructions. When installed after
 deck planing, install the edge rail assemblies in the blockouts on a profile tangent between the
 ends of the deck and/or approach slab to within a plus 0 and minus1/4 inch variation.

 391
 
 When installed before deck planing, install the edge rail assemblies 3/8 inch, plus
 or minus 1/16 inch, below the top surface of the deck or approach slab to compensate for
 concrete removal during planing.
 400-11 Contact and Bearing Surfaces.
 400-11.1 Separation of Surfaces: In general, separate all contact surfaces between
 superstructure and substructure or end walls and between adjacent superstructure sections by a
 layer of ASTM D6380 Class S, Type III organic felt. When an organic felt bond breaker is
 specified for other structures, use either one layer of ASTM D6380 Class S, Type III or two
 layers of ASTM D226 Type II organic felt.
 400-11.2 Finishing of Bearing Surfaces: Construct bearings surfaces (areas) to the
 tolerances as specified herein and in the other parts of the Contract Documents. When using
 neoprene bearing pads, finish the concrete surface to a uniform ‘rough’ texture using a burlap
 drag, fine bristle broom or float. For metal or high load rotational bearings, fill minor
 depressions, 1/8 inch maximum, caused by finishing, bush hammering, or grinding with a lowviscosity epoxy meeting the requirements of 926-1, Type F-2, applied by the use of a squeegee.
 Bearing surfaces may be ground to final position with carborundum. Check all bearing surfaces
 with a metallic straightedge prior to setting bearings or neoprene pads.
 400-11.2.1 Deviation from Specified Elevations for Steel Beam
 Superstructures: Construct to the elevation shown on the Plans plus or minus 0.01 feet and do
 not exceed a 0.01 feet difference between specified elevations of bearing areas of adjacent
 bearings measured between the centerlines of bearing areas.
 400-11.2.2 Deviation from Specified Elevations for Concrete Beam
 Superstructures: Construct to the elevation shown on the Plans plus or minus 0.02 feet.
 400-11.2.3 Projecting Irregularities: Projecting irregularities will not exceed
 1/16 inch.
 400-11.2.4 Variations in Flatness for Neoprene Pads: In any direction, the pad
 is to be flat to within 1/16 inch. Pads designated to be sloped are not to deviate from the
 theoretical slope by the same amount.
 400-11.2.5 Variations in Flatness for Metal or High Load Rotational
 Bearings: Construct the bearing area to the tolerance indicated for the measured length along the
 orthogonal axes.
 Bearing area length up to 30 inches long to plus or minus 1/16 inch.
 Bearing area length over 30 inches up to 45 inches long to plus or minus
 3/32 inch.
 Bearing area length over 45 inches long to plus or minus 1/8 inch.
 400-11.3 Bearing Pads: Use bearing pads for seating bridge shoes, ends of beams, and
 slabs of the types specified or required in the Plans.
 Furnish and install neoprene pads as detailed in the Plans. Place neoprene pads,
 where specified or required, directly on concrete surfaces finished in accordance with the
 requirements of this Article. Ensure that pads, bearing areas of bridge seats, and metal bearing
 plates are thoroughly cleaned and free from oil, grease, and other foreign materials.
 Exercise care in fabrication of related metal parts to avoid producing conditions
 detrimental to the performance of the pads, such as uneven bearing, excessive bulging, etc.
 The Engineer will evaluate the degree of deformation and condition of bearing
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 392
 
 pads in the completed bridge on or before the final inspection required by 5-10 or when requested
 by the Contractor. As directed by the Engineer, correct horizontal bearing pad deformations that
 at the time of inspection exceed 50% of the bearing pad thickness or that the Engineer predicts
 will exceed 50% of the bearing pad thickness during future high or low temperature periods.
 Payment for this correction effort will be considered extra work in accordance with 4-3.
 400-12 Anchor Bolts and Dowels.
 Set anchor bolts and dowels as specified in Section 460.
 Galvanize all anchor bolts as specified in Section 962.
 400-13 Epoxy Bonding Compounds.
 Where epoxy bonding compounds for bonding concrete are specified or required, apply
 the epoxy bonding materials only to clean, dry, structurally sound concrete surfaces. Provide
 surface preparation, application, and curing of epoxy bonding compound in strict accordance
 with the manufacturer’s recommendations for each particular application. Use an epoxy bonding
 compound listed on the Department’s APL.
 400-14 Removal of Forms.
 Use the table below as the criterion for minimum time or compressive strength required
 before removal of forms or supports.
 When using the time period criterion, include in the time period all days except days in
 which the temperature falls below 40ºF.
 Use the specified 28-day minimum compressive strength value as stated in 346-3.1 for
 each Class of Concrete utilized.

 Curve) which can be used in lieu of multiple test cylinders to determine when percent of required
 strength has been met.
 Prior to curve use; obtain the Engineer’s approval of the S/T Curve and its supporting
 data. An approved testing laboratory may be used to provide this information with approval of
 the Engineer. Plot S/T Curves using at least three different elapsed times that begin once test
 cylinders are cast; however, one of the elapsed times must be prior to the Contractor’s intended
 form removal. Each elapsed time plotted must have a corresponding compressive strength
 computed by averaging the compressive strength of two test cylinders.
 Cure such test cylinders as nearly as practical in the same manner as the concrete in the
 corresponding structural component, and test them in accordance with ASTM C39 and
 ASTM C31. Perform cylinder casting, curing, and testing at no expense to the Department and
 under the observation of the Engineer. When the S/T Curve indicates a compressive strength
 equal to or greater than the percentage of specified strength shown in the table above for form
 removal, the Contractor may remove the forms. When the ambient air temperature falls 15ºF or
 more below the ambient air temperature that existed during development of a S/T Curve, use a
 S/T Curve that corresponds to the lower temperature and that is developed in accordance with
 this section.
 Do not remove forms at any time without the consent of the Engineer. Even when the
 Engineer provides consent to remove the forms, the Contractor is responsible for the work.
 400-15 Finishing Concrete.
 400-15.1 General Surface Finish (Required for All Surfaces): After placing and
 consolidating the concrete, strike-off all exposed surfaces to the lines and grades indicated in the
 Plans in a manner that will leave a surface of uniform texture free of undesirable surface
 irregularities, cavities, and other defects. Cut back metal ties supporting reinforcement, conduit,
 and other appurtenances a minimum of 1 inch from finished surface. After removing excess
 mortar and concrete and while the concrete is still in a workable state, carefully tool all
 construction and expansion joints. Leave joint filler exposed for its full length with clean edges.
 Ensure that finished work in addition to that specified above is compatible and complementary to
 the class of surface finish required.
 Remove all laitance, loose material, form oil and curing compound from exposed
 surfaces that do not require forming and from exposed surfaces requiring forming, after form
 removal. Remove fins and irregular projections flush with the surface. Clean, saturate with water,
 and fill all holes, tie cavities, honeycomb, chips and spalls. Prior to filling, prepare the surface to
 ensure that patching mortar will bond to the existing concrete. Exercise care during the
 roughening process to prevent excessive defacement and damage to the surface of the existing
 concrete. Use patching mortar blended from the mix ingredients of the existing concrete. Ensure
 the patching mortar closely matches the color of the existing concrete when fully cured. As an
 alternative, mortar consisting of the following materials may be used: 4 parts of ordinary gray
 portland cement, 1/2 part of white portland cement, 1 part of fly ash and 2 to 4 parts of sand. The
 blended mortar must closely match the color of the filled element once fully cured and the
 proportion of white portland cement may be adjusted to achieve as close a match as possible.
 Regardless of the type patching mortar used, provide a mortar surface closely resembling the
 existing surface.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 394
 
 Cure the newly placed mortar using a curing blanket or a Type I clear curing
 compound at a uniform coverage as recommended by the manufacturer, but not less than
 0.06 gallon per square yard.
 In the event unsatisfactory surfaces are obtained, repair these surfaces by methods
 approved by the Engineer or the affected concrete will be rejected. Repair any surface or remove
 rejected concrete at no expense to the Department.
 400-15.2 Surface Finishes:
 400-15.2.1 General: In addition to the general surface work specified for all
 exposed concrete surfaces, the Engineer may require one of the classes of surface finish listed
 below. For all such exposed surfaces, begin finish work for the applicable class specified, along
 with the general finish work, immediately after removal of the forms. In order to further ensure
 the required quality of the finish, remove forms no later than the minimum time specified for the
 forms to remain in place. Satisfactorily repair finished concrete surfaces which are subsequently
 disfigured or discolored at no expense to the Department.
 Provide the required class of surface finish for the various items of
 structural concrete as shown in the Plans.
 400-15.2.2 Class 1 Surface Finish: As soon as the pointing has sufficiently set,
 thoroughly saturate the exposed surfaces with water, and rub them with a medium coarse
 carborundum stone. Continue rubbing until the surface has been ground to a paste and remove all
 form marks, irregularities, and projections. In this process, do not introduce any additive material
 other than water. After the rubbing has produced a smooth surface of uniform color, allow the
 material which has been ground to a paste to reset under proper curing conditions. Subsequently,
 as a second operation, re-saturate the concrete surfaces with water, and thoroughly rub them with
 a fine carborundum stone. Continue this rubbing until the surface has a smooth, fine grain texture
 of uniform color.
 The Contractor may substitute a Class 5 applied finish coating in
 accordance with 400-15.2.6 as an alternate surface finish on all areas where Class 1 surface finish
 is specified.
 400-15.2.3 Class 2 Surface Finish: As soon as pointing has sufficiently set,
 thoroughly saturate the exposed concrete surfaces with water and rub them with a medium coarse
 carborundum stone. Continue rubbing until the surface has been ground to a paste and remove all
 form marks, irregularities, and projections. In this process, do not introduce any additive material
 other than water.
 After rubbing has produced a smooth surface finish, of uniform color,
 carefully brush the material which has been ground to a paste to a uniform texture, and allow it to
 reset under proper curing conditions. Carefully protect these surfaces from disfigurement and
 discoloration during subsequent construction operations.
 400-15.2.4 Class 3 Surface Finish: Where this surface finish is specified, use
 forms with a form liner. Where specified or required on the Plans, use No. 89 coarse aggregate
 for concrete.
 After concrete has been placed in the forms and compacted, finish all
 exposed surfaces which are not contained by the forms to produce a surface texture as nearly
 equal to that produced by the form as practicable. Generally, finish unformed surfaces to a
 smooth, dense surface with a steel trowel.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 395
 
 Perform all work, including general surface finish work, in a manner that
 will preserve the same surface texture and color produced by the form liner. Pointed areas may be
 rubbed with a dry carborundum stone.
 400-15.2.5 Class 4 Deck Finish:
 400-15.2.5.1 General: Apply a Class 4 finish on bridge decks and
 concrete approach slabs. On Short Bridges (bridges having a length less than or equal to
 100 feet), and on Miscellaneous Bridges (Pedestrian, Trail and Movable Spans) regardless of
 length, meet the finish and smoothness requirements of 400-15.2.5.2 and 400-15.2.5.4. On Long
 Bridges (bridges having a length greater than 100 feet) meet the finish and smoothness
 requirements of 400-15.2.5.3 and 400-15.2.5.5. When an existing bridge deck is widened, see the
 Plans for the finish and smoothness requirements of the existing bridge deck and its new widened
 section. After meeting the screeding requirements of 400-7.13 and curing requirements of 400-16
 and the smoothness requirements, herein, groove the bridge deck and approach slabs.
 Regardless of bridge length, finish decks with less than
 2 1/2 inches of top cover in accordance with the requirements for Short Bridges.
 400-15.2.5.2 Plastic Surface Finish for Short and Miscellaneous
 Bridges: After screeding is completed, check the surface of the plastic concrete with a 10 foot
 straightedge, positioning and half-lapping the straightedge parallel to the centerline to cover the
 entire surface. Immediately correct deficiencies of more than 1/8 inch, measured as an ordinate
 between the surface and the straightedge.
 Finish the concrete surface to a uniform texture using a burlap
 drag, fine bristle broom or float. Finish the deck to a smooth surface having a sandy texture
 without blemishes, marks or scratches deeper than 1/16 inch.
 400-15.2.5.3 Plastic Surface Finish for Long Bridges: Do not moisten,
 manually float or apply texture to the concrete surface after the screed, with attached smoothing
 device, has passed unless correction of isolated surface irregularities is warranted and this should
 be done as soon as possible after screeding while the concrete is plastic. Correct all flaws such as
 cavities, blemishes, marks, or scratches that will not be removed by planing.
 If the Engineer permits the addition of water when correcting
 flaws, apply moisture to the concrete surface only if required and only in the immediate vicinity
 of the isolated irregularity. Apply a quantity of moisture not greater than what is needed to
 facilitate correction of the irregularity and apply only a fog mist, above the concrete surface, by
 power driven spray equipment approved by the Engineer.
 400-15.2.5.4 Smoothness Requirements for Short Bridges and
 Miscellaneous Bridges (including approach slabs): Perform a final straightedge check with a
 10 foot straightedge, positioning and half-lapping the straightedge parallel to the centerline,
 approximately 5 feet apart to cover the entire surface. Correct all irregularities greater than
 3/16 inch measured as an ordinate to the straightedge, by grinding. Perform grinding by the
 abrasive method using hand or power tools or by machine, to leave a smooth surface within a
 1/8 inch tolerance.
 400-15.2.5.5 Smoothness Evaluation and Concrete Surface Planing,
 Long Bridges (including approach slabs): Prior to planing, provide a smoothness evaluation of
 the completed bridge deck and exposed concrete surfaces of approach slabs by a computerized
 Cox California-type profilograph in accordance with the criteria herein and FM 5-558E. Furnish
 this evaluation through an independent provider approved by the Engineer, using equipment
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 396
 
 calibrated by the Engineer. All bridge deck and concrete approach slab surfaces to within 2 feet
 of gutter lines are subject to this smoothness evaluation.
 Prior to initial profilograph testing, complete work on the bridge
 deck and approach slabs. Thoroughly clean and clear the bridge deck and approach slab areas to
 be evaluated for smoothness of all obstructions and provide the smoothness evaluation. Ensure
 that no radio transmissions or other activities that might disrupt the automated profilograph
 equipment are allowed during the evaluation.
 Average the Profile Index Value for the bridge deck, including the
 exposed concrete surfaces of the approach slabs, for the left and right wheel path of each lane.
 The maximum allowable Profile Index Value for acceptable smoothness is 10 inches per mile
 utilizing the 0.2 inch blanking band. Apply these criteria to a minimum of 100 feet of each lane.
 Additionally, correct individual bumps or depressions exceeding a cutoff height of 0.3 inch from
 a chord of 25 feet (see ASTM E1274) on the profilograph trace. Ensure that the surface meets a
 1/4 inch in 10 feet straightedge check made transversely across the deck and approach slabs if
 determined necessary by the Engineer. Provide additional profilograph testing as necessary
 following longitudinal planing and any other actions taken to improve smoothness, until a profile
 meeting the acceptance criteria is obtained.
 Regardless of whether expansion joints are installed before or after
 deck planing is complete, plane off the concrete deck surface to a minimum depth of 1/4 inch and
 also meet or exceed the profilograph smoothness criteria. Longitudinally plane the entire bridge
 deck and exposed concrete surfaces of the approach slabs using a self-propelled planing machine
 with gang mounted diamond saw cutting blades specifically designed for such work. Use the
 profilograph generated smoothness data, to establish the optimum planing machine settings.
 Plane the deck surface to within 2 feet of the gutter line so that there is a smooth transition,
 without vertical faces or sudden surface discontinuities, from the fully planed surface to the
 unplaned surface. Use a machine with a minimum wheel base length of 15 feet, constructed and
 operated in such manner that it does not cause strain or damage to deck or approach slab
 surfaces, excessive ravels, aggregate fractures or spalling. The equipment shall be approved by
 the Engineer. Perform longitudinal planing parallel to the roadway centerline, and provide a
 consistent, textured surface. Clean the surface of all slurry/debris generated during this work
 concurrently with operation of the machine.
 After the deck has been planed the minimum 1/4 inch, reevaluate
 the surface smoothness using the profilograph testing described above. Perform cycles of planing
 and profilograph retesting as necessary until the deck and exposed concrete surfaces of approach
 slabs are in compliance with the smoothness criteria but do not exceed the maximum concrete
 removal depth of 1/2 inch.
 400-15.2.5.6 Grooving: After the concrete surface profile, as required by
 400-15.2.5, has been accepted by the Engineer, and prior to opening the bridge to traffic, groove
 the bridge deck and approach slabs perpendicular to the centerline of the structure. Do not groove
 the deck surface of pedestrian or trail bridges unless otherwise shown in the Contract Documents.
 Cut grooves into the hardened concrete using a mechanical saw device which will leave grooves
 nominally 1/8 inch wide and 3/16 inch deep. Space the grooves apart in random spacing center of
 grooves in the following sequence: 3/4 inch, 1-1/8 inch, 5/8 inch, 1 inch, 5/8 inch, 1-1/8 inch,
 3/4 inch in 6 inch repetitions across the width to be grooved in one pass of the mechanical saw
 device. One 6 inch sequence may be adjusted by 1/4 sequence increments to accommodate
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 397
 
 various cutting head widths provided the general pattern is carried out. The tolerance for the
 width of the grooves is plus 1/16 inch to minus 0 inch and the tolerance for the depth of grooves
 is plus or minus1/16 inch. The tolerance for the spacing of the grooves is plus or minus1/16 inch.
 Cut grooves continuously across the deck or approach slab to
 within 18 inches of gutter lines at traffic railing, curb line and median divider. At skewed metal
 expansion joints in bridge deck surfaces, adjust groove cutting by using narrow width cutting
 heads so that all grooves of the bridge deck surface or approach slab surface end within 6 inches,
 measured normal to centerline of the joint, leaving no ungrooved surface adjacent to each side of
 the joint greater than 6 inches in width. Ensure that the minimum distance to the first groove,
 measured normal from the edge of the concrete joint or from the junction between the concrete
 and the metal leg of the armored joint angle, is 1 inch. Produce grooves that are continuous
 across construction joints or other joints in the concrete surface less than 1/2 inch wide. Apply
 the same procedure described above where the gutter lines at traffic railing, curb lines and
 median dividers are not parallel to the centerline of the bridge to maintain the 18 inches
 maximum dimension from the grooves to the gutter line. Cut grooves continuously across formed
 concrete joints.
 400-15.2.6 Class 5 Applied Finish Coating:
 400-15.2.6.1 General: Place an applied finish coating upon all concrete
 surfaces where the Plans indicate Class 5 applied finish coating. Apply the finish coating after
 completion of the general surface work specified for all exposed concrete surfaces. Select an
 applied finish coating from the APL meeting the requirements of Section 975.
 400-15.2.6.2 Material: For the coating material, use a commercial product
 designed specifically for this purpose. Use only coating material that is manufactured by one
 manufacturer and delivered to the job site in sealed containers bearing the manufacturer’s
 original labels. Submit the manufacturer’s written instructions to the Engineer.
 400-15.2.6.3 Surface Preparation: Prepare the surface prior to the
 application of an applied finish coating by providing a surface finish in accordance with the
 requirements of 400-15.1. The Engineer will not require surface voids that are 1/4 inch or less in
 width and depth to be grouted prior to application of the finish coating. Fill surface void larger
 than 1/4 inch in width and depth an approved high strength, non metallic, non shrink grout
 meeting the requirements of Section 934, mixed and applied in accordance with the
 manufacturer’s recommendations. Apply the grout by filling the surface voids using burlap pads,
 float sponges, or other acceptable methods. As soon as the grout has taken its initial set, brush the
 surface to remove all loose grout, leaving the surface smooth and free of any voids. Ensure that
 the surface to be coated is free from efflorescence, flaking coatings, curing compound, dirt, oil,
 and other substances deleterious to the applied finish coating. Prior to application of the finish
 coating onto precast or cast-in-place concrete surfaces, test the concrete surface at 30 foot
 intervals for the presence of curing compound using one or two drops of muriatic acid placed on
 the concrete surface. If curing compound is present, there will be no reaction between the acid
 and the concrete. If there is no reaction, remove the compound by pressure washing the concrete
 surfaces. Prepare the surfaces in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations, and
 ensure that they are in a condition consistent with the manufacturer’s requirements. Clean
 surfaces of existing structures in accordance with 400-19.
 400-15.2.6.4 Application: Apply the finish coating utilizing a method
 recommended by the manufacturer. When applying the finish coating by spraying, supply heavy
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 398
 
 duty spray equipment capable of maintaining a constant pressure necessary for proper
 application. Mix and cure all coating materials in accordance with the manufacturer’s written
 instructions. Apply the finished coating at a rate of 50, plus or minus 10 square feet per gallon.
 400-15.2.6.5 Finished Product: Produce a texture of the completed finish
 coat that is generally similar to that of rubbed concrete. Ensure that the completed finished
 coating is tightly bonded to the structure and presents a uniform appearance and texture. If
 necessary, apply additional coats to produce the desired surface texture and uniformity.
 Upon failure to adhere positively to the structure without chipping,
 flaking, or peeling, or to attain the desired surface appearance, remove coatings entirely from the
 structure, and reapply the finish coating after surface preparation until achieving the desired
 finished product. Do not allow the average thickness of the completed finish coating to exceed
 1/8 inch.
 400-15.2.6.6 Material Tests and Certification: Before any portion of any
 shipment of finish coating is applied on the project, submit to the Engineer a certificate from the
 manufacturer attesting that the commercial product furnished conforms to the same formula as
 that previously subjected to the tests specified in Section 975. In addition, submit the following
 product analysis, obtained from the manufacturer, for each batch of the material used:
 1. Weight per gallon.
 2. Consistency (Krebs Units).
 3. Weight percent pigment.
 4. Weight percent vehicle solids.
 5. Infra-red spectra of vehicle solution.
 400-15.2.7 Final Straightedging for Surfaces to Receive Asphalt Concrete
 Surface: Test the slab surfaces of poured-in-place decks which are to be surfaced with an asphalt
 concrete wearing course for trueness with a 10 foot straightedge, as specified above. As an
 exception, correct only irregularities of more than 1/4 inch measured as an ordinate (either above
 or below the general contour of the surface). The Engineer will not require belting or brooming
 of slabs that are to be surfaced with an asphalt concrete wearing course. For curing, meet the
 requirements specified for other deck slabs.
 400-15.2.8 Finishing Bridge Sidewalks: Finish bridge sidewalks in accordance
 with the applicable requirements of Section 522.
 400-16 Curing Concrete.
 400-16.1 General: Cure cast-in-place and precast (non-prestressed) concrete as required
 herein for a minimum duration of 72 hours. If forms are loosened or removed before the 72 hour
 curing period is complete, expand the curing to cover these surfaces by either coating with curing
 compound or extending the continuous moist cure area.
 Until curing has begun, retain concrete surface moisture at all times by
 maintaining a surface moisture evaporation rate less than 0.1 pound per square foot per hour.
 Periodically, at the site of concrete placement prior to and during the operation, measure the
 ambient air temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity with industrial grade weather
 monitoring instruments to determine the on-site evaporation rate. If the evaporation is, or is
 likely to become 0.1 pound per square foot per hour or greater, employ measures to prevent
 moisture loss such as application of evaporation retarder, application of supplemental moisture
 by fogging or reduction of the concrete temperature during batching. Compute the evaporation
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 399
 
 rate by using the nomograph in the ACI manual of Concrete Practice Part 2, Section 308R Guide
 to Curing Concrete, or by using an evaporation rate calculator approved by the Engineer.
 400-16.2 Methods: Except where other curing methods are specified, select from the
 following options the chosen method(s) for curing all concrete components.
 1. Continuous Moisture: Place burlap on the surface and keep it continuously
 saturated for the curing period by means of soaker hoses or automatic sprinklers. Water flow may
 be metered to cycle repetitively for five minutes on and five minutes off during the 72 hour
 curing period. Do not apply moisture manually. If side forms are loosened or removed during the
 curing period, extend the burlap so as to completely shield the sides of the members.
 2. Membrane Curing Compound: Apply a white Type 2 curing compound to all
 surfaces at a uniform coverage as recommended by the manufacturer but not less than 0.06 gallon
 per square yard. Allow surfaces covered by the membrane curing compound to remain
 undisturbed for the curing period. Recoat any cracks, checks or other defects in the membrane
 seal which are detected during the curing period within one hour. If side forms are loosened
 during the curing period, maintain surface moisture and remove the forms within one hour and
 immediately coat the formed surfaces with a membrane curing compound. Bottom surfaces shall
 be similarly coated after removal of or from the forms.
 If curing compound is to be applied by spraying, use a compressor driven
 sprayer of sufficient size to provide uniform mist. Standby equipment is required in case of
 mechanical failure and hand held pump-up sprayers may be used only as standby equipment.
 3. Curing Blankets: Curing blankets may be used for curing the top surfaces of
 members while the member side forms remain in place. Do not use curing blankets which have
 been torn or punctured. Securely fasten all edges to provide as tight a seal as practical. Should the
 system fail to maintain a moist condition on the concrete surface, discontinue use of the blankets
 and continue curing using another method. Keep curing blankets in place for the duration of the
 curing period.
 4. Accelerated Cure:
 a. General: Accelerated curing of the concrete can be achieved by use of
 either low pressure steam curing, radiant heat curing or continuous moisture and heat curing. If
 accelerated curing is completed before the 72 hour curing period has elapsed, continue curing for
 the remaining part of the 72 hour curing period in accordance with one of the curing methods
 listed above.
 If accelerated curing is used, furnish temperature recording devices
 that will provide accurate, continuous and permanent records of the time and temperature
 relationship throughout the entire curing period. Provide one such recording thermometer for
 each 200 feet of placement length or part thereof. Initially calibrate recording thermometers and
 recalibrate at least annually.
 The preheating period shall equal or exceed the time of initial set
 as determined by ASTM C403 and shall not be less than 4 hours. When the ambient air
 temperature is above 50ºF, allow the member to remain undisturbed in the ambient air for the
 preheating period. If the ambient air temperature is below 50ºF, apply heat during the preheating
 period to hold the air surrounding the member at a temperature of 50 to 90ºF.
 To prevent moisture loss from exposed surfaces during the
 preheating period, enclose members as soon as possible after casting or keep the surfaces wet by
 fog mist or wet blankets. Use enclosures for heat curing that allow free circulation of heat about
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 400
 
 the member with a minimum moisture loss. The use of tarpaulins or similar flexible covers may
 be used provided they are kept in good repair and secured in such a manner to prevent the loss of
 heat and moisture. Use enclosures that cover the entire placement.
 During the application or removal of the heat, do not allow the
 temperature rise or fall within the enclosure to exceed 40ºF per hour. Do not allow the curing
 temperature throughout the enclosure to exceed 160ºF. Maintain the curing temperature within a
 temperature range of 130 to 160ºF until the concrete has reached the required form removal
 strength for precast and cast-in-place components or the required release strength for prestressed
 concrete components.
 b. Low-Pressure Steam: The steam used shall be in a saturated condition.
 Do not allow steam jets to impinge directly on the concrete, test cylinders, or forms. Cover
 control cylinders to prevent moisture loss and place them in a location where the temperature is
 representative of the average temperature of the enclosure.
 c. Curing with Radiant Heat: Apply radiant heat by means of pipes
 circulating steam, hot oil or hot water, or by electric heating elements. Do not allow the heating
 elements to come in direct contact with the concrete or the forms. Distribute sources of heat in a
 manner that will prevent localized high temperatures above 160ºF. To prevent moisture loss
 during curing, keep the exposed surfaces wet by fog mist or wet blankets.
 d. Continuous Moisture and Heat: This method consists of heating the
 enclosure in combination with the continuous moisture method described above.
 In addition to the curing blankets, an auxiliary cover for retention
 of the heat will be required over the entire placement. Support this cover at a sufficient distance
 above the placement being cured to allow circulation of the heat.
 400-16.3 Silica Fume Concrete: Cure silica fume concrete a minimum of 72 hours using
 continuous moisture cure. No substitution of alternative methods nor reduction in the time period
 is allowed. After completion of the 72 hour curing period, apply a membrane curing compound
 to all concrete surfaces. Apply curing compound according to 400-16.2.
 400-16.4 Bridge Decks and Approach Slabs: Cure bridge decks and approach slabs for
 a duration of seven days. Apply a membrane curing compound to the top surface in accordance
 with 400-16.2 using a compressor driven sprayer. In general, apply curing compound when the
 surface is damp and after all pooled water has evaporated. For Short bridges, begin applying
 curing compound immediately after the initially placed concrete has been floated, straightedged,
 textured and a damp surface condition exists and continue applying compound as concrete
 placement progresses with as little interruption as possible until the entire top surface has been
 coated with compound. For Long bridges, begin applying curing compound to the initially placed
 concrete as soon as a damp surface condition exists and continue applying compound as concrete
 placement progresses with as little interruption as possible until the entire top surface has been
 coated with compound. For all bridges, the elapsed time between the initial placement of deck or
 approach slab concrete and the completed application of curing compound must not exceed
 120 minutes. The 120 minute limit may be extended by the Engineer if project specific factors
 (cool temperatures, high humidity, retarding admixtures, etc.) prolong wet surface conditions.
 Prior to the first deck or approach slab placement, submit to the Engineer the
 method that will be used to periodically measure the rate of application of curing compound in,
 gallons per square foot as the concrete placement progresses. Prior to the placement of each deck
 or approach slab, submit to the Engineer the anticipated quantity of curing compound in gallons

 401
 
 along with the corresponding square feet of concrete to be covered to meet the coverage rate in
 400-16.2. Compute the actual quantity of curing compound applied at the conclusion of each
 concrete placement and submit the quantity to the Engineer. Apply the curing compound from a
 work platform.
 Place curing blankets on all exposed surfaces which are not formed as soon as
 possible with minimal effect on the surface texture. Place the curing blankets with sufficient
 overlapping seams to form an effective moisture seal. Before using curing blankets, mend tears,
 splits, or other damage that would make them unsuitable. Discard curing blankets that are not
 repairable. Wet all curing blankets immediately after satisfactorily placing them and maintain
 them in a saturated condition throughout the seven day curing period. Supply sufficient quantity
 of water meeting the requirements of Section 923 at the job site for wetting the blankets.
 Where a bridge deck or approach slab is to be subjected to walking, wheeling or
 other approved construction traffic within the seven day curing period, protect the curing
 blankets and the concrete surface from damage by placing wooden sheeting, plywood or other
 approved protective material in the travel areas.
 When the ends of the curing blankets are rolled back to permit screeding of
 adjacent concrete, keep the exposed surfaces wet throughout the period of exposure.
 Bridge deck bottom and side forms may be removed after 72 hours upon
 compliance with 400-14. Approach slab side forms may be removed after 72 hours. Apply
 membrane curing compound to all surfaces stripped of forms within one hour of loosening.
 Apply curing compound according to 400-16.2.
 400-16.5 Construction Joints: Cure construction joint areas using either the continuous
 moisture or curing blankets method.
 400-16.6 Concrete Barriers, Traffic Railings, Parapets and End Post: Ensure
 concrete is cured in accordance with 400-16.2(2), except that a clear Type 1-D curing compound
 that must contain a fugitive dye may be used in lieu of Type 2. If Type 1-D is used, its removal
 per 400-15.1 during finishing is not required. When construction is by the slip form method, coat
 all concrete surfaces with a curing compound that meets the requirements of 925-2, either within
 30 minutes of extrusion or before the loss of water sheen, whichever occurs first. Ensure a curing
 compound coating period of not less than seven days after application. Prior to each concrete
 placement, submit to the Engineer the method that will be used to periodically measure the rate
 of application in gallons per square foot. Also, prior to each placement, submit to the Engineer
 the anticipated quantity of curing compound in gallons that will be used to meet the coverage rate
 specified in 400-16.2 along with the corresponding square footage of concrete barriers, traffic
 railings, parapets and end posts to be coated with that quantity. Measure the actual quantity of
 curing compound that is applied during each concrete placement and submit the quantity to the
 Engineer. Applied finish coatings, that are on the APL and that are flagged as permitted for use
 as a curing compound, may be used in lieu of a curing compound. If an applied finish coating is
 used in lieu of a curing compound, have a backup system that is in full compliance with 40016.2(2) available at all times to ensure that an effective alternative system will be immediately
 available if the applied finish coating cannot be applied within 30 minutes of extrusion or before
 the loss of water sheen.
 400-16.7 Removal of Membrane Curing Compounds: Provide the longest possible
 curing duration; however, remove curing compound on portions of members to be bonded to
 other concrete. Compounds may be removed by either sand or water blasting. Water blasting

 requires the use of water meeting the requirements of Section 923 and a minimum nozzle
 pressure of 2,900 psi.
 400-17 Protection of Concrete.
 400-17.1 Opening to Traffic: Do not open concrete bridge decks, approach slabs, or
 culverts to traffic for at least 14 days after concrete placement. During placement operations,
 concrete may be wheeled across previously placed slabs after they have set for 24 hours and
 plank runways are used to keep the loads over the beams.
 400-17.2 Storing Materials on Bridge Slabs: Do not store heavy equipment or material,
 other than light forms or tools, on concrete bridge slabs or approach slabs until 14 days after they
 have been placed. Obtain approval from the Engineer prior to storing materials, tools or
 equipment on bridge decks at any time. Disperse any such loads to avoid overloading the
 structure.
 400-17.3 Time of Placing Superstructure: Do not place the weight of the superstructure
 or beams on concrete substructure elements for at least 10 days after placement.
 400-17.4 Alternate Procedure: As an alternative to the time delay periods set forth in
 400-17.1 and 400-17.3, test cylinders may be prepared and tested by the Contractor in accordance
 with 346-5 and a determination made using one of the following methods:
 1. When the cylinder test results indicate the minimum 28 day compressive
 strength shown in the Plans, concrete bridge decks, approach slabs, and culverts may be opened
 to traffic or the superstructure and beams may be placed on caps.
 2. Submit signed and sealed calculations, prepared by a Specialty Engineer,
 demonstrating that the concrete caps can safely support the weight of the girders for the current
 concrete strength to the Engineer for approval.
 In any event, comply with the curing provisions of 400-16.
 400-18 Precast Planks, Slabs, and Girders.
 400-18.1 General: Where so shown in the Contract Documents, the Contractor may
 construct concrete planks, slabs, girders, and other structural elements by precasting. In general,
 use a method that consists of casting structural elements in a casting yard, curing as specified in
 400-16, transporting them to the site of the work, installing them on previously prepared supports
 and, where so shown in the Plans, joining them with poured-in-place slabs or keys. Handle and
 install precast prestressed members as specified in Section 450.
 400-18.2 Casting: Cast precast elements on unyielding beds or pallets. Use special care
 in casting the bearing surfaces on both the elements and their foundations in order that these
 surfaces shall coincide when installing the elements. Check bearing surfaces on casting beds with
 a level and a straightedge prior to the casting. Similarly check corresponding surfaces on the
 foundations during finishing operations.
 400-18.3 Poured-in-Place Keys: Where precast elements are to be joined with pouredin-place keys, carefully align the elements prior to pouring the keys.
 400-18.4 Surface Finish: Finish the surface as specified in 400 15, except that where
 precast slabs and poured-in-place keys form the riding surface, give the entire surface a broomed
 finish.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 403
 
 400-18.5 Moving, Placing, and Opening to Traffic: Reinforced precast members may
 be moved from casting beds, placed in the structure, and opened to traffic at the ages shown in
 the following table:
 Handling from casting beds to storage areas............... 7 days
 Placing in structure ................................................... 14 days
 Opening to traffic:
 Precast elements ........................................................ 14 days
 Cast-in-place slabs over precast girders .................... 14 days
 Cast-in-place keys joining precast slabs ..................... 7 days
 As an alternate procedure, in lieu of the time delay periods set forth above, test
 beams may be cast from representative concrete, and cure them identically with the concrete in
 the corresponding structural component. Test the test beams in accordance with ASTM C31 and
 ASTM C78. When the test results indicate a flexural strength of 550 psi, or more, any of the
 operations listed above may proceed without completing the corresponding time delay period.
 400-18.6 Setting Prestressed Slabs: Before permitting construction equipment on the
 bridge to erect slab units, submit sketches showing axle loads and spacing and a description of
 the intended method of setting slab units to the Engineer for approval. Do not use axle loads,
 spacing, and methods of setting which produce stresses in the slab units greater than the
 allowable stress.
 400-18.7 Protection of Precast Elements: The Contractor is responsible for the safety of
 precast elements during all stages of construction. The Engineer will reject any precast elements
 that become cracked, broken, seriously spalled, or structurally impaired. Remove rejected precast
 elements from the work at no expense to the Department.
 400-18.8 Form Material: Form material used to form hollow cores may be left in place.
 Ensure that the form material is neutral with respect to the generating of products harmful to the
 physical and structural properties of the concrete. The Contractor is responsible for any
 detrimental effects resulting from the presence of the form material within the precast element.
 400-19 Cleaning and Coating Concrete Surfaces of Existing Structures.
 For the purposes of this article, an existing structure is one that was in service prior to the
 start of the project to which this specification applies. For existing structures, clean concrete
 surfaces that are designated in the Contract Documents as receiving Class 5 applied finish
 coating by pressure washing prior to the application of coating. Use pressure washing equipment
 producing a minimum working pressure of 2,500 psi when measured at or near the nozzle. Do
 not damage or gouge uncoated concrete surfaces or previously coated concrete surfaces during
 cleaning operations. Remove all previously applied coating that is no longer adhering to the
 concrete or that is peeling, flaking or delaminating. Ensure that after the pressure wash cleaning
 and the removal of non-adherent coating, that the cleaned surfaces are free of efflorescence,
 grime, mold, mildew, oil or any other contaminants that might prevent proper adhesion of the
 new coating. After cleaning has been successfully completed, apply Class 5 Applied Finish
 Coating in accordance with 400-15.2.6 or as otherwise specified in the Plans.
 400-20 Approach Slabs.
 Construct approach slabs at the bridge ends in accordance with the applicable
 requirements of Section 350 using Class II (Bridge Deck) concrete. Place the reinforcement as
 specified in 350-7 and Section 415.

 400-21 Disposition of Cracked Concrete.
 400-21.1 General: The disposition of cracked concrete is described in this Article and
 applies to all cast-in-place concrete members, and once installed, to the precast and prestressed
 concrete members that are produced in accordance with 410, 450, 521, 534, 548 and 641.
 400-21.2 Investigation, Documentation and Monitoring: The Engineer will inspect
 concrete surfaces as soon as surfaces are fully visible after casting, with the exception of surfaces
 of precast concrete products produced in offsite plants, between 7 and 31 days after the
 component has been burdened with full dead load, and a minimum of 7 days after the bridge has
 been opened to full unrestricted traffic. The Engineer will measure the width, length and depth of
 each crack and establish the precise location of the crack termination points relative to permanent
 reference points on the member. The Engineer will determine if coring of the concrete is
 necessary when an accurate measurement of crack depth cannot be determined by use of a
 mechanical probe. The Engineer will monitor and document the growth of individual cracks at an
 inspection interval determined by the Engineer to determine if cracks are active or dormant after
 initial inspection. The Engineer will perform all final bridge deck crack measurements once the
 deck is free of all debris and before transverse grooves are cut and after planing is complete for
 decks that require planing.
 Provide the access, equipment and personnel needed for the Engineer to safely
 perform this work at no expense to the Department. Core cracks for use by the Engineer in
 locations and to depths specified by the Engineer at no expense to the Department.
 400-21.3 Classification of Cracks: The Engineer will classify cracks as either
 nonstructural or structural. In general, nonstructural cracks are cracks 1/2 inch or less deep from
 the surface of the concrete; however, the Engineer may determine that a crack greater than
 1/2 inch deep is nonstructural. In general, structural cracks are cracks that extend deeper than
 1/2 inch. As an exception, all cracks in concrete bridge decks that are supported by beams or
 girders will be classified as nonstructural and repair will be in accordance with 400-21.5.1.
 However, if the Engineer determines that repair under 400-21.5.1 is unacceptable, repair in
 accordance with 400-21.5.2.
 A crack that is fully or partially underwater at any time during its service life will
 be classified as a structural crack unless the Environment note on the General Notes sheet in the
 Plans categorizes the substructure as slightly aggressive, in which case, the nonstructural crack
 criteria may apply as determined by the Engineer.
 Review and comment on the Engineer’s crack classification; however, the
 Engineer will make the final determination.
 400-21.4 Nonstructural Cracking Significance: The Engineer will determine the
 Cracking Significance. The Cracking Significance will be determined on the basis of total crack
 surface area as a percentage of total concrete surface area. Cracking significance will be
 categorized as Isolated, Occasional, Moderate or Severe according to the criteria in Tables 1 and
 2. Cracking Significance will be determined on a LOT by LOT basis. A LOT will typically be
 made up of not more than 100 square feet and not less than 25 square feet of concrete surface
 area for structures other than bridge decks or typically not more than 400 square feet or not less
 than 100 square feet for bridge decks. A LOT will not extend beyond a single Elevation Range as
 shown in Table 1 or 2.
 Review and comment on the Engineer’s determination of Cracking Significance;
 however, the Engineer will make the final determination.

 400-21.5 Repair Method: Repair or remove and replace cracked concrete as directed by
 the Engineer. Additional compensation or time will not be granted for repair or removal and
 replacement of cracked concrete when the Engineer determines the cause to be the responsibility
 of the Contractor.
 400-21.5.1 Nonstructural Cracks: Repair each crack using the method as
 determined by the Engineer for each LOT in accordance with Table 1 or 2. When further
 investigation is required to determine repair or rejection, submit an Engineering Analysis Scope
 in accordance with 6-4, signed and sealed by a Specialty Engineer, to determine the strength and
 durability of the proposed repair. Upon approval of the Engineering Analysis Report (EAR) and
 final determination of the Engineer, repair or remove and replace the cracked concrete in
 accordance with the EAR.
 400-21.5.2 Structural Cracks: Submit an Engineering Analysis Scope in
 accordance with 6-4, signed and sealed by the Contractor’s Engineer of Record, to determine the
 strength and durability of the proposed repair.. Upon approval of the EAR and final
 determination of the Engineer, repair or remove and replace the cracked concrete in accordance
 with the approved EAR.

 (1) Cracking Significance Range is determined by computing the ratio of Total Cracked Surface Area (TCSA) to Total Surface Area
 (TSA) per LOT in percent [(TCSA/TSA) x 100] then by identifying the Cracking Significance Range in which that value falls.
 TCSA is the sum of the surface areas of the individual cracks in the LOT. The surface area of an individual crack is determined by
 taking width measurements of the crack at 3 representative locations and then computing their average which is then multiplied by
 the crack length.
 (2) Crack Width Range is determined by computing the width of an individual crack as computed in (1) above and then identifying the
 range in which that individual crack width falls.
 (3) When the Engineer determines that a crack in the 0.004 inch to 0.008 inch width range cannot be injected then for Table 1 use
 penetrant sealer unless the surface is horizontal, in which case, use methacrylate if the manufacturer's recommendations allow it to
 be used and if it can be applied effectively as determined by the Engineer.
 (4) (a) Perform epoxy injection of cracks in accordance with Section 411. Seal cracks with penetrant sealer or methacrylate as per
 Section 413. (b) Use only methacrylate or penetrant sealer that is compatible, according to manufacturer's recommendations, with
 previously applied materials such as curing compound or paint or remove such materials prior to application.
 (5) When possible, prior to final acceptance of the project, seal cracks only after it has been determined that no additional growth will
 occur.
 (6) Methacrylate shall be used on horizontal surfaces in lieu of penetrant sealer if the manufacturer's recommendations allow it to be
 used and if it can be applied effectively as determined by the Engineer.
 (7) Unless directed otherwise by the Engineer, repair cracks in bridge decks only after the grinding and grooving required by 40015.2.5 is fully complete.
 
 400-22 Method of Measurement.
 400-22.1 General: The quantities of concrete to be paid for will be the volume, in cubic
 yards, of each of the various classes shown in the Plans, in place, completed and accepted. The
 quantity of precast anchor beams to be paid for will be the number in place and accepted. The
 quantity of bridge deck grooving to be paid for will be the area, in square yards of bridge deck
 and approach slab, completed and accepted. The quantity of bridge deck grooving and planing to
 be paid for will be the area, in square yards of bridge deck and approach slab, completed and
 accepted.
 Except for precast anchor beams, for any item of work constructed under this
 Section and for which measurement for payment is not to be made by the volume of concrete,
 measurement and payment for such work will be as specified in the Section under which the
 work is specified in detail.
 No separate payment will be made for obtaining the required concrete finish.
 400-22.2 Calculation of Volume of Concrete:
 400-22.2.1 Dimensions: The quantity will be computed by the plan dimensions of
 the concrete, within the neat lines shown in the Plans, except that no deduction will be made for
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 410
 
 weep holes, deck drains, or encroachment of inlets and pipes in box culverts, and no chamfers,
 scorings, fillets, or radii 1 1/2 in2 or less in cross-sectional area will be taken into account.
 400-22.2.2 Pay Quantity: The quantity to be paid for will be the original plan
 quantity, measured as provided in 400-22.2.1, except that where the Plans call for an estimated
 quantity of miscellaneous concrete for contingent use, the contingent concrete will be measured
 as the actual quantity in place and accepted.
 400-22.2.3 Items not Included in Measurement for Payment: No
 measurements or other allowances will be made for work or material for forms, falsework,
 cofferdams, pumping, bracing, expansion-joint material, etc. The volume of all materials
 embedded in the concrete, such as structural steel, pile heads, etc., except reinforcing bars or
 mesh, will be deducted when computing the volume of concrete to be paid for. For each foot of
 timber pile embedded, 0.8 cubic feet of concrete will be deducted. The cost of furnishing and
 placing dowel bars shall be included in the Contract unit price for the concrete.
 400-22.2.4 Deck Girders and Beam Spans: In computing the volume of
 concrete in deck girders and beam spans, the thickness of the slab will be taken as the nominal
 thickness shown on the drawings and the width will be taken as the horizontal distance measured
 across the roadway. The volume of haunches over beams will be included in the volume to be
 paid for.
 400-22.2.5 Stay-in-Place Metal Forms: When using stay-in-place metal forms to
 form the slab of deck girder and beam spans, the volume of concrete will be computed in
 accordance with the provisions of 400-22.2.4 except that the thickness of the slab over the
 projected plan area of the stay-in-place metal forms will be taken as the thickness shown on the

 Design and construct a three-sided precast concrete culvert for the three-sided concrete
 culvert structure shown in the Contract Documents. Three-sided precast concrete culverts are
 defined as monolithic arched segments, frame segments with vertical walls and either horizontal
 or arched top slabs, or three-sided proprietary precast concrete bridge systems.
 Meet the requirements of 449-1.
 407-2 Materials.
 Ensure that the materials used for the construction of precast culverts have certification
 statements from each source, showing that they meet the applicable requirements of the
 following:
 Portland Cement Concrete ..............................................Section 346
 Reinforcing for Concrete ................................................Section 415
 Precast Concrete Drainage Products ...............................Section 449
 Riprap ..............................................................................Section 530
 Coarse Aggregate* ..........................................................Section 901

 *The gradation requirements of aggregates are not applicable when using dry-cast
 concrete.
 407-3 Limitations on Use.
 Do not use three-sided precast culverts in lieu of four-sided culverts described in
 Section 410, however they may be considered as a Cost Savings Initiative Proposal (CSIP) in
 accordance with Section 4. Provide the required Section 346 concrete class and concrete cover in
 accordance with the Structures Design Guideline for the environmental classification shown in
 the Plans for the culvert location. Do not use a three-sided precast culvert to extend the inlets of
 existing multi-cell culverts due to the potential for clogging with debris.
 407-4 Materials Acceptance and Testing.
 407-4.1 General: Meet concrete materials, testing, inspection, and acceptance
 requirements of Section 346, as modified herein:
 Precast culverts are produced using certification-acceptance criteria; therefore,
 assume responsibility for performance of all quality control testing and inspections in accordance
 with Section 346.
 Prepare, cure, and test the test cylinders in accordance with ASTM C31 and
 ASTM C39 test methods. Follow the alternative method of concrete compaction, in accordance
 with ASTM C497, if the consistency of concrete is too stiff for compaction by rodding or
 internal vibrations. Expose shipping strength test cylinders to the same curing conditions as the
 precast concrete sections. The 28-day test cylinders shall be cured in accordance with
 Section 346.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 414
 
 346-9.2.
 
 Perform all concrete quality control testing and inspections in accordance with
 
 For training and other qualifications meet the requirements of Section 105. Test
 all QC samples for compressive strength in a laboratory meeting the requirements of
 Section 105.
 407-4.2 Quality Assurance Inspection and Testing: The Engineer will perform
 periodic inspections, sampling, and testing to ensure of the quality and acceptability of the
 materials, methods, techniques, procedures and processes being utilized by the manufacturing
 facility in the fabrication of precast concrete culverts.
 407-4.3 Special Requirements for Dry-Cast Concrete: Dry-cast concrete is defined as
 a very low slump concrete that requires continuous and intense vibration to compact the
 concrete, enabling immediate removal of the side forms without detrimental effects to the
 concrete when used in a dry-cast manufacturing process.
 The target slump and air content ranges in Table 2 in Section 346 and the plastic
 property tolerances in Table 6 in Section 346 are not applicable to dry-cast concrete.
 Perform absorption tests on specimens from each LOT of dry-cast production in
 accordance with the test methods in ASTM C497. The absorption of each specimen must not
 exceed 9.0% of the dry mass for Test Method A procedure or 8.5% for Test Method B
 procedure. All specimens must be free of visible cracks and must represent the full thickness of
 the product. Test specimens after 28 days of standard curing or prior to the date of shipping if the
 precast concrete culvert sections are to be shipped before the completion of the 28-day curing
 period.
 Core three specimens for Test Method B in accordance with ASTM C42 and meet
 the sampling location and size requirements of ASTM C497. Prepare or core a minimum of one
 specimen for Test Method A in accordance with the test cylinder requirements of ASTM C497.
 When the initial absorption specimen from a concrete culvert section fails to conform to the
 requirements of this Section, the absorption test may be made on another specimen from the
 same culvert section and the results of the retest may be substituted for the original test results
 for acceptance of the LOT. The manufacturer may test each concrete culvert section within a
 LOT and cull the culvert sections not meeting absorption requirements marking them as deficient
 with waterproof paint or other approved means. Deficient culvert sections must not be shipped to
 the project site. Reduce the frequency of absorption tests to one test every five LOTs when the
 results of five consecutive LOTs meet the specified limit.
 
 407-5 Design Requirements.
 Provide a design that complies with the requirements of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge
 Design Specifications and the Structures Design Guidelines. Perform a bridge load rating in
 accordance with the Structures Design Guidelines, for any design with a total span equal to or
 greater than 20 feet, when measured between the inside face of end supports, along the centerline
 of the roadway crossing. Submit design calculations, shop drawings and load rating for approval
 in accordance with Section 5. Ensure that the Contractor’s Engineer of Record performs the
 design of the precast culvert and signs and seals the design plans, calculations and load rating.
 When the channel lining design is not provided in the Contract Documents or must be
 redesigned, submit a hydraulic analysis and scour evaluation, signed and sealed, by the
 Contractor’s Engineer of Record.
 Line the channel between footings with either a 6 inch minimum thick cast-in-place
 reinforced concrete slab with a 30 inch minimum depth toe wall at the inlet and outlet end of the
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 415
 
 structure, or a blanket of revetment designed in accordance with the Department Drainage
 Manual. Use lining designed to withstand the hydraulic forces and extend the lining a minimum
 of 10 feet beyond the ends of the structure. A riprap rubble ditch lining with a minimum
 thickness of 18 inches will be permitted if the flow velocity corresponding to the Design Flood
 Scour Event does not exceed five feet per second. Filter fabric must be used in conjunction with
 any revetment in accordance with Section 985. Design and construct the connection between the
 revetment or concrete slab and the culvert footing, to prevent the migration of soil through the
 connection.
 Ensure that the bottoms of spread footings are a minimum of 30 inches below the bottom
 of the channel lining.
 407-6 Other Elements of a Precast Culvert System.
 Extend reinforcing from precast sections to provide adequate splice lengths or utilize a
 mechanical rebar splicing system (steel reinforcing only) listed on the Department’s Approved
 Product List (APL) for securing reinforcing dowels for cast-in-place headwalls and wingwalls.
 Precast headwalls, wingwalls and culvert footings are permitted. Precast culvert footings must
 span a minimum of three culvert units and provide shear connections between adjacent units with
 keyed joints or cast-in-place closure sections. Precast footings under wingwalls are not
 permitted.
 Submit all connection details for precast elements to the Engineer for approval. All
 mechanical connections must be galvanized in accordance with 962-7 or Type 316 (UNS
 S31600) stainless steel, except in extremely aggressive environments only Type 316L (UNS
 31603) stainless steel is permitted for welded connections and Type 316 stainless steel for nonwelded shapes and fasteners.
 Unless otherwise addressed in the Plans, bedding material and compaction requirements
 for wingwalls and toe walls shall be the same as required for the footing in 407-12, except that
 the granular material may be placed to the inside edge of the toe wall.
 All requirements of Section 400 and Section 415 apply to the fabrication of cast-in-place
 elements..
 407-7 Fabrication.
 407-7.1 Casting: Cast precast elements in unyielding beds and forms. Ensure bearing
 surfaces in casting forms are level and straight, and vertical surfaces are plumb prior to casting.
 Ensure surfaces within the forms, against which concrete will be cast, are clean and free from
 rust and hardened residual concrete. Provide full concrete cover clearance to all form wires and
 other miscellaneous pieces of metal, except as permitted by Section 415. Bend all tie wires away
 from the form surface to provide maximum concrete cover. Provide inserts and lifting devices in
 accordance with 450-9.2.1.
 407-7.2 Surface Finish: Finish the precast elements in accordance with 400-15.1.
 407-7.3 Curing: Perform the curing by any method prescribed in Sections 400 and 450,

 407-7.4.1 Internal Dimensions: Ensure the internal dimensions do not vary more
 than one percent or two inches, whichever is less, from the design dimensions, with a maximum
 of 3/4 inches. The haunch dimensions shall not vary more than 3/4 inches from the design
 dimensions.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 416
 
 407-7.4.2 Slab and Wall Thickness: Ensure the slab and wall thicknesses are not
 less than that shown in the design Plans or approved shop drawings by more than five percent or
 1/2 inches, whichever is greater. A thickness more than that required in the design will not be a
 cause for rejection.
 407-7.4.3 Length of Opposite Surfaces: Ensure the variations in laying lengths
 of two opposite surfaces of the culvert segments are not more than 3/4 inch, except where
 beveled ends for laying curves, or skewed ends are specified by the Engineer.
 407-7.4.4 Length of Section: Ensure the underrun in length of segments is not
 more than 1/8 inch per foot of length with a maximum of 1/2 inch in any culvert segment. The
 total underrun in length of the in-place precast culvert must not be less than 3 inches from the
 design length.
 407-7.4.5 Tongue and Groove Joints or Ends: Ensure the planes formed by the
 ends of precast culvert sections do not vary perpendicular from the joint axis by more than
 3/8 inches for internal spans or heights less than 15 feet, or more than 1/2 inches for internal
 spans or heights of 15 feet or greater.
 407-7.4.6 Position of Reinforcement: Meet the requirements of 415-5.10.2 for
 the maximum variation in the position of slab steel. Meet the requirements of 415-5.8.2 for the
 maximum variation of the wall steel, except that the concrete cover must not be less than
 1/4 inches nor more than 1/2 inches from the design dimensions.
 407-7.4.7 Area of Reinforcement: Provide the area of reinforcement as indicated
 in the Plans or approved shop drawings as a minimum. If welded wire reinforcement is utilized
 in lieu of mild steel reinforcement, the provisions of 415-6 shall apply. Reinforcing steel areas
 greater than specified in the shop drawings will be acceptable when the reinforcing spacing is
 equal or less than specified in the shop drawings. Substitution of mild steel or welded wire
 reinforcement for fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcing, or vice versa, is not permitted.
 407-7.5 Removal of Forms: Remove forms after the concrete has attained the minimum
 compressive strength requirements in the Producer QC Plan, but not less than 2500 psi. Products
 manufactured with dry-cast concrete, are exempt from this requirement.
 407-7.6 Lifting and Removal from Casting Area: Handle all products, including those
 manufactured by the dry-cast process, upon the concrete attaining sufficient compressive
 strength as determined by the manufacturer and included as part of the Producer QC Plan, but
 not less than 2500 psi. Limit the flexural stresses from handling to three times the square root of
 the specified 28-day strength.
 407-8 Joints.
 Produce precast units with keyways at the adjoining surfaces or with butt joints between
 adjacent units. In the keyways, use a non-shrink grout listed on the APL. Design and construct
 the adjoining surfaces so that when placed together, they make a continuous line of units with a
 smooth interior free of appreciable irregularities within the permissible variations given in
 Section 11 of ASTM C1504. Seal all joints between precast units with a bituminous seal or low
 modulus silicone sealant listed on the APL, and provide an external sealing band in accordance
 with ASTM C877 along the outside of the joint. Determine the minimum width of sealing bands
 by substituting the larger of the clear rise or span of the precast concrete box section, for the
 equivalent pipe diameter in ASTM C877 Tables 1 and 2. Install external sealing band wrap in
 accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Cover the external sealing band with a strip of
 filter fabric adhered to the precast unit. Ensure that the filter fabric strip is a minimum of
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 417
 
 24 inches wide and meets the requirements of Section 985. Obtain the Engineer’s approval of the
 adhesive used. Exercise care during backfilling to prevent damage to the filter fabric.
 Construct headwalls, wingwalls, and other special features in place or as detailed on the
 shop drawings. Leave sufficient steel exposed or utilize a mechanical rebar splicing system listed
 on the APL, in end units for connection of headwalls, wingwalls and other cast-in-place sections.
 407-9 Handling, Storage, and Shipping.
 Handle, store, and ship precast culverts in a manner that prevents chipping, cracks,
 fractures, and excessive bending stress. Do not ship precast culverts to the project site prior to
 the completion of the 72 hour curing period and attainment of the required 28-day compressive
 strength.
 The manufacturer is permitted to verify the shipping strength test, before 28 days, by
 testing compressive strength cylinders that are cured under conditions similar to the product or
 by testing temperature match cured cylinders. The manufacturer may use the maturity method,
 ASTM C1074, pulse velocity method in accordance with ASTM C597, or any other approved
 nondestructive test method to estimate the strength of concrete for determining form removal and
 handling strengths or before verification of shipping strength by test cylinders.
 Curing temperature and cycle must be monitored on a minimum of one precast culvert
 curing cell from each day of production when nondestructive test methods or temperature match
 cured cylinders are used to determine concrete strengths.
 The shipping strength test is the average compressive strength of two test cylinders. Do
 not ship any products until the QC Manager’s stamp is affixed to the product.
 407-10 Repairs and Rejection.
 Evaluate cracks, spalls and other deficiencies in accordance with 450-12, except that
 cracks will be classified in accordance with 400-21. Classify fractures and cracks passing
 through the wall or slab, except for a single end crack that does not exceed the depth of the joint,
 as structural cracks. Repair nonstructural cracks in accordance with 400-21 (substructure
 requirements), and all other deficiencies in accordance with 450-13 or the plant’s approved
 repair methods that are included as part of the Producer QC Plan. Ensure that the original
 performance and durability of the repaired precast culverts are maintained.
 Use materials for concrete repair that will meet or exceed the strength requirement of the
 class of concrete used. Materials meeting the requirements of Section 930 may be substituted for
 non-shrink grout when required by 450-13. Precast culvert elements are subject to rejection if
 they fail to conform to any of the specification requirements after repair or when damaged ends
 would prevent making a satisfactory joint.
 407-11 Marking.
 Clearly mark indelibly the following information on the interior of each precast unit by
 indention, water proof paint, or other approved method as described in the producer QC Plan:
 three sided structure span, rise, maximum and minimum design earth cover, skew angle, date of
 manufacture, serial number, project number, and name or trademark of manufacturer.
 407-12 Construction Requirements.
 Prior to constructing the footing, prepare the bearing soil in accordance with Section 455
 for spread footings. If a precast concrete footing is used, prepare a 4 inch thick layer of
 compacted granular bedding material to a minimum width of 12 inches outside the footing width
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 418
 
 and meet the density requirements of 125-9.2. Provide bedding material in accordance with
 Standard Plans, Index 120-001 select material, with not more than 15% fines passing the No. 200
 U.S. Standard sieve, or other granular material approved by the Engineer.
 Accomplish all footing construction in dry or dewatered excavations, as defined in
 455-29. When coarse aggregate is approved for use as an alternate bedding or foundation backfill
 material, fully wrap the coarse aggregate with a layer of Type D-4 geotextile filter fabric, as
 specified in Section 985. At each end of any concrete slab channel lining, substitute the coarse
 aggregate with select material within four feet of toe walls.
 Form a 3 inches deep key in the top surface of the footing 4 inches wider than the wall
 thickness. Ensure that footings reach a compressive strength of 3,000 psi before placing precast
 units.
 Place the units as shown in the shop drawings. Carefully set the structure to the true line
 and grade. Set the units in a bed of mortar placed in the keyway in the top of the footing. Fill the
 keyway with mortar, and float the mortar flush with the top of the footing or use shims between
 the footer and culvert during setting, then inject non-shrink grout under the culvert walls. Seal
 blockouts and holes provided for lifting or joint restraint by using an epoxy mortar or non-shrink
 grout in accordance with Sections 926 or 934.
 Carefully place backfill against the filter fabric and joint seal to avoid damage to the
 material. Use mechanical tampers or approved compacting equipment to compact all backfill and
 embankment immediately adjacent to each side of the structure. Place the backfill within 4 feet
 of each side of the structure in lifts of 8 inches or less (loose depth). Do not operate heavy
 compaction equipment within 4 feet of the structure. Ensure that the backfill elevation
 differential between both sides of the structure does not exceed 24 inches. Backfill behind
 wingwalls in accordance with Section 125. Carry backfill in front of wingwalls to ground lines
 shown in the Plans.
 407-13 Shop Drawings.
 Submit details of all precast culvert elements and modifications to cast-in-place elements
 for approval to the Engineer prior to manufacturing in accordance with 5-1.4. These shop
 drawings must include the proposed layout, full reinforcing details, lifting devices, a note
 describing the casting method for the precast culverts and full details of any modifications to
 cast-in-place elements and any connections. All details must be submitted as a complete package
 including modifications to cast-in-place elements.
 407-14 Method of Measurement.
 The quantity to be paid for will be the plan quantity at the price bid for the sum of the
 items shown in the Contract Documents. The length of precast culvert is measured along the
 centerline of the structure, from the outside face of the headwalls at each end. No increase in
 length will be permitted for multiple barrel precast culvert installations or extension of precast
 culverts ends to avoid skewed end conditions.
 407-15 Basis of Payment.

 410-3.2 Quality Assurance Inspection and Testing: The Engineer will perform periodic
 inspections, sampling, and testing to ensure of the quality and acceptability of the materials,
 methods, techniques, procedures and processes being utilized by the manufacturing facility in the
 fabrication of precast concrete box culverts.
 410-3.3 Special Requirements for Dry-Cast Concrete: Dry-cast concrete is defined as a
 very low slump concrete that requires continuous and intense vibration to compact the concrete,
 enabling immediate removal of the side forms without detrimental effects to the concrete when
 used in a dry-cast manufacturing process.
 The target slump and air content ranges of Section 346 – Table 2 and the plastic
 property tolerances of Section 346 – Table 6 are not applicable to dry-cast concrete.
 Perform absorption tests on specimens from each LOT of dry-cast production in
 accordance with the test methods in ASTM C497. The absorption of each specimen must not
 exceed 9.0 percent of the dry mass for Test Method A procedure or 8.5 percent for Test
 Method B procedure. All specimens must be free of visible cracks and must represent the full
 thickness of the product. Test specimens after 28 days of standard curing, or prior to the date of
 shipping if the precast box sections are to be shipped before the completion of the 28 day curing
 period.
 Core three specimens for Test Method B in accordance with ASTM C42 and meet
 the sampling location and size requirements of ASTM C497. Prepare or core a minimum of one
 specimen for Test Method A in accordance with the test cylinder requirements of ASTM C497.
 When the initial absorption specimen from a concrete box section fails to conform to this
 Specification, the absorption test may be made on another specimen from the same box section
 and the results of the retest may be substituted for the original test results for acceptance of the
 LOT. The manufacturer may test each box section within a LOT and cull the box sections not
 meeting absorption requirements marking them as deficient with waterproof paint or other
 approved means. Deficient box sections must not be shipped to the project site. Reduce the
 frequency of absorption tests to one test every five LOTs when the results of five consecutive
 LOTs meet the specified limit.

 3. Thoroughly clean and dry all joint surfaces which are to be in contact with the
 sealant material. When recommended by the sealant manufacturer, apply a primer of the type
 recommended to all joint surfaces which are to be in contact with the sealant material.
 4. Apply sealant to form a continuous seal around each joint. The sealant must be
 protected by a removable wrapper. Do not remove the paper wrapper on the exterior surface of
 the preformed flexible joint sealant until immediately prior to joining the precast sections. Apply
 the joint sealant only to dry surfaces. When the atmospheric temperature is below 60°F, either
 store the joint sealant in an area above 70°F, or artificially warm the joint sealant to 70°F in a
 manner satisfactory to the Engineer. After assembly, ensure that there is full contact and
 compression of the sealant for the entire perimeter of the joint, as evidenced by the presence of
 minor bulging along any visible edges of the sealant. Neatly trim any extruded sealant flush with
 the concrete surface.
 410-11.4 Water-tight Joint Treatment: Provide water-tight joints when shown in the
 Contract Documents. Utilize an external sealing band in accordance with ASTM C877 in

 concrete (new construction) or of existing concrete.
 413-2.2.2 Surface Preparation for New Construction: Remove substances such
 as dust, grime, dirt, curing compounds, form oil, debris, etc. by water blasting, light sandblasting,
 wire brushing, or other methods acceptable to the Engineer, all in accordance with the penetrant
 sealer manufacturer’s recommendations. When using cleaning methods other than water blasting,
 wash the cleaned surfaces with water meeting the requirements of Section 923, as a final
 cleaning operation.
 413-2.2.3 Surface Preparation for Existing Concrete: Remove substances such
 as dust, grime, dirt, stains, mineral deposits, oil, bituminous materials, debris, and all other
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 432
 
 deleterious material by using water blasting equipment of sufficient operating capacity and
 pressure, all in accordance with the penetrant sealer manufacturer’s recommendations.
 413-2.2.4 Cleaning Equipment: Use approved water blasting equipment to clean
 existing concrete surfaces. Use water blasting equipment which is specifically manufactured to
 clean concrete surfaces. Use equipment that has a minimum rated nozzle capacity of 6,000 psi
 using the spray head proposed for use in the work.
 413-2.2.5 Water for Blasting: Use water meeting the requirements of
 Section 923.
 413-2.2.6 Concrete Surface Cleaning Operation: Exercise sufficient care
 during the cleaning operation to minimize the removal of the concrete matrix. Furnish hand
 tools, power grinders, and other similar equipment to remove materials which cannot be removed
 by water blasting without abrading the concrete matrix beyond acceptable limits. Wash concrete
 surfaces cleaned by methods other than water blasting with water blasting equipment as the final
 cleaning operation.
 Limit the duration of water blasting to provide a light abraded surface. Do
 not allow surface abrasion to exceed 0.016 inch. The Engineer will not require further cleaning
 of stains still apparent after abrading to a depth of 0.016 inch. Avoid exposure of coarse
 aggregate by water blasting.
 Reclean concrete surfaces which become contaminated before applying
 the penetrant sealer at no expense to the Department prior to applying the penetrant sealer.
 413-2.3 Application of Penetrant Sealer Materials: Apply the penetrant sealer only to
 surfaces which have been prepared in accordance with these Specifications and approved by the
 Engineer. For application of the penetrant sealer, meet these Specifications and the penetrant
 sealer manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Prior to application of any penetrant sealer, cure concrete for a minimum of
 21 days.
 Apply penetrant sealer no later than ten days after completion of the surface
 preparation and prior to any contamination of the prepared surfaces as determined by the
 Engineer.
 413-2.3.1 Application Equipment: Apply the penetrant sealer using any suitable
 air or airless sprayer with an operating pressure of approximately 20 psi.
 413-2.3.2 Application Limitations: Apply the penetrant sealer material only
 when the ambient air temperature is between 50 and 90ºF. Apply the penetrant sealer only to
 concrete surfaces which have dried a minimum of 48 hours after water from any source last
 contacted the concrete surfaces. Do not apply the penetrant sealer when winds are blowing
 25 mph or more, during rainfall, or when water spray or mist is present.
 413-2.3.3 Application: Apply the penetrant sealer only to concrete surfaces that
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements and limitations set forth in these
 Specifications. Determine the actual coverage rate in square feet per gallon on the basis of field
 trials. Conduct a field trial to determine coverage rate at the beginning of any penetrant sealer
 application operation. Conduct additional confirmation field trials at a frequency of once for
 every 5,000 ft2 applied, each production day of application, or when the character of the work
 changes, whichever is sooner. For each field trial, determine the optimum coverage rate for
 500 ft2 of surface area. Maintain the penetrant sealer application rate between 155 and 225 ft2
 covered per gallon of penetrant sealer used. Apply the penetrant sealer in a uniform manner

 without puddling and skips. Redistribute any penetrant sealer which is applied and subsequently
 puddles in low areas over the concrete surfaces by use of a squeegee.
 Begin the application of the penetrant at the lowest elevation and proceed
 upward toward higher elevations unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 Maintain operating pressures in the sprayers used for application of the
 penetrant sealer material sufficiently low so that atomization or misting of the material does not
 occur. Saturate cracks to refusal when used as crack sealer per 400-21.
 413-2.4 Control of Materials:
 413-2.4.1 Packaging and Identification: Deliver the penetrant sealer to the
 project in unopened, sealed containers with the manufacturer’s label identifying the product and
 with numbered seals intact. Ensure that each container is clearly marked by the manufacturer
 with the following information:
 1. Manufacturer’s name and address.
 2. Product name.
 3. Date of manufacture.
 4. Expiration date.
 5. Lot identification number.
 6. Container serial number.
 413-2.4.2 Manufacturer’s Certification: Submit to the Engineer a certification
 conforming to the requirements of Section 6 from the manufacturer, confirming that the
 penetrant sealer meets the requirements of this Section. Do not incorporate these materials into
 the project until the Engineer has accepted and approved the certification for the material.
 Submit such certification for each Lot of material delivered to the project. In each certification,
 identify the serial or Lot numbers of the containers certified.
 413-2.4.3 Materials Sampling for Tests: The Engineer may require samples
 from each Lot or container of materials delivered to the project or from containers at the point of
 use. When samples are required, furnish samples in accordance with the Engineer’s instructions.
 413-2.4.4 Storage of Materials: Store materials delivered to the job site in
 original unopened containers within an appropriate storage facility. Use a storage facility that
 provides protection from the elements, and safe and secure storage of the materials.
 413-2.4.5 Unused Material in Opened Containers: Do not return unused
 material in opened containers to storage for later use. Either apply such material to appropriate
 areas on concrete surfaces or remove and dispose of it at offsite locations provided by the
 Contractor.
 413-2.5 Acceptance: The Engineer will accept penetrant sealer application when it is
 determined that the Contractor has properly cleaned all surface areas to be sealed and has applied
 the penetrant sealer within the required rates of application.
 413-3 High Molecular Weight Methacrylate (HMWM).
 413-3.1 General: Perform the surface preparation and application of a high molecular
 weight methacrylate to seal cracks on horizontal and slightly sloped concrete surfaces as
 approved by the Engineer. Applications on bridge decks and other riding surfaces will require
 the addition of sand over the treated areas to increase the surface friction number (FN) measured
 as described by AASHTO T242.
 The rate of application (ft2 of concrete per gallon) and the application method and
 equipment to achieve a minimum average penetration of 1 inch must be approved by the SMO
 prior to commencement of work based on the size, depth and the internal condition of cracks.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 434
 
 Submit a written sealer application plan based on the above described crack characteristics for
 approval by the SMO. In addition, provide a minimum of 14 days advanced notice so that
 personnel from the SMO may be present at the beginning of work to evaluate the cracks and
 submit final approval of the application rate if such is requested by the Engineer. Make
 arrangements with the material manufacturer to provide an on-site technical representative with a
 minimum of ten previous projects with experience in the application and formulation of the
 methacrylates for the initial application and certify that the mixing ratio, application methods,
 and sand broadcasting are correct and in accordance with their recommendations. The
 representative shall then visit the site to provide quality assurance observations every two weeks
 for applications lasting longer than two weeks.
 Maintain a daily log of used resin material to be verified by the Engineer. Include
 the drum or container identification number in the log as well as the date and location of use.
 Retain the containers at the jobsite until the Engineer verifies its use and authorizes removal
 from the site.
 413-3.2 Materials: Use a methacrylate system that has a three component formulation
 consisting of methacrylate monomer, cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) initiator, and cobalt
 promoter. Use a HMWM monomer that is approved by the Department and included on the
 Department’s Approved Product List (APL). Use initiator and promoter approved by the
 monomer manufacturer. Manufacturers seeking evaluation of their products must submit an
 application conforming to the requirements of Section 6 along with the following documentation:
 1. Manufacturer’s material installation instructions showing the product can be
 installed in accordance with this Section.
 2. Independent laboratory test data and results showing the product has been

 The monomer shall have a shelf life of no less than 12 months and shall be
 no more than 8 months old at the time of application. Provide each container shipped to the job
 site with the following information on a manufacturer’s label: manufacturer’s name, product
 name, lot or batch number, date of production, and drum serial number. Identify the catalysts by
 their generic classification and provide the date of manufacture.
 413-3.2.2 Sand: Use uniformly graded 6-20 (or similar), clean, bagged, blast sand
 for spreading over the applied polymer on bridge decks and other riding surfaces. Certify that the
 sand has a maximum moisture content that does not exceed 0.25% and that the maximum
 amount of dust or other material that may pass through a No. 200 sieve -200 content) is not
 greater than 0.75%.
 Store the sand at a location that will preserve the above described
 conditions and characteristics of the sand until applied.
 413-3.2.3 Identifier: Use methacrylates with a fluorescent dye when applying
 methacrylate over previously sealed cracks. The fluorescent dye shall be part of the manufacturer
 formulation and be clearly fluorescent under a UV light source provided by the Contractor.
 413-3.3 Surface Preparation:
 413-3.3.1 Cleaning: On the day of application, thoroughly power sweep the area
 to be treated to remove all dust, dirt or debris present. On bridge decks and other riding surfaces,
 use a tractor mounted (or similar) power broom with non-metallic bristles suitable for the
 intended purpose.
 Use a power vacuum after sweeping when sealing cracks on grooved
 bridge decks. Re-clean the deck as necessary immediately prior to the application as debris may
 be blown back onto the work area by adjacent traffic or other means.
 If present, remove oils and oil based substances from the concrete surface
 using an approved solvent.
 413-3.3.2 Containment: Provide adequate containment to prevent the sealer
 material from flowing beyond the designated area of application. Plug any drain holes or
 openings within the work area. Prevent airborne material from dispersing onto open traffic lanes
 or outside the work area.
 413-3.3.3 Raised Pavement Markers (RPMs): Protect by masking or clean after
 application, all existing RPMs affected by the application of the methacrylate. Alternatively,
 remove and replace such RPMs as indicated in the Contract Documents.
 413-3.4 Application:
 413-3-4.1 Equipment: Apply the methacrylate material according to the
 manufacturer’s specifications using mobile equipment capable of distributing material on large
 areas of decks and riding surfaces. Apply the material by hand using adequate containers for
 isolated or localized applications.
 413-3.4.2 Mixing: Mix the methylmethacrylate material following the
 manufacturer’s specified mixing proportions for the catalysts. Perform the initial mixing by
 equally dividing the resin to be used into two separate containers. In all instances, mix the
 initiator (CHP) at the HMWM manufacturer’s specified volume with 50% of the monomer resin
 in one container and the cobalt promoter at the HMWM manufacturer’s specified volume with
 the other 50% in the second container. After properly blending, combine the two resins and mix
 as per manufacturer’s instructions. For spray bar application, mix the activator/resin blend and
 the promoter/resin blend through a static mixer in the feed line located ahead of the material
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 436
 
 distribution bars where polymerization would start. Calibrate the valves to the static mixer to
 ensure a one to one mixing ratio of the two blends.
 413-3.4.3 Polymer Application (Mobile Distribution): Distribute the monomer
 uniformly over the work area using a pressure nozzle or spray head distribution bar system.
 Provide feed to the distribution bar(s) using positive displacement pumps moving equal amounts
 of the two monomer blends from two calibrated drums.
 Calibrate the equipment to mix the two monomer blends to the
 recommended ratio (by volume) within plus or minus 5%. The discharge volume shall be
 calibrated to the moving speed to provide a discharge rate capability ranging from 50 to
 200 square feet per gallon at a pressure ranging from 15 to 60 psi.
 The typical application rate of the material is approximately 100 square
 feet per gallon. Prior to application of the monomer, the SMO will approve the final production
 application rate based on the internal characteristics of the cracks as determined from Contractor
 supplied cores that the Engineer approves as being representative of the overall cracking
 conditions.
 413-3.4.4 Polymer Application (Localized Distribution): Distribute the
 material by hand over the work area using pails or other suitable containers adequate for the size
 of the area. This only applies to localized small areas or areas where the use of mobile
 distribution equipment would be considered impractical as approved by the Engineer.
 Do not re-use containers or mixing paddles fully or partially contaminated
 with polymerized methacrylate.
 413-3.4.5 Sealing of Cracks: Regardless of the method used to apply the material
 over the concrete surface, work the material back and forth over the cracks to maximize the
 amount of material to be absorbed by the cracks. Move the material over the cracks using
 brooms, squeegees or paint brushes as appropriate, based on the size of the area. Commence this
 operation immediately after distributing the material on the concrete surface. Continue this
 operation until no additional material is flowing inside the cracks or the material begins to
 exhibit signs of polymerization.
 Do not distribute material over areas larger than what the available
 personnel can effectively work over the cracks within the limits of the pot life.
 413-3.4.6 Sand Distribution: Apply sand over the monomer treated area within a
 timely period following the application of the polymer based on the manufacturer’s
 recommendations for the existing conditions. Use equipment that will produce a uniform
 distribution of the sand over the treated area. If wheel mounted, use a sand spreader that has
 pneumatic tires compatible with the treatment material such that no tire footprints are left on the
 deck surface.
 Use an initial application rate of 0.6 (plus or minus 0.05) pounds of sand
 per square yard of treated area, and adjust the rate as necessary to produce a friction number
 (FN) of no less than FN40R greater than or equal to 35 at 7 days. Coordinate with the Engineer
 to conduct a preliminary on-site friction test to determine the actual sand application rate prior to
 the beginning of production application. If friction numbers below those specified are obtained,
 completely remove all loose sand from the surface and re-apply the polymer at a rate of
 150 square feet per gallon and spread additional sand as necessary to achieve the specified
 friction numbers. Remove the surface material by grinding, shot blasting, or other approved
 method if satisfactory friction values are not achieved. Friction tests will be conducted by the
 State Materials Office.

 437
 
 413-3.5 Opening Riding Surfaces to Traffic: Protect the sand covered area from
 vehicular traffic until the polymer has fully cured. After curing, power vacuum to remove excess
 sand from the riding surface, before opening to traffic.
 413-3.6 Acceptance Tests: Verify penetration of the methacrylate into the cracks by
 extracting a 2 inch diameter core (1-1/2 inch deep) for every 1000 square feet or less (if
 application is less than 1000 square feet) of sealed concrete. Use caution to prevent cutting the
 reinforcing steel. Frequency of verification may be reduced by the SMO with the concurrence of
 the Engineer.
 Test curing on the treated area using a cotton strand or cotton ball. Consider the
 material fully cured and ready for traffic when polymer does not adhere to the cotton ball when
 pressed against the treated surface and then pulled away. Obtain approval from the Engineer
 prior to reopening area to traffic.
 413-3.7 Limitations: Apply the material only under weather conditions
 recommended by the manufacturer and when no rainfall has occurred during the previous
 48 hours and no rain is expected for the next 6 hours following completion of the application.
 413-4 Method of Measurement.
 Prestressed, precast items designated in the Plans to be sealed with penetrant sealer, will
 not be measured for separate payment. The Contractor shall include the cost of cleaning, sealing,
 and applying penetrant sealer with the cost of the prestressed, precast items. For cast-in-place
 surfaces to be sealed with penetrant sealer, the quantities to be paid for will be the volume, in
 gallons, of penetrant sealer as determined by use of the field measured area satisfactorily sealed
 divided by the approved application rate based on field trials, and the area, in square feet, of
 cleaning and sealing concrete surfaces as determined by field measurement, completed and
 accepted.
 Quantities of high molecular weight methacrylate to be paid will be based on the volume
 in gallons of monomer resin material (not including the promoter, initiator, and fluorescent dye)
 actually used to seal the cracked surfaces at the approved application rate, and the dimensions of
 the treated areas in square feet.
 The area of application will be computed based on the plan dimensions of concrete
 surface sealed with methacrylate. For localized application, the Engineer will determine the
 method of measurement that most accurately reflects the area of application in square feet.
 413-5 Basis of Payment.
 Prices and payments will be full compensation for all work specified in this Section,
 including cleaning, furnishing and applying the material required to satisfactorily clean and seal
 cracks and designated surface areas, testing, and miscellaneous related costs including storage,
 handling, etc.
 No additional compensation will be made for material, reapplication or removal due to
 Contractor error, or to correct deficient friction values.
 Payment will be made under:

 442
 
 reduce the average spacing between bar supports by 15%, or remove that product from use on
 the job.
 Ensure that bar supports do not move during concrete placing operations.
 To prevent movement, tie supports to the reinforcing bars.
 When using bar supports on corrugated metal stay-in-place forms, use
 supports specifically designed for the form being used.
 For structural elements located in extremely aggressive environments, do
 not use metal bar supports in contact with removable forms or floor surfaces to support
 reinforcing bars.
 415-5.13.2 Metal Bar Supports: For metal bar supports in contact with
 removable forms, provide supports constructed with molded plastic legs or plastic protected
 metal legs or bolster rails. Do not allow any portion of the bar support other than the molded
 plastic leg or plastic protected portion of the metal leg or bolster rail to be closer than 1/2 inch
 from the removable form surface for concrete to be cast.
 Submit certification verifying that all metal bar supports meet the
 following requirements:
 1. That they are manufactured from cold drawn steel wire in
 accordance with the wire sizes and geometrical dimensions shown in the CRSI Manual of
 Standard Practice, Chapter 3.
 2. That the plastic used for protection of the steel legs or bolster
 rails has a thickness of 3/32 inch or greater at points of contact with the form work.
 Provide plastic protection by a dipping operation, by adding premolded
 plastic tips to the legs of the support or by molding plastic to the top wire of the support. Ensure
 that the plastic material used for protection of steel legs does not chip, crack, deform, or peel
 during use.
 Do not use metal bar supports to support FRP reinforcing bars.
 415-5.13.3 Plastic Bar Supports and Spacers: Use non-stackable plastic bar
 supports and spacers. Bar supports shall be able to meet the concentrated load requirements of
 415-5.13 within a working temperature range of 20 to 150°F. Spacers shall be able to provide
 sufficient strength to support reinforcing steel in the required position without deformation and
 relaxation under job conditions. For drilled shafts, use wheel spacers with a smooth perimeter
 surface.
 Submit protection from sunlight until placed in the form and mold in a
 configuration which does not restrict concrete flow and consolidation.
 All plastic bar supports and spacers shall have a maximum water
 absorption of 0.5% at 7 days as per ASTM D570. Plastic bar supports and spacers made of
 recycled plastic products must meet the additional requirements of Section 972.
 Submit to the Engineer independent lab test data and certification
 verifying that the plastic spacers meet the requirements specified herein.
 Use plastic bar supports listed on the Department’s APL. Provide each
 individual bar support with an identification number unique to the particular model permanently
 marked on the surface as included in the APL. Manufacturers seeking evaluation of products for
 inclusion on the APL must submit an application in accordance with Section 6 and include
 certified test reports from an independent laboratory showing that the plastic bar supports meet
 all the requirements specified herein.

 INSTALLATION OF POST-INSTALLED ANCHOR SYSTEMS AND DOWELS
 FOR STRUCTURAL APPLICATIONS IN CONCRETE ELEMENTS
 416-1 Description.
 Prepare and install post-installed anchor systems and dowels in hardened concrete as
 indicated in the Plans, as directed by the Engineer, and in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 instructions and this Section.
 Post-installed anchors and dowels in this Section are intended for use in structural
 applications where designated in the Plans.
 416-2 Materials.
 416-2.1 Adhesive Bonded Anchors and Dowels: Use adhesive bonding material
 systems which meet the requirements of Section 937 and are included on the Approved Product
 List (APL). Use anchors and dowels installed in positions ranging from vertically downward to
 horizontal.
 416-2.1.1 Type HV Adhesives: Use Type HV adhesive bonding materials for all
 installations other than constructing doweled pile splices. Do not use Type HV adhesives as a
 substitute for Type HSHV adhesives.
 416-2.1.2 Type HSHV Adhesives: Use higher strength Type HSHV adhesive
 bonding materials for installation of traffic railing reinforcement and anchor bolts into existing
 concrete bridge decks and approach slabs. Type HSHV adhesives may be used as a substitute for
 Type HV adhesives provided the length and diameter of the anchor bolt and drilled hole remain
 as designed for the Type HV adhesive.
 416-2.1.3 Storage of Materials: Store materials delivered to the job site in the
 original unopened containers within an appropriate facility capable of maintaining storage
 conditions consistent with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 416-3 Equipment.
 Install adhesive-bonded anchor systems with equipment conforming to the
 manufacturer’s recommendation for the type of system installed.
 416-4 Preparing of Concrete Members.
 416-4.1 Adhesive-Bonded Anchors and Dowels: Ensure that concrete members
 receiving adhesive-bonded anchors or dowels are structurally sound and free of cracks in the
 vicinity of the anchor or dowel to be installed. Unless other equipment is recommended by the
 adhesive manufacturer, drill holes to the diameter required by the manufacturer, but as a
 minimum, not less than 105% of the diameter including deformations, nor more than 150% of
 the nominal diameter of the steel bar anchor or dowel, using a rotary hammer drill and bit.
 Use a metal detector specifically designed for locating steel in concrete to avoid
 conflicts with existing steel reinforcement whenever placement tolerances and edge clearances
 permit. Perform core drilling through existing steel reinforcement only when approved by the
 Engineer. Dry the drilled holes completely prior to cleaning and installing the anchors or dowels.
 Clean and prepare drilled holes in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 recommendations, but as a minimum, use oil free compressed air to remove loose particles from
 drilling, brush inside surface to free loose particles trapped in pores, then use compressed air
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 446
 
 again to remove the remaining loose particles. Use a non-metallic bristle brush and avoid overbrushing to prevent polishing the inside surface of the drilled hole.
 416-5 Installation Methods.
 416-5.1 Adhesive-Bonded Anchors and Dowels: Remove all debris, oils, and any other
 deleterious material from the anchors and dowels to avoid contamination of the adhesive
 bonding material. Install anchors or dowels in accordance with the details shown in the Plans and
 the manufacturer’s instructions, with particular attention to requirements and limitations due to
 anchor position, dampness, ambient temperature, and curing.
 Use adequate quantities of the adhesive bonding material to fill the drilled hole to
 within 1/4 inch of the concrete surface measured after placement of the steel bar or anchor. For
 horizontal and downwardly inclined installations, provide temporary supports to maintain the
 anchors or dowels in the center of the drilled holes until the adhesive bonding material has cured.
 416-6 Field Testing of Post-Installed Anchor Systems and Dowels.
 416-6.1 General: Provide an independent testing agency to perform field testing of postinstalled anchors or dowels under the direction of a Professional Engineer registered in the State
 of Florida. Submit test reports for each LOT signed and sealed by the Professional Engineer.
 Perform restrained static tension tests to prevent damage to the surrounding concrete. A
 restrained test is defined as a test conducted in accordance with ASTM E-488 except that the test
 equipment support clearance requirements of ASTM E-488 do not apply. The opening in the
 reaction base shall be approximately equal to the drilled hole diameter for the anchor to preclude
 concrete or masonry failure, but allow bond failure for the adhesive-bonded anchors and dowels.
 Displacement measurement for field testing is not required.
 Divide the post-installed anchors or dowels into LOTs for testing and acceptance.
 Each LOT must contain a maximum of 100 anchors or dowels, of the same type, manufacturer,
 diameter, embedment length and adhesive bonding material system (if applicable) installed on
 the same day. Randomly select four of the anchors or dowels in each LOT for testing, except if
 there are three or less in the LOT, in which case, test all anchors or dowels, unless otherwise
 directed by the Engineer. If three consecutive LOTs have no failing tests, sample the next three
 LOTs at a 2% rate, rounded up to the nearest whole number, and if these LOTs have no failing
 tests, sample at a rate of 1%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, for the remaining LOTs
 unless there is a failure; however, regardless of LOT size, sample at least one anchor or dowel
 per LOT. For every failed field test, perform two additional field tests on adjacent untested
 anchors or dowels within the LOT. Continue additional field tests until no more test failures
 occur, or all anchors or dowels within the LOT are tested. For the next LOT after a failed LOT,
 randomly select four of the anchors or dowels in each LOT for testing, except if there are three
 or less in the LOT, test all anchors or dowels unless otherwise directed by the Engineer then
 conform to the sampling rate procedure above including rate reductions as appropriate for
 subsequent LOTs.
 416-6.1.1 Adhesive-Bonded Anchors: Field test installed anchors and dowels for
 applications connecting traffic railings to bridge decks, approach slabs and concrete pavement
 using Type HSHV adhesives. The Engineer may also require field testing of installed anchors
 and dowels for other applications. Any field testing of installed anchors which is required by the
 Engineer and not quantified in the Contract Documents shall be paid for by the Department
 unless a failure occurs during the field testing.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 447
 
 Test individual anchors and dowels by proof loading in tension to 85% of
 the specified bond strength in accordance with Section 937 based on the nominal anchor or
 dowel diameter and embedment depth, but not more than 90% of the yield strength of the anchor
 or dowel, unless otherwise shown in the Contract Documents.
 416-6.2 Removal & Replacement of Failed Test Specimens: Remove all anchors and
 dowels that fail the field test, in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation and
 without damage to the surrounding concrete. For adhesive-bonded anchors, redrill holes to
 remove adhesive bonding material residue and clean in accordance with 416-4. Reinstall new
 anchors and dowels in accordance with 416-5. Do not reuse the failed anchors and dowels unless
 approved by the Engineer. Assign reinstalled anchors into new LOTs only containing reinstalled
 anchors or dowels of the same diameter, embedment length and adhesive bonding material
 system, and field test in accordance with 416-6.
 416-7 Acceptance.
 The Engineer will base acceptance of post-installed anchor systems on determining that
 the material requirements of Section 937, the installation and testing requirements of this Section
 and the placement requirements of the Plans have been met.
 416-8 Basis of Payment.
 The work specified in this Section will not be paid for directly, but will be considered as
 incidental work.

 to type of pipe and conditions of usage.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 452
 
 430-2.3 Mortar: Use mortar composed of one part Portland cement and two parts of
 clean, sharp sand, to which mixture the Contractor may add hydrated lime in an amount not to
 exceed 15% of the cement content. Use mortar within 30 minutes after its preparation.
 430-3 Type of Pipe to Be Used.
 430-3.1 General: Prior to the preconstruction conference, submit to the Engineer which
 optional pipe material from the optional materials tabulation sheet will be used. Once a pipe
 material is selected, do not change pipe materials without approval of the Engineer.
 When the Plans designate a type (or types) of pipe, use only the type (or choose
 from the types) designated. As an exception, when the Plans designate reinforced concrete pipe
 as Class S, Class I, Class II, Class III and Class IV, the Contractor may use non-reinforced
 concrete pipe up to and including 36 inch in diameter.
 430-3.2 Side Drain: If the Plans do not designate a type (or types) of pipe, the Contractor
 may use either a minimum Class I concrete pipe, corrugated steel pipe, corrugated aluminum
 pipe, corrugated high-density polyethylene pipe, steel reinforced polyethylene ribbed pipe,
 polypropylene pipe, or PVC pipe. If one of the metal types is chosen, use the minimum gage
 specified in Section 943 for steel pipe or Section 945 for aluminum pipe. Alternatively, when
 metal pipe is allowed and no future maintenance concerns exist, the Contractor may propose the
 pipe gage based on the Department’s Drainage Manual and Culvert Service Life Estimator for
 approval by the Engineer. When extending existing pipes, construct the pipe extensions of the
 same size and kind as the existing pipe. Extensions of existing pipes, whose materials are no
 longer produced, shall be extended with the most similar pipe material available.
 Non-reinforced concrete pipe may also be substituted for concrete pipe in side
 drains, subject to the provisions of 430-3.1.
 430-4 Laying Pipe.
 430-4.1 General: Lay all pipe, true to the lines and grades given, with hubs upgrade and
 tongue end fully entered into the hub. When pipe with quadrant reinforcement or circular pipe
 with elliptical reinforcement is used, install the pipe in a position such that the manufacturer’s
 marks designating “top” and “bottom” of the pipe are not more than five degrees from the
 vertical plane through the longitudinal axis of the pipe. Do not allow departure from and return to
 plan alignment and grade to exceed 1/16 inch per foot of nominal pipe length, with a total of not
 more than 1 inch departure from theoretical line and grade. Take up and relay any pipe that is not
 in true alignment or which shows any settlement after laying at no additional expense to the
 Department.
 Do not use concrete pipe with lift holes except round pipe which has an inside
 diameter in excess of 54 inches or any elliptical pipe.
 Repair lift holes, if present, with hand-placed, stiff, non-shrink, 1-to-1 mortar of
 cement and fine sand, after first washing out the hole with water. Completely fill the void created
 by the lift hole with mortar. Cover the repaired area with a 24 by 24 inch piece of filter fabric
 secured to the pipe. Use a Type D-3 filter fabric meeting the requirements specified in
 Section 985.
 Secure the filter fabric to the pipe using a method that holds the fabric in place
 until the backfill is placed and compacted. Use grout mixtures, mastics, or strapping devices to
 secure the fabric to the pipe.
 When installing pipes in structures, construct inlet and outlet pipes of the same
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 453
 
 size and kind as the connecting pipe shown in the Plans. Use the same pipe material within each
 continuous run of pipe. Extend the pipes through the walls for a distance beyond the outside
 surface sufficient for the intended connections, and construct the concrete around them neatly to
 prevent leakage along their outer surface as shown on Standard Plans, Index 425-001. Keep the
 inlet and outlet pipes flush with the inside of the wall. Resilient connectors as specified in 942-3
 may be used in lieu of a masonry seal.
 Furnish and install a filter fabric jacket around all pipe joints and the joint
 between the pipe and the structure in accordance with Standard Plans, Indexes 425-001 and 430001. Use fabric meeting the physical requirements of Type D-3 specified in Section 985. Extend
 the fabric a minimum of 12 inches beyond each side of the joint or both edges of the coupling
 band, if a coupling band is used. The fabric must have a minimum width of 24 inches, and a
 length sufficient to provide a minimum overlap of 24 inches. Secure the filter fabric jacket
 against the outside of the pipe by metal or plastic strapping or by other methods approved by the
 Engineer.
 Meet the following minimum joint standards:
 Pipe Application
 Storm and Cross Drains
 Gutter Drain
 Side Drains
 
 Minimum Standard
 Water-tight
 Water-tight
 Soil-tight
 
 When rubber gaskets are to be installed in the pipe joint, the gasket must be the
 sole element relied on to maintain a tight joint. Soil tight joints must be watertight to 2 psi.
 Water-tight joints must be water-tight to 5 psi unless a higher pressure rating is required in the
 Plans.
 When laying pipes that pass through mechanically stabilized earth (MSE)
 reinforced fill, connect the portion of the pipe within the wall to the external portion of the pipe
 run only after the full height of the wall supported embankment is in place.
 When Wall Zone Pipes are shown in the Plans, meet the following requirements:
 1. Use resilient connectors on pipes entering and leaving drainage
 structures.
 2. Provide a 2 to 4 inch pipe overhang beyond the drainage structure
 internal walls.
 3. For pipes without welded joints, meet the following additional
 requirements:
 a. Pipe joints must be watertight to 10.8 psi when pulled out
 2 inches from the fully home joint alignment.
 b. Do not allow the gap between sections of pipe to exceed
 5/8 inch for all pipe diameters.
 430-4.2 Trench Excavation: Excavate the trench for storm and cross drains, and side
 drains as specified in Section 125.
 430-4.3 Foundation: Provide a suitable foundation, where the foundation material is of
 inadequate supporting value, as determined by the Engineer. Remove the unsuitable material and
 replace it with suitable material, as specified in 125-8. Where in the Engineer’s opinion, the
 removal and replacement of unsuitable material is not practicable, he may direct alternates in the

 454
 
 design of the pipe line, as required to provide adequate support. Minor changes in the grade or
 alignment will not be considered as an adequate basis for extra compensation.
 Do not lay pipe on blocks or timbers, or on other unyielding material, except
 where the use of such devices is called for in the Plans.
 430-4.4 Backfilling: Backfill around the pipe as specified in 125-8 unless specific
 backfilling procedures are described in the Contract Documents.
 430-4.5 Plugging Pipe: When existing pipe culverts are to be permanently placed out of
 service, fill them with flowable fill that is non-excavatable, contains a minimum 350 pounds per
 cubic yard of cementitious material and meets the requirements of Section 121 and/or plug them
 with masonry plugs as shown in the Plans. Install masonry plugs that are a minimum of 8 inches
 in thickness, in accordance with Standard Plans, Index 430-001.
 When proposed or existing pipe culverts are to be temporarily placed out of
 service, plug them with prefabricated plugs as shown in the Plans. Install prefabricated plugs in
 accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. Do not fill or construct masonry plugs in
 any pipe culvert intended for current or future service.
 430-4.6 End Treatment: Place an end treatment at each storm and cross drain, and side
 drain as shown in the Plans. Refer to the Standard Plans for types of end treatment details. As an
 exception to the above, when concrete mitered end sections are permitted, the Contractor may
 use reinforced concrete U-endwalls, if shop drawings are submitted to the Engineer for approval
 prior to use.
 Provide end treatments for corrugated polyethylene pipe, polypropylene pipe, and
 PVC pipe as specified in Section 948, or as detailed in the Plans.
 430-4.7 Metal Pipe Protection: Apply a bituminous coating to the surface area of the
 pipe within and 12 inches beyond the concrete or mortar seal prior to sealing, to protect
 corrugated steel or aluminum pipe embedded in a concrete structure, such as an inlet, manhole,
 junction box, endwall, or concrete jacket.
 Ensure that the surface preparation, application methods (dry film thickness and
 conditions during application), and equipment used are in accordance with the coating
 manufacturers’ published specifications.
 Obtain the Engineer’s approval of the coating products used.
 430-4.8 Pipe Inspection: For pipes installed under the roadway, inspection is to be
 conducted when backfill reaches 3 feet above the pipe crown or upon completion of placement of
 the stabilized subgrade. For pipe installed within fills, including embankments confined by walls,
 inspection is to be conducted when compacted embankment reaches 3 feet above the pipe crown
 or the finished earthwork grade as specified in the Plans. Prior to conducting the inspection,
 submit to the Engineer a video recording schedule for videoing, dewater installed pipe, and
 remove all silt, debris and obstructions. Submit pipe videoing and reports to the Department for
 review prior to the continuation of paving.
 For pipe 48 inches or less in diameter, submit to the Engineer a video DVD and
 report using low barrel distortion video equipment with laser profile technology, non-contact

 performing the work to be in compliance with the calibration criteria posted at:
 http://www.fdot.gov/construction/contractorissues/laser.shtm. Reports submitted in electronic
 media are preferred.
 The Engineer may waive this requirement for side drains and cross drains which
 are short enough to inspect from each end of the pipe.
 430-4.8.1 Video Report: Provide a high quality DVD in a MPEG2 format video
 with a standard resolution of 720 x 480. Use a camera with lighting suitable to allow a clear
 picture of the entire periphery of the pipe. Center the camera in the pipe both vertically and
 horizontally and be able to pan and tilt to a 90 degree angle with the axis of the pipe and rotating
 360 degrees. Use equipment to move the camera through the pipe that will not obstruct the
 camera’s view or interfere with proper documentation of the pipe’s condition.
 The video image shall be clear, focused, and relatively free from roll,
 static, or other image distortion qualities that would prevent the reviewer from evaluating the
 condition of the pipe. The video will include identification before each section of pipe filmed.
 The identification will include the project number, the structure number corresponding to the
 structure number in the Plans for the project, size of pipe, the date and time, and indicate which
 pipe is being filmed if multiple pipes are connected to the structure. Notes should be taken during
 the video recording process. Submit these notes along with the video.
 Move the camera through the pipe at a speed not greater than 30 feet per
 minute. Mark the video with the distance down the pipe. The distance shall have an accuracy of
 one foot per 100 feet. Film the entire circumference at each joint. Stop the camera and pan when
 necessary to document and measure defects. Position the camera head perpendicular to all defects
 requiring measurement by the video micrometer.
 430-4.8.2 Reinspection: At any time after reviewing the submitted pipe
 inspection reports, the Engineer may direct additional inspections. If no defects are observed
 during the reinspection, the Department will pay for the cost of the reinspections in accordance
 with 4-3. If defects are observed, the reinspection and all work performed to correct the defects
 will be done at no cost to the Department. Acceptance of all replacements or repairs will be
 based on video documentation of the completed work prior to Final Acceptance.
 430-5 Removing Existing Pipe.
 If the Plans indicate that existing pipe is to remain the property of the Department, collect
 and stack along the right-of-way all existing pipe or pipe arch so indicated in the Plans to be
 removed, or that does not conform to the lines and grades of the proposed work and that is not to
 be re-laid, as directed by the Engineer. Take care to prevent damage to salvageable pipe during
 removal and stacking operations.

 430-6 Placing Pipe Under Railroad.
 430-6.1 General: Construct pipe culverts under railroad tracks in accordance with the
 requirements of the railroad company.
 Perform all the shoring under the tracks, and sheeting and bracing of the trench,
 required by the railroad company or deemed necessary by the Engineer in order to ensure safe
 and uninterrupted movement of the railroad equipment, at no expense to the Department.
 430-6.2 Requirements of the Railroad Company: Install pipe using methods required
 by the railroad company and shown in the Contract Documents.
 When the general method of installation required by the railroad company is
 indicated in the Plans, do not alter such method, or any other specific details of the installation
 which might be indicated in the Plans, without receiving approval or direction from the railroad,
 followed by written approval from the Engineer.
 430-6.3 Notification to Railroad Company: Notify the railroad company and the
 Engineer at least ten days prior to the date on which pipe is to be placed under the railroad tracks.
 430-6.4 Placing Pipe by Jacking: Obtain the Engineer’s and the railroad company’s
 approval of the details of the jacking method to be used, when placing pipe through the railroad
 embankment, before the work is started.
 430-6.5 Use of Tunnel Liner: When the railroad company requires that a tunnel liner be
 used for placing the pipe in lieu of the jacking method, the Department will pay for the tunnel
 liner material separately in cases where the Contract Documents do not require the use of a
 tunnel liner. For these cases the Department will reimburse the Contractor for the actual cost of
 the liner, delivered at the site. The Department will base such cost on a liner having the minimum
 gage acceptable to the railroad.
 430-7 Specific Requirements for Concrete Pipe.
 430-7.1 Sealing Joints: Seal the pipe joints with round rubber or profile gaskets meeting
 the requirements of Section 449. Ensure that the gasket and the surface of the pipe joint,
 including the gasket recess, are clean and free from grit, dirt and other foreign matter, at the time
 the joints are made. In order to facilitate closure of the joint, application of a vegetable soap
 lubricant immediately before closing of the joint will be permitted. Prelubricated gaskets may be
 used in lieu of a vegetable soap lubricant when the lubricating material is certified to be inert
 with respect to the rubber material.
 430-7.2 Laying Requirements for Concrete Pipe with Rubber Gasket Joints: Do not
 allow the gap between sections of pipe to exceed 5/8 inch for pipe diameters of 12 inches through
 18 inches, 7/8 inch for pipe diameters of 24 through 66 inches, and 1 inch for pipe diameters
 72 inches and larger. Where minor imperfections in the manufacture of the pipe create an
 apparent gap in excess of the tabulated gap, the Engineer will accept the joint provided that the
 imperfection does not exceed 1/3 the circumference of the pipe, and the rubber gasket is 1/4 inch
 or more past the pipe joint entrance taper. Where concrete pipes are outside of these tolerances,
 replace them at no expense to the Department. Do not apply mortar, joint compound, or other
 filler to the gap which would restrict the flexibility of the joint.
 430-7.3 Field Joints for Elliptical Concrete Pipe: Use either a preformed plastic gasket
 material or an approved rubber gasket to make a field joint.
 430-7.3.1 Plastic Gasket: Meet the following requirements when field joints are
 made from preformed plastic gasket material:
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 457
 
 430-7.3.1.1 General: Install field joints in accordance with the
 manufacturer’s instructions and the following:
 430-7.3.1.2 Material: Meet the requirements of 942-2.
 430-7.3.1.3 Joint Design: Ensure that the pipe manufacturer submits
 details to the Engineer regarding configuration of the joint and the amount of gasket material
 required to affect a satisfactory seal. Do not brush or wipe joint surfaces which are to be in
 contact with the gasket material with a cement slurry. Fill minor voids with cement slurry.
 430-7.3.1.4 Primer: Apply a primer of the type recommended by the
 manufacturer of the gasket material to all joint surfaces which are to be in contact with the gasket
 material, prior to application of the gasket material. Thoroughly clean and dry the surface to be
 primed.
 430-7.3.1.5 Application of Gasket: Apply gasket material to form a
 continuous gasket around the entire circumference of the leading edge of the tongue and the
 groove joint, in accordance with the detail shown on Standard Plans, Index 430-001. Do not
 remove the paper wrapper on the exterior surface of the gasket material until immediately prior
 to joining of sections. Apply plastic gasket material only to surfaces which are dry. When the
 atmospheric temperature is below 60ºF, either store plastic joint seal gaskets in an area above
 70ºF, or artificially warm the gaskets to 70ºF in a manner satisfactory to the Engineer.
 430-7.3.1.6 Installation of Pipe: Remove and reposition or replace any
 displaced or contaminated gasket as directed by the Engineer. Install the pipe in a dry trench.
 Carefully shape the bottom of the trench to minimize the need for realignment of sections of pipe
 after they are placed in the trench. Hold to a minimum any realignment of a joint after the gaskets
 come into contact. Prior to joining the pipes, fill the entire joint with gasket material and ensure
 that when the pipes are joined there is evidence of squeeze-out of gasket material for the entire
 internal and external circumference of the joint. Trim excess material on the interior of the pipe
 to provide a smooth interior surface. If a joint is defective, remove the leading section of pipe and
 reseal the joint.
 430-7.3.2 Rubber Gasket: Meet the following requirements when field joints are
 made with profile rubber gaskets:
 430-7.3.2.1 General: Install field joints in accordance with the
 manufacturer’s instructions and the following:

 430-7.3.2.3 Joint Design: Ensure that the pipe manufacturer submits
 details to the Engineer regarding configuration of the joint and gasket required to effect a
 satisfactory seal. Do not apply mortar, joint compound, or other filler which would restrict the
 flexibility of the gasket joint.
 430-7.4 Requirements for Concrete Radius Pipe:
 430-7.4.1 Design: Construct concrete radius pipe in segments not longer than
 4 feet (along the pipe centerline), except where another length is called for in the Contract
 Documents. Join each segment using round rubber gaskets. Ensure that the pipe manufacturer
 submits details of the proposed joint, segment length and shape for approval by the Engineer,
 prior to manufacture.
 430-7.4.2 Pre-Assembly: Ensure that the manufacturer pre-assembles the entire
 radius section in his yard, in the presence of the Engineer, to ensure a proper fit for all parts. At
 the option of the manufacturer, the Contractor may assemble the pipe without gaskets.

 Consecutively number the joints on both the interior and exterior surfaces of each joint, and
 make match marks showing proper position of joints. Install the pipe at the project site in the
 same order as pre-assembly.
 430-8 Specific Requirements for Corrugated Metal Pipe.
 430-8.1 Field Joints:
 430-8.1.1 General: Make a field joint with locking bands, as specified in
 Article 9 of AASHTO M36 and AASHTO M196M for aluminum pipe. For aluminum pipe,
 fabricate bands from the same alloy as the culvert sheeting.
 When existing pipe to be extended is helically fabricated, make a field
 joint between the existing pipe and the new pipe using one of the following methods:
 1. Cut the new pipe to remove one of the re-rolled annular end
 sections required in Sections 943 or 945, or fabricate the pipe so that the re-rolled annular section
 is fabricated only on one end. Use either a spiral (helical) band with a gasket or a flat band with
 gaskets as required by 430-8.1.2 (2) to join the pipe sections.
 2. The Contractor may construct a concrete jacket as shown on
 Standard Plans, Index 430-001.
 430-8.1.2 Side Drain, Storm and Cross Drain, and Gutter Drains: Where
 corrugated metal pipe is used as side drain, storm and cross drain, or gutter drain, use a rubber or
 neoprene gasket of a design shown to provide a joint as specified in 430-4.
 Use a gasket of one of the following dimensions:
 1. For annular joints with 1/2 inch depth corrugation: either a
 single gasket a minimum of 7 inches by 3/8 inch or two gaskets a minimum of 3-1/2 inches by
 3/8 inch; and for annular joints with 1 inch depth corrugations: either a single gasket a minimum
 of 7 inches by 7/8 inch or two gaskets a minimum of 3-1/2 inches by 7/8 inch.
 2. For helical joints with 1/2 inch depth corrugation: either a single
 gasket a minimum of 5 inches by 1 inch or two gaskets a minimum of 3-1/2 inches by 1 inch; and
 for helical joints with 1 inch depth corrugations: either a single gasket a minimum of 5 inches by
 1-1/2 inches or two gaskets a minimum of 3-1/2 inches by 1-1/2 inches.
 3. Such other gasket designs as may be approved by the Engineer.
 If, in lieu of a single gasket spanning the joint, two gaskets are used, place
 these individual gaskets approximately 2 inches from each pipe end at the joint. When two
 gaskets are used, seal the overlapping area on the coupling band between the gaskets consistent
 with the joint performance specified. The Contractor may tuck a strip of preformed gasket
 material over the bottom lip of the band for this purpose. Use coupling bands that provide a
 minimum circumferential overlap of 3 inches. As the end connections on the coupling band are
 tightened, ensure that there is no local bending of the band or the connection. Use precurved
 coupling bands on pipe diameters of 24 inches or less.
 Use flat gaskets meeting the requirements of ASTM D1056, designation
 2C2 or 2B3. In placing flat gaskets on pipe prior to placing the coupling band, do not stretch the
 gasket more than 15% of its original circumference. Use circular gaskets meeting the
 requirements of ASTM C361. Do not stretch the circular gasket more than 20% of its original
 circumference in placing the gasket on pipe. Use preformed plastic gasket material meeting the
 composition requirements of 942-2.2.

 Apply an approved vegetable soap lubricant, as specified for concrete pipe
 
 in 430-7.1.1.
 
 430-8.1.3 Alternate Joint: In lieu of the above-specified combination of locking
 bands and flat gaskets, the Contractor may make field joints for these pipe installations by the
 following combinations:
 1. Use the metal bands as specified in Article 9 of AASHTO M36M that
 are at least 10-1/2 inches wide and consist of a flat central section with a corrugated section near
 each end, designed to match the annular corrugation in the pipe with which they are to be used.
 Connect the bands in a manner approved by the Engineer, with a suitable fastening device such
 as the use of two galvanized 1/2 inch diameter bolts through a galvanized bar and galvanized
 strap, suitably welded to the band. Use a strap that is the same gage as the band.
 Where helically corrugated pipe is to be jointed by this alternate
 combination, ensure that at least the last two corrugations of each pipe section are annular, and
 designed such that the band will engage each pipe end with the next-to-outside annular
 corrugation.
 2. For these bands, use a rubber gasket with a circular cross-section of the
 “O-ring” type conforming to ASTM C361. Use gaskets having the following cross-sectional
 diameter for the given size of pipe:
 Non-SI Units
 
 Pipe Size
 12 inches through 36 inches (with 1/2 inch depth corrugations)

 5. The inside surface of the bell at the end of the bell must be flared to
 facilitate joining the pipe sections without damaging or displacing the gasket.
 449-5.2 When Rubber Gaskets are Used: Ensure that the pipe joints have been tested at
 the plant hydrostatically and shown to meet the requirements of Section 6.2 of the Materials
 Manual, which is available at the following URL:
 http://www.fdot.gov/programmanagement/Implemented/URLinSpecs/Section62V2.shtm.
 449-5.3 When Profile Rubber Gaskets are Used: Ensure the joint design meets the
 requirements set forth in Article 7 of ASTM C443.
 449-5.4 Tolerances in Imperfections, and Permissible Repairs for Joint of Concrete
 Gasketed Pipe: Ensure that all surfaces of near-contact of the jointed pipes are free from air
 holes, chipped or spalled concrete, laitance, and other such defects.
 Pipes showing minor manufacturing imperfections or handling injuries to the bell
 or spigot may be acceptable if such defects are acceptably repaired as prescribed below.
 Individual air holes (trapped air), or spalled areas with a length of up to one-half
 the pipe radius, or 12 inches whichever is less, may be repaired by careful use of a hand-placed,
 stiff, pre-shrunk, 1-to-1 mortar of cement and fine sand, and with no additional preparation other
 than a thorough washing with water of the defect. Curing will be done either by moisture curing
 under wet burlap or by application of an approved membrane curing compound. Such repaired
 pipe which is sound, properly finished and cured, and which otherwise conforms to specification
 requirements will be acceptable.
 Exposed reinforcing and minor spalling in the spigot groove may be accepted if
 repaired in the following manner: The spalled areas will be chipped back to solid concrete.
 Exposed reinforcing will be cleaned of all laitance and scale. The entire area is to be coated with
 an approved epoxy at a thickness of 5 to 10 mils. The coating must be smooth and conform to the
 shape of the groove. The epoxy must be a Type F-1 as specified in Section 926.

 SECTION 450
 PRECAST PRESTRESSED CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION
 450-1 Description.
 Fabricate, store, transport and erect precast/prestressed concrete members prestressed by
 the pretensioning method. Pretensioned precast prestressed concrete products are products
 prestressed by the pretensioning method. In this method, steel or fiber reinforced polymer (FRP)
 components are stressed and anchored; the concrete for the product is then cast and cured, and
 finally the stress in the steel or FRP components is released from the anchorages to the concrete
 through bond, after the concrete has attained its specified release strength.
 A precast prestressed concrete plant, hereinafter called plant, is an independent operating
 facility capable of performing all the operations necessary to fabricate precast/prestressed
 concrete products.
 Obtain precast/prestressed products from a plant that is currently on the Department’s
 Production Facility Listing. Producers seeking inclusion on the list shall meet the requirements
 of Section 105.
 When the Producer’s Quality Control Program is suspended, accept responsibility of
 either obtaining precast/prestressed products from a precast/prestressed concrete plant with an
 accepted Quality Control Program, or await re-approval of the Producer Quality Control
 Program. The Engineer will not allow changes in Contract Time or completion dates as a result
 of the concrete plant’s Quality Control Program suspension. Accept responsibility for all delay
 costs or other costs associated with the plant’s Quality Control Program suspension.
 450-2 Quality Control Program.
 450-2.1 General: Develop a Producer Quality Control Program as specified in
 Section 105.
 Meet the requirements of the accepted Quality Control Program, Contract
 Documents, and Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI) Manual for Quality Control for
 plants and production of structural precast concrete products. The requirements of the Contract
 Documents will govern, when there is a discrepancy between the PCI Manual and the Contract
 Documents.
 Accept responsibility for performing daily Quality Control (QC) inspections of all
 phases of work ensuring all materials and workmanship incorporated into the product meet the
 requirements of the Contract Documents. Also, maintain a daily activity report detailing the
 results of the daily Quality Control Program activities. Ensure these daily reports and minutes of
 the weekly meetings with the Engineer and the plant’s production personnel are maintained at
 the plant. During the weekly meetings, discuss the results of the QC inspections.
 Inspect the product for conformance with the product dimension tolerances shown
 in Appendix B of PCI Manual MNL-116 (Manual for Quality Control for Plants and Production
 of Structural Precast Concrete Products), except as modified herein. Apply the tolerances with
 respect to the theoretical positions and dimensions shown in the Plans. Apply the same
 tolerances for U-Beams as those specified for I-girders, excluding sweep tolerance, when
 inspecting the product for conformance with dimension tolerances. For Florida U-Beam
 diaphragms, the tolerance for the thickness of the intermediate and end diaphragms is plus 1 inch
 and minus 1/2 inch, and the location of intermediate diaphragms, relative to design plan
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 480
 
 positions, is plus or minus 3 inches. The tolerance of the thickness of end diaphragms shall be
 plus 3 inches and minus 1/2 inch.
 Limit sweep to 1/2 inch for U-Beams and Inverted-T Beams. The tolerance for
 beam strand sheathing is plus or minus 2 inches.
 Ensure the tolerance on all miscellaneous shaping including, but not limited to,
 chamfers, miters, bevels, keys, tapers, radii, holes, inserts, and block outs is within plus or minus
 1/8 inch of the control dimension of the shape.
 The tolerances represent the total allowable tolerance that will be accepted in the
 finished product. Do not apply tolerances shown for the overall dimensions of a member to
 violate the tolerances shown for positions of reinforcing and prestressing steel or FRP. Apply the
 tolerances during and after the fabrication of prestressed products. Do not reduce the concrete
 cover for reinforcing steel, FRP reinforcing, prestressing steel, FRP prestressing strands, or any
 other metallic objects specified in the Plans more than 1/4 inch. Do not reduce the concrete cover
 for reinforcing steel, FRP reinforcing, prestressing steel, FRP prestressing strands, or any other
 metallic or plastic objects when the cover specified in the Plans is minimum cover.
 Ensure the QC inspector is present during concrete placements and performs
 inspection during all fabrication of precast prestressed concrete products, including the
 inspection of the operations before, during and after the placement of concrete.
 Ensure the Plant QC Manager, or the QC inspectors under their direction,
 examine all precast prestressed concrete products within five working days of detensioning to
 ensure their dimensions conform to the specified tolerances and to determine if there are any
 deficiencies. This process control shall be listed on the Producer Quality Control Plan (QC Plan).
 450-2.2 Plant: Ensure each plant has an onsite QC Manager meeting the requirements of
 Section 105.
 450-2.3 Product Certification: Ensure the QC inspector inspects all completed products
 at the plant not less than 24 hours before shipment to verify that all Contract Documents
 requirements are met. Upon verification that all Contract Document requirements have been met
 and all necessary repairs have been satisfactorily completed, the product will be stamped with
 the approved QC Manager stamp identified in the Producer QC Plan.
 With each monthly request submitted for payment, attach a certification stating
 that the listed precast prestressed products have been produced under the Producer QC Plan and
 meet the Contract Document requirements. Ensure the certification is signed by a legally
 responsible person of the plant and is submitted on the plant’s letterhead.
 450-2.4 Documentation: Ensure that a system of records is maintained in each plant
 which will provide all information regarding the certification and testing of prestressing steel,
 FRP prestressing strands, reinforcing steel, FRP reinforcing, concrete materials and concrete,
 curing materials, embedded items, tensioning, concrete proportioning, pre-placement, placement,
 post-placement inspections, curing, and disposition of products. Include in the record keeping the
 deficiencies found as a result of the inspection and testing. Keep certified test reports for all
 materials incorporated into the production of precast prestressed concrete products.
 Ensure that the record of tensioning operations is maintained and reflects the
 identification of the bed, type of fabricated products, the complete Financial Project
 Identification Number, jack identification number, date prestressing strands were stressed,
 temperature at the time of stressing, and signature of the qualified tensioning machine operator.
 Ensure the proposed method and format for documenting required information is
 included in the Producer QC Plan.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 481
 
 Maintain records until all the precast prestressed products for a project have been
 fabricated then submit all the records to the Engineer. Ensure records are available at all times
 for the Engineer’s inspection.
 450-2.5 Quality Assurance Inspection and Testing: The Engineer will perform
 periodic inspections, sampling, and testing to ensure of the quality and acceptability of the
 materials, methods, techniques, procedures and processes being utilized by the Contractor in the
 fabrication of precast prestressed concrete products.

 ** The FRP spirals cannot be used in combination with steel prestressing strand..
 *** Use membrane curing compounds and sealers that are compatible with
 coating or other materials that are applied to concrete surface.
 Use inserts in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturers and
 within their certified capacities and application qualifications. Do not use aluminum inserts.
 Use draped strand devices of sufficient rigidity having adequate support to retain
 the position of the strand unchanged under the induced load. Do not allow the devices to induce
 friction to the tendons such that the required jacking force and elongation cannot be attained.
 450-3.2 Strand Chucks and Splice Chucks: For pretensioning, use strand chucks that
 are capable of anchoring the strands without slippage after seating and ensure against strand
 failure within the grips at loads less than 95% of ultimate strength.

 prestressing force from one prestressing tendon to another are capable to hold at least 95% of the
 ultimate tensile strength of the prestressing strand.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 482
 
 Do not use wedges that become worn, cracked, deformed, or that allow dead end
 seating in excess of 3/8 inch. Use components from the same manufacturer to make up chucks
 and to provide proper wedge fit.
 Use chucks as complete units. Clean, inspect, and lubricate the chucks between
 each use. Use wedges and housing that are compatible and made for the specific type and size of
 prestressing strand that are being used, avoid improper fit and improper seating of wedges on the
 strands.
 The Engineer will allow one splice per strand subject to the following:
 1. Splices are located outside the concrete products (except for precast
 piling where up to two splices are permitted to be used in each pile, so long as they are not
 located in the same vertical cross section, perpendicular to longitudinal axis of the pile).
 2. Strands which are being spliced have the “lay” or “twist” in the same
 direction.
 450-4 Material Acceptance and Testing.
 450-4.1 Concrete: Perform the QC sampling and testing of concrete in accordance with
 the requirements of Section 346.
 450-4.2 Reinforcing ,Welded Wire Reinforcement and Prestressing Steel for
 Pretensioning:
 450-4.2.1 General: Identify all reinforcing steel, welded wire reinforcement and
 prestressing strand for pretensioning by LOTs. A LOT of reinforcing steel or welded wire is a
 shipment of material from the same manufacturer and heat. A LOT of prestressing steel is a
 shipment of material of the same size, production grade and heat from the same manufacturer. A
 LOT of FRP reinforcing bars or prestressing strands is a shipment of material of the same size,
 fiber lot and resin batch from the same manufacturer.
 Acceptance of reinforcing bars, welded wire reinforcement and
 prestressing steel for pretensioning is based on manufacturer’s certification and the Department’s
 verification tests. The sampling for verification testing will be performed by the Department at
 each precast plant, on at least two LOTs per year, additional samples may be taken at the
 manufacturing source of reinforcing bars, welded wire reinforcement and prestressing strands.
 When products contain the material that has failed to meet the
 requirements of 450-3, reject the unused material of the failed LOT. The Engineer may require
 the evaluation of the products, which contain the failed material, in accordance with 450-14.
 450-4.2.2 Steel Reinforcing and Welded Wire Reinforcement: Obtain and
 maintain for each LOT a certified mill analysis, physical property test report and the
 manufacturer’s assigned LOT number with the heat of the material represented. Verify that the
 report represents the steel received and that the steel meets the Contract Documents
 requirements. Reject all unidentified reinforcing steel or welded wire reinforcement received at
 the plant or job site.
 Submit the manufacturer’s certified mill analysis and provide three 7 foot
 long, randomly selected samples from the designated LOT of reinforcing steel and three
 randomly selected samples from the designated LOT of welded wire reinforcement when
 requested by Engineer. Ensure each sample of welded wire reinforcement covers an area of four
 intersections of transverse and longitudinal bars. Ensure the transverse wires of each piece of
 welded wire reinforcement extend approximately 6 inches to both sides.
 450-4.2.3 Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) Reinforcing: Meet the requirements
 of 932-3.

 450-4.2.8 Ducts: Obtain and maintain certified test results certifying that the
 material meets the requirements of 450-3.
 450-5 Shop Drawings.
 Submit shop drawings for all pretensioned prestressed concrete products containing FRP
 bars or strands. Submit shop drawings for all other pretensioned prestressed concrete products
 when the Contract Documents do not contain all the detailed information necessary to fabricate
 and erect the pretensioned prestressed concrete product. Ensure the submitted shop drawings
 meet the requirements of 5-1 and any additional Contract Document requirements.
 Shop drawings are not required to depict supplemental reinforcing steel used to facilitate
 fabrication of products.
 In lieu of shop drawings, submit the following to the Engineer:
 1. The Framing Plan with product designations for all superstructure components.
 2. Strand detensioning schedule.
 3. Tensioning and elongation calculations.
 4. Details of supplemental steel that remains as part of the finished product.
 5. Drawings, details and spacing for embedded items associated with fall
 protection systems used on beams.
 6. When proposing to use materials and/or methods that differ from the
 requirements of the Contract Documents, submit full plan details and Specifications for the
 alternate materials and methods. Ensure the alternate materials and methods meet the following
 requirements:
 a. The provisions of the Contract Documents.
 b. The AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, edition with
 interims as referenced in Plans.
 c. The recommendations of the material manufacturer.

 484
 
 f. Ultimate strength of the structure with the proposed changes is not less
 than the ultimate strength of the original design.
 g. The provisions of the Departments Structures Design Guidelines.
 450-6 Forms.
 450-6.1 General: Use metal side and bottom forms, unless otherwise specified in the
 Contract Documents. For members with special shapes such as corner sheet piles, wood forms
 are permitted. Slab units and sheet piles may be cast on concrete surfaces meeting the profile
 dimensional tolerances of 450-6.3. Apply release agents in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 recommendations. Liquid membrane curing compounds may be used to prevent bonding of slab
 products and sheet piles to the existing concrete surface, when applied in two or more coating.
 Ensure the last application of liquid membrane is applied immediately before placement of the
 slab or sheet pile.
 For all beam members, use side forms designed to be removed without damaging
 the top flange of the beam. Remove the forms horizontally away from the beam by a method that
 prevents any contact of the form with the top flange after release of the form. Do not subject the
 top flange to any vertical force at any time. Include the form details and method of removal in
 the Producer QC Plan.
 For all Florida-I Beams, use forms that do not have more than two horizontal
 joints.
 Use void forms of a type for which service adequacy has been demonstrated,
 having sufficient strength to provide stability during handling and placing and to withstand
 hydrostatic pressures and other forces imposed upon them during concrete placement. Use form
 material that is neutral with respect to the generation of products harmful to the physical and
 structural properties of the concrete. Ensure that the presence of the form materials does not
 cause any detrimental effect to the concrete or other materials within the member. Positively vent
 all voids to the outside of the member. For end headers and inside forms, other materials capable
 of resisting the pressure from concrete are permitted, except that end headers used with CFRP
 strands must be either timber headers or steel headers with rubber grommets to protect the CFRP
 strands from damage.
 Use end headers so designed that they can be placed and maintained in correct
 position between the side forms. Hold the headers in place with devices capable of being
 removed or loosened after the concrete has attained its initial set allowing free form expansion
 during curing methods that involve heat. Use end headers with openings conforming to the
 prestressing strand pattern to permit passage of the prestressing strand. Locate the openings
 accurately within 1/8 inch of planned location of prestressing strand elements.
 Construct circular openings for strands a maximum of 1/4 inch larger than the
 nominal strand diameter. Construct square or rectangular openings a maximum of 1/4 inch
 larger, horizontally and vertically, than the nominal strand diameter. Ensure that all headers are
 mortar tight.
 450-6.2 Supports: Use forms of sufficient thickness, with adequate external bracing and
 stiffeners, which are anchored to withstand the forces due to placement and vibration of concrete.
 Ensure that joints in forms are mortar tight. Support bottom forms on concrete pallets with metal
 stiffeners, wales or shims. Do not use timber elements between the bottom metal form and
 concrete pallets.

 485
 
 450-6.3 Alignment: Make and maintain during their use, forms and centering true to the
 shapes and dimensions for the product being produced. Plumb, align, and secure forms for each
 product in position before each reuse.
 Apply the following tolerances to form alignment and pallets or beds used in
 prestressed construction:
 1. Horizontal Alignment (horizontal deviation of side forms either side of
 a vertical plane within the length of a product) = 1/8 inch,
 2. Vertical Alignment (vertical deviation of the bed or pallet from a
 horizontal plane within the length of a product) = 1/8 inch,
 3. For vertical joints, Offset Between Adjacent Form Sections = 1/8 inch.
 4. For horizontal joints, Offset Between Adjacent Form Sections =
 1/16 inch.
 450-6.4 End Header Locations:
 450-6.4.1 General: Provide a minimum of 18 inches of exposed strands from the
 end header to the stressing anchorage and between adjacent ends of all products except 24 inches
 square and smaller piles. Provide a minimum of 6 inches of exposed strands between adjacent
 ends of 24 inches square and smaller piles.
 450-6.4.2 Cold Weather: Provide a distance of at least 5 feet from the end header
 to the stressing anchorage, when the ambient temperature is expected to be below 55ºF between
 the time of tensioning and detensioning. When the ambient temperature is expected to be below
 55ºF between the time of tensioning and detensioning and the product's exposed strands between
 the stressing anchorages are not protected, maintain a 25 foot minimum free length of stressed
 strands, between the end header and the stressing anchorage at each end of a bed line. When cold
 weather concrete conditions as specified in 450-10.1 are in effect, protect all exposed strands
 between stressing anchorages regardless of length. When the products and strands between
 stressing anchorages are protected, provide protection adequate to maintain the ambient
 temperature of the air around the strands at or greater than 55ºF until the products are
 detensioned or 24 hours after placing concrete, whichever is less.
 450-6.5 Surface Conditions: Use clean, rust free form surfaces against which concrete is
 to be cast. Inspect forms and, if necessary, recondition them.
 450-6.6 Form Ties: Ensure that no form wires or metal pieces are left within 2 inches of
 the surface of the finished concrete.
 450-6.7 Corners, Angles and Joints: Ensure corners and angles are chamfered, mitered,
 or rounded with a radius of 3/4 inch, unless otherwise specified or shown in the Plans. Provide
 smooth mortar tight joints between panel forms within the alignment tolerances.
 450-6.8 Form Release Agent: Before placing concrete, treat the facing of all forms with
 a form release agent in accordance with the manufacturer’s requirements. Ensure the application
 of form release agents does not contaminate prestressing strands and/or reinforcing steel.
 450-7 Protection and Placement of Prestressing Strand.
 450-7.1 Protection of Prestressing Strand: Maintain and store prestressing steel above
 the ground surface on platforms, skids, or other supports, to prevent contamination from below,
 and protect them from mechanical injury. Do not use any packaging or wrapping material that
 retains moisture at the bottom of the reel. Clean contaminated prestressing strand before use or
 otherwise reject it. Handle prestressing strand carefully to prevent nicks or kinks. Do not expose
 steel prestressing strand to temperatures greater than 200ºF at any time. Do not expose CRFP
 prestressing strand to temperatures greater than 120°F at any time. Do not use arc welding

 486
 
 equipment, including welding electrode lines, within 2 feet of prestressing strand. Do not
 perform any welding on forms that have been set in place after the prestressing strand is placed
 in the bed. Reject prestressing strand that has sustained any physical damage at any time.
 450-7.2 Placing Prestressing Strand: Use care during placement of prestressing strand
 to avoid physical damage and contamination. Reject damaged strands. Do not use prestressing
 steel containing nicks, kinks, or former chuck grip marks. Do not use prestressing strand
 showing evidence of scale formation or which has become pitted. Remove and replace any
 damaged prestressing strand in the bed.
 450-7.3 Cleanliness of Prestressing Strand: Inspect the prestressing strand for any
 evidence of contamination. Use strand that is free of deleterious materials such as grease, oil,
 wax, dirt, paint (except that used for marking identification) or other similar contaminants.
 Remove any contaminants detected from the strand before proceeding with fabrication activities.
 Rust on prestressing steel that can be removed by light rubbing is acceptable. Streaks or spots
 which may remain after rust removal are acceptable if no pitting is present.
 450-7.4 Debonded Strands: Extend the tubular debonding material (sheathing) through
 the header for debonded prestressing strand. Tie and tape the debonding material at the terminus
 located at the inside of the member. Seal openings between strand and sheathing for debonded
 strands with 100% silicone sealant within seven calendar days of detensioning. The sealing of
 openings between strand and sheathing is not required for beams with ends not be encased in
 permanent concrete diaphragms per 450-11.5 and strand protection per 450-11.6. Use sheathing
 that is tubular non-slit, high-density plastic with a minimum wall thickness of 0.025 inch, and an
 inside diameter exceeding the maximum outside diameter of the pretensioning strand by
 0.025 inch to 0.14 inch, which does not react with concrete, coating, steel, or FRP, and prevents
 the intrusion of water or cement paste during concrete placement.
 Do not use strands debonded over the full length of a product.
 450-8 Tensioning Equipment and Operations.
 450-8.1 Equipment: Use a hydraulic jacking system that is adjustable to the automatic
 application and sustaining of a predetermined load, together with a pressure transducer or load
 cell built into the hydraulic system. Connect such pressure gage or transducer to a dial or digital
 readout and printer (manual recording of the tensioning operations is permitted) which will
 provide an instantaneous readout and record of the applied load in pounds. Use a jacking system
 with the capacity to induce the required load. Base the use of this system on demonstrated
 accuracy and repeatability of plus or minus 2% of anticipated load verified through comparison
 with loads indicated by an independent load cell.
 Calibrate all jacking systems before using and repeat calibration at intervals not
 exceeding 12 months. Calibrate and recalibrate in accordance with the equipment manufacturer’s
 recommendations, by qualified calibration agency or by plant personnel under the supervision of
 a Specialty Engineer.
 Calibrate gages, jacks and pumps as a system in the same manner they are used in
 tensioning operations with the cylinder extension in the approximate position that it will be in
 actual use at final jacking force. In multi-strand tensioning systems, gages may be calibrated
 against a master gage of known accuracy, provided that the other units of the system are
 calibrated against the same master gage. Ensure calibrations cover the load ranges that will be
 used during production. Verify the accuracy setting of the automatic cutoff valves by running the
 desired cutoff load. Ensure a certified calibration curve accompanies each tensioning system.
 Load readings can be used directly if the calibration determines a reading is within plus or minus
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 487
 
 2% tolerance of anticipated load. Ensure calibration of load cells or proving rings used to
 calibrate jacking systems are on compression force testing equipment that has been calibrated in
 accordance with ASTM E74.
 When any jack or gage appears to be giving erratic results, or if the jack force and
 elongation do not compare within specified limits and differences cannot be justified while work
 is in progress, recalibrate the equipment. Also verify the accuracy of the equipment after internal
 jacking system repairs or when gage and jacking units are switched.
 Calibrate or recalibrate in accordance with ASTM E4 using equipment that is
 calibrated in accordance with ASTM E74. After calibration or recalibration has been completed,
 prepare a certificate and have it signed by the person in responsible charge of the verifications as
 outlined in ASTM E4 and ASTM E74. Ensure that the calibration report includes, the serial
 number of the equipment that is calibrated, calibration chart in a graph or tabular form,
 calibration date, temperature, full range of readings before and after calibration, National
 Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST’s) traceable number of calibration device, method
 of calibration, calibration agency, and laboratory or Engineer supervising the calibration.
 Verify the accuracy of the jacking and recording system a minimum of once each
 week during tensioning operations by either an independently calibrated load cell, or by
 comparison with calculated strand elongation. When weekly verification is to be performed by
 comparison with calculated strand elongation, check a minimum of ten strands and the difference
 in the indicated load and the load determined from the elongation must agree within 5% of the
 computed theoretical load values. If the differences are greater than 5%, suspend the tensioning
 operation, evaluate the tensioning operation by qualified personnel and correct any deficiencies
 before proceeding.
 When weekly verification is done by load cell, perform a minimum of five spot
 checks to the maximum anticipated load of strands. Use a load cell or proving ring that is
 calibrated in accordance with ASTM E74 and the accuracy of the force must be traceable to
 NIST. Maintain written records of readings obtained from the force recording system and
 verifying standard. Ensure the weekly verification record includes the serial number of the
 equipment, verification date, verification agency, NIST traceable number of calibration standard,
 and name of the person making the spot checks. The load reading from the recording system
 must agree within plus or minus 2% of the anticipated load indicated by the load cell or proving
 ring that are calibrated annually.
 450-8.2 Operations:
 450-8.2.1 General: The tensioning operations consist of the application of the
 final force or load which is the force required by the Plans and with the adjustments for abutment
 rotation, bed shortening, anchorage header movement, live end seating, dead end seating, splice
 chuck seating, friction in the jacking system and any other elements as applicable for the type of
 bed and anchorage being used. Also, adjust the force required by the Plans when the temperature
 differential between the ambient temperature at time of stressing and the expected concrete
 temperature at time of placement is greater than 25ºF. Increase the force at the rate of 1% for
 each 10ºF increment that the ambient temperature at time of stressing is below the expected
 concrete temperature at time of placing. Decrease the force at the rate of 1% for each 10ºF that
 the ambient temperature at time of stressing is above the expected concrete temperature at the
 time of placing. Do not allow the stress in the steel prestressing strand to exceed 80% of the
 specified tensile strength of the strand, after seating. Do not allow the stress in the CFRP
 prestressing strand to exceed 65% of the specified tensile strength of the strand, after seating.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 488
 
 During each tensioning operation, for the verification of the live and dead end seating, check the
 seating of at least 4 strands or a minimum of 10% of the total number of strands, whichever is
 greater. Maintain a record of the tensioning operation.
 Compensation for temperature differential and abutment rotation are not
 required for self-stressing beds. However, adjust the final load for the effects of bed shortening
 due to the load from all the strands.
 If the placement of concrete is delayed for more than seven calendar days
 after the completion of the stressing operation, check and adjust the final strand load as necessary
 before placement of concrete and maintain a record of the stressing operation.
 Accomplish tensioning by either single strand tensioning or multiple
 strand tensioning, and ensure that it is symmetrical about the vertical axis of the product.
 Tensioning methods, in general, consist of tensioning to the required loads indicated by the
 jacking system, or tensioning to the required load while monitoring the elongation of the
 prestressing strand.
 450-8.2.2 Single Straight Strand Tensioning: Apply an initial force of 5% to
 25% of the final force to eliminate slack in the system. When single straight strand tensioning is
 used, tension the prestressing strand until the required final force is attained. Measure and record
 the force and elongation.
 450-8.2.3 Multiple Straight Strand Tensioning: Apply the initial uniform
 tensioning load to each individual strand before the application of full tensioning load to the
 group of strands. The amount of the initial load will be influenced by the length of the casting
 bed and the size of strands in the group to be tensioned. The minimum initial tensioning load will
 be 5% of the required final load. Increase the magnitude of this load if deemed necessary but do
 not allow it to exceed 25% of the required final load. Then tension the strands by multiple strand
 tensioning to final load by pulling to elongation and checking against the jack load. Allow the
 required elongation to control the tensioning. The actual jack load must agree within 5% of the
 required load.
 For uniform application of load to strands, the face of anchorage at final
 load must be in a plane parallel to its position under initial load. Verify this by measurement of
 movement on opposite sides of the anchorage and check its plumb position before and after
 application of the final load. During tensioning, allow the anchorage to move without restraint.
 450-8.2.4 Draped Strand Tensioning: Tension draped strands by either partial
 tensioning and subsequent strains or by final tensioning in draped position.
 Partial stressing and subsequent strains applies when the strands are
 tensioned through a combination of applied jack loads and strand uplift. To verify the final force,
 place a load cell between the tensioning anchorage and anchor chucks at the dead end on at least
 two draped strands. Other methods as approved by the Engineer may be used to verify the final
 force in the dead end. Bring the partially draped strand to an initial tension using a force in the
 range of 5% to 25% of the required final tensioning force. After application of the initial force,
 establish reference marks for measuring elongation. Apply a pre-calculated jacking force and
 measure elongations on a minimum of four strands. The average measured elongation must agree
 within 5% of the theoretical elongation for strand force measured by jack load, or the factors
 contributing to the difference must be identified and corrected before proceeding. Allow the load
 indicated by the jacking system to control the tensioning for the pre-calculated load. Obtain the
 required final force by lifting or depressing the strand simultaneously at all pickup or hold down
 points or in an approved sequence as shown on the shop drawings. On each different bed setup,

 after lifting or depressing the strands to their final position, check the final force at the dead end
 of at least two strands on the bed. If the load is below the required tensioning force by more than
 5%, adjust it to the final load.
 When the final stressing is performed in the draped position, apply the
 tensioning load in two increments with the tendons being held in their draped positions. To
 verify the final force, place a load cell between the tensioning anchorage and anchor chucks at
 the dead end on at least two draped strands. Other methods as approved by the Engineer may be
 used to verify the final force in the dead end. Bring each strand to an initial tension of 5% to 25%
 of the final load before the application of the required final load. After application of the initial
 load, establish reference marks for measuring elongation. Then tension the strands to final load
 and measure the elongation. Allow the load indicated by the jacking system to control the
 tensioning for the initial and final loads. The measured elongation must agree within 5% of the
 theoretical elongation for the strand force measured by jack load, or the factors contributing to
 the difference must be identified and corrected before proceeding. When the jacking is
 performed at one end of the bed, check the applied load on two draped strands at the other end of
 the bed. If the load on the end opposite the jacking end is below the required value by more than
 5%, adjust the load to the required final load.
 450-8.2.5 Wire Breakage:
 450-8.2.5.1 Steel Prestressing Strand: Limit wire breakage to 2% of the
 total area of the strands in any product and verify that breakage is not indicative of a more
 extensive distress condition, otherwise reject all stranding. Replace individual strands with more
 than one wire failure.
 450-8.2.5.2 Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) Prestressing Strand:
 Replace individual strands with any wire failure.
 450-8.2.6 Position of Prestressing Strand: Position prestressing strand as shown
 in the Plans within the tolerances allowed in 450-2.1. Fix the required vertical and horizontal
 position of each prestressing strand at the ends of each product and at intervals within each
 product not exceeding 30 feet. Use the method of fixing the prestressing strand shown in the
 Producer QC Plan. When blocks are to be used for supporting prestressing strand, use those cast
 from concrete of the same mix design as used in the prestressed product. Stagger the location of
 blocks with an offset of 12 inches or greater and do not stack them.
 450-9 Placement of Reinforcing Bars and Other Embedded Materials.
 450-9.1 Reinforcing Bars and Supports: Tie and/or support in position all reinforcing
 steel in each product with other reinforcing bars in a manner that will accurately position the
 reinforcing bars throughout the fabrication process. Use types of ties and methods of tying
 recommended by the CRSI, including lacing. Do not tie reinforcing bars to debonded
 prestressing strands within the limits of the sheathing material.
 Tie or lace beam stirrup bars at a minimum of three points. Tie reinforcing bars,
 other than stirrup bars in beam ends, as a minimum, at every other intersection. Either tie or lace
 spirals in piling at all four corners in the 1 inch pitch area, at the top corners and bottom center in
 the 3 inch pitch area, and at the top corners in the center area. Tie the bottom center in the pile
 center area as necessary to maintain concrete cover. Bend all ties away from the form surface to
 provide maximum concrete cover.
 When shown in the Plans, weld reinforcing steel in accordance with the
 requirements of AWS Structural Welding Code D 1.4. Do not weld in the prestressing bed.
 450-9.2 Other Embedded Materials:
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 490
 
 450-9.2.1 Inserts and Lifting Devices:
 450-9.2.1.1 Placement: Locate inserts and lifting devices in accordance
 with the tolerances listed in 450-2.1. Use only non-metallic inserts and lifting devices with CFRP
 reinforced piling.
 450-9.2.1.2 Corrosion Protection: Provide corrosion protection for
 embedded metal lifting devices that would remain exposed after construction.
 After lifting operations using recessed metallic or non-metallic
 lifting devices are complete, backfill block-outs with a Type F epoxy compound meeting the
 requirements of Section 926 for a minimum distance of 2 inches beyond the perimeter of the
 metal device as measured parallel to the exposed concrete surface. If the block-out extends less
 than 2 inches beyond the perimeter of the metal device, extend the epoxy compound beyond the
 block-out along the concrete surface. If Type 304 or 316 stainless steel lifting devices are used,
 non-shrink grout meeting the requirements of Section 934 may be used to backfill the block-out
 within its limits.
 After lifting operations using flush or protruding metallic or nonmetallic lifting devices are complete, cut the lifting devices back to a minimum depth of 1 inch
 below the concrete surface and patch with a Type F epoxy compound meeting the requirements
 of Section 926. For all square prestressed piling, concrete sheet piling and concrete poles, cut and
 patch lifting devices before transporting from the casting yard.
 450-9.2.2 Placement of Bearing Assemblies: Set bearing assemblies designed to
 transmit reaction forces to the concrete in the position shown in the Plans. Place bearing plate
 assemblies or shoes which are to be cast in a product within appropriate tolerances as provided in
 450-2.1. Check the assemblies for position after stripping from the forms.
 450-10 Concrete Operations.
 450-10.1 Temperature Restrictions:
 450-10.1.1 Cold Weather Concreting: When the temperature of the surrounding
 air is expected to be below 40ºF within 24 hours after placing concrete, the temperature of the
 plastic concrete as placed must be 55ºF or greater. Maintain the temperature of the concrete after
 placement at or above 55ºF for the first 24 hours or until detensioning, whichever occurs first.
 For piles and other members with a minimum section dimension of 12 inches or more, maintain
 the temperature of the concrete after placement at or above 50°F for the first 24 hours or until
 detensioning, whichever occurs first. Make arrangements for heating, covering, insulating or
 housing the concrete work in advance of placement and maintain the required temperature
 without injury due to concentration of heat. Do not use direct fired heaters during the first
 24 hours after concrete placement, unless actions are taken to prevent exposure of the concrete to
 exhaust gases which contain carbon dioxide. Continuously monitor the temperature of the
 concrete or the ambient air around the product until the product is detensioned. Monitor by the
 use of thermocouples located in the product cross-section or temperature recording devices
 located under the enclosure. Provide one thermocouple or temperature recording device for each
 200 feet of bed length or part thereof. Locate the thermocouples within the products crosssection as shown in the Producer QC Plan or as approved by the Engineer. Record the monitored
 temperatures determined by each thermocouple. Review the recorded temperatures to ensure that
 they are within the specified limits. Initially calibrate recording devices or thermocouples and
 recalibrate them at least annually in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 450-10.1.2 Hot Weather Concreting: Meet the requirements of Section 346 for
 temperature requirements and special measures for mixing concrete in hot weather.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 491
 
 Apply fog mist spray of water to prestressing strands, steel reinforcing,
 FRP reinforcing, and steel forms just before placing the concrete when the hot weather
 concreting special measures are in effect and the temperature of steel forms or reinforcing steel is
 greater than 120ºF.
 450-10.2 Protection of Concrete from Weather: Have protection materials available
 before the concrete placement begins to cover the products in the event of rain during the
 placement of concrete. Protection materials may be tarps, curing blankets, or other impervious
 material that will not puncture when placed over protruding reinforcing and/or form elements.
 Include the method and materials for protection in the Producer QC Plan.
 450-10.3 Concrete Placement:
 450-10.3.1 General: Check forms, reinforcing bars, prestressing strand, vent
 pipes, anchorages and other embedded items for compliance with the Contract Documents before
 placing concrete. Place concrete in accordance with 400-7, except as modified herein.
 For concrete operations conducted at night, provide enough lighting to
 allow visual inspection of the interior of the forms during the complete concrete placement
 operation.
 Convey concrete by the use of buckets, conveyors, pumps, troughs, or
 other equipment specifically designed for concrete conveyance, provided the placement method
 consistently produces quality concrete with no segregation or separation of the mix. Locate the
 concrete conveyance equipment within 12 inches of the top of the forms or surface of the
 concrete to minimize the free fall of the concrete.
 Multiple placements may be used within a bedline, provided compliance
 with 450-11.1 is maintained.
 450-10.3.2 Requirements for Successive Layers: Except for self-consolidating
 (self-compacting) concrete, place concrete as described in 450-10.3.2.1 through 450-10.3.2.5 as
 shown in the Producer QC Plan or as approved in writing by the Engineer.
 In any progressive concrete placement operation, do not allow the time
 between successive placements onto previously placed concrete to exceed 20 minutes, unless the
 previously placed concrete has not yet stiffened, as evidenced by the continued effective use of
 vibration.
 450-10.3.2.1 AASHTO Type II, Florida-I Beam 36 and Double-T
 Beams, Piling and Precast Slab Units (Except Voided Piling and Slabs): Place concrete in
 one or more layers or lifts. If more than one layer is used for Double-T Beams, end the first layer
 such that the top of the concrete is slightly below the bottom of the flange.
 450-10.3.2.2 AASHTO Type III, Type IV and Florida-I Beams 45 and
 54 and Voided Units (Slabs and Piling): Place concrete in a minimum of two horizontal layers.
 The thickness of the first layer will be such that the top of the concrete is just above the top of
 the bottom flange. In voided units, end the first layer slightly above the middle height of the
 void. Fill the form by the last layer.
 450-10.3.2.3 All Beams 63 Inches or Deeper: Place concrete in a
 minimum of three horizontal layers. The thickness of the first layer will be such that the top of
 the concrete is slightly above the top of the bottom flange. The thickness of the second layer will
 be such that the top of the concrete is slightly above the bottom of the top flange. Fill the beam
 forms by the last layer.
 450-10.3.2.4 Pretensioned I Beams Containing Longitudinal Posttensioning Ducts: Place concrete in one continuous lift beginning in the end block zone and
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 492
 
 progressing to the other end. Do not allow the progression of the concrete placement to proceed
 until previously placed concrete has been properly consolidated, and the rate of advancement
 equals the ability to fill the forms. In progression of the placement, deposit concrete within the
 forms on the surface of previously placed concrete.
 450-10.3.2.5 Florida U Beams: Place the concrete in Florida U Beams in
 a minimum of two horizontal layers. The thickness of the first layer shall be such that the top of
 the concrete is above the top of the bottom flange.
 450-10.4 Vibration of Concrete: Except for self-consolidating concrete, consolidate
 concrete in steel reinforced piling by internal or external vibration, or combination of these
 methods. For CFRP strand reinforced piling, use self-consolidating concrete without the use of
 vibration. If further consolidation is needed, manual rodding is permitted.
 Design external form vibrators for the specific use. Design forms used in
 conjunction with external vibration and build them to effectively transmit vibration to the
 concrete mass. Mount and operate form vibrators in compliance with the vibrator manufacturer’s
 written recommendations, a copy of which must be on file at the prestressed concrete plant.
 Secure vibrators to the form mounts by positive locking devices so that maximum vibration is
 transmitted into the form. Modify or replace external form vibrator systems that are
 demonstrated to be ineffective. Operate vibrators at each mount location for the time necessary
 for complete concrete consolidation. Do not allow progressive points of vibration to exceed
 twice the visually effective radius of vibration. Keep forms equipped with external vibrators
 clean, and free of any buildup of hardened concrete.
 Ensure internal vibrators are available before concrete placement is started. Use
 an internal vibrator with a head of such size that proper vibration of the concrete will be secured
 without causing movement of the prestressing strand or reinforcing bars. The vibrating frequency
 range must be 8,000 to 15,000 impulses per minute. Have at least one standby vibrator available
 on-site. Insert the vibrator in the concrete at points spaced to ensure uniform vibration of the
 entire mass of the concrete. Do not allow points of insertions to be further apart than the radius
 over which the vibrator is visibly effective. Allow the vibrator to sink into the concrete by its
 own weight and allow it to penetrate into the underlying layers sufficiently so that the two layers
 are thoroughly consolidated together. After the concrete is thoroughly consolidated, slowly
 withdraw the vibrator to avoid formation of holes.
 Revise the existing placement and consolidation procedure to improve the
 consolidation of the concrete, if the existing placement and consolidation procedure have
 produced unacceptable surface defects such as honeycombing, aggregate or mortar pockets, and
 excessive air bubbles.
 450-10.5 Finishing:
 450-10.5.1 General: When concrete incorporating silica fume is used, screed and
 finish with a continuous water fog mist maintained above the concrete. Do not apply the fog
 directly toward the concrete. The Contractor may apply a monomolecular finishing aid approved
 by the Engineer in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation.
 450-10.5.2 Beams: Rough float the top surface of the beam and then scrub it
 transversely with a coarse brush or metal tine to produce a roughened surface for bonding. For
 the other external surfaces of prestressed beams, unless otherwise specified, apply a General
 Surface Finish in accordance with 400-15.1. Remove mortar leakage and stains to produce
 beams with a uniform appearance.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 493
 
 450-10.5.3 Piling: Unless a Class 5 Applied Finish Coating is otherwise
 specified, apply a general surface finish as specified in Section 400 to pile surfaces, except that
 pointing with mortar will not be required for cosmetic chips and bug holes with a depth less than
 1/4 inch and a diameter of less than 3/4 inch. All other general surface finish requirements will
 apply, including the pointing of material form tie cavities with mortar. Surface finish deficiencies
 that meet the definition of noncomplying prestressed products must be corrected in accordance
 with 450-12. Miter or round the top corners similar to the corner radius of the pile forms.
 Surfaces exposed during casting must have a steel trowel finish.
 450-10.5.4 Slabs and Double-T Beams: When the Plans show the top surface of
 prestress slab or Double-T Beams units to be the riding surface, apply a Class 4 floor finish in
 accordance with Section 400. When the Plans show the surface to be overlaid with asphalt or
 concrete, rough float the top surface and then scrub it transversely with a coarse brush to remove
 all laitance and to produce a roughened surface for bonding. For the other external surfaces of
 slabs and double-T beams, unless otherwise specified, apply a General Surface Finish in
 accordance with 400-15.1.
 450-10.6 Curing: Cure prestressed concrete as required for a minimum duration of
 72 hours. If forms are loosened upon setting of concrete and/or removed before the 72 hour
 curing period is complete, expand the curing to cover the newly exposed surfaces by either
 coating with curing compound or extending the continuous moist cure area. Maintain concrete
 surface moisture at all times until curing is begun. If a water sheen is not present, apply
 supplemental moisture by fog misting or prevent water sheen loss on flat work by use of an
 evaporation retarder.
 After the finishing operations have been completed and as soon as the concrete
 has hardened sufficiently to permit the application of curing material without marring the
 exposed surface, cover the exposed surfaces of all prestressed concrete products by one of the
 following procedures or other alternate curing methods. Alternate curing methods and details
 proposed by the Contractor must be approved by the Engineer. Base alternate curing methods
 upon a demonstrated ability to retain surface moisture of the concrete and to control curing
 temperatures within acceptable limits. Discontinue use of any alternate curing method other than
 those included herein upon any indication of noncompliance with this Specification.
 450-10.6.1 Continuous Moisture: Place burlap on the surface and keep it
 continuously saturated for the curing period by means of soil soakers, leaking pipes, or automatic
 sprinklers. Do not apply moisture manually. If side forms are removed during the curing period,
 extend the burlap to completely shield the sides of the product. Water flow may be metered to
 cycle repetitively for five minutes on and five minutes off during the 72 hour curing period.
 When it is not practical to apply moisture or curing compound inside the voided piles, cover their
 ends with wet burlap to prevent moisture loss.
 450-10.6.2 Membrane Curing Compound: Apply a white Type 2 curing
 compound to all surfaces in a single-coat, continuous operation, at a uniform coverage as
 recommended by the manufacturer but not less than 1 gallon per 150 square feet. Apply the
 curing compound on the concrete surfaces that are still damp but no free standing water. Allow
 surfaces covered by the membrane curing compound to remain undisturbed for the curing period.
 Recoat any cracks, checks or other defects in the membrane seal which are detected during the
 curing period within one hour. If side forms are loosened during the curing period, remove them
 at that time and immediately coat the formed surfaces with a clear membrane curing compound
 and maintain the surface seal for the remainder of the curing period. Bottom surfaces must be
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 494
 
 similarly coated after removal of the forms. Remove membrane curing compound to applied
 surfaces of concrete products to which other concrete is to be bonded by sandblasting or waterblasting until all traces of membrane curing compound are removed.
 When the curing compound is applied by spraying, use a compressor
 driven sprayer of sufficient size to provide uniform spray at the nozzle. Keep all nozzles clean to
 ensure a uniform application of compound. For compressor driven sprayers, provide a calibrated
 reservoir which will allow the quantity of applied materials to be accurately determined.
 Maintain standby equipment in case of mechanical failure. If a mechanical failure occurs, a hand
 held pump-up sprayer may be used to apply curing compound to the remainder of the products
 cast in the day’s production. Suspend additional concrete placements until the mechanical
 sprayer is functioning properly.
 450-10.6.3 Curing Blankets: Curing blankets may be used for curing the top
 surfaces of products. Do not use curing blankets which have been torn or punctured. Securely
 fasten edges to provide as tight a seal as practical. Allow curing blankets to remain in place for
 the curing period. Should the system fail to maintain a moist condition on the concrete surface,
 discontinue the use of curing blankets and take immediate corrective action to prevent further
 loss of concrete moisture.
 450-10.7 Accelerated Curing:
 450-10.7.1 General: Use low-pressure steam curing, radiant heat curing or
 continuous moisture and heat curing. Do not use low-pressure steam or radiant heat curing with
 CFRP piling. If accelerated curing is completed before the curing period has elapsed, continue
 curing for the remaining part of the curing period in accordance with one of the curing methods
 above.
 If accelerated curing is used, furnish and use temperature recording
 devices that will provide accurate, continuous, and permanent records of the time and
 temperature relationship of the enclosure and concrete throughout the entire curing period. Place
 the temperature recording sensors at a minimum of two locations, spaced approximately at or
 near the third point of bed length, to measure the temperatures of the enclosure and concrete.
 Initially calibrate recording thermometers and recalibrate them at least annually in accordance
 with manufacturer’s recommendations. Place the sensors at the center of gravity of the bottom
 flanges for beams. Place the sensors at the center of gravity of the cross sections normal to pile
 length for solid piles, and at the midpoint of the wall thickness of the pile for voided piles.
 When the ambient air temperature is equal to or higher than 50ºF, start the
 accelerated curing by supplying or retaining moisture and the application of the heat, following
 the initial set period of concrete. Determine the initial set time in accordance with ASTM C403.
 During the application of heat, do not allow the temperature rise in the concrete product to
 exceed 36ºF per hour. The maximum curing temperature of the enclosure or concrete must not
 exceed 150ºF. Maintain the maximum curing temperature uniform throughout the enclosure,
 with variation of not more than 20ºF from the maximum peak temperature until concrete reaches
 the required release strength. Allow the concrete element to cool gradually at the maximum
 cooling rate of 50ºF per hour and continue the cooling at this rate until the concrete temperature
 is 40ºF or less above the ambient temperature outside the curing enclosure.
 When the ambient air temperature is below 50ºF cure the concrete in two
 stages. Start the accelerated curing of the first stage during the preset period by applying heat to
 increase the temperature of concrete at the maximum rate of 10ºF per hour. The total temperature
 gain of concrete during the initial set period cannot exceed 40ºF higher than the placement
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 495
 
 temperature, or 104ºF, whichever is less. Upon obtaining the initial set, continue curing as stated
 above for ambient temperature of 50ºF or higher. To prevent moisture loss on exposed surfaces
 during the preheating period, cover products as soon as possible after casting or keep the exposed
 surfaces wet by fog spray or wet blankets. Use enclosures for heat curing that allow free
 circulation of heat about the product and that are constructed to contain the heat with a minimum
 moisture loss. The use of tarpaulins or similar flexible covers may be used provided they are kept
 in good repair and secured in such a manner to prevent the loss of heat and moisture. Use
 enclosures that cover the entire bed from stressing abutment to stressing abutment, including all
 exposed stranding.
 450-10.7.2 Low-Pressure Steam: The steam must be in a saturated condition. Do
 not allow steam jets to impinge directly on the concrete, test cylinders, or forms. Cover control
 cylinders to prevent moisture loss and place them in a location where the temperature is
 representative of the average temperature of the enclosure.
 450-10.7.3 Curing with Radiant Heat: Apply radiant heat by means of pipe
 circulating steam, hot oil or hot water, or by electric heating elements. To prevent moisture loss
 during curing, keep the exposed surfaces wet by fog spray or wet blankets.
 450-10.7.4 Continuous Moisture and Heat: This method consists of heating the
 casting beds in combination with the continuous moisture method described above. Do not allow
 the heating elements to come in direct contact with the concrete or the forms. The initial
 covering of burlap and the continuous application of moisture will be as described in 450-10.6.
 An auxiliary cover in addition to the burlap for retention of the heat will be required over the
 entire casting bed. Support this cover a sufficient distance above the product being cured to allow
 circulation of the heat.
 450-10.8 Curing Requirements for Silica Fume Concrete: Use either a 72 hour
 continuous moisture curing or a (12-24) hour low-pressure steam curing in accordance with
 450-10.7. Upon completion of the low-pressure steam curing, continue curing for the remaining
 part of the 72 hour curing period by application of the curing compound, continuous moisture
 curing, or use of the curing blankets.
 If 72 hour continuous moisture is used, begin curing silica fume concrete
 immediately after the finishing operation is complete and keep a film of water on the surface by
 fogging until the curing blankets are in place. No substitution of alternative methods nor
 reduction in the time period is allowed. After completion of the 72 hour curing period, apply a
 membrane curing compound to all concrete surfaces. Apply curing compound according to
 450-10.6.
 450-10.9 Form Removal: Do not remove forms sooner than six hours after casting and
 not until the concrete strength is sufficient to avoid structural damage. For AASHTO Type V,
 Type VI, Florida-I Beams, and Bulb-T Beams, do not remove the forms supporting the top
 flange concrete sooner than 12 hours after casting unless the release strength has been reached.
 450-11 Detensioning.
 450-11.1 General: The required concrete strength at which the prestressing force may be
 transferred to the concrete in a product will be a minimum of 4,000 psi, unless specified
 otherwise in the Plans. Verify the release strength by compressive strength cylinder tests or other
 approved means, no later than 24 hours after casting and every 24 hours thereafter until release
 strength is developed. In lieu of every 24 hour testing, the contractor is permitted to estimate the
 strength development of concrete by the maturity method in accordance with ASTM C1074, the
 pulse velocity method in accordance with ASTM C597, or any other nondestructive test method
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 496
 
 acceptable to the Engineer, until the time of the detensioning. Before detensioning, verify the
 concrete release strength by testing the compressive strength test cylinders. Make a minimum of
 two compressive strength release test cylinders daily for each individual mix or for each LOT, or
 fraction thereof, of given concrete mix design where the daily consumption exceeds this volume
 or when non-continuous batching or dissimilar curing is used. The release strength test,
 representing the LOT, is the average compressive strength of two test cylinders, which are cured
 under conditions similar to the product or match-cured test specimens, which are match cured
 until the time of release. For products cured using accelerated curing, release the prestressing
 force immediately after terminating the accelerated curing process. After the detensioning
 operation is completed, continue to 72 hour curing period using one of the methods listed in 45010.6. For products cured using methods other than accelerated curing, release the prestressing
 force within a detensioning time limit, not to exceed five calendar days after the verification of
 release strength by compressive strength cylinder test or other approved strength gain monitoring
 system. For all products in a casting line, use the same test method for determining their release
 strengths. Ensure the detensioning time limit is included in the Producer QC Plan. Cure concrete
 cylinders used for detensioning strength tests in the same manner and location as the prestressed
 concrete products.
 For I-girders, where side forms are loosened upon setting of concrete or removed before
 the 72 hour curing period is complete, the top flange dormant strands may be released after the
 concrete reaches a compressive strength of 2,000 psi.
 450-11.2 Method of Stress Transfer: In all detensioning operations, keep the
 prestressing forces nearly symmetrical about the vertical axis of the product and apply them in a
 manner that will minimize sudden shock or loading. Remove or loosen forms, ties, inserts, or
 other devices that would restrict longitudinal movement of the products along the bed. Release
 hold-downs for products with draped strands in a sequence as shown in the Plans or Producer QC
 Plan. Cut dormant strands (partially tensioned strands) in top of beams before releasing any fully
 tensioned strands. Release fully bonded strands next, beginning with the lowest row and moving
 upwards, followed progressively by strands having the minimum length of tubular sheathing
 through to those strands having the maximum length of tubular sheathing. The Contractor may
 propose alternative detensioning patterns to suit the plant’s particular operation. Specify the
 method of the stress transfer to be used either in the Producer QC Plan or the construction
 submittal.
 Transfer prestressing forces to the concrete by either single strand release or
 multiple strand release.
 450-11.3 Single Strand Detensioning: Detension the strand by using a low-oxygen
 flame in accordance with a pattern and schedule provided in the approved shop drawings, or
 Producer QC Plan, or described in 450-5. Heat with a low-oxygen flame played along the strand
 for a minimum of 5 inches. Heat strands in such a manner that the failure of the first wire in each
 strand will occur after the torch has been applied for a minimum of five seconds. Release strands
 in all prestressed products simultaneously and symmetrically about the vertical axis at both ends
 of the bed and at all intermediate points between products to minimize sliding of products. As an
 alternate, strands in piles, sheet piles, slabs and AASHTO Type II girders may be released
 simultaneously and symmetrically about the vertical axis at both ends of the bed until all the
 strands are released, then proceeding in order to intermediate points nearest the bed ends, or to
 the single remaining point at the center and release strands at these points in the same manner
 until all strands are released. For CFRP strands coupled with steel strands, detension the steel
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 497
 
 strands first using the flame cutting process described above. At intermediate locations where
 CFRP strands are continuous between adjacent precast components, flame or shear cutting of the
 strands is not allowed.
 450-11.4 Multiple Strand Detensioning: In this method, detension all strands
 simultaneously by hydraulic dejacking. The total force is taken from the header by the jack, then
 released gradually. Do not allow the overstress required to loosen the anchoring devices at the
 header to exceed the force in the strand by 5%. After detensioning, strands at all points may be
 cut progressively from one end of the bed to the other using equipment and methods described
 above.
 450-11.5 Cutting Strands and Bars: Upon completion of the detensioning operation,
 cut steel strands to required length, using an oxygen flame or mechanical cutting device. Do not
 use electric arc welders to cut bars or steel strands. Upon completion of the detensioning
 operation, cut CFRP strands to the required length using a mechanical cutting device. Do not use
 flame or shear cutting to cut CFRP strands.
 450-11.5.1 Beams: For beam ends that will be permanently encased in concrete
 diaphragms, cut strands to 2.5 inches plus or minus 0.5 inch beyond the end of the product or as
 specified in the Plans. For beams with ends that will not be encased in permanent concrete
 diaphragms, mechanically cut strands a minimum of 1/8 inch below the concrete surface.
 450-11.5.2 Piles: Mechanically cut strands flush with the concrete surface. For
 top (head) of fender piles and pile ends not embedded under final conditions, burn the strands a
 minimum of 1 inch below the concrete surface and clearly mark the pile to identify the top
 (head) end.
 450-11.5.3 Poles: Mechanically cut strands to a minimum of 1/8 inch below the
 concrete surface.
 450-11.6 Protecting Ends of Strands: Prepare the concrete surfaces and apply Type F-1
 epoxy in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 450-11.6.1 Beams: For beam ends that will not be permanently encased in
 concrete diaphragms, apply two layers of epoxy to the exposed beam ends (including clipped and
 chamfered surfaces) within seven calendar days of detensioning and prior to development of any
 corrosion at the ends of strands. The finished thickness of the epoxy coating must be a minimum
 of 1/16 inch and form a vertical flat plane without deviations or localized depressions from
 recessed strands or other defects.
 450-11.6.2 Piles: Apply epoxy patches to all recessed strands.
 450-11.6.3 Poles: Coat entire face of tip (top) and butt (bottom) ends with epoxy.
 450-12 Noncomplying Prestressed Products.
 450-12.1 General: When a precast prestressed concrete product does not comply with
 the requirements of this Section or is damaged, use the following provisions for evaluating and
 disposing of deficiencies. However, when precast prestressed concrete products have been
 installed, the disposition of concrete cracks shall be in accordance with 400-21. Apply these
 provisions in all cases that clearly fall under the circumstances described. Consider situations not
 covered by these specific circumstances on their individual merits. Consider and apply the
 following where practical.
 The QC Manager, or QC inspectors under direction of the QC Manager, will
 examine all deficiencies within the time limit specified in 450-2.1 and 450-2.3, to determine the
 applicable provisions and requirements of this Article and which course of action is appropriate.
 If the QC Manager determines that a deficiency is a cosmetic or minor defect, appropriate repairs

 may be executed immediately in accordance with 450-13. Perform and complete cosmetic and
 minor defect repairs to the satisfaction of the QC Manager. If the QC Manager determines that a
 deficiency is a major deficiency, requiring an engineering evaluation, submit a repair proposal to
 the Engineer in accordance with 450-14. Make all repairs that require a repair proposal under the
 observation of and to the satisfaction of the QC Manager.
 The disposition of deficiencies and repair methods provided herein must at no
 time, and under no circumstances, be used as an excuse for or applied in such a manner so as to
 relieve the Contractor of his responsibility for QC. The number and type of deficiencies
 evaluated under this Specification will, however, be used in evaluating the Contractor’s QC.
 The Engineer will require a credit on any product with deficiencies that require
 engineering evaluation and are attributable to the Contractor, accepted for use in the structure.
 Bear the costs of repairs and any actions taken to rectify deficiencies at no expense to the
 Department.
 450-12.2 Surface Deficiencies: Surface deficiencies are defined below. Regardless of the
 types of deficiencies, when the total surface area of all deficiencies within a single product
 exceeds 2.0 % of the product’s length times its depth, the product will require engineering
 evaluation and disposition in accordance with 450-14. Surface deficiencies include spalls, chips,
 bug holes, surface porosities, and honeycombs.
 450-12.2.1 Bug Hole: A bug hole is a void caused by air that is entrapped against
 the form and that has an area up to 3.0 square inches and a depth up to 1.5 inches. Treat any bug
 hole with a dimension exceeding either of these dimensions as a honeycomb. The Engineer will
 not require the Contractor to repair any bug hole with a depth less than 0.25 inch and less than
 0.75 inch in diameter, unless otherwise indicated in the Plans or Specifications. Consider all
 other bug holes cosmetic and repair them in accordance with 450-13.2.
 450-12.2.2 Spall: A spall is a depression resulting when a fragment is detached
 from a larger mass by impact, action of weather, by pressure or by expansion within the larger
 mass.
 A cosmetic spall is a circular or oval depression not greater than 1.0 inch
 in depth nor greater than 3.0 square inches in area, and must be repaired in accordance with
 450-13.2.
 With the exception of spalls in the bearing areas and edge of the top
 flange, a minor spall is defined as a spall not larger than 2.0 square feet and no deeper than one
 inch plus the sum of the concrete cover and the diameter of the bar in the first layer of
 reinforcing. Repair minor spalls in accordance with 450-13.4.
 Spalls located at the edges of the top flange are considered minor spalls as
 follows:
 1. A spall on one edge of the top flange, without a coincident spall
 on the other edge of the top flange, is considered a minor spall if the total longitudinal length of
 the defect does not exceed 10 feet and any lateral dimensions of the spall measured
 perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the beam are not greater than 25% of the width of the
 top flange.
 2. Coincident spalls on opposite edges of the top flange are
 considered minor spalls if the total length of the defects within both spalls does not exceed 10
 feet and any lateral dimensions of the spalls at a given location measured perpendicular to the
 longitudinal axis of the beam are not greater than 25% of the width of the top flange.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 499
 
 Spalls located in the bearing area that extend back into the concrete within
 the limits above the bearing plate are considered major spalls.
 A major spall is a spall that any of its dimensions exceeds the dimensions
 that are described for minor spalls. A major spall requires engineering evaluation and disposition
 in accordance with 450-14.
 450-12.2.3 Chip: A chip is the local breaking of the corners or edges of the
 concrete with the resulting void containing angular surfaces.
 Cosmetic chips are chips where the sum of the two lateral dimensions
 perpendicular to the length does not exceed 2.0 inches. Regardless of length, it is not necessary
 to repair cosmetic chips except for visually exposed reinforcing steel, prestressing strand, insert,
 or weldments surfaces, which may require repair in accordance with 450-13.5.
 Minor chips are chips where the sum of the two lateral dimensions
 perpendicular to the length exceeds 2.0 inches, but does not exceed 4.0 inches, and with a length
 of no more than 12.0 inches. Repair minor chips in accordance with 450-13.5.
 Major chips are any chips larger than minor chips. Major chips require
 engineering evaluation and disposition in accordance with 450-14.
 450-12.2.4 Surface Porosity: Surface porosity is considered a minor defect and is
 the localized porosity of a formed surface due to medium scaling. Medium scaling is defined as
 the loss of surface mortar up to 3/8 inch in depth and exposure of concrete aggregate. Repair
 surface porosity in accordance with 450-13.3.
 450-12.2.5 Honeycombing: Honeycombing is voids in the concrete, loss of fines
 or other material from between the aggregate particles, the inclusion of air pockets between
 aggregate particles, or larger volumes of lost material. Remove honeycombing in its entirety to
 sound concrete before establishing the classification of the defect.
 Minor honeycombing is a void no deeper than concrete cover and no
 larger than 2.0 square feet in area that results after the removal of unsound material. Repair
 minor honeycombing in accordance with 450-13.6.
 Major honeycombing is a void deeper than concrete cover regardless of
 the surface area, or shallower but with a surface area greater than 2.0 square feet that results after
 the removal of unsound material. Major honeycombing requires engineering evaluation and
 disposition in accordance with 450-14.
 450-12.3 Formed Surface Misshaping: Formed surface misshaping is the visual and
 measurable deficiency or excess of material from the specified tolerance on any surface of a
 product.
 450-12.3.1 Pile Ends: Make square pile ends which are outside this Section’s
 tolerances by grinding in accordance with 450-13.7, or any other means of removal as approved
 by the Engineer. Reshape the chamfer if more than 0.25 inch from the cast pile end is removed
 and such removal affects the chamfer dimension.
 450-12.3.2 Pile Chamfers: Reshape chamfers outside of this Section’s tolerances
 to within the tolerances in accordance with 450-13.7.
 450-12.3.3 Other Surfaces: Any deficiency exceeding the plan dimensions for
 size, length, squareness, designated skew, plumbness, and the like by up to twice the specified
 plus (+) tolerance may be corrected by grinding to within the allowable tolerance in accordance
 with 450-13.7. Any deficiency exceeding the specified minus (-) tolerance or twice the specified
 plus (+) tolerance requires an engineering evaluation and disposition in accordance with 450-14.

 450-12.4 Bearing Areas: Consider the bearing area to extend from the end of the product
 to 3 inches beyond the edge of the bearing contact area for the full product width.
 Do not allow the bearing plate or bearing area plane of precast prestressed
 concrete beam and slab units to deviate from a true plane by more than 1/8 inch when tested in
 all directions with a steel straightedge. In the event that a 100% true plane is not achieved, the
 Engineer will accept a surface having not less than 80% of its area in a true plane provided the
 deviations are evenly distributed. Remove minor convex projections by grinding with an
 abrasive stone. The Engineer will accept minor depressions, provided that they amount to not
 more than 20% of the bearing area, are evenly distributed over the entire bearing area, and are
 not deeper than 1/8 inch.
 450-12.5 Cracks: A crack is the separation of a product or portion thereof which may
 appear before or after detensioning and may or may not cause separation throughout the product
 thickness or depth. Identify cracks by the classifications and locations described below and
 subject them to the disposition required by the identified crack. If the total surface length of all
 cracks within a single product, regardless of width, located between the end zones exceeds onequarter of the product’s length, an engineering evaluation and disposition in accordance with
 450-14 is required. Establish crack sizes subsequent to release of all pretensioning forces.
 The Engineer will reject any pile that is cracked to the point that a transverse or
 longitudinal crack extends through the pile, shows failure of the concrete as indicated by spalling
 of concrete on the main body of the pile adjacent to the crack, or which in the opinion of the
 Engineer will not withstand driving stresses. Occasional hairline surface cracking caused by
 shrinkage or tensile stress in the concrete from handling will not be cause for rejection.
 450-12.5.1 Classification and Treatment of Cracks: Regardless of cause and
 for the purposes of Section 450, cracks in precast prestressed components, excluding piling, will
 be identified according to their surface appearance in accordance with the following
 classifications:
 Cosmetic cracks are any cracks which are less than 0.006 inch wide and
 are located in non-critical locations on the product. Based on the environmental classification of
 the site where the product will be located, treat cosmetic cracks as follows:
 1. Slightly or moderately aggressive environment: Do not treat
 cracks.
 2. Extremely aggressive environment: After detensioning, apply
 penetrant sealer in accordance with Section 413.
 Minor cracks are any cracks which are between 0.006 and 0.012 inch
 wide, inclusive, and are located in non-critical locations on products. Based on the environmental
 classification of the site where the product will be located and the final elevation of the product
 on the site, treat minor cracks as follows:
 1. Slightly aggressive environment: Do not treat the cracks.
 2. Moderately aggressive environment:
 a. For products that will be located at an elevation of more
 than 12 feet above the existing ground level or above mean high water elevation: Do not treat
 cracks.
 b. For products that will be located at an elevation within
 12 feet above the existing ground level or above mean high water elevation: Apply a penetrant
 sealer on the cracks after detensioning in accordance with Section 413.
 3. Extremely aggressive environment:
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 501
 
 a. For products that will be located at an elevation of more
 than 12 feet above the existing ground level or above mean high water elevation: Apply a
 penetrant sealer on the cracks after detensioning in accordance with Section 413.
 b. For products that will be located at an elevation within
 12 feet above the existing ground level or above mean high water elevation: Inject epoxy into the
 cracks after detensioning in accordance with Section 411.
 Major cracks are any cracks of any width which are located in critical
 locations on products or cracks in non-critical locations of the product that are greater than
 0.012 inch wide. Major cracks require an engineering evaluation, including crack depth
 measurement and disposition, in accordance with 450-14.
 Cracks in the Riding Surface: Repair cracks in the top surface of
 components which will become the riding surface (with no overlays), once in service, regardless
 of the environmental classification as follows:
 1. Epoxy inject cracks wider than 0.006 inch in accordance with
 Section 411, unless the Engineer approves the sealing of cracks with high molecular weight
 methacrylate in accordance with Section 413.
 2. Seal cracks that are 0.006 inch wide or less by applying a
 penetrant sealer in accordance with Section 413.
 450-12.5.2 Locations of Cracks: Regardless of cause and for the purposes of this
 Specification, cracks will be identified as occurring in either critical or non-critical locations of
 the product in accordance with the following criteria and conditions:
 Critical locations of cracks are any locations in which a crack would tend
 to open under stresses occurring at any time during the service life of the structure, or which may
 reduce the ultimate capacity or fatigue life of the product. Specifically, critical locations of
 cracks are any locations in a product not defined and not included in 450-12.5.3 as non-critical.
 Cracks in critical locations require engineering evaluation and disposition in accordance with
 450-14.
 Non-critical locations of cracks are defined by the position within a
 product’s length, the position within a product’s depth, and the orientation of the crack.
 450-12.5.3 Non-critical Locations of Cracks by Product Type:

 450- 13.8 Treatment of Cracks: Treat cracks in accordance with 450-12.5.
 450-14 Submittal of Proposal to Accept or Repair Deficiencies.
 450-14.1 General: When a product has deficiencies unacceptable to the Engineer, the
 Contractor may propose repairs. Deficiencies discovered in the casting yard must be repaired
 before shipment. Do not ship products, which require repairs, from the casting yard to the project
 site until such repairs are complete and the Engineer has determined the product to be acceptable.
 Deficiencies discovered at the project site may be repaired at the site, subject to the Engineer’s
 approval. All proposed repairs must be submitted for engineering evaluation and credit in
 accordance with 450-14.2, unless the specific repair methods have been submitted and approved.
 The plant may use the repair method that is previously approved in the Producer QC Plan,
 without submittal of the proposal for engineering evaluation or credit. The use of the previously
 approved repair method is only applicable to the same type of single deficiency that is exhibited
 in a product.
 450-14.2 Submittal of Repair Proposal:
 The repair proposal must be completed by the Contractor’s Engineer of Record
 and shall consist of the following:
 1. A cover letter prepared on the Contractor’s letterhead addressed to the
 Engineer describing the product.
 2. Information in a format acceptable to the Engineer describing the details
 of the non-compliance and the proposed repairs.
 3. An engineering evaluation: A structural performance and durability
 evaluation which explains why the performance and durability of the repaired deficient product
 is acceptable as compared to that of an undamaged comparable product. The evaluation must be
 supported by one or more of the following types of information:
 a. Written evidence of a previously approved comparable
 deficiency and its repair.
 b. Documented research that demonstrates the proposed repair to
 be effective.
 c. If applicable, engineering calculations providing support for
 recommendations.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 505
 
 4. A proposed credit to the Contract proportionate to the product’s
 deficiency. The credit is in addition to the cost for review and evaluation of the proposal.
 5. Any other supportive information, pictures and drawings. For cracked
 elements, show on a drawing the location, average width, depth, length, and termination points
 of each crack along the surfaces. Provide the distance from each termination point to a fixed
 reference point on the component, such as beam end or edge of flange. The description of the
 proposed repair and the structural and durability evaluation of the product must be prepared by
 or under the direct supervision of the Contractor’s Engineer of Record and must bear their
 signature and seal.
 If the proposal is accepted by the Engineer, all Department costs associated with
 review of the proposal, including the cost of any and all engineering evaluation and testing
 services required, will be deducted from payment to the Contractor, but not to exceed 15% of the
 product value based on unit bid prices.
 Include in the proposed credit consideration of the Department’s added costs
 which may include but are not necessarily limited to re-inspection, testing, reduced durability, or
 increased maintenance cost. The Engineer will review and evaluate the Contractor’s proposal
 and will notify the Contractor of its disposition. The Engineer’s review of the Contractor’s
 proposal does not amend or delete code requirements, unless such changes are specifically
 brought to the Engineer’s attention and accepted by the Engineer. The Engineer’s acceptance of
 a proposal does not relieve the Contractor of his responsibility to provide products that are
 structurally adequate to resist the loads specified in the Contract drawings and that maintain the
 intended aesthetic, durability and maintenance aspects of the product. The Engineer will not
 accept repaired products unless repairs are made as proposed or described, the resulting repairs
 are sound in all aspects, and the repairs are aesthetically acceptable. Replace a rejected product
 with a product meeting the requirements of the Contract Documents at no additional expense to
 the Department.
 450-15 Repairs Before Approval.
 If repairs to precast products are initiated in advance of the Engineer’s approval, the
 affected product will only be considered for acceptability and use when the following conditions
 have been satisfied:
 1. Before beginning the repairs, submit to the Engineer a repair proposal in
 accordance with the requirements of 450-14.
 2. All repair materials must meet the requirements of Section 930 and be
 selected from the APL or otherwise be subsequently evaluated, tested by the Contractor as
 required by the Department, and approved by the Department for the specific use made of the
 material.
 3. Repairs have been performed under the observation of the QC Manager.
 Accept responsibility for actions taken, and perform these actions at your own risk. It is
 intended that repairs be made only after the proposed methods have been accepted to ensure that
 the proposal will not be modified or rejected, and the work will be accepted if the repair proves
 to be adequate.
 450-16 Handling, Storage, Shipping and Erection.
 450-16.1 Handling: All products which are pretensioned may only be handled after
 transfer of the prestressing force. For products that are prestressed by a combination of
 pretensioning and post-tensioning do not handle before sufficient prestress has been applied to
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 506
 
 sustain all forces and bending moments due to handling. Exercise care in handling to prevent
 damage to products. Lift and move products so as to minimize stresses due to sudden changes in
 momentum. Calculate pick up and dunnage points. Pick up products only at points designated as
 pickup points as shown on the Contract Plans or shop drawings. Maintain all beams in an upright
 position at all times.
 Evaluate the temporary stresses and stability of beams during their handling. The
 temporary stresses induced into the products during handling must be within the acceptable
 stresses at release listed in the Department’s Structures Design Guidelines. Take appropriate
 action to increase the stability of products during handling when the factor of safety against
 lateral buckling instability is below 2.0. Include the expected fabrication tolerance for sweep in
 the analysis. The analysis procedure provided by the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute or
 similar procedures may be used for the stability evaluation.
 Verify lifting devices for capacity in lifting and handling products, taking into
 account various positions during handling. Keep multiple component lifting devices matched to
 avoid non-compatible use. When a product has multiple lifting devices, use lifting equipment
 capable of distributing the load at each device uniformly to maintain the stability of the product.
 When the lifting devices are grouped in multiples at one location, align them for equal lifting.
 Take appropriate steps to prevent the occurrence of cracking. When cracking
 occurs during handling and transportation, revise handling and transporting equipment and
 procedures as necessary to prevent cracking for subsequent products.
 450-16.2 Storage: Store precast prestressed beams, Double-T Beams and slab units on
 only two points of support located within 18 inches of the end of the product or as calculated.
 Support skewed beams, Double-T Beams or slab units within 18 inches of the end of the full
 product section or as calculated. Support other products on an adequate number of supports so as
 to keep stresses in the products within the allowable stresses at release listed in the Department's
 Structures Design Guidelines. Locate multiple supports (more than two) within 1/2 inch of a
 horizontal plane through the top surface of the supports. Adequately brace beams as necessary to
 maintain stability.
 All supports must be level and on adequate foundation material that will prevent
 shifting or differential settlement which may cause twisting or rotation of products. Immediately
 pick up products in storage that have rotated or twisted and adjust the supports to provide level
 and uniform support for the product.
 Support prestressed products that are stacked by dunnage placed across the full
 width of each bearing point and aligned vertically over lower supports. Do not use stored
 products as a storage area for either shorter or longer products or heavy equipment.
 Where feasible, base the selection of storage sites, storage conditions and
 orientation upon consideration of minimizing the thermal and time-dependent creep and
 shrinkage effects on the camber and/or sweep of the precast pretensioned products.
 Continuous application of water during the initial 72 hour moist curing period
 may be interrupted for a maximum of one hour to allow relocation of precast prestressed
 concrete elements within the manufacturing facility. Keep the moist burlap in place during
 relocation of the element.
 Measure and record the sweep and camber of beams monthly. Keep the
 measurement records on file for review at any time by the Engineer, and upon request, submit
 these measurements to the Engineer. If the camber exceeds by 1 inch the design camber shown
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 507
 
 in the Plans, take appropriate actions in accordance with 400-7.13.1 to accommodate the product
 in the structure.
 If the sweep exceeds the tolerance specified, take immediate measures to bring
 the sweep of the product back to within tolerance.
 Notify the Engineer immediately when the sweep or camber exceeds the specified
 tolerances. Special storage conditions for the purpose of removing excessive sweep will not be
 restricted by requirements of this Subarticle nor contained in 450-2.1. If the sweep of the product
 exceeds the tolerance specified and cannot be removed, the disposition of the product will be in
 accordance with 450-12.1 and 450-14.
 450-16.3 Shipping: Do not ship precast prestressed concrete products to the project site
 prior to the completion of the 72 hour curing period and attainment of the required 28-day
 strength. The contractor is permitted to verify the shipping strength test, before 28 days, by
 testing compressive strength cylinders that are cured under the conditions similar to the product
 or by testing temperature match cured cylinders. The use of maturity method, ASTM C1074,
 pulse velocity method in accordance with ASTM C597, or any other nondestructive test method
 acceptable to Engineer, is permitted to estimate the strength before its verification by test
 cylinders. The shipping strength test is the average compressive strength of two test cylinders.
 Do not ship products until accepted and stamped by the QC Manager or the inspectors under the
 direct observation of the QC Manager. At the beginning of each project, provide a notarized
 statement to the Engineer from a responsible company representative certifying that the plant
 will manufacture the products in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Contract
 Documents and Producer QC Plan. The QC Manager’s stamp on each product indicates
 certification that the product was fabricated in conformance with the Producer QC Plan, the
 Contract, and this Section. Ensure that each shipment of prestressed concrete products to the
 project site is accompanied with a signed or stamped delivery ticket providing the description
 and the list of the products.

 the retaining wall on one end and to the soil on the other end through a bulb of pressure injected
 portland cement concrete grout. Test each anchor by prestressing to the load indicated in the
 Contract Documents before locking off to the retaining wall.
 Select the prestressed soil anchor type and the installation method, and determine the
 bond length and anchor diameter. Assume responsibility for installing prestressed soil anchors
 that develop the load-carrying capacity indicated in the Plans in accordance with 451-7.
 Provide corrosion protection for permanent prestressed soil anchors. The Engineer will
 not require corrosion protection for temporary prestressed soil anchors. Protect anchor tendons
 from corrosion as shown in the Plans in accordance with 451-8.
 451-2 Definitions.
 1. Anchorage Devices: The anchor head wedges or nuts which grip the prestressing steel.
 2. Bearing Plate: The steel plate which distributes the prestressed soil anchor force to the
 structure.
 3. Bond Length: The length of the prestressed soil anchor which is bonded to the ground
 and transmits the tensile force to the soil or rock. For a compression prestressed soil anchor, the
 bond length will be different from the tendon bond length.
 4. Factored Design Load: The maximum anticipated load that will be applied to the
 prestressed soil anchor during its service life after completing stressing and testing. The factored
 design load includes appropriate load factors to ensure that the overall structure has adequate
 strength for its intended use.
 5. Fine-grained Soils: Soils with at least 50% of the material smaller than the No. 200
 sieve size.
 6. Tendon: The complete anchor assembly, excluding grout, consisting of anchorage and
 prestressing steel with sheathing and coating when required.
 7. Coupling: The means by which the prestressing force may be transmitted from one
 partial-length of prestressing tendon to another.
 8. Sheathing: Enclosure around the prestressing steel to avoid temporary or permanent
 bond between the prestressing steel and the surrounding grout or to provide corrosion protection.
 9. Coating: Material used to protect against corrosion or lubricate the prestressing steel.
 10. Anchor Grout: Portland cement grout that is injected into the anchor hole to provide
 anchorage at the bond length of the tendon.
 11. Proof Load: Temporary loading of an anchor to its factored design load for testing
 purposes.
 12. Transfer (Lock-Off) Load: Prestressing force in an anchor after proof loading
 immediately after the force has been transferred from the jack to the stressing anchorage.

 support the tendon in the drill hole, and position the tendon so a minimum of 0.5 inches of grout
 cover is provided over the tendon bond length. In addition, locate the upper centralizer a
 maximum of 5 feet from the top of the tendon bond length, and locate the lower centralizer a
 maximum of 12 inches from the bottom of the tendon bond length. The Engineer will not require
 centralizers on pressure injected tendons if the Contractor installs the anchor in coarse grained
 soils using grouting pressures greater than 150 psi. The Engineer will not require centralizers if
 the Contractor installs the anchors and grouts them through a hollow stem auger and maintains
 the hole full of stiff grout (slump less than 9 inches) during extraction of the auger.
 451-4.9 Corrosion Inhibiting Grease (include for temporary anchors only when
 shown in the Plans): For corrosion inhibiting grease, meet the requirements of Section 3.2.5 of
 the Post Tensioning Institute Specification for Unbonded Single Strand Tendons.

 Return to Table of Contents
 
 513
 
 451-4.12 Spacers: Use spacers to separate elements of a multi-element tendon and which
 permit grout to flow freely up the drill hole. Use spacers fabricated from plastic, steel, or material
 which is nondetrimental to the prestressing steel. Do not use wood. The Contractor may use a
 combination centralizer-spacer.
 451-4.13 Tendon Bond Length Encapsulations (include for temporary anchors only
 when shown in the Plans): When the Contract drawings require the tendon bond length to be
 encapsulated to provide additional corrosion protection, use encapsulation fabricated from one of

 AASHTO M252, with a minimum wall thickness of 30 mils
 2. Deformed steel tubing or pipes with a minimum wall thickness of 25 mils
 3. Corrugated, PVC tubes manufactured from rigid PVC compounds meeting the
 requirements of ASTM D1784, Class 13464-B.
 451-4.14 Trumpet (include for temporary anchors only when shown in the Plans):
 Use a trumpet to provide a transition from the anchorage to the unbonded length corrosion
 protection fabricated from a steel pipe or tube meeting the requirements of ASTM A53 for pipe
 or ASTM A500 for tubing. Use a trumpet that has a minimum wall thickness of 0.125 inches for
 diameters up to 4 inches and 0.20 inches for larger diameters.
 451-4.15 Water: Use potable water for mixing grout.
 451-4.16 Grout Tube: Use a grout tube fabricated from a high density polyethylene tube,
 or a PVC pipe, or a steel pipe with a 0.5 inches minimum inside diameter.
 451-5 Tendon Fabrication.
 Provide tendons that are either shop or field fabricated. Fabricate the tendon as shown on
 the approved shop drawings.
 Ensure that tendons are free of dirt, rust, or any other deleterious substance. Degrease the
 bond length.
 Handle and protect tendons, prior to installation, in a manner to avoid corrosion and
 physical damage. The Engineer will consider damage such as abrasion kinks, welds and weld
 splatters, cuts, and nicks which impair the proper performance of the tendon cause for rejection.
 Sheath tendons in the stressing length to prevent contact of the anchor tendon with the
 drill hole wall. The Contractor may use sheathing that consists of tubes surrounding individual
 tendon elements or a single tube surrounding the elements altogether.
 The Contractor may use sheathing material of either steel, plastic, or any other material
 nondetrimental to the high strength prestressing steel. The Contractor may use tape to prevent
 grout from entering under the sheath on individually sheathed elements.
 Select the type of tendon to be used. Unless otherwise shown in the Plans, size the tendon
 so the factored design load does not exceed 80% of the minimum specified ultimate tensile
 strength of the tendon. Increase the tendon size by the sacrificial steel thickness shown in the
 Plans. In addition, size the tendon so the maximum test load does not exceed 90% of the
 minimum yield strength of the tendon.
 Assume responsibility for determining the bond length necessary to develop the design
 load indicated in the Plans or the shop drawings. Use a minimum bond length of 10 feet in rock
 and 15 feet in soil. Ensure that the minimum tendon bond length is 10 feet.

 451-6 Installation.
 451-6.1 General:
 451-6.1.1 Drilling: Core drilling, rotary drilling, percussion drilling, auger
 drilling, or driven casing may be used. At the ground surface, locate the drill hole within
 12 inches of the location shown in the Plans or the approved shop drawings. Locate the drill hole
 so that the longitudinal axis of the drill hole and the longitudinal axis of the tendon are parallel.
 In particular, do not drill the prestressed soil anchor hole in a location that requires the tendon to
 be bent in order to connect the bearing plate to the supported structure. At the point of entry,
 install the prestressed soil anchor within plus or minus 3 degrees of the inclination from
 horizontal shown in the Plans or the approved shop drawings. At the point of entry, make the
 horizontal angle formed by the prestressed soil anchor and the structure to within plus or minus
 3 degrees of a line drawn perpendicular to the plane of the structure unless otherwise shown in
 the Plans or approved shop drawings. Do not allow the prestressed soil anchors to extend beyond
 the right-of-way or easement limits shown in the Plans.
 451-6.1.2 Tendon Insertion: Insert the tendon into the drill hole to the desired
 depth. When the tendon cannot be completely inserted, remove the tendon from the drill hole,
 and then clean or redrill the hole to permit insertion. Do not drive or force partially inserted
 tendons into the hole.
 451-6.1.3 Installation of Trumpet and Anchorage: When corrosion protection
 is required, extend that portion of the corrosion protection surrounding the unbonded length of
 the tendon, up beyond the bottom seal of the trumpet or 12 inches into the trumpet if no trumpet
 seal is provided. If the protection does not extend beyond the seal or sufficiently far enough into
 the trumpet, extend the corrosion protection, or lengthen the trumpet.
 When required, ensure that the corrosion protection surrounding the
 unbonded length of the tendon does not contact the bearing plate or the anchor head during
 testing and stressing. If the protection is too long, trim the corrosion protection to prevent
 contact.
 Place the bearing plate and anchor head so the axis of the tendon is
 perpendicular to the bearing plate within plus or minus 3 degrees and the axis of the tendon
 passes through the center of the bearing plate.
 If using grout protected tendons, electrically isolate the bearing plate,
 anchor head, and trumpet from the surrounding concrete, soldier pile, or any metallic element
 embedded in the structure.
 Completely fill the trumpet with corrosion inhibiting grease or grout.
 Trumpet grease may be placed any time during construction. Place trumpet grout after the
 prestressed soil anchor has been tested and stressed. Demonstrate to the Engineer that the
 procedures selected for placement of either grease or grout will produce a completely filled
 trumpet.
 For permanent soil anchors, cover all anchorages permanently exposed to
 the atmosphere with a corrosion inhibiting grease-filled or grout-filled cover. Demonstrate to the
 Engineer that the procedures selected for placement of either grease or grout will produce a
 completely filled cover. If the Plans require restressable anchorages, use corrosion inhibiting
 grease to fill the anchorage cover.
 451-6.2 Anchor Grouting: Provide grouting equipment that produces a grout free of
 lumps and undispersed cement. Use a positive displacement grout pump equipped with a
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 515
 
 pressure gauge to monitor grout pressures. Ensure that the pressure gauge is capable of
 measuring pressures of at least 150 psi or twice the actual grout pressures used, whichever is
 greater. Size the grouting equipment to enable the grout to be pumped in one continuous
 operation. Ensure that the mixer is capable of continuously agitating the grout.
 Inject the grout from the lowest point of the drill hole. Grout may be pumped
 through grout tubes, casing, hollow-stem-augers, or drill rods. The grout may be placed before or
 after insertion of the tendon. Record the quantity of the grout and the grout pressures. Control the
 grout pressures and grout takes to prevent excessive heave or fracturing.
 Except where indicated below, the grout may be placed above the top of the bond
 length at the same time as the bond length grout but may not be placed under pressure. Ensure
 that the grout at the top of the drill hole does not contact the back of the structure or the bottom
 of the trumpet.
 If the prestressed soil anchor is installed in a fine-grained soil using drill holes
 larger than 6 inches in diameter, place the grout above the top of the bond length after testing and
 stressing the prestressed soil anchor. The Engineer will allow the entire drill hole to be grouted at
 the same time if it can be demonstrated that the particular prestressed soil anchor system does not
 derive a significant portion of its load-carrying capacity from the soil above the bond length
 portion of the prestressed soil anchor.
 If using grout protected tendons for prestressed soil anchors anchored in rock, use
 pressure grouting techniques. For pressure grouting, seal the drill hole, and inject grout until a
 50 psi grout pressure (measured at the top of the drill hole) can be maintained on the grout for
 five minutes.
 Upon completion of grouting, the grout tube may remain in the hole, but it must
 be filled with grout.
 After grouting, do not load the tendon for at least three days.
 Record the following data concerning the grouting operation:
 1. Type of mixer
 2. Water/cement ratio
 3. Types of additives (if any)
 4. Grout pressure
 5. Type of cement
 6. Strength test samples (if any)
 7. Volume of first and second stage grout
 451-7 Prestressed Soil Anchor Testing and Stressing.
 451-7.1 General: Test each prestressed soil anchor. The Engineer will select the
 prestressed soil anchors to be performance tested and those to be creep tested, and at his
 discretion, may increase or decrease the number of tests.
 . Perform creep testing and performance testing at the beginning of the anchor
 installation, prior to installation of the remaining soil anchors, unless directed otherwise by the
 Engineer. In projects with multiple anchor row levels, the Engineer may request performance and
 creep testing at the beginning of the installation of soil anchors for subsequent levels. The
 purpose of these initial tests is to verify the Contractor’s installation procedures, the performance
 of the bond length, and the calibration of testing equipment.
 Perform creep testing as follows:
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 516
 
 1. as shown in the Plans
 2. on 5% of the prestressed soil anchors.
 Perform performance testing as follows:
 1. as shown in the Plans
 2. on 10% of the prestressed soil anchors or a minimum of three,
 whichever is greater.
 Perform proof tests on all prestressed soil anchors, not subjected to a performance
 test or a creep test. Record the results of each test on form 700-020-04 Soil Anchor Forms.
 Submit a separate form for each test. Submit the test results to the Engineer on a weekly basis
 within one week of testing. Do not apply a load greater than 10% of the factored design load to
 the prestressed soil anchor prior to testing. For the maximum test load, do not exceed 90% of the
 minimum yield strength of the tendon. Simultaneously apply the test load to the entire tendon.
 Do not perform stressing of single elements of multi-element tendons.
 Provide testing equipment that consists of:
 1. a dial gauge or vernier scale capable of measuring to 0.001 inch to
 measure the ground anchor movement. Use a movement-measuring device that has a minimum
 travel equal to the theoretical elastic elongation of the total anchor length at the maximum test
 load and that has adequate travel so the prestressed soil anchor movement can be measured
 without resetting the device.
 2. a hydraulic jack and pump to apply the test load. Use the jack, with a
 minimum ram travel of not less than the theoretical elastic elongation of the total anchor length at
 the maximum test load, and a calibrated pressure gauge, graduated in 100 psi increments or less,
 or calibrated load cell with readout box, to measure the applied load. Ensure that the jack and
 pressure gauge are calibrated by an independent firm as a unit, and that the calibration is
 performed within 60 calendar days of the date submitted.
 3. Provide an electrical resistance load cell and readout to be used when
 performing a creep test. Load cell may also be used in performance and proof tests, at the
 Contractor’s discretion. Ensure that the load cell is calibrated by an independent firm and that the
 calibration is performed within 60 calendar days of the date submitted. Obtain the Engineer’s
 approval of the calibration before testing commences.
 4. Keep a calibrated reference pressure gauge at the site in possession of
 the Engineer. Ensure that the reference gauge is calibrated with the test jack and pressure gauge.
 5. Place the reference pressure gauge in series with the pressure gauge
 during each performance test and creep test.
 6. Place the stressing equipment over the prestressed soil anchor tendon in
 such a manner that the jack, bearing plates, load cells and stressing anchorage are axially aligned
 with the tendon and the tendon is centered within the equipment.
 If, during the performance of any load test (proof, performance, or creep), the load
 determined by the load cell or the load determined by the reference gauge differs by more than
 10% from the load determined by the pressure gauge when the pressure gauge measures 80% of
 the Factored Design Load (0.80 DL), suspend the test, unload the anchor being tested, recalibrate
 the load cell, jack, pressure gauge, and reference pressure gauge, and repeat the test at no expense
 to the Department. Obtain the Engineer’s approval of the recalibration data prior to resuming
 testing.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 517
 
 If, at any time, a pressure gauge, reference pressure gauge, or load cell is repaired
 or replaced, obtain the Engineer’s written approval of calibration data of the repaired or the new
 measuring device (load cell or pressure gauge, or reference gauge) prior to resuming testing.
 Perform additional performance tests, at no expense to the Department, on the first two soil
 anchors using the repaired or new measuring device to verify the calibration of the equipment.
 451-7.2 Criteria for Performing a Performance Test and a Proof Test: Raise the load
 from one increment to another immediately after recording the prestressed soil anchor
 movement. Measure and record the prestressed soil anchor movement to the nearest 0.001 inch
 with respect to an independent fixed reference point at the alignment load and at each increment
 of load. Monitor the load with a pressure gauge or load cell. At load increments other than the
 maximum test load, hold the load just long enough to obtain the movement reading.
 Hold the maximum test load for at least 10 minutes. Pump the jack as necessary in
 order to maintain a constant load. Start the load-hold period as soon as the maximum test load is
 applied, and measure and record the prestressed soil anchor movement, with respect to an
 independent fixed reference, at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 minutes. If the prestressed soil anchor
 movement between 1 minute and 10 minutes exceeds 0.04 inches, hold the maximum test load
 for an additional 50 minutes. If extending the load-hold, record the prestressed soil anchor
 movements at 15 minutes, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 and 60 minutes.
 451-7.2.1 Performance Test: Perform the performance test by incrementally
 loading and unloading the prestressed soil anchor in accordance with the following schedule:

 loading and unloading the prestressed soil anchor in accordance with the performance test
 schedule given above. At the end of each loading cycle, hold the load constant for the
 observation period indicated in the creep test schedule below. Use the following times for
 reading and recording the prestressed soil anchor movement during each observation period: 1, 2,
 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 90, 100, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, and
 300 minutes as appropriate. Start each load-hold period as soon as applying the test load. Pump
 the jack as necessary in order to maintain a constant load.
 Plot the prestressed soil anchor movement and the residual movement measured
 in a creep test as described for the performance test above, and plot the creep movement for each
 load-hold as a function of the logarithm of time.

 451-7.4 Lock-Off: Upon satisfactory completion of all testing, reduce the load to the
 lock-off load, and transfer the load to the anchorage device. Use a lock-off load that is 80% of the
 prestressed soil anchor service load. The Contractor may completely unload the prestressed soil
 anchor prior to lock-off. After transferring the load and prior to removing the jack, take a lift-off
 reading. Use a lift-off reading that is within 10% of the specified lock-off load. If the load is not
 within 10% of the specified lock-off load, reset the anchorage, and take another lift-off reading.
 Repeat this process until obtaining the desired lock-off load.

 451-7.5 Cutting of Tendon Protrusions: After an anchor has been accepted by the
 Engineer, saw cut the portion of the anchor tendon extending beyond the anchorage. Take care
 not to damage the tendon or the tendon anchorage.
 451-7.6 Prestressed Soil Anchor Load Test Acceptance Criteria: The Engineer will
 accept a performance or proof-tested prestressed soil anchor with a 10 minute load hold if the:
 1. Prestressed soil anchor carries the maximum test load with less than 0.04 inches
 of movement between 1 minute and 10 minutes; and
 2. For performance tests, net movement at the maximum test load cycle
 (movement between alignment load after 0.90 DL and the final movement reading at 1.00 DL)
 exceeds 80% of the theoretical elastic elongation of the test stressing length. For proof tests, net
 movement at the maximum test load (movement between alignment load and the final movement
 reading at 1.00 DL) exceeds 80% of the theoretical elastic elongation of the test stressing length.
 The Engineer will accept a performance or proof-tested prestressed soil anchor
 with a 60 minute load hold if the:
 1. Prestressed soil anchor carries the maximum test load with a
 deformation rate that does not exceed 0.08 inches in the last log cycle of time; and
 2. For performance tests, net movement at the maximum test load cycle
 (movement between alignment load after 0.90 DL and the final movement reading at 1.00 DL)
 exceeds 80% of the theoretical elastic elongation of the test stressing length. For proof tests, net
 movement at the maximum test load (movement between alignment load and the final movement
 reading at 1.00 DL) exceeds 80% of the theoretical elastic elongation of the test stressing length.
 The Engineer will accept a creep tested prestressed soil anchor if the:
 1. Prestressed soil anchor carries the maximum test load with a creep rate
 that does not exceed 0.08 inches/log cycle of time; and
 2. Net movement at the maximum test load cycle (movement between
 alignment load after 0.90 DL and the final movement reading at 1.00 DL) exceeds 80% of the
 theoretical elastic elongation of the test stressing length.
 If the total movement of the prestressed soil anchors at the maximum test
 load does not exceed 80% of the theoretical elastic elongation of the test stressing length, replace
 the prestressed soil anchor at no cost to the Department.
 Stop the creep test as soon as the creep rate exceeds 0.08 inches/log cycle
 of time. Incorporate prestressed soil anchors which have a creep rate greater than 0.08 inches/log
 cycle of time in the finished work at a load equal to one-half its failure load. The failure load is
 the load carried by the prestressed soil anchor after the load has been allowed to stabilize for
 10 minutes without exceeding 0.04 inches of movement between 1 and 10 minutes.
 When a prestressed soil anchor does not satisfy the load test acceptance
 criteria, the Contractor may modify the design and/or the construction procedures. These
 modifications may include, but are not limited to, installing replacement prestressed soil anchors,
 reducing the factored design load by increasing the number of prestressed soil anchors,
 modifying the installation methods, increasing the bond length or changing the prestressed soil
 anchor type. Obtain the Engineer’s approval prior to making any modification which requires
 changes to the structure. Perform any modifications at no additional cost to the Department. The
 Department will not allow additional Contract Time for modifications. The Engineer will not
 allow retesting of the failed prestressed soil anchor except to determine the anchor failure load.

 451-8 Corrosion Protection (include for temporary anchors only when shown in the Plans).
 451-8.1 General: Protect prestressed soil anchors against corrosion using materials and
 procedures described herein. The following materials may be used independently or in various
 combinations:
 1. Portland cement grout
 2. Plastic pipe or tubing
 3. Steel pipe or tubing
 4. Greases specially compounded for post-tensioning
 5. Bitumens
 6. Heat shrinkable polyethylene tubing
 Use corrosion protection materials with properties that are not detrimental to the
 prestressing steel and that prevent the intrusion of corrosive environments. Use coating materials
 that also have the following properties:
 1. Free from cracks and not brittle or fluid over the entire anticipated range
 of temperature
 2. Chemically stable for the life of the tendon
 3. Nonreactive with the surrounding materials such as concrete, tendons,
 or sheathing
 4. Corrosion-inhibiting
 5. Impervious to moisture
 When acidic water can enter the bore hole during the period subsequent to the
 drilling and flushing operation and prior to tendon insertion and grouting, introduce chemical
 additives for neutralizing purposes. Maintain a minimum pH of 9.0 when the prestressing steel is
 in contact with this water. During prolonged periods, monitor the pH at regular intervals, and add
 additional neutralization as required. Concentrated sodium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide
 have proven effective for this purpose.
 451-8.2 Protection Systems:
 451-8.2.1 Bond Length:
 1. When the Plans require grout protected prestressed soil anchor tendons,
 meet the following requirements:
 a. Provide corrosion protection of the tendon bond length by the
 cement grout cover.
 b. Use spacers along the tendon bond length of multi-element
 tendons to separate each of the individual elements of the tendon so the prestressing steel will
 bond to the grout. Position spacers so their center to center spacing does not exceed 10 feet. In
 addition, locate the upper spacer a maximum of 5 feet from the top of the tendon bond length,
 and locate the lower spacer a maximum of 5 feet from the bottom of the tendon bond length.
 c. Use centralizers to ensure a minimum of 0.5 inches of grout
 cover over the tendon bond length. Position centralizers so their center to center spacing does not
 exceed 10 feet. In addition, locate the upper centralizer a maximum of 5 feet from the top of the
 tendon bond length, and locate the lower centralizer a maximum of 12 inches from the bottom of
 the tendon bond length.
 d. The Engineer will not require centralizers on pressure-injected
 prestressed soil anchor tendons if the prestressed soil anchor is installed in coarse-grained soils
 using grouting pressures greater than 150 psi.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 521
 
 e. The Engineer will not require centralizers on hollow-stemaugured prestressed soil anchor tendons if the prestressed soil anchor is grouted through the
 auger and the hole is maintained full of a stiff grout, (9 inches slump or less) during extraction of
 the auger.
 2. When the Plans require the tendon bond length to be encapsulated:
 a. Protect the tendon bond length portion of the tendon against
 corrosion by encapsulating the tendon in a grout-filled corrugated plastic or deformed steel tube.
 Grout the tendon inside the encapsulation prior to inserting the tendon in the drill hole or after
 the tendon has been placed in the drill hole. Mix expansive admixtures with the encapsulation
 grout if the tendon is grouted inside the encapsulation prior to inserting it in the drill hole.
 Centralize the tendon within the tendon bond length encapsulation with a minimum of
 0.10 inches of grout cover. Use spacers along the tendon bond length of multi-element tendons to
 separate the elements of the tendon so the prestressing steel will bond to the encapsulation grout.
 b. Use centralizers to provide a minimum of 0.5 inches of grout
 cover over the tendon bond length encapsulation. Position centralizers so their center to center
 spacing does not exceed 10 feet. In addition, locate the upper centralizer a maximum of 5 feet
 from the top of the tendon bond length, and locate the lower centralizer a maximum of 12 inches
 from the bottom of the tendon bond length.
 c. The Engineer will not require centralizers on encapsulated,
 pressure-injected prestressed soil anchor tendons if the prestressed soil anchor is installed in
 coarse-grained soils using grouting pressures greater than 150 psi.
 d. The Engineer will not require centralizers on encapsulated,
 hollow-stem-augured prestressed soil anchor tendons if the prestressed soil anchor is grouted
 through the auger and the hole is maintained full of a stiff grout (9 inches slump or less) during
 extraction of the auger.
 451-8.2.2 Unbonded Length: For the minimum unbonded length of the tendon,
 use 15 feet or as indicated in the Plans or the approved shop drawings, whichever is greater.
 If grouting the entire drill hole (tendon bond length and unbonded length)
 in one operation, provide the corrosion protection of the unbonded length by a sheath completely
 filled with corrosion inhibiting grease or grout, or a heat shrinkable tube internally coated with an
 elastic adhesive. If using grease under the sheath, make provisions to prevent the grease from
 escaping at the ends of the sheath. With grease, completely coat the tendon, fill the void between
 the tendon and the sheath, and fill the interstices between the wires of the 7-wire strands. Ensure
 that the shop drawings show how to provide a transition between the bond length and the
 unbonded length corrosion protection. If the sheath is grout filled, provide a separate
 bondbreaker that prevents the tendon from bonding to the grout surrounding the unbonded
 length.
 If providing grease-filled sheath corrosion protection and the drill hole
 above the bond length is grouted after locking off the prestressed soil anchor, grout the tendon
 inside a second sheath.
 451-8.2.3 Anchorage and Trumpet: Use non-restressable anchorage devices
 except where indicated in the Plans. Provide restressable anchorages on those prestressed soil
 anchors designated as restressable in the Plans. Ensure that the post-tensioning supplier provides
 a restressable anchorage compatible with the post-tensioning system provided along with written
 recommendations concerning the restressing of the tendons.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 522
 
 If using strand tendons, submit written recommendations from the posttensioning supplier for seating the wedges. Include with the recommendations the minimum load
 required to properly seat the wedges in the anchor head.
 Size the bearing plates so that:
 1. the bending stresses in the plate do not exceed the yield strength
 of the steel when applying a load equal to 95% of the minimum specified ultimate tensile
 strength of the tendon; and
 2. the average bearing stress on the concrete does not exceed that
 recommended in Section 3.1.7 of the Post Tensioning Institute Guide Specification for PostTensioning Materials.
 Weld the trumpet to the bearing plate. Provide a trumpet that has an inside
 diameter equal to or larger than the hole in the bearing plate. Ensure that the trumpet is long
 enough to accommodate movements of the structure during testing and stressing. For strand
 tendons with encapsulation over the unbonded length, provide a trumpet that is long enough to
 enable the tendon to make a transition from the diameter of the tendon in the unbonded length to
 the diameter of the tendon at the anchor head without damaging the encapsulation. Ensure that
 trumpets filled with corrosion-inhibiting grease have a permanent Buna-N synthetic rubber or
 approved equal seal provided between the trumpet and the unbonded length corrosion protection.
 Ensure that trumpets filled with grout have a temporary seal provided between the trumpet and
 the unbonded length corrosion protection or that the trumpet overlaps the unbonded length
 corrosion protection by a minimum of 12 inches and fits tightly over the unbonded length
 corrosion protection.
 451-9 Submittals.

 The Engineer will approve or reject the shop drawings and design submission within
 30 working days after receipt of the submission.
 Submit to the Engineer for review and approval or rejection mill test reports for the
 prestressing steel and the bearing plate steel. The Engineer may require the Contractor to provide
 samples of any prestressed soil anchor material intended for use on the project. The Engineer will
 approve or reject the prestressing steel and bearing plate steel within five working days after
 receipt of the test reports. Do not incorporate the prestressing steel and bearing plates in the work
 without the Engineer’s approval.
 Submit to the Engineer for review and approval or rejection calibration data for each test
 jack, pressure gauge, and reference pressure gauge to be used. The Engineer will approve or
 reject the calibration data within five working days after receipt of the data. Do not commence
 testing until the Engineer has approved the jack, pressure gauge, and reference pressure gauge
 calibrations.
 Submit to the Engineer within 20 calendar days after completion of the prestressed soil
 anchor work a report containing:
 1. prestressing steel manufacturer’s mill test reports for the tendons incorporated
 in the installation
 2. grouting records indicating the cement type, quantity injected, and the grout
 pressures
 3. prestressed soil anchors test results and graphs.
 451-10 Tendon Storage and Handling.
 Handle and store tendons in a manner to avoid damage or corrosion. The Engineer will
 consider damage to the prestressing steel as a result of abrasions, cuts, nicks, welds and weld
 splatter cause for rejection. Protect the prestressing steel if performing welding in the vicinity. Do
 not ground welding leads to the prestressing steel. Protect prestressing steel from dirt, rust, or
 deleterious substances.
 The Engineer will allow a light coating of rust on the steel. If heavy corrosion or pitting is
 noted, the Engineer will reject the affected tendons.
 Use care in handling and storing the tendons at the site. Prior to inserting a tendon in the
 drill hole, examine the tendon for damage to the encapsulation and the sheathing. If, in the
 opinion of the Engineer, the encapsulation is damaged, repair the encapsulation in accordance
 with the tendon supplier’s recommendations. If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the smooth
 sheathing has been damaged, repair it with ultra high molecular weight polyethylene tape. Spiral
 wind the tape around the tendon to completely seal the damaged area at a pitch that ensures a
 double thickness at all points.

 SECTION 452
 PRECAST SEGMENTAL BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION
 452-1 Description.
 Fabricate, store, transport and erect precast structural concrete superstructure and/or
 substructure segments on a prepared foundation, to the established lines and grades, in
 accordance with the design, dimensions and details shown on the Plans and in accordance with
 this Section.
 Reinforcing steel, embedded items and all appurtenant items are included.
 Base the bid on the design shown in the Plans.
 The work in this Section does not include longitudinally post-tensioned beams upon
 which a concrete slab is cast-in-place.
 452-2 Qualification of Contractor’s Personnel.
 Meet the requirements of Section 105.
 When mixing, handling and applying an epoxy bonding agent, provide direct supervision
 by a person with knowledge and experience, or trained by a technical representative of the
 manufacturer in the use of this material. Arrange for a technical representative of the
 manufacturer to be at the site as an advisor at the beginning of this work.
 Ensure that all personnel who will be working with an epoxy bonding agent are
 thoroughly familiar with the safety precautions necessary for use of this material.
 452-3 Definitions.
 The following definitions apply to segmental bridge construction:
 452-3.1 Segment: A modular section of the superstructure and/or substructure
 consisting of a certain cross-section shape and length as detailed in the Plans.
 452-3.2 Match Cast: A precast concrete fabrication process whereby a segment
 is cast against the preceding segment producing a matching interface which permits the
 re-establishment of the cast geometry at erection time. Match casting is accomplished by either
 the short line or long line casting method.
 452-3.3 Short Line Casting: Casting segments one at a time in a casting cell
 between a bulkhead at one end and a previously cast segment at the other. The first segment is
 cast between the bulkhead and another, temporary bulkhead.
 452-3.4 Long Line Casting: Casting segments on a casting bed of sufficient
 length to permit the cumulative casting of segments for the entire length of a span or cantilever
 between field closure pours without repositioning the segments on the casting bed. With this
 method, the first segment is cast between bulkheads and successive segments are cast between a
 movable bulkhead on one end and the previously cast segment on the other.
 452-3.5 Casting Cell: A special formwork arrangement usually consisting of a
 fixed vertical bulkhead of the cross section shape at one end and adjustable soffit, side and core
 forms all designed and assembled into a machine for making a single superstructure segment. A
 casting cell for a substructure pier shaft segment consists of exterior and interior side forms and a
 soffit form of the cross section shape.
 452-3.6 Wet Joint System: Where segments are made in a casting cell between
 two bulkheads and are not match cast. The segments are then erected in the superstructure with a
 narrow cast-in-place joint between each segment. (During erection, all the segments of a span or
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 526
 
 multiple spans are supported by falsework, truss or other technique until the joints have gained
 strength and the longitudinal post-tensioning installed to make them self supporting.)
 452-3.7 Span By Span (Erection): Placing a specified number of segments on a
 temporary support system, aligned and post-tensioned longitudinally forming a completed span
 of the superstructure.
 452-3.8 Balanced Cantilever (Erection): The segments are sequentially erected
 alternately on either side of the pier in cantilever to a point where a closure is cast-in-place.
 452-3.9 Progressive Cantilever: (Erection): The segments are erected
 progressively in cantilever, in one direction, from one pier to the next, using temporary
 intermediate piers, or other systems as required to support the advancing cantilever between
 piers.
 452-3.10 Casting Curve: The curve of casting geometry that has to be followed
 in the casting cell or bed for achieving the theoretical bridge profile and alignment after all the
 final structural and time dependent (creep and shrinkage) deformations have taken place. The
 casting curve is a combination of the theoretical bridge geometrical profile grade, alignment and
 the camber.
 452-3.11 Camber: The amount by which the concrete profile at casting time must
 differ from the theoretical geometric profile grade to compensate for all structural dead load,
 post-tensioning, all long term and time dependent deformations (creep and shrinkage) including
 all the intermediate erection stages and effects. (The opposite of deflections).
 452-3.12 Erection Elevation: The elevation at which a segment is set in the
 structure at the time it is erected. (This is profile grade corrected by the amount of deflection
 calculated to occur from that stage onwards.)
 452-4 Shop Drawings, Calculations And Manuals.
 452-4.1 General: Use methods and procedures providing adequate safety to the general
 public from construction/erection activities and/or falsework placed over or adjacent to traveled
 roadways, navigational or recreational waterways or any existing commercial, industrial or other
 facility.
 452-4.2 Information Required: Submit detailed shop drawings, calculations, manuals

 452-5 Materials.
 452-5.1 General: Use materials which conform to this Section and the requirements
 prescribed in Division III, Materials, for the particular kind and type of material specified.
 452-5.2 Concrete: Use concrete as specified in Section 346 except as specifically
 modified herein. Use No. 67 coarse aggregate in the concrete for segments.
 Screenings are not allowed as a substitute for silica sand for use in concrete for
 Precast Superstructure Segments.
 452-5.3 Reinforcing Steel: Use ASTM A615, Grade 60 reinforcing steel which meets
 the requirements of Section 415. When welding reinforcing steel, meet the requirements of the
 American Welding Society’s Structural Welding Code D1.4. The Engineer may allow shop
 prepared welded reinforcing grillages. Field welding of reinforcing steel is not allowed.

 In its workable state, or open time, the epoxy bonding agent must function as a
 lubricant for joining the segments. In its hardened state, the epoxy bonding agent must provide a
 watertight seal between the precast concrete segments. The hardened epoxy bonding agent must
 provide intimate contact for stress transfer by completely filling all interstitial space between the
 match cast segment faces.
 Do not use resin or hardeners from containers which are damaged or have been
 previously opened. Combining of resin and hardener from bulk containers will not be permitted;
 use only pre-proportioned, full containers of components.
 Submit instructions, from the manufacturer, for the safe storage, handling,
 mixing, and application of the materials.
 452-6 Casting Requirements.
 452-6.1 General: Ensure that all materials, details, and procedures are as specified
 herein, as noted in the Plans, or as directed by the Engineer.
 Do not begin casting segments until the Engineer approves the relevant shop
 drawings, calculations, casting manuals, concrete forms and concreting operations and the posttensioning system components and layout if different from that on the Contract Plans. (Approval
 of post-tensioning stressing elongations and forces for field erection operations is not required at
 this stage but is required prior to erection.)
 To use wet joints to join cantilevers or for corrective measures, obtain the
 Engineer’s written approval.
 Give each segment an erection mark indicating its location, orientation and order
 in the erection sequence. Match mark abutting edges of adjacent segments. Show erection marks
 on the erection plans or in the erection manual.
 452-6.2 Forms: Take responsibility for the design and engineering of the forms as well
 as their construction. Form all exposed formed surfaces of each element of the structure with the
 same material to produce similar concrete surface textures, color, and appearance. Obtain the
 Engineer’s approval of forms prior to initiating casting operations. Build the details shown on the
 Contract Plans or as amended by approved shop drawings into the forms.
 Repair worn, damaged, or otherwise unacceptable forms and obtain the
 Engineer’s approval before casting any segment.
 Where sections of forms are joined, ensure that offsets in flat surfaces do not
 exceed 1/16 inches and that offsets with corners and bends do not exceed 1/8 inches.
 Ensure that all joints in the forms and contact points with bulkheads and existing
 segments have good fitting seals to prevent loss of fine material and cement grout.
 Check and inspect forms on a regular weekly basis to ensure proper alignment
 and geometric accuracy. Do not use forms which fail to meet the specified casting tolerances
 until such corrections are made to produce segments within the specified tolerances.
 Use a small blockout at all locations where an external tendon enters or exits the
 face of the concrete at deviation blocks and diaphragms except at anchorage locations. The
 blockout will be approximately 2 inches larger in diameter or overall dimensions than the tendon
 duct and have a depth equal to at least the minimum prescribed concrete cover dimension shown
 in the Plans.
 452-6.3 Casting Control (Geometry): Before commencing the casting operation, submit
 the proposed method of geometry control for all segment casting operations to the Engineer for
 approval. This submittal must be in the form of a “Casting Manual” and include but not
 necessarily be limited to:
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 529
 
 1. All measuring equipment, procedures and the location of control points to be
 established on each segment.
 2. The location and values of all permanent benchmarks and reference points in
 the precasting yard.
 3. A geometry control procedure for the vertical and horizontal alignment control
 for the precasting of segments; including survey controls and procedures, observations, checks,
 computational and/or graphical methods and correction techniques.
 4. The casting curves which include the theoretical geometric horizontal
 alignment, profile grade and superelevation appropriately combined with the camber.
 Ensure that the casting manual covers all geometry control operations
 necessary and is compatible with the chosen methods of casting and erection, including erection
 survey, elevation and alignment control. Prepare the manual in accordance with submittal
 requirements of this Section.
 Do not begin casting without the Engineer’s approval of the geometry
 control method.
 In the precasting yard, use instruments for the geometry control which are
 mounted on a permanent platform of sufficient height to sight on all control points. In addition,
 establish and maintain permanent benchmarks and reference points throughout the casting
 operations.
 During casting, make all corrections required in the geometry of the
 segments from the control points established on each segment.
 With a match cast system, after casting and before bond breaking to
 separate the segments, check the position of the new cast and match cast segments again. If
 positions are not as desired, make corrections in the next segment. In general, and unless
 otherwise approved by the Engineer, make observations on the geometry control reference
 hardware cast into the segments (i.e. elevation bolts, alignment offsets and lengths) to a precision
 of plus or minus 0.001 foot.
 During casting operations, produce and maintain on a daily basis a
 graphical plot of the vertical and horizontal “as cast” alignments along each vertical and
 horizontal control line to an exaggerated scale in order to clearly highlight variations. Depict
 these against both the theoretical geometric vertical and horizontal alignment casting curves on a
 continuous layout of an entire unit of the bridge between expansion joints. Maintain this plot in
 good condition so that it may be used and referenced during erection.
 Keep all geometry control hardware cast into any segments, such as
 elevation bolts and alignment hairpins, in place during erection for reference and checking
 purposes. Remove the hardware after completion of erection of the unit in the bridge between
 expansion joints.
 Use experienced personnel to operate the instruments and supervise the
 casting operation. Prior to the commencement of casting, obtain the Engineer’s approval of the
 experience and/or qualifications of the supervisory and instrument operating personnel,
 particularly with regard to the observational precision required.
 452-6.4 Preparation For Match Casting: When match casting is used, take great care in
 positioning of the match cast (previously cast) segment in relation to the segment to be cast.
 Ensure that the match cast segment is not twisted.
 Ensure that all materials to be embedded in the concrete of the new cast segment
 are properly positioned and supported in order to maintain their position and withstand concrete

 placement and consolidation without damage. Make provisions for all projections, recesses,
 notches, openings, blockouts and the like in accordance with the Plans and approved shop
 drawings.
 Cover the abutting surface of the match cast segment with a thin film of a bond
 breaker consisting of flax soap and talc, or other material approved by the Engineer. Use a soap
 and talc mixture consisting of five parts flax soap to one part talc. The Engineer will base
 acceptance of a material other than soap and talc prior to casting any segments by demonstration
 on a large specimen consisting of a precast piece and a new cast piece with a contact facial area
 of at least 4 square feet.
 452-6.5 Embedded Items:
 452-6.5.1 General: Embedded items must be in accordance with specifications
 for prestressed and post-tensioned construction and the requirements herein.
 452-6.5.2 Embedded Post-Tensioning Ducts: Ensure that embedded ducts for
 post-tensioning tendons and bars are positioned accurately to their required alignment. Properly
 fabricate and identify all ducts so that proper positioning is assured and can be verified after
 casting.
 Utilize positive methods to ensure that ducts will not be displaced or
 damaged during concrete placement and consolidation. Adequately secure all embedded posttensioning ducts to the reinforcement cage at intervals not exceeding 30 inches for steel pipes
 and 24 inches for plastic ducts, (Small ducts and very flexible ducts may require closer supports).
 Any auxiliary ties and support bars needed for these purposes will be considered incidental and
 at no extra cost to the project. Prevent the concrete cover requirements from being violated by
 any auxiliary ties and support bars.
 After installation in the forms, ensure that the ends of the ducts are sealed
 at all times to prevent entry of water, debris and fine material. Following each pour of concrete,
 demonstrate that all empty ducts are free of water and are unobstructed and undamaged.
 Immediately prior to installation of the prestressing steel, again
 demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Engineer that all ducts are unobstructed and free of water
 and debris.
 452-6.5.3 Anchorage Plates and Castings: Prior to placing concrete in the
 forms, fix all tendon anchorage plates and anchorage castings in their respective position in the
 forms, connected to their duct and sealed to prevent mortar intrusion. Ensure that anchorage
 plates and castings are rigidly fixed in the forms to maintain their correct alignment and position
 during concrete placement and consolidation.
 452-6.5.4 Reinforcing Steel: Fabricate and place reinforcing steel in accordance
 with the Contract Plans or as superseded by the approved shop drawings and as required herein.
 Do not cut out or remove reinforcing steel to permit proper alignment of
 post-tensioning ducts. Replace any bar that cannot be fabricated to clear the ducts by additional
 bars with adequate lap lengths and submit the details to the Engineer for approval.
 In the plane of the reinforcement parallel to the nearest surface of the
 concrete, ensure that bars do not vary from plan placement by more than 1 inch, nor by more
 than one-eighth of the spacing between bars, whichever is less. In the direction perpendicular to
 this plane of reinforcement, ensure that bars do not vary from plan placement by more than
 1/4 inches. The top and bottom cover of reinforcing steel must be within 1/4 inches of the cover
 dimensioned in the Plans. The edge cover of the reinforcing steel must be within 1 inch of the
 cover dimensioned in the Plans.

 452-6.6 Concrete Placement, Consolidation and Finishing:
 452-6.6.1 General: Do not deposit concrete into the forms until the entire set-up
 of the forms, reinforcement, ducts, anchorages and embedded items have been thoroughly
 inspected and checked. Do not place concrete until the Engineer is satisfied that all the above
 items have been properly inspected and checked, and the rate of producing and placing the
 concrete will be sufficient to complete the casting and finishing operations within the scheduled
 time, that experienced concrete finishers are available where required for finish work and that all
 necessary finishing tools and equipment are on hand at the site of the work and are in satisfactory
 condition for use.
 During conveying and placement, protect concrete against undue drying or
 rise in temperature and inclement weather.
 452-6.6.2 Concrete Placement Equipment: Use concrete placement equipment
 of a size and design which permits placing concrete within the specified time. Clean all
 equipment at the end of each operation or workday and, just prior to reuse, check the equipment
 again and clean off hardened concrete and foreign materials.
 Place concrete by belt conveyors and by pumping in accordance with
 400-7.6 and 400-7.7, respectively.
 452-6.6.3 Concrete Placement Sequence:
 1. Superstructure box segments: First place concrete in the central portion
 of the bottom slab between the inside edges of the internal web forms, leaving a narrow gap of
 6 inches to 12 inches for inspection and consolidation of the bottom corners when the next load
 is placed in the webs. Then place the concrete in the bottom corners of each web to connect and
 consolidate with that already placed in the bottom slab. Then place concrete in the remainder of
 the webs in lifts not exceeding 24 inches at a time up to the top of the webs but not into the slab
 over the webs. Place concrete in the top slab in the outer wing and mid slab regions between
 webs before placing, completing and consolidating zones over the top of the webs.
 2. Substructure and Pier Shaft Segments: Cast precast pier shaft segments
 vertically. Place the concrete in uniform lifts of approximately 24 inches to 36 inches and
 consolidate well.
 3. Obtain the Engineer’s approval on any alternative sequences to the
 above, or for any other precast components.
 452-6.6.4 Concrete Placement and Consolidation: Discharge individual loads
 of concrete into the forms, and place and consolidate in the required locations. After discharge
 into the forms, do not bodily move concrete from place to place within the forms by mechanical
 vibrators or other similar equipment.
 Place and consolidate concrete with care so that post-tensioning ducts,
 anchorages and any other embedded items are maintained in their proper positions and are not
 damaged.
 Consolidate all concrete using approved vibrators together with any other
 equipment necessary to perform the work as specified. Use internal vibrators having a minimum
 frequency of 8,000 vibrations per minute and sufficient amplitude to consolidate the concrete
 effectively. Provide at least two stand-by vibrators in working condition for emergency use in
 case of malfunction.
 Use of external vibrators for consolidating concrete when the concrete is
 inaccessible for adequate consolidation by internal means. When external vibration is used,
 construct the forms sufficiently rigid to resist displacement or damage.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 532
 
 Vibrate concrete in a manner which avoids displacement or damage to
 reinforcement, post-tensioning ducts, anchorages and other embedded items.
 No construction joints are allowed within a segment, except as detailed in
 the Plans.
 452-6.6.5 Finishing: Strike off the roadway surface of the segment with an
 approved mechanical screed operated by a self contained power source.
 Furnish and use a straightedge at least 24 inches longer than the segment
 while finishing the concrete deck surface of superstructure box girder segments. Use the
 straightedge approximately parallel to the centerline of the segment to strike an accurate surface
 between the bulkhead and the top of the match cast segment at all positions across the segment
 width.
 Give all other surfaces of segments and precast components a Class 3
 Finish at the precast site in accordance with 400-15.
 452-6.7 Curing:
 452-6.7.1 General: Where casting cells are intended to operate on a short (daily)
 cycle and it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Engineer that the required initial
 concrete strengths for the removal of the forms, application of prestress, moving and handling of
 the segments and that the final concrete strength can be achieved in a timely and consistent
 manner, then steam curing will not be required. However, take precautions to promote proper
 curing by methods approved by the Engineer and in accordance with Section 400. Such
 precautions must meet or exceed the following:
 1. To prevent moisture loss, cover all exposed surfaces (those not in
 contact with a form or match cast segment) as soon as possible after casting with a moisture tight
 covering (wet curing blankets or other approved equal systems). Avoid spoiling the deck surface
 finish. Keep the cover on or within 12 inches of the deck surface.
 2. Keep the moisture-tight covering substantially in place throughout
 succeeding operations such as geometry control survey, stripping of internal forms, wing forms
 and shifting of and working with a segment in a match cast position. Keep the concrete surface
 wet throughout these operations.
 3. After stripping of the side and core forms, continue curing of the precast
 concrete by the application of a Type 2 (white pigmented) membrane curing compound as
 specified in 925-2 to all exposed surfaces (including segment exterior once exposed by removal
 from the form). Apply an approved debonding compound to match cast surfaces to serve both as
 a bond breaker and seal for curing.
 4. Maintain the moisture tight covering for at least 72 hours.
 As an alternative, steam curing may be used.
 5. While the new cast segment is in contact with the match cast segment,
 cover the match cast segment with curing blankets, or other approved equal system, to minimize
 the effects of differential temperature between the segments.
 452-6.7.2 Steam Curing: Meet the requirements of Section 400 modified by the
 following requirements when steam curing is used.
 1. Provide a device or devices for simultaneously recording the
 temperature of three widely separated locations per casting cell. Locate the three temperature
 sensors near the top, middle and bottom of the enclosure or as otherwise approved by the
 Engineer. Identify the charts with the hours, dates and segment number and submit to the
 Engineer immediately after steam curing is completed unless otherwise approved.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 533
 
 2. Apply an approved debonding compound to match cast surfaces to
 serve both as a bond breaker and seal for curing.
 3. Expose match cast segments to the same curing environment
 (temperature and humidity) as the new cast segment until the new segment reaches the required
 strength to allow the removal of the forms.
 452-6.8 Removal of Forms: Prior to removing the forms, protect the plastic concrete
 from adverse weather effects.
 Keep supporting forms in place until the concrete has reached the required
 strength for form removal as specified in the Plans, in this Section, or as approved by the
 Engineer.
 Test cylinders, made and cured in the same manner as the segment, to confirm the
 form release strength prior to removing form. With the Engineer’s approval, a strength curve
 chart may be established to determine the time necessary for achieving the required form release
 strength, in accordance with the specifications for form removal.
 Avoid cracking or damaging the segment when removing the forms, especially
 match cast surfaces and shear keys. Notify the Engineer of any damage which occurs and repair
 in an approved manner.
 452-6.9 Test Samples: Provide additional test samples and testing for compressive
 strength on precast segments and field closure joints to control the construction activities and to
 ensure adequate strength of these components at various stages of their manufacture and
 assembly.
 Make test cylinders, in accordance with Section 346, cured in the same manner as
 the structural components to ensure adequate compressive strength has been achieved in
 accordance with the plan requirements for the following conditions:
 1. Prior to release of prestressing for components which are to be
 pretensioned.
 2. Prior to form release and/or moving the components to storage.
 3. Prior to post-tensioning transverse tendons if the component is less than
 28 days old.
 4. Prior to placing a component into position in the structure and/or
 stressing of longitudinal post-tensioning tendons if the component is less than 28 days old.
 Determine the number of cylinders in accordance with the proposed method for
 casting, transporting and erecting the various components.
 Submit the results of the compression testing of one or more test cylinders for
 controlling the time of execution of the various construction operations. Obtain the Engineer’s
 approval for meeting the Specification requirements on casting, curing and testing of concrete
 test cylinders.
 No direct payment will be made for the concrete testing. All costs for such testing
 will be included in the bid items for the various precast structural components.
 452-6.10 Age at Erection: Unless otherwise approved by the Engineer, precast
 components must be at least 14 days old prior to incorporating into the structure.
 452-6.11 Tolerances:
 452-6.11.1 General: The following tolerances apply to the fabrication of precast
 components:

 location)
 452-6.11.2 Corrections: Control dimensions from segment to segment, including
 cast-in-place segments, and compensate for any deviations within a single segment or series of
 segments so that the overall dimensions of the completed structure meet the dimensions and
 overall erection tolerances shown in the Plans and allowed by this Section.
 452-6.11.3 Repairs: Repair minor breakage, spalling, or honeycomb (not over
 1 inch deep) by a method approved by the Engineer. Major breakage, spalling, or honeycomb in
 excess of 1 inch deep is subject to the Engineer’s structural review. If found to be satisfactory,
 repair these areas using a method approved by the Engineer. Do not perform surface finishing or
 repairs on the matching joint surfaces of precast segments until after final erection of the
 segment, except as herein noted. If more than 20%, but less than 40% of the total contact surface
 of all shear keys in any single web is broken, spalled or honeycombed, grind the damaged areas
 to produce a cylindrical depression into sound concrete to a depth and width approximately equal
 to the shear key dimensions. Complete necessary repairs to shear keys damaged at the casting
 site prior to shipping the segment to the erection site. After erection of the segments adjacent to
 the damaged keys and prior to erection of additional segments, carefully pack the voids left by
 the depressions with an epoxy mortar as approved by the Engineer. With the Engineer’s
 approval, an alternate method of repair may be used. The Engineer will consider the segment
 unsatisfactory for use if more than 40% of the total contact surface of all shear keys in any single
 web is broken, spalled or honeycombed. Use an Engineer approved method for repairing
 damaged alignment keys located in the top and bottom slabs. The Engineer will consider a
 segment unsatisfactory for use if more than 50% of the total contact surface of all alignment keys
 in any element of the slab (wing overhang, central portion between webs, etc.) is broken, spalled
 or honeycombed. Remove and dispose segments found to be unsatisfactory and not repairable
 after structural review and cast a new segment at no expense to the Department.
 452-7 Precast Segment Handling, Storage and Shipment.
 Handle segments with care to prevent damage. Handle segments using only the devices
 shown on the shop drawings for this purpose. Store all precast segments level in the upright

 position. Firmly support all precast segments for storage and shipment on an approved three
 point bearing system which does not introduce a twist under self weight. Do not stack
 superstructure segments one upon another unless approved by the Engineer.
 Prior to shipment the Engineer will thoroughly inspect each segment for damage.
 Thoroughly clean the faces of all joints of laitance, bond breaking compound and any other
 foreign material by light sand blasting prior to shipment. Make no repairs of minor spalls or
 chipped areas on the joint surfaces until after erection of the segment. Upon arrival at the bridge
 site the Engineer will inspect each segment again. If in the Engineer’s opinion, any damage has
 occurred during shipment that will impair the function of the segment (structurally, aesthetically,
 etc.), the segment will be rejected. Replace any rejected segment with an approved segment at no
 cost to the Department. Provide firm support at bearing locations noted above. Fully secure the
 segments against shifting during transport. Provide a storage area of suitable stability for the
 segments to prevent differential settlement of the segment supports during the entire period of
 storage.
 452-8 Erection.
 452-8.1 Erection Manual: Before commencing erection operations, submit proposals for
 all segment erection operations to the Engineer for approval. This submittal must be in the form
 of an “Erection Manual” and include but not necessarily be limited to:
 1. A detailed step-by-step sequence for the erection of each segment including all
 intermediate procedures relating to erection equipment, temporary and permanent posttensioning and making of closures between spans and/or cantilevers and other required
 sequencing.
 2. Positioning, use and sequencing of falsework, jacking and/or releasing of
 falsework, temporary towers, supports, tie-downs, counterweights, closure devices and the like.
 3. Positioning, use and sequencing of erection equipment such as cranes, beam
 and winch devices, gantries, trusses and the like, both on and off the structure, including the
 movement, introduction and/or removal of any supports onto or connections with the structure.
 Include drawings and calculations for the structural effects of erection equipment on the
 structure.
 4. Detailed scheduling of all temporary and permanent post-tensioning operations
 and sequences in accordance with the segment erection and closure operations and other required
 scheduling.
 5. Stressing forces and elongations for post-tensioning.
 6. Sequencing of filler injection operations.
 7. A method for the field survey control for establishing and checking the erected
 geometry (elevations and alignments) with particular attention to the setting of critical segments
 such as, for example, pier segments for balanced cantilever erection. This information may be
 included in the Erection Manual or may be submitted later as a supplementary or separate
 document.
 8. Any other relevant operations as required and applicable to the structure type
 and construction method.
 Do not start erection without the Engineer’s approval of the erection manual.
 452-8.2 Erection Geometry Control:
 452-8.2.1 General: Numerical or graphical methods may be used for alignment
 control and checking during erection. Establish the key stages for checking of the erection in the
 erection manual and obtain the Engineer’s review and approval. Key stages would include, for

 example, setting a pier segment during cantilever erection and various intermediate points during
 subsequent segment erection, at span closure and upon completion.
 Prepare a table of elevations and alignments required at each key stage of
 erection in accordance with the Plans, as cast geometry, camber and erection elevations for
 establishing erection controls and submit to the Engineer for approval.
 Carefully check elevations and alignments at each stage of erection and
 correct as required to avoid any possible accumulation of errors.
 If geometric corrective measures are necessary, the Engineer will require
 the Specialty Engineer to develop the means and methods to ensure the epoxy joint remains
 watertight and free from localized stress concentrations. The Specialty Engineer will be required
 to submit the corrective measures to the Engineer for approval. Use shims made of ASTM A240
 Type 304 wire cloth (roving) with a maximum of 1/8 inch thickness.
 452-8.2.2 Span-by-Span and Wet Joint Erection: Position each span segment
 according to the final longitudinal alignment, grade, camber and cross-slope. Keep the horizontal
 and vertical alignment of the pier segment within 1/16 inches of that required by the approved
 erection plans.
 Correct any deviation more than the tolerance allowed above using a
 method approved by the Engineer.
 452-8.2.3 Balanced Cantilever and Progressive Cantilever Erection: Check
 the alignment and elevations of the cantilevers, using two independent surveys, within one hour
 of sunrise on each day that segments are to be erected. Check the measurements made by each
 survey and ensure they agree to within 1/4 inches. When measurements do not agree, discontinue
 erection of segments until discrepancies in measurements are resolved to the satisfaction of the
 Engineer.
 Accurate positioning of the pier segments is very important as it will
 establish the line and grade for cantilevers in each direction. Position each pier segment
 according to the final longitudinal alignment, grade and cross-slope and ensure no further
 erection continues until and unless these segments are properly located on the piers by the means
 provided. Keep the horizontal and vertical alignments of the pier segment within 1/16 inch of the
 alignment values required to control points as established by the approved erection plans.
 Check at each key stage of erection, in accordance with approved erection
 procedures, the ends of cantilevers for required elevations and alignment. Correct any deviation
 from the required alignment by a method approved by the Engineer.
 452-8.3 Erection Tolerances:
 1. Ensure that maximum differential between outside faces of adjacent segments
 in the erected position does not exceed 3/16 inches.
 2. Ensure that transversely, the angular deviation from the theoretical slope
 difference between two successive segment joints not exceed 0.001 rad.
 3. Ensure that longitudinally, the angular deviation from the theoretical slope
 change between two successive segments does not exceed 0.003 rad.
 4. Dimensions from segment to segment will compensate for any deviations
 within a single segment so that the overall dimensions of the completed structure meets the
 dimensions shown in the Plans such that the accumulated maximum error does not exceed
 1/1000 of the span length for either vertical profile and/or horizontal alignment.
 Carefully check elevations and alignments at each stage of erection and correct as
 required to avoid any possible accumulation of errors.

 452-8.4 Other Miscellaneous Erection Requirements:
 452-8.4.1 Span-by-Span and Wet Joint Erection:
 452-8 .4.1.1 Closure Joints: Use concrete meeting the same specifications
 and criteria as the concrete in the segments. Ensure that concrete reaches the minimum required
 strength as shown in the Plans or in the Specifications prior to stressing the continuity posttensioning. Ensure that the closure joint forms provide tolerances as specified under 452-6.11
 Tolerances.
 452-8.4.1.2 Wet Joints: Where forming joints between segments using
 cast-in-place concrete, the above conditions for closure joints also apply to wet joints. In
 addition, the cast-in-place “Wet Joints” cannot be less than 3 inches wide, nor greater than
 9 inches wide unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 452-8.4.1.3 Formwork: Adequately support formwork at all wet joints
 and closure joints to take all loads applied and do not remove them until the concrete in the joints
 has reached its required strength and the longitudinal tendons have been tensioned.
 452-8.4.2 Balanced Cantilever and Progressive Cantilever Erection:
 452-8.4.2.1 Deformations: For computing deformations due to time
 dependent stress variations, the erection time assumptions are shown in the Plans.
 Deformations due to creep and shrinkage and the concrete modulus
 of elasticity have been computed using the FDOT’s Structures Manual edition noted in the Plans.
 Obtain the Engineer’s approval for method of calculating the above parameters.
 452-8.4.2.2 Temperature Restrictions: Meet the requirements of
 Section 926 for substrate temperatures, epoxy formulation and thermal controls where precast
 segments are jointed with epoxy. Measure the substrate temperature at the mid-depth of the top
 slab for box girder sections or 4 inches from the top surface for slabs and other sections.
 452-8.4.2.3 Permissible Loads on Cantilever: During balanced
 cantilever erection, unbalance the cantilever by only one segment at any time. In addition to the
 unbalanced load due to one segment, the cantilevers are designed for loads applied by the
 erection equipment as listed in the Plans. Use alternate erection methods which comply with the
 assumptions in the Plans or otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 452-8.4.2.4 Span Closure Joints: Use concrete for closure joints which
 comply with the same specifications and criteria as the concrete in the segments. Ensure that
 concrete reaches the minimum required strength as shown in the Plans or in the Specifications
 prior to stressing the transverse or continuity post-tensioning. Ensure that the closure joint forms
 provide tolerances as specified for precast segments.
 452-8.4.2.5 Falsework and Formwork: Support falsework and formwork
 at closure pours by the cantilever ends or terminating segments of each series of segments to be
 joined. Secure cantilever together vertically, longitudinally, and transversely so that the applied
 loads will yield equal deflections to both cantilevers. Do not remove securing devices until the
 closure pour concrete has reached its required strength and longitudinal continuity tendons are
 tensioned. Submit calculations and details to verify that the devices and methods have adequate
 rigidity and do not impose excessive loads and stresses on the structure.
 452-8.4.3 Precast Box Pier Construction - Erection Tolerances:
 1. Ensure that maximum differential between outside faces of adjacent
 segments in the erected position does not exceed 3/16 inches.
 2. Ensure that the rotational angular deviation, measured about a vertical
 line, between two successive segment joints does not exceed 0.001 rad.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 538
 
 3. Ensure that the maximum angular deviation of a segment from a
 vertical line does not exceed 0.003 rad. and that the maximum overall deviation from the
 vertical, measured in any direction, does not exceed 0.01 inches per foot of height.
 4. Ensure the base precast segment is within 1/2 inch of the Plan location.
 452-8.5 Epoxy Jointing of Precast Segments:Furnish, mix and apply a two-component
 epoxy bonding system, meeting the requirements of this Section, to the match cast faces of joints
 between precast concrete superstructure and/or substructure segments in accordance with the
 Contract Documents
 Prior to the use of epoxy on the project, conduct a site meeting with the Engineer
 and epoxy manufacturer to determine the proper formulations, storage and handling, mixing and
 application of the epoxy.
 Have the necessary materials immediately available at the location of the segment
 joining, in the event that the segments must be separated and cleaned or epoxy reapplied.
 Include in the erection manual required by this Section, details of erection and
 post-tensioning operations which assure that the time elapsing between mixing components of
 the first batch of epoxy bonding agent applied to the joining surfaces of precast concrete
 segments and the application of a compressive contact pressure across the joint do not exceed
 70% of the open time for the particular formulation of epoxy bonding agent used. Also, include
 details of how the minimum, closing, contact pressure of approximately 40 psi will be applied
 uniformly to each joint to which epoxy is applied during the epoxy curing period. Contact
 pressure may be attained through combinations of weight and temporary and/or permanent posttensioning.
 452-8.5.1 Cleanliness of Surfaces to be Joined: Ensure that the application
 surfaces are free from oil, form release agent, laitance or any other deleterious material that
 would prevent the epoxy bonding agent from bonding to the concrete surface. Remove laitance
 by light sandblasting, wire brushing. Do not destroy the surface shape and profile of the mating
 surfaces.
 Ensure that the surfaces have no free moisture on them at the time the epoxy
 bonding agent is applied. Free moisture will be considered present if a dry rag, after being wiped
 over the surface, becomes damp.
 452-8.5.2 Substrate Temperatures and Epoxy Formulation: Apply the epoxy
 bonding agent only when the substrate temperature of both surfaces to be joined is between 40°F
 and 115°F. The formulation of the epoxy bonding agent must have an application temperature
 range that conforms to the substrate temperature of the surfaces being joined. If the mating
 surfaces have different substrate temperatures, then use the formulation for the higher
 temperature in hot weather periods. In cold weather periods, use the formulation for the lower
 temperature. Thermal control precautions may be taken in accordance with 452-8.5.5.
 452-8.5.3 Mixing of Epoxy Bonding Agent: Mix the two components of the
 epoxy bonding agent in strict accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, using only full
 and undamaged containers. Only open the containers immediately before being combined and do
 not use any which have an expired shelf life. Thoroughly stir each container of component before
 combining the components. Combine the two components and thoroughly mix until a uniform
 color is achieved. Mix with a properly sized mechanical mixer operating at no more than
 600 rpm or in accordance with the recommendations of the epoxy manufacturer.
 Do not mix until the segments to be joined are within approximately
 18 inches of their final position. Schedule mixing of the epoxy bonding agent so that the material
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 539
 
 in a batch is applied to the face of a joint within a maximum of 20 minutes after combining the
 components.
 The Engineer, at his discretion, may require a dry run to check the fit of
 two surfaces before applying the epoxy.
 452-8.5.4 Mating of Segments: Immediately after each mating surface is covered
 with epoxy bonding agent, bring the segments together and apply the specified compressive
 contact pressure in accordance with the approved erection procedures. The contact pressure may
 be increased at any time after the epoxy has taken an initial set. Do not reduce the contact
 pressure until the epoxy in the joint has properly hardened and cured. If the contact pressure is
 reduced, do not subject the joint to tensile stress.
 A discernable bead line of extruded epoxy bonding agent must be apparent
 along the exposed edges of the joint. Fill all areas of the joint which do not show a bead of epoxy
 by dispensing additional epoxy, meeting the requirements of this specification, into the joint
 using a pneumatic gun with epoxy cartridges. Inject epoxy to a minimum depth of 1 inch.
 Catch and retain epoxy which is squeezed out of the joint in areas over
 waterways, roadways, buildings, etc.
 Clean all extruded epoxy bonding agent from external visible surfaces in a
 way not to damage or stain the concrete surface. Do not smear surplus extruded epoxy bonding
 agent over large areas (areas more than 1 inch from each side of the joint), visible surfaces or
 surfaces to which a cover coat, Class 5 applied finish coat or similar or texturing is to be applied
 later.
 Immediately after the segments are joined, swab all embedded (internal)
 post-tensioning ducts or conduits passing through the joints to smooth out any extruded epoxy
 bonding agent.
 If the time between combining the components of the epoxy bonding
 agent and applying the compressive contact pressure exceeds 70% of the minimum open time,
 immediately separate the segments and clean in accordance with 452-8.5.6.
 452-8.5.5 Thermal Controls:
 452-8.5.5.1 Cooling in Hot Weather: If the substrate temperature
 exceeds 115°F, do not proceed with epoxy jointing. The Contractor may take precautions to keep
 the mating substrate surfaces cool by shading or wetting with clean water, except that the above
 requirements for no moisture at the time of application must be strictly adhered to.
 452-8.5.5.2 Artificial Heating in Cold Weather: If electing to erect
 segments in cold weather when the substrate temperature of the mating concrete surfaces is
 below 40°F, an artificial environment may be used to increase the substrate temperature subject
 to the following:
 1. Make the artificial environment by an enclosure surrounding the
 joint through which warm air is circulated, or heating is provided by radiant heaters.
 2. Raise the temperature of the concrete substrate across the entire
 joint surface to at least 40°F.
 3. Prevent localized heating and the temperature of the substrate
 exceeding 95°F at any point on the surface. Direct flame heating of the concrete is not allowed.
 4. Maintain the temperature of the substrate surfaces between 40°F
 and 95°F for at least 24 hours after joining the surfaces.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 540
 
 5. The Contractor may propose, for review by the Engineer, an
 optional method of raising and maintaining the substrate temperature of the mating surfaces. Any
 optional method must meet the thermal restrictions above.
 Epoxy jointing operations may proceed if the air temperature is
 above 45°F and rising and the limitations above are met.
 452-8.5.6 Failure to Comply with Time Limits or Incomplete Jointing: If the
 time limit between mixing of the epoxy-bonding agent and the application of the contact pressure
 is exceeded, or if the joint is incompletely filled and sealed, separate the segments and remove all
 epoxy from the faces using spatulas and approved solvent. Do not re-apply epoxy until the faces
 have been properly cleaned and solvents dispersed, for a period of 24 hours.
 452-8.5.7 Removal of Support to Segments:
 452-8.5.7.1 Span-by-Span Erection: Ensure that precast concrete
 segments remain fully supported by the erection truss or system until at least 20 hours after
 mixing of the last batch of epoxy bonding agent applied to any joint in the span.
 452-8.5.7.2 Cantilever Erection: Independent support to a newly erected
 cantilever segment may be removed when the epoxy bonding agent in the third previous mating
 joint has set. It is not necessary for the epoxy bonding agent in the new joint or the immediately
 previous joint to be set prior to removing the independent support of the new segment provided
 that the temporary and/or permanent post-tensioning has been installed to carry the load of the
 new and previous segment along with any applied construction loading as per the requirements
 of the erection system.
 452-8.5.8 Record of Jointing: Record and submit to the Engineer on a weekly
 basis the following information:
 1. General:
 a. Date and time of jointing,
 b. Segment numbers or spans jointed,
 c. Weather conditions
 2. For each joint (identified by location or segment numbers):
 a. manufacturer’s lot number of epoxy bonding agent components.
 b. Temperature of the concrete on the joint surface at the middle of
 each segment when application of the epoxy bonding agent began.
 c. Time of mixing first batch of epoxy bonding agent applied to the
 joint and completion of application.
 d. Time of applying the required compressive contact pressure.
 3. Details of any repairs performed including reason for repair, joint
 location, volume of epoxy used, method of application, etc.
 452-8.6 Packed Mortar Joints for Joints or Bearings: Where designated on the Plans,
 place packed mortar after the joint or bearing has been set at the proper final elevation.
 Pressure grouting may be allowed with the Engineer’s approval of the materials
 and method to be used.
 Mortar for packing consists of one part cement and one part fine aggregate, by
 volume, mixed with a non-shrink admixture as recommended by the manufacturer. Mix the dry
 elements thoroughly to a uniform mixture. Add water to produce a mealy, slightly adhesive
 mixture. Pack the mortar until a water sheen is produced on the surface of the mortar.
 Build a form around the joint leaving one side open. Secure the form to withstand
 the required packing forces. Insert a small amount of mortar into the open joint to form a

 2 inches thick bead on the opposite side of the form. Pack this bead by striking a special tool
 made of 1/2 inch by 2 inch steel having a length approximately 10 inches longer than the largest
 dimension of the joint being packed with a 2 pound hammer. Continue compaction until water
 begins to bleed out of the mortar. When bleeding has occurred, insert another bead of mortar and
 pack as described above. Continue this process until the joint is filled to the limits shown in the
 Plans.
 452-9 Traffic Railing and Median Setting.
 Prior to forming the concrete traffic railings, accurately establish the as-constructed gutter
 line elevations at intervals not exceeding 10 feet. Then form the base of the traffic railing and
 median to provide an inside vertical face which extends from the surface of the concrete
 structure to an elevation located 3 inches (or as shown in the Plans) above the theoretical gutter
 line elevations. Maintain the plan vertical height of the traffic railings as a minimum when
 variations exist between the plan profile and the actual profile of the gutter.
 452-10 Bridge Deck Surface.
 Provide a Class 4 Floor Finish in accordance with Section 400 for Long Bridges upon
 completion of superstructure segment erection and prior to opening to traffic. Install expansion
 joints in accordance with Section 400.
 452-11 Watertight Decks.
 Check all segment joints, closure joints and deck hole repairs to assure every location is
 watertight, upon completion of all milling and grinding activities on the riding surface. Repair all
 locations showing evidence of leaks by cutting a 3/8 inches wide x 5/8 inches deep groove along
 the leak interface. Clean and completely fill the groove with epoxy meeting the requirements of
 Section 926. Dispense the epoxy into the groove using a pneumatic gun and epoxy cartridges.
 Clean all excess epoxy bonding agent from external visible surfaces in a way not to damage or
 stain the concrete surface. Do not smear epoxy over areas located more than 1 inch from each
 side of the groove.
 452-12 Method of Measurement.
 Precast superstructure and substructure segment concrete, including cast-in-place
 concrete for closure and wet joint pours, will be measured by volume according to the quantities
 represented by the dimensions of the segments and cast-in-place pours on the Contract Plans or
 approved shop drawings; whichever is the lesser.
 All reinforcement in precast superstructure and substructure segments, cast-in-place
 closures and wet-joints will be measured by weight according to the quantities represented by the
 reinforcement details in the Plans or approved shop drawings; whichever is the lesser.
 All permanent post-tensioning in the superstructure and substructure will be measured by
 weight according to the quantities represented by the details in the Plans or approved shop

 A. GENERAL
 
 455-1 General.
 The Contractor may examine available soil samples and rock cores obtained during the
 soil boring operations at the appropriate District Materials Office.
 455-1.1 Monitor Existing Structures: Monitor existing structures in accordance with
 Section 108.
 455-1.2 Excavation: Complete all excavation of the foundations prior to installing piles
 or shafts unless otherwise authorized by the Engineer. After completing pile/shaft installation,
 remove all loose and displaced materials from around the piles/shafts, leaving a clean, solid
 surface. Compact the soil surface on which concrete is to be placed or which will support the
 forming system for the concrete to support the load of the plastic concrete without settling or
 causing the concrete to crack, or as shown in the Contract Documents.
 455-1.2.1 Abutment (End Bent) Fill: Place and compact the fill before installing
 end-bent piling/shafts, except when driving specified test piling in end bents or the Plans show
 uncased piles through proprietary retaining wall fills.
 When installing piles/shafts or casing prior to placing fill, take necessary
 precautions to prevent displacement of piles/shafts during placing and compacting fill materials
 within 15 feet of the piles/shafts or casing. Reference and check the position of the piles/shafts or
 casing at three approximately equal intervals during construction of the embankment.
 Place embankment material in 6 inch loose lifts in the 15 foot area around
 the piles/shafts or casing. Compact embankment material within the 15 foot area adjacent to the
 piles/shafts or casing to the required density with compaction equipment weighing less than
 1,000 pounds. When installing piles/shafts prior to the completion of the surrounding fills, do not
 cap them until placing the fills as near to final grade as possible, leaving only the necessary
 working room for construction of the caps.
 When shown in the Plans, provide permanent casings installed prior to
 placement of the fill, for all drilled shafts through mechanically stabilized fills (for example,
 behind proprietary retaining walls) for shafts installed after fill placement. Install temporary
 casings through the completed conventional fill when permanent casings are not required.
 Provide permanent casings, if required, before the fill is placed extending
 a sufficient distance into the existing ground to provide stability to the casings during
 construction of the abutment fill.

 545
 
 455-1.3 Cofferdams: Construct cofferdams as detailed in the Plans. When cofferdams
 are not detailed in the Plans, employ a qualified Specialty Engineer to design cofferdams, and to
 sign and seal the plans and specification requirements. Submit the designs to the Engineer for
 their records before beginning construction.
 Provide a qualified diver and a safety diver to inspect the conditions of the
 foundation enclosure or cofferdam when the Contract Documents require a seal for construction.
 Equip these divers with suitable voice communications, and have them inspect the foundation
 enclosure and cofferdam periphery including each sheeting indentation and around each piling or
 drilled shaft to ensure that no layers of mud or other undesirable materials were left above the
 bottom of seal elevation during the excavation process. Also have the divers check to make sure
 the surfaces of the piles or drilled shafts are sufficiently clean to allow bond of the concrete
 down to the minimum bottom of seal elevation. Ensure that there are no mounds of stone, shell,
 or unapproved backfill material left after placement and grading. Assist the Engineer as required
 to ensure that the seal is placed as specified and evaluate the adequacy of the foundation soils or
 rock. Correct any deficiencies found by the divers. Upon completion of inspection by the divers,
 the Department may also elect to inspect the work before authorizing the Contractor to proceed
 with subsequent construction operations. Submit a written report by the divers to the Engineer
 indicating the results of their underwater inspection before requesting authorization to place the
 seal concrete.
 455-1.4 Vibrations on Freshly Placed Concrete (Drilled Shafts and Piers): Ensure
 that freshly placed concrete is not subjected to peak particle velocities greater than 1.5 inches per
 second from vibration sources located within 30 feet (from the nearest outside edge of freshly
 placed concrete to the vibration source) until that concrete has attained its final set as defined by
 ASTM C403 except as required to remove temporary casings before the drilled shaft elapsed
 time has expired.
 455-2 Static Compression Load Tests.
 455-2.1 General: Employ a professional testing laboratory, or Specialty Engineer with
 prior load test experience on at least three projects, to conduct the load test in compliance with
 these Specifications, to record all data, and to submit reports of the test results to the Engineer
 except when the Contract Documents show that the Department will supply a Geotechnical
 Engineer to provide these services.
 Perform the load test by applying a load up to the load required in the Contract
 Documents or to the failure load, whichever occurs first.
 Do not apply test loads to piles sooner than 48 hours (or the time interval shown
 in the Plans) after driving of the test pile or reaction piles, whichever occurs last.
 Allow up to four weeks after the last load test for the analysis of the load test data
 and to provide all the estimated production tip elevations. If the Contractor is willing to construct
 production foundation elements in areas designated by the Engineer, tip elevations will be
 determined in these areas beginning seven days after the receipt of the load test data which
 represents the designated area.
 Do not begin static load testing of drilled shafts until the concrete has attained a
 compressive strength of 3,400 psi. The Contractor may use high early strength concrete to obtain
 this strength at an earlier time to prevent testing delays.
 Load test piles/shafts in the order directed by the Engineer. Unless shown
 otherwise in the Contract Documents, provide all equipment, materials, labor, and technical
 personnel required to conduct the load tests, including determination of anchor reaction member

 546
 
 depths. In this case, provide a loading apparatus designed to accommodate the maximum load
 plus an adequate safety factor.
 While performing the load test, provide safety equipment, and employ safety
 procedures consistent with the latest approved practices for this work. Include with these safety
 procedures, adequate support for the load test plates and jack to prevent them from falling in the
 event of a release of load due to hydraulic failure, test pile/shaft failure, or any other cause.
 Include in the bid the cost of transporting load test equipment and instrumentation
 supplied by the Department from their storage location to the job site and back. Handle these
 items with care. The Contractor is responsible for the safe return of these items. After completion
 of the static load tests, return all Department furnished equipment in satisfactory operating
 condition. Repair all damage to the test equipment furnished by the Department to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer. Clean all areas of rust on structural steel items, and recoat those
 areas in accordance with Section 560. Return all load test equipment supplied by the Department
 within 30 days after completing the load tests.
 The Contractor is responsible for the equipment from the time it leaves its storage
 area until the time it is returned. During this time, insure the equipment against loss or damage
 for the replacement cost thereof (the greater of $150,000 or the amount shown in the Plans) or
 for the full insurable value if replacement cost insurance is not available.
 Notify the Engineer at the preconstruction conference, or no later than 30 days
 before beginning test pile installation, of the proposed testing schedule so that items supplied by
 the Department may be reserved. Notify the Department at least ten working days before pick-up
 or return of the equipment. During pick-up, the Department will complete a checklist of all
 equipment placed in the Contractor’s possession. The Department will later use this checklist to
 verify that the Contractor has returned all equipment. Provide personnel and equipment to load
 or unload the equipment at the Department’s storage location. Provide lifting tongs or nylon
 slings to handle Department owned test girders. Do not perform cutting, welding, or drilling on
 Department owned girders, jacks, load cells, or other equipment.
 455-2.2 Loading Apparatus: Provide an apparatus for applying the vertical loads as
 described in one of the following:
 1. As shown and described in the Contract Documents.
 2. As supplied by the Contractor, one of the following devices designed to
 accommodate a load at least 20% higher than the test load shown in the Plans or described herein
 for test loads:
 a. Load Applied by Hydraulic Jack Acting Against Weighted Box or
 Platform: Construct a test box or test platform, resting on a suitable support, over the pile, and
 load it with material with a total weight greater than the anticipated maximum test load. Locate
 supports for the weighted box or platform at least 6 feet or three pile/shaft diameters, whichever
 is greater, measured from the edge of the pile or shaft to the edge of the supports. Insert a
 hydraulic jack with pressure gauge between the test pile or shaft and the underside of the reaction
 beam, and apply the load to the pile or shaft by operating the jack between the reaction beam and
 the top of the pile or shaft.
 b. Load Applied to the Test Pile or Shaft by Hydraulic Jack Acting
 Against Anchored Reaction Member: Construct reaction member anchorages in accordance with
 article 6.3 of ASTM D1143. Attach a girder(s) of sufficient strength to act as a reaction beam to
 the upper ends of the anchor piles or shafts. Insert a hydraulic jack with pressure gauges between
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 547
 
 the head of the test pile/shaft and the underside of the reaction beam, and apply the test load to
 the pile/shaft by operating the jack between the reaction beam and the pile/shaft head.
 If using drilled shafts with bells as reaction member anchorages,
 locate the top of the bell of any reaction shaft anchorage at least three shaft diameters below the
 bottom of the test shaft.
 c. Combination Devices: The Contractor may use a combination of
 devices (a) and (b), as described above, to apply the test load to the pile or shaft.
 d. Other systems proposed by the Contractor and approved by the
 Engineer: When necessary, provide horizontal supports for loading the pile/shaft, and space them
 so that the ratio of the unsupported length to the minimum radius of gyration of the pile does not
 exceed 120 for steel piles, and the unsupported length to the least cross-section dimension does
 not exceed 20 for concrete piles or drilled shafts. Ensure that horizontal supports provide full
 support without restraining the vertical movement of the pile in any way.
 When required by the Contract Documents, apply a horizontal load
 to the shaft either separately or in conjunction with the vertical load. Apply the load to the test
 shaft by hydraulic jacks, jacking against Contractor provided reaction devices. After receiving
 the Engineer’s approval of the proposed method of load application, apply the horizontal load in
 increments, and relieve it in decrements as required by the Contract Documents.
 455-2.2.1 Modified Quick Test:
 1. Loading Procedure: Apply vertical loads concentric with the
 longitudinal axis of the tested pile/shaft to accurately determine and control the load acting on
 the pile/shaft at any time. Place the load on the pile/shaft continuously, in increments equal to
 approximately 5% of the maximum test load specified until approaching the failure load, as
 indicated by the measuring apparatus and/or instruments. Then, apply increments of
 approximately 2.5% until the pile/shaft “plunges” or attains the limiting load. The Engineer may
 elect to stop the loading increments when he determines the Contractor has met the failure
 criteria or when a settlement equal to 10% of the pile/shaft width or diameter is reached. Apply
 each load increment immediately after taking and verifying the complete set of readings from all
 gauges and instruments. Apply each increment of load within the minimum length of time
 practical, and immediately take the readings. Complete the addition of a load increment and the
 completion of the readings within 5 to 15 minutes. The Engineer may elect to hold the maximum
 applied load up to one hour.
 Remove the load in decrements of about 10% of the maximum test
 load. Remove each decrement of load within the minimum length of time practical, and
 immediately take the readings. Complete the removal of a load decrement and the taking of the
 readings within 5 to 15 minutes. The Engineer may also require up to two reloading cycles with
 five loading increments and three unloading decrements. Record the final recovery of the
 pile/shaft until movement is essentially complete for a period up to one hour after the last unload
 interval.
 2. Failure Criteria and Nominal Resistance: Use the criteria described
 herein to establish the failure load. The failure load is defined as the load that causes a pile/shaft
 top deflection equal to the calculated elastic compression plus 0.15 inches plus 1/120 of the
 pile/shaft minimum width or the diameter in inches for piles/shafts 24 inches or less in width,
 and equal to the calculated elastic compression plus 1/30 of the pile/shaft minimum width or
 diameter for piles/shafts greater than 24 inches in width. Consider the nominal resistance of any
 pile/shaft so tested as either the maximum applied load or the failure load, whichever is smaller.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 548
 
 455-2.3 Measuring Apparatus: Provide an apparatus for measuring movement of the
 test piles/shafts that consists of all of the following devices:
 1. Wire Line and Scale: Stretch a wire as directed by the Engineer between two
 supports located at a distance at least:
 a. 10 feet from the center of the test pile but not less than 3.5 times the pile
 diameter or width.
 b. 12 feet from the centerline of the shaft to be tested but not less than
 three shaft diameters.
 Locate the wire supports as far as practical from reaction beam anchorages. At
 over-water test sites, the Contractor may attach the wire line as directed by the Engineer to the
 sides of the service platform. Mount the wire with a pulley on one support and a weight at the
 end of the wire to provide constant tension on the wire. Ensure that the wire passes across the
 face of a scale mounted on a mirror attached to the test pile/shaft so that readings can be made
 directly from the scale. Use the scale readings as a check on an average of the dial readings.
 When measuring both horizontal and vertical movement, mount separate wires to indicate each
 movement, horizontal or vertical. Measure horizontal movements from two reference wires set
 normal to each other in a horizontal.
 2. Wooden Reference Beams and Dial Gauges: Attach wooden reference beams
 as detailed in the Plans or approved by the Engineer to independent supports. For piles, install
 the greater of 3.5 times the pile diameter or width or 10 feet from the centerline of the test pile.
 For drilled shafts, install at the greater of three shaft diameters or 12 feet from the centerline of
 the shaft to be tested. Locate the reference beam supports as far as practical from reaction beam
 anchorages. For over-water test sites, the Contractor may attach the reference beams as directed
 by the Engineer between two diagonal platform supports. Attach dial gauges, with their stems
 resting either on the top of the pile/shaft or on lugs or similar reference points on the pile/shaft,
 to the fixed beams to record the movement of the pile/shaft head. Ensure that the area on the
 pile/shaft or lug on which the stem bears is a smooth surface which will not cause irregularities
 in the dial readings.
 Provide a minimum of four dial gauges, each with 0.001 inch divisions
 and with 2 inch minimum travel, placed at 90 degree intervals for measuring vertical or
 horizontal movement.
 3. Survey Level: As a check on the dial gauges, determine the elevation of a point
 near the top of the test pile/shaft (on plan datum) by survey level at each load and unload interval
 during the load test. Unless approved otherwise by the Engineer, level survey precision is
 0.001 foot. Alternately, the surveyor may read an engineer’s 50 scale attached near the pile/shaft
 head. Determine the first elevation before applying the first load increment; make intermediate
 readings immediately before a load increment or an unload decrement, and after the final unload
 decrement that completely removes the load. Make a final reading at the time of the last recovery
 reading or as directed by the Engineer.
 For over-water test sites, when shown in the Plans or directed by the
 Engineer, the Contractor shall drive an H pile through a 36 inch casing to provide a stable
 support for the level and to protect it against wave action interfering with level measurements.
 Provide a suitable movable jig for the surveyor to stand. Use a jig that has a minimum of three
 legs, has a work platform providing at least 4 feet width of work area around the casing, and is
 approved by the Engineer before use. The described work platform may be supported by the
 protective casing when approved by the Engineer.

 455-2.4 Load Test Instrumentation:
 1. General: The intent of the load test instrumentation is to measure the test load
 on top of the pile/shaft and, when provided in the Contract Documents, its distribution between
 side friction and end bearing to provide evaluation of the preliminary design calculations and
 settlement estimates and to provide information for final pile/shaft length design. Ensure that the
 instrumentation is as described in the Contract Documents.
 When requested by the Engineer, provide assistance during installation of
 any instrumentation supplied by the Department. Supply 110 V, 60 Hz, 30 A of AC electric
 power in accordance with the National Electric Code (NEC) to each test pile/shaft site during the
 installation of the instrumentation, during the load testing, and during any instrumented redrives
 ordered by the Engineer.
 Place all of the internal instrumentation on the rebar cage before
 installation in the test shaft. Construct the rebar cage at least two days before it is required for
 construction of the test shaft. Provide assistance during installation of instrumentation supplied
 by the Department, including help to string, place, and tie the instrumentation and any assistance
 needed in moving or repositioning the cage to facilitate installation. Place the rebar cage in one
 segment complete with its instrumentation. The Engineer may require multiple lift points and/or
 a suitable “stiffleg” (length of H pile or other suitable section) to get the cage in a vertical
 position without causing damage to the instrumentation. Successfully demonstrate the lifting and
 handling procedures before the installing instrumentation.
 2. Hydraulic Jack and Load Cell: Provide hydraulic jack(s) of adequate size to
 deliver the required test load to the pile/shaft unless shown otherwise in the Plans. Before load
 testing begins, submit a certificate from a reputable testing laboratory showing a calibration of
 gauge readings for all stages of jack loading and unloading for jacks provided. Ensure that the
 jack has been calibrated within the preceding six months unless approved otherwise. Recalibrate
 the jack after completing load testing if so directed by the Engineer. Ensure that the accuracy of
 the gauge is within 5% of the true load.
 Provide an adequate load cell approved by the Engineer that has been
 calibrated within the preceding six months. Provide an approved electrical readout device for the
 load cell. Submit a certificate from an independent testing laboratory showing a calibration of
 readings for all stages of loading and unloading for load cells furnished by the Contractor and
 obtain the approval of the Engineer before beginning load testing. Ensure that the accuracy of the
 load cell is within 1% of the true load.
 3. Telltales: When shown in the Contract Documents, furnish and install telltales
 that consist of an unstressed steel rod placed, greased for reducing friction and corrosion, with
 appropriate clearance inside a constant-diameter pipe that rests on a flat plate attached to the end
 of the pipe at the point of interest shown in the Contract Documents. Construct telltales in
 accordance with the Contract Documents. Install dial gauges reading to 0.001 inch with 1 inch
 minimum travel as directed by the Engineer to measure the movement of the telltale with respect
 to the top of the pile/shaft.
 4. Embedded Strain Gauges: When shown in the Contract Documents, furnish and
 install strain gauges in the test shaft to measure the distribution of the load. Ensure that the type,
 number, and location of the strain gauges are as shown in the Plans or as directed by the
 Engineer. Use strain gauges that are waterproof and have suitable shielded cable that is unspliced
 within the shaft.

 550
 
 455-2.5 Support Facilities: Furnish adequate facilities for making load and settlement
 readings 24 hours per day. Provide such facilities for the instrumented area, and include lighting
 and shelter from rain, wind, and direct sunlight.
 455-2.6 Load Test Personnel Furnished by the Contractor: Provide a certified welder,
 together with necessary cutting and welding equipment, to assist with the load test setup and to
 make any necessary adjustments during the load test. Provide personnel to operate the jack,
 generators, and lighting equipment, and also provide one person with transportation to assist as
 required during load test setup and conducting of the load tests. Provide qualified personnel, as
 determined by a Specialty Engineer or testing lab, required to read the dial gauges, take level
 measurements, and conduct the load test, except when the Contract Documents show that the

 8. When the Contract Document requires internal instrumentation of the
 pile/shaft, furnish all of the data taken during the load test together with instrument calibration
 certifications. In addition, submit a report showing an analysis of the results of axial load and
 lateral load tests in which soil resistance along and against the pile/shaft is reported as a function
 of deflection.
 Submit the necessary reports prepared by the Specialty Engineer responsible for
 collection and interpretation of the data, except when the Contract Documents show that the
 Department will provide a Geotechnical Engineer.
 455-2.9 Disposition of Loading Material: Remove all equipment and materials, which
 remains the Contractor’s property, from the site. Clean up and restore the site to the satisfaction
 of the Engineer.

 551
 
 455-2.10 Disposition of Tested Piles/Shafts: After completing testing, cut off the tested
 piles/shafts, which are not to be incorporated into the final structure, and any reaction piles/shafts
 at an elevation 24 inches below the finished ground surface or as shown in the Plans. Take
 ownership of the cut-offs and provide areas for their disposal.
 B. PILING
 
 455-3 Description.
 Furnish and install concrete, steel, or wood piling including driving, jetting, preformed
 pile holes, cutting off, splicing, dynamic load testing, and static load testing of piling.
 In the event a pile is broken or otherwise damaged by the Contractor to the extent that the
 damage is irreparable, in the opinion of the Engineer, the Contractor shall extract and replace the
 pile at no additional expense to the Department. In the event that a pile is mislocated by the
 Contractor, the Contractor shall extract and replace the pile, at no expense to the Department,
 except when a design change proposed by the Contractor is approved by the Department as
 provided in 455-5.16.5.
 455-4 Classification.
 The Department classifies piling as follows:
 1. Treated timber piling.
 2. Prestressed concrete piling.
 3. Steel piling.
 4. Test piling.
 5. Sheet piling.
 a. Concrete sheet piling.
 b. Steel sheet piling.
 6. Polymeric Piles (see Section 471 for requirements).
 455-5 General Requirements.
 455-5.1 Predrilling of Pile Holes: Predrilled pile holes are either starter holes to the
 depth described in this Subarticle or holes drilled through embankment/fill material down to the
 natural ground surface at no additional cost to the Department. When using low displacement
 steel piling such as structural shapes, drive them through the compacted fill without the necessity
 of drilling holes through the fill except when the requirements for predrilling are shown in the
 Plans. When using concrete or other high displacement piles, drill pile holes through fill, new or
 existing, to at least the elevation of the natural ground surface. Use the range of drill diameters
 listed below for square concrete piles.
 12 inch square piles ......................... 15 to 17 inches
 14 inch square piles ......................... 18 to 20 inches
 18 inch square piles ......................... 22 to 26 inches
 20 inch square piles ......................... 24 to 29 inches
 24 inch square piles ......................... 30 to 34 inches
 30 inch square piles ......................... 36 to 43 inches
 For other pile sizes, use the diameter of the drills shown in the Plans or approved
 by the Engineer. Accurately drill the pile holes with the hole centered over the Plan location of
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 552
 
 the piling. Maintain the location and vertical alignment within the tolerances allowed for the
 piling.
 For predrilled holes required through rock or other hard (i.e. debris, obstructions,
 etc.) materials that may damage the pile during installation, predrill hole diameters
 approximately 2 inches larger than the largest dimension across the pile cross-section. Fill the
 annular space around the piles as described in 455-5. 10.1 with clean A-3 sand or sand meeting
 the requirements of 902-3.3.
 In the setting of permanent and test piling, the Contractor may initially predrill
 holes to a depth up to 10 feet or 20% of the pile length whichever is greater, unless otherwise
 shown in the Plans. Where installing piles in compacted fill, predrill the holes to the elevation of
 the natural ground surface. With prior written authorization from the Engineer, the Contractor
 may predrill holes to greater depths to minimize the effects of vibrations on existing structures
 adjacent to the work and/or for other reasons the Contractor proposes.
 455-5.2 Underwater Driving: Underwater driving is defined as any driving through
 water which is above the pile head at the time of driving.
 When conducting underwater driving, provide a diver equipped with voice
 communications to aid in placing the hammer back on the pile for required cushion changes or
 for subsequent redriving, to attach or recover instrumentation the Engineer is using, to inspect
 the condition of the pile, or for other assistance as required.
 Select one of the following methods for underwater driving:
 1. Accomplish underwater driving using conventional driving equipment
 and piling longer than authorized so that the piling will extend above the water surface during
 final driving. When choosing this option, furnish a pile hammer that satisfies the requirements of
 this Section for use with the longer pile.
 2. Accomplish underwater driving using an underwater hammer that meets
 the requirements of this Section and is approved by the Engineer. When choosing this option,
 provide at least one pile longer than authorized at each pile group, extending above the water
 surface at final driving. At each group location, drive the longer pile first. The Engineer will
 evaluate the adequacy of the underwater driving system. The Engineer may use the pile tip
 elevation of the longer pile that the Contractor has driven and the Engineer has accepted, to
 evaluate the acceptability of the piles driven with the underwater hammer.
 3. Accomplish underwater driving using conventional driving equipment
 with a suitable approved pile follower. When choosing this option, provide at least one pile
 longer than required at each pile group, extending above the water surface at final driving. At
 each group location, drive the full length pile first without using the follower. The Engineer will
 evaluate the adequacy of the follower used for underwater driving. The Engineer may choose to
 perform a dynamic load test on the first pile the Contractor drives with the follower in each
 group. The Engineer may use the pile tip elevation of the longer pile, that the Contractor has
 driven and the Engineer has accepted, to evaluate the acceptability of the piles driven with the
 follower.
 Prior to use, submit details of the follower for the Engineer’s evaluation and
 approval along with the information required in 455-10. Include the weight, cross-section details,
 stiffness, type of materials, and dimensions of the follower.
 455-5.3 Pile Hammers: All equipment is subject to satisfactory field performance. Use a
 variable energy hammer to drive concrete piles. Hammers will be rated based on the theoretical
 energy of the ram at impact. Supply driving equipment which provides the required resistance at
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 553
 
 a blow count ranging from 3 blows per inch (36 blows per foot) to 10 blows per inch (120 blows
 per foot) at the end of initial drive, unless approved otherwise by the Engineer after satisfactory
 field trial. Ensure the hammer is capable of driving to a resistance equal to at least 2.0 times the
 factored design load plus the scour and down drag resistance shown in the Contract Documents,
 without overstressing the piling in compression or tension and without reaching or exceeding
 20 blows per inch. When the Engineer determines the stroke height or bounce chamber pressure
 readings do not adequately determine the energy of the hammer, provide and maintain a device
 to measure the velocity of the ram at impact. Determine the actual hammer energy in the field so
 that it is consistent with the hammer energy used for each bearing capacity determination. When
 requested, submit to the Engineer all technical specifications and operating instructions related to
 hammer equipment.
 455-5.3.1 Air/steam: Variable energy air/steam hammers shall be capable of
 providing at least two ram stroke lengths. The short ram stroke length shall be approximately
 half of the full stroke for hammers with strokes up to 4 feet and no more than 2 feet for hammers
 with maximum strokes lengths over 4 feet. Operate and maintain air/steam hammers within the
 manufacturer’s specified ranges. Use a plant and equipment for steam and air hammers with
 sufficient capacity to maintain, under working conditions, the hammer, volume and pressure
 specified by the manufacturer. Equip the plant and equipment with accurate pressure gauges
 which are easily accessible to the Engineer. The Engineer will not accept final bearing on piles
 the Contractor drives with air/steam hammers unless the Contractor operates the hammers within
 10% of the manufacturer’s rated speed in blows per minute, unless otherwise authorized by the
 Engineer. Provide and maintain in working order for the Engineer’s use an approved device to
 automatically determine and display the blows per minute of the hammer.
 455-5.3.2 Diesel: Variable energy diesel hammers shall have at least three fuel
 settings that will produce reduced strokes. Operate and maintain diesel hammers within the
 manufacturer’s specified ranges. Determine the rated energy of diesel hammers using measured
 ram stroke length multiplied by the weight of the ram for open end hammers and by methods
 recommended by the manufacturer for closed end hammers.
 Provide and maintain in working order for the Engineer’s use an approved
 device to automatically determine and display ram stroke for open-end diesel hammers.
 Equip closed-end (double acting) diesel hammers with a bounce chamber
 pressure gauge, in good working order, mounted near ground level so the Engineer can easily
 read it. Also, submit to the Engineer a chart, calibrated to actual hammer performance within
 30 days prior to initial use, equating bounce chamber pressure to either equivalent energy or
 stroke for the closed-end diesel hammer to be used.
 455-5.3.3 Hydraulic: Variable energy hydraulic hammers shall have at least three
 hydraulic control settings that provide for predictable energy or equivalent ram stroke. The
 shortest stroke shall be a maximum of 2 feet for the driving of concrete piles. The remaining
 strokes shall include full stroke and approximately halfway between minimum and maximum
 stroke.
 Supply hammer instrumentation with electronic read out, and control unit
 that allows the operator to read and adjust the hammer energy or equivalent ram stroke. When
 pressure measuring equipment is required to determine hammer energy, calibrate the pressure
 measuring equipment before use.
 455-5.3.4 Vibratory: Vibratory hammers of sufficient capacity (force and
 amplitude) may be used to drive steel sheet piles and, with approval of the Engineer, to drive
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 554
 
 steel bearing piles a sufficient distance to get the impact hammer on the pile (to stick the pile).
 The Engineer will determine the allowable depth of driving using the vibratory hammer based on
 site conditions. However, in all cases, use a power impact hammer for the last 15 feet or more of
 the final driving of steel bearing piles for bearing determinations after all piles in the bent/pier
 have been driven with a vibratory hammer. Do not use vibratory hammers to install concrete
 piles, or to install support or reaction piles for a load test.
 455-5.4 Cushions and Pile Helmet:
 455-5.4.1 Capblock: Provide a capblock (also called the hammer cushion) as
 recommended by the hammer manufacturer. Use commercially manufactured capblocks
 constructed of durable manmade materials with uniform known properties. Do not use wood
 chips, wood blocks, rope, or other material which permit excessive loss of hammer energy. Do
 not use capblocks constructed of asbestos materials. Obtain the Engineer’s approval for all
 proposed capblock materials and proposed thickness for use. Maintain capblocks in good
 condition, and replace them when charred, melted, or otherwise significantly deteriorated. The
 Engineer will inspect the capblock before driving begins and weekly or at appropriate intervals
 determined by the Engineer based on field trial. Replace or repair any capblock which loses more
 than 25% of its original thickness, in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, before
 permitting further driving.
 455-5.4.2 Pile Cushion: Provide a pile cushion that is adequate to protect the pile
 from being overstressed in compression and tension during driving. Use a pile cushion sized so
 that it will fully fill the lateral dimensions of the pile helmet minus one inch but does not cover
 any void or hole extending through the top of the pile. Determine the thickness based upon the
 hammer-pile-soil system. For driving concrete piles, use a pile cushion made from pine plywood
 or oak lumber. Alternative materials may be used with the approval of the Engineer. Obtain the
 Engineer’s approval for all pile cushions. Do not use materials previously soaked, saturated or
 treated with oil. Maintain pile cushions in good condition and replace them when charred,
 splintered, excessively compressed, or otherwise deteriorated to the point it will not protect the
 pile against overstressing in tension or compression. Protect cushions from the weather, and keep
 them dry. Do not soak the cushions in any liquid. Replace the pile cushion, if during the driving
 of any pile, the cushion is either compressed more than one-half the original thickness, begins to
 burn, or as directed by the Engineer after field performance. Provide a new cushion for each pile
 unless approved otherwise by the Engineer after satisfactory field trial.
 Reuse pile cushions in good condition to perform all set-checks and
 redrives. Use the same cushion to perform the set-check or redrive as was used during the initial
 driving, unless this cushion is unacceptable due to deterioration, in which case use a similar
 cushion.
 455-5.4.3 Pile Helmet: Provide a pile helmet suitable for the type and size of
 piling being driven. Use a pile helmet deep enough to adequately contain the required thickness
 of pile cushion and to assist in maintaining pile-hammer alignment. Use a pile helmet that fits
 loosely over the pile head and is at least 1 inch larger than the pile dimensions. Use a pile helmet
 designed so that it will not restrain the pile from rotating.
 455-5.5 Leads: Provide pile leads constructed in a manner which offers freedom of
 movement to the hammer and that have the strength and rigidity to hold the hammer and pile in
 the correct position and alignment during driving. When using followers, use leads that are long
 enough and suitable to maintain position and alignment of the hammer, follower, and pile
 throughout driving.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 555
 
 455-5.6 Followers: When using followers, perform dynamic load testing as per 455-5.14.
 Obtain the Engineer’s approval for the type of follower, when used, and the method of
 connection to the leads and pile. Use followers constructed of steel with an adequate crosssection to withstand driving stresses. When driving concrete piles, ensure that the cross-sectional
 area of the follower is at least 18% of the cross-sectional area of the pile. When driving steel
 piles, ensure that the cross-sectional area of the follower is greater than or equal to the crosssectional area of the pile. Provide a pile helmet at the lower end of the follower sized according
 to the requirements of 455-5.4.3. Use followers constructed that maintain the alignment of the
 pile, follower, and hammer and still allow the pile to be driven within the allowable tolerances.
 Use followers designed with guides adapted to the leads that maintain the hammer, follower, and
 the piles in alignment.
 Use information from dynamic load tests described in 455-5.14 to evaluate the
 adequacy of the follower and to determine pile capacity.
 455-5.7 Templates and Ground Elevations: Provide a fixed template, adequate to
 maintain the pile in proper position and alignment during driving with swinging leads or with
 semi-fixed leads. Where practical, place the template so that the pile can be driven to cut-off
 elevation before removing the template. Ensure that templates do not restrict the vertical
 movement of the pile.
 Supply a stable reference close to the pile, which is satisfactory in the opinion of
 the Engineer, for determination of the pile penetration. At the time of driving piles, furnish the
 Engineer with elevations of the original ground and template at each pile or pile group location.
 Note the highest and lowest elevation at each required location and the ground elevation at all
 piles.
 455-5.8 Water Jets: Use jet pumps, supply lines, and jet pipes that provide adequate
 pressure and volume of water to freely erode the soil. Do not perform jetting without prior
 approval by the Engineer or unless allowed by the Plans.
 Do not perform jetting in the embankment or for end bents. Where conditions
 warrant, with approval by the Engineer, perform jetting on the holes first, place the pile therein,
 then drive the pile to secure the last few feet of penetration. Only use one jet for prejetting or
 jetting through piles constructed with a center jet-hole. Use two jets when using external jets.
 When jetting and driving, position the jets slightly behind the advancing pile tip (approximately
 3 feet or as approved by the Engineer). When using water jets in the driving, determine the pile
 bearing only from the results of driving after withdrawing the jets, except where using jets to
 continuously eliminate soil resistance through the scour zone, ensure that they remain in place as
 directed by the Engineer and operating during pile bearing determination. Where practical,
 perform jetting on all piles in a pile group before driving begins. When large pile groups or pile
 spacing and batter make this impractical, or when the Plans specify a jet-drive sequence, set
 check a sufficient number of previously driven piles in a pile group to confirm their capacity
 after completing all jetting.
 455-5.9 Penetration Requirements: Measure the penetration of piles from the elevation
 of natural ground, scour elevation shown in the Plans, or the bottom of excavation, whichever is
 lower. When the Contract Documents show a minimum pile tip elevation, drive the tip of the pile
 to this minimum elevation. The Engineer will accept the bearing of a pile only if the Contractor
 achieves the required bearing when the tip of the pile is at or below the specified minimum tip
 elevation and below the bottom of the preformed or predrilled pile hole.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 556
 
 When the Plans do not show a minimum tip elevation, ensure that the penetration
 is at least 10 feet into firm bearing material or at least 20 feet into soft material unless otherwise
 permitted by the Engineer. If a scour elevation is shown in the Plans, achieve this penetration
 below the scour elevation. The Engineer may accept a penetration between 15 feet and 20 feet
 when there is an accumulation of five consecutive feet or more of firm bearing material. Firm
 bearing material is any material offering a driving resistance greater than or equal to 30 tons per
 square foot of gross pile area as determined by the Dynamic Load Testing (455-5.12.4). Soft
 material is any material offering less than these resistances. The gross pile area is the actual pile
 tip cross-sectional area for solid concrete piles, the product of the width and depth for H piles,
 and the area within the outside perimeter for pipe piles and voided concrete piles.
 Do not drive piles beyond practical refusal. To meet the requirements in this
 Subarticle, provide penetration aids, such as jetting or preformed pile holes, when piles cannot be
 driven to the required penetration without reaching practical refusal.
 If the Contractor encounters unforeseeable, isolated obstructions that the
 Contractor cannot practically penetrate by driving, jetting, or preformed pile holes, and the
 Contractor must remove the pile to obtain the required pile penetration, the Department will pay
 the costs for such removal as Unforeseeable Work.
 455-5.10 Preformed Pile Holes:
 455-5.10.1 Description: Preformed pile holes serve as a penetration aid when all
 other pile installation methods fail to produce the desired penetration and when authorized by the
 Engineer to minimize the effects of vibrations on adjacent structures. Preformed pile holes are
 necessary when the presence of rock or strong strata of soils will not permit the installation of
 piles to the desired penetration by driving or a combination of jetting and driving, when
 determined necessary by the Engineer, or when authorized by the Engineer to minimize the
 effects of vibrations on adjacent existing structures. The Engineer may require preformed holes
 for any type of pile. Drive all piles installed in preformed pile holes to determine that the bearing
 requirements have been met.
 For preformed holes which are required through material that caves during
 driving to the extent that the preformed hole does not serve its intended purpose, case the hole
 from the surface through caving material. After installing the pile to the bottom of the casing,
 remove the casings unless shown otherwise in the Plans. Determine bearing of the pile after
 removing the casing unless shown otherwise in the Plans. Fill all voids between the pile and soil
 remaining after driving through preformed holes with clean A-3 sand or sand meeting the
 requirements of 902-3.3, after the pile has achieved the required minimum tip elevation, unless
 grouting of preformed pile holes is shown in the Plans. If pile driving is interrupted during sand
 placement, drive the pile at least 20 additional blows after filling all of the voids between the pile
 and soil with sand at no additional cost to the Department.
 455-5.10.2 Provisions for Use of Preformed Pile Holes: The Department
 generally anticipates the necessity for preformed pile holes and includes directions in the
 Contract Documents. The Department will pay for preformed pile holes when the Contractor
 establishes that the required results cannot be obtained when driving the load bearing piles with
 specified driving equipment, or if jetting is allowed, while jetting the piles and then driving or
 while jetting the piles during driving.
 455-5.10.3 Conditions Under Which Payment Will Be Made: The Department
 will make payment for preformed pile holes shown in the Plans, required by the Engineer or
 where the Contractor demonstrates that such work is necessary to achieve the required
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 557
 
 penetration without overstressing the pile. The Department considers, but does not limit to, the
 following conditions as reasons for preformed pile holes:
 1. Inability to drive piles to the required penetration with driving and
 jetting equipment.
 2. To penetrate a hard layer or layers of rock or strong stratum that the
 Engineer considers not sufficiently thick to support the structure.
 3. To obtain greater penetration into dense (strong) material and into dense
 material containing holes, cavities or unstable soft layers.
 4. To obtain penetration into a stratum in which it is desired to found the
 structure.
 5. To minimize the effects of vibrations or heave on adjacent existing
 structures.
 6. To minimize the effects of ground heave on adjacent piles.
 455-5.10.4 Construction Methods: Construct preformed pile holes by drilling, or
 driving and withdrawing a suitable punch or chisel at the locations of the piles. Construct a hole
 that is equal to or slightly greater than the largest pile dimension for the entire length of the hole
 and of sufficient depth to obtain the required penetration. Carefully form the preformed hole by
 using a drill or punch guided by a template or other suitable device, and do not exceed the
 minimum dimensions necessary to achieve the required penetration of the pile. When the Plans
 call for grouting the preformed pile holes, provide a minimum pile hole dimension 2 inches
 larger than the largest pile dimension. Construct the holes at the Plan position of the pile and the
 tolerances in location, and ensure the hole is straight and that the batter is the same as specified
 for the pile. Loose material may remain in the preformed pile hole if the conditions in 455-5.10.1
 are satisfied.
 455-5.10.5 Grouting of Pile Holes: Clean and grout preformed pile holes for
 bearing piles, when the Plans require grouting after driving. Use grout that meets the
 requirements of 455-40 to 455-42 and has a minimum compressive strength of 3,000 psi at
 28 days or as specified in the Plans. Prepare cylinders and perform QC testing in accordance
 with 455-43. LOT size and verification will be in accordance with 455-43. Pump the grout
 through three or more grout pipes initially placed at the bottom of the preformed hole. The
 Contractor may raise the grout pipes when necessary to prevent clogging and to complete the
 grouting operations. Maintain the grout pipes below the surface of the previously placed grout.
 Continue grouting until the grout reaches the ground surface all around the pile. Provide divers to
 monitor grouting operations when the water depth is such that it is impractical to monitor from
 the ground surface. When grouting is shown in the Plans, include the cost in the price for piles.
 In the event that the Engineer determines the Contractor must grout and the required grouting is
 not shown in the Plans, the Department will pay for the grouting work as Unforeseeable Work.
 455-5.11 Bearing Requirements:
 455-5.11.1 General: Drive piles to provide the bearing required for carrying the
 loads shown in the Plans. For all types of bearing piles, consider the driving resistance as
 determined by the methods described herein sufficient for carrying the specified loads as the
 minimum bearing which is accepted for any type of piles. Determine pile bearing using the
 method described herein or as shown in the Plans.
 For foundations requiring 100% dynamic testing of production piles, the
 Engineer may accept a driven pile when the pile has achieved minimum penetration and the
 minimum required bearing for 6 inches of consecutive driving, or when the minimum penetration
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 558
 
 is achieved, driving has reached practical refusal in firm material and the bearing capacity is
 obtained in all the refusal blows.
 For foundations not requiring 100% dynamic testing of production piles,
 the Engineer may accept a driven pile when the pile has achieved minimum penetration, the blow
 count is generally the same or increasing and the minimum required bearing capacity obtained
 for 24 inches of consecutive driving. At the discretion of the Engineer, the driven pile may be
 accepted when the minimum penetration is achieved and driving has reached practical refusal in
 firm material.
 The Engineer may modify the scour resistance shown in the Plans if the
 dynamic load test is used to determine the actual soil resistance through the scour zone. Also, the
 Engineer may make modifications in scour resistance when the Contractor proposes drilling
 and/or jetting to reduce the soil resistance in the scour zone.
 455-5.11.2 Bearing Criteria: For foundations requiring 100% dynamic testing,
 the Engineer will determine the bearing of all piles using the data received from dynamic load
 testing equipment utilizing internally or externally mounted sensors according to the methods
 described in 455-5.12.1.
 For foundations not requiring 100% dynamic testing, the Engineer will
 determine the number of blows required to provide the required bearing according to the
 methods described herein. Determine the pile bearing by computing the penetration per blow
 with less than 1/4 inches rebound averaged through 12 inches of penetration. When it is
 considered necessary by the Engineer, determine the average penetration per blow by averaging
 the penetration per blow through the last 10 to 20 blows of the hammer.
 455-5.11.3 Practical Refusal: Practical refusal is defined as 20 blows per inch or
 less than one inch penetration, with the hammer operating at the highest setting determined by
 the Engineer and less than 1/4 inches rebound per blow. Stop driving as soon as the Engineer
 determines that the pile has reached practical refusal.
 455-5.11.4 Set-checks and Pile Redrive:
 1. Set-checks: In the event that the Contractor has driven the pile to
 approximately 12 inches above cut-off without reaching the required resistance, the Engineer
 may require the Contractor to interrupt driving to perform a set-check. Provide an engineer’s
 level or other suitable equipment for elevation determinations to determine accurate pile
 penetration during the set-checks. In the event the results of the initial set-checks are not
 satisfactory, the Engineer may direct additional set-checks. The Engineer may accept the pile as
 driven when a set-check shows that the Contractor has achieved the minimum required pile
 bearing and has met all other requirements of this Section.
 2. Pile Redrive: Pile redrive consists of redriving the pile after the
 following working day from initial driving to determine time effects, to reestablish pile capacity
 due to pile heave, or for other reasons determined by the Engineer. Redrive piles as directed by
 the Engineer.
 3. Uninstrumented Set-Checks and Uninstrumented Pile Redrive: The
 Engineer may consider the pile to have sufficient bearing resistance when the specified set-check
 criteria is met through the last 10 to 20 blows of the hammer at the specified minimum stroke
 and the total penetration is less than six inches with less than 1/4 inches rebound per blow. When
 the total penetration is greater than six inches or pile rebound exceeds 1/4 inches per blow, the
 Engineer may consider the pile to have sufficient bearing resistance when the specified blow
 count criteria is achieved in accordance with 455-5.11.1.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 559
 
 4. Instrumented Set-Checks and Instrumented Pile Redrive: When
 considered necessary by the Engineer, dynamic load tests using at least 6 hammer blows will
 determine whether the pile bearing is sufficient. The Engineer may consider the pile to have
 sufficient bearing resistance when dynamic measurements demonstrate the static pile resistance
 exceeds the required pile resistance for at least one hammer blow and the average static pile
 resistance during the next five hammer blows exceeds 95% of the required pile resistance. If the
 pile is advanced farther, the static pile resistance during all subsequent blows must exceed 90%
 of the required pile resistance.
 455-5.11.5 Pile Heave: Pile heave is the upward movement of a pile from its
 originally driven elevation. Drive the piles in an approved sequence to minimize the effects of
 heave and lateral displacement of the ground. Monitor piles previously driven in a pile group for
 possible heave during the driving of the remaining piles. When required by the Engineer, take
 elevation measurements to determine the magnitude of the movement of piles and the ground
 surface resulting from the driving process. Redrive all piles that have heaved 1/4 inches or more
 unless the Engineer determines that the heave is not detrimental to pile capacity. The Department
 will pay for all work in conjunction with redriving piles due to pile heave under the pile redrive
 item.
 455-5.11.6 Piles with Insufficient Bearing: In the case that the Engineer
 determines that the safe bearing capacity of any pile is less than the required bearing capacity,
 the Contractor may splice the pile and continue driving or may extract the pile and drive a pile of
 greater length, or, if so ordered by the Engineer, drive additional piles.
 455-5.12 Methods to Determine Pile Capacity:
 455-5.12.1 General: Dynamic load tests using an externally mounted instrument
 system and signal matching analyses or internal gauges will determine pile capacity for all
 structures or projects unless otherwise shown in the Plans. When necessary, the Engineer may
 require static load tests to confirm pile capacities. When the Contract Documents do not include
 items for static load tests, the Engineer will consider all required static load testing
 Unforeseeable Work. Notify the Engineer two working days prior to placement of piles within
 the template and at least one working day prior to driving piles. Do not drive piles without the
 presence of the Engineer.
 If the internally mounted system fails to communicate properly with the receiving
 system, allow the Engineer sufficient time to mobilize back-up equipment for performing
 dynamic load testing.
 455-5.12.2 Wave Equation:
 1. Use Wave Equation Analysis for Piles (WEAP) programs to evaluate
 the suitability of the proposed driving system (including the hammer, follower, capblock and pile
 cushions) as well as to estimate the driving resistance, in blows per 12 inches or blows per inch,
 to achieve the pile bearing requirements and to evaluate pile driving stresses.
 Use Wave Equation Analyses to show the hammer meets the
 requirements described in 455-5.3 and maximum allowed pile stresses are not exceeded.
 2. Required Equipment For Driving: Hammer approval is based on
 satisfactory field performance including dynamic load test results. In the event piles require
 different hammer sizes, the Contractor may elect to drive with more than one size hammer or
 with a variable energy hammer, provided the hammer is properly sized and cushioned, will not
 damage the pile, and will develop the required resistance.
 3. Maximum Allowed Pile Stresses:

 steel, and timber piles are given below. In the event dynamic load tests show that the hammer
 will overstress the pile, modify the driving system or method of operation as required to prevent
 overstressing the pile. In such cases provide additional cushioning, reduce the stroke, or make
 other appropriate agreed upon changes.
 b. Prestressed Concrete Piles: Use the following equations to
 determine the maximum allowed pile stresses:
 s apc = 0.7 f c′ − 0.75 f
 
 (1)
 
 pe
 
 0.5
 sapt = 6.5 (f c′ ) + 1.05 f cpe
 
 (2a) for piles less than 50 feet long
 
 0.5
 sapt = 3.25 (f c′ ) + 1.05 f cpe (2b) for piles 50 feet long and greater
 
 (2c) within 20 feet of a mechanical splice
 
 s apt = 500
 where:
 
 s apc = maximum allowed pile compressive stress, psi
 s apt = maximum allowed pile tensile stress, psi
 f′ c = specified minimum compressive strength of concrete, psi
 f cpe = effective prestress (after all losses) at the time of driving, psi, taken
 as 0.8 times the initial prestress force divided by the minimum net concrete cross-sectional area
 of the pile (f cpe = 0 for dowel spliced piles).
 c. Steel Piles: Ensure the maximum pile compression and tensile
 stresses measured during driving are no greater than 0.9 times the yield strength (0.9 f y ) of the
 steel.
 d. Timber Piles: Ensure the maximum pile compression and tensile
 stresses measured during driving are no greater than 3.6 ksi for Southern Pine and Pacific Coast
 Douglas Fir and 0.9 of the ultimate parallel to the grain strength for piles of other wood.
 455-5.12.3 Temporary Piles: Submit for the Engineers review, an analysis
 signed and sealed by a Specialty Engineer which establishes the pile lengths for temporary piles.
 Submit for the Engineers approval, a Wave Equation analysis signed and sealed by a Specialty
 Engineer which establishes the driving criteria for temporary piles at least five working days
 prior to driving temporary production piles. The required driving resistance is equal to the sum of
 the factored design load plus the scour and down drag resistances shown in the Plans, divided by
 the appropriate resistance factor or the nominal bearing resistance shown in the Plans, whichever
 is higher.
 The maximum resistance factor is 0.45 when only wave equation analysis
 is performed. However, a larger resistance factor may be applicable when additional testing is
 provided by the Specialty Engineer in accordance with Section 3.5.6 of Volume 1 of the FDOT
 Structures Manual. If the Contractor elects to perform 100% dynamic load testing submit a
 certification package prepared by the Specialty Engineer. The certification package shall include
 a signed and sealed letter by the Specialty Engineer that certifies the piles meet the load
 requirements and have no integrity deficiencies. The package shall also include the dynamic load

 test records, all signal matching analysis performed to determine pile capacities and a summary
 table that indicates the final capacity of every pile.
 455-5.12.4 Dynamic Load Tests: Dynamic load testing consists of estimating
 pile capacity by the analysis of electronic data collected from blows of the hammer during
 driving of an instrumented pile in accordance with 455-5.14.
 455-5.12.5 Static Load Tests: Static load testing consists of applying a static load
 to the pile to determine its capacity. Use The Modified Quick Test Procedure in accordance with
 455-2.2.1.
 455-5.12.6 Fender Pile Installation: For piles used in fender systems, regardless
 of type or size of pile, either drive them full length or jet the piles to within 2 feet of cutoff and
 drive to cutoff elevation to seat the pile. The Engineer will not require a specific driving
 resistance unless noted in the Plans. Use methods and equipment for installation that do not
 damage the piles. If the method or equipment used causes damage to the pile, modify the
 methods or equipment at no expense to the Department.
 455-5.12.7 Structures Without Test Piles: For structures without 100% dynamic
 testing or test piles, the Engineer will dynamically test the first pile(s) in each bent or pier at
 locations shown in the Plans to determine the blow count criteria for the remaining piles. When
 locations are not shown in the Plans, allow for dynamic load tests at 5% of the piles at each bent
 or pier (rounded up to the next whole number). If the Engineer requires additional dynamic load
 tests for comparison purposes, the Contractor will be paid for an additional dynamic load test as
 authorized by the Engineer in accordance with 455-11.5.
 Allow the Engineer one working day after driving the dynamic load tested piles to
 complete the signal matching analyses and determine the driving criteria for the subsequent piles
 in the bent or pier.
 455-5.13 Test Piles:
 455-5.13.1 General: All test piles will have dynamic load tests. Drive piles of the
 same cross-section and type as the permanent piles shown in the Plans, in order to determine any
 or all of the following:
 1. installation criteria for the piles.
 2. nature of the soil.
 3. lengths of permanent piles required for the work.
 4. driving resistance characteristics of the various soil strata.
 5. amount of work necessary to obtain minimum required pile penetration.
 6. ability of the driving system to do the work.
 7. need for point protection.
 Because test piles are exploratory in nature, drive them harder (within the
 limits of practical refusal), deeper, and to a greater bearing resistance than required for the
 permanent piling. Except for test piles which are to be statically or Statnamically load tested,
 drive test piles their full length or to practical refusal. Splice test piles which have been driven
 their full length without achieving the required bearing, and proceed with further driving unless
 otherwise directed by the Engineer.
 As a minimum, unless otherwise directed by the Engineer, do not cease
 driving of test piles until obtaining the required bearing capacity continuously, where the blow
 count is increasing, for 10 feet unless reaching practical refusal first. Drive test piles which are to
 be statically or Statnamically load tested as anticipated for the production piles.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 562
 
 When test piles attain practical refusal prior to attaining minimum
 penetration, perform all work necessary to attain minimum penetration and the required bearing.
 Where practical, use water jets to break the pile loose for further driving. Where jetting is
 impractical, extract the pile and install a preformed pile hole through which driving will
 continue. The Department will consider the work of extracting the pile to be Unforeseeable
 Work.
 When driving test piles other than low displacement steel test piles, have
 preforming equipment available at the site and water jets as specified in 455-5.8 when jetting is
 allowed, ready for use, before the test pile driving begins.
 The Engineer may elect to interrupt pile driving up to four times on each
 test pile, two times for up to two hours and two additional times during the next working day of
 initial driving to determine time effects during the driving of test piles.
 455-5.13.2 Location of Test Piles: Drive all test piles in the position of
 permanent piles at the designated locations. Ensure that all test piles designated to be statically
 load tested are plumb. In the event that all the piles are battered at a static load test site, the
 Engineer will designate an out-of-position location for driving a plumb pile for the static load
 test.
 455-5.13.3 Equipment for Driving: Use the same hammer and equipment for
 driving test piles as for driving the permanent piles. Also use the same equipment to redrive
 piles.
 455-5.14 Dynamic Load Tests: The Engineer will take dynamic measurements during
 the driving of piles designated in the Plans or authorized by the Engineer. For concrete piles,
 install instruments prior to driving and assist the Engineer in monitoring all blows delivered to
 the pile. For steel production piles, the Engineer may accept instrumented set-checks or redrives.
 The Engineer will perform dynamic load tests to evaluate any or all of the following:
 1. Suitability of the Contractor’s driving equipment, including hammer, capblock,
 pile cushion, and any proposed follower.
 2. Pile capacity.
 3. Pile stresses.
 4. Energy transfer to pile.
 5. Distribution of soil resistance.
 6. Soil variables including quake and damping.
 7. Hammer-pile-soil system for Wave Equation analyses.
 8. Pile installation problems.
 9. Other.
 Either install internal gauges in the piles in accordance with Standard Plans,
 Index 455-003 or attach instruments (strain transducers to measure force and accelerometers to
 measure acceleration) with bolts to the pile for dynamic load testing.
 Make each follower and pile to be dynamically tested with externally attached
 instruments available to drill holes for attaching instrumentation and for wave speed
 measurements. Support the pile with timber blocks placed at appropriate intervals. Ensure that
 the pile is in a horizontal position and does not contact adjacent piles. Provide a sufficient clear
 distance at the sides of the pile for drilling the holes. The Engineer will furnish the equipment,
 materials, and labor necessary for drilling holes and taking the wave speed measurements. If the
 Engineer directs dynamic load testing, instrumented set-checks or instrumented redrives, provide
 the Engineer safe access to the top of the piles for drilling the attachment holes. After placing the
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 563
 
 leads provide the Engineer safe access to the piles to attach the instruments and for removal of
 the instruments after completing the pile driving.
 The Engineer will monitor the stresses in the piles with the dynamic test
 equipment during driving to ensure the Contractor does not exceed the maximum allowed
 stresses. If necessary, add additional cushioning, replace the cushions, or reduce the hammer
 stroke to maintain stresses below the maximum allowable. If dynamic test equipment
 measurements indicate non-axial driving, immediately realign the driving system. If the cushion
 is compressed to the point that a change in alignment of the hammer will not correct the problem,
 add cushioning or change the cushion as directed by the Engineer.
 Drive the pile to the required penetration and resistance or as directed by the
 Engineer.
 When directed by the Engineer, perform instrumented set-checks or redrives. Do
 not use a cold diesel hammer for a set-check or redrive unless in the opinion of the Engineer it is
 impractical to do otherwise. Generally, warm up the hammer by driving another pile or applying
 at least 20 blows to a previously driven pile or to timber mats placed on the ground.
 455-5.15 Pile Lengths:
 455-5.15.1 Test Pile Length: Provide the length of test piles shown in the Plans
 or as directed by the Engineer.
 455-5.15.2 Production Pile Length:
 455-5.15.2.1 Structures With Test Piles: When test pile lengths are
 shown in the Plans, the production pile lengths are based on information available during design
 and are approximate. The Engineer will determine final pile lengths in the field which may vary
 significantly from the lengths or quantities shown in the Plans.
 455-5.15.2.2 Structures Without Test Piles: Authorized lengths are
 provided as Production Pile Order Lengths in the Pile Data Table in the Structure Plans. Use
 these lengths for furnishing the permanent piling for the structure.
 455-5.15.3 Authorized Pile Lengths: The authorized pile lengths are the lengths
 determined by the Engineer based on all information available before the driving of the
 permanent piles, including, but not limited to, information gained from the driving of test piles,
 dynamic load testing, static load testing, supplemental soil testing, etc. When authorized by the
 Department, soil freeze information obtained during set checks and pile redrives may be used to
 determine authorized pile lengths for sites with extreme soil conditions. The Contractor may
 elect to provide piling with lengths longer than authorized to suit his method of installation or
 schedule. When the Contractor elects to provide longer than authorized pile lengths, the
 Department will pay for the furnished length as either the originally authorized length or the
 length between cut-off elevation and the final accepted pile tip elevation, whichever is the longer
 length.
 Within five working days after driving all the test piles, completing all
 load tests, completing all redrives, and receiving all test reports, the Engineer will provide an
 itemized list of authorized pile lengths. Use these lengths for furnishing the permanent piling for
 the structure. If the Contractor is willing to start the pile driving operations in zones consisting of
 at least four test piles designated by the Engineer, and if the Contractor so requests in writing at
 the beginning of the test pile program, the Department will provide pile lengths for these
 designated phases within five working days after driving all the test piles, completing all load
 tests, completing all redrives, and receiving all test reports for those designated zones. The
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 564
 
 Engineer will provide the driving criteria for piles within three working days of furnishing pile
 lengths.
 On multiple phase projects, the Engineer will not provide pile lengths on
 subsequent phases until completing the piling on initial phases.
 455-5.16 Allowable Driving Tolerances:
 455-5.16.1 General: Meet the tolerances described in this Subarticle for the piles
 that are free standing without lateral restraint (after the template is removed). After the piles are
 driven, do not move the piles laterally to force them to be within the specified tolerances, except
 to move battered piles to overcome the dead load deflections caused by the pile’s weight. When
 this is necessary, submit calculations signed and sealed by a Specialty Engineer that verify the
 amount of dead load deflection prior to moving any piles.
 455-5.16.2 Position: Ensure that the final position of the pile head at cut-off
 elevation is no more than 3 inches, or 1/6 of the diameter of the pile, whichever is less, laterally
 in the X or Y coordinate from the Plan position indicated in the Plans.
 455-5.16.3 Axial Alignment: Ensure that the axial alignment of the driven piles
 does not deviate by more than 1/4 inches per foot from the vertical or batter line indicated in the
 Plans.
 455-5.16.4 Elevation: Ensure that the final elevation of the pile head is no more
 than 1-1/2 inches above, or more than 4 inches below, the elevation shown in the Plans, however
 in no case shall the pile be embedded less than 8 inches into the cap or footing.
 For fender piles, cut off piles at the elevation shown in the Plans to a
 tolerance of plus 0.0 inches to minus 2.0 inches using sawing or other means as approved by the
 Engineer to provide a smooth level cut.
 455-5.16.5 Deviation From Above Tolerances: When the Contractor has failed
 to meet the above tolerances, the Contractor may propose a redesign to incorporate out of
 tolerance piles into pile caps or footings, at no expense to the Department. Ensure the
 Contractor’s Engineer of Record performs any redesign and signs and seals the redesign
 drawings and computations. Do not begin any proposed construction until the redesign has been
 reviewed for acceptability and approved by the Engineer.
 455-5.17 Disposition of Pile Cut-offs, Test Piles, and Load Test Materials:
 455-5.17.1 Pile Cut-offs:
 1. Steel Piling: Unless shown otherwise in the Plans or directed by the
 Engineer, take ownership of cut-off sections, or portions of cut-off sections, and unused piling .
 Remove them from the job, and dispose of them.
 2. Other Pile Types: Upon completion of all work under the Contract in
 connection with piling, unless shown otherwise in the Plan, take ownership of any unused cut-off
 lengths remaining, and remove them from the right-of-way. Provide areas for their disposal.
 455-5.17.2 Test Piles: Where so directed by the Plans or the Engineer, cut off, or
 build-up as necessary, test piles, and leave them in place as permanent piles. Extract and replace
 test piles driven in permanent position and found not suitable for use due to actions of the
 Contractor at no expense to the Department. Pull, or cut off at an elevation 2 feet below the
 ground surface or bottom of proposed excavation, test piles driven out of permanent position,
 and dispose of the removed portion of the test pile.
 When test piles are required to be driven in permanent pile positions, the
 Contractor may elect to drive the test pile out of position, with the approval of the Engineer,
 provided that a replacement pile is furnished and driven by the Contractor at no expense to the
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 565
 
 Department in the position that was to be occupied by the test pile. Under this option, the
 Department will pay for the test pile in the same manner as if it were in permanent position.
 Unless otherwise directed in the Plans or by the Engineer, retain
 ownership of test piles that are pulled or cut off and provide areas for their disposal.
 455-6 Timber Piling.
 455-6.1 Description: Drive timber piles of the kind and dimensions specified in the Plans
 at the locations and to the elevations shown in the Plans, or as directed by the Engineer.
 455-6.2 Materials: Meet the timber piling requirements of Section 953. Treat the piles
 according to the applicable provisions of Section 955. Treat all cuts and drilled holes in
 accordance with 470-3.
 455-6.3 Preparation for Driving:
 455-6.3.1 Caps: Protect the heads of timber piles during driving, using a cap of
 approved type, that will distribute the hammer blow over the entire cross-section of the pile.
 When necessary cut the head of the pile square before beginning pile driving.
 455-6.3.2 Collars: Provide collars or bands to protect piles against splitting and
 brooming at no expense to the Department.
 455-6.3.3 Shoes: Provide piles shod with metal shoes, of a design satisfactory to
 the Engineer, at no expense to the Department. Shape pile tips to receive the shoe and install
 according to the manufacturer’s directions.
 455-6.4 Storage and Handling: Store and handle piles in the manner necessary to avoid
 damage to the piling. Take special care to avoid breaking the surface of treated piles. Do not use
 cant dogs, hooks, or pike poles when handling and storing the piling.
 455-6.5 Cutting Off: Saw off the tops of all timber piles at the elevation indicated in the
 Plans. Saw off piles which support timber caps to the exact plane of the superimposed structure
 so that they exactly fit. Withdraw and replace broken, split, or misplaced piles.
 455-6.6 Build-ups: The Engineer will not permit splices or build-ups for timber piles.
 Extract piles driven below Plan elevation and drive a longer pile.
 455-6.7 Pile Heads:
 455-6.7.1 Piles with Timber Caps: On piles wider than the timber caps, dress off
 the part of the pile head projecting beyond the sides of the cap to a slope of 45 degrees. Coat the
 cut surface with the required preservative and then place a sheet of copper, with a weight of
 10 ounces per square foot or greater, meeting the requirements of ASTM B370. Provide a cover
 measuring at least 4 inches more in each dimension greater than the diameter of the pile. Bend
 the cover down over the pile and fasten the edges with large head copper nails or three wraps of
 No. 12 copper wire.
 455-6.7.2 Fender and Bulkhead Piles: Paint the heads of fender piles and of
 bulkhead piles with preservative and then cover with copper as provided above for piles
 supporting timber caps.
 455-7 Prestressed Concrete Piling.
 455-7.1 Description: Provide prestressed concrete piles that are manufactured, cured,
 and driven in accordance with the Contract Documents. Provide piles full length without splices
 when transported by barge or the pile length is less than or equal to 120 feet. When piles are
 transported by truck and the pile length exceeds 120 feet but is less than the maximum length for
 a three point pick-up according to Standard Plans, Index 455-001, and splicing is desired,
 provide minimal splices. Include the cost of the splices in the cost of the pile.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 566
 
 455-7.2 Manufacture: Fabricate piles in accordance with Section 450. When internal
 gauges will be used for dynamic load testing, supply and install in square prestressed concrete
 piles in accordance with Standard Plans, Index 455-003. Ensure the internal gauges are installed
 by personnel approved by the manufacturer.
 455-7.3 Storage and Handling:
 455-7.3.1 Time of Driving Piles: Drive prestressed concrete piles at any time
 after the concrete has been cured in accordance with Section 450, and the concrete compressive
 strength is equal to or greater than the specified 28 day compressive strength.
 455-7.3.2 Storage: Support piles on adequate dunnage both in the prestress yard
 and at the job site in accordance with the locations shown in the Standard Plans to minimize
 undue bending stresses or creating a sweep or camber in the pile.
 455-7.3.3 Handling: Handle and store piles in the manner necessary to eliminate
 the danger of fracture by impact or of undue bending stresses in handling or transporting the
 piles from the forms and into the leads. In general, lift concrete piles by means of a suitable
 bridge or slings attached to the pile at the locations shown in the Standard Plans. Construct slings
 used to handle piles of a fabric material or braided wire rope constructed of six or more wire
 ropes which will not mar the corners or the surface finish of the piles. Do not use chains to
 handle piles. During transport, support concrete piles at the lifting locations shown in the
 Standard Plans or fully support them throughout 80% or more of their length. In handling piles
 for use in salty or brackish water, exercise special care to avoid damaging the surface and
 corners of the pile. If an alternate transportation support arrangement is desired, submit
 calculations, signed and sealed by the Specialty Engineer, for approval by the Engineer prior to
 transporting the pile. Calculations must show that the pile can be transported without exceeding
 the bending moments calculated using the support locations shown in the Plans.
 455-7.4 Cracked Piles: The Engineer will reject any pile that becomes cracked in
 handling to the point that a transverse or longitudinal crack extends through the pile, shows
 failure of the concrete as indicated by spalling of concrete on the main body of the pile adjacent
 to the crack, which in the opinion of the Engineer will not withstand driving stresses, or becomes
 damaged during installation. The Engineer will not reject any pile for the occasional minor
 surface hairline cracking caused by shrinkage.
 Do not drive piling with irreparable damage, which is defined as any cracks that
 extend through the pile cross-sectional area that are, or will be, below ground or water level at
 the end of driving. Remove and replace broken piles or piles cracked to the extent described
 above at no expense to the Department. The Engineer will accept cracks less than 0.005 inches
 which do not extend through the pile. Using approved methods, cut off and splice or build-up to
 cut-off elevation piles with cracks greater than 0.005 inches at the pile head or above ground or
 water level, and piles with cracks above ground or water level which extend through the crosssectional area of the pile. The Engineer may require correction of pile damage or pile cracks by
 cutting down the concrete to the plane of sound concrete below the crack and rebuilding it to cutoff elevation, or the Engineer may reject the pile. Extract and replace rejected piles that cannot
 be repaired, at no expense to the Department.
 Take appropriate steps to prevent the occurrence of cracking, whether due to
 handling, transporting, or driving.
 455-7.5 Preparation for Transportation: Cut strands flush with the surface of the
 concrete using an abrasive cutting blade before transporting the piles from the casting yard.
 Cut and patch the metal lifting devices in accordance with 450-9.2.1.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 567
 
 455-7.6 Method of Driving: Unless otherwise directed, drive piles by a hammer or by
 means of a combination of water jets and hammer when jetting is allowed. When using jets in
 combination with a hammer, withdraw the jets and drive the pile by the hammer alone to secure
 final penetration and to rigidly fix the tip end of the pile. Keep jets in place if they are being used
 to continuously eliminate the soil resistance in the scour zone.
 455-7.7 Extensions and Build-ups Used to Increase Production Lengths:
 455-7.7.1 General: Where splices, extensions and build-ups for concrete piles are
 necessary, construct them in accordance with Standard Plans, Index 455-002.
 These requirements are not applicable to specially designed piling. Make
 splices for special pile designs as shown in the Plans.
 455-7.7.2 Extensions to be Driven or Those 21 feet or Longer: Construct
 extensions to be driven or extensions 21 feet or longer in length in accordance with the details
 shown in the Plans and in a manner including the requirements, sequences, and procedures
 outlined below:
 1. Cast a splice section in accordance with Section 450 with the dowel
 steel in the correct position and alignment.
 2. Drill dowel holes using an approved steel template that will position
 and align the drill bit during drilling. Drill holes a minimum of 2 inches deeper than the length of
 the dowel to be inserted.
 3. Clean the drilled dowel holes by inserting a high pressure air hose to the
 bottom of the hole and blowing the hole clean from the bottom upward. Eliminate any oil, dust,
 water, and other deleterious materials from the holes and the concrete surfaces to be joined.
 4. Place forms around joints between the pile sections.
 5. Mix the adhesive components in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 directions. Do not mix sand or any other filler material with the epoxy components unless it is
 prepackaged by the manufacturer for this specific purpose. Use adhesives meeting the
 requirements of Section 926 for Type AB epoxy compounds.
 6. After ensuring that all concrete surfaces are dry, fill the dowel holes
 with the adhesive material.
 7. Insert the dowels of the spliced section into the adhesive filled holes of
 the bottom section and position the spliced section so that the axes of the two sections are in
 concentric alignment and the ends of the abutting sections are spaced 1/2 inches apart. The
 Contractor may use small steel spacers of the required thickness provided they have 3 inches or
 more of cover after completing the splice. Fill the space between the abutting sections
 completely with the adhesive.
 8. Secure the spliced sections in alignment until the adhesive is cured in
 accordance with the manufacturer’s directions for the time appropriate with the prevailing
 ambient temperatures. Do not utilize the crane to secure the pile extension during the adhesive
 cure time. Utilize alignment braces to maintain the proper pile alignment during the epoxy cure
 time.
 9. After curing is completed, remove alignment braces and forms and
 clean and dress the spliced area to match the pile dimensions.
 When dowel splices need to be driven, assist the Engineer in performing dynamic
 instrumentation during the driving of each dowel spliced pile to monitor and control the stresses
 and verify the splicing integrity. Replace any damaged pile splices in accordance with 455-3.
 Provide the Engineer 48 hours advance notification prior to driving spliced piles.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 568
 
 455-7.7.3 Precast Reinforced Non-Drivable Build-ups less than 21 feet:
 Construct precast reinforced non-drivable build-ups less than 21 feet in accordance with the
 requirements of this Subarticle, Section 346, and Section 400. Provide the same material for the
 form surfaces for precast build-ups as was used to form the prestressed piles. Use concrete of the
 same mix as used in the prestressed pile and dimension the cross-section the same as piling being
 built up. Install build-ups as specified in 455-7.7.2(2) through 455-7.7.2(9). Apply to the buildups the same surface treatment or sealant applied to the prestressed piles.
 455-7.8 Pre-Planned Splices: Construct splices in accordance with the dowel splice
 method contained in the Standard Plans Indexes or using proprietary splices which are listed on
 the Department’s Approved Product List (APL). Splice test piles in the same manner as the
 production piles. Include in the pile installation plan, the chosen method of splicing and the
 approximate locations of the splice. Generally, place the splice at approximately the midpoint
 between the estimated pile tip and the ground surface, considering scour if applicable. Stagger
 the splice location between adjacent piles by a minimum of 10 feet. Obtain the Engineer’s
 approval prior to constructing any pile sections. Construct piles which are to be spliced using the
 dowel splice with preformed dowel holes in the bottom section and embedded dowels in the
 upper section.
 When dowel splices need to be driven, assist the Engineer in performing dynamic
 instrumentation during the driving of each dowel spliced pile to monitor and control the stresses
 and verify the splicing integrity. Replace any damaged pile splices in accordance with 455-3.
 Provide the Engineer 48 hours advance notification prior to driving spliced piles.
 Mechanical pile splices must be capable of developing the following capacities in
 the pile section unless shown otherwise in the Plans and capable of being installed without
 damage to the pile or splice:
 1. Compressive strength = (Pile Cross sectional area) x (28 day concrete
 strength)
 2. Tensile Strength = (Pile Cross sectional area) x 900 psi
 Pile Size (inches)

 455-7.9 Pile Cut-offs: After the completion of driving, cut piles off which extend above
 the cut-off elevation with an abrasive saw. Make the cut the depth necessary to cleanly cut
 through the prestressed strands. Take ownership and dispose of cut-off sections not used
 elsewhere as allowed by this Section.
 455-8 Steel Piling.
 455-8.1 Description: Furnish, splice, drive, and cut off structural steel shapes to form
 bearing piles. Include in this work the installation of structural steel bracing by bolting or
 welding, construction of splices and the filling of pipe piles with the specified materials specified
 in 455-8.9.
 455-8.2 Material: For the material in steel piles, pile bracing, scabs, wedges, and splices,
 meet the requirements of Section 962.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 569
 
 455-8.3 Pile Splices: Order and use the full authorized pile length where practicable. Do
 not splice to obtain authorized lengths less than 40 feet except when shown in the Plans. Locate
 all splices in the authorized pile length in portions of the pile expected to be at least 15 feet
 below the final ground surface after driving. When it is not practicable to provide authorized pile
 lengths longer than 40 feet in a single length, use no more than one field splice per additional
 40 feet of authorized pile length. Shop splices may be used to join single lengths of pile which
 are at least 20 feet in length. One shorter segment of pile may be used to achieve the authorized
 pile length when needed.
 Where the pile length authorized is not sufficient to obtain the required bearing
 value or penetration, order an additional length of pile and splice it to the original length.
 Make all splices in accordance with details shown in the Plans and in compliance
 with the general requirements of AWS D1.1 or American Petroleum Institute Specification
 5L (API 5L).
 455-8.4 Welding: Make all welded connections to steel piles by electric arc welding, in
 accordance with details shown in the Plans and in compliance with the general requirements of
 AWS D1.5. Electroslag welding is not permitted. Welds will be inspected by visual methods.
 455-8.5 Pile Heads and Tips: Cut off all piles at the elevation shown in the Plans. If
 using a cutting torch, make the surface as smooth as practical.
 Where foundation material is so dense that the Contractor cannot drive the pile to
 the required penetration and firmly seat it without danger of crumpling the tip, reinforce the tips
 with approved cast steel point protectors, as shown in the Plans or required by the Engineer.
 Construct point protectors in one piece of cast steel meeting the requirements of ASTM A27,
 Grade 65-35 heat treated to provide full bearing for the piles. Attach points by welding according
 to the recommendations of the manufacturer.
 455-8.6 Pile Bent Bracing Members: Place structural steel sway and cross bracing, and
 all other steel tie bracing, on steel pile bents and bolt or weld in place as indicated in the Plans.
 Where piles are not driven into position in exact alignment as shown in the Plans, the Engineer
 may require the use of fills and shims between the bracing and the flanges of the pile. Furnish
 and place all fills and shims required to square and line up faces of flanges for cross bracing at
 no additional expense to the Department.

 455-9 Sheet Piling.
 455-9.1 Description: Leave permanent piling in place as part of the finished work and
 remove temporary piling after each construction phase unless otherwise authorized by the
 Engineer.
 455-9.2 Materials: Meet the following requirements:
 Concrete .............................................................Section 346
 Bar Reinforcement .............................................Section 931
 Prestressing Reinforcement................................Section 933
 Steel Sheet Piles* ...............................................Section 962
 *For temporary steel sheet piles meet the requirements specified in the Plans.
 455-9.3 Steel Sheet Piling: Drive steel sheet piling and cut off true to line and grade.
 Install steel sheet piling with a suitable hammer. Remove and replace any section damaged
 during handling and installation at no additional expense to the Department.
 455-9.3.1 Method of Installation: Where rock or strong material is encountered
 such that the sheet piles cannot be set to grade by driving, remove the strong material by other
 acceptable means, such as excavation and backfilling, drilling or by punching. When the Plans
 do not indicate the existence of rock or strong material, work of removing, drilling or punching
 the strong material or rock will be paid for as Unforeseeable Work.
 455-9.4 Concrete Sheet Piling:
 455-9.4.1 Description: Ensure that concrete sheet piling is of prestressed concrete
 construction and manufactured, cured, and installed in accordance with the requirements of the
 Contract Documents.
 455-9.4.2 Manufacture of Piles: Ensure that the piles are fabricated in
 accordance with Section 450.
 455-9.4.3 Method of Installation: Jet concrete sheet piling to grade where
 practical. The Engineer will require a minimum of two jets. Provide water at the nozzles of
 sufficient volume and pressure to freely erode material adjacent to the piles. Where encountering
 rock or strong material, such that the sheet piles cannot be set to grade by jetting, remove the
 strong materials by other acceptable means, such as excavation and backfilling, drilling or by
 punching with a suitable punch. When the Plans do not indicate the existence of rock or strong
 material and the piles cannot be set by jetting, the Department will pay for the work of removing,
 drilling or punching the strong material or rock as Unforeseeable Work.
 455-9.4.4 Grouting and Caulking: Concrete sheet piles are generally detailed to
 have tongues and grooves on their lower ends, and double grooves on their upper ends. Where so
 detailed, after installation, clean the grooves of all sand, mud, or debris, and fully grout the
 grooves. Use approved plastic bags (sheaths) which will meet the shape and length of the groove
 to be grouted to contain the plastic grout within the double grooves. Provide grout composed of
 one part cement and two parts sand. Use clean A-3 sand or sand meeting the requirements of
 Section 902 in this grout. In lieu of sand-cement grout, the Contractor may use concrete meeting
 the requirements of Section 347, using small gravel or crushed stone coarse aggregate. Deposit
 the grout through a grout pipe placed within a watertight plastic sheath (bag) extending the full
 depth of the double grooves and which, when filled, completely fills the slot formed by the
 double grooves.
 455-9.5 Storage and Handling: Handle and store all sheet piles in a manner to prevent
 damage. Handle long sheet piles with fabric slings or braided wire rope constructed of six or
 more wire ropes placed at appropriate lift points to prevent damage due to excessive bending.

 The Engineer will evaluate the DSIP for conformance with the Contract
 Documents. Within 20 days after receipt of the plan, the Engineer will notify the Contractor of
 any additional information required and/or changes that may be necessary in the opinion of the
 Engineer to satisfy the Contract Documents. The Engineer will reject any part of the plan that is
 unacceptable. Submit changes agreed upon for reevaluation. The Engineer will notify the
 Contractor within seven days after receipt of proposed changes of their acceptance or rejection.
 All equipment and procedures are subject to trial and satisfactory performance in the field.
 Acceptance by the Engineer does not relieve the Contractor of the
 responsibility to perform the work in accordance with the Contract Documents. The installation
 plan is for the Contractor to explain the approach to the work and allow the Engineer an
 opportunity to comment on the equipment and procedures chosen before field operations begin.
 The Engineers acceptance is not a guarantee that the chosen methods and equipment are capable
 of obtaining the required results, this responsibility lies with the Contractor.
 455-15.1.3 General Methods & Equipment: Perform the excavations required
 for the shafts, through whatever materials encountered, to the dimensions and elevations shown
 in the Contract Documents, using methods and equipment suitable for the intended purpose and
 the materials encountered. Provide drilling tools with a diameter not smaller than one inch of the
 shaft diameter required in the Plans. Provide equipment capable of constructing shafts supporting
 bridges to a depth equal to the deepest shaft shown in the Plans plus 15 foot or plus three times
 the shaft diameter, whichever is greater, except when the Plans require equipment capable of
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 578
 
 constructing shafts to a deeper depth. Provide equipment capable of constructing shafts
 supporting non-bridge structures, including sign, signal, lighting and ITS structures, to a depth
 equal to the deepest shaft shown in the Plans plus 5 feet.
 Construct drilled shafts according to the Contract Documents using
 generally either the dry method, wet method, casing method, or permanent casing method as
 necessary to produce sound, durable concrete foundation shafts free of defects. Use the
 permanent casing method only when required by the Plans or authorized by the Engineer. When
 the Plans describe a particular method of construction, use this method except when permitted
 otherwise by the Engineer, after field trial. When the Plans do not describe a particular method,
 propose a method on the basis of its suitability to the site conditions and submit it for approval
 by the Engineer.
 Set a suitable temporary removable surface casing from at least 1 foot
 above the ground surface to at least 1-1/2 shaft diameters below the ground surface to prevent
 caving of the surface soils and to aid in maintaining shaft position and alignment. Do not use a
 temporary casing larger than 12 inches of the shaft diameter. Fill the oversized temporary casing
 with drilled shaft concrete at no additional expense to the Department. Withdraw the surface
 casing after concrete placement. The Engineer may require predrilling with slurry and/or
 overreaming to the outside diameter of the casing to install the surface casing at some sites.
 For drilled shafts installed to support sign, signal, lighting and ITS
 structures, provide temporary surface casings from at least 1 foot above the ground surface to at
 least 5 feet below the ground surface. For sign, signal, lighting and ITS structure foundations
 located within permanent sidewalks or within 5 feet of curb sections, provide temporary surface
 casings from no lower than the top of sidewalk to at least 5 feet below the ground surface.
 For drilled shafts installed to support sign, signal, lighting and ITS
 structures, do not attempt to excavate the shaft using plain water or natural slurry. Do not attempt
 to excavate the shaft using dry construction method unless specifically indicated in the Plans or
 approved by the Engineer.
 455-15.2 Dry Construction Method: Use the dry construction method only at sites
 where the ground water table and soil conditions, generally stiff to hard clays or rock above the
 water table, make it feasible to construct the shaft in a relatively dry excavation and where the
 sides and bottom of the shaft are stable and may be visually inspected by the Engineer prior to
 placing the concrete.
 In applying the dry construction method, drill the shaft excavation, remove
 accumulated seepage water and loose material from the excavation and place the shaft concrete
 in a relatively dry excavation.
 Use the dry construction method only when shaft excavations, as demonstrated in
 a test hole, have 12 inches or less of seepage water accumulated over a four hour period, the
 sides and bottom remain stable without detrimental caving, sloughing, or swelling for a four hour
 period, and the loose material and water can be satisfactorily removed prior to inspection and
 prior to placing concrete. Use the wet construction method or the temporary casing construction
 method for shafts that do not meet the requirements for the dry construction method.
 455-15.3 Wet Construction Method: Use the wet construction method at all sites where
 it is impractical to provide a dry excavation for placement of the shaft concrete.
 The wet construction method consists of keeping the shaft excavation filled with
 fluid (mineral slurry, polymer slurry, natural slurry or water), desanding and cleaning the slurry
 and final cleaning of the excavation by means of a bailing bucket, air lift, submersible pump or
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 579
 
 other approved devices and placing the shaft concrete (with a tremie or concrete pump extending
 to the shaft bottom) which displaces the water or slurry during concreting of the shaft excavation.
 Where drilled shafts are located in open water areas, construct the shafts by the
 wet method using exterior casings extending from above the water elevation into the ground to
 protect the shaft concrete from water action during placement and curing of the concrete. Install
 the exterior casing in a manner that will produce a positive seal at the bottom of the casing so
 that there is no intrusion or extrusion of water or other materials into or from the shaft
 excavation.
 455-15.4 Temporary Casing Construction Method: Use the temporary casing method
 at all sites where it is inappropriate to use the dry or wet construction methods without the use of
 temporary casings other than surface casings. In this method, the casing is advanced prior to
 excavation and withdrawn after concrete placement. When a formation is reached that is nearly
 impervious, seal in the nearly impervious formation. Proceed with drilling as with the wet
 method to the projected depth. Proceed with the placement of the concrete as with the dry
 method. In the event seepage conditions prevent use of the dry method, complete the excavation
 and concrete placement using wet methods.
 Where drilling through materials having a tendency to cave, advance the
 excavation by drilling in a mineral or polymer slurry. In the event that a caving layer or layers
 are encountered that cannot be controlled by slurry, install temporary removable casing through
 such caving layer or layers. The Engineer may require overreaming to the outside diameter of the
 casing. Take whatever steps are required to prevent caving during shaft excavation including
 installation of deeper casings. If electing to remove a casing and replace it with a longer casing
 through caving soils, backfill the excavation. The Contractor may use soil previously excavated
 or soil from the site to backfill the excavation. The Contractor may use other approved methods
 which will control the size of the excavation and protect the integrity of the foundation soils to
 excavate through caving layers.
 Before withdrawing the casing, ensure that the level of fresh concrete is at such a
 level that the fluid trapped behind the casing is displaced upward. As the casing is withdrawn,
 maintain the level of concrete within the casing so that fluid trapped behind the casing is
 displaced upward out of the shaft excavation without mixing with or displacing the shaft
 concrete.
 The Contractor may use the casing method, when approved by the Engineer, to
 construct shafts through weak caving soils that do not contribute significant shaft shear
 resistance. In this case, place a temporary casing through the weak caving soils before beginning
 excavation. Conduct excavation using the dry construction method where appropriate for site
 conditions and the wet construction method where the dry construction method is not
 appropriate. Withdraw the temporary casing during the concreting operations unless the Engineer
 approves otherwise.
 455-15.5 Permanent Casing Construction Method: Use the permanent casing method
 when required by the Plans. In this method, place a casing to the prescribed depth before
 beginning excavation. If the Contractor cannot attain full penetration, the Engineer may direct
 the Contractor to excavate through the casing and advance the casing until reaching the desired
 penetration. In some cases the Engineer may require the Contractor to overream to the outside
 diameter of the casing before placing the casing.

 Construct the shaft in accordance with 455-15.4 except for cutting the casing off
 at the prescribed elevation upon reaching the proper construction sequence and leaving the
 remainder of the casing in place.
 455-15.5.1 Temporary Extension of Permanent Casing: When the wet method
 does not provide enough support to excavate and clean the drilled shaft extension below the
 permanent casing tip elevations shown in the Plans, the permanent casing may be temporarily
 extended to an elevation deeper than the tip elevation at no additional expense to the Department.
 The rock socket length must be extended as specified in 455-15.7 and the casing raised to the
 original casing tip elevation shown in the Plans after the concrete placement. Include details of
 this procedure in the DSIP for the Engineer’s review and approval.
 455-15.5.2 Temporary Casing to Stabilize Excavation below Permanent
 Casing: To stabilize the excavation below the permanent casing tip elevation, a temporary
 casing inside an oversized permanent casing may be used at no additional expense to the
 Department. The permanent casing must have an inside diameter no more than 6 inches larger
 than the drilled shaft diameter specified in the Plans.
 The following requirements apply:
 1. Excavate and clean the materials from inside the permanent
 casing. Ensure all materials are removed from the inside wall of the permanent casing.
 2. Install the temporary casing prior to excavating below the
 permanent casing tip elevation. The temporary casing must have a minimum internal diameter
 equal to the shaft diameter required in the Plans.
 3. If the temporary casing is advanced deeper than the minimum
 top of rock socket elevation as shown in the Plans, or the top of rock elevation if deeper, extend
 the rock socket length in accordance with 455-15.7.
 4. Place concrete in accordance with 455-15.9.3 through the
 temporary casing. Do not allow concrete to fall or overflow into the annular space between the
 temporary and permanent casing.
 5. After placement of the concrete, remove the temporary casing in
 accordance with 455-15.4, 455-15.7 and 455-17. During withdrawal of the temporary casing,
 maintain adequate concrete head in both the temporary and permanent casings to avoid
 breaching, caving, or contamination of the concrete.
 Include details of this procedure in the DSIP for the Engineer’s review and
 approval.
 455-15.6 Excavations: When pilot holes and/or load tests are performed, the Engineer
 will use the pilot hole and/or load test results to determine the authorized tip elevations and/or
 the authorized installation criteria of the drilled shafts. Drilled shaft construction shall not begin
 until pilot hole and/or load test reports are approved by the Engineer. Shaft tip elevations based
 on pilot hole results and/or load tests may vary from the tip elevations presented in the Plans.
 Extend drilled shaft excavations deeper by extra depth excavation when the Engineer determines
 the material encountered while drilling the shaft excavation is unsuitable and/or is not the same
 as anticipated in the design of the drilled shaft. In the absence of suitable strength tests or load
 tests to evaluate materials excavated, construct the shafts no higher than the tip elevations shown
 in the Plans.
 455-15.6.1 Pilot Hole: When pilot holes are shown in the Plans core a pilot hole,
 prior to shaft excavation, in accordance with ASTM D2113 Standard Practice for Rock Core
 Drilling and Sampling of Rock for Site Excavation and the Department’s Soils & Foundations

 Handbook using a double or triple wall core barrel through part or all of the shaft, to a depth of
 3 times the diameter of the drilled shaft below the tip elevation shown in the Plans, as directed by
 the Engineer. The Engineer may require the Contractor to cut any core to a total depth below the
 bottom of the drilled shaft excavation of up to 5 times the diameter of the drilled shaft.
 455-15.6.2 Cores: Take cores when shown in the Plans or directed by the
 Engineer to determine the character of the material directly below the shaft excavation. Provide
 equipment to retrieve the core from a depth of 5 times the diameter of the drilled shaft below the
 bottom of the drilled shaft excavation in accordance with ASTM D2113 Standard Practice for
 Rock Core Drilling and Sampling of Rock for Site Excavation. Cut the cores with an approved
 core barrel to a minimum depth of 3 times the diameter of the drilled shaft below the bottom of
 the drilled shaft excavation after completing the shaft excavation, as directed by the Engineer.
 The Engineer may require the Contractor to cut any core to a total depth below the bottom of the
 drilled shaft excavation of up to 5 times the diameter of the drilled shaft.
 For cores or pilot holes, use only a double or triple wall core barrel
 designed:
 1. to cut a core sample from 4 inches to 6 inches in diameter, at
 least 5 feet in length, and,
 2. so that the sample of material cored can be removed from the
 shaft excavation and the core barrel in an undisturbed state.
 The Engineer will inspect the cores and determine the depth of required
 excavation. When considered necessary by the Engineer, take additional cores. Place the core
 samples in suitable containers, identified by shaft location, elevation from and to, and job
 number, and deliver to the Department within 48 hours after cutting. When called for in the
 Plans, substitute Standard Penetration Tests (SPT) for coring. In such cases, supply these tests at
 no additional cost per foot to the Department above that bid for core (shaft excavation).
 Provide areas for the disposal of unsuitable materials and excess materials
 as defined in 120-5 that are removed from shaft excavations, and dispose of them in a manner
 meeting all environmental requirements.
 Furnish the additional drilled shaft concrete over the theoretical amount
 required to complete filling any excavations for shafts which are larger than required by the
 Plans or authorized by the Engineer, at no expense to the Department.
 455-15.7 Casings: Ensure that casings are metal, of ample strength to withstand handling
 and driving stresses and the pressure of concrete and of the surrounding earth materials, and that
 they are smooth and water tight. Ensure that the inside diameter of casing is not less than the
 specified size of shaft except as provided below. The Department will not allow extra
 compensation for concrete required to fill an oversize casing or oversize excavation.
 The Engineer will allow the Contractor to supply casing with an outside diameter
 equal to the specified shaft diameter (O.D. casing) provided additional shaft length is supplied at
 the shaft tip. Determine the additional length of shaft required by the following relationship:
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 582
 
 Additional Length =
 where:
 
 ( D1 - D 2 ) L
 D2
 
 D 1 = casing inside diameter specified = shaft diameter specified
 D 2 = casing inside diameter provided (D 2 = D 1 minus twice the wall
 thickness).
 L= authorized shaft length below ground for temporary casing methods or
 below casing for permanent casing methods.
 
 Bear all costs relating to this additional length including but not limited to the cost
 of extra excavation, extra concrete, and extra reinforcing steel.
 Install and remove casing by rotating, exerting downward pressure, or with a
 vibratory hammer, unless otherwise shown in the Contract Documents. Remove all casings from
 shaft excavations except those used for the Permanent Casing Method. Ensure that the portion of
 casings installed under the Permanent Casing Method of construction below the shaft cut-off
 elevation remains in position as a permanent part of the drilled shaft. The Contractor may leave
 casings if in the opinion of the Engineer the casings will not adversely affect the shaft capacity in
 place. When casings that are to be removed become bound in the shaft excavation and cannot be
 practically removed, drill the shaft excavation deeper as directed by the Engineer to compensate
 for loss of capacity due to the presence of the casing. The Department will not compensate for
 the casing remaining. The Department will pay for the additional length of shaft under Pay Item
 No. 455-88.
 If temporary casing is advanced deeper than the minimum top of rock socket
 elevation shown in the Plans or actual top of rock elevation if deeper, withdraw the casing from
 the rock socket and overream the shaft. If the temporary casing cannot be withdrawn from the
 rock socket before final cleaning, extend the length of rock socket below the authorized tip
 elevation one-half of the distance between the minimum top of rock socket elevation or actual
 elevation if deeper, and the temporary casing tip elevation.
 Form drilled shafts extending through a body of water with permanent casings.
 When the shaft extends above ground or a body of water, the Contractor may form the exposed
 portion with removable casing, unless otherwise specified in the Plans. Remove the portion of
 metal casings between an elevation 2 feet below the lowest water elevation or 2 feet below
 ground whichever is higher and the top of shaft elevation after the concrete is cured. Remove
 casings to expose the concrete as required above in a manner which will not damage the drilled
 shaft concrete. Dismantle removable casings in accordance with the provisions of 455-17.5.
 When practical, do not start casing removal until completing all concrete
 placement in the shaft. Extract casing at a slow, uniform rate with the pull in line with the axis of
 the shaft. Withdraw temporary casings while the concrete remains fluid.
 When conditions warrant, the Contractor may pull the casing in partial stages.
 Maintain a sufficient head of concrete above the bottom of the casing to overcome the
 hydrostatic pressure of water outside the casing. At all times maintain the elevation of the
 concrete in the casing high enough to displace the drilling slurry between the outside of the
 casing and the edge of the hole while removing the casing.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 583
 
 The Contractor may use special casing systems in open water areas, when
 approved, which are designed to permit removal after the concrete has hardened. Design special
 casings so that no damage occurs to the drilled shaft concrete during their removal.
 Expandable or split casings that are removable are not permitted for use below
 water.
 455-15.8 Slurry and Fluid in Excavation at Time of Concrete Placement:
 455-15.8.1 General: Thoroughly premix the slurry with clean fresh water prior to
 introduction into the shaft excavation. Introduce slurry before the excavation advances below the
 bottom of the casing. Ensure that the percentage of polymer or mineral admixture used to make
 the suspension is such as to maintain the stability of the shaft excavation. The Engineer will
 require adequate water and/or slurry tanks when necessary to perform the work in accordance
 with this Section. The Engineer will not allow excavated pits on projects requiring slurry tanks
 without the written permission of the Engineer. Take the steps necessary to prevent the slurry
 from “setting up” in the shaft; including, but not limited, to agitation, circulation, and adjusting
 the composition and properties of the slurry. Provide suitable offsite disposal areas and dispose
 of all waste slurry in a manner meeting all requirements pertaining to pollution.
 Provide a CTQP qualified drilled shaft inspector to perform control tests
 using suitable apparatus on the slurry mixture to determine the slurry and fluid properties as
 specified in 455-15.8.2 to 455-15.8.4.
 Measure the viscosity of the freshly mixed slurry regularly as a check on
 the quality of the slurry being formed using an approved measuring device.
 Perform tests from the fluid in the excavation to determine density,
 viscosity, and pH value to establish a consistent working pattern, taking into account the mixing
 process and blending of freshly mixed slurry and previously used slurry. Perform a set of tests to
 determine density, viscosity, and pH value at intervals not exceeding 2 hours during the first
 8 hours slurry is in use and one set every 4 hours thereafter. Perform one set of tests when the
 excavation reaches the midpoint.
 The Department may perform comparison tests as determined necessary
 during the mineral and polymer slurry operations.
 If, at any time in the opinion of the Engineer, the wet construction method
 of stabilizing excavations fails to produce the desired final result, discontinue this method of
 construction, propose and submit modifications in procedure or alternate means of construction
 for approval.
 455-15.8.2 Mineral Slurry: When mineral slurry is used in an excavation, use
 only processed attapulgite or bentonite clays with up to 2% (by dry weight) of added polymer.
 Use mineral slurry having a mineral grain size such that it will remain in suspension and having
 sufficient viscosity and gel characteristics to transport excavated material to a suitable screening
 system. Use a percentage and specific gravity of the material to make the suspension sufficient to
 maintain the stability of the excavation and to allow proper placement of concrete. Ensure that
 the material used to make the slurry is not detrimental to concrete or surrounding ground strata.
 During construction, maintain the level of the slurry at a height sufficient to prevent caving of
 the hole. In the event of a sudden significant loss of slurry such that the slurry level cannot
 practically be maintained by adding slurry to the hole, backfill the excavation and delay the
 construction of that foundation until an alternate construction procedure has been approved.
 Perform the following tests on the mineral slurry supplied to and in the
 shaft excavation and ensure that the results are within the ranges stated in the table below:

 The Contractor may adjust the limits in the above table when field
 conditions warrant as successfully demonstrated in a test hole or with other methods approved by
 the Engineer. The Engineer must approve all changes in writing before the Contractor can
 continue to use them.
 During construction, maintain the level of mineral slurry in the shaft
 excavation within the excavation and at a level not less than 4 feet above the highest expected
 piezometric water pressure along the depth of a shaft.
 455-15.8.3 Polymer Slurry: Materials manufactured expressly for use as
 polymer slurry for drilled shafts that meet the requirements of this Section may be used as slurry
 for drilled shaft excavations. A representative of the manufacturer must be on-site or available
 for immediate contact to assist and guide the construction of the first three drilled shafts at no
 additional cost to the Department. This representative must also be available for on-site
 assistance or immediate contact if problems are encountered during the construction of the
 remaining drilled shafts as determined by the Engineer. Use polymer slurry only if the soils
 below the casing are not classified as organic, and the pH of the fluid in the hole can be
 maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s published recommendations. Submit the SDS
 for the product, the manufacturer’s published mixing procedures, and the manufacturer’s
 published range of values for pH and viscosity of the mixed slurry. Submit a report in
 accordance with Section 2.4, Volume II of the Department’s Material Manual, which may be
 viewed at the following URL:
 http://www.fdot.gov/programmanagement/Implemented/URLinSpecs/Files/Section24VII100517.pdf .
 The report must include test results, certification and documentation that demonstrate the
 polymer slurry and additives meet the following requirements:
 1. The polymer slurries to be used on the project and their waste products
 are classified as non-hazardous as defined by Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
 Subpart C rules, Table 1 of 40 CFR 261.24 Toxicity Characteristic.
 2. Pull out tests demonstrate the bond between the bar reinforcement and
 the concrete is not materially affected by exposure to the slurry under typical construction
 conditions, over the typical range of slurry viscosities to be used.
 3. Load tests demonstrate the bond between the concrete and the soil is not
 materially affected by exposure to the polymer slurry under typical construction conditions, over
 the typical range of polymer slurry viscosities to be used.

 455-15.8.4 Fluid In Excavation At Time Of Concrete Placement: When any
 fluid is present in any drilled shaft excavation, including shafts to support sign, signal, lighting
 and ITS structures, the applicable test methods and reporting requirements described in
 455-15.8.1, 455-15.8.2 and 455-15.8.3 apply to tests of fluid in the shaft prior to placing the
 concrete.
 Test samples of the fluid in the shaft from within 1 inch of the base of the
 shaft and from the middle of the shaft height for shafts up to 60 feet in depth. Test samples of the
 fluid in the shaft from within 1 inch of the base of the shaft and at intervals not exceeding 30 feet
 up the shaft for shafts deeper than 60 feet. Use a sampling tool, approved by the Engineer,
 designed to sample over a depth range of 12 inches or less. Take whatever action is necessary
 prior to placing the concrete to bring the fluid within the specification and reporting
 requirements, outlined in the tables in 455-15.8.2 and 455-15.8.3, except as follows:
 The Engineer will not require tests for pH or viscosity, nor require the
 fluid to meet the minimum density specified in 455-15.8.2 and 455-15.8.3 when neither polymer
 nor mineral slurry has been introduced into the shaft excavation.
 455-15.9 Tremies and Pumps:
 455-15.9.1 General: The requirements of the applicable provisions of
 Section 400 will apply when using a tremie or a pump to place drilled shaft concrete.
 455-15.9.2 Dry Excavations: Ensure that the tremie for depositing concrete in a
 dry drilled shaft excavation consists of a tube of solid construction, a tube constructed of sections
 which can be added and removed, or a tube of other approved design. The Contractor may pass
 concrete through a hopper at the top of the tube or through side openings as the tremie is
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 586
 
 retrieved during concrete placement. Support the tremie so that the free fall of the concrete is less
 than 5 feet at all times. If the free falling concrete causes the shaft excavation to cave or slough,
 control the movement of concrete by reducing the height of free fall of the concrete and/or
 reducing the rate of flow of concrete into the excavation.
 455-15.9.3 Wet Excavations: Construct the tremie or pump line used to deposit
 concrete beneath the surface of water so that it is water-tight and will readily discharge concrete.
 Construct the discharge end of the tremie or pump line to prevent water intrusion and permit the
 free flow of concrete during placement operations. Ensure that the tremie or pump line has
 sufficient length and weight to rest on the shaft bottom before starting concrete placement.
 During placement operations, ensure that the discharge end of the tremie
 or pump line is within 6 inches of the bottom of the shaft excavation until at least 10 feet of
 concrete has been placed. Ensure the discharge end of the tremie or pump line is continuously
 embedded at least 10 feet into the concrete after 10 feet of concrete has been placed and until the
 casing is overpoured sufficiently to eliminate all contaminated concrete. Ensure that the free fall
 of concrete into the hopper is less than 5 feet at all times. Support the tremie so that it can be
 raised to increase the discharge of concrete and lowered to reduce the discharge of concrete. Do
 not rapidly raise or lower the tremie to increase the discharge of the concrete. Maintain a
 continuous flow of concrete and a positive pressure differential of the concrete in the tremie or
 pump line at all times to prevent water or slurry intrusion into the shaft concrete.
 455-15.10 Excavation and Drilling Equipment:
 455-15.10.1 General: All shaft excavation is unclassified shaft excavation. The
 Engineer will require drilled shaft sidewall overreaming when inspections show it to be
 necessary. These terms are defined in 455-15.10.2, 455-15.10.3, and 455-15.10.4, respectively.
 Use excavation and drilling equipment having adequate capacity,
 including power, torque, and crowd (downthrust), and excavation and overreaming tools of
 adequate design, size, and strength to perform the work shown in the Plans or described herein.
 When the material encountered cannot be drilled using conventional earth augers and/or
 underreaming tools, provide special drilling equipment, including but not limited to rock augers,
 core barrels, rock tools, air tools, blasting materials, and other equipment as necessary to
 continue the shaft excavation to the size and depth required. In the event blasting is necessary,
 obtain all necessary permits. The Contractor is responsible for the effects of blasting on already
 completed work and adjacent structures. The Engineer must approve all blasting.
 455-15.10.2 Unclassified Shaft Excavation: Unclassified shaft excavation is
 defined as all processes required to excavate a drilled shaft of the dimensions shown in the
 Contract Documents to the depth indicated in the Plans plus 15 feet or plus 3 shaft diameters,
 whichever is deeper, completed and accepted. Include in the work all shaft excavation, whether
 the material encountered is soil, rock, weathered rock, stone, natural or man-made obstructions,
 or materials of other descriptions.
 455-15.10.3 Unclassified Extra Depth Excavation: Unclassified extra depth
 excavation is defined as all processes required to excavate a drilled shaft of plan dimensions
 which is deeper than the limits defined as unclassified shaft excavation.
 455-15.10.4 Drilled Shaft Sidewall Overreaming: Drilled shaft sidewall
 overreaming is defined as the unclassified excavation required to roughen its surface or to
 enlarge the drilled shaft diameter due to softening of the sidewalls or to remove excessive
 buildup of slurry cake when slurry is used. Increase the shaft radius a minimum of 1/2 inch and a
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 587
 
 maximum of 3 inches by overreaming. The Contractor may accomplish overreaming with a
 grooving tool, overreaming bucket, or other approved equipment.
 Meet the limit for depth of sidewall overreaming into the shaft sidewall
 material and the elevation limits between which sidewall overreaming is required.
 455-15.11 Inspection of Excavations:
 455-15.11.1 Dimensions and Alignment: Provide equipment for checking the
 dimensions and alignment of each permanent shaft excavation. Determine the dimensions and
 alignment of the shaft excavation under the observation and direction of the Department.
 Generally check the alignment and dimensions by any of the following methods as necessary:
 1. Check the dimensions and alignment of dry shaft excavations using
 reference stakes and a plumb bob.
 2. Check the dimensions and alignment of casing when inserted in the
 excavation.
 3. Insert a casing in shaft excavations temporarily for alignment and
 dimension checks.
 4. Insert a rigid rod or pipe assembly with several 90 degree offsets equal
 to the shaft diameter into the shaft excavation for alignment and dimension checks.
 Insert any casing, rod or pipe assembly, or other device used to check
 dimensions and alignment into the excavation to full depth.
 455-15.11.2 Depth: Generally reference the depth of the shaft during drilling to
 appropriate marks on the Kelly bar or other suitable methods. Measure final shaft depths with a
 suitable weighted tape or other approved methods after final cleaning.
 455-15.11.3 Shaft Inspection Device (SID): When shown in the Plans, furnish
 all power and equipment necessary for the Engineer to inspect the bottom conditions of a drilled
 shaft excavation and to measure the thickness of bottom sediment or any other debris using a
 SID. Provide a means to position and lower the SID into the shaft excavation to enable the bell
 housing to rest vertically on the bottom of the excavation. Include all cost related to the
 inspection device in the cost of drilled shaft items.
 Furnish a SID meeting the following requirements:
 1. A remotely operated, high resolution, color video camera sealed
 inside a watertight bell housing.
 2. Provides a clear view of the bottom inspection on a video
 monitor at the surface in real time.
 3. Provides a permanent record of the entire inspection with voice
 annotation on a quality DVD with a resolution of not less than 720 x 480.
 4. Provides a minimum field of vision of 110 square inches, with at
 least two graduated measuring devices to record the depth of sediment on the bottom of the shaft
 excavation to a minimum accuracy of 1/2 inch and a length greater than 1-1/2 inches.
 5. Provides sufficient lighting to illuminate the entire field of
 vision at the bottom of the shaft in order for the operator and inspector to clearly see the depth
 measurement scale on the video monitor and to produce a clear recording of the inspection.
 6. Provides a compressed air or gas system to displace drilling
 fluids from the bell housing and a pressurized water system to assist in determination of bottom
 sedimentation depth

 588
 
 Obtain the Engineer’s approval of the device in advance of the first
 inspection contingent on satisfactory field performance. Notify the Engineer for approval before
 a different device is used for any subsequent inspection.
 455-15.11.4 Shaft Cleanliness Requirements: Adjust cleaning operations so a
 minimum of 50% of the bottom of each shaft will have less than 1/2 inches of sediment at the
 time of placement of the concrete. Ensure the maximum depth of sedimentary deposits or any
 other debris at any place on the bottom of the shaft excavation does not exceed 1-1/2 inches. The
 Engineer will determine shaft cleanliness by visual inspection for dry shafts, using divers or an
 inspection device or other methods the Engineer deems appropriate for wet shafts.
 When using slurry, meet the requirements of 455-15.8 at the time of
 concrete placement.
 455-15.11.4.1 Exceptions for Shafts for Sign, Signal, Lighting and ITS
 Structures: Ensure the depth of sedimentary deposits or other debris does not exceed 1 inch
 over the bottom of the shaft when installing drilled shafts to support sign, signal, lighting and
 ITS structures.
 455-15.11.5 Time of Excavation: Overream the sidewalls of any unclassified
 excavation work using mineral slurry lasting more than 36 hours (measured from the beginning
 of excavation for all methods except the Temporary or Permanent Casing Method, which begins
 at the time excavation begins below the casing) before placement of the concrete. Ensure that the
 minimum depth of overreaming the shaft sidewall is 1/2 inches and the maximum depth is
 3 inches. Provide any overreaming required at no expense to the Department when exceeding the
 36 hour limit unless the time limit is exceeded to accomplish excavating deeper than the
 elevation shown in the Plans as ordered by the Engineer. The Department will pay the Contractor
 for authorized overreaming when excavating deeper than the elevation shown in the Plans as
 ordered by the Engineer exceeds the 36 hour time limit as Extra Work.
 When using mineral slurry, adjust excavation operations so that the
 maximum time that slurry is in contact with the bottom 5 feet of the shaft (from time of drilling
 to concreting) does not exceed 12 hours. If exceeding the 12 hour time limit, overream the shaft
 socket or the full shaft when socket is not specified, at no additional expense to the Department
 prior to performing other operations in the shaft.
 455-16 Reinforcing Steel Construction and Placement.
 455-16.1 Cage Construction and Placement: Completely assemble and place as a unit
 the cage of reinforcing steel, consisting of longitudinal bars, ties, and cage stiffener bars,
 immediately after the Engineer inspects and accepts the shaft excavation and immediately prior
 to placing concrete. Tie all intersections of drilled shaft reinforcing steel with cross ties or
 “figure 8” ties. Use double strand ties, ties with larger tie wire, U-bolts, or similar when
 necessary. The Engineer will give final approval of the cage construction and placement subject
 to satisfactory performance in the field.
 455-16.2 Splicing Cage: If the bottom of the constructed shaft elevation is lower than the
 bottom of the shaft elevation in the Plans, extend a minimum of one half of the longitudinal bars
 required in the upper portion of the shaft the additional length. Continue the tie bars for the extra
 depth, spaced on 2 foot centers, and extend the stiffener bars to the final depth. The Contractor
 may lap splice these bars or use unspliced bars of the proper length. Do not weld bars to the
 planned reinforcing steel unless shown in the Contract Documents.
 For drilled shafts supporting sign, signal, lighting and ITS structures, if the shaft
 cleaning operations result in excavating below the required tip elevation, the reinforcing steel
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 589
 
 cage does not need to be extended. The reinforcing steel cage may be spliced to rest on the
 bottom of the excavation or suspended in place from the top.
 455-16.3 Support, Alignment, and Tolerance: Tie and support the reinforcing steel in
 the shaft so that the reinforcing steel will remain within allowable tolerances as specified in
 455-20 and Section 415.
 Use wheels or other approved noncorrosive spacing devices within 3 feet of the
 bottom, within 6 feet of the top, and intervals not exceeding 10 feet along the shaft to ensure
 concentric spacing for the entire length of the cage. Do not use block or wire type spacers. Use a
 minimum of one spacer per 30 inches of circumference of cage with a minimum of four at each
 level. Provide spacers at the bottom of the drilled shaft reinforcing cage as required to maintain
 the proper position of the cage.
 Check the elevation of the top of the steel cage before and after placing the
 concrete. If the cage is not within the specified tolerances, correct, and submit a revised DSIP to
 the Engineer for approval. Do not construct additional shafts until receiving approval from the
 Engineer.
 455-16.4 Nondestructive Integrity Testing Access Tubes: Install access tubes full
 length in all drilled shafts from the tip of shaft to a point high enough above top of shaft to allow
 thermal integrity testing for drilled shafts (TITDS) and cross-hole sonic logging (CSL) testing,
 but not less than 30 inches above the top of the drilled shaft, ground surface or water surface,
 whichever is higher. Equally space tubes around circumference of drilled shaft. Securely tie
 access tubes to the inside of the reinforcing cage and align tubes to be parallel to the vertical axis
 of the center of the cage. Access tubes from the top of the reinforcing cage to the tip of the shaft
 shall be NPS 1-1/2 Schedule 40 black iron or black steel (not galvanized) pipe. Access tubes
 above the top of the reinforcing cage may be the same black iron or black steel pipe or
 Schedule 40 PVC pipe. Ensure that the access tubes are free from loose rust, scale, dirt, paint, oil
 and other foreign material. Couple tubes as required with threaded couplers, such that inside of
 tube remains flush. Seal the bottom and top of the tubes with threaded caps. The tubes, joints and
 bottom caps shall be watertight. Seal the top of the tubes with lubricated, threaded caps sufficient
 to prevent the intrusion of foreign materials. Stiffen the cage sufficiently to prevent damage or
 misalignment of access tubes during the lifting and installation of the cage. Exercise care in
 removing the caps from the top of the tubes after installation so as not to apply excess torque,
 hammering or other stress which could break the bond between the tubes and the concrete.
 Provide the following number (rounded up to the next whole number of tubes)
 and configuration of cross-hole sonic logging access tubes in each drilled shaft based on the
 diameter of the shaft.

 Insert simulated or mock probes in each access tube prior to concreting to ensure
 the serviceability of the tube. Fill access tubes with clean potable water and recap prior to
 concreting. Repair or replace any leaking, misaligned or unserviceable tubes as in a manner
 acceptable to the Engineer prior to concreting.

 For drilled shaft foundations requiring anchor bolts, verify access tubes will not
 interfere with anchor bolt installation before excavating the shaft. When access tube locations
 conflict with anchor bolt locations, move the access tube location plus or minus 2 inches along
 the inner circumference of the reinforcing cage. Notify the Engineer before excavating the shaft
 if the access tube locations cannot be moved out of conflict with anchor bolt locations.
 For drilled shafts supporting sign, signal, lighting and ITS structures, if the shaft
 cleaning operations result in excavating below the required tip elevation, the access tubes do not
 need to be extended. If the reinforcing steel cage is suspended in place from the top rather than
 resting on the bottom of the excavation, clearly mark the top of shaft location on each tube
 455-17 Concrete Placement.
 455-17.1 General: Place concrete in accordance with the applicable portions of
 Sections 346 and 400, 455-15.2, 455-15.3, 455-15.4, 455-15.5, 455-15.8, 455-15.9, and the
 requirements herein.
 Place concrete as soon as possible after completing all excavation, cleaning the
 shaft excavation, inspecting and finding it satisfactory, and immediately after placing reinforcing
 steel. Continuously place concrete in the shaft to the top of the casing. Continue placing concrete
 after the casing is full until good quality concrete is evident at the top of the casing. Place
 concrete through a tremie or concrete pump using approved methods. After the shaft is
 overpoured sufficiently to eliminate all contaminated concrete, additional concrete may be added
 to the shaft without the use of a tremie or pump in accordance with Section 400.
 If the pressure head is lost during concrete placement for any reason, the Engineer
 may direct the Contractor to perform integrity testing at no expense to the Department.
 Immediately after concreting, check the water levels in the CSL access tubes and
 refill as necessary. If tubes become unserviceable, core new holes in the drilled shaft as directed
 by the Engineer.
 455-17.2 Placement Time Requirements: The elapsed time for placing drilled shaft
 concrete includes the concrete mixing and transit time, the concrete placement time, the time
 required to remove any temporary casing that causes or could cause the concrete to flow into the
 space previously occupied by the casing, and the time to insert any required column steel, bolts,
 weldments, etc. Maintain a minimum slump of 5 inches throughout the elapsed time. Use
 materials to produce and maintain the required slump through the elapsed time that meets the
 class of concrete specified. Provide slump loss tests that demonstrate to the Engineer that the
 concrete will maintain a 5 inch or greater slump for the anticipated elapsed time before
 beginning drilled shaft construction.
 455-17.3 Forms: When the top of shaft elevation is above ground or above water, form
 the portion of the shaft above ground and the portion of the shaft above water with a removable
 form or another approved method to the dimensions shown in the Plans except when the
 Permanent Casing Method is specified.
 455-17.4 Riser Blocks: The Contractor may cast a riser block of equal diameter as the
 column and of a maximum height of 6 inches at the top of the completed shaft. When this option
 is chosen, extend any dowel steel above the top of shaft an additional 6 inches.
 455-17.5 Curing: Cure the top surface in accordance with the applicable provisions of
 Section 400, and construct any construction joint area as shown in the Plans. Protect portions of
 drilled shafts exposed to a body of water from the action of water by leaving the forms in place
 for a minimum of seven days after casting the concrete. The Contractor may remove forms prior

 to seven days provided the concrete strength has reached 2,500 psi or greater as evidenced by
 cylinder breaks.
 455-17.6 Non-Destructive Testing of Drilled Shaft Integrity:
 455-17.6.1 Thermal Integrity Testing for Drilled Shafts (TITDS): Perform all
 TITDS in accordance with ASTM D7949. Test all drilled shafts in bridge bents or piers
 considered nonredundant in the Plans, using TITDS. For all other drilled shafts, perform TITDS
 only on drilled shafts selected by the Engineer. The minimum number of shafts tested is the
 number of shafts indicated in the Plans. The Engineer may increase the number shafts tested as
 deemed necessary.
 Engage a qualified Specialty Engineer to supervise the TITDS. The
 qualified TITDS Specialty Engineer must have a minimum six months experience of TITDS,
 have a Florida Licensed Professional Engineer and supervise the collection and interpretation of
 data. The individual performing the TITDS in the field must work for the Specialty Engineer
 firm and have a minimum of six months experience of TITDS. The Contractor shall provide all
 necessary assistance to the TITDS Specialty Engineer to satisfactorily perform the testing.
 After acceptance of production shafts by the Engineer, remove all water
 from the access tubes or core holes and fill the tubes or core holes with a structural non-shrink
 grout meeting the requirements of Section 934 from the bottom via tremie tube. Place the grout
 utilizing enough pressure to fill the tubes or core holes completely.
 If the Contractor determines at any time during the non-destructive testing
 and evaluation of the drilled shaft that the drilled shaft should be replaced, no further testing or
 evaluation of that shaft is required.
 455-17.6.1.1 Equipment: Furnish TITDS test equipment in accordance
 with ASTM D7949 as follows:
 1. Provide thermal probes with four orthogonally oriented infrared
 sensors able to be used in 1.5 inch I.D. pipes.
 2. Provide a computer based TITDS data acquisition system for
 display of signals during data acquisition.
 3. Provide a depth encoder sensor to determine probe depths.
 4. Provide an air compressor and power supply with sufficient
 pressure to air lift the water from the access tubes.
 455-17.6.1.2 Procedure: Perform TITDS testing between 24 and 72 hours
 after shaft concrete placement, unless otherwise directed by the Engineer. Furnish information
 regarding the shaft, tube lengths and depths, construction dates, and other pertinent shaft
 installation observations and details to the Department at the time of testing. Verify access tube
 lengths and their condition in the presence of the Department, at least 24 hours prior to TITDS. If
 the access tubes do not provide access over the full length of the shaft, repair the existing tube(s)
 or core additional hole(s), as directed by the Engineer, at no additional cost to the Department.
 Just prior to inserting the thermal probe, remove water from the
 access tubes. Store the removed water in an insulated container for later replacement. Allow the
 thermal probe to acclimate in accordance with the equipment manufacturer recommendations.
 Continuously record temperatures at depth intervals of 3.0 inches or less from the top to the
 bottom of each access tube. Repeat the test at each access tube until two sets of data from the
 same access tube provide similar results. Return the warm water to the access tubes immediately
 after the testing has been completed.

 592
 
 Immediately report any potential defects indicated by low
 temperature anomalies to the Engineer.
 455-17.6.1.3 Required TITDS Reports: Present the TITDS data and
 analysis results to the Engineer in a signed and sealed report. The report report shall include as
 minimum the following items:
 1. Graphs displaying all temperature measurements and average
 temperature versus depth.
 2. Indication of unusual temperatures, including cooler local
 deviations from the average at any depth from the overall average over the entire length.
 3. A graph displaying the average temperature and theoretical
 temperature versus depth.
 4. Variations in temperature between access tubes which may
 indicate variations in cage alignment.
 5. The calculated radius of the shaft throughout the entire depth.
 6. Alignment of the reinforcing cage along the shaft.
 7. Calculated concrete cover throughout the entire depth.
 8. A conclusion stating whether the tested shaft is free from
 integrity defects and meets the minimum concrete cover and diameter requirements by the
 specifications. When anomalies are detected, include in the report a three dimensional rendering
 of the shape of the shaft.
 455-17.6.1.4 Evaluation of TITDS Test Results: The Engineer will
 evaluate the observations during drilled shaft construction and TITDS results to determine
 whether or not the drilled shaft construction is acceptable. Drilled shafts not meeting the
 minimum cover and diameter requirements, or having integrity defects, are not acceptable
 without an engineering analysis.
 455-17.6.1.5 Coring and/or Repair of Drilled Shafts: If the Engineer
 determines a drilled shaft is unacceptable based on the TITDS tests and other testing, or observes
 problems during drilled shaft construction, core the shaft to allow further evaluation and repair,
 or replace the shaft as directed by the Engineer. If coring to allow further evaluation of the shaft
 and repair is chosen, one or more core samples shall be taken from each unacceptable shaft for
 full depth of the shaft or to the depth directed by the Engineer. The Engineer will determine the
 number, location, and diameter of the cores based on the results of the TITDS. Keep an accurate
 log of cores. Properly mark and place the cores in a crate showing the shaft depth at each interval
 of core recovery. Transport the cores, along with five copies of the coring log to the location
 designated by the Engineer. Perform strength testing by an AASHTO certified lab on portions of
 the cores as required by the Engineer. If the TITDS and coring indicate the shaft is defective,
 propose remedial measures for approval by the Engineer. Such improvement may consist of, but
 is not limited to correcting defective portions of the shaft, providing straddle shafts to
 compensate for capacity loss, or providing a replacement shaft. Repair all detected defects and
 conduct post repair integrity testing using horizontal and offset CSL testing and 3-D tomographic
 imaging as described in 455-17.6.2. Engage a Specialty Engineer to perform gamma-gamma
 density logging to verify the integrity of the shaft outside the reinforcing cage in the same
 locations where the repair was required. When straddle shafts or replacement shafts are used to
 correct a deficient foundation perform TITDS in accordance with 455-17.6.1 through 455-17.6.3
 to verify integrity of these shafts. Submit all results to the Engineer within five days of test

 completion for approval. Perform all work described in this subarticle at no additional cost to the
 Department, and with no increase in Contract Time.
 455-17.6.2 Cross Sonic Logging (CSL) and Tomography: When required by
 the Engineer, perform CSL testing in accordance with ASTM D6760. Engage a qualified
 Specialty Engineer to perform the CSL testing. The qualified CSL Specialty Engineer must be a
 Professional Engineer in the State of Florida and have a minimum six months experience of CSL
 testing, supervising the collection of CSL data and interpretation of CSL results. The individual
 performing the CLS testing in the field must work for the Specialty Engineer firm and have a
 minimum of six months experience of CSL testing. The Contractor shall provide all necessary
 access and assistance to the CSL Specialty Engineer to satisfactorily perform the testing.
 When a shaft contains four tubes, test every possible tube combination.
 For shafts with five or more tubes, test all pairs of adjacent tubes around the perimeter, and onehalf of the remaining number of tube combinations, as chosen by the Engineer. Pull the probes
 simultaneously, starting from the bottoms of the tubes, over an electronic depth measuring
 device. Perform the CSL tests with the source and receiver probes in the same horizontal plane.
 Continuously record temperatures at depth intervals of 2-1/2 inches or less from the bottom of
 the tubes to the top of each shaft. Remove all slack from the cables prior to pulling to provide
 accurate depth measurements in the CSL records. When the measurements indicate a 30% or
 greater reduction in velocity between one or more pairs perform 3D tomography analysis as
 indicated below.
 To perform 3D tomography analysis, conduct offset CSL measurements
 between the tube pair combinations in addition to the horizontal measurements. Record offset
 measurements with source and receiver vertically offset in the tubes. These measurements add
 four measurements per tube combination to the horizontal measurements described in this
 section. Offset measurements are described by the angle, in degrees, and direction the signal
 travels between the probes with respect to the horizontal plane: plus 45, plus 22.5 (source below
 receiver), and minus 45, minus 22.5 (source above receiver). Record offset measurements from
 the point where the higher probe is at least 5 feet below the velocity reduction to the point where
 the lower probe is at least 5 feet above the velocity reduction. When repairs are done, provide
 offset measurements from the point where the higher probe is at least 5 feet below the lower
 limit of the repaired zone to the point where the lower probe is at least 5 feet above the upper
 limit of the repaired zone. Perform offset measurements and provide CSL logs and 3D
 tomographic analysis at no additional cost to the Department.
 After acceptance of production shafts by the Engineer, fill the tubes or
 core holes with a structural non-shrink grout in accordance with 455-17.6.1.
 If the Contractor determines at any time during the non-destructive testing
 and evaluation of the drilled shaft that the drilled shaft should be replaced, no further testing or
 evaluation of that shaft is required.
 455-17.6.2.1 Required CSL Reports: Present the CSL data and analysis
 results to the Engineer in a signed and sealed report. Include CSL logs with analyses of first
 pulse arrival time (FAT) versus depth and pulse energy/amplitude versus depth. Present a CSL
 log for each tube pair tested with any defect zones identified on the logs and discussed in the test
 report as appropriate. When offset measurements are required, perform 3D tomographic analysis
 using all offset data, and include color coded 3D tomographic images in the report.
 455-17.6.2.2 Evaluation of Cross Hole Sonic logging Testing: The
 Engineer will evaluate the observations during drilled shaft construction and the CSL test results
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 594
 
 to determine whether or not the drilled shaft construction is acceptable. Drilled shafts with
 velocity reduction exceeding 30% are not acceptable without an engineering analysis.
 455-17.6.2.3 Coring and/or Repair of Drilled Shafts: If the Engineer
 determines a drilled shaft is unacceptable based on the CSL test and other testing, core the shaft
 to allow further evaluation and repair, or replace the shaft in accordance with 455-17.6.1.5.
 If repairs are performed or additional shafts installed to correct a
 deficient foundation, conduct integrity testing and submit the results to the Engineer in
 accordance with 455-17.6.1.5.
 455-18 Method Shafts.
 The Engineer will use the construction of method shafts (test holes) to determine if the
 methods and equipment used by the Contractor are sufficient to produce a shaft excavation
 meeting the requirements of the Contract Documents. During method shaft excavations, the
 Engineer will evaluate the ability to control dimensions and alignment of excavations within
 tolerances; to seal the casing into impervious materials; to control the size of the excavation
 under caving conditions by the use of slurry or by other means; to properly clean the completed
 shaft excavation; to construct excavations in open water areas; to determine the elevation of
 ground water; to place reinforcing steel and concrete meeting the requirements of these
 Specifications within the prescribed time frame; and to execute any other necessary construction
 operation. Revise the methods and equipment as necessary at any time during the construction of
 the method shaft when unable to satisfactorily carry out any of the necessary operations
 described above or when unable to control the dimensions and alignment of the shaft excavation
 within tolerances.
 Construct method shafts out of permanent position at the location shown in the Plans or
 as directed by the Engineer. Ensure the diameter and depth of the method shaft or holes are the
 same diameter and maximum depth as the production drilled shafts. Reinforce the method shaft
 unless otherwise directed in the Contract Documents. Fill the method shaft with concrete in the
 same manner production drilled shafts will be constructed. Backfill method shaft which are not
 filled with concrete with suitable soil in a manner satisfactory to the Engineer. Leave concreted
 method shaft in place, except remove the top of the shaft to a depth of 2 feet below the ground
 line. Use the same procedure for shafts constructed in water. Restore the disturbed areas at the
 sites of method shaft drilled out of position as nearly as practical to their original condition.
 When the Contractor fails to demonstrate to the Engineer the adequacy of his methods or
 equipment, and alterations are required, make appropriate modifications and provide additional
 test holes at no expense to the Department. Include the cost of all method shaft in the cost of the
 drilled shafts. Make no changes in methods or equipment after initial approval without the
 consent of the Engineer.
 A separate method shaft is not required for drilled shafts installed under sign, signal,
 lighting and ITS structures. The first production shaft will serve as a method shaft for
 determining acceptability of the installation method.
 455-19 Test Bells.
 Test bells are no longer used.
 455-20 Construction Tolerances.
 Meet the following construction tolerances for drilled shafts:
 1. Ensure that the top of the drilled shaft is no more than 3 inches laterally in the
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 595
 
 X or Y coordinate from the position indicated in the Plans.
 2. Ensure that the vertical alignment of the shaft excavation does not vary from
 the alignment shown in the Plans by more than 1/4 inches per foot of depth.
 3. After placing all the concrete, ensure that the top of the reinforcing steel cage is
 no more than 6 inches above and no more than 3 inches below plan position.
 4. Ensure that the reinforcing cage is concentric with the shaft within a tolerance
 of 1-1/2 inches. Ensure that concrete cover is a minimum of 4-1/2 inches unless shown otherwise
 in the Plans.
 5. All casing diameters shown in the Plans refer to I.D. (inside diameter)
 dimensions. However, the Contractor may use casing with an outside diameter equal to the
 specified shaft diameter if the extra length described in 455-15.7 is provided. In this case, ensure
 that the I.D. of the casing is not less than the specified shaft diameter less 1 inch. When
 approved, the Contractor may elect to provide a casing larger in diameter than shown in the
 Plans to facilitate meeting this requirement. Ensure that the minimum diameter of the drilled
 shaft is 1 inch less than the specified shaft diameter. When conditions are such that a series of
 telescoping casings are used, provide the casing sized to maintain the minimum shaft diameters
 listed above.
 6. Except when abutting or encroaching within a sidewalk, ensure that the top
 elevation of the drilled shaft concrete has a tolerance of plus 1 inch and minus 3 inches from the
 top of shaft elevation shown in the Plans.
 7. When abutting or encroaching within a sidewalk, ensure that the top elevation
 of the drilled shaft is flush with the sidewalk surface.
 8. The dimensions of casings are subject to American Petroleum Institute
 tolerances applicable to regular steel pipe.
 9. Use excavation equipment and methods designed so that the completed shaft
 excavation will have a flat bottom. Ensure that the cutting edges of excavation equipment are
 normal to the vertical axis of the equipment within a tolerance of plus or minus 3/8 inches per
 foot of diameter.
 455-21 Drilled Shaft Excavations Constructed out of Tolerance.
 Do not construct drilled shaft excavations in such a manner that the concrete shaft cannot
 be completed within the required tolerances. The Contractor may make corrections to an
 unacceptable drilled shaft excavation by any combination of the following methods:
 1. Overdrilling the shaft excavation to a larger diameter to permit accurate
 placement of the reinforcing steel cage with the required minimum concrete cover.
 2. Increasing the number and/or size of the steel reinforcement bars.
 When the tolerances are not met, the Contractor may propose a redesign to incorporate
 shafts installed out of tolerance into caps or footings. Incorporate shafts installed out of tolerance
 at no expense to the Department. Ensure the Contractor’s Engineer of Record performs any
 redesign and signs and seals the redesign drawings and computations. Do not begin any proposed
 construction until the redesign has been reviewed for acceptability and approved by the
 Engineer.
 Backfill any out of tolerance shafts in an approved manner when directed by the Engineer
 until the redesign is complete and approved. Furnish additional materials and work necessary,
 including engineering analysis and redesign, to effect corrections of out of tolerance drilled shaft
 excavations at no expense to the Department.

 455-22 Load Tests.
 When the Plans include load testing, perform all load tests in accordance with 455-2 or as
 shown in the Contract Documents.
 455-23 Method of Measurement.
 455-23.1 Drilled Shafts: The quantity to be paid for will be the length, in feet, of the
 reinforced concrete drilled shaft of the diameter shown in the Plans, completed and accepted.
 The length will be determined as the difference between the top of shaft elevation as shown in
 the Plans and the final bottom of shaft elevation as authorized and accepted. When the
 Contractor elects to provide outside diameter (O.D.) sized casing rather than inside diameter
 (I.D.) sized casing as allowed in 455-15.7, the pay quantity measured as described above will be
 multiplied by a factor (F) determined as follows:
 2 F = D 2 D1
 D2
 where:
 
 F= factor to adjust pay quantities to compensate for smaller shafts.
 D 1 = casing inside diameter specified = shaft diameter specified.
 D 2 = casing inside diameter provided (D 2 = D 1 minus twice the wall
 thickness).
 
 455-23.2 Drilled Shafts (Unreinforced): The quantity to be paid for will be the length,
 in feet, of unreinforced concrete drilled shaft of the diameters shown in the Plans, completed and
 accepted. The length will be determined as the difference between the top of shaft elevation as
 shown in the Plans and the final bottom of shaft elevation as authorized and accepted. When the
 Contractor elects to use O.D. casing, the quantity as determined above will be multiplied by the
 factor “F” determined as described in 455-23.1.
 455-23.3 Unclassified Shaft Excavation: The quantity to be paid for will be the length,
 in feet, of unclassified shaft excavation of the diameter shown in the Plans, completed and
 accepted, measured along the centerline of the shaft from the ground surface elevation after any
 required excavation per 455-1.2 to the plan bottom of shaft elevation authorized and accepted
 plus up to 15 feet or 3 shaft diameters, whichever is deeper, of additional excavation as
 authorized by the Engineer. When drilled shafts are constructed through fills placed by the
 Contractor, the original ground surface before the fill was placed will be used to determine the
 quantity of unclassified shaft excavation. When the Contractor elects to use O.D. casing, the
 quantity as determined above will be multiplied by the factor “F” determined as described in
 455-23.1.
 455-23.4 Unclassified Extra Depth Excavation: When excavation is required by the
 Engineer to extend more than 15 feet or 3 shaft diameters, whichever is deeper, below the bottom
 of the shaft elevation shown in the Plans, the work will be considered as Unforeseeable Work.
 455-23.5 Method Shafts: The cost of all method shafts will be included in the cost of
 drilled shafts.
 455-23.6 Core (Shaft Excavation): The quantity to be paid for will be the length, in feet,
 measured from the bottom of shaft elevation to the bottom of the core-hole, for each authorized
 core drilled below the shaft excavation, completed and accepted. When the Engineer authorizes
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 597
 
 pilot holes extending through part or all of the shaft, prior to excavation, to some depth below the
 shaft bottom, the quantity paid as core (shaft excavation) will be the length in feet, measured
 from the top elevation to the bottom elevation authorized by the Engineer, completed and
 accepted. When SPT tests are substituted for coring or pilot holes as provided in 455-15.6, the
 quantity will be determined as described above in this Section.
 455-23.7 Casings: The quantity to be paid for will be the length, in feet, of each size
 casing as directed and authorized to be used. The length will be measured along the casing from
 the top of the shaft elevation or the top of casing whichever is lower to the bottom of the casing
 at each shaft location where casing is authorized and used, except as described below when the
 top of casing elevation is shown in the Plans. Casing will be paid for only when the Permanent
 Casing Method is specified, when the Plans show a casing that becomes a permanent part of the
 shaft, or when the Engineer directs the Contractor to leave a casing in place which then becomes
 a permanent part of the shaft. No payment will be made for casings which become bound or
 fouled during shaft construction and cannot be practically removed. The Contractor shall include
 the cost of all temporary removable casings for methods of construction other than that of the
 Permanent Casing Method in the bid price for unclassified shaft excavation item.
 When the Permanent Casing Method and the top of casing elevation are specified,
 the casing will be continuous from top to bottom. Authorization for temporary casing will not be
 given unless the Contractor demonstrates that he can maintain alignment of the temporary upper
 casing with the lower casing to be left in place during excavation and concreting operations.
 When artesian conditions are or may be encountered, the Contractor shall also demonstrate that
 he can maintain a positive water-tight seal between the two casings during excavation and
 concreting operations.
 When the top of casing elevation is shown in the Contract Documents, payment
 will be from the elevation shown in the Plans or from the actual top of casing elevation,
 whichever is lower, to the bottom of the casing. When the Contractor elects to use an approved
 special temporary casing system in open water locations, the length to be paid for will be
 measured as a single casing as provided above.
 455-23.8 Load Tests: The quantity to be paid for will be the number and type of load
 tests conducted.
 455-23.8 Instrumentation and Data Collection: The quantity to be paid for will be at
 the lump sum price.
 455-23.10 Thermal Integrity Testing for Drilled Shafts and Cross-Hole Sonic
 Logging: The quantity of the TTIDS to be paid for will be the number of drilled shafts accepted
 based on TITDS tests. When TITDS is not performed in accordance with 455-17.6.1, perform
 CSL testing at no cost to the Department. No payment will be made for any integrity testing
 when such testing indicates the shaft cannot be accepted based on the integrity testing itself. No
 payment will be made for integrity testing performed to evaluate the integrity of post-repair work
 or for CSL testing not requested by the Engineer. When the Engineer requests CSL tests and the
 results indicate the shaft is acceptable, the testing will be paid as unforeseen work.
 455-24 Basis of Payment.
 455-24.1 Drilled Shafts: Price and payment will be full compensation for all drilled
 shafts, including the cost of concrete, reinforcing steel and cross-hole sonic logging tubes,
 including all labor, materials, equipment, and incidentals necessary to complete the drilled shaft.

 D. SPREAD FOOTINGS
 
 455-25 Description.
 Construct reinforced concrete spread footing foundations, including dewatering when
 necessary, excavating to the required limits, compacting the underlying soil as required, and
 constructing seals when required.
 455-26 General Requirements.
 Meet the following requirements for all spread footings:
 1. Perform excavations, including the removal of all material, of whatever nature,
 necessary for the construction of spread footings. As used herein, the term “soil” shall constitute
 any material, whether soil, rock, or other materials.
 2. Slope excavations as required, or support them with sheeting, and shore them if
 necessary, to provide a safe excavation that is adequate for construction purposes and that will
 adequately protect any existing adjacent structures.
 3. Ensure that the foundation soils are firm, stable, and, in the opinion of the
 Engineer, meet or exceed the design bearing and compressibility requirements before
 constructing the footings or any required seals. The Department may elect to use any type of
 tests to evaluate the foundation soils that is appropriate in the opinion of the Engineer. Cooperate
 with the Engineer in the evaluation of the foundation soils, and assist the Engineer as necessary
 to provide access to the site.
 4. The elevation of the bottom of footings or seals and/or the depth of
 over-excavation shown in the Plans is approximate and the Engineer may order, in writing, such
 changes as may be necessary to secure a satisfactory foundation.
 5. Place all spread footing concrete in the dry.
 455-27 Monitor Existing Structures.
 Monitor existing structures in accordance with Section 108.
 455-28 Dewatering.
 The Contractor is responsible for the design, installation, and operation of an adequate
 dewatering system to dewater excavations for spread footings. Use a well point or well system.
 Submit a dewatering plan to the Engineer for his records before beginning construction.
 Use well points or wells where the piezometric water level is above an elevation 3 feet
 below the bottom of the excavation. Maintain the water table 3 feet or more below the maximum
 depth of excavation. Provide continuous dewatering until completing construction of the footing
 and backfill the excavation at least 3 feet above the piezometric water table elevation. Continue
 dewatering until the Engineer considers conditions safe to discontinue dewatering. In the event
 of a dewatering failure, assist the Engineer as required in determining the effects of such a failure
 on the foundation soils, and take whatever corrective measures are required at no additional
 expense to the Department. When the Engineer approves the discontinuing of dewatering,
 decrease the rate of pumping, allowing the water level to rise slowly. Use a rate, in feet per hour,
 that the water table is allowed to rise equal to the total number of feet the water table was
 lowered, divided by ten hours or a rate of 1 foot per hour, whichever is less.
 Install one piezometer well approximately every 15 feet of footing perimeter. Provide a
 minimum of two and a maximum of six piezometers at locations within 2 feet from the outside
 of the footing perimeter. Install piezometer wells to a depth at least 10 feet below the bottom of

 footing elevation or as directed by the Engineer. Measure water elevation in the piezometer wells
 prior to excavation and at 12-hour intervals between excavation and discontinuation of
 dewatering. Maintain the piezometers in working condition throughout the dewatering process,
 and repair or replace them when damaged at no expense to the Department.
 455-29 Excavations:
 If the excavation must be carried deeper than shown in the Plans to obtain a satisfactory
 foundation, the Engineer will revise the Plans in accordance with the following:
 1. When the change in bottom elevation of the footing is 12 inches or less, the
 Engineer will keep the top of the footing at the elevation shown in the original Plans and will
 increase the thickness to obtain a satisfactory foundation.
 2. When the change in elevation of the bottom of footing exceeds 12 inches, the
 Engineer will revise the Plans and lower the footing, thereby increasing the height of stem, to
 obtain a satisfactory foundation. Generally, the Engineer will also increase the thickness and
 width of footing over that shown in the original Plans.
 455-29.1 Dry Excavations: Dry excavations are excavations that can be completed
 without the need to lower the piezometric water level. Perform dry excavations when the
 piezometric water level at the time of construction is and, in the opinion of the Engineer, will
 remain at least 3 feet below the bottom of the authorized excavation or over-excavation.
 Demonstrate to the Engineer that a stable excavation can be made without dewatering. Make
 adequate provisions to divert surface runoff and to collect and remove any water entering the
 excavation.
 Excavate to the bottom of footing, to the over-excavation limits shown in the
 Plans, or as directed by the Engineer. Save any suitable materials for backfill. Provide areas for
 the disposal of all unsuitable materials, and dispose of them in a satisfactory method. Compact
 the foundation soils below the footing as shown in the Plans or described herein before
 constructing the footing.
 455-29.2 Dewatered Excavations: Dewatered excavations are excavations made after
 first lowering the piezometric water level with wellpoints or wells. Perform dewatering as
 described in 455-28. Excavate in the dry after lowering of the water table.
 When dewatering is required, the Contractor may excavate within 3 feet of the
 ground water table before dewatering begins if the dewatering system is operating and the
 Contractor has demonstrated that the water level has been lowered to and maintained at
 acceptable limits. Where large excavations require stage lowering of the water table (additional
 wellpoint systems installed at lower elevations), the Contractor may continue excavating as long
 as the water elevation is maintained at least 3 feet below the excavation.
 Ensure that surface runoff is diverted from the excavation. Compact the
 foundation soils as shown in the Plans or as described herein before constructing the footing.
 455-29.3 Wet Excavations: Wet excavations are excavations made below the existing
 water table without prior dewatering. When the Plans show a cofferdam and seal, perform the
 excavation in the wet. Maintain the water level during excavation at or above the water level
 outside the cofferdam.
 Place the seal directly upon the foundation soils or rock when using wet
 excavations. Do not compact foundation soils for wet excavations. Ensure that the foundation
 soils or rock are disturbed as little as practical. Remove all materials that are determined by the
 Engineer to be loose or disturbed before placing the seal concrete.

 455-30 Fill or Backfill.
 In all excavations, including over-excavations below the footing, use only fill or backfill
 materials considered Select in accordance with Standard Plans, Index 120-001. Ensure the
 material is free of rubble, debris, or rocks that would prevent uniform placement and
 compaction. Ensure the material below the top of the footing is free of Recycled Asphalt
 Pavement (RAP). Perform sampling and testing in accordance with 120-10.1.4, except replace
 AASHTO T99, Method C with FM 1-T180, Method D.
 455-31 Compaction and Density Requirements.
 Compact the bottom of the excavation with suitable equipment. Compact the soil beneath
 footing excavation (whether dug to the bottom of footing or over-excavated) to a density not less
 than 95% of the maximum density as determined by FM 1-T180, Method D for a minimum
 depth of 2 feet below the bottom of the excavation or to the depth shown in the Plans before
 backfilling begins. For every 500 feet of excavation or isolated compaction operation, perform
 two Quality Control (QC) density tests with a 12 inch depth of measurement: one QC density test
 with the gauge placed at an elevation of 1 foot below the bottom of the excavation and one QC
 density test with the gauge placed at the bottom of the excavation in accordance with FM 1T238. Compact the backfill in footing excavations which have been over-excavated to a density
 not less than 95% of the maximum density as determined by FM 1-T180, Method D. Ensure that
 the maximum lift thickness after compaction does not exceed 6 inches. For every 500 ft of
 backfill or isolated compaction operation, perform at least one QC density test. The Engineer
 will conduct one density verification test per every 4 QC test, with a minimum of one density test
 below the bottom of the excavation and one density test in the backfill. Verification comparison
 criteria and resolution procedures will be in accordance with 120-10.4 except replace
 AASHTO T99, Method C with FM 1-T180, Method D.
 For compaction, use an approved heavy vibratory roller with a static drum weight of at
 least 4 tons. Compact each lift to the required density. Also, compact the final lift below the
 footing with a suitable sled vibratory compactor to remove any upper disturbance caused by the
 drum roller. When conditions require use of smaller compaction equipment, obtain the
 Engineer’s approval for the equipment, and reduce the lift thickness to achieve the required
 density.
 Perform backfilling to the original ground surface, finished grade, or subgrade as required
 by the Plans in the immediate vicinity by approved mechanical compactors weighing less than
 1,000 pounds. The Contractor may compact backfill located more than 15 feet away from the
 exterior periphery of the footing with heavier compactors. Do not place backfill on the footing
 until the Engineer has given permission and until the concrete is at least seven days old.
 When the plans indicate spread footing abutments on mechanically stabilized earth
 (MSE) walls, place and compact the backfill material underneath the footing in accordance with
 the requirements of 548-8.5. Meet the density requirements of 548-9.4.
 455-32 Forming.
 Form spread footings if it cannot be demonstrated that the natural soil or rock is strong
 enough to prevent caving during construction. For forms, meet the applicable requirements of
 400-5. When forms are not required, meet the requirements of 400-5.4.4.
 455-33 Materials.
 455-33.1 Concrete: Meet the requirements of Section 346.

 455-33.2 Reinforcing Steel: Meet the requirements of Section 415. For spread footing
 reinforcing steel, use Grade 60.
 455-34 Reinforcing Steel Placement.
 Place and fasten reinforcing steel for footings according to the applicable provisions of
 415-5.
 455-35 Concrete Placement.
 455-35.1 Placement: Place all footing concrete in the dry and according to the applicable
 provisions of Section 400. Do not construct joints in footings.
 455-35.2 Finish: After placing and consolidating the concrete, strike-off the top surface
 to the grades shown in the Contract Documents, leaving the surface smooth and free of
 undesirable cavities and other defects. Do not provide a special finish unless the footing will be
 visible after construction, in which case, meet the applicable provisions of Section 400.
 455-35.3 Curing: Provide continuous-moisture-curing for footings. For cover materials,
 use clean sand, sawdust, or other materials meeting the approval of the Engineer. Continuously
 wet the cover materials for a period of 72 hours.
 455-36 Method of Measurement.
 455-36.1 Dewatering: The quantity to be paid for will be at the Contract unit price for
 each footing excavation, only at locations authorized by the Engineer and acceptably dewatered.
 455-36.2 Excavation: No separate payment will be made for backfill or will separate
 payment be made for excavation above bottom of footing elevation. The cost of this work will be
 included in the Contract unit price for concrete (substructure). For footings with excavation
 (over-excavation) below the bottom of the footing elevation shown in the Plans, the cost of this
 excavation, backfilling, and compaction will be included in the Contract unit price for excavation
 for structures. The pay quantity will be the volume in cubic yards bounded by vertical planes
 12 inches outside of the limits of the footing and parallel thereto and extending from the bottom
 of the footing elevation to the authorized bottom of over-excavation or within the pay limits
 shown in the Plans. If the elevation of a footing as shown in the Plans is changed to a higher or
 lower elevation, the Engineer will not consider such change as a material change to the original
 Contract Documents, a waiver of any condition of the Contract, or an invalidation of any of the
 provisions of the Contract.

 E. STRUCTURES (OTHER THAN BRIDGE)
 FOUNDATIONS-AUGER CAST PILES
 
 455-38 Description.
 Furnish and install auger cast piles used for structural support, other than bridge
 foundations.
 455-39 General Requirements.
 455-39.1 Contractor’s Operations: Submit an Auger Cast Pile Installation Plan in
 accordance with 455-47. Prior to the start of production piles, demonstrate to the satisfaction of
 the Engineer, the dependability of the equipment, techniques, and source of materials by
 construction of a demonstration pile.
 455-39.2 Monitor Existing Structures: Monitor existing structures in accordance with
 Section 108.
 455-40 Materials.

 604
 
 455-42 Mixing and Pumping Cement Grout.
 Meet the following requirements:
 1. Only use pumping equipment approved by the Engineer in the preparation and
 handling of the grout. Before using the mixers, remove all oil or other rust inhibitors from the
 mixing drums, stirring mechanisms, and other portions of the equipment in contact with the
 grout.
 2. Use a quantity of water and mixing time that will produce a homogenous grout
 having an efflux of not less than 21 seconds, when tested with a flow cone in accordance with
 ASTM D6449. Reject loads with efflux of less than 21 seconds. Notify the production facility to
 adjust the mix design. Calibrate the flow cone in accordance with ASTM D 6449. Conduct the
 calibration initially before its first use and as directed by the Engineer, when there is a question
 of the flow cone’s accuracy.
 Technicians performing the efflux test must take the Auger Cast Pile
 course and pass the final examination to be qualified to test for any auger cast pile installations in
 the field. Assist the Engineer in verifying the technicians meet these requirements.
 Conduct tests for efflux time at the beginning of each days grouting
 operation and as directed by the Engineer to ensure the specification requirements are met.
 3. Mix the grout at least one minute. If agitated continuously, the grout may be
 held in the mixer or agitator for a period not exceeding 2.5 hours at grout temperatures below
 70ºF; two hours for temperatures from 70°F to 100ºF. Do not place grout when its temperature
 exceeds 100ºF. If there is a lapse in the operation of grout injection, recirculate the grout through
 the pump, or through the mixer drum or agitator.
 4. Use mixers capable of combining components into a thoroughly mixed and
 uniform mass, free from balls or lumps and capable of discharging the concrete with a
 satisfactory degree of uniformity. The Engineer’s approval of grout mixers and all other
 equipment will be contingent on proper performance during construction of the demonstration
 pile and subsequent production work.
 5. Use a screen no larger than 3/4 inch mesh between the mixer and pump to
 remove large particles which might clog the injection system.
 6. Use a positive displacement piston type grout pump equipped with a pressure
 gauge, capable of developing displacing pressures at the pump up to 350 psi.
 7. Accurately monitor the volume and pressure of the grout flow. Test and
 calibrate the equipment during construction of the demonstration pile to demonstrate flow
 volume measurement accuracy of plus or minus 3% over the range of grouting pressures
 anticipated during this work. Provide a pump stroke counter in good working condition on the
 grout pump. Also calibrate the equipment any time the Engineer determines the grout pump
 performance may have changed.
 455-43 Testing Cement Grout.
 Prepare three 4 inches x 8 inches cylinders in accordance with ASTM C31, except pour
 grout in a single lift into cylinders molds without rodding, for each LOT. Plastic properties in
 accordance with ASTM C31 are not required. A LOT is defined as the lesser of 50 cubic yards of
 cement grout placed or one day of pile placement. Prepare one additional “hold” cylinder on the
 lot that is selected by the Engineer for Verification. Provide curing facilities for all QC and
 Verification test cylinders in accordance with ASTM C31. Test the cylinders at 28 days, in
 accordance with ASTM C39.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 605
 
 When one of the three QC cylinders from a LOT is lost, missing, damaged or destroyed,
 determination of compressive strength will be made by averaging the remaining two cylinders. If
 more than one QC cylinder from a LOT is lost, missing, damaged or destroyed, core the structure
 at no additional expense to the Department to determine the compressive strength. Acceptance of
 LOT may be based on verification data at the discretion of the Engineer. Obtain the approval of
 the Engineer to core, and of the core location prior to coring. Repair core holes after samples are
 taken with a product meeting the approval of the Engineer, at no additional cost to the
 Department.
 For each QC cylinder that is lost, missing, damaged or destroyed, payment for that LOT
 will be reduced by $750.00 per 1,000 psi of the specified design strength [Example: loss of two
 auger cast pile grout QC cylinders that have no verification data will require the element to be
 cored and a pay reduction will be assessed (5,500 psi / 1,000 psi) x $750 x 2 = $8,250]. This
 reduction will be in addition to any pay adjustment for low strength.
 The Engineer will also cast three verification cylinders and one “hold” cylinder from one
 of every four consecutive lots, randomly selected. The Engineer will compare QC and
 Verification results in accordance with Section 346. If the results do not compare, the Engineer
 will initiate a Resolution Investigation in accordance with Section 346
 Personnel making/curing concrete cylinders shall be certified as ACI Concrete Field
 Testing Technician Grade I. Personnel performing tests on hardened properties of concrete, such
 as strength determination of cylinders or beams, they shall be certified as ACI Concrete Strength
 Testing Technician.
 All low strength cement grout accepted by the Engineer will be subject to reduced
 payment as follows: $0.80 per cubic yard for each 10 psi of strength test value below the
 specified minimum strength. The Engineer will use the average compressive strength of the LOT
 tests for the computation of this pay reduction.
 The Engineer will compute the volume of grout for which the reduction will be applied as
 115% of the theoretical volume of the auger cast pile diameter required in the Contract
 Documents. Reduction in pay will be applied to the entire length of all piles containing low
 strength cement grout, in any quantity. The quantity of cement grout affected by the price
 reduction may exceed the quantity of cement grout contained in the LOT.
 When separate payment for auger grouted piles is provided, the dollar reduction will be
 equated to an equivalent length of pile not to exceed the total pile length constructed utilizing the
 subject LOT based on the following formula:
 PLR = RC/UC
 Where: PLR = Equivalent Pile Length Reduction in feet
 RC = Total Reduction in payment, dollars
 UC = Unit Cost of pile, dollars /foot
 When a cement grout acceptance strength test falls more than 500 psi below the specified
 minimum strength perform one of the following:
 1. Remove and replace the cement grout represented by the LOT in question at no
 additional cost to the Department; or,
 2. Submit a structural analysis performed by the Contractor’s Engineer of Record.
 If the results of the analysis, approved by the Department, indicate adequate strength to serve the
 intended purpose with adequate durability, the concrete may remain in place.

 Otherwise, remove and replace the LOT of concrete in question at no additional cost to
 the Department.
 455-44 Pile Installation.
 Meet the following requirements:
 1. Locate the piles as shown on the drawings.
 2. Should soft, compressible muck, organics, clay or other unsuitable materials
 (non A-1, A-3, A-2-4 or limestone materials) be encountered, remove the unsuitable material to a
 maximum depth of 5 feet and a maximum diameter about the pile centerline, not to exceed 1/2 of
 the distance to the adjacent pile. Backfill with clean granular backfill materials (A-1, A-3,
 A-2-4), placed and compacted in maximum 12 inch lifts to at least 95% of maximum dry density
 as determined by AASHTO T180. Complete this work to the Engineer’s satisfaction prior to
 auger cast pile construction. Should more than 5 feet or excessive quantities of unsuitable
 material be encountered, immediately advise the Engineer and proceed with the work as directed
 by the Engineer.
 3. Provide continuous auger flighting from the auger head to the top of auger with
 no gaps or other breaks, uniform in diameter throughout its length, and of the diameter specified
 for the piles less a maximum of 3%. Provide augers with a distance between flights of
 approximately half the diameter of the auger.
 4. Use augers with the grout injection hole located at the bottom of the auger head
 below the bar containing the cutting teeth, and with pile auger leads containing a bottom guide.
 5. Construct piles of the length and diameter shown on the drawings.
 6. Clearly mark the auger leads to facilitate monitoring of the incremental drilling
 and grout placement. Provide individual foot marks with 5 foot increments highlighted and
 clearly visible. Provide a clear reference mark on the moving auger assembly to facilitate
 accurately monitoring the vertical movement of the auger.
 7. Place piles by rotating a continuous flight hollow shaft auger into the ground at
 a continuous rate that prevents removal of excess soil. Stop advancement after reaching the
 predetermined depth.
 8. Should auger penetration to the required depth prove difficult due to hard
 materials/refusal, the pile location may be predrilled, upon approval of the Engineer, through the
 obstruction using appropriate drilling equipment, to a diameter no larger than 1/2 the prescribed
 finish diameter of the auger cast pile. Commence auger cast pile construction immediately upon
 predrilling to minimize ground loss and soil relaxation. Should non-drillable material be
 encountered preventing placement to the depth required, immediately advise the Engineer and
 proceed with the work as directed by the Engineer. Refusal is defined as the depth where the
 penetration of the standard auger equipment is less than 12 inches per minute.
 9. Plug the hole in the bottom of the auger while being advanced into the ground.
 Remove the plug by the grout or with the reinforcing bar.
 10. Pump the grout with sufficient pressure as the auger is withdrawn to fill the
 auger hole, preventing hole collapse and to cause the lateral penetration of the grout into soft or
 porous zones of the surrounding soil. Prior to commencing withdrawal of the auger, establish a
 head of at least 5 feet of grout by pumping a volume of grout equivalent to 5 feet of pile volume.
 Maintain this head of at least 5 feet of grout above the injection point around the perimeter of the
 auger to displace and remove any loose material from the hole. Maintain positive rotation of the
 auger at least until placement of the grout.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 607
 
 11. Once the grout head has been established, greatly reduce the speed of rotation
 of the auger and commence extraction at a rate consistent with the pump discharge. Maintain
 extraction at a steady rate to prevent a locked-in auger, necking of the pile, or a substantially
 reduced pile section. Ensure grout starts flowing out from the hole when the cutting head is at
 least 5 feet below the ground surface. Place a minimum volume of grout in the hole of at least
 115% of the column of the auger hole from a depth of 5 feet to the tip. Place a minimum volume
 of grout in the hole of at least 105% of the column of the auger hole from the ground surface to a
 depth of 5 feet. Do not include any grout needed to create surplus grout head in the volume of
 grout placed into the hole. If the grout does not flow out from the hole when the cutting head is
 at least 5 feet below the ground surface, redrill the pile under the direction of the Engineer. If
 grouting is interrupted for any reason, reinsert the auger by drilling at least 5 feet below the tip of
 the auger when the interruption occurred, and then regrout.
 Use this method of placement at all times. Do not depend on the stability
 of the hole without the earth filled auger. Place the required steel reinforcement while the grout
 is still fluid, but no later than 1/2 hour after pulling of the auger.
 12. Assume responsibility for the grout volume placed. If less than 115% of the
 theoretical volume of grout is placed in any 5 foot increment (105% in the top 5 foot increment),
 reinstall the pile by advancing the auger 10 feet or to the bottom of the pile if that is less,
 followed by controlled removal and grout injection.
 13. Furnish and install the reinforcing steel and anchoring bolts as shown in the
 Contract drawings.
 14. Use reinforcement that is without kinks or nonspecified bends, free of mud,
 oil or other coatings that could adversely affect the bond. Make splices in reinforcement as
 shown on the Contract drawings, unless otherwise approved by the Engineer. The steel cage shall
 be installed into the grout by its own weight or manually. Do not use a mechanical equipment or
 tool to impact the steel cage or to force it into the grout.
 15. Leave any temporary supports of/for items placed into a grouted pile
 (reinforcement template, anchor bolt template, precast column supports, etc.) in place for a
 minimum of 12 hours after completion of the pile. Do not place wall panels or other significant
 loads, before the grout has set a minimum of seven days or reached the 28 day strength.
 455-45 Construction Tolerances.
 Locate piles as shown on the drawings, or as otherwise directed by the Engineer. Locate
 pile centers to an accuracy of plus or minus 3 inches. Ensure that the top of pile elevation is
 within an accuracy of plus or minus 3 inches of the plan elevation.
 455-46 Unacceptable Piles.
 Repair or replace unacceptable piles, as directed by the Engineer, at no cost to the
 Department. Unacceptable piles are defined as piles that fail for any reason, including but not
 limited to the following: piles placed out of position or to improper elevation; piles with reduced
 cross section, contaminated grout, lack of grout consolidation (honeycombed), or deficient grout
 strength; and piles with reinforcement, anchor devices or other components cast or placed into
 the fluid grout out of position.

 of materials, components and the fabricated product to the extent considered necessary to
 confirm the conformance with Contract Documents.
 460-3.5 Notification Prior to Commencement of Assembly: Notify the Engineer at
 least one week prior to beginning assembly, when conducted in-state, and at least two weeks
 prior to beginning assembly, when conducted out-of-state.
 460-4 Shop Workmanship and Assembly.
 460-4.1 Handling, Transporting and Storage of Materials:
 460-4.1.1 General: Handle, transport and store plates, shapes, assemblies,
 fastener components and other parts in a manner that protects them from damage and facilitates
 subsequent inspections in a safe manner.
 Provide storage which will keep materials, assemblies, other components
 and parts clean, and free from dirt, grease, other foreign matter, unacceptable corrosion or
 coating deterioration, and any other adverse environmental conditions.
 460-4.1.2 Bulk Materials: Ensure that all bulk materials, such as shear studs, are
 stored together in individual LOTs and that the outside of each container has a list and
 description of the contents. Maintain a separate list of the weights of all tools and erection
 materials.
 460-4.1.3 Fastener Assemblies (Bolts, Nuts and Washers): Transport and store
 fastener assemblies in sealed, watertight containers. Label the side of each container with the
 supplier’s name and LOT identification number, and marked to identify the contents and size of
 the fastener components. Ensure that all surfaces of the nuts are lubricated prior to their
 placement in watertight containers. Provide containers for components that are capable of
 protecting them from moisture and other harmful materials. Maintain containers in their sealed
 conditions until they are opened for use at their assembly locations.
 Do not remove more fastener assemblies from the protected area than can
 be installed and tightened during a work shift. Leave the containers unopened until needed for
 assembly. At the end of the work shift, return unused fastener assemblies to the protected storage
 area for future use. Protect opened storage containers from contamination.
 460-4.1.4 Coatings: Store coatings in accordance with Sections 962, and 975 and
 the manufacturer’s recommendations. Notify the Engineer if the manufacturer’s
 recommendations vary from that provided in the Contract Documents.
 460-4.1.5 Anchor Rods and Nuts: Ship anchor rods and nuts as an assembly.
 Washers may be shipped separate from the assembly.
 460-4.2 Material Traceability:
 460-4.2.1 General: All materials arriving at the shop shall be properly identified
 in accordance the requirements of ASTM A6. Document all main load-carrying member
 material, high-strength fastener assemblies, and weld materials incorporated into the work
 through the entire fabrication process. Document this material traceability in a report type format
 that correlates heat numbers to their respective locations in the completed members. Submit
 diagrams and sketches as requested by the Engineer for clarity.
 At the fabrication facility, maintain the records of the material testing and
 certification processes and component/part identification as part of the fabricator’s permanent
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 623
 
 project records for a period of not less than two years as measured from the last shipment of
 materials from the fabricator’s facility. Submit all project-related records to the Engineer.
 Mark the weight on members weighing more than three tons, in a visible
 location.
 460-4.2.2 Match Marking of Members and Assemblies: Match mark all
 connecting members or parts that have been reamed or drilled while assembled. The fabricator
 shall submit a diagram showing all marks and clearly indicate the location of all the marks on the
 shop drawings.
 Use painted marks, attached metal tags, other durable methods which do
 not degrade the finish of the piece, or low-stress type steel die stamps to identify and match mark
 pieces. If steel die stamps are used, they must be blunt nosed or interrupted dot dies,
 manufactured to produce impressions that are rounded at the bottom of the impression. Re-mark
 coated type markings as necessary to maintain continuity in traceability.
 Mark splice plates and girders so that upon erection, the mark on the splice
 plate is located opposite a matching mark on the girder. Place the mark on web splice plates,
 midway down the long side of the plate, on either the right or left side, to correspond with the
 girder to which the splice plate will be temporarily attached for shipping to the erection site.
 Make a matching stamp on the girder web opposite the mark on the splice plate.
 Place the mark on top or bottom flange splice plates, on the right or left
 end of the plate, corresponding to the girder to which the plate will be attached for shipment to
 the erection site. Place a corresponding mark on the girder flange opposite the mark in the splice
 plate.
 As an alternate location for tub girder bottom flange splice plates, place
 the mark midway down the long side of the plate, on either the right or left side, to correspond
 with the girder to which the splice plate will be temporarily attached for shipping to the erection
 site. Make a matching mark on the girder flange opposite the mark on the splice plate.
 Mark girders and beams on the left end, according to the orientation
 shown in the shop drawings, near the top flange. Mark diaphragms in the middle upper portion of
 the web. Mark cross-frames in the middle of the top or bottom horizontal member.
 When heat numbers and other identification marking are applied by die
 stamping to fracture critical members, low stress dies shall be used.
 Low-stress die stamp markings applied to fracture critical members shall
 be placed in locations or zones shown or described in the approved shop drawings. Low-stress or
 compression areas are preferred.
 Ensure that during fabrication, the heat number is maintained on each
 primary load-carrying component by paint until the component is permanently joined into a
 piece marked member or assembly.
 460-4.3 Workmanship:
 460-4.3.1 Cutting, Shearing and Machining: Cutting (including burning and
 sawing), shearing, and machining shall be accomplished in accordance with the
 AASHTO/AWS 1.5, Bridge Welding Code and the following requirements:
 Plane, mill, grind or thermally cut the sheared edges of main load-carrying
 member plate components greater than 5/8 inch thick to a depth of 1/4 inch.
 Cut and fabricate steel plates so that the primary direction of rolling is
 parallel to the direction of the member or component main stress. For flanges and webs, the
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 624
 
 direction of rolling is parallel to the flanges unless noted otherwise in the Contract Documents.
 Web splice plates may be rolled parallel to their length.
 460-4.3.2 Bending:
 460-4.3.2.1 Cold Bending: Fracture critical and non fracture critical
 plates and bars shall be cold bent, unless otherwise permitted according to the provisions of
 Section 460-4.3.2.2.
 The minimum bend radii measured to the concave face of the plate,
 shall be taken as 5.0(t) for all grades and thicknesses of steel conforming to structural steel for
 bridges, AASHTO M270M/M 270 (ASTM A709/A709M), where ‘t’ is the thickness of the plate
 in inches. For cross-frame or diaphragm connection plates up to 0.75 inches, the minimum
 bending radii may be taken as 1.5(t). For all other grades of steel the minimum bend radii
 recommendations from the plate fabricator shall be followed, but the radii shall not be less than
 the minimums specified herein.
 Wherever possible, bend lines shall be oriented perpendicular to
 the direction of final rolling of the plate. If the bend lines are parallel to the direction of final
 rolling, the minimum bend radii shall be increased to 7.5(t).
 460-4.3.2.2 Hot Bending: Fracture critical and non-fracture critical plates
 and bars may be bent hot subject to the approval of the Engineer. Heat-shrink methods as
 described in 460-4.3.4 are also permitted. If hot bending is to be employed, the heating and
 bending procedure shall be submitted for review and approval by the Engineer. The plates and
 bars shall be bent hot at a temperature above the blue brittle temperature of steel (700° F), not to
 exceed the temperature limits in Table 460-2. The minimum radii of the hot bend must satisfy
 the requirements of 460-4.3.2.1.
 460-4.3.3 Straightening: Member components, such as plates, angles or shapes,
 are to be straightened before the parts are assembled. Perform straightening such that no cracking
 or other damage occurs in the part. If heat is to be used for straightening, follow the provisions of
 460-4.3.4.
 460-4.3.4 Heat Application:
 460-4.3.4.1 General: At various points during the fabrication of structural
 steel, applications of heat may be necessary for hot-bending, cambering, curving or
 straightening. Use the temperature limits and guidelines given in this Section, unless alternate
 procedures have been approved by the Engineer. Routine straightening of material other than
 quenched and tempered material shall be done in accordance with the temperature limits and
 guidelines as specified herein, but do not require a submitted procedure.
 Heat curving may be used in conjunction with a cut-curve
 procedure, in which a portion of the curvature is obtained by cutting the plates to all or part of
 the required radius, except as limited by 460-4.3.4.4.
 460-4.3.4.2 Heating Process and Equipment:
 460-4.3.4.2.1 Maximum Temperatures: The maximum allowable
 temperature to which the material can be heated is given in Table 460-2, Maximum Temperature
 Limits for Heat Applications.

 460-4.3.4.2.2 Timing of Heat Applications: Conduct heating
 operations prior to the application of coatings.
 460-4.3.4.2.3 Allowable Preload Stresses: Preload compressive
 stresses will be permitted up to 0.5 times the minimum specified yield strength (Fy) of the
 material. This stress limit is applicable to all steels covered by this specification as listed in
 Table 460-2. If jacks are used, energize and lock off prior to the application of heat.
 460-4.3.4.2.4 Heating Tips: Apply heat using orifice tips only.
 Select tip sizes proportional to the thickness of the heated material.
 460-4.3.4.2.5 Torches: Manipulate the heating torches to guard
 against general and surface overheating. In addition, place heat reflective sheet material against
 the web before applying heat to the inside flange surface. When heating the inside flange surface,
 point the torches to prevent applying heat directly to the web.
 460-4.3.4.2.6 Heating Patterns: Fundamental heating patterns
 (such as vee, line, edge, spot, and strip) may be used separately or in combination. Mark vee and
 strip heat patterns on the material surfaces prior to heating. When heating, bring the steel within
 the planned pattern to the specified heating temperature as rapidly as possible without
 overheating the steel. Apply heat in accordance with the approved procedure.
 460-4.3.4.2.7 Thin Wide Plates: Prevent buckling of thin wide
 plates by not applying excessive heat.
 460-4.3.4.2.8 Verification of Temperatures: Use temperaturesensitive crayons, pyrometers, or infrared non-contact thermometers for verifying temperatures
 during heating operations. When heating patterns are used, make regular verifications of the
 temperatures throughout the pattern. Remove the heating flame from the material before taking
 measurements.
 460-4.3.4.2.9 Cooling: Prior to the use of any artificial cooling,
 allow steel to cool below 600°F. Use only dry compressed air. Do not quench with water or a
 water and air mixture.
 460-4.3.4.2.10 Reheating: Reheat only after the material has
 cooled below 250°F.
 460-4.3.4.2.11 Over Heating: The Engineer may reject the
 product, if any portion of the material is exposed to heating higher than the allowable
 temperature.
 460-4.3.4.3 Heat-Curving of Bridge Members (Weak Axis Shaping):
 460-4.3.4.3.1 General: Rolled beams and girders may be heatcurved at the job site, provided that the heating is performed in accordance with the Engineer’s
 approval.
 460-4.3.4.3.2 Sequence of Operations: Heat curve members prior
 to the attachment of longitudinal stiffeners.
 460-4.3.4.3.3 Web Position: When the radius is less than
 1,000 feet, heat curve members with the web in the horizontal position or preloaded to induce
 stress prior to heating. Otherwise, members may be heat-curved with the web in either the
 vertical or horizontal position.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 626
 
 460-4.3.4.3.4 Subsequent Heats: If multiple locations are to be
 heated, do not reheat the same location until after at least three heats at other locations.
 460-4.3.4.3.5 Locating Heating Patterns: Space the heating
 patterns along the full length of each flange to produce a circular (not parabolic) curvature.
 Adjust the heating patterns to produce the necessary curvature. Compensate for differences in
 flange thickness and width as necessary. Use enough heating patterns in each piece to eliminate
 chording effects.
 460-4.3.4.4 Minimum Radius for Heat-Curving: Heat-curving of beams
 and girders is allowed when the horizontal radius of curvature measured to the centerline of the
 member web is greater than both values calculated by Equations 4.1 and 4.2 below, and greater
 than 150 feet at any and all cross sections throughout the length of the member. Do not heat
 curve steels with a minimum specified yield strength greater than 50 ksi, other than
 ASTM A709, Grade HPS 70W.

 exceeds 30 inches.
 460-4.3.4.5 Heat-Cambering (Strong Axis Shaping):
 460-4.3.4.5.1 General: Procedures for cambering of built-up plate
 girders shall be submitted as a part of the Producer Quality Control (QC) Plan. In the procedures,
 address any proposed preloading and heat application and control. Minor heat adjustments in
 camber at the finishing stage of the girder do not require approval if the patterns and
 temperatures are followed in accordance with the approved procedures.
 Do not utilize heat-cambering as the primary source of
 vertical camber in horizontally curved main load-carrying members; cut the web plate to the
 required position. Only use heat-cambering on horizontally curved main members to adjust cut
 cambering with the approval of the Engineer.
 460-4.3.4.5.2 Web Position: Support members to be heatcambered with the web vertical. Space supports to take maximum advantage of dead load in the
 member prior to the application of heat.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 627
 
 460-4.3.4.5.3 Subsequent Heats: If multiple locations are to be
 heated, do not reheat the same location until after at least three heats at other locations.
 460-4.3.4.5.4 Rolled Beams: Rolled beams may be heat-cambered
 to provide the required curvature at the producing mill. Attach all detail material, such as
 connection plates, bearing stiffeners and gusset plates, after the beam has been heat-cambered.
 460-4.3.4.6 Heat-Straightening Damaged Structural Steel:
 460-4.3.4.6.1 General: Submit procedures for heat-straightening
 for the Engineer’s review prior to beginning the work. Describe in detail the distortion to be
 corrected and all details for preloading, heating, cooling, verifying final dimensions, and
 nondestructive testing.
 460-4.3.4.6.2 Cracking: As a minimum, visually examine all heatstraightened areas. Notify the Engineer when suspected areas of cracking are found. Examine
 these areas by one or more of the following methods, as directed by the Engineer:
 1. Visual examination;
 2. Liquid penetrant examination
 3. Magnetic particle examination
 4. Ultrasonic examination
 5. Radiographic examination
 460-4.3.4.6.3 Restraining Forces: Restraining forces (usually
 jacks) shall be set to restrain the steel during heating, but allow free contraction during cooling.
 In addition, apply the restraining forces in a direction tending to restore the member and limit the
 magnitude so that the material is not overstressed during heating.
 460-4.3.4.6.4 Heating: Heat the steel in a single pass following the
 specified pattern and allow it to cool to below 250°F prior to reheating. Select heating patterns
 and sequences appropriate for the type of damage and shape of the cross section. Simultaneous
 vee heats may be used provided the clear spacing between vees is greater than the width of the
 plate element.
 460-4.3.4.6.5 Subsequent Repair: Heat cambered members
 damaged after cambering may be repaired. However, do not repair previously heat-straightened
 members in the same region of damage without the approval of the Engineer.
 460-4.3.4.7 Heat Treatment:
 460-4.3.4.7.1 General: When any special form of heat treatment is
 required, it will be described in the Contract Documents. Perform heat treatments prior to any
 boring, machining or straightening operations.
 460-4.3.4.7.2 Stress Relief: Where required, perform thermal
 stress relief in accordance with the procedure outlined in the AASHTO/AWS D1.5, Bridge
 Welding Code. Provide welding materials consistent with the stress relieving process utilized.
 460-4.3.4.7.3 Normalizing and Annealing: Where required by the
 Contract Documents, perform normalizing and annealing as defined in ASTM A941. Maintain
 temperatures uniformly throughout the furnace during heating and cooling so that the
 temperatures at any points on the member do not differ by more than 130°F.
 460-4.3.4.8 Contact and Bearing Surfaces: Provide surface finishes of
 bearings, base plates, and other contact surfaces in accordance with the ANSI surface roughness
 requirements as defined in ANSI B46.1, Surface Roughness, Waviness and Lay, Part I, given in
 Table 460-5, ANSI Surface Roughness Requirements.

 460-4.3.5.2 Holes, Tolerances and Quality: Make bolt (and anchor rod)
 holes using any method suitable to the Fabricator and as specified below; except holes for high
 strength fasteners in main or primary load-carrying members which are not to be punched full
 size, but may be thermally cut in accordance with 460-4.3.5.4 and ground smooth with the
 approval of the Engineer.
 The misalignment of holes in a bolt group relative to the same
 holes in the component or components it is joined to in a connection, shall not exceed 1/32 inch
 for 85% of the bolt holes in that group. Bolt holes are to be normal to the work and have no tears,
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 629
 
 cracks, fins, dirt, loose rust, burrs or other anomalies, and the surface is to be flat within a slope
 of 1/20. Bolt holes are to be round within plus or minus 1/32 inch and within plus or minus 1/32
 inch of the specified size. For subsize holes, a pin 1/8 inch smaller than the subsize holes must be
 able to pass through all assembled plies in at least 75% of the locations prior to reaming. Holes
 inclined more than 3 degrees to a surface in any direction must have a hardened beveled washer
 provided at that face. Unless specified elsewhere in the Contract Documents, it is not required to
 coat the inside of the bolt holes.
 460-4.3.5.3 Slotted Holes: Slots may be made by a single punch, or by
 joining two adjacent drilled or punched holes when punching is permitted. When joining holes,
 thermal cutting is to follow the common tangent to the two holes, and this cut is to be ground. Do
 not make slotted holes more than 1/32 inch in width nor 1/16 inch greater in length than
 specified. Grind smooth any flame cut portions of the slot to ANSI 1000 micro-inches.
 460-4.3.5.4 Holes in Plates Not Subjected to Tensile Stress: Large
 diameter holes in heavy plates not subjected to tensile stress (such as bearing plates) and slotted
 holes in materials not subject to tensile stress may be thermally cut, followed by appropriate
 grinding to smooth the periphery. Stop the practice if gouges or other defects occur, or if directed
 by the Engineer. These holes are to meet the following criteria:
 Do not thermally cut holes in ASTM A709, GradeHPS 100W steel.
 Provide hole centerlines aligned within plus or minus 1/16 inch of theoretical. The inside (cut)
 faces of the hole are to be perpendicular to the plane of the plate. Eighty-five percent of the
 (open) hole diameter is not to exceed that specified in the Contract Documents, plus or minus
 1/16 inch. Local notches, gouges or the maximum diameter shall not exceed that specified in the
 Contract Documents plus or minus 3/32 inch.
 460-4.3.5.5 Punching: Material forming parts of a member composed of
 five thicknesses or less of metal may be punched full-size. When more than five thicknesses of
 material are joined, material shall be subdrilled or subpunched and then reamed full-size, or
 drilled full-size while in assembly. Subpunched or subdrilled holes, when required, must be at
 least 3/16 inches smaller than the finished hole size.
 Holes in cross frames, lateral bracing components, and the
 corresponding holes in connection plates between girders and cross frames or lateral components
 may be punched full size. Holes in longitudinal main load-carrying members, transverse
 floorbeams, and any components designated as fracture critical (FCMs) shall not be punched
 full-size.
 460-4.3.5.6 Edge Distance: Provide minimum as-fabricated distance from
 the center of a bolt hole to an edge as given in Table 460-4, Edge Distances, unless otherwise

 460-4.3.5.7 Bolted Splice Gaps: Unless shown elsewhere in the Contract
 Documents, the tolerance for bolted splice gaps (open distance face-of-web/flange to face-ofweb/flange) shall be from zero (no gap between faces) to a maximum of 1/8 inch greater than the
 gap shown on the Contract Plans. If no gap is shown in the Contract Plans, assume that a
 nominal gap of 3/8 inch is required. In addition, meet the edge distance requirements, provided
 above.
 460-4.3.5.8 Maximum Edge Distance: Unless otherwise specified in the
 Contract Documents, the maximum fabricated distance from any edge to the center of the hole
 shall be 8 times the thickness of the thinnest outside plate, not to exceed 5 inches with no
 additional tolerance allowed.
 460-4.3.5.9 Spacing of Bolt Holes: Space bolt holes within plus or minus
 3/16 inch of that shown in the Contract Documents.
 460-4.3.5.10 Holding of Plies: When drilling or reaming is accomplished
 through multiple plies of material, do not hold the materials together by welds not specified in
 the Contract Drawings.
 460-4.4 Member Geometry:
 460-4.4.1 General:
 460-4.4.1.1 Tolerances: Provide dimensional tolerances as follows:
 1. Rolled shapes, plates, bars, wide flange sections and
 miscellaneous steel in accordance with ASTM A6;
 2. Fabricate girders in accordance with the AASHTO/AWS D1.5,
 Bridge Welding Code and as described below;
 3. For built-up members not specifically covered by
 AASHTO/AWS D1.5, apply AASHTO/AWS D1.5, Bridge Welding Code, except as noted
 below or as directed by the Engineer.
 460-4.4.1.2 Camber and Sweep: Tolerances for camber and sweep of
 continuous and simply supported girders of any shape shall be as described in the
 AASHTO/AWS D1.5, Bridge Welding Code. The camber and sweep tolerances for steel pier
 caps shall be the same as those specified for girders. Measure sweep for horizontally curved
 members from the theoretical centerline for comparison to the aforementioned requirements.
 460-4.4.1.3 Alternate Sections: Rolled sections or fabricated sections of
 equal or slightly greater dimensions than the section specified may be proposed for the
 Engineer’s approval. Changes that reduce fatigue resistance or significantly affect splice design
 or deflection will require complete design calculations.
 460-4.4.1.4 Web Flatness: Maximum deviation from flatness for webs of
 curved and/or cambered sections shall be the same as for straight built-up girders. Measure
 curved girder web flatness using a straightedge oriented perpendicular to the flanges (“vertical”,
 flange to flange).
 460-4.4.1.5 Girder Length: If measuring girder length with a device that
 is free of thermal effects, appropriately adjust the measurements to the reference temperature
 shown in the Contract Documents. Measure the length of horizontally curved girders along the
 arc.

 approval. Prior to submitting these tolerance values for approval, coordinate between the Erector
 and the Fabricator.
 460-4.4.2.1.2 Bearings: Unless otherwise specified in the Contract
 Documents, each bearing is to be true to a tolerance of 1/32 inch across its entire width in either
 direction.
 460-4.4.2.1.3 Beam Trueness: Unless otherwise specified in the
 Contract Documents, the plane of beam supports on the box girder (the bearing area specifically
 attached to the box girder) is to be true to the box girder bearing within 1/16 inch in the short
 direction and true to the vertical axis of the nesting girders (those girders attached to or resting
 on the box girder) within 1/16 inch.
 460-4.4.2.2 Trapezoidal Bridge Members: As a minimum, trapezoidal
 bridge members (tub or box girders) shall meet AASHTO/AWS D1.5, Bridge Welding Code
 dimensional tolerances. Camber may be verified with the girder in its upright position, supported
 to avoid dead load deflections.
 460-4.4.2.3 Pinholes: Unless shown elsewhere in the Contract
 Documents, bore pinholes:
 1. True to the specified diameter;
 2. Smooth to ANSI 3 (125 micro-inches);
 3. At right angles with the axis of the member;
 4. Parallel with each other; and
 5. With a diameter of the pinhole not exceeding that of the pin by
 more than 0.015 inch for pins 5 inches or less in diameter, or 1/32 inch for larger pins.
 460-4.4.2.4 Truss Chord Joints: Abutting joints in truss chords not
 specified to be mill-to-bear shall have openings of 1/4 inch, plus or minus 1/8 inch.
 Abutting joints in truss chords specified to be mill-to-bear shall be
 faced and brought into bearing. When assembled, provide 85% or more of the abutting surfaces
 in full contact. Allowable visible gaps shall not exceed 1/64 inch.
 460-4.4.2.5 Horizontally Curved Beams and Skewed Steel Girders:
 Account for torsion induced deflections for horizontally curved beams and skewed steel girders.
 Unless otherwise defined in the Contract Documents, a horizontally curved beam or girder is a
 longitudinal or transverse bridge component with a radius less than 10,000 feet anywhere along
 its continuous length.
 460-4.5 Shop Assembly:
 460-4.5.1 General: Ensure the fit of all connections and the geometry of all
 components. Unless specified elsewhere in the Contract Documents, check the fit of all
 longitudinal girder/beam lines in accordance with 460-4.5.1.1. Perform this prior to transporting
 the pieces in question to the site for erection.
 460-4.5.1.1 Progressive Girder or Truss Assembly: Assemble the
 structure for a minimum of three spans, panels, field sections, segments or longitudinal chords of
 the structure. Successive assemblies shall consist of at least one longitudinal segment of the
 previous assembly, repositioned as necessary for accurate alignment, plus two or more
 longitudinal segments added at the advancing end. For entire structures less than 150 feet in
 length or less than three segments, assemble the entire longitudinal line. Meet the requirements
 of 460-4.5.1.4 when utilizing computer-numerically-controlled drilling equipment.
 When a transverse structural steel member or members is required
 for the continuation of the uninterrupted girder or beam line, truss, arch rib, bent tower face or

 rigid frame, and is designated elsewhere in the Contract Documents to be shop assembled, the
 Fabricator may include this member or component in a separate subassembly and not the three
 segment longitudinal assembly (discussed above). If combined in a different subassembly,
 include the longitudinal member(s) or component(s), as designated elsewhere in the Contract
 Documents to be shop assembled, that frame directly into the transverse structural member. Do
 not include the transverse member(s) in the longitudinal assembly unless directed so elsewhere
 in the Contract Documents or by the Engineer. Account for end rotations and deflections as
 necessary, and submit the procedure to the Engineer for review.
 460-4.5.1.2 Progressive Chord Assembly: When specified elsewhere in
 the Contract Documents, assemble the truss chords for a minimum of three panels or longitudinal
 segments of the structure. Successive assemblies shall consist of at least one longitudinal
 segment of the previous assembly, repositioned as necessary for accurate alignment, plus two or
 more longitudinal segments added at the advancing end. For entire structures less than 150 feet
 in length or less than three segments, assemble the entire longitudinal line. Meet the
 requirements of 460-4.5.1.4 when using computer-numerically-controlled drilling equipment.
 Account for transverse members indicted elsewhere in the Contract
 Documents to be included in the shop assembly as in 460-4.5.1.1.
 When assembled in accordance with this subsection, the holes of
 the connections will be so located that they will be drilled to the final geometric angles. This will
 require that the truss members, when erected under the no load (or practically no load or stress)
 condition, must be bent and forced to fit the end conditions. This condition will introduce an
 initial reverse secondary stress that will theoretically wane when the structure assumes the
 loading for which it is cambered. Submit the procedure to the Engineer for review.
 460-4.5.1.3 Special Complete Structure Assembly: When specified
 elsewhere in the Contract Documents, this type of shop assembly will include assembling the
 entire structure including the diaphragms, cross frames, integral steel substructure and floor
 components. Miscellaneous components are not included unless directed elsewhere in the
 Contract Documents. Establish procedures for each structure or structure type including
 consideration of incremental erection, temporary field support locations, stage construction and
 final tightening of field connections. Submit the procedures for review by the Engineer.
 460-4.5.1.4 Computer-Numerically-Controlled (CNC) Drilling
 Associated with Progressive Girder, Truss or Chord Assembly: If the Fabricator chooses to
 drill the holes in all plies of all connections of the continuous main girder or beam line, truss,
 arch rib, bent, tower face or rigid frame and any intersecting (transverse) members utilizing
 computer-controlled-numerical drilling procedures, piece-wise assembly of the entire continuous
 girder or beam line, truss, arch rib, bent, tower face or rigid frame is not required if the following
 requirements are met:
 Prior to transporting to the site, perform a check fit of the first
 three spans, panels, field sections, segments or longitudinal chords; or entire first bent, tower
 face or rigid frame of the structure to ensure the accuracy of the CNC procedures and equipment.
 As selected by and at the discretion of the Engineer and prior to
 transporting to the site, perform another check fit of a different assembly of three spans, panels,
 field sections, segments or longitudinal chords; or another entire bent, tower face or rigid frame
 of the structure to ensure that the accuracy of the CNC procedures and equipment is maintained.
 If either of the above fails to meet the Contract requirements, assemble the entire girder or beam
 line, truss, arch rib, bent, tower face or rigid frame as originally prescribed in 460-4.5.1.1 or 460-

 4.5.1.2 as prescribed elsewhere in the Contract Documents. Account for transverse members
 indicated elsewhere in the Contract Documents to be included in the shop assembly as in 4604.5.1.1.
 460-4.6 Evaluation of Work: The Engineer will evaluate and accept materials and work
 conforming to the Contract Documents. These evaluations may take place prior to or following
 delivery of the materials to the site of the structure. Materials or work that fails to meet Contract
 requirements will be rejected.
 The Engineer may, at his sole discretion, permit further inspections and testing of
 materials or work that fail to meet Contract requirements for acceptance. The cost of such
 inspections and tests shall be borne by the Contractor.
 Bring to the attention of the Engineer, all nonconforming work and or materials
 that cannot be brought into conformance with the Contract Documents using pre-established
 procedures as outlined in the Department approved Producer QC Plan. Submit the following
 information to the Engineer:
 A cover letter prepared on the Contractor’s letterhead and addressed to the
 Engineer briefly describing the nonconforming work and the proposed credit to the Contract
 proportionate to the nonconformance. For each fabricating facility and for each project within
 that fabrication facility, submittals must be numbered consecutively beginning with the number
 1, at the start of each project. Erectors will start with one for each individual project.
 A completed Department Nonconforming Structural Steel and Miscellaneous
 Metal Component Data Sheet prepared by the Contractor and countersigned by the Engineer’s
 designated representative to indicate agreement between the Contractor and the Department
 regarding the nonconformance, not any solution, resolution or credit. If the Contractor and the
 Engineer’s designated representative are not in agreement regarding the nonconformance, the
 Engineer’s designated representative will either reject the submittal indicating the reason(s) for
 the rejection or modify the submittal and forward to the Engineer. In the event of modification,
 the Contractor will initial the submittal before being forwarded to the Engineer, thereby
 indicating the Contractor’s concurrence with the modification.
 A list of supporting information such as sketches, documentation, calculations,
 pictures, etc., must be included in the appropriate space on the Nonconforming Component Data
 Sheet. Supporting information regarding Contract Document noncompliance in the form of
 separate documents is only necessary when space on the Department Nonconforming Structural
 Steel and Miscellaneous Metal Component Data Sheet is inadequate for the required data. All of
 the supporting information required for the form must be prepared by, or under the supervision
 of, the Specialty Engineer who will sign and seal the supporting information.
 If requested by the Engineer, submit a structural and durability evaluation of the
 proposed repair and/or remediation. This evaluation must be conducted under the supervision of
 a Specialty Engineer and the submittal is to bear the Specialty Engineer’s signature and seal.
 460-4.7 Member or Component Certification: Coordinate with the Engineer to
 schedule final inspection of the completed work within two weeks prior to shipment or erection
 to verify that all Contract Document requirements have been met. After verification that all
 Contract Document requirements have been met and all necessary repairs have been
 satisfactorily completed, the Quality Control Manager shall certify, by initials and/or signature,
 such materials, components or members. The record shall include certification for:

 1.Items being shipped or stored prior to final assembly. Affix a certification in the
 form of a stamp or tag in accordance with 460-4.2 and as indicated in the Producer Q C Plan, and
 with a copy of the certification placed in the Contractor’s permanent project records,
 2. Work being placed into its final position. Document in the Contractor’s
 permanent project records.
 Submit a summary certification at the least once a month or with each payment
 request that includes the following or similar wording. “The undersigned, being a responsible
 official of (insert Contractor identification) certifies that the materials, components or members
 listed herein have been produced under strict quality control and meet the requirements of the
 Contract Documents” Include a positive identification in the certification such that the applicable
 materials, components and/or members can be uniquely identified utilizing just the summary
 certification document. The Quality Control Manager shall sign this summary certification.
 460-5 Bolted Connections.
 460-5.1 General: High strength bolts are described as follows:
 1. ASTM F3125 Grade A325 or as Grade A325
 2. ASTM F3125 Grade A490 or as Grade A490
 Use bolts as follows:
 1. Use galvanized Grade A325 Type 1 bolts in all field installed bolted
 structural steel connections for painted steel.
 2. Use either black or galvanized Grade A325 Type 1 bolts in all shop
 installed bolted structural steel connections that will be shop painted.
 3. Use black Grade A325 Type 3 bolts in all bolted structural steel
 connections for weathering steel that is to remain unpainted.
 4. Use the bolts as specified for connected assemblies or parts that are
 designated as miscellaneous components where the fastener type is specified elsewhere in the
 Contract Documents.
 Tighten Grade A325 bolts in accordance with the procedures specified below for
 turn-of-nut or direct-tension-indicator (DTI) tightening.
 Lubricate and maintain consistency in lubrication of fastener assembly during
 Rotational Capacity (RC) testing and installation. Assemblies that exhibit a loss of lubrication, as
 determined by the Engineer, may be re-lubricated and retested prior to installation.
 Use Grade A490 bolts only with the approval of the Engineer. Submit procedures
 in accordance with ASTM F3125 Grade A490 for the handling, lubrication, installation,
 tightening and testing of such bolts. Do not install Grade A490 bolts without prior approval of
 the procedures by the Engineer.
 When the Engineer approves ASTM A307 bolts for use in miscellaneous
 components, tighten them such that the plies of the joint are in firm contact. Use three to five
 impacts of an impact wrench or the full effort of a person using an ordinary spud wrench to
 obtain a snug connection.
 Fasten aluminum, other materials or assemblies of dissimilar materials in
 accordance with the Contract Documents.
 Install ordinary rough or machine bolts and nuts in accordance with the Contract
 Documents.
 460-5.2 Testing:
 460-5.2.1 Rotational Capacity (RC) Tests: At the location of and prior to
 installation of permanent high-strength fasteners in main or primary load-carrying member
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 635
 
 connections, perform RC tests in accordance with FM 5-581 (for long bolts) or FM 5-582 (for
 short bolts) to ensure that the fasteners are capable of developing the specified strength and that
 the fasteners are properly lubricated. As a minimum, test two assemblies per LOT designation.
 The bolt, nut and washer shall come from the same LOT and be packed in the same container (or
 group of containers assigned the same LOT), except in special cases where nuts and washers
 have only one production LOT number for each size.
 Short bolts may also be tested using FM 5-583 with DTIs calibrated with
 long bolts installed in a Tension Measuring Device.
 Washers are required for RC tests even though they may not be required
 for jobsite installation. Where washers are not required for jobsite installation, LOT
 identification is not required. The washer coating shall be the same as that for the bolt and nut.
 If any of the required tests fails, the entire LOT will be rejected.
 460-5.2.2 Verification of Direct Tension Indicator (DTI) Device Performance:
 On a daily basis (when DTI devices are being installed) and at the location of installation,
 perform DTI Verification tests in accordance with FM 5-583. Perform this test on a minimum of
 two high-strength fastener assemblies from each fastener assembly LOT and position of the DTI
 prior to production installation. If either assembly fails, test additional fastener assembly
 LOT/DTI combinations as requested by the Engineer to verify that the Requirements of the
 Contract Documents have been satisfied. These two tests are in addition to the RC tests required
 in 460-5.2.1. If, after additional testing, the DTI fails to meet the requirements of FM 5-583, the
 LOT will be rejected by the Engineer.
 460-5.3 Reuse and Retightening: Do not reuse Grade A490 bolts or galvanized
 Grade A325 bolts. Black Grade A325 bolts with free spinning nuts may be reused one time with
 the Engineer’s approval. Previously tightened bolts that may have been loosened by the
 tightening of adjacent bolts can be further tightened from the original position. Ensure proper
 lubrication prior to retightening. Discard and replace fractured or damaged bolts.
 460-5.4 Assembly of Bolted Connections:
 460-5.4.1 General: Verify that the faying surfaces are in accordance with the
 Contract Documents, are free of dirt or other foreign materials, and that the geometry of the bolt
 holes and the connection meets the requirements of 460-4.3.5.
 Install fastener assembly components of the same LOT and of the size and
 quality specified in the Contract Documents. Provide final bolts, cylindrical erection pins or
 other fit-up bolts as indicated in the Erection Plan.
 When it is impractical to turn the nut, tighten the fastener by turning the
 bolt while preventing the nut from rotating. During this tightening operation, do not allow the
 rotation of the part of the fastener assembly not turned by the wrench.
 460-5.4.2 Preparation of Faying Surfaces: Provide coated and non-coated
 faying surfaces in accordance with the Contract Documents. Faying surfaces specified as blastcleaned must satisfy SSPC SP-10 ‘Near-White Blast Cleaning.’
 When painting of the slip-critical faying surface of bolted connections is
 required, use only the prime coat. Prepare and coat the faying surfaces prior to installation of the
 fasteners. Provide certification of the slip critical classification required in the Contract
 Documents.
 Submit certification to the Engineer that galvanized faying surfaces meet
 or exceed a Class C slip critical classification, unless a different classification is required
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 636
 
 elsewhere in the Contract Documents. Mechanically roughen galvanized faying surfaces in
 accordance with the galvanizer’s recommendations.
 460-5.4.3 Reaming: Do not over size bolt holes by reaming (or any other
 method) without the approval of the Engineer.
 460-5.4.4 Drifting: Do not over size, stretch or otherwise damage bolt holes by
 improper and excessive drifting.
 460-5.4.5 Splice Plate Filler Material: Unless otherwise specified in the
 Contract Documents, provide filler material edges within 1/8 inch of the adjacent splice material
 edge. Where required for proper alignment at a bolted flange splice, additional filler material
 may be added provided that the total thickness of filler plates is less than 1/4 inch.
 460-5.4.6 Installation of Fastener Assemblies: Unless shown otherwise in the
 Erection Plan, install the bolts of the connection by progressing systematically from the most
 rigid part of the connection to the free edges. Install bolts in all holes of the connection and bring
 them to a “snug tight” condition. Following the sequence indicated in the Erection Plan, further
 tighten all the bolts in the connection.
 For Grade A325 bolts, obtain the required bolt tension as shown in
 Table 460-6, Minimum Required Fastener Tension in accordance with the turn-of-nut method
 specified in 460-5.4.8, or when DTIs are used, the DTI tightening method specified in 460-5.4.9.
 For connections (such as large main load-carrying members or truss joints)
 in which previously tightened high strength bolts become loose and require retightening upon the
 tensioning of others, install into a minimum of ten percent of the holes fully tensioned bolts prior
 to final tensioning of the permanent bolts. Distribute these first bolts randomly throughout the
 connection. If directed by the Engineer, remove the initial bolts and install permanent bolts at
 each location, otherwise retighten in accordance with 460-5.3.

 460-5.4.7 Bolt Tension: Provide a Skidmore-Wilhelm Calibrator, or other
 equivalent bolt tension measuring device, wherever final connections are being made. Confirm
 the accuracy of the tension measuring device by having it calibrated by an approved testing
 agency once a year.
 460-5.4.8 Turn-of-Nut Tightening: For each work shift, perform tests utilizing a
 representative sample of five fastener assemblies, from each LOT to be installed that shift.
 Perform the tests using the tension measuring device, following the same procedure to be used
 for actual installation of the fastener assemblies, to a snug-tight tension and corresponding

 torque, which, when the additional turns required in Table 460-7, Nut Rotation from the SnugTight Condition are added, will result in at least 1.05 times the minimum required fastener
 installation tension as shown in Table 460-6. Place a washer under the part turned in the
 tightening of the bolt. Consider the job inspection snug-tight torque as the average of three test
 values determined after rejecting the high and low-test values.
 For fastener assemblies too short to fit in the tension measuring device,
 modify the determination of the job inspection snug-tight torque in accordance with FM 5-582.
 460-5.4.8.1 Snug-Tight Condition: In the turn-of-nut method, first bring
 all the fastener assemblies of the connection to a “snug-tight” condition to ensure that all parts of
 the connection are in firm contact with each other. For the purposes of this specification, “firm
 contact” shall mean the condition that exists on a faying surface when the plies are solidly seated
 against each other, but not necessarily in continuous contact. Regard snug-tight as the tightness
 required to produce the bolt tension, which following the final applied rotation, produces at least
 1.05 times the minimum required bolt tension in accordance with Table 460-6, Minimum
 Required Fastener Tension. In the presence of the Engineer, and on a daily basis, determine the
 job inspection snug-tight torque as specified herein.
 460-5.4.8.2 Final Tightening: After verification of the snug-tight
 condition in accordance with 460-5.4.11 by the Engineer, tighten all fastener assemblies in the
 joint by applying the applicable amount of nut rotation specified in Table 460-7, Nut Rotation
 from the Snug-Tight Condition. Once snug-tight, bring all fasteners to the required tension
 within the same work shift.

 Notes:
 1. Nut rotation is relative to the bolt, regardless of the element being turned.
 2. Tolerance for bolts installed by 1/2 turn or less is ± 30 degrees. For bolts installed by 2/3 turn or more, the tolerance is ± 45
 degrees.
 3. Nut rotations given are only applicable to connections in which all material within the grip of the bolt is steel.
 4. For bolt lengths exceeding 12 diameters, establish the required rotation by performing actual tests in a suitable tension device
 simulating the actual conditions. Submit procedures to the Engineer for review.
 
 460-5.4.9 Direct-Tension-Indicator (DTI) Tightening: After complying with
 the requirements of 460-5.2.2, install and tighten DTI devices following the procedures

 described in the DTI Verification Test. Do not permit the DTI to turn during installation and
 tightening. Provide washers in accordance with 460-5.4.10.
 460-5.4.9.1 Snug-Tight Condition: Install the bolts as specified through
 Step 3 (Snug-Tight Condition) of the DTI Verification test. If the 0.005 inch feeler gage is
 refused in more gaps than shown in the table in Step 3.5 of the test, or the DTI device becomes
 loose and can be spun by hand, remove the bolt and DTI device, discarding the DTI device.
 Provide a new DTI device and reinstall the assembly and bring to the snug-tight condition.
 460-5.4.9.2 Final Tightening: After verification by the Engineer that the
 snug-tight condition for all bolts has been met, tighten all fastener assemblies in the joint such
 that the number of spaces in which the 0.005 inch thickness gauge is refused is equal to or
 greater than the number shown in Table 460-8, DTI Device Tightening Criteria. Once snug-tight,
 bring all fasteners to the required tension within the same work shift.

 460-5.4.10 Washers:
 460-5.4.10.1 General: Provide ASTM F436 hardened steel washers as
 follows:
 1. For connections (and all associated testing) using Grade A490
 bolts, use a hardened washer under each element.
 2. For connections using Grade A325 bolts, use hardened washers
 under the turned element.
 3. Use hardened steel washers as part of the Rotational Capacity
 tests.
 4. Where the outer face of the bolted parts has a slope of greater
 than 20:1 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis, use a hardened, beveled washer to
 compensate for the lack of parallelism.
 5. Where bolts are to be installed in a oversized or slotted hole in
 an outer ply, provide a single washer satisfying ASTM F436, or continuous bar satisfying
 ASTM A709: for Grade A325 bolts, provide a thickness of at least 5/16 inch; and for
 Grade A490 bolts, provide a thickness of 3/8 inch. Provide these washers or bars to completely
 cover the slot after installation. Provide a finish consistent with the bolt specified.
 6. In non-Direct-Tension-Indicator (DTI) applications, clip
 washers on one side to a point not closer than 7/8 of the bolt diameter from the center of the
 washer, if necessary.
 460-5.4.10.2 Use of Washers with Direct-Tension-Indicators (DTIs)
 Devices: When DTIs are used; use ASTM F436 hardened washers as follows:
 1. When the nut is turned and the DTI is located under the bolt
 head, a hardened washer is to be located under the nut.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 639
 
 2. When the nut is turned and the DTI is located under the nut, a
 hardened washer is to be located between the nut and the DTI.
 3. When the bolt head is turned and the DTI is located under the
 nut, a hardened washer is to be located under the bolt head.
 4. When the bolt head is turned and the DTI is located under the
 bolt head, a hardened washer is to be located between the bolt head and the DTI.
 460-5.4.11 Inspection:
 460-5.4.11.1 Turn-of-Nut Tightening:
 1. Once the snug-tight condition is achieved for all of the fastener
 assemblies of the connection, within 24 hours of snugging the first bolt in the connection and in
 the presence of the Engineer, verify for a minimum of three (3) bolts [two (2) for two bolt
 connections] or 10% of the fastener assemblies, that the job inspection snug-tight torque has
 been attained. These fasteners are to have a snug-tight torque equal to or exceeding that specified
 in 460-5.4.8. Perform this check using the same torque wrench used in 460-5.4.8. For bolts tested
 in accordance with FM 5-583 or when multiple torque wrenches are required, provide a
 calibrated torque wrench or wrenches.
 2. If the tested fasteners do not obtain the job inspection snug-tight
 torque, test all remaining untested fastener assemblies using the torque wrench in the connection
 in question. Following testing of all assemblies, bring to snug-tight all assemblies and retest as
 stated above. Re-snug and retest as necessary using the calibrated torque wrench until the
 minimum testing stated above is performed favorably.
 3. Following confirmation of the snug-tight condition as performed
 by the Contractor, and in the presence of the Engineer, match mark the fastener assemblies on
 the end of the bolt thread and on the nut, and then tighten the nut the amount of rotation specified
 in Table 460-7, Nut Rotation from the Snug-Tight Condition. The Engineer will accept the
 connection as fully tightened when all of the following conditions are met:
 a. the rotation specified in Table 460-7 has been achieved,
 b. there are no loose assemblies in the connection,
 c. all plies of the connection are in firm contact,
 d. there are no indications that excessive stretching or
 yielding has occurred in the fastener assembly,
 e. bolt stick-through is consistent per LOT.
 460-5.4.11.2 Direct-Tension-Indicator (DTI) Tightening: Prior to
 bringing the connection to a snug-tight condition, verify in the presence of the Engineer that the
 ‘dimples’ of the DTI are not deformed or damaged. Bring the connection to a snug-tight
 condition and tighten in accordance with the requirements of 460-5.4.9. The Engineer will accept
 the connection as fully tightened when all of the following conditions are met:
 1. The requirements of 460-5.4.9 have been achieved,
 2. There are no loose assemblies in the connection,
 3. All plies of the connection are in firm contact,
 4. There are no indications that excessive stretching or yielding has
 occurred in the fastener assembly,
 5. Bolt stick-through is consistent per LOT.

 prepare the top of concrete pad (bearing area) in accordance with Section 400. If a discrepancy is
 identified, report it to the Engineer for resolution.
 For expansion bearings with slotted holes for anchor rods, which allow movement
 of the superstructure with respect to the substructure, vary the location of the slotted plate in
 relation to the anchor rods, in accordance with the prevailing temperature at the time of setting.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 643
 
 For fixed bearings at multiple adjacent piers, if necessary, horizontally jack the
 substructure units to correctly set the centerline of bearing. Adequately account for temperature.
 Unless specified elsewhere in the Contract Documents, locate the theoretical
 centerline of bearings to within 1/16 inch transverse to longitudinal girder lines; and in the
 direction parallel to the longitudinal girder line locate the theoretical centerline of bearing within
 1/4 inch of the theoretical centerline of bearing.
 After setting the bearings and installing anchor rod nuts, washers and any other
 associated hardware specified in the Contract Documents, clean the protruding/exposed surfaces
 of the assembly of all deleterious material. Finish-coat metal parts in accordance with 4604.3.4.9.
 460-7.6 Tightening of Anchor Bolt/Rod Nuts:
 460-7.6.1 Fixed and Expansion Pot Bearing: Tighten anchor bolts or rod nuts to
 a ‘snug tight’ condition such that the different mating surfaces (such as the top of concrete,
 neoprene and steel) are in firm contact. The nut or bolt is to be tight enough to develop friction
 between surfaces to prevent sliding, but not over-tightened that bulging or damage occurs in any
 of the mating materials.
 460-7.6.2 Fixed and Expansion Bearings with Elastomeric Bearing Pads:
 Draw down the lower nut such that a total gap of 1/2 inch exists between the nut and bearing
 plate. Tighten a second nut of the same specification to a snug tight condition against the lower
 nut maintaining the required gap.
 460-7.7 Bolted Connections: For splice connections of primary members, as well as
 connections of diaphragms or crossframes, fill at least 50% of the holes prior to crane release.
 The 50% may be either erection bolts in a snug tight condition or full size erection pins, but at
 least half (25% of all holes) shall be bolts, and sufficient pins shall be used near outside corners
 of splice plates and at member ends near splice plate edges to ensure alignment. Filled holes
 should be uniformly distributed between the web and flange connections for primary members
 such that approximately 50% of the web connections are filled and approximately 50% of the
 flange connections are filled. For diaphragms or cross-frames, the filled holes should be
 uniformly distributed between all the bolt groups connecting the diaphragm or crossframe to the
 primary member. The 50% requirement may be waived if a reduced percentage is calculated as
 sufficient and shown on the approved Erection Plan. Primary member splice connections that are
 made up on the ground (prior to erection) shall be 100 percent complete prior to any lifting
 operation. Fully tighten all bolts prior to installation of deck forming for each unit.
 460-7.8 Final Position of Girder Webs: Unless shown elsewhere in the Contract
 Documents, detail the girders and cross frames as directed by the Engineer. The final condition is
 to be defined as with the deck and parapets cast, but without any future wearing surface. A web
 will be considered plumb if it is within a tolerance horizontally between the top and bottom of
 the web of 3/32 inch per foot of web depth compared against the theoretical position as required
 in the Contract Documents. Measure the out-of-plumb perpendicular to the face of the web. Erect
 trapezoidal girders to the geometry shown in the Contract Documents to the same 3/32 inch per
 foot of web depth tolerance.
 460-7.9 Inspection and Final Acceptance:

 rust, rust pits, scale, oil, and other deleterious matter which would adversely affect the welding
 operation.
 502-4.4 Weather Limitations: Do not weld when the base metal temperature is below
 0ºF, or when the surface is wet or exposed to rain or snow.
 502-4.5 Position of Welding Gun: While operating, hold the welding gun in position
 without movement until the weld metal has solidified.
 502-4.6 Preparation of Areas: Prepare the surface where studs are to be welded by wirebrushing, peening, prick-punching, grinding, or other approved methods to remove paint, scale,
 rust, oils, or other deleterious matter which would adversely affect the welding operation.
 502-4.7 Spacing: Ensure that longitudinal and lateral spacing of studs with respect to
 each other and to edges of beam or girder flanges does not vary more than 1/2 inch from the
 dimensions shown in the Plans. However, the Engineer will allow a variation of 1 inch where
 required to avoid interference with other attachments on the beam or where welding a new stud
 to replace a defective stud. Provide a minimum distance of 1 inch from the edge of a stud to the
 edge of a beam, but where possible provide at least 1-1/2 inches.
 502-4.8 Testing: After allowing them to cool, bend the first two studs welded on each
 beam or girder, 45 degrees by striking the stud with a hammer. If failure occurs in the weld of
 either stud, correct the procedure, and weld and test two successive studs successfully before
 welding any more studs to the beam or girder. Inform the Engineer of any changes in the welding
 procedure at any time during construction. When the temperature of the base metal is below
 32ºF, bend one stud in each 100 studs welded 45 degrees in addition to the first two bent as
 specified above.

 502-4.9 Repair of Welds: The Contractor may repair studs, on which a full 360 degrees
 weld is not obtained, in accordance with the procedures of ANSI/AASHTO/AWS D1.5, Bridge
 Welding Code.
 502-4.10 Reduction in Height: If the reduction in the height of studs as they are welded
 becomes less than 1/16 inch, immediately stop welding and correct the cause. Do not resume
 welding until the cause has been corrected.
 502-4.11 Replacing Studs: Before welding the replacement stud, remove the defective
 stud, grind the area smooth and flush or, in the case of a pullout of metal, fill the pocket with
 weld metal, using the shielded metal-arc process with low-hydrogen welding electrodes, and then
 grind flush. In compression areas of flanges, the Contractor may weld a new stud adjacent to the
 defective area in lieu of repair and replacement of the existing weld.
 502-5 Inspection Requirements.
 502-5.1 Bend Test: If visual inspection reveals any stud which does not show a full
 360 degrees weld, any stud which has been repaired by welding, or any stud in which the
 reduction in height due to welding is less than normal, strike such stud with a hammer and bend
 15 degrees off the vertical. For studs showing less than a 360 degrees weld, bend the stud in the
 direction opposite to the lack of weld. Replace studs that crack in either the weld or the shank.
 The Engineer may select additional studs to be subjected to the bend test specified above. The
 Contractor may leave the tested studs that show no sign of failure in the bent position.
 502-5.2 Unsatisfactory Work: If, during the progress of the shear connectors work,
 inspection and testing indicate that the shear connectors being obtained are not satisfactory, make
 such changes in welding procedure, welding equipment, and type of shear connector as necessary
 to secure satisfactory results, at no expense to the Department.
 502-5.3 Requalification: If the Engineer requests, require the manufacturer of the studs
 to submit sample studs for requalification in accordance with the procedures of 502-6, at no
 expense to the Department.
 502-6 Qualification Procedure.
 502-6.1 Purpose: The purpose of this procedure is to prescribe weldability tests which
 will qualify a shear connector stud for welding under shop or field conditions. The Contractor
 may have a university, independent laboratory, other testing authority, or agency perform the
 tests. Ensure that the agency performing the tests submits to the manufacturer of the stud a
 certified report giving procedures and results for all tests, including the information listed under
 502-6.9.
 502-6.2 Duration of Qualification: Once a type and size of stud with arc-shield has been
 qualified, the Engineer will consider the stud qualified until the manufacturer makes any change
 in the base of the stud, the flux, or the arc-shield, which affects the welding characteristics.
 502-6.3 Preparation of Specimens: Prepare test specimens by welding representative
 studs to the center of square specimen plates, 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick, of structural steel,
 ASTM A36. The manufacturer may weld studs to a large plate and cut the specimen plates to a
 size suitable for test equipment used.
 502-6.4 Welding Procedure: Weld studs with manufacturer recommended power
 source, welding gun, and control equipment. Measure welding voltage, current, and time by
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 689
 
 suitable instrumentation, and record these measurements for each specimen. Ensure that lift and
 plunge are at the manufacturer-recommended optimum setting.
 502-6.5 Number of Test Specimens:
 1. Weld 30 test specimens consecutively, with time held constant at optimum but
 with current 10% below optimum.
 2. Weld 30 test specimens consecutively, with time held constant at optimum but
 with current 10% above optimum.
 502-6.6 Qualification Tests:
 502-6.6.1 Tensile Tests: Subject 10 of the specimens welded in accordance with
 502-6.5(1), 10 in accordance with 502-6.5(2) to a tensile test. The Engineer will consider a stud
 qualified if all test specimens have a tensile strength above the minimum specified in 502-3.2.
 502-6.6.2 Bend Tests: Place 20 of the specimens welded in accordance with 5026.5(1), 20 in accordance with 502-6.5(2) in a bend testing device, and bend alternately 30 degrees
 in opposite directions until failure occurs. The Engineer will consider a stud qualified if, on all
 test specimens, fracture occurs in the shank of the stud and not in the weld.
 502-6.7 Retest: If weld failure occurs in any of the tensile or bend test groups, the
 Contractor may retest that group. If weld failure repeats, consider the stud as having failed to
 qualify.
 502-6.8 Qualification: For a manufacturer’s studs and arc-shields to be qualified, ensure
 that each group of 30 studs, by test or retest, meets the requirements prescribed in 502-6.6.
 502-6.9 Report of Tests: Include the following in the laboratory report:
 1. Drawings which show shapes and dimensions with tolerances of studs, arcshields, and flux.
 2. A complete description of materials used in the studs and arc-shields, including
 the quantity and analysis of the flux.

 520-1 Description.
 Construct portland cement concrete curb. Curb will include concrete curb and gutter,
 concrete traffic separator, valley gutter, special concrete gutter, curb for sidewalk curb ramps and
 driveways, and any other types of concrete curb not specified in other Sections.
 520-2 Materials.
 520-2.1 Concrete: Use concrete meeting the requirements of Section 347.
 520-2.2 Reinforcement: For all steel reinforcement required by the Plans, meet the
 requirements of Section 415.
 520-2.3 Joint Materials: Meet the requirements of Section 932.
 520-3 Forms.
 520-3.1 Form Materials: Construct forms for this work of either wood or metal. Provide
 forms that are straight, free from warp or bends, and of sufficient strength, when staked, to resist
 the pressure of the concrete without deviation from line and grade. For all items constructed on a
 radius, use flexible forms.
 520-3.2 Depth of Forms: Ensure that forms have a depth equal to the plan dimensions
 for the depth of concrete being deposited against them.
 520-3.3 Machine Placement: The Contractor may place these items by machine methods
 with the approval of the Engineer provided that the Contractor consistently produces an
 acceptable finished product, true to line, grade, and cross section.
 520-4 Excavation.
 Excavate to the required depth, and compact the foundation material upon which these
 items are to be placed as specified in 120-9.
 520-5 Placing Concrete.
 Place the concrete in the forms, and tamp and spade it to prevent honeycombing, and until
 the top of the structure can be floated smooth and the edges rounded to the radius shown in the
 Plans.
 520-6 Joints.
 520-6.1 Contraction Joints: Except for machine placed items, the Contractor may form
 joints by using dummy joints (either formed or sawed) or by using sheet metal templates. If using
 sheet metal templates, ensure that they are of the dimensions, and are set to the lines, shown in
 the Plans. Hold templates firmly while placing the concrete. Leave templates in place until the
 concrete has set sufficiently to hold its shape, but remove them while the forms are still in place.
 Saw contraction joints, for machine placed items, unless the Engineer approves an
 alternate method. Saw the joints as soon as the concrete has hardened to the degree that excessive
 raveling will not occur and before uncontrolled shrinkage cracking begins.
 Space contraction joints at intervals of 10 feet except where closure requires a
 lesser interval, but do not allow any section to be less than 4 feet in length.

 520-7.1 Repair of Minor Defects: Remove the forms within 24 hours after placing the
 concrete, and then fill minor defects with mortar composed of one part portland cement and two
 parts fine aggregate. The Engineer will not allow plastering on the face of the curb. Remove and
 replace any rejected curb, curb and gutter, or valley gutter without additional compensation.
 520-7.2 Final Finish: Finish all exposed surfaces while the concrete is still green. In
 general, the Engineer will only require a brush finish. For any surface areas, however, which are
 too rough or where other surface defects make additional finishing necessary, the Engineer may
 require the Contractor to rub the curb to a smooth surface with a soft brick or wood block, using
 water liberally. Also, if necessary to provide a suitable surface, the Engineer may require the
 Contractor to rub further, using thin grout or mortar.
 520-7.3 Imprinted Concrete: Install imprinted concrete as shown in the Plans.
 520-8 Curing.
 520-8.1 General: Continuously cure the concrete for a period of at least 72 hours.
 Commence curing after completely finishing and as soon as the concrete has hardened
 sufficiently to permit application of the curing material without marring the surface. Immediately
 replace any curing material removed or damaged during the 72 hour period.
 After removing the forms, cure the surfaces exposed by placing a berm of moist
 earth against them or by any of the methods described below, for the remainder of the 72 hour
 curing period.
 520-8.2 Wet Burlap Method: Place burlap, as specified in 925-1, over the entire
 exposed surface of the concrete, with sufficient extension beyond each side to ensure complete
 coverage. Overlap adjacent strips a minimum of 6 inches. Hold the burlap securely in place such
 that it will be in continuous contact with the concrete at all times, and do not allow any earth
 between the burlap surfaces at laps or between the burlap and the concrete. Saturate the burlap
 with water before placing it, and keep it thoroughly wet throughout the curing period.
 520-8.3 Membrane Curing Compound Method: Apply clear membrane curing
 compound or white pigmented curing compound, as specified in 925-2, by a hand sprayer
 meeting the requirements of 350-3.10, in a single coat continuous film at a uniform coverage of
 at least one gallon per 200 square feet. Immediately recoat any cracks, checks, or other defects
 appearing in the coating. Thoroughly agitate the curing compound in the drum prior to
 application, and during application as necessary to prevent settlement of the pigment.
 520-8.4 Polyethylene Sheeting Method: Place polyethylene sheeting, as specified in
 925-3, over the entire exposed surface of the concrete, with sufficient extension beyond each side
 to ensure complete coverage. Overlap adjacent strips a minimum of 6 inches. Hold the sheeting
 securely in place and in continuous contact with the concrete at all times.
 520-9 Backfilling and Compaction.

 530-3 Construction and Installation.
 530-3.1 Sand-Cement:
 530-3.1.1 Mixing Materials: Proportion sand and cement in the ratio of 5 cubic
 feet of sand to 94 pounds (one bag) of cement. If proportioning the materials by mass, use a
 density of 85 pounds per cubic foot (loose volume) for sand. The Contractor may batch sand at
 the moisture content occurring in the stockpile.
 Mix the sand and cement until the mixture is of uniform color.
 530-3.1.2 Filling Sacks: Accurately measure the mixed material into each sack,
 taking care to place the same amount of material in each sack; keep at least the top 6 inches of
 the sacks unfilled to allow for proper tying or folding and to ensure against breaking of the sack
 during placing.
 530-3.1.3 Placing: Place the filled sacks with their tied or folded ends all in the
 same direction. Lay the sacks with broken joints, in a regular pattern. Ram or pack the sacks
 against each other so as to form a close and molded contact after the sand and cement mixture
 has set up. Remove and replace sacks ripped or torn in placing with sound, unbroken sacks.
 Then, thoroughly saturate all sacks with water.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 726
 
 530-3.1.4 Grouting: Immediately after watering, fill all openings between sacks
 with dry grout composed of one part Portland cement and five parts sand.
 530-3.1.5 Toe Walls: The Contractor may construct toe walls of riprap for fill
 slopes of poured in place concrete in lieu of sand cement in sacks. Meet the concrete
 requirements as specified in Section 347. If using sand cement in sacks for the toe walls, fill the
 entire trench excavated for the toe walls with sand cement in sacks.
 530-3.2 Rubble: Dump rubble in place forming a compact layer conforming to the neat
 lines and thickness specified in the Plans. Ensure that rubble does not segregate so that smaller
 pieces evenly fill the voids between the larger pieces.
 530-3.3 Bedding Stone: Place a minimum one foot thick layer of bedding stone under all
 rubble riprap without puncturing or tearing the geosynthetic material. The Engineer will allow an
 in place thickness tolerance of plus or minus one inch.
 Remove and replace geosynthetic material damaged as a result of operations at no
 expense to the Department.
 530-3.4 Articulating Concrete Block (ACB) Revetment System: Install the ACB
 revetment system in accordance with ASTM D6884 and the manufacturer’s recommendations,
 unless directed otherwise by the Engineer.
 Prior to installation, construct the area to be stabilized to an elevation such that,
 upon completion of stabilizing operations, the completed stabilized subgrade will conform to the
 lines, grades and cross sections shown in the Plans. Bring the subgrade surface to a plane
 approximately parallel to the plane of the proposed finished surface, such that, upon placement
 of the mat, no individual block within the ACB mat will protrude more than one-half inch from
 any adjacent block. Uniformly compact each subgrade layer to achieve the density required in
 the Plans. If the Plans do not provide for stabilizing, compact the subgrade in both cuts and fills,
 to the density specified in ASTM D6884.
 Embed anchors at least six feet into the subgrade at a 45 degree angle into the
 bank with a minimum pullout resistance of 875 pounds. In the presence of the Engineer, perform
 on-site anchor strength testing to verify the required pull out resistance is achieved. Anchor
 strength testing must be performed on the first two and final two installed anchors, and randomly
 throughout the installation operation such that 5% of all installed anchors are tested for pullout
 resistance. If any anchor fails to meet the pullout resistance requirement, test every subsequent
 installed anchor until a revised installation plan is proposed and approved by the Engineer.
 Anchor spacing cannot exceed four feet.
 Immediately prior to placing the geosynthetic material and ACB system, inspect
 the prepared subgrade to ensure it is free of loose material and the surface is smoothly
 compacted. Place the geosynthetic material directly on the prepared area, in intimate contact with
 the subgrade and free of folds or wrinkles. Do not glue or physically bond the geosynthetic
 material to the ACB mat. Install a six inch thick layer of bedding stone under the geosynthetic
 material, when called for in the Plans.
 When installing ACB systems around curves, the mats shall be matched up to the
 greatest extent possible. Gaps greater than one block size shall be filled with a block and grouted
 the depth of the block with non-structural grout.
 Do not install blocks with chips that result in any block weighing less than 95% of
 the manufacture specified weight.

 530-3.5 Gabions: Install double-twisted wire mesh gabions in accordance with
 ASTM D7014. Install welded wire fabric gabions and polymeric gabions in accordance with the
 manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Prior to installation, complete any required excavation and preparation of the
 foundation as shown in the Plans or as directed.
 Install soil anchors as specified in the Plans.
 All adjoining gabion units shall be connected along the perimeter of their contact
 surfaces to obtain a monolithic structure. If more than one tier, stagger the vertical joints of
 subsequent rows by one half cell length and adjoin the empty gabions to the top of the lower tier
 along the front and back edges of the contact surface.
 Fill gabions in a manner that minimizes voids, protects against local deformation
 of the basket or mattress and prevents damage to PVC coating. At no point in the filling process
 may rock be mechanically placed from a height of over 36 inches from machine to fill area.
 Uniformly overfill gabions by 1 to 2 inches to compensate for future rock settlements.
 Any damage to the basket, mattress, or coatings during assembly, placement, or
 filling shall be repaired promptly in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations or

 foundations, barrier delineators, end delineators, rub rail, pipe rail, and approach terminals, in
 accordance with Section 967.
 536-3 Construction.
 536-3.1 Height Tolerance: Install guardrail panels at the height shown in the Standard
 Plans with a tolerance of 1 inch above and 1/2 inch below the nominal height specified. Where
 unavoidable surface irregularities, including but not limited to across shoulder gutters, inlets, and
 roadway surface break lines, are encountered, a tolerance of 3 inches above and 1 inch below the
 nominal height is permissible.
 536-3.2 Station Location Tolerance: Where guardrail feature stationing is called out in
 the Plans, the longitudinal stationing tolerance is plus or minus 3 feet and 1-1/2 inch, unless
 otherwise restricted by field conditions as determined by the Engineer.
 For transition connections to rigid barrier, install the thrie-beam terminal
 connector at a 1/4 inch tolerance relative to the end of the rigid barrier as defined in the Plans
 and Standard Plans.
 536-3.3 Setting Posts: Set posts plumb and to the soil depth shown in the Standard Plans.
 Use the deep post option only where specified in the Plans. Place posts in excavations, backfill
 the space around the posts, and thoroughly tamp the backfilled soil. As an alternate method, use
 a post-driving machine meeting the approval of the Engineer.
 For guardrail post replacement, backfill and tamp the existing soil hole prior to
 setting the replacement post.
 If driving timber posts, either block out holes in the asphalt pavement during the
 asphalt paving operation or cut holes through the asphalt mat prior to the post installation.
 Blocked out or cut holes in the asphalt pavement must be at least 50% larger than the crosssectional area of the timber post. After driving the posts, patch the area of asphalt around each
 post with hot bituminous mixture in accordance with Section 339.
 If driving steel posts, drive the post directly through the asphalt mat. Fill asphalt
 depressions or cracks with hot bituminous mixture in a manner meeting the approval of the
 Engineer.

 spacing results in post(s) conflicting with sidewalks, gutter, underground utilities, or other
 permanent obstacles which cannot be removed as determined by the Engineer, the following
 options are permitted with the approval of the Engineer:
 1. Additional Offset Blocks – Up to two additional offset blocks (3 total) may be
 used where the resulting post placement, moved farther behind the face of guardrail, will avoid a
 post conflict.
 Use button-head bolts of added length as needed to secure the panel
 system with the rear nut and washer. Where bolts greater than 25 inches are required, a 5/8 inch
 threaded rod meeting the same material requirements may be substituted and secured with steel
 hex nuts of over 1-1/8 inches in diameter. Use a steel washer against the post and not the panel.
 The rod is not permitted to extend beyond 3/4 inch from the face of the tightened nut on the
 panel side; trim the rod as needed and galvanize in accordance with Section 562.
 Over a distance of one post spacing, linearly widen the miscellaneous
 asphalt pavement where required to maintain a minimum of 10 inches of material behind the
 post.
 2. Special Steel Posts – Where post placement atop a concrete structure cannot be
 avoided, use special steel posts as defined in the Standard Plans and 536-3.6.
 3. Encased Posts – Where post placement results in a conflict with an
 underground utility or obstacle, use the shallower encased post option as defined in the Standard
 Plans where the concrete encasement will not damage a utility.
 4. Frangible Leave-Out – Where post placement results in a conflict with a
 concrete slab, use the frangible leave-out as defined in the Standard Plans. Do not use posts
 through concrete slabs deeper than 8 inches.

 For SBW MSE wall systems, a geogrid reinforced, geotextile wrapped, compacted
 aggregate leveling pad may be used in lieu of the unreinforced concrete leveling pad. The
 compacted aggregate leveling pad must be at least 24 inches wide and at least 8 inches thick after
 compacting, and the geogrid must be at least 6 inches below the top of the leveling pad. Wrap the

 aggregate leveling pad with a D-2, D-3, or D-5 separation geotextile. The geotextile may run up
 the front and back of the first block course or between the aggregate leveling pad and the first
 block course.
 548-8.4 Wall Erection: Assemble, connect and support wall components as
 recommended by the wall supplier. As backfill material is placed behind the wall face of MSE
 wall systems utilizing reinforced concrete panels, maintain the wall in the vertical position or
 slightly battered into the backfill to provide a final vertical alignment (by means of bracing,
 temporary wooden wedges placed in the joint at the junction of the two adjacent precast
 components on the external side of the wall or other alignment aids). Remove wooden wedges as
 soon as the precast component above the wedged precast component is completely erected and
 backfilled. External bracing is required for the initial lift of MSE systems.
 For SBW systems, carefully place the first course of concrete block units on the
 leveling pad. Up to 1/2 inch of sand may be placed between the concrete leveling pad and the
 buried first course of blocks to provide a level and stable base. A one inch gap between the first
 course of facing units is allowed, provided a suitable filter fabric is placed behind the foundation
 units as specified for each approved wall system. Each unit must be in full contact with the base
 and checked for level and horizontal alignment. Voids must be kept to a minimum to prevent
 point loading and cracking, unless otherwise indicated in the shop drawings. Place units side by
 side for the full length of wall alignment. Fill the hollow cores or cells and the space within
 blocks with drainage aggregate. Sweep away excess material from top of units and install the
 next course.
 Place soil reinforcement normal to the face of the wall, unless otherwise shown in
 the Contract or as directed by the Engineer. Do not cut or kink soil reinforcement. Do not
 connect soil reinforcement to piles or allow soil reinforcement to bear against piles. Field cut soil
 reinforcement only at locations as shown in the approved shop drawings. Prior to placement of
 the reinforcement, compact the backfill in accordance with 548-8.5.
 For SBW systems, shims made of non-degradable materials may be used as
 specified for each approved wall system. The shim thickness per course of block must not exceed
 1/8 inch and must not be installed on reinforcement elevations when the reinforcement
 connection relies on any friction.
 548-8.4.1 Tolerances for Permanent Walls: Walls that do not meet the
 following tolerances will not be accepted by the Department and must be removed and
 reconstructed at no cost to the Department.
 548-8.4.1.1 Reinforced Concrete MSE Wall Systems: Vertical
 tolerances (plumbness) and horizontal alignment tolerances must not exceed 3/4 inch when
 measured with a 10 foot straightedge. The maximum allowable offset in the joint between
 precast components is 3/4 inch. The final overall vertical tolerance of the completed wall
 (plumbness from top to bottom) must not exceed 1/2 inch per 10 feet of wall height. Horizontal
 and vertical joints between precast components must not be less than 1/2 inch or more than 11/4 inches.
 548-8.4.1.2 SBW Systems: Horizontal alignment tolerances must
 not exceed 3/4 inch per10 feet of wall length. The maximum allowable gap between segmental
 retaining wall blocks above the first course must not exceed 1/16 inch. The final overall vertical
 tolerance of the completed wall (deviation from plumbness from top to bottom or batter shown in
 the Plans) must not exceed 1/2 inch per 10 feet of wall height.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 753
 
 548-8.4.2 Tolerances for Temporary Walls: Vertical tolerances (plumbness)
 and horizontal alignment tolerances must not exceed three inches when measured with a 10 foot
 straightedge. The final overall vertical tolerance of the completed wall (plumbness from top to
 bottom) must not exceed one inch per three feet of wall height, not to exceed a total of six inches.
 548-8.5 Backfill Placement:
 548-8.5.1 Compacted Select and Coarse Aggregate Backfill: A LOT is defined
 as a single lift of finished embankment not to exceed 500 feet in length or cumulative length of
 continuous, interconnected walls. Backfill within three feet from the panels and backfill beyond
 three feet from the panels are separate LOTs. Overlapping retaining wall volumes may be
 considered one LOT, excluding the three feet width behind the panels. Strips up to eight feet
 wide between two retaining wall volumes constructed with the same material in one operation
 may be considered as one LOT with the retaining wall volumes. Isolated compaction operations
 will be considered as separate LOTs. For multiple phase construction, a LOT will not extend
 beyond the limits of the phase. When bridge abutments on spread footings are shown in the
 Plans, the material within three feet behind the wall face and within the limits defined in 5489.4.2 are considered as separate LOTs.
 Remove wrinkles in geotextile reinforcement prior to covering with
 backfill. Place the backfill closely following the erection of each course of precast components or
 soil reinforcement layers and spread by moving the machinery parallel to the wall face. Do not
 allow equipment heavier than eight tons closer than three feet behind the wall face. Place backfill
 in a manner to avoid any damage or disturbance to the wall materials or misalignment of the
 facing materials. Remove and replace any wall materials which become damaged or disturbed
 during backfill placement at no cost to the Department, or correct as directed by the Engineer.
 Remove and reconstruct any misalignment or distortion of the wall facing due to placement of
 backfill outside the limits of this specification at no cost to the Department.
 Compact coarse aggregate backfill with a minimum of three passes of a
 vibratory compactor weighing between 600 and 1000 pounds or two passes of vibratory
 compactor weighing over 1000 pounds. Use the highest vibration level that does not cause
 excessive fracture of the aggregate in the opinion of the Engineer. Continue compaction until
 there is no additional movement. Sheepsfoot, grid rollers or other types of equipment employing
 a foot are not allowed for any backfill type. Achieve compaction of all backfill types within three
 feet of the back of the wall face using a power operated roller or plate weighing less than
 1,000 pounds. At a distance greater than three feet from the back of the wall, a vibratory roller
 may be used, provided that the frequency and amplitude combined with bulk weight of the roller
 has performed satisfactorily at a trial section of the same type of wall. For select backfill, a
 smooth wheel or rubber tire roller is considered adequate. Ensure that the maximum lift thickness
 after compaction does not exceed six inches. Decrease the lift thickness if necessary, to obtain
 specified density.
 All transitions from coarse aggregate backfill to select backfill must occur
 at least six inches above and below any layers of backfill reinforcement. Place a separation
 geotextile in accordance with 548-2.5.4 between the coarse aggregate backfill and select backfill
 and embankment.
 Perform backfill compaction in a way that the compactor moves in a
 direction parallel to the wall face and proceeds from a distance not less than three feet behind the
 wall face toward the end of the soil reinforcement element.

 754
 
 When placing select backfill, the moisture content of the backfill material
 prior to and during compaction must be uniformly distributed throughout each layer of material.
 Use backfill material having a placement moisture content at the dry side of the optimum
 moisture content. To achieve the required compaction moisture content, use water that meets the
 requirements of Section 923. Do not transport excessively moist backfill materials to the site for
 any reason. Determine the optimum moisture content in accordance with the test method used to
 determine maximum density in 548-9.
 At the end of each day’s operation, shape the last level of backfill to
 permit runoff of rainwater away from the wall face or provide a positive means of controlling run
 off away from the wall such as temporary pipe.
 548-8.5.2 Flowable Fill: Metallic wall components (including metallic soil
 reinforcements) must not be in partial contact with the flowable fill. If the metallic components
 contact the flowable fill, the metallic components must be completely encapsulated by the
 flowable fill.
 548-8.6 Compressible Free Draining Seal: Seal all joints between panels of reinforced
 concrete panel MSE walls with compressible free draining material to prevent plant growth from
 seeds or spores that may be in the joints or transported to the joints by wind or rain. The
 installation must be secure and free draining to keep the seal in place until uninstalled and to
 prevent hydrostatic forces from building up behind the panel.
 548-9 Acceptance Program.

 nuclear density testing in accordance with FM 1-T238. Determine the in-place moisture content
 for each density test. Use FM 1-T238, FM 5-507 (Determination of Moisture Content by Means
 of a Calcium Carbide Gas Pressure Moisture Tester), or FM 5-535 (Laboratory Determination of
 Moisture Content of Granular Soils by Use of a Microwave Oven) for moisture determination.
 Perform these tests at a minimum frequency of one set of tests per LOT.
 Determine test locations including stations and offsets, using the random number
 generator provided by the Engineer. Do not use note pads or work sheets to record data for later
 transfer to the density log book. Notify the Engineer upon successful completion of QC testing
 on each LOT.
 548-9.4 Acceptance Criteria: For select backfill, obtain a minimum density of 90% of
 the maximum dry density as determined by FM 1-T180 within three feet behind the wall face and

 density as determined by AASHTO T99 beyond three feet behind the wall face.
 The combined width from both MSE wall backfill (excluding the three
 foot zone from the panels) and embankment material may be considered the same LOT if the
 same material is used; the material in both wall backfill and embankment is compacted with the
 same procedure, equipment and compacting effort; and the maximum lift thickness after
 compaction in both wall backfill and embankment is six inches.
 548-9.4.2 Acceptance Criteria for Wall Backfill Supporting Spread Footings:
 When spread footings at bridge abutments are shown in the Plans, obtain a minimum of 95% of
 the maximum dry density as determined by FM 1-T180 on the material within three feet behind
 the wall face, and underneath the footing as defined by the following limits:
 1. All lifts below the bottom of the footing for a depth equal to at least the
 footing width
 2. A minimum distance of three feet beyond the edges of the footing width
 If the optional criteria specified in 548-9.4.1 is used, compact the backfill
 material within the limits specified above to obtain a minimum density of 100% of the maximum
 dry density as determined by AASHTO T99. Compact the remainder of the backfill in
 accordance with 548-9.4 or 548-9.4.1 as applicable. Do not use compaction equipment larger
 than permitted in 548-6.5 within three feet behind the wall face; decrease the lift thickness if
 necessary.

 In addition, for permanent walls utilizing metallic soil reinforcement, test for
 corrosiveness at a minimum frequency of one test per soil type at point of placement according to
 the electro-chemical table in 548-2.6. The Engineer will collect enough material to split and
 create two separate samples and retain one for resolution at point of placement until LOTs
 represented by the samples are accepted. The Engineer will perform verification tests for
 corrosiveness at a minimum frequency of one test per soil type.
 548-9.7 Verification Comparison Criteria and Resolution Procedures:
 548-9.7.1 Maximum Density Determination: The Engineer will collect enough
 material to split and create two separate samples and retain one for resolution until LOTs
 represented by the samples are accepted.
 The Engineer will meet the requirements of 120-10.4.1 except replace
 AASHTO T99, Method C with FM 1-T180, Method D. If the Contractor selects the Optional
 Acceptance Criteria, the Engineer will verify the QC results of AASHTO T99, Method C in
 accordance with 120-10.4.1.
 548-9.7.2 Density Testing: Meet the requirements of 120-10.4.2.
 548-9.7.3 Soil Classification: The Engineer will meet the requirements of
 120-10.4.3 except test the sample retained in 548-9.7.1 instead of taking the additional one.
 548-9.7.4 Gradation: The Engineer will verify the QC results if the verification
 result meets the gradation limits set forth in the gradation table of 548-2.6. Otherwise, the
 Engineer will test the sample retained in 548-9.7.1. The State Materials Office (SMO) or an
 AASHTO accredited laboratory designated by the SMO will perform resolution testing. The
 material will be sampled and tested in accordance with AASHTO T27 and FM 1-T011.
 If the resolution test result satisfies the required gradation limits, the LOTS
 will be verified. If the resolution test results do not meet the required gradation limits, reconstruct
 the LOTS with acceptable material. The Engineer will perform new verification testing.
 548-9.7.5 Liquid Limit and Plasticity Index (LL&PI): The Engineer will verify
 the QC results if the verification result satisfies the plasticity index and liquid limit criteria set
 forth in 548-2.6. Otherwise, the Engineer will test the sample retained in 548-9.7.1. The SMO or
 an AASHTO accredited laboratory designated by the SMO will perform resolution testing. The
 material will be sampled and tested in accordance with AASHTO T90 and AASHTO T89,
 respectively.
 If the resolution test result satisfies the required criteria, LOTS of that soil
 type will be verified. If the resolution test results do not meet the required criteria, reconstruct the
 corresponding LOTS with acceptable material. The Engineer will perform new verification
 testing.
 548-9.7.6 Corrosiveness: The Engineer will verify the QC results if the
 verification result satisfies the electro-chemical and pH test criteria set forth in 548-2.6.
 Otherwise, the Engineer will test the sample retained in 548-9.7.1. The SMO or an AASHTO
 accredited laboratory designated by the SMO will perform resolution testing. The material will
 be sampled and tested in accordance with FM 5-550, FM 5-551, FM 5-552 and FM 5-553.

 If the resolution test result satisfies the required criteria, material of that
 soil type will be verified and accepted. If the resolution test results do not meet the required
 criteria, reject the material and reconstruct with acceptable material.
 548-9.7.7 Organic Content: The Engineer will verify the QC results if the
 verification result satisfies the organic content test criteria set forth in 548-2.6. Otherwise, the
 Engineer will collect three additional samples. The material will be sampled and tested in
 accordance with FM 1-T267 and by averaging the test results for three randomly selected
 samples from at least one lift per soil type. The SMO or an AASHTO accredited laboratory
 designated by the SMO will perform resolution testing.
 If the resolution test result satisfies the required criteria, material of that soil type
 will be verified and accepted. If the resolution test results do not meet the required criteria, reject
 the material and reconstruct with acceptable material.
 548-9.7.8 Friction Angle: When the friction angle depicted in the shop drawings
 exceeds 30 degrees for sand backfill or 34 degrees for limerock backfill, the Engineer will take a
 verification sample at the point of placement to perform a direct shear verification test in
 accordance with FM 3-D3080. The SMO or a consultant qualified to perform geotechnical
 specialty lab testing (Type of Work 9.5), per Rule 14-75 of the Florida Administrative Code will
 perform the verification testing. If the test verifies the material has a friction angle greater than or
 equal to the friction angle depicted in the shop drawings, the material in the LOTs will be
 verified. If the verification test does not meet the required friction angle, reconstruct the LOTs
 with acceptable material.
 The Contractor may request to redesign the wall and resubmit the shop
 drawings with the lower friction angle indicated by the verification test. Employ a Professional
 Engineer to redesign and submit signed and sealed drawings and computations. Do not begin any
 reconstruction until the proposed redesign has been reviewed and approved by the Engineer. The
 Contractor shall bear the costs of the redesign and any work resulting from the design changes.
 548-10 Certification.
 Submit all test reports to the Engineer necessary to document compliance with the
 Specifications, at least ten days prior to wall construction.
 Also submit a certificate of compliance certifying that the retaining wall materials,
 backfill and construction practices comply with this Section.
 For SBW systems, the Engineer will randomly select samples of each type of block used
 in the segmental block retaining wall system and review a copy of the certified test report
 corresponding the sample at a frequency of one sample per type of block for each wall.
 Acceptance of furnished material will be based on the certificate of compliance,

 SECTION 550
 FENCING
 550-1 Description.
 Furnish, erect and reset metal fence of the type and at the locations shown in the Plans.
 550-2 Types of Fence.
 The types of fence are designated as follows:
 Type A (Farm Fence).
 Type B (Chain-Link Fence).
 Type R (Chain-Link Fence for Pedestrian Overpass).
 550-3 Materials.
 550-3.1 Type A Fence (Farm Fence): Meet the requirements of Section 954 for timber
 posts and braces. For metal posts and braces, and for recycled plastic fence posts, meet the
 requirements of the Standard Plans.
 For the fabric and all other accessories, meet the requirements of the Standard
 Plans.
 550-3.2 Type B Fence (Chain-Link): For the posts, braces, fabric and all accessories
 other than the concrete for bases, meet the requirements of the Standard Plans.
 Use concrete as specified in Section 347, or a premix approved by the Engineer
 for bases. The requirements contained in 347-2.2, and 347-3 will not apply.
 550-3.3 Type R Fence (Chain-Link for Pedestrian Overpass): Use the fabric and
 accessories specified in the Plans.
 550-3.4 Resetting Fence: Use material from the existing fence. For any additional
 materials required, provide the same type of material as in the existing fence and as specified
 herein, including gates when applicable.
 550-3.5 Optional Use of Materials: For Type A Fence, a combination of steel,
 aluminum, timber, recycled plastic or concrete posts may be used. Unless otherwise called for in
 the Plans, line posts of one material may be used with corner, pull and end post assemblies of a
 different material. The Engineer will permit the use of line posts of only one optional material
 and pull posts assemblies of only one optional material between corner and end post assemblies.
 Within individual corner and end post assemblies, the Engineer will allow the use of only one
 optional material.
 For Type B Fence, a combination of zinc-coated steel fence members, aluminum
 coated fence members and aluminum alloy fence members may be used. Unless otherwise
 indicated in the Plans, the Engineer will allow the use of only one type of fabric material, one
 type of line post material and one type of pull assembly material between corner and end post
 assemblies.
 550-3.6 Certification: Provide the Engineer with certified test reports from the
 manufacturer confirming that all materials (posts, braces, fabric and all other accessories)
 conform to the requirements of this Section, Section 6 and the Standard Plans. Provide the
 Engineer a copy of the certification at least ten days prior to fence construction.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 760
 
 Also furnish the Engineer a Certificate of Compliance certifying that the fencing
 system, materials and construction practices comply with the applicable Standard Plans and
 Specifications.
 Acceptance of furnished material will be based on the Certificate of Compliance,
 accompanying test reports and visual inspection by the Engineer.
 550-4 Construction Methods.
 550-4.1 General: Install the fence in accordance with the specific requirements of this
 Article and with the details shown on the Standard Plans for the particular type of fence called
 for, except for Type R Fence which shall be detailed in the Plans. Construct the fence in close
 proximity to the right of way line except as otherwise detailed in the Plans. Assume
 responsibility for obtaining satisfactory permits or permission from property owners for any
 encroachments required to perform the work, and for proper scheduling of the fence installation
 with the removal of existing fence where it is necessary to provide continuous security to
 adjacent areas already fenced. In order to meet this requirement, where necessary for maintaining
 security of livestock on adjacent property during construction of the new fence, the Engineer may
 require the erection and subsequent removal of temporary fencing.
 550-4.2 Spacing of Posts: Space posts as shown in the Standard Plans, within a tolerance
 of 12 inches, except where definite spotting of corner posts is required. Ensure that in any line of
 fence, the over-spacings and the under-spacings shall approximately compensate. Set additional
 line posts at abrupt changes in grade.
 550-4.3 Clearing: Where the clearing and grubbing for the project includes the area
 occupied by the fence, clear the area to the limits shown in the Plans. If the limits are not shown
 in the Plans, clear the area at least 2 feet wide on each side of the fence line. The Engineer may
 direct that desirable trees be left in place and may restrict clearing where permission from the
 property owners cannot be obtained.
 550-4.4 Construction Over Irregular Terrain and Other Obstructions:
 550-4.4.1 Clearance of Bottom of Fence: Install the fence such that the bottom
 of the fence, in general, follows the contour of the ground. The fence is detailed in the Plans at
 approximately 3 inches above ground line. Over irregular ground, however, the Engineer will
 permit a minimum clearance of 1 inch and a maximum of 6 inches for a length not to exceed
 8 feet, and, for Type A fence, with the barbed wire spaced midway between ground and bottom
 of fabric.
 550-4.4.2 Grading: Where necessary to secure proper vertical alignment and to
 meet the clearance requirements, fill depressions (except where filling would obstruct proper
 drainage) and cut down knolls and ridges. Provide a substantial and permanent foundation for the
 fence.
 550-4.4.3 Use of Extra-Length Posts. At locations where it is impracticable to
 adjust the ground level, the Engineer may require that posts of additional length be set and that
 the opening at the bottom be closed by additional barbed wire, stretched taut between poles, with
 no vertical distance between wires greater than 3 inches. For all such posts requiring a concrete
 base, extend the concrete downward to the bottom of the extra-length post.
 550-4.5 Setting Posts: If rock occurs within the required depth of the post hole, or
 pavement which is to remain in place exists at the location of a post, drill a hole of a diameter
 slightly larger than the greatest dimension of the post or footing and grout in the post or footing.

 761
 
 Set timber posts either by digging or by driving. Set recycled plastic fence posts in accordance
 with the Standard Plans.
 550-4.6 Placing Fabric: Do not place fabric and barbed wire until the posts have been
 permanently positioned and concrete foundations have attained adequate strength. Place the
 fabric by securing one end and applying sufficient tension to remove all slack before making
 permanent attachments at intermediate points. Fasten the fabric to all end, corner and pull posts
 by approved means. Fasten the fabric using tools designed for the purpose, in accordance with
 the manufacturer’s recommendations. Apply the tension for stretching by mechanical fence
 stretchers or with single-wire stretchers designed for the purpose.
 550-4.7 Electrical Grounds:
 550-4.7.1 Grounding for Overhead Lines: Wherever an overhead power line
 crosses over the fence, install a ground rod directly below the point of crossing. Where an
 overhead power line runs parallel to, and within 100 feet of the fence, install a ground rod at each
 end of the fence and at intervals of no greater than 1,500 feet. Use copper-clad steel ground rods
 that are a minimum of 8 feet in length and 1/2 inch in diameter. Drive the rod vertically until the
 top of the rod is approximately 6 inches below the ground surface. Connect a conductor of No. 6
 AWG solid copper wire to the ground rod and each metal fence element directly adjacent to the
 ground rod using non-corrosive ground rod clamps.
 550-4.7.2 Fences with Non-Metal Posts: For all fences using non-metal posts,
 substitute a metal post for a non-metal post at intervals of no greater than 300 feet with at least
 one metal post in any length of fence. Tightly fasten a galvanized steel wire to the barbed wire,
 fence fabric, and metal post.
 550-5 Method of Measurement.
 550-5.1 General: The quantities to be paid for will be plan quantity for the number of
 gates and the length of each type of fence constructed and accepted. In addition, extra payment
 will be made, in accordance with 550-6.2, for additional lengths of post approved by the
 Engineer for the crossing of depressions in accordance with 550-4.4.3, muck areas, or other areas
 of inadequate support for a post of standard length.
 550-5.2 Measurement of Fence Length, and Payment: The length of fence to be paid
 for will be plan quantity completed and accepted. Measurement for resetting fence will be the
 actual length of existing fence reset, including gates when applicable.
 550-6 Basis of Payment.
 550-6.1 Basic Items of Fencing: The Contract unit price per foot for the item of fencing,
 will be full compensation for all work and materials necessary for the complete installation,
 including line posts, corner, end, and pull posts. Such price and payment will include, but not be
 limited to, the following specific incidental work.

 DIRECTIONAL BORE
 555-1 Description.
 555-1.1 Scope of Work: The work specified in this Section documents the approved
 construction methods and procedures for directional boring, also commonly called horizontal
 directional drilling (HDD).
 555-1.2 General: HDD is a trenchless method for installing a product that serves as a
 carrier pipe for transporting solids, liquids or gasses (under pressure or gravity flow), or serves as
 a conduit, casing, or duct for a carrier pipe, cable, or wire line products. It is a multi-stage
 process consisting of site preparation and restoration, equipment setup, and drilling a pilot bore
 along a predetermined path and then pulling the product back through the drilled space. When
 necessary, enlargement of the pilot bore hole may be necessary to accommodate a product larger
 than the pilot bore hole size. This process is referred to as back reaming and is done at the same
 time the product is being pulled back through the pilot bore hole.
 Accomplish alignment of the bore by proper orientation of the drill bit head as it
 is being pushed into the ground by a hydraulic jack and determine orientation and tracking of the
 drill bit. In order to minimize friction and prevent collapse of the bore hole, introduce a soil
 stabilizing agent (drilling fluid) into the annular bore space from the trailing end of the drill bit.
 Select or design drilling fluids for the site specific soil and ground water
 conditions. Confine free flowing (escaping) slurry or drilling fluids at the ground surface during
 pull back or drilling. Remove all residual slurry from the surface and restore the site to
 preconstruction conditions.
 555-2 Construction Site Requirements.
 555-2.1 Pedestrian Traffic: When and where installations temporarily disrupt use of a
 pedestrian way, provide a safe alternate route in accordance with Standard Plans, Indexes 102600 and 102-660.
 555-2.2 Site Conditions:
 1. Carry out excavation for entry, exit, recovery pits, slurry sump pits, or any
 other excavation as specified in Section 120. Sump pits are required to contain drilling fluids if
 vacuum devices are not operated throughout the drilling operation, unless approved by the
 Engineer.
 2. Within 48 hours of completing installation of the product, clean the work site of
 all excess slurry or spoils. Take responsibility for the removal and final disposition of excess
 slurry or spoils. Ensure that the work site is restored to pre-construction conditions or as
 identified on the plans.
 3. Provide MOT in accordance with the Standard Plans and the MUTCD when
 and where the former is silent.
 4. Exposure of product shall be limited to 3 feet and 14 consecutive days unless
 approved by the Engineer.
 555-2.3 Damage Restoration: Take responsibility for restoration for any damage caused
 by heaving, settlement, separation of pavement, escaping drilling fluid (frac-out), or the
 directional drilling operation, at no cost to the Department.
 555-2.3.1 Remediation Plans: When required by the Engineer, provide detailed
 plans which show how damage to any roadway facility will be remedied. These details will
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 764
 
 become part of the As-Built Plans Package. Remediation plans must follow the same guidelines
 for development and presentation of the as-built plans. When remediation plans are required,
 they must be approved by the Engineer before any work proceeds.
 555-3 Quality Control.
 555-3.1 General: Take control of the operation at all times. Have a representative who is
 thoroughly knowledgeable of the equipment, boring and Department procedures, present at the
 job site during the entire installation and available to address immediate concerns and emergency
 operations. Notify the Engineer 48 hours in advance of starting work. Do not begin installation
 until the Engineer is present at the job site and agrees that proper preparations have been made.
 555-3.1.1 Product Testing: When there is any indication that the installed
 product has sustained damage and may leak, stop all work, notify the Engineer and investigate
 the damage. The Engineer may require a pressure test and reserves the right to be present during
 the test. Perform pressure test within 24 hours, unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 Submit the test results to the Engineer for review and approval. The Engineer is allowed up to
 72 hours to approve or determine if the product installation is not in compliance with the
 specifications. The Engineer may require non-compliant installations to be filled with
 excavatable flowable fill.
 555-3.1.2 Testing Methods: Testing may consist of one of the following methods
 and must always meet or exceed the Department’s testing requirements:
 1. Follow the product manufacturer’s pressure testing recommendations.
 2. Ensure carrier pipes installed without a casing meet the pressure
 requirements set by the owner. If the owner does not require pressure testing, the Engineer may
 require at least one test.
 3. A water tight pipe and joint configuration where the product is installed
 beneath any pavement (including sidewalk) and front shoulders is required. The Engineer will
 determine when and where water tight joint requirements will be applied to the ultimate roadway
 section for future widening. When a product is located elsewhere, the pipe and joint
 configuration must meet or exceed soil tight joint requirements. Conduct tests for joint integrity
 for one hour. The test for a soil tight joint allows up to 0.1 gallon of water leakage at a sustained
 pressure of 2 psi. The water tight joint criteria allows no leakage at all for a sustained pressure of
 5 psi.
 555-3.1.3 Failed Bore Path: If conditions warrant removal of any materials
 installed in a failed bore path, as determined by the Engineer, it will be at no cost to the
 Department. Promptly fill all voids with excavatable flowable fill.
 555-3.2 Product Locating and Tracking: The method of locating and tracking the drill
 head during the pilot bore will be shown in the Plans. The Department recognizes walkover, wire
 line, and wire line with surface grid verification, or any other system as approved by the
 Engineer, as the accepted methods of tracking directional bores. Use a locating and tracking
 system capable of ensuring the proposed installation is installed as intended. If an area of radio
 signal interference is expected to exceed 5 feet, the Engineer may specify the use of a suitable
 tracking system. The locating and tracking system must provide information on:
 1. Clock and pitch information
 2. Depth
 3. Transmitter temperature
 4. Battery status
 5. Position (x,y)
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 765
 
 6. Azimuth, where direct overhead readings (walkover) are not possible (i.e.
 subaqueous or limited access transportation facility)
 7. Ensure proper calibration of all equipment before commencing directional
 drilling operation.
 8. Take and record alignment readings or plot points such that elevations on top of
 and offset dimensions from the center of the product to a permanent fixed feature are provided.
 Such permanent fixed feature must have prior approval of the Engineer. Provide elevations and
 dimensions at all bore alignment corrections (vertical and horizontal) with a minimum distance
 between points of 100 feet. Provide a sufficient number of elevations and offset distances to
 accurately plot the vertical and horizontal alignment of the installed product. A minimum of
 three elevation and plot points are required.
 555-3.3 Product Bore Hole Diameter: Minimize potential damage from soil
 displacement/settlement by limiting the ratio of the bore hole to the product size. The size of the
 back reamer bit or pilot bit, if no back reaming is required, will be limited relative to the product
 diameter to be installed as follows:
 Maximum Pilot or Back-Reamer Bit Diameter When Rotated 360 Degrees
 Outside Pipe Diameter Inches*
 Maximum Bit Diameter Inches
 <8
 Diameter + 4
 8 to 24
 1.5 x Diameter
 >24
 Diameter + 12
 *Use manufacturer’s recommendation for pipe with restrained joints.
 
 555-3.4 Drilling Fluids: Use a mixture of bentonite clay or other approved stabilizing
 agent mixed with potable water with a minimum pH of 6.0 to create the drilling fluid for
 lubrication and soil stabilization. Do not use any other chemicals or polymer surfactants in the
 drilling fluid without written consent from the Engineer. Certify to the Engineer in writing that
 any chemicals to be added are environmentally safe and not harmful or corrosive to the facility.
 Identify the source of water for mixing the drilling fluid. Any water source used other than a
 potable water source may require a pH test.
 555-4 Drilling Operations:
 555-4.1 Installation Process: Ensure adequate removal of soil cuttings and stability of
 the bore hole by monitoring the drilling fluids such as the pumping rate, pressures, viscosity and
 density during the pilot bore, back reaming and pipe installation. Relief holes can be used as
 necessary to relieve excess pressure down hole. Obtain the Engineer’s approval of the location
 and all conditions necessary to construct relief holes to ensure the proper disposition of drilling
 fluids is maintained and unnecessary inconvenience is minimized to other facility users.
 To minimize heaving during pull back, the pull back rate is determined in order to
 maximize the removal of soil cuttings without building excess down hole pressure. Contain
 excess drilling fluids at entry and exit points until they are recycled or removed from the site or
 vacuumed during drilling operations. Ensure that entry and exit pits are of sufficient size to
 contain the expected return of drilling fluids and soil cuttings.
 Ensure that all drilling fluids are disposed of or recycled in a manner acceptable to
 the appropriate local, state, or federal regulatory agencies. When drilling in suspected
 contaminated ground, test the drilling fluid for contamination and appropriately dispose of it.
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 766
 
 Remove any excess material upon completion of the bore. If in the drilling process it becomes
 evident that the soil is contaminated, contact the Engineer immediately. Do not continue drilling
 without the Engineer’s approval.
 When conditions warrant, as determined by the Engineer, back reaming for
 enlarging the bore diameter shall be accomplished by connecting the reamer to trailing drill
 stems at the exit pit of the pilot bore. The drill pipe shall remain in the bore hole until the final
 product is pulled into place. After the pilot bore is established, do not push anything from the
 entry pit to the exit pit.
 The timing of all boring processes is critical. Install a product into a bore hole
 within the same day that the pre-bore is completed to ensure necessary support exists.
 555-4.2 Boring Failure: If an obstruction is encountered during boring which prevents
 completion of the installation in accordance with the design location and specification, the pipe
 may be taken out of service and left in place at the discretion of the Engineer. Immediately fill
 the product left in place with excavatable flowable fill. Submit a new installation procedure and
 revised plans to the Engineer for approval before resuming work at another location. If, during
 construction, damage is observed to the FDOT facility, cease all work until resolution to
 minimize further damage and a plan of action for restoration is obtained and approved by the
 Engineer.
 555-5 Documentation Requirements.
 555-5.1 Boring Path Report: Submit a Bore Path Report to the Engineer within seven
 days of the completion of each bore path. Include the following in the report:

 name of the utility owner, location and length of the drill head and any drill stems not removed
 from the bore path.
 4. Show the top elevation, diameter and material type of all utilities encountered
 and physically observed during the subsoil investigation. For all other obstructions encountered
 during a subsoil investigation or the installation, show the type of material, horizontal and
 vertical location, top and lowest elevation observed, and note if the obstruction continues below
 the lowest point observed.
 5. Include bore notes on each plan stating the final bore path diameter, product
 diameter, drilling fluid composition, composition of any other materials used to fill the annular
 void between the bore path and the product, or facility placed out of service. Note if the product
 is a casing as well as the size and type of carrier pipes placed within the casing as part of the
 Contract work.
 555-6 Compensation.
 No direct payment will be made for directional bore. Include the cost to perform this
 operation in the Contract price for the item being installed.
 No compensation will be made for failed bore paths, injection of flowable fill, products

 JACK AND BORE
 556-1 Description.
 556-1.1 Scope of Work: The work specified in this Section documents the approved
 construction methods, procedures and materials for Jack and Bore (J&B), also known as auger
 boring. Micro tunneling (MT) is also included in the category of J&B for purposes of
 Specifications.
 556-1.2 General: J&B is a method for installing a product (often called a casing) that
 may serve as a direct conduit for liquids or gases, or as a duct for carrier (Pipe, cable, or wire line
 products). It is a multi-stage process consisting of constructing a temporary horizontal jacking
 platform and a starting alignment track in an entrance pit at a desired elevation. The product is
 then jacked by manual control along the starting alignment track with simultaneous excavation
 of the soil being accomplished by a rotating cutting head in the leading edge of the product’s
 annular space. The ground up soil (spoil) is transported back to the entrance pit by helical wound
 auger flights rotating inside the product. J&B typically provides limited tracking and steering as
 well as limited support to the excavation face.
 MT is conducted similar to J&B with the exception that it is remotely controlled,
 guided pipe jacking process that provides continuous support to the excavation face. The
 guidance system usually consists of a laser mounted in the tunneling drive shaft which
 communicates a reference line to a target mounted inside the MT machine’s articulated steering
 head. The MT process provides the ability to control the excavation face stability by applying
 mechanical or fluid pressure to counterbalance the earth and hydrostatic pressures.
 Removal and disposition of excess material varies, is the responsibility of the
 boring contractor and is not covered under this Specification. However, the cost of removal or
 final disposition is included in the cost of the J&B operation.
 No J&B conduit may be left open ended without approval of the Engineer.
 556-2 Materials.
 Select materials approved for installation within the right-of-way based on their
 suitability for the construction method as defined in Table 556-2.1. After determining product
 suitability, individual material standards as contained in Table 556-2.2 apply.

 Unless otherwise tested and approved by the Department, only use encasement pipe or
 uncased carrier pipe material that is new and has smooth interior and exterior walls.
 When the Plans show that the casing is to be used as a drainage carrier pipe,
 extend the casing the entire length from drainage structure to drainage structure. When using
 uncased carrier pipe, use pipe meeting the requirements in 556-4.3. Maintain a uniform diameter,
 wall thickness and material type for the entire length of the casing.
 556-2.1 Steel Pipe Casing and Welds: In addition to meeting or exceeding the
 conditions contained in Table 556-2.1 and Table 556-2.2, meet the following requirements:
 1. The size of the steel casing must be at least 6 inches larger than the
 largest outside diameter of the carrier. Casing size must accommodate pressure pipe or carrier
 pipe joint restraints.
 2. The casing pipe must be straight seam pipe, spiral seam pipe, or
 seamless pipe.
 3. All steel pipe may be bare inside and out, with the manufacturer’s
 recommended minimum nominal wall thicknesses to meet the greater of either installation,
 loading or carrier requirements.
 4. All steel casing pipe must be square cut and have dead-even lengths
 which are compatible with the J&B equipment.
 Use steel pipe casings and welds meeting or exceeding the thickness requirements
 to achieve the service life requirements noted in the Department Drainage Manual Chapter 6. For
 purposes of determining service life, ensure that casings installed under roadways meet or exceed
 cross drain requirements and casings under driveways meet or exceed side drain pipe
 requirements. For pipe used in drainage applications, use pipe meeting the requirements in 5564.3. For purposes of material classification, consider steel pipe casing structural plate steel pipe.
 Ensure that steel pipe casing of insufficient length achieves the required length through fully
 welded joints. Ensure that joints are air-tight and continuous over the entire circumference of the
 pipe with a bead equal to or exceeding the minimum of either that required to meet the thickness

 criteria of the pipe wall for jacking and loading or service life. All welding shall be done in
 accordance with the American Welding Society Structural Welding Code- Steel D1.1.
 556-2.2 Reinforced Concrete Pipe Casing: In addition to meeting or exceeding the
 conditions contained in Tables 556-2.1 and Table 556-2.2, meet the following requirements:
 Ensure that concrete pipe complies with the following minimum requirements:
 1. 5,000 psi concrete compressive strength
 2. Class III, IV, or V as required by load calculations, with a C-wall
 3. Full circular inner and/or outer reinforcing cage
 4. Multiple layers of steel reinforcing cages, wire splices, laps and spacers
 are permanently secured together by welding in place
 5. Straight outside pipe wall with no bell modification
 6. No elliptical reinforcing steel is allowed
 7. Single cage reinforcement with a 1 inch minimum cover from the inside
 wall
 8. Double cage reinforcement with a 1 inch minimum cover from each
 wall
 9. Joints are gasket type
 10. Additional joint reinforcement
 11. For drainage applications, use pipe meeting the requirements in 5564.3.
 Upon installation, the Engineer may, at his discretion, require the Contractor to
 perform concrete wiping or injection of the joints if it is believed the joints have not maintained
 their water tightness during the jacking operation. No additional payment will be made for this
 operation.
 556-2.3 Plastic Pipe Casing: Plastic pipe may be jacked and bored if its physical
 properties meet or exceed the conditions contained in Tables 556-2.1 and 556-2.2, and has a
 sufficient wall thickness to maintain proper alignment without exceeding the deflection
 requirements in Section 430-9.3. If plastic pipe is Jacked and Bored it may not be used as a
 pressurized carrier. Plastic pipe casing installed by the jack and bore method requires the use of
 an auger. Open end jacking without the use of an auger for continuous cleanout of the bore as the
 pipe is advanced is not permitted. Closed end jacking is not permitted.
 For drainage applications, use pipe meeting the requirements in 556-4.3.
 556-2.4 Pipe Couplings and Joints: In addition to meeting or exceeding the conditions
 contained in Tables 556-2.1 and 556-2.2, to minimize potential for bore failure, couplings must
 not project at right angles from the casing diameter by more than 3/4 inch.
 1. Steel Pipe Coupling and Joints:
 a. Welds must comply with 556-2.1(4) when couplings are not used or
 when the coupling thickness is less than the casing thickness.
 b. When couplings are used the casing joint needs only to be tack welded.
 Couplings must have a full bead weld such that the thickness, when measured at an angle of
 45 degrees to the casing and coupling interface, must be no less than the casing thickness.
 2. Plastic Pipe Couplings and Joints:
 a. Must meet or exceed all ASTM strength and composition standards
 established for the casing material to which they are being attached.
 b. Joints must be made sufficiently strong to withstand the pressures of
 jacking. All chemical welds must be completely set and cured before any jacking is attempted.

 556-3 Construction Site Requirements.
 556-3.1 Site Conditions:
 1. Carry out excavation for entry, exit, recovery pits, auger slurry sump pits, or
 any other excavation as specified in Section 120. When using auger fluids, the sump pits must
 contain auger fluids if vacuum devices are not operated throughout the boring operation.
 2. Within 48 hours of completing installation of the boring product, ensure that
 the work site is cleaned of all excess auger fluids or spoils. Removal and final disposition of
 excess fluids or spoils is the responsibility of the boring contractor and ensure that the work site
 is restored to pre-construction conditions or as identified in the Plans.
 3. Restore excavated areas in accordance with the Specifications and Standard
 Plans.
 4. Provide MOT in accordance with the Department Standard Plans and the
 MUTCD when and where the former is silent.

 reduce skin friction as well as provides a method for the slurry lubricant to coat the outside of the
 casing.
 8. At least 20 feet of full diameter auger at the leading end of the casing.
 Subsequent auger size may be reduced, but the reduced auger diameter must be at least 75% of
 the full auger diameter.
 9. Water to be injected inside the casing to facilitate spoil removal. The point of
 injection shall be no closer than 2 feet from the leading edge of the casing.
 556-4.3 Testing:
 556-4.3.1 Testing Requirements: Ensure all casing joints meet the Department’s
 watertight pressure requirements in accordance with Section 430. Testing may consist of one of
 the following methods but must always meet or exceed Department testing requirements.
 1. Follow the Product Manufacturer’s pressure testing recommendations.
 2. Carrier pipes installed without a casing must meet the pressure
 requirements set by the owner. If the owner does not require pressure testing, the Engineer may
 require at least one test.
 556-4.3.2 Drainage Application Testing (Under Pavement): When under
 pavement (including sidewalk) and front shoulders, all J&B pipe installations must meet or
 exceed the Department’s water tight pipe and joint configuration in accordance with Section 430.
 The Engineer will determine when and where water tight joint requirements shall be applied to
 the ultimate roadway section for future widening. When under the pavement, conduct an air
 pressure test for leaks in the presence of the Engineer at a minimum test pressure of 20 PSI by
 either of the following methods.
 1. 24 hour pressure test with a recording chart or,
 2. A dragnet type leak detector or equivalent device capable of detecting
 pressure drops of 1/2 PSI for a time period recommended by the manufacturer.
 556-4.3.3 Drainage Application Testing (Not Under Pavement): When J&B
 pipe installations are not located under the pavement, the pipe and joint configuration must meet
 or exceed soil tight joint requirements. The test for a soil tight joint allows up to 0.1 gallon of
 water leakage at a sustained pressure of 2 PSI. Conduct test for joint integrity for one hour.
 556-4.3. 4 Damaged Product Testing: When there is any indication that the
 installed product has sustained damage and may leak, stop the work, notify the Engineer and
 investigate damage. The Engineer may require a pressure test and reserves the right to be present
 during the test. Perform pressure test within 24 hours unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 Submit the test results to the Engineer for review and approval. The Engineer shall be allowed up
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 773
 
 to 72 hours to approve or determine if the product installation is not in compliance with
 Specifications. The Engineer may require non-compliant installations to be filled with
 excavatable flowable fill at no cost to the Department.
 556-4.4 Product Locating and Tracking: Install all facilities such that their location can
 be readily determined by electronic designation after installation. For non-conductive
 installations, attach a minimum of two separate and continuous conductive tracking (tone wire)
 materials, either externally, internally, or integral with the product. Use either a continuous green
 sheathed solid conductor copper wire line (minimum #12 AWG for external placement or
 minimum #14 AWG for internal placement in the conduit/casing) or a coated conductive tape.
 Ensure that conductors are located on opposite sides when installed externally. Connect any
 break in the conductor line before construction with an electrical clamp or solder, and coat the
 connection with a rubber or plastic insulator to maintain the integrity of the connection from
 corrosion. Clamp connections must be made of brass or copper and of the butt end type with
 wires secured by compression. Soldered connections must be made by tight spiral winding of
 each wire around the other with a finished length minimum of 3 inches overlap. Tracking
 conductors must extend 2 feet beyond bore termini. Conductors must be tested for continuity.
 Identify each conductor that passes by removing the last 6 inches of the sheath. No deductions
 are allowed for failed tracking conductors. Failed conductor ends must be wound into a small
 coil and left attached for future use.
 556-4.5 Augering Fluids: Use a mixture of bentonite clay or other approved stabilizing
 agent mixed with potable water with a minimum pH of 6.0 to create the drilling fluid for
 lubrication and soil stabilization. Vary the fluid viscosity to best fit the soil conditions
 encountered. Do not use other chemicals or polymer surfactant in the drilling fluid without
 written consent of the Engineer. Certify in writing to the Engineer that any chemicals to be added
 are environmentally safe and not harmful or corrosive to the facility. Identify the source of water
 for mixing the drilling fluid. Approvals and permits are required for obtaining water from such
 sources as streams, rivers, ponds or fire hydrants. Any water source used other than potable
 water may require a pH Test.
 556-4.6 Micro-Tunneling (MT) and Micro Tunnel Boring Machine (MTBM)
 Requirements:
 556-4.6.1 Performance Requirements: The MTBM must meet the following
 minimum performance requirements:

 9. Indication of pressure of the slurry in the slurry chamber.
 556-4.7 Failed Bore Path: If conditions warrant removal of any materials installed in a
 failed bore path, as determined by the Engineer, it will be at no cost to the Department. Promptly
 fill all voids by injecting all taken out of service products that have any annular space with
 excavatable flowable fill.
 556-5 Jack and Bore and Micro-Tunneling Operations:
 556-5.1 Installation Process: Provide continuous pressure to the face of the excavation
 to balance groundwater and earth pressures. Ensure that shafts are of sufficient size to
 accommodate equipment, the pipe selected and to allow for safe working practices. Provide entry
 and exit seals at shaft walls to prevent inflows of groundwater, soil, slurry and lubricants. Use
 thrust blocks designed to distribute loads in a uniform manner so that any deflection of the thrust
 block is uniform and does not impart excessive loads on the shaft itself or cause the jacking
 frame to become misaligned.
 The jacking system must have the capability of pushing the pipe in J&B
 operations or MTBM and pipe for MT operations through the ground in a controlled manner and
 be compatible with the anticipated jacking loads and pipe capacity. Monitor the jacking force
 applied to the pipe and do not exceed the pipe manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Ensure that the pipe lubrication system is functional at all times and sufficient to
 reduce jacking loads. Use pipe lubrication systems that include a mixing tank, holding tank and
 pumps to convey lubricant from the holding tank to application points at the rear of the MTBM.
 Maintain sufficient fluids on site to avoid loss of lubrication.
 Power Distribution System must be identified in the Plans package or permit
 provisions as well as any noise constraints. Identity spoil removal capability and method to avoid
 creating hindrance to other activities which may be necessary in the area.
 556-5.2 Excess Material and Fluids: Monitor the pumping rate, pressures, viscosity and
 density of the boring fluids to ensure adequate removal of soil cuttings and the stability of the
 borehole. Contain excess drilling fluids, slurry and soil cuttings at entry and exit points in pits
 until they are recycled or removed from the site.
 Ensure that all boring fluids and other materials are disposed of or recycled in a
 manner acceptable to the appropriate Federal, State, and Local Rules and Regulations. When
 jacking and boring in known or suspected areas of contaminated groundwater or soil, coordinate
 with the Engineer and District Contamination Coordinator (DCIC) during the pre-construction
 meeting and prior to the start of boring to determine the best course of action for J&B activities
 within the contaminated area. If the J&B operation encounters an unidentified area of
 contamination or abnormal condition indicating the presence of potentially contaminated
 material, stop operations and contact the Engineer immediately. Do not continue boring without
 the Engineer’s approval.
 556-5.3 Boring Failure: If an obstruction is encountered which prevents completion of
 the installation in accordance with the design location and Specifications; the pipe may be taken
 out of service and left in place at the discretion of the Engineer. Immediately fill the product left
 in place with excavatable flowable fill. Submit a new installation procedure and revised plans to
 the Engineer for approval before resuming work at another location. If damage is observed to
 any property, cease all work until a plan of action to minimize further damage and restore
 damaged property is submitted and approved by the Engineer.

 retrieval methods, determine the chloride, sulfate and nitrate concentrations on all steel surfaces
 using soluble salts test kits meeting the requirements of 560-2.4. Measure the concentration
 levels using the method described in SSPC-TU 4. Perform the tests after washing and after each
 applied coat of the coating system. Ensure the non-visible surface contaminant concentrations on
 blast-cleaned surfaces do not exceed 7 µg/cm2 for chlorides, 10 µg/cm2 for soluble ferrous iron,
 17 µg/cm2 for sulfates and 10 µg/cm2 for nitrates. When using electronic conductivity meters,
 use meters meeting the requirements of 560-2.4 and measure the surface conductivity as
 prescribed by the manufacturer. The instrument shall be properly calibrated and maintained
 according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Ensure the surface conductivity does not
 exceed 70 micro-Siemens per centimeter squared. For either contaminant assessment method
 (salt test kits or conductivity meter) test three random locations in the first 1000 square feet and
 one random location for each subsequent 1000 square feet. When quality control documentation
 at a fixed location indicates 36 months of historical sequential soluble salt/conductivity levels
 below those specified above, soluble salt/conductivity testing frequency may be reduced to one
 test per day. When any concentration or conductivity measurement exceeds the levels given
 above, rewash the entire surface area and retest all potentially contaminated steel to the
 satisfaction of the Engineer. If additional washing does not reduce the concentration to the
 acceptable level, a surface treatment or water additive may be used. Use a surface treatment or
 water additive that is approved by the coating system supplier and the Engineer.

 prevent runoff to grade of any spilled material.
 560-9.6 Application Methods: Use coating application equipment and apply coatings
 per the coating manufacturer’s product data sheet. Application with brushes may be permitted for
 minor touchup of spray applications, stripe coats, or when otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 Adjust spray equipment to produce an even, wet coat with minimum overspray. Apply coatings
 in even, parallel passes, overlapping 50 percent. Agitate coatings during application as required
 by the coating manufacturer’s product data sheet.
 560-9.7 Stripe Coating: Use an aluminum epoxy mastic that is at least 80% solids by
 volume. Apply a stripe coat after the prime coat, but prior to applying the intermediate coat.
 Also, apply a stripe coat after the intermediate coat but prior to the finish coat. Apply the stripe
 coat per the manufacturers published product data sheet but no less than 3 mils dry film
 thickness. Apply both stripe coats to achieve complete coverage on welds, corners, crevices,
 sharp edges, bolts, nuts, rivets, and rough or pitted surfaces. A stripe coat of translucent coatings
 is not required. Do not apply subsequent coats until the previous stripe coat has cured per the
 manufacturer’s product data sheet for recoating. Stripe coating is not required for the inside
 surface area of all steel box girders.
 560-9.8 Thickness of Coats: Apply coatings to the thickness as identified in the
 manufacturer’s product data sheet. After application of each coat, thoroughly inspect the surfaces
 and measure the dry film thickness (DFT) in accordance with SSPC-PA 2. As an exception to
 SSPC-PA2, the DFT of the prime coat shall not be less than the minimum specified by the
 manufacturer’s product data sheet. When the DFT is deficient or excessive, correct in accordance
 with the coating manufacturer’s recommendations and retest the area.
 560-9.9 Coating Drying, and Curing: Apply coatings within the time specified by the
 coating manufacturer’s product data sheet for drying and recoating. Test the coating for proper
 cure before handling and shipping. Test for cure in accordance with the manufacturer’s
 recommended method. Meet the requirements of ASTM D4752 for inorganic zinc primers or

 649-5 Installation.
 Install foundations in accordance with Section 455. Do not install poles, mast arm poles,
 or monotubes until the foundation has achieved 70% of the specified 28-day concrete strength
 and verifying test results have been submitted to the Engineer. Determine concrete strength from
 tests on a minimum of two test cylinders prepared and tested in accordance with ASTM C31 and
 ASTM C39. Before erecting the pole, clean the top of the foundation of any laitance, oils, grease
 or any other deleterious materials. Erect strain poles in an orientation which considering the rake
 and the application, cable forces will produce a plumb pole. Erect monotubes plumb at the time
 of installation. Plumb the pole supporting mast arms after the mast arms, traffic signals or sign
 panels have been placed.
 If the traffic signals and/or sign panels are not in place within two working days after the
 mast arm is erected, furnish and install a 3 foot x 2 foot blank sign panel on the bottom of each
 mast arm within 6 feet of the mast arm tip and plumb the pole. Re-plumb the pole supporting
 mast arms after installation of traffic signals and sign panels.
 Install ASTM F3125, Grade A325 bolt, nut and washer assemblies in accordance with the
 following. Use bolt, nut and washer assemblies that are free of rust and corrosion and are
 lubricated properly as demonstrated by being able to easily hand turn the nut on the bolt thread
 for its entire length. Tighten nuts to a snug tight condition to bring the faying surfaces of the
 assembly into full contact which is referred to as snug-tight. Snug-tight is defined as the
 maximum nut rotation resulting from the full effort of one person using a 12 inch long wrench or
 equivalent. After bringing the faying surfaces to a snug-tight condition, tighten nuts in
 accordance with Table 460-7, Nut Rotation from the Snug Tight Condition. Maintain uniform
 contact pressure on the faying surfaces during snugging and turn-of-nut process, by using a bolt
 tightening pattern that balances the clamping force of each bolt, as closely as possible, with the
 equal clamping force of a companion bolt.
 Base plate installation steps are as follows:
 1. Verify that the nuts can be turned onto the bolts past the elevation
 corresponding to the bottom of each in-place leveling nut and be backed off by the effort of one
 person on a 12 inch long wrench, without employing a pipe extension on the wrench handle.
 2. Clean and lubricate the exposed threads of all anchor bolts. Clean and lubricate
 the threads and bearing surfaces of all leveling nuts. Re-lubricate the exposed threads of the
 anchor bolts and the threads of the leveling nuts if more than 24 hours has elapsed since earlier
 lubrication, or if the anchor bolts and leveling nuts have become wet since they were first
 lubricated.
 3. Turn the leveling nuts onto the anchor bolts and align the nuts to the same
 elevation.
 4. Place structural plate washers on top of the leveling nuts; one washer
 corresponding to each anchor bolt.

 859
 
 5. Install the base plate onto the leveling nut washers, place structural plate
 washers on top of the base plate; one washer corresponding to each anchor bolt, and turn the top
 nuts onto the anchor bolts.
 6. Tighten top nuts to a snug-tight condition in a star pattern. A star tightening
 pattern is one in which the nuts on opposite or near opposite sides of the bolt circle are
 successively tightened in a pattern resembling a star. For an 8 bolt circle with bolts sequentially
 numbered 1 to 8, tighten nuts in the following bolt order: (1, 5, 7, 3, 8, 4, 6, 2).
 7. Tighten leveling nuts to a snug-tight condition in a star pattern. The distance
 from the bottom of the leveling nuts to the top of the concrete must not exceed one anchor bolt
 diameter.
 8. Before final tightening of the top nuts, mark the reference position of each tip
 nut in a snug-tight condition with a suitable marking on one flat with a corresponding reference
 mark on the base plate at each bolt. Then incrementally turn the top nuts using a star pattern until
 achieving the required nut rotation specified in Table A. Turn the nuts at least 2 full tightening
 cycles (passes). After tightening, verify the nut rotation. Do not exceed the Table A value by
 more than 20 degrees.
 9. Tighten each retainer or jam nut until it is in firm contact with the top surface
 of the anchor bolt nut; then while preventing the anchor bolt nut from rotating, tighten the jam
 nut unit it is snug tight.
 10. Install a screen over the gap between the base plate and foundation concrete in
 accordance with 649-6, or place a structural grout pad in accordance with 649-7.

 weight of 50 sacks, taken at random, is less than the designated weight, the cement shall be
 rejected.
 921-5 Quality Control Plan.
 921-5.1 General: The Quality Control Program of a cement supplier shall conform to
 Section 105. Cement suppliers shall submit a proposed QC Plan to the State Materials Office for
 plan approval. In addition to the QC Plan, the supplier must submit test reports from an approved
 laboratory which certifies that the cement in current production or supply conforms to these
 Specifications. Upon initial QC Plan approval and receipt of the cement mill test report, the
 suppliers will be placed in an approved source status with an approved quality control plan. An
 approved laboratory shall perform one quality control test per day. Submit the monthly mill test
 report to the State Materials Office. The mill test report shall indicate that the cement meets the
 requirements of this Specification. Also, the corresponding samples along with mill test reports
 shall be submitted to the Department, upon request.
 Producers intending to use limestone as a component material in the production of
 cement shall describe the type and source of the limestone. In addition, the producer shall supply
 the Department with a sample of the limestone, a sample of the cement prior to the limestone
 being added and a sample of the cement after the limestone has been added. The analysis of these
 materials will be used as a baseline for information. In the event that the source of limestone used
 by the cement producer changes, additional samples of both the limestone and the cement with
 the limestone added shall be provided to the State Materials Office for evaluation.
 Representatives from the Department may take samples from the cement
 production facility at a minimum of once per year to verify compliance with the producer’s QC
 Plan.
 The supplier’s QC Plan shall be sufficient to insure that more than 97% of all
 cement delivered for Department work shall meet all Specification requirements. Upon request of
 the Department, the supplier shall provide split samples of the cement collected for quality
 control testing. Split samples shall be delivered to the State Materials Office and shall be
 identified as representing a designated LOT of cement.

 with a current QC Plan approval may be accepted on the basis of mill test reports meeting the
 
 Return to Table of Contents
 
 1044
 
 requirements of the applicable AASHTO and FDOT Specifications and a delivery ticket on the
 producer’s letterhead and traceable to the mill test report. Mill test reports shall be submitted
 upon request to the State Materials Office and corresponding samples for verification testing.
 Quality control testing shall be performed by an approved laboratory.
 921-5.3 Cement Ownership and Responsibility: For purposes of QC Plan approval
 status, the cement supplier shall be responsible for cement quality until the cement is accepted by
 the concrete producer. Where the cement has been accepted by a concrete producer and is
 subsequently found deficient, the concrete plant QC Plan approval may be withdrawn with
 respect to further use of that cement and reinstated only when the deficiency is adequately
 resolved. Reinstatement is made by the State Materials Office.
 921-5.4 Quality Control Plan Approval Control: The State Materials Office may
 withdraw QC Plan approval and may require cement shipments to be individually tested prior to
 incorporation into Department work. QC Plan approvals may be rescinded when the performance
 of cement is in question, including problems with concrete quality, inconsistent quality control
 data, or failure of quality control or verification test results. Discontinuance of approval may be
 based on testing at the point of use, testing by the manufacturer or proven poor performance of
 the cement in concrete.
 In the specific instance of a failing cement sample taken by the Department at the
 cement source, the failure shall initiate the Department to retest the sample. Failure of the retest
 will be considered adequate evidence to withdraw the QC Plan of the cement supplier.
 Notification of failing test results will be distributed to the cement supplier (and
 concrete producers, if applicable) as designated in the approved QC Plan. Split samples of the
 initial sample may be provided to the cement supplier and concrete producer upon request.
 Reinstatement of the QC Plan will occur when the cement producer identifies and
 corrects the specific cause of the failures or that a statistical analysis indicates that the current
 cement production meets or exceeds the requirements of this Specification.
 921-5.5 Sampling of Cement: The verification samples may be taken at the
 manufacturer’s plant, distribution facility or at the concrete production facility. Samples shall be
 obtained by one of the methods in FM 5-503. Samples sizes shall be a minimum of one quart. At
 the concrete production facility, cement samples shall be jointly obtained by the Department
 Inspector and the concrete producer’s representative.

 **The time of efflux is the time to fill a one liter container placed directly under the flow cone. Modify the ASTM C939 test
 by filling the cone to the top instead of to the standard level.
 ***Modify ASTM C940 to conform with the wick induced bleed test as follows:
 (a) Use a wick made of a 20 inch length of ASTM A416 seven wire 0.5 inch diameter strand. Wrap the strand with
 2 inch wide duct or electrical tape at each end prior to cutting to avoid splaying of the wires when it is cut. Degrease (with
 acetone or hexane solvent) and wire brush to remove any surface rust on the strand before temperature conditioning.
 (b) Mix the conditioned dry ingredients with the conditioned mixing water and place 800 ml of the resulting grout
 into the 1,000 ml graduate cylinder. Measure and record the volume of the grout.
 (c) Completely insert the strand into the graduated cylinder. Center and fasten the strand so it remains essentially
 parallel to the vertical axis of the cylinder. Measure and record the level of the top of the grout.
 (d) Calculate the bleed water, if any, at the end of the 3 hour test period and the resulting expansion per the
 procedures outlined in ASTM C940, with the quantity of bleed water expressed as a percent of the initial grout volume. Note if
 the bleed water remains above or below the top of the original grout height. Note if any bleed water is absorbed into the
 specimen during the test.
 
 938-4.3 Accelerated Corrosion Test Method (ACTM): Perform the ACTM as outlined
 in Appendix B of the Specification for Grouting of Post-Tensioning Structures published by the
 Post-Tensioning Institute. Report the time to corrosion for both the grout being tested and the
 control sample using a 0.45 water-cement ratio neat grout.
 A grout that shows a longer average time to corrosion in the ACTM than the
 control sample and the time to corrosion exceed 1,000 hours is considered satisfactory.

 FERTILIZER
 982-1 Fertilizers.
 Fertilizers shall comply with the State fertilizer laws.
 The numerical designations for fertilizer indicate the minimum percentages (respectively)
 of total nitrogen, available phosphoric acid, and water-soluble potash, contained in the fertilizer.
 At least 50% of the nitrogen shall be from a slow-release source.
 982-2 Certification.
 The Contractor shall submit to the Engineer a certified test report from the manufacturer
 of the commercial fertilizer confirming that the requirements of this Section are met. The
 certified test report shall conform to the requirements of Section 6 and include test results for
 total nitrogen, available phosphoric acid, water-soluble potash, and sulfur. Each certification
 shall cover one batch per type for dry type fertilizer.
 982-3 Fertilizer Rates.
 Soil laboratory fertilization recommendations are based on the amount (lbs) of nutrients
 (N, P 2 O 5 , K 2 O) to apply per given area (usually 1,000 square feet.). From this recommendation
 it is necessary to select an appropriate fertilizer grade and then determine how much of this
 fertilizer to apply to the area.
 If a complete fertilizer (containing all three primary nutrients) is not available in the ratio
 of N-P-K necessary to match the ratio required in the fertilizer recommendation, mixed-grade or
 single-nutrient fertilizers should be used to satisfy each nutrient requirement.
 To calculate fertilizer rates:
 1. Measure the area to be fertilized in square feet.
 2. Select fertilizers to be used based on the soil testing laboratory
 recommendations by matching the ratio of nutrients recommended to the fertilizer grades
 available.
 3. Determine the amount of fertilizer to apply to a given area (1,000 square feet.)
 by dividing the recommended amount of nutrient by the percentage of the nutrient (on a decimal
 basis) in the fertilizer. Apply no more than 0.25 lbs P 2 O 5 /1000 square feet per application prior
 to planting.
 4. Adjust the amount of fertilizer to the project area.

 994-3.5 Fabrication of Retroreflective Sign Faces.
 994-3.5.1 General: Fabricate signs with sign sheeting systems listed on the APL
 meeting the requirements in Section 700, the Standard Plans and the Plans.
 994-3.5.2 Application of Sheeting: Apply retroreflective sheeting to the base
 panels with mechanical equipment in a manner specified for the manufacture of traffic control
 signs by the sheeting manufacturer. For sheeting that has been identified as rotationally sensitive,
 apply white sheeting for cut-out legends, symbols, borders and route marker attachments within
 the parent sign face at the optimum rotation angle according to the identification markings.

 Apply all background sheeting at a uniform rotational angle. The retroreflective sheeting for each
 sign will be from the same roll or lot number. Apply consecutively alternate successive width
 sections of either sheeting or panels to ensure that corresponding edges of sheeting lie adjacent
 on the finished sign. If the sign cannot be constructed from retroreflective sheeting from the same
 roll or lot number, the fabricator may color match from a different lot; the color between the rolls
 cannot exceed three ΔE’s using test method ASTM D 2244. The Engineer will not accept
 nonconformance that may result in non-uniform shading and an undesirable contrast between
 adjacent widths of applied sheeting or non optimum retroreflectivity in the finished sign and
 installation.
 Sheeting is to be trimmed at 45 degree angle from the edge of each panel.
 Finish signs by sealing sheeting splices and sign edges according to sign manufacturer
 recommendations.
 994-3.5.3 Direct and Reverse Screen Processing: Screen message and borders
 on retroreflective sheeting in accordance with the recommendations of the ink or overlay
 manufacturer. Process messages either before or after applying the sheeting to the base panels.
 The transparent and opaque process inks furnished for direct and reverse
 screen processing shall be of a type and quality formulated for retroreflective sheeting materials
 as listed on the APL and applied in accordance with the manufacturer’s instruction. Screen
 processing in accordance with the techniques and procedures recommended by the manufacturer
 must produce a uniform legend of continuous stroke width of either transparent or opaque ink,
 with sharply defined edges and without blemishes on the sign background that will affect the
 intended sign use.
 994-3.5.4 Finished Sign Face: Provide finished signs with properly aligned clean
 cut and sharp messages and borders. Fabricated signs must be free of wrinkles, bubbles, foreign
 matter, scratches, free of patches, or other visually identifiable defects. Ensure that finished
 background panels are essentially a plane surface.
 994-3.5.5 Packaging and Labeling: For permanent roadway signs, label the back
 of all finished panels at the bottom edge with “FDOT”, the date of fabrication, sign sheeting
 system manufacturer, Type, and the fabricator’s initials. For Type VI non-reflective vinyl work
 zone signs, label the back of all finished panels at the bottom edge with “Daytime Use Only”.
 Make the labels unobtrusive, but legible enough to be easily read by an observer on the ground
 when the sign is in its final position. Apply the label in a manner that is at least as durable as the
 sign face.
 Properly package signs to protect them during storage, shipment and
 handling to prevent damage to the sign face and panel.
