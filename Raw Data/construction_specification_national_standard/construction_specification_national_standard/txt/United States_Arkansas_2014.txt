 SECTION 102
 BIDDING REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS
 102.01 Prequalification of Bidders. Prospective bidders, when
 requested, must present satisfactory evidence that they have been
 regularly engaged in the kind of work bid upon, giving the length of
 time so engaged, and that they are fully prepared with the necessary
 capital, material, machinery, and expert workers to carry out the
 Contract.
 A financial statement and experience record must be furnished on
 questionnaire forms specified by the Commission. These forms
 must be prepared by a Certified or Registered Public Accountant and
 filed by the prospective bidder. A bidder's period of qualification
 will be for one year, beginning with the effective date of the
 statement, plus a grace period of four months. Prospective bidders
 may file a questionnaire at any time; however, no proposal will be
 released to a bidder unless a rating has been extended based on an
 acceptable questionnaire. The Department will expect a review
 period of at least 5 business days before extending a rating.
 Contractors will be rated in accordance with the maximum amount
 of work it is deemed they can satisfactorily prosecute through any
 given period. The maximum amount of work considered will
 include the unfinished value of all contracts in force.
 The attention of prospective bidders is directed to Ark. Code
 Ann. §17-25-101 et seq., Act 150 of the 1965 Acts of Arkansas,
 being an "Act Regulating the Practice of Contracting in the State of
 Arkansas", and acts amendatory thereto. When the work offered is
 financed in whole with State funds and is estimated to cost $20,000
 or more, the prospective bidder must show evidence of license with
 the Contractors Licensing Board for the State of Arkansas before
 being furnished with a proposal form.
 When a project is funded in whole or in part with Federal Aid
 funds, the Commission does not require the bidder to be licensed to
 bid. Any contractor, otherwise qualified by the State of Arkansas to
 perform such work, is not required to be licensed nor to submit
 application for license before submitting a bid or having such bid
 considered; provided, however, that such exemption does not
 constitute a waiver of the State's right under its license laws to
 require a contractor, determined to be a successful bidder, to be
 12
 
 102
 licensed to do business in the State of Arkansas in connection with
 the execution of an ensuing Contract. (See also subsection 103.02.)
 For informational purposes, proposals marked "not for bidding"
 may be obtained upon request without the prequalification or
 licensing requirement.
 102.02 Notice to Contractors. After the date is fixed for the
 letting of work, the Department will give notice of such letting to
 contractors. The Notice to Contractors will contain a description of
 the proposed work, and information to the bidder regarding access to
 proposal forms, plans, and specifications, and the amount and nature
 of the proposal guaranty. This notice will be published as required
 by State law.
 102.03 Contents of Proposal Form. The proposal form will
 state the location and description of the contemplated construction
 and will show the estimate of the various quantities and kinds of
 work to be performed or materials to be furnished, and will have a
 schedule of items for which unit bid prices are invited. The proposal
 form will state the time in which the work must be completed, the
 amount of the proposal guaranty, and the date and time of the letting
 of work. The form will also include any special provisions or
 requirements that vary from or are not contained in the standard
 specifications.
 All papers bound with or attached to the proposal form are
 considered a part thereof and should not be detached or altered when
 the proposal is submitted.
 The plans, specifications, and other documents designated in the
 proposal form will be considered a part of the proposal whether
 attached or not.
 102.04 Issuance of Proposals. Proposals will only be issued to
 prequalified contractors or their authorized representatives upon
 request.
 If the prospective bidder's prequalification rating is not
 "unlimited", the bidder shall file a certification with the Department
 citing all contracts in force and the unfinished value of such work.
 Proposals will not be issued until a certification for the current
 bidding period is on file and the amount of work the contractor may
 be allowed to undertake is determined.
 The contractor's
 13
 
 102
 prequalification rating, less the unfinished value of all contracts in
 force, will determine the amount of additional work that the
 contractor may be allowed to undertake. Proposals covering
 individual projects for which the estimated cost is more than the
 amount that the contractor may be allowed to undertake will not be
 issued, but the contractor may be issued proposals on more than one
 project, providing that the estimated cost of each project is not more
 than the amount that the contractor may be allowed to undertake. In
 the event a contractor submits a low bid on more than one project
 and the aggregate amount is greater than the amount the contractor
 may be allowed to undertake, the Commission will exercise its
 discretion in the award of a particular project or projects.
 A charge will be made for proposals and plans issued. Payment
 shall be made at the time proposals or plans are received or upon
 receipt of statement therefor. No refund will be allowed for plans or
 proposals returned.
 Plans, proposal forms, and specifications may be examined in the
 Programs and Contracts Division at the Arkansas State Highway and
 Transportation Department, 10324 Interstate 30, Little Rock,
 Arkansas during regular business hours and may be purchased
 until4:30 p.m. on the day prior to the scheduled bid opening.
 The Department reserves the right to refuse to issue, accept, or
 consider a proposal for any of the following reasons:
 (a) Failure to comply with the prequalification requirements of
 the Department.
 (b) Lack of competency and adequate machinery, plant, and other
 equipment, as revealed by the financial statement and experience
 questionnaires required under subsection 102.01.
 (c) Uncompleted work that, in the judgment of the Department,
 might hinder or prevent the prompt completion of additional work if
 awarded.
 (d) Failure to pay or satisfactorily settle all bills due for labor and
 material on former contracts in force at the time of issuance of
 proposals.
 (e) Misconduct which, in the opinion of the Engineer, is of such a
 serious nature as to adversely affect the ability of the Contractor to
 perform future work.
 14
 
 102
 (f) Debarment or suspension currently in effect.
 (g) Failure to reimburse the Department for moneys owed on any
 previously awarded contracts including those where the prospective
 bidder is a party to a joint venture and the joint venture has failed to
 reimburse the Department for moneys owed.
 (h) Previous failure to execute a Contract and/or submit
 acceptable bonds for any subsequent advertisement of that project.
 (i) Unsatisfactory performance on previous work.
 (j) If the prospective bidder is the Contractor on a current
 Contract with the Commission on which Liquidated Damages are
 being assessed, and there are no pending time extensions warranted
 to remove the project from Liquidated Damages; or if the
 prospective bidder has an individual, as an officer/owner/partner of
 any firm, partnership, or corporation which has a current Contract
 with the Commission on which Liquidated Damages are being
 assessed, and there are no pending time extensions warranted to
 remove the project from Liquidated Damages.
 (k) If the prospective bidder has a current Contract in default or
 has an officer/owner/partner of any firm, partnership, or corporation
 which has a current Contract in default. (l) Failure to pay any bills
 owed the Department.
 (m) Failure to submit a Certification of Officers/Owners/Partners.
 102.05 Interpretation of Quantities in Proposal Schedule. The
 quantities appearing in the schedule are approximate only and are
 prepared for the comparison of bids. Payment to the Contractor will
 be made only for the actual quantities of work performed and
 accepted or materials furnished in accordance with the Contract.
 The scheduled quantities of work to be done and materials to be
 furnished may each be increased, decreased, or omitted as
 hereinafter provided.
 102.06 Examination of Plans, Specifications, Special
 Provisions, and the Site of the Work. The Department will
 provide full, complete, and accurate plans and specifications giving
 such directions as will enable any competent mechanic or contractor
 to carry them out. The bidder is expected to examine carefully the
 site of the proposed work, the proposal, plans, specifications,
 supplemental specifications, special provisions, and contract forms
 15
 
 102
 before submitting a proposal. The submission of a bid shall be
 considered prima facie evidence that the bidder has made such
 examination and is satisfied as to the conditions to be encountered in
 performing the work and as to the requirements of the plans,
 specifications, supplemental specifications, special provisions, and
 contract.
 When the plans or special provisions include information
 pertaining to subsurface exploration, boring logs, soil survey
 information, or other preliminary investigations, such information
 was obtained by the Department for design and estimating purposes
 only. This and other subsurface investigation information may be
 available and prospective bidders will be permitted to examine such
 information upon request. It is expressly understood and agreed that
 said information does not constitute a part of the Contract and
 represents only the best knowledge of the Department as to the
 location, character, and depth of the materials encountered. This
 information is only included and made available so that prospective
 bidders may have access to subsurface information obtained by the
 Department and is not intended to be a substitute for personal
 investigation, interpretation, and judgment of the bidder. The bidder
 should be cognizant of the possibility that conditions affecting the
 cost and/or quantities of work to be performed may differ from those
 indicated.
 102.07 Preparation of Proposal.
 The proposal shall be
 submitted upon the forms furnished to the prospective bidder by the
 Department. A computer-generated proposal schedule as described
 below may be used in lieu of the proposal schedule in the proposal.
 The bidder shall specify a unit price in figures for each pay item for
 which a quantity is given and should also show the products of the
 respective unit prices and quantities written in figures in the column
 provided for that purpose, and the total amount obtained by adding
 the amounts of the several items. These extensions and totals as
 calculated by the bidder are for information only; the total proposal
 amount will be the true sum of the products obtained by multiplying
 the approximate quantities by their respective unit bid prices. Any
 notes, comments, or amounts written outside the column headed
 "Unit Bid Price" will be disregarded when calculating the total
 proposal amount. A unit price of “zero” ($0.00) is a valid price and
 will be considered. A blank unit price is not considered valid except
 16
 
 102
 in the case of a lump sum item for which the price is entered in the
 column headed “Extension”. The unit bid price should not be
 carried beyond 1/10 cent ($0.001). Any figures on the unit bid price
 beyond 1/10 cent will be dropped. All figures shall be in ink and
 legible.
 Should a bidder need to change a unit bid price on the bid
 proposal schedule of items, the original entry shall be marked out
 and the new entry shall be initialed by the person signing the
 proposal or another officer of the firm. Should a bidder need to
 change an extension, subtotal, or total on the bid proposal schedule
 of items, the original entry should be marked out and the new entry
 should be initialed by the person signing the proposal or another
 officer of the firm. Changes are defined as any physical alterations
 to the original figures including, but not limited to erasures, crossouts, line-outs, or other corrections (e.g., liquid paper white-outs,
 tape corrections, etc.).
 If the bidder elects to use a computer-generated Proposal
 Schedule, the bidder should print the Job Number, Bidder's
 Company Name (as prequalified with the Department), and Page
 Number on each Proposal Schedule page and shall list the line
 numbers, items, and item quantities as shown on the Department
 Schedule of Items. The final page of the computer-generated
 Proposal Schedule shall contain the original signature of an
 authorized representative of the firm. Even though the bidder
 chooses this option, Page 3 of the Proposal form must still be signed,
 any applicable certification forms included in the proposal form
 must be executed, and the entire proposal form submitted.
 When plans and specifications permit the use of different types of
 materials for an item of work and when the proposal provides for
 these different acceptable materials in an alternate bid system, the
 bidder should enter a unit price and extension for only one of the
 two or more alternates listed for that item of work. Should unit
 prices be entered for more than one alternate of an item of work, the
 alternate with the lowest extension will be used when computing the
 contract amount.
 The bidder's proposal must be signed with ink by the individual,
 by one or more members of the partnership, by one or more
 members or officers of each firm representing a joint venture, or by
 17
 
 102
 one or more officers of a corporation, or by an agent of the
 Contractor legally qualified and acceptable to the Department.
 If the bidder's proposal is made by an individual, the name of the
 individual must be shown; by a partnership, the name of each
 partnership member must be shown; as a joint venture, the name of a
 member or officer of each of the firms represented by the joint
 venture must be shown; by a corporation, the name of the
 corporation must be shown. If the proposal is signed by any person
 who is not listed in the bidder's Prequalification Questionnaire
 (Questionnaire Form) as the individual, as a partner of a partnership,
 or as an officer of a corporation, authorization for such signature
 should be on file with the Department before opening of bids, or
 should accompany the proposal. This authorization shall be made
 before the opening of bids and be in the form of a Power of Attorney
 duly executed and signed by an official with power to constitute
 such authority.
 Various sections of these specifications provide for separate pay
 items for the major components of Mineral Aggregate/Asphalt
 Binder mixes, and it is intended that the unit bid prices submitted for
 these items are balanced according to their proportionate share of the
 in-place cost of the mix. To prevent gross unbalancing of bids on
 these components, a minimum unit bid price has been established
 for some or all of the pay items for Asphalt Binder. Those items of
 Asphalt Binder that are subject to a minimum bid price will bear the
 note "(Minimum bid price is $___ per ton)" within the Proposal
 Schedule.
 The Proposal Schedule may contain other various pay items
 which have a minimum or maximum unit bid price established.
 Unit bid prices submitted which are equal to or greater than the
 listed minimum price or which are equal to or less than the listed
 maximum price, will be computed and tabulated at the unit bid price
 submitted. However, any unit bid price submitted in an amount less
 than the specified minimum or greater than the specified maximum,
 will be automatically adjusted to the specified minimum or
 maximum and computed accordingly, without any counteradjustments in prices for other items. For items other than Asphalt
 Binder which have a minimum or maximum unit bid price
 established, the minimum or maximum unit bid price will be
 established within the applicable specification.
 18
 
 102
 The proposal for all federal aid projects will contain a bidders list.
 The bidder should complete the list by showing the name, address,
 and DBE designation for all subcontractors, material suppliers, or
 trucking firms that bid or provided quotes on any item on the
 project, regardless if the quotes were used or not used in the
 preparation of the bidder’s proposal. The information provided will
 be used to establish and maintain a master list of subcontractors,
 materials suppliers, and trucking firms for the development of the
 Department’s overall DBE goals. The information provided will not
 be used for contract awarding purposes but must be provided before
 the Contractor will be issued proposals for future lettings.
 102.08 Irregular Proposals. (a) Proposals will be considered
 irregular and will be rejected for the following reasons:
 (1) If changes are made to the entries for unit bid prices on the
 bid proposal schedule of items and they are not initialed by the
 person signing the proposal or an officer of the firm.
 (2) If the proposal does not contain a unit price for each pay
 item listed except in the case of authorized alternate pay items or
 lump sum pay items. In the case of a lump sum pay item, a price
 may be entered as a unit price or an extension.
 (3) If the proposal is not prepared and signed with ink.
 (4) If the final page of a computer generated Schedule of Items
 and Page 3 of the Proposal Form do not contain the original
 signature of an authorized representative of the firm.
 (5) If the computer generated Schedule of Items does not
 contain the items and item quantities shown on the Department’s
 Schedule of Items.
 (6) If the proposal is not accompanied by the proper proposal
 guaranty.
 (7) If a proposal is received from an individual, firm,
 partnership, or corporation with an interest, as principal, in
 another proposal for the same project.
 (8) If any unit price entered on the Schedule of Items or a
 computer-generated Schedule of Items is illegible.
 (9) If the proposal is not submitted by the prospective bidder
 who purchased the original proposal.
 19
 
 102
 (10) If the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE)
 Participation Form or the Certification to Submit DBE
 Participation is not completed and signed, or documentation to
 request consideration of a good faith effort is not included with
 the proposal.
 (b) Proposals will be considered irregular and may be rejected for
 the following reasons:
 (1) If the proposal is on a form other than that furnished or
 authorized by the Department; or if the form is altered except as
 authorized; or any part thereof is detached.
 (2) If there are unauthorized additions, conditional or alternate
 bids, or irregularities of any kind that may tend to make the
 proposal incomplete, indefinite, or ambiguous as to its meaning.
 (3) If the bidder adds any provisions reserving the right to
 accept or reject an award, or to enter into a contract pursuant to
 an award.
 (4) If any item entered on the Schedule of Items or a computergenerated Schedule of Items is ambiguous.
 (5) If the computer generated Schedule of Items does not
 contain the Job Number, Bidder’s Company Name (as
 prequalified by the Department), and Page Number on each
 Proposal Schedule page.
 (6) Unbalanced proposals in which the prices for some items
 are out of proportion to the reasonable costs representative of
 those items.
 102.09 Proposal Guaranty. No proposal will be considered by
 the Commission unless it is accompanied by a guaranty in the form
 of either a bank draft, certified check, or cashier's check drawn on a
 solvent bank or trust company, or a bidder's bond executed by an
 approved surety company. The guaranty shall be made payable to
 the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department and
 shall be in an amount not less than the amount indicated in the
 proposal, except that in a joint venture arrangement it will be
 permissible for each participating bidder to submit a lesser amount
 that, in aggregate, will meet the required total amount. A separate
 check or bidder's bond shall be furnished with each proposal
 submitted.
 20
 
 102
 102.10 Delivery of Proposals.
 Each proposal should be
 submitted in a special envelope furnished by the Department. The
 information provided on the submittal envelope shall clearly indicate
 that it contains a bid proposal for State Job (number) and should list
 the State job name and the name and address of the Contractor
 submitting the bid. The submittal envelope should be sealed and
 addressed to the Chief Engineer, Arkansas State Highway and
 Transportation Department. When sent by mail, the sealed submittal
 envelope should be enclosed in a second envelope addressed to the
 Chief Engineer, Arkansas State Highway and Transportation
 Department, P.O. Box 2261, Little Rock, Arkansas 72203, and
 identified as a bid proposal. In the event that the second envelope is
 not identified as a bid proposal, the Department will not be
 responsible for consideration of the proposal if it is not recognized
 as such by the time designated for receipt of proposals. If submitted
 other than by mail, it shall be delivered to the Division Head,
 Programs & Contracts Division, or an authorized representative,
 Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department,
 10324 Interstate 30, Little Rock, Arkansas. Any proposal received
 after the time stated in the proposal form for receipt of proposals
 will not be accepted and will be returned unopened to the bidder.
 102.11 Withdrawal/Modification of Proposals. (a) A bidder
 may withdraw or modify a proposal after it has been deposited with
 the Department, provided a request for withdrawal or modification,
 as described herein, is received by the Department before the time
 set for opening proposals. A proposal may also be withdrawn if the
 Commission fails to make an award within 40 calendar days after
 the date of opening.
 (b) A request to withdraw or modify a proposal before bid
 opening must be legible and in one of the following forms.
 (1) Written Request. Written requests for release of the bid
 proposal shall be signed by the bidder and delivered by the person
 who is to take possession of the proposal. Proposals withdrawn
 in this manner may be modified and resubmitted, but the
 modifications must be legible and must satisfy all other criteria
 for changes listed in this Section. Failure to resubmit a modified
 proposal before the time set for bid opening will result in no bid
 on behalf of the company that has withdrawn its bid.
 21
 
 102
 (2) Facsimiles.
 a. The Department will not be responsible for any failure
 attributable to the transmission or receipt of a facsimile.
 b. Facsimile requests to withdraw bid proposals shall be
 on the bidder's letterhead and must clearly and legibly state
 the job number, job name, and letting date of the proposal
 being withdrawn. Requests shall be signed by the bidder
 and addressed to the Division Head, Programs and
 Contracts Division. The request should be transmitted to
 the Department at (501)569-2623.
 c. Facsimile requests to modify a bid must be legible
 copies of Schedule of Items pages, identical to those
 originally submitted as part of the bid proposal. The
 subtotal and total page(s) shall be submitted even if the
 modifications made do not change the total and subtotal.
 Original entries must be lined through and only legible
 revisions initialed by the person who signed the original
 proposal will be considered. This person must also sign
 and date the page containing the revised bid total.
 Facsimile requests to modify bid proposals may not
 be transmitted directly to the Department or any of its
 agents. The office or person receiving the facsimiles (e.g.,
 the bidder's bonding agent, a local delivery service, etc.)
 shall seal them in an envelope clearly marked "BID
 MODIFICATION" and on which the job number, job
 name, bidder's name, letting date, and the typed or printed
 name of the person delivering it have been recorded. This
 person must also sign and date the envelope. The sealed
 envelope must then be delivered to the Division Head,
 Programs & Contracts Division, according to the
 requirements of this Section. Facsimiles will become part
 of the bid proposal document. If for any reason a facsimile
 modifying a bid is not delivered to the Department before
 the time set for bid opening, the original bid will be opened,
 read, and considered in the award of the project.
 The original, signed modified pages shall immediately
 be sent to the Department by the bidder. The award of
 Contract containing a facsimile modification shall be
 22
 
 102
 subject to receipt of the original, signed modified pages by
 the Department within ten calendar days of the bid opening
 date.
 Failure to provide the original pages to the
 Department within ten calendar days shall be taken as a
 failure to execute the Contract and handled according to
 subsection 103.07(a).
 102.12 Public Opening of Proposals. Proposals will be opened
 and read publicly at the time and place indicated in the Notice to
 Contractors. Bidders, their authorized agents, and other interested
 parties are invited to be present.
 102.13 Disqualification of Bidders. Only one proposal from an
 individual, firm, partnership, or corporation, whether under the same
 or under different names, will be considered. Should it appear to the
 Commission that any bidder is interested, as principal, in more than
 one proposal for any one project, all such proposals in which the
 bidder is interested will be rejected.
 A bidder may, however, submit a proposal as principal and also
 quote as a subcontractor to other principals on the same project
 provided the quotation as a subcontractor does not exceed 70% of
 the total bid, and by so doing will not thereby be liable for
 disqualification. Furthermore, it is not the intent of this specification
 to disqualify any proposal because of quotations made by any one
 subcontractor to more than one principal. Should there be
 reasonable grounds for believing that collusion or a combination
 exists, all proposals may be rejected and bidders or participants in
 such combination or collusion will not be considered in future
 proposals for the same work.
 102.14 Material Guaranty. The successful bidder may be
 required to furnish a complete statement of the origin, composition,
 and manufacture of any or all materials to be used in the
 construction of the work together with samples which may be
 subjected to the tests provided for in these specifications to
 determine their quality and fitness for the work.
 102.15 Project Withdrawal.
 The Arkansas Highway
 Commission reserves the right to withdraw a project previously
 scheduled for letting. In the event of such withdrawal, potential
 bidders will be notified by the Department, time permitting. In any
 case, an announcement will be made before opening bids for such
 23
 
 102
 withdrawn project and the unopened bids will be returned to the
 bidders.
 
 SECTION 103
 AWARD AND EXECUTION OF CONTRACT
 103.01 Consideration of Proposals. After the proposals are
 opened and read, they will be compared on the basis of the bid total,
 which is the summation of the products obtained by multiplying the
 approximate quantities shown in the Proposal by the unit bid prices.
 Errors found in the bidder's extensions will be corrected before
 release of the final summation. The results of such comparisons will
 be immediately available to the public.
 The right is reserved to reject any or all proposals, to waive
 technicalities, or to advertise for new proposals, if in the judgement
 of the Commission the best interest of the Department will be
 promoted thereby.
 103.02 Award of Contract. Award of the Contract, if awarded,
 will be made within 40 calendar days after the opening of the
 proposals or, in the case of contracts having conditional award
 status, after any conditional award status is lifted, to the lowest
 responsive and qualified bidder whose proposal complies with all
 the requirements prescribed. The successful bidder will be notified
 by letter of the bid acceptance and of the award of the Contract.
 In instances where licensing with the Contractors Licensing
 Board is not a prerequisite to bidding, an unlicensed successful
 bidder will be allowed a maximum of 30 calendar days after the
 written notice of award in which to file for a license. In the event
 the bidder does not become licensed within 90 calendar days after
 the written notice of award, the bid may be rejected and the proposal
 guaranty forfeited.
 "Conditional award status", as used herein, means the situation
 during which, subsequent to bid opening and before execution of
 Contract, a bidder has been formally advised to comply with one or
 more bidding requirements, or the Department is obtaining
 concurrences.
 103.03 Cancellation of Award. The Commission reserves the
 right to cancel the award of any contract at any time before the
 24
 
 103
 execution of said contract by all parties without any liability against
 the Commission.
 103.04 Return of Proposal Guaranty. All proposal guaranties
 in the form of checks, except those of the two lowest bidders, will be
 returned immediately following the opening and verification of the
 proposals. The retained proposal guaranties of the two lowest
 bidders will be returned after the Contract has been executed.
 All bid bonds will be retained in the files of the Department.
 103.05 Requirement of Performance Bonds, Payment Bonds,
 and Liability Insurance. (a) Bonds. At the time of execution of
 the Contract, the successful bidder shall furnish a surety
 Performance bond or bonds in a sum equal to the full amount of the
 Contract and a surety Payment bond or bonds in a sum equal to 80%
 of the full amount of the Contract. The form of the bonds as well as
 the surety shall be acceptable to the Department. The Statutory
 Payment and the Statutory Performance Bonds furnished with the
 Contract shall be executed by a Resident Agent or Nonresident
 Agent. The Resident or Nonresident Agent shall be licensed by the
 Insurance Commissioner of the State of Arkansas to represent the
 surety company executing the bond. A Power of Attorney
 supporting the Resident or Nonresident Agent's signature shall be
 furnished with each bond. The bond number used by the Surety must
 also be recorded in the space provided on each bond.
 The Resident or Nonresident Agent will be responsible for
 advising the Department, by Certified Mail -- Return Receipt
 Requested, of any indication that the Surety is experiencing
 difficulty that may affect its ability to perform. Failure of the
 Resident or Nonresident Agent to do so may be just cause to reject
 any or all future bonds from that individual/agency.
 Suits concerning the payment or performance bond shall be filed
 in the State of Arkansas; and the Department and the Commission
 shall be entitled to the sovereign immunity from suit afforded by the
 Constitution of Arkansas and laws of the State of Arkansas.
 The Department reserves the right to refuse bonds from sureties
 with a record of unsatisfactory performance under previously
 accepted bonds.
 
 25
 
 103
 (b) Liability Insurance. The Contractor shall procure and
 maintain at its own sole cost and expense, until acceptance of the
 project by the Engineer, General Public Liability Insurance
 providing bodily injury, including death, personal injury, and
 property damage coverage with a limit of at least $1,000,000 per
 occurrence and a general aggregate limit of at least $2,000,000.
 Each such policy shall be endorsed to include broad form general
 liability, contractual liability, and completed operations coverage.
 Before a work order is issued, the Contractor shall furnish to the
 Division Head, Programs & Contracts Division, evidence of the
 required insurance. Each policy or its declaration pages shall
 provide that the policy shall not be materially changed or cancelled
 until the Engineer has been given at least 30 calendar days advance
 notice in writing. If any policy is cancelled during the duration of
 the work, a satisfactory replacement policy must be in force, with
 notice and evidence of insurance to the Engineer, prior to the
 effective date of cancellation of the former policy.
 Failure to furnish the required proof of Liability Insurance with
 the submission of the Contract signed by the successful bidder shall
 be just cause for the cancellation of the award and forfeiture of the
 proposal guaranty, which shall become the property of the
 Commission, not as a penalty, but in liquidation of damages
 sustained. Failure to furnish notice of cancellation or change in the
 policy will result in the temporary suspension of work as provided in
 Section 108.05. Temporary suspension shall remain in effect until
 proof that the required insurance is in effect is received by the
 Department. If no proof of insurance is received within 20 calendar
 days of the Suspension Order, the Engineer may proceed with
 written notice of default according to Section 108.08.
 103.06 Execution and Approval of Contract. (a) General. The
 Contract shall be signed by the successful bidder and returned to the
 Division Head, Programs & Contracts Division, together with the
 required bonds and proof of liability insurance, within 10 business
 days after written notice of award has been issued. Execution of the
 Contract by the Department will take place as soon as practical after
 it has been signed and returned by the successful bidder.
 (b) Furnishing Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE)
 Information. For contracts having DBE goals, and where required
 26
 
 103
 DBE information is not submitted with the bidder's proposal, the
 successful bidder shall furnish the required DBE information as
 specified in Subsection 103.08. If the information is furnished and
 the conditional award status is lifted, the Contract will be handled as
 stated in (a) above.
 103.07 Failure to Execute Contract. (a) General. Failure to
 execute the Contract and file acceptable bonds and proof of liability
 insurance within 10 business days after the written notice of award
 has been issued to the bidder shall be just cause for the cancellation
 of the award and forfeiture of the proposal guaranty, which shall
 become the property of the Commission, not as a penalty, but in
 liquidation of damages sustained. Award may then be made to the
 next lowest responsible bidder, or the work may be re-advertised and
 constructed under contract or otherwise, as the Commission may
 decide. The low bidder who fails to execute the Contract and submit
 acceptable bonds and proof of liability insurance will not be
 permitted to bid on any subsequent advertisement of that project.
 (b) Failure to Furnish DBE Information. For contracts having
 DBE goals, failure to furnish the DBE information required under
 subsection 103.08 shall be just cause for the cancellation of the
 conditional award and forfeiture of the proposal guaranty. The
 proposal guaranty shall become property of the Commission, not as
 a penalty, but in liquidation of damages sustained to the DBE
 Program. Conditional award, re-advertisement, etc., will be handled
 as in (a) above.
 103.08 Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) in Highway
 Construction. (a) Contract Requirements. The provisions of this
 subsection shall apply to all contracts administered by the
 Department.
 If there are no specific participation goals for a
 contract, the Contractor agrees to ensure that Disadvantaged
 Business Enterprises (DBEs) are provided reasonable opportunities
 to compete for and perform on the contract or subcontracts and shall
 take all necessary and reasonable steps to ensure that the policy set
 forth in this supplemental specification is maintained. If a
 Contractor on a project without a specific participation goal elects to
 utilize a DBE subcontractor, all payments to the DBE subcontractor
 must be documented in accordance with Subsection 103.08(h). If
 the Prime Contractor is a DBE, records must be submitted in
 27
 
 103
 accordance with the above referenced section for work accomplished
 by their own forces.
 (b) Policy.
 It is the policy of the Department to ensure
 nondiscrimination in the award and administration of Department
 contracts and to create a level playing field on which Disadvantaged
 Business Enterprises (DBEs) can compete fairly. Consequently, the
 following apply to the Contract, the DBEs listed in the Contractor's
 submittal required by Subsection 103.06(b) to achieve a DBE goal
 (either on a subcontract, purchase order, or other written agreement),
 the DBEs that may be added to the list later as substitutes, and DBEs
 performing on a contract, but not used to fulfill a portion of a DBE
 goal:
 (1) The Contractor agrees to ensure that DBEs are provided
 reasonable opportunities to compete for and to perform on
 contracts awarded by the Department. In this regard, the
 Contractor shall take all necessary and reasonable steps to meet
 the DBE goal established in the Contract.
 (2) The Contractor and any subcontractors shall not
 discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, or sex in
 the performance of the Contract. The Contractor shall carry out
 applicable requirements of 49 CFR § 26 in the award,
 administration and performance of contracts. Failure by the
 Contractor to carry out these requirements is a material breach of
 this contract, which may result in the termination of this contract
 or such other remedy as the Department deems appropriate.
 (3) After a conditional award is made and the apparent
 successful bidder has submitted the required DBE information,
 the Department will determine if the DBE requirements have
 been met. If those requirements are met, the conditional status
 will be removed and the Contract will be forwarded to the bidder
 for execution. If those requirements are not met, the proposal
 guaranty will become the property of the Commission, as
 specified in subsection 103.08(d).
 (4) The Contractor should ensure that all DBEs performing on
 the Contract serve a commercially useful function. To ascertain
 that all obligations under contracts awarded to DBEs are met, the
 Department will review the Contractor's DBE involvement efforts
 during the performance of the Contract. No work shall be
 28
 
 103
 performed by the Contractor or any subcontractor on items
 originally committed to or included in a subcontract (including
 purchase orders or other written agreements) with a DBE without
 prior written approval by the Department. Payments to the
 Contractor will be withheld or previous payments recovered by
 the Department in amounts equivalent to that portion of the
 subcontract with a DBE in which:
 a. The DBE subcontractor is found not performing a
 commercially
 useful
 function
 as
 defined
 in
 subsection 103.08(f)(3); or
 b. The Contractor or any subcontractor performs any
 portion of the work to be accomplished by a DBE without
 prior written approval by the Department.
 Amounts that have been withheld as a result of a or b above will
 be retained by the Department until the Contract DBE goal is
 satisfied or will be withheld permanently if the Contract DBE
 goal is not met.
 (5) The Contractor shall pay all subcontractors their respective
 subcontract amounts, including retainage, according to
 subsection 108.01. The Contractor shall inform the Department
 of any situation in which regularly scheduled progress payments
 are not made to DBE subcontractors.
 Failure of the Contractor or any subcontractor to carry out the
 requirements set forth above shall constitute a breach of contract
 and, after notification by the Department, may result in withholding
 estimates due the Contractor, termination of the Contract by the
 Department, or other action as the Department deems appropriate.
 (c) Definitions.
 (1) "Disadvantaged Business Enterprise" means a for profit
 small business concern:
 a. which is at least 51 percent owned by one or more
 individuals who are both socially and economically
 disadvantaged, or, in the case of a corporation, at least
 51 percent of the stock is owned by one or more such
 individuals; and
 b. whose management and daily business operations are
 controlled by one or more of the socially and economically
 disadvantaged individuals who own it.
 29
 
 103
 (2) "Small Business Concern" means, with respect to firms
 seeking to participate as DBEs, a small business as defined
 pursuant to Section 3 of the Small Business Act and Small
 Business Administration (SBA) regulations implementing it (13
 CFR § 121), that also does not exceed the cap on average annual
 gross receipts allowed by Federal Regulation.
 (3) "Socially and economically disadvantaged individual"
 means any individual who is a citizen of the United States (or
 lawfully admitted permanent resident) and who is found to be a
 socially and economically disadvantaged individual on a case-bycase basis; or any individual in the following groups, members of
 which are rebuttably presumed to be socially and economically
 disadvantaged: Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native
 Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, Subcontinent Asian
 Americans, Women and any additional groups whose members
 are designated as socially and economically disadvantaged by the
 SBA, at such time as the SBA designation becomes effective.
 a. "Black Americans" includes persons having origins in
 any of the Black racial groups of Africa;
 b. "Hispanic Americans" includes persons of Mexican,
 Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central or South American,
 or other Spanish or Portuguese culture or origin, regardless of

 e. "Subcontinent Asian Americans" includes persons whose
 origins are from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the
 Maldives Islands, Nepal or Sri Lanka; and
 f. "Women".
 30
 
 103
 (d) Bidder's Responsibilities.
 (1) On projects with a DBE goal, each bidder shall furnish,
 with the proposal, one of the following:
 a. The required DBE participation,
 b. Documentation of good faith efforts, or
 c. An irrevocable certification that the required DBE
 participation will be submitted within ten (10)
 business days following conditional award of the
 project.
 If none of the items listed in (d) (1) a, b, or c is submitted, the
 Department will reject the bid and the proposal guaranty will be
 handled in accordance with Subsection 103.04.
 (2) If an irrevocable certification to achieve the required DBE
 participation is submitted with the proposal, within ten (10)
 business days after conditional award of the Contract, the
 apparent successful bidder shall furnish the required information
 to the Department on a form provided by the Department. If the
 information is not furnished as required, the conditional award
 will be cancelled in accordance with Subsection 103.07(b).
 (3) Information required to be submitted to document DBE
 participation is:
 a. The names and addresses of the AHTD-certified DBE
 subcontractors to be used to satisfy the percentage
 goal;
 b. An itemized description of the work each DBE
 subcontractor is to perform;
 c. The dollar value of each item to be included in the
 DBE subcontract;
 d. Written documentation of the bidder’s commitment
 to use a DBE subcontractor whose participation it
 submits to meet a contract goal; and
 e. Written confirmation from the DBE that it is
 participating in the contract as provided in the
 Contractor’s commitment.
 (4) An apparent successful bidder who cannot meet the
 percentage goals shall document and submit with the proposal the
 31
 
 103
 steps taken to obtain the required DBE participation. Only those
 efforts made by the bidder to obtain DBE participation prior to
 the letting will be considered in the evaluation of good faith
 efforts. Good faith efforts to meet DBE goals would include such
 items as, but not limited to, the following:
 a. Soliciting through all reasonable and available means
 (e.g., attendance at a pre-bid meeting, if any, advertising
 and/or written notices) the interest of all certified DBEs who
 have the capability to perform the work of the contract. The
 bidder must solicit this interest at least two weeks prior to the
 letting to allow the DBEs to respond to the solicitation. The
 bidder must determine with certainty if the DBEs are
 interested by taking appropriate steps to follow up initial
 solicitations;
 b. Selecting portions of the work to be performed by DBEs
 to increase the likelihood of meeting DBE goals (including,
 where appropriate, breaking out contract work items into
 economically feasible units to facilitate DBE participation,
 even when the prime contractor might otherwise prefer to
 perform these work items with its own forces). Selections
 should be made based on the current DBE directory of
 contractors and their specialty area/areas of work.
 c. Providing interested DBEs with adequate information
 about plans, specifications, and requirements of the Contract
 in a timely manner to assist them in responding to a
 solicitation;
 d. Negotiations.
 (1) Negotiating in good faith with interested DBEs. It
 is the bidder’s responsibility to make a portion of the
 work available to DBE subcontractors and suppliers and
 to select those portions of the work or material needs
 consistent with the available DBE subcontractors and
 suppliers, so as to facilitate DBE participation. Evidence
 of such negotiation includes the names, addresses, and
 telephone numbers of DBEs that were contacted; a
 description of the information provided regarding the
 plans and specifications for the work selected for
 subcontracting; and evidence as to why additional
 agreements could not be reached for DBEs to perform the
 work;
 32
 
 103
 (2) A bidder using good business judgment would
 consider a number of factors in negotiating with
 subcontractors, including DBE subcontractors, and would
 take a firm’s price and capabilities as well as contract
 goals into consideration. However, the fact that there may
 be some additional costs involved in finding and using
 DBEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a bidder’s
 failure to meet the contract DBE goal, as long as such
 costs are reasonable. Also, the ability or desire of a prime
 contractor to perform the work of a contract with its own
 organization does not relieve the bidder of the
 responsibility to make good faith efforts. Contractors are
 not, however, required to accept higher quotes from DBEs
 if the price difference is excessive or unreasonable;
 e. Not rejecting DBEs as being unqualified without sound
 reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities.
 The Contractor’s standing within its industry, membership in
 specific groups, organizations, or associations and political or
 social affiliations (for example union vs. non-union employee
 status) are not legitimate causes for the rejection or nonsolicitation of bids in the Contractor’s efforts to meet the
 project goal;
 f. Making efforts to assist interested DBEs in obtaining
 bonding, lines of credit, or insurance as required by the
 Department or Contractor;
 g. Making efforts to assist interested DBEs in obtaining
 necessary equipment, supplies, materials, or related assistance
 or services;
 h. Effectively using
 the services
 of available
 minority/women community organizations; minority/women
 contractors’ groups; local, state, and federal minority/women
 business assistance offices; and other organizations as allowed
 on a case-by-case basis to provide assistance in the recruitment
 and placement of DBEs.
 (5) The preceding information shall be submitted directly to
 the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department,
 Programs and Contracts Division, P. O. Box 2261, Little Rock,
 Arkansas 72203.
 33
 
 103
 a. The information submitted by the apparent low bidder
 will be reviewed by the Department to determine if the
 Contractor has successfully met the DBE goal or made a good
 faith effort to obtain DBE participation sufficient to achieve
 the DBE goal.
 b. If it is determined that the goal was not met or a good
 faith effort was not made, the bidder will be notified and
 provided an opportunity for administrative reconsideration.
 As part of the reconsideration, the bidder may provide written
 documentation or argument concerning the issue of whether it
 met the goal or made adequate good faith efforts to do so. A
 request for administrative reconsideration must be submitted
 to the Chief Engineer within two business days of the
 Department’s notification. The Chief Engineer will render a
 written decision on the reconsideration explaining the basis for
 the finding.
 (6) Should the bidder to whom the Contract is conditionally
 awarded refuse, neglect, or fail to meet the DBE goals or to
 furnish acceptable documentation of efforts to meet these goals,
 the bidder will not be provided a contract for execution. If the
 goal is not met and the good faith efforts are found to be
 inadequate, the proposal will be rejected and the proposal
 guaranty filed with the bid will be returned to the contractor.
 However, if documentation of good faith effort was not submitted
 with the bid and DBE participation sufficient to achieve the goal
 is not provided within ten days, as required, the proposal will be
 rejected and the proposal guaranty shall become the property of
 the Commission, not as a penalty, but as liquidation of damages
 to the Department's DBE program.
 (7) Should the Department accept a good faith effort, this
 determination will be made on the condition that the Contractor
 continue efforts throughout the life of the project to attain the
 DBE participation goal and to document such continued good
 faith efforts.
 (8) A Contractor may not terminate a DBE firm’s subcontract
 or purchase order without the written approval of the Department.
 The Contractor shall make good faith efforts to replace a DBE
 subcontractor with another DBE subcontractor if the original
 DBE subcontractor is unable or unwilling to perform
 34
 
 103
 successfully. All substitutions of DBE subcontractors during
 Contract performance must be approved by the Department in
 writing, not only because it is routinely required, but also to
 ensure that DBE firms are provided reasonable opportunities to
 perform on contracts and substitute firms are eligible DBEs. A
 substitute DBE or the Contractor will not be allowed to
 commence work on those items committed or subcontracted to a
 DBE until satisfactory evidence of the original DBE's inability or
 unwillingness to perform is submitted to and approved by the
 Department in writing. For projects with a DBE goal, evidence
 of good faith efforts exerted by the Contractor must be submitted
 to and approved by the Department. Good faith efforts to replace
 a DBE subcontractor shall be directed at finding another DBE to
 perform at least the same amount of work (not necessarily the
 same work) under the contract as the DBE that was terminated, to
 the extent needed to meet the contract goal established for the
 project. (See also subsection 103.08(b)(4).)
 (9) Requirements of this Subsection shall also apply to DBE
 firms bidding as the Prime Contractor on a project. In
 determining whether a DBE bidder has met a contract goal, the
 work that the DBE performs with its own forces, as well as the
 work performed by DBE subcontractors and suppliers will count
 toward the goal. DBE bidders must list on the DBE Participation
 Form all work to be performed with its own forces and work to
 be performed by DBE subcontractors, DBE suppliers, DBE
 manufacturers, and/or DBE non-construction services that will be
 utilized in achieving the goal.
 (10) Agreements between a bidder and a DBE in which the
 DBE promises not to provide subcontracting quotations to other
 bidders are prohibited.
 (11) The successful bidder shall designate a liaison officer
 who will administer the Contractor's DBE program and maintain
 in the home office the records and results of the contacts made
 with DBE subcontractors.
 (12) Contractors are encouraged to investigate the full extent
 of services offered by banks owned and controlled by
 disadvantaged individuals.
 
 35
 
 103
 (e) Eligibility of DBEs.
 (1) To ensure that the Department's DBE program benefits
 only those firms for whom it is intended, the Department will
 certify or ascertain the eligibility of DBEs, and joint ventures, any
 of which are proposed to be used by contractors to perform
 subcontract work.
 (2) Certification by the Department will be accomplished
 through the use of Schedules A, B, and C. Certification will be
 granted for specific types of work for which the socially and
 economically disadvantaged owners have the ability to control the
 firm.
 (3) Eligibility of firms certified by the Small Business
 Administration under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act or
 small and disadvantaged business (SDB) programs will be
 considered on a case-by-case basis by the Department.
 (4) Contractors are encouraged to solicit DBE subcontractors
 wherever they may be located and, if the DBE is not certified by
 the Department, to encourage the DBE to submit certification
 forms for approval.
 (5) Early submission of certification forms is encouraged,
 particularly for those complex situations in which a determination
 of eligibility may require extensive documentation and review.
 (6) A Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Directory is
 published, maintained, and available from the Department. Firms
 listed in the Directory are certified at the date the Directory is
 printed. Additions or deletions to the Directory after that date
 due to certifications, decertifications, etc. are possible. The
 current status of firms can be ascertained by contacting the
 Department’s DBE Program Specialist.
 (f) Determination of DBE Participation. DBE participation shall
 be counted toward meeting the DBE goal according to the following:
 (1) When a DBE participates in a contract, only the value of
 the work actually performed by the DBE for which it is certified
 is counted toward a DBE goal.
 a. The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is
 performed by the DBE’s own forces for which it is certified is
 36
 
 103
 counted toward a goal. The cost of supplies and materials
 obtained by the DBE for the work of that portion of the
 contract, including supplies purchased or equipment leased by
 the DBE (except supplies and equipment the DBE
 subcontractor purchases or leases from the Contractor or its
 affiliates), is included. DBEs bidding as prime contractors
 must indicate all work the firm will be performing with its
 own forces on the DBE Participation form.
 b. When a DBE subcontracts part of the work of its
 contract to another firm, the value of the subcontracted work
 may be counted toward DBE goals only if the DBE’s
 subcontractor is a DBE and is certified for the types of work.
 Work that a DBE subcontracts to a non-DBE firm does not
 count toward DBE goals.
 c. No credit will be given toward the DBE goal for any
 subcontracting arrangement that is contrived to artificially
 inflate or obtain the appearance of DBE participation. Of
 particular concern is the interjection of DBE middlemen or
 passive conduits that are inconsistent with standard industry
 practices or which serve no commercially useful function, and
 arrangements in which a DBE subcontractor is acting
 essentially as a broker, (e.g., DBE second-tier subcontracts
 between DBE subcontractors who are fulfilling project goals,
 and non-DBE subcontractors with contracts acknowledged by
 the Department on the same project). Regardless of whether
 an arrangement between the Contractor and a DBE represents
 standard industry practice, where such an arrangement erodes
 the ownership, control, or independence of the DBE or does
 not meet the commercially useful function requirement, the
 Contractor shall receive no credit toward the DBE goal.
 d. The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a
 DBE firm for providing a bona fide service, such as
 professional, technical, consultant, or managerial services, or
 for providing bonds or insurance specifically required for the
 performance of a contract, may be counted toward DBE goals,
 provided the fee is determined to be reasonable and not
 excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for
 similar services.
 
 37
 
 103
 (2) When a DBE performs as a participant in a joint venture,
 the portion of the total dollar value of the contract equal to the
 clearly defined portion of the work that the DBE performs with
 its own forces may be counted toward the goal.
 (3) The Contractor may count toward the DBE goal only
 expenditures to DBEs that perform a commercially useful
 function in the work of a contract. A DBE is considered to
 perform a commercially useful function when it is responsible for
 execution of a distinct element of the work of a contract and
 carrying out its responsibilities by actually performing, managing,
 and supervising the work involved. To determine whether a DBE
 is performing a commercially useful function, the Department
 shall evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry
 practices, whether the amount the firm is to be paid under the
 contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing
 and the DBE credit claimed for its performance of the work, and
 other relevant factors.
 A commercially useful function is performed when:
 a. All employees are under direct supervision of the DBE
 and on the DBE's payroll. Use by a DBE of personnel from
 the Contractor or any subcontractor will not be permitted
 without prior approval by the Department.
 b. The DBE is responsible for obtaining all equipment
 necessary to perform Contract work. The DBE shall negotiate
 and enter into equipment lease or purchase order agreements
 directly with the equipment source. Such lease or purchase
 order agreements shall have prior approval by the Department.
 c. The DBE is responsible, with respect to materials and
 supplies, for negotiating price, determining quality and
 quantity, ordering the material, and installing (where
 applicable) and paying for the material itself.
 If the Contractor chooses to assist a DBE firm by assuring
 payment for materials to be placed in the DBE’s work or
 equipment leased by the DBE and wants to receive credit
 toward the DBE goal for the cost, the following procedures
 may be used:
 
 38
 
 103
 the material supplier or lessor may invoice the
 DBE firm and be paid by remittance from the DBE firm
 or
 •
 the supplier or lessor may invoice the Contractor
 and DBE firm jointly and be paid by the Contractor and
 DBE firm utilizing a joint check from the Contractor.
 Such a joint checking arrangement must be in writing,
 either in the subcontract or a separate agreement, and
 approved by the Department prior to the supplies or
 equipment being utilized and payment being made.
 No credit will be given toward the DBE goal for the cost of the
 DBE's required materials or equipment that the Contractor
 pays directly to the material supplier or lessor.
 •
 
 d. A DBE subcontractor will be deemed to have performed
 a commercially useful function and the Contractor will be
 allowed DBE goal credit when a DBE subcontractor performs
 at least 30 percent of its subcontract. This work shall be
 performed by the DBE subcontractor's normal work force.
 (4) The following factors will be used in determining whether
 a DBE trucking firm or owner/operator is performing a
 commercially useful function:
 a. The DBE must be responsible for the management and
 supervision of the entire trucking operation for the items on its
 subcontract or purchase order, including scheduling, providing
 sufficient trucks to accomplish the haul, and coordinating the
 work with the Contractor. There cannot be a contrived
 arrangement for the purpose of meeting DBE goals.
 b. The DBE must own and operate at least one fully
 licensed, insured, and operational truck used on the contract
 when work is in progress.
 c. The DBE receives credit for the total value of the
 transportation services it provides on the contract using trucks
 it owns, insures, and operates using drivers it employs. The
 DBE will also receive credit for the total dollar value of the
 transportation services attributable to no more than twice the
 number of trucks owned by the DBE and leased from another
 DBE firm. Long-term lease arrangements are an acceptable
 form of “ownership.”
 39
 
 103
 d. Lease Agreements. There are two types of lease
 arrangements that can be utilized by DBE firms: long-term
 leases and short-term leases.
 (1) Long-term lease arrangements. The DBE may lease
 trucks under a long-term lease arrangement from
 independent equipment leasing companies. To be an
 independent equipment leasing company, the company
 must lease equipment to the public. A long term lease
 is defined as a twelve month or longer lease period.
 The drivers, fuel, minor maintenance responsibility,
 and full control of the leased trucks must rest solely
 with the DBE owner as stipulated in the lease
 agreement. Drivers must be employees of the DBE,
 subject to withholding, worker’s compensation
 requirements, unemployment, etc. Leased trucks must
 display the name and identification number of the
 DBE. The DBE will receive full credit for the full
 value of the transportation services provided by trucks
 leased and operated in this manner. A DBE supplier
 (regular dealer) must utilize this type of lease to
 supplement distribution equipment owned by the firm
 to receive credit for transportation services.
 (2) Short-term lease arrangements.
 a). The DBE may lease trucks from another DBE firm,
 including an owner-operator who is certified as a
 DBE. The DBE who leases trucks from another
 DBE receives credit for the total value of the
 transportation services the lessee DBE provides on
 the contract.
 b). The DBE may also lease trucks from a non-DBE
 firm, or owner-operator. Credit for the total value
 of the non-DBE firm or owner-operator trucks
 transportation services will be credited to the DBE
 so long as the number of non-DBE firm or owneroperator trucks does not exceed the number of
 trucks owned by the DBE or leased from other DBE
 firms. For trucks leased by the DBE in excess of
 the total number of owned or leased DBE trucks,
 the DBE is entitled to receive credit only for the fee
 40
 
 103
 or commission it receives as a result of the lease
 arrangements for the excess trucks.
 All lease agreements must indicate that the DBE has
 exclusive use of and control over the truck. This does not
 preclude the leased truck from working for others during the
 term of the lease with the consent of the DBE, so long as the
 lease gives the DBE absolute priority for use of the leased
 truck. A copy of each lease agreement must be provided to
 and approved by the Resident Engineer before the truck begins
 hauling. The agreement must reflect the name of the lessor,
 cab card registration numbers of all leased trucks, the
 description of the truck(s), the amount and terms of the lease
 and method of payment (hour, ton, cubic yard, or number of
 loads hauled), and, if owner-operator, his/her Social Security
 Number.
 e. The DBE must certify each estimate period the amounts
 paid to: (1) other DBE truckers, (2) non-DBE truckers, and (3)
 for hauls made with trucks owned by the firm. This
 certification must be made on the form provided by the
 Department.
 (5) When a DBE is found not to be performing a commercially
 useful function, the DBE may present evidence to rebut the
 finding. Such evidence will be reviewed by the Department and a
 determination made. Decisions on commercially useful function
 matters are subject to review by the Federal Highway
 Administration for projects receiving federal funds.
 (6) The Contractor may count toward the DBE goal 60 percent
 of expenditures for materials and supplies required under a
 Contract and obtained from a DBE regular dealer, and
 100 percent of such expenditures to a DBE manufacturer.
 a. For purposes of this Section, a manufacturer is a firm
 that operates or maintains a factory or establishment that
 produces on the premises the materials, supplies, articles or
 equipment required under the contract for incorporation into
 the work, and of the general character described by the
 specifications.
 b. For purposes of this Section, a supplier or regular dealer
 is a firm that owns, operates, or maintains a store, warehouse,
 41
 
 103
 or other establishment in which the materials, supplies, articles
 or equipment of the general character described by the
 specifications and required under the contract for
 incorporation into the work are bought, kept in stock, and
 regularly sold or leased to the public in the usual course of
 business. To be a supplier, the firm must be an established,
 regular business that engages in, as its principal business and
 under its own name, the purchase and sale or lease of the
 products in question. A trucking firm or owner/operator will
 not be considered a supplier, nor will a supplier be considered
 a trucking firm.
 A regular dealer in such bulk items as steel, cement, gravel,
 or stone, must own or lease, and operate, a pit, quarry,
 concrete plant, or other such facility that sells materials to the
 public. A person may be a regular dealer in petroleum
 products or asphalt binder without owning, operating, or
 maintaining a place of business, where these items are bought,
 kept in stock, and regularly sold to the public, if the person
 both owns and operates distribution equipment for the
 products.
 Any supplementing of regular dealers’ own
 distribution equipment shall be by a long-term lease agreement
 and not on an ad hoc or contract-by-contract basis.
 c. Expenditures for lease of a particular piece or pieces of
 equipment from DBEs for exclusive use on the project for
 which DBE participation is to be claimed may be counted 60
 percent toward contract goals, provided the DBE dealer
 actually has ownership or control of the equipment and is
 considered a regular dealer.
 d. Capital expenditures for tools, equipment, vehicles, field
 office furniture, and similar property items, even though such
 items are used on the project and purchased from DBEs, are
 not creditable toward contract DBE goals.
 e. Expenditures for materials and supplies obtained from
 DBE suppliers and manufacturers for use in the Contractor’s
 general operations which are not incorporated into the work
 are not creditable in whole or part toward contract goals, even
 though a portion of such items may be used in the
 administration and/or execution of a project.
 42
 
 103
 (7) Brokers, manufacturer’s representatives, packagers, or
 other persons who arrange or expedite transactions are not regular
 dealers within the meaning of this section.
 With respect to materials or supplies purchased from a DBE
 which is neither a manufacturer nor regular dealer, the entire
 amount of fees or commissions charged for assistance in the
 procurement of the materials and supplies, or fees or
 transportation charges for the delivery of materials or supplies
 required on a job site, can be counted toward DBE goals,
 provided the fees are determined to be reasonable and not
 excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar
 services. None of the cost of the materials and supplies
 themselves will count toward DBE goals.
 (8) In order for a firm to qualify as a DBE supplier of metal
 and/or concrete pipe, the firm must fabricate the pipe.
 (9) If material is purchased from a DBE supplier, credit will be
 allowed at 60% of the total cost of the material obtained from the
 DBE facility and the cost of delivery if the supplier is
 transporting the material using equipment it owns or leases on a
 long-term basis. Credit for 100% of transportation services
 provided by the DBE truckers will be allowed.
 (10) A valid purchase order for the material must be executed
 by the contractor and DBE and approved by the Department prior
 to the material being hauled from the facility.
 (11) The Contractor may count toward the DBE goal only
 those payments made to DBEs for work or services performed or
 material furnished after the DBE has been approved, either on the
 list in the Contractor's original participation submittal or later as a
 substitute.
 The Department must have acknowledged a
 subcontract or purchase order prior to the beginning of work by
 the DBE firm. Payments made to a DBE for work, services, or
 materials performed or furnished prior to approval and
 acknowledgment will not be counted toward the DBE goal.
 (g) Subcontract Eligibility.
 On Federal-Aid projects, the
 provisions of Arkansas Act 936 of 1989, concerning the listing of
 unlicensed subcontractors, do not apply. However, the proposed
 DBE subcontractor shall meet all requirements of applicable
 43
 
 103
 Arkansas law (including licensing) prior to subcontract approval by
 the Department.
 (h) Certificate of Payment to DBEs/Non-DBEs. Certification of
 payments to DBE subcontractors, suppliers, manufacturers, and/or
 non-construction services must be submitted by the Contractor each
 estimate period utilizing the forms provided by the Resident
 Engineer. A payment certification is also required when a non-DBE
 subcontractor subcontracts a portion of its work to a DBE firm or a
 DBE subcontractor subcontracts to another firm (DBE or non-DBE).
 In this case, the subcontractor shall complete the proper form and
 submit it through the Contractor. In lieu of using these forms,
 contractors may submit a copy of subcontractor pay estimates
 provided the required information and certification are included.
 This information will be submitted to the Resident Engineer for
 review and compilation. Only those payments reported will be
 credited toward the DBE goal. Failure to submit the reports within
 thirty calendar days after the end of the estimate period may result in
 contract sanctions, including withholding of progress payments.
 In addition, a final certificate of payment to DBEs shall be
 submitted to the Resident Engineer who will attach it to the original
 copy of the final estimate for payment. This requirement applies
 regardless of whether a DBE goal had been established for the
 project.
 (i) Cooperation. All participants in the Department’s DBE
 program, including, but not limited to, DBE firms and applicants for
 DBE certification, and Contractors using DBE firms to meet contract
 goals, are required to cooperate fully and promptly with U. S.
 Department of Transportation or Department compliance reviews,
 certification reviews, investigations, and other requests for
 information. Failure to do so shall be a ground for appropriate
 action against the party involved (e.g., with respect to DBE firms,
 denial of certification or removal of eligibility and/or suspension and
 debarment; with respect to a Contractor using DBE firms to meet
 goals, withholding of progress estimates, findings of nonresponsibility for future contracts and/or suspension and debarment).
 (j) Intimidation and retaliation. All participants in the DBE
 program, including but not limited to the Department and
 contractors, must not intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate
 44
 
 104
 against any individual or firm for the purpose of interfering with any
 right or privilege secured by 49 CFR § 26 or because the individual
 or firm has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in
 any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing.
 
 SECTION 104
 SCOPE OF WORK
 104.01 Intent of Contract. The intent of the Contract is to
 provide for the construction and completion in every detail of the
 work described. The Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials,
 equipment, tools, transportation, and supplies required to complete
 the work according to the plans, specifications, and terms of the
 Contract.
 104.02 Alteration of Plans or Character of Work. (a) General.
 The Commission shall have the right to increase or decrease the
 extent of the work or to change the location, gradient, or the
 dimensions of any part of the work, provided that the length of the
 improvement is not increased or decreased in excess of 25% of the
 contract length, or that the quantities of work to be done or the
 materials to be furnished are not increased or decreased in money
 value in excess of 25% of the total Contract. Such changes shall not
 be considered as a waiver of any conditions of the Contract nor
 invalidate any of the provisions thereof. The Contractor shall
 perform the work as increased or decreased within the qualifying
 limits named and no allowance will be made for anticipated profits
 on increases or decreases so incurred.
 (b) Significant Changes in the Character of Work. The
 Engineer reserves the right to make, in writing, at any time during
 the work, such changes in quantities and such alterations in the work
 as are necessary to satisfactorily complete the project. Such changes
 in quantities and alterations shall not invalidate the Contract nor
 release the Surety, and the Contractor agrees to perform the work as
 altered.
 If the alterations or changes in quantities significantly change the
 character of the work under the Contract, whether or not changed by
 any such different quantities or alterations, an adjustment, excluding
 loss of anticipated profits, will be agreed upon prior to the
 45
 
 104
 performance of the work. If a basis cannot be agreed upon, then an
 adjustment will be made either for or against the Contractor in such
 amount as the Engineer may determine to be fair and equitable.
 If the alterations or changes in quantities do not significantly
 change the character of the work to be performed under the Contract,
 the altered work will be paid for as provided elsewhere in the
 Contract.
 The term "significant change" shall be construed to apply only to
 the following circumstances:
 •
 
 When the character of the work as altered differs
 materially in kind or nature from that involved or
 included in the original proposed construction or
 
 •
 
 When a major item of work is increased in excess of 125
 percent or decreased below 75 percent of the original
 contract quantity. Any adjustment due to an increase in
 quantity shall apply only to that portion in excess of
 125 percent of original contract item quantity, or in case
 of a decrease below 75 percent, to the actual amount of
 work performed.
 
 A major item of work is defined as any bid item for which the
 original contract value is more than 10 percent of the total original
 contract value.
 (c) Differing Site Conditions. During the progress of the work,
 if subsurface or latent physical conditions are encountered at the site
 differing materially from those indicated in the Contract or if
 unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature, differing
 materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally
 recognized as inherent in the work provided for in the Contract, are
 encountered at the site, the party discovering such conditions shall
 promptly notify the other party in writing of the specific differing
 conditions before they are disturbed and before the affected work is
 performed.
 Upon written notification, the Engineer will investigate the
 conditions. If the Engineer determines that the conditions materially
 differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time required
 for the performance of any work under the Contract, an adjustment,
 excluding loss of anticipated profits, will be made and the Contract
 46
 
 104
 modified in writing accordingly. The Engineer will notify the
 Contractor of the determination whether or not an adjustment of the
 Contract is warranted.
 No Contract adjustment that results in a benefit to the Contractor
 will be allowed unless the Contractor has provided the required
 written notice.
 No Contract adjustment will be allowed under this clause for any
 effects caused on unchanged work.
 104.03 If and Where Directed Items. The plans and the
 proposal may specify one or more items to be incorporated into the
 project "if and where directed" by the Engineer. The Engineer shall
 have sole discretion in determining whether and to what extent such
 items will be incorporated into the project. The Engineer may order
 incorporation of such items at any location within the project and at
 any time during the work. These items may or may not be located
 on the plans. The estimated quantities set out in the proposal for
 such items are presented solely for the purpose of obtaining a
 representative bid price. The actual quantities employed may be
 only a fraction of, or many times the estimated quantities. The
 Contractor shall make no claim for additional compensation because
 of any increase, decrease, or elimination of such items.
 104.04 Extra Work. The Contractor, when directed, shall
 perform unforeseen work for which there is no quantity and price
 included in the Contract, or where increases or decreases in
 quantities are made in excess of the amounts set out in
 subsection 104.02, or whenever it is deemed necessary or desirable
 to further complete the work as contemplated. Such extra work shall
 be performed according to the specifications and as directed.
 However, before payment for any extra work is made, a
 Supplemental Agreement shall be signed by both contracting parties,
 or a written order procured from the Engineer directing the
 Contractor to do the work on a Force Account basis as provided in
 subsection 109.04.
 104.05 Maintaining Traffic. Unless otherwise provided, the
 road, while undergoing improvements, shall be kept open by the
 Contractor to all traffic. When so provided on the plans, the
 Contractor may bypass traffic over an approved detour route. The
 Contractor shall keep the portion of the project being used by public
 47
 
 104
 traffic, whether it is through or local traffic, in such condition that
 will permit the safe, continuous flow of two-way traffic at all times.
 When a part of the plans or when approved by the Engineer, areas
 where the nature of the work restricts or prohibits two-way flow,
 one-way operation may be maintained by using flaggers or timed
 signalization. The Contractor shall also provide and maintain in a
 safe condition temporary approaches or crossings and intersections
 with trails, roads, streets, businesses, parking lots, residences,
 garages, farms, etc. The Contractor shall bear all expense of
 maintaining traffic over the section of road undergoing
 improvement, and of constructing and maintaining such approaches,
 crossings, intersections, and other features as may be necessary,
 without direct compensation, unless a pay item for this work is
 included in the Contract.
 The Contractor is not responsible for general snow and ice
 removal. Snow and ice removal will be performed by State, County,
 or City forces, consistent with its snow and ice removal procedures,
 for the entire length of the route within which the project is located.
 Work required other than the normal blading of snow and ice,
 salting, or application of grit, necessary to clear or make passable the
 main roadway, shall be accomplished by the Contractor.
 104.06 Rights in and Use of Materials Found on the Work.
 The Contractor, with the approval of the Engineer, may use on the
 project such stone, gravel, sand, or other material, determined
 suitable by the Engineer, as may be found in the planned excavation
 and will be paid both for the excavation of such materials at the
 corresponding contract unit price and for the pay item for which the
 excavated material is used. However, the Contractor shall replace
 with other acceptable material at no cost to the Department all of
 that portion of the excavation material so removed and used that was
 needed for use in the embankments, backfills, approaches, or
 otherwise. No charge for the material so used will be made against
 the Contractor. The Contractor shall not excavate or remove any
 material from within the highway location that is not within the
 grading limits, as indicated by the slope and grade lines, without
 written authorization from the Engineer. When topsoil is stripped
 from within the project limits, measurement and payment for
 earthwork and the topsoil will be according to Sections 210 and 628.
 Planned excavation, for the purposes of this subsection, is defined as
 48
 
 104
 all excavation, including structural excavation-roadway, shown on
 the plans and/or as changed by the Engineer for any purpose other
 than obtaining additional material lying within the planned typical
 sections and slopes.
 Planned excavation also includes any
 excavation made beyond the ends of the project for the purpose of
 blending the new construction into the existing roadway.
 When the material found in the planned excavation is used as
 Borrow, payment will be made for either: 1) the appropriate
 classification of excavation; or 2) Borrow, whichever results in the
 lesser cost to the Department. In no case will payment be made for
 the same material for both excavation and borrow.
 Unless otherwise provided, any material from any existing
 structures designated salvageable that is to remain the property of
 the owner, may be used temporarily by the Contractor in the erection
 of the new structure. Such material shall not be cut or otherwise
 damaged. Material thus used and subsequently cut or damaged by
 the Contractor's action or inaction shall be replaced in kind with new
 material of like dimension at no cost to the Department.
 104.07 Final Cleaning Up. Upon completion of the work and
 before acceptance and final payment will be made, the Contractor
 shall remove from the right-of-way, from any temporary plant sites,
 and from any temporary equipment and material storage sites, all
 construction equipment, falsework, discarded material, rubbish,
 debris, temporary structures, footings, and all surplus material. For
 surplus merchantable aggregates, and upon written request of the
 property owner, the Engineer may authorize the Contractor to neatly
 spread or stockpile the aggregates on the temporary plant sites or
 material storage sites. The Contractor shall restore in an acceptable
 manner all property, both public and private, that has been damaged
 during the prosecution of the work and shall leave the waterways
 unobstructed and the roadway in a neat and presentable condition
 throughout the length of the work under contract. General mowing
 of the right-of-way will not be required of the Contractor. However,
 any isolated areas of excessively high vegetation existing within the
 project limits, such as at side roads and drives, which restrict or
 impair vehicular sight distance, shall be cut or mowed by the
 Contractor any time the situation develops.
 Final cleanup of temporary plant sites, equipment and material
 storage sites, waste areas, and the accompanying access roads shall
 49
 
 104
 be completed according to subsection 110.04 at no cost to the
 Department.
 Material pits and quarries shall be completed according to
 subsection 106.02 at no cost to the Department.
 The materials, labor, equipment, and expense of the final cleaning
 up of a project will not be paid for separately, but full compensation
 therefor will be considered included in the contract unit prices bid
 for the various items in the Contract.
 
 SECTION 105
 CONTROL OF WORK
 105.01 Authority of the Engineer. The Engineer will decide all
 questions that may arise as to the quality and acceptability of
 materials furnished and work performed and as to the rate of
 progress of the work; all questions that may arise as to the
 interpretation of the plans and specifications; and all questions as to
 the acceptable fulfillment of the Contract by the Contractor.
 The Engineer will have the authority to suspend the work wholly
 or in part due to the failure of the Contractor to correct conditions
 unsafe for the workers or the general public; for failure to carry out
 provisions of the Contract; for failure to carry out orders; for such
 periods as deemed necessary due to unsuitable weather; for
 conditions considered unsuitable for the prosecution of the work; or
 for any other condition or reason deemed to be in the public interest.
 Any unresolved disputes arising under the Contract shall be
 submitted by the Contractor in writing to the Department's Resident
 Engineer. Disputes claiming additional compensation shall contain
 the information set forth in Subsection 105.18(a) and (b). The
 Resident Engineer shall render a written decision within 60 calendar
 days of receipt of the Contractor’s letter and information.
 Should a dispute not be resolved by the written decision of the
 Resident Engineer, subsequent appeal by the Contractor shall be
 submitted in writing within 60 calendar days of the decision of the
 Resident Engineer, and shall be addressed directly to the Chief
 Engineer.
 50
 
 105
 The Chief Engineer shall render a decision on the matter in
 writing to the Contractor within 60 calendar days after receipt of the
 Contractor's written request for dispute resolution. The ruling by the
 Chief Engineer shall be final and conclusive unless, within 180
 calendar days from the date of issuance of the Chief Engineer's
 decision, the Contractor files a claim with the Arkansas State Claims
 Commission appealing the decision of the Chief Engineer. In
 connection with any appeal proceeding under this clause, the
 Contractor shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard and offer
 evidence in support of an appeal before the Arkansas State Claims
 Commission, subject to the rules and regulations of the Claims
 Commission and Ark. Code Ann. § 19-10-302 which require pursuit
 and exhaustion of all remedies against responsible third parties and
 insurance coverages. Pending final decision of a dispute hereunder,
 the Contractor shall proceed diligently with the performance of the
 Contract and in accordance with the Chief Engineer's decision.
 105.02 Automatically Controlled Equipment. Whenever a
 breakdown or malfunction of the automatic controls occurs on
 scales, scale printers, batch plants, or mixing plants, the equipment
 may be operated manually or by other methods for a period not to
 exceed two working days, provided that such alternate methods of
 operation produce results otherwise meeting the specifications.
 105.03 Plans and Working Drawings. Plans will show lines,
 grades, details of all structures, typical cross sections of the roadway,
 and a summary of items appearing on the proposal.
 Work may be provided for on the plans that is not located within
 the limits of the project as shown on the plan sheets. Work of this
 nature may include but is not limited to removal of existing items,
 obliteration, grading, base and surfacing, transitions, etc., and is
 considered a part of the project.
 The plans will be supplemented by such working drawings as are
 necessary to adequately control the work. Working drawings for
 structures shall be furnished by the Contractor and shall consist of
 such detailed plans as may be required to adequately control the
 work and are not included on the plans furnished by the Department.
 They shall include stress sheets, shop drawings, erection plans,
 falsework plans, cofferdam plans, or any other supplementary plans
 or similar data required of the Contractor. All working drawings
 51
 
 105
 shall be submitted to the Engineer for informational and record
 purposes or for approval as specified for the item of work involved.
 The Contractor should anticipate a review period of 15 - 30 calendar
 days from receipt by the Engineer of working drawings. Approval
 shall not relieve the Contractor of any responsibility under the
 Contract for the successful completion of the work.
 The Contract price shall include the cost of furnishing all working
 drawings.
 105.04 Conformity with Plans and Specifications. All work
 performed and all materials furnished shall be in reasonably close
 conformity with the lines, grades, cross sections, dimensions, and
 material requirements, including tolerances, shown on the plans or
 indicated in the specifications.
 Unless otherwise specified, in the event the materials or the
 finished product in which the materials are used is not within
 reasonably close conformity with the plans and specifications but
 reasonably acceptable work has been produced, the Engineer shall
 then determine if the work shall be accepted and remain in place. In
 this event, the Engineer will document the basis of acceptance by
 change order that will provide for an appropriate adjustment in the
 contract cost for such work or materials as deemed necessary to
 conform to the determination based on engineering judgement.
 In the event the materials or the finished product in which the
 materials are used or the work performed is found not to be in
 reasonably close conformity with the plans and specifications and
 have resulted in an inferior or unsatisfactory product, the work or
 materials shall be removed and replaced or otherwise corrected at no
 cost to the Department.
 105.05 Coordination of Plans, Specifications, Supplemental
 Specifications, and Special Provisions. These specifications, the
 supplemental specifications, the plans, special provisions, and all
 supplementary documents are essential parts of the Contract, and a
 requirement occurring in one is as binding as though occurring in all.
 They are intended to be complementary and to describe and provide
 for a complete work. In case of discrepancy:
 •
 
 Shown or computed dimensions will govern over scaled
 dimensions;
 52
 
 105
 Special provisions will govern over plans, supplemental
 specifications, and standard specifications;
 • Plans will govern over supplemental specifications and
 standard specifications;
 • Supplemental specifications will govern over standard
 specifications.
 Neither the Contractor nor the Department shall take advantage of
 any apparent error or omission on the plans or in the proposal,
 Contract, or specifications. The party discovering such error or
 omission shall notify the other party when the discovery is made.
 The Engineer will then make such corrections and interpretations as
 may be deemed necessary for fulfilling the intent of the plans and
 specifications.
 105.06 Cooperation by Contractor. The Contractor will be
 supplied with a minimum of two sets of approved plans and
 Contracts, one set of which shall be kept available on the project at
 all times.
 The Contractor shall give the work the attention necessary to
 facilitate the progress thereof and shall cooperate fully with the
 Engineer, inspectors, and other Contractors. Failure to cooperate
 may result in default according to Subsection 108.08.
 The Contractor shall furnish an agent who is a competent
 superintendent or supervisor who is on the project while work is
 being performed and accessible to the Engineer during all hours of
 each workday. The agent shall be capable of reading and fully
 understanding the plans and specifications and thoroughly
 experienced in the type of work being performed. The
 superintendent shall receive instructions from the Engineer and shall
 have full authority to execute orders or directions of the Engineer
 without delay and to promptly supply such materials, labor,
 equipment, tools, and incidentals as may be required. Such
 superintendent shall be furnished regardless of the amount of work
 sublet.
 105.07 Cooperation with Utilities. In general, the Contract will
 indicate various utility items, certain of which are to be relocated or
 adjusted by the utility owner, and others that are to be relocated or
 adjusted by the Contractor. The Department will notify all known
 utility companies, all known pipe line owners, or other known
 parties affected, and endeavor to have all necessary adjustments of
 53
 •
 
 105
 the public or private utility fixtures, pipe lines, and other
 appurtenances within or adjacent to the limits of construction made
 as soon as practicable.
 Water lines, gas lines, wire lines, service connections, water and
 gas meter boxes, water and gas valve boxes, light standards,
 cableways, signals, and all other utility appurtenances within the
 limits of the proposed construction that are to be relocated or
 adjusted are to be moved by the owners, except as otherwise
 provided for in the Special Provisions or as noted on the plans.
 The Contractor shall consider in the bid all of the permanent and
 temporary utility facilities and appurtenances in their present,
 relocated, or proposed positions.
 No additional monetary
 compensation will be allowed for any delays, inconveniences, or
 damages sustained due to any interference from the utilities or
 appurtenances or from the operations of relocating them.
 Assessment of time charges shall be in accordance with Subsection
 108.06.
 105.08 Coordination and Cooperation Between Contractors.
 The Department reserves the right at any time to contract for and
 perform other or additional work on or near the work covered by the
 Contract.
 When separate contracts are let adjacent to or within the limits of
 any one project, the work of each Contractor shall be conducted so
 as not to interfere with or hinder the progress or completion of the
 work being performed by other Contractors. Contractors working on
 the same project shall cooperate with each other.
 It is understood and agreed that the Contractor considered, in the
 bid, the status of the existing Contract or Contracts at the time of
 bidding and will arrange to coordinate and schedule the work jointly
 with the other affected Contractors in order to complete the work
 within the time allowed in the Contract.
 Contractors involved shall assume all liability, financial or
 otherwise, in connection with their own Contracts and shall protect
 and save harmless the Department from any and all damages or
 claims that may arise because of inconvenience, delay, or loss
 experienced because of the presence and operations of other
 Contractors working within the limits of the same project.
 54
 
 105
 Contractors shall arrange their work and shall place and dispose
 of the materials being used so as not to interfere with the operations
 of the other Contractors within the limits of the same project, and
 shall join their work with that of the others in an acceptable manner,
 and shall perform it in proper sequence with that of the others.
 105.09 Construction Stakes, Lines, and Grades.
 When
 Section 635, Roadway Construction Control, and/or Section 636,
 Bridge Construction Control is not included in the Contract, the
 Engineer will set construction stakes establishing lines, slopes, and
 profile grade in road work, and line and grade for bridge work,
 culvert work, protective and accessory structures and appurtenances
 as may be deemed necessary, and will furnish the Contractor with all
 necessary information relating to lines, slopes, and grades. The
 Department will be responsible for the accuracy of all stakes or
 marks set by the Department to establish the planned lines, slopes,
 and grades. These stakes and marks shall constitute the field control
 with which the Contractor shall be responsible for accurately
 establishing other necessary controls and performing the work.
 The Contractor will be held responsible for the preservation of all
 stakes and marks. If any of the construction stakes or marks are
 carelessly or willfully destroyed or disturbed by the Contractor, the
 cost of replacing them will be deducted from the payment for the
 work.
 Before beginning work, the Contractor must be satisfied as to the
 correctness and meaning of all stakes, measurements, and marks.
 No claim will be entertained as a result of alleged inaccuracies
 unless the Contractor notifies the Engineer thereof in writing in time
 for the Engineer to verify or check such stakes or marks before the
 work is begun.
 All construction control markings made for layout work,
 placement of traffic control devices, spotting for placement of
 pavement markings, or for any other purposes on structures, curb
 and gutters, pavements, or any surfaces that will not either be
 removed or covered by succeeding pavement layers or other
 construction shall be made with non-permanent materials (chalk,
 keel, non-permanent paint, etc.). Failure to comply with this
 requirement will result in removal of the markings by the Contractor
 at no expense to the Department.
 55
 
 105
 105.10 Authority and Duties of Resident Engineer. As the
 direct representative of the Engineer, the Resident Engineer has
 immediate charge of the engineering details of each construction
 project; is responsible for the general administration of the project;
 and has the authority to reject unacceptable material or work and to
 suspend any work that is being improperly performed.
 105.11 Duties of the Resident Engineer's Personnel.
 Inspection personnel will be authorized to inspect all work
 performed and all materials furnished. Such inspection may extend
 to all or any part of the work and to the preparation, fabrication, or
 manufacture of the materials to be used. The inspection personnel
 will not be authorized to alter or waive the provisions of the
 Contract and will not be authorized to issue instructions contrary to
 the plans and specifications, or to act as supervisor for the
 Contractor. The inspection personnel shall, however, have the
 authority to reject work or materials until any questions at issue can
 be referred to and decided by the Engineer.
 105.12 Inspection of Work. The Engineer shall be allowed
 access to all parts of the work and shall be furnished with such
 information and assistance by the Contractor as is necessary to make
 a complete and detailed inspection.
 When requested by the Engineer at any time before acceptance of
 the work, the Contractor shall remove or uncover such portions of
 the finished work as may be directed. After examination, the
 Contractor shall restore said portions of the work to the standard
 required by the specifications. Should the work thus exposed or
 examined prove acceptable, the uncovering or removing and the
 replacing of the covering or making good of the parts removed will
 be paid for as extra work. Should the work so exposed or examined
 prove unacceptable, the uncovering or removing and the replacing of
 the covering or making good of the parts removed will be at no cost
 to the Department.
 Any work performed or materials used without inspection by an
 authorized Department representative may be ordered removed and
 replaced at no cost to the Department.
 When any unit of government, political subdivision, railroad
 corporation, or other agency is to pay a portion of the cost of the
 work covered by the Contract, its respective representatives shall
 56
 
 105
 have the right to inspect the work. Such inspection shall in no sense
 make any unit of government, political subdivision, railroad
 corporation, or other agency a party to the Contract, and shall in no
 way interfere with the rights of either party thereunder.
 105.13 Removal of Unacceptable or Unauthorized Work. All
 work that does not comply with the requirements of the Contract
 will be considered unacceptable, unless otherwise determined
 acceptable under the provisions of Subsection 105.04.
 Unacceptable work, whether the result of poor workmanship, use
 of unacceptable materials, damage through carelessness, negligence,
 or any other cause, found to exist before the final acceptance of the
 work, shall be removed and replaced in an acceptable manner at no
 cost to the Department.
 Unless otherwise provided, no work shall be done without lines
 and grades having been established. Work performed contrary to
 any instructions of the Engineer; work performed beyond the lines
 shown on the plans or as established, except as herein specified; or
 any extra work performed without authority will be considered as
 unauthorized and will not be paid for under the provisions of the
 Contract. Work so performed may be ordered removed or replaced
 at no cost to the Department.
 Should the Contractor fail to comply with any order of the
 Engineer, the Engineer will have the authority to cause unauthorized
 work to be removed and unacceptable work to be corrected or
 removed and replaced and to deduct the costs from any moneys due
 or to become due the Contractor.
 105.14 Load Restrictions. The Contractor shall comply with all
 legal load restrictions in the hauling of materials on public roads
 being maintained for the traveling public. A special permit will not
 relieve the Contractor of liability for damage that may result from
 construction equipment operations. The operation of equipment of
 such weight or so loaded as to cause damage to structures or the
 roadway or to any other type of construction will not be permitted.
 The Contractor shall submit to the Engineer, for information and
 record purposes, an engineering analysis evaluating the structural
 adequacy of a bridge for any of the following to cross the structure
 or be placed on the structure:
 57
 
 105
 (a) For bridges to be constructed as part of the Contract:
 (1) Vehicle(s) or equipment that exceeds the legal load.
 (2) Off-road equipment or off-road vehicles that exceed
 20,000 pounds.
 (3) Stockpiled material exceeding 75 pounds/square foot based
 on a uniform distribution of load. Loads that are non-uniform in
 nature shall be uniformly distributed to the bridge deck by the use
 of timbers or other means approved by the Engineer. The total
 area of stockpiled material within a span shall not exceed 600
 square feet.
 (b) For existing bridges that will be used by the traveling public
 during or after the Contract or if the plans include salvage
 requirements by the Owner:
 (1) Vehicle(s) or equipment that exceeds the legal load or
 posted weight restrictions.
 (2) Off-road equipment or off-road vehicles that exceed the
 lesser of 20,000 pounds or 75% of the least posted
 weight restrictions.
 (3) Stockpiled material.
 The engineering analysis shall be consistent with the design
 specifications, if known, that were used to design the bridge and
 shall be prepared by an Arkansas Professional Engineer who shall
 certify the adequacy of all components of the bridge for the
 anticipated loads. The certification shall include a detailed list of
 any restrictions of the vehicles, equipment, and loads. Sufficient
 supporting calculations and documentation shall be included in the
 engineering analysis. Unequal distribution of weight due to the
 vehicle or equipment’s use shall be considered, such as a crane being
 used to lift material. Considerations shall also be given to loads
 placed on partially completed bridge decks and the possible
 detrimental effects to the beam’s profile within the deck area that
 has not yet been constructed.
 Equipment and vehicle literature detailing the axle loads and
 configuration, spacing and length of tracks, operating weights, and
 other relevant data along with a summary of assumptions,
 restrictions, and limitations shall be included with the engineering
 58
 
 105
 analysis. A diagram detailing the location, extent of span area, and
 weight shall also be included for stockpiled material exceeding the
 weight limitations shown above. The engineering analysis shall
 consider independent and simultaneous arrangement of the vehicles
 in single or repeated crossings and any temporary barriers, material,
 and equipment utilized in construction operations.
 For use in the engineering analysis of existing bridges, inspection
 records and design drawings, if available, may be requested from the
 Programs and Contracts Division during the advertisement period or
 from the Engineer after award of the Contract. The inspection
 records shall be used to determine the loss of load carrying capacity
 of a bridge element due to any deterioration or additional loads that
 are subsequent to the bridge’s original construction.
 Bridge decks constructed as part of the Contract or the deck of an
 existing bridge that is used or will be used by the traveling public
 shall be temporarily protected as approved by the Engineer from any
 vehicles, equipment, or material that would damage the bridge deck.
 When hauling materials over the base or surface courses under
 construction, the Contractor shall limit the hauling as necessary to
 prevent damage. No loads will be permitted on bases, pavements, or
 structures before the expiration of the specified curing period
 controlling such operations.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for all damage resulting from
 construction operations.
 The City, County, or Department may restrict the load limit on
 any route under their jurisdiction at any time.
 Compliance with this specification will not be paid for separately,
 but full compensation thereof will be considered included in the
 Contract unit prices.
 105.15 Maintenance During Construction. The Contractor
 shall maintain the work during construction and until the project is
 accepted.
 This maintenance shall constitute continuous and
 effective work prosecuted day by day, with adequate equipment and
 forces, to the end that the roadway or structures are kept in
 satisfactory condition at all times.
 
 59
 
 105
 In the case of a Contract for the placing of a course upon a course
 or subgrade previously constructed, the Contractor shall maintain the
 previous course or subgrade during all construction operations.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for the maintenance of
 existing drainage ditches and channels within the right-of-way
 limits, including construction easements if any, from the date any
 work is begun on the project to the date of its final acceptance. This
 is not a requirement that the Contractor improve existing drainage
 ditches and channels, except as shown on the plans or as directed by
 the Engineer. The Contractor shall maintain the waterways in such
 condition that damage to the work or to abutting property will not
 result from the Contractor's operation. Obstruction of natural flow
 in waterways by stockpiling or storing materials, or by placement of
 equipment or supplies without provision for adequate by-passing of
 such natural flow, will not be permitted. Collections of sediment or
 debris that prohibits or inhibits normal function of drainage facilities
 shall be removed promptly.
 All costs of maintenance work during construction and before the
 project is accepted will not be paid for separately, but full
 compensation therefor will be considered included in the contract
 unit prices bid for the various items in the Contract.
 105.16 Failure to Maintain Roadway or Structure. If the
 Contractor, at any time, fails to comply with the provisions of
 subsection 105.15, the Engineer will immediately notify the
 Contractor of such noncompliance. If the Contractor fails to remedy
 unsatisfactory maintenance within 24 hours after receipt of such
 notice, the Engineer may immediately proceed to maintain the
 project and the entire cost of this maintenance will be deducted from
 moneys due or to become due the Contractor on the Contract.
 105.17 Acceptance. (a) Partial Acceptance. The Engineer may
 accept units or substantially completed portions of a project when it
 is in the best interest of the Department. Partial acceptance will
 generally be made on stage construction projects where the partial
 acceptance of a portion of the project will allow an early issuance of
 a work order on a contract located within the limits of the first
 contract. Such partial acceptance shall in no way void or alter any of
 the terms of the Contract.
 
 60
 
 105
 Devices intended to be used for traffic safety and control, which
 are permanently installed in their final position and being used by
 the traveling public, will be accepted when installed according to the
 plans and specifications before completion of the remaining work on
 the project. Permanently installed items accepted on this basis are
 limited to guardrail, impact attenuation barriers, traffic signal items,
 signs, delineators, lighting, raised pavement markers, concrete
 barrier wall, concrete bridge parapet, bridge railings, guard cable,
 crash cushions, permanent pavement markings, and fence. Any
 required performance tests and/or guarantees shall remain
 applicable.
 The Contractor shall erect these items in a logical sequence and
 time frame within the life of the project and any of these items
 constructed prematurely will not be accepted until such time in the
 life of the project that the device becomes effective for its intended
 use.
 Damage, theft, or vandalism to these items after acceptance will
 be repaired and/or replaced by the Department, or by the Contractor
 at the applicable contract unit price. When the damage to an item is
 such that only partial repair or replacement is required and the work
 is to be done by the Contractor, payment shall be made as provided
 in Subsection 109.04. Items damaged due to negligence of the
 Contractor shall be repaired and/or replaced at no cost to the
 Department.
 The Department reserves the sole right to seek any and all
 recovery of repair or replacement costs from those parties
 responsible for damage to permanently installed items accepted
 according to this subsection.
 (b) Final Acceptance. As soon as practical after completion of
 the entire project, including receipt of all required documentation,
 the Engineer will make an inspection. If all construction provided
 for and contemplated by the Contract is found to have been
 satisfactorily completed, that inspection shall constitute the final
 inspection and the Engineer will make the final acceptance and
 notify the Contractor in writing of this acceptance as of the date of
 the final inspection.
 If, however, the inspection discloses any work, in whole or in
 part, as being unsatisfactory, the Engineer will advise the Contractor
 61
 
 105
 of the work requiring correction. The Contractor shall immediately
 make the required corrections. Upon correction of the work, another
 inspection will be made which shall constitute the final inspection
 provided the work has been satisfactorily completed. In such event,
 the Engineer will make the final acceptance and notify the
 Contractor in writing of this acceptance as of the date of final
 inspection.
 105.18 Claims for Adjustment and Disputes. (a) General. If,
 in any case, the Contractor deems that additional compensation is
 due for work or material not clearly covered in the Contract or not
 ordered by the Engineer as extra work, as defined in
 Subsection 104.04, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer in
 writing of intention to make claim for such additional compensation
 before beginning the work on which the claim is based. If such
 notification is not given and the Engineer is not afforded proper time
 and facilities by the Contractor for keeping accurate account of the
 actual costs of the work, the Contractor hereby agrees to waive any
 claim for such additional compensation. Such notice by the
 Contractor and the fact that the Engineer has kept account of the cost
 of the work shall not in any way be construed as proving or
 substantiating the validity of the claim. If the claim, after
 consideration by the Engineer, is found to be just and adequately
 supported, an adjustment will be made to the Contract. If the
 Contract does not contain a pay item for which the adjustment can
 be made, the adjustment will be made according to
 Subsection 109.04.
 Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as establishing any
 claim contrary to the terms of Subsection 104.02.
 All claims shall be in sufficient detail to enable the Engineer to
 determine the basis for entitlement and the costs incurred, excluding
 loss of anticipated profits, organization or overhead expenses not
 related directly to the project, or interest. The following information
 must accompany each claim:
 (1) A detailed factual statement of the claim providing all
 necessary dates, locations, and items of work affected by the
 claim.
 (2) The date actions resulting in the claim occurred or
 conditions resulting in the claim became evident.
 62
 
 105
 (3) A copy of the "Notice of Potential Claim" filed for the
 specific claim.

 claim, and a statement why such provisions support the claim.
 (7) The identification of any pertinent documents, and the
 substance of any material oral communications relating to the
 claim.
 (8) A statement whether the additional compensation or
 extension of time is based on the provisions of the Contract or an
 alleged breach of Contract.
 (9) If an extension of time is also sought, the specific days for
 which it is sought and the basis for such claim.
 (10) The amount of additional compensation sought and a
 breakdown which clearly differentiates the additional cost from
 the Contractor’s normally anticipated costs for an item or project.
 (11) Any other information or documents that may be relevant
 to the claim.
 All claims must be submitted to the Resident Engineer within 180
 calendar days after receipt of the Final Estimate. Failure to do so
 shall constitute a waiver of said claims.
 (b) Required Certification of Claims. When submitting a
 claim, the Contractor must certify in writing, under oath according to
 the formalities required, as to the following:
 (1) The claim is made in good faith.
 (2) Supportive data are accurate and complete to the
 Contractor's best knowledge and belief.
 (3) The amount of the claim accurately reflects the actual cost
 incurred by the Contractor.
 (c) Auditing of Claims. All claims filed against the Department
 shall be subject to audit by the Department at any time following the
 63
 
 105
 claim filing, whether the claim is part of a suit pending in the courts
 of this State or an action before the State Claims Commission. The
 audit may begin upon ten business days notice to the Contractor,
 subcontractor, or supplier. The Contractor, subcontractor, or
 supplier shall make a good faith effort to cooperate with the auditors
 and shall provide access to the following documents upon the
 request of the Chief Engineer:

 agrees that in no event shall a claim be submitted to the Resident
 Engineer more than 180 calendar days after the receipt of the Final
 Estimate for the project and the Contractor acknowledges and agrees
 that any claim submitted to the Department or before the Arkansas
 State Claims Commission later than 180 calendar days from receipt
 of the Final Estimate shall be deemed waived by the Contractor.
 
 SECTION 106
 CONTROL OF MATERIAL
 106.01 Sources of Supply and Quality Requirements.
 (a) General. The materials used in the work shall meet all quality
 requirements of the Contract. To expedite the inspection and testing
 of materials, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer of proposed
 sources of materials before delivery. At the option of the Engineer,
 certain materials may be approved at the source of supply before
 delivery is started. If it is found after trial that sources of supply for
 previously approved materials do not produce specified products, the
 Contractor shall furnish materials from other sources. Materials
 shall be approved before being incorporated in the work.
 The Contractor shall assume full responsibility for ordering
 materials of the quality and quantity required and for the delivered
 costs of such materials. Materials needed in the work shall be
 furnished by the Contractor unless otherwise stated in the Contract.
 (b) Steel and Iron Items.
 (1) General. Steel and iron items are subject to the “Buy
 America” provisions of 23 CFR § 635.410, and the requirements
 and restrictions of this section:
 65
 
 106
 Except as provided hereinafter, steel and iron materials shall
 not be permanently incorporated into the work unless all
 manufacturing processes (e.g., smelting, remelting, and any
 subsequent process that alters the material's physical form or
 changes its chemical composition) occur within the United States.
 This includes, but is not limited to, such processes as rolling,
 extruding, machining, bending, grinding, drilling, fabrication, and
 coating. Coating includes all processes that protect or enhance
 the value of the material to which the coating is applied. The use
 of pig iron or processed, pelletized, and reduced iron ore
 manufactured outside of the United States is permitted in the
 domestic manufacturing process for steel and/or iron materials.
 All steel and iron mill test reports must include a certified
 statement that all manufacturing processes for the iron or steel
 product
 occurred
 in
 the United
 States.
 Each
 manufacturer/fabricator shall provide the same certification.
 Each supplier shall provide certification of the transfer of
 intermediate products, thereby generating a chain of custody
 documentation. Exceptions are as follows:
 a. These requirements do not prevent a minimal use of
 foreign iron or steel material if the cost of such materials
 used does not exceed 0.1% of the total Contract cost or
 $2,500, whichever is greater. For comparison with either of
 these given limitations, the cost is that shown to be the
 value of steel products as they are delivered to the project.
 b. These requirements do not apply when the Engineer
 establishes:
 •
 
 That their application would be inconsistent with
 the public interest, or
 
 •
 
 That such materials are not produced in the United
 States in sufficient and reasonably available
 quantities that are of a satisfactory quality.
 
 The determination of foreign or domestic character is based on
 place of manufacture. The burden of proof for the place of
 manufacture shall rest with the Contractor. The cost of any
 foreign materials permanently incorporated into the work shall be
 documented by the Contractor and the documentation submitted
 to the Engineer.
 66
 
 106
 (2) Foreign Steel Option. If the Proposal for the project
 contains an alternate bid system for submitting a bid for
 furnishing domestic structural steel for which all manufacturing
 processes occur in the United States and a bid for furnishing
 foreign structural steel, bidders are hereby advised that the
 Contract will be awarded to the bidder who submits the lowest
 total bid based on furnishing domestic structural steel unless such
 total bid exceeds the lowest total bid based on furnishing foreign
 structural steel by more than 25%.
 If the bidder proposes to furnish foreign structural steel, it
 shall be mandatory that a bid for domestic structural steel also be
 submitted. If the bidder proposes to furnish domestic structural
 steel, it will not be necessary to submit a bid for foreign structural
 steel.
 Structural steel is hereby defined as steel sheet piling
 (Section 811-Sheet Piles); H-piling and shell or pipe piling
 (Section 805-Piling); and W, M, S, or Z shapes, plates, channels,
 angles, and/or T-sections (Section 807-Steel Structures).
 (3) Quality Control for Foreign Steel. When the Contractor
 elects to purchase items of structural steel manufactured outside
 the United States, such materials shall be furnished only from
 those foreign manufacturers who have previously established, to
 the satisfaction of the Engineer, the sufficiency of ability to
 furnish material uniformly and consistently in conformance with
 the Specifications.
 Proof of sufficiency must be provided to the Engineer by the
 Contractor and the Engineer's approval obtained before
 manufacture of the material is authorized. Proof may be
 established by 1) the Contractor providing the Engineer with a
 detailed written certification by an established and approved
 independent testing and inspection laboratory or agency showing
 evidence that the foreign manufacturer has previously established
 in-plant quality control to give assurance of their ability to furnish
 material uniformly and consistently in conformance with the
 specifications, or 2) a thorough in-plant inspection of the foreign
 manufacturer's facilities by the Engineer or an appointed
 representative. The cost of determining such sufficiency shall be
 borne by the Contractor.
 67
 
 106
 When the Contractor elects to have items of structural steel
 fabricated outside the United States, the Contractor shall
 reimburse the Department for all costs connected with the
 inspection of such fabrication, including necessary expenses for
 the Engineer or a representative to make an in-plant inspection or
 to arrange for an inspection agency to handle the shop inspection.
 Reimbursement for costs of determining sufficiency and
 inspection of fabrication shall be made by the Contractor upon
 receipt of detailed billing prepared by the Department.
 Steel material manufactured outside the United States shall be
 delivered to the fabrication site where it shall be retained a
 sufficient period of time to permit inspection, sampling, and
 testing, as deemed necessary by the Engineer, before fabrication.
 Before fabrication or shipment of any foreign produced
 structural steel items, the Contractor shall obtain all the Certified
 Mill Test Reports clearly identifiable to the lot of material to be
 shipped. These reports shall be identifiable by heat numbers and
 color-coding, and shall be submitted to the Engineer for complete
 review, analysis, and approval.
 The Contractor or a designated representative shall serve as
 the Communication Contact for any structural steel fabricator
 outside the United States. All correspondence, telephone calls,
 and other forms of communication from the Department or its
 representative will be made with the Communication Contact and
 not with the foreign industry.
 Costs involved in materials testing, shop inspection,
 communication, consultation, and coordination that are incurred
 because of the use of materials produced or fabricated outside the
 continental limits of the United States, shall be borne by the
 Contractor.
 106.02 Furnishing Materials from Borrow Areas, Pits, or
 Quarries. The required materials shall be obtained from local or
 commercial sources.
 When obtained from local sources, applicable severance taxes
 shall be paid by the Contractor.
 Borrow areas, material pits, and quarry sites shall comply with
 the following requirements:
 68
 
 106
 1) All Areas, Pits, or Quarries. In general, the nearest edge of an
 area, pit, or quarry shall be no closer than 300' (100 m) from the
 nearest right-of-way line of a State Highway, except as provided
 in 3) or 4) below. All slopes shall be 2:1 or flatter, except that
 faces of rock quarries shall be cut to a neat appearance with the
 overburden sloped to 2:1 or flatter.
 2) Water Retaining Pits or Quarries. Water retaining pits or
 quarries will not be permitted within 300' (100 m) of the nearest
 right-of-way line of a State Highway.
 3) Drained Areas, Pits, or Quarries. Areas, pits, or quarries shall
 comply with 1) above but with the following exceptions: a) if the
 material is being obtained from a site that is being excavated and
 contoured to conform to the terrain of the adjacent surroundings,
 or b) if the site is to be used as a commercial or residential
 building location as defined in the agreement with the property
 owner.
 4) In the event that an area, pit, or quarry is closer than 300'
 (100 m) from the right-of-way line of a County Road or City
 Street, the written approval of the governing authority shall be
 furnished the Engineer prior to any excavation.
 5) When sites are closer than 300' (100 m) from the right-of-way
 line, the slope in the area, pit, or quarry adjacent to the right-ofway shall not be steeper than that of the backslope or foreslope
 of the existing or planned roadway in the area of the site. All
 other slopes in the site shall not be steeper than 2:1, except that
 faces of rock quarries shall be cut to a neat appearance with the
 overburden sloped to 2:1 or flatter. In addition, if the floor of the
 site is sloped away from the right-of-way line, the slope shall not
 be steeper than 6:1 for a distance of 100' (30 m) from the rightof-way line.
 The final quantity of material removed from each pit will be
 verified by the Engineer and furnished the Contractor as soon as
 possible after the final measurements have been made, except that
 no measurement will be made by the Department when Compacted
 Embankment is a pay item or when Borrow is specified to be paid as
 Plan Quantity. In such cases, the determination of the quantity of
 material removed from each pit shall be the responsibility of the
 Contractor.
 69
 
 106
 The Contractor shall be responsible for resolving disputes or
 claims arising from the pit operations.
 Natural tree screens shall be preserved during the course of
 construction. Haul roads will not be allowed to pass through tree
 screens except where absolutely necessary for access to the
 construction site. A temporary haul road through a tree screen shall
 be normal to the roadway and the cleared width shall be no more
 than is necessary to accomplish the work. In general, temporary haul
 roads will not be approved through natural tree screens at intervals
 closer than 500' (120 m).
 All applicable work involved in furnishing borrow, pit, or
 quarried materials, including:
 •
 •
 •
 •
 •
 •
 •
 •
 
 Clearing, grubbing, stripping, and disposal of overburdens or
 other unsatisfactory material;
 Stockpiling and replacing topsoil;
 Loosening, excavating, and hauling;
 Screening, furnishing right-of-way, and constructing and
 maintaining haul roads;
 Fence moving and reconstructing;
 Confining livestock;
 Seeding and restoration, as required; and
 Complying with Section 110 and Subsection 107.10
 
 will not be paid for separately, but full compensation therefor will
 be considered included in the contract unit prices bid for the various
 items of work.
 106.03 Samples, Tests, and Cited Specifications. All materials
 will be inspected, tested, and accepted as required by these
 specifications before incorporation in the work.
 Whenever a reference is made in the specifications to the
 Department's Manual of Field Sampling and Testing Procedures, it
 shall mean the revision in effect on the day the advertisement for
 bids is dated. Copies of this manual are available from the Engineer
 of Materials.
 Whenever a reference is made in the specifications to a Federal
 Specification, or to a specification or test designation of the
 American Association of State Highway and Transportation
 Officials, the American Society for Testing and Materials, or any
 70
 
 106
 other recognized national organization, it shall mean the year of
 adoption or latest revision of the specification or test designation in
 effect on the day the advertisement for bids is dated. When a
 specific reference is made to a dated specification or test
 designation, the revision in effect on that date shall apply.
 When requested, the Contractor shall furnish a complete certified
 statement of the origin, composition, and/or manufacture of
 materials that are to be used in the work.
 106.04 Acceptance of Materials. All materials used in the work
 shall conform to the specified requirements. For the purposes of
 determining conformance with specifications, all limits are to be
 considered absolute limits, according to ASTM E-29, “Standard
 Practice for Using Significant Digits in Test Data to Determine
 Conformance with Specifications. Limits are maximums,
 minimums, or tolerances and shall be considered absolute limits.
 Observed or calculated values shall not be rounded but shall be
 compared directly with the limit. Any deviation, however small,
 outside the limit shall be considered non-complying. Reported
 values that are an average of two or more test values are to be
 rounded-off to the same number of significant digits as the
 individual test value even though the specification requirements are
 considered absolute. Test values and reported values are to be the
 same and are to show the same number of significant figures
 allowed by the accuracy of the test procedure and the equipment
 being used.
 In the case of materials for which quality may be subject to
 change during handling and storage, samples may be taken at the
 source for informational purposes only. Sampling will be performed
 at the latest practicable time the Engineer deems it necessary to
 check compliance with specification requirements either prior to,
 during, or after incorporation in the work. Regardless of any
 compliance at that time, if there is subsequent indication of change in
 any material it will again be tested for compliance.
 All materials used are subject to inspection and testing during
 preparation, placement, manipulation, and use. The Contractor will
 be held responsible for damage, contamination, segregation, and/or
 degradation caused by poor methods of stockpiling, manufacture,
 handling, placement, and/or by poor workmanship or negligence
 prior to completion and acceptance of the work.
 71
 
 106
 Further, the Contractor shall be responsible for defects in
 accordance with Subsections 107.20 and 109.02.
 All Contractor Acceptance Tests must be signed by the certified
 technician performing the test and submitted to the Engineer on the
 next business day after the test is performed. All test reports shall
 contain the following information, as a minimum:
 • Job Number
 • Date of Test
 • Type of Material (i.e. ACHM Surface Course, Aggregate
 Base Course Cl. 5, etc.)
 • Test Method
 • Property being Tested (i.e. gradation, compressive strength,
 etc.)
 • Sample Location
 • Quantity Represented (Lot or Sublot size)
 • Quality Control or Acceptance Test indicator
 • Sequential sample number for each project
 • Name, Signature, Title, and Certification number of
 Technician performing the test.
 • Name and address of testing laboratory (if applicable)
 • Pass or Fail indicator (in addition to actual numerical test
 results)
 Examples of acceptance test report forms are found in the
 Department’s Manual of Field Sampling and Testing Procedures.
 106.05 Plant Inspection. The Engineer may undertake the
 inspection of materials at the source.
 In the event plant inspection is undertaken the following
 conditions shall be met:
 (a) The Engineer shall have the cooperation and assistance of the
 Contractor and of the producers of materials for the work.
 (b) The Engineer shall have full entry at all times to such parts of
 the plant as may concern the manufacture or production of the
 materials being furnished.
 (c) Adequate safety measures shall be provided and maintained.
 106.06 Storage of Materials. Materials shall be so stored as to
 assure the preservation of their quality and fitness for the work.
 72
 
 106
 Stored materials, even though approved before storage, may again be
 inspected before their use in the work. Stored materials shall be
 located so as to facilitate their prompt inspection. Approved
 portions of the right-of-way may be used for storage purposes and
 for the placing of the Contractor's plant and equipment, but any
 additional space required therefor must be provided by the
 Contractor, and at no cost to the Department. Private property shall
 not be used for storage purposes without written permission of the
 owner or lessee, and if requested by the Engineer, copies of such
 written permission shall be furnished.
 106.07 Handling Materials. All materials shall be handled in
 such manner as to preserve their quality and fitness for the work.
 Aggregates shall be transported from the storage site to the work in
 tight vehicles so constructed as to prevent loss or segregation of
 materials after loading and measuring so that there may be no
 inconsistencies in the quantities of materials intended for
 incorporation in the work as loaded and the quantities as actually
 received at the place of operations.
 106.08 Unacceptable Materials. All materials not conforming
 to the requirements of the specifications at the time they are used
 shall be considered as unacceptable and all such materials will be
 rejected and shall be removed immediately from the site of the work
 unless otherwise instructed by the Engineer. No rejected material,
 the defects of which have been corrected, shall be used until
 approval has been given.
 106.09 Department-Furnished Material. The Contractor shall
 furnish all materials required to complete the work, except those
 specified to be furnished by the Department.
 Material furnished by the Department will be delivered or made
 available to the Contractor at the points specified in the Special
 Provisions.
 The cost of handling and placing all materials after they are
 delivered to the Contractor will not be paid for separately, but full
 compensation therefor will be considered included in the contract
 unit price(s) bid for the item(s) with which they are used.
 The Contractor will be held responsible for all material delivered
 by the Department through this arrangement. Deductions will be
 made from any moneys due the Contractor to make good any
 73
 
 106
 shortages and deficiencies, from any cause whatsoever; for any
 damage that may occur after such delivery; and for any demurrage
 charges.
 106.10 Qualified Products List. The Department maintains a
 Qualified Products List (QPL). Various materials are listed on the
 QPL by manufacturer, supplier, and/or brand name. Specific brands,
 manufacturers, and/or suppliers may be added to the QPL upon
 request and compliance with the requirements specified for the type
 of material involved. Materials listed on the QPL will be accepted
 under the procedures specified therein. Information concerning the
 QPL may be obtained from the Engineer of Materials.
 Products listed on the QPL must meet all the appropriate
 requirements of the specifications. The quality of materials listed on
 the QPL will be monitored by the Department through random
 sampling and testing.
 The listing of a material on the QPL will in no way relieve the
 Contractor of furnishing material meeting the specification
 requirements. Material may be rejected if the Engineer determines
 that the material is contaminated and/or damaged or if products
 normally shipped as packaged units have been opened and partially
 used before delivery to the project.
 The QPL does not constitute an endorsement by the Department
 of any product, manufacturer, or supplier, but is a listing of products
 that have been prequalified for use. If the Specifications designate
 that a material shall be one listed on the QPL or from a source listed
 on the QPL, the Contractor has the option of furnishing a material or
 using a source that is not listed provided that the material or source
 is shown by appropriate certifications and/or test reports to meet the
 requirements necessary for listing on the QPL.
 For materials not listed on the QPL, if deemed appropriate, the
 Engineer may require and accept the manufacturer's certified
 analysis in lieu of sampling and testing of commercial or
 manufactured products.
 106.11 Contractor Acceptance Test Evaluation.
 The
 Contractor’s acceptance test results will be evaluated by the
 Department and will be correlated with other test results available
 for the same material. The Department will use all tests and witness
 the Contractor’s sampling and testing methods as part of this
 74
 
 106
 verification process in accordance with the Manual of Field
 Sampling and Testing Procedures.
 If the results fail to correlate within the limits shown in the
 Manual of Field Sampling and Testing Procedures or if the witness
 of the sampling and testing indicates the utilization of improper
 procedures, the Engineer will notify the Contractor and document
 the finding. In such case, the Engineer reserves the right to instruct
 the Contractor to cease materials placement to prevent noncomplying materials from being utilized. Operations may resume
 when, in the Engineer’s judgment, sampling and testing procedures
 are acceptable. The Contractor will continue to be responsible for
 providing material meeting the applicable Specification.
 The Contractor shall investigate the cause of the failure of the test
 results to correlate and document and report the findings to the
 Engineer. If the cause cannot be determined, or if the Contractor’s
 investigation is considered unacceptable to the Engineer, the
 Engineer may require the material to be resampled and retested by
 the Contractor and the Department using the same test methods and
 frequencies as required by the Manual of Field Sampling and
 Testing Procedures. Acceptance of the lot will then be based on the
 new test results. The original test results shall not be used for
 acceptance.
 If the test results of the resampled material fails to correlate, and
 the cause remains undetermined, the Engineer may elect to accept
 the material based upon the uncorrelated results or proceed with
 dispute resolution as provided in Subsection 106.12.
 106.12 Materials Dispute Resolution.
 When either the
 Contractor or the Engineer disputes the other’s acceptance test
 results and cannot resolve the dispute, the party disputing the results
 shall notify the other party in writing that the acceptance test results
 are in dispute. Both parties shall then review the sampling and
 testing procedures with a representative of the Department’s
 Materials Division.
 In the event that the test procedures are revealed as the cause of
 the dispute, the technicians who performed the original test for each
 party will split and test one sample from the disputed sublot. The
 Materials Division representative will observe the testing procedures
 of both technicians. In addition, each party will observe the other’s
 75
 
 106
 testing procedure. The Materials Division will prepare a report of
 the review findings and distribute the report to both parties for their
 information and action. The Contractor and the Department will
 respectively provide training and instruction to the technician who
 has performed improper testing, as identified in the Materials
 Division’s report.
 If the dispute is not resolved, the Materials Division will sample
 and test the material in dispute. The test results obtained by the
 Materials Division will govern over all previous test results. As
 appropriate, the Contractor or the Engineer will take corrective
 action.
 
 SECTION 107
 LEGAL RELATIONS AND
 RESPONSIBILITY TO PUBLIC
 107.01 Laws and Regulations to be Observed. (a) The
 Contractor shall keep fully informed of all Federal and State laws,
 all local laws, ordinances, and regulations, and all orders and decrees
 of bodies or tribunals having any jurisdiction or authority which in
 any manner affect those engaged or employed on the work, or which
 in any way affect the conduct of the work. Further, the Contractor
 shall at all times observe and comply with all such laws, ordinances,
 regulations, quarantines, orders, and decrees; and shall protect and
 indemnify the State and its representatives against any claim or
 liability arising from or based on the violation of any such law,
 ordinance, regulation, order, or decree, whether by the Contractor or
 the Contractor's employees.
 All work pertaining to Electrical, Plumbing, and/or Building

 and control and eradication of Johnson grass. Pursuant to such
 regulations, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Arkansas
 State Plant Board have established certain domestic quarantine areas
 within the State of Arkansas for the purpose of preventing further
 infestation within and beyond these boundaries.
 Soil moving equipment operating within or from regulated areas
 will be subject to plant quarantine regulations. In general, these
 regulations provide for cleaning soil from equipment before it is
 moved from regulated areas.
 It is the Contractor's responsibility to determine from Federal or
 State plant pest control authorities the exact areas under control.
 Any list of regulated areas appearing in the proposal is furnished for
 information purposes only and represents the most recent
 information available to the Department as of the date indicated.
 Prospective bidders should be aware that the list of regulated areas is
 subject to change and they should therefore verify the exact areas
 under control by contacting the Plant Industry Division of the
 Arkansas Plant Board or the Plant Protection Program offices of the
 Arkansas District of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
 (f) If the release of a suspect hazardous substance has occurred,
 the Contractor shall notify the Engineer. This will not relieve the
 Contractor or responsible parties of the obligation to notify other
 appropriate agencies and will not relieve responsible parties of any
 liability.
 Commonly used materials which could be potentially hazardous
 substances if they are spilled or enter waterbodies are: asphalt
 materials, concrete, cement, paint, solvents, petroleum products,
 fertilizers, concrete curing compound, lime, linseed oil, asphalt
 additives, and concrete additives. This list is not all inclusive.
 Notification should be made if, at any time, there is an indication
 of a spill. Indicators could be:
 • Leaking or empty containers, surface staining, chemical
 odors, vegetation damage, etc.
 • Oil, grease or petrochemical substances which produce
 residue, coat the banks and/or bottoms of a waterbody, or
 produce a visible, colored film on the surface.
 78
 
 •
 
 107
 Distinctly visible solids, scum, or foam of a persistent nature,
 or slime, bottom deposits, or sludge banks in a waterbody.
 
 The work involved or the delay or cost incident to compliance
 with these regulations will not be paid for separately, but full
 compensation therefor will be considered included in the contract
 unit prices bid for the various items of the Contract.
 107.02 Permits, Licenses, and Taxes. The Contractor shall
 procure all permits and licenses, pay all charges, fees and taxes, and
 give all notices necessary and incidental to the due and lawful
 prosecution of the work. These costs will not be paid for directly,
 but will be considered included in the contract unit prices bid for the
 various items of the Contract.
 107.03 Patented Devices, Materials, and Processes.
 Contractors employing any design, device, material, or process
 covered by letters of patent or copyright shall provide for such use
 by suitable legal agreement with the patentee or owner. Contractors
 and their Sureties shall indemnify and save harmless the State, any
 affected third party, or political subdivision from any and all claims
 for infringement by reason of the use of any such patented design,
 device, material, or process, or any trademark or copyright, and shall
 indemnify the State for any costs, expenses, and damages that it may
 be obliged to pay by reason of any infringement, at any time during
 the prosecution of or after the completion of the work.
 107.04 Restoration of Surfaces Opened by Permit. The right
 to construct or reconstruct any utility service in the highway or
 street, or to grant permits for such work, at any time, is hereby
 expressly reserved by the Department for the proper authorities of
 the political entity in whose jurisdiction the work is done and the
 Contractor shall not be entitled to any damages either for the digging
 up of the street or for any delay occasioned thereby.
 Any individual, firm, or corporation wishing to make an opening
 in the highway must secure a permit from the Department and
 deposit security in a suitable amount to cover the cost of making the
 necessary repairs. The Contractor shall allow parties bearing such
 permits, and only those parties, to make openings in the highway.
 When ordered by the Engineer, the Contractor shall make in an
 acceptable manner all necessary repairs due to such openings and
 such necessary work will be paid for as extra work, or as provided in
 79
 
 107
 these specifications, and will be subject to the same conditions as
 original work performed.
 107.05 Required Contract Provisions. (a) Federal Aid. When
 the United States Government pays all or any portion of the cost of a
 project, the Federal laws and rules and regulations made pursuant to
 such laws must be observed by the Contractor, and the work shall be
 subject to the inspection of the appropriate Federal Agency.
 Such inspection shall in no sense make the Federal Government a
 party to the Contract and will in no way interfere with the rights of
 either party thereunder.
 (b) Non-Federal Aid.
 (1) Employment Practices.
 a. The Contractor will not discriminate against any
 employee or applicant for employment because of race, color,
 religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin. The Contractor
 will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are
 employed, and that employees are treated during employment
 without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, or
 national origin. Such action shall include, but not be limited to
 the following: Employment, upgrading, demotion, or transfer;
 recruitment advertising; layoffs or termination; rates of pay or
 other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including
 apprenticeship.

 notified by the Contractor of the Contractor’s obligations under
 this contract relative to nondiscrimination on the grounds of race,
 color, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin.
 c. The Contractor shall provide all information and reports
 required by the Department and shall permit access to its books,
 records, accounts, other sources of information, and its facilities
 as may be determined by the Department to be pertinent to
 ascertain compliance with such directives.
 Where any
 information required of a Contractor is in the exclusive
 possession of another who fails or refuses to furnish this
 information, the Contractor shall so certify to the Department and
 shall set forth what efforts have been made by the Contractor to
 obtain the information.
 d. In the event of the Contractor’s noncompliance with the
 nondiscrimination provisions described herein, the Department
 shall impose such contract sanctions as it may be determine to be
 appropriate, including, but not limited to:
 1 . Withholding of payments to the Contractor under the

 Contractor certifies that segregated facilities are not maintained or
 provided for employees at any of its establishments, and that
 employees are not permitted to perform services at any location,
 81
 
 107
 where segregated facilities are maintained. As used in this
 certification, the term “segregated facilities” means any waiting
 rooms, work areas, restrooms and washrooms, restaurants and other
 eating areas, time clocks, locker rooms and other storage or dressing
 areas, parking lots, drinking fountains, recreation or entertainment
 areas, transportation, and housing facilities provided for employees
 which are segregated by explicit directive or are in fact segregated
 on the basis of race, color, religion, age, disability, or national origin,
 because of habit, local custom, or otherwise.
 The
 bidder/subcontractor agrees that, except where identical
 certifications have been obtained from proposed subcontractors and
 material suppliers for specific time periods; identical certification
 will be obtained from subcontractors prior to the award of
 subcontracts.
 (4) Waiver of Certificate of Payments. The requirements for
 certification of payments to DBEs/Non-DBEs, as specified in
 Subsection 103.08(h), are hereby waived and are not required for
 Non-Federal Aid Projects.
 107.06 Sanitary Provisions. The Contractor shall provide and
 maintain in a neat, sanitary condition such accommodations for the
 use of the employees as may be necessary to comply with the
 requirements of the State and local Boards of Health, or of other
 bodies or tribunals having jurisdiction.
 107.07 Public Safety and Convenience. The Contractor's work
 shall at all times be conducted so as to assure the least possible
 obstruction to traffic. The safety and convenience of the general
 public and the residents along the highway and the protection of
 persons and property shall be provided for by the Contractor as
 specified under Subsection 104.05 and Sections 603 and 604, as
 applicable.
 The Contractor will be responsible for maintaining U.S.
 mailboxes within the project limits in such a manner that the public
 may receive continuous mail service according to U.S. Postal
 Service regulations. Unless otherwise provided, upon completion of
 the project, mailboxes will be replaced as near as practicable to their
 original location.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for providing a fence to
 control livestock in areas where pastures are severed or existing
 82
 
 107
 fencing is altered under the Contract. Wire fence may be
 constructed initially, or in lieu thereof, the Contractor, at Contractor
 expense, may elect to provide temporary fencing suitable to contain
 livestock.
 107.08 Railway-Highway Provisions. All work on railroad
 property shall be accomplished in strict compliance with the plans,
 these specifications, and such Special Provisions as are appropriate
 to the Contract.
 All work to be performed by the Contractor in construction on the
 railroad right-of-way shall be performed at such times and in such
 manner as not to unnecessarily interfere with the movement of trains
 or traffic upon the track of the Railway Company. The Contractor
 shall use all care and precaution to avoid accidents, damage, or
 unnecessary delay or interference with the Railway Company's trains
 or other property.
 Plans for all sheeting or cofferdams for foundation work adjacent
 to operated track, and plans of falsework, staging, protective
 sheeting, or other temporary construction near the operated track
 shall be approved by the Railway Company. The Contractor shall
 construct the work according to the approved plans.
 107.09 Work over Navigable Waters or within Regulated
 Floodways. (a) Navigable Waters. All work on navigable water
 shall be so conducted that free navigation of the waterways will not
 be interfered with and that the existing navigable depths will not be
 impaired except as allowed by permit issued by the U.S. Coast
 Guard and/or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (C of E), as
 applicable, and with Section 110.
 (b) Regulated Floodways. All work within regulated floodways
 shall be accomplished within the requirements of all permits issued
 by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), C of E, or
 other applicable agencies, and with Section 110.
 (1) Responsibility for FEMA Permit. Within regulatory
 floodways all permanent and temporary fills/structures must be in
 accordance with FEMA and local governmental requirements.
 The Department obtains all required permits and/or variances for
 essential work in the regulated floodway before the Contract is
 awarded. The Department will apply for Contractor requested
 variances which it determines are necessary. The Contractor
 83
 
 107
 should be aware that requested temporary fills/structures may not
 be approved or may require mitigation.
 (2) Corps of Engineers Section 404 Permit Requirements.
 Placement of temporary fills/structures within a regulatory
 floodway may also require alteration of the existing C of E 404
 Permit described in Section 110. The Contractor should refer to
 Section 110 and the Contract Documents for further details,
 restrictions, and requirements of Section 404 Permits.
 (3) Compensation and Extension of Contract Time. The
 Contractor will not be granted additional compensation or
 contract time due to requested floodway variances that are
 considered by the Engineer to be for the convenience of the
 Contractor. If, however, due to no fault of the Contractor, a
 floodway variance is deemed by the Engineer to be necessary,
 additional contract time and/or compensation may be considered
 according to the provisions of Section 104.
 (c) Contractor’s Permit Conditions. All permits issued to the
 Contractor by the U.S. Coast Guard, C of E, or other applicable
 agencies, for the convenience of the Contractor in accomplishing the
 work, shall be complied with in full and the project will not be
 accepted until the permittor has accepted the work covered by
 permit. The Contractor will be responsible for obtaining a release
 from the permittor before acceptance.
 107.10 Restraining Conditions. (a) General. A "restraining
 condition" is defined as a condition and/or material that is, or can
 reasonably be suspected of being:
 • Archeologically or historically significant.
 • Environmentally sensitive.
 • Hazardous substances or waste.
 (1) Archeologically or historically significant sites may
 contain artifacts or the remains of prehistoric/historic people's
 dwelling sites. The determination of archeological or historical
 significance will be made by the Department in coordination with
 the appropriate authorities.
 (2) Environmentally sensitive conditions include, but are not
 limited to, wetlands, caves, underground streams, and habitats of
 threatened or endangered species.
 84
 
 107
 (3) Hazardous substances or waste are defined as: any
 chemical or biological element, compound, mixture, solution, or
 substance that, when released to the environment, may present
 substantial danger to public health or welfare or to the
 environment.
 Potentially hazardous substance or waste sites may include,
 but are not limited to: tanks, drums, containers, and packages
 (with or without hazardous materials labels), plus any liquids or
 solids not typical in color, odor, or texture to the native soils or
 strata of the site. Any indication that the area was a dump site or
 landfill shall constitute a reason to stop work in that area until a
 determination can be made as to whether hazardous materials
 exist.
 (b) Restraining Conditions Within the Right-of-Way. Known
 restraining conditions within the right-of-way will be shown on the
 plans and any special work requirements in the vicinity of such
 conditions shall be shown on the plans or included in the Contract.
 When any restraining condition not shown on the plans is
 encountered, work in that area will stop and the Engineer shall be
 notified immediately. Work in that area shall not resume until the
 condition has been investigated, a determination made as to the
 disposition of the condition, and clearance to continue has been
 obtained.
 (c) Restraining Conditions Outside of the Right-of-Way.
 (1) Commercially Operated Site. The term "commercially
 operated site" is defined as a pit or quarry from which material is
 obtained that has served the general public for purposes other
 than Department projects for more than one year and has
 furnished materials to the general public for purposes other than
 Department projects during the twelve month period immediately
 preceding the execution of the Contract.
 The Contractor is advised that the owner/operator of the site
 has the responsibility to obtain clearances and ensure compliance
 with all Federal and State laws regarding the above restraining
 conditions.
 (2) Non-commercially Operated Site. The Contractor shall
 notify the Engineer of the location of all proposed off-site
 locations, including borrow pits, waste areas, haul roads,
 85
 
 107
 equipment and materials storage areas, field offices, etc., prior to
 starting any site preparation in these areas. This notification shall
 include detailed information which will enable Department
 personnel to locate the site on the ground, and include a 7.5
 minute topographic quadrangle or equivalent map showing the
 location and limits of the proposed off-site location. The limits
 of the off-site location shall be clearly and visibly flagged for
 easy recognition. Within 10 business days after notification by
 the Contractor, the Department will:
 •
 
 •
 
 •
 
 Investigate for the presence of archeologically or historically
 significant sites.
 If no evidence is found of
 archeological/historical materials during the initial visual
 survey, the site will be conditionally approved, and
 Investigate for the presence of environmentally sensitive
 conditions. If no evidence is found the site will be
 conditionally approved.
 After Restraining Condition conditional approval has been
 given to the Contractor, the Department will provide the
 Contractor with an Endangered Species Clearance. This
 clearance may be used by the Contractor to obtain his
 NPDES Permit for the off right-of-way site.
 
 The Contractor is responsible to carefully investigate off rightof-way sites to ensure the absence of hazardous materials or
 wastes.
 If the site is determined to involve a restraining condition, no
 work in that area will be permitted. Any site preparation prior to
 conditional approval will cause the site to be rejected. The
 Contractor will not be reimbursed for work done prior to
 conditional approval.
 If a restraining condition is discovered the Contractor may, at
 no cost to the Department, acquire approval for use of the site
 from the appropriate authorities. All sites that have been rejected
 because of prior site preparation are ineligible for clearance. All
 clearances or permits obtained by the Contractor regarding the
 dismissal of the restraining conditions shall be submitted to the
 Engineer for approval before site preparation begins.
 If a restraining condition is discovered after operations have
 begun, work in the area of the restraining condition shall stop and
 86
 
 107
 the Engineer shall be notified immediately. Work in that area
 shall not resume until the condition has been investigated, a
 determination made as to the disposition of the condition, and
 clearance to continue has been obtained. If no further work is
 permitted at the site due to the restraining condition, the site shall
 be closed and the area dressed and restored under Sections 106
 and 110 to the extent practicable without interfering with the
 disposition of the condition.
 (d) Contract Adjustments.
 (1) Within the Right-of-Way. Contract adjustments due to
 the discovery on the right-of-way of restraining conditions not
 shown on the plans will be made according to subsection
 104.02(c).
 (2) Outside of the Right-of-Way.
 No
 additional
 compensation or extension of time will be given for delays or
 extra work required resulting from the discovery of restraining
 conditions at commercially operated sites.
 In the event the Contractor has begun using a conditionally
 approved non-commercially operated site and is prevented from
 fully utilizing this site due to the discovery of a restraining
 condition, such conditions will be deemed a differing site
 condition and Contract adjustments will be made according to
 subsection 104.02(c).
 (e) Protection of Sensitive Areas. Any area identified by the
 Department as containing a restraining condition which is adjacent
 to or within an approved site must be clearly marked and protected
 by the Contractor from any vehicle or equipment encroachment.
 Department personnel will establish the limits of the restraining
 condition area. The Contractor, at Contractor expense, will mark
 and maintain the limits of the restraining condition area using
 flagging, stakes, or other appropriate devices to clearly indicate that
 the area is to be protected. The Contractor will be responsible for
 any damages to the area containing the restraining condition as
 provided in Subsection 107.12.
 107.11 Use of Explosives. When the use of explosives is
 necessary for the prosecution of the work, the Contractor shall
 exercise the utmost care not to endanger life or property, including
 new work. The Contractor shall comply with all laws and
 87
 
 107
 ordinances regarding the use of explosives; further, the Contractor
 shall be responsible for all damage resulting from the use of
 explosives.
 All explosives shall be stored in a secure manner in compliance
 with all laws and ordinances, and all such storage places shall be
 clearly marked. Where no local laws or ordinances apply, storage
 shall be provided satisfactory to the Engineer and in accordance with
 the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970,
 29 USC § 651 et seq., and the Safety and Health Regulations for
 Construction promulgated thereunder, but not closer than 1,000'
 (300 m) from the road or from any building or camping area or place
 of human occupancy.
 The Contractor shall notify each public utility company having
 structures in proximity to the site of the work of any intention to use
 explosives. Such notice shall be given sufficiently in advance to
 enable the companies to take such steps as they may deem necessary
 to protect their property from injury.
 107.12 Protection and Restoration of Property and
 Landscape.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for the
 preservation of all public and private property and shall protect
 carefully from disturbance or damage all land monuments and
 property marks until the Engineer has witnessed or otherwise
 referenced their location, and shall not move them until directed.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for all damage or injury to
 property of any character: 1) during the prosecution of the work,
 resulting from any act, omission, neglect, or misconduct in the
 manner or method of executing the work, or 2) at any time, due to
 defective work or materials, and said responsibility will not be
 released until the project has been completed and accepted.
 Property shall include but not be limited to street and roadway
 signs, right-of-way monuments, roadway lighting, traffic signal
 equipment, and any conduits and wiring. Should it become evident
 that any item, such as listed above, is in conflict with the proposed
 work, the Contractor will notify the Engineer so that proper steps
 can be taken to adjust, remove, or otherwise eliminate the conflict.
 On projects where the Department has monumented the right-ofway before the start of construction operations, it shall be the
 responsibility of the Contractor to protect such right-of-way or land
 88
 
 107
 monuments from disturbance during the construction period. The
 term "right-of-way or land monument" shall include the actual
 monument; stakes, pins, nails, or other devices marking the location
 of the monument; and witness markers associated with the
 monument. Any and all such monuments disturbed by the
 Contractor's operations will be reestablished by the Department. An
 immediate deduction of $300 for each monument disturbed by the
 Contractor's operations will be made on the next progress estimate
 after the discovery of the damage.
 If the Department has completed installation of all monuments
 and filed the appropriate plat before the disturbance of any
 monument, the Contractor may, at Contractor option and in lieu of
 restoration by the Department, have the monuments restored by a
 Professional Surveyor at the Contractor's expense. The monument
 will be reset using current AHTD property and right of way
 monumenting procedures and shall include the Professional
 Surveyor’s number on the monument cap. A plat shall be prepared
 by the Professional Surveyor for documentation of such replacement
 or restoration. The plat shall comply with the current requirements
 of the Arkansas Minimum Standards for Property Boundary Surveys
 and Plats and approved by the Surveys Division of AHTD. The plat
 shall be filed with the State Land Surveyor’s Office and a copy of
 the filed plat, including the State Land Surveys Office document
 number, shall be furnished to the Department. The deduction of
 $300 per monument will be made as specified above and re-paid
 after completion of the requirements of this paragraph.
 The Contractor shall not create a public nuisance while
 performing the various operations of the work. Excessive noise
 between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., and dust from haul roads,
 County roads, or State roads may be considered by the Engineer to
 be a public nuisance.
 When or where any direct or indirect damage or injury is done to
 public or private property by or as a result of any act, omission,
 neglect, or misconduct in the execution of the work, or in
 consequence of the nonexecution thereof, the Contractor shall
 restore, or bear the expense of restoring, such property to a condition
 similar or equal to that existing before such damage or injury was
 done, by repairing, rebuilding, or otherwise restoring as may be
 directed, or shall make good such damage or injury in an acceptable
 89
 
 107
 manner. Failure to do so within a reasonable period of time will
 constitute noncompliance, and the Engineer may cause the entire
 cost of the restoration to be deducted from moneys due or to become
 due the Contractor on the Contract.
 107.13 Forest Protection. When working within or adjacent to a
 State or National Forest, the Contractor shall comply with all
 regulations concerning the protection of forests. The Contractor and
 all subcontractors shall take all reasonable precautions to prevent
 forest fires and shall provide reasonable aid in the suppression of
 forest fires. The size and location of all fires seen or otherwise
 detected by the Contractor's personnel shall be reported immediately
 to the Engineer and/or the nearest Forest official.
 107.14 Responsibility for Damage Claims. The Contractor
 shall indemnify and save harmless the Department and its officers
 and employees from all suits, actions, or claims of any character
 brought because of any injuries or damage received or sustained by
 any person, persons, or property on account of the operations of the
 Contractor; or on account of or in consequence of any neglect in
 safeguarding the work; or through use of unacceptable materials in
 constructing the work; or because of any act or omission, neglect, or
 misconduct of the Contractor; or because of any claims or amounts
 recovered from any infringement of patent, trademark, or copyright;
 or from any claims or amounts arising or recovered under the
 "Workman's Compensation Act," or any other law, ordinance, order,
 or decree; and so much of the money due the Contractor under and
 by virtue of the Contract as may be considered necessary by the
 Department for such purpose may be retained for the use of the
 Department; or in case no money is due, the Surety may be held until
 such suit or suits, action or actions, claim or claims for injuries or
 damages as aforesaid shall have been settled and suitable evidence to
 that effect furnished to the Department; except that money due the
 Contractor will not be withheld when the Contractor produces
 satisfactory evidence that adequate protection is provided by public
 liability and property damage insurance.
 It is specifically agreed between the parties executing the
 Contract that it is not intended by any of the provisions of any part
 of the Contract to create the public or any member thereof a third
 party beneficiary thereunder, or to authorize anyone not a party to
 90
 
 107
 the Contract to maintain a suit for personal injuries or property
 damage pursuant to the terms or provisions of the Contract.
 107.15 Opening Section of Highway to Traffic. Whenever any
 roadway, or portion thereof, is in an acceptable condition for travel,
 it shall be opened to traffic, as may be directed, and such opening
 shall not be held to be in any way an acceptance of the roadway, or
 any part of it, or as a waiver of any of the provisions of these
 specifications and the Contract. Necessary repairs or renewals made
 on any section of the roadway opened to travel under instructions
 from the Engineer, due to defective material or work, or to natural
 causes, other than normal wear and tear, pending completion and
 acceptance of the roadway, shall be performed at no cost to the
 Department.
 If the Contractor is dilatory in completing shoulders, drainage
 structures, or other features of the work, the Engineer may give
 notification in writing and establish therein a reasonable period of
 time in which the work should be completed. If the Contractor is
 dilatory or fails to make a reasonable effort toward completion in
 this period of time, the Engineer may take action as provided in
 subsection 105.01. On such sections that are so ordered to be
 opened, the Contractor shall conduct the remaining construction
 operations so as to cause the least obstruction to traffic and shall not
 receive any added compensation due to the added cost of the work
 by reason of opening such section to traffic.
 107.16 Contractor's Responsibility for Work. Until final
 acceptance of the project by the Engineer, the Contractor shall have
 the charge and care thereof and shall take every precaution against
 injury, theft, or damage to any part thereof by the action of the
 elements or from any other cause, whether arising from the
 execution or from the nonexecution of the work. The Contractor
 shall rebuild, repair, restore, and make good all injuries, thefts, or
 damages to any portion of the work occasioned by any of the above
 causes before final acceptance, and shall bear the expense thereof
 except damage to the work due to unforeseeable causes beyond the
 control of and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor,
 including but not restricted to acts of God, of the public enemy, or of
 governmental authorities.
 
 91
 
 107
 In case of suspension of work from any cause whatever, the
 Contractor shall be responsible for the project and shall take such
 precautions as may be necessary to prevent damage to the project,
 provide for normal drainage and maintenance of the traveled way,
 and shall erect any necessary temporary structures, signs, or other
 facilities. During such period of suspension of work, the Contractor
 shall properly and continuously maintain in an acceptable growing
 condition all living material in newly established plantings, seedings,
 and soddings furnished under the Contract, and shall take adequate
 precautions to protect new tree growth and other important
 vegetative growth against injury.
 The protection of the work shall be accomplished at no cost to the
 Department except for the work required to maintain the traveled
 way.
 In case of errors or negligence on the part of the Contractor, any
 expenses incurred by the Department for engineering, inspection,
 testing, design, or evaluation relative to correction of the work will
 be assessed against the Contractor.
 107.17 Contractor's Responsibility for Utility Facilities and
 Services. At points where the Contractor's operations are adjacent
 to railroad or utility facilities, damage to which may result in loss or
 inconvenience, work shall not begin until all arrangements necessary
 for the protection thereof have been made.
 The Contractor shall cooperate with the owners of any utility
 facilities in their removal and rearrangement operations so that these
 operations may progress in a reasonable manner, that duplication of
 rearrangement work may be reduced to a minimum, and that services
 rendered by those parties will not be unnecessarily interrupted.
 In the event of interruption of utility services, as a result of
 accidental breakage or as a result of being exposed or unsupported,
 the Contractor shall promptly notify the proper authority and shall
 cooperate with the said authority in the restoration of service. If
 utility service is interrupted, repair work shall be continuous until
 the service is restored. No work shall be undertaken around fire
 hydrants until provisions for continued service have been approved
 by the local fire authority.
 107.18 Furnishing Right-of-Way.
 The Department is
 responsible for the securing of all necessary rights of way in advance
 92
 
 107
 of construction within the limits indicated on the plans. Acquisition
 of right-of-way by the Department does not include areas required
 by the Contractor for material sources (borrow, gravel, topsoil, sod,
 etc.), plant sites, equipment storage, stockpiles, disposal of waste or
 excess material, or any other areas required for the proper
 prosecution of the work. The Contractor is responsible for
 obtaining, at no cost to the Department, areas outside the right-ofway required for such purposes and shall, at the Engineer's request,
 furnish copies of agreements with the property owners. The
 Contractor may, with the approval of the Engineer, use areas within
 the right-of-way that are outside the construction limits for these
 purposes. Erosion control, prevention of water pollution, and
 restoration of all such areas, both inside and outside the right-ofway, shall be performed by the Contractor according to the
 specifications and at no cost to the Department.
 107.19 Personal Liability of Public Officials. In carrying out
 any of the provisions of these specifications, or in exercising any
 power or authority granted to them by or within the scope of the
 Contract, there shall be no liability upon the Commission, Engineer,
 or their authorized representatives, either personally or as officials of
 the Department, it being understood that in all such matters they act
 solely as agents and representatives of the Department.
 107.20 No Waiver of Legal Rights. Final acceptance according
 to subsection 105.17(b) shall not preclude or estop the Department
 from correcting any measurement, estimate, or certificate made
 before or after completion of the work, nor shall the Department be
 precluded or estopped from recovering from the Contractor or the
 Surety, or both, such overpayment as it may sustain, or by failure on
 the part of the Contractor to fulfill obligations under the Contract. A
 waiver on the part of the Department of any breach of any part of the
 Contract shall not be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent
 breach.
 The Contractor, without prejudice to the terms of the Contract,
 shall be liable to the Department for any or all of the following:
 fraud or such gross mistakes as may amount to fraud, the
 Department's rights under any warranty or guaranty, or any latent
 defects in the work.
 
 93
 
 108
 
 SECTION 108
 PROSECUTION AND PROGRESS
 108.01 Subletting of Contract.
 The Contractor will be
 permitted to sublet a portion of the Contract, except that work
 amounting to not less than 30% of the total Contract amount (based
 on the Contract unit prices) must be performed by the Contractor's
 organization. No subcontractor shall further subcontract any portion
 of the work without the written consent of the Contractor and
 acknowledgment of the Engineer. If consent and acknowledgment
 are given, the first tier subcontractor may further subcontract a
 portion of his work not to exceed 70% of the work originally
 subcontracted to him by the Contractor. Second tier subcontractors
 will not be permitted to subcontract any portion of the work. No
 subcontracts, or transfer of contract, shall in any case release the
 Contractor of liability under the Contract and bond.
 The Contractor shall submit and file with the Engineer a signed
 copy of each subcontract. No work may be performed by a proposed
 subcontractor until the Contractor has received acknowledgment by
 the Engineer.
 It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to determine that all
 parties performing work amounting to $20,000 or more are currently
 licensed by the Contractors Licensing Board for the State of
 Arkansas.
 The Contractor shall pay all subcontractors their respective
 subcontract amount within 10 calendar days after the Contractor
 receives payment from the Department. The payment amount shall
 be according to the terms of the subcontract, except that the
 Contractor shall not require or withhold a retainage in excess of 10%
 of the amount due to the subcontractor. Amounts withheld as
 retainage from subcontractors must be returned within thirty
 calendar days after the subcontractor’s work is satisfactorily
 completed, whether the Contractor’s work is complete or not. The
 term “satisfactorily completed” for the purpose of this prompt return
 of retainage provision is defined as when; 1) the subcontractor’s
 work is completed in accordance with the plans and specifications,
 2) all required paperwork, including material certifications, payrolls,
 etc., has been received and approved by the Engineer; 3) the
 94
 
 108
 subcontractor does not have past due balances with suppliers for
 work associated with the project; and 4) the Engineer has
 determined the final quantities for the subcontractor’s portion of the
 work. Delay or postponement of payment to a subcontractor may
 only be effected after the Contractor has established good cause and
 received written approval from the Engineer. If the Contractor fails
 to pay the subcontractors within the required periods, all or any
 portion of subsequent payments due the Contractor may be withheld
 by the Engineer.
 In addition to the allowable retainage specified above, the
 Contractor may withhold from payments due to the subcontractor
 amounts owed by the subcontractor to the Contractor for items on
 the Contract. Payments to subcontractors in the form of joint checks
 made payable to the subcontractor and any other party shall be
 documented either in the approved subcontract or by a separate
 written agreement between the Contractor and the subcontractor. No
 other deductions from the full amount due will be allowed.
 Contractors must include in their subcontract agreements notice
 to subcontractors of their right to prompt payment and return of
 retainage, and provisions that require the subcontractor to pay
 second tier subcontractors as provided above, with the same
 restrictions on retainage.
 108.02 Prosecution of Work. (a) Preconstruction Conference.
 A preconstruction conference, when applicable, will be held for each
 contract as soon as possible after the execution of the Contract and
 generally before the work begins. The Engineer will notify the
 Contractor, utility companies, and other interested parties of the date
 and place for the conference.
 (b) Work Order. The following shall apply to the various work
 orders applicable to the prosecution of the work:
 (1) Except as provided herein, no work shall be performed
 under the Contract until the Engineer has issued a Work Order.
 The Contractor shall notify the Engineer of intent to begin
 work at least 72 hours before work is begun.
 (2) The delivery to the Department for execution of the
 Contract and bonds properly executed on behalf of the Contractor
 and surety and the minimum 72 hours advance notice as required
 95
 
 108
 above shall constitute the Contractor's authority to begin the
 following items of work:
 •
 •
 •
 •
 •
 •
 
 Mobilization;
 Preparation of shop drawings and other required
 submissions;
 Ordering, fabrication, assembly, and/or stockpiling of
 materials;
 Driving Test Piling; and
 Contract surveying, when Roadway and/or Bridge
 Construction Control is included in the Contract.
 Erection of advance warning signs.
 
 Such advance work shall be subject to the Contractor's
 assumption of the risk of cancellation of the award and the
 following:
 • The Contractor shall, on commencing such operations, take
 all precautions required for public safety and shall observe
 all the provisions in the Contract;
 • In the event of cancellation of the award, the Contractor shall
 at Contractor expense do such work as necessary to leave the
 site in a neat condition to the satisfaction of the Engineer;
 • In the event of cancellation of the award, all work performed
 shall be deemed to be at the Contractor's expense; and
 • All work done under this subsection in accordance with the
 Contract before its execution by the Commission will, when
 the Contract is executed, be considered authorized work and
 will be paid for as provided in the Contract.
 Unless otherwise notified in writing, no time will be assessed
 for work performed prior to the effective date of a Work Order.
 No payments will be made prior to the date established by the
 Engineer under Subsection 109.07, which date will be after the
 effective date of a Work Order.
 The Contractor shall not be entitled to any additional
 compensation or an extension of time for any delay, hindrance, or
 interference caused by or attributable to commencement of work
 before the effective date of a Work Order.
 (3) Partial Work Order. A Partial Work Order may be
 issued which will describe the specific items and/or limits of
 96
 
 108
 work to be performed under the Partial Work Order. Assessment
 of contract time will be as described in the Work Order and
 payment will be made according to Section 109.
 (4) Full Work Order.
 a.
 Fixed Completion Date Contract. Unless the
 Contractor is otherwise advised in writing, the Work Order
 for a fixed completion date contract shall become effective
 on the day following the execution of the Contract by the
 Department. Should the effective date fall on Saturday,
 Sunday, a legal holiday designated in Subsection 101.01(c),
 Monday following a holiday on Sunday, or Friday
 preceding a holiday on Saturday, the effective date shall be
 the next work day. The written Work Order from the
 Engineer will follow with the effective date being as
 specified.
 b.
 Working Day Contract. Unless the Contractor is
 otherwise advised in writing, the Work Order for a working
 day contract shall become effective on the fifteenth
 calendar day following the execution of the Contract by the
 Department. Should the effective date fall on Saturday,
 Sunday, a legal holiday designated in Subsection 101.01(c),
 Monday following a holiday on Sunday, or Friday
 preceding a holiday on Saturday, the effective date shall be
 the next work day. The written Work Order from the
 Engineer will follow with the effective date being as
 specified. No time will be assessed for any work performed
 including erection of traffic control devices during the
 10 calendar day period following the effective date of the
 Work Order. The assessment of contract time, according to
 Subsection 108.06, will begin on the eleventh calendar day
 following the effective date of the Work Order.
 Except as specified in 108.02(b)(2) above, no work of any
 type, including the erection of traffic control devices, shall begin
 before the effective date of the Work Order.
 (c) The Contractor shall begin the work to be performed under the
 Contract not later than 10 calendar days after the effective date of
 the Work Order. If the Contractor is unable to begin the work within
 this time period, the Engineer shall be so notified in writing. Unless
 97
 
 108
 the Engineer gives written approval for the delay in beginning the
 work, contract time will be assessed according to Subsection 108.06.
 (d) The Department allocates its resources to a contract based on
 the total time allowed in the Contract. The Contractor may propose
 an accelerated work schedule indicating an early completion date;
 however, the Department cannot guarantee the Department's
 resources will be available to meet the accelerated schedule. No
 additional compensation or extension of time will be allowed if the
 Contractor is unable to meet the accelerated schedule due to the
 unavailability of the Department's resources or for other reasons
 beyond the Department's control.
 108.03 Limitation of Operations. The Contractor shall conduct
 the work at all times in such a manner and in such sequence as will
 assure the least interference with traffic. Due regard shall be given
 to the location of detours and to the provisions for handling traffic.
 No work shall be opened up to the prejudice or detriment of work
 already started. The Engineer may require the Contractor to finish a
 section on which work is in progress before work is started on any
 additional sections if the opening of such section is essential to
 public convenience.
 108.04 Character of Workers, Methods, and Equipment. The
 Contractor shall at all times employ sufficient labor and equipment
 for prosecuting the several classes of work to full completion in the
 manner and time required by these specifications.
 All workers shall have sufficient skill and experience to perform
 properly the work assigned to them. Workers engaged in special
 work or skilled work shall have sufficient experience in such work
 and in the operation of the equipment required to perform all work
 properly and satisfactorily.
 Any person employed by the Contractor or by any subcontractor
 who, in the opinion of the Engineer, does not perform work in a
 proper and skillful manner, or is intemperate or disorderly shall, at
 the written request of the Engineer, be removed forthwith by the
 Contractor or subcontractor employing such person, and shall not be
 employed again in any portion of the work without the approval of
 the Engineer.
 Should the Contractor fail to remove such person or persons as
 required above, or fail to furnish suitable and sufficient personnel for
 98
 
 108
 the proper prosecution of the work, the Engineer may suspend the
 work by written notice and withhold moneys due until such orders
 are complied with.
 All equipment that is proposed to be used on the work shall be of
 sufficient size and in such mechanical condition as to meet
 requirements of the work and to produce a satisfactory quality of
 work. Equipment used on any portion of the project shall be such
 that no injury to the roadway, adjacent property, or other highways
 will result from its use.
 When the methods and equipment to be used by the Contractor in
 accomplishing the construction are not prescribed in the Contract,
 the Contractor is free to use any methods or equipment that are
 demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Engineer as being capable of
 accomplishing the Contract work in conformity with the
 requirements of the Contract.
 When the Contract specifies that the construction be performed
 by using certain methods and/or equipment, such methods and/or
 equipment shall be used unless others are authorized by the
 Engineer. If the Contractor desires to use a method or type of
 equipment other than those specified in the Contract, authority from
 the Engineer to do so must be requested. The request shall be in
 writing and shall include a full description of the methods and
 equipment proposed to be used and an explanation of the reasons for
 desiring to make the change. If approval is given, it will be on the
 condition that the Contractor will be fully responsible for producing
 work in conformity with contract requirements. If, after trial use of
 the substituted methods or equipment, the Engineer determines that
 the work produced does not meet contract requirements, the
 Contractor shall discontinue the use of the substitute method or
 equipment and shall complete the remaining construction with the
 specified methods and equipment. The Contractor shall remove the
 deficient work and replace it with work of specified quality, or take
 such other corrective action as the Engineer may direct. No change
 will be made in basis of payment for the construction items involved
 nor in contract time as a result of an authorized change in methods
 or equipment under these provisions.
 108.05 Temporary Suspension of Work. The Engineer will
 have the authority to suspend the work wholly or in part for such
 period or periods necessary, due to unsuitable weather or other
 99
 
 108
 conditions unfavorable for the suitable prosecution of the work. If it
 should become necessary to stop work for an indefinite period, the
 Contractor shall store all materials in such manner that they will not
 obstruct or impede the traveling public nor become damaged in any
 way, and shall take every reasonable precaution to prevent damage
 or deterioration of the work performed; provide suitable drainage of
 the roadway by opening ditches and shoulder drains; maintain the
 traveled way; erect temporary structures where directed; etc.
 The Contractor shall not suspend the work nor remove any
 equipment or materials essential to the completion of the current
 phase of the project without the permission of the Engineer.
 If the performance of all or any portion of the work is suspended
 or delayed by the Engineer in writing for a period of time not
 originally anticipated, customary, or inherent to the construction
 industry and the Contractor believes that additional compensation
 and/or contract time is due as a result of such suspension or delay,
 the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer in writing a request for
 adjustment within ten (10) business days of the receipt of the notice
 to resume work. The request shall set forth the reasons and support
 for such adjustment.
 Upon receipt, the Engineer will evaluate the Contractor's request.
 If the Engineer agrees that the cost and/or time required for the
 performance of the Contract has increased as a result of such
 suspension and the suspension was caused by conditions beyond the
 control of and not the fault of the Contractor, its suppliers, or
 subcontractors at any approved tier, and not caused by weather, the
 Engineer will make an adjustment (excluding profit) and modify the
 Contract in writing accordingly. The Engineer will notify the
 Contractor of a determination whether or not an adjustment of the
 Contract is warranted.
 No Contract adjustment will be allowed unless the Contractor has
 submitted the request for adjustment within the time prescribed.
 No Contract adjustment will be allowed under this clause to the
 extent that performance would have been suspended or delayed by
 any other cause, or for which an adjustment is provided for or
 excluded under any other term or condition of the Contract.
 108.06 Determination of Time of Completion and Extension
 of Contract Time. (a) General.
 The time allowed for the
 100
 
 108
 completion of the work included in the Contract will be stated in the
 proposal and Contract, and will be known as the "Contract Time".
 The contract time will be specified as a fixed completion date or as
 working days.
 The Contractor shall provide sufficient materials, equipment, and
 labor to guarantee the completion of the project according to the
 plans and specifications within the contract time. The Contractor
 shall advance the work so that the available time is appropriately
 utilized in order to complete the work within the contract time.
 Unless an emergency is declared, the Contractor shall not perform
 work that requires inspection on Sundays or legal holidays
 designated in Subsection 101.01(c) and the actual holiday if it falls
 on a Saturday or Sunday. If the Commission declares Friday
 following Thanksgiving Day as a Departmental holiday, the
 Contractor shall not perform work that requires inspection.
 No claim for an extension of time will be considered as a result of
 failure of the Engineer to furnish interpretations of the plans and
 specifications until 30 calendar days after receipt of such demand in
 writing as required by Subsection 105.01, and not then unless such
 request for an interpretation is reasonable and made in good faith.
 The Engineer will determine the date upon which the Contract is
 substantially complete and time assessment will cease. In the event
 cleanup is necessary or items found at the final inspection are to be
 corrected, the Contractor shall complete this work in a timely
 manner or the Engineer will resume time charges.
 (b) Fixed Completion Date. When the contract time is specified
 as a fixed date, it will be the date on which all work on the project
 shall be substantially complete. The Contractor shall take into
 consideration all normal conditions considered unfavorable to the
 normal progress of the work and place a sufficient work force and
 equipment on the project to ensure completion of the work within
 the contract time. Inaccessibility to a portion of the work due to
 utility conflict or utility work, either of which prevents effective
 utilization of 60% of normal forces and equipment for at least 60%
 of the Contractor's normal work hours, will be considered as an
 adverse working condition for time exceeding that specified in the
 Contract for the utility adjustment.
 101
 
 108
 (c) Working Days. When the contract time is specified in
 working days, time will be assessed for each day on which, in the
 judgement of the Engineer and subject to the limitations below,
 conditions allow the Contractor to effectively utilize 60% of normal
 forces and equipment to prosecute the work required at that time, for
 at least 60% of the Contractor's normal work hours, regardless of
 whether the Contractor actually works.
 The Engineer will not assess a working day when conditions exist
 beyond the control and without the fault of the Contractor that
 prevent the utilization of forces and equipment as defined above.
 Also, for the purpose of assessment of working days, inaccessibility
 to a portion of the work due to utility conflict or utility work, either
 of which prevents utilization of forces and equipment as defined
 above, will be considered as an adverse working condition for time
 exceeding that specified in the Contract for the utility adjustment.
 The ability of vendors, suppliers, and subcontractors to provide
 materials and/or services is considered within the Contractor's
 control for the purpose of assessment of working days.
 Should the Contractor prepare to begin work on any day on which
 inclement weather, or the conditions resulting from the weather,
 prevent the work from beginning at the usual starting time, and the
 crew is dismissed as a result, the Contractor will not be charged for a
 working day whether or not conditions change during the day and
 the rest of the day becomes suitable for construction operations.
 Time from December 21 through March 15, inclusive, will not be
 assessed against the contract time.
 Saturdays and Department recognized holidays, other than those
 designated above, which may be declared by the Department for
 certain special or unusual circumstances, will be optional to the
 Contractor as working days, and time will not be assessed unless
 work is performed that requires inspection. If work is performed,
 contract time assessment will be based upon the same conditions as
 a normal working day.
 Contract time will be assessed during a Partial Work Order period
 according to Subsection 108.02(b)(3).
 Contract time will not be assessed during a full suspension of the
 work as ordered by the Engineer. During a partial suspension of the
 work as ordered by the Engineer, the contract time will be assessed
 102
 
 108
 in direct proportion to the ratio of the money value of the items not
 suspended to the total contract amount.
 At the end of each estimate period, the Engineer will furnish the
 Contractor a written statement showing each working day charged
 during the preceding period and the total number of working days
 charged to date. If the Contractor disagrees with the working days
 charged by the Engineer, then the Contractor shall, within
 10 calendar days after receipt of the statement, give the Engineer
 written notice of such disagreement and the reasons therefor.
 Subsequent handling of this dispute shall be according to
 Subsection 105.01. If the Contractor fails to protest the Engineer's
 determination of working days charged within the 10 calendar day
 period, the Contractor shall be deemed to have accepted the time
 charged for that period as correct and no subsequent request for
 review will be considered.
 (d) Extension of Contract Time. If the Contractor is unable to
 complete the work within the contract time as specified, at any time
 prior to the final acceptance of the project, a written request may be
 made to the Engineer for an extension of time. This request must
 contain specific dates and the detailed circumstances relative to the
 time extension desired. The Contractor's contention that insufficient
 time was specified is not a valid reason for an extension of time.
 All extensions of time, except extensions due to overruns, will be
 documented by Change Order.
 Any extended time for completion shall be in full force and effect
 the same as though it were the original contract time.
 (1) An extension of time will be granted:
 a. On fixed completion date projects, if the Work Order
 is not issued within 30 calendar days after the execution of
 the Contract. An extension of time will be given based on
 the number of days delayed beyond the 30 calendar days.
 b. On fixed completion date projects, for time elapsing
 between the effective dates of any order from the Engineer
 for a complete or partial suspension of the work, when such
 suspension is due to no fault of the Contractor. Days
 assessed during a partial suspension period will be
 determined by dividing the money value of the work
 103
 
 108
 performed during the partial suspension period by the
 money value of one day. The money value of one day will
 be based on the ratio of the total contract amount to the
 number of calendar days from the date of the work order
 through the fixed calendar date stipulated in the Contract,
 both dates inclusive.
 c. On fixed completion date projects, if the total dollar
 value of accumulated current estimates or the final
 estimate, exclusive of incentives and disincentives,
 exceeds the dollar value of the total contract bid, the
 completion date will be extended by the number of calendar
 days obtained by multiplying the contract time as set forth
 in the Contract by that percentage that the dollar value of
 the estimate exceeds the dollar value of the total contract
 bid. When this occurs, the extension of time will be based
 upon the number of calendar days from the date of the work
 order through the fixed calendar date stipulated in the
 Contract, both dates inclusive.
 d. On jobs on which time is specified in working days,
 the contract time will be increased in the same proportion
 that the total dollar value, exclusive of incentives and
 disincentives, exceeds the total contract bid.
 (2) An extension of time will be considered, based upon
 documented evidence submitted by the Contractor, if:
 a. The Contract requires the furnishing of critical
 materials and the Contractor experiences a delay in delivery
 because of Federal priorities for defense needs or because
 of nationwide shortages. Additional contract time may be
 allowed in an amount equal to the actual lost time resulting
 from such delay. To obtain additional contract time, the
 Contractor shall document and file with the Engineer all
 evidence pertaining to the original agreement with the
 material supplier or manufacturer. This evidence must
 indicate that delivery would be made at or before the time
 the materials would be needed in the normal sequence of
 construction operations for incorporation in the work. In
 the event that no prior agreement has been made for
 furnishing a critical material, and the Contractor is unable

 to locate a supplier or manufacturer that can deliver the
 material when needed, the Engineer shall be advised of this
 situation in writing, indicating the date that delivery will be
 made and the date of the original request for such material.
 In either of these situations, when work has progressed to
 the point that critical materials not delivered are delaying
 progress of the project, the Contractor may make a written
 request to the Engineer for additional contract time.
 b. The work has been delayed by any act or omission of
 the Commission.
 c. Preparatory work to be performed by the Owner or by
 others specified in the Contract has not been accomplished
 and the delay is not the fault of the Contractor.
 d. Weather conditions or the condition of the ground or
 materials were significantly abnormal and these conditions
 significantly delayed the work. For consideration of a time
 extension based on weather conditions, the Contractor shall
 submit, in writing, documented evidence of the conditions
 that existed for the specific days requested. The Engineer
 will verify the validity of the request.
 e. Change Orders involve extra work and the time
 needed to complete this extra work would exceed the
 normal time extension as a result of overruns, based on
 money value, the completion date may be extended by
 Change Order to provide for this difference.
 f. It is determined that anticipated time extensions due to
 overruns did not materialize due to underruns in other
 items.
 g. The work was delayed because of conditions not
 described herein that were beyond the control and without
 fault of the Contractor.
 108.07 Failure to Complete Work on Time. Time is an
 essential element of the Contract and it is important that the work be
 pressed vigorously to completion. The cost to the Department of the
 administration of the Contract, including engineering, inspection,
 and supervision, will be increased as the time occupied in the work
 105
 
 108
 is lengthened. Loss will accrue to the public due to delayed
 completion of the contemplated facility.
 For each calendar day or working day, as specified, that work
 remains uncompleted after the contract time has expired, the sum
 specified in the proposal and Contract will be deducted from any
 money due the Contractor, not as a penalty, but as liquidated
 damages.
 Should the amount otherwise due the Contractor be less than the
 amount of such liquidated damages, the Contractor and the Surety
 shall be liable to the Department for such deficiency.
 Permitting the Contractor to continue and finish the work or any
 part of it after the time fixed for its completion, or after the date to
 which the time for completion may have been extended, will in no
 way operate as a waiver on the part of the Department of any of its
 rights under the Contract.
 108.08 Default and Termination of Contract. The Engineer
 will give written notice of delay, neglect, or default to both the
 Contractor and the Surety if the Contractor:
 (a) Fails to begin the work under the Contract within the time
 specified in the Work Order, or
 (b) Fails to perform the work with sufficient workers, equipment,
 or materials to assure prompt completion of the work, or
 (c) Performs the work negligently or unsuitably or neglects or
 refuses to remove materials or to perform anew such work as may be
 rejected as unacceptable or unsuitable, or
 (d) Discontinues the prosecution of the work, or
 (e) Fails to resume work that has been discontinued within 10
 calendar days after notice to do so, or
 (f) Becomes insolvent or is declared bankrupt, or commits any act
 of bankruptcy or insolvency, or fails to provide a replacement bond
 within 10 calendar days, containing all the guarantees of the original
 bond, if the Surety should be declared in default and/or liquidation,
 or
 (g) Fails to settle all valid claims for materials, labor, or supplies
 in an expedient manner, or
 106
 
 108
 (h) Allows any final judgment to stand unsatisfied for a period of
 10 calendar days, or
 (i) Makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or
 (j) Fails to refund any moneys due the Commission due to errors
 in determining pay quantities for estimates within 30 calendar days,
 or
 (k) Fails to appropriately cooperate with the Department, the
 public, or others associated with the work or to provide proper
 superintendence of the work, or
 (l) Fails to comply with contract requirements, or
 (m) Is a party to fraud, or
 (n) For any other cause whatsoever, fails to carry on the work in a
 manner acceptable to the Department.
 If the Contractor or Surety, within a period of 10 calendar days
 after written notice from the Engineer, does not proceed according to
 the notice, the Commission will, upon written notification from the
 Engineer of the facts relative to delay, neglect, or default, and the
 Contractor's failure to comply with the written notice, have full
 power and authority, without violating the Contract, to take the
 prosecution of the work out of the hands of the Contractor. The
 Commission may appropriate or use any or all materials and
 equipment associated with the project as may be suitable and
 acceptable and may enter into an agreement for the completion of
 the Contract according to the terms and provisions thereof, or use
 such other methods as in the opinion of the Engineer will be
 required for the completion of the Contract.
 All costs and charges incurred by the Commission due to any of
 the above will be deducted from any moneys due or which may
 become due the Contractor. If such expense exceeds the sum that
 would have been payable under the Contract, the Contractor and the
 Surety shall be liable and shall pay to the Commission the amount of
 such excess. Such charges shall include but not be limited to the
 cost of completing a part or all of the work under the Contract, for
 calculating and collecting any compensating taxes due under Ark.
 Code Ann. §26-53-201 et seq. and Ark. Code Ann. §17-22-401 et
 seq. (formerly Act 125 of 1965), and for the collection of any
 overpayments due the Commission.
 107
 
 108
 The Department may, by written order, terminate the Contract or
 any portion thereof after determining that for reasons beyond either
 Department or Contractor control the Contractor is prevented from
 proceeding with or completing the work as originally contracted for,
 and that termination would be in the public interest. Reasons for
 termination may include, but need not be necessarily limited to:
 executive orders of the President relating to prosecution of war or
 national defense; national emergency that creates a serious shortage
 of materials; orders from duly constituted authorities relating to
 energy conservation; and restraining orders or injunctions obtained
 by third-party citizen action resulting from national or local
 environmental protection laws or where the issuance of such order or
 injunction is primarily caused by acts or omissions of persons or
 agencies other than the Contractor.
 When contracts, or any portion(s) thereof, are terminated before
 completion of all items of work in the Contract, payment will be
 made for the actual number of units or items of work completed at
 the contract unit price, or as mutually agreed for items of work
 partially completed or not started. No claim for loss of anticipated
 profits will be considered.
 Reimbursement for organization of the work (when not other
 wise included in the Contract) and moving equipment to and from
 the project will be considered where the volume of work completed
 is too small to compensate the Contractor for these expenses under
 the contract unit prices, the intent being that an equitable settlement
 will be made with the Contractor.
 Acceptable materials, obtained by the Contractor for the work,
 that have been inspected, tested, and accepted by the Engineer, and
 that are not incorporated in the work may, at the option of the
 Engineer, be purchased from the Contractor at actual cost as shown
 by receipted bills and actual cost records at such points of delivery
 as may be designated by the Engineer.
 Termination of a contract or a portion thereof shall not relieve the
 Contractor of responsibilities for the completed work, nor shall it
 relieve the Surety of its obligation for and concerning any just claims
 arising out of the work performed.
 108.09 Vacant.
 108
 
 109
 108.10 Suspension or Termination of Contract Because of
 Insufficient Appropriation of Funds. When the construction of
 the project is being financed, in whole or in part, with funds
 provided by an agency or agencies of government other than the
 State of Arkansas and should such agency or agencies fail to
 appropriate and make available sufficient funds for the normal
 prosecution of the Contract, the Commission reserves the right to:
 •
 •
 
 •
 
 delay issuance of the initial work order to the Contractor
 until sufficient funds have been made available,
 suspend construction operations on the project after the
 Work Order has been issued until sufficient funds have
 been made available, or
 terminate the Contract upon giving 30 calendar days
 written notice to the Contractor.
 
 If suspension of construction operations is ordered, the
 requirements of Subsection 108.05, as applicable, shall govern.
 If the Contract is terminated by the Commission, the
 requirements of Subsection 108.08, as applicable, shall govern.
 If it becomes necessary to suspend work because of insufficient
 funds, additional time for completion will be allowed equal to the
 period during which work is necessarily so suspended. In no case
 will additional compensation be allowed for such suspension of
 work except an equivalent extension of time for completion of the
 Contract.
 108.11 Termination of Contractor's Responsibility.
 The
 Contract will be considered complete when all work has been
 finished, the final inspection made by the Engineer, and the project
 accepted by the Department. The Contractor's responsibility shall
 then cease, except as may be required by law or as set forth in the
 Surety bonds and insurance policies.
 
 SECTION 109
 MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
 109.01 Measurement of Quantities.
 Work acceptably
 completed under the Contract will be measured by the Engineer
 according to United States Standard measures or the International
 109
 
 109
 System of units (SI, or metric). The unit of measure designated by
 the contract, be it US Standard or metric, will be the governing
 dimension for all inspection, testing, staking, and quantities on
 the project. Only actual quantities will be paid for unless otherwise
 specified. Unless otherwise specified, the following listed methods
 will be used:
 (a) For computing volumes of excavated materials, such as
 excavation, embankment, borrow, soil aggregate, etc., specified for
 measurement by the cubic yard (cubic meter), the average end area
 method will be used.
 (b) Structures will be measured to the neat lines as shown on the
 plans or as finally constructed at the direction of the Engineer.
 (c) Items that are measured by the linear foot (meter), such as
 pipe culverts, guardrail, underdrains, etc., will be measured parallel
 to the base or foundation upon which such structures are placed.
 (d) In determining the area for items bid on a square yard (square
 meter) or acre (hectare) basis, except as noted below, the
 longitudinal measurement will be made along the actual surface of
 the item and not horizontally, and transverse measurements shall
 conform to the dimensions shown on the plans or as directed by the
 Engineer. For items measured by the square yard (square meter), no
 deduction will be made for any fixture or opening having an area of
 9 square feet (1 square meter) or less.
 In determining the area for clearing and/or grubbing items bid on
 an acre (hectare) basis, the longitudinal and transverse
 measurements will be made on a horizontal basis. The area will be
 computed to the nearest 0.01 acre (0.01 ha).
 In determining the area for all seeding and mulch cover items bid
 on an acre (hectare) basis, when the area is a strip of varying width
 running approximately parallel to the centerline of the roadway, the
 longitudinal dimension will be measured horizontally and the
 transverse dimension will be measured parallel to the surface of the
 area seeded and/or mulched. For other areas of seeding and mulch
 cover items, all measurements will be made parallel to the surface of
 the area seeded and/or mulched. The area will be computed to the
 nearest 0.01 acre (0.01 ha). No deduction will be made for
 driveways, streets, and similar gaps that are 20' (6 m) or less in the
 110
 
 109
 dimension parallel to the centerline of the roadway, nor for ditch
 paving or similar construction that is 6' (2 m) or less in width.
 (e) Materials that are specified for measurement by the cubic yard
 (cubic meter) in vehicles shall be hauled in approved vehicles and
 measured therein at the point of entry on the project. Approved
 vehicles for this purpose may be of any type or size satisfactory to
 the Engineer, provided the body is of such type that the actual
 volume of the contents may be readily and accurately determined.
 No vehicle will be allowed to haul before measurements have been
 taken by the Department for determination of volumetric capacity.
 The volume will be computed to the nearest 0.01 cubic yard
 (0.01 cu m) and rounded to the nearest 0.1 cubic yard (0.1 cu m).
 The capacity of each vehicle shall be plainly marked on such vehicle
 and the marking shall not be changed without permission of the
 Engineer. In addition, each vehicle shall bear a plainly legible
 identification number.
 The Contractor shall strike off and level the loads and the
 inspector will inspect each load to check its volume at the point of
 entry on the project.
 When requested by the Contractor and approved by the Engineer,
 materials specified to be paid for by the cubic yard (cubic meter)
 may be measured by weighing the material according to (f) below
 and converting to cubic yards (cubic meters) by a constant factor,
 computed by determining the average weight of a minimum of three
 loads, deducting for moisture in excess of 5%, and dividing the
 known volume by the computed weight.
 (f) Materials that are specified for measurement by the ton
 (metric ton) shall be hauled in approved vehicles bearing a plainly
 legible identification number and weighed on accurate, approved
 scales furnished by the Contractor and inspected by a registered
 scale mechanic at least once a year and before their use after each
 move. Scales shall be located at the loading point or other approved
 location.
 The scales shall be an automatic weighing system, with digital or
 springless dials, and equipped with an automatic ticket printer. An
 automatic ticket printer is defined as a device connected to the
 weighing system in such manner that it automatically detects the
 weight determined by the system. It shall store and recall the TARE
 111
 
 109
 weight when the operator enters the truck identification. It shall
 print the following information on the ticket:
 •
 •
 •
 •
 •
 
 Gross, Tare, and Net weights.
 Identification of the truck.
 Current date.
 For asphalt mixtures, the time of loading or weighing.
 A unique ticket number (may be preprinted on the tickets).
 
 The NET weight should be computed by the weighing system;
 however, it may be computed manually and keyed in for printing.
 When the net weight of the material is determined by batch
 weights, the scales used shall meet all applicable requirements
 specified for truck scales, including automatic ticket printing, except
 that the GROSS and TARE weights will not be required.
 The ticket shall accompany each load delivered to the project. In
 addition to the items shown above that must be printed by the ticket
 printer, the following information shall also be shown on each ticket:
 Identification of the project.
 Identification of the material being delivered, including mix
 design numbers for asphalt mixtures.
 •
 •
 
 The ton shall be the short ton of 2000 pounds. (The metric ton
 shall be 1000 kg.) Vehicles used to haul materials measured by
 weight shall be weighed empty for each load, or shall be weighed
 daily or from time to time during the day as the Engineer may direct,
 to establish the tare weight of each load. The scales furnished shall
 be capable of weighing the entire loaded vehicle at one time.
 Deduction will be made for the weight of moisture in aggregates
 in excess of 5% of the oven-dry weight of the material.
 When requested by the Contractor and approved by the Engineer,
 aggregates specified to be paid for by the ton (metric ton) may be
 measured by the cubic yard (cubic meter) in vehicles as specified in
 (e) above and converting to tons by a constant factor established by
 determining the average weight of a minimum of three loads,
 deducting for moisture in excess of 5%, and dividing by the known
 volume.
 (g) Asphalt binders, liquid asphalts, and asphalt emulsions will be
 measured by the gallon (liter or kiloliter) or by the ton (metric ton) in
 112
 
 109
 distributors, transfer tanks, supply tanks, or tank cars as may be
 appropriate; or may be measured by other methods specified under
 the individual item. Volumetric measurements of asphalt binders
 and liquid asphalts will be corrected to 60° F (15 °C) using
 correcting tables from Chapter 11, Section 1, of the American
 Petroleum Institute's Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards.
 Volumetric measurements of asphalt emulsions will be corrected to
 60º F (15 °C) using the expansion coefficient factor of 0.00025 per
 degree Fahrenheit (0.00045 per degree Celsius). Water added to
 dilute emulsified asphalt will not be included in the pay quantity.
 Volumetric measurements made in the various types of tanks,
 including distributors, may be based on calibration of the tanks made
 by the Engineer, an authorized employee of another State
 Department of Transportation, a private laboratory approved by the
 Engineer, or by the manufacturer. If the calibration has not been
 made by the Engineer, the Department reserves the right to verify the
 calibration before the use of the distributor or tank. In the case of
 railroad tank cars or distributors, the outage table furnished for each
 tank by the manufacturer may be used in lieu of actual calibration of
 the tank.
 The Contractor shall furnish, at no cost to the Department, all
 necessary equipment, materials, and assistance for such calibration
 or verification. The Contractor shall furnish the Engineer with an
 outage table, obtained from the shipper, for each railroad tank car
 containing asphalt material received and unloaded on the project.
 When shipment is made by tank truck, the Contractor shall furnish
 the Engineer with a copy of the delivery ticket for each load showing
 the gallons (liters) at the temperature when loaded, but in no case
 shall such delivery ticket be used as a sole basis of payment in lieu
 of measurement through a calibrated distributor or tank. Pay
 quantities will include only the material actually used on the work at
 the direction of the Engineer.
 (h) Timber will be measured by 1000 foot board measure,
 (M.F.B.M.) [cubic meter]. Measurements will be based on nominal
 width and thickness based on applicable grading rules.
 (i) The term "gage" (or "gauge"), when used in connection with
 the measurement of plates, will mean the U.S. Standard Gage.
 
 113
 
 109
 Wire and wire mesh for concrete reinforcing will be specified by
 wire size number as shown in AASHTO M 32.
 (j) Cement will be measured by the ton (metric ton). Fly ash or
 ground granulated blast-furnace slag used as a replacement for
 cement will be measured as cement.
 (k) A station (metric station) when used as a definition or term of
 measurement will be 100 linear feet (100 meters) measured
 horizontally.
 (l) The term "lump sum" when used as an item of payment will
 mean complete payment for the work described in the Contract.
 When a complete structure or structural unit (in effect, "lump
 sum" work) is specified as the unit of measurement, the unit will be
 construed to include all necessary fittings and accessories.
 When standard manufactured items are specified such as fence,
 wire, plates, rolled shapes, pipe conduit, etc., and these items are
 identified by gage, unit weight, section dimensions, etc., such
 identification will be considered to be nominal weights or
 dimensions. Unless more stringently controlled by tolerances in
 cited specifications, manufacturing tolerances established by the
 industries involved will be accepted.
 It is the intent of these Specifications that ALL measurements of
 pay quantities shall be made according to the system of
 measurement used in the Contract. If a pay quantity in a metric
 contract is measured in English units and it is not feasible to remeasure the quantity in metric units, the conversion factors listed in
 the following table will be used to convert the measured quantity to
 the pay quantity. The Contractor will be responsible for converting
 any products purchased for incorporation into the work into the
 Contract units. Any products manufactured by the Contractor or
 subcontractor for incorporation into the work shall be produced in
 the units designated in the Contract. The results of the conversion
 will be rounded to the appropriate number of significant figures, but
 in no case to a precision greater than 0.01 unit.

 109.02 Scope of Payment. Payments to the Contractor will be
 made for the actual quantities of contract items completed and
 accepted according to the plans and specifications and if, upon
 completion of the construction, these actual quantities show either
 an increase or decrease from the quantities given in the proposal
 schedule, the contract unit prices will still prevail, except as
 provided in Subsections 109.03 or 109.04.
 The Contractor will receive and accept the compensation herein
 provided as full payment for furnishing all materials, labor,
 equipment, tools, and incidentals necessary to the completed work;
 for performing all work contemplated and embraced under the
 Contract; for all loss or damage arising out of the nature of the work,
 or from the action of the elements, or from any unforeseen
 difficulties or obstructions that may arise or be encountered during
 the prosecution of the work until its final acceptance by the
 Commission; for all risks of every description connected with the
 prosecution of the work; for all expenses incurred by, or in
 consequence of, the temporary suspension or discontinuance of the
 work as herein specified; for any infringement of patent, trade mark,
 or copyright; for all costs of permits, licenses, fees, and taxes; and
 for completing the work in an acceptable manner according to the
 plans and specifications. The payment of current or final estimate,
 or of retained percentage, shall in no degree prejudice or affect the
 obligation of the Contractor, at no cost to the Department, to repair,
 correct, renew, or replace any defects or imperfections in the
 115
 
 109
 construction of the roadway and its appurtenances, or in the strength
 of or quality of materials used therein or thereabouts, or relieve the
 Contractor from the payment of all damages due to such defects;
 provided such defects, imperfections, or damages shall be
 discovered on or before the final inspection or acceptance of the
 entire work. No retained percentage payable under the Contract, or
 any part thereof, shall become due and payable, if the Commission
 so elects, until the Commission is satisfied that the Contractor has
 fully settled or paid for all materials and equipment used in or upon
 the work, and for all labor done in connection therewith, and the
 Commission, if it so elects, may pay any or all such accounts wholly
 or in part and deduct the amount or amounts so paid from the final
 estimate.
 Any overpayments made to the Contractor or Surety, from
 whatever cause, are due and payable to the Department upon receipt
 by the Contractor or Surety of a request setting forth the particulars,
 regardless of pending claims or intention of the Contractor or Surety
 to file a claim.
 109.03 Payment and Compensation for Altered Quantities.
 When alterations in plans or quantities of work not requiring
 supplemental agreements are ordered and performed as provided in
 Subsection 104.02 or 104.03, and when such alterations result in an
 increase or a decrease of the quantity of work to be performed, the
 Contractor shall accept payment in full at the contract unit prices for
 the actual quantities of work accomplished, except as provided in
 Subsection 104.02 or 104.03, and no allowance will be made for
 anticipated profits, organization or overhead expense, or interest.
 Increased or decreased work involving supplemental agreements will
 be paid for as stipulated in such agreements.
 109.04 Extra and Force Account Work. (a) Supplemental
 Agreement.
 Extra work performed under a Supplemental
 Agreement shall be agreed upon by both the Engineer and the
 Contractor and shall be documented by an approved Change Order
 before the work is performed. When the Engineer deems it
 impractical to handle extra work on a unit price basis, payment
 specified in the Supplemental Agreement may be by any method
 agreed upon by both the Engineer and the Contractor. Mutual
 agreement between the Engineer and the Contractor as to the amount
 to be paid and method of payment under a Supplemental Agreement
 116
 
 109
 may be based on an estimate of the costs of performing the work;
 detailed information such as required for Force Account work; or
 any other logical method to which both parties agree which
 estimates costs incurred, excluding loss of anticipated profits and
 organization or overhead expense.
 (b) Force Account. Work ordered and accomplished by Force
 Account shall be documented by an approved Change Order prior
 to beginning the work. Payment for work accomplished on a
 Force Account basis, shall be made according to the following:
 (1) Labor. For all labor and foremen employed on the
 specific operation, the Contractor will receive the current local
 rate of wage, or the wage stipulated in the Contract, for each and
 every hour that said labor and foremen are actually engaged in
 such work, to which will be added an amount equal to 20%
 thereof. Only the actual amount of insurance and payroll taxes
 imposed by law and paid by the Contractor on the labor used will
 be allowed. No charge shall be made by the Contractor for
 organization or overhead expense. The number of laborers and
 foremen employed in the work shall be subject to regulation by
 the Engineer, and the number so employed shall not exceed the
 number the Engineer deems most practical and economical for
 the work.
 (2) Materials. For all materials used, if furnished by the
 Contractor, the Contractor will receive the actual cost of such
 materials, including freight, hauling, and handling charges, as
 shown by original receipted bills or certified statements, to which
 cost will be added a sum equal to 15% thereof.
 (3) Equipment. For any Contractor owned machinery or
 special equipment (other than small tools) which has been
 authorized by the Engineer, the Contractor shall receive the rental
 rates specified in the Change Order authorizing the work. The
 hourly rental rates shall be determined from the applicable
 monthly schedule in the current edition of the Rental Rate Blue
 Book
 for
 Construction
 Equipment,
 published
 by
 EquipmentWatch, a PRIMEDIA Business Directories and Book
 Group, as follows:
 The established rental rate shall be equal to the monthly rate
 for the basic equipment plus the monthly rate for applicable
 117
 
 109
 attachments, both divided by 176, all multiplied by the regional
 adjustment factor and the rate adjustment factor, plus the
 estimated hourly operating costs.
 For equipment not listed in this schedule, the Contractor shall
 receive a rental rate as agreed upon and specified in the Change
 Order for the work. If agreement cannot be reached, the
 Department reserves the right to establish a rate based on similar
 equipment in the schedule or on prevailing commercial rates in
 the area.
 Equipment that must be rented or leased specifically for extra
 work required by Change Order shall be authorized in writing by
 the Engineer. The Contractor shall be paid the invoice price for
 the rented or leased equipment, but not to exceed the applicable
 "Blue Book" rate, plus the estimated hourly operating costs.
 When it is necessary to obtain equipment from sources beyond
 the project limits exclusively for extra work of less than one
 month duration, the cost of transferring the equipment to the site
 of the work and return will be allowed as an additional item of
 expense. Where the move requires the use of a hauling unit, the
 move-in allowance will be limited to the rental rate, as computed
 above, for the hauling unit plus operator wages. In the event that
 the equipment is transferred under its own power, the moving
 allowance will be limited to one half of the hourly rental rate, as
 computed above, plus operator's wages. In the event that the
 move-out is to a different location, payment will in no instance
 exceed the amount of the move-in. Move-in allowance shall not
 be made for equipment brought to the project for extra work but
 which is subsequently retained on the project and utilized for
 completion of other contract items or related work.
 Standby time will be paid only on valid and documented
 claims made for equipment under Section 104.02 or on
 equipment ordered brought to the project or ordered held on the
 project by the Engineer. Equipment already on the project to
 complete other contract items will not be considered for payment
 for standby time.
 Equipment authorized or deemed by the Engineer to be on a
 standby basis shall be paid for at the standby rental rate for the
 number of hours in the Contractor's normal work day, but not to
 118
 
 109
 exceed 8 hours per day. The standby rental rate shall be
 computed by the following formula:
 Standby rate =Established rental rate - Operating costs
 2
 Time will be recorded to the nearest one quarter hour for
 purposes of computing compensation to the Contractor for
 equipment utilized under these rates.
 The equipment rates as determined above shall be full
 compensation for providing the required equipment and no
 additional compensation will be made for other costs such as, but
 not limited to, fuels, lubricants, replacement parts, or
 maintenance costs. Cost of repairs, both major and minor, as
 well as charges for mechanic's time utilized in servicing
 equipment to ready it for use before moving to the project, and
 similar charges will not be allowed.
 (4) The compensation as herein provided shall be received by
 the Contractor as payment in full for extra work done on a Force
 Account basis, and shall include the proper supervision of the
 work as well as furnishing small tools and equipment required by
 the labor employed, without additional compensation other than
 provided in clauses (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection. The
 Contractor's representative and the Inspector shall compare
 records of the extra work done on a Force Account basis, at the
 completion of certain units of the work or at intervals considered
 most practical. Copies of those records shall be made in
 duplicate, upon suitable forms provided for this purpose, and
 signed by both the Inspector and Contractor's representative, one
 copy each being forwarded to the Engineer and to the Contractor.
 All claims for extra work done on a Force Account basis, shall be
 submitted to the Engineer by the Contractor upon certified
 statements, to which shall be attached original receipted bills or
 certified statements covering the cost of and the freight charges
 on all materials used in such work, and said statements shall be
 filed not later than the tenth day of the month following that in
 which the work was actually performed, and shall include all
 labor, equipment, and material accounts properly chargeable to
 the work. Payment will then be made on the next regularly
 scheduled estimate following receipt of all required documents.
 119
 
 109
 109.05 Vacant.
 109.06 Vacant.
 109.07 Partial Payments. (a) Current Estimates. The Engineer
 will make in writing, at two-week intervals, an estimate of the
 materials in place and the amount of work performed during the
 preceding period and the value thereof at the contract unit prices.
 Payments for lump sum items will be made in proportion to the
 amount of work accomplished, as determined by the Engineer.
 Payments made on current estimates shall be subject to correction on
 any subsequent current estimate and/or on the final estimate.
 The estimate period will begin on Monday and the initial
 beginning date will be established by the Engineer at the
 preconstruction conference.
 The Engineer may withhold any current estimate or portion
 thereof if the Contractor is negligent or delinquent in submitting any
 required forms or documents, or if a timely response is not given to a
 request made by the Department for information, price quotations, or
 other data pertinent to the prosecution of the work.
 (b) Materials Estimates. At the request of the Contractor, the
 Engineer may at any time submit a materials estimate which will
 include the value of all aggregates, signing and lighting materials,
 precast concrete products, pipe culverts, piling, bridge railing, guard
 fence, reinforcing steel, structural steel, steel wire mesh, or other
 approved manufactured or commercially produced materials,
 delivered on the job site or placed in an approved storage area, but
 not incorporated into the work at the time of such estimate, provided
 the total value of such materials, including freight charges, appearing
 on any one estimate is not less than Twenty Thousand Dollars for
 paid invoices or Fifty Thousand Dollars for unpaid invoices, and
 only with agreement of the Surety. The approved storage area for
 materials for which advanced payment is made must be located
 within the State of Arkansas. This requirement may be waived if the
 Contractor provides the Department a separate bond for the full
 amount of the requested estimate. This Advance Materials Payment
 Bond shall remain in effect until the full amount of the advance
 payment has been recovered. All estimates in which materials
 allowances are made shall be approved by the Engineer in writing
 before payment and the Contractor shall be responsible for the
 120
 
 109
 storage, safekeeping, and delivery in acceptable condition of all
 materials for which payments have been allowed.
 Materials estimates will be allowed only for those materials that
 will be permanently incorporated into the work. The quantities
 allowed on a materials estimate will not exceed the plan quantities
 or quantities established by approved change order. Payments made
 on materials estimates will be deducted as the material is
 incorporated into the work.
 To request advance payment for stockpiled materials for which
 the Contractor has paid in full, the Contractor shall submit the
 following documentation:
 1. Written request for advance payment for stockpiled material,
 signed by the Contractor and the Surety.
 2. Documentation of the quantity and cost of the material.
 3. For commercially produced or manufactured material, receipted
 (paid) bills or invoices, signed by a duly authorized Officer of
 the firm supplying the materials and properly notarized.
 4. For materials produced by the Contractor, detailed statements
 showing the delivered cost of the material. Such statements shall
 also include receipted (paid) bills or invoices for royalty
 payments and/or a Certification of Ownership signed by a duly
 authorized Officer of the firm supplying the material and
 properly notarized.
 5. Certification by the Contractor that the material meets the
 Specification requirements for the stage of production at which
 the material is stored.
 To request advance payment for stockpiled materials for which
 the Contractor has NOT paid in full, the Contractor shall submit the
 following documentation:
 1. A written request for advance payment for stockpiled material,
 signed by the Contractor, the Supplier, and the Surety. This
 statement shall plainly state that the materials have not yet been
 paid for and that the Supplier shall be paid in full within 10
 calendar days from the Contractor’s receipt of payment by the
 Department. It shall further state that the Contractor shall
 provide the Department with paid invoices within 10 calendar
 121
 
 109
 days of payment to the Supplier and that the Surety agrees to
 responsibility for payment should the Contractor fail to so pay.
 2. Documentation of the quantity and cost of the material.
 3. For commercially produced or manufactured material, unpaid
 bills or invoices, signed by a duly authorized Officer of the firm
 supplying the materials and properly notarized.
 4. Certification by the Contractor that the material meets the
 Specification requirements for the stage of production at which
 the material is stored.
 109.08 Surplus Materials. Materials purchased or produced
 according to the plans or Contract, actually delivered and on hand
 and surplus to the needs of the project through any act or omission
 of the Department, may with the approval of the Engineer, be
 purchased by the Department. Payment will be made through the
 current or final estimate and shall be based on actual delivered cost
 to the Contractor as shown by receipted, paid bills, or by an
 approved certified statement of cost of production. All materials
 paid for as provided above shall be placed in the possession of the
 Department at the site and become the property of the Department.
 109.09 Acceptance and Final Payment. The Engineer will
 approve the estimate for final payment after previous payments have
 been deducted, and will notify the Contractor and Surety of such
 approval.
 Before delivery of the final payment, the Engineer shall
 receive from the Contractor a written acceptance of the final
 estimate as payment in full for the work done. The final estimate
 shall be considered as the final payment even though it may be a
 zero amount. All prior partial estimates and payments shall be
 subject to correction in the final estimate and payment.
 
 SECTION 110
 PROTECTION OF WATER QUALITY AND
 WETLANDS
 110.01 General. This work shall consist of measures taken to
 prohibit the degradation of water quality and wetlands. The purpose
 122
 
 110
 is to limit, control, and contain fill materials, soil erosion,
 sedimentation, and other harmful wastes resulting from construction
 operations that could result in harm to the wetlands and waters of the
 United States. These requirements apply even if Corps of Engineer
 (C of E) Section 404 or National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
 System (NPDES) Permits are not required for the project.
 The requirements of this Section apply to all activities under the
 Contract.
 The Contractor should be aware that requested
 modifications to the Contract and/or individual permits may not be
 approved.
 The Contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State,
 and local permits and requirements on sites outside of the right-ofway limits utilized by the Contractor for the benefit of the project.
 While the primary enforcement of these requirements for locations
 off of the right-of-way rests with the applicable regulatory
 government agency, the Department retains the right and authority to
 inspect and enforce Contractor compliance should violations come
 to the attention of the Department.
 110.02 Responsibility of the Contractor. The Contractor shall
 comply with the requirements of the Federal Water Pollution
 Control Act, 33 USC § 1251 et seq., the Arkansas Water and Air
 Pollution Control Act, Ark. Code Ann. § 8-4-101 et seq., and the
 regulations, orders, or decrees issued pursuant thereto. In the event
 of conflict between these regulations, orders, or decrees and the
 provisions shown on plans, the more restrictive requirements shall
 apply.
 110.03 C of E Section 404 Permit for Department Right-ofWay and Contractor Facilities. (a) General. All requirements of
 the Contract and Specifications shall apply to the Contractor's
 activities covered by the Department's C of E Section 404 Permit on
 or off the right-of-way. Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution
 Control Act, as amended, establishes a permit program for the
 regulation of discharges for dredged or fill material and excavation
 in wetlands and other waters of the United States.
 (b) Responsibility for Initial Section 404 Permit. The
 Department will obtain all required Section 404 Permits for essential
 work on the right-of-way before the Contract is awarded. Contract
 documents will detail the location and amount of permanent and/or
 123
 
 110
 temporary fills, excavation, and clearing activities allowed under the
 Section 404 Permit.
 (c) Contractor Requested Section 404 Permit Modifications.
 The Contractor shall submit a request on a form provided by the
 Department to the Engineer for any activity involving wetlands or
 waters of the United States on or off the right-of-way and not
 covered by the Department's C of E Section 404 Permit prior to
 performing the activity. The Contractor shall be prepared to prove
 there is no practicable alternative to the Section 404 Permit change
 being requested. The Engineer will make a within 10 business days
 concerning the necessity or practicability of the request. The
 Department will then apply for Section 404 Permit modifications it
 determines to be necessary or practicable. The C of E review of
 proposed modifications to a Section 404 Permit may require 60-120
 calendar days. These requested changes may be denied or modified
 by the Department or C of E. Requested modifications that require
 mitigation may be at the Contractor’s expense.
 If the Department declines to consider a Section 404 Permit
 modification request by the Contractor for an off right-of-way
 activity, the Contractor may apply for his own Section 404 Permit.
 (d) Compensation and Extension of Contract Time. The
 Contractor will not be granted additional compensation or contract
 time due to requested modifications to the Section 404 Permit that
 are considered by the Engineer to be for the convenience of the
 Contractor. If, however, due to no fault of the Contractor, a Section
 404 Permit modification involving on right-of-way activities is
 deemed by the Engineer to be necessary, additional contract time
 and/or compensation may be considered according to the provisions
 of Section 104.
 110.04 NPDES Permit (a) General. Federal requirements
 mandate that excessive amounts of pollutants be prevented from
 exiting construction sites.
 The Arkansas Department of
 Environmental Quality (ADEQ) has issued the NPDES Permit for
 owners of facilities discharging storm water associated with
 construction activity located in the State of Arkansas. Copies of the
 NPDES Permit are available from ADEQ.
 NPDES Permit coverage is required for all construction sites that
 will result in land disturbance of one acre or more, by activities such
 124
 
 110
 as clearing, grading, or excavating, in accordance with the
 following:
 (1) Automatic Coverage (Small Construction) Sites: Small
 Construction Site permits are required for any
 construction activity that will disturb/expose a total of
 one acre or more, but less than five acres. This also
 applies to any construction activity that will
 disturb/expose less than one acre, if it is part of a plan
 that will ultimately disturb/expose one acre or more.
 (2) Large Construction Sites: Large Construction Site
 permits are required for any construction activity that
 will disturb/expose a total of five acres or more.
 The Department will obtain NPDES Permit coverage for essential
 work on the right-of-way before the Contract is awarded. The
 Contractor will be responsible for posting the NPDES Permit Notice
 of Coverage (NOC) at the construction site prior to commencing
 construction. The Engineer will provide the NOC to the Contractor
 to post on the project at a safe, publicly accessible location near
 where construction is actively underway.
 The Contractor shall
 move it as necessary to comply with the NPDES Permit
 requirements.
 All off-site areas, including storage sites or borrow areas or
 waste areas, are operated by the Contractor. The Contractor shall be
 responsible for obtaining any required NPDES permits for off-site
 areas. Off-site areas within city limits are subject to city planning
 regulations and may require clearance from the city. Off-site areas
 that fall within the jurisdiction of a “Qualifying Local Program”
 (QLP) as defined in the NPDES Permit, must comply with the
 requirements of the QLP. The Contractor shall obtain clearances
 and approvals of this type for their off-site areas.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining all required
 permits for the operation of dedicated asphalt and dedicated concrete
 plants operated by the Contractor for, or located on, the project.
 (b) Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan. The Department
 will develop a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) for
 the project, as required. Any measures required by the SWPPP are
 included in the plans, specifications, supplemental specifications,
 and special provisions. The Engineer will maintain the SWPPP at
 125
 
 110
 the project field office or, if a field office is not provided, the
 SWPPP will be maintained with the Department’s on-site personnel.
 Prior to beginning work on the project, the Contractors shall
 complete the Contractor Identification section of the Storm Water
 Pollution Prevention Plan as required by Part II.4.B of the NPDES
 Permit.
 The Contractor shall inform the Engineer sufficiently in advance
 of planned construction activities and conduct construction activities
 in a manner to allow the SWPPP to be modified to accommodate the
 activities.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for compliance with all
 applicable terms and conditions of the NPDES Permit as it relates to
 activities on the construction site, including installation and
 maintenance of Best Management Practices (BMPs) and other
 controls required by the SWPPP.
 Special provision(s) for the
 protection of endangered species will be a part of the Contract, if
 applicable.
 (c) Controls and Measures. All controls are designed and
 installed with the primary goal of retaining sediment on site to the
 maximum extent practicable.
 The Contractor shall provide the following information, in
 writing, to the Engineer sufficiently in advance of installation to
 allow incorporation into the SWPPP:
 •
 
 The sequence of major activities, the erosion and
 sediment control items associated with the major activities,
 and the timing of implementation for those items are required
 for the SWPPP.
 
 •
 
 A planned sequence of major activities, with the
 associated BMPs.
 
 •
 
 Amendments to the planned sequence of major
 activities.
 
 •
 
 Stabilized or wheel washing vehicle exits from the
 construction site as required to prevent tracking of material
 onto the public roadway.
 
 •
 
 Temporary sanitary facilities provided and properly
 maintained by the Contractor.
 126
 
 •
 •
 
 110
 Concrete washout waste areas to be utilized to prevent
 concrete waste from being discharged into water bodies.
 Storage areas for fuel and other potentially hazardous
 materials and truck washing areas with appropriate controls to
 prevent non-storm water discharges.
 
 (d) Non-storm water discharges. The Contractor shall not
 release any materials except the following non-storm water
 discharges that are authorized by the NPDES Permit: discharges
 from firefighting activities; fire hydrant flushings; wash water
 (without detergent or spilled material); water used to control dust;
 potable water sources including waterline flushings; irrigation
 drainage; air conditioning condensate; springs; uncontaminated
 ground water; and foundation or footing drains where flows are not
 contaminated.
 All other non-storm water discharges are prohibited unless in
 compliance with and covered by a separate NPDES permit.
 (e) Releases in excess of reportable quantities. Instructions to
 be followed after the release of a hazardous substance or oil are
 provided in Subsection 107.01(f) of the Standard Specifications and
 Part I of the NPDES Permit.
 The Contractor shall submit the following information as soon as
 possible, but no later than 72 hours after knowledge of the release, to
 the Engineer for submission to ADEQ: A written description of the
 release (including the type and estimate of the amount of material
 released), the date that such release occurred, the circumstances
 leading to the release, and steps to be taken in accordance with the
 NPDES Permit for forwarding to ADEQ.
 110.05 Standard Conditions. (a) General. The following
 conditions are required on all projects for the protection of water
 quality and wetlands:
 • Compliance with all conditions of the C of E Section 404
 Permit, NPDES Permit, Short Term Activity Authorization
 (STAA), Section 7 of Endangered Species Act, and Section
 401 Water Quality Certification.
 • To the maximum extent practicable, discharges of dredged or
 fill material into waters of the United States shall be avoided or
 minimized through the use of other practicable alternatives.
 127
 
 110
 • Construction activities shall not cause unacceptable
 interference with navigation.
 • No activity shall substantially interrupt the movement of the
 species of aquatic life native to the water body, including those
 species which normally migrate through the area.
 • Under a Nationwide Section 404 Permit, no activity shall occur
 in a component of the National Wild and Scenic River System,
 or in a river officially designated by Congress as a "study river"
 for possible inclusion in the system, while the river is in
 official study status. Standard (individual) Section 404
 Permits shall be obtained for activities occurring in these
 rivers.
 • No storage of petroleum, other chemical products, waste
 materials, trash, etc., shall be allowed within 100 feet (30
 meters) of a wetland or water body boundary or elevation as
 shown on the plans. The Engineer reserves the right to limit
 the storage of any material within the floodplain of a stream to
 preclude the possibility of an unlawful discharge to the stream.
 • To move clean water around the construction area without
 causing additional turbidity or sediment, the use of
 construction staging, cofferdams, pipe culverts, lined channels,
 sandbagged material, barrier wall, or other suitable materials or
 methods, as approved by the Engineer, shall be utilized for
 directing or confining water from the work area. This water
 shall be returned to the water body downstream from the
 construction site. The options utilized should consider the
 minimization of sedimentation and turbidity as a primary
 objective.
 • If material or debris resulting from Contractor operations
 enters a waterway, it is considered an unpermitted fill material
 under the Section 404 Permit and the Engineer shall determine
 whether it may remain. If it is determined that the material is
 to be removed from the waterway, the Engineer will review for
 possible approval the Contractor's method of removal. Options
 for removal should consider the minimization of turbidity as a
 primary objective.
 • No asphaltic material shall be disposed of in wetlands or
 waters of the United States.
 
 128
 
 110
 • Temporary bridges or other structures shall be used whenever
 it is necessary to ford any body of water on the project more
 than twice in any six month period.
 • Equipment shall not be operated in any body of water on the
 project except when required to construct channel changes or
 structures.
 • Cofferdams needed for work in water shall be constructed from
 non-erodible materials.
 • Materials excavated during construction shall be placed on dry
 land outside the channel banks of all streams, at least 10 feet (3
 meters) from the channel banks of a perennial stream, and at
 least 25 feet (8 meters) from the channel banks of a 5 cubic
 feet/second (CFS) or larger stream. This includes channelized
 streams and relief channels. This material shall be properly
 contained or stabilized to minimize erosion and degradation of
 water quality and be removed before the beginning of the wet
 season.
 (b) Wetland Areas. Wetland areas on and off the right-of-way
 shall be preserved and protected whenever possible. Work in or near
 wetlands shall be performed in a manner that will minimize harm to
 the wetlands. The Contractor shall be responsible for the protection
 of adjacent wetlands.
 • Clearing of wetlands shall be limited to the minimum
 necessary for the completion of the project.
 • Wetland areas inside or outside the construction limits shall
 not be used for storage, parking, access, borrow material, haul
 roads or any other construction support activity unless
 specifically approved in advance by the Engineer and
 according to the applicable Section 404 Permit.
 • When heavy equipment is working in wetlands, appropriate
 measures such as placing the equipment on mats, shall be
 taken to minimize soil disturbance.
 • Material shall not be wasted or temporarily stockpiled in
 wetlands.
 (c) Temporary Fill.
 • Unless otherwise provided, temporary work ramps or haul
 roads, when permitted, shall provide sufficient waterway
 openings to allow the passage of expected high flows during
 the time the ramp or haul road is in place.
 129
 
 110
 • Temporary fills or structures, if washed downstream, are
 considered to be unauthorized fill under the C of E Section 404
 Permit and the Engineer shall determine whether it may
 remain. If it is determined that the material is to be removed
 from the waterway, the Contractor shall submit, in writing, the
 proposed method of removal to the Engineer for possible
 approval.
 When considering options for removal, the
 Contractor shall consider the minimization of turbidity as a
 primary objective. Replacement of original fill may require a
 Section 404 Permit change or an additional Section 404
 Permit.
 • All fill for temporary work ramps or haul roads placed within
 the channel banks of a stream, within 10 feet (3 meters) of the
 channel banks of a perennial stream, and within 25 feet (8
 meters) of the channel banks of a 5 cubic feet/second (CFS) or
 larger stream, shall be constructed using a riprap of the size
 specified in Subsection 816.02(a)(2), or larger material. This
 includes channelized streams and relief channels. A minimal
 amount of clean stone or gravel may be placed on top of the
 temporary fill in order to obtain a smooth working surface.
 The clean stone or gravel utilized shall have less than twelve
 percent passing the #200 (0.075 mm) sieve. Upon removal,
 salvaged material that meets the requirements of Subsection
 816.02 will be paid for when reused in areas which require the
 utilization of riprap.
 • Unless specifically authorized under the Section 404 Permit as
 temporary or permanent fill material, bridge demolition rubble
 shall not be dropped into a water body or wetland.
 • All fill material shall be free from toxic pollutants in harmful
 amounts.
 • All temporary fills shall be removed and the affected areas
 returned to their preexisting elevation.
 • All temporary fill in any body of water or wetland shall be
 properly contained or stabilized to minimize erosion and
 degradation of water quality.
 (d) Erosion and Sediment Control. The Contractor shall
 install, construct, and maintain erosion and sedimentation control
 items as shown on the plans or as directed by the Engineer.
 
 130
 
 110
 • The Contractor shall install, construct, repair, and maintain
 erosion and sedimentation control items within three business
 days of being instructed to do so by the Engineer. However, if
 heavy equipment is required and the Engineer agrees that
 conditions do not allow heavy equipment to be used, a longer
 time frame may be allowed. The Contractor shall submit
 adequate documentation to the Engineer that proves conditions
 are not suitable for the use of heavy equipment and that there is
 no alternative to its use. When conditions become suitable, as
 determined by the Engineer, the Contractor shall proceed with
 the required actions to be completed within three business days
 after receiving notification.
 • Minimizing time of exposure of disturbed ground is a primary
 objective. Therefore, disturbing an area and postponing
 subsequent work could result in the Contractor being required
 to stabilize the area at no cost to the Department. Unless
 modified on the plans or directed by the Engineer, the total
 surface area of disturbed soil on the right-of-way at any one
 time shall be limited to a maximum of 20 acres (8 hectares).
 Disturbed soil is defined as exposed bare soil denuded of
 vegetative cover or lacking stabilization. Stabilized soil is
 defined as soil that is covered by grass, seeded and mulched,
 mulched, covered by erosion control matting, or covered by
 permanent stabilization as shown on the plans or as directed by
 the Engineer. The Engineer will have the authority to increase
 or decrease the limitation on surface area of disturbed land
 based upon the Contractor's capability to effectively control
 erosion and sedimentation on these areas and contain the
 sediment within the right of way limits, including temporary
 construction easements (TCE). The Contractor shall be
 responsible for making the necessary arrangements with the
 proper owner(s) and for reclaiming sediment and stabilizing
 the area that is not contained within these limits. This work
 will be the responsibility of the Contractor and shall be
 performed at no cost to the Department.
 • Cut and fill slopes shall be completed and stabilized in
 increments not to exceed 25 feet (8 meters), measured
 vertically, as the construction progresses.
 • Completed areas within buffer zones adjacent to water bodies
 as shown on plans or otherwise designated by the Engineer,
 131
 
 110
 
 •
 
 •
 
 •
 
 •
 
 •
 
 •
 
 shall receive permanent seeding, temporary seeding, or mulch
 cover as soon as possible, but in no case more than five
 business days after completion, or sooner as directed by the
 Engineer.
 All other completed areas, including increments of cut and fill
 slopes described above, shall receive permanent seeding,
 temporary seeding, or mulch cover within 14 calendar days
 after completion, or sooner as directed by the Engineer.
 Disturbed areas that are temporarily abandoned shall be
 stabilized within 14 calendar days after activity ceases.
 Payment for this work will be made if abandoned due to no
 fault or negligence of the Contractor. Payment will not be
 made for temporary stabilization required by Contractor
 negligence, by the lack of proper Contractor scheduling, or for
 the convenience of the Contractor.
 Excavation, including silt removed from erosion and
 sedimentation control devices, shall not be deposited where it
 can be eroded into waters of the United States. At locations of
 drainage structures, care shall be taken to prevent mounds of
 excavation on the inlet end from washing through the structure
 or on the outlet end from washing downstream.
 Water pumped during any dewatering activity shall be diverted
 into a sediment basin of the appropriate type as shown on the
 standard drawings or other device as approved by the Engineer.
 This sediment basin or device and its holding capacity shall be
 approved by the Engineer. No turbid discharge to waters of the
 State shall be allowed.
 Off-site vehicle tracking of sediments and the generation of
 dust shall be minimized. The Contractor shall construct
 stabilized entrances to the work areas as necessary to eliminate
 off-site tracking of soils. Work involved in constructing
 stabilized entrances will not be measured or paid for
 separately, but full compensation therefore will be considered
 included in the contract unit prices bid for other items of the
 Contract. Sediment tracked from the construction site shall be
 removed by sweeping at a frequency to minimize off-site
 impacts to water bodies.
 After cut sections are constructed, the tops of backslopes will
 be rounded to blend the slopes into natural ground when
 132
 
 110
 practicable. At transitions from cut to fill, ditches shall be
 tailed out to prevent erosion of the toe of slope.
 • Temporary erosion and sedimentation control devices shall not
 be removed or destroyed by the Contractor without permission
 from the Engineer.
 Additional temporary and permanent erosion and sedimentation
 control items necessary on the right-of-way to contain discharges
 that are not attributed to the Contractor's negligence, carelessness, or
 failure to install permanent controls, shall be performed as ordered
 by the Engineer and will be paid for either at unit bid prices or as
 provided for in Subsection 109.04.
 110.06 Pollutants. (a) General. The Contractor shall employ
 best management practices to prevent pollution by spills. Pollutants
 such as chemicals, fuels, lubricants, asphalt, raw sewage, concrete
 drum wash water, and other harmful wastes shall not be discharged
 into or alongside any waters of the United States, but shall be
 disposed of in accordance with governing State and Federal
 regulations. Storage of these materials shall not be allowed within
 100 feet (30 meters) of a wetland or water body.
 (b) Spill Prevention.
 (1) Good Housekeeping.
 • The quantity of materials stored on the project should be
 limited, as much as practical, to that quantity required to
 perform the work in an orderly sequence and should be
 stored in a neat, orderly manner in their original containers
 with the original manufacturer's label.
 • Manufacturer's recommendations for proper use and
 disposal of materials shall be followed. All disposal shall
 be according to all local, State and Federal regulations in a
 permitted landfill or permitted disposal facility.
 • The Contractor should inspect daily to ensure proper use
 and disposal of materials.
 (2) Hazardous Products.
 • Hazardous products shall be kept in original containers
 with their original labels unless they are not re-sealable or
 are damaged.
 • Material Safety Data Sheets shall be retained on site and
 shall be available to all personnel at all times.
 133
 
 110
 •
 
 If surplus products must be disposed of, manufacturer's
 recommendations and local, State, and Federal regulations
 shall be followed.
 
 (3) Product Specific Practices. The Contractor shall limit
 the amount of petroleum products and other chemicals in work
 areas adjacent to wetlands, water bodies, and other sensitive
 areas. The following product specific practices shall be followed
 on-site:
 •
 
 Petroleum Products. All on-site vehicles shall be
 monitored for leaks and receive regular preventive
 maintenance to reduce the chance of leakage.
 Petroleum products shall be stored in tightly sealed
 containers that are clearly labeled.
 All asphalt
 substances used on-site shall be applied according to
 manufacturer's recommendations and/or Department
 specifications. Construction of berms, or other similar
 measures, may be required for storage/refueling areas as
 a best management practice to restrict spill areas.
 
 •
 
 Fertilizers. Fertilizers shall be applied only in the manner
 and amounts required by the specifications. Material shall
 be stored in a covered area and shall not be exposed to
 precipitation. Partially used bags shall not be discarded,
 but removed and disposed of properly. No storage of these
 materials shall be allowed within a wetland or floodplain.
 
 •
 
 Paints and Solvents. All containers shall be tightly sealed
 and stored when not required for use. Excess material and
 waste shall not be discharged, but shall be properly
 disposed of according to manufacturers' instructions and/or
 State and Federal regulations. No storage of these
 materials shall be allowed within a wetland or floodplain.
 
 •
 
 Concrete Trucks. Concrete trucks shall be allowed to
 discharge surplus concrete or drum wash water on site only
 in areas designated in the SWPPP. Discharge areas shall
 not be in or where the discharge can be washed into
 wetlands or water bodies.
 
 •
 
 Concrete Curing Agents. Concrete curing agents shall be
 applied only in the manner and amount required by the
 134
 
 110
 specifications. Excess material shall not be allowed to run
 off the area being treated.
 (c) Spill Reporting and Cleanup Practices. All spills shall be
 reported as described in Subsection 107.01(f).
 In addition, the practices below shall be followed:
 • All spills shall be cleaned up immediately after discovery or
 contained until appropriate cleanup methods can be
 employed.
 • The spill area shall be contained and personnel shall wear
 appropriate protective clothing to prevent injury from contact
 with a hazardous substance.
 • Manufacturer's recommended methods for spill cleanup shall
 be followed along with proper disposal methods in
 accordance with local, State, and Federal regulations referred
 to previously.
 Further, where a release containing a hazardous substance or oil
 in an amount equal to or in excess of a reportable quantity
 established under either 40 CFR §§ 110, 117, or 302, occurs on the
 right-of-way during a 24-hour period, the following action shall be
 taken by the Engineer:
 • A report shall be submitted to the Arkansas Department of
 Environmental Quality within five calendar days of the
 knowledge of the release. The report shall include a written
 description of the release (including the type and estimate of
 the amount of material released); the date that such a release
 occurred; the circumstance leading to the release; and the
 corrective actions taken.
 • The Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan must be
 modified within 14 calendar days of knowledge of the
 release by addition of the above information. Review and
 modification of the plan must be made to identify measures
 to prevent the recurrence of such releases, and to respond to
 such releases.
 If the spill occurs on a site off of the right-of-way, the Contractor
 shall follow the reporting procedures as described above.
 110.07 Contractor Negligence. If the Contractor violates the
 requirements of a C of E Section 404 Permit, NPDES Permit,
 STAA, or any other requirement of these specifications, and fails to
 135
 
 110
 properly maintain, install and/or construct erosion and sediment
 control items, the Engineer may take, but is not limited to, one or
 more of the following actions:
 •
 •
 •
 •
 
 Cessation of other project related work,
 Withholding of Contractor payments,
 Suspension of the Project,
 Default of the Contract.
 
 All work required due to the violation of provisions of C of E
 Section 404, NPDES Permits, or other requirements of these
 specifications that results from Contractor negligence, carelessness,
 or failure to perform work as scheduled, shall be performed by the
 Contractor at no cost to the Department. In addition, the Contractor
 will be assessed the amounts of any and all fines and penalties
 assessed against and costs incurred by the Department which are the
 result of the Contractor's failure to comply with a C of E Section 404
 Permit or NPDES Permit.
 Failure to comply with the conditions of the C of E Section 404
 Permit may result in the C of E issuing a cease and desist order for
 all permitted activities. Obtaining a new Section 404 Permit from
 the C of E may require 60-120 calendar days processing time.
 The Department will not be responsible for any delays or costs
 due to the Contractor's failure to comply with the above special
 conditions.
 The Contractor will not be granted additional
 compensation or contract time due to loss of Permits for
 noncompliance.
 In the event that pollutant spills occur which are the result of the
 Contractor's actions or negligence, the clean-up shall be performed

 201.01 Description. This work shall consist of cutting, removing
 from the ground, and properly disposing of trees, stumps, hedge,
 brush, roots, logs, weeds, rubbish, sod refuse dumps, sawdust piles,
 lumbering slash, and other materials within the limits of the right-ofway or other designated areas that interfere with the work or are
 considered objectionable.
 This work shall also include selective clearing, preserving
 existing vegetation, scalping, and the preservation of objects
 designated to remain.
 201.02 General. Areas shall be classified as clearing and/or
 grubbing when trees are 4" (100 mm) or more in diameter measured
 12" (0.3 m) above the ground. The area shall be classified as
 scalping if the trees or stumps are less than 4" (100 mm) in diameter
 measured 12" (0.3 m) above the ground.
 (a) Clearing. The cutting and removal of all trees, brush, and
 other objectionable growth, and the removal and disposal of logs,
 rubbish piles, refuse dumps, sawdust piles, lumbering slash, and
 other objectionable matter from the surface of the ground in the
 areas shown on the plans or designated by the Engineer.
 (b) Grubbing. The grubbing and removal of all stumps, roots,
 and other objectionable matter, lying wholly or in part below the
 surface of the ground.
 (c) Selective Clearing. The trimming of selected trees and
 shrubs, the removal from the ground and disposal of logs, root pods,
 brush, refuse dumps, and other undesirable debris, and the cutting,
 removal, and disposal of all undergrowth, stumps, and standing
 trees, except those trees and shrubs designated to be preserved. The
 selective clearing areas will be shown on the plans.
 (d) Preserved Vegetation. Areas of the right-of-way containing
 trees and brush and designated on the plans as Preserved Vegetation
 areas shall not be disturbed except as described below. This
 operation normally applies to areas of natural growth occurring in
 138
 
 201
 the medians, interchanges, and wide rights of way between a line 10'
 (3 m) beyond the construction limits and the right-of-way lines, or as
 designated.
 (e) Scalping. Areas not classified as clearing and grubbing and
 that are within construction limits shall be scalped, if appropriate.
 Scalping shall include the removal and disposal of material such as
 saplings less than 4" (100 mm) in diameter measured 12" (0.3 m)
 above the ground, logs, brush, roots, grass, residue of agricultural
 crops, refuse dumps, and decayed matter.
 (f) Clearing and Grubbing Trees. The cutting, grubbing, and
 removal of individual, isolated trees and stumps greater than 4"
 (100 mm) diameter measured 12" (0.3 m) above the ground as
 shown on the plans or designated by the Engineer to be removed.
 201.03 Construction Requirements. Work required under
 Section 110 and other applicable NPDES requirements shall be
 conducted in conjunction with clearing and grubbing.
 The
 construction limits for the project shall be cleared as defined above,
 except those objects designated to remain shall be carefully
 protected from abuse, marring, or damage during construction
 operations. Trees shall be felled and removed in such a manner as to
 avoid injury to other trees or other objects designated to remain. In
 case of injury to bark, limbs, or roots of vegetation designated to
 remain, the Contractor shall repair such damage by corrective
 pruning or other appropriate methods. Trees or other debris falling
 outside the right-of-way shall be removed and disposed of according
 to these specifications.
 Holes remaining after removal of trees, stumps, etc., shall be
 backfilled with material approved by the Engineer and compacted as
 directed except in areas to be excavated. The Contractor shall
 complete the operation by blading, bulldozing, or other approved
 methods, so that the right-of-way shall be free of holes, ditches, or
 other abrupt changes in elevations that resulted from the clearing and
 grubbing operations.
 201.04 Clearing and Grubbing. The construction limits shall
 be cleared of stumps, brush, logs, rubbish, trees, and shrubs, with the
 exception of such trees, shrubs, and areas designated on the plans or
 by the Engineer for preservation. Grubbing will not be required in
 areas that will have a fill height of 3' (1 m) or more above
 139
 
 201
 undisturbed stumps cut within 6" (150 mm) of the natural ground.
 Sound stumps may be left outside the construction limits when they
 are severed flush with or below the natural ground, or the slope line
 in areas to be rounded at the top of the back slopes.
 Low-hanging, unsound, or unsightly branches shall be removed
 from trees or shrubs designated to remain. Branches of trees
 extending over the roadbed shall be trimmed to give a clear height of
 20' (6 m) above the roadbed surface. Trimming shall be done by
 skilled workers and according to good tree surgery practices.
 Merchantable timber in the clearing area that has not been
 removed from the right-of-way before the date that the Contract is
 awarded by the Department shall become the property of the
 Contractor, unless otherwise provided.
 When perishable material is burned, it shall be under the constant
 care of a competent watcher. Burning shall be accomplished at such
 times and in such manner that the surrounding vegetation, adjacent
 property, or anything designated to remain on the right-of-way will
 not be jeopardized.
 Upon notice from the Engineer that
 meteorological conditions render burning undesirable, the
 Contractor shall cease all burning until notified by the Engineer that
 meteorological conditions are suitable for a resumption of burning
 operations.
 When specified, burning will not be permitted unless the material
 to be burned is placed in an incineration pit and an acceptable forced
 air combustion device is used that will minimize the emission of
 smoke, fly ash, and other pollutants. This device shall be
 constructed so that the forced air is directed over the fire by plenums
 or ducts. The use of open fans or mulch blowers will not be
 permitted. The Contractor shall comply with all Federal, State,
 County, and City laws, regulations, or ordinances applicable to the
 disposal of clearing and grubbing material. Materials and debris that
 cannot be burned shall be removed from the right-of-way and
 disposed of at locations off the project, outside the limits of view
 from any public road, street, park, or other public facility.
 The Contractor shall make all necessary arrangements with the
 property owner for obtaining suitable disposal locations. Disposal
 operations and final cleanup of the sites, including seeding and
 stabilization, shall comply with the requirements of Section 110.
 140
 
 201
 The costs involved in obtaining disposal sites, hauling, cleanup and
 stabilization for erosion control will not be paid for separately, but
 full compensation therefor will be considered included in the
 contract unit prices bid for other items of the Contract. When
 requested by the Engineer, the Contractor shall furnish copies of all
 agreements with property owners.
 201.05 Selective Clearing. This work shall be performed in such
 a manner as to leave the designated areas in a park-like condition
 and susceptible to economical mowing. Disposal of all material
 shall comply with the methods set out in the Clearing and Grubbing
 requirements.
 Stumps, trees, and shrubs, except those designated to be
 preserved, shall be severed flush with or below the ground.
 Trimming of selected trees and shrubs shall be performed as
 described in Subsection 201.04.
 Movement and operation of equipment shall be such that roots,
 branches, and trunks of trees and shrubs selected for retention will
 not be scarred, broken, or otherwise damaged to the extent that the
 life of the plant is endangered.
 201.06 Preserved Vegetation. Trees, shrubs, brush, vines, and
 other natural perennial vegetation shall be protected in the areas
 designated as Preserved Vegetation.
 Areas designated as Preserved Vegetation shall not be used for
 parking, storage, or other construction support activities that will
 damage vegetation or compact the soil. Care shall be taken to
 prevent spills of materials hazardous to vegetation such as oil,
 hydraulic fluid, salts, etc. Erosion and sedimentation control shall
 be such that sediment is not deposited in depths greater than 2"
 (50 mm) within any portion of the Preserved Vegetation area.
 Clearing and grubbing may be required through preserved
 vegetation areas for drainage outlets, channels, or other required
 construction.
 Where fence is to be installed along the right-of-way line in
 wooded areas, the Contractor may clear trees from a strip
 approximately 10' (3 m) wide adjacent to and within the right-ofway to accommodate fence erection equipment. The Contractor
 shall exercise care so that other trees, shrubs, grass and other
 141
 
 201
 vegetation designated to remain are not damaged. Such clearing in
 areas designated as Preserved Vegetation or where clearing would
 otherwise not be required will not be paid for separately, but full
 compensation therefor will be considered included in the contract
 unit prices bid for other items of the Contract.
 201.07 Scalping.
 The Contractor shall scalp areas where
 excavation or embankment is to be made, except that mowed sod
 need not be removed where the embankment to be constructed is
 more than 3' (1 m) in height.
 All suitable material resulting from the scalping operations shall
 be placed on the finished slopes, adjacent to the area from which it is
 obtained, after the excavation or embankment operations are
 complete.
 Unsuitable material shall be disposed of as specified for Clearing
 and Grubbing.
 201.08 Method of Measurement. (a) General. Quantities for
 Clearing and Grubbing, Selective Clearing, and Clearing and
 Grubbing Trees as shown on the plans and in the Proposal shall be
 considered as final quantities and no further measurement will be
 required unless, upon evidence furnished by the Contractor,
 substantial variations exist between quantities shown on the plans
 and actual quantities. Measurements for revisions must be made
 before removing the part of the item in question.
 (b) Clearing, Grubbing, and Selective Clearing. Clearing
 and/or Grubbing will be measured by the acre (hectare) or by the
 station (metric station), as shown on the plans or designated by the
 Engineer. Selective Clearing will be measured by the acre (hectare).
 (1) Acre. Measurement will be to the nearest one hundredth
 of an acre (hectare) (0.01 acre) (0.01 ha) and will be determined
 by the horizontal measurement of each tract. The boundary of
 each tract will be a line extending along the outside of the trunks
 of the outermost trees or stumps.
 (2)Station (Metric Station). Measurement will be by the
 centerline station (metric station), rounded upward to the next
 whole station (metric station), and shall include all the area
 within the right-of-way including easements. When station
 (metric station) measurement is specified, a station (metric
 142
 
 201
 station) will be measured for payment when any tree meeting the
 requirements for clearing and/or grubbing is removed within that
 station (metric station).
 (c) Scalping. Scalping areas of existing vegetation and additional
 vegetation, resulting from work required by Section 110, will not be
 paid for separately, but full compensation therefor will be considered
 included in the contract unit prices bid for other items of the
 Contract.
 (d) Preserved Vegetation. Preserved vegetation areas shown on
 the plans or designated by the Engineer will not be measured for
 payment.
 (e) Clearing and Grubbing Trees. When specified, individual,
 isolated trees greater than 4" (100 mm) in diameter, measured 12"
 (0.3 m) above the ground, will be measured by each tree and/or
 stump removed.
 201.09 Basis of Payment. Clearing and Grubbing for borrow
 sites and material sources outside the right-of-way limits will not be
 paid for separately, but full compensation therefor will be considered
 included in the contract unit prices bid for the items being excavated
 for use on the roadway.

 203.01 Description. This work shall consist of the excavation,
 removal, and satisfactory disposal of underground storage tank
 systems and their contents at the locations specified. The work will
 also include the removal and disposal of portland cement or asphalt
 driveways, parking areas, sidewalks, curbs, islands, foundations, or
 slabs, when necessary for the removal of the tank.
 The Contractor is responsible for insuring that all work is
 executed and inspected in compliance with all local, State, or
 Federal codes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations applicable to
 the particular class of work.
 203.02 General Requirements. The attention of the bidder is
 directed to the necessity for careful examination of the entire site to
 determine, at the time of bid preparation, the full extent of work to
 be accomplished. The entire site shall be cleared of all man-made
 obstructions and debris, of whatever nature, and prepared in all
 respects for the construction of the highway facilities.
 The Contractor shall not unnecessarily interfere with the use of
 any adjacent sidewalks, streets, or roads.
 Salvage materials will become the property of the Contractor and
 shall be removed from the project site. The Contractor shall have no
 claim against the Department because of the absence of any
 preexisting materials, equipment, or fixtures from the items to be
 removed.
 203.03 Construction Requirements. The methods employed in
 148
 
 203
 performing the work shall be in compliance with 40 CFR § 280,
 Technical Standards and Corrective Action Requirements for
 Owners and Operators of Underground Storage Tanks (UST), and
 American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practice 1604, Second
 Edition, December 1987, Removal and Disposal of Used
 Underground Petroleum Storage Tanks.
 The Contractor shall perform measurements consisting of a visual
 inspection and a measurement using an EPA approved Organic
 Vapor Analyzer (OVA), and soil sample(s) where contamination is
 most likely to occur. The sample(s) shall be analyzed by a
 laboratory certified by the ADEQ for the presence of benzene,
 toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene (BTEX), using EPA
 Method 8021 or 8260, and for total hydrocarbons using ADEQ’s
 “Arkansas Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) for Soils.” The
 result of the soil analysis shall be provided to the ADEQ and the
 Engineer before any payment is made.
 The Contractor shall excavate outside the limits of the tank
 perimeter at least to that point where the OVA reading is less than
 100 ppm total hydrocarbons. If the limits of the original installation
 excavation can be determined, the excavation shall normally be
 made at least to the same limits. Excavation beyond the required
 limits made for the Contractor's convenience will not be measured or
 paid for.
 The Contractor will test the excavated material with the OVA and
 if the hydrocarbon levels are above 100 ppm the material shall be
 handled in one of the following methods:
 1) Deposited in a solid waste landfill provided that the material is
 accepted by the landfill operator, or
 2) Spread on an impermeable material and aerated until the
 hydrocarbon level is below 100 ppm. When the OVA reading has
 been reduced to below 100 ppm, the Contractor may then use the
 material in the backfill operation or dispose of it at an approved offsite location.
 If the visual inspection reveals only minor contamination and the
 OVA reading is less than 100 ppm total hydrocarbon, and the results
 of the soil sample analysis are within acceptable limits as determined
 
 149
 
 203
 by ADEQ, then the site shall be backfilled with suitable material and
 compacted as directed by the Engineer.
 If the excavated material is not suitable or is not sufficient in
 quantity for use as backfill material, the Contractor shall provide
 acceptable material for use as backfill.
 If tank systems not shown on the plans, free product, or extensive
 contamination are encountered, excavation and backfill activities
 will be suspended until a detailed site assessment and remediation
 plan can be developed by the Department. The Department may, at
 its option, delete all or any portion of the remaining work under this
 Section at that site.
 203.04 Method of Measurement. (a) Removal and Disposal of
 Underground Storage Tank Systems shall be measured by the unit, a
 unit being defined as one individual tank system which includes the
 tank and all lines connected to it.
 (b) Backfilling Underground Storage Tank Systems will be
 measured by the cubic yard (cubic meter). The measurement shall
 be made of the hole from which the tank was removed. The
 measurement shall be to the nearest whole cubic yard (cubic meter).
 Backfilling of trenches required to remove pipe lines will not be paid
 for separately, but full compensation therefor will be considered
 included in the contract unit price bid for Removal and Disposal of
 Underground Storage Tank Systems.
 (c) Excavation for Underground Storage Tank Systems will be
 measured by the cubic yard (cubic meter). The quantity shall be the
 same as the quantity for Backfilling Underground Storage Tank
 Systems, less the volume of the tank.
 (d) Treatment or Disposal of Excavated Material will be
 measured by the cubic yard (cubic meter). The measurement will be
 that portion of the excavated material for which the hydrocarbon
 levels are above 100 ppm when tested with the OVA.
 203.05 Basis of Payment. (a) Removal and Disposal of

 STRUCTURES
 205.01 Description. This item shall consist of the removal of
 existing bridge structures according to the plans and specifications
 and as directed.
 Removal of structures over which traffic will be maintained
 during the construction period shall be delayed until the new road
 has been completed and opened to traffic.
 205.02 Construction Requirements. Except when the plans
 designate that material from the existing bridge shall become the
 property of the Contractor, all material of serviceable quality shall be
 placed in a suitable location near the site as approved by the
 Engineer, and shall remain the property of the Owner. Torches may
 be used for dismantling steel bridges as approved by the Engineer.
 Nails and spikes shall be withdrawn from timber before being
 stacked.
 Bridge demolition shall be accomplished in such a manner that
 turbidity and sedimentation are minimized.
 The method of

 Contractor shall comply with all applicable requirements of Section
 110.
 Debris from bridge removal shall not enter the waterway unless
 approved as temporary or permanent fill allowed by a C of E 404
 permit and/or the U. S. Coast Guard. If material or debris resulting
 from the Contractor's operations does enter the waterway, the
 Engineer will make a determination based on the applicable permits
 whether or not the material may remain. If it is determined that the
 material is to be removed from the waterway, the Engineer must pre152
 
 205
 approve the Contractor's method of removal.
 When specified on the plans as "salvage for re-erection," all
 materials of serviceable quality shall remain the property of the
 Owner. The removal of the material from the project site shall be
 coordinated with Department Forces as directed by the Engineer.
 Pins, bolts, nuts, washers, and other metal parts shall be placed in
 well-sealed boxes. Structural members of truss spans shall be match
 marked and the distance center to center of shoes shall be accurately
 measured and marked on the lower chord before dismantling.
 Dismantling of steel bridges by using a torch will not be permitted
 when salvaged for re-erection. Care shall be exercised to avoid
 damaging or destroying any member or part of serviceable quality in
 dismantling the structure. Any member rendered unfit for further
 use through the carelessness of the Contractor shall be replaced at no
 cost to the Department.
 Unless otherwise designated on the plans or directed by the
 Engineer, substructure units shall be removed to a minimum depth
 of 2' (0.6 m) below subgrade or final ground surface, and to a greater
 extent if necessary to avoid interference with new construction work.
 Obstructions shall be removed from the established waterway.
 Material that is not salvaged shall be disposed of as provided in
 Subsections 104.07 and 201.04.

 REMOVING AND REPLACING BASE COURSE
 AND ASPHALT SURFACING
 209.01 Description. This item shall consist of the removal of the
 base course and asphalt surfacing, or the removal of base course
 alone, from detours or existing roadways, at the locations shown on
 the plans or as designated by the Engineer; the stockpiling of the
 material if necessary; the thorough mixing of the materials; and the
 replacement of the mixed materials on the subgrade, selected
 material course, or base course, as shown on the plans or as directed
 by the Engineer. This work shall be completed according to these
 specifications and in proper sequence with other work in the
 Contract.
 209.02 Construction Requirements.
 The Contractor shall
 scarify, break down, and mix all or any part of the ACHM material
 with the base course and handle according to the requirements of
 this Section. The volume of ACHM removed and replaced with the
 base course will be included in the measurement and payment under
 209.03 and 209.04.
 The Contractor shall have the option of removing and disposing
 the ACHM material. The ACHM material may be broken up and
 incorporated in an embankment provided that the material is mixed
 with the embankment material and kept at least 12" (0.3 m) below
 the finished grade. ACHM material shall not be placed in
 embankment areas where piling is to be placed or driven. If the
 contractor elects to use this option, removal and disposal of the
 ACHM material will be measured and paid for as unclassified
 excavation.
 When the asphalt surface consists of one or more layers of
 Asphalt Surface Treatment, the asphalt material shall be scarified,
 broken down, and thoroughly mixed with the base course material.
 159
 
 209
 The material may be removed and stockpiled pending
 construction of the subgrade, selected material course, or base
 course; or hauled directly and placed on the subgrade, selected
 material course, or base course that has been completed and
 accepted as to grade, width, and compaction. Care shall be
 exercised in removing the material so that soil from the subgrade is
 not included with the material. Replaced material shall be spread
 and compacted according to Section 303.
 If the material is placed in stockpiles, the sites of the stockpiles
 shall be clean and uniform, and the placing and removal of the
 materials shall be conducted in such manner that there will be a
 minimum of waste. Excessive material wasted during the removal
 and replacing operation shall be replaced at no cost to the
 Department.
 209.03 Method of Measurement. Removing and Replacing
 Base Course and asphalt surfacing will be measured by the cubic
 yard (cubic meter) by either of the following methods:
 Method No. 1. The material will be measured by the cross
 section method and volume computed by the average end area
 method. The material may be measured either in its original position
 or in a uniform windrow or stockpile, before being placed in its final
 position. When the material is measured in a windrow or stockpile,
 the computed volume will be reduced 30% for swell.
 Method No. 2. The material will be measured in vehicles
 according to Section 109. When measurement is made in vehicles,
 allowances will not be made for wastage of materials during
 transportation from the loading to the unloading point and the
 volume measured at the point of entry on the road will be reduced
 30% for swell. The Contractor shall level the loads adequately to
 ensure that each load contains the expected volume. The Engineer
 will inspect each load to check its volume.
 209.04 Basis of Payment. Work completed and accepted and
 measured as provided above will be paid for at the contract unit
 price bid per cubic yard (cubic meter) for Removing and Replacing
 Base Course and Asphalt Surfacing, which price shall be full
 compensation for removing the base course and asphalt surfacing
 from detours or existing roadways; for mixing the materials and
 stockpiling if necessary; for loading, hauling, and delivering on the
 160

 SECTION 210
 EXCAVATION AND EMBANKMENT
 210.01 Description. This item shall consist of excavation,
 construction of embankment, and disposal or compaction of all
 material that is encountered within the limits of the work not being
 removed under some other item. The work shall be accomplished in
 reasonably close conformity with the lines, grades, thicknesses, and
 typical cross sections shown on the plans or established by the
 Engineer. All excavation will be classified as common excavation,
 rock excavation, or unclassified excavation.
 210.02 Quality Control and Acceptance. It is the intent of
 these specifications that all embankments, fills, and backfills and the
 top 6" (150 mm) of the roadbed in cut sections shall be compacted to
 the specified density at or near the optimum moisture content. To
 that end, certain tests for quality control and acceptance shall be
 performed as specified herein. If the result of any test shows that the
 required minimum density has not been obtained, corrective action
 shall be taken. Such corrective action may include, but is not
 limited to, additional compactive effort; scarifying, adjusting
 moisture content and recompacting; or removal of unsuitable
 material and replacement with suitable material. Except for removal
 and replacement of unsuitable material below finished subgrade
 elevation in cut sections or below natural ground in fill sections, all
 corrective actions shall be performed by the Contractor at no cost to
 the Department.
 
 161
 
 210
 When the Engineer determines that the material is so rocky that it
 cannot be tested for density by the specified methods, acceptance
 will be as determined by the Engineer.
 (a) Quality Control.
 The Contractor shall determine the
 maximum laboratory density and optimum moisture content for each
 soil type encountered on the project. The maximum laboratory
 density will be determined according to Subsection 210.10. The
 Contractor shall furnish the Department split samples of each soil
 used to determine laboratory densities. The Engineer may require
 additional laboratory densities when significant changes in the soils
 encountered on the project are evident.
 The Contractor shall furnish all personnel, equipment, and
 facilities necessary to perform the required sampling and testing.
 The Contractor's facilities shall be separate from any Field
 Laboratory and/or Field Office furnished under the Contract. The
 Contractor shall provide the Engineer with the opportunity to
 observe all quality control sampling and testing. Quality control
 sampling and testing by the Contractor shall be performed in a
 qualified laboratory by a certified technician. Requirements for
 technician certification and laboratory qualification are contained in
 the Department’s Manual of Field Sampling and Testing
 Procedures. Test reports shall be signed and copies made available
 to the Engineer if requested.
 In-place densities shall be determined according to Subsection
 210.10.
 When the results of any test show that the minimum required
 density has not been obtained, corrective actions shall be taken,
 followed by a re-test in the same location. The original and re-test
 reports shall be cross-referenced.
 Establishing the frequency of sampling and testing for quality
 control is the Contractor's responsibility, however the Contractor
 will be required to make certain tests as specified in Subsection
 210.02(b).
 (b) Acceptance Testing.
 The Contractor shall perform
 acceptance testing using the same methods specified for quality
 control testing. Acceptance sampling and testing by the Contractor
 shall be performed in a qualified laboratory by a certified technician.
 Requirements for technician certification and laboratory
 162
 
 210
 qualification are contained in the Department’s Manual of Field
 Sampling and Testing Procedures. The item of work being tested
 shall not be considered complete or accepted until passing test
 reports are submitted to the Engineer.
 The minimum frequency of acceptance testing by the Contractor
 shall be one test for density and moisture content per each 3000
 cubic yards (2500 cu m) of embankment placed except that at least
 one test shall be performed on each layer of embankment. The
 location will be randomly selected by the Engineer using AHTD
 465. The results of all tests shall be at or above the minimum
 required density and the moisture content should be near the
 optimum. If the result of any test does not meet these requirements,
 corrective action shall be taken and a re-test will be taken at the
 same location.
 In addition to the required acceptance tests, the Engineer may
 require the Contractor to test any location that, by visual
 observation, appears to be defective.
 The Contractor’s acceptance sampling and testing procedures,
 equipment, and results will be subject to independent assurance
 sampling and testing conducted by the Department. Independent
 assurance sampling and testing will be conducted at the frequencies
 indicated in the Department’s Manual of Field Sampling and Testing
 Procedures. The Contractor shall be required to make changes to
 the equipment and/or procedures used if the results of the
 independent assurance tests do not correlate with the Contractor’s
 test results.
 All acceptance testing performed by the Contractor shall be
 subject to observation by Department personnel. All test reports
 shall be signed and submitted to the Engineer by the next business
 day after the tests are performed.
 The Department will obtain and test a minimum of one sample,
 taken at the frequency established in the Department’s Manual of
 Field Sampling and Testing Procedures, for verification testing in
 accordance with Subsection 106.11.
 (c) Measurement and Payment. All work required under this
 subsection will not be paid for separately, but full compensation
 
 163
 
 210
 therefor will be considered included in the contract unit prices bid
 for the various earthwork items included in the Contract.
 210.03 Vacant.
 210.04 Vacant.
 210.05 Classes of Excavation. (a) Common Excavation.
 Common excavation shall consist of all excavation not included as
 rock excavation or excavation that is otherwise classified.
 (b) Rock Excavation. Rock excavation shall consist of igneous,
 metamorphic, and sedimentary rock that cannot be excavated
 without blasting or the use of rippers, and all boulders or other
 detached stones each having a volume of 0.5 cubic yard (0.5 cu m)
 or more.
 (c) Unclassified Excavation. Unclassified excavation shall
 consist of the excavation and disposal of all materials of whatever
 character encountered in the work.
 210.06 Borrow. Borrow material shall consist of a soil, or a
 mixture of soil and stone or gravel or other acceptable material,
 reasonably free from sod, stumps, logs, roots, or other perishable or
 deleterious matter, and shall be capable of forming a stable
 embankment when compacted. The stone or gravel shall be of such
 size as not to interfere with compaction requirements specified in
 Subsection 210.10. Unless otherwise designated in the Contract, the
 Contractor shall make all arrangements for obtaining borrow and
 shall pay all costs involved. Also see the requirements of
 Sections 106 and 107.
 The Contractor shall notify the Engineer sufficiently in advance
 of opening any borrow areas so that cross section elevations and
 measurements of the ground surface after stripping may be taken.
 When requested in writing by the Contractor and approved by the
 Engineer, material may be obtained from the right-of-way and used
 in lieu of off-site borrow material. When the material is obtained
 within the limits of the Contract, payment will be made for material
 obtained from the right-of-way at either: 1) the unit price bid for
 Borrow, less an agreed royalty, or 2) the applicable item of
 excavation, whichever results in the lower cost to the Department. If
 the site is located outside the limits of the Contract, the material will
 be paid for at the unit price bid for Borrow, less an agreed royalty.
 164
 
 210
 For the purposes of this paragraph, the phrase "limits of the
 Contract" is defined as the entire right-of-way, including easements,
 between the beginning and ending stations of the project outside the
 limits of excavation shown on the plans or as changed by the
 Engineer for any purpose other than obtaining additional material.
 On projects where there are designated exceptions, the beginning
 and ending stations shall be the beginning and ending stations of the
 exceptions. Included in the planned excavation will be any
 excavation made beyond the beginning and ending stations that is
 made for the purpose of blending the new construction to the
 existing roadway, whether shown on the plans or not.
 210.07 Construction Requirements.
 The excavation and
 embankments for the roadway, intersections, and entrances shall be
 finished to reasonably smooth and uniform surfaces. No materials
 shall be wasted unless they are surplus to the needs of the project or
 are deemed unsuitable by the Engineer, and only with the permission
 of the Engineer. Before beginning excavation, grading, and/or
 embankment operations in any area, all necessary work in that area
 shall have been performed according to Sections 201, 202, and 203,
 except that some removal items in Section 202 (e.g., curb, culverts,
 etc.) may be removed simultaneously and in coordination with
 excavation operations, provided such delay in removal of these items
 does not adversely affect the proper completion of excavation and
 construction of embankments.
 Unless otherwise specified, rock shall be excavated to a
 minimum depth of 8" (200 mm) and not to exceed a maximum depth
 of 12" (300 mm) below subgrade within the limits of the roadbed,
 and the excavation backfilled with material designated on the plans
 or approved by the Engineer. Care shall be taken that undrained
 pockets shall not be left in the surface of the rock.
 Borrow material should not be placed until after the roadway
 excavation has been placed in the fill. If the Contractor places more
 borrow than is required and thereby causes a waste of excavation,
 the amount of such waste will be deducted from the borrow volume
 as measured in the borrow area. All borrow areas shall comply with
 Section 106.
 Obliteration of old roadways may include excavation and rough
 grading of the old roadway and/or the addition of borrow to restore
 approximately the original contour of the ground or to produce a
 165
 
 210
 pleasing appearance by forming natural, rounded slopes. Roadway
 obliteration will be paid for as excavation and/or borrow as
 appropriate.
 Unless otherwise provided for on the plans or in the
 specifications, the removal of any existing base course or asphalt
 pavement necessary for constructing new pavement connections, or
 of asphalt paving in existing island locations or other areas not
 specifically addressed, will be measured and paid for as unclassified
 excavation.
 When the Contractor's excavation operations encounter a
 restraining condition as defined in Subsection 107.10, operations
 shall be temporarily discontinued. Work in the area shall not resume
 until the disposition of the restraining condition has been
 accomplished.
 Where natural ground conditions or excavation to the finished
 grade section results in a subgrade or slopes of unsuitable soil, the
 Engineer may require the Contractor to undercut the unsuitable
 materials and backfill with approved material to the elevation
 designated by the Engineer. The Engineer may designate as
 unsuitable those soils that cannot be stabilized in place through
 normal drying and compactive efforts when satisfactory weather and
 ground conditions exist. Normal drying and compactive effort shall
 be considered to be the work required in processing and compacting
 the natural ground (including the bottom of a cut section) to a
 maximum depth of 12" (300 mm) after the soil is brought to near
 optimum moisture content. Undercut directed by the Engineer will
 be measured and paid for under the appropriate classification of
 excavation. The Contractor shall conduct construction operations so
 that the Engineer can take the necessary measurements before the
 backfill is placed.
 In the construction of embankment, grading operations shall be
 conducted, as far as practicable, so that the most suitable soil is
 placed in the top layer of the embankment. To that end, the
 Engineer may order specific excavated materials, either from the
 regular roadway section or from borrow pits, placed in stockpiles for
 future use. Material thus stockpiled shall be measured in its original
 position and paid for at the contract unit price for Common
 Excavation, Unclassified Excavation, or Borrow, as the case may be.
 All material removed from the
 stockpile for placement in the
 166
 
 210
 embankment shall be measured in the stockpile by the conventional
 cross section method and payment for the second handling in
 removing from the stockpile and placing in the roadway
 embankment will be paid for at the contract unit price for Common
 Excavation or Unclassified Excavation, as the case may be. No
 adjustment will be made for shrinkage or swell.
 It is intended that the right-of-way be left in a neat and
 presentable condition at the completion of the grading work, and
 especially that it be left in a condition that can be economically
 mowed where terrain will permit. To that end, stump holes, piles of
 loose material, and other scars on the surface shall be dressed by use
 of a motor patrol or other suitable equipment. No direct payment
 will be made for this work but it shall be considered as a part of the
 several items of excavation.
 Particular care and discretion shall be exercised in the location
 and use of haul lanes through tree screens in order to preserve
 existing growth. Haul lanes shall have prior approval by the
 Engineer.
 210.08 Excavation Operations. All suitable material removed
 from the excavation shall be used, as far as practicable, in the
 formation of the embankment, in the subgrade, slopes, and
 shoulders, and at such other places as directed. Unsuitable material
 removed may be placed on the slopes or other locations on the
 project if designated by the Engineer. No payment will be made for
 any excavated material that is used for purposes other than those
 designated, except as provided under Subsection 104.06.
 All excess or unsuitable excavated material that cannot be used in
 embankments may be placed on the side slopes of the nearest fill in
 a satisfactory manner and shall be placed so as to maintain a distinct
 shoulder line by generally keeping all such material at least 24"
 (0.6 m) below the subgrade elevation.
 Excavated material that cannot be utilized as described above
 shall be hauled away and disposed of by the Contractor. Selection
 and procurement of sites for the disposal of material removed from
 the project shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. Sites used
 for the disposal of unused material shall be left in a neat and
 presentable condition.
 The Contractor shall have a written
 agreement with the property owner, and shall comply with the
 167
 
 210
 requirements of Subsection 107.10 and Section 110. Work involved
 in disposing of the material, including obtaining the sites, hauling,
 seeding and stabilization, and complying with Section 110, will not
 be paid for separately, but full compensation therefor will be
 considered included in the contract unit price(s) bid for the
 appropriate classification(s) of excavation.
 Except in solid rock or other materials that in the judgment of the
 Engineer require a modified slope, all slopes shall be trimmed to the
 slopes shown in the cross section drawings, and care must be
 exercised so that no material shall be loosened below the required
 slopes. All roots, stumps, and other foreign matter in the sides and
 bottoms of the ditches or drainage outlets shall be removed or cut to
 conform to the slope, grade, and shape of the section shown. Side
 ditches shall be excavated reasonably true to lines, grades, and cross
 sections as shown on the plans or as directed.
 When excavating in rock, at locations shown on the plans or
 designated by the Engineer, a presplit or breakline shall be produced
 along the cut slope, except presplitting will not be required in cuts
 less than 6' (2 m) in depth. When blasting rock in cuts less than 6'
 (2 m) in depth, a reasonably uniform face shall be left, regardless of
 whether the excavation is carried beyond the specified slope. All
 breakage and slide materials shall be removed by the Contractor and
 disposed of as directed.
 The presplitting or breakline involves a single row of holes
 drilled along the neat excavation line and the blasting charge fired
 before any adjoining main excavation area is blasted. To establish
 the breakline, holes for presplitting shall be so spaced and of such
 diameter that they can be properly loaded and tamped so as to
 produce a relatively smooth plane along the designated backslope
 before shooting the interior portion of the cut. The exact spacing
 and diameter shall be determined by the Contractor to accomplish
 the desired finished section and shall be changed if the pattern of
 drilling and blasting fails to do so. In the event the cut is too deep
 for the presplitting to be done in one operation, an 18" (0.5 m) offset
 or bench will be allowed for each succeeding line of drill holes.
 Presplitting operations shall be discontinued when the rock face is of
 such character that no apparent advantage is gained.
 The presplit slope face shall not deviate more than 1' (0.3 m)
 from a plane passing through
 adjacent drill holes, except
 168
 
 210
 where the character of the rock is such that, as determined by the
 Engineer, irregularities are unavoidable. The 1' (0.3 m) tolerance
 shall be measured perpendicular to the plane of the slope. In no case
 shall any portion of the slope encroach on the roadbed.
 The Contractor's attention is called to the fact that where traffic
 must be maintained, all necessary precautions shall be taken to
 protect the traveling public during blasting operations. The
 Contractor will be required to comply with all Federal, State, and
 local laws and regulations pertaining to the storage and use of
 explosives.
 The Engineer shall, at all times, have the authority to prohibit or
 halt the Contractor's blasting operations if it is apparent that through
 the methods being employed, the required slopes are not being
 obtained in a stable condition or the safety and convenience of the
 traveling public is being jeopardized.
 Boulders and rock fragments not incorporated in embankments
 shall not be left scattered about over the right-of-way but shall be
 disposed of as directed. Payment will be made for the removal of
 such material from its original position only.
 All rock on the cut face that is loose, hanging, or that creates a
 potentially dangerous situation shall be removed or stabilized, to the
 Engineer's satisfaction, during or upon completion of the excavation
 in each lift. Drilling of the next lift will not be allowed until this
 work has been completed.
 210.09 Embankment Construction. Embankment construction
 shall consist of constructing roadway embankments, including
 preparation of the areas upon which they are to be placed; the
 construction of dikes within or outside the right-of-way; the placing
 and compacting of approved material within roadway areas where
 unsuitable material has been removed; and the placing and
 compacting of embankment material in holes, pits, and other
 depressions within the roadway area. Only approved materials shall
 be used in the construction of embankments and backfills.
 Rocks, broken concrete, or other solid materials shall not be
 placed in embankment areas where piling is to be placed or driven.
 When embankment is to be placed and compacted on hillsides, or
 when new embankment is to be compacted against existing
 169
 
 210
 embankments, or when embankment is built ½ widths at a time, the
 slopes shall be continuously benched as the work is brought up in
 layers. Benching shall be of sufficient width to permit operations of
 placing and compacting equipment. Each horizontal cut shall begin
 at the intersection of the original ground and the vertical sides of the
 previous cuts. Unless otherwise specified, material thus cut out shall
 be recompacted along with the new embankment material at no cost
 to the Department. If the Engineer directs such material to be
 wasted or placed in another location, the excavated material will be
 measured and paid for under the appropriate item of excavation.
 Unless otherwise shown on the plans, where an embankment less
 than 3' (1 m) in height is to be made, all sod and vegetable matter
 shall be removed from the surface upon which the embankment is to
 be constructed and later placed on the completed embankment
 slopes. The cleared surface shall then be completely broken up by
 plowing, scarifying, or disking to a minimum depth of 6" (150 mm).
 The area shall then be recompacted and stabilized according to
 Subsection 210.10.
 Whenever a compacted road surface containing asphalt or
 granular material lies within 3' (1 m) of the subgrade, such old road
 surface shall be scarified to a depth of at least 6" (150 mm). This
 scarified material shall then be recompacted to a stable condition.
 If embankment material can be deposited on one side only of
 abutments, wing walls, piers, or culvert headwalls, care shall be
 taken that the area immediately adjacent to the structure is not
 compacted to the extent that it will cause overturning or excessive
 pressure against the structure. When noted on the plans, the fill
 adjacent to the end bent of a bridge shall not be placed higher than
 the bottom of the backwall of the bent until the superstructure is in
 place. When embankment is to be placed on both sides of a concrete
 wall or box type structure, operations shall be conducted so that the
 embankment is always at approximately the same elevation on both
 sides of the structure.
 Roadway embankment shall be placed in parallel layers not
 exceeding 10" (250 mm), loose measurement, and shall be
 compacted as specified and stable before the next layer is placed.
 Effective spreading equipment shall be used on each lift to obtain
 uniform thickness before compacting. As the compaction of each
 layer progresses, continuous
 leveling and manipulating will
 170
 
 210
 be required to assure uniform density. Water shall be added or
 removed, as necessary, to obtain the required density. Construction
 equipment shall be routed uniformly over the entire surface of each
 layer. The Contractor shall be responsible for the stability of each
 layer. The material in each layer will be considered stable when it
 will not rut and/or pump under construction operations.
 When the excavated material consists predominantly of rock
 fragments of such size that the material cannot be placed in layers of
 the thickness prescribed, such material may be placed in the
 embankment in layers not exceeding in thickness the approximate
 size of the larger rocks (30" [750 mm] maximum). Rock or boulders
 too large to permit placing in 30" (750 mm) layers shall be reduced
 in size as necessary to permit this placement. The 12" (300 mm) of
 the embankment immediately below finished subgrade may be
 placed in one layer with no rock exceeding 10" (250 mm) in its
 greatest dimension. Each layer shall be constructed so that rock
 voids are substantially filled with rock fines and/or earth. The rock
 shall be placed and manipulated in uniform layers and rock fines
 and/or earth shall be distributed throughout each embankment layer
 and manipulated as herein indicated. Rock shall not be end dumped
 over the edges of the layer being constructed, but shall be deposited
 on the layer and moved ahead so as to advance the layer with a
 mixture of rock fines and/or earth.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for the stability of all
 constructed embankments and shall restore, at no cost to the
 Department, any portions that have become displaced due to
 carelessness or negligent work. After the completion of a section of
 roadway, it shall be maintained at finished grade and cross section
 by blading when and to the extent directed by the Engineer.
 In those portions of embankments that are immediately adjacent
 to structures or are for other reasons inaccessible to the compaction
 equipment in use, only suitable material shall be used and it shall be
 placed in successive parallel layers of not more than 6" (150 mm)
 thickness, loose measurement. Each layer shall be uniformly mixed
 and compacted to the requirement of the specific item using
 mechanical equipment. Hand tamping will not be permitted.
 
 171
 
 210
 Embankments shall be constructed in sections of not less than
 200' (60 m) in length, or the full length of the embankment if less
 than 200' (60 m).
 210.10 Compaction Requirements. The natural ground surface
 on which an embankment less than 3' (1 m) in height is to be
 constructed, the roadbed through sections in excavation, and all
 embankments shall be compacted as described in this subsection.
 Compaction will not be required in cleared areas where grubbing is
 not required and it is impractical to work compaction equipment.
 All equipment, tools, and machinery used on this work shall be
 suitable for the soil to be compacted, and shall be maintained in
 good operating condition. Unless otherwise provided, compaction
 of earthwork shall be accomplished by any satisfactory method or
 methods that will obtain the density hereinafter specified.
 The material in each layer of embankment shall be compacted to
 a uniform density of not less than 95% of the maximum laboratory
 density. Specified density will not be required immediately adjacent
 to wingwalls of box culverts.
 Percent coarse particles retained on the #4 (4.75 mm) sieve shall
 be determined according to AASHTO T 27 and the maximum
 laboratory density determined as follows:
 % Retained - #4 (4.75 mm) Sieve
 Test Method
 10 Max.
 AASHTO T 99, Method A
 11 - 30
 AASHTO T 99, Method C
 31 Min.
 AASHTO T 180, Method D
 Note: Instead of AASHTO T 224, correction for coarse
 particles retained on the 3/4" (19.0 mm) sieve shall be
 determined by replacing with an equal mass of material
 passing the 3/4" (19.0 mm) sieve and retained on the #4
 (4.75 mm) sieve.
 The in-place density shall be determined by using AASHTO
 T 310, Direct Transmission.
 The moisture content shall be
 determined by AASHTO T 310 or AHTD Test Method 347 or 348.
 The moisture content of the material being compacted through
 out each entire layer shall be substantially that of optimum moisture
 of the particular soil type. It shall be the responsibility of the
 Contractor to bring the moisture content throughout each layer of the
 172
 
 210
 embankment to be compacted to substantially that of optimum
 moisture by the addition of water or by aeration as may be necessary
 to increase or decrease moisture under the conditions encountered.
 The density of the embankment shall be obtained and maintained
 or restored before placing a subsequent layer of embankment, base
 course, or surfacing.
 The following procedures are to be followed in securing the
 required compaction:
 The embankment shall be constructed to grade over the full width
 in uniform layers parallel to the finished surface and not more than
 10" (250 mm) in thickness, loose measure. Each layer shall have the
 moisture content and be compacted to meet the requirements herein
 before provided. The maximum depth of layer as specified may be
 modified by the Engineer as particular conditions justify, such as the
 placing of the first layer over marshy area, or on slopes too steep for
 the operation of equipment. In such areas the embankment may be
 constructed in one layer to the minimum elevation at which
 equipment can be operated and above such elevation the layers shall
 not exceed the specified maximum thickness of 10" (250 mm), loose
 measure.
 Density requirements will not apply to portions of embankment
 constructed of material so rocky that it cannot be satisfactorily tested
 according to the above requirements. In such cases, the extent of
 compactive effort by rolling will be determined by the Engineer
 based upon the amount of breakage and consolidation that can be
 accomplished. When the nature of the material is such that
 consolidation by rolling is impractical, rolling will not be required.
 After the roadbed has been excavated to line and grade, the
 surface shall be loosened to a minimum depth of 6" (150 mm) below
 the finished elevation, the entire area within the limits of the roadbed
 section processed, the material brought within the range of optimum
 moisture content, compacted, and stabilized to meet the
 requirements of these specifications. The section shall be reshaped
 to conform to the typical section during the compaction operation.
 When the roadbed is excavated from solid rock and backfilled
 with material conforming to the definition for Common Excavation
 
 173
 
 210
 or Unclassified Excavation, or with Borrow, the backfill shall be
 compacted as provided above.
 Work involved in compaction as required by this subsection will
 not be paid for separately, but full compensation therefor will be
 considered included in the contract unit prices bid for the various
 classes of excavation and/or borrow.
 210.11 Compacted Embankment. When the item "Compacted
 Embankment" is included in the Contract, the following provisions
 shall apply.
 All excavation and embankment shall be constructed to
 reasonably close conformity with the lines, grades, thicknesses, and
 typical cross sections shown on the plans or established by the
 Engineer.
 All suitable excavated material may be used in part or in total to
 construct the embankments within the areas of Compacted
 Embankment or it may be removed from the project and the
 embankments constructed with new material meeting the
 requirements of Borrow.
 Embankment shall be constructed and compacted according to
 Subsections 210.09 and 210.10.
 Where excavation to the finished grade section results in a
 subgrade or slopes of unsuitable material, the Engineer may require
 the Contractor to undercut the unsuitable material and backfill to the
 finished grade section with approved material. The excavation of
 unsuitable material will be measured and paid for under the
 appropriate classification of excavation and the backfill will be paid
 for as Compacted Embankment using the same measurements.
 Material used to replace that removed by scalping areas of
 vegetation and/or mulch cover, resulting from work required by
 Section 110, will be paid for as Compacted Embankment. The
 Engineer may determine the volume by the average end area method
 or by measuring the average length, width, and depth of removal.
 Borrow will not be paid for separately, but full compensation
 therefor will be considered included in the contract unit prices bid
 for Compacted Embankment and/or the appropriate classification of
 excavation. All work involved in excavation and construction of
 embankments will be measured and paid for as provided for in
 174
 
 210
 Subsections 210.12 and 210.13 under the appropriate items of
 excavation, presplitting, and compacted embankment. Excavation
 or embankment constructed outside the plan limits without the
 specific approval of the Engineer will not be included in the
 measurement of excavation or embankment and will not be paid for.
 210.12 Method of Measurement. (a) All accepted excavation
 and borrow will be measured in its original position by the cross
 section method or survey break line method, field collected or by
 using photogrammetric procedures. Volumes shall be computed by
 the average end area method to determine the amount of material
 removed. Measurements will include overbreakage or slides not
 attributable to carelessness of the Contractor, authorized excavation
 of solid rock below grade, and unsuitable materials below grade
 (undercut). When measuring quantities of undercut below subgrade,
 the Engineer may determine the volume of the excavation by
 measuring the average length, width, and depth of the excavation.
 On projects with small quantities of borrow, and when approved
 in writing by the Engineer, borrow may be measured in vehicles
 according to Subsection 209.03, Method 2.
 All quantities will be determined to the nearest whole cubic yard
 (cubic meter).
 (b) Presplitting will be measured by the square yard (square
 meter) of plane surface of the final presplit cut face. The
 measurement will be subject to reduction because of avoidable
 overbreakage resulting from excessive blasting.
 (c) Compacted Embankment when included in the Proposal will
 include all approved fill within the right-of-way or construction
 easement limits and will be measured in its final position by the
 cross section method or survey break line method, either field
 collected or by using photogrammetric procedures, and computed by
 the average end area method to determine the amount of fill volume
 required to complete the work according to the plans or as directed
 by the Engineer.
 (d) When any pay item under this Section is shown on the plans,
 contract, or otherwise specified as plan quantity, the quantities for
 such items shall be considered as final quantities and no further
 measurement will be made except for undercutting of unsuitable
 material and backfilling with appropriate material. These final
 quantities will be revised if, in the opinion of the Engineer or upon
 175
 
 210
 evidence furnished by the Contractor, substantial variations exist
 between the quantities shown on the plans and the actual quantities
 due to changes in alignment, grade, typical section, or apparent
 errors. If field measurement of quantities designated on the plans as
 plan quantity is deemed necessary, the change in the method of
 measurement will be documented by an approved change order and
 the Contractor shall allow the Engineer sufficient time to collect the
 necessary original field data, if required, before any earthwork is
 begun.
 (e) Hauling of excavation material for placement in embankments
 or waste areas will not be paid for separately, but full compensation
 therefor will be considered included in the contract unit price(s) bid
 for the various classifications of excavation. Hauling of Borrow will
 not be paid for separately, but full compensation therefor will be
 considered included in the contract unit price bid for Borrow.
 (f) For all earthwork to be measured, the Engineer shall have the
 following options:
 •
 •
 •
 •
 
 to obtain original and/or final cross sections in the field or by
 photogrammetric methods,
 to use as original cross sections the preliminary cross
 sections used in the design of the project,
 to use templated final cross sections in lieu of cross sections
 taken in the field,
 to use an electronic computer program to compute quantities
 from terrain models developed from field and/or
 photogrammetric data.
 
 210.13 Basis of Payment. (a) The quantities of the various
 classes of excavation and for Borrow completed and accepted and
 measured as provided above will be paid for at the Contract unit
 price bid per cubic yard (cubic meter) for Common Excavation,
 Rock Excavation, Unclassified Excavation, or Borrow, as the case
 may be, which price shall be full compensation for excavation; for
 drilling and blasting; for formation of embankment; for compaction
 of earthwork; for performing quality control and acceptance
 sampling and testing; for furnishing and applying water and aerating
 of soils; for trimming of slopes; for disposal of surplus material; for

 SECTION 212
 SUBGRADE
 212.01 Description.
 This item shall consist of shaping,
 compacting, and otherwise preparing the completed roadbed for the
 placing of base and surface courses and pavements according to
 these specifications and in substantial conformity with the lines,
 grades, and cross sections shown on the plans.
 212.02 Construction Requirements. (a) General. The subgrade
 shall be prepared in such a manner as to ensure that the base, surface
 course, or pavement will be placed on a firm foundation that is
 stable and reasonably free from dust pockets, wheel ruts, or other
 defects.
 The subgrade area shall be scarified as necessary for shaping, and
 shaped and compacted to the required grade and section. A
 maximum deviation of ½” (13 mm), plus or minus, from the
 required grade will be permitted on the surface of the finished
 subgrade. Quality control and acceptance testing shall be according
 to Section 210 except that the minimum frequency of acceptance
 testing for density and moisture shall be one test per each 12,000
 square yards (10,000 sq m) of subgrade area. The minimum depth
 of testing shall be 8" (200 mm) with the gauge in the direct
 transmission mode.
 The in-place density shall not be less than 95% of the maximum
 laboratory density. The maximum laboratory density will be
 determined according to Subsection 210.10. In-place densities shall
 be determined according to Subsection 210.10.
 Compaction shall be accomplished by any satisfactory method or
 methods that will obtain the density. The Contractor shall bring the
 moisture content of the material to be compacted to substantially
 that of optimum moisture by the addition of water or by
 manipulation and aeration as necessary to increase or decrease the
 moisture content under the conditions encountered.
 When the subgrade is to be stabilized with lime or portland
 cement, the top 8" (200 mm) shall be compacted before treatment to
 the extent necessary to prevent rutting under normal operation of
 construction equipment.
 Compaction operations may be omitted when an old stone or
 178
 
 212
 gravel roadbed is used as a foundation or subgrade for a base course
 or pavement where scarifying for shaping is unnecessary and its
 stability is approved by the Engineer.
 Existing asphalt surface course in place shall be scarified and the
 material broken down to a maximum size of 2" (50 mm) and shaped
 and compacted to a stable condition and to the required grade and
 section after being thoroughly mixed with any base course material
 that may be in place unless the Engineer considers the existing
 surface suitable for retention.
 All soft and yielding material and other portions of the subgrade
 that will not compact readily when rolled or tamped shall be
 removed. Holes or depressions made by the removal of unsuitable
 material as directed above shall be filled with approved material and
 the entire subgrade brought to the lines, grade, and cross section
 shown on the plans and compacted to the required density.
 If the succeeding course is not placed immediately after the
 subgrade has been prepared and the subgrade becomes cut up, rough,
 or unstable, it shall again be shaped and recompacted according to
 the above requirements.
 (b) Subgrade for Portland Cement Concrete Base or
 Pavement (Forms). Portions of the subgrade composed of
 unsuitable materials shall be removed as directed, backfilled with
 approved material, and the entire subgrade brought to line and grade
 and compacted as specified above.
 The subgrade shall be prepared for the paving by shaping and
 compacting to the full width according to the typical section shown
 on the plans. The material obtained in excess of that required for
 shaping due to variations in elevation shall be used to complete the
 shoulders, widen the roadbed, flatten the slopes, or be disposed of as
 shown on the plans or directed by the Engineer. After shaping, the
 entire area within the form lines shall be compacted to the required
 density. Any portion of the subgrade that is not accessible to normal
 compaction equipment shall be thoroughly compacted with manually
 operated mechanical tampers.
 After the subgrade has been prepared and consolidated and the
 forms set and accepted, the surface of the subgrade shall be tested
 for crown and elevation using an approved scratch template held in a
 vertical position and moved backward and forward on the side
 179
 
 212
 forms. The scratch template shall be so designed that the ends of the
 prongs will indicate the true position of the subgrade when the
 template is riding on the forms. Excess material indicated by the
 scratch template shall be removed. The use of a scratch template
 will not be required on subgrades or subbases constructed of
 materials other than earth or sand, but the required degree of
 accuracy on the subgrade or subbase surface shall be obtained by
 other approved methods.
 To bring low areas up to the correct subgrade elevation, approved
 material shall be furnished and tamped or rolled until the filled
 material is as thoroughly compacted as the surrounding subgrade on
 which no additional material has been placed. The surface of low
 areas may require scarifying before adding and compacting the
 additional fill material, Ruts and depressions caused by hauling
 shall be filled and consolidated as they develop. As a final check of
 subgrade conditions, a template or planer shaped to the true cross
 section of the bottom of the pavement shall be drawn on the forms
 immediately ahead of concrete operations and any excess material
 shall be removed before the concrete is placed. Low places in the
 subgrade, as indicated by the final check, shall be filled with
 concrete and no additional compensation will be allowed for the
 extra quantities of concrete involved, or shall be filled with approved
 material and compacted to required density.
 If the succeeding course is not placed immediately after the
 subgrade has been prepared and the subgrade becomes cut up, rough,
 or unstable, it shall again be shaped and recompacted according to
 the above requirements.
 212.03 Method of Measurement and Basis of Payment. On
 paving or surfacing projects that include the construction of the
 roadbed, the scarifying, blading, shaping, compacting, and other
 work necessary to bring the roadbed to the requirements of these
 specifications will not be paid for separately, but full compensation
 therefor will be considered included in the contract unit prices bid
 for the various classes of excavation or the placing of the base
 course, surface course, pavement, or shoulders as applicable.
 Replacement of material removed by scalping areas of vegetation
 and/or mulch cover, resulting from work required by Section 110,
 will be paid for under the appropriate item as provided in the plans
 or in the Contract.
 180
 
 213
 On paving or surfacing projects that do not include the
 construction of the roadbed, the removal and disposal of
 unsatisfactory material and additional material hauled in as required
 to fill holes or depressions in the roadway or otherwise correct
 deficiencies in grade or typical section will be measured and paid for
 under the appropriate item as provided on the plans or in the
 Contract. When only small quantities of additional material are
 required, measurement thereof may be made in vehicles according to
 Subsection 209.03, Method 2.
 
 SECTION 213
 SHAPING ROADWAY SECTION
 213.01 Description. This item shall consist of modifying the
 existing roadway to conform substantially to the typical section
 shown on the plans. This work shall include excavating and hauling
 or drifting subgrade material necessary in widening the existing
 roadway, making minor cuts and fills, and/or shaping and dressing
 the surface, shoulders, ditches, foreslopes, and backslopes to provide
 a uniform and well-drained subgrade, all according to the plans and
 these specifications or as directed.
 213.02 Construction Requirements. Before the work is started,
 all grass, weeds, or rubbish of any nature that may be considered
 deleterious, shall be removed from within the construction limits and
 disposed of as directed.
 Material obtained from shaping the ditches and slopes shall be
 spread over the existing roadway to a uniform grade. The grade of
 the existing roadway shall not be changed except as made necessary
 by the material obtained from the ditches and slopes. Deviations
 may be permitted so long as the grade constructed is free from sharp
 breaks, dips, and ridges and will provide a uniform riding surface.
 Sight distances over hill crests shall not be impaired.
 The crown width of the roadway shall not be less than the
 roadway width shown on the plans. Sections of roadway with a
 crown width greater than the typical section shall not be reduced in
 crown width unless necessary to secure satisfactory ditches and
 slopes.
 181
 
 213
 Foreslopes and backslopes may be variable to the extent feasible
 to aid balancing the earthwork, but no slope shall be steeper than the
 maximum shown on the plans.
 Should there develop any depressions or narrow embankments
 where the material obtained from shaping the ditches and slopes is
 insufficient to construct a satisfactory roadway, sufficient additional
 material shall be obtained and placed under the provisions of
 Subsection 210.06 to bring the roadway to a satisfactory section.
 Compaction of the roadbed shall comply with the requirements of
 Subsection 210.10. Quality control and acceptance testing shall be
 according to Section 210.

 LIME TREATED SUBGRADE
 301.01 Description. This item shall consist of treating the
 existing subgrade with water and lime according to these
 specifications and in substantial conformity with the lines, grades,
 compacted thickness, and cross section shown on the plans.
 301.02 Composition. The mixture shall be composed of the soil
 in the existing subgrade, lime, and water. The mixture shall contain
 not more than 8% by weight of lime. At least 30 days before the
 beginning of lime treatment, adequate quantities of soil and lime
 shall be supplied to the Materials Division for determination of lime
 requirements. The Engineer will specify, based on laboratory tests,
 the exact percentage of lime to be used.
 The type of lime used shall be either quicklime or hydrated lime
 as shown in the Contract.
 301.03 Materials. The materials shall comply with the following
 requirements:
 (a) Water. All water used in mixing shall be clean and free from
 injurious amounts of oil, salt, or other deleterious substances, and
 shall be free of vegetable matter or other foreign materials.
 (b) Lime. The lime shall comply with AASHTO M 216.
 (c) Soil. The soil shall be the soil in the existing subgrade.
 301.04 Construction Requirements. (a) Preparation of
 Subgrade. Before beginning the lime treatment, the subgrade shall
 be shaped to the required grade and section and compacted to
 sufficient density to prevent rutting under normal operation of
 construction equipment. Soft areas shall be corrected to provide
 uniform stability before lime application.
 Any material in
 temporary cross roads, bridge approaches, or other areas that
 extends above the elevation of the proposed subgrade shall be
 removed and disposed of, as directed.
 (b) Preparation of Soil. The proposed roadbed shall be scarified
 to the depth and width indicated on the plans for the subgrade
 treatment. The scarified material shall be partially pulverized. The
 depth of scarification shall be carefully controlled and operations
 188
 
 301
 conducted in a manner to provide that the subgrade material below
 the depth of the proposed treatment shall remain undisturbed.
 (c) Application of Lime. The rate of application of lime shall be
 as determined by laboratory design or as directed. Hydrated lime
 may be applied to the partially pulverized material either in a slurry
 or in the dry condition. Quicklime (slurry) shall be applied to the
 partially pulverized material in a slurry. Quicklime (dry) shall be
 applied to the partially pulverized material in the dry condition.
 Spreading shall be accomplished by adding either the slurry or dry
 lime uniformly to the surface of the material. Spreading equipment,
 including truck spreaders, shall be of a type and design capable of
 uniformly distributing the lime without excessive loss.
 No equipment, except water trucks and that equipment used for
 spreading and mixing, shall be permitted to pass over the spread
 lime until it is mixed with subgrade material.
 Any procedure that results in excessive loss or displacement of
 the lime shall be immediately discontinued.
 (d) Addition of Water. Water shall be applied to the spread
 lime immediately after placing to moisten the lime and form a dust
 palliative. Water shall be added during mixing operations to
 moisten the mixture but the total water added to the mixture
 including that added to form a slurry shall not exceed the optimum
 by more than 5%.
 (e) Mixing. Mixing may be accomplished by means of rotary
 tillers, pulvimixers, or other mechanical equipment. The first stage
 of the mixing process shall continue until the lime and moisture are
 thoroughly and uniformly dispersed throughout the mixture. After
 this has been completed, the surface shall be rolled with pneumatic
 rollers until sealed sufficiently to shed rain.
 After the first mixing stage, the mixture shall be allowed to set
 for a minimum of 3 days or until the mixture becomes friable.
 During this period, the surface shall be sprinkled as necessary to
 keep it moist.
 After this period, the mixture shall be scarified and thoroughly
 and uniformly mixed with rotary tillers or pulvimixers until the soil
 is thoroughly pulverized and mixed with the lime. During the
 mixing, water shall be added to keep the moisture within ±2% of the
 optimum.
 189
 
 301
 (f) Compaction. After the materials have been satisfactorily
 mixed and pulverized, the full depth of the mixture shall be
 compacted to a uniform density of not less than 95% of the
 maximum laboratory density. Percent coarse particles retained on
 the #4 (4.75 mm) sieve shall be determined according to AASHTO
 T 27. The maximum laboratory density shall be determined as
 follows:

 determined by replacing with an equal mass of material passing
 the 3/4" (19.0 mm) sieve and retained on the #4 (4.75 mm)
 sieve.
 The in-place density shall be determined by using AASHTO
 T 310, Direct Transmission.
 The moisture content shall be
 determined by AASHTO T 310 or AHTD Test Method 347 or 348.
 Sprinkling may be necessary during the compaction to maintain the
 desired moisture content. Compaction shall be accompanied by
 sufficient blading to eliminate surface irregularities and to maintain
 the required section.
 (g) Finishing. During the final stages of the compaction, the
 surface of the subgrade shall be shaped to the lines, grades, and
 cross sections shown on the plans. When required, the surface may
 be lightly scarified and bladed. Final rolling of the completed
 surface shall be accomplished with a pneumatic roller.
 301.05 Maintenance. The Contractor shall, at no cost to the
 Department, maintain the treated subgrade until the next course is
 applied. The maintenance shall be considered as part of the
 processing of the treated subgrade.
 301.06 Seasonal and Temperature Limitations. Application of
 lime will not be permitted when the surface temperature is below
 50° F (10° C), nor shall it be applied before April 1 or subsequent to
 a date in October sufficiently early to give reasonable assurance that
 all mixing, spreading, and rolling will be complete on or before
 October 31, except by written permission of the Engineer.

 Note: Instead of AASHTO T 224, correction for coarse
 particles retained on the 3/4" (19.0 mm) sieve shall be
 determined by replacing with an equal mass of material passing
 201
 
 306
 the 3/4" (19.0 mm) sieve and retained on the #4 (4.75 mm)
 sieve.
 The in-place density shall be determined by using AASHTO
 T 310, Direct Transmission.
 The moisture content shall be
 determined by AASHTO T 310 or AHTD Test Method 347 or 348.
 A new maximum laboratory density and optimum moisture will be
 determined whenever the Engineer deems necessary or upon
 evidence provided by the Contractor.
 The Contractor shall furnish all personnel, equipment, and
 facilities necessary to perform the required sampling and testing.
 The Contractor's facilities shall be separate from any Field
 Laboratory and/or Field Office furnished under the Contract. The
 Contractor shall provide the Engineer with the opportunity to
 observe all quality control sampling and testing. Quality control
 sampling and testing by the Contractor shall be performed in a
 qualified laboratory by a certified technician. Requirements for
 technician certification and laboratory qualification are contained in
 the Department’s Manual of Field Sampling and Testing
 Procedures. Test reports shall be signed and copies made available
 to the Engineer if requested.
 If the result of any test shows that the required minimum density
 has not been obtained, corrective action shall be taken, followed by
 a re-test at the same location. The original and re-test reports shall
 be cross referenced. All corrective actions shall be performed by the
 Contractor at no cost to the Department.
 Tests for gradation, liquid limit, and plasticity index shall be
 performed by AASHTO T 11, T 27, T 89, and T 90.
 Although no minimum frequency of quality control testing is
 specified, the Contractor will be required to perform acceptance tests
 as specified in Subsection 306.03.
 306.03 Acceptance Testing. Acceptance testing for thickness
 (when specified on the plans), gradation, plasticity index, density,
 and moisture content by the Contractor will be based on lots. The
 size of standard lots will be 1000 tons (1000 metric tons). Partial
 lots, of any size, may be established by the Engineer at any time.
 Test methods for acceptance shall be the same as specified for
 quality control testing. Acceptance sampling and testing by the
 Contractor shall be performed in a qualified laboratory by a certified
 technician. Requirements for technician certification and laboratory
 202
 
 306
 qualification are contained in the Department’s Manual of Field
 Sampling and Testing Procedures. The item of work being tested
 shall not be considered complete or accepted until passing test
 reports are submitted to the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall take one test for all properties in each lot or
 partial lot at a location randomly selected by the Engineer under
 AHTD Test Method 465.
 If the material being furnished is crushed stone and the results of
 the first five tests for plasticity index (PI) show that the material is
 non-plastic, further tests for PL, LL, and PI may be waived by the
 Engineer. If a change in material occurs, testing for PI will be
 resumed. If the new material is crushed stone and the results of the
 first five tests for PI show that the material is non-plastic, further
 tests for PL, LL, and PI may again be waived by the Engineer.
 In addition to the required acceptance tests, the Engineer may
 require the Contractor to test any location that, by visual
 observation, appears to be defective.
 The Contractor’s acceptance sampling and testing procedures,
 equipment, and results will be subject to independent assurance
 sampling and testing conducted by the Department. Independent
 assurance sampling and testing will be conducted at the frequencies
 indicated in the Department’s Manual of Field Sampling and Testing
 Procedures. The Contractor shall be required to make changes to
 the equipment and/or procedures used if the results of the
 independent assurance tests do not correlate with the Contractor’s
 test results.
 All acceptance testing performed by the Contractor shall be
 subject to observation by Department personnel. All test reports
 shall be signed and submitted to the Engineer by the next business
 day after the tests are performed.
 The Department will obtain and test a minimum of one sample,
 taken at the frequency established in the Department’s Manual of
 Field Sampling and Testing Procedures, for verification testing in
 accordance with Subsection 106.11.
 306.04 Acceptance.
 herein.
 
 Each lot will be accepted as described
 
 (a) Gradation and Plasticity Index. (1) Roadway Sampled
 Material. If a lot or a partial lot fails gradation requirements, the
 203
 
 306
 Contractor shall remove and replace that lot or partial lot with
 acceptable material at no cost to the Department. Tests will be
 performed on the replacement material as required for the original
 material. Acceptance of the replacement material will be the same
 as for the original material, based on the results of tests on the
 replacement material. Payment for the quantity in the original lot
 will be withheld or recovered, and released after the removal and
 replacement has been acceptably performed.
 In lieu of removal and replacement of work rejected for
 gradation, the Contractor may request permission to attempt
 corrective actions and/or evaluation under Section 105.04. The
 Engineer will consider the request and will make a determination
 whether the requested corrective action and/or evaluation is in the
 best interest of the Department. This determination by the Engineer
 shall be final. In making this determination, the Engineer will
 consider the type of work involved; the corrective action proposed,
 the magnitude of the deviation; and any other factors deemed
 applicable to the work involved.
 If a lot or partial lot is rejected for PI, the Contractor may request
 permission to attempt corrective action. The Engineer will consider
 the request and make a determination whether the proposed
 corrective action may be attempted; evaluate the material under
 Section 105; or require removal and replacement of the material.
 Corrective action or removal and replacement shall be performed by
 the Contractor at no cost to the Department.
 When the material is non-plastic and tests for PI have been
 waived as specified in Subsection 306.03, the material will be
 accepted for PI without additional testing.
 (2) Stockpile Sampled Material. Material used in mixes shall
 be sampled from the stockpile, tested, and accepted before being
 incorporated into the work. Stockpiled material found not to be in
 compliance with the specifications shall be replaced with acceptable
 material.
 (b) Density. When a density requirement is specified, the results
 of all tests shall be at or above the minimum required density and
 the moisture content should be at or near the optimum. If the result
 of any test does not meet these requirements, corrective action shall
 be taken and a re-test will be taken at the same location. All
 204
 
 307
 corrective action shall be taken by the Contractor at no cost to the
 Department.
 306.05 Measurement and Payment. All work required under
 this subsection will not be paid for separately, but full compensation
 therefor will be considered included in the contract unit prices bid
 for the item in which the material is being used.
 
 SECTION 307
 CEMENT TREATED
 BASE COURSE
 307.01 Description. This item shall consist of a treated base
 course, composed of a compacted mixture of existing subgrade or
 soil aggregate, Portland cement, and water, and shall be constructed
 according to these specifications and in substantial conformity with
 the lines, grades, compacted thickness, and typical cross section
 shown on the plans.
 Unless otherwise provided, the Contractor may use either the
 travel plant or central plant method as described below.
 307.02 Composition. The mixture shall be composed of existing
 subgrade, base course and surface course materials, and/or an
 imported soil aggregate, with Portland cement and water added.
 The mixture shall contain not less than 4% cement by volume of
 compacted mixture, 94 pounds (1420 kg) of cement being
 considered as 1 cubic foot (1 cu m ). At least 30 days before the
 beginning of stabilizing operations, adequate quantities of soil and
 cement shall be supplied to the Materials Division for determination
 of cement requirements. The Engineer will specify, based on
 laboratory tests, the exact percentage of cement to be used.
 Specimens of soil aggregate, cement, and water shall develop a
 compressive strength of a least 400 psi (2.7 MPa) in 7 days.
 307.03 Materials. The materials used shall comply with the
 following requirements:
 (a) Water. Water used in mixing or curing shall be clean and
 free from injurious amounts of oil, salt, or other deleterious
 substances. Where the source of water is relatively shallow, it shall
 205
 
 307
 be maintained at such a depth and the intake so enclosed as to
 exclude grass, vegetable matter, or other foreign materials.
 (b) Cement.
 Unless otherwise specified, portland cement
 conforming to the requirements of AASHTO M 85, Type I shall be
 furnished. One of the following blended cements may be used in
 lieu of Type I:
 • Portland-Pozzolan Cement, AASHTO M 240, Type IP (20%
 maximum)
 • Slag-Modified Portland Cement, AASHTO M 240, Type IS
 (25% maximum)
 Fly ash or slag cement shall not be substituted for blended
 cements. Cement shall be from sources that are listed on the
 Department’s Qualified Products List and that have executed a
 certification agreement with the Department. When cement is
 furnished in sacks, each sack shall contain not less than 94 pounds
 (42.6 kg) of cement.
 Fly ash or slag cement shall comply with Subsection 501.02(f).
 Fly ash or slag cement may be used as a partial replacement for the
 cement. Replacement amounts, not exceeding 25% by weight, shall
 be determined through trial batch investigations using the specific
 materials proposed for the project. Mixtures with fly ash or slag
 cement shall meet the same requirements as mixtures without fly
 ash/ slag cement. All trial batches required by this specification
 shall be accomplished by the Contractor, observed by the Engineer,
 and approved by the Engineer of Materials. Mixing of Class C and
 Class F fly ashes will not be permitted. Fly ash will not be allowed
 as a substitute for high early strength or blended cements.
 For in-place stabilization, the fly ash/ slag cement and cement
 shall be blended to form a homogeneous mixture before application
 on the roadway.
 The use of cement salvaged from used or discarded sacks will not
 be allowed. Cement placed in storage shall be suitably protected.
 Any loss of quality occurring during the storage period will be cause
 for rejection. If the cement furnished shows erratic behavior under
 the field conditions incident to the mixing and placing of the
 mixture, or in the time of the initial or final set, the Contractor will
 at once, without notice from the Engineer, cease the use of that
 brand of cement and furnish material of such properties as to ensure
 quality work conforming to these specifications.
 206
 
 307
 (c) Soil Aggregate. Soil aggregate shall meet the requirements
 of Subsection 302.02 for any class provided therein.
 (d) Asphalt.
 (1) Emulsified asphalt shall comply with Subsection 403.03(d)
 for Grade CSS-1 or CSS-1h.
 (2) Medium curing cut-back asphalt shall comply with
 Subsection 403.03(b) for the grade selected by the Engineer.
 (3) Rapid curing cut-back asphalt shall comply with
 Subsection 403.03(a) for the grade selected by the Engineer.
 The type of asphalt used for protection and cover for the treated
 base course shall be at the option of the Contractor, subject to the
 Engineer's approval.
 307.04 Construction Requirements. Sufficient equipment shall
 be available so that the work may proceed in proper sequence to
 completion without unnecessary delay. Equipment, tools, and
 machinery used shall be maintained in a satisfactory working
 condition.
 The application of cement and mixing of the cement and soil
 aggregate will be allowed only on an approved subgrade, free of
 excess moisture. No work will be allowed on a frozen subgrade.
 The Contractor's operations shall be such as to prevent the drifting
 of cement or dust off the right-of-way.
 (a) Preparation of the Roadbed. Prior to other construction
 operations, the existing roadbed, including the shoulders, shall be
 brought to line and grade and shaped to the typical cross section of
 the completed roadbed and compacted to sufficient density to
 prevent rutting under normal operations of construction equipment.
 All soft areas shall be corrected to provide uniform stability. When
 soil aggregate is utilized, the subgrade shall be prepared according
 to Section 212.
 (b) Pulverizing. After shaping and compacting the roadbed, the
 material to be processed shall be scarified and pulverized before
 application of cement. Pulverizing shall continue during mixing
 operations until a minimum of 80% by weight of the material,
 exclusive of coarse aggregate, will pass a #4 (4.75 mm) sieve.
 Material retained on a 3" (75 mm) sieve and other unsuitable
 material shall be removed.
 207
 
 307
 (c) Application and Mixing of Cement. The application and
 mixing of cement with the aggregate material shall be performed
 according to one of the following methods:
 (1) Travel Plant Method. The specified quantity of cement
 shall be applied uniformly on the material to be processed, and
 shall not exceed that which can be processed the same working
 day. When bulk cement is used the equipment shall be capable
 of handling and spreading the cement in the required amount.
 The moisture content of the material to be processed shall be
 sufficiently low to permit a uniform and intimate mixture of the
 aggregate material and cement.
 Mixing shall be accomplished by means of a self-propelled or
 self-powered machine equipped with a mechanical rotor or other
 approved type of mixer that will thoroughly blend the aggregate
 with the cement. Mixing equipment shall be so constructed as to
 assure positive depth control. Care shall be exercised to prevent
 cement from being mixed below the depth specified. Machines
 designed to process less than the full width of base at a single
 pass shall be operated so that the full width of base can be
 compacted and finished in one operation. Water shall be
 uniformly added and incorporated in the mixture. The water
 supply and distribution equipment shall be capable of supplying
 the total required amount of water to the section being processed
 within 3 hours. If more than one pass of the mixer is required, at
 least one pass shall be made before water is added. Mixing shall
 continue after all water has been applied until a uniform mixture
 of aggregate, cement, and water has been obtained for the full
 depth of the course.
 The aggregate and cement mixture that has not been
 compacted and remains undisturbed more than 30 minutes shall
 be remixed. In the event of rain adding excessive moisture to the
 uncompacted material, the entire section shall be reworked.
 Should the Contractor be unable to finish the section within the
 same day, the section shall be reconstructed and an amount equal
 to 50% of the original amount of cement added to the mixture at
 no cost to the Department.
 (2) Central Plant Method. When a central plant is used, the
 soil aggregate, cement, and water shall be mixed in a pugmill
 either of the batch or continuous flow type. The plant shall be
 equipped with feeding and metering devices that will add the soil
 208
 
 307
 aggregate, cement, and water into the mixer in accurately
 proportioned amounts as determined by the laboratory design.
 Aggregate and cement shall be dry-mixed sufficiently to prevent
 cement balls from forming when water is added. Mixing shall
 continue until a uniform mixture of aggregate, cement, and water
 has been obtained.
 The mixture shall be hauled to the roadway in trucks equipped
 with protective covers. Immediately before spreading the
 mixture, the subgrade or foundation course shall be moistened
 and kept moist, but not excessively wet, until covered by the
 mixture. The mixture shall be placed on the roadbed in a uniform
 layer by an approved spreader or spreaders. No more than
 60 minutes shall elapse between adjacent spreader runs and not
 more than 60 minutes shall elapse between the time of mixing
 and the beginning of compaction. The layer shall be uniform in
 depth, and in such quantity that the completed base will conform
 to the required grade and cross section. Dumping of the mixture
 in piles or windrows will not be permitted.
 (d) Compaction and Surface Finish. The mixture shall be
 compacted to a density, as determined by AASHTO T 310, Direct
 Transmission, of not less than 95% of the maximum laboratory
 density obtained by AASHTO T 134. The moisture content of the
 mixture during compaction shall not vary more than ±5% from the
 optimum moisture as determined by AASHTO T 134.
 The surface of the treated roadway shall be reshaped to the
 required lines, grade, and cross section after the mixture has been
 compacted. It shall then be scarified lightly to loosen any imprints
 left by the compacting or shaping equipment and rolled thoroughly.
 The operation of final rolling shall include the use of pneumatic
 tired rollers. The rolling shall be done in such manner as to produce
 a smooth, closely knit surface, free of cracks, ridges, or loose
 material, and conforming to the crown, grade, and line shown on the
 plans.
 The density, surface compaction, and finishing operation shall
 not require more than two hours.
 Water shall be added, if necessary, during the finishing operation
 to maintain the mixture at the proper moisture content for securing
 the desired surface.
 209
 
 307
 Areas inaccessible to rollers or finishing and shaping equipment
 shall be thoroughly compacted to the required density by other
 approved compacting methods and shaped and finished as specified.
 (e) Joints. As soon as final compaction and finishing of a section
 has been completed, the base shall be cut back perpendicular to the
 center line to a point where uniform cement content with proper
 density has been attained and where the vertical face conforms to the
 typical section shown on the plans. When the road mix method is
 used, a header shall be placed against the vertical face of the
 finished section and securely staked in place. This header shall be
 left in place until all mixing operations on the adjoining section have
 been completed, after which the header shall be removed and the
 trench backfilled with processed material. This material shall be
 compacted so that a well-sealed joint is formed and a smooth riding
 surface is obtained.
 As an alternate to using a header, the subsequent day's operation
 may be started by cutting back into the previously placed course to
 the extent necessary to obtain uniform grade and compaction.
 (f) Surface Test. The finished surface of the treated base course
 shall conform to the general surface provided for by the plans. It
 shall not vary more than ¼" (6 mm) from a 10' (3 m) straightedge
 applied to the surface parallel to the center line of the roadway, nor
 more than ½" (12 mm) from a template conforming to the cross
 section shown on the plans. Excess material shall be disposed of as
 directed.
 (g) Protection and Cover. Immediately after the rolling and
 shaping has been completed, the surface of the treated base course
 shall be covered by a protective coating of asphalt to prevent loss of
 moisture during the curing period and to serve as a prime coat for
 the later application of wearing course. The asphalt shall comply
 with the requirements listed herein and shall be applied by means of
 an approved pressure distributor at the rate of 0.1 to 0.3 gallon per
 square yard (0.4 to 1.1 L/sq m) to provide complete coverage
 without excessive runoff. The actual rate of application will be
 determined by the Engineer. When used, emulsified asphalt shall be
 diluted with an equal amount of water before application. At the
 time of application, the base shall be in a moist condition. The
 protective coating of asphalt shall be maintained until the wearing
 surface is placed. If the condition of the protective coating is
 210
 
 307
 satisfactory, no additional prime coat will be required at the time of
 placement of the wearing surface.
 Furnishing and placing asphalt will not be paid for separately, but
 full compensation therefor will be considered included in the
 contract unit price bid for Processing Cement Treated Base Course.
 Finished portions of the roadway adjacent to construction that is
 traveled by equipment used in constructing an adjoining section
 shall be protected by means satisfactory to the Engineer. If earth
 covering is used on fresh bases, straw, hay, building paper, or
 similar material shall be placed under the earth so that the covering
 may be removed without damage to the base.
 307.05 Maintenance. The Contractor shall, within the limits of
 the Contract, maintain the treated base material in good condition
 until all work has been completed and accepted. Maintenance shall
 include immediate repairs of any defects that occur. This work shall
 be done at no cost to the Department and repeated as often as may
 be necessary to keep the area continuously intact. Faulty work shall
 be replaced for the full depth of treatment. The Contractor shall
 construct the plan depth of cement treated base in one homogeneous
 mass. The addition of thin treated layers to provide the minimum
 specified depth will not be permitted.
 307.06 Seasonal and Temperature Limitations. Application of
 cement will not be permitted when the surface temperature is below
 40° F (5° C), nor shall it be applied before April 1. Application of
 cement shall be terminated sufficiently early to give reasonable
 assurance that all mixing, spreading, rolling, and curing of the
 cement treated base course and the application of the subsequent
 asphalt courses can be complete on or before the following dates,
 except by written permission of the Engineer:

 constructed on the completed and accepted subgrade according to
 these specifications and in conformity with the lines, grades,
 compacted thickness, and typical section shown on the plans or as
 directed by the Engineer.
 308.02 Composition. (a) Cement Content. The quantity of
 cement, approximately 3 to 8% by weight, to be used with the
 aggregate and water shall be determined by the Engineer. The
 moisture in the mix shall be maintained within a range of ±1% of
 optimum.
 (b) Laboratory Tests. Specimens of aggregate, cement, and
 water must develop a compressive strength of at least 750 psi
 (5.2 MPa) in 7 days.
 At least 30 days before beginning base construction, adequate
 quantities of materials shall be supplied to the Materials Division for
 determination of mix proportions. The Department will determine
 
 213
 
 308
 the quantity of cement, the optimum moisture, and the maximum
 laboratory density and furnish this information to the Contractor.
 308.03 Materials. Materials used in the mixture shall comply

 Subsection 403.03(a) for the grade selected by the Engineer.
 The type of asphalt used for protection and cover for the cement
 stabilized base course shall be at the option of the Contractor,
 subject to the Engineer's approval.
 308.04 Construction Requirements. (a) Weather Limitations.
 The cement stabilized base shall not be mixed or placed while the
 214
 
 308
 atmospheric temperature is below 40° F (5° C) or when the weather
 is rainy.
 (b) Equipment. Sufficient equipment shall be available so that
 the work may proceed in proper sequence to completion without
 unnecessary delay. Equipment, tools, and machinery used shall be
 maintained in a satisfactory working condition.
 (c) Forms. When forms are required, they shall comply with
 Subsection 501.07.
 (d) Subgrade. The subgrade shall be prepared according to the
 typical sections on the plans before placement of base. When the
 subgrade is constructed under the same Contract as the base, the
 subgrade shall be prepared according to Section 212. When the
 subgrade is constructed under a separate contract, preparation of the
 subgrade shall be according to Section 214.
 (e) Mixing. Mixing shall be accomplished at a central mixing
 plant by either batch or continuous mixing. The aggregates and
 cement may be proportioned either by weight or by volume.
 The plant shall be equipped with feeding and metering devices
 that will add the aggregate, cement, and water into the mixer in the
 specified quantities. Aggregate and cement shall be dry-mixed
 sufficiently to prevent cement balls from forming when water is
 added. Mixing shall continue until a uniform mixture of aggregate,
 cement, and water has been obtained.
 In all plants, cement shall be added in such a manner that it is
 uniformly distributed throughout the aggregates during the mixing
 operation.
 The charge in a batch mixer, or the rate of feed into a continuous
 mixer, shall not exceed that which will permit complete mixing of
 all the material.
 To compute the mixing time in a continuous mixer, the weight of
 its contents at operating level is divided by the weight of the mixture
 delivered per second by the mixer:
 ‫݁݉݅ܶ	݃݊݅ݔ݅ܯ‬, ‫ ݏ݀݊݋ܿ݁ݏ‬ൌ
 
 ܲ‫ݕݐ݅ܿܽ݌ܽܿ	݀ܽ݁݀	݈݈݅݉݃ݑ‬, ݈ܾ	ሺ݇݃ሻ
 ܱ‫ݐݑ݌ݐݑ‬, ݈ܾ	ሺ݇݃ሻ	‫݀݊݋ܿ݁ݏ	ݎ݁݌‬
 
 The pugmill for the continuous mixer shall be equipped with a
 surge hopper containing sufficient baffles and gates to prevent
 215
 
 308
 segregation of material discharged into the truck and to allow for
 closing of the hopper between trucks without requiring shut down of
 the plant.
 (f) Placing and Compacting. The subgrade surface, if dry, shall
 be moistened but not to the extent of producing a muddy condition
 at the time the base mixture is placed. Placing of the base course
 shall begin along the high point of the pavement on a crowned
 section or on the high side of a pavement sloping in one direction.
 Proportioned and mixed materials shall be transported to the
 point of delivery in approved non-agitating equipment. Covers shall
 be provided for protection during transport.
 The material shall be spread on the prepared underlying course to
 such depth that, when thoroughly compacted, it will conform to the
 grade and dimensions shown on the plans.
 The materials shall be spread by a self-propelled spreading
 machine or similar method approved by the Engineer. Sufficient
 equipment shall be provided to obtain full width spreading of the
 base material. If, in the judgement of the Engineer, full width
 placement is not desirable, the base shall be constructed in partial
 widths. If the time elapsing between the placing of adjacent partial
 widths exceeds 30 minutes, a construction joint satisfactory to the
 Engineer shall be provided. Such joints shall be offset a minimum
 of 12" (300 mm) from a planned concrete pavement joint.
 The equipment and methods employed in spreading the base
 material shall ensure accuracy and uniformity of depth and width. If
 conditions arise where such uniformity in the spreading cannot be
 obtained, the Engineer may require additional equipment or
 modification in the spreading procedure to obtain satisfactory
 results.
 Immediately upon completion of the spreading operations, the
 base material shall be thoroughly compacted. Self-propelled rollers,
 in sufficient number, size, and type shall be provided to obtain the
 specified results. Care shall be exercised in routing construction
 equipment to avoid the formation of unnecessary ridges due to
 wheel tracks or tractor treads. If necessary, the base material after
 compaction shall be trimmed by means of a self-propelled motor
 grader to the grade and section shown on the plans. All material
 loosened in this operation shall be swept from the surface before any
 further rolling. Finishing operations shall continue until the surface
 216
 
 308
 is true to the specified cross section and until the surface shows no
 variations of more than ¼" (6 mm) from a 10' (3 m) straightedge laid
 in any location parallel with, or at right angles to, the longitudinal
 axis of the pavement.
 No equipment or traffic shall be permitted on the finished base
 course during the first 72 hours of the curing period, except for
 minor maneuvering to enable the Contractor to begin the next day’s
 work, not to exceed 25' (8 m).
 After the base course is 7 days old, one lane in each direction
 may be used as a haul road, at the Contractor's own risk. Any
 damaged areas resulting from this operation shall be removed and
 replaced at no cost to the Department. Loaded trucks will be
 permitted to back onto the base to unload.
 (g) Construction Joints. At the end of each day's run a
 transverse construction joint shall be formed by a header or by
 cutting back into the compacted material to form a true transverse
 vertical face. These faces shall be protected by banking damp earth
 against them or by other approved suitable methods.
 The protection provided for construction joints shall permit the
 placing, spreading, and compacting of base material without injury
 to the work previously placed.
 When a longitudinal construction joint is required in partial width
 construction, side forms shall be used or the joint shall be formed by
 cutting back into the compacted material to form a vertical edge.
 Suitable curing shall be provided for any exposed longitudinal edge.
 Joints shall be offset from a planned longitudinal pavement joint a
 minimum of 12" (300 mm).
 Care shall be exercised to ensure thorough compaction of the
 base material immediately adjacent to all construction joints.
 (h) Protection and Curing. After the base course has been
 finished as specified herein, it shall be protected against drying for 7
 days by the application of asphalt material. The curing methods
 shall begin as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after the
 completion of finishing operations. The finished base course shall
 be kept reasonably clean and continuously moist until the curing
 material is placed.
 The asphalt material specified shall be uniformly applied to the
 moist surface of the completed base course at the rate of
 217
 
 308
 approximately 0.2 gallon per square yard (0.75 L/sq m) using
 approved heating and distributing equipment. The exact rate and
 temperature of application to give complete coverage without
 excessive runoff will be specified by the Engineer.
 Should it be necessary for construction equipment or other traffic
 to use the asphalt covered surface before the asphalt material has
 dried sufficiently to prevent pickup, sufficient granular cover shall
 be applied before such use.
 The curing material shall be maintained and applied as needed by
 the Contractor during the 7 day protection period so that all of the
 base course is covered effectively during this period.
 Finished portions of base course that are used by equipment in
 constructing an adjoining section shall be protected in such a
 manner as to prevent equipment from marring or damaging the
 completed work.
 When the air temperature may be expected to drop to the freezing
 point, sufficient protection from freezing shall be given the base
 course for 7 days after its construction and until it has hardened.
 (i) Cold Weather Protection. During cold weather, when the air
 temperature may be expected to drop below 35° F (2° C), a
 sufficient supply of hay, straw, or other material suitable for cover
 shall be provided at the site. Any base that has been damaged by
 freezing shall be removed and replaced at no cost to the Department.
 (j) Tolerance in Base Thickness. The base course shall be
 constructed according to the typical sections on the plans ±½"
 (12 mm) in thickness. Sections over ½" (12 mm) deficient in
 thickness shall be removed and replaced at no cost to the

 sampling and testing conducted by the Department. Independent
 assurance sampling and testing will be conducted at the frequencies
 indicated in the Department’s Manual of Field Sampling and Testing
 Procedures. The Contractor shall be required to make changes to
 the equipment and/or procedures used if the results of the
 independent assurance tests do not correlate with the Contractor’s
 test results.
 The Department will obtain and test a minimum of one sample
 taken at random from each lot, including partial lots, to be used both
 for verification and for acceptance. The location of the lot sample
 will be determined by the Department using AHTD Test Method
 465. Verification testing will be conducted in accordance with
 Subsection 106.11 and the Manual of Field Sampling and Testing
 Procedures.
 Acceptance sampling and testing by the Contractor shall be
 performed in a qualified laboratory by a certified technician.
 Requirements for technician certification and laboratory
 qualification are contained in the Department’s Manual of Field
 Sampling and Testing Procedures. Acceptance sampling and testing
 shall be accomplished in a timely manner. The Contractor shall
 maintain records of all samples taken and the results of all tests
 performed. Signed copies of these records shall be furnished to the
 220
 
 308
 Engineer on the next business day after the tests are performed. The
 item of work being tested shall not be considered complete or
 accepted until all test reports are submitted to the Engineer.
 (d) Acceptance and Adjustments in Payments. Acceptance and
 adjustment will be by lot.
 Acceptance of a standard lot shall be based on complying test
 results for thickness and gradation and the average compressive
 strength testing results meeting a minimum of 750 psi (5.2 MPa) in
 7 days. The average result will include the sublot results of tests
 performed by the Contractor and the results of the lot test performed
 by the Department.
 For a lot or sublot to be considered for acceptance and
 adjustments, each core shall achieve not less than 70% of the
 minimum compressive strength specified at 7 days. In the sublot
 containing the Department’s lot test, if the result of either the
 Contractor’s sublot test or the Department’s lot test is below the
 minimum compressive strength specified, the two results will be
 averaged and the average of the two test results used to determine
 acceptance or rejection.
 If the average compressive strength of the cores is less than the
 minimum compressive strength specified, adjustments will be made
 by reducing the contract price for the items of Aggregate in Cement
 Stabilized Crushed Stone Base Course, Cement in Cement
 Stabilized Crushed Stone Base Course, and Processing Cement
 Stabilized Crushed Stone Base Course on a lot basis according to

 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS
 SECTION 401
 PRIME AND TACK COATS AND EMULSIFIED
 ASPHALT IN BASE COURSE
 401.01 Description.
 This item shall consist of a single
 application of asphalt material and blotter material, if required,
 applied to the completed and approved subgrade, to the base course,
 or on the existing asphalt or concrete surface according to these
 specifications and in reasonably close conformity with the lines
 shown on the plans or as directed.
 401.02 Materials. Materials shall conform with the requirements
 provided under Section 403. A medium curing cut-back asphalt will
 be used for prime coat and a rapid curing cut-back or an emulsified
 asphalt will be used for tack coat. Emulsified asphalt conforming to
 grades SS-1, SS-1h, CSS-1, or CSS-1h shall be used for emulsified
 asphalt in base course. Dependent upon the texture of the base and
 the season of the year that work is being performed, the Engineer
 will select the particular grade of the type of asphalt material that
 will be used.
 401.03 Construction Requirements. The methods employed in
 performing the work, and all equipment, tools, and machinery used
 in handling materials and executing any part of the work shall be
 subject to the approval of the Engineer before the work is started,
 and whenever found unsatisfactory, shall be changed and improved
 as required. All equipment, tools, and machinery used shall be
 maintained in a satisfactory working condition and shall meet the
 requirements of Section 403.
 The surfaces of all structures shall be protected by some
 satisfactory method to prevent their being disfigured by the
 application of asphalt material. Objectionable asphalt discoloration,
 caused by the Contractor's operations, shall be removed from all
 roadway and bridge structures at no cost to the Department.
 (a) Cleaning. If needed, the surface to be treated with prime or
 tack coat shall be cleaned of dust, dirt, and loose or foreign material
 by sweeping with mechanical brooms immediately preceding the
 application of the prime or tack coat. Care shall be taken to clean
 229
 
 401
 but not loosen or dislodge the embedded aggregate in base courses.
 Patches of asphalt, dirt, or other material that do not form an integral
 part of the surface to be treated shall be removed. When directed,
 the surface shall be sprinkled with water and given an additional
 sweeping.
 The cleaning operations shall be carried only far enough in
 advance of the application of the asphalt material to ensure the
 surface being properly prepared at the time of application. When the
 existing surface is an old concrete pavement, excess joint and crack
 filler shall be removed from the surface.
 (b) Application of Prime Coat. After the surface to be treated
 has been prepared as outlined above, the asphalt material for the
 prime coat shall be sprayed uniformly over the surface by means of
 an approved mechanical pressure distributor at the rate of
 application indicated on the plans, or as directed.
 Surplus asphalt material collected in surface depressions shall be
 removed.
 Following the application of the prime coat, the road will be
 closed to traffic, if practicable, for a period of time sufficient to
 allow the proper curing of asphalt coating. Prime coat shall be
 allowed to cure a minimum of 3 days before any successive
 application of asphalt material. However, the minimum three day
 curing time may be waived when, in the opinion of the Engineer, the
 prime has sufficiently cured to allow placement of successive
 courses . No material for a succeeding course shall be placed on a
 primed base course until the prime coat has cured sufficiently to
 prevent damage by hauling operations. When shown on the plans or
 directed by the Engineer, the prime coat shall be applied in half
 widths in order to allow free passage of public traffic at all times.
 Prime coat shall not be applied when the air temperature is below
 45° F (7° C), nor shall it be applied to a surface having excess
 moisture, nor when general weather conditions, in the opinion of the
 Engineer, are not suitable. Special precautions shall be observed to
 ensure a uniform distribution of the asphalt material. The distributor
 shall be so adjusted and operated as to distribute evenly the material
 being applied. Deposits of asphalt material upon the road surface in
 excess of the quantity specified, caused by stopping or starting the
 distributor, by overflow, leakage, or otherwise, shall be removed.
 230
 
 401
 The asphalt material shall be applied at the temperature specified
 in Section 403. The distributor shall be operated at a pressure of not
 less than 30 psi (200 kPa) nor more than 70 psi (500 kPa). The
 Contractor shall provide the necessary facilities for determining the
 temperature of the asphalt material in the heating equipment and in
 the distributor, for determining the rate of application, and for
 securing uniformity of distribution at longitudinal and transverse
 joints.
 If the primed surface becomes damaged, such areas shall be
 cleaned or patched and re-treated at no cost to the Department.
 At the Contractor's option, Emulsified Asphalt in Base Course,
 constructed according to the provisions of Subsections 401.02 and
 401.03(d), may be substituted in lieu of Prime Coat. Payment for
 this substitution will be made as Prime Coat.
 (c) Application of Tack Coat. When an asphalt course is to be
 laid on an asphalt or concrete surface, a tack coat shall be applied
 prior to placing the course. The tack coat shall be applied by means
 of a pressure distributor in the same manner as outlined above for
 the application of prime coat. When emulsified asphalt is used it
 shall be diluted with water as directed. The asphalt material shall be
 applied at the temperature specified in Section 403. The rate of
 application shall be from 0.03 gallon to 0.10 gallon per square yard
 (0.1 L/sq m to 0.5 L/sq m) as designated by the Engineer. The tack
 coat shall be applied sufficiently in advance of the asphalt course to
 allow the proper curing of the asphalt material but shall not be
 applied so far in advance as to lose its adhesiveness as a result of
 being covered with dust or foreign material. If the tack coat
 becomes damaged or covered with foreign material, such areas shall
 be cleaned as necessary and re-treated at no cost to the Department.
 (d) Application of Emulsified Asphalt in Base Course.
 Construction of the base course shall be according to the provisions
 of Division 300 for the applicable type of base course.
 Emulsified asphalt shall be incorporated into the top 2" (50 mm)
 of the base course in a manner that will produce a uniform
 distribution of the asphalt at the plan designated rate. To facilitate
 uniform application and distribution, the emulsified asphalt may be
 added to water at a rate dictated by job conditions.
 
 231
 
 401
 When an existing base course is to be treated, the top 2" (50 mm)
 of the existing material shall be scarified, treated as described above,
 and spread and compacted.
 At the Contractor's option, prime coat, constructed according to
 the provisions of Subsections 401.02 and 401.03(b), may be
 substituted in lieu of Emulsified Asphalt in Base Course on
 shoulders, driveways, turnouts, islands, detours, temporary
 roadways, and parking or small, irregular areas. Payment for this
 substitution will be made as Emulsified Asphalt in Base Course.
 401.04 Blotter Course. (a) General. When directed, the fresh
 prime coat shall be covered by a blotter course in order to permit
 immediate use of the road by traffic without undue damage to the
 work or inconvenience to the traveling public.
 (b) Material. The material for the blotter course may be an
 approved, clean, sandy material from a local source or may be a
 commercially processed sand. Material used shall be free from
 lumps, roots, sticks, or other foreign matter.
 (c) Construction Requirements. Before the primed surface is
 opened to traffic, the blotter course shall be distributed evenly over
 the primed surface in such quantity as may be necessary to blot the
 surplus asphalt and prevent it from picking up under traffic. The
 surface shall then be dragged with an approved type of drag broom,
 supplemented as necessary by hand brooming, so as to distribute the
 material evenly.

 402.02 Materials. All materials for asphalt surface treatment
 shall conform to the applicable requirements of Section 403. All
 materials for equivalent construction shall conform to the applicable
 requirements of Sections 407, 409, and 410.
 233
 
 402
 The asphalt material shall be either a medium or rapid curing cutback asphalt, an emulsified asphalt, or asphalt binder. If the type
 and grade are not specified in the Contract, the Contractor may
 choose the type and the Engineer will specify the grade.
 402.03 Construction Requirements. (a) General. The methods
 employed in performing the work, and all equipment, tools, and
 machinery used in handling material and executing any part of the
 work shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer before the
 work is started and whenever found unsatisfactory shall be changed
 and improved as required. Equipment, tools, and machinery used
 must be maintained in a satisfactory condition, and must conform to
 the requirements provided in Section 403, or in Sections 409, and
 410, for equivalent construction.
 The surfaces of all structures shall be protected by some
 satisfactory method to prevent their being disfigured by the
 application of asphalt material. Objectionable asphalt discoloration,
 caused by the Contractor's operations, shall be removed from all
 roadway and bridge structures at no cost to the Department.
 Asphalt material shall not be applied on a surface having excess
 moisture or when weather conditions are unsuitable. The Contractor
 shall monitor local weather conditions to avoid placing material on
 the road ahead of adverse weather that could subsequently damage
 the material. In the event materials are damaged by adverse
 weather, they shall be replaced or repaired at no additional cost to
 the Department.
 Special precautions shall be taken to ensure that the equipment is
 operated in a manner that distributes the asphalt and aggregate
 evenly and uniformly. Deposits of asphalt and aggregate material
 upon the road surface in excess of the quantity specified, caused by
 stopping or starting the distributing machine, overflow, leakage, or
 other mechanical or human errors, shall be removed.
 Prior to performing the actual work, all equipment shall be
 adjusted and calibrated according to Section 403 and applicable
 manufacturer's requirements.
 The surface section shall be constructed in half widths for each
 application when public traffic is to be maintained. When traffic is
 not being maintained over the roadway, full width applications may
 be made when sufficient aggregate spreading and rolling equipment
 is provided for complete simultaneous coverage.
 234
 
 402
 (b) Sweeping and Cleaning. Before the asphalt material is
 applied, the surface shall be thoroughly cleaned and swept with a
 rotary power broom to remove all dust, dirt, mud, and loose or
 foreign material. A blower may be used to assist in the cleaning
 operation. The sweeping and cleaning operations shall be carried
 only far enough in advance of the application of the asphalt material
 to ensure that the surface is maintained in the proper condition at the
 time of application.
 (c) Application of Asphalt Material. After the surface to be
 treated has been prepared as specified above, the asphalt material for
 the surface treatment shall be sprayed uniformly over the surface by
 means of an approved mechanical pressure distributor, meeting the
 requirements of Section 403, to the lines and at the rate of
 application designated by the Engineer. The asphalt material shall
 be applied at the temperature specified in Section 403. The
 Contractor shall ensure uniformity of distribution at junctions of
 distributor loads by use of building paper or other approved
 methods.
 After asphalt material is applied, no equipment or traffic will be
 permitted on the surface until the aggregate is applied and rolled.
 (d) Application of Mineral Aggregate. The mineral aggregate
 shall not contain excessive free moisture and shall be spread
 immediately following the application of the asphalt material.
 Operations shall not proceed or continue when the asphalt material
 is allowed to chill, set up, dry, or otherwise impair retention of the
 mineral aggregate. The mineral aggregate shall be spread with a
 mechanical spreader meeting the requirements of Section 403. The
 mineral aggregate shall be distributed over the asphalt material to
 the lines and at the rate of application as directed by the Engineer.
 The use of an approved chip box to distribute the mineral aggregate
 will be permitted on detour construction and other areas approved
 by the Engineer where the use of a mechanical spreader is
 impractical. Spreading shall be accomplished in such manner that
 the tires of the trucks or aggregate spreader at no time contact the
 uncovered and freshly applied asphalt material. Portions of the
 surface not covered by mechanical spreaders shall be hand spotted
 so that the entire surface will be uniformly covered. Light hand
 brooming may be necessary to distribute excess aggregate.
 (e) Rolling and Brooming. A minimum of two rollers, one
 pneumatic and one steel wheel, along with one rotary power broom
 235
 
 402
 shall be used with each aggregate spreader being used. A
 combination steel wheel/pneumatic roller will be allowed as a
 substitute for the steel wheel roller.
 Rolling shall begin immediately behind the spreader. Each
 surface treatment shall be completely rolled a minimum of three
 times.
 After the final set of asphalt has occurred and no more than 48
 hours after application, the surface shall be lightly broomed to
 remove excess aggregate. Generally, the brooming shall be
 confined to the cooler hours of the day and shall be conducted so as
 not to displace embedded material.
 (f) Second and Successive Applications. If the work involves
 two or more applications of asphalt material and mineral aggregate,
 the rates of application for this material will be those specified on
 the plans or as designated by the Engineer and the method of
 construction will be the same as for the first application. Each
 application shall be placed only after the preceding application has
 been satisfactorily completed and cured.
 A minimum of 48 hours for emulsions and asphalt binders and 72
 hours for cut-backs shall elapse between the first and any
 succeeding application, however, a minimum of 24 hours is required
 before applying the succeeding application on detours or other
 temporary work. Further, the asphalt shall be firmly set and the
 aggregate firmly embedded so as not to be displaced by brooming.
 Before application, the surface shall be thoroughly swept with a
 rotary power broom so that no dust or loose aggregate is left that
 might cause a plane of cleavage.
 402.04 Traffic Control. During the application of the asphalt
 material and aggregate, and during the rolling operation, traffic will
 not be allowed on the new surface. When traffic must use the lane
 adjacent to the lane under construction, the Contractor shall regulate
 the flow of vehicles past the surfacing operation at a speed not to
 exceed 25 miles per hour (40 km/h). The Engineer may require the
 use of a pilot vehicle.
 Until the asphalt has set and the cover aggregate is firmly
 embedded, traffic shall not exceed 25 miles per hour (40 km/h). The
 vehicle speeds shall be controlled by the use of one or a combination
 of barricades, flaggers, signs, or pilot vehicles that will minimize the
 loss of cover aggregate. The method used for speed control shall be
 236
 
 402
 approved by the Engineer and will be subject to change or
 modification should the selected method of control prove
 unsatisfactory.
 The Contractor shall route the aggregate haul trucks to and from
 the work area so that they will not have to turn on the freshly placed
 surface treatment.
 402.05 Temperature and Seasonal Limitations.
 Asphalt
 material shall not be applied when the surface temperature is below
 60° F (15° C). In addition, asphalt surface treatments shall not be
 applied outside the following seasonal limitations:
 Traveled Lanes
 Shoulders
 
 April 15 to September 30
 April 1 to October 31
 
 No deviation from the above limitations will be allowed except
 by written permission from the Engineer.
 402.06 Method of Measurement. (a) Mineral aggregate in
 surface treatments will be measured either by the cubic yard (cubic
 meter) or by the ton (metric ton).
 (b) Asphalt in surface treatments will be measured by the gallon
 (liter).
 (c) When the actual rate of application of ACHM Surface Course
 (1/2” [12.5 mm]) or (3/8” [9.5 mm]) is placed within the limits shown
 on the plans or as directed by the Engineer at the rate shown in
 Subsection 402.01, or greater, it will be considered as the equivalent
 plan rate of Mineral Aggregate and Asphalt Material contained in
 each square yard (square meter) of Asphalt Surface Treatment.
 Should the Contractor inadvertently apply a lesser rate of
 application, the quantities placed at the lesser rate will be adjusted
 by the following factors:

 the tires of the other axle. Tires shall be uniformly inflated so that
 the air pressure of the several tires shall not vary more than 5 psi
 (35 kPa).
 Pneumatic rollers shall be capable of exerting a minimum ground
 contact pressure of 45 psi (310 kPa). The Contractor shall furnish to
 the Engineer charts or tabulations showing the contact area and
 contact pressure for the full range of tire inflation pressures and for
 the full range of tire loadings for each type and size compactor tire
 furnished. The tires shall be inflated and the roller loaded with
 ballast, as required, to obtain the average ground contact pressure
 necessary to obtain proper compaction.
 (c) Steel Wheel Rollers. Steel wheel or combination steel
 wheel/pneumatic rollers may be either three wheel or tandem type,
 shall weigh not less than 200 pounds per inch (35 kg/10 mm) width
 of roller, and shall have a complete rolling width of not less than 36"

 SECTION 404
 DESIGN AND QUALITY CONTROL OF ASPHALT
 MIXTURES
 404.01 Design of Asphalt Mixtures. (a) General.
 The
 Contractor shall furnish one mix design for each of the particular
 asphalt mixtures listed on the plans or in the Contract. The mix
 design shall be performed by a laboratory that is on the
 Department’s QPL of approved asphalt mix design laboratories and
 shall include the following:
 • Type of mix (e.g., ACHM Base, Binder, and Surface Course).
 • Design values for asphalt binder content, air voids, voids in
 mineral aggregate, gradation, and wheel tracking test.
 244
 
 404
 Source of each material to be used in production of the mix.
 Designation of the asphalt plant to be used for production of
 the mix.
 • Name(s) of individual(s) who performed the sampling,
 testing, and preparation of the mix design and the name of the
 laboratory used.
 • Optimum laboratory mixing and compacting temperatures.
 • Temperature viscosity curves for the asphalt binder to be used
 in the mix.
 • A one gallon sample of performance grade asphalt binder to
 be used in the mix.
 • Copies of all test results and mix design work papers.
 • Nine (9) blended aggregate samples.
 • A Certification by the Contractor that the mix design was
 prepared according to the specifications and that the materials
 to be used are from sources approved by the Engineer.
 The mix design shall be submitted to the Engineer of Materials
 for review. After completion of the review, the Engineer of
 Materials will accept or reject, in writing, the mix design. A mix
 design will be accepted only for a specific type of mix, materials
 sources, and the plant to be used. A change in any materials source
 will require a different mix design. Mix designs will be approved
 for a period of five years from the original approval date provided
 satisfactory results are obtained during production and placement.
 The Engineer of Materials will accept a maximum of three (3) mix
 designs for a particular type mix, materials source, and plant
 combination at any time. Mix designs submitted in excess of three
 will not be considered until the number of accepted mix designs is
 reduced by declaring one or more of them invalid. All mix designs
 accepted by the Engineer of Materials become the property of the
 Department.
 •
 •
 
 The Contractor shall notify the Resident Engineer in writing of
 the accepted mix design proposed for use on a specific project and
 provide copies of the mix design to the Resident Engineer. The
 Resident Engineer will approve an accepted mix design for use on
 each project. Only one mix design for each type of mix will be
 active (approved for use on highway projects) at any one plant at
 any time. A maximum of two other accepted mix designs for each
 type of mix will be considered inactive. If a change of mix design is
 245
 
 404
 desired, the Contractor shall notify the Resident Engineer and
 request permission to change the mix design. Arbitrary changes of
 the active mix design will not be approved.
 The Engineer will not perform any pre-bid testing of materials. It
 will be the Contractor's responsibility to obtain material sources
 approved by the Engineer unless sources are designated on the plans
 or in the Contract. Additives shall be selected from those on the
 Qualified Products List. If asphalt binder or aggregate sources
 proposed for use are not on the Qualified Products List, at least 10
 business days must be allowed for sampling and testing before
 beginning the mix review process. At least five (5) business days
 shall be allowed for the review of the mix design.
 (b) Design Requirements. Each mix design shall be prepared by
 laboratory analysis according to the requirements of the
 specifications. Each mix design will establish a mix gradation for
 the aggregates (based on the weight of material passing specified
 screen sizes), an optimum asphalt binder content (expressed as a
 percentage of the total mix weight), an optimum laboratory mixing
 temperature, and an optimum laboratory compaction temperature.
 Optimum laboratory mixing and compaction temperatures shall be
 established based on temperature-viscosity curves of the asphalt
 binder to be used in the mix. The optimum asphalt content is the
 asphalt binder content at 4% Air Voids (AV) for PG 76-22 mixes

 Asphalt binder shall comply with the requirements of AASHTO
 M 320 Table 1, except the Direct Tension requirements are deleted,
 and shall be from sources that have executed a certification
 agreement with the Department. PG 70-22 and PG 76-22 asphalt
 binders shall be production straight run binders that are modified by
 using either a SB, SBS or SBR to achieve the specified grade.
 PG 70-22 and PG 76-22 asphalt binders shall meet a minimum
 elongation recovery of 40% and 50%, respectively, when tested on
 the original binder at 77º F (± 1º F) [25º C (± 0.5º C)], in accordance

 effective specific gravity, shall be shown on the mix design. The
 mix design for each type of asphalt mix shall meet the design
 247
 
 404
 criteria for asphalt binder content, Air Voids (AV), Voids in Mineral
 Aggregate (VMA), fines to asphalt ratio, aggregate gradation, water
 sensitivity, and wheel tracking test.
 The Contractor certified mix design shall provide for the design
 requirements for asphalt binder content, AV, VMA, fines to asphalt
 ratio, aggregate gradation, and water sensitivity specified for the
 particular mix.
 The mix design gradation must fall within the master gradation
 limits for the specified type of mix.
 If an acceptable pavement is not produced and it is determined
 that the accepted mix design is at fault, paving operations shall be
 stopped and the Contractor shall prepare a new mix design. The
 processing of proposed changes or new designs shall follow the
 same procedures as the initial mix designs.
 404.02 Mixture Requirements.
 Asphalt mixtures will be
 designed and tested to meet the requirements specified in
 Sections 405, 406, and 407.
 404.03 Mixture Substitutions.
 Substitutions of specified
 courses will be allowed only on shoulders, leveling, and incidental
 or temporary construction as follows:
 1) ACHM Base Course (1-1/2″ [37.5 mm]) may be replaced with:
 ACHM Binder Course (1″ [25 mm])
 ACHM Surface Course (1/2″ [12.5 mm])
 ACHM Surface Course (3/8″ [9.5 mm])
 2) ACHM Binder Course (1″ [25 mm]) may be replaced with:
 ACHM Surface Course (1/2″ [12.5 mm])
 ACHM Surface Course (3/8″ [9.5 mm])
 3) ACHM Surface Course (1/2″ [12.5 mm]) may be replaced with:
 ACHM Surface Course (3/8″ [9.5 mm])
 Mixture substitution will be at the planned rate for the material
 for which the substitution is being made and shall use the specified
 asphalt binder grade. Measurement for payment of all components
 of the mix will be based on the accepted mix design for the type
 specified on the plans or on the accepted mix design for the type
 used, whichever results in the lower cost per ton (metric ton) of mix
 to the Department. If no accepted mix design for the type specified
 on the plans is available, the mixture composition for payment will
 be based on the composition shown on the plans as the basis of
 estimate for the plan type or on the accepted mix design for the mix
 248
 
 404
 actually used, whichever results in the lower cost per ton (metric
 ton) of mix to the Department.
 404.04 Quality Control of Asphalt Mixtures. The Contractor
 shall perform all applicable quality control sampling and testing of
 the asphalt mixtures used on the project.
 The Contractor is responsible for product quality control during
 handling, blending, mixing, storing, transporting, and placement
 operations, and for necessary adjustments in proportioning of the
 materials to produce the accepted mix design within the tolerances
 specified for the mix. Adjustments to the accepted mix design to
 conform to actual production values without re-design of the
 mixture shall be based on production of the mixture at a target value
 of 4.0% Air Voids (AV) for PG 76-22 mixes and 4.5% Air Voids
 (AV) for PG 64-22 and PG 70-22 in specimens and an asphalt
 binder content not less than that specified in the accepted mix
 design. The VMA shall be within the specified limits for the
 adjustment to be acceptable.
 The accepted mix design shall be field verified by the Contractor
 at the start of mix production or after an interruption of more than 90
 calendar days. The asphalt mixture shall be verified by testing mix
 that has been produced through the plant using the aggregate
 proportions shown on the accepted mix design.
 The mix will be considered to be verified if test values for air
 voids, asphalt binder content, and VMA are within the compliance
 limits shown in Table 410-1, and when the accepted mix design has
 been produced within the gradation tolerances according to
 Subsection 404.04.
 After verification of the initial design, the Contractor may elect to
 make adjustments in aggregate proportions to vary the accepted mix
 design gradations and bring the mix properties near the center of the
 compliance limits. If these adjustments are made and the plant
 produced mix has the desired properties, the Contractor may request
 that a field mix design be accepted by the Engineer. If this is
 acceptable to the Engineer, the Contractor will be notified in
 writing.
 If other changes to the accepted mix design are desirable, the
 Contractor must first produce another laboratory mix design, submit
 it to the Engineer for review and acceptance, and follow the
 verification procedures that are described above.
 249
 
 404
 The Contractor shall perform all applicable quality control
 sampling and testing required to ensure that the completed asphalt
 pavement complies with all requirements of the specifications.
 Quality control sampling and testing by the Contractor shall be
 performed in a qualified laboratory by a certified technician.
 Requirements for technician certification and laboratory
 qualification are contained in the Department’s Manual of Field
 Sampling and Testing Procedures.
 Quality control sampling and testing shall be accomplished in a
 timely manner. Sampling and testing shall be planned and
 conducted so that a representative sample is obtained and tested.
 The Contractor shall determine the specific locations for samples
 and frequency of sampling for quality control, except the minimum
 frequency which is listed below for aggregate gradation shall be
 used. In addition, the Contractor shall be required to perform
 acceptance sampling and testing at specific times and/or locations
 specified by the Engineer according to Subsection 410.09. The
 Contractor may use the results of these required tests in their quality
 control program.
 If the accepted mix design is not being produced as defined by
 the accepted mix design, and if the mix cannot be adjusted within
 the tolerances of the accepted mix design to achieve the specified
 mix properties, production shall be discontinued. A new mix design
 shall be developed and submitted for review and acceptance. Sieve
 tolerances shall be as tabulated below.

 NOTE 1: Where alternate test methods are shown, the method
 used shall be at the Contractor's option. All testing for quality
 control and acceptance shall be performed on samples of the plant
 mixed product.
 Field densities and samples to investigate
 segregation shall be taken from the roadway after compaction; all
 other samples shall be taken from trucks at the plant.
 NOTE 2: Test for AV on samples prepared by gyratory
 compactor according to the volumetric mix design procedures in
 AASHTO M 323.
 NOTE 3: The Water Sensitivity shall be determined at least
 once during the first three days of production of each type mix;
 during the first three days of production of any new mix design;
 and/or during the first three days of production after an interruption
 of 90 calendar days or more. If the water sensitivity falls more than
 10 percentage points below that specified for the type mix,
 production shall cease and a new mix design will be required.
 NOTE 4: Department test results for asphalt binder content will
 be determined by AHTD 449/449A (nuclear asphalt content gauge)
 exclusively. In the event of disagreement between the test results
 from a nuclear gauge and test results from an ignition oven, the
 251
 
 404
 nuclear gauge results shall take precedence over the ignition oven
 results.
 Sampling and testing for acceptance and adjustment of payment
 will be performed as specified in Subsection 410.09.
 The Contractor shall furnish a building for the use of the
 Department's plant inspector according to Subsection 409.03(h).
 This building shall be separate and independent of the Contractor's
 facilities and equipment for performing quality control sampling and
 testing. The "separate and independent" requirement may be met by
 space in a building that is also used by the Contractor or supplier,
 provided that the space otherwise meets all requirements of
 Subsection 409.03(h); is physically separated from the rest of the
 building by a solid wall; and has an outside entrance with all keys
 placed in the custody of the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall provide an opportunity for the Engineer to
 observe all quality control sampling and testing procedures. The
 Contractor's quality control personnel may observe the AHTD
 project personnel during acceptance sampling and testing for the
 purpose of comparing sampling and testing procedures.
 The Contractor shall maintain a daily plot of all test results, and
 make the plots available to the Engineer. Upon completion of work
 on the item these plots shall be furnished to the Resident Engineer
 for inclusion in the project files. The Resident Engineer will make
 acceptance test results available to the Contractor's personnel.
 If the test results show that the material is outside the mix design
 limits, is widely varying, or is consistently marginal, corrective
 action shall be taken. Corrective actions taken shall be based on the
 Contractor's quality control test results. The Department's asphalt
 plant inspector will be notified of all proposed corrective actions
 before their implementation. Each individual aggregate cold feed
 may be adjusted no more than an amount that is sufficient to
 produce the specified AV and VMA and that is within the tolerances
 for the accepted mix design. If excessive changes are required,
 production will be suspended and a new mix design shall be
 developed according to the applicable specifications.
 Use of nuclear asphalt content gauges is regulated by the
 Radiation Control and Emergency Management Programs of the
 Arkansas State Department of Health. If the Contractor elects to use
 a nuclear gauge in his quality control program, he shall be
 252
 
 405
 responsible for meeting and following all licensing and use
 requirements.
 404.05 Method of Measurement and Basis of Payment. Design
 and Quality Control of Asphalt Mixtures will not be paid for

 272
 
 409
 409.04 Equipment. (a) Mechanical Spreading and Finishing
 Equipment. Mechanical spreading and finishing equipment shall
 consist of a self-powered paver, capable of spreading and finishing
 the mixture true to line, grade, and cross section. The paver shall be
 capable of laying a uniform mixture to the full width being laid.
 The paver shall be equipped with mechanical devices such as
 equalizing runners, straightedge runners, evener arms, or other
 compensating devices to adjust the grade and confine the edges of
 the mixture to true lines. The paver shall be equipped with hoppers
 and distributing screws adequate to place the mixture evenly ahead
 of the screed for the full width being laid.
 Pavers used for shoulders and similar construction shall be
 capable of uniformly spreading and finishing courses of asphalt
 material to the full width being laid. The paver shall be equipped
 with a receiving hopper and distribution system to place the mixture
 uniformly across the entire width of the screed.
 The term "screed" shall include any strike-off device, operated by
 cutting, crowding, or other practical action that effectively places
 and spreads the mixture without tearing, shoving, gouging, or
 segregating. Screeds shall be adjustable to crown and grade and
 shall have an indicating level attached.
 The paver shall be equipped with an automatic screed control
 system for the control of grade and slope. The sensor for grade
 control may be operated from a reference stringline, from a ski-type
 grade reference system, or by any other appropriate method that will
 produce the desired results.
 Final approval of spreading and finishing equipment will be
 based upon satisfactory performance during actual construction. If
 equipment becomes unsatisfactory, it shall be replaced before
 proceeding with the work.
 (b) Materials Transfer Device (MTD) / Materials Transfer
 Vehicle (MTV). A Materials Transfer Device or Materials Transfer
 Vehicle (MTD/MTV) shall be used on all State, US, and Interstate
 highways for the placement of all ACHM courses. ACHM
 quantities exempt from this requirement are projects or phases of
 work with less than 1000 tons of hot mix, leveling, parking lots,
 driveways and turnouts, temporary pavements (such as detours and
 crossovers), and ACHM placement in trench widening areas less
 than 11′ (3.3 m) in width. At the Engineer’s discretion, isolated
 273
 
 409
 portions of a project may be exempted from use of the MTD/MTV if
 the weight or operation of the MTD/MTV is detrimental to the
 roadway. Exemptions will not be made prior to the beginning of
 paving operations and initial use of the MTD/MTV.
 The
 MTD/MTV may not be removed from the project during the paving
 operations over the exempted location; rather it must be on-site and
 available to resume work once the paving operation moves out of
 the isolated area.
 The ACHM mixture shall be transferred mechanically to the
 paver by means of a MTD/MTV.
 The material shall be
 continuously remixed or reblended either internally in the transfer
 vehicle, in a paver hopper insert, or in the paver’s hopper.
 Remixing/reblending shall be accomplished by the use of remixing
 augers, paddles or screens capable of continuously blending the hot
 mix asphalt.
 The MTD/MTV, haul units, and paver shall work together to
 provide a continuous, uniform, segregation free flow of material.
 The number of haul units, speed of the paver, plant production rate,
 and speed of the MTD/MTV shall be coordinated to avoid stop and
 go operations. The wings of the paver receiving hopper shall not be
 raised (dumped) at any time during the paving operation.
 If a MTD/MTV or remixing/reblending unit malfunctions during
 lay-down operations, the Contractor may continue hot mix lay-down
 operations until any hot mix asphalt in transit or stored in a silo (up
 to a maximum of 500 tons [500 metric tons]) has been laid and until
 such time as there is sufficient hot mix placed to maintain traffic in a
 safe manner. Lay-down operations shall cease thereafter, until such
 time as the equipment is operational.
 The Engineer will evaluate the performance of the MTD/MTV
 and remixing/reblending equipment by measuring the temperature
 profile of the mat immediately behind the screed of the paver during
 placement of the rolling pattern test strip. The ACHM to be placed
 for the temperature profile test shall be held in the haul truck(s) for
 at least 45 minutes, measured from the time of loading to the time of
 discharging into the MTD/MTV. If the bed of the haul truck is
 covered, the cover will be removed once arriving at the test strip
 location. The temperature profile measurements shall be taken of
 the surface of the mat at six 50 ft. (13 m) intervals during test strip
 construction using a non-contact thermometer. Each temperature
 profile shall consist of three surface temperature measurements
 274
 
 410
 taken transversely across the mat in a straight line at a distance of 1
 foot to 3 feet (0.3 m to 1 m) from the screed while the paver is
 operating. The three temperature measurements in each profile shall
 be taken approximately one foot (0.3 m) from each edge and one in
 the middle of the mat. The difference between the maximum and
 minimum temperature of each individual profile shall not be more
 than 10°F (6° C).
 If any two temperature measurement profiles within the test strip
 do not comply with the 10°F (6° C) temperature differential
 requirement, the paving operation shall be halted and adjustments
 made to the MTD/MTV or remixing/reblending equipment to ensure
 that the hot-mix placed by the paver is within the above temperature
 requirements. Once adjustments are made, the Engineer will repeat
 this procedure to verify that the mix placed by the paver is within
 specifications.
 Additional surface temperature profile measurements may be
 taken transversely across the mat at any time during the project to
 determine if the MTD/MTV and remixing/reblending equipment are
 working properly.
 During this verification testing, if two
 consecutive temperature measurement profiles do not comply with
 the 10°F (6° C) temperature differential requirement, the paving
 operation shall be halted and adjustments made to the MTD/MTV or
 remixing/reblending equipment to ensure that the hot-mix placed by
 the paver is within the above temperature requirements.
 (c) Rollers. Rollers shall be of the size and type to produce the
 density required and a surface that is smooth and free from check
 cracking. Rollers shall have a system for moistening the full width
 of each tire or drum and devices for cleaning the tires or drums.
 Petroleum products shall not be used on the surfaces of the roller
 that will be in contact with the pavement.

 276
 
 410
 existing pavement crown, shall be made. Such corrections shall be
 accomplished by placing asphalt binder or surface course mixtures
 at the location and in a manner as directed by the Engineer. Asphalt
 material used for wedging or leveling courses, or for filling holes,
 may be placed by hand, blade grader, or mechanical spreader
 methods. The mixture shall be featheredged to a smooth and even
 surface around the edges of these areas. Before placing asphalt
 material, the base or existing surface shall be primed or tacked as
 applicable.
 Unless otherwise specified, no direct payment will be made for
 cleaning the surface of existing pavement.
 Before arrival of the mixture on the work, the prepared surface,
 primed or tack coated as specified, shall be cleaned of all loose and
 foreign materials. The mixture shall not be placed on a surface that
 shows evidence of free moisture.
 Contact surfaces of curbing, gutters, manholes, and other
 structures shall be painted with a thin coating of rapid curing
 cutback asphalt or emulsified asphalt. No direct compensation will
 be made for this work.
 For foreign material, or when the time lapse between courses is
 more than 72 hours, the earlier course shall be cleaned and given a
 tack coat before placing the succeeding course. When directed, the
 tack coat shall be applied and paid for under Section 401. If
 directed by the Engineer, a tack coat shall be used even though the
 elapsed time has been less than 72 hours.
 410.06 Transporting. The mixture shall be transported from the
 mixing plant to the work in vehicles with clean tight beds.
 No loads shall be sent so late in the day as to interfere with
 spreading and compacting the mixture during daylight hours unless
 adequate artificial lighting is provided.
 Sufficient haul vehicles and plant production rate shall be
 maintained for the project to provide a continuous operation on the
 roadway.
 Only non-petroleum release agents listed on the QPL shall be
 used in haul trucks.
 410.07 Spreading and Finishing. The mixture from all types of
 plants shall be delivered to the paver at no more than 25° F (14° C)
 277
 
 410
 above the mixing temperature shown on the approved mix design.
 In no case shall binder or surface course be placed at a temperature
 less than 250° F (125° C).
 The mixture shall be placed on an approved surface, spread, and
 struck off to the line, grade, and elevation established. The mixture
 shall be placed only on a base that shows no evidence of free
 moisture, and only when weather conditions are suitable. The
 Engineer may, however, permit work of this character to continue
 when overtaken by sudden rains to utilize materials that may be in
 transit from the plant at the time, provided the mixture is within the
 temperature limits specified and provided the finished pavement
 otherwise meets specification requirements. Water shall not be
 applied to the ACHM courses to speed cooling of the mat.
 The longitudinal joint in one layer shall offset that in the layer
 immediately below by approximately 6″ (150 mm), however, in
 general, the joint in the top layer shall be at the centerline of the
 pavement if the roadway comprises two lanes in width, or at lane
 lines if the roadway is more than two lanes in width. On roadways
 with a center turn lane, the Contractor may, at his option, elect to
 place a joint at the crown (i.e., middle of the center turn lane) of the
 roadway and eliminate the joints on the lane lines of that lane. The
 slight excess of asphalt at a longitudinal joint, generated by
 overlapping during placement of an adjacent mat to a previous mat,
 shall not be scattered across the mat. This material shall be stacked
 over the joint. The first pass of the steel wheel roller shall be
 entirely on the new mat, with the edge of the drum 6″ (150 mm)
 away from the longitudinal joint. The second pass of the steel wheel
 roller shall be made with 6″ to 8″ (150 mm to 200 mm) of the drum
 overhanging onto the older mat.
 General casting back of material or hand raking material onto the
 surface will not be permitted. Hand spreading will be permitted
 only in areas inaccessible to the paver.
 On roads under traffic, the mixture shall be spread and finished in
 full lane widths where practicable. The paver shall alternate
 between the lanes with such frequency that the adjacent lane shall be
 laid no later than the next working day after the first lane is laid. A
 transition area from the new pavement down to the existing
 pavement will be constructed at the beginning and ending of each
 day’s paving operation. The length of the transition will be based on
 the thickness of the ACHM course being placed:

 The paver shall uniformly distribute and compact the mixture in
 front of the screed for the full width being paved. The finished
 surface shall be smooth and of uniform texture.
 The screed or strike-off assembly shall effectively produce a
 finished surface of the required evenness and texture without
 tearing, shoving, or gouging the mixture.
 When laying mixtures, the paver shall be operated at forward
 speeds consistent with satisfactory laying of the mixture. The speed
 of the paver shall be matched with the plant production rate and
 number of hauling units. Stop and go operation of the paver shall be
 held to a minimum.
 The edge of the Binder or Surface Course shall be established by
 a string or chalk line for a distance of not less than 500′ (150 m)
 ahead of the spreading operation.
 410.08 Rolling and Density Requirements and Joints. At the
 beginning of placement of each mix design, the Contractor shall
 establish an optimum rolling pattern for the mix being placed. A
 strip of approximately 500′ (150 m) of the mat being placed shall be
 used to establish the rolling pattern. A sufficient number of
 coverages of the entire mat by the rollers proposed to be used by the
 279
 
 410
 Contractor during production paving operations shall be made to
 achieve the maximum density possible. The Engineer will observe
 the Contractor's use of a nuclear density gauge to verify that the
 maximum densities possible are obtained.
 The established rolling pattern shall be used for compacting all
 mix placed. If a change in the accepted mix design occurs, or if the
 compaction method or equipment is changed, or if unacceptable
 results are obtained, a new optimum rolling pattern shall be
 established.
 If for any reason a rolling pattern cannot be established to
 produce the specified density, a new mix design will be required.
 The Contractor shall establish an optimum rolling pattern that will
 produce the maximum density using the new mix design.
 Continuous production of the mix shall not begin until an optimum
 rolling pattern that produces the specified density within the
 allowable range has been established.
 Rolling shall start longitudinally at the low edge and proceed
 toward the higher portion of the mat. When paving in echelon or
 abutting a previously placed lane, the longitudinal joint shall be
 rolled first followed by the regular rolling procedure. Alternate
 passes of the roller shall be terminated at least 3′ (1 m) from any
 preceding stop. Rolling on superelevated curves shall progress from
 the low side. Rollers shall not be stopped perpendicular to the
 centerline of the traveled way.
 The speed of the roller shall be slow enough to avoid
 displacement of the hot mixture, and shall in no case be more than 3
 mph (5 km/h). The roller shall be operated in such a manner that no
 displacement of the mat will occur. Rolling shall proceed
 continuously until all roller marks are eliminated and the required
 density attained. To prevent adhesion of the asphalt mixture to the
 rollers, the rollers shall be kept moist for the full width of the rollers,
 but an excess of water will not be permitted.
 Upon completion of the rolling operations, the surface shall be
 smooth and of uniform texture.
 If the asphalt binder content varies from the value used to
 calculate the specific gravity, the maximum theoretical density will
 be adjusted accordingly. If the Contractor elects to verify the
 specific gravity or to establish a different specific gravity, he shall
 perform the test under AASHTO T 209 on production mix and
 280
 
 410
 furnish the results to the Engineer. The Contractor and the Engineer
 will use the specific gravity that best represents the material that is
 being sampled for acceptance of the pavement. If either quality
 control or acceptance density tests indicate that the established
 maximum theoretical density may be in error, the Engineer may
 require that the specific gravity be redetermined from production
 mix. If production has been interrupted for 90 calendar days or the
 mix design has changed a new maximum theoretical density shall be
 established.
 Rollers shall not pass over the unprotected end of a freshly laid
 mixture. Transverse joints shall be formed by cutting back on the
 previous run to expose the full depth of the course. A brush coat of
 asphalt material shall be used on contact surfaces of transverse joints
 just before additional mixture is placed against the previously placed
 material.
 410.09 Acceptance of the Pavement and Adjustments in
 Payment. (a) General. The accepted mix design shall be verified
 by the Contractor at the start of mix production for that design or
 after an interruption of more than 90 calendar days. A maximum of
 200 tons (200 metric tons) of material may be placed on the
 roadway during the verification process. If the mix produced does
 not verify the mix design, the material placed on the roadway shall
 be declared a partial lot and a new mix design submitted.
 Verification shall consist of test results showing that the values for
 air voids, VMA, and asphalt binder content are within the
 compliance limits. If necessary, adjustments will be made to the
 plant to produce mix within the specified property limits. All mixes
 produced shall be within the gradation tolerances of the accepted
 mix design according to Section 404.04. The adjusted mix shall
 become the new accepted mix design.
 Acceptance and adjustment in payment will be by lot. The
 standard lot size for acceptance and adjustment in payment will be
 3000 tons (3000 metric tons), with each standard lot divided into
 four sublots of 750 tons (750 metric tons) each. The Engineer may
 establish a partial lot at any time. The Engineer will determine the
 size of any partial lots established and the number and size(s) of the
 sublots, if any. Although there are no specified limits for the size of
 such partial lots, they normally will be not less than 300 tons (300
 metric tons) nor more than 3300 tons (3300 metric tons). Field
 density tests shall be performed on the compacted mat on the
 281
 
 410
 roadway as soon as possible, preferably not later than the day after
 placement.
 The Contractor shall obtain and test one sample taken at random
 from each sublot. The Department will determine the location for
 each sample in the sublot by AHTD Test Method 465. The
 Department's inspector shall be provided an opportunity to witness
 all Contractor sampling and testing. The test reports of all
 Contractor acceptance tests shall be provided to the Engineer by the
 end of the first working day following production of the material.
 The Department will obtain and test a minimum of one sample
 taken at random from each lot, including partial lots, to be used both
 for verification and for acceptance. Verification testing will be
 conducted in accordance with Subsection 106.11 and the
 Department’s Manual of Field Sampling and Testing Procedures.
 The location of the lot sample will be determined by the Department
 using AHTD Test Method 465. If core samples are used for field
 density testing, they shall be obtained by the Contractor at locations
 selected by the Engineer and at no cost to the Department. The
 samples shall be obtained using a diamond blade pavement saw or a
 diamond bit core drill to remove a sample of compacted pavement
 for the full depth of the course(s). The holes made in taking the
 sample shall be repaired by the Contractor at no cost to the
 Department.
 The following procedures shall apply for field density testing
 when ACHM mixes are used as a leveling course or as a bond
 breaker between a base material and Portland Cement Concrete
 Pavement:
 • If the entire sublot quantity is placed for leveling or as a
 bond breaker and the thickness of all of the leveling/bond breaker
 in that sublot is less than three times the nominal maximum
 aggregate size, no field density sample or test will be required.
 The sublot will be excluded from the calculation of the average
 field density for the acceptance of the lot in Subsection 410.09(a).
 • If the entire sublot quantity is placed for leveling or as a
 bond breaker and portions of the leveling/bond breaker have a
 thickness greater than three times the nominal maximum
 aggregate size, a field density sample shall be obtained by the
 Contractor at a location determined by the Department using
 AHTD Test Method 465; however the sampling area will be
 282
 
 410
 restricted to the area in which the thickness of the leveling
 course/bond breaker is greater than three times the nominal
 maximum aggregate size.
 • If only a portion of the sublot quantity is placed for leveling
 or as a bond breaker, the Contractor shall obtain a field density
 sample at a location determined by the Department using AHTD
 Test Method 465; however the sampling area will be restricted to
 the portion of the sublot where the material used as leveling or as
 a bond breaker has a thickness greater than three times the
 nominal aggregate size and to the area where the material was not
 used for leveling or as a bond breaker.
 When field density testing for a sublot is waived by one of the
 above conditions, the ACHM mix used as a leveling course or as a
 bond breaker shall be compacted utilizing the optimum rolling
 pattern to achieve the maximum density required, as required by
 Subsection 410.08.
 The Contractor’s acceptance sampling and testing procedures,
 equipment, and results will be subject to independent assurance
 sampling and testing conducted by the Department. Independent
 assurance sampling and testing will be conducted at the frequencies
 indicated in the Department’s Manual of Field Sampling and Testing
 Procedures. The Contractor shall be required to make changes to
 the equipment and/or procedures used if the results of the
 independent assurance tests do not correlate with the Contractor’s
 test results.
 The Department will perform all tests for acceptance and
 adjustment in payment on material used to replace unacceptable
 material removed by the Contractor. The number of tests and the
 location(s) for sampling will be determined by the Engineer using
 the same procedures used for the original material. The results of
 these tests will be used for acceptance and adjustment in payment
 for the lot or sublot, as applicable.
 Acceptance sampling and testing by the Contractor shall be
 performed in a qualified laboratory by a certified technician.
 Requirements for technician certification and laboratory
 qualification are contained in the Department’s Manual of Field
 Sampling and Testing Procedures. All sampling and testing for
 acceptance and adjustment in payment shall be performed using the
 test methods specified in Subsection 404.04 for quality control
 283
 
 410
 sampling and testing. This includes performing a maximum
 theoretical specific gravity test (AASHTO T 209) for each
 acceptance and adjustment in payment test. The VMA (effective) as
 determined by the effective specific gravity shall be calculated. The
 VMA (actual) shall be determined by reducing the VMA (effective)
 by the correction factor shown on the mix design. Samples for all
 properties except density and the investigation of segregation shall
 be obtained from trucks at the plant. Samples shall be maintained at
 or near the optimum mixing temperature until the testing procedure
 begins. Specimens for air voids shall be compacted at or near the
 optimum compaction temperature. In no case shall the sample be
 allowed to cool below the compaction range specified by the
 accepted mix design.
 (b) Acceptance of the Pavement. Acceptance of ACHM
 courses will be based on the following criteria:
 •
 •
 •
 
 The results of tests for the properties listed in Table 410-1,
 Pavement smoothness, and
 Segregation.
 
 (1) Properties in Table 410-1. Acceptance with respect to
 the properties listed in Table 410-1 will be by lot. Acceptance of
 a standard lot will be based on the average of the five (5) tests
 performed on the lot. Acceptance of a partial lot will be based on
 the average of the actual number of tests made on that partial lot.
 Acceptance of a sublot will be based on the results of the test(s)
 performed on samples from that sublot.
 The term "mix design value" refers to the value shown in the
 accepted mix design.
 When the average of the test results for a lot fall within the
 range shown in Table 410-1 as "Compliance Limits", the lot will
 be accepted with no price reduction for those properties. If the
 average of the test results for a lot for any single property listed
 in the table falls within the limits shown as "Price Reduction
 Limits", the material may be left in place at a reduced price as
 specified in Subsection 410.09(d). If the average of the test
 results for a lot for any single property listed in the table falls
 outside the limits shown as "Lot Rejection Limits", the entire lot
 shall be removed and replaced at no cost to the Department.
 Sampling and testing of the replacement material will be
 according to Subsection 410.09(a).
 284
 
 410
 For any single property except density, if the result of the
 single test in a sublot falls outside the limits shown as "Sublot
 Rejection Limits", that sublot shall be removed and replaced at
 no cost to the Department. In the sublot containing the
 Department's lot test, if the result of either the Contractor's sublot
 test or the Department's lot test fall outside the sublot rejection
 limits, the two tests will be averaged and the average of the two
 test results used to determine acceptance or rejection of the
 sublot. The average of the two test results will also be used as a
 single value to compute the average for the lot for acceptance and
 adjustment.
 For density, if a test for a sublot is more than 2.0 percentage
 points above or below the specification limits for the type of mix,
 that sublot will be further evaluated as follows:
 Two additional density tests will be performed by the
 Department on a statistically random basis within that sublot,
 except that only one additional test will be performed if the
 sublot contains both a Contractor sublot test and a
 Department lot test. If the average of the three tests is within
 2.0 percentage points above or below the compliance limits,
 the sublot will be accepted. The average of the three test
 results will be used as a single value to compute the average
 for acceptance and adjustment of the lot.
 If the average is outside the sublot rejection limits, the sublot
 shall be removed and replaced at no cost to the Department. In
 that case, the result of a density test performed on the
 replacement material will be used to calculate the average for
 acceptance and adjustment of the lot.
 (2) Pavement Smoothness. The finished surface, when
 checked with a 10′ (3 m) straight-edge parallel to the centerline,
 shall show no variation more than 3/16″ (5 mm) for binder
 courses and not more than 1/8″ (3 mm) for surface courses when
 the profile grade line is shown on the plans. If the profile grade
 line is not shown on the plans, the variations shall be not more
 than ¼″ (6 mm) for binder courses and not more than 3/16″ (5
 mm) for surface courses. When surface tests indicate surface
 tolerances do not meet these requirements, corrections to the
 pavement and changes to the paving operations shall be made
 before beginning the next day’s operations.
 285
 
 410
 All transverse joints shall be straightedged immediately
 following rolling of the joint. Paving will not continue until the
 transverse joint meets the applicable surface tolerances shown
 above.
 The Engineer will test the finished surface of each course on
 main lanes and ramps with a rolling straightedge immediately
 following the final rolling as conditions permit. All testing will
 be made in a longitudinal direction and at least one pass shall be
 made for the full length of each lane.
 Areas not meeting the above surface test requirements for all
 except the final surface course may be corrected by skin
 patching, featheredging, or other methods that would provide the
 required smoothness.
 Areas not meeting the above surface test requirements for the
 final surface course shall be corrected in such a manner as to
 maintain a quality pavement having the same uniform texture and
 appearance as the adjoining surface. Skin patching will not be
 permitted. Featheredging will be permitted only at the beginning
 and the end of the job. When the corrective action involves
 removing and replacing a section of the final surface, the
 minimum area to be removed shall be 50 linear feet (15 m) of
 length for the full width of the course placed. Replacement of the
 final surface shall be accomplished using a paver.
 Grinding will be allowed, if necessary, to correct surface
 tolerance deficiencies. The grinding equipment shall be power
 driven and specifically designed to smooth and uniformly texture
 the pavement by means of diamond blades.
 All corrective work and material necessary to correct surface
 tolerance deficiencies for binder or surface courses shall be at no
 cost to the Department.
 (3) Segregation. Segregation in asphalt concrete hot mix
 paving is the non-uniform distribution of aggregate that results in
 non-uniform surface texture. If a pattern of segregation develops,
 or if segregation occurs over a large area (3 square yards [3 sq m]
 or more), paving shall cease until the problem has been corrected.

 410
 Visual inspection of the compacted pavement will be made to
 determine the extent of any segregation. In addition to the visual
 inspection, objectionable areas may be tested. Samples will be
 obtained from the areas identified as objectionable by the
 Engineer. Gradation, density, and asphalt binder content of the
 samples will be determined according to the test methods in
 Section 404.04. The test values obtained shall be within the
 tolerances for gradation in Section 404.04 and within the
 compliance limits for asphalt binder content and density in
 Section 410. If any of the test results do not meet the
 requirements, the area/areas will be considered non-complying.
 If the non-complying material is deemed reasonably acceptable
 according to Subsection 105.04, it may be left in place at a
 reduced cost to the Department.
 In the event the material is found unacceptable relative to
 segregation and it is determined that the material must be
 removed, the area(s) of segregation shall be removed full depth
 of the course paved. Replacement of the material by dumping
 and spreading by hand or motor grader will be permitted on base
 and binder courses for areas less than 50 linear feet (15 m) in
 length. Replacement of larger areas of base and binder and
 replacement of any surface course will be accomplished with a
 paver. On surface course, the minimum area to be removed shall
 be 50 linear feet (15 m) of the full width of the mat paved.
 (4) Pavement that is determined to be non-complying for any
 reason other than the properties listed in Table 410-1 will be
 evaluated under Subsection 105.04. The Engineer will determine
 whether the non-complying pavement must be corrected,
 removed and replaced, or may be left in place at a reduced cost to
 the Department. Price reductions determined under Subsection
 105.04 will be in addition to the price reductions, if any,
 determined under Subsection 410.09(d). If the total price
 reduction is determined to be greater than 50% for any lot, that
 lot will not be accepted. When two consecutive lots or any three
 out of five lots fail to qualify for full payment for any reason,
 work will be stopped until corrective action is taken.
 (c) Unacceptable Pavement. Any lot or sublot of any ACHM
 course that is not accepted for any reason shall be removed and
 replaced by the Contractor at no cost to the Department. Payment
 for sections where removal and replacement is required will be
 288
 
 410
 withheld or recovered, and released after replacement has been
 acceptably completed. The quantity for payment will be the original
 quantity and measurement of the quantity used in replacement
 operations will not be considered.
 (d) Adjustments. Adjustments will be made by reducing the
 contract price of the lot according to the schedules below. Price
 reductions will be computed from the schedules below for each
 property, and reductions for each property added together to obtain
 the total price reduction for the lot. The total price reduction will be
 applied to all components of the course for the entire quantity of the
 lot. Price reductions will be accomplished by Change Order and
 will be shown on progress and final estimates as a separate item
 deduction. When the number of deviations for any property shown
 exceeds the maximum specified, or when the total price reduction
 for a lot is greater than 50%, that lot will not be accepted.
 Continuous production of material not qualifying for full payment
 will not be allowed.
 (1) For Asphalt Binder Content, the contract price of the entire
 lot will be reduced by 12% for each deviation outside the
 compliance limits, up to a maximum of 3 deviations. One
 deviation is 0.1 percentage point.
 (2) For Air Voids, the contract price of the entire lot will be
 reduced by 10% for each deviation outside the compliance limits,
 up to a maximum of 5 deviations. One deviation is 0.1
 percentage point.
 (3) For VMA, the contract price of the entire lot will be
 reduced by 10% for each deviation outside the compliance limits,
 up to a maximum of 5 deviations. One deviation is 0.1
 percentage point.
 (4) For Density, the contract price of the entire lot will be
 reduced by 4% for each deviation outside the compliance limits
 up to a maximum of 10 deviations. One deviation is 0.1
 percentage point.
 410.10 Incentives. It is the intent of this specification to produce
 a pavement that is durable and consistently exceeds the minimum
 test values established in these specifications. To that end,
 incentives will be included in the pay schedule for ACHM Binder
 Course and/or ACHM Surface Course. Incentive pay will be
 according to the following guidelines.
 289
 
 410
 When the entire quantity of either the ACHM Binder Course or
 ACHM Surface Course (including any sublots used for leveling)
 meets the following criteria, an incentive of the percentage
 designated will be applied to the dollar amount for all the
 components of the designated mix. For the purpose of incentives,
 the only tests to be considered shall be the average test results for
 each lot. Incentive payments will be accomplished by Change Order
 and will be shown on the final estimate as a separate item increase.
 An accumulated maximum 6.0% incentive payment is available as
 follows:
 (a) An incentive payment of 3.0% will be added if:
 • the asphalt binder content is within ±0.2 percentage point
 of the mix design value, and
 • the total variation, low to high, in air voids is no more
 than 0.6%, with none outside of the compliance limits,
 and
 • all densities fall between 92.0%* and 96.0%, and
 • there are no areas of segregation outside of the
 compliance limits as verified by testing according to
 Subsection 410.09(b)(3)
 *When the minimum specification density is 90.0%, this
 value is changed to 90.0%.
 (b) An additional incentive payment of 2.0% will be added if the
 requirements of (a) above are met and if the VMA are within the
 compliance limits.
 (c) If the Contractor elects, an additional incentive payment of
 1.0% of the total ACHM Surface Course quantities used on the
 project will be added if:
 • the pavement smoothness incentive criteria are met, and
 • there are no corrective patches*, and
 • the requirements of both (a) and (b) above are met.
 *Note: Any repaved section of 1000' (300 m) or greater in length

 (a) Preparation of Mixture. The temperature of the aggregate
 before adding the asphalt binder shall be not less than 275° F
 (135° C) nor more than 325° F (163° C).
 302
 
 417
 The continuous production of Open Graded Asphalt Base Course
 shall be within plus or minus 25° F (14° C) of the mixing
 temperature shown on the approved mix design. Momentary
 temperature spikes shall be kept to a minimum.
 (b) Spreading and Finishing. The mixture shall be placed
 within 2 hours after production. The mixture shall not be mixed or
 placed when the surface temperature is below 40° F (4° C). The
 mixture, after being spread, shall be compacted in one layer
 according to one of the following methods selected by the
 Contractor:
 (1) The mixture shall be delivered to the paver at no more
 than 25° F (14° C) above the mixing temperature shown on the
 approved mix design, as measured in the hopper of the paving
 machine. Compaction shall be accomplished with one complete
 coverage with a steel-wheeled, 2-axle tandem roller weighing 3.0
 - 5.0 tons (2.7 - 4.5 metric tons). A coverage is a forward pass
 and a back pass over the same portion of the open graded asphalt
 base course. Compaction shall begin as soon as the mixture has
 cooled sufficiently to support the weight of the rolling equipment
 without undue displacement.
 (2) Compaction shall be accomplished with one complete
 coverage with a steel-wheeled, 2-axle tandem roller weighing 7.0
 - 11.0 tons (6.4 - 10.0 metric tons). Compaction shall begin when
 the temperature of the mixture is not more than 180° F (82° C)
 and shall be completed before the mixture has cooled below
 100° F (38° C).
 Vibratory rollers meeting the above requirements may be used
 provided the vibratory unit is turned off.
 (c) Rolling and Density Requirements. The mixture shall be
 consolidated, to the satisfaction of the Engineer, while in a plastic
 condition and as soon after being spread as it will bear the weight of
 the rollers without undue displacement.
 (d) Surface Tests. The finished surface of the open graded
 asphalt base course, when checked with a 10′ (3 m) straightedge
 operated parallel to the centerline, shall show no variation more than
 ½″ (12 mm) when the profile grade is shown on the plans. When
 surface tests indicate surface tolerances do not meet this
 requirement, corrections to the pavement and/or changes in the
 paving operations shall be made before beginning the next day's
 303
 
 417
 operations. The open graded asphalt base course shall be corrected
 with open graded asphalt base course mixture meeting these
 specifications, or if permitted by the Engineer the high spots may be
 removed to within the specified tolerances by any method that does
 not produce contamination of the base with fines nor damage to the
 base course remaining in place. Grinding will not be allowed.
 Hardened open graded asphalt base course with a surface
 tolerance more than ½″ (12 mm) below the grade indicated by the
 surface tests shall be corrected with open graded asphalt base course
 mixture meeting these specifications. All corrective work and
 material necessary to correct surface tolerances shall be at no cost to
 the Department.
 Care shall be exercised to prevent contamination of the base
 course with fines. Open graded asphalt base course that in the
 opinion of the Engineer has been contaminated with fines shall be
 corrected at no cost to the Department.
 (e) Weight Limitations. No traffic or Contractor's equipment
 except the paver will be permitted on the hardened open graded
 asphalt base course. The work of placing the subsequent layer shall
 not begin until the base has been placed on the shoulders flush with
 the open graded asphalt base course. Placing the subsequent layer
 shall be accomplished by unloading the material from the haul
 trucks at the shoulder and conveying the material to the paver. The
 Contractor may propose alternates to the Engineer for the paving
 method, but no haul trucks of any type shall be permitted on the
 open graded asphalt base course. Any damage to the base shall be
 repaired promptly by the Contractor at no cost to the Department
 and as directed by the Engineer.
 417.06 Quality Control, Acceptance, and Adjustments. (a)
 Quality Control. The quality control for all types of Open Graded
 Asphalt Base Course shall be according to Subsection 404.04 except
 that the only properties determined shall be for gradation and asphalt
 binder content.
 (b)Acceptance of the Pavement. Acceptance and adjustment
 will be by the lot as specified in Subsection 410.09(a).
 (1) Asphalt Binder Content. Acceptance of the pavement
 mixture will be according to the applicable parts of Subsection
 410.09(b) except that references to Table 410-1 will be
 interpreted to be Table 417-2.
 304
 
 417
 (2) Gradation. Acceptance of the pavement mixture will be
 according to the criteria that is listed in Table 417-2.
 (c) Unacceptable Pavement. The removal and replacement of
 unacceptable pavement will be according to Subsection 410.09(c).
 (d) Adjustments. Adjustments will be made according to
 Subsection 410.09(d) and the following:
 (1) For aggregate gradation, the contract price of the entire lot
 will be reduced by 5.0% for each deviation outside of the
 compliance limits from the mix design value up to a maximum of
 8 deviations. One deviation is 1%.
 (e) Pavement that is determined to be non-complying for any
 reason other than asphalt content or aggregate gradation will be
 evaluated according to Subsection 105.04. The Engineer will
 determine whether the non-complying pavement must be corrected
 or removed and replaced or may be left in place at a reduced cost to
 the State. Cost reductions according to the provisions of Subsection
 105.04 will be in addition to the cost reductions, if any, determined
 for asphalt content, and aggregate gradation. If the total cost
 reduction is determined to be greater than 50% for any lot, that lot
 will not be accepted.
 When two consecutive lots or any three out of five lots fails to
 qualify for full payment with a price adjustment for any reason,
 work will be stopped until corrective action is taken.
 417.07 Method of Measurement. (a) Mineral aggregate will be
 measured by the ton (metric ton). Mineral filler will not be
 measured or paid for separately but will be considered included in
 the contract unit price bid for mineral aggregate.
 (b) Asphalt binder will be measured by the ton (metric ton).
 Anti-strip additives will not be measured or paid for separately but
 will be considered included in the contract unit price bid for asphalt
 binder.
 Quantities of aggregate and asphalt binder will be determined by
 weighing the composite mixture on truck scales, determining the
 weight of asphalt binder by the accepted mix design, and deducting
 this weight from the total weight of the composite mixture to obtain
 the weight of the mineral aggregate. When an automatic printer
 system is used in conjunction with an automatic batching and
 mixing control system, the printed batch weights will be used in lieu
 305
 
 417
 of truck scales to determine the total weight of the composite
 mixture.
 417.08 Basis of Payment. Work completed and accepted and
 measured as provided above will be paid for as follows:
 (a) Mineral Aggregate will be paid for at the contract unit price
 bid per ton (metric ton) for Mineral Aggregate in Open Graded
 Asphalt Base Course (Ty__).
 In cases where the combined specific gravity of the mineral
 aggregate exceeds 2.80, the quantity of mineral aggregate will be

 continued use.
 The material shall be mixed by a self-propelled mixing machine
 which shall be a continuous flow mixing unit able to accurately
 deliver and proportion the aggregate, emulsified asphalt, mineral
 filler, additives, and water to a revolving multi-blade mixer and
 discharge the mixed product on a continuous flow basis. The
 machine shall have sufficient storage capacity for aggregate,
 emulsified asphalt, mineral filler, and water to maintain an adequate
 supply to the proportioning controls. The machine shall be equipped
 with self-loading devices which provide for the loading of all
 310
 
 418
 materials while continuing to lay slurry seal, thereby minimizing
 construction joints.
 Individual volume or weight controls for proportioning each
 material to be included in the mixture shall be provided. Each
 material control device shall be calibrated and properly marked.
 Calibration shall be performed prior to starting the project and in the
 presence of the Engineer. Documentation shall be included for each
 individual calibration of material at the various settings, which can
 be related to the machine's metering devices. The machine will be
 equipped with a metering device for the mineral filler which
 indicates the quantity used. No machine will be allowed to work on
 the project until the calibration has been completed and/or accepted.
 Calibration shall be verified by the Contractor using AHTD Test
 Method 466 under observation by the Engineer.
 The emulsion pump shall be a positive displacement type and
 shall be equipped with a revolution counter or similar device so that
 the amount of emulsion used may be determined at any time.
 The mixing machine shall be equipped with a water pressure
 system and nozzle type spray bar to provide a water spray
 immediately ahead of and outside the spreader box.
 The mixing machine shall be equipped with an approved fines
 feeder and liquid additives feeder that shall provide a uniform,
 positive, accurately metered, predetermined amount of the specified
 mineral filler.
 418.05 Stockpiling and Storage. (a) Aggregate Storage. If the
 mineral aggregates are stored or stockpiled, they shall be handled in
 such a manner as to prevent segregation, mixing of the various
 materials or sizes, and contamination with foreign materials. The
 grading of aggregates supplied to the mixing plant shall be uniform.
 Suitable equipment of acceptable size shall be furnished by the
 contractor to work the stockpiles and prevent segregation of the
 aggregates. If a polymer modified slurry seal is specified, a scale
 system shall be supplied by the Contractor to weigh the aggregate.
 The scale shall provide printed tickets for each truck loaded.
 (b) Storage and Heating of Asphalt Materials. The asphalt
 material storage shall be ample to meet the requirements of the
 plant. Asphalt emulsion shall not be heated to a temperature in
 excess of 160° F (71° C). All equipment used in the storage and
 handling of asphalt material shall be kept in a clean condition at all
 311
 
 418
 times and shall be operated in such manner that there will be no
 contamination by foreign matter.
 418.06 Construction Methods. (a) General. It shall be the
 responsibility of the Contractor to produce, transport, and place the
 specified paving mixture according to these specifications and as
 approved by the Engineer.
 (b) Seasonal Limitations. No slurry seal shall be placed after
 October 15 or before May 1 without prior approval by the Engineer.
 Slurry seal shall not be applied if either the pavement or ambient
 temperature is 55° F (13° C) or less.
 (c) Surface Preparation. The area to be sealed shall be
 thoroughly cleaned of all vegetation, loose aggregate and soil.
 Utility entrances within the area to be sealed shall be protected from
 the slurry seal by the use of plastic coverings or other methods. All
 utility entrances shall be uncovered before the surface is reopened to
 traffic. Water used to pre-wet the surface ahead of and outside the
 spreader box shall be applied at a rate which will dampen the entire
 surface without any free flowing water ahead of the spreader box.
 (d) Traffic Control. It shall be contractor's responsibility to
 provide adequate traffic control measures, such as barricades, cones,
 advance warning signs, flagmen, etc., to protect the uncured slurry
 seal from all types of traffic and to provide traffic safety in the
 construction area. These measures shall be employed in a safe
 manner and must not be used until approved by the Engineer.
 Opening the roadway surface to traffic does not constitute
 acceptance of the work. Any damage to the uncured slurry seal
 material will be the responsibility of the Contractor and the damaged
 surface shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the Engineer. Interim
 pavement marking shall be provided according to Subsection
 604.03(f).
 (e) Spreading Equipment. The paving mixture shall be spread
 uniformly by means of a mechanical type squeegee box attached to
 the mixer and equipped with paddles to agitate and spread the
 materials throughout the box. A front seal shall be provided to
 ensure no loss of the mixture at the road contact surface. The rear
 seal shall act as a final strike off and shall be a uniform skid resistant
 application of aggregate and asphalt on the surface. The spreader
 box and rear strike-off shall be so designed and operated that a
 uniform consistency is achieved while producing a free flow of
 312
 
 418
 material to the rear strike-off. A secondary strike-off shall be used
 to provide uniformity. The seam where two spreads join shall be
 neat and uniform in appearance.
 (f) Rut Filling. When ruts exceed 1/2" (12 mm) in depth on
 projects that specify polymer modified slurry seal, a separate
 leveling course shall be placed to fill the ruts. The leveling course
 shall be placed utilizing a rut filling vee-box. The ruts shall be
 reprofiled as to allow a crown of 1/4" (6 mm) for every 1″ (25 mm)
 of rut depth. Traffic shall be allowed to compact the filled ruts for
 24 hours prior to the placement of the full width seal course.
 (g) Workmanship. No excessive buildup, uncovered areas or
 unsightly appearance will be permitted at longitudinal or transverse
 joints.
 Longitudinal joints shall be placed at lane lines. Excessive
 overlap will not be permitted. Care shall be taken to ensure straight
 lines along the roadway centerline, lane lines. shoulder, or curb
 lines. Lines at intersections shall be kept straight to provide a good
 appearance.
 Care shall be exercised in areas that require hand work so that the
 finished surface is uniform in texture, density, and of overall
 appearance comparable to that produced by the spreader box.
 Areas of non-uniform texture, density, or appearance will be
 patched as directed. Patching shall be done using the same process
 and equipment that originally surfaced the area. Handworking of
 patches will not be permitted, except as authorized by the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall supervise and direct the work, using their
 best skill and attention. The work shall be directed using any means
 as is the custom of the trade to complete the work in an acceptable
 manner.
 (h) Acceptance of the Slurry Seal and Adjustments.
 (1) General. Acceptance and adjustment will be based on the
 test results for asphalt content and gradation listed in Table 418-1
 by the lot, which will be defined as 120,000 square yards
 (100,000 square meters), and the sublot, which will be defined as
 30,000 square yards (25,000 square meters), with no less than
 one test per project. Asphalt content shall be determined using
 AHTD Test Methods 449/449A , AHTD Test Method 450 or
 451, or AHTD Test Method 467 as directed by the Engineer.
 313
 
 418
 Gradation shall be determined using either AHTD Test Method
 460 or 467 as directed by the Engineer. The Department shall
 determine the location for each sample in the sublot by AHTD
 Test Method 465.
 The Department will obtain and test one sample taken at
 random from each lot, including partial lots, to be used both for
 verification and for acceptance. The location of the lot sample
 will be determined by the Department using AHTD Test
 Method 465.
 (a) Acceptance of the Pavement. Acceptance of a
 standard lot for asphalt content and gradation listed in Table
 418-1 will be based on the average of the five (5) tests
 performed on the lot. Acceptance of a partial lot will be based
 on the average of the actual number of tests made on that
 partial lot. Acceptance of a sublot will be based on the results
 of the test(s) performed on samples from that sublot.
 In Table 418-1, the term "specification limit(s)" refers to
 those limits and/or values shown in the tables of design values
 for the various types of mix. The term "mix design value"
 refers to the value shown in the accepted mix design.
 When the average of the test results for a lot fall within the
 range shown in Table 418-1 as "Compliance Limits", the lot
 will be accepted with no price reduction for those properties.
 If the average of the test results for a lot for any single
 property listed in the table falls within the limits shown as
 "Price Reduction Limits", the material may be left in place at a
 reduced price as specified in Subsection 418.06(h)(1)(c)
 below. If the average of the test results for a lot for any single
 property listed in the table falls outside the limits shown as
 "Lot Rejection Limits", the entire lot shall be removed and
 replaced at no cost to the Department. Sampling and testing
 of the replacement material will be according to the same
 sampling and testing requirements specified above.
 For any single property, if the result of the single test in a
 sublot falls outside the limits shown as "Sublot Rejection
 Limits", that sublot shall be removed and replaced at no cost
 to the Department. In the sublot containing the Department's
 lot test, if the result of either the Contractor's sublot test or the
 Department's lot test fall outside the sublot rejection limits, the
 314
 
 418
 two tests will be averaged and the average of the two test
 results used to determine acceptance or rejection. The average
 of the two test results will also be used as a single value to
 compute the average for the lot for acceptance and adjustment.
 (b) Unacceptable Pavement. Any lot or section of any
 slurry seal course that is not accepted for any reason shall be
 removed and replaced by the Contractor at no cost to the
 Department. Payment for sections where removal and
 replacement is required will be withheld or recovered, and
 released after replacement has been acceptably completed.
 The quantity for payment will be the original quantity and
 measurement of the quantity used in replacement operations
 will not be considered.
 (c) Adjustments. Adjustments will be made by reducing
 the contract price of the lot according to the schedules below.
 Price reductions will be computed from the schedules below
 for each property, and reductions for each property added
 together to obtain the total price reduction for the lot. The
 total price reduction will be applied to all components of the
 course for the entire quantity of the lot. Price reductions will
 be accomplished by Change Order and will be shown on
 progress and final estimates as a separate item deduction.
 When the number of deviations for any property shown
 exceeds the maximum specified, or when the total price
 reduction for a lot is greater than 50%, that lot will not be
 accepted. Continuous production of material not qualifying
 for full payment will not be allowed.
 (1) For Asphalt Binder Content, the contract price of the
 entire lot will be reduced by 12% for each deviation outside
 the compliance limits, up to a maximum of 3 deviations.
 One deviation is 0.1 percentage point.
 (2) For aggregate gradation, the contract price of the
 entire lot will be reduced by 5.0% for each deviation
 outside of the compliance limits from the mix design
 value up to a maximum of 8 deviations. One deviation
 is 1%.
 418.07 Method of Measurement. Slurry Seal will be measured
 by the square yard (square meter). Aggregate in Slurry Seal
 (Polymer Modified), which shall include the aggregate and mineral
 315
 
 418
 filler, will be measured by the ton (metric ton). Asphalt in Slurry
 Seal (Polymer Modified), which shall include the polymer modifier,
 will be measured by the gallon (liter).
 418.08 Basis of Payment. Work completed and accepted and
 measured as provided above will be paid for as follows:
 (a) Slurry Seal will be paid for at the contract unit price bid per
 square yard (square meter) for Slurry Seal.
 (b) Mineral aggregate and mineral filler in Slurry Seal (Polymer
 Modified) will be paid for at the contract unit price bid per ton
 (metric ton) for Aggregate in Slurry Seal (Polymer Modified).
 (c) Asphalt emulsion in Slurry Seal (Polymer Modified) will be
 paid for at the contract unit price bid per gallon (liter) for Asphalt in
 Slurry Seal (Polymer Modified).
 Field control additives will not be paid for separately, but full
 compensation therefor will be considered included in the contract
 unit price bid for Slurry Seal or Slurry Seal (Polymer Modified).
 The contract unit prices mentioned above shall be full
 compensation for furnishing materials; for designing the mixture,
 including trial mixtures required; for performing quality control and
 acceptance sampling and testing; for preparation of the surface; for
 heating, mixing, hauling, placing, and finishing; and for all labor,
 equipment, tools, and incidentals necessary to complete the work.

 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 501.01 Description. This item shall consist of constructing a
 pavement composed of portland cement concrete, with or without
 reinforcement as specified, constructed on a prepared subgrade or
 base course according to these specifications and conforming to the
 lines, grades, thicknesses, and typical cross sections shown on the
 plans or established by the Engineer.
 Design and Quality Control of Portland Cement Concrete
 Pavement will consist of the Contractor furnishing acceptable mix
 designs and performing all applicable quality control sampling and
 testing for Portland cement concrete pavement according to these
 provisions.
 501.02 Materials. The materials used shall comply with the
 requirements as set out herein. No materials shall be used
 containing foreign matter, frost, or lumps or crusts of hardened
 substances.
 (a) Cement. Unless otherwise specified, Portland cement
 conforming to the requirements of AASHTO M 85, Type I shall be
 furnished. One of the following blended cements may be used in
 lieu of Type I:
 • Portland-Pozzolan Cement, AASHTO M 240, Type IP (20%
 maximum)
 • Slag-Modified Portland Cement, AASHTO M 240, Type IS
 (25% maximum)
 Fly ash or slag cement shall not be substituted for blended
 cements. Cement, blended cement, fly ash, and slag cement shall be
 from sources that are listed on the Department’s Qualified Products
 List and that have executed a certification agreement with the
 Department.
 318
 
 501
 The total alkalis in the Portland cement (Na2O + 0.658 K2O) shall
 not exceed 0.60%. The total alkalis in the cementitious material
 (Portland cement, fly ash or slag cement) shall not exceed 5 lb/cu yd
 (3 kg/cu m). In lieu of using low alkali cement as specified, the
 contractor may choose alternative testing of the proposed aggregates
 and cementitious materials as follows:
 Option 1 – Test the fine and coarse aggregate sources in
 accordance with AASHTO T 303. If the 14 day expansion ≤
 0.10%, the requirement for low-alkali cement is waived. If the
 14 day expansion is greater than 0.10%, further testing per
 Option 2 below is required using slag cement or fly ash.
 Option 2 – Test using the specific job materials and selected
 replacement level of supplemental cementitious materials (slag
 cement or fly ash) proposed for the project according to
 AASHTO T 303. If the 14 day expansion is ≤ 0.10%, the
 requirement for low-alkali cement is waived. If the 14 day
 expansion is greater than 0.10%, additional testing with a
 different cement, different supplemental cementitious material,
 and/or different replacement level is required.
 Cement shall be furnished in bulk. The mixing or alternate use of
 cement from different manufacturing plants will not be permitted.
 The source of cement shall not be changed without the written
 approval of the Engineer. The use of cement salvaged from spillage
 will not be allowed. Cement placed in storage shall be suitably
 protected. Loss in quality occurring during the storage period will
 be cause for rejection. If the cement furnished produces erratic
 results under the field conditions incident to the placing of the
 concrete, or in regard to the strength of the finished product, or in
 the time of the initial or final set, the Contractor shall, without notice
 from the Engineer, cease the use of that source of cement.
 (b) Fine Aggregate. The fine aggregate shall consist of clean,
 hard, durable particles of natural sand or other approved inert
 material with similar characteristics.

 proportions specified below.
 326
 
 501
 The air content of the fresh concrete, as determined by
 AASHTO T 152, shall be 6% ± 2%. The air entrainment shall be
 accomplished by adding to the mixing water the proper amount of
 an air entraining agent in solution.
 When air-entrained concrete is specified, the air-entraining agent
 and the retarding agent shall be so incorporated that the air content
 of the concrete shall fall within the percentage range stipulated in
 the specifications. When air-entrained concrete is not specified, the
 concrete to which the retarding agent has been added shall have an
 air content not greater than 3 percent.
 The minimum cement content shall be 564 pounds (6 sacks) of
 cement per cubic yard (335 kg of cement per cubic meter) of
 concrete.
 The water/cement ratio shall not exceed 0.45 pound per pound
 (5.1 gallons per bag)[ 0.45 kg/kg] (including the free moisture
 content of the aggregate). When fly ash or slag cement is used as a
 partial replacement for cement, the total weight of both cement and
 fly ash or slag cement shall be used to determine the water/cement
 ratio.
 Fly ash may be used as a partial replacement for Type I cement,
 not exceeding 20% by weight. Substitution shall be made at the rate
 of one pound (kilogram) of fly ash for each pound (kilogram) of
 cement replaced. Mixtures with fly ash shall meet the same
 requirements as mixtures without fly ash. Fly ash will not be
 allowed as a substitute for high early strength or blended cements.
 Slag cement may be used as a partial replacement for Type I
 cement, not exceeding 25% by weight. Substitution shall be made at
 a rate of one kilogram (pound) of slag cement for each pound
 (kilogram) of cement replaced. Slag cement will not be allowed as a
 substitute for high early strength or blended cements. Ternary mixes
 (cement, fly ash, and slag cement) are not allowed.
 The minimum 28 day compressive strength shall be 4000 psi
 (28.0 MPa) when tested according to AASHTO T 22. Test
 327
 
 501
 specimens will be made and cured according to AASHTO T 23 or
 T 126 as applicable.
 The mixed concrete shall have a uniform consistency with a
 slump, as determined by AASHTO T 119, of not more than 2″
 (50 mm).
 A Type A water reducing concrete admixture or mid-range water
 reducing concrete admixture may be used with the approval of the
 Engineer. All admixtures shall comply with Subsection 501.02.
 Fine and coarse aggregate shall be added only in such proportion
 that satisfactory plasticity, workability, and consistency of the mix
 are maintained, with the further provision that the ratio of the fine
 aggregate to cement, based on dry and rodded measure, shall be not
 less than 1.5 nor more than 2.5.
 The specified water/cement ratio shall not be exceeded and the
 minimum cement content shall be met.
 A minimum of 15 working days prior to the commencement of
 paving operations, the contractor shall submit to the Engineer for
 review and approval the following:
 •
 
 Certification for the low alkali cement proposed for use OR
 the results of the fine and coarse aggregates Potential Alkali
 Reactivity test (AASHTO T 303) in accordance with
 Options 1 or 2 of Subsection 501.02.
 
 •
 
 A Job Mix Formula (JMF) that contains sources of all
 aggregates proposed for use, a composite gradation of all
 aggregates, and proportions of each aggregate. Individual
 gradations of each aggregate shall be included. The Job
 Mix Formula may only be changed upon written approval of
 the Engineer. Composite gradations will be calculated using
 AHTD Test Method 588.
 
 (b) Mix Design by the Contractor. The proportions to be used
 in the mix shall be determined by the Contractor using the absolute
 volume method. The Contractor may use the procedure provided in
 the ACI Standard 211.1 or Portland Cement Association “Design
 328
 
 501
 and Control of Concrete Mixes”, modified to comply with the
 minimum cement content and maximum water/cement ratio
 specified. Prior to the start of production of the concrete mixture,
 the Contractor shall submit test results and/or certifications for all
 materials and detailed mix design data to the Engineer. Aggregate,
 fly ash, and slag cement material properties used in the mix design
 shall be representative of the exact materials proposed for use. The
 testing source (commercial laboratory, qualified technician, AHTD
 provided data, etc.) and the date of the test shall be provided. The
 specific plant sources for the cement, fly ash or slag cement , and
 aggregates shall be shown on the mix design. The documentation
 submitted with the mix design shall specify which procedure was
 used and whether oven dry or saturated surface dry weights were
 used in the calculations. The mix design shall specify the quantity
 of each component of the mix, including all authorized additives.
 Acceptance of the mix design by the Engineer will be based on
 apparent conformity to the requirements in Subsection 501.03(a). If
 the mix design fails to produce acceptable results or if there is a
 change in the aggregates, fly ash, slag cement, or cement being used,
 a new mix design will be required. It shall remain the Contractor’s
 responsibility during production to produce concrete conforming to
 the mix design and the minimum acceptance criteria specified.
 When requested by the Engineer, the Contractor shall submit
 samples of all materials for verification testing. Production shall not
 begin until the mix design is accepted by the Engineer.
 A mix design submitted for acceptance need not be prepared
 specifically for this project, but may be a previously accepted design
 that uses the same materials and meets the same design criteria.
 Mix designs accepted under this section will become the property
 of the Department and may be accepted for use on other projects, by
 other contractors, or by the Department.
 501.04 Quality Control, Acceptance, and Adjustments in
 Payments.
 (a) Quality Control by the Contractor. The
 Contractor shall perform all applicable quality control sampling and
 329
 
 501
 testing of the Portland cement concrete pavements used on the
 project.
 The Contractor is responsible for product quality control during

 and for necessary adjustments in proportioning of the materials to
 produce an acceptable mix. The Contractor shall perform all
 applicable quality control sampling and testing required ensuring
 that the completed concrete pavement complies with all
 requirements of the specifications. The Contractor shall furnish all
 personnel, equipment, and facilities necessary to perform the
 required sampling and testing. The Contractor’s facilities shall be
 separate from any Field Laboratory and/or Field Office furnished to
 the Department under the Contract. Quality control sampling and
 testing by the Contractor shall be performed in a qualified laboratory
 by a certified technician. Requirements for technician certification
 and laboratory qualification are contained in the Department’s
 Manual of Field Sampling and Testing Procedures.
 Quality control sampling and testing shall be accomplished in a
 timely manner. Sampling and testing shall be planned and
 conducted so that a representative sample is obtained and tested.
 The Contractor shall determine the specific locations for samples
 and frequency of sampling for quality control, except the minimum
 frequency which is listed below for aggregate gradation shall be
 used. In addition, the Contractor shall be required to perform
 acceptance sampling and testing at specific times and/or locations
 specified by the Engineer according to Subsection 501.04(b). The
 Contractor may use the results of these required tests in his quality
 control program.

 501
 An adequate supply of aggregate must be stockpiled to allow
 representative sampling in advance of any placement, with the
 minimum amount being that required to complete the day’s planned
 placement. The initial quality control test results for gradation must
 be completed and the test results submitted to the Engineer prior to
 the beginning of mix production each day. Subsequent tests shall be
 taken and tested during production and test reports submitted to the
 Engineer by the end of the next business day after the sample is
 taken. Any failing gradation test result will result in halting
 production. The aggregate remaining in the stockpile will be
 resampled and tested by the Contractor and the Engineer. If the test
 results indicate that the aggregate is outside of the specification
 limits in Subsection 501.02(b) and (c) or varies from the Job Mix
 Formula in excess of the limits shown below, the stockpile shall
 either be corrected or replaced. Passing test reports must be
 submitted to the Engineer before work resumes.

 Sampling and testing for acceptance and adjustment of payment
 will be performed as specified in Subsection 501.04(b) and
 501.04(c).
 The Contractor shall provide an opportunity for the Engineer to
 observe all quality control sampling and testing procedures. The
 332
 
 501
 Contractor's quality control personnel may observe the AHTD
 project personnel during acceptance sampling and testing for the
 purpose of comparing sampling and testing procedures.
 The Contractor shall maintain a daily plot of all test results, and
 make the plots available to the Engineer. Upon completion of work
 on the item, these plots shall be furnished to the Resident Engineer
 for inclusion in the project files. The Resident Engineer will make
 acceptance test results available to the Contractor's personnel.
 If the test results show that the material is outside the mix design
 limits, is widely varying, or is consistently marginal, corrective
 action shall be taken. Corrective actions taken shall be based on the
 Contractor's quality control test results. The Department's inspector
 will be notified of all proposed corrective actions before their
 implementation. If excessive changes are required, production will
 be suspended and a new mix design shall be developed according to
 the applicable specifications.
 Quality Control and Acceptance testing of Portland Cement
 Concrete Pavements will not be paid for separately, but full
 compensation therefor will be considered included in the contract
 unit prices bid for the Portland cement concrete pavements used on
 the project.
 (b) Acceptance Testing. Acceptance will be by lot. The
 standard lot size for acceptance will be 4000 cubic yards (3000
 cubic meters), with each standard lot divided into four sublots of
 1000 cubic yards (750 cubic meters) each. The Engineer may
 establish a partial lot at any time. The Engineer will determine the
 size of any partial lots established and the number and size(s) of the
 sublots, if any. Although there are no specified limits for the size of
 such partial lots, they normally will be not less than 400 cubic yards
 (300 cubic meters) nor more than 4400 cubic yards (3300 cubic
 meters).
 Thickness determination shall be made from cores sampled for
 compressive strength tests. The Contractor shall drill and fill core
 holes with a material approved by the Engineer at no cost to the
 333
 
 501
 Department. Slump and air content will be determined by testing
 fresh concrete. Compressive strength will be determined by testing
 pavement cores at least 28 days and no more than 90 days after the
 concrete has been placed. Test methods for acceptance shall be the
 same as specified for quality control testing. Acceptance sampling
 and testing by the Contractor shall be performed in a qualified
 laboratory by a certified technician. Requirements for technician
 certification and laboratory qualification are contained in the
 Department’s Manual of Field Sampling and Testing Procedures.
 The Contractor shall obtain and test one sample taken at random
 from each sublot. The Department will determine the location for
 each sample in the sublot by AHTD Test Method 465. The
 Department's inspector shall be provided an opportunity to witness
 all Contractor sampling and testing. The test reports of all
 Contractor acceptance tests shall be provided to the Engineer on the
 next business day after the tests are performed.
 The Department will obtain and test a minimum of one sample
 taken at random from each lot, including partial lots, to be used both
 for verification and for acceptance. Verification testing will be
 conducted in accordance with Subsection 106.11 and the
 Department’s Manual of Field Sampling and Testing Procedures.
 The location of the lot sample will be determined by the Department
 using AHTD Test Method 465.
 The Contractor’s acceptance sampling and testing procedures,
 equipment, and results will be subject to independent assurance
 sampling and testing conducted by the Department. Independent
 assurance sampling and testing will be conducted at the frequencies
 indicated in the Department’s Manual of Field Sampling and Testing
 Procedures. The Contractor shall be required to make changes to
 the equipment and/or procedures used if the results of the
 independent assurance tests do not correlate with the Contractor’s
 test results.
 The Department will perform all tests for acceptance of material
 used to replace unacceptable material removed by the Contractor.
 The number of tests and the location(s) for sampling will be
 334
 
 501
 determined by the Engineer using the same procedures used for the
 original material. The results of these tests will be used for
 acceptance of the lot or sublot, as applicable.
 Additional requirements for concrete pavement are specified in
 Subsection 501.05(m), Surface Evenness and Testing, and
 Subsection 501.10, Tolerance in Pavement Thickness.
 It is anticipated that when Portland cement concrete pavement is
 placed over the open graded base course, the concrete will penetrate
 the open graded base course. However, no adjustment in payment
 for Portland cement concrete pavement will be made as a result of
 this penetration.
 When cores are taken to determine the compressive strength and
 thickness of the Portland cement concrete pavement, it is anticipated
 that a layer of open graded base course will adhere to the bottom of
 the core. All particles of open graded base course shall be removed
 from the bottom of the core prior to measuring the core for
 determining the thickness of the Portland cement concrete
 pavement.
 (c) Acceptance of the Pavement and Adjustments in
 Payments. Acceptance of Portland Cement Concrete Pavements
 courses will be based on the following criteria:
 • The results of tests for the properties listed in Table 501-1
 • Pavement smoothness, Subsection 501.05(m)
 • Pavement thickness, Subsection 501.10.
 All sampling and testing for acceptance and for adjustments in
 payments shall be performed using the test methods specified in
 Subsection 501.04(a) for quality control sampling and testing.
 Samples for all properties except gradation and moisture shall be
 obtained at the project site.
 Acceptance with respect to the properties listed in Table 501-1
 will be by lot. Acceptance of a standard lot will be based on the
 average of the five (5) tests performed on the lot. Acceptance of a
 partial lot will be based on the average of the actual number of tests
 335
 
 501
 made on that partial lot. Acceptance of a sublot will be based on the
 results of the test(s) performed on samples from that sublot.
 When the average of the test results for a lot fall within the range
 shown in Table 501-1 as "Compliance Limits", the lot will be
 accepted with no price reduction for those properties. If the average
 of the test results for a lot for any single property listed in the table
 falls within the limits shown as "Price Reduction Limits", the
 material may be left in place at a reduced price as shown in Table
 501-1. If the average of the test results for a lot for any single
 property listed in the table falls outside the limits shown as "Lot
 Rejection Limits", the entire lot shall be removed and replaced at no
 cost to the Department. Sampling and testing of the replacement
 material will be according to Subsection 501.04(b).
 For any single property, if the result of the single test in a sublot
 falls outside the limits shown as "Sublot Rejection Limits", that
 sublot shall be removed and replaced at no cost to the Department.
 In the sublot containing the Department's lot test, if the result of
 either the Contractor's sublot test or the Department's lot test fall
 outside the sublot rejection limits, the two tests will be averaged and
 the average of the two test results used to determine acceptance or
 rejection. The average of the two test results will also be used as a
 single value to compute the average for the lot for acceptance and
 adjustment.
 Pavement that is determined to be non-complying for any reason
 other than the properties listed in Table 501-1 will be evaluated
 under Subsection 105.04. The Engineer will determine whether the
 non-complying pavement must be corrected, removed and replaced,
 or may be left in place at a reduced cost to the Department. Price
 reductions determined under Subsection 105.04 will be in addition
 to the price reductions, if any, determined under this Subsection,
 501.04(c). If the total price reduction is determined to be greater
 than 50% for any lot, that lot will not be accepted.
 Any lot or section of any Portland cement concrete pavement that
 is not accepted for any reason shall be removed and replaced by the
 Contractor at no cost to the Department. Payment for sections
 336
 
 501
 where removal and replacement is required will be withheld or
 recovered, and released after replacement has been acceptably
 completed. The quantity for payment will be the original quantity
 and measurement of the quantity used in replacement operations will
 not be considered.
 At the Contractor’s option additional testing for confirming price
 reductions or pavement rejection due to compressive strength results
 may be performed by the Contractor at locations determined by the
 Department. In such cases, three cores shall be taken in each sublot
 containing compressive strength results not in Compliance Limits.
 The compressive strength shall be determined by the average result
 of the cores. Cores shall be sampled according to AASHTO T 24.
 The average of the three cores must meet or exceed applicable price
 reductions limits or pavement rejection limits. Acceptance and pay
 adjustments will then be determined based on these results. This
 testing will performed at no cost to the Department. The holes made
 in taking the samples shall be repaired by the Contractor at no cost
 to the Department.
 Adjustments will be made by reducing the contract price of the
 lot according to Table 501-1. Price reductions will be computed
 from Table 501-1 for each property, and reductions for each
 property added together to obtain the total price reduction for the lot.
 The total price reduction will be applied to all components of the
 pavement for the entire quantity of the lot. Price reductions will be
 accomplished by Change Order and will be shown on progress and
 final estimates as a separate item deduction. When the number of
 deviations for any property shown exceeds the maximum specified,
 or when the total price reduction for a lot is greater than 50%, that
 lot will not be accepted.
 When two consecutive lots or any three out of five consecutive
 lots fail to qualify for full payment for any reason, work will be
 stopped until corrective action is taken. Continuous production of
 pavement not qualifying for full payment will not be allowed.
 501.05 Construction Requirements. Equipment, tools, and
 machinery used on mainlane and ramp pavements shall be

 specifically designed for placing, consolidating, and finishing
 Portland cement concrete pavement and shall be maintained in a
 satisfactory working condition.
 The methods employed in
 performing the work and all equipment, tools, and machinery used
 for handling materials and executing any part of the work shall be
 subject to the approval of the Engineer. Either the slip form paver
 or side form method may be used.
 (a) Subgrade. The subgrade shall be prepared in compliance
 with Section 212.
 (b) Handling and Storage of Materials. The handling and
 storage of concrete aggregates shall be such as to prevent
 segregation and contamination with foreign materials.
 Coarse and fine aggregates shall be separated by bulkheads or
 stored in separate stockpiles sufficiently removed from each other to
 prevent the material at the edges of the piles from becoming intermixed. Coarse aggregate stockpiles that are not confined by
 bulkheads or bins shall be built up in layers or wedges not to exceed
 4′ (1.25 m) in height, and each layer shall be completely in place
 before beginning the next. Coning or building up of stockpiles by
 depositing material in one place will not be permitted.
 Coarse aggregates secured from different sources shall be
 unloaded into separate stockpiles and proportioned through separate
 storage bins. The Contractor will be required to furnish such
 additional storage bins and auxiliary equipment as may be necessary
 to combine and proportion the aggregate for the accepted mix.
 There shall be adequate aggregate stockpiled to allow
 representative sampling sufficiently in advance of any placement to
 determine its acceptability, with the minimum amount being that
 required to adequately complete the planned placement. The
 stockpiles shall be large enough to ensure that the moisture content
 of any class of aggregates will remain sufficiently uniform to allow
 the accurate control of the amount of water entering into the
 concrete.
 Cement shall be stored in suitable weatherproof buildings or silos
 that will protect the cement from dampness.
 339
 
 501
 (c) Measuring Materials.
 (1) General. Batch plants shall be equipped to proportion
 aggregates and bulk cement by weight by means of automatic and
 interlocking proportioning devices of approved type.
 Measuring devices shall be operated in a manner that will
 consistently allow the exact weight of cement within ±1%,
 individual aggregates within ±2%, and total weight of aggregate
 within ±2% of the required weight. Measuring devices shall be
 so designed and plainly marked that the weights can be
 accurately and conveniently verified for the quantities of each
 component actually being used.
 The batching plant shall be equipped with an automatic
 weighing system, including an automatic ticket printer, as
 described in Subsection 109.01(f). A load ticket shall accompany
 each load delivered to the project and shall be furnished to the
 Engineer at the time of delivery. The load ticket shall show the
 following information:
 1. Unique ticket number.
 2. Identification of the truck.
 3. Date and time of batching.
 4. Total weights and/or volumes of each component.
 5. Total volume of mix.
 6. Total quantity of water added after batching.
 7. Time of discharge.
 A printout showing the above information for each truckload
 of mix may be maintained at the plant and provided to the
 Engineer at the end of the day’s run whenever a dedicated central
 batch plant is used to provide concrete for the paving operation.
 This printout for the day’s operation will be accepted in lieu of
 individual tickets accompanying each load.
 (2) Aggregates. Aggregates shall be measured separately and
 accurately by weight. The batch plant shall include batcher bins,
 of either the stationary or mobile type, with adequate separate
 compartments for fine aggregate, each compartment designed to
 discharge efficiently and freely into the weighing hopper or
 340
 
 501
 hoppers. Means of control shall be provided in each case so that
 as the quantity desired in the weighing hopper is being
 approached, the material may be added slowly in small quantities
 and shut off with precision. Means of removing any overload of
 any one of the several materials shall be provided.
 In the type where more than one aggregate is weighed into one
 hopper, each aggregate shall be held in a separate compartment,
 so arranged that an overload of any aggregate can be removed.
 Hoppers shall be constructed so as to eliminate accumulations of
 tare materials and to fully discharge without jarring the scales.
 Partitions between compartments, both in bins and in hoppers,
 shall be ample to prevent mixing of adjacent materials under any
 working conditions. Batch plant structures shall be maintained
 properly leveled within the accuracy required by the design of the
 weighing mechanism.
 The scales for weighing aggregates and cement may be the
 horizontal beam, the springless dial, or the electronic type,
 designed as an integral unit of the batch plant, of rugged
 construction to withstand hard usage due to working conditions,
 and shall have a maximum allowable error of ±½% of one net
 load. When beam-type scales are used, provisions such as a "telltale" dial, shall be made for indicating to the operator that the
 required load in the weighing hopper is being approached, which
 device shall indicate at least the last 200 pounds (90 kg) of load.
 A device on weighing beams shall indicate critical position
 clearly. Poises shall be designed for locking in any position and
 to prevent unauthorized removal. The weigh beam and the "telltale" device shall be in full view of the operator while charging
 the hopper. The operator shall have convenient access to all
 controls.
 Clearance between scale parts, hoppers, and bin structures
 shall be such as to avoid displacement of, or friction between,
 parts due to accumulations, vibration, or other causes. Pivot
 mountings shall be designed so none of the parts will jar loose
 341
 
 501
 and so as to assure unchanging spacing of knife edges. Scales
 shall be so designed that all exposed fulcrums, clevises, and
 similar working parts may readily be kept clean. Scales shall be
 constructed of non-corrosive materials, excluding material softer
 than brass. Weight beams shall have leveling lugs, and weighing
 parts of other types shall be provided with means for precision
 adjustment. Scales shall be satisfactory to the Engineer and shall
 be inspected, adjusted, and certified by a registered scale
 mechanic according to Subsection 109.01(f).
 (3) Cement. Cement shall be proportioned on the basis of 94
 pounds per cubic foot (1500 kg/cu m) and shall be measured by
 weight on scales as specified above.
 Pneumatic charging of the weigh hopper shall be so arranged
 that the measurement will not be affected by air pressure in the
 supply line.
 (4) Water. The mixer shall be equipped with an automatic
 water measuring device that shall be within a range of error not to
 exceed ±1% and shall be so arranged that the measurement will
 not be affected by variations of pressure in the water supply line
 and will be accurate under all construction conditions
 encountered. Water may be measured either by volume or by
 weight.
 (5) Admixtures. The mixer shall be equipped with an
 approved automatic dispenser for adding to the mixing water the
 desired amount of admixtures.
 The dispenser shall be
 constructed and connected so that the amount of admixture
 entering into the mixing water can be visually determined.
 (d) Mixing Concrete. Concrete shall be mixed according to
 Subsection 802.08 except as follows:
 Concrete shall be delivered and discharged from the truck mixer
 or agitator into the paver or forms within one hour after the
 introduction of the mixing water to the cement. The Contractor
 shall supply sufficient trucks to assure a steady forward progress of
 the paver.
 (e) Cold Weather Concreting. Concreting operations will not
 be permitted when a descending air temperature falls below 40° F
 (5° C) nor resumed until an ascending air temperature reaches 35° F
 (2° C) without specific authority from the Engineer. When
 342
 
 501
 operations are authorized under such conditions or when it is
 anticipated that the air temperature will fall below 40° F (5° C)
 before the concrete has taken its final set, the concrete surface shall
 be covered with suitable material and to such depth as to prevent
 freezing. The covering shall remain in place until the slab has
 thoroughly cured. Under no circumstances will the placing of
 concrete on a frozen subgrade be permitted.
 (f) Protection Against Rain. In order that concrete may be
 properly protected against the effects of rain before the concrete is
 sufficiently hardened, the Contractor shall have available at all times
 materials for the protection of the edges and surface of the
 unhardened concrete. When rain appears imminent, all paving
 operations shall stop. Any concrete damaged by rain shall be
 repaired or removed and replaced by the Contractor at no cost to the
 Department.
 (g) Dowel and Tie Bars. The Contractor shall establish the
 location of all dowel bars and tie bars and place them as shown on
 the plans. The dowel bars shall be held in position parallel to the
 surface and centerline of the slab by a metal assembly of sufficient
 strength to prevent displacement during the paving operations.
 Special attention may be required when anchoring the dowel bar
 baskets to the open graded base course. Tie bars may be placed by
 mechanical equipment contingent upon satisfactory performance
 and the Engineer's approval.
 Dowel bars extending across transverse joints shall be of the type
 and size shown on the plans. Each smooth bar shall be field coated
 for a minimum distance of 2” (50 mm) greater than half the length
 of the bar with an approved grease as a bond breaker just prior to
 placement of concrete.
 Each bar across expansion joints shall be capped on the greased
 end with a close-fitting, non-compressible paper, plastic, or metal
 expansion sleeve of approved design, approximately 6″ (150 mm)
 long, which shall extend 1″ (25 mm) beyond the end of the bar and
 shall carry a stop of compressible material to provide space for
 subsequent movement of the bar.
 Tie bars extending across and through longitudinal joints shall be
 deformed bars of the type and size shown on the plans.
 Other types of ties and load transfer devices may be used when
 shown on the plans or approved in writing by the Engineer.
 343
 
 501
 (h) Placing Reinforcement. Reinforcing steel shall be clean and
 free from foreign material and scaling rust. Reinforcing mats shall
 be handled carefully and kept straight and free from bends and
 warps. They shall be placed parallel to the finished surface and to
 the depth shown on the plans.
 When the concrete is placed in one course, mechanical or
 vibratory equipment shall be used to place the mesh fabric
 reinforcement in position. The reinforcement shall be placed
 immediately behind the first strike-off and followed immediately by
 the finishing machine to erase all marks made by the insertion of the
 reinforcing fabric in the concrete. Use of equipment for the
 insertion of wire mesh will be contingent upon satisfactory
 performance and the Engineer's approval.
 When reinforced concrete pavement is placed in two layers, the
 entire width of the bottom layer shall be struck off and consolidated
 to such length and depth that the sheet of mesh fabric may be
 layered full length on the concrete in its final position without
 further manipulation. The reinforcement shall then be placed
 directly upon the concrete before initial set of the concrete has
 occurred. The top layer of the concrete shall then be placed, struck
 off, and screeded to the required thickness and crown. Sleds, chairs,
 or other devices supporting the mesh fabric reinforcing steel, with
 the consequent depositing of the concrete through the steel, will not
 be permitted.
 (i) Placing Concrete. Concrete shall not be placed on a soft,
 muddy, or frozen subgrade. The subgrade shall be moistened
 immediately before placing concrete unless a waterproof subgrade
 or base course material is specified. Moistening shall not be
 excessive to the point of forming mud or pools.
 No concrete shall be placed without the approval of the Engineer.
 The concrete shall be deposited on the subgrade in such manner
 as to require as little re-handling as possible. Spreading required
 shall be done by means of an approved mechanical spreader
 supplemented by hand shoveling as required. Spreading by rakes
 will not be allowed.
 (j) Joints.
 (1) General. The Contractor shall establish the location of all
 joints in concrete pavement. Longitudinal and transverse joints
 344
 
 501
 shall be located as shown on the plans in relation to the dowel or
 tie bars. Longitudinal and transverse joints shall be constructed
 to conform to the types, dimensions, and other details shown on
 the plans.
 Longitudinal joints include the longitudinal joint between
 lanes, lanes and shoulders, and longitudinal construction joints
 between placements in sequence or placements against existing
 pavement.
 Transverse joints include expansion joints,
 contraction joints, warping joints, and construction joints.
 All longitudinal and transverse joints shall be constructed,
 finished, filled, and sealed with joint material as shown on the
 plans. The joint grooves shall be thoroughly clean and dry when
 joint material is placed.
 Sawed joints shall be formed by cutting the groove in the
 hardened concrete with an approved concrete saw capable of
 cutting the joint to the specified dimensions and true to line
 within the allowable variation.
 Joints shall be sawed as soon as the concrete has hardened to
 the extent that tearing and raveling will not occur, but before
 development of any random cracking. Sufficient saws and saw
 blades to accomplish the work shall be available at all times.
 Should any procedure result in premature and uncontrolled
 cracking, the Contractor shall immediately revise the method
 and/or sequence of cutting the joints. Any curing media removed
 during sawing shall be immediately replaced.
 All joints shall be constructed so that the plane of the finished
 joint is perpendicular to the surface of the pavement and shall be
 uniform and not deviate more than 1/2" (12 mm) from the
 planned alignment within any 24' (7 m) segment. In addition, all
 transverse joints shall be perpendicular to the centerline of the
 pavement.
 The following methods shall apply for longitudinal,
 contraction, and warping joints when Type 3, 4, 5, or 6 joint
 sealer is used:
 Within 15 minutes after sawing for joint installation, the joints
 shall be flushed with water under sufficient pressure to remove
 all slurry and residue left by the sawing operation. After
 
 345
 
 501
 flushing, the joints shall be blown out with compressed air to
 remove excess water.
 Joints shall not be filled and sealed for a minimum of 6 days
 following placement of the concrete except that when High Early
 Strength Concrete Pavement is specified, the period may be
 reduced to 18 hours.
 When the joints are thoroughly dry, and just before sealer
 placement, both vertical faces shall be thoroughly cleaned by
 sandblasting with a nozzle attached to an aiming device that
 directs the sand blast at approximately a 45° angle and a
 maximum of 2" (50 mm) from the face of the joint. Each joint
 face shall be sandblasted individually. After sandblasting, the
 joints shall be blown out with compressed air that has been
 filtered and is completely free of oil and moisture. The joints
 shall be thoroughly dry before sealer is placed.
 All joints shall be filled and sealed the same day of the final
 sandblasting. Cleaned joints left open overnight shall be recleaned by sandblasting before filling and sealing.
 In the event freshly cleaned joints become contaminated
 before they are sealed, they shall be re-cleaned as specified
 above.
 Backer material shall be installed in a manner that will result
 in the planned depth and shape for the sealant. If primer is
 required, the primer shall be applied before installing the backer
 material.
 Joint sealer shall be applied by an approved mechanical device
 from inside the joint in a manner that causes it to wet the joint
 surfaces. Joint sealer application will not be permitted when the
 pavement surface temperature at the joint is less than the
 application temperature specified by the manufacturer.
 In Type 3 and 4 joint sealant, the surface shall be tooled, using
 the appropriate tool, to produce a slightly concave surface as
 shown on the plans. Tooling shall be accomplished before a skin
 forms on the surface. The use of soap or oil as a tooling aid will
 not be permitted. When an approved self-leveling joint sealant is
 used, the Engineer may waive the requirement for tooling.
 
 346
 
 501
 Failure of the joint material in either adhesion or cohesion will
 be cause for rejection. Removal, re-cleaning, and replacement of
 the failed material shall be at no cost to the Department.
 (2) Expansion Joints. Standard transverse expansion joints
 shall be placed at or near the ends of bridges, unless otherwise
 specified, and at other points designated on the plans. Special
 expansion joints shall be placed at all structures projecting
 through, into, or against the pavement such as drop inlets,
 junction boxes, etc. Unless otherwise specified, joints at such
 projecting structures shall be 1/2" (12 mm) in width and shall be
 filled with material complying with Subsection 501.02(h) Type 2.
 Transverse expansion joints shall extend for the full cross
 section of the pavement and shall be formed by a template or as
 shown on the plans. The template shall be securely staked or
 fastened in place before placing the concrete and in a manner to
 ensure the joint and dowel bars will remain in their proper
 position after finishing operations have been completed.
 (3) Contraction and Warping Joints. Contraction and
 warping joints shall be constructed according to the spacing and
 dimensions shown on the plans. The joints shall extend
 continuously across the full width of the concrete surface.
 (4) Construction Joints. Transverse construction joints shall
 be constructed when there is an interruption in the concreting
 operations of more than 30 minutes. Time may be adjusted, due
 to weather conditions, as directed by the Engineer. No transverse
 joint shall be constructed within 10' (3 m) of an expansion joint,
 contraction joint, or place of weakness. If sufficient concrete has
 not been mixed at the time of interruption to form a slab at least
 10' (3 m) long, the excess concrete back to the last preceding
 joint shall be removed. No payment will be made for the portion
 of the pavement which is discarded.
 The header may be made of wood or metal and shall have
 openings for the dowel bars. The header may be of one or two
 pieces and shall be rigid and accurately set to grade perpendicular
 to the centerline and surface of the pavement. In lieu of using a
 header, the Contractor may make the construction joint by cutting
 back the hardened concrete by sawing and installing dowel bars
 according to the provisions of Section 507.
 347
 
 501
 (5) Longitudinal Joints.
 Longitudinal joints shall be
 constructed along the center line of two lane pavements and
 approach slabs, between lanes of multiple lane pavements and
 approach slabs, between pavements (new or existing) and added
 concrete lanes or concrete shoulders, and between approach slabs
 and approach gutters.
 (k) Consolidating and Finishing.
 (1) Mechanical Methods. After the concrete has been
 deposited and spread it shall be consolidated by means of a
 mechanical vibrating machine of approved type and design. The
 vibrating machine may be mounted either on the mechanical
 spreader or operated as a separate unit on an individual carriage.
 Vibrators for full width vibration of concrete paving slabs shall
 be the internal type with either immersed tube or multiple spuds.
 They may be attached to the spreader or the finishing machine, or
 may be mounted on a separate carriage. They shall not come in
 contact with the joint, load transfer devices, subgrade, or side
 forms. The frequency of the internal type shall not be less than
 5,000 impulses per minute for tube vibrators and not less than
 7,000 impulses per minute for spud vibrators.
 An electronic vibrator-monitoring device that displays the
 operating frequency of each individual internal vibrator shall be
 required. The monitoring device shall have a readout display
 near the operator’s controls visible to the paver operator and the
 Department Inspector. It shall operate continuously while
 paving, and shall display all vibrator frequencies with manual or
 automatic sequencing among all individual vibrators. The
 monitoring system shall also record, at minimum, the clock time,
 station location, paver track speed, and operating frequency of
 individual vibrators. Recordings shall be made after each 25 feet
 (7.5 m) of paving or after 5 minutes of time. A record of the data
 shall be provided to the Engineer daily for the first 3 days of
 paving and weekly thereafter. The Engineer may determine that
 more frequent submission is necessary, particularly if equipment
 malfunctions occur.
 If the electronic monitoring device fails to operate properly,
 the vibrators shall immediately be checked manually. If the
 vibrators are functioning properly, paving may continue but the
 Contractor shall make all efforts to correct the malfunction in a
 reasonable amount of time. If the recording device fails to
 348
 
 501
 operate, paving may continue but the Contractor shall monitor the
 vibrators continuously and correct the malfunction within 3
 paving days.
 When spud type internal vibrators, either hand operated or
 attached to spreaders or finishing machines, are used adjacent to
 forms, they shall have a frequency of not less than 3,500
 impulses per minute.
 If, for any reason, equipment previously approved becomes
 unsatisfactory, it shall be replaced before proceeding with the
 work.
 Vibration shall extend over the entire pavement area and the
 vibrating machine shall satisfactorily consolidate the mixes
 required for this type of construction and shall not displace the
 reinforcement, side forms, joints, or dowel bar assemblies. The
 concrete shall be deposited, spread, and vibrated in a manner that
 will ensure minimum segregation and develop a maximum
 density and strength in the finished pavement.
 After vibratory consolidation, the concrete shall be struck off
 by means of an approved power driven, mechanical finishing
 machine equipped with double screeds adjusted to strike-off to
 the required crowned section on tangents and to the plane section
 on curves as shown on the typical cross section. The finishing
 machine shall be operated with a roll of concrete in front of each
 screed sufficient to fill depressions and leave the top of the slab
 smooth and even with the desired crown and at the proper
 elevation.
 (2) Hand Methods. At intersections and turnouts, and on
 additional widths or other irregular sections not readily accessible
 to conventional equipment, the concrete may be spread and
 struck off by hand methods as approved by the Engineer. Over
 all such areas, however, consolidation shall be accomplished
 through use of a suitable and approved mechanical vibrator unit.
 When striking-off and consolidating by hand methods is
 permitted, the work shall be done in the following manner:
 After the concrete has been deposited, it shall be leveled and
 then struck-off to such depth above the finished grade specified
 that when properly consolidated the surface shall conform to the
 line and grade desired. Before striking-off, the concrete shall be
 349
 
 501
 thoroughly consolidated by means of a mechanical vibrator unit.
 The strike-board shall be moved forward with a combined
 longitudinal and transverse motion, so manipulated that neither
 end is raised from the side forms during the striking-off process.
 A slight excess of material must be kept in front of the cutting
 edge at all times. Additional concrete shall be added to low
 places and porous spots and the striking and consolidating
 continued until the entire pavement has a uniform, even surface.
 Strike-boards used must be straight, free from warp, shod on
 the striking surface with a strip of steel, shaped to the required
 crown, and have sufficient weight and rigidity to accomplish the
 purpose desired.
 (3) Floating. After the concrete has been struck off and
 consolidated, it shall be further smoothed and consolidated by
 any approved method of mechanical floating, either longitudinal
 or transverse, which will satisfactorily finish the pavement to the
 required cross-section, elevation, and surface smoothness. The
 use of mechanical floating equipment will be contingent upon
 satisfactory results.
 Excess water, laitance, or foreign materials brought to the
 surface during the floating operations shall not be reworked into
 the pavement but shall be removed immediately upon appearance
 by means of a squeegee or straightedge drawn from the center of
 the pavement toward either edge.
 In general, the addition of water to the surface of the concrete
 to assist in finishing operations will not be permitted. If the
 application of water to the surface is permitted, it shall be applied
 as a fog spray by means of approved spray equipment.
 (4) Straightedging. After the longitudinal floating has been
 completed and the excess water removed, but while the concrete
 is still plastic, the slab surface shall be checked by the Contractor
 in both directions for trueness, using a straightedge. For this
 purpose an accurate 10' (3 m) metal straightedge shall be used,
 swung from a handle longer than one-half the width of the slab.
 Additional floating may be necessary to eliminate all
 irregularities. The straightedge shall be held in successive
 positions parallel to the pavement centerline in contact with the
 surface and the surface checked for the full width of the slab.
 350
 
 501
 Progression along the pavement shall be in successive stages
 of not more than one-half the length of the straightedge.
 Depressions found shall be immediately filled with freshly mixed
 concrete, struck-off, floated, and refinished. High areas shall be
 cut down and refinished. Straightedge testing and surface
 correction shall continue until the entire surface conforms to the
 required grade and section.
 (5) Final Finish. Following the straightedging and after all
 excess moisture has disappeared, the surface of the concrete
 pavement shall be given a final finish with a drag followed by
 grooving. The drag shall consist of a seamless strip of damp
 burlap, cotton fabric, or artificial turf that will produce a uniform
 surface of gritty texture after dragging longitudinally along the
 full width of pavement. For pavement 16′ (5 m) or more in
 width, the drag shall be mounted on a bridge and moved along
 the surface by mechanical means. The dimensions of the drag
 shall be such that a strip at least 2′ (0.6 m) wide is in contact with
 the full width of pavement surface while the drag is used. A
 burlap or fabric drag shall consist of not less than 2 layers with
 the bottom layer approximately 6" (150 mm) wider than the
 upper layer. The drag shall be maintained in such condition that
 the resultant surface is of uniform appearance and reasonably free
 from grooves over 1/16" (1.5 mm) in depth. Drags shall be
 maintained clean and free from encrusted mortar. Drags that
 cannot be cleaned shall be discarded and new drags furnished.
 The final finish shall be produced by using the drag finish as
 described above along with the further application of a metal tine
 finishing device. The tines shall be approximately 0.032" by
 0.125" (0.8 mm by 3 mm) steel flat wire, 2" to 5" in length
 (50 mm to 125 mm) and spaced on 1/2" to 3/4" (13 mm to
 19 mm) centers. The grooves produced in the concrete shall be
 substantially from 1/8" to 3/16" (3 mm to 5 mm) in depth. The
 grooves shall be transverse to the centerline of the pavement. On
 main lanes the metal tine device shall be operated by an approved
 mechanical means. Manual methods may be used on ramps,
 connections, and miscellaneous sections when approved by the
 Engineer.
 As an alternate to the use of a burlap drag and a metal tine
 finishing device, a finned float may be used according to the
 following requirements:
 351
 
 501
 After a tight uniform surface meeting the straightedge
 requirements of Subsection 501.05(k)(4) has been achieved, the
 surface shall be given a texture by transverse grooving with a
 finned float. The finned area of the float shall be at least 4" by
 36" (100 mm by 900 mm). The fins shall extend the full length
 of the float and cover at least half the width. The grooving shall
 be approximately 3/16" (5 mm) in width at 3/4" (20 mm centers)
 and substantially between 1/8" to 3/16" (3 mm and 5 mm) in
 depth. This operation shall be performed at such time and in
 such manner that the desired texture will be achieved while
 minimizing displacement of the larger aggregate particles.
 Other texturing equipment or methods may be approved by the
 Engineer provided it produces a texture equivalent to that
 produced by the metal tine or float.
 (6) Finishing Joints and Edging.
 Longitudinal and
 transverse joints, where required, shall be so constructed as to
 allow the normal finishing operations to be executed and
 completed over the joint. After the final finish, but before the
 concrete has taken its initial set, the edges of the pavement along
 each side of each slab, and on each side of transverse expansion
 joints and formed joints, shall be worked with an approved tool
 and rounded to a 1/4" (6 mm) radius. A well-defined and
 continuous radius shall be produced and a smooth, dense mortar
 finish obtained. The surface of the slab shall not be unduly
 disturbed by tilting the tool during use.
 At joints, tool marks appearing on the slab adjacent to the
 joints shall be eliminated by brooming the surface. In doing this,
 the rounding of the corner of the slab shall not be disturbed.
 Concrete on top of the joint filler shall be completely removed.
 Joints shall be tested with a straightedge before the concrete
 has set. Corrections shall be made if one side of the joint is
 higher or lower than the other.
 (l) Curing. Immediately after finishing operations have been
 completed and as soon as marring of the concrete will not occur, the
 entire surface of the newly placed concrete shall be covered and
 cured according to one of the following methods:
 (1) Polyethylene-Burlap Mats. The mats used shall be of
 such length or width that as placed they will extend at least twice
 the thickness of the pavement beyond the edges of the slab. The
 352
 
 501
 mat shall be placed so that the entire surface and both edges of
 the slab are completely covered. Before being placed, the mats
 shall be saturated thoroughly with water. The mats shall be so
 placed and weighted down as to cause them to remain in intimate
 contact with the surface covered, and the covering shall be
 maintained fully wetted and in position for 5 days after the
 concrete has been placed unless otherwise specified.
 (2) Polyethylene Sheeting or Copolymer/Synthetic Blanket.
 When this type of curing is used, the sheeting shall be so placed
 and weighted down as to cause it to remain in intimate contact
 with the surface covered. The sheeting as prepared for use shall
 have such width that each unit as placed will extend beyond the
 edges of the slab at least twice the thickness of the pavement.
 Unless otherwise specified, the covering shall be maintained in
 place for 5 days after the concrete has been placed.
 (3) Membrane Curing. The entire surface of the pavement
 shall be sprayed uniformly with curing compound (ASTM C309
 Type 1-D or Type 2) immediately after the finishing of the
 surface and before the set of the concrete has taken place, or, if
 the pavement is cured initially with an alternate method, it may
 be applied upon removal of the covering. The curing compound
 shall not be applied during rainfall.
 Curing compound shall be applied using pressure sprayers at
 the minimum rate of 1 gallon per 125 square feet (1 L/3 sq m).
 The spraying equipment shall be of the fully atomizing type
 equipped with a tank agitator. At the time of use, the compound
 shall be in a thoroughly mixed condition with the pigment or dye
 uniformly dispersed throughout the vehicle. During application,
 the compound shall be stirred continuously by effective
 mechanical means. Hand spraying of odd widths or shapes and
 concrete surfaces exposed by the removal of forms will be
 permitted. Curing compound shall not be applied to the inside
 faces of joints to be sealed.
 The curing compound shall be of such character that the film
 will harden within 30 minutes after application. Should the film
 become damaged from any cause during the required curing
 period, the damaged portions shall be repaired immediately with
 additional compound.
 
 353
 
 501
 Upon removal of side forms, when used, the sides of the slabs
 exposed shall be protected immediately to provide a curing
 treatment equal to that provided for the surface.
 (m) Surface Evenness and Testing. The finished pavement
 surface shall have a maximum profile index of 5” per mile
 (75 mm/km) (±0.1″ [2.5 mm] blanking band) for each 0.1 mile
 (200 m) section, or portion thereof, for mainlane pavement and 10”
 per mile (150 mm/km) for each 0.1 mile (200 m) section, or portion
 thereof, for ramps and acceleration/deceleration lanes.
 The cross slope of the pavement shall vary no more than 1/8"
 (3 mm) in 10' (3 m) when tested with a straightedge.
 The Contractor shall furnish a California-style profilograph
 complying with ASTM E 1274 or an automated lightweight
 profilometer complying with ASTM E 950, Class I and calibrated to
 the California-style profilograph scale.
 The Contractor will take all profiles required by this subsection,
 under the observation of the Engineer. All data obtained from the
 profiling operations will be furnished to the Engineer at the end of
 each day's operations. The Engineer will verify the calibration of
 the profilograph equipment as frequently as necessary to assure
 proper operation.
 The Engineer will verify the profiles by testing approximately
 10% of the pavement. This testing will be performed by the
 Engineer, using either the profilograph furnished by the Contractor
 or one provided by the Department, at the option of the Engineer.
 A profile will be taken near the center of each traffic lane or ramp
 using the profilograph equipment. The profiles shall begin 25′
 (7.5 m) from an existing structure or from the end of the pavement
 or 25' (7.5 m) back onto the previous day’s run. The finished
 surface of the 25' (7.5 m) sections adjacent to an existing structure or
 the end of pavement shall not show surface deviations in excess of
 1/8" (3 mm) in 10' (3 m) when tested with a 10' (3 m) straight edge.
 For the first day's run, profiles will be taken utilizing the
 profilograph equipment as soon as the hardness of the concrete is
 sufficient for proper testing. Smoothness profiles of the first day’s
 run will be analyzed before the second day’s run commences.
 Should the day's run not meet the profile index of 5" per
 mile(75 mm/km) or less (10" per mile [150 mm/km] for ramps and
 354
 
 501
 acceleration/deceleration lanes), the paving operations shall be
 discontinued until better methods and equipment are obtained or
 until the present equipment is properly adjusted. If adjustments are
 necessary from the first day’s run, the second day's run will be
 profiled to determine the ability of the equipment to finish the
 pavement within the specified tolerance. If the second day's
 operation fails to produce a finished surface having a profile index
 of 5" per mile (75 mm/km) or less (10" per mile [150 mm/km] for
 ramps and acceleration/deceleration lanes), the Contractor shall
 produce new methods and/or equipment that will obtain the
 specified results. The new methods and/or equipment will be given
 trial runs as indicated above for the original equipment.
 For the duration of the work every reasonable effort shall be
 made to test smoothness within 5 working days after each day's run.
 Scheduling and testing shall be coordinated with the Engineer. The
 Contractor shall be responsible for traffic control associated with the
 testing operation.
 All objects and foreign material on the pavement surface,
 including protective covers, shall be removed by the Contractor
 before testing. If appropriate, protective covers shall be properly
 replaced by the Contractor after testing.
 Grinding shall be performed, if necessary, to reduce the profile
 index as determined by the profilograph to 5" per mile (75 mm/km)
 or 10" per mile (150 mm/km), as appropriate, in any 0.1 mile
 (200 m) section on all profiles, including the trial run. The grinding
 equipment shall be power driven and specifically designed to
 smooth and texture portland cement concrete by means of diamond
 blades. Areas that have been ground shall be re-grooved by
 grooving according to Subsection 802.19 for Class 7 surface finish,
 to provide a uniform texture equal in roughness to the surrounding
 unground pavement. However, if the ground area is less than 50′
 (15 m) in length and full width of the pavement lane, re-grooving
 will not be required.
 Continual production of a final surface not qualifying for full
 payment will not be allowed.
 In addition to the above requirements for profile indices, areas
 representing high points having deviations in excess of 0.3"
 (7.5 mm) in 25′ (7.5 m) as determined by the profilograph
 equipment or 1/8" (3 mm) in 10′ (3 m) as determined by the
 355
 
 501
 straightedge, shall be reduced by grinding until such deviations as
 indicated by retest do not exceed the above limits.
 Areas showing low spots of more than 1/4" (6 mm) in 10' (3 m)
 in the longitudinal direction shall be corrected by grinding or shall
 be removed and replaced according to Section 507 to an elevation
 that will not show surface deviations in excess of 1/8" (3 mm) in 10'
 (3 m).
 (n) Shoulder Construction. In the construction of the shoulders,
 the base course material shall be placed directly on the shoulder area
 between the pavement edge and the outer shouldering limits
 indicated on the typical section. Material shall not be deposited on
 the surface of the pavement during placing. Care shall be exercised
 by the Contractor in manipulating and shaping of the material on the
 shoulders to assure a minimum amount of littering with base
 material on the pavement surface. Any littering of the surface of the
 pavement with base material shall be corrected by brooming.
 (o) Opening Pavement to Traffic. The Contractor shall prevent
 all traffic, including construction traffic, from using newly
 constructed pavement until the concrete is found, by suitable tests of
 representative cylinders prepared at regular intervals and subjected
 to the same curing conditions as the pavement, to have a
 compressive strength of not less than 3000 psi (21.0 MPa). The
 pavement shall not be opened to traffic in less than 7 days, except
 that the minimum time for opening the pavement to traffic shall be
 reduced from 7 days to 24 hours when High Early Strength
 Pavement is specified and the requirements of Subsection 501.08 are
 met. Before opening the pavement to the public, all joints shall be
 cleaned and sealed, and the surface of the pavement cleaned of
 foreign substances.
 501.06 Slip Form Paver. When a slip form paver is used, the
 following requirements shall apply:
 (a) Conditioning of Subgrade or Foundation Course. After
 the subgrade or base has been placed and compacted to the required
 density, the area that will support the slip form paving machine and
 the area on which pavement is to be constructed shall be brought to
 the proper profile and cross section by means of a properly designed
 electronic or automatic screed control system for the control of
 grade and slope and recompacted to the prescribed density. The
 subgrade and the top of each successive type of base course material
 356
 
 501
 shall be graded to a stringline tolerance of 0" (0 mm) high and 1/2"
 (12 mm) low when compared to the computed grade for the
 subgrade or individual type of base course. Unless otherwise
 provided for in the plans or special provisions, no hauling will be
 allowed on the finished subgrade or base course except for dumping
 the concrete. Suitable temporary construction crossovers may be
 constructed when approved by the Engineer. The subgrade shall be
 prepared for a distance of not less than 500' (150 m) in advance of
 the paver or the entire remaining distance when within 500' (150 m)
 of the end of the paving or bridge end. The subgrade or base course
 shall be checked and corrected immediately ahead of the placing of
 the concrete.
 (b) Placing and Finishing. The slip form paver shall be
 designed to spread, consolidate, screed, and finish the freshly placed
 concrete in one complete pass of the machine in such manner that a
 minimum of hand finishing will be necessary to provide a dense and
 homogeneous pavement conforming to the plans and specifications.
 The paver shall be self-propelled.
 Final approval of spreading and finishing equipment will be
 based upon satisfactory performance during actual construction. If,
 for any reason, equipment previously approved becomes
 unsatisfactory, it shall be replaced or repaired before proceeding
 with the work.
 The machine shall vibrate the concrete for the full width and
 depth of pavement being placed.
 This vibration shall be
 accomplished by means of satisfactory internal vibration in each
 course of concrete placed. The sliding forms shall be rigidly held
 together laterally to prevent spreading of the forms. Hand finishing
 shall be kept to a minimum. If the machine is of the trailing form
 type and hand finishing is required, it must be done within the length
 of the trailing forms.
 (c) Uniform Consistency and Progress. The concrete shall
 have a uniform consistency. The slip form paver shall be operated
 with a continuous forward movement and all operations of mixing,
 delivery, and spreading concrete shall be so coordinated as to
 provide a uniform progress with stopping and starting of the paver
 held to a minimum. If, for any reason, it is necessary to stop the
 forward movement of the paver, the vibratory and tamping elements
 shall also be stopped immediately. No tractive force shall be
 357
 
 501
 applied to the machine except that which is controlled from the
 machine.
 (d) Surface Test. The surface tolerance of the finished pavement
 shall meet the requirements of Subsection 501.05(m). Any slump of
 the pavement edge in excess of 1/4" (6 mm) shall be corrected
 before the concrete has hardened.
 501.07 Stationary Side Forms. (a) General. Side forms shall
 have a height and base width not less than the edge thickness of the
 pavement. Each section of forms shall be reasonably straight and
 free from warp. The method of connecting form sections shall be
 such that a joint is formed free from play or movement in any
 direction. The face of the forms shall be set normal to the crosssection slope of the pavement surface. When set to line and grade,
 the forms shall have a tolerance of 1/4" (6 mm) for alignment and
 1/8" (3 mm) for grade, and shall be of such strength and so secured
 as to resist, without springing or settlement, the pressure of the
 concrete when placed and the impact and vibration of the finishing
 machine. The minimum length of sections of forms used on
 tangents shall be 10' (3 m).
 Forms shall be cleaned before being set to line and grade and
 shall be oiled before placing concrete. Oiling shall be performed in
 such manner as to prevent contamination of reinforcing steel and
 dowels.
 After the forms have been set to correct grade, the subgrade
 under and about them shall be thoroughly tamped by means of a
 mechanical form tamper so constructed that each side of the form
 will be tamped simultaneously. Hand tampers or other means shall
 be used to supplement the mechanical tamper as necessary to obtain
 an unyielding support for the forms. On treated bases, the forms
 may be supported by approved shimming methods.
 The alignment and grade of forms shall be checked and must be
 approved immediately before placing the concrete. Forms that show
 a variation in excess of the surface tolerance requirements specified
 shall be removed and replaced or otherwise corrected.
 (b) Removing Forms. Unless otherwise provided, forms shall
 not be removed from freshly placed concrete until it has set for at
 least 12 hours, except auxiliary forms used temporarily in widened
 areas. Forms shall be removed carefully to avoid damage to the
 pavement. Immediately after the forms have been removed, the side
 358
 
 501
 of the slab shall be cured by one of the approved methods.
 Honeycombed areas will be considered as defective work and shall
 be repaired or replaced, as directed.
 501.08 High Early Strength Concrete Pavement. When High
 Early Strength Concrete Pavement is specified and used, it shall be
 made with the use of high early strength portland cement complying
 with AASHTO M 85, Type III cement, in lieu of AASHTO M 85,
 Type I cement. Upon written permission of the Engineer, the
 Contractor may substitute standard portland cement with a cement
 factor of 25% in excess of that specified for Portland Cement
 Concrete Pavement for the high early strength cement in the High
 Early Strength Concrete Pavement. No additional compensation
 will be allowed above the price bid for High Early Strength
 Concrete Pavement for the 25% additional cement if standard
 portland cement is used. All other requirements specified for
 Portland Cement Concrete Pavement shall be applicable to High
 Early Strength Concrete Pavement.
 501.09 Repair of Defective Pavement Slabs. Broken slabs,
 random cracks, nonworking contraction joints, major honey-combed
 areas, and spalls shall be replaced or repaired according to
 Sections 507 and/or 509, as appropriate, at no cost to the
 Department.
 501.10 Tolerance in Pavement Thickness. The pavement shall
 be constructed according to the thickness required by the typical
 cross section shown on the plans.
 Cores will be drilled according to the procedures in Subsection
 501.04.
 Where not constructed according to the planned thickness, the
 following procedure for adjustment of payment will govern:
 When any core is more than 1/2" (12 mm) less than the specified
 thickness, additional cores will be taken to determine the extent of
 the thickness deficiency. 2" (50 mm) diameter cores may be drilled
 for thickness deficiency determination. Cores will be drilled on
 cross sections of the same slab of the pavement, measured parallel to
 the centerline, 10' (3 m) back and 10' (3 m) ahead of the station of
 the original core. If both of these cores are within 1/2" (12 mm) of
 the specified thickness, no further special corings for this individual
 zone of deficiency need be made. If either or both of these cores are
 not within 1/2" (12 mm) of the specified thickness, additional cores
 359
 
 501
 will be taken on cross-sections of the slab in question, 25', 50', 100',
 and 200' (7.5, 15, 30, and 60 m) ahead and back of the original core,
 and thereafter at 200' (60 m) intervals until a thickness within the
 1/2" (12 mm) tolerance is found in each direction. The Contractor
 shall drill and fill core holes at no cost to the Department.
 No payment will be made for any section of pavement that is
 more than 1/2" (12 mm) deficient in thickness. The length of such
 section will be the sum of the distances measured in both directions,
 parallel to the centerline, from the deficient core to the nearest core
 that shows a thickness not more than 1/2" (12 mm) deficient. In all
 cases deductions will be made for the full width of the slab of which
 the cores are represented (normally 2 traffic lanes placed
 simultaneously).
 When a deficiency in thickness of any portion of pavement slab
 in excess of 1/2" (12 mm) may seriously impair traffic service of the
 pavement, the Contractor will be required to remove such deficient
 slab and to replace it with a slab of satisfactory quality and thickness
 that, when accepted, will be included in the measurement for
 payment. The Contractor shall receive no compensation for any cost
 incurred in the original placement and subsequent removal of the
 deficient slab.
 In removing pavement that is deficient in thickness, the pavement
 shall be removed from the edge to a longitudinal joint, or between
 longitudinal joints, and on each side of any deficient area until no
 portion of the exposed section is more than 1/2" (12 mm) deficient,
 except that in no instance shall there be less than 10 linear feet (3 m)
 of pavement removed. If in meeting the above requirement, there
 remains less than 10' (3 m) of acceptable pavement between the
 section that has been removed and a transverse plane of weakness,
 then the Contractor shall remove the pavement to the plane of
 weakness at no cost to the Department. The Contractor shall then
 replace all the pavement that has been removed with satisfactory,
 acceptable pavement according to Section 507 and the details of the
 Department's applicable Standard Drawings for PCCP Patching. If
 the plane of weakness is a contraction, expansion, or construction
 joint, the joint shall be replaced with a joint of the same design as
 the one removed. If the plane of weakness is a warping joint, the
 new joint shall be formed to comply with Subsection 501.05(j)(3).
 The thickness of the pavement of each lot will be computed from
 the average of the thickness of the core(s) taken from that lot, and
 360
 
 501
 the thickness of the pavement of the entire project will be computed
 from the average of the thickness determined for each lot, except
 that lots or sublots found more than 1/2" (12 mm) deficient in
 thickness will not be considered in such computation.
 Should the thickness of the pavement as constructed, in any lot,
 exceed the thickness shown on the plans, the actual thickness as
 constructed, not to exceed 1/4" (6 mm) in excess of the thickness
 shown on the plans, will be used in computing the thickness of the
 pavement for that lot. No additional payment over the contract unit
 price will be made for any pavement in excess of the thickness
 specified.
 Payment for pavement deficient in thickness, not in excess of
 1/2" (12 mm), will be made by item deduction. Price reductions will
 be accomplished by Change Order and will be shown on progress
 and final estimates as a separate item deduction.
 The total price reduction for the isolated area shall be calculated
 by the following formula:
 %	ܲ‫ ݊݋݅ݐܿݑܴ݀݁	݁ܿ݅ݎ‬ൌ ቆ1 െ
 
 ܽ‫݃ݒ‬. ‫ ݏݏ݄݁݊݇ܿ݅ݐ‬ଶ

 501.11 Constructing Pavement in Half Widths. When the
 pavement is placed in half widths, a longitudinal center joint with tie
 bars, as provided for by the plans and specifications, shall be used.
 Where the pavement is being constructed in half widths, the
 Contractor shall maintain a safe passageway according to the
 provisions of Section 603.
 501.12 Incentives/Price Adjustments for Ride Smoothness. It
 is the intent of this specification to produce a pavement that is
 durable and consistently exceeds the minimum test values in these
 specifications. Incentive payments will be accomplished by change
 order and will be shown on the final estimate as a separate item
 increase. Incentives will be calculated according to the following
 guidelines.
 Price adjustments apply to the total area for the standard 12’
 (3.7 m) lane width represented by the profile index for a continuous
 mainlane section at least 0.1 mile (200 m) long. Price adjustments
 for incentives are only based on the initial measured profile index of
 continuous sections of at least 0.1 mile (200 m) in length, excluding
 361
 
 501
 approach slabs and bridges, and before any corrective work;
 however, grinding will be allowed to achieve full payment. Ramps,
 acceleration/deceleration lanes, shoulders, islands, tapers, or other
 incidentals shall not be considered for price adjustments. If grinding
 is required due to failure to meet the required profile index, the
 pavement will be ground to a level which qualifies for 100%
 payment.
 Price adjustments shall be made as follows:

 SECTION 503
 CONTINUOUSLY REINFORCED CONCRETE
 PAVEMENT
 503.01 Description. This item shall consist of a continuously
 reinforced concrete pavement, constructed on a prepared subgrade
 or on a completed and accepted base course according to these
 specifications, and conforming to the lines, grades, thickness, and
 typical cross section shown on the plans or established by the
 Engineer.
 503.02 Proportions.
 according to Section 501.
 
 The concrete shall be proportioned
 
 503.03 Materials. Materials used under this item of work shall
 comply with the applicable requirements of Sections 501 and 502.
 503.04 Construction Requirements. Except as modified below,
 the construction of continuously reinforced concrete pavement shall
 be performed according to the requirements of Sections 501 and
 502. In the event a portland cement stabilized base material is used
 under the pavement, the specified bond breaker shall be in place and
 undamaged when pavement is placed. If the base, curing agent, or
 bond breaker has been damaged in any manner, repairs shall be
 made before pavement is placed.
 (a) Placement of Reinforcement.
 Reinforcement may be
 installed by one of the following methods: 1) Preset on chairs, or
 2) Placed by mechanical means.
 Regardless of the method of placement used, the horizontal
 spacing tolerances shall be ±1/2" (±12 mm) for longitudinal steel
 and ±2" (±50 mm) for transverse steel. The spacing and vertical
 position of the longitudinal and transverse steel shall be as shown on
 the plans.
 At the time concrete is placed, the reinforcement shall be free
 from loose, flaky rust, mud, oil, or other coatings that will materially
 reduce the bond and shall be handled with such care that the bars or
 mesh fabric sheets will remain reasonably flat and free from
 distortion. Loose bars shall be free from such kinks or bends as may
 prevent them from being properly assembled or installed.
 (1) Reinforcement Preset on Chairs. The reinforcement
 shall be supported on chairs approved by the Engineer.
 365
 
 503
 The arrangement and spacing of chairs shall be such that the
 reinforcement will be supported in proper position without
 permanent deflection or displacement during placing and
 consolidation of concrete. The tolerances specified herein shall
 not be exceeded. Chairs shall have sufficient bearing at the base
 to prevent overturning and penetration into the subbase, and shall
 be designed so as not to impede the placing and consolidation of
 concrete. Welding of chairs to transverse bars will be permitted.
 If the support system does not maintain the reinforcement in
 the position required by these specifications during the placing
 and finishing of the concrete, the Contractor will be required to
 increase the number of chairs or take such other steps as
 necessary to assure proper position of the steel.
 When the reinforcement consists of individual bars, the
 longitudinal bars shall be secured to the transverse bars by wire
 ties or clips at alternate intersections or more frequently if
 necessary to maintain their position within the horizontal and
 vertical tolerances specified herein.
 (2) Reinforcement Placed by Mechanical Means. The
 reinforcement shall be incorporated into the concrete at its proper
 position by methods and/or equipment approved by the Engineer.
 When individual deformed bars are used, tying the intersection
 between longitudinal and transverse bars may be omitted if it can
 be demonstrated conclusively to the Engineer that the equipment
 and method used will assure proper placement of the
 reinforcement. The method of placement used shall maintain the
 splice pattern shown on the plans.
 Embedment of the reinforcing steel shall be performed in such
 a manner that the concrete, after final finishing, shall show no
 segregation attributable to the placing operation.
 (b) Splices in Reinforcing Steel. Reinforcing bars, bar mats, or
 welded wire fabric used as continuous reinforcement shall be lapped
 in the longitudinal direction in a staggered pattern as shown on the
 plans. All laps shall be securely tied or clipped. In lieu of lapped
 splices, the Contractor may use welded or mechanical splices
 according to Section 804.07.
 (c) Placement of Concrete. The concrete shall be placed in a
 single course to the full depth.
 366
 
 503
 (d) Transverse Construction Joints. At the end of each day's
 run, or at any time that the paving operation is delayed for more than
 30 minutes, a transverse construction joint shall be formed as shown
 on the plans. The time may be adjusted, due to weather conditions,
 as directed by the Engineer. The joint shall be formed by placing
 the concrete against a header approved by the Engineer. The
 longitudinal reinforcing steel shall extend through the header for a
 sufficient length to provide a proper lap and be supported from the
 subgrade beyond the header to prevent undue deflections during
 paving operations. Hand vibrators shall be used to supplement
 mechanical vibrators at all construction joints.
 (e) Transverse Expansion Joints. Expansion joints shall be
 provided where specified and according to the details shown on the
 plans.
 (f) Longitudinal Joints. Longitudinal joints shall be constructed
 as specified in Subsection 501.05(j).
 (g) Temporary Pavement Crossings. Where necessary to allow
 the passage of traffic across continuously reinforced concrete
 pavement at sites shown on the plans, or as directed, the Contractor
 shall construct and maintain suitable and substantial crossings to
 bridge the pavement. Such crossings shall be adequate for two-way
 traffic and satisfactory to the Engineer.
 Pavement damaged before it is accepted shall be repaired or
 replaced at no cost to the Department.
 Gaps in the pavement for temporary crossings will not be
 permitted.
 503.05 Method of Measurement. (a) Continuously Reinforced
 Concrete Pavement and High Early Strength Continuously
 Reinforced Concrete Pavement will be measured by the square yard
 (square meter). The width for measurement will be the width as
 constructed according to the plans and typical cross sections.
 (b) Reinforcing steel will be measured and paid for under
 Section 502.
 (c) Temporary pavement crossings will not be measured for
 payment.
 503.06 Basis of Payment. (a) Work completed and accepted and
 measured as provided above will be paid for at the contract unit
 price bid per square yard (square meter) for Continuously
 367
 
 503
 Reinforced Concrete Pavement or for High Early Strength
 Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement, as the case may be, of
 the thickness and type specified, which price shall constitute full
 compensation for furnishing and preparation of materials including
 transverse and longitudinal joints, joint filler, and dowels or load
 transfer devices as required on the plans; for placing, finishing, and
 curing; for performing mix designs and quality control and
 acceptance sampling and testing; for furnishing the profilograph;
 taking all required profiles, performing all necessary computations;
 and for all labor, equipment, tools, and incidentals necessary to
 complete the work. For such area as is deficient in thickness, only

 GRINDING PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
 PAVEMENT
 510.01 Description. This item shall consist of grinding portland
 cement concrete pavement to substantially eliminate vertical
 differentials and to restore drainage, riding characteristics, and skid
 resistance to the pavement surface.
 510.02 Equipment. The grinding equipment shall be a power
 driven, self-propelled machine that is specifically designed to
 smooth and texture portland cement concrete pavement.
 The equipment shall be capable of grinding the surface without
 causing spalls at cracks, joints, or at other locations.
 510.03 Construction Requirements. The pavement will be
 initially profiled by the Contractor using an automated lightweight
 profilometer complying with ASTM E 950, Class 1 and calibrated to
 the California-style profilograph scale. The initial profilograph will
 be used to locate high and low areas for correction.
 Areas representing high points having deviations in excess of
 0.3″ (7.5 mm) in 25′ (7.5 m) as determined by the profilograph or
 1/8″ (3 mm) in 10′ (3 m) as determined by the straightedge, shall be
 379
 
 510
 reduced by grinding until such deviations as indicated by retest do
 not exceed the above limits.
 Areas showing low spots of more than ¼″ (6 mm) in 10′ (3 m) in
 the longitudinal direction shall be corrected by grinding the adjacent
 higher pavement to an elevation that will not show surface
 deviations in excess of 1/8″ (3 mm) in 10′ (3 m).
 The construction operation shall produce a uniform finished
 surface without damaging the existing pavement that is to remain.
 Grinding shall be accomplished in a manner that eliminates joint or
 crack faults while providing positive lateral drainage by maintaining
 a constant cross-slope. Grinding shall transition as required to
 provide positive drainage and an acceptable riding surface. The
 pavement shall be ground in a direction opposite to normal traffic
 flow.
 The entire area designated on the plans shall be ground until the
 pavement surfaces of adjacent sides of transverse joints and cracks
 are in the same plane. It is intended that the faulting at joints and
 cracks be eliminated and that substantially all of the pavement
 surface shown on the plans be textured. Extra depth grinding to
 eliminate minor depressions in order to provide texturing for 100%
 of the pavement surface will not be required.
 The Contractor shall establish positive means for removal of
 grinding residue. Solid residue including joint material shall be
 immediately removed from the pavement surface. Residue shall not
 be permitted to flow across lanes used by traffic. Drainage facilities
 shall be kept free of accumulated residue.
 510.04 Final Surface Finish. The grinding process shall
 produce a pavement surface that is true to grade and uniform in
 appearance with a longitudinal line type texture. The line type
 texture shall contain parallel longitudinal corrugations that present a
 narrow ridge corduroy type appearance. The peaks of the ridges
 shall be approximately 1/32" (0.8 mm) higher than the bottoms of
 the grooves with approximately 53 to 57 evenly spaced grooves per
 foot (170 to 190 evenly spaced grooves per meter).
 The finished pavement surface will be measured for roughness by
 the Contractor. Roughness will be measured using an automated
 lightweight profilometer complying with ASTM E 950, Class 1 and
 calibrated to the International Roughness Indicator (IRI) scale. The
 IRI shall not exceed 100 inches per mile per 0.5 mile section (1.60m
 per km per 0.8 km section). Bridges or any other non-ground
 sections will not be included in the calculation of the IRI.
 380
 
 511
 The Engineer will verify the roughness indices by testing
 approximately 10% of the pavement. This testing will be performed
 by the Engineer, using either the lightweight profilometer furnished
 by the Contractor or one provided by the Department, at the option
 of the Engineer.
 Vertical misalignment of the planes of the surfaces on adjacent
 sides of the joints or cracks that is in excess of 1/16" (2 mm) shall be
 ground until the surfaces are flush.
 The transverse slope of the pavement shall be uniform to a degree
 that no depressions or misalignment of slope greater than 1/4"
 (6 mm) in 10' (3 m) are present when tested with a straightedge
 placed perpendicular to the centerline.
 510.05 Method of Measurement. Grinding Portland Cement
 Concrete Pavement will be measured by the square yard (square
 meter).
 510.06 Basis of Payment. Work completed and accepted and

 RUBBLIZING PORTLAND CEMENT
 CONCRETE PAVEMENT
 513.01 Description. This item shall consist of rubblizing and
 compacting existing portland cement concrete pavement at the
 locations shown on the plans or where directed by the Engineer.
 513.02 Equipment. The equipment used shall be subject to the
 approval of the Engineer and shall comply with the following:
 (a) Rubblizing equipment shall be a self-contained, selfpropelled resonant frequency breaker specifically designed for
 the purpose of rubblizing portland cement concrete pavement and
 capable of producing low amplitude 2000 pound (8900 N) force
 blows at a rate of not less than 44 cycles per second.
 (b) Compacting equipment shall be a steel drum vibratory
 roller having a gross weight of 10 tons (9100 kg), operated in the
 vibrating mode.
 Any other equipment needed for rubblizing shall have prior
 approval from the Engineer.
 513.03 Materials. Stone Backfill shall meet the requirements of
 Section 207.
 Aggregate base course shall meet the requirements of Section
 303 for Aggregate Base Course (Class 7).
 513.04 Construction Requirements. The rubblization shall be
 done in partial widths when necessary to maintain traffic. When
 rubblizing in a lane adjacent to a lane that is open to traffic,
 measures shall be taken to prevent debris from entering the traffic
 lane. Rubblizing shall be scheduled and performed to minimize
 exposure to inclement weather and to provide sufficient time to
 place the base or binder course within one allowable lane closure
 period as set forth in plans or Contract.
 384
 
 513
 A joint shall be saw cut full-depth at existing longitudinal joints
 between the main lanes and ramps and at transverse joints where
 rubblizing abuts pavement that is to remain in place.
 The existing concrete pavement shall be broken into pieces
 ranging from sand size to pieces generally 6″ (150 mm) or less in
 size. No individual pieces shall exceed 8″ (200 mm) in any
 dimension. The majority of rubblized concrete volume shall be
 nominal 1″ to 3″ (25 mm to 75 mm) in size. At the beginning of the
 rubblizing operations, a 4′ by 4′ (1.2 m by 1.2 m) test pit shall be
 excavated in the middle of a lane at a location selected by the
 Engineer to determine if the breaker is producing pieces of the
 specified sizes. Additional test pits may be required if the Engineer
 determines that they are necessary.
 The breaker shall be operated with a maximum amplitude of one
 inch (25 mm) to avoid damaging the base and underlying structures.
 Existing asphalt overlays and thin asphalt patches shall be
 removed by cold milling or other approved methods prior to
 rubblization. Where directed by the Engineer, existing full-depth
 asphalt patches shall be removed and new patches placed according
 to the requirements of Section 415. All material resulting from the
 removal of existing overlay and patches shall be disposed of in
 accordance with Section 201.
 Rubblizing shall begin at a free edge or previously broken edge
 and progress toward the opposite shoulder or longitudinal centerline
 of the road. In areas where the roadway is to be overlaid one lane at
 a time, rubblizing shall extend a minimum of 6″ (150 mm) beyond
 the edge of pavement to be overlaid.
 Reinforcement in the rubblized pavement shall be left in place.
 However, any reinforcement exposed at the surface during
 rubblizing or compacting operations shall be cut off below the
 surface and removed.
 The rubblized pavement shall be compacted with a minimum of
 three passes up and back with a steel drum vibratory roller.
 Additional passes may be required by the Engineer if necessary to
 satisfactorily compact the rubblized pavement. The roller shall be
 operated at a speed not to exceed 6 feet per second (2 meters per
 second).
 
 385
 
 513
 At locations where the operations of rubblizing and compacting
 the existing pavement reveal soft spots or depressions in the surface,
 they shall be repaired by removing the rubblized pavement, base
 course and subgrade as necessary as unclassified excavation in
 accordance with Section 210 and placing and compacting stone
 backfill and/or aggregate base course as directed by the Engineer.
 Depressions in the surface that are deemed stable by the Engineer
 shall be corrected by adding aggregate base course and compacting
 as directed by the Engineer.
 513.05 Method of Measurement. (a) Rubblizing portland
 cement concrete pavement will be measured by the square yard
 (square meter) in accordance with Section 109. No deduction will
 be made for minor non-rubblized areas such as catch basins or fulldepth asphalt patches.
 (b) Removal of existing asphalt overlays and asphalt surface
 patches will be measured by the square yard (square meter).
 (c) Material for patching will be measured and paid for by the ton
 (metric ton) according to Section 415.
 (d) Removal of existing rubblized portland cement concrete
 pavement and base course will be measured as unclassified
 excavation by the cubic yard (cubic meter). The volume will be
 determined by measuring the average length, width and depth.
 (e) Stone Backfill will be measured by the ton (metric ton)
 according to Section 207.
 (f) Aggregate base course will be measured by the ton (metric
 ton) according to Section 303.

 maintained in good serviceable condition that will safely
 accommodate traffic using the facility for the duration of the work.
 Temporary pipes in detour or stage construction shall be as
 shown on the plans or shall be approved before installation. No
 additional payment will be allowed if a bridge type structure is
 furnished in lieu of a temporary culvert at the Contractor's request.
 Construction of approaches to temporary culverts or bridge
 structures, or other roadway construction shown on the plans as part
 of detour or stage construction, shall conform to the lines, grades,
 cross sections, and typical sections shown on the plans or established
 by the Engineer. Materials used in detour or temporary roadway
 construction, and the maintenance thereof, shall comply with the
 requirements of the applicable sections of the specifications covering
 the items.
 The detour or temporary roadway shall be maintained in a
 condition to allow the safe and convenient passage of vehicles.
 When the plans do not provide for a dust free surfacing, the
 passageway shall be maintained dust free by the application of water
 397
 
 603
 or other approved material to the roadway itself or to adjacent areas
 of construction activity that are the source of dust.
 Temporary culverts or bridge structures shall be removed when
 the new facility has been completed and opened to traffic.
 Materials from temporary culverts or temporary bridge structures
 shall remain the property of the Contractor. Materials used on
 detours and in stage construction and not incorporated into the
 permanent work, shall be salvaged to the extent practicable and used
 for base on other detours, drives, approaches, islands or shoulders,
 or stockpiled as directed. Non-salvageable materials shall be
 disposed of by the Contractor according to Section 201.
 (d) Projects on Existing Roadways. Shoulder material shall not
 be cut away from the edge of the pavement on both sides of any
 section open to traffic. Unless otherwise specified, the total length
 of work areas on the entire project having vertical differences greater
 than 4" (100 mm) adjacent to the edge of traveled lanes shall be
 limited to 5,280 linear feet (2 km) in advance of backfill.
 Where detour or stage construction is specified, traffic control
 shall be accomplished as shown on the plans or as modified by the
 Engineer.
 The Contractor shall provide the Engineer with a minimum of
 three full business days advance, written notification of any nonemergency lane closure or lane width restriction. The first full
 business day shall commence at midnight on the first business day
 following written notification to the Engineer. This advanced
 notification is required to allow adequate notice for the issuance of
 over width load permits by the Department.
 Where any operations result in a vertical differential at the
 centerline, lane lines, or edge of pavement, the Contractor shall
 immediately place traffic control devices or install a positive barrier
 according to the plans. Traffic control devices shall be maintained
 until the planned typical section is completed or until temporary
 shoulders are constructed.
 In addition to the above requirements, when pavement
 construction in lanes open to traffic results in a vertical differential
 at the centerline, lane lines, or edge of pavement, then backfill or
 398
 
 603

 **Traffic control devices shall be installed according to the plans.
 However, shoulder work in conjunction with overlay projects shall
 be accomplished within 7 business days.
 Where temporary shoulder construction is utilized, the shoulder
 material shall closely match the grade at the edge of the pavement,
 but not necessarily conform to the planned typical section. The
 temporary material shall be stable, but specification density will not
 be required. Caution shall be exercised in temporary shoulder
 construction to prevent damage to the pavement. The Contractor
 will be required to maintain the temporary shoulder in a safe
 condition until the planned typical shoulder section is constructed.
 The Contractor may utilize the planned shoulder material for the
 temporary shoulder or, at Contractor option, may use other materials
 approved by the Engineer. Any temporary material that does not
 comply with the requirements of the planned shoulder material shall
 be removed by the Contractor before constructing the planned
 shoulder. There will be no additional payment for constructing,
 maintaining, or removing temporary shoulders.
 Where Contracts do not include shoulder work, the Contractor
 shall coordinate work with the State, County, or City forces that will
 be performing the shoulder work. In this case, the State, County, or
 399
 
 603
 City will be responsible for placing and maintaining the required
 "Low Shoulder" signs. The Contractor will be responsible for all
 other construction signs until completion of the Contract.
 Temporary culverts or bridge structures required in detour or
 stage construction shall be according to Subsection 603.02(c).
 The Contractor shall schedule all work in a manner that will
 allow the routing of traffic over the permanent pavement as quickly
 as practicable.
 When the plans do not show a detailed sequence of construction
 or planned detour, the Contractor shall provide a safe and convenient
 two-way passage throughout the entire length of the work. The
 Contractor shall perform the work and operate equipment in a
 manner that will permit the safe, continuous flow of two-way traffic
 through the work at all times, except when blasting or other
 potentially hazardous construction operations are actually in
 progress and where the unregulated movement of traffic would be
 unsafe. In such sections, the Contractor shall provide a safe and
 convenient passageway for traffic either by means of one-way
 passage on the roadway, with traffic controlled by flaggers or signal
 lights, or by means of short, two-way temporary detours within the
 right-of-way. Such sections shall be limited to approximately 1500'
 (500 m) in length. If traffic conditions warrant, the length of such
 sections may be increased or decreased as directed or approved by
 the Engineer.
 The Contractor shall utilize, and store when directed, material
 available within the project, including existing surfacing, which is
 suitable for surfacing temporary portions of the grading for use as
 passageways for traffic. Gravel or crushed stone may be used for
 temporary surfacing if other suitable materials are not available
 within the project limits.

 classified as follows:
 
 Pavement markings are
 
 a. Permanent Pavement Markings.
 Permanent
 pavement markings are those markings that will be left in
 place upon completion of the project.
 Permanent
 pavement markings shall comply with the requirements of
 Sections 3A and 3B of the MUTCD and Section 718, 719,
 or 720, as specified on the plans or in the Contract. Skip
 lines shall be placed on a 40' (12 m) cycle (10' [3 m]
 stripe, 30' [9 m] skip) for white lane lines and for yellow
 centerlines where passing is permitted. No-passing zones
 shall be marked with solid yellow lines. Edge lines shall
 be white solid lines for both edges of the pavement on
 two-way traffic roadways.
 On divided multi-lane
 roadways, edge lines shall be white solid lines on the
 409
 
 604
 outside edge and solid yellow on the inside edge. Unless
 otherwise specified, all lines shall be broken only for
 street and/or ramp intersections.
 b. Construction Pavement Markings. Construction
 pavement markings are those markings that will be
 removed, replaced with permanent markings, or covered
 with a pavement course before the completion of the
 project. Construction pavement markings shall comply
 with the requirements of Sections 3A and 3B of the
 MUTCD and shall be the same pattern as Permanent
 Pavement Markings. Unless otherwise specified, edge
 lines will not be required. The Contractor shall replace all
 markings that become ineffective, as determined by the
 Engineer, at no cost to the Department.
 c. Interim Pavement Markings. Interim pavement
 markings are those that may be used for a short period of
 time until it is practical and possible to place either
 permanent or construction pavement markings. Interim
 pavement markings shall be replaced with permanent or
 construction markings or covered with a succeeding
 course of paving within three (3) calendar days on highvolume roads or fourteen (14) calendar days on lowvolume roads. (Day 1 of the 3- or 14-day period is the
 first calendar day that it becomes practical and possible to
 place permanent or construction pavement markings.) If
 interim markings are not covered or replaced with
 permanent or construction markings within the specified
 time period, no work on the project shall continue or
 commence until either permanent or construction
 pavement markings are in place. High-volume and lowvolume roads will be designated on the plans.
 Except as noted below for divided multi-lane
 roadways, interim pavement markings shall consist of
 white lane lines and yellow centerlines placed on a 40' (12
 m) cycle (4' [1.2 m] stripe, 36' [10.8 m] skip). When
 interim markings are used and unless otherwise specified,
 all two- and three-lane, two-way traffic roadways shall be
 marked with a single 4" (100 mm) wide yellow skip line
 on the centerline so as to operate as two-lane roadways.
 410
 
 604
 Four lane two-way traffic roadways shall be marked
 with double 4" (100 mm) wide yellow skip lines on the
 centerline and a single 4" (100 mm) wide white skip line
 on lane lines in each direction so as to operate as four-lane
 roadways. On all roadways with existing turn lanes
 (either continuous or dedicated), the existing striping
 pattern shall be maintained with the interim markings.
 The center turn lane shall be marked with double 4" (100
 mm) wide yellow skip lines on each side of the turn lane
 and a single 4" (100 mm) wide white skip line shall be
 used on lane lines in each direction. On multi-lane
 divided roadways, a 4" (100 mm) wide white skip line 10'
 (3 m) long on a 40' (12 m) cycle shall be installed on the
 lane line(s) in each direction.
 In conjunction with interim pavement markings on
 roadways marked for two-way traffic, no-passing zones
 shall be marked with signs. DO NOT PASS signs (R4-1)
 shall be placed at the beginning of no-passing zones and
 the PASS WITH CARE sign (R4-2) shall be placed at the
 end of no-passing zones. When the length of the nopassing zone exceeds 1/2 mile (800 m) in length, or when
 the alignment of the roadway warrants, supplemental DO
 NOT PASS signs shall be placed at 1/2 mile (800 m)
 intervals, or more frequently if necessary, to provide
 adequate warning to the public. The signs shall be
 mounted as shown on the plans.
 Construction Raised Pavement Markers, when used,
 shall be securely attached to the surface in such manner
 that the surface will not be damaged and the device will
 remain in place for the time required for its use. Markers
 that become detached from the surface, are damaged, are
 coated with asphalt, or otherwise lose their effectiveness
 shall be replaced or repaired by the Contractor at no cost
 to the Department.
 (2) Application of Markings. Pavement markings shall be
 applied as follows:
 a. Final Surfaces. Permanent or construction markings,
 as specified in the Contract, shall be in place on the final
 surface at the end of each day's operations on all lanes
 411
 
 604
 open to traffic. Unless otherwise specified, edge lines
 will not be required. The Contractor may, at Contractor
 option and expense, use interim pavement markings as
 follows:
 High volume roads. On roadways designated on
 the plans as high volume, interim pavement
 markings may be used for not longer than 3 calendar
 days. All centerline and lane line permanent
 markings shall be placed within the three-day
 period.
 Low volume roads. On roadways designated on
 the plans as low volume, interim pavement
 markings may be used for not longer than 14
 calendar days.
 All centerline and lane line
 permanent markings shall be placed within the
 14 day period.
 The Contractor shall carefully place all interim
 markings to avoid any overlapping by the permanent
 pavement markings. Interim pavement markings shall be
 removed from the final surface as soon as possible after
 the placement of permanent markings. Any voids caused
 by the removal of interim markings shall be repaired
 immediately at the Contractor’s expense.
 For all
 markings that are to be removed, paint will not be allowed
 on the final surface unless otherwise authorized in writing
 by the Engineer.
 On roadways open to traffic, if interim pavement
 markings are used, they shall be removed only after
 permanent pavement markings are in place.
 b. Intermediate Surfaces. On all except the final
 surfaces, construction pavement markings shall be in
 place at the end of each day's operations on roadways
 open to traffic. Unless otherwise specified, edge lines
 will not be required. The Contractor may, at Contractor
 option and expense, use interim pavement markings under
 the same conditions and time limits as specified for final
 surfaces.
 412
 
 604
 When CRPM are used on an intermediate surface
 before a final surface of ACHM and when the final
 ACHM surface course will not completely cover the
 CRPM, the CRPM shall be removed immediately in
 advance of the paver placing the final surface course.
 Removal of the CRPM shall be at the Contractor's
 expense.
 c. Detours and Stage Construction. On detours and
 stage construction, construction pavement markings,
 including edge lines when required as shown on the plans,
 shall be in place before opening the roadway to traffic.
 d. Asphalt Surface Treatment. When the final surface
 is asphalt surface treatment, pavement markings shall not
 be placed until the asphalt has set, the aggregate firmly
 embedded, and loose aggregate removed from the surface.
 No-passing zones shall be marked with signs as specified
 under interim pavement markings above. Permanent or
 construction pavement markings shall be placed within 14
 calendar days after placement of the final surface.
 (g) Removable Construction Pavement Markings. The tape,
 pavement, and ambient air temperature shall be 50° F (10° C) and
 rising and the pavement surface shall be free of moisture at the time
 of placement.
 If weather conditions prohibit placement of
 removable construction pavement markings and the Engineer
 determines that pavement markings must be placed due to the
 sequencing of the work, the Contractor shall place and remove
 painted markings. The placement and removal of painted markings
 in this case will be measured and paid for at the contract unit price
 bid for removable construction pavement markings. No payment
 will be made for removable construction pavement markings that do
 not properly adhere to the pavement.
 On jointed concrete pavement, the tape shall be cut at all joints.
 On all other pavements, the tape shall be cut at approximately 40'
 (12 m) intervals.
 (h) Referencing No-Passing Zones.
 On two-way traffic
 roadways, the Contractor shall reference the locations of all nopassing zones with standard DO NOT PASS and PASS WITH
 CARE signs before obliteration of the existing pavement markings.
 413
 
 604
 On detours, new construction, and when construction significantly
 changes the horizontal or vertical alignment of an existing roadway,
 the Department will establish the locations of no-passing zones for
 referencing by the Contractor. Signs used to mark no passing zones
 shall remain in place until installation of permanent markings or
 final acceptance of the project, whichever is earlier.
 On unpaved or unmarked roadways, the Contractor shall mark the
 locations of no-passing zones with signs immediately after the
 Department establishes the locations of the zones. If permanent or
 construction pavement markings are placed immediately after zoning
 is completed, the marking of no-passing zones with signs will not be
 required.
 (i) Advance Warning Arrow Panel. Advance warning arrow
 panels shall be placed as shown on the plans or as directed, and shall
 remain in place for the time specified by the Engineer. The Engineer
 will specify the mode of operation to be used.
 (j) Portable Changeable Message Signs. Portable changeable
 message signs shall be installed at the locations shown on the plans
 or as directed by the Engineer. The Engineer will specify the

 (f) Backfilling. (1) General. Special care shall be taken to
 compact the fill under the haunches of the pipe. In trench
 excavation, the backfill above the area specified as structural backfill
 (or structural bedding for reinforced concrete pipe culverts) shall be
 placed in 6″ (150 mm) lifts and compacted with mechanical
 equipment to 95% of the maximum density, as determined by
 AASHTO T 99. In a fill section, the backfill shall be brought up
 evenly on each side for the full length of the pipe to avoid
 displacement. The berm of thoroughly compacted material on each
 side of the pipe shall be at least as wide as the outside diameter of
 the pipe. The Department will perform acceptance sampling and
 testing of the compacted backfill material in accordance with
 Subsection 210.10 at the frequencies established in the Department’s
 Manual of Field Sampling and Testing Procedures. Pipe damaged
 during construction operations shall be replaced at no cost to the
 Department.
 When the existing material excavated for the pipe trench is
 determined by the Engineer to be unsuitable for pipe backfill, this
 428
 
 606
 material shall be placed at other locations on the project such as
 backfill behind curbs, placed on the fill slopes, etc. If the Engineer
 determines that no suitable location exists on the project to utilize
 this material, the Engineer may approve the material to be wasted at
 an appropriate location outside the project limits according to
 Subsection 210.08. Material declared unsuitable for backfill shall be
 replaced with suitable material from roadway excavation and/or
 borrow. If suitable material from roadway excavation and/or borrow
 is not available, the Engineer may authorize the use of the Selected
 Pipe Backfill.
 (2) Reinforced Concrete Pipe Culverts. Backfilling around the
 pipe shall be with material as shown on the plans. The material shall
 be placed along side the pipe in layers not to exceed 6″ (150 mm) at
 near optimum moisture content and compacted with mechanical
 equipment to 95% of the maximum density, as determined by

 excavation shall be sufficient to permit thorough tamping of the
 backfill material, but shall not exceed the span width by more than 3'
 (1 m) on each side at the bottom of the trench. Side slopes of the
 excavation shall not be flatter than 2:1 except where unsuitable
 material is encountered.
 (b) Bedding. The pipe shall be bedded in an earth foundation of
 uniform density, carefully shaped by means of a template supported
 at the desired grade, to fit the lower plate of the pipe. A minimum
 camber of 1% of the length of pipe shall be made to allow for
 settlement. The amount of camber shall be varied to suit the height
 of fill and supporting soil as directed.
 Where rock in either ledge or boulder formation is encountered, it
 shall be removed to a depth of at least 12" (300 mm) below the
 grade established for the bottom of the structure, and to a minimum
 width equal to the span. This additional excavation shall be
 backfilled with material complying with Subsection 608.03(d).
 If the existing material exposed at the grade established for the
 bottom of the structure appears unstable and is of such character as
 to invite unequal settlement along the length of the structure, such
 unstable material shall be removed as directed and the excavation
 shall be backfilled with gravel or other suitable material as
 hereinafter specified and thoroughly tamped or otherwise compacted
 in place to ensure a firm foundation. Any necessary excavation
 below the invert of the structure shall be made according to

 tightened progressively through the structure. All nuts shall be
 tightened a second time to a torque of not less than 100 foot-pounds
 (135 newton meters [N·m]) nor more than 250 foot-pounds
 (340 N·m). Each 20th bolt will be checked with a torque wrench
 that shall be furnished by the Contractor. Where tests indicate loose
 bolts, the bolts in that area shall be properly tightened and additional
 tests made. Standard bolts are furnished in two lengths: the short
 bolts shall be placed where two plates lap and the long bolts shall be
 placed where three plates lap. All service bolts used in drawing the
 plates together shall be replaced with standard bolts.
 (d) Backfill. Unless otherwise specified on the plans, backfill
 material shall be of a granular nature with a maximum size of 3"
 (75 mm), free of frozen lumps, chunks of highly plastic clay, or
 other objectionable matter. Materials from roadway excavation or
 borrow meeting these requirements may be used if approved by the
 Engineer.

 619
 619.03 Construction Requirements. (a) General. The fence
 shall be erected parallel to and at a specified distance from the rightof-way line, or as directed. The fence grade shall generally follow
 the ground contour, but shall present a uniform appearance. Minor
 grading along the fence line may be necessary to obtain the desired
 uniformity in fence grade. The fence alignment may be adjusted by
 the Engineer to preserve trees, land monuments, property corner
 markers, and the position of right-of-way monuments in place or
 planned. The Contractor may clear trees from a strip approximately
 10' (3 m) wide adjacent to and within the right-of-way to
 accommodate fence erection equipment. Grubbing or scalping of
 the cleared strip shall not be permitted to prevent damage to trees,
 shrubs, grass, and other vegetation designated to remain. Clearing
 shall be performed according to Section 201.06.
 (b) Wire Fence. Line posts and pull assemblies shall be spaced
 as shown on the plans. Wood line, corner, gate, and pull posts may
 be driven in place provided the driving does not damage the post; or
 they may be set in dug holes and backfilled with earth thoroughly
 compacted as placed; or set in concrete. Metal corner, gate, end, and
 pull posts shall be set in concrete. Wire shall not be stretched onto
 posts set in concrete until seven days after placement of posts. Posts
 shall be set plumb.
 The Contractor has the option of using wood or steel posts and
 braces unless otherwise specified, but shall use the same material on
 the entire project. Wood end, corner, and pull posts may be used
 with steel line posts.
 When solid rock is encountered, the posts shall be set to the
 required depth for soil unless the penetration into solid rock would
 exceed 10" (250 mm) for line posts and 16" (400 mm) for end,
 corner, gate, and pull posts. In such cases, the posts shall be set into
 the solid rock a minimum depth of 10" (250 mm) for line posts and
 16" (400 mm) for end, corner, gate, and pull posts. The hole in the
 rock shall have a minimum cross section dimension 1" (25 mm)
 greater than the post to be set. The posts shall be cut before setting
 to give the proper length above ground surface. The hole shall be
 filled with Class M Concrete or a grout consisting of 1 part Portland
 cement and 3 parts concrete sand.
 
 468
 
 619
 Wire tension braces for wood pull, end, and corner assemblies
 shall consist of a 9 gage wire passed around the posts to form a
 double wire. The wire shall be fastened to each post and the ends
 fastened together to form a continuous wire. The wires shall then be
 twisted together until the wire is in tension.
 Where the new fence joins an existing fence, the two shall be
 attached in a satisfactory manner, with end posts being set as
 directed. Where the proposed fence intersects an existing fence, the
 end post shall be set for the existing fence clear of the proposed
 fence line as shown on the plans. The wire of the existing fence
 shall be stapled to the end post. When the point of intersection falls
 more than 2' (0.6 m) from a post on Type A and B fence, a line post
 shall be set at the intersection.
 Pull post assemblies shall be placed at intervals of not more than
 330' (100 m) in straight alignment on level or uniformly sloping
 ground, and at sharp vertical angle points in the line.
 Corner post assemblies shall be placed at all horizontal angle
 points of 15° or more in the fence. When the distance from a corner
 post to the next corner or pull post is less than 165' (50 m), one
 approach span on the corner assembly may be omitted.
 End post assemblies at fence ends, gates, bridge abutments, and
 on banks of streams shall be erected in the same manner as corner
 construction. Extra length posts shall be provided for crossing small
 streams, ditches, ravines, or soft ground. Additional depth of set
 shall be secured in soft ground as directed.
 The wire shall be attached to the face of the post away from the
 highway, except on curves where the fencing shall be attached on
 the outside of the curve. The wire shall be attached to wood line
 posts with staples driven at right angles to the grain and at a slight
 downward angle to attain the best anchorage. The staples shall not
 be driven tightly against the wire but shall leave just enough free
 space for adjustment in tension due to changes in temperature. Wire
 shall be attached to steel line posts with approved galvanized clips.
 All barbed wire and alternate line wires of woven fabric shall be
 fastened to each line post. Barbed wire and all line wires of woven
 fabric shall be fastened to end, corner, and pull posts by wrapping
 the wire around the posts and tying the wire back on itself with not
 469
 
 619
 less than 3 tightly wrapped twists. Splicing of barbed wire and
 woven wire shall be done according to the plans.
 Tension for stretching the barbed wire and woven wire shall be
 applied by use of standard wire stretchers manufactured for that
 purpose. The use of trucks, tractors, and similar equipment will not
 be permitted in the tensioning operation, except as anchors.
 (c) Chain Link Fence. All posts shall be set in concrete as
 shown on the plans, plumb, and true to line and grade. The concrete
 shall comply with Subsection 619.02, and shall be thoroughly
 tamped around the posts. The posts shall be equally spaced in the
 line of fence not to exceed the spacing shown on the plans. The top
 of the footing shall be domed to drain water away from the post.
 Concrete in post footings shall be at least 7 days old before
 stretching and securing fabric to posts, bracing, or hanging of gates.
 Top rails, when required, shall pass through post caps and shall
 be securely fastened to end, brace, pull, and corner posts. Joints in
 top rails shall be made with expansion sleeve couplings to provide a
 substantial connection and allow for expansion and contraction of
 the rail.
 Before the fence fabric is placed, the tension wire shall be placed
 at the proper location; stretched taut; securely anchored to each end,
 corner, or intermediate brace post; and satisfactorily fastened to each
 line post.
 The fence fabric shall be attached to the face of the post away
 from the highway, except on curves, where the fabric shall be placed
 on the outside of the curve.
 The end of the fabric shall be attached to the posts by means of a
 stretcher bar threaded through the end loops of the fabric and
 secured to the posts with clamps and bolts. The fabric shall be
 stretched to remove all slack with approved stretching equipment.
 The stretched fabric shall be secured to line posts, top rail, braces,
 and tension wire with specified fabric fasteners. Fabric fasteners
 shall be placed on line posts at not greater than 14" (350 mm)
 centers and on top rail, braces, and tension wire at not greater than
 24" (600 mm) centers. Stretching operations shall be repeated at
 approximately every 100' (30 m) for each run of fence. The use of
 
 470
 
 619
 trucks, tractors, and similar equipment will not be permitted in the
 stretching operation, except as anchors.
 Splicing of the fabric shall be done by interweaving a wire picket
 through each end loop of each piece of fabric in a manner that will
 neatly and securely fasten the lengths of fabric together.
 (d) Gates. Gates of the length and type shown on the plans shall
 be constructed at the locations shown on the plans or as directed.
 619.04 Method of Measurement. (a) Fence will be measured by
 the linear foot (meter) in place along the midpoint in height of the
 fence from outside to outside of the end posts. The lengths of gates
 will be excluded from this measurement.
 (b) Gates will be measured by the unit.
 619.05 Basis of Payment. Work completed and accepted and
 measured as provided above will be paid for as follows:
 (a) Wire Fence will be paid for at the contract unit price bid per
 linear foot (meter) for Wire Fence of the type specified.
 (b) Chain Link Fence will be paid for at the contract unit price
 bid per linear foot (meter) for Steel Chain Link Fence or Aluminum
 Chain Link Fence of the height specified.
 (c) Gates will be paid for at the contract unit price bid per each
 for Gates of the type and dimensions specified.
 The contract unit prices mentioned above shall be full
 compensation for clearing, grading, setting posts, and erecting fence;

 (d) Mulch cover shall consist of straw from threshed rice, oats,
 wheat, barley, or rye; of wood excelsior; or of hay obtained from
 various legumes or grasses, such as lespedeza, clover, vetch,
 soybeans, bermuda, carpet sedge, bahia, fescue, or other legumes or
 grasses; or a combination thereof. Mulch shall be dry and
 reasonably free from Johnson grass or other noxious weeds, and
 shall not be excessively brittle or in an advanced state of
 474
 
 620
 decomposition. All material will be inspected and approved prior to
 use.
 (e) Tackifiers. Tackifiers used in mulch anchoring shall be of
 such quality that the mulch cover will be bound together to form a
 cover mat that will stay intact under normal climatic conditions.
 All tackifiers used shall have prior approval or be listed on the
 Department's Qualified Products List (QPL).
 (f) Water shall be of irrigation quality and free of impurities that
 would be detrimental to plant growth.
 620.03 Construction Requirements. (a) Seedbed Preparation.
 Areas to be seeded shall be dressed to the shape and section shown
 on the plans. If the plans call for replacing topsoil, this shall be done
 before any preparations for seeding. Before beginning the seedbed
 preparation, soil samples shall be obtained from each major soil area
 (such as cut backslope or fill foreslope) by the Engineer for lime
 requirement analysis.
 Lime, at the rate determined by the lime requirement test, shall be
 uniformly spread on areas to be seeded prior to their being
 roughened or scarified. The seedbed shall be thoroughly pulverized
 by means of disk harrows or other approved methods, thoroughly
 mixing lime and soil to a depth of not less than 4" (100 mm) (2"
 [50 mm] for slopes 4:1 or steeper) below finish slope elevation.
 Regardless of the pulverizing method used, the soil shall be broken
 with the contour of the slope. Objectionable foreign matter shall be
 removed and the soil left in a suitable horticultural condition to
 receive the fertilizer and seed. Water may be applied before, during,
 and after seedbed preparation, as directed by the Engineer, in order
 to maintain the desired moisture content in the soil.
 When no lime is required, seedbed preparation shall be
 accomplished as specified above regardless of the method used in
 the distribution of fertilizer, seed, and mulch cover.
 (b) Fertilization. Fertilizer shall be applied at the rate of 800
 pounds per acre (900 kg/ha) of 10-20-10, or the equivalent amount
 of plant food. Fertilizer shall be uniformly incorporated into the soil
 alone or in conjunction with the required lime. If the Contractor so
 elects, the fertilizer may be drilled into the soil or combined with the
 seed in the hydro-seeding operation.
 475
 
 620
 (c) Seeding. (1) Broadcasting.
 Broadcast sowing may be
 accomplished by hand seeders or by approved power equipment.
 Either method shall result in uniform distribution and no work shall
 be performed during high winds. The area seeded shall be lightly
 firmed with a cultipacker immediately after broadcasting.
 (2) Drilled in Rows. When seed is drilled in rows, the rows shall
 be horizontal (parallel to contour lines). Fertilizer and seed shall not
 be drilled together and shall not be mixed.
 (3) Hydro-seeding. If a hydro-seeder is used for seeding,
 fertilizer and seed may be incorporated into one operation but a
 maximum of 800 pounds of fertilizer shall be permitted for each
 1500 gallons (maximum of 95 kg for each 1500 L) of water. If the
 Contractor so elects, the fertilizer may be applied during preparation
 of the seedbed. The area shall be lightly firmed with a cultipacker
 immediately before hydro-seeding.
 (d) Mulch Cover. Mulch cover shall be applied at the rate of
 4000 pounds per acre (4500 kg/ha) immediately after seeding and
 shall be spread uniformly over the entire area by approved power
 mulching equipment.
 When approved by the Engineer, the
 Contractor may use hand methods to apply mulch cover to small or
 inaccessible areas. If the Contractor so elects, an approved mulching
 machine may be used whereby the application of mulch cover and
 tackifier may be combined into one operation. If this method is
 used, no change in application rates will be allowed. In its final
 position, the anchored mulch shall be loose enough to allow air to
 circulate, but compact enough to partially shade the ground and
 reduce the impact of rainfall on the surface of the soil. Care shall be
 taken to prevent tackifier materials from discoloring or marking
 structures, pavements, utilities, or other plant growth. Removal of
 any objectionable discoloration shall be at no cost to the
 Department.
 (e) Mulch Anchoring. Immediately following or during the
 application of the mulch cover on seeded areas, the mulch shall be
 anchored by one of the following methods:
 •
 
 Tracking or Roller Method. The mulch shall be effectively
 pressed into the soil using steel cleated track or cleated roller
 equipment. The anchoring shall be performed so that the
 grooves formed are perpendicular to the flow of water down
 476
 
 620
 backslopes and foreslopes. The equipment and method used
 shall produce acceptable results.
 •
 
 Asphalt Tackifier. Asphalt shall be applied at the rate of
 approximately 0.05 gallon per square yard (0.2 L/sq m).
 Application shall be made using a pressure distributor to
 ensure constant and uniform distribution. The use of asphalt
 may be reduced or eliminated by the Engineer at selected
 locations.
 
 •
 
 Other Tackifiers. Tackifiers listed on the QPL shall be
 applied according to the rates recommended in the QPL.
 
 The method used shall be at the Contractor's option unless
 otherwise specified or directed. In lieu of separate application of
 tackifiers, the Contractor may use equipment that combines the
 application of mulch and tackifier into one operation. Application
 shall be at the specified rates.
 (f) Water. (1) Initial Application. From April 1 through
 December 31, either the day before the seeding is placed or on the
 day of the seeding operation (either before the seed is placed or after
 the application of the mulch cover), a minimum of 20.4 M Gallons
 per acre (188 cu m or 188 kL per ha) of water will be applied to
 thoroughly moisten the soil to the depth of pulverization and then as
 necessary to germinate the seed. This quantity may be reduced by
 the Engineer dependent on the soil moisture conditions immediately
 prior to the application of the seeding. Failure to apply the initial
 application of the quantity of water directed by the Engineer will
 result in a deduction in payment as shown below. Water used for
 hydro-seeding or tackifier application will not be measured or paid
 for, and will not be included in the quantity of water required for the
 initial water application. The initial application of water and
 deductions for failure to water will not be required from January 1
 through March 31.
 (2) Weekly Application. From April 1 – December 31, unless
 otherwise directed by the Engineer, the Contractor shall apply water
 in an amount such that, in conjunction with any rainfall, the seeded
 and mulched areas will receive an amount equivalent to a minimum
 of ¾” (19 mm) of water each week beginning the week after seeding
 and continuing for a minimum of four (4) weeks (¾” [19 mm] of
 water is equivalent to 20.4 M Gallons per acre [ 188 cu m or 188 kL
 477
 
 620
 per ha]). The Engineer will adjust the amount of water required
 each week to deduct any rainfall received during the 7 calendar day
 period prior to the weekly watering. The weekly applications of
 water and deductions for failure to water will not be required from
 January 1 through March 31.
 (3) Failure to Water. Failure to meet the requirements of (1) or
 (2) above will result in a permanent deduction in payment and/or
 permanent recovery of payments equal to the minimum bid price
 established below for each M.G. (kL) not applied as directed in
 accordance with these specifications. Additional work and materials
 required due to the Contractor’s negligence in maintaining
 completed work or failure to water grass as directed shall be
 accomplished at no cost to the Department.
 (4) Watering Equipment. The Contractor shall have on the
 project such equipment of adequate capacity and a suitable water
 supply to achieve the desired moisture level in the soil. The
 equipment and methods used will be such that the application of
 water will not cause erosion or excessive movement of the
 previously placed seed and mulch cover. Any slope that is eroded or
 any seed or mulch cover that is washed down the slope due to failure
 to follow the above requirement will be repaired and/or reseeded at
 no cost to the Department.
 The time required for application of water will not be included in
 the computations of contract time for completion of the project
 provided all other work under the Contract has been completed.
 (g) For areas seeded in the September 1-February 28/29 or
 September 1-March 14 season, final acceptance will be delayed until
 an acceptable stand of grass of uniform color and density is
 established to the satisfaction of the Engineer. The soil condition
 shall be suitable for preparation of the seedbed according to the
 above requirements in the areas to be seeded during the
 September 1-February 28/29 or September 1-March 14 season.
 (h) Before final acceptance, the Contractor shall repair or replace
 any seeding or mulching that is defective or damaged. If the defect
 or damage is due to the Contractor's negligence, the work shall be
 done at no additional cost to the Department. If the damage or
 defect is not the Contractor's fault, the work will be measured and

 621.03 Construction Requirements.
 (a) General
 The
 Contractor shall actively maintain the areas or items constructed
 under this subsection from the time of their completion until the
 Engineer determines the items are no longer required. Additional
 work and materials required because of loss from erosion or other
 causes beyond the Contractor's control will be paid for unless they
 were required due to Contractor's negligence, in which case the
 maintenance shall be at no cost to the Department.
 Temporary erosion control items and devices shall be removed,
 or may remain in place as directed by the Engineer, after final
 stabilization has been achieved but must be removed before the
 Notice of Termination for the Construction Storm Water Permit has
 been submitted. After items have been removed, the affected areas
 shall be graded to conform to the adjacent contours, unless otherwise
 directed by the Engineer. Following this removal and grading,
 permanent stabilization shall be established in these areas.
 Disposal, when required, shall be according to the requirements
 of Sections 110 and 201. Salvageable materials will become the
 property of the Contractor.
 (b) Temporary Seeding. The area designated or directed to be
 temporarily seeded does not have to be brought to typical section or
 a garden-like condition, but shall be lightly tilled.
 Rye or the cereal grasses shall be planted at the rate of 100
 pounds per acre (110 kg/ha) between August 15 and January 20.
 485
 
 621
 Brown Top Millet shall be planted at a rate of 50 pounds per acre
 (55 kg/ha) between January 21 and August 14. The seeding mixture
 may be altered by the Engineer in selected areas with no adjustment
 in contract price. The alteration will be made on an equivalent cost
 basis. Fertilizer shall be applied at the rate of 500 pounds per acre
 (560 kg/ha) of 10-20-10 or the equivalent amount of plant food.
 The Engineer may adjust the seasonal limitations specified above
 when immediate erosion control measures are required and other
 methods are not considered practicable. The decision to adjust
 seasonal limitations will be based on the practicality of planting seed
 at that particular time, with consideration being given to the
 geographic location of the project and the period of time remaining
 before permanent erosion items can be applied.
 From April 1 through December 31, either the day before the
 temporary seeding is placed or on the day of the temporary seeding
 operation (either before the seed is placed or after the application of
 the mulch cover) an application of water will be applied, in
 accordance with Subsection 620.03(f)(1). No subsequent weekly
 waterings will be required for Temporary Seeding.
 Failure to meet this application of water requirement will result in
 a permanent deduction in payment and /or permanent recovery of
 payments equal to the minimum bid price established in Subsection
 620.05(d) for each M.G. (kL) not applied as directed in accordance
 with these specifications. Equipment and methods used to place the
 water shall be in accordance with Subsection 620.03(f)(4).
 (c) Mulch cover shall be applied according to Section 620.
 (d) Erosion control matting shall be applied according to
 Section 626.
 (e) Bales for baled straw filter barriers shall be installed so that
 the bindings are oriented around the sides of the bales and not along
 the tops and bottoms. The bales shall be keyed into the ground a
 minimum of 4" (100 mm) and securely held in place by staking,
 wiring, and/or other methods that will prevent floating and/or
 displacement. No gaps shall be left between bales. The number of
 bales required and the specific arrangement of them will vary with
 the conditions at each site. Bales that become displaced shall be
 retrieved and re-installed, if suitable.
 Bales that become
 486
 
 621
 unserviceable in their original location shall be removed and
 replaced.
 (f) Geotextile fabric for silt fence shall be attached to the
 supporting system in such manner that it will remain attached and
 fully supported for the entire time the barrier is needed for service.
 The fabric toe shall be buried to secure the base as shown on the
 plans. Splices shall be securely fastened. Re-anchoring of the toe of
 the installed silt fence and re-securing the geotextile fabric to the
 supports shall be considered normal maintenance and will be
 considered included in the unit price bid for silt fence.
 After permanent stabilization has been completed, or
 simultaneously with the permanent stabilization, the silt fence and
 the silt trapped by it shall be removed and disposed of as directed by
 the Engineer. Disposal shall be according to the requirements of
 Sections 110 and 201. When directed by the Engineer, silt fences
 shall be left in place.
 (g) For sand bag ditch checks, the sacks shall be filled
 approximately 3/4 full, shall weigh a minimum of 55 pounds
 (25 kg), and shall be securely closed.
 Sand bags shall be placed in the ditches at locations shown on the
 plans or as directed by the Engineer. They shall be laid in horizontal
 courses and successive courses shall break joints with preceding
 ones. The sacks shall be rammed and packed against each other and
 tamped on the surface to secure a uniform surface. The overflow
 area in the center of the ditch check shall be constructed lower than
 the sides. The number of bags required and the arrangement at each
 installation will vary with on-site conditions.
 (h) Excavation and grading for diversion ditches shall be
 according to the dimensions and at the locations shown on the plans
 or as directed by the Engineer.
 (i) Geotextile for drop inlet silt fences shall be attached to the
 supporting system in such manner that it will remain attached and
 fully supported for the entire time the barrier is needed for service.
 The fabric toe shall be buried to secure the base as shown on the
 plans. Splices shall be securely fastened.
 
 487
 
 621
 (j) Rock ditch checks shall be constructed as shown on the plans
 or as directed by the Engineer. The overflow area in the center of
 the ditch check shall be constructed lower than the sides.
 (k) Sediment basins shall be constructed to the dimensions shown
 on the plans or as directed by the Engineer. The soil used in basin
 construction shall be compacted and stabilized. Dumped riprap and
 geotextile for a sediment basin with a spillway outlet shall be placed
 on the spillway as shown on the plans. For sediment basins with a
 pipe outlet, the rock filter material shall be placed around a
 perforated riser pipe that is connected with an elbow to a nonperforated corrugated metal pipe. Sufficient rock filter shall be used
 to cover the perforations and stabilize the riser. An anti-seep collar
 shall be installed.
 Sediment basins shall not be obliterated until final stabilization
 has been achieved. The soil used to create the basin, the sediment
 trapped in the basin, and the dumped riprap and rock filter for the
 outlet may be used to fill the basin; however, all fill material used
 shall be compacted and stabilized. The area shall be graded to
 conform to the adjacent contours, unless otherwise directed by the
 Engineer.
 (l) Sediment collected in the various erosion and sediment control
 devices shall be removed when needed and as directed by the
 Engineer. Sediment basins and ditch checks shall have sediment
 removed when their capacity is reduced by half. Silt fences shall
 have sediment removed when a deposit covers 1/3 the height of the
 structure. Sediment removed shall be deposited and stabilized as
 described in Section 110. Sediment will normally be incorporated
 back into the embankment construction as directed by the Engineer.
 (m) Mulch control netting shall be installed over the mulch with
 the longitudinal length parallel to the slope. Adjacent netting widths
 shall be overlapped by not less than 4" (100 mm). Remaining fabric
 areas shall be stretched, then secured by pinning to the ground with
 approximately 1 staple per square yard (square meter) of area.
 Upslope ends, edges, bottom, and overlaps shall be stapled at 2 foot
 (0.6 meter) intervals.
 (n) Slope drains shall be constructed as shown on the plans or as
 directed by the Engineer. Pipe for slope drains shall be installed
 488
 
 621
 down the slope as shown on the plans and securely held in place by
 anchor stakes or other devices as approved by the Engineer.
 (o) Wattles shall be placed on the ground and securely held in
 place by stakes as shown on the detail sheet. The number of wattles
 required will vary with the conditions at each site; therefore, a series
 of wattles shall either be butted together or overlapped as directed by
 the Engineer. A continuous segment of wattle shall be used in a
 ditch application.
 Accumulated sediment shall be removed when it covers one-half
 the height of the wattle. Sediment removed shall be deposited and
 stabilized as described in Section 110. Payment for this work will
 be made under the item “Sediment Removal and Disposal.” Repair
 of or complete replacement of torn or damaged wattles shall be
 performed as required or as directed by the Engineer. Wattles shall
 be temporarily removed and replaced as required to facilitate
 construction operations.
 When the required work has been completed and the area has
 been stabilized and approved by the Engineer, the wattle netting is to
 be cut and the core material shall be spread out on the surrounding
 ground area. If non-biodegradable netting is used in the wattles, the
 netting shall be removed from the site. If biodegradable netting is
 used, it can remain in place under the organic core material. Upon
 completion of the spreading of the core material, the area is to be
 approximately level so that no barrier to water flow will exist.
 (p) Install, align, and locate the triangular silt dikes as shown on
 the plans, or as directed by the Engineer. All triangular silt dikes
 shall be placed on the contour and in a row with ends tightly
 abutting the adjacent triangular silt dike. Filter material shall lap
 over the ends 6 inches to cover dike to dike junctions; each junction
 shall be secured with wire staples.
 The approach apron shall be followed by the sewn seam and front
 side of the dike section. The exiting apron will lie underneath the
 dike section and extend out beyond the discharge side.
 When triangular silt dikes are installed across surface drainage
 ditches, the highest point of the triangular silt dike in the center of
 the ditch must be lower than the lowest point of the triangular silt
 
 489
 
 621
 dike at the end. This will direct water over the center of the
 triangular silt dike and not around the ends.
 When installed as diversion devices, triangular silt dikes shall be
 placed along the contour or on a 1-2% gradient to a planned
 discharge point.
 Accumulated sediment shall be removed when it covers one half
 the height of the triangular silt dike. During removal of sediment,
 the operator must exercise care within the range of the front apron to
 avoid damage to the device.
 The range of the apron is
 approximately eighteen to twenty four inches (18-24”) from the base
 of the barrier. Sediment removed shall be deposited and stabilized
 as described in Section 110. Payment for this work will be made
 under the item “Sediment Removal and Disposal.”
 Inspect all triangular silt dikes after each rainfall event and/or
 each seven day period. Triangular silt dikes shall be temporarily
 removed and replaced as required to facilitate construction
 operations. Any deficiencies or damage shall be repaired at no cost
 to the Department. Repair of, or complete replacement of torn or
 damaged triangular silt dikes shall be performed as required or as
 directed by the Engineer at no additional cost to the Department.

 622.03 Construction Requirements. (a) Preparation of Areas
 Receiving Sod Mulch. The areas to be sodded shall be brought to a
 reasonably smooth and uniform surface to conform to the finished
 grade and cross section shown on the plans. If the plans call for the
 item replacing topsoil, this shall be done before any other
 preparations for receiving sod mulch.
 
 495
 
 622
 The area shall be thoroughly pulverized by means of disk harrows
 or other approved methods to a depth of not less than 3" (75 mm).
 Regardless of the pulverizing method used, the soil shall be broken
 with the contour of the slope. In areas consisting of shale or rock
 fragments, disking will be waived but lateral furrows 2" to 3" (50
 mm to 75 mm) deep at 36" (1 m) intervals shall be constructed with
 the contour of the slope and sod mulch placed to provide a uniformly
 smooth surface susceptible to being mowed.
 Objectionable foreign matter shall be removed and the soil left in
 a suitable horticultural condition to receive the sod mulch.
 Water may be applied before, during, and after preparation as
 directed by the Engineer to maintain the desired moisture content in
 the soil. Watering shall be according to Section 620.
 (b) Preparation of Areas Producing Sod Mulch. The area
 from which sod mulch is to be secured shall be closely mowed and
 raked to remove all weeds and long standing stems. This operation
 may be dispensed with at the discretion of the Engineer when the
 grass source has been pastured, or for any other reason is free of
 weeds, long standing stems, or other debris.
 Before disking the mulch, soil samples shall be obtained from
 each major soil area or sod field by the Engineer for lime
 requirement analysis.
 On the basis of soil analysis tests, lime shall be applied at 1/3 the
 rate determined per hectare (acre) by the lime requirement test for
 each 1" (25 mm) of depth sod mulch is excavated.
 Fertilizer shall be applied at the rate of 270 pounds per acre
 (300 kg/ha) of 10-20-10, or the equivalent amount of plant food, for
 each 1" (25 mm) of depth sod mulch is to be excavated.
 After mowing and raking, the required lime and fertilizer shall be
 uniformly spread over the sod mulch area. The grass shall then be
 disked thoroughly until the sod has been well mixed with lime and
 fertilizer to the depth the sod mulch is to be removed. Sod mulch
 shall be excavated to a minimum depth of 3" (75 mm) and to a
 maximum depth of 6" (150 mm). Immediately after disking, the sod
 mulch shall be cast into windrows. Care shall be exercised that only
 topsoil is included in the material excavated with the sod.
 496
 
 622
 The sod mulch shall be procured only when the soil is in a moist,
 friable condition.
 (c) Method of Placement. Sod mulch shall not be cut in the
 Spring until the Bermuda grass begins to show growth. Sod Mulch
 shall be hauled and placed before reduced viability has taken place.
 The sod mulch shall be spread uniformly upon the prepared area to
 the required approximate depth shown on the plans or directed by
 the Engineer.
 After the sod mulch has been spread and shaped, the entire area
 shall be satisfactorily compacted by use of rollers, cultipackers, or
 other approved equipment. Any section not true to lines and typical
 cross section shall be corrected by the addition of sod material or by
 reshaping the materials previously placed.
 The sod mulch shall be thoroughly watered immediately after
 being placed. The Contractor shall maintain growth areas from time
 of placement for a period of at least 3 weeks or until final acceptance
 of the project, whichever is greater. The time required for watering
 grass will not be included in computations for time required to
 complete the project provided all other work under the Contract has
 been completed. Additional watering to encourage growth beyond
 the 3-week period shall be applied as directed.
 (d) Restoration. Additional work and materials required because
 of loss through erosion will be paid for under the pertinent contract
 items.
 Additional work and materials required due to the
 Contractors negligence in maintaining completed work shall be
 accomplished at no cost to the Department. The sod mulch source
 field shall be finished according to the agreement between the
 Contractor and Owner. A copy of the agreement will be provided to
 the Engineer before sod is removed. The agreement will stipulate
 the final condition of the source field. All restoration of the source
 field shall be done at no cost to the Department.
 (e) Overseeding. Sod mulch placed after July 31 shall be
 overseeded as soon after placement as possible within the seasonal
 limitations specified in Subsection 620.02(c).
 If packing or
 hardening of the sod mulch has occurred prior to the time of
 overseeding, a surface preparation of light harrowing or other
 method approved by the Engineer shall be applied before seeding.
 No fertilizer will be applied to the areas requiring overseeding. The
 497

 TOPSOIL FURNISHED AND PLACED
 628.01 Description. This item consists of furnishing and placing
 topsoil on completed slopes and ditches according to these
 specifications and at locations shown on the plans or as directed by
 the Engineer.
 628.02 Materials. Topsoil may be obtained from sources outside
 the right-of-way limits or from areas within the project limits that
 will be occupied by cuts and/or embankments. When topsoil is
 furnished from sources outside the right-of-way, the Contractor shall
 be responsible for locating and obtaining the material and for
 performing all work, including erosion control, prevention of water
 pollution, and restoration, according to the specifications. The cost
 of such work will be considered included in the contract unit price
 bid for Topsoil Furnished and Placed. At the request of the
 Engineer, the Contractor shall furnish copies of agreements with the
 property owners.
 Topsoil from all sources shall be the surface layer of soil with no
 admixture of refuse or any material toxic to plant growth and shall
 be reasonably free from subsoil and stumps, roots, brush, stone, clay
 lumps, or similar objects larger than 2" (50 mm) in greatest
 diameter. In no case shall topsoil be excavated more than 12"
 (300 mm) from the original ground level. Brush and other
 vegetation that will not be incorporated with the soil during handling
 operations shall be cut and removed. Ordinary sods and herbaceous
 growth, such as grass and weeds, shall not be removed but shall be
 thoroughly broken up and intermixed with the soil during handling
 operations. Topsoil may contain a reasonable amount of waste from
 clearing operations, such as small twigs and roots, that can be
 expected to reach early decay.
 628.03 Construction Operations. (a) Removing, Storing, and
 Handling Topsoil. Topsoil stripped from within the project shall be
 moved to areas on the right-of-way, or other approved locations, and
 stockpiled. When measurement is to be by the cross section method,
 507
 
 628
 the stockpiles shall be uniformly shaped and susceptible to ready
 measurement by the cross section method. Stockpiles shall be
 located so that they will not interfere with any proposed construction
 nor constitute drainage, traffic, or other hazards, either to the project,
 the general public, or adjacent property. Storage should be in such
 locations that will afford easy access for loading, hauling, and
 replacement.
 The stored topsoil shall be protected from
 contamination.
 If the condition of the soil is unsuitable due to excessive
 moisture, frost, or other conditions, the Contractor shall cease work
 under this item until the soil is in a suitable condition.
 Topsoil stripped from within the project limits shall be removed
 prior to the taking of original cross sections. The Contractor shall
 schedule the work in coordination with the Resident Engineer so as
 to minimize any delay between the stripping of the topsoil, the
 taking of original cross sections, and the beginning of excavation
 and/or embankment construction. Failure of the Contractor to
 properly schedule the work will not be considered as grounds for
 extension of time nor for additional payment due to any resulting
 delays.
 (b) Placing Topsoil. Topsoil shall be distributed over the
 completed slopes and ditches to a depth as shown on the plans or
 designated by the Engineer. Spreading and dressing of the topsoil
 layer shall be uniform insofar as possible. After spreading, any
 remaining large roots, branches, or other foreign substances shall be
 removed to leave a smooth and clean appearance.
 Light rolling, disking, or other type manipulation, including
 sprinkling, shall be applied as necessary to cause the newly spread
 layer to pulverize, mix, and adhere to the slopes. Topsoil shall be
 placed on areas that are to receive seed or sod mulch as soon as
 practicable after the earthwork is completed, but shall not be placed
 until after final cross sections are taken. The Contractor shall
 schedule the work in coordination with the Resident Engineer so as
 to minimize any delay between the completion of the earthwork, the
 taking of final cross sections, and the placement of topsoil. Failure
 of the Contractor to properly schedule the work will not be
 considered as grounds for extension of time nor for additional
 payment due to any resulting delays.
 508
 
 628
 (c) Restoration. Additional work and materials required because
 of loss through erosion will be paid for under the appropriate
 contract item. Additional work and materials required due to the
 Contractor's negligence in maintaining the completed work,

 mulch, and/or solid sod as required, shall be accomplished at no cost
 to the Department.
 The storage sites for topsoil within the right-of-way shall be
 dressed to conform to the adjacent area after the storage piles have
 been removed.
 If the Contractor elects to obtain topsoil from areas within the
 project limits that are to be occupied by embankments, additional
 borrow material required to replace the topsoil will be measured and
 paid for under the appropriate item.
 628.04 Method of Measurement. Topsoil furnished from
 outside the right-of-way will be measured by the cubic yard (cubic
 meter) in vehicles at the point of delivery for use on the project.
 Topsoil obtained from within the project limits will be measured by

 638.01 General. Miscellaneous steel is normally all metal used
 on the project except that used in bridges. When painting of
 miscellaneous steel is specified, the Contractor may, at Contractor
 option, elect to use either the paint system specified for painting
 bridges on the project or the paint system specified in this Section.
 Existing bridge steel may also be painted by this system when
 specified in the plans and cleaned according to Subsection
 820.05(b).
 The Contractor shall exercise every reasonable precaution
 throughout the life of the project to prevent pollution of rivers,
 streams, or impoundments. Painting and cleaning operations
 conducted over or in the vicinity of public waters shall be controlled
 to prevent materials or waste, considered a contaminant by the
 ADEQ, from falling into the water. Any material or waste that falls
 into the water or onto areas where there is a likelihood that it will be
 picked up by rising water levels shall be retrieved and properly
 disposed of in approved locations.
 The Contractor shall protect pedestrian, vehicular, or other traffic
 against damage or disfigurement by drift, spatters, splashes, and
 smirches of paint or paint materials.
 638.02 Aluminum Epoxy Paint System. This system shall

 After application and proper drying time, material shall show no
 appreciable deformation nor discoloration under local traffic
 conditions and in air or road temperatures ranging from 0° F (18° C) to 160° F (71° C). The material shall not smear or spread
 under normal traffic conditions at temperatures below 160° F
 (71° C).
 Under this specification, the term "drying time" shall be defined
 as the minimum elapsed time after application when the pavement
 marking shall have and retain the characteristics required in the
 preceding paragraphs. In addition, the drying time shall be
 established by the minimum elapsed time after application when
 traffic will leave no impression or imprint on the applied marking.
 The drying time shall not exceed a characteristic straight-line curve,
 the limits of which are 2 minutes at 50° F (10° C) and 15 minutes at
 90° F (32° C), measured at a maximum relative humidity of 70%.

 AASHTO M 247 with a Type I gradation and shall be suitably
 treated to resist moisture and retain free flow properties. Beads shall
 not be specially treated to enhance flotation.
 719.03 Construction Requirements.
 The thermoplastic
 compound shall be screed or ribbon extruded to the pavement
 surface. Heat-fused, pre-formed pavement markings shall be fusible
 to asphalt or Portland cement concrete surfaces by means of the
 normal heat of a propane weed-burner type of torch or other heating
 device as recommended by the manufacturer.
 The equipment used to apply the thermoplastic compound onto
 the pavement shall be suitably equipped for heating and controlling
 the flow of the material. The equipment shall be constructed to
 provide continuous mixing and agitation of the material. The
 conveying parts of the equipment, between the main material
 reservoir and applicator, shall be so constructed as to prevent
 accumulation and clogging. The equipment shall be constructed so
 that all mixing and conveying parts, up to and including the
 applicator, maintain the material at the plastic temperature. The
 thermoplastic material shall be dispensed at a temperature
 recommended by the manufacturer. The applicator shall include a
 cutoff device remotely controlled to provide clean, square stripe
 ends and to provide a method for applying skip lines.
 The thermoplastic reservoir shall be insulated and equipped with
 an automatic thermostatic control to maintain the proper temperature
 of the material.
 The thermoplastic machine shall comply with the requirements of
 the National Board of Fire Underwriters.
 Beads applied to the surface of the completed stripe shall be
 applied by an automatic bead dispenser attached to the pavement
 marking equipment in such a manner that the beads are immediately
 dispensed upon the completed line. The bead dispenser shall be
 equipped with an automatic cutoff control, synchronized with the
 cutoff of the pavement marking equipment. The beads shall be
 automatically applied at a minimum uniform rate of 8 pounds (39
 kg) of glass beads to every 100 square feet (100 sq m) of surface.
 Heat-fused, pre-formed pavement markings shall be instantly
 highly reflective without the application of additional glass beads.
 606
 
 719
 Thermoplastic markings shall not be applied to the pavement
 surface when the pavement surface temperature is less than 50° F
 (10° C) or when the pavement surface shows evidence of moisture.
 On new concrete pavements where no pavement markings exist
 or on existing concrete or asphalt pavements where the existing
 pavement markings are paint or thermoplastic and do not conflict
 with the proposed pavement markings, blasting with water or sand
 or a combination thereof will be required to remove any curing
 compound, oxidized paint or thermoplastic, or dirt to ensure a good
 bond. This blasting is considered surface preparation. On newly
 constructed asphalt pavements any sand, grit, or other surface
 contaminants must be removed using compressed air and/or
 sweeping. Water blasting may be necessary to remove surface
 contaminants which cannot be removed by the use of compressed air
 and/or sweeping. This work is considered surface preparation.
 Conflicting pavement markings that exist shall be removed by
 blasting with water and/or sand or by grinding. This blasting or
 grinding is considered pavement marking removal.
 The thickness of thermoplastic markings above the roadway
 surface shall be 90 mils (2.3 mm) (a minimum of 1584 pounds per
 mile [446 kg/km] of 4" [100 mm] line). The thickness will be
 measured by a device supplied by the Contractor during the course
 of the project capable of measuring the thickness of the marking as
 installed on the pavement. The minimum thickness, as required
 above, will be measured in the center of the line when gauged by the
 equipment described above. The minimum thickness 1/2" (12 mm)
 from the edges shall not be less than 75% of the thickness required
 in the center. Maximum thickness of markings is 3/16" (5 mm).
 Heat-fused, pre-formed pavement markings shall be supplied
 with a minimum average thickness of 90 mils (2.3 mm) before
 application on the roadway surface.
 On concrete pavements, paint pavement markings according to
 Section 718 shall be applied as a primer for the thermoplastic
 markings, except where thermoplastic markings are to be applied
 over existing thermoplastic markings. Paint applied to concrete
 pavement solely as a primer will not be measured or paid for
 separately, but full compensation therefor will be considered
 included in the contract unit prices bid for the various items of
 607
 
 719
 Thermoplastic Pavement Markings. A primer other than paint may
 be used when recommended by the thermoplastic manufacturer.
 A primer is not required for asphalt pavements, but paint
 pavement markings complying with Section 718 may be used by the
 Contractor as a primer at no cost to the Department.
 When temperature limitations prohibit placement of
 thermoplastic markings within the 3 or 14 day limit specified in
 Section 604, the Contractor shall place painted markings according
 to Section 718. Painted markings required due to temperature
 limitations will be measured and paid for under Section 604. In this
 case, the Contractor shall maintain the painted markings at no
 additional cost to the Department until the thermoplastic markings,
 including primer if required, are installed.
 Spotting the pavement for center line location on two-way
 roadways is required. It will be the responsibility of the Contractor
 to spot using a string line or chain so that spots are placed at
 intervals not exceeding 10' (3 m). The Department will establish the
 no passing zones if required. On one-way roadways spotting is
 required for the initial edge line or lane line placed. Edge lines
 and/or lane lines may be installed by referencing to center or lane
 lines. Edge lines shall not be broken for driveways. The trace of the
 thermoplastic line shall be uniform.
 The finished lines shall have well defined edges, shall be uniform
 in thickness, and shall be straight and true. No stripe shall be less
 than the specified width. Any corrections of variations in width or
 alignment of the stripes shall not be made abruptly. Lines that
 cannot be corrected to meet these requirements shall be removed in
 accordance with Section 604 at the Contractor’s expense.
 Line removal as specified on the plans shall be performed in such
 a manner that no conflicting pavement marking will be left in place.
 Removal of the pavement marking by a means that will gouge the
 surface will not be permitted.
 The Contractor shall use only workers experienced in installing
 thermoplastic markings.
 719.04 Method of Measurement. (a) Thermoplastic Pavement
 Markings will be measured by the linear foot (meter) of line of the
 width specified actually placed.
 608
 
 719
 (b) Thermoplastic words and arrows will be measured by the
 unit.
 (c) Thermoplastic railroad emblems will be measured by unit.
 One unit shall consist of both R's; the X; the transverse lines; and the

 721
 (1) Packaging. Each package shall be clearly marked as to
 the name of the manufacturer, type, color, quantity enclosed, lot
 number, and date of manufacture.
 (2) Storage. Markers shall be stored indoors and shall be
 protected from any source of moisture both during shipment to
 the project site and at the project site. The markers shall be
 maintained at a temperature high enough to preclude moisture
 condensation, and, at the time of placement, both the markers and
 their containers shall be dry.
 (c) Reflective Pavement Markers.
 markers shall be one of the following types:
 
 Reflective pavement
 
 •
 
 Prismatic reflector type, consisting of methyl methacrylate
 (MM) or suitable compounded acrylonitrile butadiene
 styrene (ABS) shell filled with a mixture of an inert
 thermosetting compound and filler material. The exterior
 surface of the shell shall be smooth and contain one or two
 methyl methacrylate prismatic reflector faces with thin,
 untempered glass bonded to the faces to provide an
 extremely hard and durable abrasion-resistant surface. The
 glass is not required on the red faces of two-way
 (Clear/Red) reflective markers. The infrared curves of the
 compounded MM or ABS shells shall match approved
 curves on file in the Materials Division.
 
 •
 
 High performance microprismatic lens type, consisting of a
 polycarbonate lens with independent lens cells and a
 ceramer lens coating.
 The marker shall consist of
 hermetically sealed components in a fiber reinforced
 polycarbonate body with finger grip indentations for ease of
 handling.
 
 The base of the marker shall be flat (the deviation from a flat
 surface shall not exceed 0.05" [1.3 mm]), rough textured, and free
 from gloss or substances that may reduce its bond to the adhesive.
 Raised pavement markers shall meet the requirements of
 ASTM D 4280.
 (d) Adhesives.
 (1) Epoxy Adhesives. The epoxy adhesives shall comply
 with all the requirements of either Type I, Rapid Setting, High
 615
 
 721
 Viscosity Epoxy Adhesive or Type II, Standard Setting, High
 Viscosity Epoxy Adhesive as specified in AASHTO M 237.
 (2) Bituminous Adhesive for Pavement Markers.
 Bituminous adhesive shall be an asphalt material with a
 homogeneously mixed filler formulated primarily for use in
 bonding pavement markers to Portland cement concrete and
 asphalt concrete. The adhesive must be heated to a liquid state
 for application.
 The epoxy adhesive and/or the bituminous adhesive shall be
 listed on the QPL.
 721.03 Construction Requirements. Existing raised pavement
 markers shall be removed prior to the placement of any overlay or
 seal course. On pavements that are not to be overlaid or sealed,
 existing raised pavement markers which are damaged or which
 conflict with the new markers shall be removed as directed by the
 Engineer. Removal of existing pavement markings will not be paid
 for separately but will be considered subsidiary to other items of the
 work.
 The surface to which the marker is to be bonded shall be free of
 dirt, curing compound, grease, oil, moisture, paint, and any other
 material that would adversely affect the bond of the adhesive. The
 adhesive shall be placed uniformly on the surface or on the bottom
 of the marker in a quantity sufficient to result in complete coverage
 of the area of contact of the marker with no voids present and with a
 slight excess after the marker has been pressed into place. Markers
 utilizing epoxy shall be placed in position and pressure applied until
 firm contact is made with the pavement. Markers with bituminous
 adhesive shall have a minimum adhesive pad thickness of 3/32"
 (2.4 mm) after installation. Viscosity of the bituminous material
 shall be such that flow about the periphery of the marker does not
 exceed 1½" (38 mm). Excess epoxy adhesive around the edge of the
 marker, excess adhesive on the pavement, and adhesive on the
 exposed surfaces of the markers, shall be immediately removed
 using a solvent and procedure recommended by the manufacturer of
 the markers. No other solvent shall be used. The marker shall be
 protected against impact until the adhesive has sufficiently set to
 resist movement.
 
 616
 
 721
 Epoxy adhesive requires that the mixing operation and placing of
 the markers be performed rapidly. Just before use, components A
 and B shall be mixed in a 1:1 ratio by volume. When automatic
 proportioning and mixing machines are used, the temperature of the
 components shall be maintained by indirect heating or cooling, if
 required, for the adhesive to meter, mix, and extrude properly. The
 maximum temperature shall be such that after proper mixing, there
 shall be no excess flow of adhesive from under the marker other
 than that previously specified.
 When hand mixing the Standard Set Type adhesive, not more
 than 1 quart (1 liter) shall be mixed at one time, and the markers
 shall be aligned and pressed into place within 5 minutes after mixing
 operations are started. Any mixed batch that becomes so viscous
 that the adhesive cannot be readily extruded from under the marker
 on application of slight pressure shall not be used.
 Rapid Set Type adhesive shall not be mixed by hand. This
 adhesive shall be mixed by a 2 component type automatic mixing
 and extrusion apparatus.
 When machine mixing the Standard Set Type adhesive or the
 Rapid Set Type adhesive, the markers shall be placed within 60
 seconds after the adhesive has been mixed and extruded and no
 further movement of the marker will be allowed. In addition, no
 more than 90 seconds shall be permitted between the time the
 adhesive is pumped into the mixing head and the time this adhesive
 is in place on the roadway and not subject to further movement. The
 mixed adhesive shall not remain in the mixing head for more than
 45 seconds. Adhesive remaining in the mixing head longer than this
 period shall be wasted before resuming the operation.
 Automatic mixing equipment for the epoxy adhesive shall use
 positive displacement pumps and shall properly meter the
 2 components in the specified ratio, ± 5% by volume of either
 component. At the beginning of each day, and at any other time
 ordered by the Engineer, the ratio shall be checked by the Contractor
 in the presence of the Engineer. This check shall be made by
 disconnecting the mixing heads, or using suitable bypass valves, and
 filling 2 suitable containers with the unmixed components. The
 mixing head shall properly mix the 2 components so that there is no
 trace of black or white streaks in the mixed material.
 617
 
 721
 The Standard Set Type adhesive shall not be used when either the
 pavement or the air temperature is less than 50° F (10° C). The
 Rapid Set Type adhesive shall not be used when either the pavement
 or air temperature is less than 30° F (-1° C). No markers shall be
 installed if the relative humidity of the air is greater than 80% or if
 the pavement surface is not dry.
 Voids in a cured, undisturbed sample of the mixed adhesive
 obtained from the extrusion nozzle shall not exceed 4%.
 The Bituminous Type adhesive shall require the use of a melting
 apparatus. The melting apparatus shall incorporate a means of
 mixing the material before and during installation to assure
 homogeneity. Diffuse heat distortion (diffuse plate) shall be used to
 prevent overheating the material. A dispensing nozzle shall be
 utilized that has an independent way of heating the material to
 provide regulated control over output. The working temperature
 shall be from 400° F to 450° F (204° C to 232° C). The Bituminous
 adhesive shall not be used when either the pavement or air
 temperature is less than 32° F (0° C). The pavement markers can
 only be installed on a dry pavement surface.
 Reflective markers shall be placed in such manner that the
 reflective face of the marker is perpendicular to a line parallel to the
 roadway centerline.
 No pavement markers shall be placed over longitudinal or
 transverse joints of the pavement surface or over pavement cracks.
 721.04 Method of Measurement. Raised Pavement Markers
 will be measured by the unit complete in place.
 721.05 Basis of Payment. Work completed and accepted and
 measured as provided above will be paid for at the contract unit
 price bid each for Raised Pavement Markers of the type specified,

 shall have either Class 1 or Class 2 backing.
 
 621
 
 723
 Retroreflective sheeting shall be applied to properly treated sign
 panels with mechanical equipment in a manner specified by the
 sheeting manufacturer. Sign faces comprising two or more pieces or
 panels of retroreflective sheeting must be carefully matched for
 color at the time of sign fabrication to provide uniform appearance
 and brilliance both day and night. Alternate successive width
 sections of either sheeting or panels must be reversed and
 consecutive to ensure that corresponding edges of retroreflective
 sheeting lie adjacent on the sign. Non-conformance may result in
 non-uniform shading and an undesirable contrast between adjacent
 widths of applied sheeting that will not be acceptable.
 At splices, sheeting shall be overlapped no less than 3/16"
 (5 mm). Sheeting applied to a welded panel shall be trimmed flush
 with the edge of the panel.

 legend and other features of the sign message shall be cut from
 the same Type sheeting as the sign face and shall have a Class 1
 backing.
 (2) Demountable Legend. Unless otherwise shown, the
 legend and other features of the sign message shall be cut from
 the same Type retroreflective sheeting as the sign face and
 applied to flat aluminum frames by a mechanical applicator
 process.
 622
 
 723
 Frames for border strips, corners, shields, and legend shall be
 fabricated from 0.063" (1.6 mm) sheet aluminum complying with

 galvanized steel, or aluminum to fasten the frames to the sign
 face, subject to the condition that dissimilar metals shall be
 insulated to prevent corrosion.
 The aluminum frames shall comply with Subsection
 723.02(b).
 All border material shall be secured from the same company
 that furnishes the cutout letters, numerals, etc., and shall be
 mounted in the same manner as the cutout letters.
 (3) Silk Screen Process. The letters, numerals, arrows,
 symbols, border, and other features shall be produced on
 retroreflective sheeting of the sign field by a silk screen process
 approved by the Engineer. Sign messages and borders of a color
 darker than the sign field shall be applied to the sheeting by direct
 process. Sign messages and borders of a color lighter than the
 sign field shall be produced by the reverse process in which
 message and border are outlined by applying darker transparent
 color to the sheeting of the sign field.
 Transparent colors, inks, and paints used in the silk screen
 process shall be of the type and quality recommended by the

 the Engineer, care shall be exercised to avoid shattering rock faces
 by excessive blasting. The Contractor shall be responsible for any
 extra work and associated costs caused by excessive blasting.
 When concrete is to rest on an excavated surface other than rock,
 special care shall be taken not to disturb the bottom of the
 excavation. As a minimum, the final 1' (0.3 m) of excavation shall
 be completed by hand methods. The final removal of the foundation
 material to grade shall not be made until just before the concrete is
 to be placed. Foundation pits shall be kept dry and free of flowing
 water.
 Details for all excavation and/or shoring for foundation work
 adjacent to operated railroad tracks and plans of falsework, staging,
 protective sheeting, or other temporary construction near the
 operated track, shall be approved by the Railroad Company prior to
 beginning the work. The Contractor shall construct the work
 according to the approved plans.
 801.05 Cofferdams. (a) General. Cofferdams for foundation
 construction shall be safely designed and constructed, and made as
 watertight as is necessary for proper performance of the work. The
 interior dimensions of cofferdams shall provide sufficient clearance
 for dewatering, the construction of forms, and for inspection.
 
 652
 
 801
 Cofferdams that are tilted or moved laterally shall be righted,
 reset, or enlarged as necessary. This shall be at no cost to the
 Department.
 When natural conditions are encountered that render it
 impracticable to dewater the foundation before placing concrete, the
 Engineer may require the construction of a concrete foundation seal
 of such dimensions as may be necessary, according to
 Subsection 802.11. The water shall then be pumped out and the
 balance of the concrete placed in the dry. During the placing of a
 foundation seal, the elevation of the water inside the cofferdam shall
 be controlled to prevent any flow through the seal.
 (b) Protection of Concrete. Cofferdams shall be constructed so
 as to protect the concrete against damage from a sudden rising of the
 stream and to prevent damage to the foundation by erosion. No
 bracing shall be left in cofferdams in such a way as to extend into
 the substructure concrete without the written permission of the
 Engineer.
 (c) Details Required. Details for each unit of cofferdam
 construction, complete with dimensions and kind and condition of
 materials, shall be submitted to the Engineer prior to construction,
 for informational and record purposes. These details shall be
 prepared and/or approved by a Registered Professional Engineer
 who shall certify that the adequacy of all components has been
 verified. File copies of all design calculations shall be maintained
 by the Contractor until final acceptance of the project. The
 Contractor shall be responsible for the results obtained by the use of
 the cofferdam design. Construction of the cofferdam shall be
 according to the details submitted to the Engineer for informational
 purposes.
 (d) Removal.
 Unless otherwise provided, the cofferdams,
 sheeting, and bracing shall be removed after the completion of the
 substructure. Care shall be taken not to damage the finished
 concrete.
 801.06 Dewatering Foundations. Pumping from the interior of
 any foundation enclosure shall be performed in such a manner as to
 prevent the movement of water through the fresh concrete. No
 pumping will be permitted during the placing of concrete unless it is
 performed from a suitable sump separated from the concrete work.
 653
 
 801
 The pumping shall continue until the placement of the concrete is
 completed.
 801.07 Inspection. After each excavation is completed, the
 Contractor shall notify the Engineer. No concrete shall be placed
 until the Engineer has approved the depth of the excavation and the
 character of the foundation material.
 801.08 Backfill. Spaces outside the streambed excavated for and
 not occupied by abutments, piers, or other permanent work shall be
 backfilled and compacted to the general level of the surrounding
 ground. This work shall be performed immediately after completion
 of each unit of concrete work and after the forms have been removed
 and the concrete has reached its minimum required strength.
 Material used for backfill shall be of the same quality as that
 removed and shall be reasonably free from large or frozen lumps,
 wood, and other extraneous material.
 Piers located within the streambed need not be backfilled unless
 directed on the plans or as required by the Contractor's cofferdam
 removal procedure. Material for backfilling in the streambed shall
 be reasonably clean gravel or crushed rock.
 Backfill within the roadway embankment and immediately
 adjacent to bridge abutments, culverts, retaining walls, or other
 places inaccessible to rollers, shall be placed in approximately 6"
 (150 mm) horizontal layers, loose measurement, at near optimum
 moisture content, and compacted with mechanical equipment to
 95% of the maximum density as determined by AASHTO T 99.
 The specified density will not be required immediately adjacent to
 wingwalls of box culverts. The backfill in front of such units shall
 be placed first to prevent the possibility of forward movement.
 Special precautions shall be taken to prevent any wedging action
 against the concrete, and the slope bounding the excavation for
 abutments and wingwalls shall be stepped or roughened to prevent
 wedge action. Jetting of the fill behind abutments and wingwalls
 will not be permitted. Backfill for box culverts shall be placed
 equally on both sides of the culvert in 6″ (150 mm) lifts, loose
 measurement, and compacted as required above.
 Fill placed around piers shall be deposited uniformly on all sides
 to approximately the same elevation.
 
 654
 
 801
 No backfill shall be placed against abutments, retaining walls, or
 box culverts until the concrete has cured for at least 14 days or until
 test cylinders show that the minimum strength has been obtained.
 Backfilling of structural plate pipe and arches shall be according
 to Subsection 608.03(d).
 The Department will perform acceptance sampling and testing of
 compacted backfill material in accordance with Subsection 210.10 at
 the frequencies established in the Department’s Manual of Field
 Sampling and Testing Procedures.
 801.09 Classification of Excavation. Where excavation is not
 classified, all excavation will be grouped under the items
 Unclassified Excavation for Structures-Bridge or Unclassified
 Excavation for Structures-Roadway. These items shall include the
 removal of all materials encountered regardless of their nature or the
 manner in which they are removed.
 Where excavation is classified it shall be classed as Common
 Excavation for Structures-Bridge, Common Excavation for
 Structures-Roadway, Rock Excavation for Structures-Bridge, or
 Rock Excavation for Structures-Roadway, according to the
 following criteria:
 * Common Excavation for Structures-Bridge and Common
 Excavation for Structures-Roadway shall include the removal of
 all materials encountered, regardless of their nature, other than
 rock as defined in the items Rock Excavation for
 Structures-Bridge or Rock Excavation for Structures-Roadway.
 * Rock Excavation for Structures-Bridge and Rock
 Excavation for Structures-Roadway shall include the removal of
 such firm and compact materials as cannot be excavated without
 first being loosened or broken by blasting, sledging, or drilling.
 Water is not considered a material for the purposes of excavation.
 801.10 Method of Measurement. Work under this item will be
 measured by the cubic yard (cubic meter). The quantities shown on
 the plans will be considered as the final quantities and no further
 measurement will be made unless, in the opinion of the Engineer or
 upon evidence furnished by the Contractor, substantial variations
 exist between quantities shown on the plans and actual quantities
 due to changes in alignment or dimensions or to apparent errors.
 655
 
 801
 Where cofferdams are required, the quantities of excavation for
 bridges, as shown on the plans for the cofferdam location, shall be
 considered as final quantities and no further measurement will be
 made unless it becomes necessary to carry the footing or seal
 concrete below the elevation shown on the plans.
 Plan quantities and the adjustments thereof are based on vertical
 planes parallel to and 18" (450 mm) outside the neat lines of the
 footing or bottom slab and wings when in material other than rock,
 and vertical planes parallel to and 4" (100 mm) outside the footing
 or bottom slab and wings in rock for all foundations except seal
 foundations. Plan quantities and the adjustments thereof for seal
 foundations are based on vertical planes parallel to the neat line of
 seal.
 The quantities do not include the volume of any material that lies
 within the typical roadway cut section or within a channel change
 section.
 When it is necessary, as directed by the Engineer, to lower the
 bridge footing elevation below the elevation shown on the plans,
 such excavation will be measured and adjusted according to the
 following schedule:
 Depth of Bridge Footing
 Excavation Below Plan Grade
 Material between 0' and 3'
 (0 and 1 m) below elevation shown:
 Material between 3' and 7'
 (1 m and 2 m) below elevation shown:
 
 Adjustment
 Actual Volume
 Actual Volume + 50%
 
 Material deeper than 7'
 (2 m) below elevation shown:
 
 Actual Volume +
 negotiated adjustment
 factor.
 When undercutting for box culverts or box culvert extensions is
 directed by the Engineer, the Engineer may direct that the undercut
 section be backfilled with roadway excavation material, borrow, or
 Stone Backfill. If the Engineer directs that Stone Backfill be used
 for backfill, the volume of excavation for undercut will not be
 measured for payment, and the backfill will be measured and paid
 for as Stone Backfill in accordance with Section 207.
 If the Engineer directs that roadway excavation or borrow be
 used for backfill of the undercut section, the volume of excavation
 656
 
 801
 for the undercut will be measured by length, width, and average
 depth, and the computed volume will be paid for as Unclassified
 Excavation in accordance with Section 210. The backfill material
 will be included in the measurement and payment for the
 appropriate earthwork items under Section 210.
 Undercutting and backfilling with upgraded material for the
 Contractor’s convenience shall be at no cost to the Department.
 When the item Cofferdam is included in the Contract, each
 cofferdam will be measured by the unit.

 SECTION 802
 CONCRETE FOR STRUCTURES
 802.01 Description. This item shall consist of concrete in
 bridges, culverts, and miscellaneous structures, including the
 concrete portion of steel, timber, stone masonry, precast,
 prestressed, and composite structures, prepared and constructed
 according to these specifications and conforming to the lines,
 grades, dimensions, and designs shown on the plans. Concrete shall
 consist of approved portland cement, fine aggregate, coarse
 aggregate, water, and any approved chemical admixtures mixed in
 the proportions specified for the various classes of concrete.
 802.02 Materials. The materials used in concrete shall conform
 to the requirements specified below. No materials shall be used that
 contain foreign matter, frost, or lumps or crusts of hardened
 substances.
 (a) Cement.
 Unless otherwise specified, Portland cement
 conforming to the requirements of AASHTO M 85, Type I shall be
 furnished.
 
 658
 
 802
 One of the following blended cements may be used in lieu of
 Type I:
 •
 
 Portland-Pozzolan Cement, AASHTO M 240, Type IP (20%
 maximum)
 
 •
 
 Slag-Modified Portland Cement, AASHTO M 240, Type IS
 (25% maximum)
 
 Fly ash or slag cement shall not be substituted for blended cements.
 Cement shall be from sources that are listed on the Department’s
 Qualified Products List and that have executed a certification
 agreement with the Department.
 The total alkalis in the Portland cement (Na2O + 0.658 K2O)
 shall not exceed 0.60%. The total alkalis in the cementitious
 material (Portland cement, fly ash or ground granulated blastfurnace slag) shall not exceed 5 lbs./cu yd (3 kg/cu m). In lieu of
 using low alkali cement as specified, the Contractor may choose
 alternative testing of the proposed aggregates and cementitious
 materials as follows:
 Option 1 – Test the fine and coarse aggregate sources in
 accordance with AASHTO T 303. If the 14 day expansion ≤
 0.10%, the requirement for low-alkali cement is waived. If the
 14 day expansion is greater than 0.10%, further testing per
 Option 2 below is required using slag cement or fly ash.
 Option 2 – Test using the specific job materials and selected
 replacement level of supplemental cementitious materials (slag
 cement or fly ash) proposed for the project according to
 AASHTO T 303. If the 14 day expansion is ≤ 0.10%, the
 requirement for low-alkali cement is waived. If the 14 day
 expansion is greater than 0.10%, additional testing with a
 different cement, different supplemental cementitious material,
 and/or different replacement level is required.
 Type II (MH), Moderate Heat of Hydration, cement shall be used
 for Class B concrete. During the cool season of the year, the
 Engineer may approve the use of Type I cement in lieu of Type II
 (MH) cement for Class B concrete. Upon approval of the Engineer,
 Type III cement may be used in the manufacture of prestressed
 concrete products.
 Cement furnished in sacks shall weigh not less than 94 pounds
 (42.6 kg) per sack.
 659
 
 802
 The mixing or alternate use of cement from different
 manufacturing plants will not be permitted. The source of cement
 shall not be changed without the written approval of the Engineer.
 Cement placed in storage shall be suitably protected. Loss in quality
 occurring during the storage period will be cause for rejection. If
 the cement furnished produces erratic results under the field
 conditions incident to the placing of the concrete, or in regard to the
 strength of the finished product, or in the time of the initial or final
 set, the Contractor shall, without notice from the Engineer, cease the
 use of that source of cement.
 (b) Fine Aggregate. The fine aggregate shall consist of clean,
 hard, durable particles of natural sand or other approved inert
 material with similar characteristics.
 When determined necessary by visual observation, the amount of
 deleterious substances will be tested by laboratory methods and shall
 not exceed the following limits:
 Maximum Permissible

 All fine aggregate shall be free from injurious amounts of organic
 impurities.
 Aggregates shall be subjected to testing according to
 AASHTO T 21.
 Should AASHTO T 21 produce results that
 indicate that the sand may possibly contain injurious or damaging
 organic compounds, mortar strength test specimens shall be tested
 according to AASHTO T 71, such that the fine aggregate has a
 compressive strength of 95% of the standard sand samples at 7 days.
 
 660
 
 802
 Fine aggregate shall comply with the following grading
 requirements when tested according to AASHTO T 27:

 The fineness modulus of the fine aggregate shall not vary more
 than 20 points from the established value of the fine aggregate used
 in the mix design. In the event that the fineness modulus exceeds 20
 points, a new mix design will be required. When approved by the
 Engineer, the source of fine aggregate may be changed in all work
 except bridge superstructures, but the mixing or alternate use of
 different sources of fine aggregate will not be permitted.
 (c) Coarse Aggregate. The coarse aggregate shall consist of
 crushed stone or gravel.
 Crushed stone shall consist of clean and durable fragments of
 rock of uniform quality. The stone shall have a percent of wear of
 not more than 40 by Los Angeles Test (AASHTO T 96), and, when
 subjected to 5 cycles of the Soundness Test (Sodium Sulfate,
 AASHTO T 104) shall have a loss not to exceed 12%. Gravel shall
 consist of clean, hard, durable, uncoated aggregate, crushed or
 uncrushed, having a percent of wear of not more than 40 by Los
 Angeles Test (AASHTO T 96).
 When determined necessary by visual observation, the amount of
 deleterious substances will be tested by laboratory methods and will
 not exceed the following limits:

 The fineness modulus of the coarse aggregate shall not vary more
 than 20 points from the established value of the coarse aggregate
 used in the mix design. In the event that the fineness modulus
 exceeds 20 points, a new mix design will be required. When
 approved by the Engineer, the source of coarse aggregate may be
 changed in all work except bridge superstructures, but the mixing or
 alternate use of different sources of coarse aggregate will not be
 permitted.
 662
 
 802
 (d) Water. Water used in mixing or curing shall be clean and
 free from injurious amounts of oil, salts, or other deleterious
 substances, and shall not contain more than 1000 ppm of chlorides.
 Water from municipal supplies approved by the State Health
 Department will not require testing but water from other sources
 shall be sampled and tested before use in concrete.
 Tests will be made according to AASHTO T 26.
 Where the source of water is relatively shallow, it shall be
 maintained at such depth and the intake so enclosed as to exclude
 silt, mud, grass, or other foreign materials.
 (e) Admixtures. (1) General. Admixtures shall be used to
 improve certain characteristics of the concrete when specified on the
 plans or may be used when requested by the Contractor and
 approval is given by the Engineer. The Contractor's request shall be
 supported with the manufacturer's certified formulation of the
 proposed admixture and with sufficient evidence that the proposed
 admixture has given satisfactory results on other similar work.
 Permission to use the admixture may be withdrawn at any time by
 the Engineer when satisfactory results are not being obtained.
 Admixtures shall be approved by the Engineer. Admixtures shall
 be compatible with each other, as advised by the manufacturer. The
 admixture dosage rate range as recommended by the manufacturer
 shall be used. Should the dosage rate for any admixture not yield
 desirable characteristics in the concrete, the dosage of admixture
 used shall be based on test results obtained by trial batches.
 Admixtures shall be added to the mixing water by means of a
 mechanical dispenser that will accurately meter the additive
 throughout the mix water cycle. The dispenser shall be constructed
 and connected so that the amount of admixture entering the mixing
 water can be readily determined.
 (2) Air Entraining Agent. Air entraining agent shall comply
 with the requirements of AASHTO M 154 and be approved by the
 Engineer. Permission to use the agent may be withdrawn at any
 time by the Engineer when satisfactory results are not being
 obtained.
 (3) Retarding Agent. In order to permit the retarding of the set
 and extend the finishing time of concrete, a retarding agent shall be
 used when specified on the plans or may be used when permission
 663
 
 802
 for its use is requested by the Contractor and such permission is
 given by the Engineer. The retarding agent shall be a Type B or
 Type D admixture as defined in AASHTO M 194. Permission to
 use the agent may be withdrawn at any time by the Engineer when
 satisfactory results are not being obtained.
 The agent shall be free of intentionally added chlorides or
 chloride containing compounds as a functional ingredient. When
 air-entrained concrete is specified, the air-entraining agent and the
 retarding agent shall be so incorporated that the air content of the
 concrete shall fall within the percentage range stipulated in the
 specifications. When air-entrained concrete is not specified, the
 concrete to which the retarding agent has been added shall have air
 content not greater than 3 percent.
 No compensation will be made for furnishing and incorporating
 the agent in the mix. No additional compensation will be made for
 furnishing, placing, finishing, and curing the concrete involved.
 (4) Other Admixtures. The use of other admixtures will be
 considered by the Engineer on a case by case basis upon written
 request from the Contractor. When admixture(s) affecting the slump
 of the plastic concrete are approved by the Department, the
 Department may, upon request of the Contractor, modify the
 concrete slump requirements for that concrete utilizing this
 approved additive. If approved, the admixture used shall be
 furnished at no additional cost to the Department. Permission to use
 an admixture may be withdrawn at any time by the Engineer when
 satisfactory results are not being obtained.
 (f) Fly Ash. Fly ash used in concrete shall meet the requirements
 of AASHTO M 295, Class C or F. Mixing of Class C and Class F
 fly ashes will not be permitted.
 (g) Slag Cement. Slag cement used in concrete shall meet the
 requirements of AASHTO M 302, Grade 100 or higher.
 802.03 Handling and Storage of Materials. The handling and
 storage of concrete aggregates shall be such as to prevent
 segregation and contamination with foreign materials.
 Coarse and fine aggregates shall be separated by bulkheads or
 stored in separate stockpiles sufficiently removed from each other to
 prevent the material at the edges of the piles from becoming
 intermixed. Coarse aggregate stockpiles not confined by bulkheads
 664
 
 802
 or bins shall be built up in layers not to exceed 4' (1.2 m) in height
 and each layer shall be completely in place before beginning the
 next. Coning or building up of stockpiles by depositing material in
 one place will not be permitted. In order to control the gradation of
 the large aggregate for Class B concrete, it may be necessary that the
 Contractor stockpile the aggregate in two or more gradation ranges,
 blending by weight as required to obtain the specified gradation.
 There shall be adequate aggregate stockpiled to allow
 representative sampling sufficiently in advance of any placement to
 determine its acceptability, with the minimum amount being that
 required to adequately complete the planned placement.
 Cement shall be stored in suitable weather-proof buildings or
 silos that will protect the cement from dampness. Provision for
 storage shall be ample and the shipments of cement as received shall
 be separately stored in such a manner as to provide easy access for
 the identification and inspection of each shipment. Stored cement
 shall meet the test requirements at any time after storage when a retest is ordered by the Engineer.
 On small jobs, storage in the open may be permitted by written
 authorization from the Engineer, in which case a raised platform and
 ample waterproof covering shall be provided.
 802.04 Classes of Concrete. The appropriate class of concrete
 shall be used in the part of the structure as specified or where
 designated by the Engineer. The classes are as follows:
 Non Air-entrained
 Concrete
 
 Air-entrained
 Concrete
 
 Miscellaneous
 Concrete
 
 Class A
 Class B
 Class S
 Seal
 
 Class S(AE)
 
 Class M
 
 The following requirements shall govern unless otherwise shown
 on the plans:
 Class A concrete shall be used in wingwalls and miscellaneous
 construction.
 Class B concrete shall be used in mass concrete.
 Class S or S(AE) concrete shall be used in retaining walls, box
 culverts, footings, piers, bents, columns, abutments, and
 665
 
 802
 superstructures, including girders, beams, floor slabs, and parapet
 walls.
 Seal concrete shall be used for concrete deposited under water.
 Class M concrete shall be used in miscellaneous construction as
 specified in Sections 500, 600, and 700.
 Class S(AE) may be substituted for Class S. Class S(AE), Class
 S or paving concrete under Section 501 may be substituted for
 Class A. Acceptance criteria for strength, water/cement ratio, and
 slump shall be that of the Class specified. Different classes of
 concrete shall not be mixed in the same continuous placement.
 When Class M concrete is specified, the Contractor may use any
 commercially produced concrete mix or an approved Class A, S,
 S(AE), or paving concrete under Section 501. Unless otherwise
 specified, bagged commercial concrete mix may not be used for
 Class M concrete. For acceptance purposes, the minimum strength,
 maximum water/cement ratio, and maximum slump shall be that
 specified for Class A concrete.
 For small placements
 (approximately 1 cubic yard m [ 1 cu m] or less), the concrete may
 be mixed on site using a portable mixer. The size of each batch
 shall not exceed 80% of the manufacturer's rated capacity of the
 mixer. When mixing on site, and with the prior approval of the
 Engineer, the materials for each batch may be measured by volume
 by converting the mix design weights of each material to equivalent
 volumes.
 802.05 Mix Design. (a)General. The concrete mixture shall be
 proportioned to ensure a workable and durable concrete for the
 various classes, as specified in Table 802-1.
 The Engineer will not perform any pre-bid testing of materials. It
 will be the Contractor’s responsibility to locate acceptable material
 sources unless the sources are so noted in the plans or Special
 Provisions.
 (b) Mix Design by the Contractor. The proportions to be used
 in the mix for each class shall be determined by the Contractor using
 the absolute volume method. The Contractor may use the procedure
 provided in the ACI Standard 211.1 or Portland Cement Association
 “Design and Control of Concrete Mixtures”, modified to comply
 with the minimum cement content and maximum water/cement ratio
 specified for the class of concrete. Prior to the start of production of
 the concrete mixture, the Contractor shall submit test results and/or
 666
 
 802
 certifications for all materials and detailed mix design data to the
 Engineer for review. Aggregate, fly ash, and slag cement material
 properties used in the mix design shall be representative of the exact
 materials proposed for use. The testing source (commercial
 laboratory, qualified technician, AHTD provided data, etc.) and the
 date of the test shall be provided. The specific plant sources for the
 cement, fly ash or slag cement, and aggregates shall be shown on the
 mix design. The documentation submitted with the mix design shall
 specify which procedure was used and whether oven dry or
 saturated surface dry weights were used in the calculations. The
 mix design shall specify the quantity of each component of the mix,
 including all authorized additives. Acceptance of the mix design by
 the Engineer will be based on apparent conformity to the
 requirements shown in Table 802-1. If the mix design fails to
 produce acceptable results or if there is a change in the aggregates,
 fly ash, or cement being used, a new mix design will be required. It
 shall remain the Contractor’s responsibility during production to
 produce concrete conforming to the mix design and the minimum
 acceptance criteria specified. When requested by the Engineer, the
 Contractor shall submit samples of all materials for verification
 testing. Production shall not begin until the mix design is accepted
 by the Engineer.
 A mix design submitted for acceptance need not be prepared
 specifically for this project, but may be a previously accepted design
 that uses the same materials and meets the same design criteria.
 Mix designs accepted under this section will become the property
 of the Department and may be accepted for use on other projects, by
 other contractors, or by the Department.
 (c) Trial Batches. Mix designs proposed by the Contractor for
 all Class S(AE) and Class B concretes shall be tested by trial batches
 using the specific materials, including admixtures that are intended
 for use on the job. The Contractor shall prepare a plant batch of at
 least 2 cubic yards (1.5 cu m) or one-third the rated capacity of the
 mixer, whichever is greater. In lieu of the plant batch, the
 Contractor may prepare trial batches in a laboratory according to
 AASHTO T 126. These trial batches shall be accomplished by the
 Contractor under the observation of the Engineer. Sampling and
 testing will be conducted by the Engineer. These batches shall be
 sampled and tested for compliance with the specifications for slump,
 air content, and compressive strength.

 668
 
 802
 In lieu of the above procedure, the Contractor may retain an
 approved independent laboratory or a Registered Professional
 Engineer to prepare and test trial batches. In this case, trial batch
 information and laboratory results shall be furnished to the Engineer
 along with a statement certifying that the testing was performed
 according to the specifications.
 For Class S(AE) concrete the air-entrainment shall be
 accomplished by adding to the mixing water the proper amount of
 air-entraining agent in solution. The Contractor shall determine the
 amount of admixture required to produce air content within the
 range specified. The amount of air entraining agent shall be
 adjusted by the Contractor during production as necessary to keep
 the air content within the range specified. A mix design may be
 approved with respect to compressive strength when at least two test
 cylinders show the minimum required strength value at any age
 between 7 days and 28 days, inclusive.
 For Class B concrete, the mix design shall produce a workable
 and durable concrete meeting the minimum strength requirements
 specified in Table 802-1 and shall have a low heat of hydration
 when placed in large quantities. Fly ash conforming to AASHTO
 M295 may be substituted for a part of the Type II (MH) Cement not
 to exceed 120 pounds per cubic yard (70 kg/cu m) of concrete, and
 shall be included in the calculation of the water/cement ratio.
 Ninety-day test specimens will be required for Class B trial batches.
 For construction purposes, the sampling and testing will comply
 with standard procedures for sampling and testing.
 All trial batches required by these specifications or developed at
 the option of the Contractor shall be accomplished by the Contractor
 and shall be subject to the review and approval of the Engineer.
 Concrete from the trial batch may be used in miscellaneous
 construction subject to the approval of the Engineer and further
 provided that the minimum compressive strength specified for the
 construction in which the concrete is used is attained. If the required
 compressive strength is not attained, the Contractor shall remove the
 concrete and replace it with acceptable concrete at no cost to the
 Department.
 (d) Fly Ash. Fly ash may be used as a partial replacement for
 Type I cement, not exceeding 20% by weight, in all classes of
 concrete except Class B. Substitution shall be made at the rate of
 669
 
 802
 one pound (kilogram) of fly ash for each pound (kilogram) of
 cement replaced. The water/cement ratio shall be calculated using
 the total weight of both cement and fly ash. Fly ash in Class B
 concrete shall meet the requirements specified in Subsection
 802.05(c). Mixtures with fly ash shall meet the same requirements
 as mixtures without fly ash. Fly ash will not be allowed as a
 substitute for high early strength or blended cements. Class F fly
 ash shall not be used in bridge deck concrete placed between
 October 15 and April 1. When fly ash is used, the total weight of
 both cement and fly ash will be used in design calculations.
 When the Contractor elects to use fly ash as a partial replacement
 for the cement in Class S or Class S(AE) concrete, the proposed mix
 design shall be tested by the preparation and testing of trial batches
 according to Subsection 802.05(c). Trial batches will not be
 required for Class A concrete.
 (e) Slag Cement. Slag cement may be used as a partial
 replacement, not exceeding 25% by weight, for Type I cement, in all
 classes of concrete except high early strength and seal. Substitution
 shall be made at the rate of one pound (kilogram) of slag cement for
 each pound (kilogram) of cement replaced. slag cement will not be
 allowed with high early strength or blended cements.
 When the Contractor elects to use slag cement as a partial
 replacement for the cement in Class S or Class S(AE) concrete, the
 proposed mix design shall be tested using trial batches according to
 802.05(c). Trial batches will not be required for Class A concrete.
 802.06 Quality Control, Acceptance, and Adjustments in
 Payments. (a) Quality Control by the Contractor. The
 Contractor shall be responsible for quality control of materials
 during handling, blending, mixing, transporting, and placement
 operations, and for necessary adjustments in proportioning of
 materials used to produce the specified concrete.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for determining gradation
 and moisture content of fine and coarse aggregates used in the
 concrete mixture and for testing the mixture for air content, slump,
 and compressive strength. The Contractor shall determine the
 specific locations for samples and frequency of sampling for quality
 control, except the minimum frequency which is listed below for
 aggregate gradation shall be used. In addition, the Contractor shall
 be required to perform acceptance sampling and testing at specific
 670
 
 802
 times and/or locations specified by the Engineer according to
 Subsection 802.06(b).
 Test procedures shall be:
 Coarse and Fine Aggregates
 
 AASHTO T 27 (gradation)*
 AASHTO T 255 (moisture)
 
 Air Content
 
 AASHTO T 152
 
 Slump
 
 AASHTO T 119
 
 Compressive Strength**
 
 AASHTO T 22 (Test specimens for
 compressive strength determined by
 cylinders will be obtained according
 to AASHTO T 23.
 
 *1 test per 500 cubic yards (400 cubic meters) of mix
 (minimum), sampled from the stockpile. A minimum of one set of
 tests per bridge structure will be required.
 **A minimum of two (2) cylinders shall be cast and tested.
 Results will be based upon the average result from the two
 cylinders.
 An adequate supply of aggregate must be stockpiled to allow
 representative sampling in advance of any placement, with the
 minimum amount being that required to complete the day’s planned
 placement. The initial quality control test results for gradation must
 be completed and the test results submitted to the Engineer prior to
 the beginning of mix production of each class of concrete.
 Subsequent tests shall be taken and tested during production, and the
 test reports submitted to the Engineer by the end of the next business
 day after the sample is taken. Any failing gradation test result will
 result in halting production. The aggregate remaining in the
 stockpile will be resampled and tested by the Contractor and the
 Engineer. If the test results indicate that the aggregate is outside of
 the specification limits in Subsection 802.02, the stockpile shall
 either be corrected or replaced. Passing test reports must be
 submitted to the Engineer before work resumes.
 The Contractor shall furnish all personnel, equipment, and
 facilities necessary to perform the required sampling and testing.
 The Contractor’s facilities shall be separate from any Field
 Laboratory and/or Field Office furnished to the Department under
 the Contract. Quality control sampling and testing by the Contractor
 shall be performed in a qualified laboratory by a certified technician.
 671
 
 802
 Requirements for technician certification and laboratory
 qualification are contained in the Department’s Manual of Field
 Sampling and Testing Procedures. The Contractor shall maintain
 records of all samples taken and the results of all tests performed.
 Test reports shall be signed and copies made available to the
 Engineer if requested.
 The Contractor shall certify to the Engineer that the calibration of
 the concrete cylinder compression testing machine has been verified.
 This verification shall be performed in accordance with AASHTO
 T 22 and T 67 under any of the following conditions and
 documented in accordance with AASHTO T 67:
 1. After an elapsed interval of 18 months (maximum) since
 the previous calibration.
 2. After original installation of the machine or following
 relocation of the machine.
 3. Immediately after repairs or adjustments.
 4. Whenever there is a reason to doubt the accuracy of the
 results, without regard to the time interval since the last
 verification.
 If the Contractor desires additional compressive strength tests to
 be used for scheduling purposes or to determine the time for
 stripping forms or loading the structure, such tests will be performed
 by the Contractor at no cost to the Department.
 The Contractor shall provide an opportunity for the Engineer to
 observe all quality control sampling and testing procedures. The
 Contractor shall split samples with the Department when requested.
 The Contractor shall be required to make changes to the equipment
 and/or procedures if this testing or additional testing by the
 Department does not verify the Contractor’s test results.
 When individual gradation, slump, or air content measurements
 fall outside tolerance limits, the Contractor shall immediately make
 adjustments to bring the mixture within specified limits. If the
 Contractor fails to make proper adjustments, or if the mix is
 obviously defective, operations shall cease. Operations shall not
 resume until proper adjustments have been made.
 
 672
 
 802
 (b) Acceptance Testing. Acceptance sampling and testing by the
 Contractor will be based upon lots. The lot sizes shall be determined
 as follows:
 Slump, Air Content, and Compressive Strength: The
 standard lot size for acceptance of slump, air content, and
 compressive strength of concrete will be 400 cubic yards (300
 cubic meters) of mix, with each standard lot divided into four
 sublots of 100 cubic yards (75 cubic meters). In addition, for
 Class S(AE) concrete the maximum sublot size will be 100 cubic
 yards (75 cubic meters) or one deck pour, whichever is less.
 Partial lots, of any size, may be established by the Engineer at
 any time. A minimum of one set of tests per bridge structure will
 be required. The minimum frequency for acceptance of slump,
 air content, and compressive strength by the Contractor shall be
 one set of tests for each sublot of each class of concrete. The
 Contractor shall obtain and test one sample taken at random from
 each sublot. All samples of the mixture to be tested for air
 content, slump, and compressive strength shall be taken from one
 location. The Department will determine the location for each
 sample in the sublot by AHTD Test Method 465.
 Test methods for acceptance shall be the same as specified for
 quality control testing. Acceptance sampling and testing by the
 Contractor shall be performed in a qualified laboratory by a certified
 technician. Requirements for technician certification and laboratory
 qualification are contained in the Department’s Manual of Field
 Sampling and Testing Procedures. The Contractor shall provide an
 opportunity for the Engineer to observe all acceptance sampling and
 testing procedures.
 The Contractor’s acceptance sampling and testing procedures,
 equipment, and results will be subject to independent assurance
 sampling and testing conducted by the Department. Independent
 assurance sampling and testing will be conducted at the frequencies
 indicated in the Department’s Manual of Field Sampling and Testing
 Procedures. The Contractor shall be required to make changes to
 the equipment and/or procedures used if the results of the
 independent assurance tests do not correlate with the Contractor’s
 test results.
 Acceptance sampling and testing shall be accomplished in a
 timely manner. The Contractor shall maintain records of all samples
 taken and the results of all tests performed. Signed copies of these
 673
 
 802
 records shall be furnished to the Engineer for inclusion in the project
 files within one business day of the day that the tests are performed.
 The item of work being tested shall not be considered complete or
 accepted until test reports for all materials are submitted to the
 Engineer.
 The Department will obtain and test a minimum of one sample
 taken at random from each lot, including partial lots, to be used both
 for verification and for acceptance. The location of the lot sample
 will be determined by AHTD Test Method 465. Verification testing
 for compressive strength will be by casting and testing cylinders
 and/or drilling and testing cores. Verification testing will be
 conducted in accordance with Subsection 106.11 and the Manual of
 Field Sampling and Testing Procedures.
 The Department will perform all testing required for water,
 cement, fly ash, soundness and Los Angeles wear of aggregates.
 (c) Acceptance and Adjustments in Payments. Acceptance and
 adjustment in payments will be by lot. Acceptance of a standard lot
 will be based on the average results of the tests performed on the lot.
 The average result will include the sublot results of tests performed
 by the Contractor and the results of the test performed by the
 Department.
 In the event that the compressive strengths of the test specimens
 in a sublot are below the specified value in Table 802-1, the
 Department will conduct an investigation to determine the structural
 adequacy of the concrete. If this investigation determines that the
 concrete in question is acceptable, then price adjustments will be
 calculated according to Table 802-2. Table 802-2 lists test properties
 for acceptance, price reduction, and rejection limits.
 When test results for a lot fall within the limits shown in Table
 802-2 as “Compliance Limits”, the concrete shall be accepted with
 no price reduction. If test results for a lot for any single property
 falls within the limits shown as “Price Reduction Limits”, the failing
 material may be left in place at a reduced price. If test results for a
 lot for any single property falls within the limits shown as “Rejection
 Limits”, the failing material shall be removed and replaced at no cost
 to the Department. The percent the bid price shall be reduced for a
 lot not meeting the “Compliance Limits” for both Air Content and
 Compressive Strength will be determined by adding the price
 reduction percentages contained in Table 802-2.
 674
 
 802
 In the sublot containing the Department’s lot test, if the result of
 either the Contractor’s sublot test or the Department’s lot test falls
 outside the “Compliance Limits”, the two tests will be averaged and
 the average will be used to determine acceptance or rejection.
 At the Contractor’s option, additional testing for confirming price
 reductions or rejection due to compressive strength results may be
 performed by the Contractor at locations determined by the
 Department. In such cases three cores shall be taken in each sublot
 containing compressive strength results not in “Compliance Limits”.
 The compressive strength shall be determined by the average result
 of the cores. Cores shall be taken according to AASHTO T 24. The
 average of the three cores must meet or exceed applicable price
 reduction limits or rejection limits. Acceptance and pay adjustments
 will then be determined based on these results.
 When two consecutive lots or any three out of five consecutive
 lots fail to qualify for full payment, work will be stopped until
 corrective action is taken.
 Continuous production of concrete not qualifying for full payment
 will not be allowed.
 (d) Incentives. If the Contractor elects, on bridges over 150'
 (50 m) in length, an incentive payment for exceptional smoothness
 will be included in the pay schedule for Class S(AE) concrete if:
 •
 
 the bridge deck smoothness criteria below are met, and
 
 •
 
 no corrective grinding is required to achieve the incentive
 profile index values.
 
 The Contractor shall furnish a California-style profilograph
 complying with ASTM E 1274 or an automated lightweight
 profilometer complying with ASTM E 950, Class 1 and calibrated to
 the California-style profilograph scale and take a profile near the
 center of all continuous traffic lanes, including auxiliary lanes and
 ramps. The Engineer will verify the calibration of the profilograph
 as frequently as necessary to assure proper operation. In order to
 position the profilograph, the profile record may exclude 12.5' (4 m)
 of the deck at each end of the bridge if using a California-style
 profilograph. If using an automated lightweight profilometer, the
 profile record shall start and stop at the ends of the bridges at the
 joints. A blanking band of ±0.1" (±2.5 mm) will be used in the
 determination of the profile index.
 675
 
 802
 Contract unit price adjustments will be made according to the
 following schedule:

 The additional payment will be applied to the concrete in the
 bridge deck only. The calculation for the volume of concrete in
 cubic yards (cubic meters) will be based on the bridge length, bridge
 clear roadway width between parapets, and 7½" (190 mm) of deck
 thickness. The surface profile for payment will be based on the
 average profiles for all traffic lanes.
 The Contractor shall take all profiles required by this subsection,
 under the observation of the Engineer. All data obtained from the
 profiling operations will be furnished to the Engineer at the
 completion of the project.
 The incentive payment will be
 determined at the completion of the project and when all profile
 traces have been submitted to the Engineer for the project files.
 802.07 Measurement of Materials. Materials will be measured
 by weighing, except as otherwise specified or where other methods
 are specifically authorized by the Engineer. Aggregates shall be
 measured separately and accurately by weight. Measuring devices
 shall be operated in a manner that will consistently weigh the
 cement within ±1% and the individual aggregates within ±2% of the
 required weight. Measuring devices shall be so designed and plainly
 marked that the weights can be accurately and conveniently verified
 for the quantities of each component actually being used.
 Cement in standard packages (sack) need not be weighed, but
 bulk cement shall be weighed.
 676
 
 802
 The mixing water shall be measured by weight or by volume.
 The water measuring device shall be accurate to within ±1%.
 Scales shall be satisfactory to the Engineer and shall be
 inspected, adjusted, and certified according to Subsection 109.01(f),
 except that automatic ticket printers and automatic weighing
 systems will not be required.
 Where volumetric measurements are authorized by the Engineer
 for projects where the amount of concrete is small, the weight
 proportions shall be converted to equivalent volumetric proportions.
 In such cases, suitable allowance shall be made for variations in the
 moisture condition of the aggregate, including the bulking effect in
 the fine aggregate.
 Representative samples shall be taken and the moisture content
 determined for each kind of aggregate. When the aggregates contain
 more water than the quantity necessary to produce a saturated
 surface-dry condition, the batch weights for aggregates and water
 shall be adjusted accordingly.
 802.08 Mixing Concrete. Concrete shall be thoroughly mixed in
 a mixer of an approved size and type that will ensure a uniform
 distribution of the materials throughout the mass.
 The concrete shall be mixed only in the quantity required for
 immediate use. Concrete that has developed an initial set shall not
 be used. Re-tempering concrete will not be permitted.
 Concrete may be proportioned and mixed in a stationary central
 plant and hauled to the point of delivery in agitator trucks of
 approved type or in non-agitating equipment, when approved by the
 Engineer; proportioned in a stationary central plant and mixed in
 approved transit mix trucks enroute to the point of delivery; or
 mixed completely in transit mix trucks at the point of delivery,
 following the addition of mixing water.
 The Engineer shall be furnished the manufacturer's rated capacity
 of each mixer and agitator, along with the recommended speed of
 rotation for the various uses of each mixer. Truck mixers and
 agitators shall be equipped with means by which the number of
 revolutions of the drum, blades, or paddles may be readily verified.
 Mixers and agitators shall not be charged in excess of the
 manufacturer's rated capacity. Concrete shall be delivered and
 discharged from the truck mixer or agitator into the forms within 1½
 hours after the introduction of the mixing water to the cement. In
 677
 
 802
 hot weather, or under other conditions contributing to quick setting
 of the concrete, the maximum allowable time may be reduced by the
 Engineer. Each batch shall be accompanied by a time slip issued at
 the batch plant.
 Plants and transit mix trucks shall be equipped with adequate
 water storage and a device for accurately measuring and controlling
 the amount of water used in each batch. When a stationary mixer is
 used, a mechanical means shall be provided for automatically
 preventing the discharge of the mixer until the materials have been
 mixed for a period of not less than one minute.
 Truck mixers shall be capable of combining the ingredients of the
 concrete into a thoroughly mixed and uniform mass, and of
 discharging the concrete within the specified range of consistency.
 The concrete shall be mixed not less than 70 nor more than 100
 revolutions of the drum or blades at the rate of rotation specified by
 the manufacturer as the mixing speed. The pick-up and throw-over
 blades in the drum of all mixers shall be maintained in satisfactory
 condition to assure thoroughly mixed concrete.
 Agitators shall be capable of maintaining the concrete in a
 thoroughly mixed and uniform mass and of discharging the concrete
 within the specified range of consistency.
 When approved in writing by the Engineer, concrete may be
 transported in approved non-agitating equipment. Bodies of this
 equipment shall be smooth, watertight, metal containers equipped
 with gates that will permit control of the discharge of the concrete.
 Covers shall be provided for protection against the weather. The
 concrete shall be delivered in a thoroughly mixed and uniform mass
 and discharged within the specified range of consistency. Placement
 in forms shall be completed within 30 minutes after introduction of
 the mixing water to the cement.
 Concrete shall be mixed according to the mixer manufacturer's
 specifications in order to obtain an acceptable mass of concrete.
 During the period of mixing, the mixer shall operate at the
 manufacturer's recommended mixing speed. Additional mixing, if
 any, shall be at the speed designated by the manufacturer of the
 equipment as agitating speed.
 If additional mixing water is required to maintain the specified
 slump, and is added with the permission of the Engineer,
 approximately 20 revolutions of the mixer drum at mixing speed
 shall be required before discharge of any concrete.

 When a quality control sample for air content, taken within the
 allowable time limits for discharge of the concrete and prior to
 discharge for placement, shows an air content below the specified
 level by more than the allowable tolerance shown in Table 802-2,
 the Contractor may use additional air-entraining admixture to
 achieve the desired air content. The air-entraining agent and water
 shall be mixed in a separate container, and the mixed solution added
 to the truck mixer and mixed for a minimum of 30 revolutions at the
 mixing speed. A second air content test shall then be taken to
 determine if the air content is now within the allowable limits.
 The entire contents of the mixer, including wash water, shall be
 removed from the drum before the addition of materials for a
 succeeding batch.
 There shall be sufficient capacity and transporting equipment to
 ensure continuous concrete delivery at the rate required.
 If the concrete furnished produces erratic results relative to
 consistency, strength, or time of initial or final set, the Contractor
 shall cease the use of that concrete until corrections are made to
 ensure work of the specified quality.
 802.09 Handling and Placing Concrete. (a) General. The
 Contractor shall provide sufficient supervision, manpower,
 equipment, tools, and materials and shall assure proper production,
 delivery, placement, and finishing of the concrete for each
 placement according to the specifications. Unless otherwise
 specified, concrete shall be placed continuously between authorized
 construction and/or expansion joints, subject to the time limits and
 placement rates specified below.
 The time interval between batches of concrete shall not exceed 20
 minutes. Unless otherwise specified, the minimum placement rate
 shall be 20 cubic yards per hour (15 cu m/h).
 Any placement that does not produce results that conform to the
 specifications shall be repaired or replaced, as required, at no cost to
 the Department. Further placements of a similar nature and size will
 not be permitted until corrective measures have been taken to assure
 compliance with the specifications.
 The minimum placement rate shall not apply to concrete other
 than bridges, box culverts, and retaining walls, but the interval
 between batches shall not exceed 20 minutes.
 680
 
 802
 In preparation for the placing of concrete, construction debris and
 extraneous matter shall be removed from the interior of forms.
 Struts, stays, and braces, serving temporarily to hold the forms in
 correct shape and alignment pending the placing of concrete, shall
 be removed when the concrete placement has reached an elevation
 rendering their service unnecessary.
 (1) Conveying. Concrete shall be placed to avoid segregation of
 the materials and the displacement of the reinforcement. The use of
 long troughs, chutes, and pipes for conveying the concrete to the
 forms will be permitted only when authorized by the Engineer. In
 case an inferior quality of concrete is produced by the use of such
 conveyors, the Contractor shall, without notice from the Engineer,
 cease the use of that conveyor until such corrections in procedure
 are made to ensure work of the quality specified.
 Open troughs and chutes shall be of metal or metal lined. Where
 steep slopes are required, the chutes shall be equipped with baffles
 or be in short lengths that reverse the direction of movement.
 Aluminum chutes, troughs, and pipes shall not be used for
 depositing concrete.
 Chutes, troughs, and pipes shall be kept clean and free from
 coatings of hardened concrete by thoroughly flushing with water
 after each run. Water used for flushing shall be discharged clear of
 the structure.
 When placing operations involve dropping the concrete more
 than 5' (1.5 m), it shall be deposited through approved pipes. Walls
 of 10" (250 mm) thickness or less may be placed without the use of
 pipes, provided the concrete can be placed without segregation.
 (2) Placing. Concrete shall be placed in horizontal layers not
 more than 18" (0.5 m) thick except as hereinafter provided. When
 less than a complete layer is placed, it shall be terminated in a
 vertical bulkhead. Each layer shall be placed and consolidated
 before the preceding batch has taken initial set to prevent injury to
 the concrete and avoid surfaces of separation between the batches.
 Each layer shall be consolidated so as to avoid the formation of a
 construction joint with a preceding layer that has not taken initial
 set.
 Concrete in footings shall be placed in the dry unless natural
 conditions prohibit. In that case, concrete shall be placed according
 to Subsections 801.05 and/or 801.06, as appropriate. In order to
 681
 
 802
 separate water from the concrete, it will be permissible to utilize
 polyethylene sheeting or tarpaulins to maintain a physical barrier
 between the water and the concrete.
 When the placing of concrete is temporarily discontinued, the
 concrete, after becoming firm enough to retain its form, shall be
 cleaned of laitance and other objectionable material to a sufficient
 depth to expose sound concrete. To avoid visible joints as far as
 possible upon exposed faces, the top surface of the concrete adjacent
 to the forms shall be smoothed with a trowel. Where a "feather
 edge" might be produced at a construction joint, an inset form shall
 be used to produce an edge thickness of not less than 6" (150 mm).
 Immediately following the discontinuance of placing concrete,
 accumulations of mortar splashed upon the reinforcing steel and the
 surfaces of forms should be removed. Dried mortar chips and dust
 shall not be puddled into the concrete. If the accumulations are not
 removed prior to the concrete becoming set, care shall be exercised
 not to damage or break the concrete-steel bond at or near the surface
 of the concrete while cleaning reinforcing steel.
 After initial set of the concrete, the forms shall not be jarred and
 no strain shall be placed on the ends of projecting reinforcing bars.
 (3) Consolidating. All concrete, except seal concrete, during and
 immediately after depositing shall be thoroughly consolidated. This
 shall be accomplished by mechanical vibration subject to the
 following provisions:
 a.
 
 The vibration shall be internal unless special
 authorization of other methods is given by the
 Engineer.
 
 b.
 
 Vibrators shall be of a type and design approved by
 the Engineer. They shall be capable of transmitting
 vibration to the concrete at rated frequencies of not
 less than 4500 impulses per minute.
 
 c.
 
 The intensity of vibration shall be such as to visibly
 affect a mass of concrete over a radius of at least 18"
 (0.5 m).
 
 d.
 
 The Contractor shall provide a sufficient number of
 vibrators to properly compact each batch
 immediately after it is placed in the forms and shall
 have in reserve at all times sufficient vibratory
 682
 
 802
 equipment to guard against shut down of the work
 because of the failure of the equipment in operation.
 e.
 
 Vibrators shall be manipulated to thoroughly work
 the concrete around the reinforcement and embedded
 fixtures and into the corners and angles of the forms.
 Vibration shall be applied at the point of deposit and
 in the area of freshly deposited concrete. The
 vibrators shall be inserted and withdrawn out of the
 concrete slowly. The vibration shall be of sufficient
 duration and intensity to thoroughly consolidate the
 concrete, but shall not be continued so as to cause
 segregation. Vibration shall not be continued at any
 one point to the extent that localized areas of grout
 are formed.
 Application of vibrators shall be at points uniformly
 spaced and not farther apart than twice the radius
 over which the vibration is visibly effective.
 
 f.
 
 Vibration shall not be applied directly or through the
 reinforcement to sections or layers of concrete that
 have hardened to the degree that the concrete ceases
 to be plastic under vibration. It shall not be used to
 make concrete flow in the forms over distances so
 great as to cause segregation, and vibrators shall not
 be used to transport concrete in the forms. When
 epoxy coated reinforcing steel is used, the provisions
 of Subsection 804.05 relative to vibrators shall apply.
 
 g.
 
 Vibration shall be supplemented by such spading as
 is necessary to ensure smooth surfaces and dense
 concrete along form surfaces and in corners and
 locations impossible to reach with the vibrators.
 
 h.
 
 These provisions shall apply to precast products
 except that, if approved by the Engineer, the
 manufacturer's methods of vibration may be used.
 
 (b) Box Culverts. Concrete in walls and top slabs shall not be
 placed less than 24 hours after the concrete in previous placements
 has set.
 Provision shall be made for bonding the walls to the bottom slab
 or footing and the top slab to the walls by means of roughened
 683
 
 802
 longitudinal keys. Before concrete is placed in the walls or top
 slabs, the bottom slab, footing, or walls shall be thoroughly cleaned
 of extraneous material and the surface bond prepared according to
 Subsection 802.12. No horizontal construction joints will be
 allowed in any wall of a box culvert unless provided on the plans or
 approved by the Engineer. In the construction of box culverts 6'
 (1.8 m) or less in height, the walls and top slab may be constructed
 as a monolith.
 (c) Bridge Substructures. Concrete in columns shall not be
 placed less than 24 hours after the concrete in footings has been
 placed, and shall be placed in one continuous operation, unless
 otherwise directed. The concrete in the columns shall be allowed to
 set at least 24 hours before the caps are placed. When friction
 collars or column dowels are used to support cap forms, the concrete
 for the columns shall have a minimum compressive strength of 3500
 psi (24.0 MPa) before the concrete is placed for the cap.
 Unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer, no concrete shall be
 placed in the superstructure until the column forms have been
 stripped sufficiently to determine the character of the concrete in the
 columns.
 With proper handling to avoid damage to the concrete, and at the
 option of the Contractor, structural steel may be erected 48 hours
 after completion of the caps. Depositing of concrete in the deck or
 placing of precast concrete girders or deck units that will place dead
 load on the cap will not be permitted until the cap has been in place
 at least 7 days and has attained the minimum specified compressive
 strength.
 (d) Bridge Superstructures. For concrete in bridge deck slabs,
 when a longitudinal concrete strike-off is used, the rate of placement
 and consolidation shall be adequate to assure that no concrete will
 take its initial set before the entire placement is complete. Sufficient
 concrete shall be placed ahead of the strike-off to fully load the
 beam or girder prior to strike-off. When a transverse concrete
 strike-off is used, the rate of placement and consolidation shall be
 adequate to assure that no concrete will take its initial set closer than
 100' (30 m) behind the strike-off.
 Compliance with these
 requirements may require the use of a retarding agent.
 Concrete shall be deposited in a manner that will ensure uniform
 loading of the span. For continuous spans, the concrete placing
 684
 
 802
 sequence shall be shown on the plans. Concrete in slab spans shall
 be placed in one continuous operation for each span unless
 otherwise provided.
 Concrete in girders shall be deposited uniformly for the full
 length of the girder and brought up evenly in horizontal layers.
 Concrete in girder haunches less than 3' (1 m) in height shall be
 placed at the same time as that in the girder stem, and the columns
 or abutment tops shall be cut back to form seats for the haunches.
 Whenever any haunch or fillet has a vertical height of 3' (1 m) or
 more, the abutment or columns, the haunch, and the girder shall be
 placed in three successive stages; first, up to the lower side of the
 haunch; second, to the lower side of the girder; and third, to
 completion.
 For haunched continuous girders, the girder stem (including
 haunch) shall be placed to the top of stem. Where the size of the
 member is such that it cannot be made in one placement, vertical
 construction joints shall preferably be located within the area of
 contraflexure.
 Concrete in deck girder spans shall be placed in one continuous
 operation.
 Concrete in parapet or barrier walls, curbs, and sidewalks that are
 not placed monolithically with the deck slab shall not be placed less
 than 72 hours after the concrete for the deck slab of the entire simple
 span or the entire continuous unit has been placed, except when
 stage construction is specified.
 When stage construction is
 specified, the concrete in parapet or barrier walls, curbs, and
 sidewalks that are not placed monolithically with the deck shall not
 be placed less than 72 hours after the concrete for the portion of the
 deck slab required under that stage has been placed for the entire
 simple span or the entire continuous unit.
 (e) Concrete Placement Intervals. Use of the minimum time
 intervals and compressive strengths provided above relative to
 expediting subsequent concrete placements shall in no way relieve
 the Contractor of the responsibility for attaining the minimum
 compressive strengths for the class of concrete specified.
 802.10 Pumping. Concrete may be placed by pumping. The
 equipment for pumping shall be arranged and operated so that no
 vibrations result that might damage freshly placed concrete.
 685
 
 802
 Where concrete is conveyed and placed by mechanically applied
 pressure, the equipment shall be adequate in capacity for the work.
 The operation of the pump shall be such that a continuous stream of
 concrete without air pockets is produced. When pumping is
 completed, the concrete remaining in the pipe, if it is to be used,
 shall be ejected in such a manner that there will be no contamination
 of the concrete or separation of the ingredients.
 Samples of concrete for slump and air content tests will be
 obtained at the discharge end of the pipe.
 The use of aluminum pipe as a conveyance for the concrete will
 not be permitted.
 802.11 Depositing Concrete Under Water. Concrete shall not
 be deposited in water except when shown on the plans or with the
 approval of the Engineer. Concrete deposited in water shall be Seal
 Concrete.
 The supply of concrete shall be maintained at the rate necessary
 to raise the elevation over the entire seal by a minimum of 1' (0.3 m)
 per hour or an approved retarder shall be used as necessary for lesser
 placement rates.
 For parts of structures under water, seal concrete shall be placed
 continuously from start to finish. The surface of the concrete shall
 be kept as nearly horizontal as practicable. The Contractor shall
 provide equipment and personnel to sound the top of the seal in the
 presence of the Inspector in order to verify the location of the seal at
 all times. Previously placed seal concrete shall not have taken its
 initial set prior to the placement of adjacent concrete.
 Concrete shall be carefully placed by means of a tremie or other
 approved method. Still water shall be maintained at the point of
 deposit. Concrete shall be deposited in such a manner that the
 planned horizontal concrete flow shall be no more than 15' (4.5 m).
 This shall be accomplished by locating the points of deposit in such
 a manner as to provide for a maximum flow distance of 15' (4.5 m).
 A tremie shall consist of a tube having a diameter of not less than
 10" (250 mm), constructed in sections having flanged couplings
 fitted with gaskets and an approved foot valve. The tremie shall be
 supported so as to permit rapid lowering when necessary to retard or
 stop the flow of concrete. The discharge end shall be closed at the
 start of the work so as to prevent water entering the tube and shall be
 686
 
 802
 entirely sealed. The tremie tube shall be kept sufficiently full to
 prevent the loss of the concrete seal. When a batch is dumped into
 the tube, the flow of concrete shall be induced by slightly raising the
 discharged end, always keeping it in the deposited concrete. If at
 any time the seal is lost, the tremie shall be raised, the discharge end
 closed for a new start, and then lowered into position with the
 discharge end in the previously deposited concrete. Aluminum
 tremies will not be permitted.
 Dewatering may proceed when the seal concrete has been
 allowed to cure for a minimum of 72 hours at a water temperature
 above 45° F (7° C). All laitance or other unsatisfactory materials
 shall be removed from the exposed surfaces that are to support other
 structural loads.
 Prior to the placement, the Contractor shall advise the Engineer
 of his methods for complying with these requirements.
 802.12 Construction Joints. (a) General. Construction joints
 shall be made only where located on plans or shown in the
 placement schedule, unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.
 Before depositing new concrete on or against concrete that has
 hardened, the forms shall be re-tightened.
 The placing of concrete shall be carried continuously from joint
 to joint. The face edges of all joints that are exposed to view shall
 be carefully finished true to line and elevation.
 If not detailed on the plans, or in the case of emergency,
 construction joints shall be placed as directed by the Engineer.
 Shear keys or inclined reinforcement shall be used where necessary
 to transmit shear or bond the two sections together. When shear
 keys or inclined reinforcement is not provided, the concrete shall be
 roughened as directed.
 (b) Bonding. The surface of the hardened concrete shall be
 roughened in a manner that will not leave loosened particles of
 aggregates or damaged concrete at the surface. It shall be
 thoroughly cleaned of foreign matter and laitance and saturated with
 water.
 802.13 Falsework.
 Details for each unit of falsework
 construction for bridge span and overhang support systems,
 complete with dimensions and kind and condition of materials, shall
 be submitted to the Engineer prior to construction for informational
 687
 
 802
 and record purposes. These details shall be approved by a
 Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify that the
 adequacy of all components has been verified. File copies of all
 design calculations shall be maintained by the Contractor until final
 acceptance of the project. Construction of the falsework shall be
 according to the details submitted to the Engineer for informational
 purposes. The Contractor shall be responsible for the results
 obtained by the use of the falsework design.
 For designing falsework, a weight of 150 pounds per cubic foot
 (2400 kg/cu m) shall be assumed for fresh concrete. All falsework
 shall be designed and constructed to provide the necessary rigidity
 and to support the loads without appreciable settlement or
 deformation. Falsework shall be set to give the finished structure
 the camber specified.
 Falsework that cannot be founded on a satisfactory footing shall
 be supported on piling which shall be spaced, driven, and removed
 as specified in the Contractor's falsework details.
 The use of transverse welds greater than 1″ (25 mm) in length
 used for attachment of hanger brackets, nut plates, or other
 falsework support devices to the structural steel shall be approved
 by the Bridge Engineer prior to construction. The use of welds for
 attaching screed rail supports larger than 1″ (25 mm) diameter to the
 top flange of the structural steel shall be approved by the Bridge
 Engineer prior to construction.
 All temporary field welds on structural steel shall be performed
 by a certified welder using low-hydrogen electrodes in accordance
 with Subsection 807.26 and the ANSI/AASHTO/AWS D1.5, Bridge
 Welding Code. Unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer,
 temporary welds shall be removed by grinding the weld flush.
 802.14 Forms. (a) Standard Forms. Forms shall be mortartight and of sufficient rigidity to prevent distortion due to the
 pressure of the concrete and other loads incident to the construction
 operations. Forms shall be constructed and maintained so as to
 prevent warping and the opening of joints due to shrinkage of the
 lumber.
 The forms shall be substantial and unyielding and shall be so
 designed that the finished concrete will conform to the proper
 dimensions and contours. The design of the forms shall take into
 account the effect of vibration of concrete as it is placed.
 688
 
 802
 Forms for exposed surfaces shall be made of dressed lumber or
 plywood of uniform thickness, steel, or other approved materials
 that will provide a smooth surface, and shall be mortar-tight. Forms
 shall have 3/4” (20 mm) fillet at all sharp corners unless otherwise
 directed. In the case of projections, such as girders and copings,
 forms shall be given a bevel or draft to ensure easy removal.
 Metal snap-ties within the forms shall be so constructed as to
 permit their removal to a depth of at least 1" (25 mm) from the face
 of the concrete. Fittings for metal snap-ties shall be of such design
 that, upon removal, the cavities that are left will be of the smallest
 possible size.
 Metal inserts or anchorages within the forms shall be so
 constructed as to permit their removal to a depth of at least 1"
 (25 mm) from the face of the concrete or be covered by being
 embedded a minimum of 1" (25 mm) in the concrete. In case
 ordinary wire ties are permitted, all wires, upon removal of the
 forms, shall be cut back at least 1/4" (6 mm) from the face of the
 concrete.
 All cavities shall be filled with cement mortar and the surface left
 sound, smooth, even, and uniform in color.
 Forms shall be set and maintained true to the line designated until
 the concrete is sufficiently hardened. Before depositing new
 concrete on or against concrete that has hardened, the forms shall be
 re-tightened. Forms shall remain in place for the periods specified
 in Subsection 802.15. When forms appear to be unsatisfactory in
 any way, either before or during the placing of concrete, the
 Engineer shall order the work stopped until the defects have been
 corrected.
 The shape, strength, rigidity, watertightness, and surface
 smoothness of re-used forms shall be maintained at all times. Any
 warped or bulged lumber must be re-sized before being re-used.
 For narrow walls and columns, where the bottom of the module is
 inaccessible, the lower portions of the forms shall be so constructed
 as to facilitate cleaning out of extraneous material immediately
 before placing the concrete.
 Forms shall be cleaned before being set to line and grade and
 shall be oiled prior to placing reinforcing steel in the vicinity of the
 689
 
 802
 forms. Materials or methods used in oiling the forms shall not result
 in the discoloration of the concrete.
 In lieu of the conventional stationary forms, concrete parapet rail
 may be constructed by using an extrusion machine or other
 equipment specifically designed for constructing cast-in-place
 concrete parapet rail, provided the finished barrier is true to line and
 grade and the concrete is properly consolidated.
 (b) Permanent Steel Deck Forms. An approved type of
 galvanized steel form, complying with the requirements shown on
 the plans and these specifications, may be used as an alternate to
 conventional removable forms for forming the bridge deck between
 the exterior beams or girders. These forms shall be designed to
 provide not less than the minimum concrete cover shown on the
 plans for all reinforcing bars in the bottom of the slabs. The
 effective design depth of slab shall be maintained over the entire
 area of the deck. Provision shall be made to provide encasement of
 top flanges of beams or girders in compression except where shear
 connectors are provided.
 Detailed plans of proposed permanent steel deck forms shall be
 submitted to and approved by the Engineer before work of forming
 the bridge deck is started. The approval of the Contractor's plans
 shall not be considered as relieving the Contractor of any
 responsibility for the results obtained by the use of these approved
 plans. Construction shall be according to the approved plans.
 All material and elements of the permanent steel deck form units
 shall be fabricated from steel conforming to ASTM A653/A653M,
 Structural Steel (SS), Grades 33,37,40,50 Class 1 or 2, or 80, having
 a coating class of G165 [Structural Steel(SS), Grades 230, 255, 275,
 340 Class 1 or 2, or 550, having a coating class of Z350]. Thickness
 and grade of form sheets and form supports shall be as designated
 on the shop drawings. In no case shall thicknesses be less than
 22 gage for sheets and 16 gage for form supports. The Contractor
 shall provide a manufacturer's certification indicating compliance
 with the above requirements and Section 106.
 Permanent steel forms shall be designed on the basis of the dead
 load of the form, reinforcement, and the plastic concrete, plus 50 psf
 (245 kg/sq m) for construction loads. Unit working stresses shall be
 according to the standard specifications for construction loads and
 the unit stress in the steel sheet shall be not more than 0.725 of the
 690
 
 802
 specified minimum yield strength of the material furnished, but not
 to exceed 36,000 psi (250 MPa). Maximum deflection shall be
 calculated using the weight of plastic concrete, reinforcement, and
 forms, or 120 psf (585 kg/sq m), whichever is greater. Maximum
 deflection shall not exceed 1/180 of the form span or 1/2" (12 mm),
 whichever is less. The form span for design and deflection shall be
 the clear distance between supports plus 2" (50 mm), but not less
 than the clear distance between the flanges of the supporting beams
 less 4" (100 mm) measured parallel to the form flutes.
 Physical design properties shall be computed according to
 requirements of the latest edition of AISI Specifications for the
 Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members.
 All reinforcement shall have a minimum concrete cover of 1"
 (25 mm). Bars in the bottom layer of the main reinforcement shall
 be approximately centered over the valleys of the forms when
 necessary to achieve the minimum 1" (25 mm) concrete cover. The
 distance from the top of the slab to the bottom layer of main slab
 reinforcement shall be not less than that shown on the plans.
 Permanent steel forms used in panels where longitudinal slab
 construction joints are located between stringers must provide
 adequate structural capacity without excessive deflections.
 Adequate external support of forms at the joint must be provided to
 assure that the forms do not separate from the hardened concrete.
 All forms shall be installed according to detailed fabrication
 plans submitted to the Engineer for approval. The fabrication plans
 shall clearly indicate locations and methods of attachment where the
 forms are supported by steel beam flanges subject to tensile stresses
 and without shear connectors.
 Form sheets shall not be permitted to rest directly on the top of
 the stringer or floor beam flanges. Sheets shall be securely fastened
 to form supports and shall have a minimum bearing length of 1"
 (25 mm) at each end. Form supports shall be placed in direct
 contact with the flange of stringer or floor beam. All attachments
 shall be made by welds, bolts, clips, or other approved means.
 However, welding of form supports to flanges of steels other than
 AASHTO M 270, Grades 36 (250), 50 (345), or 50W (345W) of a
 weldable grade, and to those portions of a flange subject to tensile
 stresses will not be permitted except as provided for in the plans.
 Welding shall be accomplished by certified welders and according
 691
 
 802
 to Subsection 807.26 except that 1/8" (3 mm) fillet welds will be
 permitted.
 Provisions shall be made to keep the panels at an acceptable
 temperature before placement of concrete.
 Calcium Chloride or any other admixture containing chloride
 salts shall not be used in the concrete placed on permanent steel
 deck forms.
 After the deck concrete has been placed for a minimum of 2 days,
 the following inspection procedure shall be followed:
 The forms shall be tested for soundness of the concrete and
 bonding of the forms to the concrete by striking the form a sharp
 blow with a geologist hammer. As a minimum, the forms shall be
 struck at 10' (3 m) intervals parallel to and 6" (150 mm) from the
 edge of the steel beam, and at 10' (3 m) intervals along the centerline
 of each bay between the beams in an X pattern with those along the
 beams, and at random points on a semicircle or circle, as applicable,
 with approximately 2' (0.5 m) radius from the above points. They
 shall be struck in other places as directed by the Engineer to define
 any suspicious or defective area. Areas where efflorescence is
 evident shall be thoroughly investigated.
 The Contractor shall furnish all facilities such as ladders,
 scaffolding, etc., that will provide for a thorough inspection of the
 forms.
 The striking of the forms shall be accomplished in such a manner
 and at a time that the sound is clearly audible. Properly bonded
 sheets attached to sound concrete will emit a clear ring when struck
 a sharp blow with a hammer. Honeycomb concrete and/or
 unbonded areas will give a different sound such as a thud or clatter.
 The forms shall be removed full width between beams wherever the
 Engineer suspects that honeycomb or unbonded areas exist so that
 the Engineer may make a visual examination of the concrete surface.
 Any defective concrete shall be repaired to match the adjacent
 concrete to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 The amount of sounding and form removal may be reduced, at
 the Engineer's discretion, after a substantial amount of slab has been
 constructed and inspected, if the Contractor's methods of
 construction and the results of the inspections as outlined above
 indicate that sound concrete is being obtained throughout.
 
 692
 
 802
 If the Contractor varies his procedures significantly, the initial
 inspection procedure shall be used to verify that the new conditions
 are yielding desirable results.
 Any forms that must be removed because of unsatisfactory test
 results shall be removed by a metal saw or air-carbon-arc gouging
 with minimum damage to the concrete. The cut in forms parallel to
 the corrugations shall be located in a non-horizontal lap section of
 the corrugation. The cuts parallel to the beam shall be through the
 supporting angles taking care not to damage the structural steel
 beams.
 All concrete that is found defective or is damaged in removing a
 section of the form for inspection shall be repaired to match the
 adjacent concrete in section and color. All repair work shall be
 completed to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
 Payment for forms will be made and fully covered under the unit
 price bid for superstructure concrete. No direct or additional
 payment of any kind will be made because of the use of these forms.
 Payment will be made for Class S(AE) Concrete in place in the
 bridge decks on the basis of the thickness specified on the plans, not
 including any excess thickness used and not including any concrete
 in portions of haunches that may be omitted because of the use of
 these forms.
 802.15 Removal of Falsework and Forms. In the determination
 of the time for the removal of falsework and forms and the
 discontinuance of heating, consideration shall be given to the
 location and character of the structure, the weather and other
 conditions influencing the setting of the concrete, and the materials
 used in the mix.
 Removal of falsework and forms shall be according to the
 following schedule:
 Minimum
 Strength
 Item
 Time
 Requirement
 Bottom Forms for Deck Slabs,
 Beams, and Caps
 7 Days
 Min. Spec.
 Top Slabs of RC Box Culverts
 7 Days
 80% Spec.
 Forms for Columns and
 Vertical Walls
 24 Hours
 N/A
 Side Forms for Footings,
 Beams, and Caps
 12 Hours
 N/A
 Side Forms for Parapets, Median
 Barriers, and Curb Faces
 6 Hours
 N/A
 693
 
 802
 Both time and strength requirements must be met before removal
 of forms and/or falsework begins.
 Forms on surfaces that will require a Class 2 finish according to
 Subsection 802.19 shall be removed at the earliest time permitted
 under these specifications in order to begin finishing operations.
 Forms and their supports shall not be removed without the
 approval of the Engineer. Supports shall be removed in such a
 manner as to permit the concrete to uniformly and gradually take the
 stresses due to its own weight. Methods of form removal likely to
 cause overstressing of or damage to the concrete shall not be used.
 802.16 Weather and Temperature Limitations and Protection
 of Concrete. When the ambient temperature at the placement site is
 85° F (29° C) and rising, an approved retarding agent shall be
 required in all concrete used in bridge superstructures. A retarding
 agent will not be required in concrete used for bridge deck curb,
 parapet, railing, posts, sidewalks, or median treatment provided they
 are not placed monolithically with the deck itself.
 When the internal temperature of the plastic concrete in bridge
 decks reaches 85° F (29° C), the Contractor shall take the necessary
 precautions to ensure that the temperature of succeeding batches
 does not exceed 90° F (32° C). Concrete batches with temperatures
 in excess of 90° F (32° C) will be rejected. The method used to
 control the concrete temperature shall be approved in writing by the
 Engineer. The temperature of the plastic concrete shall be
 determined immediately prior to its being deposited in the forms by
 inserting a thermometer to a depth consistent with the capabilities of
 the thermometer being used to obtain a true reading. Prior to
 beginning placement, the Contractor shall ensure that sufficient
 materials, labor, and equipment are available during placement to
 implement the previously approved cooling process.
 The maximum mix temperature for all Class B concrete at the
 time of placement shall be 75° F (24° C). This requirement will be
 strictly adhered to and any concrete delivered to the job site that
 does not meet this provision will be rejected. The maximum
 differential between the internal concrete temperature and the
 concrete surface temperature shall not exceed 36° F (20° C). The
 Contractor shall devise a method for monitoring the temperature
 differential for at least seven days and shall have the method
 approved by the Engineer before the concrete is placed. The internal
 694
 
 802
 temperature shall be measured as nearly as practicable to the center
 of mass of the pour. Methods used to meet these requirements shall
 be submitted to the Engineer for approval. Methods that may be
 used to meet this provision include using ice in the mixing water,
 storing cement and aggregates in cool or shaded locations, watering
 down of coarse aggregates, installation of cooling pipes in the
 concrete, and use of insulation (tenting, quilts, or sand on
 polyethylene sheeting). Cooling by watering of fine aggregates will
 not be allowed.
 No concrete shall be placed unless the temperature of the
 concrete is more than 50° F (10° C) when placed. If heating of the
 ingredients is necessary to meet this criterion, it shall be
 accomplished by a method such as dry heat or steam and not by
 direct flame. Water shall not be heated to more than 180° F (82° C),
 and shall be combined with the aggregate before the addition of
 cement. Frozen aggregates may not be used.
 After concrete is placed, it shall be protected by insulated forms,
 blankets, enclosing and heating, and/or any other method approved
 by the Engineer that will maintain the temperature adjacent to the
 concrete at a minimum of 50° F (10° C) for at least 7 days. For
 concrete other than bridges, box culverts, and retaining walls, the
 requirement for maintaining the temperature at or above 50° F
 (10° C) shall not apply, but the concrete shall be protected and/or
 heated, as necessary, to prevent freezing for a period of at least 7
 days.
 For Class B concrete, forms shall remain in place 4 days after
 placing any time the temperature is below 40° F (4° C) or forecast to
 drop below 40° F (4° C). In addition, exposed top surfaces of the
 concrete shall be protected with an insulated blanket. The surface of
 the concrete shall not be saturated when it is exposed to freezing air
 temperatures.
 The Contractor shall have available and ready for immediate use
 sufficient materials and equipment for maintaining the temperature
 of the concrete as required above.
 Concrete that has been frozen or damaged due to weather
 conditions shall be removed and replaced by the Contractor at no
 cost to the Department.

 802
 802.17 Curing Concrete for Structures. (a) Materials.
 Materials used in curing concrete shall conform to one of the
 following types:
 (1) Burlap-polyethylene sheeting shall meet the requirements of
 ASTM C171.
 (2) Polyethylene sheeting shall have a minimum thickness of 4
 mils (0.10 mm).
 (3) Copolymer/synthetic blanket shall meet the performance
 requirements of ASTM C171. Copolymer/synthetic blankets shall
 be a composite of a copolymer membrane material coated over a
 layer of absorbent nonwoven synthetic fabric weighing at least 6
 ounces per square yard (200 g/sq m), uniform in appearance, and
 free from visible defects.
 (4) Other approved sheeting materials shall meet the performance
 requirements of ASTM C171.
 (5) Membrane curing compound shall meet the requirements of
 ASTM C309, Type 1-D or Type 2.
 (b) Application. The exposed concrete, immediately after
 finishing, shall be covered with one of the curing materials listed
 above and shall be kept continuously and thoroughly wet for a
 period of not less than 7 days after the concrete is placed.
 Membrane curing does not require the application of additional
 moisture, except as required for bridge roadway surfaces.
 All Class B concrete shall be cured by free moisture. Water
 curing shall be provided for all exposed surfaces for a period of 14
 days.
 Membrane curing compound shall not be used on surfaces
 requiring a Class 2 finish.
 Clear membrane curing compound shall be used as an interim
 cure for concrete bridge roadway surfaces and shall be applied
 immediately after final finishing. Final curing of bridge decks shall
 be by mats or blankets and shall be begun immediately after
 completing the surface test specified in Subsection 802.20(c). The
 mats or blankets shall be kept continuously and thoroughly wet for a
 period of 7 days after the concrete is placed.
 When an extrusion machine is used for concrete parapet railing,
 curing shall be performed as specified herein and shall be
 696
 
 802
 accomplished as soon after extrusion as possible. Clear curing
 compound shall be used as an interim cure until such time as the
 parapet rail will support the curing methods specified.
 When membrane curing is used, the exposed concrete shall be
 thoroughly sealed by applying the membrane curing solution
 immediately after the free water has left the surface. The concrete
 inside the forms shall be sealed immediately after the forms are
 removed and necessary finishing has been done. For uniform
 application in the field on vertical concrete surfaces, the specified
 rate of application may be achieved by two coats applied at an
 interval of approximately 1 hour.
 The Contractor shall provide satisfactory equipment and means to
 properly control and assure the direct application of the curing
 solution on the concrete surface so as to result in a uniform coverage
 at the rate of 1 gallon per 125 square feet (1 L/3 sq m) of area.
 If rain falls on the newly coated concrete before the film has
 dried sufficiently to resist damage, or if the film is damaged in any
 other manner, a new coat of the solution shall be applied to the
 affected portions equal in curing value to that specified above.
 802.18 Expansion and Fixed Joints. Joints shall be constructed
 according to the details shown on the plans.
 (a) Open Joints. Open joints shall be placed in the locations
 shown on the plans and shall be constructed by the insertion and
 subsequent removal of a wood strip, metal plate, or other approved
 material. The insertion and removal of the template shall be
 accomplished without chipping or breaking the corners of the
 concrete. Reinforcement shall not extend across an open joint
 unless specified on the plans.
 (b) Filled Joints. Filled expansion joints shall be constructed
 similar to open joints. When premolded types are specified, the
 filler shall be in the correct position when the concrete on the second
 side of the joint is placed. A joint sealer is required in addition to
 the joint filler. The cavity for the sealer shall be formed by the
 insertion and subsequent removal of a wood strip, metal plate, or
 other approved material. When required, adequate water stops of

 802.19 Finishing Concrete Surfaces. (a) General.
 finishes shall be classified as follows:
 Class 1.
 Class 2.
 Class 3.
 Class 4.
 Class 5.
 Class 6.
 Class 7.
 
 Surface
 
 Ordinary Surface Finish.
 Rubbed Finish.
 Textured Coating Finish.
 Exposed Aggregate Finish.
 Tined Bridge Roadway Surface Finish.
 Broomed Finish.
 Grooved Bridge Roadway Surface Finish.
 
 All concrete shall be given a Class 1, Ordinary Surface Finish. In
 addition, if further finishing is required, such other types of finish
 will be as specified herein.
 Payment for Class 1 through Class 6 finishes will be considered a
 part of the applicable item of concrete used. Measurement and
 payment for Class 7 finish will be made according to
 Subsections 802.24 and 802.25.
 Sidewalks shall be given a Class 6 finish.
 Curbs shall be given a Class 2 or Class 6 finish.
 Bridge roadway surfaces shall be given a Class 5 finish unless
 Class 7 finish is specified on the plans.
 The following surfaces shall be given a Class 2 finish except
 when a Class 3 finish is specified on the plans:
 All Structures. Exposed surfaces of retaining walls, surfaces
 of concrete rails, rail posts, rail end posts, rail bases, and
 parapets, including the outside face.
 Bridges Over Public Roads. Surfaces above finished ground
 of piers, columns, abutments, and retaining walls; the outside
 vertical surfaces of parapets, slabs, and girders; and the
 underneath side of the overhang outside the exterior beam.
 At the option of the Contractor, a Class 3 finish may be used on
 all surfaces requiring a Class 2 finish provided the same class of
 finish is used on the entire structure.
 (b) The various classes of surface finish are defined as follows:
 700
 
 802
 (1) Class 1, Ordinary Surface Finish. Immediately following
 the removal of forms, fins and irregular projections shall be removed
 from all surfaces except from those that are not to be exposed or are
 not to be waterproofed. On all surfaces, the cavities produced by
 form ties and all other holes, broken corners or edges, and other
 defects shall be thoroughly cleaned, and after having been
 thoroughly saturated with water, shall be carefully pointed and trued
 with a mortar of cement and fine aggregate mixed in the proportion
 of 1:2. Mortar used in pointing shall be not more than 1 hour old. If
 required, the concrete shall then be rubbed or sprayed and cured as
 specified under Subsection 802.17. Construction and expansion
 joints in the completed work shall be left carefully tooled and free of
 mortar and concrete. The joint filler shall be left exposed for its full
 length with clean and true edges.
 The resulting surfaces shall be true and uniform. Repaired
 surfaces, the appearance of which is not satisfactory to the Engineer,
 shall be rubbed as specified under Class 2 finish.
 Exposed surfaces not protected by forms shall be struck off with
 a straightedge and finished with a float to a true and even surface.
 The use of additional mortar to provide a plastered or grout finish
 will not be permitted.
 The tops of caps in the area of the bridge seat shall be finished
 with a steel trowel or by grinding to a smooth finish and true slope
 at the proper elevation.
 (2) Class 2, Rubbed Finish. After removal of forms, the rubbing
 of concrete shall be started as soon as its condition will permit.
 Immediately before starting this work the concrete shall be
 thoroughly saturated with water. Sufficient time shall have elapsed
 before the wetting down to allow the mortar used in the pointing of
 rod holes and defects to thoroughly set. Surfaces to be finished shall
 be rubbed with a medium coarse carborundum stone, using a small
 amount of mortar on its face. The mortar shall be composed of
 cement and fine sand mixed in proportions used in the concrete
 being finished. Rubbing shall be continued until form marks,
 projections, and irregularities have been removed, voids filled, and a
 uniform surface has been obtained. The paste produced by this
 rubbing shall be left in place at this time.
 After concrete above the surface being treated has been cast, the
 final finish shall be obtained by rubbing with a fine carborundum
 701
 
 802
 stone and water. This rubbing shall be continued until the entire
 surface is of a smooth texture and uniform color.
 After the final rubbing is completed and the surface has dried, it
 shall be rubbed with burlap to remove loose powder and shall be left
 free from all unsound patches, paste, powder, and objectionable
 marks.
 (3) Class 3, Textured Coating Finish. The material furnished
 for textured coating finish shall be a commercial paint type texturing
 product produced specifically for this purpose, and shall consist of a
 synthetic non-alkyd resin containing mica, perlite, nonbiodegradable fibers, and durable tinting pigments. The material
 shall be listed on the QPL.
 Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, the color of the
 textured coating finish shall be concrete gray, equal or close to
 Shade 36622 of the Federal Color Standard 595 B.
 Surfaces to be coated shall be free from efflorescence, laitance,
 flaking, coatings, dirt, oil, and other foreign substances. The finish
 shall not be applied over surfaces cured with membrane curing
 compound until 30 days has elapsed from application of the
 membrane; however, the time may be reduced if the curing
 membrane is removed. Prior to application of the finish, the
 surfaces shall be free of moisture, as determined by sight and touch,
 and in a condition consistent with the manufacturer's published
 recommendations.
 The finish shall be applied at the rate recommended by the
 manufacturer and as approved by the Engineer. The finish shall be
 applied with heavy duty spray equipment capable of maintaining a
 constant pressure as necessary for proper application. When
 recommended by the manufacturer and approved by the Engineer,
 the finish may be applied with rollers and/or brushes.
 The completed finish shall be tightly bonded to the structure and
 shall present a uniform appearance and texture equal to or better
 than that required for rubbed finish. If necessary, an additional coat
 or coats shall be applied to produce the desired surface texture and
 uniformity. Upon failure to adhere positively to the structure
 without chipping or cracking, or if the desired surface appearance
 cannot be attained, the coating shall be removed from the structure
 and the surface given a rubbed finish, or another approved finish
 satisfactory to the Engineer.
 702
 
 802
 (4) Class 4, Exposed Aggregate Finish. This type of finish shall
 be produced by scrubbing the surface of green concrete with stiff
 wire or fiber brushes, using a solution of muriatic acid in the
 proportion of 1 part acid to 4 parts water, or by sand blasting, until
 the cement film or surface is completely removed and the aggregate
 particles are exposed. The amount of aggregate exposure will be
 specified on the plans or designated by the Engineer. Any surface
 treated with muriatic acid shall be thoroughly washed with water to
 which a small amount of ammonia has been added to remove all
 traces of the acid. The resulting surface shall be an even pebbled
 texture.
 (5) Class 5, Tined Bridge Roadway Surface Finish. The
 concrete bridge roadway surface shall be given a finish with a burlap
 drag, followed by tining.
 The surface shall be finished by dragging a seamless strip of
 damp burlap over the full width of the roadway surface. The burlap
 drag shall consist of sufficient layers of burlap and have sufficient
 length in contact with the concrete to slightly groove the surface,
 and shall be moved forward with a minimum bow of the lead edge.
 The drag shall be kept damp, clean, and free of particles of hardened
 concrete.
 The final finish shall be accomplished by using the drag finish as
 described above with the further application of a metal tine finishing
 device.
 The tine shall be approximately 0.032" x 0.125"
 (0.8 mm x 3.0 mm) of steel flat wire, 2"-5" (50 mm-125 mm) in
 length, and spaced on 1/2"-3/4" (13 mm-19 mm) centers. The
 grooves produced in the concrete shall be substantially from 1/8"3/16" (3 mm-5 mm) in depth. The grooves shall be transverse to the
 centerline of the surface. The metal tine device shall be operated by
 approved mechanical or manual means. Other texturing equipment
 may be approved by the Engineer provided it produces a texture
 equivalent to that produced by the metal tine.
 The tining shall be terminated with a transition in depth 18"
 (0.5 m) from the gutter line.
 As an alternate to the use of a burlap drag and a metal tine
 finishing device, a finned float may be used according to the
 following requirements:
 After a tight uniform surface meeting the straightedge
 requirements of Subsection 802.20(b) has been achieved, the surface
 703
 
 802
 shall be given a texture by transverse grooving with a finned float.
 The finned area of the float shall be at least 4" x 36"
 (100 mm x 900 mm). The fins shall extend the full length of the
 float and cover at least half of the width. The grooves produced
 shall be approximately 3/16" (5 mm) in width at 3/4" (19 mm)
 centers and substantially 1/8"-3/16" (3 mm-5 mm) in depth. This
 operation shall be performed at such time and in such manner that
 the desired texture will be achieved while minimizing displacement
 of the larger aggregate particles. The transverse grooving shall be
 terminated approximately 18" (0.5 m) from the gutter line at the
 base of the curb. The un-grooved area adjacent to the curbs shall be
 given a longitudinal light broom finish.
 (6) Class 6, Broomed Finish. After the concrete has been
 deposited in place, it shall be consolidated and the surface shall be
 struck off by means of a strike board, floated, and broomed. An
 edging tool shall be used on edges and expansion joints. The
 surface shall not vary more than 1/4" (6 mm) under a 10' (3 m)
 straightedge. The surface shall have a granular or matte texture.
 (7) Class 7, Grooved Bridge Roadway Surface Finish.
 Following straightedging according to Subsection 802.20(b) and
 after all excess moisture has disappeared, the concrete shall be given
 a finish with a belt or a burlap drag, prior to the grooved finish.
 The belted finish shall be accomplished by two applications of a
 soft, flexible belt of approved composition 8" - 12" (200 mm300 mm) in width. The belt shall be moved forward with a
 combined transverse and longitudinal motion, the longitudinal
 advance being very slight for the first belting, but with a sweeping
 motion for the final belting. Care shall be exercised that the belting
 operation does not work the crown out of the deck surface. Just
 before the concrete attains its initial set, the surface shall be given
 the final belting with the purpose of producing a uniform surface of
 roughened texture.
 The burlap drag finish shall be accomplished by dragging a
 seamless strip of damp burlap over the full width of the surface.
 The burlap drag shall consist of sufficient layers of burlap and have
 sufficient length in contact with the concrete to slightly groove the
 surface and shall be moved forward with a minimum bow of the
 leading edge. The drag shall be kept damp, clean, and free of
 particles of hardened concrete.
 704
 
 802
 The bridge roadway surface shall be grooved perpendicular to the
 centerline with grooves extending across the slab to within 18"
 (0.5 m) of the gutter lines.
 The grooves shall be cut into the concrete using a mechanical
 sawing device that will leave grooves 1/8"-3/16" (3 mm-5 mm) in
 depth and spaced on 1/2"-3/4" (13 mm-19 mm) centers. Grooving
 blades shall be 0.075"-0.125" (2 mm-3 mm) wide. Sawing shall not
 be performed before the end of the normal curing.
 Residue from the grooving operations shall be removed and the
 bridge deck thoroughly cleaned. Residue shall not be permitted to
 enter drainage facilities or streams.
 802.20 Bridge Roadway Surface Construction. (a) Striking
 Off. After the concrete is placed and consolidated according to
 Subsection 802.09, bridge roadway surfaces or top slabs of
 structures serving as finished roadway surfaces shall be finished
 using approved equipment. The Contractor shall show the type,
 size, and weight of the finishing machine and auxiliary equipment
 that is to be used in the bridge deck construction on the drawings
 submitted for the span and overhang support system required by
 Subsection 802.13.
 Mechanical strike-off machines shall be power driven, with
 oscillating type screeds, traveling on rails or headers adjusted to
 conform to the profile or cross section of the roadway. The screed
 shall be adjusted to conform to the profile or the required cross
 section of the roadway. Consolidation by a vibratory action of the
 finishing machine will not be permitted. The screeds shall have
 sufficient strength to retain their shape after adjustment. The
 finishing machine shall go over each area of the bridge roadway
 surface as many times as is required to obtain the required profile
 and cross section. A slight excess of concrete shall be kept in front
 of the screed at all times. This excess of concrete shall be carried all
 the way to the edge of the placement or form, and shall not be
 worked into the slab but shall be wasted. When a finishing machine
 travels on rails supported by fixtures embedded in the concrete area,
 these supports shall be removed and the holes filled and finished to
 the same quality and finish as the surrounding concrete. The holes
 shall be cleaned of grease and other foreign matter prior to filling.
 When non-mechanical strike-off methods are approved, the
 bridge roadway surfaces or slabs shall be struck off with a screed
 705
 
 802
 that is parallel to the centerline of the roadway, resting on bulk
 heads or screed strips cut or set to the required cross section of the
 roadway. This screed shall be so constructed as to have sufficient
 strength to retain its shape and the cutting edge shall be adjusted to
 conform to the profile of the roadway. Screed strips or headers shall
 be accurately set to the specified grades, checked, and adjusted as
 necessary prior to the final screeding operation. The screed shall be
 worked back and forth over the surface until the proper profile and
 cross section is obtained.
 Longitudinal screeds shall be of sufficient length to finish the full
 length of spans 50' (15 m) or less in length. Spans over 50' (15 m)
 in length and continuous spans shall be placed with lengths of
 placements as shown on the plans. The use of longitudinal screeds
 on spans with a horizontal curve is prohibited.
 Excess water, laitance, or foreign materials brought to the surface
 during the course of the finishing operations shall not be reworked
 into the roadway surface, but shall be removed immediately upon
 appearance by means of a squeegee or straightedge drawn from the
 center of the roadway surface toward either curb.
 In general, the addition of water to the surface of the concrete to
 assist in finishing operations will not be permitted. If the
 application of water to the surface is permitted, it shall be applied as
 a fog spray by means of approved spray equipment.
 (b) Straightedging. After finishing as described above, the
 entire surface shall be checked by the Contractor, in both directions,
 for trueness using a 10' (3 m) metal straightedge. The surface shall
 show no deviation in excess of 1/8" (3 mm) from the straightedge.
 Deviations in excess of this requirement shall be corrected before
 the concrete sets. The checking operation shall progress by
 overlapping the straightedge at least ½ the length of the preceding
 pass. Major deviations shall be corrected with the strike-off; minor
 deviations may be corrected using the straightedge or a metal float.
 (c) Initial Surface Test. As soon as the surface has set
 sufficiently to withstand damage when walking on it, and not later
 than the morning following the placing of the concrete, it shall be
 straightedged in both directions with the 10' (3 m) straightedge and
 any variations exceeding 1/8" (3 mm) shall be plainly marked. In
 addition, profiles shall be taken at 10' (3 m) intervals along the
 centerline of bridge, centerline of each lane, and each gutter line.
 706
 
 802
 When the bridge roadway surface profiles exhibit surface
 deviations in excess of 1/4" (6 mm) in 20' (6 m), the Contractor shall
 make appropriate changes to either equipment or methods prior to
 proceeding with the next bridge deck placement.
 After the initial placement, the straightedge and profile
 requirements shall extend onto the adjacent placements.
 (d) Final Surface Test. Upon completion of the entire bridge
 superstructure, the bridge roadway surface shall be checked as
 specified above.
 All marked areas shall be corrected by grinding until such
 deviations have been reduced to meet the tolerances of 1/8" (3 mm)
 in 10' (3 m) and 1/4" (6 mm) in 20' (6 m) at no cost to the
 Department. The grinding equipment shall be power driven and
 specifically designed to smooth and texture portland cement
 concrete by means of diamond blades.
 All areas that have been ground shall be re-grooved according to
 Subsection 802.19, Class 7.
 802.21 Precast Concrete Products. (a) General.
 This
 subsection pertains to concrete units that have been cast prior to
 erection or installation, and shall include precast concrete slab and
 girder units, bent caps, rail posts, piling, and other items. The

 of slabs and bent caps shall not vary more than 1/8" (3 mm) for the
 full depth of the unit when tested with a straightedge in both
 horizontal and vertical directions. The top and bottom of bent caps
 and the tops of slab and girder units shall not vary more than 1/8"
 (3 mm) in any 10' (3 m) length when tested with a straightedge in
 both longitudinal and transverse directions.
 (e) Reinforcing. Reinforcing steel shall be accurately located in
 the forms and firmly held in place by means of auxiliary steel wire
 supports sufficient in number and size to prevent displacement
 during the course of construction.
 (f) Placing Concrete. Concrete shall not be deposited in the
 forms until the Engineer has inspected and approved the placing of
 the reinforcement. Vibrating shall be done with care and in such a
 manner as to avoid displacement of reinforcement or wires.
 The maximum concrete mix temperature at the time of placement
 shall be 95° F (35° C). When the internal temperature of the plastic
 concrete reaches 90° F (32° C), the Contractor shall take necessary
 precautions to ensure that the temperature of succeeding batches
 does not exceed 95° F (35° C). No concrete shall be placed when
 the air temperature is below 36° F (2° C) unless provision is made
 for heating the ingredients and for enclosing the concrete and
 heating the enclosure. The minimum placement temperature of the
 
 708
 
 802
 plastic concrete mix shall be 50° F (10° C). The methods used to
 control the concrete temperature shall be approved by the Engineer.
 (g) Curing, Removal of Forms, and Handling of Completed
 Units. The requirements of Subsections 802.15 and 802.17 shall be
 modified according to the following specifications:
 Exposed surfaces shall be covered with wetted burlappolyethylene sheeting as soon as the concrete has set sufficiently to
 prevent marring of surfaces, and the entire unit shall be kept
 continuously wet for a period of not less than 5 days. Steam curing,
 according to the requirements of Subsection 802.22(f)(2)f, may be
 used in lieu of covering with sheeting. Other precautions to ensure
 development of strength shall be taken if directed. Side forms may
 be removed when such removal will cause no breakage, distortion,
 slump, or misalignment of the concrete.
 The precast concrete units shall remain on the bottom supporting
 forms until the concrete has reached a compressive strength of 2500
 psi (17.0 MPa), or as specified, for slab and cap units and 3000 psi
 (21.0 MPa), or as specified, for piling, as evidenced by test cylinders
 molded, cured, and tested as specified above. Then the units may be
 removed from the bottom forms to a curing or storage area. The
 units may be shipped and used when the concrete reaches the
 minimum specified 28 day compressive strength, as evidenced by
 test cylinders made at the time of casting, except that the minimum
 time between casting and shipping shall be not less than 10 days.
 After casting, units shall be picked up and supported, as a
 minimum, at points designated on the plans. Units shall be handled,
 transported, and erected in such manner as to prevent cracking,
 spalling, or marring the concrete.
 (h) Finishing Concrete Surfaces. Surfaces of precast members
 shall be finished according to the requirements set forth in
 Subsections 802.19. The exterior faces of the exterior members
 shall be given a Class 2 Finish. Other surfaces shall be given a
 Class 1 Finish, except that holes less than 3/8" (10 mm) in depth can
 be left. The final finish shall be made at the casting yard and any
 impairment of the surface occurring in transportation and erection
 shall be corrected before acceptance.
 802.22 Prestressed Concrete Structures. (a) General. This
 subsection pertains to all prestressed concrete elements in structures
 and shall govern the manufacture, transportation, and storage of
 709
 
 802

 Bridge Engineer and Resident Engineer which will enable them to
 determine the date of casting, the date of prestressing, and the
 location of the casting yard. The identification system, type and
 placement of the identification plate shall be detailed on the
 manufacturer's shop drawings.
 (2) Manufacture. a. Prestressing Equipment. Hydraulic jacks
 shall be equipped with accurate pressure gauges. The Contractor
 may elect to substitute screw jacks or other types for hydraulic
 jacks. In such cases, proving rings or other approved devices shall
 be used in connection with the jacks. All devices, whether hydraulic
 jack gauges or otherwise, shall be calibrated so as to permit the
 stress in the prestressing steel to be determined at all times. All
 devices shall be calibrated at least annually and a certified
 calibration curve shall accompany each device. If at any time there
 are indications that the calibration may be in error, the Engineer may
 require the device to be re-calibrated.
 Indications that the
 calibration may be in error include, but are not limited to, such
 conditions as apparent damage to the device or any of its
 components; corrosion of the device; etc.
 Safety measures shall be taken by the Contractor to prevent
 accidents due to possible breaking of the prestressing steel or the
 slipping of the grips during the prestressing process.
 b. Casting Yard.
 The precasting of prestressed concrete
 structural members may be done at any location selected by the
 Contractor, subject to the approval of the Engineer.
 Before any site on Department right-of-way is approved for use
 as a casting yard, the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer a plan
 of operation showing anticipated leveling or altering of the selected
 area. Upon completion of the work, the site shall be cleared of
 equipment and rubbish and restored as nearly as possible to its
 original condition.
 712
 
 802
 c. Placing Steel. Steel shall be accurately placed in the position
 shown on the plans, firmly held during the placing, and maintained
 during the setting of the concrete.
 Distances from the forms and the spacing of steel shall be
 maintained by stays, ties, hangers, or other approved supports.
 d. Pretensioning. The prestressing elements shall be positively
 and accurately held in position and shall be stressed by jacks. A
 record shall be kept of the jacking force and the elongations
 produced thereby. Several units may be cast in one continuous line
 and stressed at one time. Sufficient space shall be left between ends
 of units to permit access for cutting after the concrete has attained
 the required strength. No bond stress shall be transferred to the
 concrete, nor end anchorages released, until the concrete has
 attained a compressive strength, as shown by cylinder tests, of at
 least 4000 psi (28.0 MPa), or as specified. The elements shall be cut
 or released slowly and in such order that lateral eccentricity of
 prestress will be a minimum.
 e. Placing Concrete. Concrete shall not be deposited in the forms
 until the Engineer has inspected and approved the placing of the
 reinforcement, anchorages, and prestressing steel. The concrete
 shall be vibrated internally or externally or both as directed by the
 Engineer. The vibrating shall be done with care and in such a
 manner as to avoid displacement of reinforcement or wires.
 The maximum concrete mix temperature at the time of placement
 shall be 95° F (35° C). When the internal temperature of the plastic
 concrete reaches 90° F (32° C), the Contractor shall take necessary
 precautions to ensure that the temperature of succeeding batches
 does not exceed 95° F (35° C). No concrete shall be placed when
 the air temperature is below 36° F (2° C) unless provision is made
 for heating the ingredients and for enclosing the concrete and
 heating the enclosure. The minimum placement temperature of the
 plastic concrete mix shall be 50° F (10° C). The methods used to
 control the concrete temperature shall be approved by the Engineer.
 f. Steam Curing. Steam curing will be permitted in lieu of wet
 curing. If the Contractor elects to cure with steam or by any other
 special method, the method and its details shall be approved by the
 Engineer.
 
 713
 
 802
 Steam curing shall be accomplished under a suitable enclosure to
 contain the live steam in order to minimize moisture and heat losses.
 The initial application of the steam shall be 2-4 hours after the final
 placement of concrete to allow the initial set of the concrete to take
 place. If retarders are used, the waiting period before application of
 the steam shall be increased to 4-6 hours. The steam shall be at
 100% relative humidity to prevent loss of moisture and to provide
 excess moisture for proper hydration of the cement. Application of
 the steam shall not be directly on the concrete. During application
 of the steam, the ambient air temperature shall increase at a rate not
 to exceed 40° F (22° C) per hour until a temperature of 120° F to
 160° F (49° C to 71° C) is reached. The attained temperature shall
 be held until the concrete has reached the desired strength.
 Detensioning shall be accomplished immediately after steam curing
 has been discontinued. Additional curing is not required after
 detensioning.
 In discontinuing the steam, the ambient air
 temperature shall not decrease at a rate exceeding 40° F (22° C) per
 hour until a temperature has been reached about 20° F (10° C) above
 the temperature of the air to which the concrete will be exposed.
 The concrete shall not be exposed to temperatures below freezing
 for 5 days after casting.
 The Contractor shall furnish recording thermometers showing the
 time-temperature relationship throughout the entire curing period.
 One such recording thermometer shall be furnished for each 200' (60
 m) of casting bed of each separate enclosure. Heat sensing elements
 shall be freely suspended within the accelerated cure enclosure.
 Recording thermometers shall be kept in proper calibration and
 recalibrated at least annually.
 Prestressed concrete units shall remain on the bottom supporting
 forms until the concrete has reached a compressive strength of
 4000 psi (28.0 MPa), or specified strength, as evidenced by test
 cylinders molded, cured, and tested as herein specified. The units
 may then be detensioned and removed from the bottom forms to a
 curing and storage area. Units may be shipped and used when the
 concrete reaches the greater of the minimum specified 28 day
 strength or 5000 psi (35.0 MPa), as evidenced by test cylinders
 made at the time of casting, except that the minimum time between
 casting and shipping shall be not less than 10 days.
 g. Detensioning. Detensioning shall be performed immediately
 following the curing period while the concrete is still warm (100° F
 714
 
 802
 to 130° F [38° C to 54° C ]) and moist. Forms, ties, inserts, hold
 downs, blocking between bulkheads, or other devices that would
 restrict longitudinal movement of the members along the bed shall
 be removed or loosened prior to transfer of stress.
 In single strand detensioning, the strands shall be released by
 heat-cutting using a low-oxygen flame, played along the strand for a
 minimum of 5" (125 mm). In order for the release of stress to occur
 gradually, strands shall not be cut quickly but shall be heated until
 the metal gradually loses its strength. Detensioning shall be
 accomplished at both ends of the prestressing bed and at all spaces
 between ends of members simultaneously, unless otherwise directed.
 The sequence used for cutting strands shall keep the stresses nearly
 symmetrical about the axes of the members and the pattern and
 schedule shall be approved by the Engineer.
 In multiple strand detensioning, strands shall be released
 simultaneously by hydraulic jacking. The total force shall be taken
 from the header by the jack, then gradually released.
 Detensioning of draped strands shall follow the procedures
 outlined in the Manual For Quality Control for Plants and
 Production of Structural Precast Concrete Products, MNL 116
 published by the Precast Concrete Institute, except as modified by
 these specifications.
 (3) Handling. Extreme care shall be exercised in handling and
 moving precast prestressed concrete members. Precast girders and
 slabs shall be transported in an upright position and the points of
 support and directions of the reactions with respect to the member
 shall be approximately the same during transportation and storage as
 when the member is in its final position.
 After casting, precast prestressed piling shall be picked up and
 supported, as a minimum, at points designated on the plans. Care
 should be taken during storage, hoisting, and handling of the precast
 units to prevent cracking or damage. Units damaged by improper
 storing or handling shall be replaced by the Contractor at no cost to
 the Department.
 (4) Placing. Precast prestressed structural members shall be
 placed in the structure in conformity with the plans and any Special
 Provisions governing the particular type of structure to be built.

 bands, and should be lifted with a strong back, multiple supports, or
 a platform bridge to prevent bar to bar abrasion from sags in the bar
 bundle. Epoxy coated bars shall be stored on padded and/or wooden
 supports. All systems for handling coated bars shall have padded
 contact areas. If, in the judgment of the Engineer, the coating is
 damaged to the extent that the coating no longer provides the
 intended protection, the material shall be returned to the coating
 applicator for repair or replacement. Patching materials or any
 required repair of the coating shall be at no cost to the Department.
 Steel reinforcement shall be protected from damage. When
 placed in the work, it shall be free from dirt, detrimental rust or
 scale, paint, oil, or other foreign substance. Steel reinforcement
 shall be stored above the ground on skids, platforms, or other
 supports. Epoxy coated reinforcing steel that is not incorporated
 into the work within 90 calendar days after delivery to the project
 shall be protected from exposure to the sun.
 Epoxy coating damaged during fabrication, shipping, or
 installation shall be repaired according to ASTM A775. Damaged
 areas less than 0.10 square inch (65 sq mm) need not be repaired but
 all areas larger than 0.10 square inch (65 sq mm) shall be repaired.
 The maximum amount of damage shall not exceed 2% of the surface
 area of each bar. All damaged areas shall be repaired with the
 material specified in Subsection 804.02(d) and according to the
 manufacturer's instructions. Repairs will be required on all sheared
 727
 
 804
 or cut ends of bars, end areas left bare during the coating process,
 and any areas where the entire coating is removed. All repairs shall
 be completed as soon as practicable and, in the case of bare end
 areas and sheared ends, before visible oxidation of the surface
 occurs. Epoxy coated bars shall not be flame cut.
 The Contractor shall exercise caution when placing and vibrating
 concrete to prevent any damage to epoxy coated bars. In order to
 prevent the vibrator from damaging the coated bars, the head shall
 be covered with a sheet of rubber or a similar material as approved
 by the Engineer.
 804.06 Placing and Fastening. Steel reinforcement shall be
 accurately placed in the positions shown on the plans and firmly
 held during the placing and setting of concrete. Bars shall be tied at
 all intersections except where spacing is less than 12" (300 mm) in
 each direction, in which case alternate intersections shall be tied.
 Bundled bars shall be tied together at not more than 6' (2 m)
 centers.
 Bar positions or clearances from the forms shall be maintained by
 means of stays, ties, hangers, or other approved devices.
 Reinforcing steel shall not be welded unless detailed on the plans or
 authorized in writing by the Engineer. Any authorized welding shall
 comply with Subsection 807.26. Metal bar supports that are in
 contact with the exterior surface of the concrete shall have
 protection conforming with the CRSI Specifications, Class 1 for
 Plastic Protected Bar Supports or Class 2 for Stainless Steel Bar
 Supports, with the further provision that the plastic protection may
 be applied either by a dipping operation or by the addition of
 premolded plastic tips to the legs of the supports. Epoxy Coated Bar
 Supports that are coated according to the provisions of CRSI
 “Manual of Standard Practice” with a minimum coating thickness of
 5 mils (127 µm) may be substituted for Plastic Protected Bar
 Supports or Stainless Steel Bar Supports. All high chairs and bar
 bolsters shall be metal.
 Plastic bar supports shall not be used.
 When concrete is to rest on an excavated surface, layers of bars
 shall be supported above the surface by metal chairs or by precast
 mortar or concrete blocks. The use of rocks, pieces of stone or
 brick, pipe, wooden blocks, or chunks of concrete will not be
 permitted as bar supports or spacers.
 728
 
 804
 Reinforcement shall be placed by the Contractor and inspected
 and approved by the Engineer before the placing of concrete begins.
 Concrete placed in violation of this provision may be rejected and
 removal required. Unless otherwise shown on the plans, the spacing
 of supports shall conform to the recommendations of CRSI.
 If fabric reinforcement is shipped in rolls, it shall be straightened
 into flat sheets before being placed.
 Epoxy coated bars shall be placed on plastic coated or epoxy
 coated metal supports and shall be held in place by use of plastic
 coated tie wires or molded plastic clips especially fabricated for this
 purpose. Bar supports for epoxy coated bars shall be fully coated
 metal supports. Epoxy coated bar supports shall be coated
 according to the provisions of CRSI “Manual of Standard Practice”
 and shall have a minimum coating thickness of 5 mils (127 µm). In
 placing epoxy coated bars, care shall be maintained to prevent
 coated bars from being damaged.
 After the coated bars are secured to bar supports, a final visual
 inspection shall be made and all uncoated or damaged areas coated
 or repaired as required by the Engineer.
 Any bar supports that deform under foot traffic or other
 construction activities shall not be used.
 Reinforcing steel that is to be doweled into existing concrete shall
 be installed into drilled holes and secured using an approved nonshrink grout or a resin anchoring system listed on the Department’s
 Qualified Products List. The diameter of the drilled holes and the
 installation procedures shall be as recommended by the grout
 manufacturer or the resin anchoring system manufacturer.
 804.07 Splicing. Reinforcing steel shall be furnished in the full
 lengths specified on the plans. Bars spliced as a result of unforeseen
 construction conditions or sequences will require the written
 approval of the Engineer. Splices shall meet the requirements of the
 current edition of the AASHTO Standard Specifications for
 Highway Bridges or AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications,
 as specified in the plans.
 Secondary reinforcing used for distribution of loads, such as
 longitudinal bars in box culverts, retaining walls, and slabs for steel
 girder spans, may be lapped 32 bar diameters minimum if bars are
 #6 (No. 19) or smaller. Primary reinforcing for columns and
 729
 
 804
 retaining walls which require splicing as a result of the lowering of
 footings shall be spliced at the upper end of the original bars.
 Required lengths of splices for primary reinforcing will be
 determined by the Bridge Engineer.
 In lapped splices, the bars shall be placed in contact and fastened
 together in such a manner as to maintain the minimum distance to
 the surface of the concrete as shown on the plans. Welded or
 mechanical splices shall be made only if detailed on the plans or
 authorized in writing by the Engineer. Welding shall comply with
 Subsection 807.26. Mechanical splices shall be listed on the QPL
 and shall be the type specified on the plans or approved by the
 Engineer.
 804.08 Lapping. Sheets of wire fabric or bar mat reinforcement
 shall overlap each other sufficiently to maintain a uniform strength
 and shall be securely fastened at the ends and edges. The lap shall
 be not less than one space of wire fabric or bar.
 804.09 Substitutions. Bar size substitutions will be permitted
 only with specific authorization by the Engineer. The substituted
 bars shall have an area equivalent to or larger than the design area.
 804.10 Method of Measurement. Steel reinforcement properly
 placed and tied will be measured in pounds (kilograms) based on the
 total computed weight for the sizes and lengths of bars, wire fabric,
 or mats shown on the plans or revised by the Engineer.
 Epoxy Coated Reinforcing Steel will be measured by the pound
 (kilogram), based on the theoretical number of pounds (kilograms)
 calculated on the nominal weight before application of the epoxy
 coating materials. No allowance will be made for the epoxy coating
 material, the coating process, accessories, or the testing required by
 the manufacturer or applicator as specified above.
 The weight of wire fabric will be computed from the theoretical
 weight of plain wire. If the weight per square foot (square meter) is
 given on the plans, that weight will be used.
 
 730
 
 804
 The weight of plain round bars and deformed bars will be
 calculated using the following table:

 The quantities shown on the plans will be considered as the final
 quantities and no further measurement will be made unless, in the
 opinion of the Engineer or upon evidence furnished by the
 Contractor, substantial variations exist between quantities shown on
 the plans and actual quantities due to changes in alignment or
 dimensions or to apparent errors.
 If bars are substituted at the Contractor's request and as a result
 more steel is used than specified, only the amount specified will be
 measured for payment.
 When laps are made for splices other than those shown on the
 plans, for the convenience of the Contractor, the extra steel will not
 be measured for payment.
 804.11 Basis of Payment. Work completed and accepted and
 measured as provided above will be paid for at the contract unit
 price per pound (kilogram) bid for Reinforcing Steel-Bridge,
 Reinforcing Steel-Roadway, or Epoxy Coated Reinforcing Steel,
 which price shall be full compensation for furnishing, bending,
 fabricating, epoxy coating, and placing the reinforcement; for
 accessories placed in concrete; and for all labor, equipment, tools,
 and incidentals necessary to complete the work. Clips, metal
 spacers, chairs, bar supports, ties, separators, wire, and other
 731
 
 804
 material used for fastening reinforcement in place will not be
 measured or paid for separately, but full compensation therefor will
 be considered included in the contract unit price bid for Reinforcing

 SECTION 805
 PILING
 805.01 Description. This item shall consist of furnishing and
 driving piles of the type and dimensions designated on the plans or
 in the Contract, including cutting off or building up piles when
 required. Piling shall comply with and be installed according to
 these specifications, and at the location, and to the elevation,
 penetration, and bearing capacity shown on the plans or as directed
 by the Engineer.
 805.02 General. Unless otherwise specified, all references to
 "steel piles" shall include "steel shell piles".
 Where test piles or test loading is used or required, all piles shall
 be of the same type, shape and size as the test pile which governs
 that structure or that portion of the structure.
 The requirements herein for casting, curing, handling, and
 driving piles shall be considered as minimum requirements. Strict
 compliance with these minimum requirements will not relieve the
 Contractor of the responsibility for adopting whatever additional
 provisions may be necessary to ensure the successful completion of
 the work.
 Unless otherwise shown on the plans, the embankment at bridge
 ends shall be made to the bottom of the cap for bents without
 footings and thoroughly compacted as provided in the governing
 732
 
 805
 specifications before driving end bent piles. In general, foundation
 piles shall not be driven until after the excavation is complete.
 Material forced up between the piles shall be removed to the correct
 elevation without cost to the Department before concrete for the
 foundation is placed.
 The pile lengths shown on the plans are for estimating and bid
 comparison purposes only, except where lengths to be ordered are
 specified. All piles shall be driven to the required penetration
 specified in Subsection 805.08(e).
 When the plans stipulate that test piles shall be driven, the lengths
 of piles to be ordered shall be determined by the Engineer following
 observations of the resistance to driving and the results of tests.
 The order lengths will generally be provided to the Contractor
 within three business days after all test piles for a complete structure
 have been driven or at an earlier date if the Engineer deems that
 sufficient test pile data has been obtained to establish the lengths for
 a portion of the structure. When Method B or C is used to determine
 bearing capacity, additional time will be required to analyze the test
 pile data and determine the order lengths.
 Unless the plans stipulate that test piles shall be driven or that
 certain length piles shall be ordered, it shall be the responsibility of
 the Contractor to estimate the lengths required and to furnish and
 drive piles in whatever sections and lengths that may be found
 necessary to meet the requirements of penetration and bearing
 resistance as specified or as directed. Piles shall be furnished in
 such lengths as may reasonably be expected to develop the required
 bearing resistance without build-ups. The Engineer will cooperate
 with the Contractor in furnishing, for guidance, available boring
 data, soil test data, etc., and recommendations or instructions on
 proper pile lengths, but the actual determination of the lengths of
 piles to be furnished shall be the responsibility of the Contractor,
 except that no pile shall be furnished of a length less than that
 required for the minimum specified depth of penetration. Where the
 piles as driven prove to be of insufficient length to secure the
 required bearing resistance, build-ups as necessary to obtain the
 required bearing will be permitted, either before or after pile has
 been driven to required bearing.
 
 733
 
 805
 Where a precast pile is to be driven after making build-ups, the
 built-up portion shall be cured at least 10 days and shall have a
 minimum strength of 4000 psi (28.0 MPa) before driving.
 Unless otherwise specified, when steel piles extend above the
 ground they shall be protected by painting as specified for painting
 structural steel in Section 638. This protection shall extend from an
 elevation 18" (0.5 m) below the ground to the top of exposed pile,
 except no painting is required on the portion of pile encased in
 concrete.
 The bearing capacity of piles will be determined by the Engineer
 as provided in the Contract by one or a combination of the following
 methods:
 •
 Method A -- Empirical Pile Formulas.
 •
 Method B -- Wave Equation Analysis (WEAP).
 •
 Method C -- Dynamic Load Test.
 These methods are described in Subsection 805.09.
 Method A, Empirical Pile Formulas, will be used unless
 otherwise specified.
 805.03 Materials. (a) Class S(AE) Concrete, complying with
 Section 802, shall be used for concrete piles, unless otherwise
 specified. The Contractor shall perform quality control and
 acceptance sampling and testing in accordance with Subsection
 802.06 for piling build-ups.
 (b) Reinforcing for piles shall comply with Section 804.
 (c) Unless otherwise specified, steel piles shall consist of
 structural shapes of the section shown on the plans and shall comply
 with AASHTO M 270, Grade 36 (250).
 (d) Unless otherwise specified, plain round steel shells shall
 comply with ASTM A 252, Grade 2. Shells shall be welded or
 seamless steel pipe. Concrete used to fill the driven steel shell shall
 be Class S complying with Section 802 unless otherwise noted.
 Steel shells shall be uniform sections of the outside diameter and
 nominal thickness shown on the plans. The Contractor shall furnish
 shells of greater thickness, if necessary, to provide sufficient
 strength and rigidity and shall select equipment to permit driving
 without damage. Steel shells shall resist the earth pressure after
 being driven and retain their original form free from harmful
 distortions after they and adjacent shells in the bent or pier have
 been driven. Driving tips welded to the end of the steel shell shall
 734
 
 805
 be installed according to the plans. Such welding shall form a
 watertight joint.
 Steel shell piles shall be marked by the manufacturer near both
 ends of the pile. Marking shall be in accordance with ASTM A 252.
 (e) Driving points, when called for on the plans, shall be listed on
 the QPL.
 (f) Welding of steel and steel shell piles, including attachment of
 driving tips and points, shall be done by certified welders using the
 shielded metal arc method and shall comply with the governing
 specifications designated in Subsection 807.26. Other welding
 methods may be used with the written approval of the Engineer.
 805.04 Manufacture of Precast Concrete Piles. (a) General.
 Precast concrete piles shall be constructed according to the details
 shown on the plans and the provisions of Section 802, insofar as
 they are applicable, supplemented by the requirements of this
 subsection.
 Piles cast off the job site shall be subject to the same
 requirements as for piles cast at the job site and will be subject to
 further inspection after delivery. Piles manufactured off the job site
 must bear evidence that the component materials have been tested
 and approved and that the construction methods have been inspected
 by an inspector approved by the Engineer.
 (b) Form Work. Forms for precast concrete piles shall comply
 with the general requirements for concrete form work as provided in
 Subsections 802.21 and 802.22. Forms shall be accessible for
 tamping and consolidation of the concrete. Side forms shall not be
 removed in less than 24 hours after placing the concrete. The entire
 pile shall remain supported for at least 7 calendar days and shall not
 be subjected to any handling stress until the concrete has cured for at
 least 21 calendar days. These periods may be shortened or
 lengthened when the Engineer has determined that the concrete has
 attained the minimum specified compressive strength. However, no
 forms shall be removed in less than 12 hours and no piles moved in
 less than 16 hours. For prestressed piles, form removal shall comply
 with Subsection 802.21(g).
 (c) Reinforcement. For precast piles, reinforcement shall be
 placed according to the details shown on the plans.
 (d) Casting. Concrete shall not be deposited in the forms until
 the Engineer has inspected the placing of reinforcement, anchorages,
 735
 
 805
 and prestressing steel and has given approval. The piles may be cast
 in either a horizontal or a vertical position. Special care shall be
 taken to place the concrete so as to avoid displacement of and to
 produce a satisfactory bond with the reinforcement, and to avoid the
 formation of stone pockets, honeycomb, or other such defects.
 The concrete in each pile shall be placed continuously and shall
 be consolidated by vibrating or by other means acceptable to the
 Engineer. The forms shall be over filled, the surplus concrete
 screeded off, and the top surfaces finished to a uniform texture
 similar to that produced by the forms.
 (e) Finish. As soon as the forms are removed, concrete piles
 shall be carefully pointed with 1:2 mortar and given a Class 1 finish
 according to Subsection 802.19.
 (f) Curing. Concrete piles shall be cured as provided in
 Subsections 802.21(g) and 802.22(f). The periods for curing and
 setting may be shortened or lengthened subject to such suitable tests
 as may be made to determine the quality and strength of the
 concrete. Piles may be driven when the concrete is found to have a
 compressive strength of not less than 4000 psi (28.0 MPa), provided
 further that in no case shall piles be driven in less than 10 calendar
 days.
 805.05 Handling and Storage of Piles. (a) Precast Concrete
 Piles. Removal of forms, curing, storing, transporting, and handling
 precast concrete piles shall be accomplished in such manner as to
 avoid excessive bending stresses, cracking, spalling, or other
 injurious results. In raising a precast pile, it shall be suspended, as a
 minimum, at points as shown on the plans. For a three-point pickup,
 ropes or cables supported over pulleys shall be used to equalize the
 supporting forces.
 Stored piles shall be placed on skids of timber or other suitable
 material. The skids, as a minimum, shall be placed at the pick-up
 points.
 (b) Steel Piles. The method of storing and handling shall be such
 as to avoid injury to the piles. When steel piles are to be stored, they
 shall be placed on skids that will raise them above the ground. A
 sufficient number of skids shall be used to prevent excessive
 deflection.
 
 736
 
 805
 805.06 Defective Piles. The Contractor shall not subject piles to
 excessive abuse that will produce cracking, crushing, spalling, or
 deformation of the pile. Manipulation of piles to force them into
 proper position, considered by the Engineer to be excessive, will not
 be permitted. Any pile damaged by reason of internal defects or
 improper driving, or any pile driven out of its proper location or
 driven below the elevation fixed by the plans or the Engineer, shall
 be corrected at no cost to the Department by one of the following
 methods, as approved by the Engineer:
 •
 
 The pile may be withdrawn and replaced by a new and, if
 necessary, longer pile.
 
 •
 
 A second pile may be driven adjacent to the defective or
 low pile.
 
 •
 
 The pile may be spliced or built up as otherwise provided
 herein, or a sufficient portion of the footing extended to
 properly embed the pile.
 
 Piles pushed up by the driving of adjacent piles or by any other
 cause shall be re-driven to grade.
 Any crushed or damaged portion of piling may be cut off and
 built up or the pile completely replaced, as approved by the
 Engineer. Cutoff, buildup, and/or replacement of damaged piles
 shall be at no cost to the Department.
 805.07 Driving Equipment. Driving equipment that damages
 the piling shall not be used.
 (a) Hammers. Unless otherwise specified on the plans, all piling
 shall be driven with an air, steam, or diesel hammer. Gravity
 hammers will be permitted only when shown on the plans or as
 elsewhere allowed by the specifications.
 The plant and equipment furnished for air or steam hammers
 shall have sufficient capacity to maintain, under working conditions,
 the pressure at the hammer specified by the manufacturer. Accurate
 pressure gauges shall be placed at the boiler or tank and at the
 hammer so that the drop in pressure between the gauges can be
 determined.
 When a single acting diesel hammer is used, it shall be equipped
 with a stroke indicator or the Contractor must furnish a method
 approved by the Engineer for determining the actual stroke. When a
 737
 
 805
 double acting diesel hammer is used, it shall be equipped with a
 bounce chamber pressure gauge in good working order mounted
 near ground level so as to be conveniently read by the Engineer
 when monitoring energy output of the hammer. The Contractor
 shall provide charts that equate the chamber pressure to equivalent
 energy.
 (1) Hammers for Steel Piles. When an air, steam, or diesel
 hammer is used, the total energy developed by the hammer shall be
 not less than 10,000 foot-pounds (13 500 joules) per blow.
 Gravity hammers for driving steel piles, when allowed, shall
 weigh not less than 4000 pounds (1800 kg) and in no case shall the
 weight of the hammer be less than the combined weight of driving
 head and pile. The fall shall be so regulated as to avoid injury to the
 piles and shall in no case exceed 15' (4.5 m).
 (2) Hammers for Precast Concrete and Steel Shell Piles.
 Unless otherwise provided, the hammer shall have a ram weight that
 is at least 1/5 the weight of the pile being driven, and shall develop
 an energy per blow at each stroke of the piston of not less than one
 foot-pound for each pound (3 j/kg) of weight to be driven. In no
 case shall the weight of the ram be less than 2700 pounds (1200 kg)
 nor the total energy developed by the hammer be less than 12,500
 foot-pounds (16 900 joules) per blow.
 (b) Driving Protection. (1) Hammer Cushion. All impact pile
 driving equipment except gravity hammers shall be equipped with a
 hammer cushion of suitable thickness to prevent damage to the
 hammer or pile and to ensure uniform driving behavior. Hammer
 cushions shall be made of durable, manufactured materials,
 complying with the hammer manufacturer's guidelines except that
 all wood, wire rope, and asbestos hammer cushions are specifically
 prohibited. A striker plate as recommended by the hammer
 manufacturer shall be placed on the hammer cushion to ensure
 uniform compression of the cushion material. The hammer cushion
 shall be inspected in the presence of the Engineer before beginning
 pile driving at each structure or after each 100 hours of pile driving,
 whichever is more frequent. When the thickness of a hammer
 cushion is reduced by more than 25% of its original thickness, it
 shall be replaced by the Contractor before driving is permitted to
 continue.
 
 738
 
 805
 (2) Pile Drive Head. A pile driven with an impact hammer
 requires an adequate drive head to distribute the hammer blow to the
 pile head. The drive head shall be axially aligned with the hammer
 and the pile. The drive head shall be guided by the leads and shall
 not be free-swinging. The drive head shall fit around the pile head
 in a manner that will prevent transfer of torsional forces during
 driving while maintaining proper alignment of hammer and pile.
 For steel and timber piles, the pile heads shall be cut squarely and
 a drive head, as recommended by the hammer manufacturer, shall be
 provided to hold the axis of the pile in line with the axis of the
 hammer.
 For precast concrete and prestressed concrete piles, the pile head
 shall be plane and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pile
 to prevent eccentric impacts from the drive head.
 For special types of piles, appropriate driving heads, mandrels, or
 other devices shall be provided according to the manufacturer's
 recommendations so that the piles may be driven without damage.
 (3) Pile Cushion. The heads of concrete piles shall be
 protected by a pile cushion made of plywood. The plywood
 thickness placed on the pile head before driving shall not be less
 than 4" (100 mm). A new pile cushion shall be provided for each
 pile. In addition, the pile cushion shall be replaced if, during the
 driving of any pile, the cushion is either compressed more than onehalf the original thickness or begins to burn. The pile cushion
 dimensions and area shall match the cross sectional area of the pile
 head.
 (c) Driving Equipment Information. The Contractor shall
 submit to the Engineer, for information and record purposes, pile
 driving equipment information at least 30 days before driving piles.
 The information shall be submitted on a Pile and Driving Equipment
 Data Form, which will be supplied by the Engineer. Any change in
 the driving system will require the Contractor to submit a new Pile
 and Driving Equipment Data Form.
 (d) Additional Equipment. In case the required penetration is
 not obtained with a hammer complying with the above minimum
 requirements, the Contractor shall provide a different hammer
 and/or sufficient additional equipment at no cost to the Department.
 Additional equipment not otherwise provided for herein shall be
 approved by the Engineer prior to its use.
 739
 
 805
 (e) Leads. Pile driver leads shall be constructed in such a
 manner as to provide freedom for vertical movement of the hammer
 and shall be held in position in such a manner as to ensure adequate
 support to the pile during driving. The axis of the leads and hammer
 shall coincide with the axis of the pile as nearly as practicable.
 Except where piles are driven through water, the leads shall be of
 sufficient length so that the use of a follower will not be necessary.
 (f) Followers. Unless otherwise specified on the plans, the
 driving of piling with a follower will be allowed only with the
 written permission of the Engineer. All long piles designated on the
 plans as test piles shall be driven without a follower. The long
 pile(s) will be used to establish the required pile penetration for piles
 that are driven with a follower. All cut-offs or build-ups of long
 piles will be paid for as provided in Subsection 805.15.
 (g) Water Jets. Unless otherwise shown on the plans, water jets
 may be used only with the written approval of the Engineer. When
 water jets are used, the number of jets and the volume and pressure
 of the water at the jet nozzles shall be of sufficient capacity to freely
 erode the material adjacent to the pile. Before the desired
 penetration is reached, the jets shall be withdrawn and the pile shall
 be driven with a hammer to secure its final penetration.
 (h) Special Requirements for Method B (Wave Equation
 Analysis) or Method C (Dynamic Load Test). All pile driving
 equipment, including the pile driving hammer, hammer cushion,
 drive head, pile cushion, and other appurtenances to be furnished by
 the Contractor must be approved by the Engineer before any driving
 can take place. To obtain this approval, the Contractor shall submit
 a description of pile driving equipment to the Engineer, as required
 in Subsection 805.07(c).
 Approval of pile driving equipment shall not relieve the
 Contractor of the responsibility to drive piles, free of damage, to the
 required bearing and penetration.
 During pile driving operations, the Contractor shall use the
 approved driving system. Any change in the driving system will
 only be considered after the Contractor has submitted revised pile
 driving equipment data. The Contractor will be notified of the
 acceptance or rejection of the driving system changes within five
 business days of the Engineer's receipt of the requested change. The
 time required for submission, review, and approval of a revised
 740
 
 805
 driving system shall not constitute the basis for a contract time
 extension to the Contractor.
 The following hammer efficiencies will be used in the Wave
 Equation Analysis:
 Hammer Type
 
 Efficiency in Percent
 
 Single acting air/steam
 Double acting air/steam
 Diesel
 
 67
 50
 72
 
 The criteria that the Engineer will use to evaluate the
 acceptability of the driving equipment shall consist of: 1) the
 required number of hammer blows per 1 inch (25 mm); and 2) the
 pile stresses at both the required ultimate pile capacity and at a
 hammer blow count of 20 blows per 1 inch (25 mm). The required
 number of hammer blows indicated by wave equation analysis
 calculations and, as applicable, pile driving analyzer measurements
 at the required ultimate bearing capacity shall be between 3 and 12
 per 1 inch (25 mm) for the driving equipment to be acceptable. In
 addition, the pile stresses to be generated by the driving equipment
 shall not exceed the values where pile damage impends. Unless
 otherwise specified in the plans, the point of impending damage is
 defined as follows:
 •
 
 For steel piles, a compressive driving stress of 90% of
 the yield point, fy, of the pile material (0.90fy).
 
 •
 
 For prestressed concrete piles, tensile stresses shall not
 exceed 912 psi (6.3 MPa) and compressive stresses shall
 not exceed 3550 psi (24.9 MPa).
 
 •
 
 For non-prestressed concrete piles, tensile stresses shall
 not exceed 190 psi (1.3 MPa) and compressive stresses
 shall not exceed 3400 psi (23.8 MPa).
 
 805.08 Driving. Unless otherwise specified, the use of pilot
 holes or other driving procedures not covered above will be
 permitted only when approved by the Engineer.
 (a) Preboring. When specified, the Contractor shall prebore
 holes at pile locations and to depths shown on the plans or as
 directed by the Engineer. Prebored holes shall be smaller than the
 diameter or diagonal of the pile cross section and sufficient to allow
 penetration of the pile to the specified depth. If subsurface
 741
 
 805
 obstructions, such as boulders or rock layers, are encountered, the
 hole diameter may be increased to the least dimension that is
 adequate for pile installation. Any void space remaining around the
 pile after completion of driving shall be filled with sand, sand grout
 mixture, or other approved material. Material resulting from drilled
 holes shall be disposed of under Section 210. The use of spuds (a short
 strong driven member that is removed to make a hole for inserting a
 pile) will not be permitted in lieu of boring, unless specifically
 authorized by the Engineer. When preboring is not specified, the
 Contractor may, with the approval of the Engineer, use preboring for
 his own convenience and at no cost to the Department.
 (b) Protection of Concrete. No piles shall be driven within 20'
 (6 m) of a concrete placement, including placement in a steel shell, for
 a period of seven calendar days after placement.
 (c) Splicing Piles. Concrete piles shall be furnished full length
 without splices.
 Steel and steel shell piles shall be provided to the length reasonably
 expected to be necessary to develop the required bearing resistance and
 the minimum specified depth of penetration. No more than one shopmade or field welded splice will be permitted within this length. The
 field splice may be welded either before or after pile driving is begun,
 however splicing of piles after driving has begun shall be performed
 immediately after driving is ceased to ensure a minimum of
 interruption in the continuous driving of the pile. This field splice will
 not be considered as a build-up and no splice allowance will be paid.
 Should this reasonably expected pile length not be adequate to satisfy
 all conditions required to cease driving, up to two additional splices for
 build-up will be permitted. A minimum length of 5' (1.5 m) between
 splices shall be maintained.
 Prior to field welding steel and steel shell pile splices, the sections
 shall be properly aligned to form a straight axis and shall be welded
 together in compliance with the plans and in a manner that will fully
 develop the section. Splices of steel shell piles shall form a watertight
 joint.
 The splicing of steel piles and steel shell piles shall be accomplished
 by welding according to Subsection 805.03(f).
 (d) Accuracy of Driving. Piles shall be driven with a variation of
 not more than 1/4" per foot (20 mm/m) from the vertical or from the
 batter shown on the plans, except that for pile bents the top of the
 completed pile shall be no more than 3" (75 mm) from the true position
 as shown on the plans. Foundation piles shall not be out of the position
 shown on the plans more than 4" (100 mm) after driving.
 742
 
 805
 (e) Penetration. Piles shall be driven to the required depths of
 penetration shown on the plans and to greater depths if necessary to
 secure the bearing resistance specified.
 If penetration requirements are not specified, piling shall have a
 minimum penetration of 20' (6 m) or be driven into the material shown
 on the plans or boring logs as rock. Penetration will be measured from
 the natural ground line for pile bents and from the bottom of footing or
 seal for foundation piles.
 When preboring is not specified, the Contractor may, with the
 approval of the Engineer, use preboring to achieve the required
 minimum penetration, at his own convenience and at no cost to the
 Department.
 (f) Driving Inspection. Piling shall be driven under the
 observation of the Engineer or his representative so that data may be
 obtained for determining the penetration and bearing value of the
 piles.
 (g) Test Piles. When required, test piles shall be furnished and
 driven at locations as shown on the plans or as directed by the
 Engineer, and shall comply with the requirements herein provided.
 The driving equipment used for driving test piles shall be that which
 the Contractor proposes to use on the production piling.
 Except as herein provided, all driving to meet the required
 penetration and bearing on a test pile shall be continuous. The only
 interruption permitted shall be that necessary for build-up of steel
 piling or excavating for concrete piling.
 Unless otherwise specified or directed, test piles shall be made a
 part of the completed work and shall be cut off or built up to grade
 elevations as necessary. The Contractor will be given the option of
 driving test piles for his own information in estimating the length of
 piles even though they are not required or indicated on the plans;
 however, these piles will not be paid for as Test Piles.
 If test piles were used to determine the order list according to
 Subsection 805.10 and the Engineer approves the use of another pile
 driver after the pile list has been established, the first pile driven
 with the new equipment shall be driven as a test pile. This pile shall
 be driven in a bent where a pile has been previously driven and will
 be used by the Engineer to establish new pile lengths. The length
 and location of the pile to be driven will be determined by the
 Engineer. If the Contract specifies that the bearing capacity will be
 743
 
 805
 determined by Method C, dynamic testing of the pile will be
 required. The cost of such dynamic testing shall be at no cost to the
 Department. The pile driven as a test pile shall be paid for at the
 contract unit price bid for Steel Piling, Steel Shell Piling, or
 Concrete Piling. The Contractor has the following two options after
 the new pile length has been established:
 1. Order new piles of the proper length. The payment will
 be based on this new pile length and any cut-off or build-up
 will be measured and paid according to Subsections 805.14
 and 805.15.
 2. Use the existing piles from the original established pile
 length.
 •
 
 If the new pile length is longer than the original length
 any build-up will be paid only when it exceeds the new
 established pile length. Any cut-off will paid only when
 the final length in place is less than the original length.
 
 •
 
 If the new pile length is shorter than the original length
 any build-up will be paid only when it exceeds the
 original length. Any cut-off will be paid only when the
 final length in place is shorter than the new established
 length.
 
 805.09 Determination of Bearing Values. The bearing capacity
 of piles will be determined by the Engineer as provided in the
 Contract by one or a combination of the following methods.
 Method A, Empirical Pile Formulas, will be used unless otherwise
 specified. At any time, the Engineer may direct that driving be
 discontinued to prevent damage to a pile.
 (a) Method A -- Empirical Pile Formulas. The safe bearing
 values for piles will be determined by the following formulas:

 805
 Where:
 P = safe bearing value in pounds (kilonewtons),
 W = weight, in pounds (kilograms), of striking parts of hammer,
 H = height of fall (stroke) in feet (mm),
 S = the average penetration in inches (mm) per blow for the last
 5-10 blows for gravity hammers and the last 10-20 blows for
 power hammers, and
 E = equivalent energy per blow in foot-pounds (joules).
 The above formulas are applicable only when:
 1) The hammer has a free fall.
 2) The head of the pile is not broomed or crushed.
 3) The penetration is reasonably quick and uniform.
 4) There is no detectable bounce of the hammer after the blow.
 5) A follower is not used.
 For a test pile, the penetration per blow shall be measured during
 initial driving. For piling other than test piling, the penetration per
 blow shall be measured either during initial driving or during
 redriving. Redriving, when allowed, shall be with a warmed-up
 hammer operated at full energy after a pile set period, as determined
 by the Engineer. A warmed-up hammer is defined as a hammer
 that has applied at least 20 blows to another pile immediately before
 being used.
 If bounce is detected, twice the height of the bounce of the
 hammer shall be deducted from "H" to determine its value in the
 formulas.
 When a double acting steam or air hammer is used, the
 Contractor shall furnish tables from the manufacturer to equate the
 operating speed to equivalent energy. The equivalent energy used in
 calculating the safe bearing value shall not exceed 85% of the
 manufacturer's maximum energy rating.
 When water jets are used in connection with the driving, the
 bearing value shall be determined by the above formulas from the
 results of driving after the jets have been withdrawn.
 The character of the soil penetrated; conditions of driving;
 distributions, sizes, lengths, and weights of piles driven; and the
 computed load on the pile shall also be considered in determining
 the safe bearing value.
 745
 
 805
 (1) Test Piles. The required safe bearing value shall be
 considered to have been obtained when the value remains at or
 above the specified value throughout the last 5 feet (1.5 m) of
 driving. Driving shall continue until the top of the pile is at plan
 grade unless practical refusal has been reached or damage to the pile
 is imminent. Practical refusal for test piles occurs when the
 calculated safe bearing value is three times the required safe bearing
 value. In no case shall the pile be driven less than that specified in
 Subsection 805.08(e).
 (2) Piling. Piling shall be driven until the required safe
 bearing is obtained. Driving shall continue until the top of the pile
 is at plan grade unless practical refusal has been reached or damage
 to the pile is imminent. The required safe bearing value shall be
 considered to have been obtained when the safe bearing value has
 been maintained for at least 5 feet (1.5 m). Practical refusal for
 production piling occurs when the calculated safe bearing value is
 two times the required safe bearing value. In no case shall the pile
 be driven less than that specified in Subsection 805.08(e).
 If the required safe bearing value has not been obtained when the
 top of the pile is at plan grade, the pile shall be driven until one of
 the following conditions has been satisfied as approved by the
 Engineer:
 Soil may be excavated from around the pile, if necessary, and
 the pile driven until the required safe bearing has been
 obtained. Such excavation will not be paid for separately, but
 full compensation therefor will be considered included in the
 contract unit price bid for Steel Piling, Steel Shell Piling, or
 Concrete Piling.
 • The pile shall be built-up and driven until the required safe
 bearing has been obtained. Measurement and payment for
 build-up will be made under Subsections 805.14 and 805.15.
 •
 
 (b) Method B -- Wave Equation Analysis (WEAP). The
 ultimate bearing capacity of a pile will be determined by using a
 Wave Equation Analysis. Soil, pile, and driving equipment
 properties to be used in this analysis will be determined by the
 Engineer using data obtained from the Contractor, test borings, and
 the plans.
 Driving equipment shall comply with the requirements of
 Subsection 805.07.
 746
 
 805
 Based on the Wave Equation Analysis, the Engineer will provide
 a bearing graph that shows a hammer blow count relationship for the
 required ultimate bearing capacity. Depending on the type hammer
 used, the bearing graph will be one of the following types: 1) stroke
 vs. blow count; 2) bounce chamber pressure vs. blow count; or 3)
 capacity vs. blow count.
 The design bearing capacity of a pile shall be 0.364 of the
 calculated ultimate bearing capacity as determined from a Wave
 Equation Analysis.
 From the beginning of driving until the end of driving, the
 Engineer will measure the stroke and/or chamber pressure and count
 the number of hammer blows in 12" (300 mm) increments.
 Measurement of stroke and/or chamber pressure will not be required
 when a capacity vs. blow count type bearing graph is used.
 (1) Test Piles. Test piles shall be driven using driving
 equipment established by the Wave Equation Analysis before other
 piles are ordered or driven.
 Test piles shall be driven until: 1) the required ultimate bearing
 capacity or greater, as determined by the bearing graph, has been
 obtained for 3 feet (1.0 m); and 2) the top of the pile is at plan grade;
 but not to more than when 3) a hammer blow count of 20 blows per
 1 inch (25 mm) has been obtained. In no case shall the pile be driven
 less than that specified in Subsection 805.08(e).
 If the test pile has been driven to plan grade and has not satisfied
 conditions required to cease driving, the Engineer may direct the
 Contractor to excavate around a concrete pile to below plan grade to
 facilitate additional driving and testing in order to satisfy conditions
 required to cease driving. Steel piles shall be built-up and driving
 continued. The excavation or build-up and additional driving must
 be completed during the same day as the initial driving. The
 excavation will not be paid for separately, but full compensation
 therefor will be considered included in the contract unit price bid for
 Test Pile.
 If the conditions to cease driving on a concrete test pile are not
 obtained with the excavation and additional driving, or if additional
 excavation is not allowed by the Engineer, the pile will be
 considered an unsuccessful test pile and the Engineer shall order a
 new test pile be driven. The length and location of the new test pile
 shall be determined by the Engineer.
 747
 
 805
 The unsuccessful test pile shall be paid for at the contract unit
 price bid for Test Pile, and shall be built-up and driven to meet the
 requirements for piling as specified in Subsection 805.09(b)(2).
 Payment for the build-up will be made at the unit price bid for
 Concrete Piling.
 The new test pile will be paid for at the contract unit price bid for
 Test Pile. Payment for build-up of a successful test pile will be
 made at the contract unit price for Test Pile.
 (2) Piling. Except as noted herein, piling shall be driven
 continuously until: 1) the required ultimate bearing capacity or
 greater, as determined by bearing graph, has been obtained; and
 2) the top of the pile is at plan grade; but not to more than when 3) a
 hammer blow count of 20 blows per 1 inch (25 mm) has been
 obtained. In no case shall the pile be driven less than that specified
 in Subsection 805.08(e). Steel piling shall be driven until: 1) the
 required ultimate bearing capacity or greater, as determined by
 bearing graph, has been obtained; but not to more than when 2) a
 hammer blow count of 20 blows per 1 inch (25 mm) has been
 obtained. If directed by the Engineer, the top of the pile shall be
 driven to plan grade. In no case shall the pile be driven less than
 that specified in subsection 805.08(e).
 If the required ultimate bearing capacity has not been obtained
 when the top of the pile is 6" (150 mm) above the plan grade, the
 pile shall be driven until one of the following conditions has been
 satisfied as approved by the Engineer:
 •
 
 Soil may be excavated from around the pile, if
 necessary, and the pile driven until the required ultimate
 bearing capacity has been obtained. Such excavation
 will not be paid for separately, but full compensation
 therefor will be considered included in the contract unit
 price bid for Steel Piling, Steel Shell Piling, or Concrete
 Piling.
 
 •
 
 The pile shall be built-up and driven until the required
 ultimate capacity has been obtained. Measurement and
 payment for build-up will be made under
 Subsections 805.14 and 805.15.
 
 •
 
 After a 24 hour waiting period, the pile shall be struck
 with 20 blows from a warmed-up hammer and the
 penetration measured to determine if the required
 748
 
 805
 ultimate bearing capacity has been obtained. A warmedup hammer is defined as a hammer that has applied at
 least 20 blows to a pile immediately before being used.
 If this option is selected, initial driving shall cease when
 the top of the pile is 6" (150 mm) above the plan grade.
 An allowance of 3 linear feet (1 m) of piling will be
 made for each pile struck with the warmed-up hammer
 in addition to the actual length of accepted pile in place.
 (c) Method C -- Dynamic Load Test. This subsection outlines
 the dynamic testing procedures to be used on the test piles indicated
 on the plans to establish a bearing graph that shows a hammer blow
 count relationship for 90% and 100% of the required ultimate
 bearing capacity for piling. The design bearing capacity of a pile
 shall be 0.40 of the ultimate bearing capacity as determined by
 dynamic testing.
 (1) General.
 The Contractor shall employ a specialty
 engineering firm experienced in the use of the wave equation
 analysis of piles computer program (WEAP), dynamic testing using
 the Case method, a pile driving analyzer (PDA), and the Case Pile
 Wave Analysis Program - Continuous Model (CAPWAPC) to
 perform the dynamic testing on the test pile. This firm shall furnish
 all equipment and make the analysis as outlined in this subsection.
 A written report as specified in ASTM D 4945 shall be furnished
 to the Engineer showing the results and conclusions from the test.
 The report shall be submitted promptly to allow ample time for the
 Department to consider its contents and establish the bearing graph
 for the required ultimate bearing capacity. PDA field results for at
 least every other blow shall be included in the written report for the
 complete driving of the test pile.
 (2) Driving Equipment. The driving equipment shall meet
 the requirements of Subsection 805.07. Driving equipment meeting
 the requirements of a successful dynamic load test on the test piles
 indicated on the plans will be considered acceptable for use on all
 test piling and piling for bridge site(s) or substructure units specified
 on the plans.
 If dynamic testing indicates the driving equipment is not
 acceptable on the first test pile driven with the proposed driving
 equipment, the Contractor shall drive a new test pile in that bent
 with a different pile driver using dynamic testing as outlined herein.
 749
 
 805
 The length and location of the new test pile shall be determined by
 the Engineer. The new test pile driven with acceptable driving
 equipment will be paid for at the contract unit price bid for Test Pile
 and dynamic testing will be paid for at the contract unit price bid for
 Dynamic Pile Load Test.
 The test pile driven with unacceptable driving equipment will be
 paid for at the contract unit price bid for Test Pile and the dynamic
 testing will be paid for at 50% of the contract unit price bid for
 Dynamic Pile Load Test. This test pile shall be built-up, if required,
 and driven to meet the requirements for piling as specified in
 Subsection 805.09(c)(8). Payment for the build-up will be based on
 the unit price bid for Steel Piling, Steel Shell Piling, or Concrete
 Piling, as the case may be.
 (3) Wave Equation Analysis. Before driving, a wave
 equation analysis is required on all test piles used to check the
 acceptability of the driving equipment.
 The above data will be used to determine the adequacy of the
 hammer, the axial stresses in the pile, and the required number of
 blows per unit of penetration the hammer must deliver to obtain the
 required ultimate bearing capacity.
 This will be determined by the specialty engineering firm and
 furnished to the Engineer in the form of bearing graphs. The
 Contractor will be notified of the acceptance or rejection of the
 graphs within seven business days of their receipt by the Engineer.
 No test piles shall be driven before the graphs are approved by the
 Engineer.
 After evaluation by the wave equation, any changes in the driving
 equipment may require reevaluation, but in all cases such changes
 shall be approved by the Engineer before driving.
 (4) Dynamic Pile Load Test. The Contractor shall drive test
 piles requiring dynamic testing at locations indicated on the plans
 using driving equipment established by the wave equation analysis,
 subject to change due to actual hammer performance and soil
 strength change. Dynamic testing shall be performed on the test pile
 during driving and shall comply with ASTM D 4945. Pile driving
 shall cease when dynamic testing indicates: 1) the required ultimate
 bearing capacity or greater has been maintained for 3 feet (1 m); and
 2) when the top of the pile is at plan grade; but not to more than
 when 3) a hammer blow count of 20 blows per 1 inch (25 mm) has
 750
 
 805
 been obtained. In no case shall the pile be driven less than that
 specified in Subsection 805.08(e).
 The Engineer will measure the stroke and/or chamber pressure
 and count the number of hammer blows in 12" (300 mm) increments
 from the beginning of driving until the required ultimate bearing
 capacity is first obtained and in 3" (75 mm) increments for the
 remainder of driving. Measurement of stroke and/or chamber
 pressure will not be required when a capacity vs. blow count type
 bearing graph is used. Approval of the driving equipment shall be
 based on the average blow count per 1 inch (25 mm) measured for
 the first 3" (75 mm) increment where the required ultimate bearing
 capacity has been maintained by the PDA. Also, the CAPWAPC
 analysis must indicate a capacity at least 90% of the required
 ultimate bearing capacity.
 If the test pile has been driven to plan grade and has not satisfied
 conditions required to cease driving, the Engineer may direct the
 Contractor to excavate around a concrete pile to below plan grade to
 facilitate additional driving and testing in order to satisfy conditions
 required to cease driving. Steel piles shall be built-up and driving
 continued. The excavation or build-up and additional driving must
 be completed during the same day as the initial driving. The
 excavation will not be paid for separately, but full compensation
 therefor will be considered included in the contract unit price bid for
 Test Pile. The additional driving and testing will not be considered
 a successive dynamic pile load test but a continuation of the initial
 drive.
 If the conditions to cease driving on a concrete test pile are not
 obtained with the excavation and additional driving, or if additional
 excavation is not allowed by the Engineer, the pile will be
 considered an unsuccessful test pile and the Engineer shall order a
 new test pile be driven with dynamic testing. The length and
 location of the new test pile shall be determined by the Engineer.
 The unsuccessful test pile shall be paid for at the contract unit
 price bid for Test Pile, and shall be built-up and driven to meet the
 requirements for piling as specified in Subsection 805.09(c)(8).
 Payment for the build-up will be made at the unit price bid for
 Concrete Piling. Dynamic testing for the unsuccessful test pile will
 be paid for at the contract unit price bid for Dynamic Pile Load Test.
 
 751
 
 805
 The new test pile will be paid for at the contract unit price bid for
 Test Pile. Dynamic testing for the new test pile will be paid for at
 the contract unit price bid for Dynamic Pile Load Test. Payment for
 build-up of a successful test pile will be made at the contract unit
 price for Test Pile.
 The Case method using a PDA shall be used to evaluate hammer
 and driving system performance, pile driving stresses, pile structural
 integrity, and pile bearing capacity.
 If necessary, the Contractor shall reduce the driving energy
 transmitted to the pile by using additional cushions or reducing the
 energy of the hammer in order to obtain acceptable stresses in the
 pile as specified in Subsection 805.07. If non-axial driving is
 indicated by dynamic test measurements, the Contractor shall
 immediately realign the driving system.
 (5) CAPWAPC Analysis. The CAPWAPC analysis made
 after driving shall be used to predict the test pile's static bearing
 capacity and resistance distribution. This information shall be used
 to check Case method assumptions and to indicate the distribution of
 soil static resistance, quakes, and damping factors required for a
 wave equation analysis.
 A CAPWAPC analysis will be required for each test pile
 requiring dynamic testing. The blow for a CAPWAPC analysis
 shall be selected from the last blows in the first 3" (75 mm)
 increment where the required ultimate bearing capacity was
 maintained by PDA. If the CAPWAPC analysis indicates an
 ultimate bearing capacity less than 90% of the required ultimate
 bearing capacity, a blow shall be selected from the last blows for
 each successive 3" (75 mm) increment for a CAPWAPC analysis
 until 90% of the required ultimate bearing capacity is obtained.
 If the CAPWAPC analysis still indicates a bearing capacity less
 than 90% of the required ultimate bearing capacity at the point
 where driving was stopped, the test pile shall be driven until one of
 the following conditions has been satisfied: 1) the pile shall be
 driven a minimum of 2' (0.6 m) additional, or deeper, to obtain the
 required ultimate bearing capacity; or 2) after waiting up to 24 hours
 and after the first 20 blows of the hammer, the bearing capacity shall
 be determined based on 1 inch (25 mm) of penetration or 20 blows
 of the hammer, whichever occurs first. Dynamic testing and a
 CAPWAPC analysis will be required during the redriving and will
 752
 
 805
 be considered a successive dynamic pile load test. If necessary, the
 soil may be excavated from around the pile below plan grade, as
 approved by the Engineer, to facilitate driving and testing.
 After a CAPWAPC analysis has been made at the end of driving
 a test pile, the Specialty Engineering firm shall establish a hammer
 blow count relationship for the required ultimate bearing capacity.
 A bearing graph shall be provided that shows the relationship for
 90% and 100% for the required ultimate bearing capacity for piling.
 Depending on the type of hammer used, the bearing graph shall be
 one of the following types: 1) stroke vs. blow count; 2) bounce
 chamber pressure vs. blow count; or 3) capacity vs. blow count.
 This information shall be developed using the refined wave equation
 (WEAP) with input data obtained from the CAPWAPC analysis.
 (6) Successful Dynamic Load Test. A successful dynamic
 load test is one where: 1) the test pile has been driven with
 acceptable driving equipment to the proper length; and 2) at least
 100% of the required ultimate bearing capacity as determined by
 dynamic testing and at least 90% of the required ultimate bearing
 capacity as verified by the CAPWAPC analysis has been obtained.
 (7) Test Piling not Requiring Dynamic Testing. Test piles
 not requiring dynamic testing shall be driven until: 1) the required
 ultimate bearing capacity or greater, as established by the bearing
 graph, has been maintained for 3 feet (1.0 m); and 2) the top of the
 pile is at plan grade; but not to more than when 3) a hammer blow
 count of 20 blows per 1 inch (25 mm) has been obtained. In no case
 shall the pile be driven less than that specified in Subsection
 805.08(e).
 If the top of a test pile has been driven to plan grade and has not
 satisfied conditions required to cease driving, the Engineer may
 direct the Contractor to excavate around a concrete pile to below
 plan grade to facilitate additional driving and testing in order to
 satisfy conditions required to cease driving. Steel piles shall be
 built-up and driving continued. The excavation or build-up and
 additional driving must be completed during the same day as the
 initial driving. The excavation will not be paid for separately, but
 full compensation therefor will be considered included in the
 contract unit price bid for Test Pile.
 If the conditions to cease driving on a concrete test pile are not
 obtained with the excavation and additional driving, or if additional
 753
 
 805
 excavation is not allowed by the Engineer, the pile will be
 considered an unsuccessful test pile and the Engineer shall order a
 new test pile be driven. The length and location of the new test pile
 shall be determined by the Engineer.
 The unsuccessful test pile shall be paid for at the contract unit
 price bid for Test Pile, and shall be built-up and driven to meet the
 requirements for piling as specified in Subsection 805.09(c)(8).
 Payment for the build-up will be made at the unit price bid for
 Concrete Piling.
 The new test pile will be paid for at the contract unit price bid for
 Test Pile. Payment for build-up of a successful test pile will be
 made at the contract unit price for Test Pile.
 The Engineer will observe all pile driving from beginning to end.
 Before the pile obtains the required ultimate bearing capacity, the
 Engineer will measure the stroke and/or chamber pressure and count
 the number of hammer blows in 12" (300 mm) increments.
 Measurement of stroke and/or chamber pressure will not be required
 when a capacity vs. blow count type bearing graph is used.
 (8) Piling. Piling shall be driven continuously until: 1) at least
 90% of the required ultimate bearing capacity, as determined by the
 bearing graph, has been obtained; and 2) the top of the pile is at plan
 grade but not to more than when 3) a hammer blow count of 20
 blows per 1 inch (25 mm) has been obtained. In no case shall the
 pile be driven less than that specified in Subsection 805.08(e).
 If 90% of the required ultimate bearing capacity has not been
 obtained when the top of the pile is 6" (150 mm) above the plan
 grade, the pile shall be driven until one of the following conditions
 has been satisfied as approved by the Engineer:
 •
 
 Soil may be excavated from around the pile and the pile
 driven until at least 90% of the required ultimate bearing
 capacity has been obtained. The excavation will not be
 paid for separately, but full compensation therefor will
 be considered included in the contract unit price bid for
 Steel Piling, Steel Shell Piling, or Concrete Piling.
 
 •
 
 After a 24 hour waiting period, the pile shall be struck
 with 20 blows from a warmed-up hammer. The results
 from the re-strike will be used to ascertain if at least
 90% of the required ultimate bearing capacity, as
 754
 
 805
 determined by the bearing graph, has been obtained. A
 warmed-up hammer is defined as a hammer that has
 applied at least 20 blows to a pile immediately before
 being used.
 If this option is selected, initial driving shall cease when
 the top of the pile is 6" (150 mm) above the plan grade.
 An allowance of 3 linear feet (1.0 m) of piling will be
 made for each pile struck with the warmed up hammer
 in addition to the actual length of accepted pile in place.
 •
 
 The pile shall be built-up and driven until at least 90%
 of the required ultimate capacity has been obtained.
 
 The Engineer will observe all pile driving from beginning to end.
 Before the pile obtains the required ultimate bearing capacity, the
 Engineer will measure the stroke and/or chamber pressure and count
 the number of blows in 12" (300 mm) increments. Measurement of
 stroke and/or chamber pressure will not be required when a capacity
 vs. blow count type bearing graph is used.
 805.10 Order Lists for Piling. The Contractor shall furnish
 piles according to an itemized list, which will be furnished by the
 Engineer, except as otherwise provided in Subsection 805.02,
 showing the number and length of piles. In determining lengths of
 piles for ordering and for quantities to be included in the Contract,
 the lengths given in the order list shall be based on the lengths that
 are assumed to remain in the completed structure. If the minimum
 bearing is not attained with the length of piling established by the
 Engineer, the Engineer will establish the length of pile build-up.
 The Contractor may, at no cost to the Department, increase the
 lengths given to provide for fresh heading and for such additional
 length as may be necessary to suit the Contractor's method of
 operation.
 805.11 Cut-off and Build-up of Piles. (a) Steel and Steel Shell
 Piles. After the pile has been driven to the minimum specified
 penetration and bearing resistance, it shall be driven, cut off, or built
 up, as necessary, to bring the finished top to plan grade. When the
 full approved pile length has been driven without attaining minimum
 bearing, the length of build-up shall be according to
 Subsection 805.10.
 Cut-offs shall be made with a cutting torch or other acceptable
 method that will produce the desired smooth, level end of pile at the
 755
 
 805
 proper elevation. Build-ups shall be made by welding a splice on a
 section of pile in such manner as to fully develop the section of the
 pile according to the plans. Welding shall comply with Subsection
 805.03(f).
 Where the top of the pile is appreciably deformed or otherwise
 damaged below plan grade, the damaged portion shall be cut off and
 replaced with a new section spliced in place. No additional
 compensation will be allowed for the material and work for this
 replacement.
 (b) Concrete Piles. After the pile has been driven to the
 minimum specified penetration and bearing resistance, it shall be
 driven, cut off, or built up, as necessary, to bring the finished top to
 plan grade. When the full approved pile length has been driven
 without attaining minimum bearing, the pile shall be built up
 according to Subsection 805.10.
 Cut-offs shall be accomplished by methods that will produce the
 desired end of pile at the proper elevation. The use of explosives to
 accomplish cut-off will not be allowed. Cut-off material shall not be
 used as piling but shall be disposed of according to Section 201.
 When build-up is required, the concrete at the end of the pile
 shall be cut away leaving the reinforcing steel exposed for a length
 as shown on the plans. The final cut of the concrete shall be
 perpendicular to the axis of the pile. Reinforcement, as required by
 the plans, shall be securely fastened to the projecting steel and the
 necessary form work shall be placed, care being taken to prevent
 leakage along the pile. Prestressed piles may be built up using
 reinforcing shown for precast piles of the same size or an equivalent
 area of steel. The concrete used for the build-up shall comply with
 Section 802 for Class S(AE) concrete. Just before placing concrete,
 the top of the pile shall be thoroughly wetted and covered with a thin
 coating of neat cement, mortar, or other suitable bonding material.
 The forms shall remain in place a minimum of 24 hours, then
 carefully removed and the entire build-up finished and cured
 according to Subsection 805.04.
 805.12 Pile Encasement When specified on the plans, a
 reinforced concrete encasement shall be placed around a driven steel
 pile. The encasement shall be constructed according to the details
 and at the locations shown on the plans. Lengths of pile encasement
 756
 
 805
 may be adjusted by the Engineer to fit the conditions at the time of
 construction.
 The materials and construction requirements for this item shall
 comply with Section 802 and Section 804 for concrete and
 reinforcing steel respectively. The encased portion of a pile will not
 require painting.
 805.13 Filling Steel Shell Piles. After driving and splicing is
 completed, the steel shell shall be free of buckles, water, and other
 foreign matter, and shall be of required shape and dimensions before
 filling with concrete. The Contractor shall provide electric lights
 that may be lowered into the shell, mirrors, and other equipment and
 facilities necessary for the proper inspection of the shells. The tops
 of the shells shall be kept covered after inspection until placement of
 the concrete begins.
 Concrete shall be placed in each shell in a single continuous
 operation with the flow of concrete directed down the center of the
 shell so as to consolidate the concrete by impact. The use of a
 tremie will not be required. Vibration or rodding of concrete will
 only be required to a depth of 5' (1.5 m) below the top of the shell.
 Placement of concrete shall continue after the shell is full until good
 quality concrete is evident at the top of the shell. The concrete shall
 be struck off flush with the top of the shell and finished to a smooth
 surface.
 805.14 Method of Measurement. (a) General. Steel Piling,
 Steel Shell Piling, Concrete Piling, and Test Piles will be measured
 by the actual number of linear feet (meters) of accepted pile
 remaining in the finished structure after build-ups and/or cut-offs
 have been made, based upon lengths shown on the plans or
 established by the Engineer.
 (b) Cut-off and Build-up. Allowance for pile cut-off, where
 piles have been furnished or built up according to the lengths shown
 on the plans or established by the Engineer, will be as follows:
 Steel Piles
 50% of cut-off length, plus 1 foot (0.3 m)
 Concrete Piles
 50% of cut-off length, plus 3 feet (1 m)
 No allowance for cut-off will be made on piling for any length in
 excess of the lengths shown on the plans or established by the
 Engineer.
 
 757
 
 805
 For piles furnished according to the lengths shown on the plans
 or established by the Engineer that are found to be too short and are
 spliced according to these specifications, an allowance of 3 linear
 feet (1 m) of piling will be made for each steel pile splice and 6
 linear feet (2 m) for each concrete pile splice in addition to the
 actual length of accepted pile in place.
 No allowance will be made for cut-off or build-up in any portion
 of a pile that has been damaged, for splices made for the
 convenience of the Contractor, for extra length ordered for the
 Contractor's convenience, or for cutback necessary for splicing.
 Cut-off material shall be the property and responsibility of the
 Contractor.

 length for steel piling established according to Subsection 805.10 is
 greater than 60' (18 m), the Contractor may, at his option:
 1) Furnish a pile that is spliced to obtain the specified
 order length. An allowance of 3 linear feet (1 m) will
 be made for this spliced pile in addition to the actual
 length of the pile furnished; or
 2) Furnish an un-spliced pile of the specified order
 length.
 For either of the above options, cut-off and/or additional build-up
 will be measured according to Subsection 805.14(b).

 furnished size may be used without further color coding provided
 that the heat number and color code remain legible. Pieces for
 secondary members that are cut to smaller sizes shall, before cutting,
 be legibly marked with the identification color code. Pieces that are
 furnished in tagged lifts or bundles shall be marked with the
 identification color code immediately upon being removed from the
 lift or bundle.
 Pieces of steel that, prior to assembling into members, will be
 subjected to fabricating operations such as blast cleaning,
 galvanizing, heating, or painting which may obliterate the
 identification color code or heat number shall be marked by steel die
 stamping or by a substantial tag firmly attached. If steel die
 stamping is used, it shall be the low stress type and high stress areas
 of the pieces shall be avoided.
 The Contractor may furnish material from stock for secondary
 members if the material can be identified by heat number and mill
 test report.

 operators approved by the Engineer, except that shop or field
 applied stud shear connectors welded using automatically timed stud
 welding equipment shall be accomplished by operators qualified
 according to Section 7 of the AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding
 Code.
 The Engineer will consider a welder/welder operator qualified if
 (1) the requirements of the standard qualification procedure of
 Section 5 of the AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code are
 met, or (2) the Contractor provides a copy of the individual welder’s
 certified test report issued by an agency or authority on the
 Department’s Qualified Products List and the Contractor provides a
 certified statement of qualification for each welder stating that the
 welder has been doing satisfactory welding of the required type
 within the six month period prior to beginning work on the subject
 project. The certified statement of qualification will not be required
 during the six month period following a welder’s initial testing at a
 QPL listed agency.
 The certified test report issued by the agency or authority
 recognized by the Department shall contain the name of the
 welder/welder operator, the name and title of the person who
 conducted the examination, the kind of specimens, the position of
 welds, the results of the tests, and the date of examination. Reexamination/re-certification will be required if welding of the
 required type has not been performed in the six month period prior
 to beginning work on the subject project.
 In lieu of a certification for each project, the fabrication shop may
 submit an updated list of qualified welders/welder operators
 annually to the Materials Engineer. Addendum or additions to this
 list, along with the appropriate welder/welder operator certification,
 shall be submitted in a timely manner.
 The approval and use of consumable welding materials shall be
 according to the Department's Manual of Field Sampling and
 Testing Procedures.
 (b) Modification of Structural Welding Code. The following
 changes and modifications to the AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge
 Welding Code shall be made:
 779
 
 807
 (1) Subparagraph 1.3.2 is modified to include:
 Electroslag welding shall not be used as a welding process on
 bridge structures.
 (2) Subparagraph 3.2.1 is expanded to include:
 Surfaces on which flange-to-web welds are made shall be
 cleaned in the immediate weld area by power wire wheel
 brushing, grinding, or other methods approved by the Engineer.
 (3) Section 6, Part B, Radiographic Testing of Groove Welds
 in Butt Joints is expanded to include:
 Edge blocks shall be used when radiographing butt welds
 greater than 1/2" (12 mm) thickness. The edge blocks shall have
 a length sufficient to extend beyond each side of the weld
 centerline for a minimum distance equal to the weld thickness,
 but no less than 2" (50 mm), and shall have a thickness equal to
 or greater than the thickness of the weld. The minimum width of
 the edge blocks shall be equal to half the weld thickness, but not
 less than 1" (25 mm). The edge blocks shall be centered on the
 weld with a snug fit against the plate being radiographed,
 allowing no more than 1/16" (1.5 mm) gap. Edge blocks shall be
 made of radiographically clean steel and the surface shall have a
 finish of 0.12 mils (3 µm) or smoother.
 (4) Subparagraph 6.7.1 is modified as follows:
 All complete joint penetration groove welds in butt joints in
 main members shall be examined by radiographic testing, except
 as provided in 6.7.1.2 (2)(d).
 (5) Subparagraph 6.7.1.2(2) is amended as follows:
 Twenty-five percent of each joint subject to compression or
 shear.
 (6) Section 7, Stud Welding-Inspection Requirements is
 expanded to include:
 A minimum of 5% but not less than 5 studs on each member
 shall be tested by being struck with a hammer and bent 15° off
 vertical. Additionally, any stud that by visual inspection does not
 show a full 360° weld, has been repaired by welding, or has an
 abnormal reduction in height due to welding shall be tested in the
 same manner. Where applicable, the direction of bending shall
 780
 
 807
 be opposite to the lack of weld. Studs that crack either in the
 weld or the shank after bending shall be replaced.
 The remaining studs not subjected to the bend test shall be
 struck forcibly with a hammer. Any stud that does not yield a
 solid ringing sound shall be tested according to the above
 prescribed procedure.
 The Engineer may select additional studs to be subjected to
 the bend test specified above. A visual inspection of the studs
 and welds shall be made by the Engineer prior to placement of
 the concrete deck slab. Any damage that may have occurred
 during shipment and erection shall be satisfactorily repaired.
 All tests on studs shall be performed by the Contractor in the
 presence of an authorized representative of the Department.
 If, during the progress of the work, inspection and testing
 indicates that the studs are unsatisfactory, the Contractor shall be
 required, at no cost to the Department, to make such necessary
 changes in welding procedure, welding equipment, and/or type of
 studs as necessary to secure satisfactory results.
 807.27 Straightening Rolled Material. Rolled material must be
 straight before being laid off or worked. Bends and distortions may
 be cause for rejection. If straightening is necessary and approved by
 the Engineer, it shall be accomplished by using methods that will
 not damage the metal. Heat straightening of materials other than
 Grade 100 (690) may be accomplished by careful application of
 localized heat. The temperature of the heated area shall not exceed
 1150° F (620° C).
 Heat straightening of Grade 100 (690) steel shall be
 accomplished only under rigidly controlled procedures. Each
 application shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer and in no
 case shall the maximum temperature of the steel exceed 1100° F
 (590° C).
 Materials shall not be artificially cooled, except by forced air,
 until after the metal has cooled to 600° F (320° C). Below 600° F
 (320° C) the material may be cooled by forced air or mist, but may
 not be submerged in liquid or sprayed with liquid.
 807.28 Curving Rolled Beams and Welded Girders.
 (a) Materials. Steels that are manufactured to a specified minimum
 yield point greater than 50,000 psi (345 MPa) shall not be heat
 curved.
 781
 
 807
 (b) Type of Heating. Beams and girders may be curved by
 either continuous or V-type heating as approved by the Engineer.
 For the continuous method, a strip along the edge of the top and
 bottom flange shall be heated simultaneously. The strip shall be of
 sufficient width and temperature to obtain the required curvature.
 For the V-type heating, the top and bottom flanges shall be heated in
 truncated triangular or wedge-shaped areas having their base along
 the flange edge and spaced at regular intervals along each flange.
 The spacing and temperature shall be as required to obtain the
 required curvature, and heating shall progress along the top and
 bottom flange at approximately the same rate.
 For the V-type heating, the apex of the truncated triangular area
 applied to the inside flange surface shall terminate just before the
 juncture of the web and the flange is reached. To avoid unnecessary
 web distortion, special care shall be taken when heating the inside
 flange surfaces so that heat is not applied directly to the web. When
 the radius of curvature is 1000' (300 m) or more, the apex of the
 truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange
 surface shall extend to the juncture of the flange and web. When the
 radius of curvature is less than 1000' (300 m), the apex of the
 truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange
 surface shall extend past the web for a distance equal to 1/8 of the
 flange width or 3" (75 mm), whichever is less. The truncated
 triangular pattern shall have an included angle of approximately 15°30°, but the base of the triangle shall not exceed 10" (250 mm).
 Variations in the patterns prescribed above may be made with the
 approval of the Engineer.
 For both types of heating, the flange edges to be heated are those
 that will be on the inside of the horizontal curve. Heating both
 inside and outside flange surfaces is only mandatory when the
 flange thickness is 1¼" (32 mm) or greater, in which case the two
 surfaces shall be heated concurrently. The maximum temperature
 shall be as prescribed below.
 (c) Temperature. The heat-curving operation shall be conducted
 in such a manner that the temperature of the steel does not exceed
 1150° F (620° C) as measured by temperature-indicating crayons or
 other suitable means. Beams and girders shall not be artificially
 cooled except as permitted in Subsection 807.27.
 (d) Position for Heating. The beam or girder may be heatcurved with the web in either a vertical or a horizontal position.
 782
 
 807
 When curved in the vertical position, the member must be braced or
 supported in such a manner that the tendency of the girder to deflect
 laterally during the heat-curving process will not cause the girder to
 overturn.
 When curved in the horizontal position, the beam or girder must
 be supported near its ends and at intermediate points, if required, to
 obtain a uniform curvature. The bending stress in the flanges due to
 the dead weight of the member must not exceed the usual allowable
 design stress. When the member is positioned horizontally for
 heating, intermediate safety catch blocks must be maintained at the
 mid length of the member within 2" (50 mm) of the flanges at all
 times during the heating process to guard against a sudden sag due
 to plastic flange buckling.
 (e) Sequence of Operations. The beam or girder shall be heatcurved in the fabrication shop before it is painted. The heat curving
 operation may be conducted either before or after all the required
 welding of transverse intermediate stiffeners is completed.
 However, unless provisions are made for member shrinkage, full
 depth connection plates and bearing stiffeners shall be located and
 attached after heat curving. If longitudinal stiffeners are required,
 they shall be heat-curved or oxygen-cut separately and then welded
 to the curved member. When cover plates are to be attached to
 rolled beams, they may be attached before heat curving if the total
 thickness of one flange and cover plate is less than 1½" (38 mm) and
 the radius of curvature is greater than 1000' (300 m). For other
 rolled beams with cover plates, the beams must be heat-curved
 before the cover plates are attached. Cover plates must be either
 heat curved or oxygen-cut separately, then welded to the curved
 beam.
 (f) Camber. Beams and girders shall be cambered before heat
 curving, as the heat curving process may tend to change the vertical
 camber present. This effect will be most pronounced when the top
 and bottom flanges are of unequal widths on a given transverse cross
 section. Subject to the approval of the Engineer, moderate
 deviations from specified vertical camber may be corrected by a
 carefully supervised application of heat.
 (g) Measurement of Curvature. Horizontal curvature shall not
 be measured for final acceptance until all welding and heating
 operations are completed and the flanges have cooled to a uniform
 temperature. Horizontal curvature shall be checked with the beam
 783
 
 807
 or girder in the vertical position by measuring offsets from a string
 line or wire attached to both flanges, or by other suitable means.
 The sweep of horizontally curved welded girders or rolled beams
 shall be within the following tolerances:
 For flange width less than 6" (150 mm): Tolerance= 0.025"
 (2 mm) X total length in feet (meters)
 For flange width of 6" (150 mm) or greater: Tolerance= 0.0125"
 (1 mm) X total length in feet (meters)
 807.29 Vertical Cambering of Beams and Girders. Design
 camber of welded girders shall be cut in the web plates before girder
 assembly. Allowance should be made for shrinkage due to cutting
 and welding. Small amounts of heat may be used to correct minor
 differences from specified design camber.
 Design camber shall be produced in rolled beams by mechanical
 methods and/or controlled application of heat. The size, number,
 shape, and placement of heating patterns shall be such that distortion
 is minimal and that buckling is kept within the minimum standard
 rolling tolerances for out-of-flatness of beam webs. Beams with
 severe web buckles from improper heat cambering will be rejected.
 The vertical cambering operation shall be conducted in such a
 manner that the temperature of the steel does not exceed 1150° F
 (620° C) as measured by indicating crayons or other suitable means.
 Beams and girders shall not be artificially cooled except as
 permitted in Subsection 807.27.
 Vertical camber will be measured for final acceptance to the
 nearest 1/8 inch (millimeter). Tolerance shall be ±1/4 inch (±6 mm)
 from the specified camber.
 807.30 Annealing and Stress Relieving. Structural members
 that are specified to be annealed or normalized shall have finished
 machining, boring, and straightening performed subsequent to heat
 treatment. Normalizing and full annealing shall be as defined in
 ASTM A 919.
 The temperatures shall be maintained uniformly throughout the
 furnace during the heating and cooling so that the temperature at no
 two points on the member will differ by more than 100° F (56° C) at
 any one time.
 784
 
 807
 Members of Grade 100 (690) steel shall not be annealed or
 normalized and shall be stress relieved only with the approval of the
 Engineer.
 A record of each furnace charge shall identify the pieces in the
 charge and show the temperatures and schedule actually used.
 Proper instruments, including recording pyrometers, shall be
 provided for determining the temperatures of members in the
 furnace at any time. The records of the treatment operation shall be
 available to and meet the approval of the Engineer. The holding
 temperature for stress relieving Grade 100 (690) steel shall not
 exceed 1100° F (590° C).
 Members such as bridge shoes, pedestals, or other parts that are
 built up by welding sections of plate together shall be stress
 relieved, when specified, according to the procedure in the current
 AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code.
 807.31 Facing of Bearing Surfaces. The surface finish of
 bearing or base plates and other bearing surfaces that are to come in
 contact with each other or with concrete shall meet the ANSI surface
 roughness requirements as defined in ANSI B 46.1-88, Surface
 Roughness, Waviness and Lay, Part I:
 Steel slabs......................................... ANSI 2.0 mils (RMS) [50 µm]
 Heavy plates in contact in
 shoes to be welded ...................... ANSI 1.0 mils (RMS) [25 µm]
 Milled ends of compression members, milled
 or ground ends of stiffeners
 and fillers .................................... ANSI 0.5 mils (RMS) [12 µm]

 Pins and pin holes ............................ ANSI 0.12 mils (RMS) [3 µm]
 Sliding bearings ............................... ANSI 0.12 mils (RMS) [3 µm]
 807.32 Oxygen Cutting of Structural Steel. Steel and weld
 metal may be oxygen cut provided a smooth and regular surface free
 from cracks and notches is secured, and further provided that an
 accurate profile is obtained by the use of a mechanical guide.
 Oxygen cut surfaces of members shall have corners rounded to
 1/16" (1.5 mm) radius by grinding after cutting. Hand cutting shall
 be according to the AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code
 and approved by the Engineer.
 
 785
 
 807
 Mill scale and extraneous material shall be removed from the
 torch side of Grade 100 (690) steel plates along the lines to be flame
 cut, when necessary, to preclude excessive notches.
 807.33 Orientation of Plates. Unless otherwise shown on the

 The maximum distance of the center of the first bolt hole from
 any edge shall be 8 times the thickness of the thinnest outside plate
 but shall not exceed 5" (125 mm).
 (b) Punching and Drilling. Material forming parts of a member
 composed of not more than 5 thicknesses of metal may be punched
 with holes 1/16" (1.5 mm) larger than the nominal diameter of the
 bolts whenever the thickness of the material is not greater than 3/4"
 (19 mm) for structural steel, 5/8" (16 mm) for high-strength steel, or
 1/2" (12 mm) for quenched and tempered alloy steel, unless
 subpunching and reaming is required under Subsection 807.45.
 When there are more than 5 thicknesses, or when any of the
 material is thicker than 3/4" (19 mm) for structural steel, 5/8"
 (16 mm) for high-strength steel, or 1/2" (12 mm) for quenched and
 tempered alloy steel, holes shall either be subdrilled or drilled full
 size.
 When required, holes shall be either subpunched or subdrilled
 3/16" (5 mm) smaller and, after assembling, reamed 1/16" (1.5 mm)
 larger or drilled full size to 1/16" (1.5 mm) larger than the nominal
 diameter of the bolts.
 Improper matching of holes will be cause for rejection.
 807.43 Punched Holes. The diameter of the die for hole
 punching shall not exceed the diameter of the punch by more than
 1/16" (1.5 mm). Holes that must be enlarged to admit the bolts shall
 be reamed. Holes must be clean cut without torn or ragged edges.
 807.44 Reamed or Drilled Holes. Where practicable, reamers
 shall be directed by mechanical means. Burrs on the outside
 surfaces shall be removed.
 Reaming and drilling shall be accomplished with twist drills. If
 required by the Engineer, assembled parts shall be dismantled for
 removal of burrs. Connecting parts requiring reamed or drilled
 789
 
 807
 holes shall be assembled and securely held while being reamed or
 drilled and shall be match marked before disassembling.
 807.45 Subpunching, Subdrilling, and Reaming of Holes for
 Field Connections. Holes for all field connections of main
 members shall be subpunched or subdrilled and subsequently
 reamed while assembled, or reamed using a steel template, as
 required by Subsection 807.54. Automatically controlled drilling
 may be used for splice plates and for one side of main member
 connections. The splice plate shall be used as a template to drill the
 opposite side of the main member connection while assembled.
 Holes for floor beam and stringer end connections shall be
 subpunched or subdrilled and reamed using a steel template, or
 reamed while assembled. Reaming or drilling full size of field
 connection holes through a steel template shall be accomplished
 after the template has been accurately located and firmly bolted in
 place. Templates used for reaming matching members or the
 opposite faces of a single member shall be exact duplicates.
 Templates used for connections on like parts or members shall be
 accurately located so that the parts or members are duplicates and
 require no match-marking. Automatically controlled drilling may be
 used in lieu of using a steel template.
 Steel templates shall have hardened steel bushings in the holes
 that are accurately dimensioned from the centerlines of the
 connection as inscribed on the template. The centerlines shall be
 used in accurately locating the template from the milled or scribed
 ends of the members.
 807.46 Accuracy of Subpunched and Subdrilled Holes. Holes
 punched, subpunched, or subdrilled shall be accurately punched or
 drilled so that after assembling and before reaming, a cylindrical pin
 1/8" (3 mm) smaller in diameter than the nominal size of the hole
 may be entered perpendicular to the face of the member, without
 drifting, in at least 75% of the contiguous holes in the same plane.
 If this requirement is not fulfilled, the member will be rejected. If a
 pin 3/16" (5 mm) smaller in diameter than the nominal size of any
 hole will not pass through the hole, this will be cause for rejection.
 807.47 Accuracy of Reamed and Drilled Holes. When holes
 are reamed, drilled, or punched to full size, 85% of the holes in any
 contiguous group shall show no offset greater than 1/32" (0.8 mm)
 between adjacent thicknesses of metal.
 790
 
 807
 807.48 Bolting for Reaming. Surfaces of metal in contact shall
 be cleaned before assembling. The parts of a member shall be
 assembled and firmly drawn together with bolts before reaming
 begins. After reaming, members shall be cleaned of burrs and
 shavings and shall be free from twists, bends, and other deformation.
 807.49 Pins and Rollers. Pins and rollers shall be accurately
 turned to the specified dimensions and shall be straight, smooth, and
 free from flaws. Pins and rollers more than 9" (225 mm) in diameter
 shall be forged and annealed. Pins and rollers 9" (225 mm) or less
 in diameter may be either forged and annealed or cold-finished
 carbon-steel shafting.
 In pins larger than 9" (225 mm) in diameter, a hole of the
 diameter specified on the plans shall be bored full length along the
 pin axis after the forged pin has been allowed to properly cool to a
 temperature below the critical range. Drilling shall be accomplished
 before the annealing process.
 807.50 Boring Pin Holes. Pin holes shall be bored true to the
 specified diameter, smooth, straight, at right angles with the axis of
 the member, and parallel with each other unless otherwise specified.
 The final surface shall be produced by a finishing cut.
 The distance outside to outside of end holes in tension members
 and inside to inside of end holes in compression members shall not
 vary from that specified more than 1/32" (0.8 mm). Boring of holes
 in built-up members shall be performed after fabrication is
 completed.
 807.51 Pin Clearances. The diameter of the pin hole shall not
 exceed that of the pin by more than 1/50" (0.5 mm) for pins 5"
 (125 mm) or less in diameter or by 1/32" (0.8 mm) for larger pins.
 807.52 Threads for Unfinished Bolts and Pins. Threads for
 bolts and pins for structural steel construction shall conform to the
 current Unified Standard Series UNC-ANSI B 1.1, Class 2A for
 external threads and Class 2B for internal threads, except that pin
 ends having a diameter of 1 3/8" (35 mm) or more shall be threaded
 6 threads to 1" (6 threads to 25.4 mm).
 807.53 Pilot and Driving Nuts. Two pilot nuts and two driving
 nuts for each size of pin shall be furnished, unless otherwise
 specified.
 791

 Truss or Girder Assembly shall consist of assembling initially for
 each truss, arch rib, bent, tower face, continuous beam line, plate
 girder, or rigid frame at least three contiguous shop sections, or
 all members in at least three contiguous panels but not less than
 the number of panels associated with three contiguous chord
 lengths (i.e., length between field splices), and not less than 150'
 (46 m) in the case of structures longer than 150' (46 m). At least
 one shop section or panel or as many panels as are associated
 with a chord length shall be added at the advancing end of the
 assembly before any member is removed from the rearward end
 so that the assembled portion of the structure is never less than
 that specified above. The assembly sequence for beams and
 girders shall include sufficient sections to include two bearings.
 (3) Full Chord Assembly. Full Chord Assembly shall consist
 of assembling, with geometric angles at the joints, the full length
 of each chord of each truss or each leg of each bent or tower, then
 reaming the field connection holes while the members are
 assembled and reaming the web member connections using steel
 templates set at geometric (not cambered) angular relation to the
 chord lines.
 At least one end of each web member shall be milled or
 scribed normal to the longitudinal axis of the member and the
 templates at both ends of the member shall be accurately located

 the shop for the purpose of reaming field connection holes shall be
 match-marked. A diagram showing such marks shall be furnished to
 the Engineer upon request.
 807.57 Finished Members. Finished members shall be true to
 line and free from twists, bends, and open joints.
 When finished members are moved to storage they shall be
 picked up at two or more points. They shall be carefully handled to
 prevent damage, and placed on skids above the ground. Long
 members shall be supported sufficiently to prevent damage from
 deflection.
 807.58 Certification of Identification. The Contractor shall
 furnish an affidavit certifying that throughout the fabrication
 operation the identification of steel has been maintained according
 to this specification.
 807.59 Storage of Materials. Structural material, either plain or
 fabricated, shall be stored above the ground upon platforms, skids,

 manner that they may be transported and unloaded at their
 destination without being excessively stressed, deformed, or
 otherwise damaged.
 Bolts of each size, loose nuts or washers of each size, and
 fasteners tested as an assembly for rotational capacity tests shall be
 packed separately. A list and description of the contained material
 shall be plainly marked on the outside of each shipping container.
 ERECTION
 807.62 Erection of Steel Structures. When the substructure and
 superstructure are constructed under separate contracts, the
 Department will provide the substructure constructed to established
 lines and elevations and properly finished.
 When Bridge
 Construction Control is not included in the Contract, the Department
 will establish the lines and elevations required for erection of the
 superstructure steel.
 The Contractor shall erect the structure steel, remove any
 designated temporary construction, and perform all work required to
 complete the structure or structures as provided in the Contract,
 including the removal of the old structure or structures when
 specified.
 807.63 Methods and Equipment. Before starting the work of
 erection, the Contractor shall advise the Engineer, for informational
 and record purposes, of the method of erection he proposes to follow
 and the type of equipment he proposes for use. The Contractor shall
 be responsible for the safety of his methods and equipment and for
 performing the work according to the plans and specifications.
 794
 
 807
 807.64 Falsework. Details of falsework construction for steel
 erection, complete with dimensions, design calculations, and kind
 and condition of materials, shall be submitted to the Engineer prior
 to construction for informational and record purposes. These details
 shall be prepared and/or approved by a Registered Professional
 Engineer. Construction shall be according to the details submitted
 to the Engineer for informational purposes. The Contractor shall be
 responsible for the results obtained by the use of the falsework
 design.
 All falsework shall be designed and constructed to provide the
 necessary rigidity and to support the loads without appreciable
 settlement or deformation. Falsework shall be set to give the
 finished structure the camber specified.
 Falsework that cannot be founded on a satisfactory footing shall
 be supported on piling which shall be spaced, driven, and removed
 as specified in the Contractor's falsework details.
 Upon completion of the steel erection the Contractor shall
 remove all falsework prior to placing the deck.
 807.65 Handling and Storing Materials. Material to be stored
 shall be supported on skids above the ground. It shall be kept clean
 and properly drained. Girders and beams shall be placed upright
 and properly shored. Long members, such as columns and chords,
 shall be properly supported to prevent damage from deflection.

 specified position and shall have uniform bearing on the masonry.
 Bearing plates shall be accurately set on preformed fabric or
 elastomeric pads meeting the requirements of Subsection 807.15.
 Anchor bolts shall be set in holes drilled in the bridge seat or cast
 in place. Bolts placed in drilled holes shall be accurately set and
 fixed with an approved epoxy or non-shrink grout from the QPL that
 completely fills the holes. The location of anchor bolts in relation to
 slotted holes in expansion shoes shall be determined by the air
 temperature and the amount of expansion at the time of erection.
 Nuts on anchor bolts at the expansion ends of spans shall be
 adjusted to permit free movement of the span.
 795
 
 807
 807.67 Field Welding. All field welding shall be accomplished
 according to the applicable provisions of 807.26.
 807.68 Straightening Bent Members and Correcting Camber.
 (a) Straightening Bent Members. Any member that is bent or
 distorted will be considered unacceptable until the member is either
 replaced or, if appropriate, repaired by a method proposed by the
 Contractor and approved by the Engineer. The straightening of
 plates, angles, other shapes, and built-up members, when permitted
 by the Engineer, shall be accomplished by methods that will not
 produce fracture or damage. Heat straightening of Grade 100 (690)
 steel members shall be accomplished only under rigidly controlled
 procedures and each application shall be subject to the approval of
 the Engineer. In no case shall the maximum temperature of the
 Grade 100 (690) steel exceed 1100° F (590° C) nor shall the
 temperature exceed 950° F (510° C) at or within 6" (150 mm) of
 weld metal. Heat shall not be applied directly to weld metal. In all
 other steels, the temperature of the heated area shall not exceed
 1150° F (620° C) as controlled by temperature-indicating crayons,
 liquids, or bi-metal thermometers.
 Members to be heat straightened shall be substantially free of
 stress and from external forces other than stresses resulting from
 mechanical means used in conjunction with the application of heat.
 Members shall not be artificially cooled except as permitted in
 Subsection 807.27.
 Following the straightening of a bend or distortion, the surface of
 the metal shall be carefully inspected for evidence of fracture. Such
 evidence will be cause for rejection.
 (b) Correcting Camber. Correction of errors in camber in
 beams and girders shall be accomplished only under rigidly
 controlled procedures with each application of heat, subject to
 approval of the Engineer.
 807.69 Assembling Steel. Steel members shall be accurately
 assembled as shown on the plans and match-marks shall be
 followed. Members shall be carefully handled so that no parts will
 be bent, broken, or otherwise damaged. Hammering which will
 damage or distort the members will not be allowed. Bearing
 surfaces and surfaces to be in permanent contact shall be cleaned
 before the members are assembled.
 796
 
 807
 Unless erected by the cantilever method, truss spans shall be
 erected on blocking so as to give the trusses proper camber. The
 blocking shall be left in place until the tension chord splices are
 fully bolted and all other truss connections pinned and bolted.
 Permanent bolts in splices of butt joints of compression members
 and permanent bolts in railings shall not be tightened until the span
 has been made self-supporting.
 Field connections using high strength bolts shall comply with the
 following assembly requirements:
 • At least 4 erection pins, installed in extreme hole locations,
 shall be used. The actual number of erection pins required
 shall be sufficient to ensure proper alignment of the remaining
 holes.
 • A total of at least one half of the holes shall be filled with a
 combination of fitting-up bolts and the above required erection
 pins. At least 50% of this combination shall be fitting-up
 bolts. Fitting-up bolts shall be symmetrically placed.
 For splices, the above requirements shall be applied to each
 element of the splice (i.e. top flange, web, bottom flange) on each
 side of the joint.
 Fitting-up bolts may be either the same high strength bolts used
 for final assembly or they may be other bolts of the same nominal
 diameter as the high strength bolts. If non-high strength fitting-up
 bolts are used, they will be removed and replaced prior to the final
 assembly. Fitting-up bolts that are hammered into position shall not
 be used in the final assembly if thread damage has occurred.
 Erection pins shall be cylindrical and shall have a diameter 1/32"
 (0.8 mm) larger than the high strength bolts used in final assembly.
 The erection pins, as well as any fit-up bolts that are not part of the
 final assembly, shall be furnished by the Contractor at no cost to the
 Department.
 807.70 Unfinished Bolt Connections. Unfinished bolts shall
 conform to the requirements of ASTM A 307, Grade A. Bolts shall
 have single self-locking nuts or double nuts unless otherwise
 specified. Beveled washers shall be used where bearing faces have a
 slope of more than 1:20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt
 axis.
 
 797
 
 807
 807.71 High Strength Bolt Connections. (a) General. High
 strength bolts meeting the requirements of ASTM A325 shall be
 furnished unless otherwise specified.
 Bolts shall be placed with heads on the outside face of exterior
 girders and the bottom of girder flanges.
 High strength fasteners, other than those used in bolted field
 splices for main load-carrying members, may be re-used one time
 after initial tightening to specification tension, provided that a close
 visual inspection indicates that there is no distress in the bolt, no
 damage to the threads, and that the nut runs freely on the bolt.
 When it becomes necessary to remove or loosen a bolt assembly
 after it has been tightened to specification tension twice, the
 assembly must be discarded and a new one substituted.
 High strength fasteners used in bolted field splices for main loadcarrying members may be tightened to specification tension only
 once.
 Retightening previously tightened bolts that may have been
 loosened by the tightening of adjacent bolts will not be considered
 as re-use provided the retightening continues from the initial
 position and does not require greater rotation, including the
 tolerance, than that required by Table 807-1.
 All fitting-up bolts shall be brought to a snug tight condition
 before installing and tightening the balance of high strength bolts.
 Snug tight is defined as the tightness that exists when the plies of the
 joint are in firm contact.
 Following the initial snug tightening of the fitting-up bolts, the
 remaining holes shall be filled with high strength bolts and tightened
 to a snug tight condition. Erection pins and any fitting-up bolts not
 suitable for final assembly shall then be replaced with high strength
 bolts and installed to a snug tight condition. All bolts in the
 connection shall then be tightened to the specified tension.
 Snug tightening and tightening shall progress systematically from
 the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges.
 (b) Bolts, Nuts, and Washers. Bolts, nuts, and washers shall
 conform to the requirements of Subsection 807.06.
 Bolts, nuts, and washers shall be shipped and stored in weather
 proof containers. Bolts and nuts shall be reasonably free of
 798
 
 807
 corrosion or other foreign material. The nut shall run freely on the
 thread, using a wax type lubricant if necessary.
 Fasteners shall be protected from dirt and moisture at the job site.
 Only as many fasteners as are anticipated to be installed and
 tightened during a work shift shall be taken from protected storage.
 Fasteners not used shall be returned to protected storage at the end
 of the shift. Fasteners shall not be cleaned of lubricant that was
 present on delivery. Fasteners that accumulate rust or dirt shall be
 cleaned and re-lubricated prior to installation.
 (c) Bolted Components. Beveled washers shall be used where
 bearing faces have a slope of more than 1:20 with respect to a plane
 normal to the bolt axis. Bolted parts shall fit solidly together when
 assembled and shall not be separated by gaskets or other interposed
 compressible material.
 Assembled joint surfaces adjacent to the bolt heads, nuts, or
 washers shall be free of scale, dirt, burrs, foreign material, or other
 defects that would prevent solid seating of the components.
 Contact surfaces within friction-type joints shall be free of oil,
 paint, lacquer, rust inhibitor, galvanizing, or other foreign material.
 The surfaces shall be cleaned by wire brushing or blasting prior to
 assembly of the joint.
 (d) Installation. (1) Bolt Tension. Each bolt shall be tightened
 to provide, when all bolts in the joint are tight, at least the minimum
 bolt tension shown in Table 807-3 for the size of bolt used.
 Bolts shall be tightened with properly calibrated wrenches or by
 the turn-of-nut method. If required because of bolt and/or wrench
 clearances, tightening by either procedure may be accomplished by
 turning the bolt while the nut is prevented from rotating.

 (2) Washers. Bolts shall have a hardened washer under the
 nut, and under the bolt head if turned in tightening.
 (3) Turn-of-Nut Tightening. When the turn-of-nut method is
 used to provide the bolt tension specified in paragraph (d)(1)
 above, all bolts in the connection shall be tightened by the
 applicable amount of nut rotation specified in Table 807-1.
 During this operation there shall be no rotation of the part not
 turned by the wrench.
 Following this initial operation, bolts shall be placed in any
 remaining holes in the connection and brought to snug tightness.
 All bolts in the joint shall then be tightened additionally by the
 applicable amount of nut rotation specified in Table 807-1.
 Tightening shall progress systematically from the most rigid part
 of the joint to its free edges. During this operation there shall be
 no rotation of the part not turned by the wrench.
 (4) Calibrated Wrench Tightening.
 When calibrated
 wrenches are used to provide the bolt tension specified in
 paragraph (d)(1) above, their setting shall be such as to induce a
 bolt tension 5%-10% in excess of this value. Wrenches shall be
 of adequate capacity to perform the required tightening of each
 bolt in less than 10 seconds. These wrenches shall be calibrated
 at least once each working day by tightening, in a device capable
 of indicating actual bolt tension, not less than 3 typical bolts from
 each lot of 500 of the same grade, size, and condition of the bolts
 800
 
 807
 to be installed. Power wrenches shall be adjusted to stall or cutout at the selected tension.
 After the wrenches are adjusted to provide the required
 tension, the calibration selected shall be verified during actual
 installation of the assembled steel work to ensure that nut or bolt
 head rotation from snug tight is not greater than that permitted in
 Table 807-1, including the 30° tolerance.
 If manual torque wrenches are used, the torque indication
 corresponding to the calibrating tension shall be noted and used
 in the installation of all bolts of the tested lot. When using
 calibrated wrenches to install several bolts in a single joint, the
 wrench shall be returned to "touch up" any bolts. "Touch up"
 shall continue until all bolts are tightened to the specified tension.
 (e) Inspection.
 When the calibrated wrench method of
 tightening is used, the Engineer shall have full opportunity to
 witness the calibration tests prescribed in paragraph (d)(4) above.
 The Engineer will observe the installation and tightening of bolts
 to determine that the selected tightening procedure is properly used
 and will determine that all bolts are tightened as specified.
 Unless otherwise specified, the following inspection procedures
 will be used:
 (1) The Contractor, in the presence of the Engineer, shall use
 an inspection wrench (either torque or power) that can be
 accurately adjusted according to the requirements of paragraph
 (d)(4) above.
 (2) Three typical bolts from each lot of 500 of the same grade,
 size, and condition as those under inspection shall be individually
 placed in a calibration device capable of indicating bolt tension.
 There shall be a washer under the part turned in tightening each
 bolt.
 (3) When the inspecting wrench is a torque wrench, each bolt
 specified in paragraph (e)(2) shall be tightened in the calibration
 device to the minimum tension specified for its size in paragraph
 (d)(1). The inspecting wrench then shall be applied to the
 tightened bolt and the torque necessary to turn the nut or head 5°
 (approximately 1" [25 mm] at 12" [300 mm] radius) in the
 tightening direction shall be determined. The average torque
 measured in the tests of three bolts shall be taken as the job
 801
 
 807
 inspecting torque to be used in the manner specified in paragraph
 (e)(5).
 (4) When the inspecting wrench is a power wrench it shall be
 adjusted so that it will tighten each bolt specified in paragraph
 (e)(2) to a tension at least 5% but not more than 10% greater than
 the minimum tension specified for its size in paragraph (d)(1).
 This wrench setting shall be the job inspecting torque to be used
 in the manner specified in paragraph (e)(5).
 (5) Bolts represented by the sample prescribed in paragraph
 (e)(2) and which have been tightened in the structure shall be
 inspected by applying the inspecting wrench and its job
 inspecting torque to 10% but not less than 2 of the bolts, selected
 at random, in each connection. If no nut or bolt head is turned by
 this application of the job inspecting torque, the connection will
 be accepted as properly tightened. If any nut or bolt head is
 turned by the application of the job inspecting torque, this torque
 shall be applied to all bolts in the connection, and all bolts whose
 nut or head is turned by the job inspecting torque shall be
 tightened and reinspected, or alternatively, the Fabricator or
 Erector, at his option, may retighten all of the bolts in the
 connection and resubmit the connection for the specified
 inspection.
 807.72 Pin Connections. Pilot and driving nuts shall be used in
 driving pins for connections. Pins shall be so driven that the
 members will take full bearing on them. Pin nuts shall be screwed
 up tight and the threads burred at the face of the nut with a pointed
 tool.
 807.73 Misfits. The correction of minor misfits involving
 harmless amounts of reaming, cutting, and chipping will be
 considered a legitimate part of the erection. However, any error in
 the shop fabrication or deformation resulting from handling and
 transportation that prevents the proper assembling and fitting up of
 parts by the moderate use of drift pins or by a moderate amount of
 reaming and slight chipping or cutting, shall be reported
 immediately to the Engineer and his approval of the method of
 correction obtained. The correction shall be made in his presence.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for all misfits, errors, and
 injuries and shall make the necessary corrections and replacements.
 
 802
 
 807
 807.74 Profiling of Steel Beams and Girders.
 Upon
 completion of erection and bolting of beams and girders, the
 Contractor shall profile each beam or girder line. The profiling shall
 be accomplished prior to beginning any deck forming operations.
 These profiles will be used to establish a finished deck elevation to
 provide the correct deck thickness.
 This may require the
 construction of variable haunches over the beams or girders to
 obtain the correct deck elevation and thickness. All required
 haunches are considered variable and the extra materials and work
 required in construction of these haunches shall be at no cost to the
 Department.

 (d) Surfaces Inaccessible After Fabrication.
 The inside
 surfaces of boxed members and other surfaces that will be
 inaccessible to the cleaning operation after fabrication shall be
 cleaned before assembly or cleaned by hand tool methods.
 (e) Unpainted Weathering Structural Steel. Unless otherwise
 specified, Grade 50W (345W) structural steel that is not to be
 painted shall be blast cleaned to remove mill scale or other
 substances. Blast cleaning shall conform to SSPC-SP6, Commercial
 Blast Cleaning. Care shall be taken that dents, scratches, gouges, or
 identification marks will not appear on exposed surfaces. All steel
 is to remain in the unpainted condition and shall be handled so that it
 is kept free of all grease, oil, concrete, chalk marks, dirt, or any
 808
 
 807
 other foreign material that might affect the natural and uniform
 weathering of the steel.
 Any foreign material that adheres to the steel during the
 fabrication or construction process that will inhibit the formation of
 the oxide film shall be removed as soon as practicable according to
 the SSPC Surface Preparation Specifications by one of the following
 four methods:
 1) SSPC-SP1, Solvent Cleaning

 3) SSPC-SP3, Power Tool Cleaning
 4) SSPC-SP7, Brush-off Blast Cleaning
 807.85 Shop Painting. Unless otherwise specified, structural
 steel shall be given one shop coat of approved paint before it is
 shipped from the plant.
 Surfaces that will not be exposed to the atmosphere in the final
 structure, and which will be inaccessible after assembly, erection, or
 placement of concrete shall be given a prime coat but will not
 require a finish coat. Field contact surfaces of bolted connections,
 including all components of bolted splices, shall receive a prime
 coat of paint in the shop.
 A shop prime coat of paint shall be applied to the top of the top
 flanges of all beams and girders.
 Structural steel that is to be field welded shall not be painted
 before the field welding is complete.
 Unless otherwise specified, surfaces of iron and steel castings,
 either milled or finished, shall be painted.
 With the exception of abutting joints and base plates, machinefinished surfaces shall be coated, as soon as practicable after being
 accepted, with a graphite dry film lubricant or other approved
 coating prior to removal from the shop.
 Erection and weight marks shall be painted upon surface areas
 that have previously been painted with the shop coat. Material shall
 not be loaded for shipment until it has thoroughly dried, and in no
 case less than 24 hours after the paint has been applied.
 807.86 Field Painting. When erection work is complete, any
 adhering rust, scale, dirt, oil, grease, or other foreign materials shall
 be removed as specified in Subsection 807.84.
 809
 
 807
 All areas of prime coat and/or shop applied epoxy tie coat that
 have been damaged or are otherwise defective shall be corrected
 according to the manufacturer's recommendations prior to
 application of the finish system. Areas requiring a finish coat on
 which the prime and/or epoxy tie coat was not applied shall be
 cleaned and the required coats applied prior to application of the
 finish coat. All surfaces shall be free of any soluble residue or
 excessive amounts of loose zinc before the finish or epoxy tie coat is
 applied.
 All paint, including prime, epoxy tie coat, and urethane finish
 coat, shall be properly cured according to the manufacturer’s
 recommendations; and limitations on recoat time complied with.
 Subsequent coatings shall be applied as soon as practical after recoat
 requirements are met. When application of subsequent coatings is
 not done within the specified time, the previously applied coating
 may require additional surface preparation, subject to the
 manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Epoxy tie coats and finish coats shall not be applied to the contact
 surfaces of bolted connections. Surfaces that will be inaccessible
 after erection and will be exposed to the atmosphere shall be painted
 with the applicable field coats prior to erection. When the paint
 applied for correcting the shop coat has thoroughly dried and the
 field cleaning has been satisfactorily completed, the required field
 coats shall be applied. Small cracks and cavities that were not
 sealed in a watertight manner by the field prime coat shall be filled
 with an additional application of field prime coat paint before the
 finish system is applied.
 The following provision shall apply to the application of the field
 prime and the finish system: To secure a maximum coating on
 edges of plates, shapes, bolts, and other parts subjected to special
 wear, the edges shall first be coated with a longitudinal motion and
 the bolts with a rotary motion followed immediately by the general
 painting of the whole surface, including the edges and bolts.
 If traffic produces an objectionable amount of dust, the
 Contractor shall, at no cost to the Department, settle the dust for the
 necessary distance on each side of the structure and take any other
 precautions necessary to prevent dust and dirt from coming in
 contact with surfaces to be painted or with freshly painted surfaces.
 
 810
 
 807
 The application of the finish coat shall be deferred until adjoining
 concrete work has been placed and finished.
 807.87 Preparing Galvanized Surfaces for Painting. When
 required, the painting of galvanized surfaces shall be deferred as
 long as possible to allow weathering of the surfaces.
 Before painting, galvanized surfaces shall be prepared as follows:
 All soil, concrete spatter, and other surface dirt shall be removed
 with a stiff brush, scraper, or other suitable means.
 All surfaces shall be cleaned with alkaline detergents such as
 trisodium phosphate. Surfaces cleaned with detergents shall be
 thoroughly rinsed with hot water to remove alkaline residue.
 Solvents may be required to remove certain contaminants, including
 oil or grease. When solvents are used, special care shall be taken to
 assure proper ventilation and safe working conditions.
 Manufacturers' recommendations for the use of solvents shall be
 followed.
 The use of gasoline, benzene, low-flash naphtha, or other highly
 volatile fluids, and the washing of galvanized surfaces with vinegar
 or other acids prior to painting will not be allowed.
 As an alternative to detergent and solvent cleaning, sweep
 blasting of the galvanized surface will be permitted.
 The field prime and finish system shall be applied according to
 Subsection 807.86.
 807.88 Repairing Damaged Galvanized Coatings. Galvanizing
 that has been chipped off or damaged in handling, transporting, or
 welding shall be repaired by field galvanizing.
 Field galvanizing shall be accomplished by the application of a
 paste composed of approved zinc powder and flux with a minimum
 amount of water. The areas to be coated shall be thoroughly
 cleaned, including removal of any slag on welds, before the paste is
 applied. The surface to be coated shall first be heated with a torch to
 a temperature sufficient that the metallics in the paste are melted
 when applied to the heated surface. Extreme care shall be taken to
 assure that surrounding surfaces are not damaged by the torch. The
 flux in the paste will cause a black residue on the surface of the
 coated parts. This black residue shall be removed by rinsing with
 water or wiping with a clean, damp cloth.
 811
 
 807
 Other methods of repairs may be used as allowed by
 ASTM A 780, Repair of Hot-Dip Galvanized Coatings. Products
 used for repair shall be as listed on the Department's QPL or as
 approved by the Engineer.
 Repair to damaged galvanized coatings shall be accomplished at
 no cost to the Department.
 807.89 Method of Measurement. (a) Measurement for structural
 steel will be based on plan quantities of the weight of structural steel
 in the fabricated structure. When this weight is altered by the
 Engineer, the weight of structural steel for payment will be adjusted
 to account for the change. Where the Fabricator's or Contractor's
 calculations indicate an error in plan quantities that varies more than
 1% from the planned project quantity, calculations may be
 submitted for checking by the Department and, if verified, the
 corrected weight will be used. The weight of shop and field paint,
 boxes, crates, and other containers used for packing, and for sills,
 struts, and rods used for supporting members during transportation,
 will be excluded.
 If the scale weight of any member is less than 97.5% of the
 computed weight, the member will be rejected.
 The weights are computed on the following basis:

 808.05 Lot Testing. Testing for meeting the requirements of
 Subsection 808.02 shall be performed by the manufacturer on each
 production lot of bearings.
 For each lot of reinforced bearings, a randomly selected sample
 comprising at least 10 percent of the lot shall be compression tested
 817
 
 808
 by the manufacturer. Each bearing shall be individually loaded to
 1.5 times its maximum design load shown on the plans for a
 minimum period of 15 hours. If, during the test, the load falls below
 1.3 times the maximum design load, the test duration shall be
 increased by the period of time for which the load is below this
 limit. The bearing shall be examined visually at the end of the test
 while it is still under load. If the bulging pattern suggests lamina
 parallelism, a layer thickness that is outside the specified tolerances,
 or poor lamina bond, the bearing shall be rejected. If there are three
 or more surface cracks that are greater than 0.08" x 0.08" (2 mm
 wide and 2 mm deep), the bearing shall be rejected.
 If a sample fails any test required by this subsection, all bearings
 of that lot will be rejected, unless the manufacturer elects to test
 each bearing for the failing test(s) at no cost to the Department.
 A lot is defined as a group of no more than 100 bearings which
 are manufactured from the same batch of elastomer, cured under the
 same conditions and are all the same size.
 808.06 Visual Inspection and Proof Loading of Finished
 Bearings. Every bearing shall be inspected for compliance with
 dimensional tolerances and for overall quality of manufacture. In
 reinforced bearings, the edges of the internal steel lamina shall be
 protected everywhere from corrosion.
 The manufacturer shall proof load each reinforced bearing
 individually with a compressive load equal to 1.5 times its
 maximum design load shown on the plans. The load shall be held
 constant for five minutes, removed, and reapplied for another five
 minutes. The bearing shall be examined visually while under the
 second loading. If the bulging pattern suggests lamina parallelism, a
 layer thickness that is outside the specified tolerances, or poor
 lamina bond, the bearing shall be rejected. If there are three or more
 separate surface cracks that are greater than 0.08" x 0.08" (2 mm
 wide and 2 mm deep), the bearing shall be rejected.
 808.07 Certification and Marking. The manufacturer shall
 certify that each bearing satisfies these specifications and shall
 supply a certified copy of all test results, including the number of
 reinforced bearings that failed the proof load test. Certified mill
 certificates for internal steel lamina and external load plates shall
 also be supplied.
 818
 
 808
 Each reinforced bearing shall be marked in indelible ink or
 flexible paint. The marking shall consist of the bent/pier number,
 orientation, the order number, lot number, bearing identification
 number, and elastomer type and grade number. Unless otherwise
 specified, the marking shall be on a face that is visible after erection
 of the bridge.
 808.08 Installation. Reinforced bearings shall be placed on
 level, uniform surfaces. Any misalignment in the support shall be
 corrected to form a level surface. Bottom external load plates
 (masonry plates), when used, shall be set on unreinforced pads.
 Preformed fabric pads meeting the requirements of Subsection
 807.15(a) may be used in lieu of unreinforced pads.
 Unless otherwise approved by the Engineer, the external load
 plate at expansion bearings may be welded to the beam/girder only
 when:
 the approximate average air temperature during the 24
 hour period immediately preceding welding is between
 40º F and 80º F (4º C and 27º C); and
 • the slots in the external load plate are positioned to center
 on the anchor bolts; and
 • no horizontal deformation of the elastomeric pad is
 evident.
 If welding at other temperatures is required, the Engineer will
 provide adjustment data.
 In no case shall the elastomer or the bond be subjected to
 temperatures higher than 400° F (204° C).
 •
 
 808.09 Method of Measurement. Reinforced elastomeric
 bearings will be measured by the cubic inch (cubic centimeter) of
 elastomer material, including required lamina. No deductions will
 be made for bolt holes. External load plates will not be measured or
 paid for separately but will be considered included in the contract
 unit price bid for Elastomeric Bearings.
 Unreinforced pads will not be measured separately, but will be
 considered subsidiary to "Class S Concrete - Bridge."

 composed of a mixture of one part portland cement and three parts
 sand, mixed with water to produce a workable consistency. The
 amount of water used shall be approved by the Engineer.
 816.03 Construction Requirements. (a) General. Prior to
 placing filter blanket and riprap, the slopes shall be shaped as shown
 833
 
 816
 on the plans. When rock or hard shale is encountered at the toe of
 the slope, the riprap shall be keyed into this material at least the
 depth of the riprap.
 (b) Filter Blanket. Granular filter blanket material shall be
 spread uniformly on the previously prepared and approved surface
 to the thickness and location shown on the plans. Placement of the
 material by methods that will cause segregation or cause damage to
 the surface will not be permitted. Compaction of filter blanket will
 not be required, but it shall be finished to present a reasonably even
 surface free from mounds or windrows.
 When fabric is used in lieu of granular material, it shall be placed
 directly on the prepared surface. Fabric sections may be placed
 vertically or horizontally on the slope. Adjacent fabric sections shall
 be joined by overlapping a minimum of 2' (0.6 m) at the edges and
 pinning the overlapped strip with U-shaped wire pins, single shaped
 steel pins with metal disc heads, or similar fasteners. The fasteners
 shall be 6″ (150 mm) or more in length and shall hold the fabric
 firmly in place. Fasteners shall be inserted through both strips of
 overlapped fabric at intervals of approximately 4' (1.2 m) along the

 fabric shall be turned down and buried approximately 12" (0.3 m)
 deep at the exterior limits.
 No construction equipment will be permitted directly on the
 fabric.
 (c) Dumped Riprap. Stone, broken concrete, or steel slag for
 dumped riprap shall be placed in such a manner as to produce a
 reasonably well graded mass of rock with the minimum practicable
 percentage of voids and shall be constructed to the lines and grades
 shown on the plans or as directed by the Engineer. Material shall be
 placed in such a manner as to avoid displacing the underlying
 material. The larger pieces shall be well distributed throughout the
 entire mass and the finished riprap shall be free from objectionable
 pockets of small or large pieces. Hand placing, to a limited extent,
 may be required, but only to the extent necessary to secure the
 results specified above. Placing riprap by dumping into chutes or by
 similar methods likely to cause segregation will not be permitted.
 
 834
 
 816
 Riprap stone or steel slag shall not be deposited in a manner that
 will cause damage to the filter blanket. Any damage to fabric during
 placement of riprap shall be corrected by the Contractor at no cost to
 the Department prior to proceeding with the work. Damaged fabric
 shall be repaired by placing a piece of fabric large enough to cover
 the damaged area and overlapping and pinning according to
 Subsection 816.03(b).
 Dumped riprap for locations designated on the plans for detours
 shall be constructed to the lines and dimensions shown on the plans
 and in accordance with the provisions above except that:
 • Synthetic fiber fabric shall be used in lieu of granular filter
 blanket material.

 Dumped riprap and synthetic fiber fabric shall be placed
 immediately after the detour embankment is constructed.
 The placement of any base material or pavement will not be
 permitted on the detour until the riprap has been placed on
 the detour slopes and approved by the Engineer.
 
 Removal of the riprap and filter fabric after the detour is no
 longer needed will be measured and paid for as Unclassified
 Excavation under Section 210. Upon removal, salvaged riprap that
 meets the requirements of Subsection 816.02 will be paid for when
 reused in other areas which require the utilization of riprap.
 (d) Concrete Riprap. Concrete for riprap shall be cast in place
 as shown on the plans. Except as modified herein, construction shall
 conform to Section 802 with a minimum concrete slump of 1"
 (25 mm) permitted.
 Excessive cutting, washing, or other damage to the slope shall be
 restored before placing the concrete, using mechanical tampers to
 obtain compaction according to the requirements of
 Subsection 210.10. Surfaces of the slopes and toe walls shall be
 moist when the concrete is placed.
 Splices in any required wire mesh fabric reinforcement shall be
 lapped at least 6" (150 mm). At the edge of the riprap, the wire
 mesh shall not be less than 1" (25 mm) nor more than 3″ (75 mm)
 from the edge of the concrete, and shall have no wires projecting
 beyond the last member parallel to the edge of the concrete.
 835
 
 816
 Reinforcement shall be properly supported throughout the
 placement of concrete to maintain its correct vertical position,
 according to Subsection 804.06.
 Concrete riprap shall be placed in strips of dimensions as shown
 on the plans. When not designated on the plans, the concrete shall
 be placed in alternate vertical strips with the remaining strips being
 filled in later. The width of strips shall be 5' (1.5 m) with 1/4"
 (6 mm) transverse dummy grooves on 5' (1.5 m) centers for the
 entire length of the strip. The joints between strips shall be normal
 to the slope and shall be cold joints without filler. A 1/2" (12 mm)
 premolded joint filler shall be placed immediately adjacent to all
 fixed construction before placing the concrete.
 After the concrete has been placed and consolidated to the
 dimensions specified, and after it has set sufficiently to avoid
 slumping, the surface shall be finished with a wooden float to a
 reasonably smooth and uniform surface. Curing shall be according
 to Subsection 802.17. Weep holes are to be provided as shown on
 the plans or as directed by the Engineer.
 (e) Foundation Protection Riprap. Stone or steel slag shall be
 carefully dumped to ensure reasonable conformance with the

 in accordance with (c) above. The stones shall be thoroughly wetted
 immediately prior to applying the grout. The grout shall be
 thoroughly worked into the voids as the grout is deposited on the
 surface of the riprap. The stones shall then be brushed to expose
 the top surfaces. The grouted riprap shall then be cured in
 accordance with Subsection 501.05(l).
 816.04 Method of Measurement. Filter Blanket and riprap will
 be measured according to the units of measure herein specified.
 Quantities shown on the plans for Filter Blanket, Dumped Riprap,
 Concrete Riprap, Sacked Sand-Cement Riprap, and Dumped Riprap
 (Grouted) will be considered as the final quantities and no further
 measurement will be made unless, in the opinion of the Engineer or
 upon evidence furnished by the Contractor, substantial variations
 exist between quantities shown on the plans and actual quantities
 due to changes in alignment or dimensions or to apparent errors, in
 which case the entire in-place quantity at the affected location(s)
 will be measured, with measurement being made parallel to the
 surface. Dumped Riprap, Concrete Riprap, Sacked Sand-Cement
 Riprap, and Dumped Riprap (Grouted) will be measured by the
 cubic yard (cubic meter). Filter Blanket will be measured by the
 square yard (square meter). Foundation Protection Riprap will be
 measured by the ton (metric ton).
 816.05 Basis of Payment. Work completed and accepted and
 measured as provided above will be paid for at the contract unit
 price bid per square yard (square meter) for Filter Blanket; per cubic
 yard (cubic meter) for the items Dumped Riprap, Concrete Riprap,
 Sacked Sand-Cement Riprap, and Dumped Riprap (Grouted); or per
 ton (metric ton) for Foundation Protection Riprap, which prices shall
 be full compensation for furnishing materials, including reinforcing
 steel when specified on the plans; for preparation of the slope; for
 excavation including toe trench and backfill; for performing mix
 designs, and quality control and acceptance sampling and testing for
 concrete riprap; for placing; and for all labor, equipment, tools, and
 incidentals necessary to complete the work.
 
 837

 SECTION 822
 REPAIR AND OVERLAY OF CONCRETE BRIDGE
 DECKS
 822.01 Description. This item shall consist of repair and overlay
 of concrete bridge decks as designated on the plans or as specified
 by the Engineer.
 Bridge deck repair and bridge deck overlay shall be classified as
 follows:
 (a) Bridge Deck Repair. (1) Bridge Deck Repair Without
 Subsequent Overlay. This item shall consist of removing unsound
 portions of the existing bridge deck concrete, disposing of the
 removed concrete, and replacing the removed volume with concrete
 meeting the requirements of Section 802 for Class S(AE) Concrete
 or Subsection 822.02. The concrete shall have a surface finish
 equivalent to that of the existing deck surface.
 860
 
 822
 (2) Bridge Deck Repair With Subsequent Overlay. This
 item shall consist of removing unsound portions of the existing
 bridge deck concrete, disposing of the removed concrete, and
 replacing the removed volume with concrete meeting the
 requirements of Subsection 822.02 at the same time the bridge deck
 overlay is placed.
 (b) Bridge Deck Overlay. This item shall consist of removing
 the existing deck concrete to a depth 1/2" (12 mm) below the
 existing finished surface, except as otherwise noted on the plans,
 disposing of the removed concrete, and overlaying with concrete
 meeting the requirements of Subsection 822.02. The thickness of
 the concrete overlay shall be measured from the elevation
 established for removal of the existing deck to the final surface
 elevation as shown on the plans or established by the Engineer.
 822.02 Materials. (a) Coarse Aggregate shall meet the following
 gradation requirements:
 Sieve Size
 Percent Passing
 3/4" (19 mm)

 (b) Fine aggregate, cement, water, air entraining agent, retarder,
 and all other materials shall conform to Section 802, except the use
 of Type IP cement or fly ash will not be allowed.
 (c) The concrete mixture shall be proportioned by weight of dry
 materials in the ratio of: two parts coarse aggregate, two parts fine
 aggregate, and one part cement. The consistency range in slump
 shall be from 1"-2" (25 mm-50 mm). The air content range shall be
 6% ±2%. Trial batches will be required according to Subsection
 802.05(c).
 (d) Grout for bonding the new concrete to previously placed
 concrete shall consist of equal parts by weight of portland cement
 and sand mixed with sufficient water to form a thin slurry of such
 consistency that it can be applied with a stiff brush or broom in a
 thin, even coating without running or puddling.
 (e) The minimum compressive strength of the concrete used in
 bridge deck repair and overlay shall be 4000 psi (28.0 MPa) at 28
 861
 
 822
 days. The Department will perform acceptance sampling and testing
 in accordance with Subsection 802.06.
 (f) Reinforcing steel, when required by the plans, shall conform
 to the requirements of Section 804.
 822.03 Equipment. The equipment used shall be subject to the
 approval of the Engineer and shall comply with the following:
 (a) Surface preparation equipment shall be of the following
 types:
 (1) Sawing equipment shall be capable of sawing concrete to
 the specified depth.
 (2) Scarifying equipment shall be power operated and capable
 of uniformly removing the old surface to the depths required in a
 satisfactory manner.
 (3) Sand blasting or other surface cleaning equipment shall be
 capable of removing rust and old concrete from the exposed
 reinforcement and concrete laitance from the existing concrete
 surface.
 (4) Power driven hand tools for removal of concrete will be
 permitted.
 However, jackhammers heavier than nominal
 30 pound (14 kg) class and chipping hammers heavier than
 nominal 15 pound (7 kg) class shall not be used. Jackhammers or
 mechanical chipping tools shall generally not be operated at an
 angle in excess of 45° measured from the surface of the deck.
 (b) Placing and finishing equipment shall include a mechanical
 screed meeting the requirements of Subsection 802.20, equipped
 with sufficient vibrators, and having an effective weight to
 sufficiently consolidate the mixture.
 The finishing machine shall be capable of forward and reverse
 motion under positive control. Provision shall be made for raising
 the screed to clear the screeded surface for traveling in reverse.
 Supporting rails upon which the finishing machine travels will be
 required on all overlay work. The support for these rails shall be
 fully adjustable (not shimmed) to obtain the specified concrete
 profile.
 When placing concrete that abuts a previously completed surface,
 that side of the screed that abuts the completed surface shall match
 862
 
 822
 the grade of the completed surface. It will not be permissible to drill
 holes in the completed surface for the purpose of supporting a rail.
 For bridge deck repair without subsequent overlay, the
 Contractor may utilize hand methods of placing and finishing
 concrete that produces satisfactory results.
 822.04 Preparation of Surface. (a) General. Concrete shall be
 removed from areas designated on the plans or by the Engineer to
 the depth specified consistent with the classification for that area.
 The use of hand tools may be required to remove final particles
 of concrete to achieve the required depth.
 Immediately before applying grout in preparation for placement
 of new concrete, the concrete and reinforcing steel surfaces shall be
 sand blasted, followed by an air or water cleaning. The sand
 blasting shall be of such extent as to remove all dust, dirt, oil, and
 other foreign material, as well as any unsound concrete or laitance,
 from the surface and edges against which the overlay is to be placed.
 (b) Bridge Deck Repair. Concrete shall be removed by
 chipping or by a combination of scarifying and chipping, except that
 final cleanup may require the use of hand tools. Removal for bridge
 deck repair without subsequent overlay shall extend to at least 3/4"
 (19 mm) below the bottom of the top reinforcing bars. Removal for
 bridge deck repair with subsequent overlay shall extend to at least
 the top of the top reinforcing bars. In either case, the depth removed
 shall extend deeper, if necessary, to remove unsound concrete. This
 removal may be accomplished coincidental with preparation for an
 overlay.
 Where bond between existing concrete and reinforcing steel has
 been destroyed, the concrete adjacent to the bar shall be removed to
 a depth that will permit new concrete to bond to the entire periphery
 of the bar so exposed. A minimum of 3/4" (19 mm) clearance shall
 be required around the bar. Care shall be exercised to prevent
 cutting or damaging any exposed reinforcing steel.
 The Engineer may require enlarging a designated portion of the
 deck should inspection indicate deterioration of the concrete or
 corrosion of the reinforcing steel beyond the limits previously
 designated.
 
 863
 
 822
 (c) Bridge Deck Overlay. The entire existing concrete deck area
 shall be uniformly scarified and prepared to a depth as specified in
 Subsection 822.01.
 The minimum thickness of concrete above the prepared surface
 or reinforcing steel shall be 1¾" (45 mm), but shall be greater when
 specified on the plans or by the Engineer.
 The clearance of the screed over the prepared deck surface shall
 be checked as follows before concrete is placed: A filler block
 having a thickness 1/8" (3 mm) less than the overlay thickness shall
 be attached to the bottom of the screed, and with screed guides in
 place, the screed shall be passed over the area to be overlayed. As
 an alternate to passage of the finishing machine, an approved
 template, supported by the screed guides, may be passed over the
 overlay area. Where the intended clearance does not permit use of
 this method, a stringline or other means shall be used, subject to
 approval of the Engineer.
 All old concrete that does not have sufficient clearance shall be
 removed. All reinforcing steel that does not have sufficient
 clearance shall be depressed and fastened down. It may be
 necessary to remove concrete beneath some reinforcement to permit
 depressing the reinforcement adequately. The minimum clear
 distance around these bars for placement of new concrete shall be
 3/4" (19 mm). Any damaged epoxy coating of existing reinforcing
 steel shall be repaired according to Subsection 804.05.
 822.05 Placing and Finishing Concrete. After the surface has
 been cleaned, and immediately before placing concrete, a thin
 coating of bonding grout shall be scrubbed into the dry, prepared
 surface. Care shall be exercised to ensure that all areas receive a
 thorough, even coating and that the grout does not become dry
 before it is covered with concrete.
 Concrete shall be placed in a continuous operation.
 The overlay shall be consolidated to 98% of maximum
 theoretical density as determined by AASHTO T 121. All overlay
 concrete within 12" (0.3 m) of any edge of a placement shall be
 spaded, hand vibrated, or troweled, as required, to assure that
 density of the mix at the edge is obtained. The Engineer may
 require that sections of the overlay along the edge be removed in
 order to confirm proper consolidation and bonding of the overlay.
 The removal shall be accomplished by sawing and chipping or by
 864
 
 822
 coring. The removal and replacement of the overlay or any part of
 the existing deck to make this confirmation will be at no cost to the
 Department.
 To assure a neat junction, concrete in an overlay previously
 placed shall be sawed to a straight and vertical edge at longitudinal
 and transverse joints before the subsequent concrete is placed.
 Joints between new overlay placements shall be sawed to provide
 a straight and vertical 1/4" x 1" (6 mm x 25 mm) joint. Joints
 adjacent to existing concrete, for both repair and overlay, may be
 1/4" x 1" (6 mm x 25 mm) formed joints, or they may be sawed,
 provided a straight and vertical joint is obtained. These joints shall
 be prepared according to Subsection 501.05 and filled with Type 3
 or 4 silicone sealer meeting the requirements of Subsection 501.02,
 unless otherwise noted on the plans.
 Although repair is considered to begin 1/2" (12 mm) below the
 original concrete surface, repair concrete shall be placed
 monolithically with the concrete overlay.
 The final finish of the overlay shall be a Class 5, Tined Bridge
 Roadway Surface Finish according to Subsection 802.19 unless
 otherwise noted on the plans.
 For bridge deck repair without subsequent overlay, the above
 procedures for application of grout and placement and consolidation
 of concrete shall be followed, and the surface shall be finished to a
 surface finish equivalent to that of the existing deck surface.
 822.06 Curing Concrete. Curing of the concrete shall be
 according to Subsection 802.17 except as modified by the following:
 A clear membrane curing compound shall be applied to the exposed
 concrete immediately after finishing. The overlay or repair shall be
 kept continuously wet and cured for at least 72 hours. In periods of
 cool weather the Engineer will extend this curing period as
 necessary to obtain 72 hours above 55° F (13° C).
 822.07 Limitation of Operations. No concrete repair or overlay
 shall be placed when the air or deck temperature is below 40° F
 (4° C). The temperature of the concrete at the time of placement
 shall not exceed 85° F (29° C).
 No preparation, placing, or finishing equipment will be operated
 on a previously placed concrete repair or overlay for at least 36
 hours after placement.
 865
 
 822
 Preparation for a repair or overlay may be started adjacent to a
 previously placed repair or overlay the day following its placement.
 If this preparation is started before the end of the normal 72 hour
 curing period, the work will be restricted as follows:
 1) Sawing or other operations shall interfere with the curing
 process for the minimum practical time, and only in the
 immediate work area.
 The curing shall be resumed
 promptly.
 2) No power driven tools heavier than a 15 pound (7 kg)
 chipping hammer shall be used.
 3) Air compressors shall only be operated on the deck directly
 over the piers.
 4) No loads other than necessary construction equipment will
 be permitted on any portion of the bridge deck that has
 undergone preparation prior to placement of the concrete.
 5) No vehicles will be permitted on the finished concrete for 72
 hours after placement and curing is complete.
 822.08 Quality Control and Acceptance. Quality control and
 acceptance testing shall be according to the provisions of Subsection
 802.06. In addition, the consolidation of the concrete shall be
 determined by ASTM C1040. The Department will perform
 acceptance sampling and testing in accordance with Subsection
 802.06.
 822.09 Method of Measurement. Bridge Deck Repair or Bridge
 Deck Overlay will be measured by the square yard (square meter)
 for the areas actually repaired or overlayed.
 When Bridge Deck Repair is accomplished in conjunction with
 Bridge Deck Overlay, the respective items will be measured
 separately for the areas actually repaired and overlayed.
 Reinforcing steel required by the plans in bridge deck repair and
 overlay will be measured and paid for according to Section 804.
 If the Contractor's methods cause damage to existing sound
 concrete or to reinforcing steel that is designated to be retained, such
 damaged material shall be repaired or replaced by the Contractor at
 no cost to the Department.
 822.10 Basis of Payment. Work completed and accepted and
 measured as provided above will be paid for at the contract unit
 866
 
 822
 price bid per square yard (square meter) for Bridge Deck Repair or
 Bridge Deck Overlay, which price shall be full compensation for
 removal and disposal of concrete; for preparation of the area to be
 repaired or overlayed; for furnishing, placing, consolidating,
 finishing, and curing concrete; and for all materials, forms, labor,
 equipment, tools, and incidentals necessary to complete the work.
